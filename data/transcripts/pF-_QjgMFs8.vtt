on behalf of the department in support
 
00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 align:start position:0%
of HB um
 
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 align:start position:0%
1241 um just to give you a little
 
00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
background this bill is really a
 
00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
continuation of uh an effort last year
 
00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 align:start position:0%
in HB
 
00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 align:start position:0%
522 um which was adopted and went into
 
00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
effect over the summer that bill if you
 
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 align:start position:0%
may recall adopted nine exemptions from
 
00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 align:start position:0%
What's called the model money
 
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
transmission modernization act
 
00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 align:start position:0%
um and this bill
 
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 align:start position:0%
1241 finishes the adoption by pulling in
 
00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
the rest of that mtma into RSA 399 G
 
00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:26.879 align:start position:0%
um I don't want to take up too much of
 
00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 align:start position:0%
the committee's time by going into
 
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 align:start position:0%
specifics it is a long bill it's a
 
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
replace and uh reenact
 
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 align:start position:0%
bill but I will just say uh to note that
 
00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
there are a couple things that don't
 
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 align:start position:0%
change um the exemptions from last year
 
00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 align:start position:0%
don't change that includes the crypto
 
00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 align:start position:0%
exemption that has come up frequently in
 
00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:54.670 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 align:start position:0%
and uh yeah with that I I guess I'm open
 
00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 align:start position:0%
to any questions the committee has at
 
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:08.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
members okay representative
 
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
Herbert uh what's the relationship with
 
00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 align:start position:0%
crypto uh that's a good question thank
 
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
you for asking I the relationship in so
 
00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 align:start position:0%
far as it relates to
 
00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.590 align:start position:0%
far as it relates to
crypto

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
crypto
 
00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 align:start position:0%
it's it's tangential in some respects
 
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
because in many instances crypto firms
 
00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
are not subject to uh registration under
 
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
the money transmission act um the money
 
00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:42.639 align:start position:0%
transmission act the registration Act
 
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 align:start position:0%
only applies to firms that that transmit
 
00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 align:start position:0%
Fiat uh so if there is a company that
 
00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 align:start position:0%
operates in both spheres crypto and Fiat
 
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 align:start position:0%
they would have to be registered with
 
00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
the department but the jurisdiction of
 
00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 align:start position:0%
the department only extends to certain
 
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.310 align:start position:0%
the department only extends to certain
subsets

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 align:start position:0%
subsets
 
00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 align:start position:0%
of the Transmissions that they
 
00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 align:start position:0%
undertake for the question M inquire um
 
00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:10.639 align:start position:0%
so as of this point in time there hasn't
 
00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:14.919 align:start position:0%
been uh anyone who has tried to register
 
00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:19.479 align:start position:0%
uh as a money transfer uh service crypto
 
00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.039 align:start position:0%
in other
 
00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 align:start position:0%
words uh I don't know the exact number I
 
00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
can tell you I I think I can say pretty
 
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 align:start position:0%
certainly that we have some entities
 
00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:32.199 align:start position:0%
that are registered that do operate with
 
00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
crypto but we do not we have no
 
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 align:start position:0%
transactions so we don't regulate it in
 
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
other words right now um any crypto
 
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 align:start position:0%
transaction if somebody has a problem
 
00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
with it you would be calling the
 
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office you would you
 
00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
be uh using it it's a consumer
 
00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 align:start position:0%
protection issue it would not have
 
00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:58.479 align:start position:0%
anything to do with the banking
 
00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:00.029 align:start position:0%
anything to do with the banking
Department

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:00.039 align:start position:0%
Department
 
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
that's right unless and until Fiat um
 
00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:05.720 align:start position:0%
unless Fiat is being transmitted in
 
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 align:start position:0%
which case they may fall under the
 
00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:14.800 align:start position:0%
Department okay a lot of questions but
 
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
that's be okay so yeah so this has been
 
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
right from the get-go Chris that that
 
00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:23.800 align:start position:0%
we've always have basically treated that
 
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
crypto if remember the beanie
 
00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.120 align:start position:0%
baby remember the when we used to call
 
00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:31.720 align:start position:0%
crypto beating babies U no not really
 
00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
but okay but that they were a commodity
 
00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:36.520 align:start position:0%
crypto is a commodity it's not it's not
 
00:06:39.309 --> 00:06:39.319 align:start position:0%
money it's not Fiat yeah okay so there
 
00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:41.479 align:start position:0%
is no regulation we don't have anything
 
00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
to do with it when it comes to the
 
00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.110 align:start position:0%
to do with it when it comes to the
banking

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
banking
 
00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:47.639 align:start position:0%
Department okay but you have somebody
 
00:06:51.309 --> 00:06:51.319 align:start position:0%
who registers who is registered well if
 
00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
a company does both yeah then they would
 
00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
have to register right so why don't you
 
00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
describe a typical company who what kind
 
00:06:59.749 --> 00:06:59.759 align:start position:0%
of companies are we talking about about
 
00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:01.400 align:start position:0%
here for the most part money
 
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
transmission we're talking about I mean
 
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
to use a classic example would be the
 
00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:08.440 align:start position:0%
Western Unions of the world or literally
 
00:07:10.589 --> 00:07:10.599 align:start position:0%
sending money Fiat money from one
 
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
location to another
 
00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
um and there's been some I think
 
00:07:19.909 --> 00:07:19.919 align:start position:0%
questions at the at the federal level on
 
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:22.520 align:start position:0%
how that interplays with the crypto uh
 
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:24.120 align:start position:0%
firms and the fintech firms and that's
 
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
what this legislation I think is
 
00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
designed to sort of clarify or start to
 
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.589 align:start position:0%
designed to sort of clarify or start to
clarify

00:07:31.589 --> 00:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:34.840 align:start position:0%
actually I found that U I tried to use
 
00:07:36.629 --> 00:07:36.639 align:start position:0%
Western Union once for my daughter and
 
00:07:38.189 --> 00:07:38.199 align:start position:0%
it didn't work out while I flunk the
 
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
tests that they were asking and and then
 
00:07:42.589 --> 00:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
then someone said well why don't you
 
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
just go down to a Walmart and it turns
 
00:07:46.869 --> 00:07:46.879 align:start position:0%
out all you have to do is find another
 
00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:48.560 align:start position:0%
Walmart and they transfer the money
 
00:07:50.749 --> 00:07:50.759 align:start position:0%
right over for you piece of cake that's
 
00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:53.560 align:start position:0%
another example okay but again it's
 
00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.149 align:start position:0%
another example okay but again it's
transferring

00:07:55.149 --> 00:07:55.159 align:start position:0%
transferring
 
00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
money and and then to the somebody else
 
00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
who's then getting the money
 
00:08:05.189 --> 00:08:05.199 align:start position:0%
money is Fiat cash going both ways um
 
00:08:07.029 --> 00:08:07.039 align:start position:0%
are are you familiar with the fact that
 
00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:09.800 align:start position:0%
uh the uh these payroll companies check
 
00:08:11.189 --> 00:08:11.199 align:start position:0%
companies have a problem with this
 
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
legislation are you guys aware of this
 
00:08:16.589 --> 00:08:16.599 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not aware uh as far as I know
 
00:08:18.189 --> 00:08:18.199 align:start position:0%
everyone who's seen that well the
 
00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:19.960 align:start position:0%
department hasn't received any sort of
 
00:08:22.629 --> 00:08:22.639 align:start position:0%
negative feedback on the really I'm
 
00:08:25.189 --> 00:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
shocked Peter you haven't talked to the
 
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:31.110 align:start position:0%
 
this

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
okay well then I might have to ask you
 
00:08:36.589 --> 00:08:36.599 align:start position:0%
back after you hear from these folks who
 
00:08:38.389 --> 00:08:38.399 align:start position:0%
have an issue otherwise representative
 
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:45.240 align:start position:0%
to thank you for your testimonies I I
 
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
missed the beginning of it so I
 
00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:48.360 align:start position:0%
apologize for that uh I had a question
 
00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:51.160 align:start position:0%
about the definition of monetary value
 
00:08:53.949 --> 00:08:53.959 align:start position:0%
it seems to have changed since the
 
00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:04.430 align:start position:0%
 
this

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
and I'll tell you specifically in a
 
00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:07.640 align:start position:0%
second here I'm waiting for my internet
 
00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:09.720 align:start position:0%
to boot
 
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:28.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:35.389 align:start position:0%
 
to

00:09:35.389 --> 00:09:35.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:38.360 align:start position:0%
so where is that in the bill it's in the
 
00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.990 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:53.000 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
so did you say monetary value yeah
 
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:00.040 align:start position:0%
there's a definition of monetary value
 
00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
means a medium exchange whether or not
 
00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
redeemable in
 
00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:08.360 align:start position:0%
money yeah so the old definition said uh
 
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:10.240 align:start position:0%
medium exchange medium exchange whether
 
00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
or not redeemable in currency and and
 
00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:15.240 align:start position:0%
includes convertible virtual currency
 
00:10:18.069 --> 00:10:18.079 align:start position:0%
and so that that latter part was
 
00:10:22.069 --> 00:10:22.079 align:start position:0%
dropped in money period because
 
00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
it's so when it's referred to in the
 
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
statute what do it referred to as the
 
00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:28.600 align:start position:0%
existing statute the definition of
 
00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:30.230 align:start position:0%
existing statute the definition of
monetary

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:30.240 align:start position:0%
monetary
 
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
value I'll read the whole definition
 
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:34.720 align:start position:0%
it's monetary value means a medium of
 
00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
exchange whether or not redeemable in
 
00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:39.880 align:start position:0%
currency and includes convertible
 
00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:40.910 align:start position:0%
currency and includes convertible
virtual

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
virtual
 
00:10:43.629 --> 00:10:43.639 align:start position:0%
currency and the D the new definition
 
00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
says it's a medium of exchange whether
 
00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:49.240 align:start position:0%
or not redeemable in money okay so
 
00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:51.240 align:start position:0%
that's a definition so in the statute
 
00:10:54.069 --> 00:10:54.079 align:start position:0%
does it talk about what what's I I don't
 
00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:56.600 align:start position:0%
know the the ramifications of that but I
 
00:10:58.069 --> 00:10:58.079 align:start position:0%
just thought I'd asked the question so
 
00:10:59.790 --> 00:10:59.800 align:start position:0%
so yeah so we don't know where do we
 
00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
where do we I guess I have to if I had
 
00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:05.240 align:start position:0%
my computer yeah to do a fine search all
 
00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
right when they type in monetary value
 
00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:10.079 align:start position:0%
and maybe we can deal with this in
 
00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:11.560 align:start position:0%
subcommittee but just wanted to
 
00:11:13.069 --> 00:11:13.079 align:start position:0%
definitely we could
 
00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
right that's a um thank you for the
 
00:11:18.629 --> 00:11:18.639 align:start position:0%
question I I don't want to speak out of
 
00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
turn without having a chance to look
 
00:11:22.509 --> 00:11:22.519 align:start position:0%
through it again myself but I wonder the
 
00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
model act has a um an optional article
 
00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
specifically on on cryptocurrency that
 
00:11:32.269 --> 00:11:32.279 align:start position:0%
we did not include in this bill and I
 
00:11:35.069 --> 00:11:35.079 align:start position:0%
wonder if that might be a hold over of
 
00:11:39.509 --> 00:11:39.519 align:start position:0%
um that specific article um that just
 
00:11:41.829 --> 00:11:41.839 align:start position:0%
wasn't changed but again I would have to
 
00:11:43.269 --> 00:11:43.279 align:start position:0%
look through a little bit more closely
 
00:11:45.949 --> 00:11:45.959 align:start position:0%
maybe in subcommittee to figure that out
 
00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:48.040 align:start position:0%
can I just follow for the question being
 
00:11:49.269 --> 00:11:49.279 align:start position:0%
I guess this is what you believe at this
 
00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
point but uh what you believe New
 
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:53.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has had an advantage in this
 
00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:57.160 align:start position:0%
area for since 2017 and my concern is
 
00:11:58.110 --> 00:11:58.120 align:start position:0%
that we don't want to give up that
 
00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
advantage and go back backwards so if we
 
00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:02.600 align:start position:0%
could just be careful about yep I
 
00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:03.710 align:start position:0%
could just be careful about yep I
understand

00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:03.720 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:06.200 align:start position:0%
okay okay so we will we'll address that
 
00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
in the subcommittee when this okay don't
 
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
go far thank
 
00:12:14.629 --> 00:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
you all right so Peter who did you want
 
00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:27.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:46.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:57.829 --> 00:12:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:57.839 --> 00:13:16.509 align:start position:0%
 
after

00:13:16.509 --> 00:13:16.519 align:start position:0%

much about anything which I'm not
 
00:13:45.269 --> 00:13:45.279 align:start position:0%
probably succeeding at very well at all
 
00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:47.480 align:start position:0%
myself uh but Robin knows all about the
 
00:13:49.949 --> 00:13:49.959 align:start position:0%

uh excluded uh amongst the list of those
 
00:13:58.990 --> 00:13:59.000 align:start position:0%
exclusions that are in the bill but
 
00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:01.600 align:start position:0%

many of those Regional Banks um were
 
00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:06.440 align:start position:0%
requesting a lot of information from
 
00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:09.560 align:start position:0%
those uh employers that are in your
 
00:16:12.629 --> 00:16:12.639 align:start position:0%
state those Regional payroll processors
 
00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:15.720 align:start position:0%
worked weekends and nights with those

small businesses holidays Easter Sunday
 
00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
they were working with your uh your

small employers throughout the state to
 
00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:28.160 align:start position:0%
provide them with the education that
 
00:16:30.269 --> 00:16:30.279 align:start position:0%
they need needed to be able to
 
00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:32.680 align:start position:0%
understand the law so that they could
 
00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:33.800 align:start position:0%
get those
 
00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
loans they also worked with them for all
 
00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:40.040 align:start position:0%

employees so when we were working till 8
 
00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
9:00 at night to help those
 
00:16:54.509 --> 00:16:54.519 align:start position:0%
employers the companies that we call Big
 
00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:57.160 align:start position:0%
Red and big blue were closing their
 
00:17:01.309 --> 00:17:01.319 align:start position:0%
doors at 5:00 to go home and those large
 
00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:03.560 align:start position:0%
corporations may be the only ones that
 
00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:06.760 align:start position:0%
are left to be able to serve the
 
00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:10.600 align:start position:0%
Employers in New Hampshire if this bill
 
00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
continues to pass because the regional
 
00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
payroll companies will not be able to
 
00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:18.360 align:start position:0%
afford to stay in
 
00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:23.400 align:start position:0%
business there are two major reasons for
 
00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:26.240 align:start position:0%
this 1241
 
00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
specifically act as agents
 
00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:31.190 align:start position:0%
specifically act as agents
of

00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
employers we will have extreme
 
00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:35.960 align:start position:0%
difficulty in maintaining the
 
00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
compliance that is due to the
 
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
nature that's required of this
 
00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
act and required within this act of our
 
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:49.480 align:start position:0%
Peril companies the cost of compliance
 
00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
will put many of the small Regional
 
00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
Peril providers out of
 
00:17:59.070 --> 00:17:59.080 align:start position:0%
business Peril processors by Nature
 
00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:00.200 align:start position:0%
of what we
 
00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
do act as agents of the
 
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
employers by the
 
00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
IRS there's a form that I've included in
 
00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:10.360 align:start position:0%
the packets that have just been put out
 
00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
to you called an
 
00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:17.080 align:start position:0%
8655 that IRS form designates us as an
 
00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
agent of the
 
00:18:20.789 --> 00:18:20.799 align:start position:0%
employer that
 
00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
form allows us to pay taxes on behalf of
 
00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
the employers both in this state and all
 
00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.070 align:start position:0%
the employers both in this state and all
states

00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:29.080 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:32.360 align:start position:0%
we encourage employers to look behind us
 
00:18:34.549 --> 00:18:34.559 align:start position:0%
an employer can look at their taxes
 
00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
being paid on a weekly daily monthly
 
00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:41.080 align:start position:0%
anytime they like to make sure that
 
00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
those taxes are being paid on it on
 
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.830 align:start position:0%
those taxes are being paid on it on
their

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
behalf without a Peril
 
00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:51.320 align:start position:0%
processor those Services can be made by
 
00:18:55.549 --> 00:18:55.559 align:start position:0%
an employer in many cases 10 years ago
 
00:18:57.789 --> 00:18:57.799 align:start position:0%
15 years ago without a regional payroll
 
00:18:57.799 --> 00:18:58.909 align:start position:0%
15 years ago without a regional payroll
processor

00:18:58.909 --> 00:18:58.919 align:start position:0%
processor
 
00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
because many companies don't like using
 
00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:04.280 align:start position:0%
big blue and big red they did try to do
 
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
it on their own and in many times
 
00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
employers fell behind paying their taxes
 
00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
because when they had to make a choice
 
00:19:15.029 --> 00:19:15.039 align:start position:0%
between paying a tax perhaps putting a
 
00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
new piece of equipment on the
 
00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
floor they chose the
 
00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:23.960 align:start position:0%
ladder we make sure that they take the
 
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.830 align:start position:0%
 
taxes

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:28.840 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:29.630 align:start position:0%
taxes
in

00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:29.640 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:33.400 align:start position:0%
addition to paying taxes and acting as
 
00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
an agent you should know that the bill
 
00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:40.280 align:start position:0%
requires us to
 
00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:43.559 align:start position:0%
ensure that we are complying in full
 
00:19:47.669 --> 00:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
with that act which may mean that if an
 
00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
employer has an employee in another
 
00:19:53.909 --> 00:19:53.919 align:start position:0%
state so if that
 
00:19:58.789 --> 00:19:58.799 align:start position:0%
employer opens up a branch in your state
 
00:20:00.669 --> 00:20:00.679 align:start position:0%
and we are working for an employer out
 
00:20:00.679 --> 00:20:01.549 align:start position:0%
and we are working for an employer out
of

00:20:01.549 --> 00:20:01.559 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
state we may be out of compliance
 
00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:06.520 align:start position:0%
immediately so if we're working for an
 
00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
employer in
 
00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and they hire someone in
 
00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:11.149 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and they hire someone in
New

00:20:11.149 --> 00:20:11.159 align:start position:0%
New
 
00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have to tell that employer
 
00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:15.640 align:start position:0%
we can no longer work for
 
00:20:20.549 --> 00:20:20.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
compliance we are put in a position
 
00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:26.120 align:start position:0%
where it's
 
00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:30.200 align:start position:0%
untenable so if we unless we
 
00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:33.880 align:start position:0%
immediately comply by proactively
 
00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:36.200 align:start position:0%
registering in your state for out of
 
00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
state Peril processors it's impossible
 
00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
for us to
 
00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
act the issue presents a serious concern
 
00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
for us and the csbs model law
 
00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
specifically names a Peril processor as
 
00:20:58.110 --> 00:20:58.120 align:start position:0%
a money transmitter you all just talk
 
00:20:59.870 --> 00:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
00:21:01.789 --> 00:21:01.799 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency we have where is that in
 
00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
the Bild you know so where thank you I
 
00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:07.480 align:start position:0%
can answer that sorry to cut you off but
 
00:21:12.669 --> 00:21:12.679 align:start position:0%
it help on page uh three of the bill
 
00:21:16.269 --> 00:21:16.279 align:start position:0%
line uh 26 and
 
00:21:19.269 --> 00:21:19.279 align:start position:0%
27 um under the definition of money
 
00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
transmission uh the end of line 26 says
 
00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
the term includes payroll processing
 
00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:27.880 align:start position:0%
Services okay great sorry for my thank
 
00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:31.070 align:start position:0%
Services okay great sorry for my thank
you

00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:34.149 --> 00:21:34.159 align:start position:0%
so unless we register proactively we're
 
00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
put in a position where we either have
 
00:21:39.029 --> 00:21:39.039 align:start position:0%
to terminate a client or we choose not
 
00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:40.360 align:start position:0%
to pay an
 
00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
employee neither of those are acceptable
 
00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
options for
 
00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:50.120 align:start position:0%
us another major concern for us is the
 
00:21:53.269 --> 00:21:53.279 align:start position:0%
unsurmountable cost of compliance I
 
00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
provided with uh to you a second exhibit
 
00:21:58.669 --> 00:21:58.679 align:start position:0%
exhibit B
 
00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
in exhibit B it shows you the
 
00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:04.720 align:start position:0%
costs for apparel
 
00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:09.400 align:start position:0%
processor for a CPA firm and for a
 
00:22:13.149 --> 00:22:13.159 align:start position:0%
bookkeeper because we all fall into the
 
00:22:13.159 --> 00:22:15.549 align:start position:0%
bookkeeper because we all fall into the
same

00:22:15.549 --> 00:22:15.559 align:start position:0%
same
 
00:22:20.549 --> 00:22:20.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
blue those costs show the bonding
 
00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
costs the potential cost to register not
 
00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:31.480 align:start position:0%
again just in your state because the
 
00:22:34.669 --> 00:22:34.679 align:start position:0%
csbs model legislation is being
 
00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
presented in many states and
 
00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:42.760 align:start position:0%
again with covid and the explosion of
 
00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
the remote
 
00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:47.000 align:start position:0%
workers you could have an
 
00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:49.880 align:start position:0%
employer that's not just having
 
00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
employees here in New Hampshire but
 
00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
could have an employee working for a
 
00:22:58.149 --> 00:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
company in New Hampshire but they have
 
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
an employee working in Massachusetts or
 
00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
potentially working in
 
00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
Vermont or working in another state and
 
00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:11.000 align:start position:0%
it's not clear at all in the model
 
00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
legislation who needs to be
 
00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:16.440 align:start position:0%
covered so if we have to register in
 
00:23:19.269 --> 00:23:19.279 align:start position:0%
multiple States because that company has
 
00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
employees in multiple States we have to
 
00:23:25.549 --> 00:23:25.559 align:start position:0%
register in all of those States and be
 
00:23:28.029 --> 00:23:28.039 align:start position:0%
bonded in all of those states and
 
00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
bonding is not consistent in all of
 
00:23:34.549 --> 00:23:34.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
either so that study in exhibit B shows
 
00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
what those potential costs are and I
 
00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
think it's fairly easy to see that for a
 
00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:45.880 align:start position:0%
small Peril
 
00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
processor either we would have to
 
00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
significantly increase our costs or
 
00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:53.480 align:start position:0%
close our doors for these reasons we
 
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
request that New Hampshire reconsider an
 
00:24:00.269 --> 00:24:00.279 align:start position:0%
exemption for agency payroll processors
 
00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:04.720 align:start position:0%
similar to the states of California Ohio
 
00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
North Carolina Washington and most
 
00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:09.830 align:start position:0%
North Carolina Washington and most
recently

00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
recently
 
00:24:13.029 --> 00:24:13.039 align:start position:0%
Iowa please know in closing and you'll
 
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
hear this from some of my associates
 
00:24:17.149 --> 00:24:17.159 align:start position:0%
that are right here in New
 
00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that we are required to
 
00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
provide sock audits to the banks that
 
00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:29.240 align:start position:0%
provide us with the kinds of services
 
00:24:32.149 --> 00:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
that we provide our banks which is in
 
00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
sending our a files we required to
 
00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
provide Notch
 
00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
audits we underwrite in most cases for
 
00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:45.080 align:start position:0%
our banks our clients making sure that
 
00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:47.240 align:start position:0%
they too are
 
00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:49.880 align:start position:0%
viable we have to provide personal
 
00:24:52.789 --> 00:24:52.799 align:start position:0%
financial statements to those Banks we
 
00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
do ofac reviews on those clients as
 
00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:58.669 align:start position:0%
do ofac reviews on those clients as
well

00:24:58.669 --> 00:24:58.679 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:25:02.669 --> 00:25:02.679 align:start position:0%
so we do a lot to ensure as well the
 
00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
safety of what we
 
00:25:09.149 --> 00:25:09.159 align:start position:0%
do and we do provide a consultative
 
00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:12.120 align:start position:0%
service to those clients that we provide
 
00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
services to we're asking you to take
 
00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
that all into consideration as
 
00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:19.880 align:start position:0%
well thank you and I'd be happy to
 
00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
questions and if I could add um I passed
 
00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
out a um copy of a report from the state
 
00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:31.480 align:start position:0%
of New York in uh 2022 there was similar
 
00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:33.720 align:start position:0%
legislation in New York to require the
 
00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:35.720 align:start position:0%
uh licensure registration processing
 
00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
Services um after we testify there's a
 
00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
couple local companies that will testify
 
00:25:41.789 --> 00:25:41.799 align:start position:0%
and also point out that you know when we
 
00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:43.240 align:start position:0%
think payroll processing companies we
 
00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
think of the the big the big companies
 
00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
out there the big National companies uh
 
00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:48.440 align:start position:0%
we represent the regional companies but
 
00:25:50.549 --> 00:25:50.559 align:start position:0%
a lot of small businesses use their
 
00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:52.840 align:start position:0%
local bookkeeper to help them with their
 
00:25:55.909 --> 00:25:55.919 align:start position:0%
payroll uh or the local CPA firm and uh
 
00:25:57.750 --> 00:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
so this would have put all those costs
 
00:25:59.630 --> 00:25:59.640 align:start position:0%
on them and and especially in the age of
 
00:26:00.789 --> 00:26:00.799 align:start position:0%
remote workers where you can have
 
00:26:02.669 --> 00:26:02.679 align:start position:0%
workers living all over the country uh
 
00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:04.760 align:start position:0%
it presents an untenable situation but
 
00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions uh how did
 
00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:09.240 align:start position:0%
this happen how when when they were
 
00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:11.000 align:start position:0%
building this model legislation where
 
00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:12.520 align:start position:0%
were you
 
00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
guys well I can tell you it wasn't us
 
00:26:16.669 --> 00:26:16.679 align:start position:0%
that were sitting on the advisory
 
00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
committee because if it was we wouldn't
 
00:26:22.549 --> 00:26:22.559 align:start position:0%
be sitting here today so all this time
 
00:26:23.789 --> 00:26:23.799 align:start position:0%
they were doing this and you were
 
00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
unbeknownst to you guys that that this
 
00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:28.240 align:start position:0%
was happening we we definitely came in
 
00:26:31.029 --> 00:26:31.039 align:start position:0%
after the fact
 
00:26:34.669 --> 00:26:34.679 align:start position:0%
okay okay and and we respectfully we are
 
00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
the two largest um independent
 
00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:40.840 align:start position:0%
associations representing our industry
 
00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
right it just it's just unbelievable how
 
00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:47.080 align:start position:0%
is how it's in here as not you know not
 
00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:48.520 align:start position:0%
even worry about the exemption but it's
 
00:26:50.549 --> 00:26:50.559 align:start position:0%
how they they went out of their way to
 
00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
put you in here and yet nobody called
 
00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:56.200 align:start position:0%
you up and nobody said oh by the way
 
00:26:58.350 --> 00:26:58.360 align:start position:0%
there's my my understanding was there
 
00:27:00.029 --> 00:27:00.039 align:start position:0%
was a presentation made at some point
 
00:27:01.389 --> 00:27:01.399 align:start position:0%
when model legislation was being
 
00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:03.640 align:start position:0%
developed um and the response back was
 
00:27:05.149 --> 00:27:05.159 align:start position:0%
oh that's an interesting concept we'll
 
00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
have to look into that but in the
 
00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:08.240 align:start position:0%
meantime we want to get our legislation
 
00:27:10.029 --> 00:27:10.039 align:start position:0%
through but as I indicated uh a number
 
00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:11.360 align:start position:0%
of states that have seen this model
 
00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
legislation have uh recognized the uh
 
00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
the issues here
 
00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
okay okay we do have questions represent
 
00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
spear I just want to make sure I
 
00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:25.320 align:start position:0%
understand this in the previous version
 
00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:28.520 align:start position:0%
one that this is updating
 
00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:31.360 align:start position:0%
uh you folks were not in that bill right
 
00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
and that's and the whole reason is now
 
00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
that you're folded into
 
00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
it thank you for the question
 
00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
representative my understanding is the
 
00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh current statute RSA is it 399 G I
 
00:27:45.389 --> 00:27:45.399 align:start position:0%
think uh does not uh include payroll
 
00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
processors the uh legislation before you
 
00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
specifically includes payroll processors
 
00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
got that that's what reac I I think U I
 
00:27:56.590 --> 00:27:56.600 align:start position:0%
think that my question was just answered
 
00:28:00.669 --> 00:28:00.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
okay uh any other questions from the
 
00:28:06.029 --> 00:28:06.039 align:start position:0%
committee me representa Ammon uh unless
 
00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
I missed it thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
for uh taking my question uh what's the
 
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
fix for your issue is it just to exclude
 
00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
money transmitters is that yes thank you
 
00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
for the question remove it right you got
 
00:28:19.389 --> 00:28:19.399 align:start position:0%
to you got to do two things yeah we
 
00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
specifically two things remove the
 
00:28:23.549 --> 00:28:23.559 align:start position:0%
language in that includes it and uh also
 
00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:26.360 align:start position:0%
we request a specific exclusion so that
 
00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:29.640 align:start position:0%
there's no uh question and future uh
 
00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:31.640 align:start position:0%
departments may try to interpret things
 
00:28:33.269 --> 00:28:33.279 align:start position:0%
differently and we can provide samples
 
00:28:34.789 --> 00:28:34.799 align:start position:0%
of language from the other states that
 
00:28:35.909 --> 00:28:35.919 align:start position:0%
have done
 
00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:39.880 align:start position:0%
this okay so here's The $64,000 Question
 
00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:41.029 align:start position:0%
this okay so here's The $64,000 Question
who

00:28:41.029 --> 00:28:41.039 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
regulates this
 
00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:46.760 align:start position:0%
industry so um that's a a good question
 
00:28:48.789 --> 00:28:48.799 align:start position:0%
and I know that represent hunt in my
 
00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:50.360 align:start position:0%
prior conversations with you uh
 
00:28:52.549 --> 00:28:52.559 align:start position:0%
referenced an incident that happened in
 
00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:54.360 align:start position:0%
uh prior to 2000 I think prior to the
 
00:28:57.470 --> 00:28:57.480 align:start position:0%
pandemic um a company uh a pay
 
00:29:00.029 --> 00:29:00.039 align:start position:0%
Processing Company in New York uh was
 
00:29:02.269 --> 00:29:02.279 align:start position:0%
misbehaving and caused a problem which
 
00:29:04.029 --> 00:29:04.039 align:start position:0%
affected the I think it's the Hometown
 
00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
Diner in constituent lost $20,000 yeah
 
00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:10.440 align:start position:0%
so uh and one of the issues there was so
 
00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
the um they went to send the money
 
00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
unemployment taxes and he said other
 
00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
than occasional little clerical errors
 
00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
there have not been any issues with with
 
00:29:22.269 --> 00:29:22.279 align:start position:0%
that so um I think it's it's regulated
 
00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:24.640 align:start position:0%
to the point by the IRS uh some of the
 
00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
banking trade groups that uh regulate
 
00:29:29.509 --> 00:29:29.519 align:start position:0%
you know how we can interact with them
 
00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
um as well as other various trade
 
00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
associations I don't know how I did with
 
00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
that if I could just add to that um the
 
00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:40.240 align:start position:0%
banks do require uh those of us who send
 
00:29:42.789 --> 00:29:42.799 align:start position:0%
files through the banks an a notcha
 
00:29:44.669 --> 00:29:44.679 align:start position:0%
audit we are required to do those
 
00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:47.640 align:start position:0%
annually by the end of December each
 
00:29:51.149 --> 00:29:51.159 align:start position:0%
year um so that and in New York States
 
00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh findings you'll see that they felt
 
00:29:57.750 --> 00:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
that that was uh remediation for that
 
00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:01.640 align:start position:0%
issue and in those audits it uh
 
00:30:06.549 --> 00:30:06.559 align:start position:0%
purposefully reviews um any reversals to
 
00:30:09.029 --> 00:30:09.039 align:start position:0%
Consumer accounts specifically okay did
 
00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:10.720 align:start position:0%
you just say that state that one more
 
00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
time for me because who is doing the
 
00:30:15.029 --> 00:30:15.039 align:start position:0%
auditing um so we have to have an
 
00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
outside auditor review um all
 
00:30:22.029 --> 00:30:22.039 align:start position:0%
transactions uh annually our our files
 
00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
are reviewed to determine if there are
 
00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
any reversals made um and causation so
 
00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:32.600 align:start position:0%
who's required this who made this
 
00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:35.440 align:start position:0%
requirement right it's called a nacha
 
00:30:37.389 --> 00:30:37.399 align:start position:0%
audit the notcha audit and in those
 
00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
notcha audits they were they look for
 
00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
specifically that's one of the things
 
00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
that they look for so you're registered
 
00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:47.960 align:start position:0%
with no we're required to provide it if
 
00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:50.440 align:start position:0%
we but how do they know you exist how
 
00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
what because we pass Bank files right so
 
00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:55.880 align:start position:0%
if you are putting a file into the
 
00:30:58.190 --> 00:30:58.200 align:start position:0%
banking system okay okay you are
 
00:31:00.669 --> 00:31:00.679 align:start position:0%
required so this is anybody who puts a
 
00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
bank file your bank must require you to
 
00:31:05.909 --> 00:31:05.919 align:start position:0%
provide it to the bank so we can't
 
00:31:09.669 --> 00:31:09.679 align:start position:0%
provide our we can't have a bank
 
00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:11.480 align:start position:0%
relationship you know there's certain
 
00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
things that we have to provide our bank
 
00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
every year um we actually have to
 
00:31:16.789 --> 00:31:16.799 align:start position:0%
provide our bank with things four times
 
00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:19.240 align:start position:0%
a year but one of the things annually
 
00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
that we have to provide them with is a
 
00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
notch audit if we don't provide it we
 
00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
lose our ability to send nacha files
 
00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:29.200 align:start position:0%
that be up to the bank to it's not up to
 
00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
them it's required by right but I'm
 
00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:33.080 align:start position:0%
saying if you don't send it they will
 
00:31:35.029 --> 00:31:35.039 align:start position:0%
turn us off then they would say they
 
00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:37.880 align:start position:0%
would notify the bank that the bank
 
00:31:40.509 --> 00:31:40.519 align:start position:0%
notifies us you're off so the bank so
 
00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:42.320 align:start position:0%
you are required to give this audit to
 
00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:46.720 align:start position:0%
the bank correct so if I think in terms
 
00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
of my happy homeowner or happy business
 
00:31:52.909 --> 00:31:52.919 align:start position:0%
I have QuickBooks and QuickBooks I can
 
00:31:57.310 --> 00:31:57.320 align:start position:0%
transfer uh Bank check payments and I'm
 
00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
doing that electronically so because I
 
00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:05.200 align:start position:0%
do that they can shut me off from being
 
00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
able to do that if I don't give them an
 
00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:10.440 align:start position:0%
audit you wouldn't fall under this
 
00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
because you're not a third- party sender
 
00:32:15.149 --> 00:32:15.159 align:start position:0%
we fall under that as a third-party
 
00:32:18.549 --> 00:32:18.559 align:start position:0%
sender so our relationship with the bank
 
00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:21.320 align:start position:0%
requires us to so your your connection
 
00:32:24.029 --> 00:32:24.039 align:start position:0%
to the bank would not be my federal ID
 
00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:26.240 align:start position:0%
number it would be your federal ID
 
00:32:28.669 --> 00:32:28.679 align:start position:0%
number so that's how the bank knows that
 
00:32:30.909 --> 00:32:30.919 align:start position:0%
who you are and what's the nature of
 
00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:32.840 align:start position:0%
your business and then they're the ones
 
00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:35.000 align:start position:0%
who are requiring that audit correct
 
00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:38.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you all right
 
00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:39.389 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you all right
representative

00:33:11.909 --> 00:33:11.919 align:start position:0%
that's a Trader Association doesn't that
 
00:33:13.909 --> 00:33:13.919 align:start position:0%
amount to the company's regulating
 
00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:16.200 align:start position:0%
themselves it's it's not a trade or it's
 
00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:17.960 align:start position:0%
part of the Federal
 
00:33:21.509 --> 00:33:21.519 align:start position:0%

00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:27.629 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:33:27.629 --> 00:33:27.639 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:29.720 align:start position:0%
um so I already went and had a little
 
00:33:32.789 --> 00:33:32.799 align:start position:0%
conversation with them okay and um they
 
00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
will be prepared uh theoretically um the
 
00:33:39.669 --> 00:33:39.679 align:start position:0%
bank commissioner is not here today so
 
00:33:41.909 --> 00:33:41.919 align:start position:0%
so they can't they can't tell them you
 
00:33:43.950 --> 00:33:43.960 align:start position:0%
know make a decision at this point but
 
00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:46.360 align:start position:0%
uh what we will have is when we have the
 
00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um we will hope that we'll
 
00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
have the language the amendment proper
 
00:33:53.629 --> 00:33:53.639 align:start position:0%
Amendment unless the banking Department
 
00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:55.480 align:start position:0%
can have a different opinion they can
 
00:33:57.070 --> 00:33:57.080 align:start position:0%
offer it up at the subcommittee but but
 
00:33:59.430 --> 00:33:59.440 align:start position:0%
at this point my expectation is that
 
00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:01.720 align:start position:0%
we'll have an amendment drawn to take
 
00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
care of this
 
00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:06.440 align:start position:0%
problem with that thank you uh thank you
 
00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:07.190 align:start position:0%
problem with that thank you uh thank you

Hampshire resident and my family we
 
00:35:04.589 --> 00:35:04.599 align:start position:0%
moved from Bo to hopkington in

2021 um I uh I currently serve on the
 
00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:09.240 align:start position:0%
greater conquered Chamber of Commerce
 
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
but I am here uh uh to provide testimony
 
00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
as a citizen of the state and owner of a
 
00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
payroll Processing Company and you know
 
00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
in no other um uh you know not speaking
 
00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:23.160 align:start position:0%
in any other voice here um our company
 
00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
is 100% New Hampshire based we employ
 
00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
about 20 uh well-compensated
 
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
professionals primarily in technology
 
00:35:32.589 --> 00:35:32.599 align:start position:0%
focused roles our client base is
 
00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:34.720 align:start position:0%
comprised of hundreds of employers from
 
00:35:36.589 --> 00:35:36.599 align:start position:0%
your neighborhood auto repair shops
 
00:35:38.829 --> 00:35:38.839 align:start position:0%
convenience stores Medical Professional
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
practices to larger high-tech
 
00:35:42.829 --> 00:35:42.839 align:start position:0%
manufacturing operations and the
 
00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
occasional startup with a new business
 
00:35:46.829 --> 00:35:46.839 align:start position:0%
model that quickly grows and expands
 
00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
into a multi-state employer with complex
 
00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
tax reporting needs and I think one of
 
00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:54.520 align:start position:0%
the best ways to kind of just reiterate
 
00:35:57.069 --> 00:35:57.079 align:start position:0%
like demonstrate what Robin was saying
 
00:35:59.710 --> 00:35:59.720 align:start position:0%
as far as the impact on our business and
 
00:36:02.309 --> 00:36:02.319 align:start position:0%
why you know these concerns about about
 
00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
Audits and you know regulation um well
 
00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
it might be somewhat alleviated is just
 
00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
to give you a little company history my
 
00:36:13.390 --> 00:36:13.400 align:start position:0%
father started the company in 1987 as an
 
00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:16.240 align:start position:0%
offsh or rather in '94 as an offshoot to
 
00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
his CPA firm which he had started in
 
00:36:22.589 --> 00:36:22.599 align:start position:0%
1987 um and so we originally had seven
 
00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
clients that we processed payroll for
 
00:36:27.309 --> 00:36:27.319 align:start position:0%
and over a number of years uh without
 
00:36:30.589 --> 00:36:30.599 align:start position:0%
any or you know actual real sales effort
 
00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:33.160 align:start position:0%
um we organically grew uh to a point
 
00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:35.720 align:start position:0%
where when I bought the company we were
 
00:36:38.109 --> 00:36:38.119 align:start position:0%
uh a little over a million and a half in
 
00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
annual revenue servicing about 350
 
00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
customers uh currently we are um more
 
00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
than double that I've owned the company
 
00:36:49.390 --> 00:36:49.400 align:start position:0%
since uh
 
00:36:54.190 --> 00:36:54.200 align:start position:0%
2013 um and most of our customers are
 
00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire based employers as
 
00:37:00.309 --> 00:37:00.319 align:start position:0%
Checkmate grew we evolved our company
 
00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
our customers evolved they demanded new
 
00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
things of us such as sock Audits and you
 
00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:09.160 align:start position:0%
know uh we then decided that we needed
 
00:37:13.349 --> 00:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
to have you know as our a numbers grew
 
00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
that we needed to have more control over
 
00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
the electronic transactions of our
 
00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
customers um and so we established
 
00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
Direct Banking relationships and now we
 
00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:24.920 align:start position:0%
have annual a audits that were subject
 
00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:28.040 align:start position:0%
to and sock audits that require as well
 
00:37:30.670 --> 00:37:30.680 align:start position:0%
in addition we have our own internal um
 
00:37:32.910 --> 00:37:32.920 align:start position:0%
requirements of ourselves that compel us
 
00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:35.200 align:start position:0%
to you know reconcile our bank accounts
 
00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:37.800 align:start position:0%
on a daily basis and do a number of
 
00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
other things like business continuity
 
00:37:42.309 --> 00:37:42.319 align:start position:0%
testing um that aren't you know demanded
 
00:37:44.589 --> 00:37:44.599 align:start position:0%
through regulation but are demanded
 
00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
because any reasonable business owner
 
00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:48.680 align:start position:0%
who would rely on us to manage their
 
00:37:51.349 --> 00:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
number one operating expense would you
 
00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
know want to know that these things are
 
00:37:56.430 --> 00:37:56.440 align:start position:0%
in place so the the basic gist of this
 
00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:00.040 align:start position:0%
as Robin said uh is the the burden of
 
00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:03.560 align:start position:0%
this regulation is so vast on a company
 
00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
like mine we would need to have a
 
00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
dedicated employee um just to make sure
 
00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
that we are routinely ongoing compliant
 
00:38:15.069 --> 00:38:15.079 align:start position:0%
with all of the rules and regulations
 
00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
that are laid out in this bill we would
 
00:38:19.829 --> 00:38:19.839 align:start position:0%
need to pay an additional 30 to 50K a
 
00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
year um just to get audited uh company
 
00:38:27.069 --> 00:38:27.079 align:start position:0%
financials on top of all of these other
 
00:38:30.829 --> 00:38:30.839 align:start position:0%
things that we already do and it's just
 
00:38:34.309 --> 00:38:34.319 align:start position:0%
as as as Robin was indicating New
 
00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:37.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is one of many states that are
 
00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
considering similar legislation it is
 
00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
the broader scale of this that really is
 
00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
the thing that that that is puts us all
 
00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:45.599 align:start position:0%
at risk of shutting down our businesses
 
00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
but any one state that does this um you
 
00:38:50.069 --> 00:38:50.079 align:start position:0%
know makes that a more real and present
 
00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
danger for all of us so I'm happy to
 
00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
take any questions that you might
 
00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:58.000 align:start position:0%

concentrate on their Core
 
00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
Business my father and uncle Ted gatas
 
00:40:37.150 --> 00:40:37.160 align:start position:0%
started staffing network
 
00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
1989 this was a professional employee
 
00:40:41.829 --> 00:40:41.839 align:start position:0%
organization that provided Payroll
 
00:40:44.349 --> 00:40:44.359 align:start position:0%
Services as you can see our family has

been in the payroll business in New
 
00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:48.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for 35 years at this time I
 
00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
would like to speak about the house bill
 
00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
1241 which you have before your
 
00:40:56.030 --> 00:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
committee it is our professional opinion
 
00:40:59.069 --> 00:40:59.079 align:start position:0%
that this bill as written will create a
 
00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
hardship and burden on companies like
 
00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:04.040 align:start position:0%
ours to continue servicing our clients
 
00:41:06.109 --> 00:41:06.119 align:start position:0%
and their payroll needs local
 
00:41:08.430 --> 00:41:08.440 align:start position:0%
accountants bookkeepers and payroll
 
00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:10.760 align:start position:0%
companies will find these rules raise
 
00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:12.680 align:start position:0%
their cost to the point where they will
 
00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
have no will have to consider other
 
00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
options this reill this bill requires
 
00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
triantis to provide audited
 
00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:24.800 align:start position:0%
financials we would need to hire an
 
00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
outside accounting firm to Prov provide
 
00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
this service for us this would be
 
00:41:32.109 --> 00:41:32.119 align:start position:0%
extremely costly some of the smaller
 
00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
payroll companies will have a difficult
 
00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:36.720 align:start position:0%
obtaining these statements also to
 
00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
obtain assurity bond will only add
 
00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:41.880 align:start position:0%
additional cost which will have to be
 
00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:44.440 align:start position:0%
passed to our small business clients
 
00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:47.200 align:start position:0%
doing business with us New Hampshire has
 
00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:50.760 align:start position:0%

supports local business for these
 
00:41:57.829 --> 00:41:57.839 align:start position:0%
reasons and more we are requesting that
 
00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:03.040 align:start position:0%

all right thank you Mr chair members of
the

00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:43:05.349 --> 00:43:05.359 align:start position:0%
committee uh sticking to house tradition
 
00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
I'm introducing this
 
00:43:11.109 --> 00:43:11.119 align:start position:0%
bill uh House Bill
 
00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
1559 uh repealing the chapter relative
 
00:43:17.950 --> 00:43:17.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:20.109 --> 00:43:20.119 align:start position:0%
machines and it's fortunately very
 
00:43:25.150 --> 00:43:25.160 align:start position:0%
simple bill it's repealing RSA 399 F
 
00:43:27.790 --> 00:43:27.800 align:start position:0%
relative to cash dispensing machines the
 
00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:30.280 align:start position:0%
entire RSA is
 
00:43:32.670 --> 00:43:32.680 align:start position:0%
repealed and I I won't take questions
 
00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
because I think the banking Department
 
00:43:37.589 --> 00:43:37.599 align:start position:0%
might be coming behind me so thank
 
00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:40.200 align:start position:0%
you right thank
 
00:43:43.349 --> 00:43:43.359 align:start position:0%
you nothing like a bill that has my name
 
00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
statute okay Seth saraki correct good
 
00:43:58.230 --> 00:43:58.240 align:start position:0%
morning chairman hunt members of the
 
00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:00.440 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Seth Zaraki I'm the
 
00:44:02.349 --> 00:44:02.359 align:start position:0%
general counsel at the New Hampshire
 
00:44:03.630 --> 00:44:03.640 align:start position:0%
banking department and I'm here speaking
 
00:44:06.990 --> 00:44:07.000 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the department uh HB 1559
 
00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:10.720 align:start position:0%
will repeal RSA 399 F in its entirety
 
00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
this is the chapter relative to the
 
00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:14.680 align:start position:0%
registration of non-bank cash dispensing
 
00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
machines in New Hampshire um so cash
 
00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
dispensing machines are electronic
 
00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:22.520 align:start position:0%
devices that allow consumers to debit
 
00:44:24.710 --> 00:44:24.720 align:start position:0%
their account in exchange for dispensing
 
00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:28.720 align:start position:0%
cash um they essentially look like ATMs
 
00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
but the difference is Cash dispensing
 
00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
machines are operated by businesses
 
00:44:35.349 --> 00:44:35.359 align:start position:0%
other than Banks or credit unions and
 
00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
are only capable of dispensing cash as
 
00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
opposed to conducting other transactions
 
00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:41.390 align:start position:0%
opposed to conducting other transactions
like

00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
deposits uh the New Hampshire banking
 
00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
Department currently maintains a
 
00:44:47.829 --> 00:44:47.839 align:start position:0%
registry of non-bank cash dispensing
 
00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:50.800 align:start position:0%
machines um but we support the repeal of
 
00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
this chapter for the following reasons
 
00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
first uh the repeal will result in the
 
00:44:58.150 --> 00:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
elimination of the Department's registry
 
00:44:59.589 --> 00:44:59.599 align:start position:0%
and the administrative burdens
 
00:45:01.829 --> 00:45:01.839 align:start position:0%
associated with maintaining it under
 
00:45:04.270 --> 00:45:04.280 align:start position:0%
current law the department is permitted
 
00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:07.000 align:start position:0%
to collect Annual fees of only $50 for
 
00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
new registrations and $5 for renewals
 
00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
the Department's experience is that the
 
00:45:15.190 --> 00:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
staff time and administrative costs
 
00:45:16.549 --> 00:45:16.559 align:start position:0%
associated with maintaining that
 
00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:19.480 align:start position:0%
registry considerably ex exceed any
 
00:45:22.390 --> 00:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
value in having that registry in short
 
00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
the evidence that we have shows that
 
00:45:27.870 --> 00:45:27.880 align:start position:0%
it's just not worth it um furthermore
 
00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
RSA currently it contains no enforcement
 
00:45:33.589 --> 00:45:33.599 align:start position:0%
Provisions so if there were a consumer
 
00:45:36.349 --> 00:45:36.359 align:start position:0%
issue with a cash dispensing machine the
 
00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:38.480 align:start position:0%
department has limited statutory
 
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
authority to take any meaningful action
 
00:45:44.349 --> 00:45:44.359 align:start position:0%
moreover uh the Department's records
 
00:45:47.230 --> 00:45:47.240 align:start position:0%
reflect that it has received only one
 
00:45:49.069 --> 00:45:49.079 align:start position:0%
Consumer complaint relating to a cash
 
00:45:51.349 --> 00:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
dispensing machine during the time that
 
00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
it's maintained uh this registry
 
00:45:57.589 --> 00:45:57.599 align:start position:0%
um because of the confidentiality
 
00:45:59.230 --> 00:45:59.240 align:start position:0%
protections associated with consumer
 
00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:01.000 align:start position:0%
complaints I'm limited in what I can
 
00:46:04.190 --> 00:46:04.200 align:start position:0%
disclose about that but um that one
 
00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:06.280 align:start position:0%
complaint had to be resolved uh through
 
00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
the customer's Bank rather than the
 
00:46:09.790 --> 00:46:09.800 align:start position:0%
operator this the cash dispensing
 
00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:13.240 align:start position:0%
machine anyway um following the repeal
 
00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
of the statute any consumer protection
 
00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
issues relating to cash cash dispensing
 
00:46:20.589 --> 00:46:20.599 align:start position:0%
machines will be will remain or will be
 
00:46:22.549 --> 00:46:22.559 align:start position:0%
subject to the provisions of uh the
 
00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act RSA
 
00:46:28.750 --> 00:46:28.760 align:start position:0%
358a so in some consumer uh we believe
 
00:46:30.589 --> 00:46:30.599 align:start position:0%
the repeal is appropriate at the banking
 
00:46:33.109 --> 00:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
Department um consumer protections under
 
00:46:36.069 --> 00:46:36.079 align:start position:0%
the consumer protection act will M uh M
 
00:46:38.829 --> 00:46:38.839 align:start position:0%
be intact um and it will eliminate the
 
00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
unnecessary registration and
 
00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:43.000 align:start position:0%
administrative burdens both for business
 
00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:44.800 align:start position:0%
and for state government with that I'd
 
00:46:46.630 --> 00:46:46.640 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer any
 
00:46:50.190 --> 00:46:50.200 align:start position:0%
questions okay representative Speer I I
 
00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
I read this statute and uh as it exists
 
00:46:57.750 --> 00:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
right now and
 
00:46:59.910 --> 00:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
and correct me if I'm wrong I I'm pretty
 
00:47:01.790 --> 00:47:01.800 align:start position:0%
sure in like in the third line it said
 
00:47:04.750 --> 00:47:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:07.549 --> 00:47:07.559 align:start position:0%
ATMs does this mean that ATMs are not
 
00:47:09.430 --> 00:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
regulated anymore and they can just do
 
00:47:12.549 --> 00:47:12.559 align:start position:0%
whatever they want no yes I appreciate
 
00:47:16.349 --> 00:47:16.359 align:start position:0%
the question representative um now ATMs
 
00:47:18.910 --> 00:47:18.920 align:start position:0%
um I'm well first I'm not sure what
 
00:47:20.910 --> 00:47:20.920 align:start position:0%
provision you may be referring to in in
 
00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
current law um so the definition in
 
00:47:25.069 --> 00:47:25.079 align:start position:0%
current law of a cash dispensing machine
 
00:47:27.950 --> 00:47:27.960 align:start position:0%
is an electron device that operating in
 
00:47:30.030 --> 00:47:30.040 align:start position:0%
conjunction with a processor Network
 
00:47:32.510 --> 00:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
allows a consumer to debit an account in
 
00:47:36.589 --> 00:47:36.599 align:start position:0%
exchange for dispensing cash um ATMs um
 
00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:39.640 align:start position:0%
those are defined yeah uh ATMs are are
 
00:47:40.990 --> 00:47:41.000 align:start position:0%
defined in another section of the
 
00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
banking laws in RSA 383b those will
 
00:47:47.470 --> 00:47:47.480 align:start position:0%
continue to be un regulated um under our
 
00:47:51.230 --> 00:47:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:53.589 --> 00:47:53.599 align:start position:0%
Unions right so these are these are the
 
00:47:56.549 --> 00:47:56.559 align:start position:0%
ones you see inside grocery stor
 
00:47:59.549 --> 00:47:59.559 align:start position:0%
or certain businesses who want to be
 
00:48:02.309 --> 00:48:02.319 align:start position:0%
cash only they have have them there so
 
00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
representative melier thank you chairman
 
00:48:06.870 --> 00:48:06.880 align:start position:0%
is there any limit to how much one of
 
00:48:08.870 --> 00:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
these U machines can charge for
 
00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:15.750 align:start position:0%
these U machines can charge for
dispensing

00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:23.390 --> 00:48:23.400 align:start position:0%
is no limit so long as it's dis there
 
00:48:26.109 --> 00:48:26.119 align:start position:0%
disclosed um on a signed post posted on
 
00:48:27.950 --> 00:48:27.960 align:start position:0%
the cash dispensing machine that's in
 
00:48:32.390 --> 00:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
current law 399 F4 I would say that um
 
00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:35.400 align:start position:0%
if if hypothetically there was some
 
00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
excessive fee Associated on you know on
 
00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:40.520 align:start position:0%
the machine that could F be that could
 
00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
be a violation of like an unfair and
 
00:48:44.710 --> 00:48:44.720 align:start position:0%
deceptive practice under under current
 
00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:46.520 align:start position:0%
law under 3858
 
00:48:49.150 --> 00:48:49.160 align:start position:0%
a right so let's make sure we understand
 
00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:51.839 align:start position:0%
that one okay so now because the banking
 
00:48:53.190 --> 00:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
department is no longer going to
 
00:48:55.630 --> 00:48:55.640 align:start position:0%
register these that means if you have
 
00:48:57.789 --> 00:48:57.799 align:start position:0%
have a complaint you would actually go
 
00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
to the consumer protection act the AG's
 
00:49:03.470 --> 00:49:03.480 align:start position:0%
office and there's an unfair trade
 
00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
practice okay so that that is much like
 
00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
what we did with crypto we took it away
 
00:49:11.910 --> 00:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
from the banking any registration the
 
00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
bank department has any connection to it
 
00:49:16.670 --> 00:49:16.680 align:start position:0%
so now if there's a problem it's Now
 
00:49:18.910 --> 00:49:18.920 align:start position:0%
does not fall under their jurisdiction
 
00:49:21.109 --> 00:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
it falls under the Attorney General's
 
00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
office as a consumer protection act
 
00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
representative Gibs thanks Mr chair uh
 
00:49:31.510 --> 00:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
just for clarity you mentioned um uh
 
00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
cash dispensing machines inside Grocery
 
00:49:37.549 --> 00:49:37.559 align:start position:0%
Stores um that would uh now be covered
 
00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
under the consumer protection act uh and
 
00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
not covered by the banking department
 
00:49:46.510 --> 00:49:46.520 align:start position:0%
but just for an example um uh about a
 
00:49:48.829 --> 00:49:48.839 align:start position:0%
mile from here there's a Market Basket
 
00:49:51.950 --> 00:49:51.960 align:start position:0%
grocery store on store Street and inside
 
00:49:55.069 --> 00:49:55.079 align:start position:0%
that grocery store is a Citizens Bank
 
00:49:58.390 --> 00:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
ATM M am I correct that that Citizens
 
00:50:01.150 --> 00:50:01.160 align:start position:0%
Bank ATM would still be regulated by the
 
00:50:01.160 --> 00:50:03.150 align:start position:0%
Bank ATM would still be regulated by the
banking

00:50:03.150 --> 00:50:03.160 align:start position:0%
banking
 
00:50:05.270 --> 00:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
department so yeah appreciate the
 
00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
question representative um since well
 
00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
Citizens Bank is a federally Chartered
 
00:50:12.030 --> 00:50:12.040 align:start position:0%
bank so that would be regulated by a
 
00:50:15.069 --> 00:50:15.079 align:start position:0%
Federal Banking regulator however um for
 
00:50:18.789 --> 00:50:18.799 align:start position:0%
example if there were a uh an ATM in you
 
00:50:21.309 --> 00:50:21.319 align:start position:0%
know on a street corner or in a grocery
 
00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
store that is run by a a bank or a
 
00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:26.240 align:start position:0%
credit union that is State Charter that
 
00:50:27.549 --> 00:50:27.559 align:start position:0%
is regulated by the New Hampshire
 
00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
banking Department that would continue
 
00:50:32.430 --> 00:50:32.440 align:start position:0%
to remain under our uh jurisdiction and
 
00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:35.880 align:start position:0%
Regulatory Authority thank you thank you
 
00:50:37.109 --> 00:50:37.119 align:start position:0%
okay so we all know the difference
 
00:50:42.270 --> 00:50:42.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:44.829 --> 00:50:44.839 align:start position:0%
machine uh I I would have to say I first
 
00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:47.160 align:start position:0%
kind of paid attention to years ago we
 
00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:48.640 align:start position:0%
had this bill and on the one that got it
 
00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
lowered to $5 for the renewal but uh
 
00:50:54.829 --> 00:50:54.839 align:start position:0%
then I was uh I did get a notice from my
 
00:50:58.470 --> 00:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
bank that said uh that they would um
 
00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
anytime I use an ATM let's say we
 
00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:05.160 align:start position:0%
foreign an ATM that was not my bank um
 
00:51:08.430 --> 00:51:08.440 align:start position:0%
they actually reimbursed me for the
 
00:51:11.230 --> 00:51:11.240 align:start position:0%
fee so that's why you always want to go
 
00:51:14.190 --> 00:51:14.200 align:start position:0%
to an a a real ATM a real Bank rather
 
00:51:16.750 --> 00:51:16.760 align:start position:0%
than than one of these cash dispensing
 
00:51:19.589 --> 00:51:19.599 align:start position:0%
machines and with that thank you very
 
00:51:20.789 --> 00:51:20.799 align:start position:0%
much thank
 
00:51:25.589 --> 00:51:25.599 align:start position:0%
you okay I have no other cards interest
 
00:51:25.599 --> 00:51:28.190 align:start position:0%
you okay I have no other cards interest
on

00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
1559 so I will close the public hearing
 
00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:32.630 align:start position:0%
1559 so I will close the public hearing
on

00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:32.640 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:36.720 align:start position:0%
1559 okay I don't see representative
 
00:51:38.829 --> 00:51:38.839 align:start position:0%
Spain in the room so maybe I'll need to
 
00:51:42.510 --> 00:51:42.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:45.349 --> 00:51:45.359 align:start position:0%
him oh actually not even not even time
 
00:51:47.630 --> 00:51:47.640 align:start position:0%
yet how do we catch up oh that's great
 
00:51:54.349 --> 00:51:54.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:54.359 --> 00:57:27.109 align:start position:0%
 
perfect

00:57:27.109 --> 00:57:27.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:29.109 --> 00:57:29.119 align:start position:0%
all right uh representative Spain

00:57:36.309 --> 00:57:36.319 align:start position:0%
bill good morning representative Spain
 
00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair good morning and
 
00:57:39.150 --> 00:57:39.160 align:start position:0%
members of the
 
00:57:42.990 --> 00:57:43.000 align:start position:0%
committee um I'm bringing this bill to
 
00:57:46.510 --> 00:57:46.520 align:start position:0%
you in an attempt to try to
 
00:57:48.670 --> 00:57:48.680 align:start position:0%
preliminarily address a situation that's
 
00:57:50.870 --> 00:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
becoming more and more of an issue as
 
00:57:52.710 --> 00:57:52.720 align:start position:0%
technological advances are being made
 
00:57:55.349 --> 00:57:55.359 align:start position:0%
with Vehicle Manufacturer more and more
 
00:57:57.069 --> 00:57:57.079 align:start position:0%
vehicles uh you've probably heard of the
 
00:57:59.029 --> 00:57:59.039 align:start position:0%
right to repair effort that's been going
 
00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
on in many states more and more
 
00:58:03.109 --> 00:58:03.119 align:start position:0%
manufacturers have proprietary
 
00:58:04.750 --> 00:58:04.760 align:start position:0%
technological information that they
 
00:58:06.309 --> 00:58:06.319 align:start position:0%
don't want to release because it's
 
00:58:09.549 --> 00:58:09.559 align:start position:0%
patented technology and the legality of
 
00:58:11.349 --> 00:58:11.359 align:start position:0%
forcing a company to disclose that
 
00:58:12.670 --> 00:58:12.680 align:start position:0%
information when it's patented
 
00:58:15.309 --> 00:58:15.319 align:start position:0%
technology is kind of
 
00:58:18.910 --> 00:58:18.920 align:start position:0%
nebulous and so some states have gone
 
00:58:22.029 --> 00:58:22.039 align:start position:0%
the route of forcing manufacturers to
 
00:58:24.390 --> 00:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
disclose uh proprietary systems of the
 
00:58:27.029 --> 00:58:27.039 align:start position:0%
vehicle to third party
 
00:58:29.510 --> 00:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
garages many if not all of those have
 
00:58:32.109 --> 00:58:32.119 align:start position:0%
ended up in lawsuits and litigation that
 
00:58:35.190 --> 00:58:35.200 align:start position:0%
may not yet even be settled and so I
 
00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
decided I would like to try to
 
00:58:38.829 --> 00:58:38.839 align:start position:0%
preliminarily start to address this
 
00:58:40.990 --> 00:58:41.000 align:start position:0%
problem by at least making sure that a
 
00:58:43.630 --> 00:58:43.640 align:start position:0%
buyer is able to beware as we've heard
 
00:58:45.150 --> 00:58:45.160 align:start position:0%
many times buyer
 
00:58:48.109 --> 00:58:48.119 align:start position:0%
beware so all this bill is trying to do
 
00:58:50.109 --> 00:58:50.119 align:start position:0%
is ask that when a manufacturer is
 
00:58:51.990 --> 00:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
producing a vehicle that has proprietary
 
00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:53.720 align:start position:0%
systems in it that can only be repaired
 
00:58:55.230 --> 00:58:55.240 align:start position:0%
at the dealership
 
00:58:56.990 --> 00:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
you know uh that they can't take it to
 
00:58:58.710 --> 00:58:58.720 align:start position:0%
their local garage to have repairs done
 
00:59:00.430 --> 00:59:00.440 align:start position:0%
if they buy it that it's on the window
 
00:59:01.990 --> 00:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
sticker with all the other information
 
00:59:05.029 --> 00:59:05.039 align:start position:0%
that's disclosed upon far as mileage
 
00:59:06.510 --> 00:59:06.520 align:start position:0%
goes and all those other things the
 
00:59:08.230 --> 00:59:08.240 align:start position:0%
warranty the mileage and all that it
 
00:59:10.549 --> 00:59:10.559 align:start position:0%
should also tell them hey by the way if
 
00:59:12.270 --> 00:59:12.280 align:start position:0%
you buy this you might have to go to the
 
00:59:14.309 --> 00:59:14.319 align:start position:0%
dealership to have certain parts of the
 
00:59:16.029 --> 00:59:16.039 align:start position:0%
vehicle repaired because we don't
 
00:59:17.870 --> 00:59:17.880 align:start position:0%
disclose that proprietary information to
 
00:59:21.109 --> 00:59:21.119 align:start position:0%
your local dealer or your local
 
00:59:25.870 --> 00:59:25.880 align:start position:0%
garage um I have also passed around or
 
00:59:28.710 --> 00:59:28.720 align:start position:0%
asked uh representative Pusa to pass
 
00:59:30.510 --> 00:59:30.520 align:start position:0%
around an amendment that I had drafted
 
00:59:31.910 --> 00:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
because shortly after the bill was
 
00:59:34.870 --> 00:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
drafted I was contacted by a motorcycle
 
00:59:36.390 --> 00:59:36.400 align:start position:0%
group that informed me hey by the way
 
00:59:37.990 --> 00:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
this applies to motorcycles and we don't
 
00:59:39.630 --> 00:59:39.640 align:start position:0%
have a passenger side window to stick a
 
00:59:41.470 --> 00:59:41.480 align:start position:0%
sticker on and I said Jo I didn't even
 
00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
intend it to cover those so the
 
00:59:45.430 --> 00:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
amendment simply strikes motorcycles
 
00:59:47.150 --> 00:59:47.160 align:start position:0%
from the vehicles that would require
 
00:59:49.270 --> 00:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
that you let the buyer know that they
 
00:59:52.230 --> 00:59:52.240 align:start position:0%
might have to pay $300 an hour at the uh
 
00:59:54.390 --> 00:59:54.400 align:start position:0%
for for service at a dealership instead
 
00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:55.270 align:start position:0%
for for service at a dealership instead
of

00:59:55.270 --> 00:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:59:57.589 --> 00:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
60 $70 an hour down the
 
01:00:02.750 --> 01:00:02.760 align:start position:0%
street um I am going to also say that
 
01:00:04.510 --> 01:00:04.520 align:start position:0%
the I've been in discussion with the
 
01:00:07.710 --> 01:00:07.720 align:start position:0%
chair of transportation and he is very
 
01:00:09.950 --> 01:00:09.960 align:start position:0%
keen on potentially amending this to add
 
01:00:14.470 --> 01:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
more uh stuff to it so he may be in
 
01:00:16.309 --> 01:00:16.319 align:start position:0%
contact with your subcommittee that does
 
01:00:20.190 --> 01:00:20.200 align:start position:0%
do work on this and um I'm going to find
 
01:00:22.549 --> 01:00:22.559 align:start position:0%
out if he PL I I don't see him here
 
01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
today so I guess he's not speaking on it
 
01:00:26.589 --> 01:00:26.599 align:start position:0%
today but he did have an opinion that
 
01:00:28.510 --> 01:00:28.520 align:start position:0%
there was more that could be done with
 
01:00:30.950 --> 01:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
some issues that he had and being that
 
01:00:32.430 --> 01:00:32.440 align:start position:0%
I'm not in transportation I don't know
 
01:00:33.990 --> 01:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
the technicality of what it was he was
 
01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:34.950 align:start position:0%
the technicality of what it was he was
looking

01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
looking
 
01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
at and I'm open for any questions if
 
01:00:38.190 --> 01:00:38.200 align:start position:0%
anybody has
 
01:00:41.230 --> 01:00:41.240 align:start position:0%
any you do represent Speer has a
 
01:00:43.549 --> 01:00:43.559 align:start position:0%
question I'm not going to go through my
 
01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh user manual tirade but do you mean
 
01:00:49.029 --> 01:00:49.039 align:start position:0%
when you say on the window sticker are
 
01:00:50.589 --> 01:00:50.599 align:start position:0%
you talking about that big thing that
 
01:00:52.150 --> 01:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
goes on the front window you know when
 
01:00:53.789 --> 01:00:53.799 align:start position:0%
you buy a or on a side window when you
 
01:00:55.710 --> 01:00:55.720 align:start position:0%
buy a car that L all that you don't mean
 
01:00:57.589 --> 01:00:57.599 align:start position:0%
a permanent little tiny sticker no no no
 
01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
just that W that sales sticker oh okay
 
01:01:01.910 --> 01:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:01:04.190 --> 01:01:04.200 align:start position:0%
yep and it doesn't have I had the
 
01:01:05.829 --> 01:01:05.839 align:start position:0%
question before that does it have to
 
01:01:07.390 --> 01:01:07.400 align:start position:0%
list all the components that are
 
01:01:09.510 --> 01:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
proprietary I said no this the way the
 
01:01:11.150 --> 01:01:11.160 align:start position:0%
Bill's written it just has to say this
 
01:01:13.309 --> 01:01:13.319 align:start position:0%
vehicle has proprietary repair
 
01:01:16.309 --> 01:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
information in it representative mclair
 
01:01:18.910 --> 01:01:18.920 align:start position:0%
uh thank you what's to stop being a
 
01:01:21.109 --> 01:01:21.119 align:start position:0%
automobile manufacturer from just
 
01:01:23.470 --> 01:01:23.480 align:start position:0%
declaring everything as proprietary I
 
01:01:25.150 --> 01:01:25.160 align:start position:0%
mean I I could is anybody going to
 
01:01:27.349 --> 01:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
regulate this at all I I would say no
 
01:01:28.589 --> 01:01:28.599 align:start position:0%
but it would probably behoove a
 
01:01:30.870 --> 01:01:30.880 align:start position:0%
manufacturer to to say that it's not
 
01:01:32.670 --> 01:01:32.680 align:start position:0%
proprietary so that somebody's more
 
01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
likely to buy it because I know I for
 
01:01:35.710 --> 01:01:35.720 align:start position:0%
one like to do a lot of the repairs
 
01:01:38.029 --> 01:01:38.039 align:start position:0%
myself on my Toyotas and I also uh have
 
01:01:40.309 --> 01:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
a local shop I go to and if I was going
 
01:01:43.069 --> 01:01:43.079 align:start position:0%
to go buy a new Toyota and um I had two
 
01:01:44.589 --> 01:01:44.599 align:start position:0%
choices to choose from I'd pick the one
 
01:01:45.829 --> 01:01:45.839 align:start position:0%
that I don't have to worry about going
 
01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
to the dealership every time I bring it
 
01:01:51.950 --> 01:01:51.960 align:start position:0%
in right because this is just generic
 
01:01:54.789 --> 01:01:54.799 align:start position:0%
one little sentence you're adding to the
 
01:01:58.549 --> 01:01:58.559 align:start position:0%
sticker on side of your car and um um
 
01:02:01.750 --> 01:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
the Auto Dealers Association um D met
 
01:02:03.630 --> 01:02:03.640 align:start position:0%
did call me and said that he was unable
 
01:02:07.470 --> 01:02:07.480 align:start position:0%
to make it today but uh he said the
 
01:02:10.390 --> 01:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
question he would pose to you is um of
 
01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:11.349 align:start position:0%
question he would pose to you is um of
all

01:02:11.349 --> 01:02:11.359 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
the cars that are being
 
01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
manufactured how what percentage of them
 
01:02:19.069 --> 01:02:19.079 align:start position:0%
are going to be sold here in New
 
01:02:21.549 --> 01:02:21.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and do you really think that a
 
01:02:23.950 --> 01:02:23.960 align:start position:0%
manufacturer is going to put this on
 
01:02:27.029 --> 01:02:27.039 align:start position:0%
every car that's sold just to comply
 
01:02:28.789 --> 01:02:28.799 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire law it'd be great if
 
01:02:32.870 --> 01:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:35.109 --> 01:02:35.119 align:start position:0%
anything so and if they set the set
 
01:02:36.630 --> 01:02:36.640 align:start position:0%
their computer system up that prints all
 
01:02:38.430 --> 01:02:38.440 align:start position:0%
those tags to automatically add it then
 
01:02:42.390 --> 01:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:45.910 --> 01:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
bonus question question well let me make
 
01:02:47.710 --> 01:02:47.720 align:start position:0%
sure everybody anybody else because
 
01:02:50.069 --> 01:02:50.079 align:start position:0%
you've already had a question uh so
 
01:02:51.710 --> 01:02:51.720 align:start position:0%
representative Herbert has a question
 
01:02:55.029 --> 01:02:55.039 align:start position:0%
then represent um what if any
 
01:02:58.829 --> 01:02:58.839 align:start position:0%
impact on insurance that this have it
 
01:03:00.390 --> 01:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't currently have an impact so I
 
01:03:01.910 --> 01:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
don't think that disclosing it to the
 
01:03:05.950 --> 01:03:05.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:08.789 --> 01:03:08.799 align:start position:0%
impact well if you say buyer beware
 
01:03:11.349 --> 01:03:11.359 align:start position:0%
which makes sense to me you're saying
 
01:03:14.309 --> 01:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
that if I have insurance on this car
 
01:03:16.630 --> 01:03:16.640 align:start position:0%
beware because they're not going to pick
 
01:03:17.870 --> 01:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
up I don't see how that has anything to
 
01:03:21.870 --> 01:03:21.880 align:start position:0%
do with going into the shop to have your
 
01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:22.829 align:start position:0%
do with going into the shop to have your
repairs

01:03:22.829 --> 01:03:22.839 align:start position:0%
repairs
 
01:03:26.349 --> 01:03:26.359 align:start position:0%
done I mean if I bring my vehicle in to
 
01:03:28.150 --> 01:03:28.160 align:start position:0%
get like for instance my Toyota had to
 
01:03:30.589 --> 01:03:30.599 align:start position:0%
have a a throw arm on the transmission
 
01:03:32.309 --> 01:03:32.319 align:start position:0%
replaced because the neutral switch was
 
01:03:34.309 --> 01:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
faulty and for that my local shop
 
01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
couldn't do it because they didn't have
 
01:03:37.349 --> 01:03:37.359 align:start position:0%
the right tools it's totally different
 
01:03:38.750 --> 01:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
from not being able to do it because
 
01:03:40.430 --> 01:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
they won't disclose that information to
 
01:03:42.870 --> 01:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
you and being forced to go there just so
 
01:03:45.069 --> 01:03:45.079 align:start position:0%
that they can repair something that if
 
01:03:46.710 --> 01:03:46.720 align:start position:0%
the information was provided to a local
 
01:03:50.750 --> 01:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
garage they could fix um doesn't matter
 
01:03:52.950 --> 01:03:52.960 align:start position:0%
where you go to get your vehicle fixed
 
01:03:54.789 --> 01:03:54.799 align:start position:0%
uh Insurance isn't going to cover
 
01:03:55.990 --> 01:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
something unless it's part of an
 
01:03:57.870 --> 01:03:57.880 align:start position:0%
accident or or something like that as
 
01:03:59.710 --> 01:03:59.720 align:start position:0%
far as I know I mean I don't have
 
01:04:03.390 --> 01:04:03.400 align:start position:0%
insurance cover my transmission
 
01:04:05.710 --> 01:04:05.720 align:start position:0%
issue well hopefully you won't for
 
01:04:08.349 --> 01:04:08.359 align:start position:0%
question you may inquire I just I'm I'm
 
01:04:11.230 --> 01:04:11.240 align:start position:0%
still not satisfied with the fact that
 
01:04:12.829 --> 01:04:12.839 align:start position:0%
and you can have an accident or
 
01:04:14.789 --> 01:04:14.799 align:start position:0%
something can happen and you would might
 
01:04:17.910 --> 01:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
want to take it to your local uh you
 
01:04:21.190 --> 01:04:21.200 align:start position:0%
know repair shop uh does that mean that
 
01:04:24.630 --> 01:04:24.640 align:start position:0%
if I have an insurance policy on on my
 
01:04:27.710 --> 01:04:27.720 align:start position:0%
car that says they'll pay
 
01:04:30.109 --> 01:04:30.119 align:start position:0%
for accidental stuff and all that kind
 
01:04:32.430 --> 01:04:32.440 align:start position:0%
of stuff does that mean that that might
 
01:04:35.470 --> 01:04:35.480 align:start position:0%
my my local shop can't you know the
 
01:04:37.549 --> 01:04:37.559 align:start position:0%
insurance is not going to pay for it
 
01:04:39.230 --> 01:04:39.240 align:start position:0%
from my perspective from the times that
 
01:04:41.269 --> 01:04:41.279 align:start position:0%
I've been reared or had insurance issues
 
01:04:42.789 --> 01:04:42.799 align:start position:0%
when I make a claim with my insurance
 
01:04:44.950 --> 01:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
company they ask me if I have a garage
 
01:04:47.549 --> 01:04:47.559 align:start position:0%
of preference and if I do then they deal
 
01:04:49.750 --> 01:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
with that garage and if if if they
 
01:04:51.430 --> 01:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
support that garage and if they don't
 
01:04:53.430 --> 01:04:53.440 align:start position:0%
like that garage they can offer me some
 
01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:54.789 align:start position:0%
like that garage they can offer me some
alternatives

01:04:54.789 --> 01:04:54.799 align:start position:0%
alternatives
 
01:04:56.349 --> 01:04:56.359 align:start position:0%
but uh it's usually the insurance
 
01:04:57.829 --> 01:04:57.839 align:start position:0%
company that gets involved prior to
 
01:05:00.549 --> 01:05:00.559 align:start position:0%
taking it to a garage and if they have
 
01:05:00.559 --> 01:05:01.349 align:start position:0%
taking it to a garage and if they have
their

01:05:01.349 --> 01:05:01.359 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:05:04.789 --> 01:05:04.799 align:start position:0%
Preference they make it known so if I
 
01:05:07.390 --> 01:05:07.400 align:start position:0%
could just clarify what that further
 
01:05:10.710 --> 01:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
question you may yes so if I understand
 
01:05:14.190 --> 01:05:14.200 align:start position:0%
you correctly the insurance company will
 
01:05:18.430 --> 01:05:18.440 align:start position:0%
on on a new car or a car with all the
 
01:05:20.670 --> 01:05:20.680 align:start position:0%
gadgets will say you got to go over to
 
01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:21.430 align:start position:0%
gadgets will say you got to go over to
the

01:05:21.430 --> 01:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:05:25.309 --> 01:05:25.319 align:start position:0%
dealer sometimes they do that um I have
 
01:05:28.029 --> 01:05:28.039 align:start position:0%
found that uh with the new electric
 
01:05:29.829 --> 01:05:29.839 align:start position:0%
vehicles there's very little option then
 
01:05:32.230 --> 01:05:32.240 align:start position:0%
to go to the dealer and as more and more
 
01:05:34.029 --> 01:05:34.039 align:start position:0%
technology is being rolled into the
 
01:05:35.990 --> 01:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
vehicles it's becoming more and more of
 
01:05:38.150 --> 01:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
an issue where the local guy can't fix
 
01:05:41.029 --> 01:05:41.039 align:start position:0%
things um and I as a consumer I want to
 
01:05:42.549 --> 01:05:42.559 align:start position:0%
know before I buy a vehicle whether I
 
01:05:44.829 --> 01:05:44.839 align:start position:0%
can fix it or take it to my local guy or
 
01:05:46.349 --> 01:05:46.359 align:start position:0%
whether I'm going to be stuck going to
 
01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
the dealership every time I need to have
 
01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:48.789 align:start position:0%
the dealership every time I need to have
something

01:05:48.789 --> 01:05:48.799 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:05:51.069 --> 01:05:51.079 align:start position:0%
done okay thank
 
01:05:53.510 --> 01:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
you representative Ammon oh excuse me
 
01:05:56.309 --> 01:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
representative spe here next actually I
 
01:05:57.950 --> 01:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
think my question got answered
 
01:06:00.589 --> 01:06:00.599 align:start position:0%
inadvertently by answering that question
 
01:06:03.109 --> 01:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
representative Ammon thank you Mr chair
 
01:06:04.630 --> 01:06:04.640 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Spain for
 
01:06:07.349 --> 01:06:07.359 align:start position:0%
taking our questions um so I'm trying to
 
01:06:10.470 --> 01:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
understand the bill uh reading it here
 
01:06:13.349 --> 01:06:13.359 align:start position:0%
um there's a definition of used motor
 
01:06:15.789 --> 01:06:15.799 align:start position:0%
vehicle uh that's used in the definition
 
01:06:19.990 --> 01:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
of dealer and so uh my first question
 
01:06:22.589 --> 01:06:22.599 align:start position:0%
would be does this apply to used
 
01:06:25.750 --> 01:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
vehicles as well as new no it was only
 
01:06:28.750 --> 01:06:28.760 align:start position:0%
meant to you to deal with new
 
01:06:35.510 --> 01:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:37.990 --> 01:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
see the definition of dealer includes
 
01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.230 align:start position:0%
see the definition of dealer includes
used

01:06:40.230 --> 01:06:40.240 align:start position:0%
used
 
01:06:42.190 --> 01:06:42.200 align:start position:0%
vehicles and it states that the
 
01:06:44.990 --> 01:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
manufacturer has a responsibility right
 
01:06:46.630 --> 01:06:46.640 align:start position:0%
and that's why it wasn't meant to deal
 
01:06:48.230 --> 01:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
with used vehicles it was only supposed
 
01:06:49.870 --> 01:06:49.880 align:start position:0%
to be applying to new vehicles and I
 
01:06:52.069 --> 01:06:52.079 align:start position:0%
appreciate that catch uh as I said I
 
01:06:53.470 --> 01:06:53.480 align:start position:0%
already have an amendment for taking the
 
01:06:56.829 --> 01:06:56.839 align:start position:0%
motorcycle part out and uh I would
 
01:06:58.269 --> 01:06:58.279 align:start position:0%
certainly welcome an amendment to take
 
01:06:59.710 --> 01:06:59.720 align:start position:0%
the used vehicle portion out because
 
01:07:01.269 --> 01:07:01.279 align:start position:0%
this was only meant to to deal with
 
01:07:03.150 --> 01:07:03.160 align:start position:0%
brand new vehicles further question you
 
01:07:05.789 --> 01:07:05.799 align:start position:0%
may inquire thank you um and then my my
 
01:07:09.349 --> 01:07:09.359 align:start position:0%
SEC my my last question is uh at the end
 
01:07:11.109 --> 01:07:11.119 align:start position:0%
I don't have line number but it's in the
 
01:07:13.630 --> 01:07:13.640 align:start position:0%
Roman Nal 2 repair notice
 
01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
required there's it talks
 
01:07:20.710 --> 01:07:20.720 align:start position:0%
about uh so the the sticker legibly
 
01:07:22.589 --> 01:07:22.599 align:start position:0%
States if the motor vehicle will require
 
01:07:24.670 --> 01:07:24.680 align:start position:0%
any repairs that can only be made at a
 
01:07:27.549 --> 01:07:27.559 align:start position:0%
dealership and lists any vehicle parts
 
01:07:30.870 --> 01:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
that contain proprietary information so
 
01:07:32.870 --> 01:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
um to me that means that there'll be a
 
01:07:35.269 --> 01:07:35.279 align:start position:0%
list of parts and that which could be
 
01:07:37.349 --> 01:07:37.359 align:start position:0%
quite extensive and then the definition
 
01:07:39.710 --> 01:07:39.720 align:start position:0%
of proprietary information a lot of
 
01:07:41.269 --> 01:07:41.279 align:start position:0%
those parts might have patents on them
 
01:07:44.710 --> 01:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
that might be considered proprietary so
 
01:07:48.150 --> 01:07:48.160 align:start position:0%
I get what you're saying um the it
 
01:07:50.269 --> 01:07:50.279 align:start position:0%
should have said subsystems I suppose
 
01:07:53.390 --> 01:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
because it should have basically had
 
01:07:55.029 --> 01:07:55.039 align:start position:0%
what what were looking for them to list
 
01:07:58.549 --> 01:07:58.559 align:start position:0%
is the computer module the
 
01:08:02.150 --> 01:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
transmission emission system generically
 
01:08:04.510 --> 01:08:04.520 align:start position:0%
parts of the vehicles not the actual
 
01:08:06.029 --> 01:08:06.039 align:start position:0%
individual Parts on the vehicle that
 
01:08:06.870 --> 01:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:08:08.990 --> 01:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
ridiculous um we just wanted people to
 
01:08:12.109 --> 01:08:12.119 align:start position:0%
know that you know uh this vehicle has
 
01:08:14.230 --> 01:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
proprietary uh systems that may need
 
01:08:18.070 --> 01:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
repair in the transmission if if such
 
01:08:19.189 --> 01:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
happens to it you have to go to the
 
01:08:21.990 --> 01:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
dealership or in the computer module
 
01:08:25.070 --> 01:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
that drive drives the engine um that way
 
01:08:27.390 --> 01:08:27.400 align:start position:0%
you know that you know I only have these
 
01:08:28.590 --> 01:08:28.600 align:start position:0%
couple of things I got to worry about
 
01:08:30.910 --> 01:08:30.920 align:start position:0%
when you buy it you don't have to think
 
01:08:32.789 --> 01:08:32.799 align:start position:0%
that every single part if you need new
 
01:08:34.669 --> 01:08:34.679 align:start position:0%
tires you don't have to go to the dealer
 
01:08:36.189 --> 01:08:36.199 align:start position:0%
we wanted to make it a little clearer to
 
01:08:37.709 --> 01:08:37.719 align:start position:0%
the to the buyer what they're getting
 
01:08:39.269 --> 01:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
into when they purchase the
 
01:08:41.990 --> 01:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
vehicle well now you got me
 
01:08:44.189 --> 01:08:44.199 align:start position:0%
confused because this is a generic
 
01:08:47.550 --> 01:08:47.560 align:start position:0%
statement saying by the way there's some
 
01:08:49.789 --> 01:08:49.799 align:start position:0%
something's in here that's proprietary
 
01:08:51.990 --> 01:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
and we're not going to tell you what it
 
01:08:54.390 --> 01:08:54.400 align:start position:0%
is because we're not required to under
 
01:08:56.669 --> 01:08:56.679 align:start position:0%
statute we all required to tell you is
 
01:08:58.990 --> 01:08:59.000 align:start position:0%
by the way there's something proprietary
 
01:09:01.789 --> 01:09:01.799 align:start position:0%
right that was the intent and they they
 
01:09:06.470 --> 01:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:09.630 --> 01:09:09.640 align:start position:0%
um oh and list the vehicle parts that
 
01:09:10.829 --> 01:09:10.839 align:start position:0%
and that wasn't that wasn't supposed to
 
01:09:13.189 --> 01:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
be what it said so that's supposed to be
 
01:09:14.510 --> 01:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
you want to amend that out also that
 
01:09:18.030 --> 01:09:18.040 align:start position:0%
should also be amended out okay so after
 
01:09:20.030 --> 01:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
we've done all these amendments and
 
01:09:21.829 --> 01:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
going to bring it down to this very
 
01:09:24.110 --> 01:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
simple concept very simple concept yes
 
01:09:27.630 --> 01:09:27.640 align:start position:0%
so is there actually any new car being
 
01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:28.870 align:start position:0%
so is there actually any new car being
produced

01:09:28.870 --> 01:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
produced
 
01:09:31.829 --> 01:09:31.839 align:start position:0%
today that does not have something
 
01:09:33.669 --> 01:09:33.679 align:start position:0%
proprietary in
 
01:09:37.829 --> 01:09:37.839 align:start position:0%
it I can't answer that would you think
 
01:09:47.110 --> 01:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:49.749 --> 01:09:49.759 align:start position:0%
true well I can tell you that that the
 
01:09:51.510 --> 01:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
guy that fixes my stuff down the road is
 
01:09:53.870 --> 01:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
a Jeep uh guy but he's not a Jeep Jeep
 
01:09:55.830 --> 01:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
dealer and he can fix even the brand new
 
01:09:58.470 --> 01:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
jeeps he right right he can get the
 
01:10:00.110 --> 01:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
parts for them but there's no
 
01:10:02.189 --> 01:10:02.199 align:start position:0%
proprietary information that that uh he
 
01:10:05.110 --> 01:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
has to that has to send the Jeep deal
 
01:10:07.950 --> 01:10:07.960 align:start position:0%
for so what you just described is that
 
01:10:11.350 --> 01:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
the issue here is me notwithstanding the
 
01:10:13.550 --> 01:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
owner's manual which I don't think you
 
01:10:18.110 --> 01:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
have to go beyond page two that will say
 
01:10:20.310 --> 01:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
if you will have any problems with your
 
01:10:22.790 --> 01:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
car for warranty repair please bring it
 
01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
back to your dealer but that's warranty
 
01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
repair I understand that but so we're
 
01:10:28.669 --> 01:10:28.679 align:start position:0%
right out of the block the consumer is
 
01:10:31.950 --> 01:10:31.960 align:start position:0%
being informed that yes you you you're
 
01:10:34.709 --> 01:10:34.719 align:start position:0%
going to need to bring this to a dealer
 
01:10:36.910 --> 01:10:36.920 align:start position:0%
but what you just pointed out is that
 
01:10:40.149 --> 01:10:40.159 align:start position:0%
there are uh Ser other service centers
 
01:10:42.149 --> 01:10:42.159 align:start position:0%
that can repair because they can get the
 
01:10:44.550 --> 01:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
parts you know but they can't get the te
 
01:10:46.830 --> 01:10:46.840 align:start position:0%
the information or technology for some
 
01:10:48.510 --> 01:10:48.520 align:start position:0%
of the proprietary systems which is what
 
01:10:50.310 --> 01:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
we're trying to inform the the buyer
 
01:10:54.630 --> 01:10:54.640 align:start position:0%
about but then the caveat M tour here
 
01:10:57.630 --> 01:10:57.640 align:start position:0%
how can you be buy or beware don't know
 
01:11:00.870 --> 01:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
before you buy it I would venture to say
 
01:11:04.830 --> 01:11:04.840 align:start position:0%
every consumer there is nobody who buys
 
01:11:08.430 --> 01:11:08.440 align:start position:0%
a new car and doesn't already know that
 
01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
there's something proprietary in that
 
01:11:13.390 --> 01:11:13.400 align:start position:0%
new car with due respect Mr chairman we
 
01:11:14.910 --> 01:11:14.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be having so many battles in
 
01:11:16.950 --> 01:11:16.960 align:start position:0%
other states about forcing people to
 
01:11:20.149 --> 01:11:20.159 align:start position:0%
release that proprietary information if
 
01:11:21.510 --> 01:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
people weren't buying the vehicle and
 
01:11:23.270 --> 01:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
then finding out later oh crap I've got
 
01:11:25.430 --> 01:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
to go to the dealership and pay $300 an
 
01:11:28.270 --> 01:11:28.280 align:start position:0%
hour for the labor every single time I'm
 
01:11:29.950 --> 01:11:29.960 align:start position:0%
glad you brought that up Okay so we've
 
01:11:31.950 --> 01:11:31.960 align:start position:0%
had that legislation in this
 
01:11:35.669 --> 01:11:35.679 align:start position:0%
committee and we are acutely aware of
 
01:11:39.189 --> 01:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
the issues in that sense that it was uh
 
01:11:40.830 --> 01:11:40.840 align:start position:0%
a Massachusetts they actually did a
 
01:11:42.910 --> 01:11:42.920 align:start position:0%
citizen referendum so they do that down
 
01:11:44.830 --> 01:11:44.840 align:start position:0%
there and they actually passed a
 
01:11:47.110 --> 01:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
referendum that they had to uh have the
 
01:11:48.910 --> 01:11:48.920 align:start position:0%
proprietary information made to auto
 
01:11:51.470 --> 01:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
dealers um since then there was a
 
01:11:54.750 --> 01:11:54.760 align:start position:0%
negotiated compromise and then now you
 
01:11:57.430 --> 01:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
know the dust is settled um but I just
 
01:12:01.709 --> 01:12:01.719 align:start position:0%
heard because I the news and I think it
 
01:12:04.470 --> 01:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
was public radio uh but I because that's
 
01:12:06.709 --> 01:12:06.719 align:start position:0%
who I used into most but it was it was
 
01:12:10.189 --> 01:12:10.199 align:start position:0%
the big issue was John Deer right and I
 
01:12:12.510 --> 01:12:12.520 align:start position:0%
don't see yeah Henry's not here today
 
01:12:15.470 --> 01:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
but uh John Deere and the issue was
 
01:12:18.510 --> 01:12:18.520 align:start position:0%
these these half a million dollar
 
01:12:22.790 --> 01:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
tractors and The Story Goes On about how
 
01:12:25.669 --> 01:12:25.679 align:start position:0%
that uh he that it turns out what all it
 
01:12:27.270 --> 01:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
needed to be part all it needed to be
 
01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
fixed was a wire needed to be plugged
 
01:12:30.669 --> 01:12:30.679 align:start position:0%
back in or something just the wire fell
 
01:12:34.149 --> 01:12:34.159 align:start position:0%
out and he was upset that he had to call
 
01:12:36.270 --> 01:12:36.280 align:start position:0%
the John Deere guy to come all the way
 
01:12:39.390 --> 01:12:39.400 align:start position:0%
out to fix his his half a million dollar
 
01:12:41.070 --> 01:12:41.080 align:start position:0%
thing to find out that it was just a
 
01:12:45.229 --> 01:12:45.239 align:start position:0%
loose wire and that um and then
 
01:12:48.270 --> 01:12:48.280 align:start position:0%
and he had to pay several hundred
 
01:12:50.709 --> 01:12:50.719 align:start position:0%
dollars for travel time for that guy to
 
01:12:53.590 --> 01:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
come out and do it so we are certainly
 
01:12:56.270 --> 01:12:56.280 align:start position:0%
aware of this right to
 
01:12:58.950 --> 01:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
repair concept and I certainly
 
01:13:00.950 --> 01:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate that you certainly are are
 
01:13:04.470 --> 01:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
trying to at least let consumers know
 
01:13:08.070 --> 01:13:08.080 align:start position:0%
that it's going on but I would I am have
 
01:13:11.149 --> 01:13:11.159 align:start position:0%
to admit you me frankly is that the
 
01:13:12.990 --> 01:13:13.000 align:start position:0%
owner's manuals tells you so they might
 
01:13:15.070 --> 01:13:15.080 align:start position:0%
just put in the manual put on your
 
01:13:16.750 --> 01:13:16.760 align:start position:0%
screen there please read the owner
 
01:13:18.870 --> 01:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
manuals for all our our
 
01:13:20.790 --> 01:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
notices okay and think they're in
 
01:13:22.830 --> 01:13:22.840 align:start position:0%
compliance with your statue which might
 
01:13:24.910 --> 01:13:24.920 align:start position:0%
be a good thing thing to force you to
 
01:13:26.510 --> 01:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
read your manual which you should have
 
01:13:28.390 --> 01:13:28.400 align:start position:0%
read in the first place to find out that
 
01:13:29.870 --> 01:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
there's proprietary I wouldn't think
 
01:13:32.709 --> 01:13:32.719 align:start position:0%
that that was a bad thing at all um and
 
01:13:34.470 --> 01:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
I appreciate your open mind on it and
 
01:13:35.910 --> 01:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
the fact that I'm just trying to at
 
01:13:37.550 --> 01:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
least get the consumers to have some
 
01:13:39.870 --> 01:13:39.880 align:start position:0%
level of awareness before they purchase
 
01:13:44.350 --> 01:13:44.360 align:start position:0%
fair enough okay now representative
 
01:13:46.950 --> 01:13:46.960 align:start position:0%
spe one of the proprietary things with
 
01:13:50.950 --> 01:13:50.960 align:start position:0%
an automobile is the um repair codes and
 
01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
the uh the codes that indicate what what
 
01:13:55.310 --> 01:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
the proc problems are and they're very
 
01:13:58.070 --> 01:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
detailed and they usually require a
 
01:14:00.310 --> 01:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
little device to interpret those codes
 
01:14:02.149 --> 01:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
to download codes and to and to
 
01:14:04.510 --> 01:14:04.520 align:start position:0%
interpret those codes a lot of these
 
01:14:06.430 --> 01:14:06.440 align:start position:0%
repair places that
 
01:14:08.750 --> 01:14:08.760 align:start position:0%
are less
 
01:14:12.430 --> 01:14:12.440 align:start position:0%
than I don't know efficient don't have
 
01:14:14.510 --> 01:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
those things and so to repair something
 
01:14:16.910 --> 01:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
is is a black box to them and they just
 
01:14:19.870 --> 01:14:19.880 align:start position:0%
swap things out and they swap things out
 
01:14:21.950 --> 01:14:21.960 align:start position:0%
if they have those devices and if
 
01:14:24.110 --> 01:14:24.120 align:start position:0%
they're allowed to get those codes their
 
01:14:27.110 --> 01:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
repair goes much more smoothly are we
 
01:14:30.350 --> 01:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
talking about things like
 
01:14:33.750 --> 01:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
that if there are systems that kick that
 
01:14:36.030 --> 01:14:36.040 align:start position:0%
that require even if he had a code
 
01:14:39.070 --> 01:14:39.080 align:start position:0%
reader and could get the the code the
 
01:14:40.709 --> 01:14:40.719 align:start position:0%
right way and and I've got to say
 
01:14:43.229 --> 01:14:43.239 align:start position:0%
they're very common I've got one myself
 
01:14:44.510 --> 01:14:44.520 align:start position:0%
but what happens is the one at the
 
01:14:46.550 --> 01:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
dealership will give them several suble
 
01:14:49.149 --> 01:14:49.159 align:start position:0%
levels of detailed information that the
 
01:14:51.110 --> 01:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
generic one will will only give them a
 
01:14:55.830 --> 01:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
ballpark okay and and sometimes the
 
01:14:58.189 --> 01:14:58.199 align:start position:0%
depth of those codes the depth of them
 
01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
is not revealed because it may contain
 
01:15:04.270 --> 01:15:04.280 align:start position:0%
proprietary information about subsystems
 
01:15:06.070 --> 01:15:06.080 align:start position:0%
that would allow a competitor to get an
 
01:15:08.070 --> 01:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
advantage and it's just like any other
 
01:15:09.030 --> 01:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
company where you want to keep your
 
01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
Trade Secrets uh for as long as you can
 
01:15:14.030 --> 01:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
so that you can have uh benefit in the
 
01:15:15.870 --> 01:15:15.880 align:start position:0%
market and I don't look down on any
 
01:15:18.669 --> 01:15:18.679 align:start position:0%
company wanting to do that however uh
 
01:15:20.470 --> 01:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
the consumer needs to know that that's
 
01:15:22.390 --> 01:15:22.400 align:start position:0%
what they're getting into so it's not
 
01:15:23.709 --> 01:15:23.719 align:start position:0%
the codes themselves
 
01:15:26.590 --> 01:15:26.600 align:start position:0%
it would be the system but I can see
 
01:15:28.229 --> 01:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
where you're getting at with the reader
 
01:15:30.470 --> 01:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
question but it's it's more in depth
 
01:15:34.030 --> 01:15:34.040 align:start position:0%
than that and I further question inquire
 
01:15:36.350 --> 01:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
or would you believe
 
01:15:39.550 --> 01:15:39.560 align:start position:0%
it's maybe it's a would you
 
01:15:41.390 --> 01:15:41.400 align:start position:0%
believe fair
 
01:15:43.950 --> 01:15:43.960 align:start position:0%
enough I had to
 
01:15:48.350 --> 01:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
design a reader system for an MP for the
 
01:15:51.830 --> 01:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
Army and it turns out you can buy the
 
01:15:54.590 --> 01:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
manuals that give give you that indepth
 
01:15:56.950 --> 01:15:56.960 align:start position:0%
detail right down to the nitty-gritty if
 
01:16:00.590 --> 01:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
you take your time to go get it it's not
 
01:16:02.990 --> 01:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
that it's hidden you have to go find it
 
01:16:05.350 --> 01:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
and and so I'm
 
01:16:07.470 --> 01:16:07.480 align:start position:0%
questioning I I I've just dealt with so
 
01:16:08.870 --> 01:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
many dealers over the years that just
 
01:16:11.189 --> 01:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
don't take the effort to do it you know
 
01:16:13.030 --> 01:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
if the reader gives it to me then I'm
 
01:16:14.629 --> 01:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
I'm good if I have to go search for
 
01:16:16.870 --> 01:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
anything I'm not going to be
 
01:16:19.510 --> 01:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
bothered so are we trying to correct for
 
01:16:21.950 --> 01:16:21.960 align:start position:0%
people being lazy I'm not clear that
 
01:16:24.470 --> 01:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be the intent no
 
01:16:26.350 --> 01:16:26.360 align:start position:0%
would you
 
01:16:29.870 --> 01:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
believe okay representative Gibbs thank
 
01:16:32.350 --> 01:16:32.360 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair uh in reference to the
 
01:16:35.110 --> 01:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
previous question aren't you talking
 
01:16:39.229 --> 01:16:39.239 align:start position:0%
about uh proprietary information that
 
01:16:42.590 --> 01:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
the uh repair shop down the street can't
 
01:16:44.950 --> 01:16:44.960 align:start position:0%
get hold of because the company will not
 
01:16:50.430 --> 01:16:50.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:54.229 --> 01:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
correct okay we all set
 
01:16:57.110 --> 01:16:57.120 align:start position:0%

oppose the bill um not going to read
 
01:17:49.270 --> 01:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
testimony I submitted written testimony
 
01:17:53.229 --> 01:17:53.239 align:start position:0%
yesterday to you all um there was a a
 
01:17:55.510 --> 01:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
memorandum understanding reached in July
 
01:17:58.270 --> 01:17:58.280 align:start position:0%
of 2023 with the Automotive Service
 
01:18:00.070 --> 01:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
Association and the society for
 
01:18:01.950 --> 01:18:01.960 align:start position:0%
collision repair specialist when it
 
01:18:05.470 --> 01:18:05.480 align:start position:0%
comes to rer repair um and it it states
 
01:18:07.110 --> 01:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
on inly that independent repair
 
01:18:09.790 --> 01:18:09.800 align:start position:0%
facilities shall have access to the same
 
01:18:11.510 --> 01:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
Diagnostic and repair information that
 
01:18:13.229 --> 01:18:13.239 align:start position:0%
autom manufacturers make available to
 
01:18:15.669 --> 01:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
authorize dealer networks so we see this
 
01:18:18.910 --> 01:18:18.920 align:start position:0%
bill as just unnecessary I guess and
 
01:18:21.629 --> 01:18:21.639 align:start position:0%
there are over 30,000 Parts um in an
 
01:18:24.270 --> 01:18:24.280 align:start position:0%
automobile you know between software
 
01:18:26.310 --> 01:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
hardware and just the physical parts
 
01:18:28.629 --> 01:18:28.639 align:start position:0%
themselves so trying to label those you
 
01:18:30.870 --> 01:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
know much of it is proprietary so I
 
01:18:32.669 --> 01:18:32.679 align:start position:0%
think that would be kind of difficult to
 
01:18:36.070 --> 01:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
uh delineate all those individual parts
 
01:18:38.070 --> 01:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
and uh what they may mean now that does
 
01:18:40.510 --> 01:18:40.520 align:start position:0%
not mean that you know aftermarket parts
 
01:18:43.030 --> 01:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
can't be used in repair they can it just
 
01:18:44.550 --> 01:18:44.560 align:start position:0%
means that the information is
 
01:18:47.270 --> 01:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
proprietary um and I'm not sure how we
 
01:18:49.709 --> 01:18:49.719 align:start position:0%
would resolve that issue so I just
 
01:18:52.590 --> 01:18:52.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify those those few things
 
01:18:54.110 --> 01:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
again we we did submit written testimony
 
01:18:55.470 --> 01:18:55.480 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to answer any questions
 
01:18:59.550 --> 01:18:59.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:02.790 --> 01:19:02.800 align:start position:0%
sponsor represent Ammon has a question
 
01:19:04.910 --> 01:19:04.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mark for coming and testifying
 
01:19:07.510 --> 01:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
um is there a I I have a question
 
01:19:11.270 --> 01:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
industry n clature so first question uh
 
01:19:14.470 --> 01:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
is there an industry term for like a sub
 
01:19:16.430 --> 01:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
assembly representative splain was
 
01:19:18.790 --> 01:19:18.800 align:start position:0%
talking about the transmission versus
 
01:19:21.669 --> 01:19:21.679 align:start position:0%
the drivetrain versus you know the
 
01:19:23.709 --> 01:19:23.719 align:start position:0%
exhaust system is there
 
01:19:25.669 --> 01:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
I don't know but I I don't know but I'll
 
01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
ask and try to get that answer for you
 
01:19:29.270 --> 01:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
all right and then
 
01:19:32.149 --> 01:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
um the second question was is there a
 
01:19:35.229 --> 01:19:35.239 align:start position:0%
term for a part that can only be
 
01:19:38.270 --> 01:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
repaired by the dealership is there
 
01:19:40.070 --> 01:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
because proprietary seems to me to be
 
01:19:42.910 --> 01:19:42.920 align:start position:0%
too broad of a term is there a term that
 
01:19:44.790 --> 01:19:44.800 align:start position:0%
applies just to a part that you need to
 
01:19:46.550 --> 01:19:46.560 align:start position:0%
go to the dealership to get it fixed I
 
01:19:47.830 --> 01:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
guess I'll answer that question by
 
01:19:49.990 --> 01:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
saying you know in our testimony and my
 
01:19:53.070 --> 01:19:53.080 align:start position:0%
discussions with representatives from
 
01:19:54.590 --> 01:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
from the auto Alli from the Auto
 
01:19:57.229 --> 01:19:57.239 align:start position:0%
Alliance the auto innovators excuse me
 
01:20:00.629 --> 01:20:00.639 align:start position:0%
to their knowledge there is no repair
 
01:20:03.550 --> 01:20:03.560 align:start position:0%
that requires a vehicle to be repaired
 
01:20:06.430 --> 01:20:06.440 align:start position:0%
at a dealership if that makes sense I
 
01:20:07.950 --> 01:20:07.960 align:start position:0%
hope that I hope that answers your
 
01:20:10.229 --> 01:20:10.239 align:start position:0%
question I I don't know if it does
 
01:20:12.709 --> 01:20:12.719 align:start position:0%
but I
 
01:20:16.550 --> 01:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
can if you want to yeah can I for the
 
01:20:19.310 --> 01:20:19.320 align:start position:0%
for the question on that yeah that's
 
01:20:20.470 --> 01:20:20.480 align:start position:0%
kind of where I'm going is how do we
 
01:20:24.709 --> 01:20:24.719 align:start position:0%
Define it in law right um so a dealeron
 
01:20:27.030 --> 01:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
repairable part whatever the term is for
 
01:20:29.070 --> 01:20:29.080 align:start position:0%
that I guess there's two two ways it
 
01:20:30.750 --> 01:20:30.760 align:start position:0%
could be dealer two ways that I can
 
01:20:32.950 --> 01:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
think of right now um one is the
 
01:20:35.629 --> 01:20:35.639 align:start position:0%
diagnostic information might not or the
 
01:20:38.830 --> 01:20:38.840 align:start position:0%
the diagnostic tools or you know the
 
01:20:41.310 --> 01:20:41.320 align:start position:0%
particular comp computerized device that
 
01:20:42.709 --> 01:20:42.719 align:start position:0%
tells you what's wrong with
 
01:20:45.070 --> 01:20:45.080 align:start position:0%
itb2 well right that's that's an
 
01:20:46.950 --> 01:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
industry standard that's one way and
 
01:20:49.030 --> 01:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
then the other way would be um you know
 
01:20:51.669 --> 01:20:51.679 align:start position:0%
if there's a a code or an encryption key
 
01:20:53.709 --> 01:20:53.719 align:start position:0%
that you need to in order to install say
 
01:20:56.430 --> 01:20:56.440 align:start position:0%
a software chip or something I believe
 
01:20:58.430 --> 01:20:58.440 align:start position:0%
this me this memorandum addressed that
 
01:21:00.950 --> 01:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
issue like independent repair shops do
 
01:21:03.510 --> 01:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
have availability that that information
 
01:21:04.830 --> 01:21:04.840 align:start position:0%
available they may choose not to
 
01:21:07.229 --> 01:21:07.239 align:start position:0%
purchase it um and they may choose not
 
01:21:09.110 --> 01:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
to purchase a certain tool you know
 
01:21:10.990 --> 01:21:11.000 align:start position:0%
that's necessary to make a certain
 
01:21:14.070 --> 01:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
repair but the information is available
 
01:21:16.430 --> 01:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
to them right
 
01:21:19.310 --> 01:21:19.320 align:start position:0%
now okay so that I'm focusing right on
 
01:21:22.110 --> 01:21:22.120 align:start position:0%
line 19 which says any repairs that can
 
01:21:24.709 --> 01:21:24.719 align:start position:0%
only be made out of
 
01:21:26.830 --> 01:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
dealership that you're saying is that
 
01:21:29.310 --> 01:21:29.320 align:start position:0%
that contention is then if that's what's
 
01:21:32.189 --> 01:21:32.199 align:start position:0%
left in the statute then this you're not
 
01:21:33.270 --> 01:21:33.280 align:start position:0%
going to you're not going to put this
 
01:21:34.669 --> 01:21:34.679 align:start position:0%
Ticker on because as far as you're
 
01:21:36.270 --> 01:21:36.280 align:start position:0%
concerned anything can be repaired
 
01:21:38.870 --> 01:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
somewhere else correct yeah I I guess
 
01:21:40.149 --> 01:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
that would be the answer to that
 
01:21:43.149 --> 01:21:43.159 align:start position:0%
question okay thank you very much I'll
 
01:21:45.189 --> 01:21:45.199 align:start position:0%
fill the pin card thank you all right
 
01:21:47.870 --> 01:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
any oh representative txon has a
 
01:21:50.709 --> 01:21:50.719 align:start position:0%
question I'm sorry I I have a would you
 
01:21:53.870 --> 01:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
believe yeah email so
 
01:21:57.030 --> 01:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
so I I'm I own a 1923
 
01:22:01.030 --> 01:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
Franklin and in on the firewall between
 
01:22:03.550 --> 01:22:03.560 align:start position:0%
the engine and the front of the car it
 
01:22:05.750 --> 01:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
says manufactured by the HH Franklin
 
01:22:07.510 --> 01:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
Manufacturing Company of Syracuse New
 
01:22:12.709 --> 01:22:12.719 align:start position:0%
York and then it lists about three dozen
 
01:22:14.470 --> 01:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
patents patent numbers yes in the old
 
01:22:15.669 --> 01:22:15.679 align:start position:0%
days they put the patent numbers right
 
01:22:19.350 --> 01:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
there and then if you go to the manual
 
01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
for the vehicle on the second or third
 
01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:23.110 align:start position:0%
for the vehicle on the second or third
page

01:22:23.110 --> 01:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
page
 
01:22:25.750 --> 01:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
says to summarize there's a whole bunch
 
01:22:28.750 --> 01:22:28.760 align:start position:0%
of stuff in here that we have patents on
 
01:22:32.189 --> 01:22:32.199 align:start position:0%
and we make our own tools for and if you
 
01:22:34.470 --> 01:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
want anything fixed properly feel free
 
01:22:36.430 --> 01:22:36.440 align:start position:0%
to call your friendly local neighborhood
 
01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:38.229 align:start position:0%
to call your friendly local neighborhood
Franklin

01:22:38.229 --> 01:22:38.239 align:start position:0%
Franklin
 
01:22:41.629 --> 01:22:41.639 align:start position:0%
dealer and if you can't find it or fix
 
01:22:44.629 --> 01:22:44.639 align:start position:0%
it and you bust it don't call
 
01:22:48.149 --> 01:22:48.159 align:start position:0%
us um and then just so we go maybe that
 
01:22:50.430 --> 01:22:50.440 align:start position:0%
was unique to Franklin I also am the
 
01:22:53.430 --> 01:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
happy owner of a 1950 packer before you
 
01:22:55.629 --> 01:22:55.639 align:start position:0%
go too far you do realize that patents
 
01:22:58.910 --> 01:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
expire I do but the point is and they've
 
01:23:01.030 --> 01:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
got patents that will expire too soon
 
01:23:04.189 --> 01:23:04.199 align:start position:0%
enough soon enough but the the point is
 
01:23:08.030 --> 01:23:08.040 align:start position:0%
this isn't a new situation this is as
 
01:23:09.750 --> 01:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
long as people have been manufacturing
 
01:23:12.070 --> 01:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
automobiles there have been proprietary
 
01:23:13.430 --> 01:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
tools and
 
01:23:16.070 --> 01:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
proprietary I mean Franklin sued Alcoa
 
01:23:21.390 --> 01:23:21.400 align:start position:0%
and one you know uh what yeah what they
 
01:23:22.910 --> 01:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
settled for a dollar and whole bunch
 
01:23:24.990 --> 01:23:25.000 align:start position:0%
ofum but that's must been casting it was
 
01:23:28.189 --> 01:23:28.199 align:start position:0%
a cast casting debate yeah okay so the
 
01:23:30.310 --> 01:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
point is there's a whole bunch of this
 
01:23:33.310 --> 01:23:33.320 align:start position:0%
isn't a new Pro this is I understand
 
01:23:35.470 --> 01:23:35.480 align:start position:0%
that technology modern technology is
 
01:23:37.189 --> 01:23:37.199 align:start position:0%
baffling and you can't fix it in your
 
01:23:40.790 --> 01:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
backyard anymore but I don't think
 
01:23:42.550 --> 01:23:42.560 align:start position:0%
therefore would you believe I don't
 
01:23:44.550 --> 01:23:44.560 align:start position:0%
think this is a necessary piece of
 
01:23:46.390 --> 01:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
legislation thank
 
01:23:48.510 --> 01:23:48.520 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much for your
 
01:23:49.950 --> 01:23:49.960 align:start position:0%
testimony thank
 
01:23:53.270 --> 01:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
you oh representative gives has a
 
01:23:56.590 --> 01:23:56.600 align:start position:0%
question thank you um uh this is should
 
01:23:58.830 --> 01:23:58.840 align:start position:0%
be a simple question uh you mentioned
 
01:24:01.910 --> 01:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
anou that would have information that
 
01:24:04.510 --> 01:24:04.520 align:start position:0%
can be purchased by the independent
 
01:24:08.550 --> 01:24:08.560 align:start position:0%
repair shop um thatou I would assume is
 
01:24:12.310 --> 01:24:12.320 align:start position:0%
between the manufacturers Association
 
01:24:14.510 --> 01:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
and someone else who is the other party
 
01:24:16.390 --> 01:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
it's the Automotive Service Association
 
01:24:17.709 --> 01:24:17.719 align:start position:0%
and they represent independent
 
01:24:20.950 --> 01:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
independent repair Specialists thank you
 
01:24:22.709 --> 01:24:22.719 align:start position:0%
yeah and just so you know the the major
 
01:24:25.910 --> 01:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
issue was the testing equipment and the
 
01:24:29.709 --> 01:24:29.719 align:start position:0%
tools so with that we will close the
 
01:24:51.350 --> 01:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:51.360 --> 03:14:31.590 align:start position:0%
 
questions

03:14:31.590 --> 03:14:31.600 align:start position:0%

you want the massage people we bring
 
03:15:48.150 --> 03:15:48.160 align:start position:0%
back call the alternative therapies
 
03:15:51.670 --> 03:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
actually I stopped that during Co all
 
03:15:54.950 --> 03:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
right what do we got
 
03:15:58.189 --> 03:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
today um well Mr
 
03:16:01.030 --> 03:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
notifications yes thank you Mr chairman
 
03:16:02.950 --> 03:16:02.960 align:start position:0%
and uh members of the committee I'm
 
03:16:04.750 --> 03:16:04.760 align:start position:0%
representative Ben brudi uh from
 
03:16:08.309 --> 03:16:08.319 align:start position:0%
Manchester representing Hill 41 which is
 
03:16:12.990 --> 03:16:13.000 align:start position:0%
Manchester's Wards 68 and nine
 
03:16:16.429 --> 03:16:16.439 align:start position:0%
um this is a very simple bill it
 
03:16:18.510 --> 03:16:18.520 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be
 
03:16:21.349 --> 03:16:21.359 align:start position:0%
uh this is got a long history that I'm
 
03:16:23.870 --> 03:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
not going to bore anybody with but um
 
03:16:28.349 --> 03:16:28.359 align:start position:0%
basically what this does is if um a
 
03:16:31.790 --> 03:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
retailer has a credit card company
 
03:16:34.389 --> 03:16:34.399 align:start position:0%
servicing credit cards or given credit
 
03:16:36.630 --> 03:16:36.640 align:start position:0%
cards with their name on it and they
 
03:16:39.990 --> 03:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
want to switch providers that they offer
 
03:16:43.070 --> 03:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
a 90-day notice
 
03:16:46.349 --> 03:16:46.359 align:start position:0%
so when they send out their bill for
 
03:16:48.870 --> 03:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
this month they'll say in 90
 
03:16:52.229 --> 03:16:52.239 align:start position:0%
days this other company has taken over
 
03:16:53.630 --> 03:16:53.640 align:start position:0%
that's all this bill
 
03:16:57.710 --> 03:16:57.720 align:start position:0%
does it's to notify the consumer that
 
03:16:59.950 --> 03:16:59.960 align:start position:0%
someone else is going to be sending you
 
03:17:01.830 --> 03:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
their credit
 
03:17:04.550 --> 03:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
card and that way it'll give somebody a
 
03:17:06.590 --> 03:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
90-day notice to if they don't want to
 
03:17:10.229 --> 03:17:10.239 align:start position:0%
do business with that new bank to
 
03:17:13.110 --> 03:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
switch it it really shouldn't cost
 
03:17:16.030 --> 03:17:16.040 align:start position:0%
anything and it's just making the
 
03:17:23.510 --> 03:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:25.950 --> 03:17:25.960 align:start position:0%
on I asked for one minute that's about
 
03:17:28.030 --> 03:17:28.040 align:start position:0%
it if you want me to go into long detail
 
03:17:32.189 --> 03:17:32.199 align:start position:0%
I can well I I guess give us a give us a
 
03:17:34.630 --> 03:17:34.640 align:start position:0%
u an example of how this has been a
 
03:17:37.790 --> 03:17:37.800 align:start position:0%
problem okay I mean what why is big
 
03:17:40.750 --> 03:17:40.760 align:start position:0%
problem we need to legislate for this
 
03:17:44.710 --> 03:17:44.720 align:start position:0%
about 12 hours a month in four different
 
03:17:47.950 --> 03:17:47.960 align:start position:0%
courts I do mediation for small claims
 
03:17:50.830 --> 03:17:50.840 align:start position:0%
and civil red cases okay and I hear
 
03:17:54.510 --> 03:17:54.520 align:start position:0%
people complain about this all the
 
03:17:58.150 --> 03:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
time I had a $700 credit card and then I
 
03:18:01.229 --> 03:18:01.239 align:start position:0%
get a bill for $4,100 I can't pay it I
 
03:18:03.670 --> 03:18:03.680 align:start position:0%
don't know what to do we're in court
 
03:18:05.110 --> 03:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
something's going to happen you're going
 
03:18:06.429 --> 03:18:06.439 align:start position:0%
to see the man
 
03:18:09.870 --> 03:18:09.880 align:start position:0%
today so I just never knew how to help
 
03:18:12.269 --> 03:18:12.279 align:start position:0%
anybody until something happened to to
 
03:18:13.710 --> 03:18:13.720 align:start position:0%
me and that's why I'm on the bill by
 
03:18:16.710 --> 03:18:16.720 align:start position:0%
myself because this is how I was aware
 
03:18:19.229 --> 03:18:19.239 align:start position:0%
of what was
 
03:18:22.070 --> 03:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
happening I was getting my gas if you
 
03:18:24.550 --> 03:18:24.560 align:start position:0%
might w't mind me mentioning names uh at
 
03:18:27.870 --> 03:18:27.880 align:start position:0%
BJs because they were the cheapest
 
03:18:30.790 --> 03:18:30.800 align:start position:0%
around and they're usually in towns
 
03:18:32.030 --> 03:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
where I
 
03:18:35.510 --> 03:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
go and so I had a BJ's credit card
 
03:18:37.429 --> 03:18:37.439 align:start position:0%
because I got 10 cents
 
03:18:40.910 --> 03:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
off so and I don't know if you get them
 
03:18:44.389 --> 03:18:44.399 align:start position:0%
but I get things in the mail maybe twice
 
03:18:47.269 --> 03:18:47.279 align:start position:0%
a week sometimes with Capital One trying
 
03:18:50.229 --> 03:18:50.239 align:start position:0%
to have me use one of their credit
 
03:18:53.070 --> 03:18:53.080 align:start position:0%
cards I mean I could get three a week
 
03:18:55.630 --> 03:18:55.640 align:start position:0%
you know I don't want to use Capital One
 
03:18:58.229 --> 03:18:58.239 align:start position:0%
I had a bad experience with them long
 
03:19:00.110 --> 03:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
long time ago and I want nothing to do
 
03:19:00.120 --> 03:19:01.229 align:start position:0%
long time ago and I want nothing to do
with

03:19:01.229 --> 03:19:01.239 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:19:05.309 --> 03:19:05.319 align:start position:0%
them so all of a sudden I get instead of
 
03:19:07.550 --> 03:19:07.560 align:start position:0%
a flyer saying you know join Capital One
 
03:19:08.870 --> 03:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
I get an
 
03:19:10.750 --> 03:19:10.760 align:start position:0%
envelope there's something hiding it
 
03:19:13.910 --> 03:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
there a card so I opened it up it's a
 
03:19:18.309 --> 03:19:18.319 align:start position:0%
BJ's credit card with Capital One on
 
03:19:23.870 --> 03:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
it with a bill for 300 and something
 
03:19:27.870 --> 03:19:27.880 align:start position:0%
dollars just under $300 I called them up
 
03:19:30.229 --> 03:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
I said I didn't want this credit card I
 
03:19:32.389 --> 03:19:32.399 align:start position:0%
didn't authorize this credit card I
 
03:19:34.189 --> 03:19:34.199 align:start position:0%
don't want this credit card I don't want
 
03:19:35.670 --> 03:19:35.680 align:start position:0%
to do business with
 
03:19:38.630 --> 03:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
you and I really don't want to pay for
 
03:19:41.030 --> 03:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
late fees and service charges on a bill
 
03:19:42.590 --> 03:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
that I didn't know I had
 
03:19:42.600 --> 03:19:43.950 align:start position:0%
that I didn't know I had
with

03:19:43.950 --> 03:19:43.960 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:19:47.670 --> 03:19:47.680 align:start position:0%
you well they they roundabout way they
 
03:19:50.269 --> 03:19:50.279 align:start position:0%
said well $88 is for an automatic
 
03:19:51.510 --> 03:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
renewal with
 
03:19:55.510 --> 03:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
BJs I said all right I'll I'll give it
 
03:19:58.590 --> 03:19:58.600 align:start position:0%
the $88 for if I sign something saying
 
03:20:01.349 --> 03:20:01.359 align:start position:0%
it was an automatic renewal which I
 
03:20:03.309 --> 03:20:03.319 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have done because actually my
 
03:20:04.870 --> 03:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
lawyer still working on
 
03:20:07.590 --> 03:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
it but yeah I wanted to be a member of
 
03:20:09.710 --> 03:20:09.720 align:start position:0%
BJs I don't go in the store that often
 
03:20:12.830 --> 03:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
but I was getting the gas there so
 
03:20:15.309 --> 03:20:15.319 align:start position:0%
anyway I got a $300 bill from Capital
 
03:20:17.229 --> 03:20:17.239 align:start position:0%
One a bank I don't want to do business
 
03:20:19.670 --> 03:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
with if I knew that was
 
03:20:22.469 --> 03:20:22.479 align:start position:0%
coming or if anybody knows that
 
03:20:24.110 --> 03:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
something like that's going to happen
 
03:20:26.830 --> 03:20:26.840 align:start position:0%
they can go out pay off a credit card if
 
03:20:30.590 --> 03:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
they owe money or get somebody else so
 
03:20:33.189 --> 03:20:33.199 align:start position:0%
that's where it came from I heard it for
 
03:20:38.429 --> 03:20:38.439 align:start position:0%
years in court now it finally is on my
 
03:20:41.389 --> 03:20:41.399 align:start position:0%
desk and that's why I think a 90-day
 
03:20:43.630 --> 03:20:43.640 align:start position:0%
notice does doesn't hurt anybody you
 
03:20:45.950 --> 03:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
want to send out a bill say in 90 days
 
03:20:48.309 --> 03:20:48.319 align:start position:0%
from now it's going to be serviced by
 
03:20:49.870 --> 03:20:49.880 align:start position:0%
this other
 
03:20:52.349 --> 03:20:52.359 align:start position:0%
bank it's up to the consumer to do
 
03:20:53.990 --> 03:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
something at that
 
03:20:56.830 --> 03:20:56.840 align:start position:0%
point so is this a problem with the
 
03:20:59.189 --> 03:20:59.199 align:start position:0%
credit card or with
 
03:21:01.590 --> 03:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
BJs well I think it's a combination of
 
03:21:03.910 --> 03:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
things BJs is doing business they they
 
03:21:05.870 --> 03:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
want to sell gas they want to store and
 
03:21:08.070 --> 03:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
sell things in their store they had
 
03:21:08.080 --> 03:21:09.189 align:start position:0%
sell things in their store they had
Symphony

03:21:09.189 --> 03:21:09.199 align:start position:0%
Symphony
 
03:21:11.429 --> 03:21:11.439 align:start position:0%
bank with their credit card with their
 
03:21:14.389 --> 03:21:14.399 align:start position:0%
name on credit card Sy fine symy Bank
 
03:21:17.630 --> 03:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
yeah okay see that's yeah so I never had
 
03:21:18.910 --> 03:21:18.920 align:start position:0%
a problem with it so I never had to
 
03:21:23.070 --> 03:21:23.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:26.950 --> 03:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
before but now if I knew I was going to
 
03:21:27.910 --> 03:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
be paying
 
03:21:31.030 --> 03:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
BJs I would have said no thank you I
 
03:21:33.309 --> 03:21:33.319 align:start position:0%
don't want your credit card I don't want
 
03:21:35.110 --> 03:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
to you know I wouldn't do be business
 
03:21:37.389 --> 03:21:37.399 align:start position:0%
with BJs anymore in fact I haven't since
 
03:21:37.399 --> 03:21:38.189 align:start position:0%
with BJs anymore in fact I haven't since
this

03:21:38.189 --> 03:21:38.199 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:21:40.429 --> 03:21:40.439 align:start position:0%
started and they do have the cheapest
 
03:21:42.670 --> 03:21:42.680 align:start position:0%
gas around
 
03:21:46.269 --> 03:21:46.279 align:start position:0%
so okay representative solivan yeah
 
03:21:47.910 --> 03:21:47.920 align:start position:0%
thanks um
 
03:21:50.510 --> 03:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
so do you know or have you done research
 
03:21:52.630 --> 03:21:52.640 align:start position:0%
prior to making this bill what if any
 
03:21:54.309 --> 03:21:54.319 align:start position:0%
standards there are is there are you
 
03:21:56.229 --> 03:21:56.239 align:start position:0%
telling me that there is nothing on the
 
03:21:58.469 --> 03:21:58.479 align:start position:0%
books about whether or not there is any
 
03:22:00.070 --> 03:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
notification period or do you want to
 
03:22:01.750 --> 03:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
extend a notification period from 30
 
03:22:03.990 --> 03:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
days to 90 days like what is what is the
 
03:22:06.189 --> 03:22:06.199 align:start position:0%
current rule is there anyone well I
 
03:22:07.990 --> 03:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
didn't get any notification and I don't
 
03:22:10.189 --> 03:22:10.199 align:start position:0%
know of any I know I I called the
 
03:22:11.550 --> 03:22:11.560 align:start position:0%
banking commissioner and he said he
 
03:22:12.990 --> 03:22:13.000 align:start position:0%
can't do anything because they're
 
03:22:15.750 --> 03:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
federally charted and uh there's nothing
 
03:22:18.590 --> 03:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
we can do about federally charted Banks
 
03:22:20.590 --> 03:22:20.600 align:start position:0%
but I mean something like this you can
 
03:22:22.389 --> 03:22:22.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents have a right to
 
03:22:26.309 --> 03:22:26.319 align:start position:0%
know if service is going to be switched
 
03:22:29.830 --> 03:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
but um is it another question for the
 
03:22:32.150 --> 03:22:32.160 align:start position:0%
question me inquir is it is it possible
 
03:22:33.990 --> 03:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
that something was sent in
 
03:22:36.150 --> 03:22:36.160 align:start position:0%
notification and and it was lost in the
 
03:22:37.910 --> 03:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
mail like maybe Capital when had sent
 
03:22:39.229 --> 03:22:39.239 align:start position:0%
something to you you thought it was just
 
03:22:40.630 --> 03:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
some sort of offer you threw it away
 
03:22:41.870 --> 03:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
because I throw those things away all
 
03:22:44.990 --> 03:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
the time well basically I do too I get
 
03:22:46.790 --> 03:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
it from the mailbox it never makes it in
 
03:22:46.800 --> 03:22:48.510 align:start position:0%
it from the mailbox it never makes it in
the

03:22:48.510 --> 03:22:48.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:22:51.110 --> 03:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
house I guess I think they have to I
 
03:22:54.750 --> 03:22:54.760 align:start position:0%
think the the store the the uh where
 
03:22:57.269 --> 03:22:57.279 align:start position:0%
you're you're shopping I think they
 
03:22:59.790 --> 03:22:59.800 align:start position:0%
should tell you I mean if something came
 
03:23:02.790 --> 03:23:02.800 align:start position:0%
from BJs I would open it it comes from
 
03:23:04.349 --> 03:23:04.359 align:start position:0%
Capital One i' get a couple of week
 
03:23:05.910 --> 03:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
that's going into garbage before I get
 
03:23:09.070 --> 03:23:09.080 align:start position:0%
in the house I don't want to deal with
 
03:23:11.229 --> 03:23:11.239 align:start position:0%
them yeah I I guess I'm just you're
 
03:23:12.910 --> 03:23:12.920 align:start position:0%
right it could curious I'm just curious
 
03:23:15.510 --> 03:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
if there is any standard now and I think
 
03:23:16.750 --> 03:23:16.760 align:start position:0%
that would be important for us to know
 
03:23:18.349 --> 03:23:18.359 align:start position:0%
before we make a decision on this bill
 
03:23:20.510 --> 03:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
because if there is a standard and yours
 
03:23:22.189 --> 03:23:22.199 align:start position:0%
fell through the crack somehow then we
 
03:23:23.469 --> 03:23:23.479 align:start position:0%
might not need this but maybe there is
 
03:23:25.349 --> 03:23:25.359 align:start position:0%
no standard in which case this would be
 
03:23:26.910 --> 03:23:26.920 align:start position:0%
warranted but it sounds like we don't we
 
03:23:28.790 --> 03:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer to that question I
 
03:23:31.750 --> 03:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
I don't but if it happened the way I
 
03:23:34.030 --> 03:23:34.040 align:start position:0%
said and say BJs did send me
 
03:23:36.670 --> 03:23:36.680 align:start position:0%
something I don't pay attention to them
 
03:23:38.429 --> 03:23:38.439 align:start position:0%
so maybe I did fall through the crack
 
03:23:39.710 --> 03:23:39.720 align:start position:0%
but there's got to be a different way to
 
03:23:42.750 --> 03:23:42.760 align:start position:0%
do it and I think whoever's
 
03:23:46.030 --> 03:23:46.040 align:start position:0%
the end you know the originator of the
 
03:23:48.950 --> 03:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
debt should tell you we're not using
 
03:23:51.269 --> 03:23:51.279 align:start position:0%
this Bank anymore we Us in this
 
03:23:51.279 --> 03:23:54.550 align:start position:0%
this Bank anymore we Us in this
Bank

03:23:54.550 --> 03:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:57.710 --> 03:23:57.720 align:start position:0%
thanks representative
 
03:23:59.990 --> 03:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
buroughs thank you I was just I was
 
03:24:02.110 --> 03:24:02.120 align:start position:0%
wondering if you excuse me if you could
 
03:24:04.670 --> 03:24:04.680 align:start position:0%
clarify I think you said that you saw a
 
03:24:07.830 --> 03:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
one of the bills go from $700 to
 
03:24:10.349 --> 03:24:10.359 align:start position:0%
$4,100 oh I see those all the time but
 
03:24:12.229 --> 03:24:12.239 align:start position:0%
how did that happen with the new vendor
 
03:24:14.429 --> 03:24:14.439 align:start position:0%
how did it jump from well I don't know I
 
03:24:17.950 --> 03:24:17.960 align:start position:0%
mean I hear credit card complaints every
 
03:24:20.670 --> 03:24:20.680 align:start position:0%
week I'm in court maybe once a week I
 
03:24:24.630 --> 03:24:24.640 align:start position:0%
cover five mornings a month in court out
 
03:24:26.590 --> 03:24:26.600 align:start position:0%
of the five mornings I'll probably hear
 
03:24:28.229 --> 03:24:28.239 align:start position:0%
seven or eight complaints about credit
 
03:24:30.550 --> 03:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
cards about how people can't afford them
 
03:24:32.110 --> 03:24:32.120 align:start position:0%
how they don't understand the bill they
 
03:24:33.790 --> 03:24:33.800 align:start position:0%
don't understand where the money's go
 
03:24:35.790 --> 03:24:35.800 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's all
 
03:24:38.070 --> 03:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
interest sometimes two-thirds of their
 
03:24:40.110 --> 03:24:40.120 align:start position:0%
bill is interest and
 
03:24:44.269 --> 03:24:44.279 align:start position:0%
penalties late fees and interest so
 
03:24:47.150 --> 03:24:47.160 align:start position:0%
follow brother question so you're saying
 
03:24:49.189 --> 03:24:49.199 align:start position:0%
that that this particular one jumped
 
03:24:51.950 --> 03:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
from 700 to 4,100 because of interest
 
03:24:55.429 --> 03:24:55.439 align:start position:0%
and if so over what period of time well
 
03:24:57.510 --> 03:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
by the time it comes to my desk when
 
03:24:59.070 --> 03:24:59.080 align:start position:0%
they come in for
 
03:25:01.750 --> 03:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
mediation the lawyer representing the
 
03:25:03.790 --> 03:25:03.800 align:start position:0%
credit card company doesn't know or not
 
03:25:06.070 --> 03:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
the credit card company that the company
 
03:25:07.870 --> 03:25:07.880 align:start position:0%
who buys the debt from the cred card
 
03:25:09.590 --> 03:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
company there now it's another third
 
03:25:12.950 --> 03:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
person they just buy the debt they can't
 
03:25:15.790 --> 03:25:15.800 align:start position:0%
tell you what you bought when you bought
 
03:25:18.630 --> 03:25:18.640 align:start position:0%
it they bought the debt they didn't
 
03:25:21.070 --> 03:25:21.080 align:start position:0%
buy all the paperwork that went with it
 
03:25:24.309 --> 03:25:24.319 align:start position:0%
before so they can't even tell you and
 
03:25:25.870 --> 03:25:25.880 align:start position:0%
the judge isn't going to want to hear
 
03:25:27.550 --> 03:25:27.560 align:start position:0%
the judge is going to say this company
 
03:25:29.590 --> 03:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
says they owe you
 
03:25:31.990 --> 03:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
this and the judge can't tell you where
 
03:25:34.110 --> 03:25:34.120 align:start position:0%
the debt came from what you bought when
 
03:25:36.910 --> 03:25:36.920 align:start position:0%
you bought it how much you bought it
 
03:25:40.309 --> 03:25:40.319 align:start position:0%
for all they can tell you is what the
 
03:25:43.990 --> 03:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
debt was sold to this third party for
 
03:25:47.590 --> 03:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
lvnv funding is one that I know of uh
 
03:25:50.870 --> 03:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
portfolio is another company um you must
 
03:25:53.469 --> 03:25:53.479 align:start position:0%
you must know more you know all of them
 
03:25:55.670 --> 03:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
but they're all collection
 
03:25:57.870 --> 03:25:57.880 align:start position:0%
people and they don't have the
 
03:25:59.229 --> 03:25:59.239 align:start position:0%
background of the debt so they're
 
03:26:01.189 --> 03:26:01.199 align:start position:0%
cranking up the interest
 
03:26:03.349 --> 03:26:03.359 align:start position:0%
rate I don't know where they get that
 
03:26:04.870 --> 03:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
they just keep pumping it up and the
 
03:26:06.469 --> 03:26:06.479 align:start position:0%
interest rates are pretty high on credit
 
03:26:09.670 --> 03:26:09.680 align:start position:0%
cards and I see credit card problems
 
03:26:11.870 --> 03:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
accelerating in the next couple years
 
03:26:14.110 --> 03:26:14.120 align:start position:0%
can I just say one quick thing keep
 
03:26:15.990 --> 03:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
going no I guess my question is if we
 
03:26:17.710 --> 03:26:17.720 align:start position:0%
don't have any
 
03:26:21.150 --> 03:26:21.160 align:start position:0%
idea where how it got from A to B I'm
 
03:26:23.990 --> 03:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
not sure what we can do to fix
 
03:26:27.990 --> 03:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
it well that's that's not what this bill
 
03:26:30.309 --> 03:26:30.319 align:start position:0%
does but I wish we did have something
 
03:26:32.469 --> 03:26:32.479 align:start position:0%
that did that now you're now you're
 
03:26:35.469 --> 03:26:35.479 align:start position:0%
getting into a federal
 
03:26:39.349 --> 03:26:39.359 align:start position:0%
situation you know when when the credit
 
03:26:41.990 --> 03:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
card when a credit card comes company
 
03:26:45.469 --> 03:26:45.479 align:start position:0%
says you owe this much money they hand
 
03:26:48.630 --> 03:26:48.640 align:start position:0%
it off to a collection agency all they
 
03:26:51.269 --> 03:26:51.279 align:start position:0%
hand off is the debt they don't hand the
 
03:26:54.150 --> 03:26:54.160 align:start position:0%
whole file over these lawyers can't tell
 
03:27:01.229 --> 03:27:01.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:04.189 --> 03:27:04.199 align:start position:0%
from represent
 
03:27:06.150 --> 03:27:06.160 align:start position:0%
M yes
 
03:27:09.830 --> 03:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
represent thank you and do I understand
 
03:27:12.830 --> 03:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
you said when you're you had a a BJ
 
03:27:14.790 --> 03:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
credit card with synchron I think and
 
03:27:17.710 --> 03:27:17.720 align:start position:0%
then you got a uh a bill in a credit
 
03:27:22.150 --> 03:27:22.160 align:start position:0%
card from uh BJs but it was Capital One
 
03:27:24.750 --> 03:27:24.760 align:start position:0%
but did the balance that came over which
 
03:27:27.110 --> 03:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
was just under $300 was that your
 
03:27:30.110 --> 03:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
original balance or did they change it I
 
03:27:33.150 --> 03:27:33.160 align:start position:0%
didn't have a balance with BJs now how
 
03:27:34.950 --> 03:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
in the heck did they but Capital One
 
03:27:38.710 --> 03:27:38.720 align:start position:0%
said $88 of that bill was for an
 
03:27:41.510 --> 03:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
automatic renewal with BJs for a member
 
03:27:44.469 --> 03:27:44.479 align:start position:0%
membership which I I can understand that
 
03:27:48.269 --> 03:27:48.279 align:start position:0%
I would automatically renew it but I I
 
03:27:50.030 --> 03:27:50.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't automatically renew it with
 
03:27:51.510 --> 03:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
BJ's number
 
03:27:55.389 --> 03:27:55.399 align:start position:0%
one I don't have anything I signed years
 
03:27:57.349 --> 03:27:57.359 align:start position:0%
ago when I first took out my account
 
03:27:59.790 --> 03:27:59.800 align:start position:0%
with PJs what I signed I don't even know
 
03:28:01.429 --> 03:28:01.439 align:start position:0%
if it's an automatic renewal I know I
 
03:28:03.269 --> 03:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
just pay it when the bill comes in
 
03:28:05.950 --> 03:28:05.960 align:start position:0%
they'll say $88 from membership they
 
03:28:08.429 --> 03:28:08.439 align:start position:0%
send that once a year you pay
 
03:28:11.710 --> 03:28:11.720 align:start position:0%
it so I don't know what I sign sign when
 
03:28:13.710 --> 03:28:13.720 align:start position:0%
I signed it but it wasn't recently but
 
03:28:15.790 --> 03:28:15.800 align:start position:0%
but your bill was for 300 bucks where
 
03:28:17.950 --> 03:28:17.960 align:start position:0%
did the extra money come from interest
 
03:28:19.630 --> 03:28:19.640 align:start position:0%
and late
 
03:28:22.309 --> 03:28:22.319 align:start position:0%
fees but you always paid your bill on
 
03:28:23.590 --> 03:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
time how did they get the interest and
 
03:28:25.550 --> 03:28:25.560 align:start position:0%
late fees it was interest and late fees
 
03:28:28.590 --> 03:28:28.600 align:start position:0%
on a Capital One bill because he was
 
03:28:30.590 --> 03:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
throwing the Capital
 
03:28:34.750 --> 03:28:34.760 align:start position:0%
One statements in the trash no I was
 
03:28:37.510 --> 03:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
throwing all their brochures all their
 
03:28:39.790 --> 03:28:39.800 align:start position:0%
all their advertising stuff went in the
 
03:28:42.590 --> 03:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
trash it said Capital One you threw it
 
03:28:45.590 --> 03:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
out well I probably
 
03:28:47.670 --> 03:28:47.680 align:start position:0%
did because there a company I didn't
 
03:28:49.189 --> 03:28:49.199 align:start position:0%
want to deal with and I didn't want to
 
03:28:50.630 --> 03:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
read their
 
03:28:54.429 --> 03:28:54.439 align:start position:0%
brochures so so the The $64,000 Question
 
03:28:57.910 --> 03:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
is so when
 
03:29:01.630 --> 03:29:01.640 align:start position:0%
BJs they never sent you any
 
03:29:04.910 --> 03:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
notification that they were
 
03:29:04.920 --> 03:29:06.469 align:start position:0%
notification that they were
now

03:29:06.469 --> 03:29:06.479 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:29:09.750 --> 03:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh using you use instead of whatever
 
03:29:12.550 --> 03:29:12.560 align:start position:0%
credit card you had on file for whatever
 
03:29:14.710 --> 03:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
bills you had that they were switching
 
03:29:17.950 --> 03:29:17.960 align:start position:0%
you over to a Capital One account no saw
 
03:29:20.429 --> 03:29:20.439 align:start position:0%
anything they so this is a merchant
 
03:29:22.150 --> 03:29:22.160 align:start position:0%
problem it's a merchant problem it's not
 
03:29:25.269 --> 03:29:25.279 align:start position:0%
a credit card problem it's that BJs did
 
03:29:29.750 --> 03:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
not properly notify you that they were
 
03:29:32.550 --> 03:29:32.560 align:start position:0%
sending that they had they had
 
03:29:36.110 --> 03:29:36.120 align:start position:0%
automatically signed you up to a Capital
 
03:29:38.710 --> 03:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
One account even though you never said
 
03:29:40.830 --> 03:29:40.840 align:start position:0%
yes to it cuz you wouldn't you would be
 
03:29:42.750 --> 03:29:42.760 align:start position:0%
a whole day in hell that you would ever
 
03:29:45.990 --> 03:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
sign up for Capital One n and they
 
03:29:50.229 --> 03:29:50.239 align:start position:0%
decide to charge your annual fee just
 
03:29:53.550 --> 03:29:53.560 align:start position:0%
like we all have Amazon Prime and we get
 
03:29:57.389 --> 03:29:57.399 align:start position:0%
our annual thing and they charge it to
 
03:29:59.550 --> 03:29:59.560 align:start position:0%
the credit card that we have on file
 
03:30:01.429 --> 03:30:01.439 align:start position:0%
yeah they
 
03:30:04.870 --> 03:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:08.429 --> 03:30:08.439 align:start position:0%
only not only didn't notify you that
 
03:30:11.830 --> 03:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
they created a Capital One account for
 
03:30:15.030 --> 03:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
you and build it to the Capital One
 
03:30:18.550 --> 03:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
account that unbeknown to you you never
 
03:30:23.030 --> 03:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
got a notification that they did that
 
03:30:25.630 --> 03:30:25.640 align:start position:0%
no representative
 
03:30:29.510 --> 03:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
Gibs thank you Mr chairman uh just to be
 
03:30:33.750 --> 03:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
sure I understand um this bill does not
 
03:30:36.469 --> 03:30:36.479 align:start position:0%
attempt to fix any any of the problems
 
03:30:39.269 --> 03:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
you've been describing with differences
 
03:30:43.670 --> 03:30:43.680 align:start position:0%
in credit card charges no uh it only
 
03:30:46.269 --> 03:30:46.279 align:start position:0%
provides for notice that the type of
 
03:30:48.189 --> 03:30:48.199 align:start position:0%
credit card is going to be changed
 
03:30:51.830 --> 03:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
that's it thank you representative pelli
 
03:30:54.070 --> 03:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thank you for letting me
 
03:30:57.110 --> 03:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
ask the question I had similar concerns
 
03:30:59.150 --> 03:30:59.160 align:start position:0%
that you just raised that it's not
 
03:31:01.670 --> 03:31:01.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily the credit card company but
 
03:31:04.590 --> 03:31:04.600 align:start position:0%
it is the merchant that is co-branding
 
03:31:07.030 --> 03:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
with the credit card company to go
 
03:31:08.550 --> 03:31:08.560 align:start position:0%
through the process that you just
 
03:31:11.110 --> 03:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
described so where would the notice
 
03:31:14.469 --> 03:31:14.479 align:start position:0%
ification be in a separate letter on a
 
03:31:17.590 --> 03:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
prior statement I think that needs to be
 
03:31:19.990 --> 03:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
a little clear and I'm again I'm not
 
03:31:22.670 --> 03:31:22.680 align:start position:0%
sure that it's the credit card company's
 
03:31:25.590 --> 03:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
responsibility but the you know the like
 
03:31:27.550 --> 03:31:27.560 align:start position:0%
you're saying the merchant that's
 
03:31:30.229 --> 03:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
Contracting with the credit card
 
03:31:32.229 --> 03:31:32.239 align:start position:0%
company well I think it could be a
 
03:31:34.349 --> 03:31:34.359 align:start position:0%
combination of things like BJs could
 
03:31:36.910 --> 03:31:36.920 align:start position:0%
have sent me something saying to a
 
03:31:38.750 --> 03:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
switching because I would have opened
 
03:31:41.349 --> 03:31:41.359 align:start position:0%
the BJ's thing or the bank that was
 
03:31:44.229 --> 03:31:44.239 align:start position:0%
servicing the account before on one of
 
03:31:46.349 --> 03:31:46.359 align:start position:0%
their bills like the third bill before
 
03:31:48.950 --> 03:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
it changed saying as an EST State when
 
03:31:52.389 --> 03:31:52.399 align:start position:0%
no longer going to service this
 
03:31:54.670 --> 03:31:54.680 align:start position:0%
account as long as there's some notice
 
03:31:58.870 --> 03:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
out there that makes the consumer aware
 
03:32:00.830 --> 03:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
that something was going to
 
03:32:06.150 --> 03:32:06.160 align:start position:0%
happen Okay so do you do business with
 
03:32:09.750 --> 03:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
BJs I haven't since this no I saying
 
03:32:11.790 --> 03:32:11.800 align:start position:0%
prior to all this happened
 
03:32:14.349 --> 03:32:14.359 align:start position:0%
yeah you do business with I got
 
03:32:17.189 --> 03:32:17.199 align:start position:0%
exclusively gas because unless I was out
 
03:32:20.349 --> 03:32:20.359 align:start position:0%
of stage did you ever shop at BJs I have
 
03:32:20.359 --> 03:32:21.830 align:start position:0%
of stage did you ever shop at BJs I have
okay

03:32:21.830 --> 03:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:32:26.550 --> 03:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
so is there a potential that you bought
 
03:32:29.309 --> 03:32:29.319 align:start position:0%
something that was rather expensive and
 
03:32:32.590 --> 03:32:32.600 align:start position:0%
they said if you want to sign up for a
 
03:32:36.110 --> 03:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
credit card we can give you 10%
 
03:32:41.910 --> 03:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
off does that ring a bell no
 
03:32:44.630 --> 03:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
I know that if I use the capital the U
 
03:32:47.550 --> 03:32:47.560 align:start position:0%
BJ's credit card at the gas pump I got
 
03:32:50.710 --> 03:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
10 cents a gallon off
 
03:32:53.590 --> 03:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
right but you don't remember in going in
 
03:32:56.309 --> 03:32:56.319 align:start position:0%
and buying something at BJs where they
 
03:32:59.550 --> 03:32:59.560 align:start position:0%
said you can sign up for a credit card
 
03:33:02.309 --> 03:33:02.319 align:start position:0%
oh years or 10% about the sign up the
 
03:33:04.429 --> 03:33:04.439 align:start position:0%
credit card because I
 
03:33:07.429 --> 03:33:07.439 align:start position:0%
know we don't necessarily necessar pay
 
03:33:09.469 --> 03:33:09.479 align:start position:0%
they they give you an opportunity to get
 
03:33:14.070 --> 03:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
10% off if you sign up for something do
 
03:33:16.670 --> 03:33:16.680 align:start position:0%
you remember any of that maybe years and
 
03:33:19.110 --> 03:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
years ago I don't remember when I first
 
03:33:19.120 --> 03:33:20.110 align:start position:0%
years ago I don't remember when I first
signed

03:33:20.110 --> 03:33:20.120 align:start position:0%
signed
 
03:33:23.750 --> 03:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
up okay uh
 
03:33:28.030 --> 03:33:28.040 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs again thank you uh
 
03:33:30.670 --> 03:33:30.680 align:start position:0%
just again to be sure that I understand
 
03:33:34.150 --> 03:33:34.160 align:start position:0%
um the bill says that the Creditor shall
 
03:33:37.309 --> 03:33:37.319 align:start position:0%
provide not notification to all holders
 
03:33:40.030 --> 03:33:40.040 align:start position:0%
of such credit card and the Creditor is
 
03:33:41.469 --> 03:33:41.479 align:start position:0%
the merchant
 
03:33:43.429 --> 03:33:43.439 align:start position:0%
so the notice would have to come from
 
03:33:46.110 --> 03:33:46.120 align:start position:0%
the merchant is that correct I believe
 
03:33:48.349 --> 03:33:48.359 align:start position:0%
that's the way it was written
 
03:33:52.429 --> 03:33:52.439 align:start position:0%
so if BJ sent me a notice
 
03:33:55.110 --> 03:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
saying the credit cards will now come
 
03:33:57.110 --> 03:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
from Capital
 
03:34:00.189 --> 03:34:00.199 align:start position:0%
One as of this date I would have
 
03:34:03.349 --> 03:34:03.359 align:start position:0%
declined taking it I declined taking it
 
03:34:07.189 --> 03:34:07.199 align:start position:0%
anyway but they sent it to me representa
 
03:34:09.870 --> 03:34:09.880 align:start position:0%
spear would you believe I've had a very
 
03:34:12.830 --> 03:34:12.840 align:start position:0%
similar problem with Capital One exactly
 
03:34:15.710 --> 03:34:15.720 align:start position:0%
as you describe it and it was horrendous
 
03:34:16.830 --> 03:34:16.840 align:start position:0%
getting out from
 
03:34:18.750 --> 03:34:18.760 align:start position:0%
under just what you believe so what was
 
03:34:18.760 --> 03:34:19.990 align:start position:0%
under just what you believe so what was
the

03:34:19.990 --> 03:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:34:22.710 --> 03:34:22.720 align:start position:0%
merchant oh
 
03:34:26.389 --> 03:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
God I think it might have been Long's
 
03:34:28.830 --> 03:34:28.840 align:start position:0%
Jeweler you bought something in Long's
 
03:34:32.150 --> 03:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
Jeweler and unbeknown to you you thought
 
03:34:34.269 --> 03:34:34.279 align:start position:0%
you were getting a Long's Jeweler credit
 
03:34:37.150 --> 03:34:37.160 align:start position:0%
but actually signed you with Capital One
 
03:34:38.510 --> 03:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
I did get out from under it but it took
 
03:34:40.510 --> 03:34:40.520 align:start position:0%
quite a while and I I had to go to Longs
 
03:34:43.189 --> 03:34:43.199 align:start position:0%
and complain a
 
03:34:45.469 --> 03:34:45.479 align:start position:0%
lot course they want to sell jewelry so
 
03:34:46.710 --> 03:34:46.720 align:start position:0%
they don't they're amable to the
 
03:34:49.269 --> 03:34:49.279 align:start position:0%
complaints but nonetheless it has
 
03:34:51.309 --> 03:34:51.319 align:start position:0%
happened where somehow Capital One gets
 
03:34:53.990 --> 03:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
into it I don't know what they're
 
03:34:59.429 --> 03:34:59.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:02.030 --> 03:35:02.040 align:start position:0%

chairman I'm still Ben Bui from
Manchester

03:42:12.950 --> 03:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:18.269 --> 03:42:18.279 align:start position:0%
um this this is um call it the sister
 
03:42:21.189 --> 03:42:21.199 align:start position:0%
bill it again has to do with credit
 
03:42:23.389 --> 03:42:23.399 align:start position:0%
cards this does have to do with credit
 
03:42:27.030 --> 03:42:27.040 align:start position:0%
cards um a lot of complaints that I've
 
03:42:29.670 --> 03:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
heard and uh I've
 
03:42:34.990 --> 03:42:35.000 align:start position:0%
seen where people get charged $25 late
 
03:42:38.950 --> 03:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
fee plus interest on
 
03:42:38.960 --> 03:42:41.790 align:start position:0%
fee plus interest on
a15

03:42:41.790 --> 03:42:41.800 align:start position:0%
a15
 
03:42:44.429 --> 03:42:44.439 align:start position:0%
bill I think that's
 
03:42:47.309 --> 03:42:47.319 align:start position:0%
expensive um I I don't see any need for
 
03:42:48.870 --> 03:42:48.880 align:start position:0%
that that they're just gouging the
 
03:42:51.229 --> 03:42:51.239 align:start position:0%
public doing stuff like that I mean if
 
03:42:54.229 --> 03:42:54.239 align:start position:0%
you owe a dollar or five dollar or
 
03:42:55.910 --> 03:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
whatever why should they be able to
 
03:42:58.149 --> 03:42:58.159 align:start position:0%
charge you 25 or
 
03:43:00.670 --> 03:43:00.680 align:start position:0%
more that that doesn't make any sense
 
03:43:02.269 --> 03:43:02.279 align:start position:0%
they don't have a lot of skin in it they
 
03:43:04.309 --> 03:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
don't have a lot of investment in
 
03:43:06.950 --> 03:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
that transaction and somebody May pay a
 
03:43:09.349 --> 03:43:09.359 align:start position:0%
bill and not pay the full balance and
 
03:43:10.830 --> 03:43:10.840 align:start position:0%
say well
 
03:43:12.870 --> 03:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
that that bill is paid and I don't use
 
03:43:16.750 --> 03:43:16.760 align:start position:0%
it anymore so I know I use Macy's credit
 
03:43:18.550 --> 03:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
card around Christmas time and then I
 
03:43:21.269 --> 03:43:21.279 align:start position:0%
pay it off in January and I get stuff
 
03:43:22.790 --> 03:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
from acy's and I know I don't have a
 
03:43:27.389 --> 03:43:27.399 align:start position:0%
balance so but if I owed them a $150 why
 
03:43:31.710 --> 03:43:31.720 align:start position:0%
should I be charged over $20 or $30 for
 
03:43:36.910 --> 03:43:36.920 align:start position:0%
a a small balance that's what this build
 
03:43:39.269 --> 03:43:39.279 align:start position:0%
does okay this one I know something
 
03:43:40.790 --> 03:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
about oh all
 
03:43:44.269 --> 03:43:44.279 align:start position:0%
right educate us Mr chairman so I've had
 
03:43:46.070 --> 03:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
moments because I I sit down once a
 
03:43:48.309 --> 03:43:48.319 align:start position:0%
month to pay all my credit card
 
03:43:51.149 --> 03:43:51.159 align:start position:0%
bills and I won't mention which
 
03:43:53.870 --> 03:43:53.880 align:start position:0%
financial institution but I because they
 
03:43:56.630 --> 03:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
had changed their wind their system
 
03:43:59.110 --> 03:43:59.120 align:start position:0%
somewhat but I sometimes
 
03:44:03.349 --> 03:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
forget to actually go to the next screen
 
03:44:05.670 --> 03:44:05.680 align:start position:0%
which says pay
 
03:44:08.910 --> 03:44:08.920 align:start position:0%
it so I think I paid my credit card B I
 
03:44:10.710 --> 03:44:10.720 align:start position:0%
went online I did everything but I
 
03:44:13.790 --> 03:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
didn't hit to pay it and I'm too busy
 
03:44:15.550 --> 03:44:15.560 align:start position:0%
transferring the information over to my
 
03:44:17.349 --> 03:44:17.359 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet cuz I keep a spreadsheet of
 
03:44:18.990 --> 03:44:19.000 align:start position:0%
all my credit card bills and then when I
 
03:44:21.870 --> 03:44:21.880 align:start position:0%
paid them and what they paid and then
 
03:44:25.149 --> 03:44:25.159 align:start position:0%
the following month I get that
 
03:44:29.429 --> 03:44:29.439 align:start position:0%
notice that said I didn't pay my
 
03:44:33.630 --> 03:44:33.640 align:start position:0%
bill so I duly called them up and said I
 
03:44:37.070 --> 03:44:37.080 align:start position:0%
am so sorry I thought I paid
 
03:44:40.990 --> 03:44:41.000 align:start position:0%
it and loone behold
 
03:44:45.469 --> 03:44:45.479 align:start position:0%
hold they will always say we can credit
 
03:44:49.550 --> 03:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
you for the late payment fee because I'm
 
03:44:51.630 --> 03:44:51.640 align:start position:0%
now calling on the
 
03:44:56.149 --> 03:44:56.159 align:start position:0%
phone but we can't wave the credit card
 
03:44:57.349 --> 03:44:57.359 align:start position:0%
the the
 
03:45:00.389 --> 03:45:00.399 align:start position:0%
interest but they
 
03:45:04.149 --> 03:45:04.159 align:start position:0%
always 100% of the time have always
 
03:45:07.349 --> 03:45:07.359 align:start position:0%
credit me for the late payment
 
03:45:10.750 --> 03:45:10.760 align:start position:0%
fee but I do have to pay resp you have
 
03:45:14.550 --> 03:45:14.560 align:start position:0%
to pay the the interest your bill you're
 
03:45:17.710 --> 03:45:17.720 align:start position:0%
just looking for the late payment fee
 
03:45:22.349 --> 03:45:22.359 align:start position:0%
right not sure yeah well and other uh
 
03:45:25.149 --> 03:45:25.159 align:start position:0%
other charges oh so you also want the
 
03:45:26.910 --> 03:45:26.920 align:start position:0%
interest interest I can understand if
 
03:45:29.630 --> 03:45:29.640 align:start position:0%
they're carrying if they have money
 
03:45:32.429 --> 03:45:32.439 align:start position:0%
invested right no matter how much it is
 
03:45:34.429 --> 03:45:34.439 align:start position:0%
their money's invested they have a right
 
03:45:36.030 --> 03:45:36.040 align:start position:0%
to get interest on that money that they
 
03:45:37.910 --> 03:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
have the interest for a
 
03:45:41.189 --> 03:45:41.199 align:start position:0%
$150 is not going to be that much well
 
03:45:44.110 --> 03:45:44.120 align:start position:0%
and but they always have waved but
 
03:45:47.429 --> 03:45:47.439 align:start position:0%
here's the thing you got to call right
 
03:45:50.469 --> 03:45:50.479 align:start position:0%
away you can't
 
03:45:52.710 --> 03:45:52.720 align:start position:0%
delay well when do you call what the
 
03:45:54.269 --> 03:45:54.279 align:start position:0%
next when you get when I get the next
 
03:45:56.510 --> 03:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
statement the next following the F the
 
03:45:58.309 --> 03:45:58.319 align:start position:0%
next following monthly statement when I
 
03:45:59.510 --> 03:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
get that
 
03:46:03.630 --> 03:46:03.640 align:start position:0%
statement I see that I have I I screwed
 
03:46:07.269 --> 03:46:07.279 align:start position:0%
up and it didn't get paid and so
 
03:46:09.750 --> 03:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
therefore they'll say to me no problem
 
03:46:12.189 --> 03:46:12.199 align:start position:0%
on the late payment fee will wave that
 
03:46:14.229 --> 03:46:14.239 align:start position:0%
and sure enough that does show in my
 
03:46:17.070 --> 03:46:17.080 align:start position:0%
following month statement but the
 
03:46:19.750 --> 03:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
interest I'm still on the hook for you

03:46:39.070 --> 03:46:39.080 align:start position:0%
uh every you unbelievable amount of
 
03:46:41.349 --> 03:46:41.359 align:start position:0%
credit card I have I have literally I
 
03:46:44.269 --> 03:46:44.279 align:start position:0%
have a I don't have use my bank America
 
03:46:46.469 --> 03:46:46.479 align:start position:0%
much anymore but I would have I right
 
03:46:48.550 --> 03:46:48.560 align:start position:0%
now I would say easily I have eight
 
03:46:50.550 --> 03:46:50.560 align:start position:0%
different credit
 
03:46:53.389 --> 03:46:53.399 align:start position:0%
cards credit card questions from the
 
03:46:53.399 --> 03:46:56.630 align:start position:0%
cards credit card questions from the
committee

03:46:56.630 --> 03:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:56.640 --> 03:46:58.229 align:start position:0%
 
members

03:46:58.229 --> 03:46:58.239 align:start position:0%
members
 
03:47:00.950 --> 03:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
okay so it wouldn't hurt to just put it
 
03:47:03.750 --> 03:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
in under the statue of the credit card
 
03:47:07.189 --> 03:47:07.199 align:start position:0%
statue and no they're these ferally
 
03:47:10.070 --> 03:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
chartered we the first answer you got
 
03:47:11.469 --> 03:47:11.479 align:start position:0%
you on the first bill was the right
 
03:47:13.189 --> 03:47:13.199 align:start position:0%
answer these are federally chartered we
 
03:47:14.389 --> 03:47:14.399 align:start position:0%
can't do anything about federally
 
03:47:14.399 --> 03:47:15.670 align:start position:0%
can't do anything about federally
chartered

03:47:15.670 --> 03:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
chartered
 
03:47:15.680 --> 03:47:17.590 align:start position:0%
chartered
Banks

03:47:17.590 --> 03:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
Banks
 
03:47:20.910 --> 03:47:20.920 align:start position:0%
about well the the when I talk to the
 
03:47:22.429 --> 03:47:22.439 align:start position:0%
banking commissioner that could fall
 
03:47:22.439 --> 03:47:24.830 align:start position:0%
banking commissioner that could fall
under

03:47:24.830 --> 03:47:24.840 align:start position:0%
under
 
03:47:28.149 --> 03:47:28.159 align:start position:0%
this because it's a federally charted
 
03:47:30.830 --> 03:47:30.840 align:start position:0%
but you know yeah consumer protection
 
03:47:33.070 --> 03:47:33.080 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah yeah but what if it's not a
 
03:47:36.189 --> 03:47:36.199 align:start position:0%
federally charted Bank uh you want to
 
03:47:38.389 --> 03:47:38.399 align:start position:0%
screw New Hampshire Banks well I don't
 
03:47:40.870 --> 03:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
want to screw on New Hampshire citizens
 
03:47:42.030 --> 03:47:42.040 align:start position:0%
no but I'm just saying you would you
 
03:47:43.269 --> 03:47:43.279 align:start position:0%
want to you want to let federally
 
03:47:44.750 --> 03:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
Charter Banks get away with something
 
03:47:46.389 --> 03:47:46.399 align:start position:0%
and but only make New Hampshire Banks
 
03:47:47.830 --> 03:47:47.840 align:start position:0%
pay for I think we should talk to our
 
03:47:49.590 --> 03:47:49.600 align:start position:0%
people running for office right now and
 
03:47:51.229 --> 03:47:51.239 align:start position:0%
ask them about it if they'll want to do
 
03:47:52.710 --> 03:47:52.720 align:start position:0%
something about it because I've talked
 
03:47:55.710 --> 03:47:55.720 align:start position:0%
to a couple of them yeah and they're
 
03:47:57.269 --> 03:47:57.279 align:start position:0%
scared to death of them and all their
 
03:47:59.590 --> 03:47:59.600 align:start position:0%

realize I was going to be here uh before

that I am here representing chesher 4 in

Kean to speak with you about my proposal
 
04:11:28.870 --> 04:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
to form a study commission around the
 
04:11:30.590 --> 04:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
impact of a public Bank in the state of
 
04:11:30.600 --> 04:11:31.590 align:start position:0%
impact of a public Bank in the state of
New

04:11:31.590 --> 04:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
New
 
04:11:33.870 --> 04:11:33.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire while this bill does not
 
04:11:36.349 --> 04:11:36.359 align:start position:0%
prescribe a specific structure or scope
 
04:11:38.870 --> 04:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
I will be referencing the the benefits
 
04:11:41.790 --> 04:11:41.800 align:start position:0%
uh in existing the existing structure in
 
04:11:44.149 --> 04:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
North Dakota and proposed structure in
 
04:11:46.870 --> 04:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
many states counties and municipalities
 
04:11:47.950 --> 04:11:47.960 align:start position:0%
across the
 
04:11:50.349 --> 04:11:50.359 align:start position:0%
country in discussing the concept of a
 
04:11:52.349 --> 04:11:52.359 align:start position:0%
public bank it's become clear to me that
 
04:11:54.830 --> 04:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
not many people in spite of its uh in
 
04:11:57.429 --> 04:11:57.439 align:start position:0%
spite of the century old Bank of North
 
04:11:59.750 --> 04:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
Dakota and the ongoing efforts to create
 
04:12:02.229 --> 04:12:02.239 align:start position:0%
public banks in many other places folks
 
04:12:04.910 --> 04:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
are not very familiar with the
 
04:12:07.590 --> 04:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
concept yet in so many instances it has
 
04:12:09.710 --> 04:12:09.720 align:start position:0%
occurred to me that a public bank is The
 
04:12:12.750 --> 04:12:12.760 align:start position:0%
Logical solution to managing Financial
 
04:12:15.109 --> 04:12:15.119 align:start position:0%
challenges in our communities with that
 
04:12:17.830 --> 04:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
in mind I'd like to uh share just one
 
04:12:20.469 --> 04:12:20.479 align:start position:0%
example in my own experience that hits
 
04:12:23.109 --> 04:12:23.119 align:start position:0%
very close to home and I think it will
 
04:12:26.030 --> 04:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
illustrate my intention for you at a
 
04:12:27.870 --> 04:12:27.880 align:start position:0%
recent meeting of our regional Planning
 
04:12:30.309 --> 04:12:30.319 align:start position:0%
Commission I listened as representatives
 
04:12:32.710 --> 04:12:32.720 align:start position:0%
of several towns in the area gave
 
04:12:34.469 --> 04:12:34.479 align:start position:0%
updates on the status of both
 
04:12:34.479 --> 04:12:35.670 align:start position:0%
updates on the status of both
infrastructure

04:12:35.670 --> 04:12:35.680 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
04:12:38.990 --> 04:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
improvements uh and damage repairs which
 
04:12:40.510 --> 04:12:40.520 align:start position:0%
were needed in the aftermath of
 
04:12:42.469 --> 04:12:42.479 align:start position:0%
increasingly severe
 
04:12:45.950 --> 04:12:45.960 align:start position:0%
weather the latter I trust is just as
 
04:12:48.590 --> 04:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
acutely uh resonant to each of you as it
 
04:12:50.990 --> 04:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
is to me whether your own Road has
 
04:12:54.590 --> 04:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
washed out or you've seen for example
 
04:12:57.109 --> 04:12:57.119 align:start position:0%
wm's uh recent footage of the historic
 
04:12:59.469 --> 04:12:59.479 align:start position:0%
flooding along our Coastline these
 
04:13:02.790 --> 04:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
repairs in particular are unpredictable
 
04:13:05.750 --> 04:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
unavoidable and extremely costly
 
04:13:08.750 --> 04:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
fortunately as was noted in the meeting
 
04:13:11.710 --> 04:13:11.720 align:start position:0%
uh in the case of natural disasters FEMA
 
04:13:14.309 --> 04:13:14.319 align:start position:0%
can provide relief
 
04:13:16.349 --> 04:13:16.359 align:start position:0%
eventually so that caught my attention
 
04:13:17.910 --> 04:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
so after the meeting I approached one of
 
04:13:19.990 --> 04:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
the folks speaking on this to inquire
 
04:13:22.349 --> 04:13:22.359 align:start position:0%
further as it turns out the process of
 
04:13:25.349 --> 04:13:25.359 align:start position:0%
applying for in receiving FEMA grants is
 
04:13:28.109 --> 04:13:28.119 align:start position:0%
a uh a very lengthy one often leaving
 
04:13:29.510 --> 04:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities waiting for this
 
04:13:31.870 --> 04:13:31.880 align:start position:0%
financial relief for up to two full
 
04:13:34.030 --> 04:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
years of course the residents and
 
04:13:35.870 --> 04:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
businesses in that town can't wait to
 
04:13:37.469 --> 04:13:37.479 align:start position:0%
repair this damage so what do they they
 
04:13:41.389 --> 04:13:41.399 align:start position:0%
do well the the answer they borrow they
 
04:13:44.389 --> 04:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
take out a loan of course to this I
 
04:13:46.030 --> 04:13:46.040 align:start position:0%
asked if FEMA would cover the interest
 
04:13:48.149 --> 04:13:48.159 align:start position:0%
paid on the loans in the interim in the
 
04:13:49.510 --> 04:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
two years where they're
 
04:13:52.630 --> 04:13:52.640 align:start position:0%
waiting um the answer of course not with
 
04:13:55.109 --> 04:13:55.119 align:start position:0%
a little chuckle at the absurdity of my
 
04:13:58.429 --> 04:13:58.439 align:start position:0%
question the notion of absurdity is well
 
04:14:00.269 --> 04:14:00.279 align:start position:0%
taken in the current structure very
 
04:14:02.710 --> 04:14:02.720 align:start position:0%
little is within our control we are left
 
04:14:05.870 --> 04:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
to take the hits compounding expensive
 
04:14:07.630 --> 04:14:07.640 align:start position:0%
uh expenses for a citizen
 
04:14:09.910 --> 04:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
in our efforts to maintain the services
 
04:14:12.670 --> 04:14:12.680 align:start position:0%
we all depend on only to fatten the
 
04:14:15.030 --> 04:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
wallets of the shareholders and CEOs of
 
04:14:16.149 --> 04:14:16.159 align:start position:0%
the big
 
04:14:19.550 --> 04:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
Banks however I would argue given the
 
04:14:23.109 --> 04:14:23.119 align:start position:0%
alternative um of a public Bank where
 
04:14:25.670 --> 04:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
transparency is ensured interest rates
 
04:14:27.870 --> 04:14:27.880 align:start position:0%
are based on the minimum required for
 
04:14:30.790 --> 04:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
operations profit any profit is invested
 
04:14:33.070 --> 04:14:33.080 align:start position:0%
back into our communities and executive
 
04:14:35.030 --> 04:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
salaries while comfortable are
 
04:14:37.109 --> 04:14:37.119 align:start position:0%
determined by a charter that we and new
 
04:14:39.830 --> 04:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire create so while I am not an
 
04:14:41.590 --> 04:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
expert on finance and I don't claim to
 
04:14:44.750 --> 04:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
be I am a rational human being the head
 
04:14:46.950 --> 04:14:46.960 align:start position:0%
of my household and a taxpayer in this
 
04:14:50.510 --> 04:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
state where we are very much um where
 
04:14:52.790 --> 04:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
where we very much pride ourselves on
 
04:14:55.109 --> 04:14:55.119 align:start position:0%
our fiscal responsibility and with that
 
04:14:57.030 --> 04:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
in mind I would ask you to vote in
 
04:14:58.870 --> 04:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
support of a commission that would
 
04:15:00.710 --> 04:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
provide a clear view of what a public
 
04:15:02.309 --> 04:15:02.319 align:start position:0%
Bank could offer to the state of New
 
04:15:03.910 --> 04:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the and the citizens
 
04:15:03.920 --> 04:15:05.990 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the and the citizens
within

04:15:05.990 --> 04:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
within
 
04:15:06.000 --> 04:15:12.149 align:start position:0%
within
it

04:15:12.149 --> 04:15:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:12.159 --> 04:15:14.830 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:15:14.830 --> 04:15:14.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:15:21.550 --> 04:15:21.560 align:start position:0%
um Ling any questions um you did you do
 
04:15:23.349 --> 04:15:23.359 align:start position:0%
any research
 
04:15:27.309 --> 04:15:27.319 align:start position:0%
about the Comm us how many times we've
 
04:15:28.710 --> 04:15:28.720 align:start position:0%
looked at this
 
04:15:32.990 --> 04:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
issue uh yes and I would like to look at
 
04:15:33.000 --> 04:15:34.870 align:start position:0%
issue uh yes and I would like to look at
it

04:15:34.870 --> 04:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:15:37.389 --> 04:15:37.399 align:start position:0%
again I'm I'm sorry can you tell me
 
04:15:39.030 --> 04:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
exactly what you're referencing well I
 
04:15:42.950 --> 04:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
guess is um you know how when we vote a
 
04:15:46.429 --> 04:15:46.439 align:start position:0%
bill you know we have a on the public
 
04:15:48.510 --> 04:15:48.520 align:start position:0%
record you know in the
 
04:15:51.990 --> 04:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
calendar and we would then tell what the
 
04:15:55.429 --> 04:15:55.439 align:start position:0%
commit committee's position on a bill
 
04:15:57.510 --> 04:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
and I was wondering whether you had ever
 
04:16:01.389 --> 04:16:01.399 align:start position:0%
look back at seen because I mean I
 
04:16:03.950 --> 04:16:03.960 align:start position:0%
obviously I'm I'm a bad example that
 
04:16:08.990 --> 04:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:11.790 --> 04:16:11.800 align:start position:0%
but this is like you know the sixth time
 
04:16:13.590 --> 04:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
we've had this issue in front of this
 
04:16:16.189 --> 04:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
committee so I was just wondering if you
 
04:16:18.670 --> 04:16:18.680 align:start position:0%
actually look back at the last couple of
 
04:16:21.710 --> 04:16:21.720 align:start position:0%
times we've done this and why the
 
04:16:24.349 --> 04:16:24.359 align:start position:0%
committee has decided not to pass this
 
04:16:27.550 --> 04:16:27.560 align:start position:0%
legislation I followed the bill last
 
04:16:27.560 --> 04:16:30.189 align:start position:0%
legislation I followed the bill last
year

04:16:30.189 --> 04:16:30.199 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:16:33.510 --> 04:16:33.520 align:start position:0%
so okay I saw that you voted against
 
04:16:35.750 --> 04:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
it and do you remember thanks for your
 
04:16:37.710 --> 04:16:37.720 align:start position:0%
time you remember what what we wrote in
 
04:16:40.149 --> 04:16:40.159 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
04:16:42.429 --> 04:16:42.439 align:start position:0%
report why why
 
04:16:45.030 --> 04:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
we didn't go forward with this
 
04:16:46.910 --> 04:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
legislation well this is a study
 
04:16:48.550 --> 04:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
committee but why we
 
04:16:51.189 --> 04:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
never we've gone forward with this issue
 
04:16:53.389 --> 04:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
have you would you like to tell
 
04:16:58.710 --> 04:16:58.720 align:start position:0%
me uh uh I could you don't need to it's
 
04:17:02.790 --> 04:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
it's okay clearly um thank you for your
 
04:17:05.070 --> 04:17:05.080 align:start position:0%
time uh we do have another question if
 
04:17:07.309 --> 04:17:07.319 align:start position:0%
you want to take a question
 
04:17:09.950 --> 04:17:09.960 align:start position:0%
representative Herbert um I'm a little
 
04:17:12.670 --> 04:17:12.680 align:start position:0%
familiar with public um i' I've
 
04:17:15.349 --> 04:17:15.359 align:start position:0%
researched it and it's very difficult to
 
04:17:19.590 --> 04:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
get uh uh in this particular environment
 
04:17:21.590 --> 04:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh a fair
 
04:17:25.510 --> 04:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
hearing and uh for example the public
 
04:17:29.590 --> 04:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
Bank of North Dakota which started in
 
04:17:32.229 --> 04:17:32.239 align:start position:0%
1919 and it was as a result it was an
 
04:17:35.109 --> 04:17:35.119 align:start position:0%
Agriculture state but it the resulting
 
04:17:37.070 --> 04:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
problem that they were trying to solve
 
04:17:38.469 --> 04:17:38.479 align:start position:0%
was the fact that they couldn't get
 
04:17:40.830 --> 04:17:40.840 align:start position:0%
access to Transportation because the the
 
04:17:43.070 --> 04:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
transportation system was owned by other
 
04:17:45.950 --> 04:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
people who were not interested and so as
 
04:17:48.229 --> 04:17:48.239 align:start position:0%
a result of that they went around the
 
04:17:51.670 --> 04:17:51.680 align:start position:0%
farmers did and uh legislated a public
 
04:17:54.670 --> 04:17:54.680 align:start position:0%
bank and it's one of the best run banks
 
04:17:57.030 --> 04:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
in the United States it's it's its
 
04:18:00.670 --> 04:18:00.680 align:start position:0%
record is remarkable and one of the one
 
04:18:03.389 --> 04:18:03.399 align:start position:0%
of the nicest things about a public
 
04:18:08.469 --> 04:18:08.479 align:start position:0%
bank is that it helps a lot of a lot of
 
04:18:10.990 --> 04:18:11.000 align:start position:0%
City Banks or small Municipal Banks and
 
04:18:15.229 --> 04:18:15.239 align:start position:0%
Credit Unions because it can once it's
 
04:18:18.070 --> 04:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
once it's in business it can actually
 
04:18:20.710 --> 04:18:20.720 align:start position:0%
add or expand the amount of money
 
04:18:24.349 --> 04:18:24.359 align:start position:0%
available to the uh citizens and and as
 
04:18:25.510 --> 04:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
you pointed
 
04:18:29.710 --> 04:18:29.720 align:start position:0%
out much more quickly than FEMA and so
 
04:18:32.389 --> 04:18:32.399 align:start position:0%
as a result of that I was in favor at
 
04:18:36.550 --> 04:18:36.560 align:start position:0%
that point in time of uh having a study
 
04:18:40.030 --> 04:18:40.040 align:start position:0%
of an honest study of uh banking public
 
04:18:42.469 --> 04:18:42.479 align:start position:0%
banking because public banking is about
 
04:18:45.910 --> 04:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
40% of all the banking in the
 
04:18:48.630 --> 04:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
world now the fact that the United
 
04:18:52.349 --> 04:18:52.359 align:start position:0%
States has one bank and it's obviously a
 
04:18:55.990 --> 04:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
great bank but there is no uh political
 
04:19:00.510 --> 04:19:00.520 align:start position:0%
support or it's suppressed to have the
 
04:19:03.269 --> 04:19:03.279 align:start position:0%
people get to vote on whether or not we
 
04:19:04.910 --> 04:19:04.920 align:start position:0%
should have a public
 
04:19:08.750 --> 04:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
bank so it gets in the butt and it gets
 
04:19:11.710 --> 04:19:11.720 align:start position:0%
nipped in the butt all the time and
 
04:19:14.229 --> 04:19:14.239 align:start position:0%
that's because the existing political
 
04:19:18.189 --> 04:19:18.199 align:start position:0%
leadership is against it so don't take
 
04:19:18.199 --> 04:19:19.670 align:start position:0%
leadership is against it so don't take
it

04:19:19.670 --> 04:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:19:23.229 --> 04:19:23.239 align:start position:0%
personal you know if it's
 
04:19:26.269 --> 04:19:26.279 align:start position:0%
politics beginning and end and it's very
 
04:19:26.279 --> 04:19:27.790 align:start position:0%
politics beginning and end and it's very
difficult

04:19:27.790 --> 04:19:27.800 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
04:19:31.870 --> 04:19:31.880 align:start position:0%
to uh it's very difficult to
 
04:19:34.030 --> 04:19:34.040 align:start position:0%
uh have this
 
04:19:37.269 --> 04:19:37.279 align:start position:0%
legislation uh accepted or were actually
 
04:19:40.630 --> 04:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
seriously considered last time around
 
04:19:42.189 --> 04:19:42.199 align:start position:0%
they went ran up to Dartmouth and they
 
04:19:47.750 --> 04:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
got a Rockefeller to uh uh fund a a an
 
04:19:49.670 --> 04:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
essay basically it was an essay it
 
04:19:52.750 --> 04:19:52.760 align:start position:0%
wasn't economics document that it
 
04:19:56.109 --> 04:19:56.119 align:start position:0%
wouldn't work and I read it and I'm
 
04:19:59.670 --> 04:19:59.680 align:start position:0%
thinking this doesn't say anything so
 
04:20:01.950 --> 04:20:01.960 align:start position:0%
you have one vote here all right thank
 
04:20:04.389 --> 04:20:04.399 align:start position:0%
you and uh I think you should get a
 
04:20:06.950 --> 04:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
chance to see if you you can EXP expand
 
04:20:08.790 --> 04:20:08.800 align:start position:0%
that because I like the way you
 
04:20:11.309 --> 04:20:11.319 align:start position:0%
presented it and I like the way you
 
04:20:14.710 --> 04:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
responded to some of the comments uh of
 
04:20:17.109 --> 04:20:17.119 align:start position:0%
the chair thank you Mr chair thank you I
 
04:20:18.710 --> 04:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
appreciate your kindness and and
 
04:20:18.720 --> 04:20:19.830 align:start position:0%
appreciate your kindness and and
civility

04:20:19.830 --> 04:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
civility
 
04:20:21.870 --> 04:20:21.880 align:start position:0%
honestly thank you representative
 
04:20:24.790 --> 04:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
buroughs um this is a would you believe
 
04:20:26.030 --> 04:20:26.040 align:start position:0%
uh would you
 
04:20:29.269 --> 04:20:29.279 align:start position:0%
believe representative Herbert that um
 
04:20:31.510 --> 04:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of this not being a fair
 
04:20:33.349 --> 04:20:33.359 align:start position:0%
getting a fair hearing I think that this
 
04:20:35.790 --> 04:20:35.800 align:start position:0%
is probably the most bipartisan
 
04:20:37.910 --> 04:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
committee if not the most it is one of
 
04:20:40.149 --> 04:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
the most bipartisan committees in in
 
04:20:42.269 --> 04:20:42.279 align:start position:0%
this house and I think that all bills
 
04:20:44.149 --> 04:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
get a fair hearing thank
 
04:20:47.149 --> 04:20:47.159 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
04:20:49.830 --> 04:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
Ammon thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:20:52.830 --> 04:20:52.840 align:start position:0%
your testimony today um I guess this is
 
04:20:55.469 --> 04:20:55.479 align:start position:0%
a would you believe just uh because we
 
04:20:58.189 --> 04:20:58.199 align:start position:0%
had we have studied this issue before um
 
04:20:59.830 --> 04:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
one of the would you believe one of the
 
04:21:02.109 --> 04:21:02.119 align:start position:0%
objections to this is that it would take
 
04:21:04.710 --> 04:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
a very long time for the bank to become
 
04:21:07.030 --> 04:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
profitable and and because banking is
 
04:21:09.109 --> 04:21:09.119 align:start position:0%
such a competitive industry there's a
 
04:21:11.750 --> 04:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
large uh chance that it could fail and
 
04:21:13.630 --> 04:21:13.640 align:start position:0%
if it fails the taxpayers would be on
 
04:21:16.269 --> 04:21:16.279 align:start position:0%
the hook for cleaning it cleaning up the
 
04:21:18.550 --> 04:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
the problem so in the past as we've
 
04:21:20.349 --> 04:21:20.359 align:start position:0%
looked into this issue that that's the
 
04:21:22.309 --> 04:21:22.319 align:start position:0%
main objection to it and I just want to
 
04:21:24.189 --> 04:21:24.199 align:start position:0%
communicate that to you thanks yeah I
 
04:21:25.910 --> 04:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
just I apologize I did have someone else
 
04:21:27.389 --> 04:21:27.399 align:start position:0%
who was going to be here and speak and
 
04:21:29.349 --> 04:21:29.359 align:start position:0%
they had a death from the family so
 
04:21:33.710 --> 04:21:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:36.790 --> 04:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
me representative spear this is also
 
04:21:39.429 --> 04:21:39.439 align:start position:0%
would you believe the uh president of
 
04:21:43.309 --> 04:21:43.319 align:start position:0%
the Utah BL the Dakota uh bank had
 
04:21:45.990 --> 04:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
written a paper a few years ago and he
 
04:21:48.910 --> 04:21:48.920 align:start position:0%
said it would cost approximately $100
 
04:21:52.910 --> 04:21:52.920 align:start position:0%
million to start up a bank a public bank
 
04:21:54.750 --> 04:21:54.760 align:start position:0%
they were able to do it back a hundred
 
04:21:56.870 --> 04:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
years ago because it didn't take that
 
04:21:59.149 --> 04:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
amount of money today he said and you
 
04:22:01.590 --> 04:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
have to run it like a regular bank and
 
04:22:03.389 --> 04:22:03.399 align:start position:0%
this was from North Dakota they said it
 
04:22:05.469 --> 04:22:05.479 align:start position:0%
themselves this is not an easy thing to
 
04:22:07.269 --> 04:22:07.279 align:start position:0%
start up and I don't think we have a
 
04:22:09.309 --> 04:22:09.319 align:start position:0%
hundred, hundred million dollars to do
 
04:22:11.830 --> 04:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
it but the other thing he pointed out
 
04:22:15.309 --> 04:22:15.319 align:start position:0%
that John uh our chairman pointed out
 
04:22:17.750 --> 04:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
was that a lot of the things that public
 
04:22:21.070 --> 04:22:21.080 align:start position:0%
Banks do we have in facilities and you
 
04:22:23.349 --> 04:22:23.359 align:start position:0%
you can describe that but uh having
 
04:22:25.790 --> 04:22:25.800 align:start position:0%
facilities in our banks already and I
 
04:22:27.309 --> 04:22:27.319 align:start position:0%
think that maybe a few words about that
 
04:22:31.389 --> 04:22:31.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:34.510 --> 04:22:34.520 align:start position:0%
helpful okay so yeah so in terms of what
 
04:22:37.710 --> 04:22:37.720 align:start position:0%
the State Bank in North Dakota does
 
04:22:39.790 --> 04:22:39.800 align:start position:0%
which notwithstanding its initial
 
04:22:43.030 --> 04:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
purpose was agricultural loans and
 
04:22:45.030 --> 04:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
fortunately we actually have a bank here
 
04:22:48.109 --> 04:22:48.119 align:start position:0%
in conquer that does agricultural loans
 
04:22:50.910 --> 04:22:50.920 align:start position:0%
but not withstanding um it's the
 
04:22:52.670 --> 04:22:52.680 align:start position:0%
business Finance
 
04:22:55.510 --> 04:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
Authority and um actually they changed
 
04:22:57.670 --> 04:22:57.680 align:start position:0%
their name so I I I kept trying to
 
04:23:00.030 --> 04:23:00.040 align:start position:0%
remember the name because I heard it but
 
04:23:02.790 --> 04:23:02.800 align:start position:0%
uh the student loans it used to be nefa
 
04:23:05.870 --> 04:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
but it's now called something else but
 
04:23:08.309 --> 04:23:08.319 align:start position:0%
that we in terms of giving facilitating
 
04:23:10.189 --> 04:23:10.199 align:start position:0%
student loans these are all the things
 
04:23:13.870 --> 04:23:13.880 align:start position:0%
that the North Dakota State Bank does so
 
04:23:16.830 --> 04:23:16.840 align:start position:0%
we do have the facilities that provide
 
04:23:19.109 --> 04:23:19.119 align:start position:0%
all the same services that the the State
 
04:23:22.910 --> 04:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
Bank provides but in terms of um when I
 
04:23:22.920 --> 04:23:24.389 align:start position:0%
Bank provides but in terms of um when I
read

04:23:24.389 --> 04:23:24.399 align:start position:0%
read
 
04:23:28.429 --> 04:23:28.439 align:start position:0%
your uh Vision in terms of the study
 
04:23:32.309 --> 04:23:32.319 align:start position:0%
committee um you know is that
 
04:23:35.269 --> 04:23:35.279 align:start position:0%
um the the
 
04:23:35.279 --> 04:23:38.469 align:start position:0%
um the the
um

04:23:38.469 --> 04:23:38.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:42.030 --> 04:23:42.040 align:start position:0%
uh for the purpose of uh excuse me the
 
04:23:44.950 --> 04:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
duties uh transparency and public
 
04:23:49.710 --> 04:23:49.720 align:start position:0%
benefit of a public Bank um obviously
 
04:23:52.710 --> 04:23:52.720 align:start position:0%
your perception is that um we want a
 
04:23:55.590 --> 04:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
bank that has that's more public about
 
04:23:58.389 --> 04:23:58.399 align:start position:0%
what it does and how it makes its loans
 
04:24:01.189 --> 04:24:01.199 align:start position:0%
and whether you know it it's not
 
04:24:06.990 --> 04:24:07.000 align:start position:0%
secretive or something but um so uh
 
04:24:10.309 --> 04:24:10.319 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day you know you the
 
04:24:14.510 --> 04:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
goal of a bank you know is to make loans
 
04:24:17.189 --> 04:24:17.199 align:start position:0%
that are hope you know to for the
 
04:24:19.389 --> 04:24:19.399 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire and I would
 
04:24:21.830 --> 04:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
think that all our banks do do that
 
04:24:25.030 --> 04:24:25.040 align:start position:0%
whether they um as public or transparent
 
04:24:28.790 --> 04:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
as you would like um I'm not sure
 
04:24:31.670 --> 04:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
creating a uh a public bank is is going
 
04:24:35.590 --> 04:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
to get you there so but in the end of
 
04:24:36.870 --> 04:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
the day
 
04:24:39.309 --> 04:24:39.319 align:start position:0%
when you ask me the question is why is
 
04:24:42.670 --> 04:24:42.680 align:start position:0%
this never got off the ground was the
 
04:24:46.790 --> 04:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
startup cost that you uh for to create a
 
04:24:50.349 --> 04:24:50.359 align:start position:0%
bank today you know you need hard money
 
04:24:52.910 --> 04:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
Hard Cash you can't bond for it you
 
04:24:54.910 --> 04:24:54.920 align:start position:0%
can't borrow for it you have to you
 
04:24:56.790 --> 04:24:56.800 align:start position:0%
would have the state would have to put
 
04:25:01.070 --> 04:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
in serious money um and you know whether
 
04:25:03.590 --> 04:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
the 100,000 seems a little on the 100
 
04:25:05.830 --> 04:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
million was a little 100 million seems
 
04:25:09.710 --> 04:25:09.720 align:start position:0%
on the high side my my memory was uh the
 
04:25:12.389 --> 04:25:12.399 align:start position:0%
the the banking commissioner said it was
 
04:25:13.990 --> 04:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
it's at least 10
 
04:25:17.910 --> 04:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
million um to to start a bank but but
 
04:25:20.750 --> 04:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
sorry this was the uh gentleman from the
 
04:25:23.149 --> 04:25:23.159 align:start position:0%
bank president of North D who said 100
 
04:25:26.269 --> 04:25:26.279 align:start position:0%
million uh what our local folks said I I
 
04:25:29.030 --> 04:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
I don't remember so any so um our our
 
04:25:32.189 --> 04:25:32.199 align:start position:0%
bank commissioner said that based on our
 
04:25:34.030 --> 04:25:34.040 align:start position:0%
laws to the state of New Hampshire that
 
04:25:36.149 --> 04:25:36.159 align:start position:0%
you know it it would be at least 10
 
04:25:39.550 --> 04:25:39.560 align:start position:0%
million doll so for the state to to get
 
04:25:42.389 --> 04:25:42.399 align:start position:0%
it off the ground thank
 
04:25:45.269 --> 04:25:45.279 align:start position:0%
you representative Herbert would like to
 
04:25:47.229 --> 04:25:47.239 align:start position:0%
speak again and I hope you won't throw
 
04:25:50.109 --> 04:25:50.119 align:start position:0%
me under the bus a second
 
04:25:55.349 --> 04:25:55.359 align:start position:0%
time so uh you know bus throwing is not
 
04:26:00.349 --> 04:26:00.359 align:start position:0%
a skill of mine but uh the um I am I
 
04:26:04.070 --> 04:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
would be interested in knowing uh what
 
04:26:08.030 --> 04:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
are um ability to
 
04:26:11.670 --> 04:26:11.680 align:start position:0%
fund is uh another bank so in other
 
04:26:15.309 --> 04:26:15.319 align:start position:0%
words is there uh liquidity in this
 
04:26:19.670 --> 04:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
state that can actually fund the startup
 
04:26:23.950 --> 04:26:23.960 align:start position:0%
of a uh public bank and my suspicion is
 
04:26:28.389 --> 04:26:28.399 align:start position:0%
that there is plenty of liquidity and uh
 
04:26:32.309 --> 04:26:32.319 align:start position:0%
and it's just political will so if it
 
04:26:35.189 --> 04:26:35.199 align:start position:0%
was real popular if people realized all
 
04:26:38.309 --> 04:26:38.319 align:start position:0%
the benefits a public bank has over
 
04:26:40.429 --> 04:26:40.439 align:start position:0%
private Banks and there are a number of
 
04:26:43.309 --> 04:26:43.319 align:start position:0%
them the the political will would be
 
04:26:46.070 --> 04:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
different but it's very difficult under
 
04:26:49.550 --> 04:26:49.560 align:start position:0%
the current legislature and and our
 
04:26:52.030 --> 04:26:52.040 align:start position:0%
legislature is traditionally pretty
 
04:26:55.349 --> 04:26:55.359 align:start position:0%
conservative um it's very difficult to
 
04:26:59.550 --> 04:26:59.560 align:start position:0%
to get the uh the mo the impetus or any
 
04:27:03.630 --> 04:27:03.640 align:start position:0%
kind of honest uh session I mean 1919
 
04:27:06.389 --> 04:27:06.399 align:start position:0%
was a long time ago it was different
 
04:27:09.750 --> 04:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
back then but they managed to do it a
 
04:27:12.109 --> 04:27:12.119 align:start position:0%
bunch of farmers and now I'm sitting
 
04:27:14.590 --> 04:27:14.600 align:start position:0%
here saying but we can't do it in New
 
04:27:17.790 --> 04:27:17.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for somehow we're not capable
 
04:27:20.870 --> 04:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
of creating a public bank and and it's
 
04:27:23.630 --> 04:27:23.640 align:start position:0%
just political will we have the money we
 
04:27:25.510 --> 04:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
have the ability we certainly have the
 
04:27:28.750 --> 04:27:28.760 align:start position:0%
talent we were even told today that
 
04:27:33.149 --> 04:27:33.159 align:start position:0%
there is a sort of bank for agriculture
 
04:27:33.159 --> 04:27:34.510 align:start position:0%
there is a sort of bank for agriculture
already

04:27:34.510 --> 04:27:34.520 align:start position:0%
already
 
04:27:36.670 --> 04:27:36.680 align:start position:0%
here but that as far as you're going to
 
04:27:39.109 --> 04:27:39.119 align:start position:0%
go and and I would I would support a
 
04:27:41.550 --> 04:27:41.560 align:start position:0%
committee I would support somebody doing
 
04:27:45.550 --> 04:27:45.560 align:start position:0%
some serious work uh on both sides in a
 
04:27:49.109 --> 04:27:49.119 align:start position:0%
bipartisan fashion and uh see what what
 
04:27:52.389 --> 04:27:52.399 align:start position:0%
comes out in the facts not normatives
 
04:27:55.710 --> 04:27:55.720 align:start position:0%
what's the data and I'm I'm positive the
 
04:27:58.910 --> 04:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
data and the facts make a very good case
 
04:28:04.830 --> 04:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:04.840 --> 04:28:07.309 align:start position:0%
 
here

04:28:07.309 --> 04:28:07.319 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:28:09.429 --> 04:28:09.439 align:start position:0%
I guess that's a would you believe uh
 
04:28:09.439 --> 04:28:11.229 align:start position:0%
I guess that's a would you believe uh
representative

04:28:11.229 --> 04:28:11.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:28:14.030 --> 04:28:14.040 align:start position:0%
taon so I'm I'm going to take this under
 
04:28:16.550 --> 04:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
the category of would you believe I just
 
04:28:19.389 --> 04:28:19.399 align:start position:0%
forwarded an article to the
 
04:28:22.790 --> 04:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
committee uh regarding Banking and new H
 
04:28:25.229 --> 04:28:25.239 align:start position:0%
would you believe that New Hampshire is
 
04:28:31.070 --> 04:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
the third most accessible state for
 
04:28:33.950 --> 04:28:33.960 align:start position:0%
Banking and who who who made that
 
04:28:36.790 --> 04:28:36.800 align:start position:0%
judgment forb Forbes magazine Maine is
 
04:28:40.750 --> 04:28:40.760 align:start position:0%
first permont is second New Hampshire is
 
04:28:43.790 --> 04:28:43.800 align:start position:0%
third the worst state South
 
04:28:47.469 --> 04:28:47.479 align:start position:0%
Carolina uh and Breer would you believe
 
04:28:49.189 --> 04:28:49.199 align:start position:0%
that when you take into consideration
 
04:28:50.670 --> 04:28:50.680 align:start position:0%
things like the New Hampshire Housing
 
04:28:55.750 --> 04:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
Finance Authority the uh agricultural
 
04:28:59.229 --> 04:28:59.239 align:start position:0%
Bank we the state of New Hampshire which
 
04:29:02.910 --> 04:29:02.920 align:start position:0%
has always led the country in
 
04:29:06.950 --> 04:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
banking um and solvency
 
04:29:09.389 --> 04:29:09.399 align:start position:0%
has there's very little what's the
 
04:29:11.590 --> 04:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
problem we're solving and I suspect that
 
04:29:14.109 --> 04:29:14.119 align:start position:0%
the reason this may have not move
 
04:29:16.469 --> 04:29:16.479 align:start position:0%
forward in a highly competitive industry
 
04:29:18.389 --> 04:29:18.399 align:start position:0%
like banking which operates on a very
 
04:29:18.399 --> 04:29:19.429 align:start position:0%
like banking which operates on a very
small

04:29:19.429 --> 04:29:19.439 align:start position:0%
small
 
04:29:22.790 --> 04:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
margin uh there's there's very little
 
04:29:26.109 --> 04:29:26.119 align:start position:0%
profit and very little benefit so that's
 
04:29:28.309 --> 04:29:28.319 align:start position:0%
my would you
 
04:29:28.319 --> 04:29:31.910 align:start position:0%
my would you
believe

04:29:31.910 --> 04:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:36.149 --> 04:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
okay Representatives thank you thank you
 
04:29:37.469 --> 04:29:37.479 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thanks for taking your
 
04:29:39.030 --> 04:29:39.040 align:start position:0%
testimony and putting it in the light
 
04:29:43.469 --> 04:29:43.479 align:start position:0%
you did uh I appreciate that so one of
 
04:29:46.630 --> 04:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
the tools that I'm learning to use since
 
04:29:48.550 --> 04:29:48.560 align:start position:0%
I came back to the legislature after a
 
04:29:51.750 --> 04:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
22-year absence is that search search
 
04:29:53.790 --> 04:29:53.800 align:start position:0%
tool that I think representative
 
04:29:56.030 --> 04:29:56.040 align:start position:0%
chairman Hunton was referring to um
 
04:29:59.030 --> 04:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
it'll turn up for for next time or for
 
04:30:00.630 --> 04:30:00.640 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work session and every bill
 
04:30:02.990 --> 04:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
goes to subcommittee here um there's
 
04:30:06.429 --> 04:30:06.439 align:start position:0%
about six other uh almost
 
04:30:08.429 --> 04:30:08.439 align:start position:0%
identical pieces of legislation that
 
04:30:09.750 --> 04:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
have come to this committee had a
 
04:30:12.389 --> 04:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
hearing have testimony some might even I
 
04:30:14.630 --> 04:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
don't think we had YouTube in 2019
 
04:30:15.870 --> 04:30:15.880 align:start position:0%
because I think that was the most recent
 
04:30:17.590 --> 04:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
one but there's a huge amount of
 
04:30:19.910 --> 04:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
information about every other Fair
 
04:30:22.229 --> 04:30:22.239 align:start position:0%
hearing that was here so my question is
 
04:30:23.750 --> 04:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
did you happen to did you know about
 
04:30:25.269 --> 04:30:25.279 align:start position:0%
that because I just learned about it and
 
04:30:26.990 --> 04:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
I'm still figuring out the advanced
 
04:30:29.109 --> 04:30:29.119 align:start position:0%
search which is a lot different than
 
04:30:31.389 --> 04:30:31.399 align:start position:0%
like the simple search so it's a little
 
04:30:33.870 --> 04:30:33.880 align:start position:0%
tricky to find them um in fact it took
 
04:30:35.469 --> 04:30:35.479 align:start position:0%
me a while here just to do it to do it
 
04:30:38.910 --> 04:30:38.920 align:start position:0%
now now um but that'll that'll help and
 
04:30:41.269 --> 04:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
it'll might might push push the
 
04:30:42.469 --> 04:30:42.479 align:start position:0%
committee in the right direction if you
 
04:30:47.070 --> 04:30:47.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:51.790 --> 04:30:51.800 align:start position:0%
believe okay thank you very
 
04:30:55.229 --> 04:30:55.239 align:start position:0%
much uh I have one other card uh Ryan
 
04:31:04.550 --> 04:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:04.560 --> 04:31:07.710 align:start position:0%
 
Association

04:31:07.710 --> 04:31:07.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:09.630 --> 04:31:09.640 align:start position:0%
good afternoon I'll try not to take up
 
04:31:11.309 --> 04:31:11.319 align:start position:0%
uh too much of the committee's time I a
 
04:31:13.710 --> 04:31:13.720 align:start position:0%
lot of the points um committee members
 
04:31:15.870 --> 04:31:15.880 align:start position:0%
have already made in my testimony but
 
04:31:18.070 --> 04:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
again for the record uh my name is Ryan
 
04:31:19.750 --> 04:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
hail vice president of government
 
04:31:21.870 --> 04:31:21.880 align:start position:0%
relations for New Hampshire Bankers we
 
04:31:23.870 --> 04:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
represent 40 member banks that employ
 
04:31:27.389 --> 04:31:27.399 align:start position:0%
roughly 60,000 employees um you're right
 
04:31:29.990 --> 04:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
this uh this issue has come before um
 
04:31:32.229 --> 04:31:32.239 align:start position:0%
this committee um this will be I believe
 
04:31:34.309 --> 04:31:34.319 align:start position:0%
the seventh time last year was the sixth
 
04:31:36.750 --> 04:31:36.760 align:start position:0%
time um and I want to point to I believe
 
04:31:40.070 --> 04:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
it's 2017 where there was a bill that
 
04:31:43.750 --> 04:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
went to inum um referred to inum study
 
04:31:46.510 --> 04:31:46.520 align:start position:0%
and I think the committee met five or
 
04:31:49.269 --> 04:31:49.279 align:start position:0%
maybe six times um and the
 
04:31:54.269 --> 04:31:54.279 align:start position:0%
recommendation was uh uh for no further
 
04:31:57.750 --> 04:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
legislation um all the proposals uh
 
04:32:01.030 --> 04:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
beyond that have either um have received
 
04:32:02.950 --> 04:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
inex overwhelming inexpedient to
 
04:32:04.910 --> 04:32:04.920 align:start position:0%
legislate recommendations including last
 
04:32:07.229 --> 04:32:07.239 align:start position:0%
year which which was an 18 to1 vote with
 
04:32:10.670 --> 04:32:10.680 align:start position:0%
a Voice vote on the house floor
 
04:32:14.149 --> 04:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
um in my testimony that I have submitted
 
04:32:17.189 --> 04:32:17.199 align:start position:0%
uh I've put in there uh questions that
 
04:32:20.229 --> 04:32:20.239 align:start position:0%
we raised last year um along with our
 
04:32:22.389 --> 04:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
answers the first one is there a need
 
04:32:26.630 --> 04:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
for a public Bank uh FDIC has uh had a
 
04:32:29.590 --> 04:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
did a survey in 2021 of unbanked or
 
04:32:32.510 --> 04:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
underbanked households uh New Hampshire
 
04:32:36.429 --> 04:32:36.439 align:start position:0%
I believe came in fourth uh uh lowest uh
 
04:32:36.439 --> 04:32:37.429 align:start position:0%
I believe came in fourth uh uh lowest uh
at

04:32:37.429 --> 04:32:37.439 align:start position:0%
at
 
04:32:40.630 --> 04:32:40.640 align:start position:0%
1.4% um we have a very banked population
 
04:32:43.469 --> 04:32:43.479 align:start position:0%
here in uh New Hampshire uh we also have
 
04:32:46.469 --> 04:32:46.479 align:start position:0%
a thriving banking industry uh here we
 
04:32:48.189 --> 04:32:48.199 align:start position:0%
have I believe in the past 10 years
 
04:32:50.550 --> 04:32:50.560 align:start position:0%
three new Banks uh that have gone
 
04:32:52.990 --> 04:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
through denovo
 
04:32:55.870 --> 04:32:55.880 align:start position:0%
um will these the other question I pose
 
04:32:57.550 --> 04:32:57.560 align:start position:0%
is Will These funds be
 
04:33:00.269 --> 04:33:00.279 align:start position:0%
ured the past proposals were silent
 
04:33:03.389 --> 04:33:03.399 align:start position:0%
whether or not this bank would need FDIC
 
04:33:05.429 --> 04:33:05.439 align:start position:0%
Insurance think representative Ammon you
 
04:33:08.470 --> 04:33:08.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh you alluded to this if a
 
04:33:11.910 --> 04:33:11.920 align:start position:0%
state bank was to uh capitalize was to
 
04:33:14.910 --> 04:33:14.920 align:start position:0%
be established and eventually failed who
 
04:33:18.189 --> 04:33:18.199 align:start position:0%
would be on the who would be um on the
 
04:33:20.750 --> 04:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
hook for that failure you know we can
 
04:33:23.109 --> 04:33:23.119 align:start position:0%
look to Delaware in the 70s where they
 
04:33:24.789 --> 04:33:24.799 align:start position:0%
had a state bank that failed and the
 
04:33:26.349 --> 04:33:26.359 align:start position:0%
taxpayers were on the hook for hundred
 
04:33:29.029 --> 04:33:29.039 align:start position:0%
million dollar hundreds of millions of
 
04:33:31.830 --> 04:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
dollars um and then again the committee
 
04:33:33.029 --> 04:33:33.039 align:start position:0%
uh members on the committee alluded to
 
04:33:34.990 --> 04:33:35.000 align:start position:0%
this how will this Bank be capitalized
 
04:33:37.029 --> 04:33:37.039 align:start position:0%
uh p proposals fiscal notes showed it
 
04:33:40.150 --> 04:33:40.160 align:start position:0%
would need $50 million um the Nelson a
 
04:33:42.750 --> 04:33:42.760 align:start position:0%
Rockefeller Center at Dartmouth back in
 
04:33:45.869 --> 04:33:45.879 align:start position:0%
2016 uh did uh looked at this they said
 
04:33:48.789 --> 04:33:48.799 align:start position:0%
63 million in California though much
 
04:33:51.029 --> 04:33:51.039 align:start position:0%
larger landscape and more narrow scope
 
04:33:53.590 --> 04:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
study it looked at a state bank for the
 
04:33:56.230 --> 04:33:56.240 align:start position:0%
marijuana industry um they said a
 
04:33:57.990 --> 04:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
billion dollars in capital and the bank
 
04:34:00.109 --> 04:34:00.119 align:start position:0%
would lose money for 12 years and the
 
04:34:02.230 --> 04:34:02.240 align:start position:0%
state would not see net dividends for 25
 
04:34:05.349 --> 04:34:05.359 align:start position:0%
to 30 years after it was established so
 
04:34:07.590 --> 04:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
in closing uh again the issue of
 
04:34:09.349 --> 04:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
establishing a state bank has been
 
04:34:11.349 --> 04:34:11.359 align:start position:0%
sufficiently studied and debated over
 
04:34:14.189 --> 04:34:14.199 align:start position:0%
the years um and every time it comes up
 
04:34:16.750 --> 04:34:16.760 align:start position:0%
the legislature has decided it's not
 
04:34:18.269 --> 04:34:18.279 align:start position:0%
right for New Hampshire so therefore I
 
04:34:20.349 --> 04:34:20.359 align:start position:0%
respectfully ask the committee to again
 
04:34:22.510 --> 04:34:22.520 align:start position:0%
vote inexpedient to legislate thank you
 
04:34:27.869 --> 04:34:27.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:30.230 --> 04:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
questions representative Herbert has a
 
04:34:33.349 --> 04:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
question for you uh this is not a
 
04:34:36.750 --> 04:34:36.760 align:start position:0%
a private banking in New Hampshire is uh
 
04:34:40.269 --> 04:34:40.279 align:start position:0%
successful MH not even questioning that
 
04:34:43.590 --> 04:34:43.600 align:start position:0%
but there have been uh certain uh times
 
04:34:46.189 --> 04:34:46.199 align:start position:0%
and periods of times U the last one I
 
04:34:48.070 --> 04:34:48.080 align:start position:0%
can remember was I think was called The
 
04:34:52.029 --> 04:34:52.039 align:start position:0%
Savings and Loan crisis which is from my
 
04:34:56.789 --> 04:34:56.799 align:start position:0%
opinion uh or no my recollection is just
 
04:34:56.799 --> 04:34:58.230 align:start position:0%
opinion uh or no my recollection is just
about

04:34:58.230 --> 04:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:35:02.789 --> 04:35:02.799 align:start position:0%
every Bank in New Hampshire
 
04:35:06.750 --> 04:35:06.760 align:start position:0%
failed hamis
 
04:35:09.510 --> 04:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
gone um
 
04:35:13.070 --> 04:35:13.080 align:start position:0%
Merchants gone indan is saving Indian
 
04:35:13.080 --> 04:35:14.990 align:start position:0%
Merchants gone indan is saving Indian
Head

04:35:14.990 --> 04:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
Head
 
04:35:15.000 --> 04:35:16.629 align:start position:0%
Head
Gone

04:35:16.629 --> 04:35:16.639 align:start position:0%
Gone
 
04:35:19.429 --> 04:35:19.439 align:start position:0%
um I can't go through the whole list but
 
04:35:21.949 --> 04:35:21.959 align:start position:0%
every one of them except for who was the
 
04:35:24.990 --> 04:35:25.000 align:start position:0%
governor's Bank back then I have two of
 
04:35:27.910 --> 04:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
those anyway there was one bank I do you
 
04:35:30.910 --> 04:35:30.920 align:start position:0%
know the bank that the governor uh I
 
04:35:32.070 --> 04:35:32.080 align:start position:0%
don't know the bank but I think you're
 
04:35:34.830 --> 04:35:34.840 align:start position:0%
referring to back in the early 90s when
 
04:35:37.029 --> 04:35:37.039 align:start position:0%
yeah sure it was a nashille bank but it
 
04:35:41.470 --> 04:35:41.480 align:start position:0%
was uh it survived Y and my point is
 
04:35:43.629 --> 04:35:43.639 align:start position:0%
during that same Savings in loan which
 
04:35:47.789 --> 04:35:47.799 align:start position:0%
was a national problem the Bank of North
 
04:35:52.349 --> 04:35:52.359 align:start position:0%
Dakota was one of the best to survive so
 
04:35:53.789 --> 04:35:53.799 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying we don't have good
 
04:35:56.429 --> 04:35:56.439 align:start position:0%
banking here in this state because we do
 
04:35:59.429 --> 04:35:59.439 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying is that a public bank
 
04:36:02.709 --> 04:36:02.719 align:start position:0%
has some different priorities that would
 
04:36:05.830 --> 04:36:05.840 align:start position:0%
help smaller Banks and also I think help
 
04:36:07.750 --> 04:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure work and a lot of
 
04:36:09.590 --> 04:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
things that we need doing here in the
 
04:36:12.189 --> 04:36:12.199 align:start position:0%
state which are not getting funded and
 
04:36:16.510 --> 04:36:16.520 align:start position:0%
as for not having liquidity that's
 
04:36:21.150 --> 04:36:21.160 align:start position:0%
nonsense well and not to you know while
 
04:36:24.150 --> 04:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
they're not exactly Banks there are
 
04:36:26.429 --> 04:36:26.439 align:start position:0%
Quasi government lending arms for
 
04:36:27.670 --> 04:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
instance I know is mentioned the
 
04:36:29.109 --> 04:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
business Finance Authority we have New
 
04:36:31.429 --> 04:36:31.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Housing Finance Authority and
 
04:36:33.310 --> 04:36:33.320 align:start position:0%
representative hunt you had mentioned
 
04:36:35.629 --> 04:36:35.639 align:start position:0%
what used to be NE which is now I looked
 
04:36:37.789 --> 04:36:37.799 align:start position:0%
it up Granite advance for student
 
04:36:41.429 --> 04:36:41.439 align:start position:0%
lending y so there are um while not
 
04:36:43.629 --> 04:36:43.639 align:start position:0%
Banks there is Alternatives access to
 
04:36:45.949 --> 04:36:45.959 align:start position:0%
Capital through um guess you would call
 
04:36:49.070 --> 04:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
them quasi government arms yep and
 
04:36:51.070 --> 04:36:51.080 align:start position:0%
there's there's a agriculture bank I
 
04:36:54.629 --> 04:36:54.639 align:start position:0%
think in Bedford it uh are you referring
 
04:36:57.510 --> 04:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
to Walden Mutual it does it's not Walden
 
04:37:00.629 --> 04:37:00.639 align:start position:0%
it's basically is a like a a I can't
 
04:37:02.510 --> 04:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
remember the name but it's specifically
 
04:37:05.551 --> 04:37:05.561 align:start position:0%
in the name an agricultural uh
 
04:37:07.070 --> 04:37:07.080 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm not sure if it's part of the
 
04:37:09.990 --> 04:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
government but I think it is
 
04:37:13.910 --> 04:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
so I just think would you believe I
 
04:37:18.230 --> 04:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
think there is room uh and and uh uh
 
04:37:21.750 --> 04:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
advantage to having a mixed banking
 
04:37:27.789 --> 04:37:27.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:30.670 --> 04:37:30.680 align:start position:0%
private thank you very much you're very
 
04:37:33.670 --> 04:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
welcome oh oh I'm sorry representative
 
04:37:35.789 --> 04:37:35.799 align:start position:0%
taxon has a question
 
04:37:38.551 --> 04:37:38.561 align:start position:0%
well I guess this is another would you
 
04:37:41.750 --> 04:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
believe with with reference to and
 
04:37:43.429 --> 04:37:43.439 align:start position:0%
please correct me if this is wrong from
 
04:37:46.150 --> 04:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
your understanding but when we look at
 
04:37:48.709 --> 04:37:48.719 align:start position:0%
the failure of the Savings and Loans in
 
04:37:51.150 --> 04:37:51.160 align:start position:0%
the Savings and Loan crisis those were
 
04:37:53.429 --> 04:37:53.439 align:start position:0%
primarily State chartered entities that
 
04:37:56.109 --> 04:37:56.119 align:start position:0%
were inadequately capitalized because
 
04:37:57.910 --> 04:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
State banking requirements were less
 
04:38:00.949 --> 04:38:00.959 align:start position:0%
stringent than Federal requirements and
 
04:38:03.949 --> 04:38:03.959 align:start position:0%
they weren't typically FDIC insured
 
04:38:08.470 --> 04:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:08.480 --> 04:38:10.070 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:38:10.070 --> 04:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:38:14.789 --> 04:38:14.799 align:start position:0%
uh the other thing is that those lenders
 
04:38:18.470 --> 04:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
primarily made uh commercial real estate
 
04:38:21.750 --> 04:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
loans all of which was impacted by the
 
04:38:23.551 --> 04:38:23.561 align:start position:0%
Reagan roson
 
04:38:27.910 --> 04:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
Kowski uh changes the tax code in 1987
 
04:38:30.510 --> 04:38:30.520 align:start position:0%
which then gave you four years to
 
04:38:33.230 --> 04:38:33.240 align:start position:0%
liquidate your Properties or recapture
 
04:38:36.390 --> 04:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
things so that market collapsed
 
04:38:41.390 --> 04:38:41.400 align:start position:0%
so the idea of having more State
 
04:38:45.510 --> 04:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
state-owned Bank the is even more scary
 
04:38:48.390 --> 04:38:48.400 align:start position:0%
when you look at it in light of that and
 
04:38:52.910 --> 04:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
the fact that the bank in North Dakota
 
04:38:55.830 --> 04:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
didn't fail or Montana whatever it is is
 
04:38:57.830 --> 04:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
because it's primarily an agricultural
 
04:38:59.789 --> 04:38:59.799 align:start position:0%
bank and it wasn't significantly
 
04:39:02.670 --> 04:39:02.680 align:start position:0%
impacted by the changes the massive
 
04:39:06.869 --> 04:39:06.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:09.750 --> 04:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:12.551 --> 04:39:12.561 align:start position:0%
believe that could be yes
 
04:39:16.830 --> 04:39:16.840 align:start position:0%
no while I wasn't uh maybe while I
 
04:39:20.150 --> 04:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
wasn't around that time um it is my
 
04:39:22.189 --> 04:39:22.199 align:start position:0%
understanding that uh there was
 
04:39:25.629 --> 04:39:25.639 align:start position:0%
concentration um in real estate um and
 
04:39:29.029 --> 04:39:29.039 align:start position:0%
that uh I guess a response was were you
 
04:39:31.629 --> 04:39:31.639 align:start position:0%
know the landscape's a lot different uh
 
04:39:33.949 --> 04:39:33.959 align:start position:0%
regulations are a lot different uh
 
04:39:36.270 --> 04:39:36.280 align:start position:0%
safety and sound of banks are a lot
 
04:39:40.350 --> 04:39:40.360 align:start position:0%
different than they were back
 
04:39:43.948 --> 04:39:43.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:50.948 --> 04:39:50.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:54.150 --> 04:39:54.160 align:start position:0%
off thank you all thank
 
04:39:57.830 --> 04:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
you I have no more cards and so I will
 
04:40:00.150 --> 04:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
close the public
 
04:40:03.750 --> 04:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
hearing and I have two different
 
04:40:07.190 --> 04:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
clocks this is our clock that's science
 
04:40:07.200 --> 04:40:07.990 align:start position:0%
clocks this is our clock that's science
and

04:40:07.990 --> 04:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:40:10.750 --> 04:40:10.760 align:start position:0%
technology so we'll wait a minute yeah
 
04:40:12.550 --> 04:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
okay we'll wait two minutes satellite
 
04:40:14.670 --> 04:40:14.680 align:start position:0%
all right got two minutes so if you're
 
04:40:16.230 --> 04:40:16.240 align:start position:0%
going to testify please turn in your
 
04:40:18.310 --> 04:40:18.320 align:start position:0%
cards so I know
 
04:40:20.750 --> 04:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
who wants
 
04:40:29.868 --> 04:40:29.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:32.510 --> 04:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
in that's right
 
04:40:39.550 --> 04:40:39.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:42.948 --> 04:40:42.958 align:start position:0%
husband I thought she made sense but
 
04:40:48.070 --> 04:40:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:51.310 --> 04:40:51.320 align:start position:0%
bi I was I didn't know I
 
04:41:00.868 --> 04:41:00.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:03.628 --> 04:41:03.638 align:start position:0%
Bre holy
 
04:41:07.590 --> 04:41:07.600 align:start position:0%
mackerel okay awesome thank you
 
04:41:11.830 --> 04:41:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:33.628 --> 04:41:33.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:33.638 --> 04:44:58.868 align:start position:0%
 
episode

04:44:58.868 --> 04:44:58.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:00.230 --> 04:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
all right let's open up the public
 
04:45:02.628 --> 04:45:02.638 align:start position:0%
hearing on
 
04:45:05.550 --> 04:45:05.560 align:start position:0%
1633 and uh if you haven't got your pink
 
04:45:07.510 --> 04:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
cards in then you're gonna have to hand
 
04:45:10.310 --> 04:45:10.320 align:start position:0%
them get them around and you're G to get
 
04:45:12.830 --> 04:45:12.840 align:start position:0%
on the bottom of the pile okay so
 
04:45:19.628 --> 04:45:19.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:22.030 --> 04:45:22.040 align:start position:0%
up thank you Mr chairman and members of
 
04:45:23.550 --> 04:45:23.560 align:start position:0%
the Commerce Committee it's nice to
 
04:45:24.910 --> 04:45:24.920 align:start position:0%
actually be in front of this committee
 
04:45:27.750 --> 04:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh for my first time um I want to thank
 
04:45:29.430 --> 04:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
everybody who was involved in the whole
 
04:45:31.310 --> 04:45:31.320 align:start position:0%
process of the commission over the
 
04:45:33.788 --> 04:45:33.798 align:start position:0%
summer in order to look at a state run
 
04:45:35.270 --> 04:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
model and try and see what the
 
04:45:37.670 --> 04:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
challenges and problems were um it was a
 
04:45:40.750 --> 04:45:40.760 align:start position:0%
very interesting and very complex issue
 
04:45:42.628 --> 04:45:42.638 align:start position:0%
um and quite frankly I think that
 
04:45:44.190 --> 04:45:44.200 align:start position:0%
there's some challenges that are
 
04:45:46.470 --> 04:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
insurmountable um with that model and
 
04:45:48.708 --> 04:45:48.718 align:start position:0%
that's why we brought forth this bill we
 
04:45:49.948 --> 04:45:49.958 align:start position:0%
brought forth this bill because we
 
04:45:51.310 --> 04:45:51.320 align:start position:0%
weren't sure if that commission was
 
04:45:53.550 --> 04:45:53.560 align:start position:0%
going to be able to meet a resolution
 
04:45:55.830 --> 04:45:55.840 align:start position:0%
and I lack confidence that having the
 
04:45:57.948 --> 04:45:57.958 align:start position:0%
state that intimately involved in this
 
04:45:59.868 --> 04:45:59.878 align:start position:0%
process is good for the people of New
 
04:46:01.948 --> 04:46:01.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and safe for those people who
 
04:46:04.750 --> 04:46:04.760 align:start position:0%
work for and represent the state
 
04:46:08.190 --> 04:46:08.200 align:start position:0%
um this bill um is built off of the
 
04:46:10.510 --> 04:46:10.520 align:start position:0%
house bill 639 framework that came out
 
04:46:12.708 --> 04:46:12.718 align:start position:0%
of here um I do know that there were
 
04:46:15.110 --> 04:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
some some changes and some other ideas
 
04:46:16.590 --> 04:46:16.600 align:start position:0%
that happened in the commission that are
 
04:46:19.550 --> 04:46:19.560 align:start position:0%
outside of the state run model um and
 
04:46:20.910 --> 04:46:20.920 align:start position:0%
those may be an interesting thing to
 
04:46:23.390 --> 04:46:23.400 align:start position:0%
discuss as we move forward but I will
 
04:46:25.190 --> 04:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
walk you through some of the changes
 
04:46:27.430 --> 04:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
here compared to what uh left this
 
04:46:29.110 --> 04:46:29.120 align:start position:0%
committee and left Ways and Means last
 
04:46:32.030 --> 04:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
year um the largest change is that
 
04:46:34.910 --> 04:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
instead of having the excise tax this
 
04:46:38.510 --> 04:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
would go into a rooms meals and cannabis
 
04:46:41.190 --> 04:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
um tax because you're looking at a
 
04:46:43.430 --> 04:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
product that grows and then is prepared
 
04:46:46.030 --> 04:46:46.040 align:start position:0%
for people to consume much like a meal
 
04:46:47.910 --> 04:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
and this would be a straightforward way
 
04:46:50.470 --> 04:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
in order to handle the handle the
 
04:46:52.110 --> 04:46:52.120 align:start position:0%
process streamline it through an
 
04:46:54.628 --> 04:46:54.638 align:start position:0%
existing program and just sort of remove
 
04:46:56.590 --> 04:46:56.600 align:start position:0%
one more layer of bureaucracy so that
 
04:46:58.030 --> 04:46:58.040 align:start position:0%
that could happen within that same
 
04:47:00.590 --> 04:47:00.600 align:start position:0%
framework um it's also a very good
 
04:47:02.230 --> 04:47:02.240 align:start position:0%
incentive to sort of keep those levels
 
04:47:05.070 --> 04:47:05.080 align:start position:0%
balanced um because as you have more
 
04:47:07.350 --> 04:47:07.360 align:start position:0%
people across different sectors um
 
04:47:08.708 --> 04:47:08.718 align:start position:0%
working within that there's more
 
04:47:11.070 --> 04:47:11.080 align:start position:0%
pressure just to keep that consistent um
 
04:47:12.670 --> 04:47:12.680 align:start position:0%
there are some other changes as well
 
04:47:14.670 --> 04:47:14.680 align:start position:0%
some that would make it more friendly to
 
04:47:16.470 --> 04:47:16.480 align:start position:0%
those who are coming and camping in our
 
04:47:18.750 --> 04:47:18.760 align:start position:0%
C campgrounds making it clear that if
 
04:47:21.230 --> 04:47:21.240 align:start position:0%
you're in your RV and it happens to be
 
04:47:23.548 --> 04:47:23.558 align:start position:0%
on but nobody's driving it that wouldn't
 
04:47:26.310 --> 04:47:26.320 align:start position:0%
be a oui incident because you have the
 
04:47:28.548 --> 04:47:28.558 align:start position:0%
Heat or the radio on which under the
 
04:47:29.990 --> 04:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
current laws and the current Way It Was
 
04:47:33.110 --> 04:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
Written it would be um So within this it
 
04:47:37.270 --> 04:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
does largely walk the existing path and
 
04:47:41.070 --> 04:47:41.080 align:start position:0%
it also meets most but not all of the
 
04:47:43.430 --> 04:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
goals set by both the governor and new
 
04:47:46.470 --> 04:47:46.480 align:start position:0%
futures um the governor definitely seems
 
04:47:48.390 --> 04:47:48.400 align:start position:0%
very intent on the state run model and a
 
04:47:50.868 --> 04:47:50.878 align:start position:0%
very limited number of sto of stores as
 
04:47:53.150 --> 04:47:53.160 align:start position:0%
an economist um I think that we need to
 
04:47:54.990 --> 04:47:55.000 align:start position:0%
look at the fact that this is going to
 
04:47:57.590 --> 04:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
be a very small Market by definition
 
04:47:59.470 --> 04:47:59.480 align:start position:0%
unlike liquor we won't be buying any of
 
04:48:01.548 --> 04:48:01.558 align:start position:0%
this across state lines so we'll need to
 
04:48:03.230 --> 04:48:03.240 align:start position:0%
have both the people who are selling it
 
04:48:04.990 --> 04:48:05.000 align:start position:0%
those who are processing it and those
 
04:48:07.070 --> 04:48:07.080 align:start position:0%
who are growing it able to diversify
 
04:48:09.190 --> 04:48:09.200 align:start position:0%
their risks throughout the entire
 
04:48:12.430 --> 04:48:12.440 align:start position:0%
process um and when you're selling to a
 
04:48:15.070 --> 04:48:15.080 align:start position:0%
monolithic block that actually increases
 
04:48:17.628 --> 04:48:17.638 align:start position:0%
your risks as a grower especially
 
04:48:20.230 --> 04:48:20.240 align:start position:0%
because as an Agricultural Product you
 
04:48:23.190 --> 04:48:23.200 align:start position:0%
need to plant well before the demand you
 
04:48:25.628 --> 04:48:25.638 align:start position:0%
need to be able to plan ahead of time
 
04:48:27.590 --> 04:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
and have some expectation of what that
 
04:48:30.750 --> 04:48:30.760 align:start position:0%
pricing would be if we got into any sort
 
04:48:34.070 --> 04:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
of a pre-plant contract where the
 
04:48:36.868 --> 04:48:36.878 align:start position:0%
state-run stores were Contracting all
 
04:48:38.830 --> 04:48:38.840 align:start position:0%
the way down to when you're starting the
 
04:48:41.110 --> 04:48:41.120 align:start position:0%
plants you know that makes the state
 
04:48:43.190 --> 04:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
even more plant touching I know that the
 
04:48:45.150 --> 04:48:45.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice has said that they
 
04:48:46.910 --> 04:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
will not do interfere with the states
 
04:48:49.270 --> 04:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
and their cannabis regulation but that
 
04:48:51.030 --> 04:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that other Departments of
 
04:48:53.030 --> 04:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
the federal government are going to take
 
04:48:56.430 --> 04:48:56.440 align:start position:0%
a similar hands off approach we actually
 
04:48:59.548 --> 04:48:59.558 align:start position:0%
saw in um Georgia I believe the DEA
 
04:49:01.670 --> 04:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
sending Cent assist letters to the
 
04:49:03.628 --> 04:49:03.638 align:start position:0%
pharmacies that are now allowed under
 
04:49:06.670 --> 04:49:06.680 align:start position:0%
Geor law to dispense THC containing
 
04:49:10.230 --> 04:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
products so that is a new move from the
 
04:49:12.788 --> 04:49:12.798 align:start position:0%
federal government to intervene in a
 
04:49:15.150 --> 04:49:15.160 align:start position:0%
state license business and I think that
 
04:49:16.948 --> 04:49:16.958 align:start position:0%
that definitely should bring bring some
 
04:49:19.310 --> 04:49:19.320 align:start position:0%
caution to the idea of tying the state
 
04:49:23.590 --> 04:49:23.600 align:start position:0%
too close to this process um know it's
 
04:49:25.230 --> 04:49:25.240 align:start position:0%
uh there's some information I think that
 
04:49:27.230 --> 04:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
there's some other people who have both
 
04:49:28.830 --> 04:49:28.840 align:start position:0%
submitted testimony and some that'll be
 
04:49:30.788 --> 04:49:30.798 align:start position:0%
speaking about where it does and where
 
04:49:32.830 --> 04:49:32.840 align:start position:0%
it doesn't overlap with the guidelines
 
04:49:34.390 --> 04:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
from both the governor and and new
 
04:49:37.390 --> 04:49:37.400 align:start position:0%
futures um but in the interest of time
 
04:49:40.110 --> 04:49:40.120 align:start position:0%
because this clearly is a bill with a
 
04:49:42.430 --> 04:49:42.440 align:start position:0%
lot of interest I will just uh close it
 
04:49:47.430 --> 04:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:49.868 --> 04:49:49.878 align:start position:0%
questions uh need to say this committee
 
04:49:52.788 --> 04:49:52.798 align:start position:0%
has heard this bill before so I guess we
 
04:49:56.150 --> 04:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
don't have any questions so okay oh we
 
04:49:57.390 --> 04:49:57.400 align:start position:0%
do have a question representative
 
04:50:00.270 --> 04:50:00.280 align:start position:0%
Sullivan has a question thank you a
 
04:50:02.910 --> 04:50:02.920 align:start position:0%
great gra testimony um so it looks like
 
04:50:04.670 --> 04:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
you guys have this
 
04:50:06.910 --> 04:50:06.920 align:start position:0%
this uh tax revenue earmarked for
 
04:50:08.590 --> 04:50:08.600 align:start position:0%
certain things can you talk about that a
 
04:50:10.350 --> 04:50:10.360 align:start position:0%
little bit oh yes thank you I'm sorry
 
04:50:12.310 --> 04:50:12.320 align:start position:0%
that I glossed over that um this
 
04:50:13.868 --> 04:50:13.878 align:start position:0%
actually would address a couple of the
 
04:50:15.750 --> 04:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
issues that we that we're facing in the
 
04:50:17.670 --> 04:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
state it would send some of the revenues
 
04:50:20.470 --> 04:50:20.480 align:start position:0%
into the affordable housing Fund in
 
04:50:23.350 --> 04:50:23.360 align:start position:0%
order to be able to address that ongoing
 
04:50:25.910 --> 04:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
challenge we have in housing um it sends
 
04:50:28.070 --> 04:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
most of it to the education trust fund
 
04:50:30.628 --> 04:50:30.638 align:start position:0%
which is even more pressing with the
 
04:50:32.750 --> 04:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
recent lawsuits that while this won't be
 
04:50:34.548 --> 04:50:34.558 align:start position:0%
enough to solve our school funding
 
04:50:36.628 --> 04:50:36.638 align:start position:0%
problem it'll be one more step to be
 
04:50:38.750 --> 04:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
able to close that Gap and pay for our
 
04:50:40.910 --> 04:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
schools by something other than property
 
04:50:43.270 --> 04:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
tax and quite volunt quite honestly with
 
04:50:46.670 --> 04:50:46.680 align:start position:0%
a voluntary tax um which is a better way
 
04:50:50.270 --> 04:50:50.280 align:start position:0%
to to fund things um also it does have
 
04:50:52.390 --> 04:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
some Provisions for water and sewer
 
04:50:54.670 --> 04:50:54.680 align:start position:0%
expansions and by doing that you'll be
 
04:50:56.910 --> 04:50:56.920 align:start position:0%
able to help help cover both the cost of
 
04:50:58.628 --> 04:50:58.638 align:start position:0%
that infrastructure as new people and
 
04:51:01.190 --> 04:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
new new um providers new people who are
 
04:51:03.470 --> 04:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
involved in this market move in and also
 
04:51:05.110 --> 04:51:05.120 align:start position:0%
add address some of those underlying
 
04:51:07.150 --> 04:51:07.160 align:start position:0%
issues with um the constraints on our
 
04:51:09.310 --> 04:51:09.320 align:start position:0%
current housing Supply so this is
 
04:51:10.990 --> 04:51:11.000 align:start position:0%
designed to although it spreads the
 
04:51:12.990 --> 04:51:13.000 align:start position:0%
money a little further it does address
 
04:51:15.470 --> 04:51:15.480 align:start position:0%
some of the different needs in our state
 
04:51:20.110 --> 04:51:20.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:23.548 --> 04:51:23.558 align:start position:0%
question keep us thank you very much
 
04:51:24.868 --> 04:51:24.878 align:start position:0%

okay naita
here

04:51:36.628 --> 04:51:36.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:54.470 --> 04:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:57.070 --> 04:51:57.080 align:start position:0%
burough not used to being on this side
 
04:52:00.030 --> 04:52:00.040 align:start position:0%
looking directly at the chairman I'm uh
 
04:52:02.150 --> 04:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
I'm State Rep Anita burrow I'm from car
 
04:52:04.230 --> 04:52:04.240 align:start position:0%
from Carol to and I'll keep it brief cuz
 
04:52:06.270 --> 04:52:06.280 align:start position:0%
there are so many people here today but
 
04:52:08.110 --> 04:52:08.120 align:start position:0%
I I just wanted to talk very briefly
 
04:52:09.868 --> 04:52:09.878 align:start position:0%
about why I think that this bill is the
 
04:52:11.670 --> 04:52:11.680 align:start position:0%
best model for the Live Free or Die
 
04:52:14.110 --> 04:52:14.120 align:start position:0%
State um the crafting of this bill
 
04:52:16.190 --> 04:52:16.200 align:start position:0%
relied on the expertise of of many
 
04:52:17.670 --> 04:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
people who have been in the industry for
 
04:52:20.990 --> 04:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
many years um I've had people say to me
 
04:52:22.910 --> 04:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
you grow it you dry it you roll it
 
04:52:24.868 --> 04:52:24.878 align:start position:0%
that's all there is to this business and
 
04:52:27.030 --> 04:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
nothing could be further from the truth
 
04:52:28.628 --> 04:52:28.638 align:start position:0%
uh a number I think there are two of us
 
04:52:29.948 --> 04:52:29.958 align:start position:0%
in this room at least that I know of
 
04:52:33.470 --> 04:52:33.480 align:start position:0%
went to a uh uh a tour of an $8 million
 
04:52:36.190 --> 04:52:36.200 align:start position:0%
uh cultivation facility in Maine and we
 
04:52:38.910 --> 04:52:38.920 align:start position:0%
learned how complex this business is um
 
04:52:40.788 --> 04:52:40.798 align:start position:0%
we learned that to grow to grow
 
04:52:43.270 --> 04:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
consistent and accurate buds uh Growers
 
04:52:45.150 --> 04:52:45.160 align:start position:0%
use different cannabis species under
 
04:52:47.390 --> 04:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
very different growing conditions and
 
04:52:49.390 --> 04:52:49.400 align:start position:0%
expertise is needed in areas of
 
04:52:51.670 --> 04:52:51.680 align:start position:0%
nutrition water lighting and temperature
 
04:52:53.868 --> 04:52:53.878 align:start position:0%
and humidity so it it is a complex
 
04:52:56.150 --> 04:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
business um we also traveled to an
 
04:52:58.590 --> 04:52:58.600 align:start position:0%
independent licensed cannabis store over
 
04:53:00.670 --> 04:53:00.680 align:start position:0%
the Border in Maine and we met skilled
 
04:53:02.948 --> 04:53:02.958 align:start position:0%
people who were were trained in the
 
04:53:05.430 --> 04:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
dosage manufactur and impact of the many
 
04:53:07.390 --> 04:53:07.400 align:start position:0%
products being sold so if you bought
 
04:53:09.670 --> 04:53:09.680 align:start position:0%
something you were confident that you
 
04:53:11.830 --> 04:53:11.840 align:start position:0%
knew what was how it was it could impact
 
04:53:14.030 --> 04:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
you and what the dosage what the best
 
04:53:17.110 --> 04:53:17.120 align:start position:0%
dosage would dosage would be for you um
 
04:53:18.948 --> 04:53:18.958 align:start position:0%
we'll hear that today that cannabis has
 
04:53:20.948 --> 04:53:20.958 align:start position:0%
pharmacological effects and and that you
 
04:53:23.470 --> 04:53:23.480 align:start position:0%
do need people who can direct people
 
04:53:25.868 --> 04:53:25.878 align:start position:0%
appropriately um now can the Liquor
 
04:53:27.628 --> 04:53:27.638 align:start position:0%
Commission alone expect their employees
 
04:53:30.230 --> 04:53:30.240 align:start position:0%
to live to deliver in this regard or
 
04:53:32.110 --> 04:53:32.120 align:start position:0%
would it be better to have a li The
 
04:53:33.548 --> 04:53:33.558 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission working tandem with
 
04:53:35.628 --> 04:53:35.638 align:start position:0%
with a cannabis commissioner I I would
 
04:53:38.470 --> 04:53:38.480 align:start position:0%
say yes um if you visit it and if you
 
04:53:40.310 --> 04:53:40.320 align:start position:0%
visit dispensaries in other state
 
04:53:42.990 --> 04:53:43.000 align:start position:0%
including nearby Main and and um
 
04:53:45.628 --> 04:53:45.638 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts you'll see that each each
 
04:53:47.628 --> 04:53:47.638 align:start position:0%
dispensary has its own distinct
 
04:53:50.150 --> 04:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
personality their own set of prop
 
04:53:52.310 --> 04:53:52.320 align:start position:0%
products their own Ambience so the
 
04:53:53.628 --> 04:53:53.638 align:start position:0%
question that we have here in New
 
04:53:56.070 --> 04:53:56.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is do we want a McDonald's
 
04:53:58.750 --> 04:53:58.760 align:start position:0%
type of franchise where everybody has
 
04:54:00.628 --> 04:54:00.638 align:start position:0%
the same products the same store the
 
04:54:03.788 --> 04:54:03.798 align:start position:0%
same layout or or will consumers do they
 
04:54:05.590 --> 04:54:05.600 align:start position:0%
do now when they want a hamburger if
 
04:54:06.868 --> 04:54:06.878 align:start position:0%
they're at they're short for time
 
04:54:08.788 --> 04:54:08.798 align:start position:0%
they're going to run into a McDonald's
 
04:54:10.788 --> 04:54:10.798 align:start position:0%
but other times they want something more
 
04:54:13.110 --> 04:54:13.120 align:start position:0%
unique um they're going to see seek out
 
04:54:14.788 --> 04:54:14.798 align:start position:0%
establishments such as The Barley House
 
04:54:17.990 --> 04:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
here in conquer um um I didn't mean to
 
04:54:19.430 --> 04:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
give them a plug but they do have good
 
04:54:22.470 --> 04:54:22.480 align:start position:0%
burgers um so I I know the governor has
 
04:54:24.830 --> 04:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
been talking about um a franchise model
 
04:54:26.708 --> 04:54:26.718 align:start position:0%
where the state would regulate Marketing
 
04:54:29.510 --> 04:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
sales and distribution um but I think
 
04:54:31.430 --> 04:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
the question for this committee is do we
 
04:54:33.788 --> 04:54:33.798 align:start position:0%
as a Live Free or Die State want want to
 
04:54:36.948 --> 04:54:36.958 align:start position:0%
encourage oper entrepreneurs and a new
 
04:54:38.910 --> 04:54:38.920 align:start position:0%
and small businesses and a new industry
 
04:54:40.910 --> 04:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire or do we want to
 
04:54:43.030 --> 04:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
set up a system in New Hampshire where
 
04:54:45.548 --> 04:54:45.558 align:start position:0%
experienced individuals could run their
 
04:54:48.070 --> 04:54:48.080 align:start position:0%
businesses as they see fit and grow them
 
04:54:51.470 --> 04:54:51.480 align:start position:0%
without the the regulations um alibet we
 
04:54:53.948 --> 04:54:53.958 align:start position:0%
do still need the we still need need we
 
04:54:56.110 --> 04:54:56.120 align:start position:0%
still need regulations regarding safety
 
04:54:58.708 --> 04:54:58.718 align:start position:0%
potency and keeping and keeping cannabis
 
04:55:01.270 --> 04:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
out of the C hands of children um I
 
04:55:03.628 --> 04:55:03.638 align:start position:0%
think I know I do and I know a lot of
 
04:55:05.110 --> 04:55:05.120 align:start position:0%
people in this room would would feel
 
04:55:06.948 --> 04:55:06.958 align:start position:0%
that we want entrepreneurs to choose the
 
04:55:08.948 --> 04:55:08.958 align:start position:0%
location that they think would provide
 
04:55:11.190 --> 04:55:11.200 align:start position:0%
them with the best shot to succeed and
 
04:55:12.830 --> 04:55:12.840 align:start position:0%
to Market their products in a way that
 
04:55:15.830 --> 04:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
Sears the personality of the store their
 
04:55:18.230 --> 04:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
clientele and the this the community
 
04:55:20.350 --> 04:55:20.360 align:start position:0%
that they're in um one thing that we
 
04:55:21.708 --> 04:55:21.718 align:start position:0%
really need to think about is how much
 
04:55:23.830 --> 04:55:23.840 align:start position:0%
money we're leaving on the table as a
 
04:55:26.788 --> 04:55:26.798 align:start position:0%
state um Massachusetts has generated $5
 
04:55:29.230 --> 04:55:29.240 align:start position:0%
billion and gross cannabis sales since
 
04:55:31.590 --> 04:55:31.600 align:start position:0%
since their for for their stores first
 
04:55:35.990 --> 04:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
open in 2018 uh in terms of just in
 
04:55:38.030 --> 04:55:38.040 align:start position:0%
terms of the tax revenue they've gone
 
04:55:42.190 --> 04:55:42.200 align:start position:0%
from 22 million in 2019 to 248 million
 
04:55:44.948 --> 04:55:44.958 align:start position:0%
in 2022 um I think that's pretty
 
04:55:47.350 --> 04:55:47.360 align:start position:0%
astonishing Maine is breaking record
 
04:55:50.868 --> 04:55:50.878 align:start position:0%
sales on a monthly basis um they did 216
 
04:55:55.470 --> 04:55:55.480 align:start position:0%
million in 2023 gross and uh $40 million
 
04:55:56.830 --> 04:55:56.840 align:start position:0%
more than the previous year and they
 
04:55:59.110 --> 04:55:59.120 align:start position:0%
generated over $30 million in revenue
 
04:56:01.628 --> 04:56:01.638 align:start position:0%
and that that's only growing um so
 
04:56:03.110 --> 04:56:03.120 align:start position:0%
whether or not you think that cannabis
 
04:56:05.628 --> 04:56:05.638 align:start position:0%
is been is illegal in in New Hampshire
 
04:56:07.430 --> 04:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
in some ways it isn't because anybody
 
04:56:09.470 --> 04:56:09.480 align:start position:0%
who wants it is going over the Border
 
04:56:11.310 --> 04:56:11.320 align:start position:0%
they're going to M Massachusetts they're
 
04:56:13.350 --> 04:56:13.360 align:start position:0%
going to New Hampshire um and they're
 
04:56:15.190 --> 04:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
buying products or they're buying it
 
04:56:17.830 --> 04:56:17.840 align:start position:0%
from friends who have medical um medical
 
04:56:20.190 --> 04:56:20.200 align:start position:0%
marijuana cards I've had I've had five
 
04:56:22.030 --> 04:56:22.040 align:start position:0%
or six people say if you want some I'll
 
04:56:24.230 --> 04:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
get it for you um I'm not going to do it
 
04:56:25.910 --> 04:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
because I have legislative license
 
04:56:28.670 --> 04:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
plates um but I can assure you that uh
 
04:56:30.990 --> 04:56:31.000 align:start position:0%
there are legislators in this house who
 
04:56:33.510 --> 04:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
are doing it and it's just a common
 
04:56:36.510 --> 04:56:36.520 align:start position:0%
practice so we have to decide if we want
 
04:56:38.670 --> 04:56:38.680 align:start position:0%
that business to continue to go out out
 
04:56:41.948 --> 04:56:41.958 align:start position:0%
of state um and I'll just add a personal
 
04:56:45.750 --> 04:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
note um I have um I've I have a minor um
 
04:56:47.750 --> 04:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
problem I've had two surgeries for I've
 
04:56:49.788 --> 04:56:49.798 align:start position:0%
had all kinds of medications none of
 
04:56:51.948 --> 04:56:51.958 align:start position:0%
it's worked when I was in California I
 
04:56:54.830 --> 04:56:54.840 align:start position:0%
had a gummy and my symptoms disappeared
 
04:56:56.270 --> 04:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
and I was able to get a good night's
 
04:56:58.510 --> 04:56:58.520 align:start position:0%
sleep for the first time in 20 years why
 
04:57:00.990 --> 04:57:01.000 align:start position:0%
can't I get it I mean it just seems my
 
04:57:02.910 --> 04:57:02.920 align:start position:0%
doctor can't write me a script because
 
04:57:05.910 --> 04:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
my symptoms are not on the list of um
 
04:57:08.628 --> 04:57:08.638 align:start position:0%
for medical marijuana so um I will just
 
04:57:11.548 --> 04:57:11.558 align:start position:0%
say in closing that I think HB 1633 as
 
04:57:13.670 --> 04:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
written is the best way that we can
 
04:57:16.628 --> 04:57:16.638 align:start position:0%
ensure a robust Private Industry um that
 
04:57:18.830 --> 04:57:18.840 align:start position:0%
can create jobs and contribute
 
04:57:23.510 --> 04:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:26.310 --> 04:57:26.320 align:start position:0%
revenue okay uh represent M you has a
 
04:57:28.150 --> 04:57:28.160 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:57:29.990 --> 04:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
representative burls my question is just
 
04:57:32.190 --> 04:57:32.200 align:start position:0%
about the one thing you mentioned which
 
04:57:34.350 --> 04:57:34.360 align:start position:0%
is in regards to to the I think you've
 
04:57:36.830 --> 04:57:36.840 align:start position:0%
said people to direct people
 
04:57:39.150 --> 04:57:39.160 align:start position:0%
appropriately is that referring to
 
04:57:41.830 --> 04:57:41.840 align:start position:0%
people in the various dispensaries or
 
04:57:44.110 --> 04:57:44.120 align:start position:0%
retail outlets or whatever and if it
 
04:57:46.670 --> 04:57:46.680 align:start position:0%
is what's their training are they
 
04:57:48.150 --> 04:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
medical I mean they're advising on what
 
04:57:50.070 --> 04:57:50.080 align:start position:0%
we've all said is medical and these are
 
04:57:51.990 --> 04:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
Pharmaceuticals and there's a I think a
 
04:57:53.590 --> 04:57:53.600 align:start position:0%
pharmacist or a farm D who's going to
 
04:57:55.990 --> 04:57:56.000 align:start position:0%
testify and maybe I'll ask her but
 
04:57:57.868 --> 04:57:57.878 align:start position:0%
what's who are these people how are they
 
04:57:59.150 --> 04:57:59.160 align:start position:0%
licensed how are they trained to
 
04:58:00.750 --> 04:58:00.760 align:start position:0%
dispense what's essentially Healthcare
 
04:58:02.910 --> 04:58:02.920 align:start position:0%
advice I think I think that's a really
 
04:58:04.548 --> 04:58:04.558 align:start position:0%
good question and I think that would be
 
04:58:05.868 --> 04:58:05.878 align:start position:0%
better answered by the some of the
 
04:58:08.110 --> 04:58:08.120 align:start position:0%
people who are coming behind me but um I
 
04:58:10.270 --> 04:58:10.280 align:start position:0%
can tell you that the store in main um I
 
04:58:12.510 --> 04:58:12.520 align:start position:0%
think the people behind the counter um
 
04:58:14.788 --> 04:58:14.798 align:start position:0%
were trained um by people knowledgeable
 
04:58:16.350 --> 04:58:16.360 align:start position:0%
in the industry but to give you a more
 
04:58:17.990 --> 04:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
specific answer I'm going to I'm going

visit they are choosing other states

poised for growth in New Hampshire but
 
05:01:39.070 --> 05:01:39.080 align:start position:0%
is being stifled due to inaction with a
 
05:01:40.470 --> 05:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
strong percentage of the proceeds that
 
05:01:43.390 --> 05:01:43.400 align:start position:0%
this bill has going towards education is
 
05:01:45.548 --> 05:01:45.558 align:start position:0%
imperative that we act this spring to
 
05:01:47.430 --> 05:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
pass it we are all familiar with the
 
05:01:49.070 --> 05:01:49.080 align:start position:0%
recent Court ruling changing the way
 
05:01:50.750 --> 05:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
that education funding will take place
 
05:01:53.270 --> 05:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire it will drive up school
 
05:01:56.788 --> 05:01:56.798 align:start position:0%
taxes for towns it will pass passing
 
05:01:58.590 --> 05:01:58.600 align:start position:0%
this bill will also be able to reduce
 
05:02:01.548 --> 05:02:01.558 align:start position:0%
those tax obligations to reduce property
 
05:02:04.510 --> 05:02:04.520 align:start position:0%
taxes on on Rising Education costs
 
05:02:05.750 --> 05:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
whether they're in the form of public
 
05:02:07.628 --> 05:02:07.638 align:start position:0%
schools or vouchers whatever way you
 
05:02:09.628 --> 05:02:09.638 align:start position:0%
enjoy your education this will help it
 
05:02:10.590 --> 05:02:10.600 align:start position:0%
be more
 
05:02:12.750 --> 05:02:12.760 align:start position:0%
costeffective we can't ignore that this
 
05:02:15.470 --> 05:02:15.480 align:start position:0%
bill was designed by a bipartisan
 
05:02:17.390 --> 05:02:17.400 align:start position:0%
Coalition and by a bipartisan group of
 
05:02:19.270 --> 05:02:19.280 align:start position:0%
legislators who are looking at Best
 
05:02:21.708 --> 05:02:21.718 align:start position:0%
Practices it's a bill that has the best
 
05:02:23.670 --> 05:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
in mind for New Hampshire and speaking
 
05:02:26.910 --> 05:02:26.920 align:start position:0%
of Best Practices New Hampshire applauds
 
05:02:28.628 --> 05:02:28.638 align:start position:0%
supporting a free market economy
 
05:02:30.430 --> 05:02:30.440 align:start position:0%
remember a free market economy is an
 
05:02:32.430 --> 05:02:32.440 align:start position:0%
economic system in which the prices of
 
05:02:34.350 --> 05:02:34.360 align:start position:0%
goods and services are determined by
 
05:02:36.590 --> 05:02:36.600 align:start position:0%
supply and demand expressed by sellers
 
05:02:39.030 --> 05:02:39.040 align:start position:0%
and buyers such markets as modeled
 
05:02:41.430 --> 05:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
operate without the intervention of
 
05:02:43.350 --> 05:02:43.360 align:start position:0%
government or any other external
 
05:02:45.548 --> 05:02:45.558 align:start position:0%

cbdn so Vermont employees at any
 
05:03:53.830 --> 05:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
cannabis retail establishment have to
 
05:03:57.270 --> 05:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
pass this training by the state and
 
05:03:59.150 --> 05:03:59.160 align:start position:0%
receive their ID card before they are
 
05:04:01.670 --> 05:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
eligible to become a full-fledged
 
05:04:01.680 --> 05:04:03.548 align:start position:0%
eligible to become a full-fledged
employee

05:04:03.548 --> 05:04:03.558 align:start position:0%
employee
 
05:04:06.830 --> 05:04:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:09.190 --> 05:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
helpful sounds like an interesting
 
05:04:11.110 --> 05:04:11.120 align:start position:0%
process they're doing in Vermont so they
 
05:04:13.430 --> 05:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
they created an an a separate state
 
05:04:15.670 --> 05:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
agency for training of no those
 
05:04:17.470 --> 05:04:17.480 align:start position:0%
employees or within the association
 
05:04:20.310 --> 05:04:20.320 align:start position:0%
sorry sorry I I know Tim so we chat so
 
05:04:22.230 --> 05:04:22.240 align:start position:0%
sorry representative um thank you for
 
05:04:24.670 --> 05:04:24.680 align:start position:0%
your question I'll be formal um they
 
05:04:27.390 --> 05:04:27.400 align:start position:0%
actually created an ID card training
 
05:04:32.910 --> 05:04:32.920 align:start position:0%
program within the agency so it requires
 
05:04:35.070 --> 05:04:35.080 align:start position:0%
for people to take it they have
 
05:04:38.590 --> 05:04:38.600 align:start position:0%
outsourced that to vendors the retailers
 
05:04:40.830 --> 05:04:40.840 align:start position:0%
have to pay for their employees to take
 
05:04:43.110 --> 05:04:43.120 align:start position:0%
that training test so it's on the
 
05:04:44.510 --> 05:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
business it's incumbent on the business
 
05:04:47.990 --> 05:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
not on the state to execute the test the
 
05:04:51.548 --> 05:04:51.558 align:start position:0%
employee signs up takes the exam sends
 
05:04:54.190 --> 05:04:54.200 align:start position:0%
their results into the into the state
 
05:04:56.190 --> 05:04:56.200 align:start position:0%
they get their ID card and they are then
 
05:04:59.150 --> 05:04:59.160 align:start position:0%
able to work at the register advise a
 
05:04:59.160 --> 05:05:01.470 align:start position:0%
able to work at the register advise a
consumer

05:05:01.470 --> 05:05:01.480 align:start position:0%
consumer
 
05:05:01.480 --> 05:05:03.110 align:start position:0%
consumer
Etc

05:05:03.110 --> 05:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
05:05:03.120 --> 05:05:04.190 align:start position:0%
Etc
thanks

05:05:04.190 --> 05:05:04.200 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
05:05:06.350 --> 05:05:06.360 align:start position:0%
so maybe we'll talk about it in
 
05:05:08.150 --> 05:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
subcommittee a little bit but I so what
 
05:05:10.310 --> 05:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
I understand is that you're proposing
 
05:05:12.948 --> 05:05:12.958 align:start position:0%
that similar
 
05:05:16.310 --> 05:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
program before we allow these employees
 
05:05:18.750 --> 05:05:18.760 align:start position:0%
to dispense what's essentially healthare
 
05:05:20.590 --> 05:05:20.600 align:start position:0%
de healthc care advice on a
 
05:05:22.590 --> 05:05:22.600 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical over the counter much
 
05:05:24.190 --> 05:05:24.200 align:start position:0%
like a pharmacist does in a little area
 
05:05:25.708 --> 05:05:25.718 align:start position:0%
that says get advice here or whatever
 
05:05:28.350 --> 05:05:28.360 align:start position:0%
you know at a pharmacist proposing the
 
05:05:29.470 --> 05:05:29.480 align:start position:0%
same kind of
 
05:05:32.868 --> 05:05:32.878 align:start position:0%
setup well knowing that legis isation
 
05:05:34.708 --> 05:05:34.718 align:start position:0%
initially needs to be passed and that we
 
05:05:36.430 --> 05:05:36.440 align:start position:0%
are very big on agencies creating
 
05:05:38.150 --> 05:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
rulemaking that would be something that
 
05:05:40.150 --> 05:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
would be incumbent upon the Liquor
 
05:05:42.430 --> 05:05:42.440 align:start position:0%
Commission I would advise them if ever
 
05:05:44.350 --> 05:05:44.360 align:start position:0%
asked an official capacity to do that
 
05:05:46.110 --> 05:05:46.120 align:start position:0%
and would be glad to share the
 
05:05:49.270 --> 05:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that Vermont set up I
 
05:05:51.110 --> 05:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
think it's important they are probably
 
05:05:53.628 --> 05:05:53.638 align:start position:0%
do some of that training now as well as
 
05:05:55.030 --> 05:05:55.040 align:start position:0%
you know understanding are people
 
05:05:56.548 --> 05:05:56.558 align:start position:0%
intoxicated if they're buying too much
 
05:05:59.070 --> 05:05:59.080 align:start position:0%
liquor you know those are the things
 
05:06:01.030 --> 05:06:01.040 align:start position:0%
that is coming upon a state agency to
 
05:06:03.030 --> 05:06:03.040 align:start position:0%
run their regulatory
 
05:06:04.830 --> 05:06:04.840 align:start position:0%
aspects this would be something that
 
05:06:08.270 --> 05:06:08.280 align:start position:0%
could be implemented then once
 
05:06:11.670 --> 05:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
a agency that is overseeing this presuma
 
05:06:14.750 --> 05:06:14.760 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission in enforcement
 
05:06:16.548 --> 05:06:16.558 align:start position:0%
would say here's what employees need to
 
05:06:18.548 --> 05:06:18.558 align:start position:0%
have to be able to dispense it just like
 
05:06:20.670 --> 05:06:20.680 align:start position:0%
when we go into a grocery store now and
 
05:06:23.030 --> 05:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
you walk up to the register to buy beer
 
05:06:24.868 --> 05:06:24.878 align:start position:0%
and the person under 21 is at the
 
05:06:26.868 --> 05:06:26.878 align:start position:0%
register they have to ding the buzzer
 
05:06:28.910 --> 05:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
and call someone over AG to over swipe
 
05:06:30.350 --> 05:06:30.360 align:start position:0%
their card and sell
 
05:06:34.270 --> 05:06:34.280 align:start position:0%
that that is a takes time and energy if
 
05:06:37.830 --> 05:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
you could train employees who are above
 
05:06:41.948 --> 05:06:41.958 align:start position:0%
21 to be able to have a education level
 
05:06:41.958 --> 05:06:42.708 align:start position:0%
21 to be able to have a education level
that

05:06:42.708 --> 05:06:42.718 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:06:45.670 --> 05:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
is enable enables them to engage the
 
05:06:47.590 --> 05:06:47.600 align:start position:0%
consumer and understand the consumer and
 
05:06:50.030 --> 05:06:50.040 align:start position:0%
be able to counsel them on maybe this is
 
05:06:52.270 --> 05:06:52.280 align:start position:0%
not right for you maybe you're you know
 
05:06:53.670 --> 05:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
you're taking other medications maybe
 
05:06:55.628 --> 05:06:55.638 align:start position:0%
you shouldn't take this kind of potency
 
05:06:58.190 --> 05:06:58.200 align:start position:0%
that's where that program could be
 
05:07:00.628 --> 05:07:00.638 align:start position:0%
created could be a value to the consumer
 
05:07:06.430 --> 05:07:06.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:09.070 --> 05:07:09.080 align:start position:0%
businesses okay I'm going to I'm going
 
05:07:11.070 --> 05:07:11.080 align:start position:0%
to and I'm glad to come to subcommittee
 
05:07:12.990 --> 05:07:13.000 align:start position:0%
and okay talk more about this I'm going
 
05:07:14.990 --> 05:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
to Stir It
 
05:07:20.350 --> 05:07:20.360 align:start position:0%
Up this bill is very very similar to
 
05:07:23.948 --> 05:07:23.958 align:start position:0%
House Bill 639 that this committee
 
05:07:23.958 --> 05:07:25.628 align:start position:0%
House Bill 639 that this committee
overwhelmingly

05:07:25.628 --> 05:07:25.638 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly
 
05:07:28.628 --> 05:07:28.638 align:start position:0%
supported sent to the floor
 
05:07:31.830 --> 05:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly supported on the house
 
05:07:32.830 --> 05:07:32.840 align:start position:0%
and died
 
05:07:34.230 --> 05:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
in the
 
05:07:37.270 --> 05:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
Senate there is some
 
05:07:39.910 --> 05:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
suggestion that if we go with a
 
05:07:39.920 --> 05:07:42.390 align:start position:0%
suggestion that if we go with a
different

05:07:42.390 --> 05:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
different
 
05:07:46.470 --> 05:07:46.480 align:start position:0%
model that was recommended by the
 
05:07:49.510 --> 05:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
governor that the Senate might actually
 
05:07:54.270 --> 05:07:54.280 align:start position:0%
pass it my question to you is what would
 
05:07:56.548 --> 05:07:56.558 align:start position:0%
you rather this committee
 
05:07:58.670 --> 05:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
do pass this
 
05:08:02.750 --> 05:08:02.760 align:start position:0%
bill and have it die in the Senate or
 
05:08:04.750 --> 05:08:04.760 align:start position:0%
pass a amended
 
05:08:10.190 --> 05:08:10.200 align:start position:0%
bill that was somewhat agreed by the
 
05:08:13.628 --> 05:08:13.638 align:start position:0%
commission and send it forward and see
 
05:08:17.390 --> 05:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
what happens with that bill what should
 
05:08:20.830 --> 05:08:20.840 align:start position:0%
the committee do I'm in favor of
 
05:08:22.708 --> 05:08:22.718 align:start position:0%
legalization and regulation of cannabis
 
05:08:24.470 --> 05:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
I'd pass any bill that allows that to
 
05:08:27.390 --> 05:08:27.400 align:start position:0%
happen and I think what happens within
 
05:08:29.548 --> 05:08:29.558 align:start position:0%
the interaction between the Senate and
 
05:08:32.190 --> 05:08:32.200 align:start position:0%
the house is going to happen not with
 
05:08:35.548 --> 05:08:35.558 align:start position:0%
with my input because it was not taken
 
05:08:37.708 --> 05:08:37.718 align:start position:0%
by the commission I was never asked or
 
05:08:39.510 --> 05:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
called to testify even though New
 
05:08:42.830 --> 05:08:42.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can was listed so I in favor
 
05:08:44.910 --> 05:08:44.920 align:start position:0%
of anything that moves legislation and
 
05:08:47.310 --> 05:08:47.320 align:start position:0%
legalization forward because of all the
 
05:08:50.110 --> 05:08:50.120 align:start position:0%
reasons I stated I'm open-minded I think
 
05:08:51.030 --> 05:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
that's the way you build good
 
05:08:53.548 --> 05:08:53.558 align:start position:0%
legislation is being open-minded to
 
05:08:58.628 --> 05:08:58.638 align:start position:0%
hearing all parts perfect answer I try
 
05:09:00.150 --> 05:09:00.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
05:09:04.310 --> 05:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:05.990 --> 05:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
um so yeah representative Leon did a
 
05:09:07.948 --> 05:09:07.958 align:start position:0%
great job talking about some of the the
 
05:09:09.030 --> 05:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
revenues I was wondering if you could
 
05:09:10.788 --> 05:09:10.798 align:start position:0%
expand on it because it talks a lot
 
05:09:13.948 --> 05:09:13.958 align:start position:0%
about how it's going to go into unfunded
 
05:09:16.110 --> 05:09:16.120 align:start position:0%
liabilities and also do you have any
 
05:09:17.150 --> 05:09:17.160 align:start position:0%
estimates does anybody have any
 
05:09:19.150 --> 05:09:19.160 align:start position:0%
estimates about like we know that people
 
05:09:21.548 --> 05:09:21.558 align:start position:0%
are consuming these products in our
 
05:09:23.548 --> 05:09:23.558 align:start position:0%
state they are going across borders I
 
05:09:25.470 --> 05:09:25.480 align:start position:0%
think that's not really a debatable
 
05:09:27.110 --> 05:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
point do we have any idea what the
 
05:09:29.230 --> 05:09:29.240 align:start position:0%
leakage is and what the capture might be
 
05:09:32.230 --> 05:09:32.240 align:start position:0%
if if we were to pass this bill and how
 
05:09:34.390 --> 05:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
that that captured money would be spent
 
05:09:36.110 --> 05:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
to deal with the unfunded liability
 
05:09:39.708 --> 05:09:39.718 align:start position:0%
issue that it says here on page 24 okay
 
05:09:41.670 --> 05:09:41.680 align:start position:0%
I'll try to answer them in two parts the
 
05:09:44.430 --> 05:09:44.440 align:start position:0%
first part I think unfunded mandates and
 
05:09:44.440 --> 05:09:45.150 align:start position:0%
first part I think unfunded mandates and
and

05:09:45.150 --> 05:09:45.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:09:48.708 --> 05:09:48.718 align:start position:0%
unfunded we have a serious issue with
 
05:09:50.628 --> 05:09:50.638 align:start position:0%
pension funding for small towns which
 
05:09:53.350 --> 05:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
adds which allows those towns and they
 
05:09:55.190 --> 05:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
have to put that onto their property tax
 
05:09:57.990 --> 05:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
whether that's for policemen firemen
 
05:10:00.910 --> 05:10:00.920 align:start position:0%
EMTs teachers Town employees we have to
 
05:10:04.470 --> 05:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
cover those uh what if I remember 68
 
05:10:08.628 --> 05:10:08.638 align:start position:0%
years ago um that percentage of funding
 
05:10:11.270 --> 05:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
by the the state was cut under a
 
05:10:13.910 --> 05:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
previous legislative Administration and
 
05:10:16.310 --> 05:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
that's hurt towns and I think this is
 
05:10:18.868 --> 05:10:18.878 align:start position:0%
one way to help towns is new Revenue
 
05:10:21.230 --> 05:10:21.240 align:start position:0%
that could go for that for P for pension
 
05:10:23.110 --> 05:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
funding I think what's specifically
 
05:10:24.868 --> 05:10:24.878 align:start position:0%
earmarked in the bill regarding
 
05:10:28.270 --> 05:10:28.280 align:start position:0%
education is Paramount we do not fund
 
05:10:30.110 --> 05:10:30.120 align:start position:0%
our community colleges well we do not
 
05:10:32.430 --> 05:10:32.440 align:start position:0%
fund our state colleges well we do not
 
05:10:34.670 --> 05:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
have a smart model for Education funding
 
05:10:37.150 --> 05:10:37.160 align:start position:0%
here we're now in our third goor round
 
05:10:38.990 --> 05:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
of potential Supreme Court decisions
 
05:10:41.548 --> 05:10:41.558 align:start position:0%
around State funding since I've been
 
05:10:45.030 --> 05:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
living in the state in since 2004 so
 
05:10:46.948 --> 05:10:46.958 align:start position:0%
we're what's the definition of insanity
 
05:10:49.190 --> 05:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
right repeating the same action and
 
05:10:50.948 --> 05:10:50.958 align:start position:0%
expecting a different outcome we need to
 
05:10:53.628 --> 05:10:53.638 align:start position:0%
do something different if this is a way
 
05:10:55.708 --> 05:10:55.718 align:start position:0%
that it can change it can
 
05:10:55.718 --> 05:10:57.510 align:start position:0%
that it can change it can
change

05:10:57.510 --> 05:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
change
 
05:11:00.510 --> 05:11:00.520 align:start position:0%
potential Michigan just announced they
 
05:11:02.510 --> 05:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
made $3 billion
 
05:11:04.110 --> 05:11:04.120 align:start position:0%
within their second year of cannabis
 
05:11:07.310 --> 05:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
sales they're using 30% of it for
 
05:11:07.320 --> 05:11:09.590 align:start position:0%
sales they're using 30% of it for
Education

05:11:09.590 --> 05:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
Education
 
05:11:12.830 --> 05:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
funding as it relates to your estimates
 
05:11:17.230 --> 05:11:17.240 align:start position:0%
um last year I did an estimate using the
 
05:11:19.830 --> 05:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
methods that the Department of Revenue
 
05:11:22.430 --> 05:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
looked at in Maine and Massachusetts as
 
05:11:24.830 --> 05:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
well as I assessed other states similar
 
05:11:28.150 --> 05:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
size to New Hampshire and my estimates
 
05:11:29.510 --> 05:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
on behalf of New Hampshire can were
 
05:11:32.270 --> 05:11:32.280 align:start position:0%
somewhere between 18 and 25 Mill million
 
05:11:34.628 --> 05:11:34.638 align:start position:0%
do of our Revenue leaving the state
 
05:11:36.070 --> 05:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
that's New Hampshire residents driving
 
05:11:38.628 --> 05:11:38.638 align:start position:0%
across the border I've since had some
 
05:11:40.430 --> 05:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
conversations with a consultant out of
 
05:11:42.948 --> 05:11:42.958 align:start position:0%
Colorado who told me it's double for the
 
05:11:44.590 --> 05:11:44.600 align:start position:0%
it's double because your tourists are
 
05:11:46.708 --> 05:11:46.718 align:start position:0%
coming in or your other whole operation
 
05:11:48.470 --> 05:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
people that come in to buy it who aren't
 
05:11:50.270 --> 05:11:50.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents so you're
 
05:11:52.270 --> 05:11:52.280 align:start position:0%
looking at a first year only of
 
05:11:55.270 --> 05:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
somewhere around $50 million now we're a
 
05:11:55.280 --> 05:11:56.150 align:start position:0%
somewhere around $50 million now we're a
small

05:11:56.150 --> 05:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
small
 
05:11:58.868 --> 05:11:58.878 align:start position:0%
state but one of the things that we do
 
05:12:01.270 --> 05:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
have our second leading industry right
 
05:12:05.030 --> 05:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
now at about billion doll is the tourism
 
05:12:07.670 --> 05:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
industry right outdoor tourism we
 
05:12:10.788 --> 05:12:10.798 align:start position:0%
created a whole separate entity a
 
05:12:12.948 --> 05:12:12.958 align:start position:0%
separate legal entity of an outdoor
 
05:12:15.590 --> 05:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
tourism office that's a major focus of
 
05:12:18.788 --> 05:12:18.798 align:start position:0%
our economics the governor touts are
 
05:12:21.390 --> 05:12:21.400 align:start position:0%
great outdoor you look at the folks that
 
05:12:23.510 --> 05:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
are outdoor
 
05:12:26.750 --> 05:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
enthusiasts skiers snowboarders mountain
 
05:12:30.310 --> 05:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
bikers hikers I know them they live in
 
05:12:33.310 --> 05:12:33.320 align:start position:0%
the North country with me 3 to one 5 to
 
05:12:34.390 --> 05:12:34.400 align:start position:0%
one they're going to choose cannabis
 
05:12:37.910 --> 05:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:40.190 --> 05:12:40.200 align:start position:0%
anytime I hope that was helpful thank
 
05:12:40.200 --> 05:12:41.390 align:start position:0%
anytime I hope that was helpful thank
you

05:12:51.788 --> 05:12:51.798 align:start position:0%
kahill who was opposed to the bill and
 
05:12:55.788 --> 05:12:55.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:57.868 --> 05:12:57.878 align:start position:0%
commission thank you Mr chair good
 
05:13:00.030 --> 05:13:00.040 align:start position:0%
afternoon friends and colleagues and
 
05:13:02.990 --> 05:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
friends in the audience obviously um I'm
 
05:13:04.868 --> 05:13:04.878 align:start position:0%
here in total opposition to this bill
 
05:13:07.310 --> 05:13:07.320 align:start position:0%
it's never the right time to put more
 
05:13:10.510 --> 05:13:10.520 align:start position:0%
drugs on the streets of New Hampshire um
 
05:13:12.708 --> 05:13:12.718 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to clarify a couple of
 
05:13:14.788 --> 05:13:14.798 align:start position:0%
things all of our hearings at the
 
05:13:16.470 --> 05:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
marijuana commission were open to the
 
05:13:19.708 --> 05:13:19.718 align:start position:0%
public and everyone was welcome um I
 
05:13:22.070 --> 05:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
didn't see too many of you guys at those
 
05:13:23.708 --> 05:13:23.718 align:start position:0%
hearings but there's some really great
 
05:13:25.628 --> 05:13:25.638 align:start position:0%
information at those hearings we had we
 
05:13:27.510 --> 05:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
heard lots of testimony that might have
 
05:13:29.548 --> 05:13:29.558 align:start position:0%
answered representative McHugh's
 
05:13:32.030 --> 05:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
question about um you know whether
 
05:13:33.830 --> 05:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
doctors can actually legally prescribe
 
05:13:35.150 --> 05:13:35.160 align:start position:0%
this in in the state of New Hampshire
 
05:13:36.270 --> 05:13:36.280 align:start position:0%
and stuff like that I think you were
 
05:13:39.628 --> 05:13:39.638 align:start position:0%
asking along those lines um possibly and
 
05:13:43.628 --> 05:13:43.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:49.030 --> 05:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
um we just need to recognize that no
 
05:13:51.510 --> 05:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
Futures and the governor aren't the only
 
05:13:54.788 --> 05:13:54.798 align:start position:0%
voice that um in the state of New
 
05:13:56.150 --> 05:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they don't make all the
 
05:13:58.670 --> 05:13:58.680 align:start position:0%
decisions we have a huge population and
 
05:14:00.510 --> 05:14:00.520 align:start position:0%
I would disagree with the um the
 
05:14:02.788 --> 05:14:02.798 align:start position:0%
statement that 80% of the
 
05:14:06.868 --> 05:14:06.878 align:start position:0%
population um wants marijuana sold in
 
05:14:09.230 --> 05:14:09.240 align:start position:0%
the state I think if they knew the facts
 
05:14:11.110 --> 05:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
and we actually honestly gave them the
 
05:14:14.510 --> 05:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
facts about the hazards of marijuana and
 
05:14:16.830 --> 05:14:16.840 align:start position:0%
and with our traffic fatalities the
 
05:14:18.590 --> 05:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
actual stats on that which you can all
 
05:14:20.150 --> 05:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
go back and listen to some really great
 
05:14:22.670 --> 05:14:22.680 align:start position:0%
testimony but none of you none of you
 
05:14:25.110 --> 05:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
were there for um but the marijuana
 
05:14:26.470 --> 05:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
commission and I want to correct for the
 
05:14:27.910 --> 05:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
record with with chairman hunt the
 
05:14:30.670 --> 05:14:30.680 align:start position:0%
marijuana commission uh voted down that
 
05:14:33.628 --> 05:14:33.638 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation um and that's all I
 
05:14:36.708 --> 05:14:36.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:39.868 --> 05:14:39.878 align:start position:0%
say no they voted it down because more
 
05:14:42.830 --> 05:14:42.840 align:start position:0%
than half the committee didn't
 
05:14:46.510 --> 05:14:46.520 align:start position:0%
vote well a loss is still a
 
05:14:50.150 --> 05:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
loss no I think it lacked a
 
05:14:56.510 --> 05:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:01.390 --> 05:15:01.400 align:start position:0%
spear hi uh I shouldn't say hi thank you
 
05:15:04.948 --> 05:15:04.958 align:start position:0%
uh my question is this the there I live
 
05:15:08.910 --> 05:15:08.920 align:start position:0%
right near Tings Boro and there is a mar
 
05:15:11.390 --> 05:15:11.400 align:start position:0%
marijuana shop there and I see the lines
 
05:15:14.788 --> 05:15:14.798 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire cars going there do we
 
05:15:17.590 --> 05:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
are we seriously pretending that people
 
05:15:22.070 --> 05:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
don't want to to get marijuana from M
 
05:15:23.750 --> 05:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
they're not doing it they're not getting
 
05:15:25.590 --> 05:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
it from Massachusetts and they're not
 
05:15:27.270 --> 05:15:27.280 align:start position:0%
getting it from verant and then not
 
05:15:29.708 --> 05:15:29.718 align:start position:0%
getting it from Maine when in fact we
 
05:15:33.190 --> 05:15:33.200 align:start position:0%
know they are because we see them
 
05:15:34.628 --> 05:15:34.638 align:start position:0%
um I think you're right I think there
 
05:15:36.510 --> 05:15:36.520 align:start position:0%
are people crossing States lines
 
05:15:38.510 --> 05:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
illegally with marijuana into the state
 
05:15:40.310 --> 05:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and and I don't think
 
05:15:42.590 --> 05:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
that we should be saying that that's a
 
05:15:43.670 --> 05:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
good thing I think we should be
 
05:15:45.990 --> 05:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
enforcing our laws yeah there's there's
 
05:15:48.470 --> 05:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
people smoking weed in this state but is
 
05:15:52.590 --> 05:15:52.600 align:start position:0%
it a good idea I mean we can look at
 
05:15:54.948 --> 05:15:54.958 align:start position:0%
examples of say the school shootings
 
05:15:56.910 --> 05:15:56.920 align:start position:0%
from around the country almost
 
05:15:58.750 --> 05:15:58.760 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly all of the School
 
05:16:00.910 --> 05:16:00.920 align:start position:0%
shooters have tested positive for
 
05:16:02.548 --> 05:16:02.558 align:start position:0%
cannabis and there's lots of mental
 
05:16:04.150 --> 05:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
illness problems from the use of it
 
05:16:04.160 --> 05:16:05.310 align:start position:0%
illness problems from the use of it
cannabis

05:16:05.310 --> 05:16:05.320 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
05:16:08.310 --> 05:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
disorder it it's it's a fact the these
 
05:16:08.320 --> 05:16:13.430 align:start position:0%
disorder it it's it's a fact the these
are

05:16:13.430 --> 05:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:16.350 --> 05:16:16.360 align:start position:0%
facts pusk has a question thank you Mr
 
05:16:19.510 --> 05:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
chairman as a member of the
 
05:16:23.990 --> 05:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
committee are you aware if there is any
 
05:16:28.230 --> 05:16:28.240 align:start position:0%
successful test for marijuana
 
05:16:30.110 --> 05:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
intoxication no um the chief's
 
05:16:31.750 --> 05:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
Association was um raising those
 
05:16:33.470 --> 05:16:33.480 align:start position:0%
questions in our hearing there's a good
 
05:16:35.270 --> 05:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
couple hours of testimony you can go
 
05:16:37.670 --> 05:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
back and listen to our conversation on
 
05:16:40.070 --> 05:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
that um there's a few states that have a
 
05:16:41.788 --> 05:16:41.798 align:start position:0%
couple of and that's a great point they
 
05:16:44.590 --> 05:16:44.600 align:start position:0%
have a couple of testing systems in
 
05:16:47.030 --> 05:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
place but there's no set guideline
 
05:16:49.230 --> 05:16:49.240 align:start position:0%
there's no no same place as doing the
 
05:16:51.670 --> 05:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
tests the same way there's there's not a
 
05:16:53.230 --> 05:16:53.240 align:start position:0%
blood test or anything like that that's
 
05:16:54.868 --> 05:16:54.878 align:start position:0%
out there it's
 
05:16:58.110 --> 05:16:58.120 align:start position:0%
been qualified I I guess you could say
 
05:17:00.230 --> 05:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
do I think we should have a test AB
 
05:17:01.670 --> 05:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
absolutely I think New Hampshire should
 
05:17:03.110 --> 05:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
lead the if we're going to legalize weed
 
05:17:05.470 --> 05:17:05.480 align:start position:0%
we should have a test you know we we're
 
05:17:08.310 --> 05:17:08.320 align:start position:0%
putting the horse before the cart here
 
05:17:11.110 --> 05:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
you know we you know new Futures wants
 
05:17:13.190 --> 05:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
this cannab cannabis Advisory board but
 
05:17:14.750 --> 05:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
it wasn't it wasn't really their idea
 
05:17:16.628 --> 05:17:16.638 align:start position:0%
there was a great lady that came from
 
05:17:18.750 --> 05:17:18.760 align:start position:0%
California and testified on why we
 
05:17:20.830 --> 05:17:20.840 align:start position:0%
should have that cannabis Advisory Board
 
05:17:22.230 --> 05:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
and we should be establishing that
 
05:17:23.868 --> 05:17:23.878 align:start position:0%
cannabis Advisory Board before we even
 
05:17:26.070 --> 05:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
go f f further on this we should have
 
05:17:28.868 --> 05:17:28.878 align:start position:0%
the testing so that we can uh enforce
 
05:17:30.910 --> 05:17:30.920 align:start position:0%
our laws I mean we don't want people
 
05:17:36.510 --> 05:17:36.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:38.830 --> 05:17:38.840 align:start position:0%
cannabis representative Burrows no you
 
05:17:40.670 --> 05:17:40.680 align:start position:0%
can't ask a question you spoke okay
 
05:17:44.948 --> 05:17:44.958 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan thank you so I
 
05:17:46.590 --> 05:17:46.600 align:start position:0%
hear you and I understand that you're
 
05:17:48.190 --> 05:17:48.200 align:start position:0%
concerned about the dangers of marijuana
 
05:17:50.390 --> 05:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
I don't dispute that those dangers
 
05:17:53.190 --> 05:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
exist I think the way I I think about it
 
05:17:54.470 --> 05:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
and I want to share with you just to
 
05:17:56.868 --> 05:17:56.878 align:start position:0%
sort of hear your opinion is you just
 
05:17:59.030 --> 05:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
cited potentially you sort of kind of
 
05:18:00.510 --> 05:18:00.520 align:start position:0%
made made a link we won't go whether or
 
05:18:01.910 --> 05:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
not the link between shootings and
 
05:18:04.150 --> 05:18:04.160 align:start position:0%
schools and kids smoking marijuana is is
 
05:18:06.510 --> 05:18:06.520 align:start position:0%
a cause or effect type thing but the
 
05:18:08.670 --> 05:18:08.680 align:start position:0%
fact that there are kids in school
 
05:18:10.948 --> 05:18:10.958 align:start position:0%
smoking marijuana it's already illegal
 
05:18:12.670 --> 05:18:12.680 align:start position:0%
in every state for people under that age
 
05:18:17.030 --> 05:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
to do it so my question for you is about
 
05:18:19.150 --> 05:18:19.160 align:start position:0%
this is people are already breaking the
 
05:18:20.788 --> 05:18:20.798 align:start position:0%
law right and if people are already
 
05:18:22.110 --> 05:18:22.120 align:start position:0%
breaking the law then that means that
 
05:18:25.548 --> 05:18:25.558 align:start position:0%
they're getting marijuana somehow and
 
05:18:27.350 --> 05:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
the marijuana they might be getting may
 
05:18:28.788 --> 05:18:28.798 align:start position:0%
very well be more dangerous i' I've
 
05:18:30.150 --> 05:18:30.160 align:start position:0%
heard about marijuana being laced with
 
05:18:31.548 --> 05:18:31.558 align:start position:0%
things like fentanyl which can cause
 
05:18:32.948 --> 05:18:32.958 align:start position:0%
people to die from an overdose right
 
05:18:36.270 --> 05:18:36.280 align:start position:0%
away so my question for you
 
05:18:38.190 --> 05:18:38.200 align:start position:0%
is and should be for everybody in this
 
05:18:40.590 --> 05:18:40.600 align:start position:0%
room is what is the best way to do harm
 
05:18:42.190 --> 05:18:42.200 align:start position:0%
reduction of something that we know is
 
05:18:44.548 --> 05:18:44.558 align:start position:0%
not a healthy choice we we we have our
 
05:18:45.670 --> 05:18:45.680 align:start position:0%
systems that we try to do that with
 
05:18:47.628 --> 05:18:47.638 align:start position:0%
alcohol which having one drink is not
 
05:18:50.110 --> 05:18:50.120 align:start position:0%
even good for you smoking one joint is
 
05:18:51.628 --> 05:18:51.638 align:start position:0%
not going to be good for you what's the
 
05:18:52.910 --> 05:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
best way to do it you seem to think
 
05:18:54.830 --> 05:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
prohibition is the best way to keep it
 
05:18:57.868 --> 05:18:57.878 align:start position:0%
out of the hands of of the youth and
 
05:19:00.430 --> 05:19:00.440 align:start position:0%
keep our population safe and I think
 
05:19:01.830 --> 05:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
that we could point to plenty of
 
05:19:04.510 --> 05:19:04.520 align:start position:0%
anecdotes at least where very dangerous
 
05:19:06.350 --> 05:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
substance gets introduced into marijuana
 
05:19:08.230 --> 05:19:08.240 align:start position:0%
because it's unregulated so like what is
 
05:19:10.310 --> 05:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
your take on that well you know at the
 
05:19:12.310 --> 05:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
hearings which I sat in and you were on
 
05:19:14.190 --> 05:19:14.200 align:start position:0%
the commission um you you weren't there
 
05:19:15.788 --> 05:19:15.798 align:start position:0%
all the time just like chairman hunt
 
05:19:17.070 --> 05:19:17.080 align:start position:0%
wasn't there all the time you guys had
 
05:19:20.110 --> 05:19:20.120 align:start position:0%
other stuff going on but um I was
 
05:19:23.270 --> 05:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
willing to work with a lot of people on
 
05:19:27.070 --> 05:19:27.080 align:start position:0%
harm reduction and we didn't come to a
 
05:19:29.390 --> 05:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
real agreement on
 
05:19:32.310 --> 05:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
um anything that was strong enough to
 
05:19:35.510 --> 05:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
protect the kids I mean and like fines
 
05:19:37.470 --> 05:19:37.480 align:start position:0%
and penalties and things like that
 
05:19:39.070 --> 05:19:39.080 align:start position:0%
they're not in here you're right our
 
05:19:41.910 --> 05:19:41.920 align:start position:0%
kids are utilizing marijuana and I would
 
05:19:44.470 --> 05:19:44.480 align:start position:0%
say and I would say that they're
 
05:19:46.830 --> 05:19:46.840 align:start position:0%
utilizing the Delta 8 Delta 9 Delta 10
 
05:19:48.750 --> 05:19:48.760 align:start position:0%
THC products that aren't really
 
05:19:51.548 --> 05:19:51.558 align:start position:0%
regulated and or tested because we don't
 
05:19:53.510 --> 05:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
have a lab to test those products in
 
05:19:55.910 --> 05:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
this state you know I think
 
05:19:55.920 --> 05:19:57.788 align:start position:0%
this state you know I think
that

05:19:57.788 --> 05:19:57.798 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:20:01.708 --> 05:20:01.718 align:start position:0%
um obviously I'm completely opposed to
 
05:20:04.230 --> 05:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
legalizing it in the state but if if you
 
05:20:05.868 --> 05:20:05.878 align:start position:0%
everyone that came to those hearings I
 
05:20:07.910 --> 05:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
was I was there working with all my
 
05:20:10.628 --> 05:20:10.638 align:start position:0%
colleagues and having open dialogue we
 
05:20:12.948 --> 05:20:12.958 align:start position:0%
don't have a lab testing facility to
 
05:20:15.510 --> 05:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
test stuff we we would we would need
 
05:20:18.628 --> 05:20:18.638 align:start position:0%
that up and running before any of this
 
05:20:21.110 --> 05:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
should even be considered you know we
 
05:20:23.948 --> 05:20:23.958 align:start position:0%
would need that cannabis Advisory Board
 
05:20:26.190 --> 05:20:26.200 align:start position:0%
um those those the Cannabis Advisory
 
05:20:28.990 --> 05:20:29.000 align:start position:0%
Board um would be able to work and do
 
05:20:31.390 --> 05:20:31.400 align:start position:0%
harm reduction with the kids I mean but
 
05:20:33.628 --> 05:20:33.638 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly I think saying to all the
 
05:20:36.390 --> 05:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
kids at home yeah let's legalize weed
 
05:20:38.230 --> 05:20:38.240 align:start position:0%
isn't isn't a good idea you know what I
 
05:20:40.430 --> 05:20:40.440 align:start position:0%
mean we should be keeping them off weed
 
05:20:43.110 --> 05:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
we we know that men's Brains are still
 
05:20:45.110 --> 05:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
developing until they're 25 years old
 
05:20:47.830 --> 05:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
and we know that cannabis affects brain
 
05:20:47.840 --> 05:20:50.150 align:start position:0%
and we know that cannabis affects brain
development

05:20:50.150 --> 05:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
development
 
05:20:52.990 --> 05:20:53.000 align:start position:0%
follow okay so I hear what you're saying
 
05:20:54.628 --> 05:20:54.638 align:start position:0%
you you were on the commission you you
 
05:20:56.310 --> 05:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
are concerned about you're concerned
 
05:20:58.830 --> 05:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
about um harm reduction but all the
 
05:21:01.150 --> 05:21:01.160 align:start position:0%
things you just listed aren't going to
 
05:21:02.548 --> 05:21:02.558 align:start position:0%
come unless we legalize it so whether we
 
05:21:04.910 --> 05:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
want Labs we want testing facilities we
 
05:21:06.948 --> 05:21:06.958 align:start position:0%
want The Advisory Board all those things
 
05:21:09.470 --> 05:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
come from a path to legalization if
 
05:21:11.910 --> 05:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
those things if those things would
 
05:21:14.390 --> 05:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
actually reduce harm towards
 
05:21:16.670 --> 05:21:16.680 align:start position:0%
children compared to an unregulated
 
05:21:18.030 --> 05:21:18.040 align:start position:0%
system right now is that a better
 
05:21:19.708 --> 05:21:19.718 align:start position:0%
outcome and I think that's the question
 
05:21:20.948 --> 05:21:20.958 align:start position:0%
we need to think about because you're
 
05:21:22.150 --> 05:21:22.160 align:start position:0%
not going to get those things without
 
05:21:23.470 --> 05:21:23.480 align:start position:0%
legalization like that's just the
 
05:21:25.110 --> 05:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
reality of the world we're
 
05:21:30.030 --> 05:21:30.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:30.040 --> 05:21:33.030 align:start position:0%
 
laws

05:21:33.030 --> 05:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
laws

question um and and thank for trying to
 
05:22:03.310 --> 05:22:03.320 align:start position:0%
answer the the part about the
 
05:22:07.430 --> 05:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
qualifications of the people dispensing
 
05:22:07.440 --> 05:22:08.390 align:start position:0%
qualifications of the people dispensing
what

05:22:08.390 --> 05:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
what
 
05:22:12.788 --> 05:22:12.798 align:start position:0%
we're commonly referring to as a medical
 
05:22:15.708 --> 05:22:15.718 align:start position:0%
product are so what I was I wasn't
 
05:22:17.990 --> 05:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
asking about can doctors write it
 
05:22:20.750 --> 05:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
legally I'm asking do did the Commission
 
05:22:23.190 --> 05:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
address the qualifications of these
 
05:22:26.030 --> 05:22:26.040 align:start position:0%
individuals as non-licensed or
 
05:22:28.270 --> 05:22:28.280 align:start position:0%
non-healthcare people for the most part
 
05:22:30.310 --> 05:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
basically clerks in a store we did
 
05:22:31.548 --> 05:22:31.558 align:start position:0%
dispensing it
 
05:22:33.910 --> 05:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
advice as somebody decides whether they
 
05:22:36.470 --> 05:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
should buy this product or that product
 
05:22:38.310 --> 05:22:38.320 align:start position:0%
that's commonly referred to by everybody
 
05:22:40.310 --> 05:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
behind you as a medicinal product with
 
05:22:42.230 --> 05:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
health care benefits essentially Health
 
05:22:44.430 --> 05:22:44.440 align:start position:0%
Care advice right that's my concern is
 
05:22:46.948 --> 05:22:46.958 align:start position:0%
we've got this this issue where in a
 
05:22:49.708 --> 05:22:49.718 align:start position:0%
pharmacy the tech can't even hand you a
 
05:22:51.110 --> 05:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
new prescription you've got to go see
 
05:22:53.190 --> 05:22:53.200 align:start position:0%
the pharmacist if you've never taken
 
05:22:55.310 --> 05:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
this brand of aspirin before even though
 
05:22:56.788 --> 05:22:56.798 align:start position:0%
it's a prescription you have to go see
 
05:22:58.548 --> 05:22:58.558 align:start position:0%
him but here we're talking about
 
05:23:00.548 --> 05:23:00.558 align:start position:0%
something that has different I'm that's
 
05:23:02.110 --> 05:23:02.120 align:start position:0%
I'm Wonder did you guys address that at
 
05:23:04.430 --> 05:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
all we we did address that we we we had
 
05:23:05.350 --> 05:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
all the
 
05:23:07.868 --> 05:23:07.878 align:start position:0%
atc's sitting at the table and we asked
 
05:23:09.708 --> 05:23:09.718 align:start position:0%
them lots of questions we heard from
 
05:23:11.628 --> 05:23:11.638 align:start position:0%
medical doctors but we asked all the
 
05:23:14.990 --> 05:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
atcs I mean I personally asked them um
 
05:23:17.350 --> 05:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
if they had any doctors working in their
 
05:23:21.230 --> 05:23:21.240 align:start position:0%
facility MDS and they didn't they do
 
05:23:23.390 --> 05:23:23.400 align:start position:0%
they heard they do didn't there was zero
 
05:23:25.270 --> 05:23:25.280 align:start position:0%
zero zero doctors working at the
 
05:23:27.310 --> 05:23:27.320 align:start position:0%
facility so the rest of the employees
 
05:23:29.190 --> 05:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
that were offering potential medical
 
05:23:31.470 --> 05:23:31.480 align:start position:0%
advice weren't doctors
 
05:23:34.548 --> 05:23:34.558 align:start position:0%
weren't really licensed in any capacity
 
05:23:36.350 --> 05:23:36.360 align:start position:0%
and were could have just been a kid off
 
05:23:38.190 --> 05:23:38.200 align:start position:0%
the street right you know I mean
 
05:23:42.230 --> 05:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
hopefully a 21-year-old kid but um that
 
05:23:45.510 --> 05:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
there really wasn't any kind of
 
05:23:48.910 --> 05:23:48.920 align:start position:0%
program or real training that we were
 
05:23:51.430 --> 05:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
shown that they were giving credible
 
05:23:53.990 --> 05:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
medical advice there is no credible
 
05:23:54.000 --> 05:23:57.070 align:start position:0%
medical advice there is no credible

3 uh hb1 1633 and other efforts to
 
05:24:36.948 --> 05:24:36.958 align:start position:0%

Health consequences and safety
 
05:24:41.270 --> 05:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
consequences for granite Staters
 
05:24:43.708 --> 05:24:43.718 align:start position:0%
particularly our youth according to the
 
05:24:45.708 --> 05:24:45.718 align:start position:0%
methodology subsection in this bill
 
05:24:47.150 --> 05:24:47.160 align:start position:0%
which documents the New Hampshire
 
05:24:49.590 --> 05:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
Department of safety's concerns data
 
05:24:51.270 --> 05:24:51.280 align:start position:0%
from other legalized States highlight
 
05:24:53.628 --> 05:24:53.638 align:start position:0%
the following concerning factors
 
05:24:55.270 --> 05:24:55.280 align:start position:0%
marijuana use in both Illinois and
 
05:24:57.150 --> 05:24:57.160 align:start position:0%
Colorado has increased significantly
 
05:24:59.670 --> 05:24:59.680 align:start position:0%
since legalization including minor age
 
05:25:02.230 --> 05:25:02.240 align:start position:0%
children the average THC level in
 
05:25:04.590 --> 05:25:04.600 align:start position:0%
marijuana products has Ren risen from 3
 
05:25:08.150 --> 05:25:08.160 align:start position:0%
to 23% in smokable marijuana and from 56
 
05:25:11.628 --> 05:25:11.638 align:start position:0%
to 99% in other forms such as waxes oils
 
05:25:11.638 --> 05:25:12.910 align:start position:0%
to 99% in other forms such as waxes oils
and

05:25:12.910 --> 05:25:12.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:25:15.548 --> 05:25:15.558 align:start position:0%
Edibles despite legalization marijuana
 
05:25:17.310 --> 05:25:17.320 align:start position:0%
trafficking and black market marijuana
 
05:25:19.390 --> 05:25:19.400 align:start position:0%
continue to be in enforcement challenges
 
05:25:21.190 --> 05:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
in both States and all states actually
 
05:25:24.030 --> 05:25:24.040 align:start position:0%
who legalize treatment for marijuana use
 
05:25:26.470 --> 05:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
in Colorado has decreased in suicide
 
05:25:28.948 --> 05:25:28.958 align:start position:0%
incidents in which toxicology results
 
05:25:30.670 --> 05:25:30.680 align:start position:0%
were positive for marijuana have in
 
05:25:32.830 --> 05:25:32.840 align:start position:0%
increased I actually just someone sent
 
05:25:36.310 --> 05:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
me an article today and in Colorado of
 
05:25:42.030 --> 05:25:42.040 align:start position:0%
all the Teen suicides around 50% of um
 
05:25:44.788 --> 05:25:44.798 align:start position:0%
white children is marijuana is in their
 
05:25:47.270 --> 05:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
system Hispanic children it goes up a
 
05:25:50.390 --> 05:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
little bit more and for black youth it's
 
05:25:52.750 --> 05:25:52.760 align:start position:0%
actually 67% so
 
05:25:55.590 --> 05:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
67% of people that kill themselves in as
 
05:25:58.230 --> 05:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
teens in Colorado they test positive for
 
05:26:01.788 --> 05:26:01.798 align:start position:0%
marijuana in the toxicology results
 
05:26:03.350 --> 05:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
of note this bill would fund a new
 
05:26:05.788 --> 05:26:05.798 align:start position:0%
position to provide statistics on the
 
05:26:07.548 --> 05:26:07.558 align:start position:0%
effects of legalization in New Hampshire
 
05:26:08.670 --> 05:26:08.680 align:start position:0%
and according to the Department of
 
05:26:10.510 --> 05:26:10.520 align:start position:0%
Safety the requirements of this position
 
05:26:12.390 --> 05:26:12.400 align:start position:0%
and the current lack of agency data
 
05:26:14.788 --> 05:26:14.798 align:start position:0%
being collected now makes this a very
 
05:26:17.590 --> 05:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
underfunded task before it even Begins
 
05:26:19.548 --> 05:26:19.558 align:start position:0%
the lack of resource allocation and lack
 
05:26:21.110 --> 05:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
of attention being paid to data
 
05:26:23.788 --> 05:26:23.798 align:start position:0%
collection communicates The Reckless and
 
05:26:25.548 --> 05:26:25.558 align:start position:0%
shortsighted approach that we're taking
 
05:26:28.070 --> 05:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
towards legalization I'd like to Echo
 
05:26:29.830 --> 05:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
what rep kahill said we're putting the
 
05:26:32.390 --> 05:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
cart before the horse in so many
 
05:26:34.910 --> 05:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
ways this funded position is merely a
 
05:26:36.430 --> 05:26:36.440 align:start position:0%
rubber stamp inclusion to give the
 
05:26:38.708 --> 05:26:38.718 align:start position:0%
impression that we are actually serious
 
05:26:40.910 --> 05:26:40.920 align:start position:0%
about analyzing data and looking at
 
05:26:43.548 --> 05:26:43.558 align:start position:0%
harms that would happen as a result of
 
05:26:45.750 --> 05:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
legalization data from legalized States
 
05:26:47.350 --> 05:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
has clearly shown that recreational
 
05:26:49.030 --> 05:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
legalization does not live up to any
 
05:26:51.628 --> 05:26:51.638 align:start position:0%
promises it will not make a safer
 
05:26:54.750 --> 05:26:54.760 align:start position:0%
product for the market it will result in
 
05:26:57.030 --> 05:26:57.040 align:start position:0%
higher addiction rates it will not in
 
05:26:58.990 --> 05:26:59.000 align:start position:0%
any way help fund adequate addiction
 
05:27:01.628 --> 05:27:01.638 align:start position:0%
treatment programs it will cause a
 
05:27:03.548 --> 05:27:03.558 align:start position:0%
mental ill more mental illness in our
 
05:27:05.350 --> 05:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
teens despite the fact that they can't
 
05:27:07.628 --> 05:27:07.638 align:start position:0%
legally purchase it because it floods
 
05:27:09.510 --> 05:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
the market in the state with more
 
05:27:11.110 --> 05:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
available marijuana that they have
 
05:27:11.120 --> 05:27:12.310 align:start position:0%
available marijuana that they have
access

05:27:12.310 --> 05:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
access
 
05:27:15.510 --> 05:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
to and this will not amarate any social
 
05:27:17.548 --> 05:27:17.558 align:start position:0%
justice issues and most likely result in
 
05:27:17.558 --> 05:27:18.350 align:start position:0%
justice issues and most likely result in
more

05:27:18.350 --> 05:27:18.360 align:start position:0%
more
 
05:27:21.590 --> 05:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
Injustice also um vulnerable minority
 
05:27:23.270 --> 05:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
and economically challenged communities
 
05:27:25.310 --> 05:27:25.320 align:start position:0%
will continue to be significantly
 
05:27:28.788 --> 05:27:28.798 align:start position:0%
negatively impacted by
 
05:27:31.230 --> 05:27:31.240 align:start position:0%
legalization in addition to in addition
 
05:27:32.670 --> 05:27:32.680 align:start position:0%
to all this legalization does not
 
05:27:34.830 --> 05:27:34.840 align:start position:0%
decrease the black market I actually uh
 
05:27:36.230 --> 05:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
work for the Department of Emergency
 
05:27:38.510 --> 05:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
Management Oklahoma I used to live there
 
05:27:40.708 --> 05:27:40.718 align:start position:0%
so I work remotely for them this is
 
05:27:42.270 --> 05:27:42.280 align:start position:0%
something they deal with Oklahoma is a
 
05:27:45.230 --> 05:27:45.240 align:start position:0%
state that had uh they did just medical
 
05:27:47.430 --> 05:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
marijuana they just recently resounded
 
05:27:49.868 --> 05:27:49.878 align:start position:0%
shot down recreational
 
05:27:52.230 --> 05:27:52.240 align:start position:0%
legalization um Oklahoma is actually
 
05:27:54.788 --> 05:27:54.798 align:start position:0%
having a problem where they have uh
 
05:27:56.150 --> 05:27:56.160 align:start position:0%
they're supplying the country with the
 
05:27:58.030 --> 05:27:58.040 align:start position:0%
largest amount of black uh Market
 
05:27:59.750 --> 05:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
marijuana and it's something that their
 
05:28:01.230 --> 05:28:01.240 align:start position:0%
attorney general trying to get a handle
 
05:28:04.430 --> 05:28:04.440 align:start position:0%
on and um much like Maine which I'll
 
05:28:06.948 --> 05:28:06.958 align:start position:0%
touch upon in a minute uh
 
05:28:08.830 --> 05:28:08.840 align:start position:0%
trans uh excuse me Criminal
 
05:28:10.470 --> 05:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
organizations are just taking advantage
 
05:28:13.350 --> 05:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
of the grow laws
 
05:28:15.708 --> 05:28:15.718 align:start position:0%
there uh one of the things according to
 
05:28:17.590 --> 05:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
the data compiled by the record Center
 
05:28:19.470 --> 05:28:19.480 align:start position:0%
of alcohol and substance use studies
 
05:28:21.350 --> 05:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
which is a multidisiplinary Institute
 
05:28:22.830 --> 05:28:22.840 align:start position:0%
dedicated to addiction research
 
05:28:25.030 --> 05:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
education training the black market in
 
05:28:27.470 --> 05:28:27.480 align:start position:0%
color in California is thriving despite
 
05:28:29.948 --> 05:28:29.958 align:start position:0%
the promises made by legalization as a
 
05:28:31.430 --> 05:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
matter of fact fact the Black Market has
 
05:28:33.708 --> 05:28:33.718 align:start position:0%
actually eclipsed the legal market and
 
05:28:35.590 --> 05:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
why is that because the black market
 
05:28:37.990 --> 05:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
will always beat your
 
05:28:40.510 --> 05:28:40.520 align:start position:0%
price uh Colorado Oregon and Washington
 
05:28:42.868 --> 05:28:42.878 align:start position:0%
State are Al all also finding out that
 
05:28:44.948 --> 05:28:44.958 align:start position:0%
the black market continues to remain a
 
05:28:47.190 --> 05:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
problem for them currently our neighbors
 
05:28:48.510 --> 05:28:48.520 align:start position:0%
in Maine are dealing with hundreds of
 
05:28:50.470 --> 05:28:50.480 align:start position:0%
Black Market Farms operated IL legally
 
05:28:52.030 --> 05:28:52.040 align:start position:0%
by Asian transnational criminal
 
05:28:53.788 --> 05:28:53.798 align:start position:0%
organizations which are flocking to the
 
05:28:55.390 --> 05:28:55.400 align:start position:0%
state to Eng gratiate themselves in the
 
05:28:57.788 --> 05:28:57.798 align:start position:0%
rural landscape we've got quite a bit of
 
05:28:59.430 --> 05:28:59.440 align:start position:0%
rural landscape here in New Hampshire as
 
05:29:02.150 --> 05:29:02.160 align:start position:0%
well uh worse yet this is an issue that
 
05:29:03.868 --> 05:29:03.878 align:start position:0%
neither the US Department of Homeland
 
05:29:06.070 --> 05:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
Security nor Maine's law enforcement
 
05:29:08.628 --> 05:29:08.638 align:start position:0%
agencies can get a handle on it's
 
05:29:10.390 --> 05:29:10.400 align:start position:0%
further worrisome that in addition in
 
05:29:12.030 --> 05:29:12.040 align:start position:0%
addition to the negative Health outcomes
 
05:29:13.948 --> 05:29:13.958 align:start position:0%
in the continuation of Black Market
 
05:29:16.310 --> 05:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
influences states have legalized he a
 
05:29:17.750 --> 05:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
marked increase in traffic deaths
 
05:29:19.470 --> 05:29:19.480 align:start position:0%
involving drivers who tested positive
 
05:29:22.230 --> 05:29:22.240 align:start position:0%
for marijuana in incidence of
 
05:29:25.070 --> 05:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
DUI this means that even if a
 
05:29:27.830 --> 05:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
responsible parent like myself I try to
 
05:29:29.910 --> 05:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
do my best I have four kids you could
 
05:29:32.868 --> 05:29:32.878 align:start position:0%
work years to raise your kids you could
 
05:29:34.350 --> 05:29:34.360 align:start position:0%
try to do your best to keep them my
 
05:29:36.110 --> 05:29:36.120 align:start position:0%
drugs particularly in a state that will
 
05:29:38.070 --> 05:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
sell drugs to them the minute that they
 
05:29:40.910 --> 05:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
turn 21 legally and they could still get
 
05:29:43.390 --> 05:29:43.400 align:start position:0%
killed by somebody who's driving Under
 
05:29:43.400 --> 05:29:44.670 align:start position:0%
killed by somebody who's driving Under
the

05:29:44.670 --> 05:29:44.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:29:48.230 --> 05:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
Influence that as a parent that it
 
05:29:50.070 --> 05:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
breaks my heart it really breaks my
 
05:29:52.628 --> 05:29:52.638 align:start position:0%
heart and and we know in States IL
 
05:29:55.390 --> 05:29:55.400 align:start position:0%
legalized that it's statistically is it
 
05:29:57.708 --> 05:29:57.718 align:start position:0%
increases DUIs it's just
 
05:30:00.750 --> 05:30:00.760 align:start position:0%
data so we have to ask ourselves
 
05:30:02.868 --> 05:30:02.878 align:start position:0%
you know why are we doing this and we're
 
05:30:04.430 --> 05:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
doing this because New Hampshire has a
 
05:30:07.628 --> 05:30:07.638 align:start position:0%
spending problem and everyone's hoping
 
05:30:09.910 --> 05:30:09.920 align:start position:0%
that this will be a Magic Bullet and
 
05:30:12.310 --> 05:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
we're it's a it's a straw man argument
 
05:30:14.948 --> 05:30:14.958 align:start position:0%
and all we're talking about is money
 
05:30:16.350 --> 05:30:16.360 align:start position:0%
here that's what we're talking about all
 
05:30:17.590 --> 05:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
of this we're all just keep talking
 
05:30:20.150 --> 05:30:20.160 align:start position:0%
about money the reality is we're not
 
05:30:21.628 --> 05:30:21.638 align:start position:0%
really having the conversations that we
 
05:30:23.310 --> 05:30:23.320 align:start position:0%
need to have about our spending if
 
05:30:24.670 --> 05:30:24.680 align:start position:0%
somebody actually really wanted to talk
 
05:30:26.708 --> 05:30:26.718 align:start position:0%
about spending we'd really probably talk
 
05:30:29.830 --> 05:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
about why why in our school systems our
 
05:30:32.548 --> 05:30:32.558 align:start position:0%
administ rative cost going up teachers
 
05:30:35.310 --> 05:30:35.320 align:start position:0%
going down and student populations going
 
05:30:37.430 --> 05:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
down those are good conversations to
 
05:30:41.430 --> 05:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
have um you know it's just a reality
 
05:30:43.628 --> 05:30:43.638 align:start position:0%
that that quite frankly I heard in
 
05:30:45.670 --> 05:30:45.680 align:start position:0%
previous testimony that we call this a
 
05:30:47.628 --> 05:30:47.638 align:start position:0%
voluntary tax and we you know how great
 
05:30:50.110 --> 05:30:50.120 align:start position:0%
it is that we have this I honestly it's
 
05:30:53.548 --> 05:30:53.558 align:start position:0%
an addiction tax because the whole thing
 
05:30:56.030 --> 05:30:56.040 align:start position:0%
is based off of how many people can we
 
05:30:58.948 --> 05:30:58.958 align:start position:0%
get to smoke pot so that we can have
 
05:31:02.350 --> 05:31:02.360 align:start position:0%
more money to spend on schools and
 
05:31:02.360 --> 05:31:04.430 align:start position:0%
more money to spend on schools and
addiction

05:31:04.430 --> 05:31:04.440 align:start position:0%
addiction
 
05:31:07.470 --> 05:31:07.480 align:start position:0%
treatment and and I'd like to La lastly
 
05:31:09.548 --> 05:31:09.558 align:start position:0%
I would like to address the reducing
 
05:31:12.070 --> 05:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
harms um I would love to have a
 
05:31:14.070 --> 05:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
conversation more about reducing harms I
 
05:31:15.830 --> 05:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
think that could be a very bipartisan
 
05:31:18.470 --> 05:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
wonderful conversation to have and if we
 
05:31:20.190 --> 05:31:20.200 align:start position:0%
really want to look to reduce harms one
 
05:31:21.548 --> 05:31:21.558 align:start position:0%
of the things that we would actually be
 
05:31:23.868 --> 05:31:23.878 align:start position:0%
talking about is we would talk more in
 
05:31:25.990 --> 05:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
these in these conversations about the
 
05:31:29.230 --> 05:31:29.240 align:start position:0%
science of marijuana harms we would talk
 
05:31:31.070 --> 05:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
more about the physi ological changes it
 
05:31:33.070 --> 05:31:33.080 align:start position:0%
does to people like rep kill was saying
 
05:31:36.070 --> 05:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
under 25 and Beyond we would talk about
 
05:31:38.868 --> 05:31:38.878 align:start position:0%
how it increases psychosis in adults who
 
05:31:41.230 --> 05:31:41.240 align:start position:0%
regularly use cannabis and more
 
05:31:42.990 --> 05:31:43.000 align:start position:0%
importantly we would start actually
 
05:31:45.190 --> 05:31:45.200 align:start position:0%
having bills about collecting data we
 
05:31:46.948 --> 05:31:46.958 align:start position:0%
could actually have bills that that
 
05:31:48.830 --> 05:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
mandate that hospitals can collect how
 
05:31:50.628 --> 05:31:50.638 align:start position:0%
many people come through their doors
 
05:31:52.750 --> 05:31:52.760 align:start position:0%
with cannabis use disorder those would
 
05:31:56.548 --> 05:31:56.558 align:start position:0%
be wonderful and um and that that's
 
05:31:58.628 --> 05:31:58.638 align:start position:0%
pretty much what what I'd like to say I
 
05:31:59.788 --> 05:31:59.798 align:start position:0%
I guess I'd just like to leave you with
 
05:32:01.628 --> 05:32:01.638 align:start position:0%
this thought what what price are are you
 
05:32:03.230 --> 05:32:03.240 align:start position:0%
all willing to put on the mental and
 
05:32:05.670 --> 05:32:05.680 align:start position:0%
physical health of our
 
05:32:08.628 --> 05:32:08.638 align:start position:0%
youth and to be honestly the multitude
 
05:32:09.830 --> 05:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
of new addicts that we're going to
 
05:32:11.910 --> 05:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
create with legalization we can't
 
05:32:13.548 --> 05:32:13.558 align:start position:0%
control the fact that it's that people
 
05:32:15.230 --> 05:32:15.240 align:start position:0%
go over to Massachusetts or Vermont or
 
05:32:18.708 --> 05:32:18.718 align:start position:0%
Maine to get to get their weed um we
 
05:32:21.310 --> 05:32:21.320 align:start position:0%
just we just can't but but we could
 
05:32:23.150 --> 05:32:23.160 align:start position:0%
actually decide to have some sanity in
 
05:32:25.590 --> 05:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
that because we know based off data that
 
05:32:28.110 --> 05:32:28.120 align:start position:0%
in every legalized State you will start
 
05:32:30.510 --> 05:32:30.520 align:start position:0%
compromising the youth thank you for
 
05:32:34.270 --> 05:32:34.280 align:start position:0%
your time yes ma'am well I'll the chair
 
05:32:34.280 --> 05:32:36.390 align:start position:0%
your time yes ma'am well I'll the chair
I'm

05:32:36.390 --> 05:32:36.400 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
05:32:39.190 --> 05:32:39.200 align:start position:0%
sorry representative
 
05:32:42.150 --> 05:32:42.160 align:start position:0%
buo thank you we take my question what
 
05:32:44.990 --> 05:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
about liquor in the state can you
 
05:32:47.470 --> 05:32:47.480 align:start position:0%
maybe a statement about liquor I
 
05:32:49.948 --> 05:32:49.958 align:start position:0%
appreciate that but but sometimes when
 
05:32:52.110 --> 05:32:52.120 align:start position:0%
we have these conversations people try
 
05:32:54.390 --> 05:32:54.400 align:start position:0%
to make these moral equivalences today
 
05:32:56.070 --> 05:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
we're we're hearing and we're talking
 
05:32:58.350 --> 05:32:58.360 align:start position:0%
about HB
 
05:33:00.948 --> 05:33:00.958 align:start position:0%
1633 and with all due respect I'd rather
 
05:33:02.670 --> 05:33:02.680 align:start position:0%
not have a moral equivalent straw man
 
05:33:05.310 --> 05:33:05.320 align:start position:0%
argument on what about liquor you were
 
05:33:07.150 --> 05:33:07.160 align:start position:0%
just talking about schools further
 
05:33:09.670 --> 05:33:09.680 align:start position:0%
question no I do have a question do you
 
05:33:12.590 --> 05:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
have data from uh the 1970s because I
 
05:33:14.190 --> 05:33:14.200 align:start position:0%
think there was a lot of marijuana use
 
05:33:16.708 --> 05:33:16.718 align:start position:0%
you know back in the 70s 80s 9s this
 
05:33:19.350 --> 05:33:19.360 align:start position:0%
isn't just like happening now because of
 
05:33:21.910 --> 05:33:21.920 align:start position:0%
legalization in other states yes ma'am
 
05:33:23.628 --> 05:33:23.638 align:start position:0%
and I I guess I would I would ask a
 
05:33:25.628 --> 05:33:25.638 align:start position:0%
question back is do you have any data on
 
05:33:27.628 --> 05:33:27.638 align:start position:0%
what's been going on with the THC levels
 
05:33:29.670 --> 05:33:29.680 align:start position:0%
I mean I I did I actually read you the
 
05:33:29.680 --> 05:33:30.628 align:start position:0%
I mean I I did I actually read you the
data

05:33:30.628 --> 05:33:30.638 align:start position:0%
data
 
05:33:32.708 --> 05:33:32.718 align:start position:0%
um I don't have it from the 70s but I'll
 
05:33:34.230 --> 05:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
I'll reread the data to you in case you
 
05:33:37.270 --> 05:33:37.280 align:start position:0%
maybe didn't hear that average THC THC
 
05:33:38.948 --> 05:33:38.958 align:start position:0%
levels in marijuana products has risen
 
05:33:41.708 --> 05:33:41.718 align:start position:0%
from 3 to 23% in smokable marijuana and
 
05:33:45.430 --> 05:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
56 to 99% in other forms marijuana is
 
05:33:47.270 --> 05:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
actually being genetically modified to
 
05:33:49.788 --> 05:33:49.798 align:start position:0%
have a THC punch that nobody in the 70s
 
05:33:51.830 --> 05:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
could have ever imagined and as a result
 
05:33:54.150 --> 05:33:54.160 align:start position:0%
we're seeing more psychosis more
 
05:33:56.830 --> 05:33:56.840 align:start position:0%
addiction as a matter of fact Vermont
 
05:33:59.948 --> 05:33:59.958 align:start position:0%
Vermont's medical um medical advisory
 
05:34:02.350 --> 05:34:02.360 align:start position:0%
board recommended some measures to them
 
05:34:05.110 --> 05:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
about two years ago stop advertising it
 
05:34:06.750 --> 05:34:06.760 align:start position:0%
because they're seeing such a Negative
 
05:34:08.628 --> 05:34:08.638 align:start position:0%
population they're having such an issue
 
05:34:11.150 --> 05:34:11.160 align:start position:0%
with uh addiction and Vermont now has
 
05:34:13.470 --> 05:34:13.480 align:start position:0%
the sad distinction of being one of the
 
05:34:16.310 --> 05:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
highest states with the highest an uh
 
05:34:19.070 --> 05:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
highest amount of addicted 13 to seven
 
05:34:21.270 --> 05:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
year 17 year olds since
 
05:34:23.910 --> 05:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
legalization I guess they're high
 
05:34:23.920 --> 05:34:25.270 align:start position:0%
legalization I guess they're high
representative

05:34:25.270 --> 05:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:34:28.430 --> 05:34:28.440 align:start position:0%
Sullivan thank you so I I actually like
 
05:34:30.470 --> 05:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
one of your ideas about harm reduction
 
05:34:32.990 --> 05:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of maybe we can work together
 
05:34:34.548 --> 05:34:34.558 align:start position:0%
to come up with some sort of Bill or
 
05:34:36.590 --> 05:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
requirement for hospitals to keep track
 
05:34:39.708 --> 05:34:39.718 align:start position:0%
of psychosis or whatever and and see if
 
05:34:41.628 --> 05:34:41.638 align:start position:0%
we could I mean I think collecting data
 
05:34:43.190 --> 05:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
will always inform us in the future for
 
05:34:47.030 --> 05:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
making better bills and policies um on
 
05:34:48.868 --> 05:34:48.878 align:start position:0%
the other thing that was a would you
 
05:34:50.708 --> 05:34:50.718 align:start position:0%
believe and so my question
 
05:34:52.510 --> 05:34:52.520 align:start position:0%
is I know you don't want to make the
 
05:34:53.948 --> 05:34:53.958 align:start position:0%
moral equipment sleep I don't think it
 
05:34:56.670 --> 05:34:56.680 align:start position:0%
is you said that we will always the
 
05:34:58.470 --> 05:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
black m will always undercut marijuana
 
05:34:59.910 --> 05:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
because it's always going to be cheaper
 
05:35:01.510 --> 05:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
why doesn't that happen with alcohol why
 
05:35:04.110 --> 05:35:04.120 align:start position:0%
does that not happen with tobacco is it
 
05:35:06.948 --> 05:35:06.958 align:start position:0%
because it's still a fledgling industry
 
05:35:08.948 --> 05:35:08.958 align:start position:0%
that is not legal federally that it's
 
05:35:10.628 --> 05:35:10.638 align:start position:0%
not legal in every state I mean right
 
05:35:12.510 --> 05:35:12.520 align:start position:0%
now we don't see a major Black Market
 
05:35:14.510 --> 05:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
problem in alcohol or tobacco anywhere
 
05:35:16.990 --> 05:35:17.000 align:start position:0%
that I'm aware of um I can't speak to
 
05:35:18.708 --> 05:35:18.718 align:start position:0%
tobacco and I don't know the black
 
05:35:21.110 --> 05:35:21.120 align:start position:0%
market statistics I I can't imagine that
 
05:35:23.030 --> 05:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
I don't have any statistics Al that
 
05:35:25.390 --> 05:35:25.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist well all I know is that
 
05:35:28.830 --> 05:35:28.840 align:start position:0%
the black market now is it's cheaper to
 
05:35:31.548 --> 05:35:31.558 align:start position:0%
grow when States put on their voluntary
 
05:35:33.590 --> 05:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
tax their taxes whatever you want to say
 
05:35:35.548 --> 05:35:35.558 align:start position:0%
whatever however you want to call it
 
05:35:38.110 --> 05:35:38.120 align:start position:0%
quite frankly I mean the black market
 
05:35:40.310 --> 05:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
just goes down I mean the reason that
 
05:35:42.470 --> 05:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
the or black market just lowers their
 
05:35:44.110 --> 05:35:44.120 align:start position:0%
price the reason that the Black Market
 
05:35:47.190 --> 05:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
has eclipsed California legal Market is
 
05:35:48.430 --> 05:35:48.440 align:start position:0%
because they're in a game of cat and
 
05:35:50.628 --> 05:35:50.638 align:start position:0%
mouse with their tax rate and the I
 
05:35:52.150 --> 05:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
think in the last legislative session
 
05:35:53.470 --> 05:35:53.480 align:start position:0%
they were actually trying to lower their
 
05:35:56.350 --> 05:35:56.360 align:start position:0%
tax rate of what they were gaining in
 
05:35:58.150 --> 05:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
off of the top of marijuana products
 
05:35:59.310 --> 05:35:59.320 align:start position:0%
because they were trying to compete with
 
05:36:01.990 --> 05:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
the black market so I don't I don't have
 
05:36:03.350 --> 05:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
an answer to your question of why we
 
05:36:05.670 --> 05:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
don't see that I don't know Perhaps
 
05:36:07.990 --> 05:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
Perhaps when prohibition was over and
 
05:36:09.350 --> 05:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
you know there was a black market for
 
05:36:12.070 --> 05:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
the alcohol industry I don't know all I
 
05:36:14.590 --> 05:36:14.600 align:start position:0%
know is that that we have had over 10
 
05:36:18.670 --> 05:36:18.680 align:start position:0%
years of data now in legalized States
 
05:36:21.270 --> 05:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't get prettier and it
 
05:36:23.310 --> 05:36:23.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't reduce the black market that's
 
05:36:26.590 --> 05:36:26.600 align:start position:0%
all I know thank you representative
 
05:36:29.948 --> 05:36:29.958 align:start position:0%
taxton have I have a question and
 
05:36:31.628 --> 05:36:31.638 align:start position:0%
actually have two which leads to two
 
05:36:34.708 --> 05:36:34.718 align:start position:0%
follow-ups it I understand from your
 
05:36:38.190 --> 05:36:38.200 align:start position:0%
testimony that we are that Oklahoma and
 
05:36:40.868 --> 05:36:40.878 align:start position:0%
Maine are net exporters of marijuana and
 
05:36:43.788 --> 05:36:43.798 align:start position:0%
are they exporting to New Hampshire no
 
05:36:45.910 --> 05:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying is there's Oklahoma
 
05:36:49.190 --> 05:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
instituted grow policies for medical
 
05:36:53.708 --> 05:36:53.718 align:start position:0%
marijuana uh they instituted LAX laws
 
05:36:55.230 --> 05:36:55.240 align:start position:0%
the immediate thing that happened was
 
05:36:58.270 --> 05:36:58.280 align:start position:0%
the green rush in Oklahoma where actual
 
05:37:01.830 --> 05:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
um legal farmers who applied to these to
 
05:37:04.190 --> 05:37:04.200 align:start position:0%
have some of these licenses came in but
 
05:37:05.948 --> 05:37:05.958 align:start position:0%
also one of the things that flooded the
 
05:37:09.390 --> 05:37:09.400 align:start position:0%
market is cartels there's uh Eastern
 
05:37:12.430 --> 05:37:12.440 align:start position:0%
European Chinese and Mexican cartels
 
05:37:14.670 --> 05:37:14.680 align:start position:0%
actually that came into Oklahoma and
 
05:37:18.708 --> 05:37:18.718 align:start position:0%
they are they're have Farms that they're
 
05:37:20.470 --> 05:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
running they did they they're not legal
 
05:37:22.390 --> 05:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
Farms they're unlicensed Farms they're
 
05:37:25.310 --> 05:37:25.320 align:start position:0%
flooding the black market so Oklahoma is
 
05:37:28.750 --> 05:37:28.760 align:start position:0%
not supplying the the product here
 
05:37:30.750 --> 05:37:30.760 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma's laws were for growing it in
 
05:37:33.990 --> 05:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
their own state but but somehow just
 
05:37:36.788 --> 05:37:36.798 align:start position:0%
like Maine is seeing somehow their rural
 
05:37:39.430 --> 05:37:39.440 align:start position:0%
landscape made them prime target for
 
05:37:41.910 --> 05:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
under thewire illegal markets so
 
05:37:44.948 --> 05:37:44.958 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma is supplying is one of the the
 
05:37:47.390 --> 05:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
Black Market Oklahoma is supplying the
 
05:37:51.310 --> 05:37:51.320 align:start position:0%
majority of U pot in the US right now so
 
05:37:53.030 --> 05:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
they are exporting to New Hampshire
 
05:37:55.310 --> 05:37:55.320 align:start position:0%
further well the illegal the illegal
 
05:37:57.948 --> 05:37:57.958 align:start position:0%
Market is she's entitled to her opinion
 
05:37:59.788 --> 05:37:59.798 align:start position:0%
no I'm just no it's not it's it's not
 
05:38:04.548 --> 05:38:04.558 align:start position:0%
opinion I I mean that's fine I mean okay
 
05:38:06.830 --> 05:38:06.840 align:start position:0%
then you could then I believe me if you
 
05:38:08.230 --> 05:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
don't want to believe me then by all
 
05:38:10.190 --> 05:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
means refer to the information that the
 
05:38:12.270 --> 05:38:12.280 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma attorney general puts out right
 
05:38:15.230 --> 05:38:15.240 align:start position:0%
okay okay that exactly just I think I'm
 
05:38:17.548 --> 05:38:17.558 align:start position:0%
good just representative
 
05:38:20.708 --> 05:38:20.718 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you and thank you for taking
 
05:38:23.430 --> 05:38:23.440 align:start position:0%
my question uh and I'm afraid this is
 
05:38:27.230 --> 05:38:27.240 align:start position:0%
another would you believe uh in regard
 
05:38:31.750 --> 05:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
to Black Market uh um in marijuana in
 
05:38:35.150 --> 05:38:35.160 align:start position:0%
marijuana legalization States and that
 
05:38:38.150 --> 05:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
is that there are states and New York
 
05:38:40.270 --> 05:38:40.280 align:start position:0%
state is the example that I'm really
 
05:38:43.468 --> 05:38:43.478 align:start position:0%
familiar with where marijuana was
 
05:38:47.030 --> 05:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
theoretically legalized but the process
 
05:38:50.510 --> 05:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
for obtaining a license to sell legal
 
05:38:53.390 --> 05:38:53.400 align:start position:0%
marijuana was made so incredibly
 
05:38:56.548 --> 05:38:56.558 align:start position:0%
complicated and bureaucratic that it
 
05:38:59.150 --> 05:38:59.160 align:start position:0%
became essentially impossible to get
 
05:39:02.150 --> 05:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
that license and as a result there are
 
05:39:04.868 --> 05:39:04.878 align:start position:0%
practically no uh there have been
 
05:39:07.628 --> 05:39:07.638 align:start position:0%
practically no uh legal Manana of
 
05:39:10.270 --> 05:39:10.280 align:start position:0%
dealers and the Black Market has
 
05:39:13.150 --> 05:39:13.160 align:start position:0%
thrived well I I would just say back
 
05:39:16.628 --> 05:39:16.638 align:start position:0%
it's no surprise to me that the the
 
05:39:18.350 --> 05:39:18.360 align:start position:0%
government of New York found another way
 
05:39:20.510 --> 05:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
to screw something else
 
05:39:28.150 --> 05:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:30.910 --> 05:39:30.920 align:start position:0%
sorry well
 
05:39:33.430 --> 05:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
representative MCU you have a question
 
05:39:34.788 --> 05:39:34.798 align:start position:0%
thank Mr chairman thanks for bringing
 
05:39:39.350 --> 05:39:39.360 align:start position:0%
this information um I I did forgive me
 
05:39:42.150 --> 05:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
that because I did miss 639 I joined the
 
05:39:45.390 --> 05:39:45.400 align:start position:0%
committee here Midway through uh so I'm
 
05:39:47.190 --> 05:39:47.200 align:start position:0%
learning a few things watching some old
 
05:39:50.030 --> 05:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
hearings and and whatnot
 
05:39:52.390 --> 05:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
um but I have a bit of a background in
 
05:39:53.628 --> 05:39:53.638 align:start position:0%
some of this so I'm so I'm pretty
 
05:39:57.110 --> 05:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
familiar um my question for you is you
 
05:40:00.110 --> 05:40:00.120 align:start position:0%
may know oh your microphone's you you
 
05:40:03.350 --> 05:40:03.360 align:start position:0%
may know of and it wasn't the chairman

you may know of yeah you you may know of
 
05:40:08.750 --> 05:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
some peer-reviewed published data
 
05:40:10.390 --> 05:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
published in highle journals that can
 
05:40:12.830 --> 05:40:12.840 align:start position:0%
talk to us about the other costs
 
05:40:15.270 --> 05:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
associated with imp implementing
 
05:40:17.590 --> 05:40:17.600 align:start position:0%
widespread recreational marijuana use
 
05:40:19.030 --> 05:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
from other States since there's 10 years
 
05:40:22.110 --> 05:40:22.120 align:start position:0%
of data now can you educate us a little
 
05:40:24.948 --> 05:40:24.958 align:start position:0%
bit or maybe sorry if it's just me I
 
05:40:27.190 --> 05:40:27.200 align:start position:0%
hope it's not just me can you educate us
 
05:40:28.830 --> 05:40:28.840 align:start position:0%
on what are some of the other costs that
 
05:40:31.230 --> 05:40:31.240 align:start position:0%
offset the tax earnings I would be happy
 
05:40:32.948 --> 05:40:32.958 align:start position:0%
to share with you some of the data that
 
05:40:35.310 --> 05:40:35.320 align:start position:0%
I presented uh last year I believe it
 
05:40:36.350 --> 05:40:36.360 align:start position:0%
was in this committee or it might have
 
05:40:39.070 --> 05:40:39.080 align:start position:0%
been the year before um it it talked
 
05:40:41.468 --> 05:40:41.478 align:start position:0%
about actually Canada's state run model
 
05:40:44.310 --> 05:40:44.320 align:start position:0%
and what happened with them uh as far as
 
05:40:46.670 --> 05:40:46.680 align:start position:0%
the US for the US I'll see if I can find
 
05:40:48.070 --> 05:40:48.080 align:start position:0%
some but I'll I'll send you the
 
05:40:50.350 --> 05:40:50.360 align:start position:0%
information that I have but but maybe
 
05:40:51.990 --> 05:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
you could maybe when I email you you can
 
05:40:53.270 --> 05:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
be a little more specific about where
 
05:40:54.270 --> 05:40:54.280 align:start position:0%
you're looking
 
05:40:57.590 --> 05:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
for would that be all right okay that'd
 
05:40:59.830 --> 05:40:59.840 align:start position:0%

ACLU

05:41:41.430 --> 05:41:41.440 align:start position:0%

good afternoon chairman hun other
 
05:41:45.070 --> 05:41:45.080 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the committee uh
 
05:41:47.030 --> 05:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Devon chaffy
 
05:41:49.190 --> 05:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
and I'm the executive director of the
 
05:41:51.750 --> 05:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
ACLU of New Hampshire um and it will not
 
05:41:53.310 --> 05:41:53.320 align:start position:0%
surprise you that I'm here today to
 
05:41:57.628 --> 05:41:57.638 align:start position:0%
testify in favor of HB 13 I mean
 
05:42:00.830 --> 05:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
1633 um and I have to say I give a lot
 
05:42:03.468 --> 05:42:03.478 align:start position:0%
of thought about how I should focus my
 
05:42:06.670 --> 05:42:06.680 align:start position:0%
remarks today um you know I I thought at
 
05:42:09.910 --> 05:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
first I could focus on
 
05:42:12.150 --> 05:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
uh well first of all I've been working
 
05:42:14.510 --> 05:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
on U marijuana legalization at the state
 
05:42:16.948 --> 05:42:16.958 align:start position:0%
house for over a decade now as many of
 
05:42:19.708 --> 05:42:19.718 align:start position:0%
you have been um and someone from our
 
05:42:21.670 --> 05:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
organization has no doubt been here
 
05:42:23.868 --> 05:42:23.878 align:start position:0%
before you to testify I'm sure on this
 
05:42:26.788 --> 05:42:26.798 align:start position:0%
very issue many many times and so I
 
05:42:29.190 --> 05:42:29.200 align:start position:0%
thought you know I could focus on the
 
05:42:31.510 --> 05:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
question of why why do we need to
 
05:42:33.708 --> 05:42:33.718 align:start position:0%
legalize and I could talk about how
 
05:42:36.190 --> 05:42:36.200 align:start position:0%
marijuana arrests and convictions
 
05:42:39.110 --> 05:42:39.120 align:start position:0%
needlessly ruin lives how the war on
 
05:42:41.948 --> 05:42:41.958 align:start position:0%
marijuana is a Monumental waste of
 
05:42:44.548 --> 05:42:44.558 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars or how the public
 
05:42:46.390 --> 05:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
support in New Hampshire for
 
05:42:48.590 --> 05:42:48.600 align:start position:0%
legalization is just
 
05:42:50.868 --> 05:42:50.878 align:start position:0%
overwhelming um but I think you all know
 
05:42:52.788 --> 05:42:52.798 align:start position:0%
that you've heard our testimony before
 
05:42:54.468 --> 05:42:54.478 align:start position:0%
it'll be in my written testimony that
 
05:42:57.110 --> 05:42:57.120 align:start position:0%
I'll distribute um I'm also happy to
 
05:42:59.788 --> 05:42:59.798 align:start position:0%
provide you with some additional data
 
05:43:01.590 --> 05:43:01.600 align:start position:0%
many studies that show that traffic
 
05:43:03.830 --> 05:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
fatalities do not in fact go up in
 
05:43:05.830 --> 05:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
states that have legalized the fact that
 
05:43:08.430 --> 05:43:08.440 align:start position:0%
youth use does not in fact go up in
 
05:43:10.468 --> 05:43:10.478 align:start position:0%
states that have legalized Etc I'll
 
05:43:11.948 --> 05:43:11.958 align:start position:0%
distribute that to the committee in a
 
05:43:14.910 --> 05:43:14.920 align:start position:0%
form of an FAQ um or I could get into
 
05:43:17.350 --> 05:43:17.360 align:start position:0%
the details of this particular Bill the
 
05:43:18.990 --> 05:43:19.000 align:start position:0%
good and the bad the strengths and the
 
05:43:21.868 --> 05:43:21.878 align:start position:0%
weaknesses or other alternative
 
05:43:24.150 --> 05:43:24.160 align:start position:0%
approaches um but what I really want to
 
05:43:26.270 --> 05:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
focus on today and I have to say I do
 
05:43:28.230 --> 05:43:28.240 align:start position:0%
not know that I have ever before so
 
05:43:30.830 --> 05:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
emphatically agreed with the chair of
 
05:43:33.150 --> 05:43:33.160 align:start position:0%
this committee but what I want to say
 
05:43:36.150 --> 05:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
today is that we have a very narrow
 
05:43:39.510 --> 05:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
window this year to actually make
 
05:43:39.520 --> 05:43:41.350 align:start position:0%
window this year to actually make
legalization

05:43:41.350 --> 05:43:41.360 align:start position:0%
legalization
 
05:43:44.230 --> 05:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
happen for the first time in a decade
 
05:43:46.030 --> 05:43:46.040 align:start position:0%
the entire time I have been in New
 
05:43:48.868 --> 05:43:48.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we finally have a governor
 
05:43:52.548 --> 05:43:52.558 align:start position:0%
that has said publicly that he will sign
 
05:43:52.558 --> 05:43:53.830 align:start position:0%
that has said publicly that he will sign
marijuana

05:43:53.830 --> 05:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
marijuana
 
05:43:57.708 --> 05:43:57.718 align:start position:0%
legalization into law we have bipartisan
 
05:44:01.150 --> 05:44:01.160 align:start position:0%
support and both both the house and the
 
05:44:05.990 --> 05:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
Senate we can actually see a real path
 
05:44:06.000 --> 05:44:07.110 align:start position:0%
Senate we can actually see a real path
to

05:44:07.110 --> 05:44:07.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:44:09.310 --> 05:44:09.320 align:start position:0%
legalization this is a golden
 
05:44:12.430 --> 05:44:12.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity right now and it is fleeting
 
05:44:14.468 --> 05:44:14.478 align:start position:0%
we do not know what will happen when the
 
05:44:17.230 --> 05:44:17.240 align:start position:0%
next Governor is
 
05:44:20.468 --> 05:44:20.478 align:start position:0%
elected we need to come together this
 
05:44:22.670 --> 05:44:22.680 align:start position:0%
year to get this
 
05:44:26.310 --> 05:44:26.320 align:start position:0%
done so many members of this house so
 
05:44:29.350 --> 05:44:29.360 align:start position:0%
many of you members that un fortunately
 
05:44:31.990 --> 05:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
are no longer with us have spent hours
 
05:44:34.708 --> 05:44:34.718 align:start position:0%
and hours trying to get this right over
 
05:44:38.310 --> 05:44:38.320 align:start position:0%
the years we owe it to you we owe it to
 
05:44:42.350 --> 05:44:42.360 align:start position:0%
them we owe it to that work not to miss
 
05:44:42.360 --> 05:44:43.628 align:start position:0%
them we owe it to that work not to miss
this

05:44:43.628 --> 05:44:43.638 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:44:46.150 --> 05:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity it's not going to be easy I
 
05:44:47.948 --> 05:44:47.958 align:start position:0%
know that you all know that you know how
 
05:44:50.590 --> 05:44:50.600 align:start position:0%
hard it is to make the sausage you're
 
05:44:52.430 --> 05:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
involved in this every
 
05:44:54.510 --> 05:44:54.520 align:start position:0%
day there's going to have to be
 
05:44:57.910 --> 05:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
compromises from all sides I can tell
 
05:44:59.990 --> 05:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
you that we at the AC Ste you we're not
 
05:45:01.708 --> 05:45:01.718 align:start position:0%
going to get everything that we want
 
05:45:04.190 --> 05:45:04.200 align:start position:0%
from this bill I know that going
 
05:45:07.468 --> 05:45:07.478 align:start position:0%
in the industry is not going to get
 
05:45:10.750 --> 05:45:10.760 align:start position:0%
everything that it wants neither party
 
05:45:13.670 --> 05:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
is going to be fully happy with the
 
05:45:16.708 --> 05:45:16.718 align:start position:0%
result the end product is not going to
 
05:45:18.868 --> 05:45:18.878 align:start position:0%
be the perfect Bill there will have to
 
05:45:21.350 --> 05:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
be cleanup that happens in subsequent
 
05:45:24.510 --> 05:45:24.520 align:start position:0%
years but we have to get it
 
05:45:28.390 --> 05:45:28.400 align:start position:0%
done it's beyond time every year that
 
05:45:30.430 --> 05:45:30.440 align:start position:0%
passes is Revenue that New Hampshire has
 
05:45:33.310 --> 05:45:33.320 align:start position:0%
just gifted to Massachusetts and to
 
05:45:36.670 --> 05:45:36.680 align:start position:0%
Maine its taxpayer was money wasted on
 
05:45:41.150 --> 05:45:41.160 align:start position:0%
unjust enforcement its lives ruined it's
 
05:45:44.310 --> 05:45:44.320 align:start position:0%
needless it's time to be practical it's
 
05:45:47.230 --> 05:45:47.240 align:start position:0%
time to put partisan politics aside and
 
05:45:50.150 --> 05:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
it is time to come together and to
 
05:45:53.628 --> 05:45:53.638 align:start position:0%
compromise and to really get this done
 
05:45:56.030 --> 05:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
and I personally myself very much
 
05:45:58.868 --> 05:45:58.878 align:start position:0%
looking look forward to working with any
 
05:46:01.868 --> 05:46:01.878 align:start position:0%
and all of you over the coming months to
 
05:46:04.468 --> 05:46:04.478 align:start position:0%
get marijuana legalization past the
 
05:46:07.430 --> 05:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
Finish Line this year thank you so much
 
05:46:09.468 --> 05:46:09.478 align:start position:0%
for your work on this issue and thank
 
05:46:12.548 --> 05:46:12.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:15.310 --> 05:46:15.320 align:start position:0%
time uh thank you and it's so nice to
 
05:46:20.670 --> 05:46:20.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:24.110 --> 05:46:24.120 align:start position:0%
me thank you very much thank you
 
05:46:28.150 --> 05:46:28.160 align:start position:0%
chairman oh we do have oh we do okay I
 
05:46:30.110 --> 05:46:30.120 align:start position:0%
didn't think
 
05:46:32.350 --> 05:46:32.360 align:start position:0%
first thank you for testifying to our
 
05:46:34.948 --> 05:46:34.958 align:start position:0%
committee um I just have a question
 
05:46:38.590 --> 05:46:38.600 align:start position:0%
since we have you here about uh the the
 
05:46:41.830 --> 05:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
use of marijuana in in in the state
 
05:46:45.310 --> 05:46:45.320 align:start position:0%
prisons uh if you have any data or or
 
05:46:46.708 --> 05:46:46.718 align:start position:0%
use on that and the reason I ask is
 
05:46:49.510 --> 05:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
because that is that is a population
 
05:46:52.868 --> 05:46:52.878 align:start position:0%
that is completely controlled uh and
 
05:46:55.868 --> 05:46:55.878 align:start position:0%
locked down and uh if it's difficult to
 
05:46:58.030 --> 05:46:58.040 align:start position:0%
keep drugs out of that environment then
 
05:47:00.468 --> 05:47:00.478 align:start position:0%
in a free soci it's that much more
 
05:47:01.830 --> 05:47:01.840 align:start position:0%
difficult to prevent people from using
 
05:47:03.310 --> 05:47:03.320 align:start position:0%
it so I thought I'd ask you that
 
05:47:04.628 --> 05:47:04.638 align:start position:0%
question and if you have any data on
 
05:47:07.110 --> 05:47:07.120 align:start position:0%
that uh thank you representative I I
 
05:47:08.948 --> 05:47:08.958 align:start position:0%
don't have any data on that specifically
 
05:47:10.628 --> 05:47:10.638 align:start position:0%
I can certainly see in this state and
 
05:47:12.310 --> 05:47:12.320 align:start position:0%
and I'll see if I can get any data on
 
05:47:15.310 --> 05:47:15.320 align:start position:0%
that thank you okay representating M
 
05:47:16.948 --> 05:47:16.958 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thanks for taking
 
05:47:19.190 --> 05:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
my question what other drugs does the
 
05:47:21.708 --> 05:47:21.718 align:start position:0%
ACLU support full legalization or
 
05:47:23.310 --> 05:47:23.320 align:start position:0%
decriminalization or recreational use
 
05:47:27.230 --> 05:47:27.240 align:start position:0%
for um list them yeah no there is no
 
05:47:31.030 --> 05:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
other drug for which we are supporting
 
05:47:33.948 --> 05:47:33.958 align:start position:0%
currently supporting full
 
05:47:37.030 --> 05:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
legalization representative thank you
 
05:47:37.040 --> 05:47:38.390 align:start position:0%
legalization representative thank you

you okay I mean there is no other
 
05:47:43.430 --> 05:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
currently criminalized dropcast thank
 
05:47:48.070 --> 05:47:48.080 align:start position:0%
you uh Bob Dunn from the Roman Catholic
 
05:47:52.150 --> 05:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:54.150 --> 05:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
Manchester I was just thinking this
 
05:47:55.750 --> 05:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
morning when I walked up and I saw you
 
05:47:56.948 --> 05:47:56.958 align:start position:0%
sitting on the second floor that I
 
05:48:02.310 --> 05:48:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:04.948 --> 05:48:04.958 align:start position:0%
well we'll see if you're happy to see me
 
05:48:07.990 --> 05:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
I I of course I know what your your
 
05:48:09.830 --> 05:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
answer to this question is it's not
 
05:48:12.750 --> 05:48:12.760 align:start position:0%
going to change from last year correct
 
05:48:15.150 --> 05:48:15.160 align:start position:0%
right uh thank you Mr chairman and it is
 
05:48:18.030 --> 05:48:18.040 align:start position:0%
good to be back um I don't get in front
 
05:48:20.030 --> 05:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
of the Commerce Committee all that often
 
05:48:22.628 --> 05:48:22.638 align:start position:0%
so I appreciate the opportunity to be
 
05:48:25.070 --> 05:48:25.080 align:start position:0%
here uh I'm Bob Dunn the director of
 
05:48:27.430 --> 05:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
public policy for the Roman Catholic
 
05:48:29.948 --> 05:48:29.958 align:start position:0%
dasis of Manchester and I'm here today
 
05:48:32.150 --> 05:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
on behalf of Bishop Peter labashi to
 
05:48:35.868 --> 05:48:35.878 align:start position:0%
once again register our opposition to
 
05:48:38.110 --> 05:48:38.120 align:start position:0%
the legalization of marijuana so we're
 
05:48:40.990 --> 05:48:41.000 align:start position:0%
opposed to House Bill 1633 but we're
 
05:48:43.350 --> 05:48:43.360 align:start position:0%
opposed to all of the legalization bills
 
05:48:46.510 --> 05:48:46.520 align:start position:0%
so there's nothing unique about
 
05:48:50.390 --> 05:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
1633 um and our reason for doing that as
 
05:48:52.708 --> 05:48:52.718 align:start position:0%
always is because we think it runs
 
05:48:54.750 --> 05:48:54.760 align:start position:0%
counter to the principle of the common
 
05:48:57.990 --> 05:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
good and you've already heard reference
 
05:48:59.310 --> 05:48:59.320 align:start position:0%
and I'd want CE again draw your
 
05:49:01.670 --> 05:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
attention to the information that's in
 
05:49:04.708 --> 05:49:04.718 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note or the the responses to
 
05:49:06.990 --> 05:49:07.000 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note from the Department of
 
05:49:08.670 --> 05:49:08.680 align:start position:0%
Safety and from the Department of Health
 
05:49:09.830 --> 05:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
and Human
 
05:49:13.788 --> 05:49:13.798 align:start position:0%
Services um and the the what the
 
05:49:15.868 --> 05:49:15.878 align:start position:0%
assumptions are that they're making
 
05:49:19.270 --> 05:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
about what the impact would be on life
 
05:49:22.310 --> 05:49:22.320 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire if we were to uh take
 
05:49:26.670 --> 05:49:26.680 align:start position:0%
this next step so I'll uh simply ask uh
 
05:49:28.670 --> 05:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
because I know you have a lot of people
 
05:49:31.708 --> 05:49:31.718 align:start position:0%
to speak today um to think about four
 
05:49:35.670 --> 05:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
questions um we posed these last year
 
05:49:37.830 --> 05:49:37.840 align:start position:0%
will the passage of this law protect
 
05:49:41.270 --> 05:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
Youth and improve family life will the
 
05:49:44.230 --> 05:49:44.240 align:start position:0%
passage of the law improve public health
 
05:49:47.230 --> 05:49:47.240 align:start position:0%
will the passage of the law improve our
 
05:49:49.468 --> 05:49:49.478 align:start position:0%
communities and will the passage of this
 
05:49:52.590 --> 05:49:52.600 align:start position:0%
law make people better workers and
 
05:49:54.670 --> 05:49:54.680 align:start position:0%
strengthen our business
 
05:49:57.830 --> 05:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
Workforce so we just ask you to keep
 
05:50:00.670 --> 05:50:00.680 align:start position:0%
those in mind as you deliberate over
 
05:50:03.548 --> 05:50:03.558 align:start position:0%
this legislation and any other similar
 
05:50:05.910 --> 05:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
types of bills that may come forward
 
05:50:05.920 --> 05:50:09.990 align:start position:0%
types of bills that may come forward
thank

05:50:09.990 --> 05:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:10.000 --> 05:50:13.350 align:start position:0%

05:50:13.350 --> 05:50:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:17.070 --> 05:50:17.080 align:start position:0%
Bob okay Switching over the other side
 
05:50:23.150 --> 05:50:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:33.468 --> 05:50:33.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:33.478 --> 05:50:35.110 align:start position:0%

05:50:47.230 --> 05:50:47.240 align:start position:0%
in the chemistry and pharmacology of

cannabis I also hold a USDA hemp license
 
05:50:53.190 --> 05:50:53.200 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire today I'm speaking
 
05:50:56.590 --> 05:50:56.600 align:start position:0%
in support of HB 1633 as I was also in
 
05:51:00.430 --> 05:51:00.440 align:start position:0%
support of HB 639 proposed last year I
 
05:51:02.030 --> 05:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
believe this bill will provide cannabis
 
05:51:04.110 --> 05:51:04.120 align:start position:0%
consumers in New Hampshire access to
 
05:51:06.230 --> 05:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
Safe affordable and accessible cannabis
 
05:51:08.430 --> 05:51:08.440 align:start position:0%
products with lower tax rates compared
 
05:51:09.750 --> 05:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
to neighboring states and the rest of
 
05:51:12.030 --> 05:51:12.040 align:start position:0%
the legal Market this bill encourages
 
05:51:13.670 --> 05:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
the support and erection of small
 
05:51:15.628 --> 05:51:15.638 align:start position:0%
businesses which is a core value here in
 
05:51:17.868 --> 05:51:17.878 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and should be maintained
 
05:51:22.190 --> 05:51:22.200 align:start position:0%
in this emerging industry hb6 1633 will
 
05:51:24.190 --> 05:51:24.200 align:start position:0%
allow medical patients the right to
 
05:51:26.548 --> 05:51:26.558 align:start position:0%
homeg grow their medicine it will allow
 
05:51:28.430 --> 05:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
additional funding for education and
 
05:51:30.990 --> 05:51:31.000 align:start position:0%
cannabis and Beyond lower property taxes
 
05:51:32.948 --> 05:51:32.958 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire residents encourages
 
05:51:35.468 --> 05:51:35.478 align:start position:0%
and supports New Hampshire farmers and
 
05:51:37.390 --> 05:51:37.400 align:start position:0%
probably most importantly prevents the
 
05:51:39.030 --> 05:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
ongoing discrimination of people who
 
05:51:41.750 --> 05:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
choose to use natural products this bill
 
05:51:43.548 --> 05:51:43.558 align:start position:0%
emphasizes the importance of continued
 
05:51:44.590 --> 05:51:44.600 align:start position:0%
research and
 
05:51:46.910 --> 05:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
education and as a research scientist
 
05:51:48.830 --> 05:51:48.840 align:start position:0%
this is very important to me and our
 
05:51:51.030 --> 05:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
community this includes education
 
05:51:53.150 --> 05:51:53.160 align:start position:0%
materials and resources within the
 
05:51:55.750 --> 05:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
dispensary available on social media and
 
05:51:58.270 --> 05:51:58.280 align:start position:0%
through other traditional media Outlets
 
05:52:00.270 --> 05:52:00.280 align:start position:0%
education is the best form of harm
 
05:52:02.310 --> 05:52:02.320 align:start position:0%
reduction and that is emphasized in this
 
05:52:04.990 --> 05:52:05.000 align:start position:0%
proposed bill this bill has funds
 
05:52:06.750 --> 05:52:06.760 align:start position:0%
allocated to Grants dedicated to the
 
05:52:08.270 --> 05:52:08.280 align:start position:0%
research and development of cannabis
 
05:52:09.788 --> 05:52:09.798 align:start position:0%
cannabis technology and cannabis
 
05:52:12.150 --> 05:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
consumers to allow New Hampshire to be a
 
05:52:14.030 --> 05:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
leading state in the field and be an
 
05:52:17.070 --> 05:52:17.080 align:start position:0%
example for other states further funds
 
05:52:18.708 --> 05:52:18.718 align:start position:0%
are to be allocated towards substance
 
05:52:21.070 --> 05:52:21.080 align:start position:0%
use prevention and Recovery funds and
 
05:52:23.510 --> 05:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
roadside testing via law
 
05:52:25.750 --> 05:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement this bill also emphasizes
 
05:52:27.708 --> 05:52:27.718 align:start position:0%
the importance of local politics
 
05:52:29.868 --> 05:52:29.878 align:start position:0%
allowing each municipality to have final
 
05:52:32.150 --> 05:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
say whether they participate and to what
 
05:52:34.390 --> 05:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
degree this bill emphasizes the
 
05:52:36.990 --> 05:52:37.000 align:start position:0%
effective tools used by other states to
 
05:52:40.110 --> 05:52:40.120 align:start position:0%
Halt access of underage users including
 
05:52:42.548 --> 05:52:42.558 align:start position:0%
stores being 1,000 ft from schools
 
05:52:44.548 --> 05:52:44.558 align:start position:0%
childsafe packaging that even I have
 
05:52:47.110 --> 05:52:47.120 align:start position:0%
trouble getting into sometimes and no
 
05:52:48.868 --> 05:52:48.878 align:start position:0%
marketing towards children via the use
 
05:52:51.390 --> 05:52:51.400 align:start position:0%
of cartoons or animals on packaging
 
05:52:53.788 --> 05:52:53.798 align:start position:0%
materials there's no potency limit
 
05:52:56.310 --> 05:52:56.320 align:start position:0%
proposed in this bill because of the
 
05:52:58.230 --> 05:52:58.240 align:start position:0%
typically arbitrary numbers that are
 
05:53:01.230 --> 05:53:01.240 align:start position:0%
associated in bills like this about THC
 
05:53:03.510 --> 05:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
percentage and potency and potency is
 
05:53:06.868 --> 05:53:06.878 align:start position:0%
often a proxy for Purity in many cases a
 
05:53:09.110 --> 05:53:09.120 align:start position:0%
reminder that the FDA approved drug
 
05:53:12.990 --> 05:53:13.000 align:start position:0%
called Marinol which is pure THC is 100%
 
05:53:16.230 --> 05:53:16.240 align:start position:0%
THC and it's a pure drug and it's it's
 
05:53:18.430 --> 05:53:18.440 align:start position:0%
shown High efficacy and safety for
 
05:53:21.310 --> 05:53:21.320 align:start position:0%
patients that need it further this bill
 
05:53:22.708 --> 05:53:22.718 align:start position:0%
will allow for residents of New
 
05:53:24.350 --> 05:53:24.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and visitors of New Hampshire
 
05:53:26.948 --> 05:53:26.958 align:start position:0%
to have safe access to cannabis to limit
 
05:53:28.750 --> 05:53:28.760 align:start position:0%
the currently astronom ically High
 
05:53:30.350 --> 05:53:30.360 align:start position:0%
number of drivers heading to Maine
 
05:53:32.670 --> 05:53:32.680 align:start position:0%
Vermont and Massachusetts to purchase
 
05:53:35.030 --> 05:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
cannabis via legal Avenues I don't know
 
05:53:37.390 --> 05:53:37.400 align:start position:0%
if anybody's been to St Johnsbury bethl
 
05:53:39.430 --> 05:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
or any sort of neighboring town in
 
05:53:41.708 --> 05:53:41.718 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts but the parking lots are
 
05:53:43.788 --> 05:53:43.798 align:start position:0%
full of New Hampshire plates mine
 
05:53:43.798 --> 05:53:45.310 align:start position:0%
full of New Hampshire plates mine
included

05:53:45.310 --> 05:53:45.320 align:start position:0%
included
 
05:53:47.270 --> 05:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
sometimes this will also limit the
 
05:53:49.270 --> 05:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
impact of the illicit Market to again
 
05:53:51.830 --> 05:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
ensure safe access to cannabis and
 
05:53:53.910 --> 05:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
tested products our current
 
05:53:55.670 --> 05:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
infrastructure is not stopping people
 
05:53:57.510 --> 05:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
from using cannabis it is limiting the
 
05:53:59.948 --> 05:53:59.958 align:start position:0%
access to Safe
 
05:54:02.310 --> 05:54:02.320 align:start position:0%
products it is time for us to legalize
 
05:54:03.910 --> 05:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
cannabis in New Hampshire and this bill
 
05:54:06.150 --> 05:54:06.160 align:start position:0%
is the best proposed option to date to
 
05:54:08.868 --> 05:54:08.878 align:start position:0%
support Farmers industry professionals
 
05:54:11.628 --> 05:54:11.638 align:start position:0%
medical patients adult use consumers and
 
05:54:13.830 --> 05:54:13.840 align:start position:0%
residents of New Hampshire I have
 
05:54:15.150 --> 05:54:15.160 align:start position:0%
personally seen my friends and
 
05:54:17.030 --> 05:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
colleagues in the Cannabis industry
 
05:54:19.190 --> 05:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
apprehensively leave this great state to
 
05:54:21.110 --> 05:54:21.120 align:start position:0%
go work in the surrounding states that
 
05:54:23.310 --> 05:54:23.320 align:start position:0%
supported them their community and their
 
05:54:25.548 --> 05:54:25.558 align:start position:0%
medicine we can't keep encouraging
 
05:54:27.150 --> 05:54:27.160 align:start position:0%
skilled Farmers extractors and
 
05:54:28.910 --> 05:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
manufacturers to choose between their
 
05:54:30.628 --> 05:54:30.638 align:start position:0%
home state that they love and the plant
 
05:54:33.590 --> 05:54:33.600 align:start position:0%
that has saved them I will end this
 
05:54:36.270 --> 05:54:36.280 align:start position:0%
statement um emphasizing the safety of
 
05:54:37.830 --> 05:54:37.840 align:start position:0%
cannabis and cannabis products and
 
05:54:39.670 --> 05:54:39.680 align:start position:0%
reiterating the recent release from the
 
05:54:42.110 --> 05:54:42.120 align:start position:0%
FDA showing that they encourage
 
05:54:44.590 --> 05:54:44.600 align:start position:0%
rescheduling of cannabis to a schedule
 
05:54:47.670 --> 05:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
three drug because of its safety
 
05:54:49.868 --> 05:54:49.878 align:start position:0%
profile almost all pharmaceutical
 
05:54:51.430 --> 05:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
medications have greater side effects
 
05:54:53.350 --> 05:54:53.360 align:start position:0%
than cannabis and most importantly this
 
05:54:55.670 --> 05:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
is a plant a living plant that has the
 
05:54:57.510 --> 05:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
potential to heal a substantial amount
 
05:54:58.750 --> 05:54:58.760 align:start position:0%
of condition
 
05:55:00.628 --> 05:55:00.638 align:start position:0%
a plant with thousands of peer-reviewed
 
05:55:02.190 --> 05:55:02.200 align:start position:0%
Publications unveiling the unique
 
05:55:04.868 --> 05:55:04.878 align:start position:0%
chemistry and pharmacology and a plant
 
05:55:06.990 --> 05:55:07.000 align:start position:0%
whose current legal status is rooted in
 
05:55:09.750 --> 05:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
racism and discrimination as exemplified
 
05:55:11.390 --> 05:55:11.400 align:start position:0%
earlier today with the Mexican and
 
05:55:14.310 --> 05:55:14.320 align:start position:0%
Chinese cartels mentioned I strongly
 
05:55:16.030 --> 05:55:16.040 align:start position:0%
believe that is a right to have access
 
05:55:17.910 --> 05:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
to Nature and natural products and we
 
05:55:19.910 --> 05:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
are doing a disservice to humanity and
 
05:55:21.430 --> 05:55:21.440 align:start position:0%
the residents of New Hampshire by
 
05:55:24.750 --> 05:55:24.760 align:start position:0%
limiting access to this ancient medicine
 
05:55:26.788 --> 05:55:26.798 align:start position:0%
as a scientist and an advocate I believe
 
05:55:28.468 --> 05:55:28.478 align:start position:0%
this bill is the best way our state can
 
05:55:30.230 --> 05:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
move forward to join the majority of the
 
05:55:32.430 --> 05:55:32.440 align:start position:0%
nation and creating a booming and
 
05:55:34.070 --> 05:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
profitable cannabis industry in New
 
05:55:37.708 --> 05:55:37.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I believe 1633 still allows a
 
05:55:40.030 --> 05:55:40.040 align:start position:0%
significant amount of State control but
 
05:55:43.230 --> 05:55:43.240 align:start position:0%
maintains the culture expertise and
 
05:55:46.310 --> 05:55:46.320 align:start position:0%
Trust within the Cannabis industry thank
 
05:55:47.788 --> 05:55:47.798 align:start position:0%
you for listening to my statement and
 
05:55:50.190 --> 05:55:50.200 align:start position:0%
I'll take any and all
 
05:55:53.150 --> 05:55:53.160 align:start position:0%
questions so um I just made a promise
 
05:55:55.990 --> 05:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
that we'll be out of here by 5
 
05:55:59.510 --> 05:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
o'l so let's make sure we're conscious
 
05:55:59.520 --> 05:56:00.788 align:start position:0%
o'l so let's make sure we're conscious
of

05:56:00.788 --> 05:56:00.798 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:56:03.990 --> 05:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
that representative MCU you have a short
 
05:56:06.030 --> 05:56:06.040 align:start position:0%
brief question certainly less than an
 
05:56:08.830 --> 05:56:08.840 align:start position:0%
hour and two minutes of questions no
 
05:56:11.708 --> 05:56:11.718 align:start position:0%
that I got a dozen cards here thank you
 
05:56:13.910 --> 05:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you very much for
 
05:56:15.548 --> 05:56:15.558 align:start position:0%
bringing your expertise and I'm really
 
05:56:19.868 --> 05:56:19.878 align:start position:0%
interested in some of it um are you um a
 
05:56:21.990 --> 05:56:22.000 align:start position:0%
farm a working pharmacist farm D or is
 
05:56:23.750 --> 05:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
PhD in pharmaceutical science totally
 
05:56:26.110 --> 05:56:26.120 align:start position:0%
different no I work on the um drug
 
05:56:28.190 --> 05:56:28.200 align:start position:0%
Discovery side not the pushing drug drug
 
05:56:32.230 --> 05:56:32.240 align:start position:0%
say got it but so you mentioned that
 
05:56:34.750 --> 05:56:34.760 align:start position:0%
you're a a user you said you you you
 
05:56:36.670 --> 05:56:36.680 align:start position:0%
shop at at there yep I'm a daily
 
05:56:38.948 --> 05:56:38.958 align:start position:0%
cannabis user further question daily
 
05:56:42.788 --> 05:56:42.798 align:start position:0%
cannabis user okay um so my my question
 
05:56:44.110 --> 05:56:44.120 align:start position:0%
is since you're really knowledgeable
 
05:56:45.430 --> 05:56:45.440 align:start position:0%
about all the different ways that
 
05:56:47.788 --> 05:56:47.798 align:start position:0%
cannabis can be used for things like
 
05:56:50.830 --> 05:56:50.840 align:start position:0%
anxiety Sleep Disorders you got it pain
 
05:56:54.990 --> 05:56:55.000 align:start position:0%
management Etc question the question is
 
05:56:56.948 --> 05:56:56.958 align:start position:0%
similar drugs that are used for those
 
05:56:59.230 --> 05:56:59.240 align:start position:0%
same indications like say lorazapam
 
05:57:02.788 --> 05:57:02.798 align:start position:0%
Xanax esone Lunesta ambient for Sleep
 
05:57:06.150 --> 05:57:06.160 align:start position:0%
oxycodon trol etc for any the benzos or
 
05:57:08.708 --> 05:57:08.718 align:start position:0%
any of the narcotics for
 
05:57:10.910 --> 05:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
pain why don't we make those available
 
05:57:12.830 --> 05:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
in the same stores because like you
 
05:57:16.150 --> 05:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned Marinol is pure studied
 
05:57:18.590 --> 05:57:18.600 align:start position:0%
regulated you know we know what's in it
 
05:57:19.708 --> 05:57:19.718 align:start position:0%
then you also mentioned there's
 
05:57:21.830 --> 05:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
thousands of varieties and got it we got
 
05:57:24.708 --> 05:57:24.718 align:start position:0%
the question so why not take the Lunas
 
05:57:27.910 --> 05:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
and things Lunesta tramol benzos put
 
05:57:30.590 --> 05:57:30.600 align:start position:0%
them in the same stores same indications
 
05:57:32.190 --> 05:57:32.200 align:start position:0%
I think aot and let the text hand them
 
05:57:34.628 --> 05:57:34.638 align:start position:0%
out I think a lot of this comes down to
 
05:57:36.628 --> 05:57:36.638 align:start position:0%
just a segregation in our beliefs of
 
05:57:38.628 --> 05:57:38.638 align:start position:0%
medicine where a lot of people don't
 
05:57:40.150 --> 05:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
believe or don't want to use
 
05:57:42.110 --> 05:57:42.120 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical type medicine they prefer
 
05:57:44.310 --> 05:57:44.320 align:start position:0%
natural products like the cannabis plant
 
05:57:46.628 --> 05:57:46.638 align:start position:0%
so it is you know segregated in that way
 
05:57:48.270 --> 05:57:48.280 align:start position:0%
and I also wanted to bring up earlier
 
05:57:50.468 --> 05:57:50.478 align:start position:0%
when you mentioned having MDS or what is
 
05:57:53.468 --> 05:57:53.478 align:start position:0%
the requirement of the workers in
 
05:57:56.190 --> 05:57:56.200 align:start position:0%
dispensaries often times as Tim Egan
 
05:57:58.350 --> 05:57:58.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned yes it is required for them to
 
05:58:01.110 --> 05:58:01.120 align:start position:0%
pass some sort of exam or test but
 
05:58:02.430 --> 05:58:02.440 align:start position:0%
additionally we really shouldn't be
 
05:58:04.670 --> 05:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
looking for MDS being part of this
 
05:58:06.070 --> 05:58:06.080 align:start position:0%
because they are not taught about the
 
05:58:08.230 --> 05:58:08.240 align:start position:0%
endocannabinoid system which is how
 
05:58:09.990 --> 05:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
cannabis interacts with your body in
 
05:58:11.708 --> 05:58:11.718 align:start position:0%
medical school rather we should be
 
05:58:13.990 --> 05:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
looking at maybe the farm D's or the PHD

hundreds of cannabis products and they
 
05:58:41.990 --> 05:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
are experts in our industry people don't
 
05:58:44.990 --> 05:58:45.000 align:start position:0%
become Bud tenders unless this medicine
 
05:58:46.830 --> 05:58:46.840 align:start position:0%

I now dedicate my studies and theories

around the growing resources and time we

Hampshire I'd like to direct your focal
 
06:00:27.830 --> 06:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
point to the today to the lack of
 
06:00:29.868 --> 06:00:29.878 align:start position:0%
materials focused on this consumer
 
06:00:32.190 --> 06:00:32.200 align:start position:0%
product of a scheduled substance like
 
06:00:35.030 --> 06:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
marijuana I would hate personally to be
 
06:00:37.110 --> 06:00:37.120 align:start position:0%
advocating and supporting for our local
 
06:00:38.708 --> 06:00:38.718 align:start position:0%
state and federal criminal justice
 
06:00:40.510 --> 06:00:40.520 align:start position:0%
professionals but then virtually
 
06:00:41.910 --> 06:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
equipping them with nothing to prove
 
06:00:44.030 --> 06:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
beyond a shadow of a doubt that someone
 
06:00:46.310 --> 06:00:46.320 align:start position:0%
is guilty of an
 
06:00:49.070 --> 06:00:49.080 align:start position:0%
offense I'm one of the youngest enrolled
 
06:00:50.830 --> 06:00:50.840 align:start position:0%
students at Southern New Hampshire
 
06:00:53.150 --> 06:00:53.160 align:start position:0%
University but I comment I heard from
 
06:00:54.830 --> 06:00:54.840 align:start position:0%
one of my fellow students really
 
06:00:58.628 --> 06:00:58.638 align:start position:0%
frightened me she said I drive so much
 
06:01:02.750 --> 06:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:05.868 --> 06:01:05.878 align:start position:0%
drunk I drive so much better when I am
 
06:01:09.788 --> 06:01:09.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:12.670 --> 06:01:12.680 align:start position:0%
drunk that's still a DUI offense
 
06:01:12.680 --> 06:01:15.830 align:start position:0%
drunk that's still a DUI offense
representative

06:01:15.830 --> 06:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:19.910 --> 06:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:22.430 --> 06:01:22.440 align:start position:0%
offense the perception of this so-called
 
06:01:24.670 --> 06:01:24.680 align:start position:0%
plant is far beyond anyone's control to
 
06:01:26.590 --> 06:01:26.600 align:start position:0%
reshape and fully encapsulate the nature
 
06:01:28.830 --> 06:01:28.840 align:start position:0%
of this drug so that meaning if it's
 
06:01:30.430 --> 06:01:30.440 align:start position:0%
just a little bit of weed you should be
 
06:01:33.430 --> 06:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:35.548 --> 06:01:35.558 align:start position:0%
wheel but what happens if you're pulled
 
06:01:37.708 --> 06:01:37.718 align:start position:0%
over late at night by local municipality
 
06:01:39.868 --> 06:01:39.878 align:start position:0%
for failure to maintain Lane control or
 
06:01:42.708 --> 06:01:42.718 align:start position:0%
exhibiting intoxicated Behavior well the
 
06:01:44.390 --> 06:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
officer May detain you based on the
 
06:01:45.990 --> 06:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
presence of smell of marijuana coming
 
06:01:48.230 --> 06:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
off a vehicle and notice clinical signs
 
06:01:50.230 --> 06:01:50.240 align:start position:0%
such as blurred perception and red staky
 
06:01:52.708 --> 06:01:52.718 align:start position:0%
eyes after speaking with many law
 
06:01:54.510 --> 06:01:54.520 align:start position:0%
professionals this makes the criminal
 
06:01:56.510 --> 06:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
justice system harder because there is
 
06:01:58.948 --> 06:01:58.958 align:start position:0%
no field sobriety test for the drug
 
06:02:00.788 --> 06:02:00.798 align:start position:0%
something so simple as a blood alcohol
 
06:02:03.468 --> 06:02:03.478 align:start position:0%
content used in alcohol intoxication is
 
06:02:05.510 --> 06:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
not available relying on the
 
06:02:07.030 --> 06:02:07.040 align:start position:0%
professional to prove without well-
 
06:02:09.310 --> 06:02:09.320 align:start position:0%
tested and trusted technology that the
 
06:02:11.030 --> 06:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
individual based on law enforcement's
 
06:02:12.590 --> 06:02:12.600 align:start position:0%
perception is under the influence of
 
06:02:14.590 --> 06:02:14.600 align:start position:0%
marijuana and while we have some of the
 
06:02:17.110 --> 06:02:17.120 align:start position:0%
most well-versed caring and qualified
 
06:02:18.628 --> 06:02:18.638 align:start position:0%
men and women of law enforcement on our
 
06:02:20.468 --> 06:02:20.478 align:start position:0%
front lines would that be something we
 
06:02:23.150 --> 06:02:23.160 align:start position:0%
would have to burden them with even more
 
06:02:24.670 --> 06:02:24.680 align:start position:0%
this often creates issues of lack of
 
06:02:26.310 --> 06:02:26.320 align:start position:0%
proof in the courtroom when really we
 
06:02:28.430 --> 06:02:28.440 align:start position:0%
cannot equip them with the technology to
 
06:02:30.788 --> 06:02:30.798 align:start position:0%
properly execute their Duty we already
 
06:02:32.468 --> 06:02:32.478 align:start position:0%
hear stories of intoxicated driving of
 
06:02:34.110 --> 06:02:34.120 align:start position:0%
marijuana combined with other substances
 
06:02:36.430 --> 06:02:36.440 align:start position:0%
on the RVE I don't have to State them
 
06:02:38.430 --> 06:02:38.440 align:start position:0%
for you to know them it is important
 
06:02:41.030 --> 06:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
that it is our responsibility to protect
 
06:02:42.670 --> 06:02:42.680 align:start position:0%
and amend a better life for all Granite
 
06:02:45.708 --> 06:02:45.718 align:start position:0%

professionals drunk stoned buzzed High
 
06:02:50.150 --> 06:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
the matter of fact is that you're under
 
06:02:52.230 --> 06:02:52.240 align:start position:0%
the influence of a substance and you
 
06:02:53.910 --> 06:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
could be struck by an individual at any
 
06:02:56.030 --> 06:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
time on the New Hampshire highway I
 
06:02:57.430 --> 06:02:57.440 align:start position:0%

how many of you read the committee
 
06:03:46.910 --> 06:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
report it should be an embarrassment to
 
06:03:49.190 --> 06:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
the entire house what was read it looks
 
06:03:50.910 --> 06:03:50.920 align:start position:0%
like it's written by
 
06:03:53.750 --> 06:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
prohibitionists it is absolutely amazing
 
06:03:56.190 --> 06:03:56.200 align:start position:0%
our governor suggested a state run
 
06:03:59.468 --> 06:03:59.478 align:start position:0%
store isn't the whole idea of this bill
 
06:04:01.750 --> 06:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
to get government out of the way not to
 
06:04:04.670 --> 06:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
grow government if people want how many
 
06:04:07.190 --> 06:04:07.200 align:start position:0%

don't have to answer if you had coffee
 
06:04:10.390 --> 06:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
this morning you had caffeine I'm going
 
06:04:12.230 --> 06:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
to come back to that we've heard about
 
06:04:15.150 --> 06:04:15.160 align:start position:0%
addiction I'm going to come back to that
 
06:04:17.230 --> 06:04:17.240 align:start position:0%

don't really mix to too um I've been
 
06:04:26.230 --> 06:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
amazed the committee report I read and
 
06:04:28.628 --> 06:04:28.638 align:start position:0%
looking at this bill
 
06:04:30.628 --> 06:04:30.638 align:start position:0%
take the word marijuana out of that
 
06:04:33.708 --> 06:04:33.718 align:start position:0%
committee report and put any other drug
 
06:04:35.548 --> 06:04:35.558 align:start position:0%
or product in there and tell me you'd
 
06:04:38.310 --> 06:04:38.320 align:start position:0%
want to open a store after reading
 
06:04:40.510 --> 06:04:40.520 align:start position:0%
that how could anyone want to open a
 
06:04:43.628 --> 06:04:43.638 align:start position:0%
store after reading that report it's
 
06:04:45.830 --> 06:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
terrifying and as far as education
 
06:04:46.948 --> 06:04:46.958 align:start position:0%

06:04:50.030 --> 06:04:50.040 align:start position:0%
marijuana is bad for I'm 53 years old I
 
06:04:52.030 --> 06:04:52.040 align:start position:0%
don't ever remember being told otherwise
 
06:04:54.990 --> 06:04:55.000 align:start position:0%
marijuana's bad I I think on South Park
 
06:04:55.000 --> 06:04:56.070 align:start position:0%
marijuana's bad I I think on South Park
right

06:04:56.070 --> 06:04:56.080 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:05:00.868 --> 06:05:00.878 align:start position:0%
okay you know what I'm talking about um
 
06:05:02.990 --> 06:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
so that's how I got here I got
 
06:05:05.750 --> 06:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
sidetracked how did we get here today
 
06:05:07.948 --> 06:05:07.958 align:start position:0%
with prohibition if you look at the New
 
06:05:10.750 --> 06:05:10.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution Article three it
 
06:05:14.628 --> 06:05:14.638 align:start position:0%
is very very explicit imagine marijuana
 
06:05:17.190 --> 06:05:17.200 align:start position:0%
was not prohibited today if you looked
 
06:05:19.628 --> 06:05:19.638 align:start position:0%
at that could you in good conscience
 
06:05:22.390 --> 06:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
prohibit others from using marijuana
 
06:05:24.510 --> 06:05:24.520 align:start position:0%
today and if so under what are you going
 
06:05:27.510 --> 06:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
to offer up for that can you you name a
 
06:05:29.150 --> 06:05:29.160 align:start position:0%
single Community here where the average
 
06:05:30.830 --> 06:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
person couldn't go find marijuana
 
06:05:32.230 --> 06:05:32.240 align:start position:0%
probably in under an
 
06:05:34.628 --> 06:05:34.638 align:start position:0%
hour I'm not a regular user don't hold
 
06:05:38.670 --> 06:05:38.680 align:start position:0%
it against me um I just I
 
06:05:42.230 --> 06:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
find the the threats of we have all the
 
06:05:43.788 --> 06:05:43.798 align:start position:0%
threats may not be the right word
 
06:05:46.390 --> 06:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
there's fearmongering though we've heard
 
06:05:48.708 --> 06:05:48.718 align:start position:0%
about addiction has anyone actually read
 
06:05:50.750 --> 06:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
a study about the addictive properties
 
06:05:50.760 --> 06:05:52.310 align:start position:0%
a study about the addictive properties
of

06:05:52.310 --> 06:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:05:54.548 --> 06:05:54.558 align:start position:0%
marijuana well let me tell you what some
 
06:05:58.590 --> 06:05:58.600 align:start position:0%
of the qualities of ADD are you can have
 
06:06:01.310 --> 06:06:01.320 align:start position:0%
a change in mood you can have a change
 
06:06:03.670 --> 06:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
in appetite you can have a change in
 
06:06:07.750 --> 06:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
sleep habits these tend to last about a
 
06:06:09.868 --> 06:06:09.878 align:start position:0%
week ironically and I'm going to get
 
06:06:11.830 --> 06:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
myself in trouble here if you look at
 
06:06:13.670 --> 06:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
the side effects if I can call them that
 
06:06:16.110 --> 06:06:16.120 align:start position:0%
of menstration they're about the
 
06:06:18.350 --> 06:06:18.360 align:start position:0%
same are we going to make being a woman
 
06:06:20.670 --> 06:06:20.680 align:start position:0%
illegal now I'm not Kidd look these up
 
06:06:21.708 --> 06:06:21.718 align:start position:0%
I'm not
 
06:06:24.230 --> 06:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
exaggerating these are what people tell
 
06:06:27.670 --> 06:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
you are signs of addiction
 
06:06:29.590 --> 06:06:29.600 align:start position:0%
I said I'd come back to Coffee anyone
 
06:06:32.190 --> 06:06:32.200 align:start position:0%
know what the habits are coffee is
 
06:06:35.310 --> 06:06:35.320 align:start position:0%
addictive what happens if you quit
 
06:06:39.270 --> 06:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
coffee yet there are signs we can go the
 
06:06:41.070 --> 06:06:41.080 align:start position:0%
whole way back to 1500 there was a guy
 
06:06:42.990 --> 06:06:43.000 align:start position:0%
named paracelsus he's one of the
 
06:06:45.190 --> 06:06:45.200 align:start position:0%
Godfathers of Toxicology he made a very
 
06:06:49.788 --> 06:06:49.798 align:start position:0%
short statement dose makes the
 
06:06:52.990 --> 06:06:53.000 align:start position:0%
poison with still true today we've heard
 
06:06:55.868 --> 06:06:55.878 align:start position:0%
from someone marijuana potency has gone
 
06:06:57.190 --> 06:06:57.200 align:start position:0%
up you know what they've gotten seeds
 
06:06:58.468 --> 06:06:58.478 align:start position:0%
out of marijuana 2o I don't know how
 
06:07:00.030 --> 06:07:00.040 align:start position:0%
many of you were fans of chich and Chong
 
06:07:01.230 --> 06:07:01.240 align:start position:0%
when you were kids I thought those
 
06:07:03.830 --> 06:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
movies were pretty darn funny apparently
 
06:07:05.390 --> 06:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
people don't like smoking seeds
 
06:07:08.510 --> 06:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
surprisingly it's not around today um
 
06:07:10.468 --> 06:07:10.478 align:start position:0%
consumers a free market are going to
 
06:07:12.230 --> 06:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
figure out what they want trying to
 
06:07:13.390 --> 06:07:13.400 align:start position:0%
limit the
 
06:07:15.510 --> 06:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
potency that we saw in this committee
 
06:07:18.350 --> 06:07:18.360 align:start position:0%
report I think is absolutely asinine if
 
06:07:20.190 --> 06:07:20.200 align:start position:0%
we're going to talk about harm reduction
 
06:07:20.200 --> 06:07:20.910 align:start position:0%
we're going to talk about harm reduction
for

06:07:20.910 --> 06:07:20.920 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:07:23.948 --> 06:07:23.958 align:start position:0%
real imagine you have something that's
 
06:07:28.230 --> 06:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
10% THC you have something that's 30%
 
06:07:29.948 --> 06:07:29.958 align:start position:0%
the person who wants to get high has to
 
06:07:33.548 --> 06:07:33.558 align:start position:0%
use three times more product and the
 
06:07:34.910 --> 06:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
major way that marijuana is used is
 
06:07:38.230 --> 06:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
smoked the less you smoke the less risk
 
06:07:40.468 --> 06:07:40.478 align:start position:0%
you have of developing other untour
 
06:07:42.990 --> 06:07:43.000 align:start position:0%
medical conditions can also be consumed
 
06:07:44.510 --> 06:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
by eating it there's other ways to
 
06:07:47.590 --> 06:07:47.600 align:start position:0%
actually consume U marijuana there are
 
06:07:49.868 --> 06:07:49.878 align:start position:0%
side effects there there's no question a
 
06:07:51.030 --> 06:07:51.040 align:start position:0%
lot of that comes from the actual
 
06:07:52.990 --> 06:07:53.000 align:start position:0%
smoking the concentrates that are out
 
06:07:54.628 --> 06:07:54.638 align:start position:0%
there that people use in all kinds of
 
06:07:56.070 --> 06:07:56.080 align:start position:0%
different devices now if you look and
 
06:07:57.868 --> 06:07:57.878 align:start position:0%
see what's out there are absolutely
 
06:07:59.590 --> 06:07:59.600 align:start position:0%
amazing I don't know what they need any
 
06:08:01.948 --> 06:08:01.958 align:start position:0%
more than anyone knows what I like in my
 
06:08:05.910 --> 06:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
coffee marijuana and coffee cannabis and
 
06:08:08.110 --> 06:08:08.120 align:start position:0%
caffeine are a whole lot
 
06:08:10.590 --> 06:08:10.600 align:start position:0%
alike I I don't know what else I can say
 
06:08:13.670 --> 06:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
to this committee but marijuana I if we
 
06:08:15.670 --> 06:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
want to encourage our kids to not use
 
06:08:17.910 --> 06:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
the drug I have three boys I don't want
 
06:08:19.750 --> 06:08:19.760 align:start position:0%
any of them stepping out and starting to
 
06:08:21.708 --> 06:08:21.718 align:start position:0%
use marijuana the oldest is only 11
 
06:08:24.190 --> 06:08:24.200 align:start position:0%

06:08:27.030 --> 06:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
I people talk about public education six
 
06:08:29.948 --> 06:08:29.958 align:start position:0%
out of 10 students in New Hampshire
 
06:08:31.910 --> 06:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
leave the 8th grade and cannot perform
 
06:08:33.590 --> 06:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
math at grade level and you're going to
 
06:08:36.190 --> 06:08:36.200 align:start position:0%
educate them about drugs you want to
 
06:08:37.910 --> 06:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
talk about the PK and the pharmacology
 
06:08:40.788 --> 06:08:40.798 align:start position:0%
and toxicology of marijuana anytime good
 
06:08:44.070 --> 06:08:44.080 align:start position:0%

a modern-day High schooler's
 
06:09:16.070 --> 06:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
perspective I the 14-year-old student
 
06:09:17.670 --> 06:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
who has offered a marijuana Vape in the
 
06:09:19.948 --> 06:09:19.958 align:start position:0%
girls restroom last week the girl who us
 
06:09:21.990 --> 06:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
to Elbow her way passed to visibly high
 
06:09:25.110 --> 06:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
students just to wash her hands the
 
06:09:26.750 --> 06:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
student who is saddened to see her
 
06:09:29.430 --> 06:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
faculty overrun by teen marijuana use
 
06:09:31.110 --> 06:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
and the future professional who fears
 
06:09:33.310 --> 06:09:33.320 align:start position:0%
for the safety of her
 
06:09:36.990 --> 06:09:37.000 align:start position:0%
state in 20122 a survey of 10,000 New
 
06:09:39.750 --> 06:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire adolescents ages 12 to 17
 
06:09:42.350 --> 06:09:42.360 align:start position:0%
found that 80% had recreationally used
 
06:09:45.830 --> 06:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
marijuana in the last in the past month
 
06:09:47.190 --> 06:09:47.200 align:start position:0%
this study was conducted while
 
06:09:49.190 --> 06:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
recreational marijuana is legal in New
 
06:09:50.708 --> 06:09:50.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and it shows that a large
 
06:09:52.350 --> 06:09:52.360 align:start position:0%
amount of juveniles have already found
 
06:09:53.670 --> 06:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
ways to get
 
06:09:56.030 --> 06:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
marijuana if this bill were to be passed
 
06:09:57.670 --> 06:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
it would only make it easier for teens
 
06:09:59.628 --> 06:09:59.638 align:start position:0%
to obtain the drug making teenage
 
06:10:01.310 --> 06:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
marijuana use
 
06:10:03.868 --> 06:10:03.878 align:start position:0%
Skyrocket I cannot begin to imagine the
 
06:10:05.868 --> 06:10:05.878 align:start position:0%
impact that increased access could have
 
06:10:08.708 --> 06:10:08.718 align:start position:0%
to the Adolescence in my community how
 
06:10:10.190 --> 06:10:10.200 align:start position:0%
many kids will be in the restroom using
 
06:10:12.310 --> 06:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
marijuana how many more will be high in
 
06:10:14.190 --> 06:10:14.200 align:start position:0%
class what would this look like long
 
06:10:16.868 --> 06:10:16.878 align:start position:0%
term for my generation statistics have
 
06:10:19.670 --> 06:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
broached these questions already are we
 
06:10:21.990 --> 06:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
listening I find it rather difficult to
 
06:10:23.910 --> 06:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
even fathom all the consequences that
 
06:10:25.390 --> 06:10:25.400 align:start position:0%
this bill carries with it and the
 
06:10:27.110 --> 06:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
generation being most effective ected by
 
06:10:29.190 --> 06:10:29.200 align:start position:0%
it will also be the generation running
 
06:10:30.788 --> 06:10:30.798 align:start position:0%
this country in future
 
06:10:33.150 --> 06:10:33.160 align:start position:0%
years this is a large concern to me
 
06:10:35.868 --> 06:10:35.878 align:start position:0%
knowing one in six adolescents Who start
 
06:10:37.788 --> 06:10:37.798 align:start position:0%
using marijuana before the age of 18
 
06:10:40.230 --> 06:10:40.240 align:start position:0%
will develop marijuana use disorder the
 
06:10:42.310 --> 06:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
inability to stop its use despite the
 
06:10:46.390 --> 06:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
negative effects on their lives meaning
 
06:10:48.670 --> 06:10:48.680 align:start position:0%
addiction New Hampshire has to do its
 
06:10:50.548 --> 06:10:50.558 align:start position:0%
best to protect its Youth and Future
 
06:10:52.750 --> 06:10:52.760 align:start position:0%
Leaders of this country I ask you all to
 
06:10:55.230 --> 06:10:55.240 align:start position:0%
put aside any perceived profits or
 
06:10:57.190 --> 06:10:57.200 align:start position:0%
returns that you feel Maybe gained by
 
06:10:59.750 --> 06:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
passing this bill but instead consider
 
06:11:01.390 --> 06:11:01.400 align:start position:0%
the cost and damage it will cause our
 
06:11:03.468 --> 06:11:03.478 align:start position:0%
youth because I doubt it is a price you
 
06:11:05.468 --> 06:11:05.478 align:start position:0%
were willing to pay thank you for all
 
06:11:06.868 --> 06:11:06.878 align:start position:0%
your time and consideration I'm willing
 
06:11:10.150 --> 06:11:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:12.110 --> 06:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
questions I think we're all questioned
 
06:11:13.910 --> 06:11:13.920 align:start position:0%

put you a higher up on the list but oh
 
06:11:24.080 --> 06:11:25.548 align:start position:0%
put you a higher up on the list but oh
it's

06:11:25.548 --> 06:11:25.558 align:start position:0%
it's
 
06:11:25.558 --> 06:11:28.830 align:start position:0%
it's
so

06:11:28.830 --> 06:11:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:30.310 --> 06:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
06:11:32.510 --> 06:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
committee it is always great to be back
 
06:11:34.110 --> 06:11:34.120 align:start position:0%
in in house Commerce here in New
 
06:11:36.430 --> 06:11:36.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh for the record my name is
 
06:11:38.270 --> 06:11:38.280 align:start position:0%
Ross Connelly I'm the northeast regional
 
06:11:40.708 --> 06:11:40.718 align:start position:0%
director for Americans for Prosperity
 
06:11:42.590 --> 06:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
here to voice our wholehearted support
 
06:11:44.510 --> 06:11:44.520 align:start position:0%
for HB
 
06:11:47.830 --> 06:11:47.840 align:start position:0%
1633 um I just I'll be brief I I'll
 
06:11:49.190 --> 06:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
touch on some of the the things that
 
06:11:52.868 --> 06:11:52.878 align:start position:0%
were discussed um you know this bill we
 
06:11:55.030 --> 06:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
think is the best path forward uh we
 
06:11:56.830 --> 06:11:56.840 align:start position:0%
think having a free market system is the
 
06:12:00.628 --> 06:12:00.638 align:start position:0%
absolute best way to to block block out
 
06:12:03.190 --> 06:12:03.200 align:start position:0%
uh the black market uh eventually it
 
06:12:05.548 --> 06:12:05.558 align:start position:0%
takes time to do that uh as has been
 
06:12:08.350 --> 06:12:08.360 align:start position:0%
pointed out in previous testimony um but
 
06:12:10.270 --> 06:12:10.280 align:start position:0%
this bill does address our our three big
 
06:12:13.590 --> 06:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
pillars which is uh keeping licensing
 
06:12:17.230 --> 06:12:17.240 align:start position:0%
fees low allowing every uh average
 
06:12:19.670 --> 06:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
Granite Staters to enter the market uh
 
06:12:23.230 --> 06:12:23.240 align:start position:0%
to drive down cost uh also having uh
 
06:12:25.590 --> 06:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
robust uh regulations to make sure that
 
06:12:28.590 --> 06:12:28.600 align:start position:0%
it's a safe product for consumers uh and
 
06:12:31.070 --> 06:12:31.080 align:start position:0%
then minimal taxation to make sure that
 
06:12:34.390 --> 06:12:34.400 align:start position:0%
we're we're competitive and also uh
 
06:12:35.948 --> 06:12:35.958 align:start position:0%
probably most importantly making sure
 
06:12:39.150 --> 06:12:39.160 align:start position:0%
that uh that in a legal regulated system
 
06:12:41.030 --> 06:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
that miners cannot access it and makes
 
06:12:43.030 --> 06:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
it very very very difficult for them to
 
06:12:45.468 --> 06:12:45.478 align:start position:0%
access it
 
06:12:49.310 --> 06:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
um I have the the uh you could look at
 
06:12:52.788 --> 06:12:52.798 align:start position:0%
as a benefit or a negative uh ability I
 
06:12:54.510 --> 06:12:54.520 align:start position:0%
I've been working in uh the rest of the
 
06:12:57.788 --> 06:12:57.798 align:start position:0%
New England states over the past year uh
 
06:13:00.230 --> 06:13:00.240 align:start position:0%
and uh as as we know we are surrounded
 
06:13:02.270 --> 06:13:02.280 align:start position:0%
by these states that have decided to to
 
06:13:05.548 --> 06:13:05.558 align:start position:0%
legalize cannabis
 
06:13:09.150 --> 06:13:09.160 align:start position:0%
um they know the position that we're in
 
06:13:11.150 --> 06:13:11.160 align:start position:0%
I I'll just say I've had discussions in
 
06:13:12.868 --> 06:13:12.878 align:start position:0%
in down in Boston with with
 
06:13:15.430 --> 06:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts legislators about this
 
06:13:18.110 --> 06:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
topic and how uh I hope that New
 
06:13:20.590 --> 06:13:20.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire makes the the decision to to
 
06:13:22.910 --> 06:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
move forward and legalize cannabis and
 
06:13:24.830 --> 06:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
their response is New Hampshire will
 
06:13:27.310 --> 06:13:27.320 align:start position:0%
never do it we make make the decisions
 
06:13:30.070 --> 06:13:30.080 align:start position:0%
for them I think it's time for New
 
06:13:32.868 --> 06:13:32.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to make this decision uh and
 
06:13:34.548 --> 06:13:34.558 align:start position:0%
and I know this bill will be worked on
 
06:13:37.468 --> 06:13:37.478 align:start position:0%
going forward um and and we're we're
 
06:13:40.110 --> 06:13:40.120 align:start position:0%
here to to be part of that process to
 
06:13:41.830 --> 06:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
make sure that we can find a bill that
 
06:13:44.150 --> 06:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
has a path to pass the Senate be signed
 
06:13:48.830 --> 06:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
by the governor um but we we we need to
 
06:13:51.310 --> 06:13:51.320 align:start position:0%
do it as soon as possible because the
 
06:13:53.510 --> 06:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
the the status quo that we're in where
 
06:13:56.510 --> 06:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
we're exporting decision making to other
 
06:13:58.670 --> 06:13:58.680 align:start position:0%
States and then our citizens are
 
06:14:00.548 --> 06:14:00.558 align:start position:0%
bringing back this those products that
 
06:14:02.510 --> 06:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
we don't know what the testing
 
06:14:05.070 --> 06:14:05.080 align:start position:0%
requirements might be uh in Maine
 
06:14:06.910 --> 06:14:06.920 align:start position:0%
compared to Massachusetts new New
 
06:14:09.310 --> 06:14:09.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire should have the say in how we
 
06:14:11.390 --> 06:14:11.400 align:start position:0%
set up our our our market and we should
 
06:14:13.948 --> 06:14:13.958 align:start position:0%
get the benefits and we should have uh
 
06:14:17.190 --> 06:14:17.200 align:start position:0%
the oversight of of this this industry
 
06:14:19.948 --> 06:14:19.958 align:start position:0%
because as it stands now any of the the
 
06:14:22.990 --> 06:14:23.000 align:start position:0%
uh arguments that if we legalize this
 
06:14:25.430 --> 06:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
will happen or that will happen uh we
 
06:14:29.230 --> 06:14:29.240 align:start position:0%
would already be seeing that in uh in
 
06:14:32.030 --> 06:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
the state because anybody just go down
 
06:14:33.830 --> 06:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
to Massachusetts a little anecdote I
 
06:14:35.948 --> 06:14:35.958 align:start position:0%
went down Black Friday shopping the the
 
06:14:37.868 --> 06:14:37.878 align:start position:0%
Pheasant Lane Mall right next to the
 
06:14:40.150 --> 06:14:40.160 align:start position:0%
Pheasant Lane Mall right over the Border
 
06:14:41.910 --> 06:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's called Nature's remedy it's
 
06:14:44.990 --> 06:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
a a legal uh recreational uh cannabis
 
06:14:47.750 --> 06:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
store in Massachusetts the line was so
 
06:14:50.590 --> 06:14:50.600 align:start position:0%
long for their Black Friday sale that it
 
06:14:52.510 --> 06:14:52.520 align:start position:0%
went into New
 
06:14:54.750 --> 06:14:54.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and this the police in New
 
06:14:56.430 --> 06:14:56.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire were having direct to to
 
06:14:58.910 --> 06:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
direct traffic for a cannabis store in
 
06:15:02.230 --> 06:15:02.240 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts that's totally absurd and
 
06:15:04.788 --> 06:15:04.798 align:start position:0%
it's time that we we fix that uh and I
 
06:15:07.030 --> 06:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
just will mention we do have concerns
 
06:15:09.390 --> 06:15:09.400 align:start position:0%
you know where it goes to to large State
 
06:15:11.910 --> 06:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
models you know we voiced these concerns
 
06:15:14.830 --> 06:15:14.840 align:start position:0%
before we want to make sure that uh
 
06:15:17.390 --> 06:15:17.400 align:start position:0%
there there is a supply uh that's that's
 
06:15:19.990 --> 06:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
built up so that we're lowering costs
 
06:15:22.548 --> 06:15:22.558 align:start position:0%
and we're competitive with neighbors uh
 
06:15:25.868 --> 06:15:25.878 align:start position:0%
so that's a concern it when it comes to
 
06:15:28.030 --> 06:15:28.040 align:start position:0%
uh like a franchise type model I would
 
06:15:30.390 --> 06:15:30.400 align:start position:0%
just caution I I think some folks
 
06:15:33.510 --> 06:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh different Federal uh
 
06:15:36.548 --> 06:15:36.558 align:start position:0%
implications there but one complaint on
 
06:15:39.310 --> 06:15:39.320 align:start position:0%
a franchise to the federal uh Federal
 
06:15:44.030 --> 06:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
Trade Commission uh could be be uh an
 
06:15:46.150 --> 06:15:46.160 align:start position:0%
issue for the state and I mentioned
 
06:15:48.670 --> 06:15:48.680 align:start position:0%
before on on a a completely state-run
 
06:15:51.030 --> 06:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
model you know putting a New Hampshire
 
06:15:53.430 --> 06:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
pension system at risk uh because state
 
06:15:55.190 --> 06:15:55.200 align:start position:0%
employees are selling a federally
 
06:15:56.788 --> 06:15:56.798 align:start position:0%
illicit product
 
06:16:00.070 --> 06:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
uh is a concern but like I said we we
 
06:16:02.510 --> 06:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
have never opposed a a a cannabis bill
 
06:16:05.830 --> 06:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
at Americans for Prosperity as far as uh
 
06:16:08.350 --> 06:16:08.360 align:start position:0%
I'm here uh we won't uh we want to be
 
06:16:10.190 --> 06:16:10.200 align:start position:0%
part of the process to to make sure we
 
06:16:12.628 --> 06:16:12.638 align:start position:0%
find this path forward uh this coming
 
06:16:17.868 --> 06:16:17.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:21.830 --> 06:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
questions okay thanks thank you very
 
06:16:25.070 --> 06:16:25.080 align:start position:0%
much okay
 
06:16:25.080 --> 06:16:28.070 align:start position:0%
much okay
fry

fry
 
06:16:34.310 --> 06:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:54.990 --> 06:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:55.000 --> 06:17:03.390 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

06:17:03.390 --> 06:17:03.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:04.948 --> 06:17:04.958 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the committee
 
06:17:06.708 --> 06:17:06.718 align:start position:0%
I know it's been a long afternoon I will
 
06:17:09.868 --> 06:17:09.878 align:start position:0%
try to be very brief you are getting my
 
06:17:12.548 --> 06:17:12.558 align:start position:0%
written testimony as well as a side by
 
06:17:14.190 --> 06:17:14.200 align:start position:0%
side with our Prince new Futures
 
06:17:17.230 --> 06:17:17.240 align:start position:0%
principles why I'm glad others are
 
06:17:19.430 --> 06:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
presenting a comparison to you I would
 
06:17:21.430 --> 06:17:21.440 align:start position:0%
rather do that since I'm from New
 
06:17:25.270 --> 06:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
futures um and you'll also get a copy of
 
06:17:28.430 --> 06:17:28.440 align:start position:0%
uh the quack back report who um does
 
06:17:32.430 --> 06:17:32.440 align:start position:0%
follow a state model so um again my name
 
06:17:34.350 --> 06:17:34.360 align:start position:0%
is Kate fry I'm the vice president of
 
06:17:36.990 --> 06:17:37.000 align:start position:0%
advocacy at new Futures we're nonprofit
 
06:17:39.990 --> 06:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan organization that works on
 
06:17:42.788 --> 06:17:42.798 align:start position:0%
health and wellness policies um and we
 
06:17:45.430 --> 06:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
work closely with policy makers
 
06:17:47.310 --> 06:17:47.320 align:start position:0%
stakeholders prevention Partners to
 
06:17:49.868 --> 06:17:49.878 align:start position:0%
prevent reduce alcohol and drug problems
 
06:17:52.548 --> 06:17:52.558 align:start position:0%
in our state so we here at new Futures
 
06:17:54.310 --> 06:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
believe that it is imperative get
 
06:17:56.548 --> 06:17:56.558 align:start position:0%
cannabis commercialization policy right
 
06:17:59.510 --> 06:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
from the start optimal policy from our
 
06:18:01.510 --> 06:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
state must best utilize the best
 
06:18:04.590 --> 06:18:04.600 align:start position:0%
available scientific evidence to reduce
 
06:18:07.230 --> 06:18:07.240 align:start position:0%
Public Health harm limit Youth and
 
06:18:09.510 --> 06:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
problematic use and purposely Advance
 
06:18:11.708 --> 06:18:11.718 align:start position:0%
social justice and Equity that's why
 
06:18:13.270 --> 06:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
we've created our principles for
 
06:18:16.670 --> 06:18:16.680 align:start position:0%
cannabis policy and regulation guide and
 
06:18:18.868 --> 06:18:18.878 align:start position:0%
um we track how it each bill aligns with
 
06:18:21.230 --> 06:18:21.240 align:start position:0%
these principles um so as you have in
 
06:18:23.590 --> 06:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
the document they principles include
 
06:18:25.310 --> 06:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
protecting Children and Youth promoting
 
06:18:27.230 --> 06:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
social justice jce and opportunities for
 
06:18:28.910 --> 06:18:28.920 align:start position:0%
Equity protecting public health and
 
06:18:31.030 --> 06:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
ensuring appropriate funding for
 
06:18:33.150 --> 06:18:33.160 align:start position:0%
cannabis re uh Revenue directed to
 
06:18:33.160 --> 06:18:34.468 align:start position:0%
cannabis re uh Revenue directed to
reduce

06:18:34.468 --> 06:18:34.478 align:start position:0%
reduce
 
06:18:37.350 --> 06:18:37.360 align:start position:0%
harms again you will have our testimony
 
06:18:40.270 --> 06:18:40.280 align:start position:0%
that um does a side by side while again
 
06:18:42.868 --> 06:18:42.878 align:start position:0%
I appreciate others interpreting what
 
06:18:45.390 --> 06:18:45.400 align:start position:0%
our uh principles are and how they align
 
06:18:48.788 --> 06:18:48.798 align:start position:0%
I'll do that very quickly um I will say
 
06:18:51.190 --> 06:18:51.200 align:start position:0%
I'm protecting Children and Youth um
 
06:18:53.788 --> 06:18:53.798 align:start position:0%
there were previous versions of the bill
 
06:18:55.910 --> 06:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
that were actually stronger in this area
 
06:18:59.510 --> 06:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
than House Bill 633 um it does not have
 
06:19:01.548 --> 06:19:01.558 align:start position:0%
potency limits we feel strongly there
 
06:19:04.990 --> 06:19:05.000 align:start position:0%
needs to be potency limits based on um
 
06:19:08.948 --> 06:19:08.958 align:start position:0%
the evidence of uh addiction increases
 
06:19:12.110 --> 06:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
and increases in um psychosis based on
 
06:19:15.510 --> 06:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
high potency products um we hear a lot
 
06:19:16.948 --> 06:19:16.958 align:start position:0%
that it's a plant it's a highly
 
06:19:20.070 --> 06:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
engineered plant and um potency limits
 
06:19:21.990 --> 06:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
have been adopted in other states we
 
06:19:24.110 --> 06:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
would um ask New Hampshire to do the
 
06:19:27.430 --> 06:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
same um there is an Advisory board that
 
06:19:29.030 --> 06:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
just makes recommendations but there's
 
06:19:30.750 --> 06:19:30.760 align:start position:0%
nothing in the statute that requires it
 
06:19:33.430 --> 06:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
to happen um they have this bill has
 
06:19:35.390 --> 06:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
weaker regulations on prohibitions
 
06:19:38.150 --> 06:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
around advertising and marketing than I
 
06:19:40.468 --> 06:19:40.478 align:start position:0%
think the last bill considered by um
 
06:19:43.948 --> 06:19:43.958 align:start position:0%
this committee um for example it include
 
06:19:46.070 --> 06:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
it doesn't include a clear prohibition
 
06:19:47.948 --> 06:19:47.958 align:start position:0%
on marketing to minor specifically
 
06:19:51.350 --> 06:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
related uh to social media I also have
 
06:19:55.030 --> 06:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
put in language in the last Square so
 
06:19:57.468 --> 06:19:57.478 align:start position:0%
you have amended language uh we offered
 
06:20:00.910 --> 06:20:00.920 align:start position:0%
you amended language um also it does not
 
06:20:03.948 --> 06:20:03.958 align:start position:0%
require the standard recognizable symbol
 
06:20:06.670 --> 06:20:06.680 align:start position:0%
for cannabis um advertising the language
 
06:20:09.670 --> 06:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
is May as opposed to Shell and it does
 
06:20:11.750 --> 06:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
not include a Prohibition for billboard
 
06:20:13.430 --> 06:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
advertising which is the case with
 
06:20:17.030 --> 06:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
alcohol advertising um the buffer zone
 
06:20:20.670 --> 06:20:20.680 align:start position:0%
piece of it it excludes preschools so it
 
06:20:23.030 --> 06:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
requires Elementary and secondary
 
06:20:25.030 --> 06:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
schools to be within that th000 ft but
 
06:20:27.670 --> 06:20:27.680 align:start position:0%
not preschool schol previous uh versions
 
06:20:31.910 --> 06:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
have pre uh preschools we would also um
 
06:20:34.708 --> 06:20:34.718 align:start position:0%
ask that uh what be included based on
 
06:20:34.718 --> 06:20:35.510 align:start position:0%
ask that uh what be included based on
the,

06:20:35.510 --> 06:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
the,
 
06:20:40.430 --> 06:20:40.440 align:start position:0%
1400% increase in cannabis um poisonings
 
06:20:42.350 --> 06:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
uh be addressed through requiring
 
06:20:44.948 --> 06:20:44.958 align:start position:0%
cannabis retail stores to sell
 
06:20:48.510 --> 06:20:48.520 align:start position:0%
medication lock boxes um just sell them
 
06:20:50.030 --> 06:20:50.040 align:start position:0%
people don't have to buy them they're
 
06:20:51.868 --> 06:20:51.878 align:start position:0%
just sold it's the safest way to keep
 
06:20:55.350 --> 06:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
your cannabis um safe from um kids and
 
06:20:55.360 --> 06:20:56.150 align:start position:0%
your cannabis um safe from um kids and
other

06:20:56.150 --> 06:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
other
 
06:20:58.430 --> 06:20:58.440 align:start position:0%
individuals um in the promoting social
 
06:21:00.868 --> 06:21:00.878 align:start position:0%
justice and Equity while there's an En
 
06:21:03.230 --> 06:21:03.240 align:start position:0%
nment process there isn't anything that
 
06:21:05.270 --> 06:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
provides economic opportunities for
 
06:21:07.350 --> 06:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
those communities impacted on the war
 
06:21:08.788 --> 06:21:08.798 align:start position:0%
and drugs well there's a Community
 
06:21:11.150 --> 06:21:11.160 align:start position:0%
reinvestment Fund it's not the
 
06:21:13.750 --> 06:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
originally intendent Justice investment
 
06:21:16.948 --> 06:21:16.958 align:start position:0%
fund that many supporters had um
 
06:21:19.350 --> 06:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
supported in the original vot and then
 
06:21:22.510 --> 06:21:22.520 align:start position:0%
lastly on the revenue piece I am not a
 
06:21:26.910 --> 06:21:26.920 align:start position:0%
math uh whiz at all but um I will say
 
06:21:29.270 --> 06:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
that uh the funding for the Substance
 
06:21:31.708 --> 06:21:31.718 align:start position:0%
Abuse Prevention Recovery Fund while I'm
 
06:21:34.430 --> 06:21:34.440 align:start position:0%
very thankful there is that fund of
 
06:21:37.830 --> 06:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
which 10% is she be allocated it looks
 
06:21:37.840 --> 06:21:39.270 align:start position:0%
which 10% is she be allocated it looks
like

06:21:39.270 --> 06:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
like
 
06:21:42.590 --> 06:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
120% prior to that 10% is going to
 
06:21:45.390 --> 06:21:45.400 align:start position:0%
pensions education and the involment F
 
06:21:48.628 --> 06:21:48.638 align:start position:0%
investment fund so I'm not exactly sure
 
06:21:52.750 --> 06:21:52.760 align:start position:0%
how 120% can go to other areas and there
 
06:21:54.750 --> 06:21:54.760 align:start position:0%
would be any funding left over for
 
06:21:57.548 --> 06:21:57.558 align:start position:0%
substance use prevention and recovery so
 
06:21:59.350 --> 06:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
I would ask somebody to look at the math
 
06:22:02.310 --> 06:22:02.320 align:start position:0%
again I'm not a math Wiz um and then
 
06:22:04.750 --> 06:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
lastly we just want to make sure that we
 
06:22:06.150 --> 06:22:06.160 align:start position:0%
have that New Hampshire has an
 
06:22:07.670 --> 06:22:07.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity to approach the most
 
06:22:09.390 --> 06:22:09.400 align:start position:0%
responsible model of cannabis
 
06:22:11.910 --> 06:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
commercialization for its residents the
 
06:22:13.708 --> 06:22:13.718 align:start position:0%
data suggests that one of the best
 
06:22:16.750 --> 06:22:16.760 align:start position:0%
examples of safer commercialization is
 
06:22:19.430 --> 06:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
in Quebec which utiliz its existing
 
06:22:22.150 --> 06:22:22.160 align:start position:0%
public alcohol system to create an
 
06:22:24.830 --> 06:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
exclusive providence province owned
 
06:22:27.628 --> 06:22:27.638 align:start position:0%
cannabis ret sales system it operates
 
06:22:29.750 --> 06:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
stores and collects Revenue but it
 
06:22:32.190 --> 06:22:32.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't aggressively advertise cannabis
 
06:22:34.590 --> 06:22:34.600 align:start position:0%
except where to get it legally and
 
06:22:36.628 --> 06:22:36.638 align:start position:0%
strongly limits the types of products to
 
06:22:39.110 --> 06:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
avoid the more dangerous High potency
 
06:22:40.910 --> 06:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
concentrates and products that are
 
06:22:43.750 --> 06:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
attractive to kids um it's had the same
 
06:22:45.468 --> 06:22:45.478 align:start position:0%
trans High transition to the legal
 
06:22:48.590 --> 06:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
Market as other provinces but with less
 
06:22:51.910 --> 06:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
growth in conception and high public
 
06:22:55.070 --> 06:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
satisfaction um and they've generated um
 
06:22:57.628 --> 06:22:57.638 align:start position:0%
quite a bit money as well while keeping
 
06:23:00.150 --> 06:23:00.160 align:start position:0%
the use of dangerous products um low in
 
06:23:02.548 --> 06:23:02.558 align:start position:0%
their Province um so I've included
 
06:23:05.708 --> 06:23:05.718 align:start position:0%
copies of that report um the study
 
06:23:07.510 --> 06:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
committee did look at this model while
 
06:23:09.868 --> 06:23:09.878 align:start position:0%
there was no final recommendation we
 
06:23:11.548 --> 06:23:11.558 align:start position:0%
encourage this committee to look at
 
06:23:13.708 --> 06:23:13.718 align:start position:0%
benefits of a state model as opposed to
 
06:23:15.788 --> 06:23:15.798 align:start position:0%
the industry-driven private model in
 
06:23:18.150 --> 06:23:18.160 align:start position:0%
front of you we urge the committee to
 
06:23:21.510 --> 06:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
amend House Bill 6 1633 to meet new
 
06:23:24.150 --> 06:23:24.160 align:start position:0%
Futures principles and create the best
 
06:23:26.548 --> 06:23:26.558 align:start position:0%
model for the good of its residents not
 
06:23:28.990 --> 06:23:29.000 align:start position:0%
the Cannabis industry we'd be happy to
 
06:23:30.590 --> 06:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
provide the committee with language to
 
06:23:32.270 --> 06:23:32.280 align:start position:0%
ensure all principles are included in
 
06:23:34.510 --> 06:23:34.520 align:start position:0%
these bills I have included it in the
 
06:23:36.190 --> 06:23:36.200 align:start position:0%
side by side as well but I'm happy to
 
06:23:43.030 --> 06:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:45.948 --> 06:23:45.958 align:start position:0%
needed representative Gibbs has a
 
06:23:48.190 --> 06:23:48.200 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr
 
06:23:50.548 --> 06:23:50.558 align:start position:0%
chairman uh and I'm afraid this is
 
06:23:53.708 --> 06:23:53.718 align:start position:0%
another would you believe um I'll make
 
06:23:56.070 --> 06:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
it as quick as I can um uh would you
 
06:24:00.468 --> 06:24:00.478 align:start position:0%
believe that the attempt to help those
 
06:24:02.150 --> 06:24:02.160 align:start position:0%
who were negatively affected by
 
06:24:04.830 --> 06:24:04.840 align:start position:0%
criminalization in the past is one of
 
06:24:09.468 --> 06:24:09.478 align:start position:0%
the things that made the um New York
 
06:24:12.830 --> 06:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
legalization process so complicated that
 
06:24:14.788 --> 06:24:14.798 align:start position:0%
it was practically
 
06:24:18.868 --> 06:24:18.878 align:start position:0%
impossible uh to get a license to uh
 
06:24:21.548 --> 06:24:21.558 align:start position:0%
legally sell marijuana uh with the
 
06:24:23.510 --> 06:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
result that the black market stayed in
 
06:24:25.628 --> 06:24:25.638 align:start position:0%
effect and there were practically no
 
06:24:28.548 --> 06:24:28.558 align:start position:0%
legal marijuana dealers I believe you're
 
06:24:30.708 --> 06:24:30.718 align:start position:0%
talking about the maybe a licensing
 
06:24:32.670 --> 06:24:32.680 align:start position:0%
approach that they took um that's not
 
06:24:34.670 --> 06:24:34.680 align:start position:0%
the only way you can create economic
 
06:24:36.468 --> 06:24:36.478 align:start position:0%
opportunities for those impacted by in
 
06:24:39.190 --> 06:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
the War on Drugs you can create a funds
 
06:24:41.628 --> 06:24:41.638 align:start position:0%
you can create um opportunities for
 
06:24:44.390 --> 06:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
investment other opportunities like that
 
06:24:46.830 --> 06:24:46.840 align:start position:0%
there was a Justice reinvestment Fund in
 
06:24:49.830 --> 06:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
one previous version that um is more of
 
06:24:52.670 --> 06:24:52.680 align:start position:0%
a fund that offers um opportunities to
 
06:24:57.350 --> 06:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
people like job training um help with um
 
06:25:01.030 --> 06:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
expungement um help with education um so
 
06:25:03.750 --> 06:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't rule out one States bad
 
06:25:06.510 --> 06:25:06.520 align:start position:0%
experience with licensing um and just
 
06:25:10.350 --> 06:25:10.360 align:start position:0%
not do any um social justice um
 
06:25:12.910 --> 06:25:12.920 align:start position:0%
Provisions in a bill just because of one
 
06:25:16.030 --> 06:25:16.040 align:start position:0%
bill one State's experience thank you
 
06:25:18.868 --> 06:25:18.878 align:start position:0%
represent Amon Mr chair thank you for
 
06:25:21.350 --> 06:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
taking our questions um I'm just looking
 
06:25:25.390 --> 06:25:25.400 align:start position:0%
at a a post on NHC can.org
 
06:25:28.110 --> 06:25:28.120 align:start position:0%
and they say that this bill this
 
06:25:31.230 --> 06:25:31.240 align:start position:0%
particular Bill 1633 meets 83% of the
 
06:25:34.150 --> 06:25:34.160 align:start position:0%
new Futures requirements yeah I just
 
06:25:36.590 --> 06:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
want to that's probably their estimate
 
06:25:39.310 --> 06:25:39.320 align:start position:0%
83% yeah I was wondering my question is
 
06:25:43.190 --> 06:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
uh what percentage or uh does this bill
 
06:25:45.590 --> 06:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
meet uh a good majority of your
 
06:25:48.150 --> 06:25:48.160 align:start position:0%
requirements and uh if not how so so
 
06:25:50.510 --> 06:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
I've handed that out so in an area
 
06:25:52.390 --> 06:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
that's red it doesn't meet the principle
 
06:25:55.270 --> 06:25:55.280 align:start position:0%
in an area that's yellow it's somewhat
 
06:25:57.670 --> 06:25:57.680 align:start position:0%
close but needs um amending and I've
 
06:26:00.468 --> 06:26:00.478 align:start position:0%
offered language and green that's where
 
06:26:02.628 --> 06:26:02.638 align:start position:0%
the principal is met I'm really happy
 
06:26:04.150 --> 06:26:04.160 align:start position:0%
that the Cannabis Association is
 
06:26:05.750 --> 06:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
concerned about our principles but no
 
06:26:09.270 --> 06:26:09.280 align:start position:0%
one's contacted me to uh discuss those
 
06:26:13.110 --> 06:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
and um uh really sit down and talk about
 
06:26:15.350 --> 06:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
them and compare with our principles
 
06:26:16.788 --> 06:26:16.798 align:start position:0%
maybe in their eyes they've met our

that I can provide them that would get

them to grain so um I think it's all in

increased in recent years it has become

what about the supposed benefits of
 
06:27:52.708 --> 06:27:52.718 align:start position:0%
legalization is crime decreased now that
 
06:27:54.468 --> 06:27:54.478 align:start position:0%
it's legal to buy sell and possess
 
06:27:56.788 --> 06:27:56.798 align:start position:0%
marijuana are states that legalized
 
06:28:00.070 --> 06:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
marijuana rolling in new tax revenues
 
06:28:02.190 --> 06:28:02.200 align:start position:0%
are fewer people taking opioids and

option the answers are no no and
 
06:28:11.390 --> 06:28:11.400 align:start position:0%
no legalization has clearly increased
 
06:28:13.788 --> 06:28:13.798 align:start position:0%
crime strict regulations and taxes
 
06:28:15.750 --> 06:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
placed on legal sellers have created a
 
06:28:18.190 --> 06:28:18.200 align:start position:0%
vast illicit Market that easily
 
06:28:21.310 --> 06:28:21.320 align:start position:0%
undercuts the legal Market on price and
 
06:28:23.190 --> 06:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
because possession is legal it is
 
06:28:25.190 --> 06:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
virtually impossible to crack down down
 
06:28:27.750 --> 06:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
on the illegal Market this has left
 
06:28:29.750 --> 06:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
rural communities that never experienced
 
06:28:32.430 --> 06:28:32.440 align:start position:0%
drug violence before vulnerable this has
 
06:28:34.868 --> 06:28:34.878 align:start position:0%
brought drug related shootouts robberies
 
06:28:37.510 --> 06:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
kidnappings and killings to communities
 
06:28:40.190 --> 06:28:40.200 align:start position:0%
that never had them before with the
 
06:28:42.190 --> 06:28:42.200 align:start position:0%
illegal Market roughly double the size
 
06:28:44.628 --> 06:28:44.638 align:start position:0%
of the legal one estimated tax revenues
 
06:28:47.510 --> 06:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
from legal marijuana s Sals have fallen
 
06:28:50.670 --> 06:28:50.680 align:start position:0%
far short of expectations leaving States
 
06:28:52.948 --> 06:28:52.958 align:start position:0%
stuck with massive bills for increased

without the extra Revenue to pay for
 
06:29:00.030 --> 06:29:00.040 align:start position:0%
them Recent research confirms
 
06:29:02.110 --> 06:29:02.120 align:start position:0%
legalization is also associated with
 
06:29:05.510 --> 06:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
higher opioid uis and M mortality
 
06:29:07.230 --> 06:29:07.240 align:start position:0%
instead of acting as a substitute for
 
06:29:10.190 --> 06:29:10.200 align:start position:0%
more harmful drugs legal marijuana is a
 
06:29:12.430 --> 06:29:12.440 align:start position:0%
gateway to their increased
 
06:29:15.070 --> 06:29:15.080 align:start position:0%

speaking of data from the' 7s my brother
 
06:29:28.868 --> 06:29:28.878 align:start position:0%
started smoking in the 70s and he
 
06:29:31.430 --> 06:29:31.440 align:start position:0%

years ago we searched for him online and
 
06:29:47.750 --> 06:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
found a mug shot from when he was

you to try to be uh brief and try to say

material uh I live in Hillsboro uh New
 
06:31:20.990 --> 06:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I have a USDA hemp grower
 
06:31:22.788 --> 06:31:22.798 align:start position:0%
license I've been a farmer my entire
 
06:31:25.270 --> 06:31:25.280 align:start position:0%
life I also serve on the advisory Board
 
06:31:27.030 --> 06:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire cannabis
 
06:31:30.070 --> 06:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
Association and last fall I led an
 
06:31:33.388 --> 06:31:33.398 align:start position:0%
effort uh working with the Farm Bureau
 
06:31:35.468 --> 06:31:35.478 align:start position:0%
and the Northeast organic Farmers
 
06:31:38.310 --> 06:31:38.320 align:start position:0%
Association New Hampshire to survey
 
06:31:41.590 --> 06:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
farmers in New Hampshire to see what
 
06:31:43.948 --> 06:31:43.958 align:start position:0%
their position is on
 
06:31:47.190 --> 06:31:47.200 align:start position:0%
legalization and 87% of The respondents
 
06:31:49.868 --> 06:31:49.878 align:start position:0%
Who currently Farm support
 
06:31:53.868 --> 06:31:53.878 align:start position:0%
legalization and 78% of those expressed
 
06:31:57.150 --> 06:31:57.160 align:start position:0%
interest in becoming licensed Growers so
 
06:31:59.110 --> 06:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
there is interest and there is support
 
06:32:01.788 --> 06:32:01.798 align:start position:0%
amongst agricultural community and one
 
06:32:04.190 --> 06:32:04.200 align:start position:0%
of the most surprising results was a
 
06:32:07.110 --> 06:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
level of support for homegrown cannabis
 
06:32:10.548 --> 06:32:10.558 align:start position:0%
the ability to grow a few plants 89% of
 
06:32:13.350 --> 06:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
the respondents supported allowing uh
 
06:32:15.270 --> 06:32:15.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents to grow six to
 
06:32:19.590 --> 06:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
eight plants there wasn't was not strong
 
06:32:22.948 --> 06:32:22.958 align:start position:0%
support for a state-run monopoly only
 
06:32:25.750 --> 06:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
10% of New Hampshire Farmers supported
 
06:32:28.590 --> 06:32:28.600 align:start position:0%
the state being the sole outlet for
 
06:32:31.868 --> 06:32:31.878 align:start position:0%
cannabis products in New
 
06:32:33.990 --> 06:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I also
 
06:32:36.510 --> 06:32:36.520 align:start position:0%
attended all but the last two of the
 
06:32:39.468 --> 06:32:39.478 align:start position:0%
Cannabis commission hearings
 
06:32:41.548 --> 06:32:41.558 align:start position:0%
meetings and uh which was very
 
06:32:43.708 --> 06:32:43.718 align:start position:0%
fascinating and it was really focused on
 
06:32:46.150 --> 06:32:46.160 align:start position:0%
developing a bill around a franchise
 
06:32:48.868 --> 06:32:48.878 align:start position:0%
model which did not get forwarded here
 
06:32:51.030 --> 06:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
from the commission but there was a lot
 
06:32:53.548 --> 06:32:53.558 align:start position:0%
of discussion of a com a franchise
 
06:32:53.558 --> 06:32:56.350 align:start position:0%
of discussion of a com a franchise
system

06:32:56.350 --> 06:32:56.360 align:start position:0%
system
 
06:32:58.388 --> 06:32:58.398 align:start position:0%
and one thing I learned when the
 
06:33:00.670 --> 06:33:00.680 align:start position:0%
Attorney General uh uh representative
 
06:33:03.750 --> 06:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
spoke is a franchise system would not
 
06:33:06.788 --> 06:33:06.798 align:start position:0%
protect the state from liability at all
 
06:33:08.590 --> 06:33:08.600 align:start position:0%
because to have a franchise you had to
 
06:33:10.590 --> 06:33:10.600 align:start position:0%
sell something you have to franchise
 
06:33:13.030 --> 06:33:13.040 align:start position:0%
something of value so it would be a
 
06:33:15.990 --> 06:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
state brand and the state would be
 
06:33:19.830 --> 06:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
franchising the sale of New Hampshire
 
06:33:23.350 --> 06:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
cannabis Outlet products and so if
 
06:33:26.310 --> 06:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
someone is harmed at a franchise they're
 
06:33:27.990 --> 06:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
not just going to stop by suing the
 
06:33:30.910 --> 06:33:30.920 align:start position:0%
franchise no the state is the one that
 
06:33:33.788 --> 06:33:33.798 align:start position:0%
owns that by being the
 
06:33:38.510 --> 06:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
franchisor um the uh another problem was
 
06:33:41.548 --> 06:33:41.558 align:start position:0%
that the structure of the the franchise
 
06:33:44.270 --> 06:33:44.280 align:start position:0%
system The Liquor Commission would be
 
06:33:47.590 --> 06:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
both the regulator and the marketer now
 
06:33:49.590 --> 06:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
that's an inherent conflict of interests
 
06:33:51.830 --> 06:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
that's a built-in uh conflict of
 
06:33:54.948 --> 06:33:54.958 align:start position:0%
interest and franchises are controlled
 
06:33:58.030 --> 06:33:58.040 align:start position:0%
by the Federal Trade Commission so this
 
06:34:00.230 --> 06:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
is under Federal control so the state
 
06:34:03.990 --> 06:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
would be stepping directly in to control
 
06:34:07.510 --> 06:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
by the FTC over this and the fees that
 
06:34:09.310 --> 06:34:09.320 align:start position:0%
were talked about were just exorbitant
 
06:34:11.868 --> 06:34:11.878 align:start position:0%
around a million dollar to have a
 
06:34:14.350 --> 06:34:14.360 align:start position:0%
franchise in certain locations around
 
06:34:16.350 --> 06:34:16.360 align:start position:0%
the state and you may have missed that
 
06:34:19.708 --> 06:34:19.718 align:start position:0%
uh meeting uh uh Mr chair but yes that
 
06:34:22.670 --> 06:34:22.680 align:start position:0%
was you mean when I had Co well when
 
06:34:25.468 --> 06:34:25.478 align:start position:0%
you're in Amsterdam um
 
06:34:30.150 --> 06:34:30.160 align:start position:0%
but uh anyway the franchise model really
 
06:34:31.948 --> 06:34:31.958 align:start position:0%
stifles free
 
06:34:34.990 --> 06:34:35.000 align:start position:0%
enterprise um and it really it's not
 
06:34:36.750 --> 06:34:36.760 align:start position:0%
going to stop the illicit market and I
 
06:34:38.310 --> 06:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
hate people calling it The Black Market
 
06:34:41.150 --> 06:34:41.160 align:start position:0%
please call it the illicit Market um it
 
06:34:42.750 --> 06:34:42.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't do anything to help Granite
 
06:34:46.468 --> 06:34:46.478 align:start position:0%
State farmers and uh I think we have a
 
06:34:48.750 --> 06:34:48.760 align:start position:0%
much better model and the thing with yes
 
06:34:51.670 --> 06:34:51.680 align:start position:0%
Quebec is running a state you know
 
06:34:54.910 --> 06:34:54.920 align:start position:0%
Province but they're in a legal country
 
06:34:57.230 --> 06:34:57.240 align:start position:0%
we're still in a federal
 
06:35:03.430 --> 06:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
prohibition and uh um the uh bill that
 
06:35:05.468 --> 06:35:05.478 align:start position:0%
is put before you
 
06:35:08.270 --> 06:35:08.280 align:start position:0%
1633 um I think is the best way to go
 
06:35:09.750 --> 06:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
yes there's some improvements that were
 
06:35:11.708 --> 06:35:11.718 align:start position:0%
suggested today that should certainly be
 
06:35:12.910 --> 06:35:12.920 align:start position:0%
taken into
 
06:35:15.150 --> 06:35:15.160 align:start position:0%
consideration um but I've been spending
 
06:35:18.388 --> 06:35:18.398 align:start position:0%
time lately in Vermont Maine and in
 
06:35:21.388 --> 06:35:21.398 align:start position:0%
Minnesota uh and Minnesota just
 
06:35:23.590 --> 06:35:23.600 align:start position:0%
legalized so they're still in the
 
06:35:26.310 --> 06:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
process of of rolling out the rules but
 
06:35:28.110 --> 06:35:28.120 align:start position:0%
there was question asked earlier about
 
06:35:30.670 --> 06:35:30.680 align:start position:0%
sobriety test and they actually do have
 
06:35:33.468 --> 06:35:33.478 align:start position:0%
a field sobriety test that they're in a
 
06:35:36.350 --> 06:35:36.360 align:start position:0%
one-year validation process which is
 
06:35:38.548 --> 06:35:38.558 align:start position:0%
what happened with a breathalyzer when
 
06:35:40.350 --> 06:35:40.360 align:start position:0%
it was first rolled out it wasn't just
 
06:35:42.910 --> 06:35:42.920 align:start position:0%
put right out there and you know rely on
 
06:35:45.468 --> 06:35:45.478 align:start position:0%
the results it takes validation and so
 
06:35:47.270 --> 06:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
right now there's a year of validation
 
06:35:49.468 --> 06:35:49.478 align:start position:0%
going on in Minnesota so it's something
 
06:35:53.590 --> 06:35:53.600 align:start position:0%
to look at uh as this uh takes effect
 
06:35:55.070 --> 06:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
but the thing that's really struck me in
 
06:35:57.548 --> 06:35:57.558 align:start position:0%
these states which have legalized is the
 
06:35:59.230 --> 06:35:59.240 align:start position:0%
level of economic activity that's
 
06:36:02.788 --> 06:36:02.798 align:start position:0%
happening I me people are excited young
 
06:36:05.030 --> 06:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
people have a future they're talking
 
06:36:06.590 --> 06:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
about science they're talking about
 
06:36:07.948 --> 06:36:07.958 align:start position:0%
marketing they're talking about
 
06:36:10.030 --> 06:36:10.040 align:start position:0%
packaging they're meeting one another
 
06:36:11.868 --> 06:36:11.878 align:start position:0%
they're have all these different
 
06:36:14.788 --> 06:36:14.798 align:start position:0%
conventions and events going on to share
 
06:36:17.030 --> 06:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
information and I really think that
 
06:36:18.948 --> 06:36:18.958 align:start position:0%
that's something that uh uh New
 
06:36:23.270 --> 06:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire could use um you know so I
 
06:36:26.990 --> 06:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
really hope that this is the year we
 
06:36:29.350 --> 06:36:29.360 align:start position:0%
move a bill all the way through the
 
06:36:31.990 --> 06:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
house thank you very much and the Senate
 
06:36:34.468 --> 06:36:34.478 align:start position:0%
needs to get on board and the governor
 
06:36:37.350 --> 06:36:37.360 align:start position:0%
no the governor needs this is his legacy
 
06:36:40.230 --> 06:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
his last chance let's put the best Bill
 
06:36:42.590 --> 06:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
forward that the farmers support that's
 
06:36:45.310 --> 06:36:45.320 align:start position:0%
based in free enterprise that's you know
 
06:36:48.788 --> 06:36:48.798 align:start position:0%
follows our model that leads to a safe
 
06:36:53.310 --> 06:36:53.320 align:start position:0%
tested regulated and taxed Market in the
 
06:36:54.868 --> 06:36:54.878 align:start position:0%
livefree state
 
06:36:54.878 --> 06:36:57.270 align:start position:0%
livefree state
thank

06:36:57.270 --> 06:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:00.990 --> 06:37:01.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:09.750 --> 06:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:12.350 --> 06:37:12.360 align:start position:0%
Allegre thank you chairman hunt my name
 
06:37:13.628 --> 06:37:13.638 align:start position:0%
is Dan
 
06:37:15.868 --> 06:37:15.878 align:start position:0%
Alig uh I'm here today as a member of
 
06:37:18.750 --> 06:37:18.760 align:start position:0%
the public I have no pecuniary interest
 
06:37:21.030 --> 06:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
in the Cannabis industry I have not been
 
06:37:22.948 --> 06:37:22.958 align:start position:0%
prompted by anyone to be here I not
 
06:37:25.110 --> 06:37:25.120 align:start position:0%
being paid by anyone to be here here my
 
06:37:26.310 --> 06:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
testimony which I submitted
 
06:37:29.310 --> 06:37:29.320 align:start position:0%
electronically is my own and unlike
 
06:37:31.350 --> 06:37:31.360 align:start position:0%
representative kahill's suggestion I am
 
06:37:31.360 --> 06:37:32.670 align:start position:0%
representative kahill's suggestion I am
not

06:37:32.670 --> 06:37:32.680 align:start position:0%
not
 
06:37:36.708 --> 06:37:36.718 align:start position:0%
uninformed um the point has been made
 
06:37:38.670 --> 06:37:38.680 align:start position:0%
made by opponents that there are
 
06:37:41.830 --> 06:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
heartbreaking stories of cannabis abuse
 
06:37:45.388 --> 06:37:45.398 align:start position:0%
lives ruined automobile accidents uh
 
06:37:45.398 --> 06:37:46.628 align:start position:0%
lives ruined automobile accidents uh
medical

06:37:46.628 --> 06:37:46.638 align:start position:0%
medical
 
06:37:50.270 --> 06:37:50.280 align:start position:0%
impacts all of which is is heartbreaking
 
06:37:53.750 --> 06:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
and irrelevant because cannabis is here
 
06:37:56.190 --> 06:37:56.200 align:start position:0%
the Point has been made it rolls across
 
06:37:59.430 --> 06:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
our state border every hour of every day
 
06:38:01.590 --> 06:38:01.600 align:start position:0%
every state and Province we border and
 
06:38:03.788 --> 06:38:03.798 align:start position:0%
every state and Province they border
 
06:38:06.708 --> 06:38:06.718 align:start position:0%
have authorized adult use sales and we
 
06:38:08.628 --> 06:38:08.638 align:start position:0%
are not stopping every car at the border
 
06:38:11.270 --> 06:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
and searching it it would destroy our
 
06:38:15.830 --> 06:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
economy cannabis is here and what sets
 
06:38:18.670 --> 06:38:18.680 align:start position:0%
us apart with our prohibition is that we
 
06:38:21.388 --> 06:38:21.398 align:start position:0%
are unable to mitigate those impacts
 
06:38:23.548 --> 06:38:23.558 align:start position:0%
with tax revenues that are being
 
06:38:26.030 --> 06:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
collected from from our citizens every
 
06:38:27.628 --> 06:38:27.638 align:start position:0%
purchase of cannabis out of state
 
06:38:30.030 --> 06:38:30.040 align:start position:0%
includes a tax and it goes to another
 
06:38:33.150 --> 06:38:33.160 align:start position:0%
state government to fund prohibition and
 
06:38:35.990 --> 06:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
education and treatment and Public
 
06:38:38.910 --> 06:38:38.920 align:start position:0%
Safety we are being
 
06:38:41.628 --> 06:38:41.638 align:start position:0%
Chumps and it's time to change that and
 
06:38:44.350 --> 06:38:44.360 align:start position:0%
this bill changes it a point that you
 
06:38:46.190 --> 06:38:46.200 align:start position:0%
all know but it's worth mentioning
 
06:38:48.628 --> 06:38:48.638 align:start position:0%
because no one has is that it polls by
 
06:38:50.830 --> 06:38:50.840 align:start position:0%
more than two to one in favor and if
 
06:38:52.430 --> 06:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
you're opposed that's a lot of
 
06:38:54.590 --> 06:38:54.600 align:start position:0%
constituents to be ignoring
 
06:38:56.708 --> 06:38:56.718 align:start position:0%
um it's a powerful message and one you
 
06:38:59.548 --> 06:38:59.558 align:start position:0%
should think carefully about on the
 
06:39:03.110 --> 06:39:03.120 align:start position:0%
question of an alternative model um I
 
06:39:05.548 --> 06:39:05.558 align:start position:0%
don't envy you chairman hunt uh I hope
 
06:39:07.190 --> 06:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
you find a way to get a bill done one
 
06:39:09.590 --> 06:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
way or another but I will offer this as
 
06:39:12.150 --> 06:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
food for thought I'd like to read one
 
06:39:15.150 --> 06:39:15.160 align:start position:0%
sentence to you free and Fair
 
06:39:17.388 --> 06:39:17.398 align:start position:0%
competition in the trades and industries
 
06:39:20.590 --> 06:39:20.600 align:start position:0%
is an inherent and essential right of
 
06:39:22.510 --> 06:39:22.520 align:start position:0%
the people and should be protected
 
06:39:25.270 --> 06:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
against all monopolies and conspiracies
 
06:39:27.990 --> 06:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
which tend to hinder or destroy it those
 
06:39:30.388 --> 06:39:30.398 align:start position:0%
words have been in article 83 of our
 
06:39:32.990 --> 06:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
state constitution since the year
 
06:39:35.388 --> 06:39:35.398 align:start position:0%
1784 and I can't think of a more
 
06:39:38.030 --> 06:39:38.040 align:start position:0%
authoritative or compelling statement of
 
06:39:40.270 --> 06:39:40.280 align:start position:0%
why we should adopt a competitive
 
06:39:43.310 --> 06:39:43.320 align:start position:0%
model lastly opponents of the bill will
 
06:39:45.628 --> 06:39:45.638 align:start position:0%
try to pick it apart by pointing out
 
06:39:48.230 --> 06:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
that there's an actual issue or problem
 
06:39:51.030 --> 06:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
it doesn't solve well who's ever drafted
 
06:39:53.548 --> 06:39:53.558 align:start position:0%
a perfect Bill the question is not how
 
06:39:56.590 --> 06:39:56.600 align:start position:0%
does it compare to the ideal Bill the
 
06:39:58.030 --> 06:39:58.040 align:start position:0%
question is how does it compare to the
 
06:40:00.510 --> 06:40:00.520 align:start position:0%
status quo and I think this bill is a
 
06:40:02.310 --> 06:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
vast Improvement and I think it's very
 
06:40:04.388 --> 06:40:04.398 align:start position:0%
important that lawmakers not lose sight
 
06:40:06.788 --> 06:40:06.798 align:start position:0%
of that I know it's late in the day I
 
06:40:08.030 --> 06:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for your patience and
 
06:40:09.750 --> 06:40:09.760 align:start position:0%

related Financial Services um I'm going
 
06:41:20.548 --> 06:41:20.558 align:start position:0%
to make one small um you know reference
 
06:41:21.990 --> 06:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
with regard to the commission then I'm
 
06:41:24.510 --> 06:41:24.520 align:start position:0%
going to get right to my main point um
 
06:41:27.628 --> 06:41:27.638 align:start position:0%
uh except to say that um recently I did
 
06:41:29.750 --> 06:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
complete a fair amount of study and
 
06:41:33.510 --> 06:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
research on the topic of um DWI cannabis
 
06:41:36.708 --> 06:41:36.718 align:start position:0%
related um testing both breath lizers
 
06:41:38.430 --> 06:41:38.440 align:start position:0%
and blood tests and the rest of that and
 
06:41:40.868 --> 06:41:40.878 align:start position:0%
should any um I'm not going to get into
 
06:41:42.350 --> 06:41:42.360 align:start position:0%
it now it'll take a few minutes to talk
 
06:41:44.590 --> 06:41:44.600 align:start position:0%
about but should any committee meter
 
06:41:47.430 --> 06:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
member um you know ask me about that um
 
06:41:49.310 --> 06:41:49.320 align:start position:0%
or wish to pursue that later I'll be
 
06:41:51.270 --> 06:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
more than happy to get into that but I
 
06:41:52.750 --> 06:41:52.760 align:start position:0%
could provide some expertise and
 
06:41:54.350 --> 06:41:54.360 align:start position:0%
guidance on that
 
06:41:57.070 --> 06:41:57.080 align:start position:0%
um the State Liquor Commission under the
 
06:41:59.430 --> 06:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
leadership of commissioner Joe mikica
 
06:42:01.468 --> 06:42:01.478 align:start position:0%
and his executive team have acquitted
 
06:42:04.150 --> 06:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
themselves and their standout with their
 
06:42:06.150 --> 06:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
standout professionalism energy and
 
06:42:08.310 --> 06:42:08.320 align:start position:0%
Devotion to the state's best interests
 
06:42:10.110 --> 06:42:10.120 align:start position:0%
although they knew little at first about
 
06:42:12.310 --> 06:42:12.320 align:start position:0%
the Cannabis industry over the past 18
 
06:42:14.590 --> 06:42:14.600 align:start position:0%
months they've become well informed by
 
06:42:16.548 --> 06:42:16.558 align:start position:0%
learning from stakeholders visiting
 
06:42:18.788 --> 06:42:18.798 align:start position:0%
licensed operations in other states
 
06:42:20.910 --> 06:42:20.920 align:start position:0%
studying the relevant issues and nuances
 
06:42:22.910 --> 06:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
and thoughtfully incorporating it all
 
06:42:25.110 --> 06:42:25.120 align:start position:0%
into their proposal proposals in my
 
06:42:26.868 --> 06:42:26.878 align:start position:0%
professional opinion they are already
 
06:42:28.788 --> 06:42:28.798 align:start position:0%
best qualified in collaboration with a
 
06:42:31.750 --> 06:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
well-chosen stakeholder advisory panel
 
06:42:34.468 --> 06:42:34.478 align:start position:0%
to implement regulate and supervise our
 
06:42:37.190 --> 06:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
cannabis industry they also understood
 
06:42:38.708 --> 06:42:38.718 align:start position:0%
enough to know that state employees
 
06:42:40.910 --> 06:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
cannot be required to engage in
 
06:42:42.948 --> 06:42:42.958 align:start position:0%
violations of federal law so they
 
06:42:45.510 --> 06:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
devised a workaround franchise model in
 
06:42:47.310 --> 06:42:47.320 align:start position:0%
which the commission itself would not
 
06:42:49.590 --> 06:42:49.600 align:start position:0%
actually sell cannabis but franchise
 
06:42:51.788 --> 06:42:51.798 align:start position:0%
independent operators to do so with the
 
06:42:53.788 --> 06:42:53.798 align:start position:0%
rationale that the state would then not
 
06:42:55.830 --> 06:42:55.840 align:start position:0%
be required to defend those operators
 
06:42:57.708 --> 06:42:57.718 align:start position:0%
from possible Federal enforcement
 
06:42:59.230 --> 06:42:59.240 align:start position:0%
penalties and
 
06:43:00.948 --> 06:43:00.958 align:start position:0%
consequences however I've seen
 
06:43:02.990 --> 06:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
innumerable examples of these seemingly
 
06:43:04.830 --> 06:43:04.840 align:start position:0%
clever industry workarounds over the
 
06:43:06.948 --> 06:43:06.958 align:start position:0%
years and sooner or later they have all
 
06:43:10.350 --> 06:43:10.360 align:start position:0%
collapsed usually ugly my main point and
 
06:43:12.310 --> 06:43:12.320 align:start position:0%
leaving aside everything else is that
 
06:43:14.230 --> 06:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
the current state Monopoly proposal is
 
06:43:16.350 --> 06:43:16.360 align:start position:0%
reckless and Thoughtless and effectively
 
06:43:18.788 --> 06:43:18.798 align:start position:0%
a non-starter and cannot actually be
 
06:43:21.190 --> 06:43:21.200 align:start position:0%
implemented and I therefore urge this
 
06:43:24.788 --> 06:43:24.798 align:start position:0%
committee to pass HR 1633 if it intends
 
06:43:27.868 --> 06:43:27.878 align:start position:0%
to actually enable a a viable commercial
 
06:43:31.310 --> 06:43:31.320 align:start position:0%
cannabis industry uh in New Hampshire
 
06:43:33.110 --> 06:43:33.120 align:start position:0%
with the tension between federal and
 
06:43:35.030 --> 06:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
state law the Cannabis industry is
 
06:43:37.468 --> 06:43:37.478 align:start position:0%
complicated and chaotic in many often
 
06:43:40.590 --> 06:43:40.600 align:start position:0%
unforeseen ways for example as somebody
 
06:43:43.190 --> 06:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
alluded to here earlier the commission
 
06:43:45.750 --> 06:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
as franchisor would be required to file
 
06:43:47.948 --> 06:43:47.958 align:start position:0%
what is known as a franchise discloser
 
06:43:49.270 --> 06:43:49.280 align:start position:0%
document with the Federal Trade
 
06:43:51.350 --> 06:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
Commission subjecting them to Federal
 
06:43:52.868 --> 06:43:52.878 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction penalties and
 
06:43:52.878 --> 06:43:54.150 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction penalties and
investigations

06:43:54.150 --> 06:43:54.160 align:start position:0%
investigations
 
06:43:56.910 --> 06:43:56.920 align:start position:0%
a criminal Enterprise cannot offer
 
06:44:00.070 --> 06:44:00.080 align:start position:0%
franchises of its business model please
 
06:44:02.628 --> 06:44:02.638 align:start position:0%
let that sink in contrived legal
 
06:44:04.708 --> 06:44:04.718 align:start position:0%
firewalls notwithstanding the state
 
06:44:06.468 --> 06:44:06.478 align:start position:0%
liquor commission's position would be
 
06:44:08.590 --> 06:44:08.600 align:start position:0%
precarious and could easily become
 
06:44:11.070 --> 06:44:11.080 align:start position:0%
subject to Serious anticipated and
 
06:44:13.510 --> 06:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
unanticipated legal risks and
 
06:44:15.590 --> 06:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
entanglements claiming to not be
 
06:44:17.030 --> 06:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
directly involved in the business of
 
06:44:19.388 --> 06:44:19.398 align:start position:0%
selling cannabis because one is merely a
 
06:44:22.830 --> 06:44:22.840 align:start position:0%
franchise or is as Prima fascia absurd
 
06:44:25.030 --> 06:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
as Donald's claiming it's not in the
 
06:44:26.708 --> 06:44:26.718 align:start position:0%
business of selling hamburgers because
 
06:44:27.590 --> 06:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
it has
 
06:44:30.270 --> 06:44:30.280 align:start position:0%
franchisees the primary miscalculation
 
06:44:32.510 --> 06:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
here is in not understanding the unique
 
06:44:34.310 --> 06:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
and subtle challenges of the Cannabis
 
06:44:36.868 --> 06:44:36.878 align:start position:0%
industry that has no modern equivalent
 
06:44:38.590 --> 06:44:38.600 align:start position:0%
as a result of the tension between
 
06:44:40.548 --> 06:44:40.558 align:start position:0%
states legalization and prevailing
 
06:44:42.350 --> 06:44:42.360 align:start position:0%
Federal prohibition there are
 
06:44:44.788 --> 06:44:44.798 align:start position:0%
innumerable loose ends and foreseeable
 
06:44:47.190 --> 06:44:47.200 align:start position:0%
as well as unforeseeable consequences
 
06:44:50.070 --> 06:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
that arise constantly to bevil even the
 
06:44:53.110 --> 06:44:53.120 align:start position:0%
savviest industry pioneers and insiders
 
06:44:55.510 --> 06:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
even as thoughtful in his experienced as
 
06:44:57.430 --> 06:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
I and many of my colleagues are in this
 
06:44:59.788 --> 06:44:59.798 align:start position:0%
field we are often blindsided by
 
06:45:01.910 --> 06:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
unforeseen hiccups obstacles and
 
06:45:04.030 --> 06:45:04.040 align:start position:0%
restrictions that subvert otherwise
 
06:45:06.548 --> 06:45:06.558 align:start position:0%
well-considered plans our political
 
06:45:09.150 --> 06:45:09.160 align:start position:0%
leaders are utterly ill equipped to
 
06:45:11.590 --> 06:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
enact cannabis industry policies that
 
06:45:13.948 --> 06:45:13.958 align:start position:0%
tread into such Uncharted Territory
 
06:45:16.270 --> 06:45:16.280 align:start position:0%
beyond the narrow legal path charted by
 
06:45:18.270 --> 06:45:18.280 align:start position:0%
other states that have implemented
 
06:45:20.350 --> 06:45:20.360 align:start position:0%
sustainable cannabis
 
06:45:22.670 --> 06:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
programs and to that point by the way
 
06:45:24.990 --> 06:45:25.000 align:start position:0%
regarding the proposed cannabis Advisory
 
06:45:26.830 --> 06:45:26.840 align:start position:0%
Board it would be counterproductive and
 
06:45:28.388 --> 06:45:28.398 align:start position:0%
negligent to have the governor and
 
06:45:30.910 --> 06:45:30.920 align:start position:0%
executive counsil appoint its members
 
06:45:32.708 --> 06:45:32.718 align:start position:0%
since neither have any demonstrated
 
06:45:35.670 --> 06:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
experience or expertise in identifying a
 
06:45:37.910 --> 06:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
representative cross-section of
 
06:45:40.150 --> 06:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
stakeholders um I recently had an
 
06:45:42.590 --> 06:45:42.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to chat with the governor um
 
06:45:45.388 --> 06:45:45.398 align:start position:0%
uh on this topic uh as well as uh
 
06:45:47.910 --> 06:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
cannabis Banking and some other stuff um
 
06:45:50.510 --> 06:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
and his comments were interesting um he
 
06:45:52.310 --> 06:45:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh basically told me that um it was
 
06:45:54.430 --> 06:45:54.440 align:start position:0%
going to be the state mon model or
 
06:45:57.190 --> 06:45:57.200 align:start position:0%
nothing um and I said well you can't do
 
06:46:00.990 --> 06:46:01.000 align:start position:0%
that um and he said well yes I can and I
 
06:46:03.910 --> 06:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
said no you can't and he said well um
 
06:46:05.388 --> 06:46:05.398 align:start position:0%
only one of us standing here is the
 
06:46:07.670 --> 06:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
governor and yes I can so I don't know
 
06:46:11.788 --> 06:46:11.798 align:start position:0%
if that sounds like our governor but um
 
06:46:15.430 --> 06:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
however um and and I and I do understand
 
06:46:17.230 --> 06:46:17.240 align:start position:0%
how he could think that okay because
 
06:46:18.990 --> 06:46:19.000 align:start position:0%
under ordinary circumstances that would
 
06:46:20.948 --> 06:46:20.958 align:start position:0%
be the case but let me give you a couple
 
06:46:24.628 --> 06:46:24.638 align:start position:0%
examples um the second largest uh
 
06:46:27.150 --> 06:46:27.160 align:start position:0%
payroll uh service in the United States
 
06:46:29.788 --> 06:46:29.798 align:start position:0%
is a company called paychecks uh they're
 
06:46:32.468 --> 06:46:32.478 align:start position:0%
second only to ADP and about two or
 
06:46:34.590 --> 06:46:34.600 align:start position:0%
three years ago they had a big trade
 
06:46:37.150 --> 06:46:37.160 align:start position:0%
exhibit at a cannabis uh trade show and
 
06:46:38.510 --> 06:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
they announced that they were now going
 
06:46:40.350 --> 06:46:40.360 align:start position:0%
to extend their provide their services
 
06:46:42.750 --> 06:46:42.760 align:start position:0%
to the Cannabis industry I pointed out
 
06:46:45.310 --> 06:46:45.320 align:start position:0%
to them that it was certainly doable as
 
06:46:48.948 --> 06:46:48.958 align:start position:0%
long as they followed a um clear and
 
06:46:51.708 --> 06:46:51.718 align:start position:0%
delineated path of banking compliance
 
06:46:53.830 --> 06:46:53.840 align:start position:0%
and other types of reporting that was a
 
06:46:56.510 --> 06:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
feasible thing to do but um they needed
 
06:46:58.750 --> 06:46:58.760 align:start position:0%
there was only one way to do that um and
 
06:47:00.510 --> 06:47:00.520 align:start position:0%
we actually got to the point of where we
 
06:47:02.190 --> 06:47:02.200 align:start position:0%
were in contract negotiations they were
 
06:47:03.990 --> 06:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
going to engage my company to actually
 
06:47:05.388 --> 06:47:05.398 align:start position:0%
put together the framework that would
 
06:47:07.750 --> 06:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
allow them to do it legally and
 
06:47:10.350 --> 06:47:10.360 align:start position:0%
compliantly however um you know
 
06:47:13.190 --> 06:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
institutional egos prevailed and they
 
06:47:15.030 --> 06:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
basically felt that hey you we're a big
 
06:47:17.150 --> 06:47:17.160 align:start position:0%
multi-billion dollar company and we tell
 
06:47:18.830 --> 06:47:18.840 align:start position:0%
our banks what to do and the banks don't
 
06:47:20.788 --> 06:47:20.798 align:start position:0%
tell us what to do well three or four
 
06:47:22.388 --> 06:47:22.398 align:start position:0%
months later they exited the Cannabis
 
06:47:24.350 --> 06:47:24.360 align:start position:0%
space with their tail between their legs
 
06:47:26.310 --> 06:47:26.320 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't matter how big you
 
06:47:29.510 --> 06:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
are um there this is this is a very
 
06:47:31.910 --> 06:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
tricky business and no matter how tough
 
06:47:34.430 --> 06:47:34.440 align:start position:0%
you are it's you just can't do it um the
 
06:47:36.150 --> 06:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
other quick example that I'll give you
 
06:47:38.670 --> 06:47:38.680 align:start position:0%
is in the case of MasterCard Visa who
 
06:47:41.708 --> 06:47:41.718 align:start position:0%
specifically and unequivocably prohibit
 
06:47:43.868 --> 06:47:43.878 align:start position:0%
cannabis transactions on uh their
 
06:47:46.070 --> 06:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
payment rails and there are lots of
 
06:47:48.548 --> 06:47:48.558 align:start position:0%
people who have done all kinds of uh
 
06:47:50.830 --> 06:47:50.840 align:start position:0%
workarounds uh a lot of my experience
 
06:47:52.948 --> 06:47:52.958 align:start position:0%
with those that have failed are related
 
06:47:53.868 --> 06:47:53.878 align:start position:0%
to that
 
06:47:55.388 --> 06:47:55.398 align:start position:0%
um people come up with all kinds of
 
06:47:57.948 --> 06:47:57.958 align:start position:0%
clever devices like well we'll use the
 
06:48:00.708 --> 06:48:00.718 align:start position:0%
MasterCard visa to fund a virtual gift
 
06:48:03.150 --> 06:48:03.160 align:start position:0%
card or virtual checking account or a
 
06:48:05.628 --> 06:48:05.638 align:start position:0%
PayPal style ewallet or something along
 
06:48:08.388 --> 06:48:08.398 align:start position:0%
those lines um and the problem is that
 
06:48:10.190 --> 06:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
that all works very nicely until they
 
06:48:12.310 --> 06:48:12.320 align:start position:0%
get the bad call from Visa which says
 
06:48:16.430 --> 06:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
you can't do this um and they have all
 
06:48:18.910 --> 06:48:18.920 align:start position:0%
to a man uh dozens and dozens of them
 
06:48:22.190 --> 06:48:22.200 align:start position:0%
folded like a cheap suit
 
06:48:26.830 --> 06:48:26.840 align:start position:0%
um in 2017 a federal district court in
 
06:48:30.350 --> 06:48:30.360 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts dismissed a RICO case um I
 
06:48:32.350 --> 06:48:32.360 align:start position:0%
have the citation against a bank on the
 
06:48:34.350 --> 06:48:34.360 align:start position:0%
grounds that merely providing customary
 
06:48:36.948 --> 06:48:36.958 align:start position:0%
Financial Services to a cannabis state
 
06:48:39.628 --> 06:48:39.638 align:start position:0%
license C orbe it operating in violation
 
06:48:41.750 --> 06:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
of federal law did not rise to the level
 
06:48:44.230 --> 06:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
of Direction in and control of the
 
06:48:46.670 --> 06:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
Enterprise to implicate Rico liability
 
06:48:48.910 --> 06:48:48.920 align:start position:0%
as a code defendant this reasoning
 
06:48:51.670 --> 06:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
allows States right now to regulate
 
06:48:53.708 --> 06:48:53.718 align:start position:0%
cannabis industry operators as a
 
06:48:56.070 --> 06:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
customary government function as long as
 
06:48:57.830 --> 06:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
they are not substantially involved in
 
06:48:59.868 --> 06:48:59.878 align:start position:0%
the operation and direction of the
 
06:49:02.670 --> 06:49:02.680 align:start position:0%
business itself however the franchise
 
06:49:04.788 --> 06:49:04.798 align:start position:0%
model proposed by The Liquor Commission
 
06:49:06.548 --> 06:49:06.558 align:start position:0%
envisions quite the opposite as they
 
06:49:08.628 --> 06:49:08.638 align:start position:0%
would be enforcing strict standards in
 
06:49:10.590 --> 06:49:10.600 align:start position:0%
almost every aspect of franchise
 
06:49:13.350 --> 06:49:13.360 align:start position:0%
operations directions and practices
 
06:49:15.468 --> 06:49:15.478 align:start position:0%
enacting this scheme could easily invite
 
06:49:18.190 --> 06:49:18.200 align:start position:0%
multiple Rico based private litigations
 
06:49:21.830 --> 06:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
as well as public prosecution frankly a
 
06:49:23.948 --> 06:49:23.958 align:start position:0%
hybrid State Monopoly commercial
 
06:49:25.910 --> 06:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
cannabis business model with both
 
06:49:27.990 --> 06:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
state-owned and private operators side
 
06:49:30.430 --> 06:49:30.440 align:start position:0%
by side may be a pioneering and smart
 
06:49:32.788 --> 06:49:32.798 align:start position:0%
option and perhaps should be ultimately
 
06:49:35.030 --> 06:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
given some consideration but only
 
06:49:37.510 --> 06:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
following the end of federal prohibition
 
06:49:39.670 --> 06:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
requiring state employees to violate
 
06:49:41.948 --> 06:49:41.958 align:start position:0%
current federal law is reckless and
 
06:49:44.070 --> 06:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
Thoughtless and effectively a
 
06:49:46.230 --> 06:49:46.240 align:start position:0%
non-starter meanwhile I have been in
 
06:49:47.910 --> 06:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
contact with the Department of Justice
 
06:49:49.708 --> 06:49:49.718 align:start position:0%
Office of legal policy for written
 
06:49:51.708 --> 06:49:51.718 align:start position:0%
clarification of the risk of federal
 
06:49:53.750 --> 06:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
investigation and prosecution
 
06:49:56.070 --> 06:49:56.080 align:start position:0%
that this state Monopoly framework might
 
06:49:57.990 --> 06:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
attract and hope to have something to
 
06:49:59.670 --> 06:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
submit when the Senate takes this up in
 
06:50:03.590 --> 06:50:03.600 align:start position:0%
the coming weeks I'm pausing again to
 
06:50:05.510 --> 06:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
let I just want you to know we're you've
 
06:50:08.910 --> 06:50:08.920 align:start position:0%
gone now 10 minutes okay and I have the
 
06:50:10.270 --> 06:50:10.280 align:start position:0%
rest of this last sentence and I'll be
 
06:50:12.468 --> 06:50:12.478 align:start position:0%
done okay because we have two more
 
06:50:15.190 --> 06:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
people all right and I have we have to
 
06:50:17.708 --> 06:50:17.718 align:start position:0%
be out here at five one sentence and
 
06:50:20.110 --> 06:50:20.120 align:start position:0%
this is the most important one my
 
06:50:22.230 --> 06:50:22.240 align:start position:0%
testimony here today is intended to
 
06:50:25.070 --> 06:50:25.080 align:start position:0%
serve as a formal on the record public
 
06:50:27.110 --> 06:50:27.120 align:start position:0%
notice to those who participate in
 
06:50:29.468 --> 06:50:29.478 align:start position:0%
enacting the proposed state Monopoly
 
06:50:31.590 --> 06:50:31.600 align:start position:0%
legislative time bomb that they are
 
06:50:34.070 --> 06:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
exposing themselves individually and our
 
06:50:36.388 --> 06:50:36.398 align:start position:0%
state to potentially crippling and
 
06:50:38.830 --> 06:50:38.840 align:start position:0%
multiple criminal and civil penalties up
 
06:50:41.230 --> 06:50:41.240 align:start position:0%
to and including Reco charges and the
 
06:50:43.388 --> 06:50:43.398 align:start position:0%

06:51:10.430 --> 06:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:12.830 --> 06:51:12.840 align:start position:0%
minutes you wrote two minutes I'm gonna
 
06:51:17.830 --> 06:51:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:20.468 --> 06:51:20.478 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you Mr chairman honorable
 
06:51:22.468 --> 06:51:22.478 align:start position:0%
committee good to see you all again for
 
06:51:24.948 --> 06:51:24.958 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Matt Simon I work
 
06:51:27.388 --> 06:51:27.398 align:start position:0%
for granite Leaf cannabis uh if you
 
06:51:29.030 --> 06:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
don't recognize the name of that company
 
06:51:30.628 --> 06:51:30.638 align:start position:0%
we did change our name in September
 
06:51:34.150 --> 06:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
forly Prime ATC we're still a small
 
06:51:37.190 --> 06:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
nonprofit therapeutic cannabis company
 
06:51:38.990 --> 06:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
uh with dispensaries and Chichester and
 
06:51:42.070 --> 06:51:42.080 align:start position:0%
marac focus solely on serving patients
 
06:51:45.788 --> 06:51:45.798 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire very briefly this is a
 
06:51:47.270 --> 06:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
good bill it takes the thoughtful
 
06:51:49.590 --> 06:51:49.600 align:start position:0%
approach to adult use legalization I was
 
06:51:51.590 --> 06:51:51.600 align:start position:0%
not involved in the drafting process for
 
06:51:53.548 --> 06:51:53.558 align:start position:0%
the specific bill was part of the
 
06:51:55.430 --> 06:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
Coalition that drafted the predecessor
 
06:51:57.868 --> 06:51:57.878 align:start position:0%
Bill uh last fall I was busy dealing
 
06:51:59.750 --> 06:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
with the study commission so I wasn't
 
06:52:01.830 --> 06:52:01.840 align:start position:0%
weighing in on this draft legislation
 
06:52:03.350 --> 06:52:03.360 align:start position:0%
but I'm pleased to see that it maintains
 
06:52:05.948 --> 06:52:05.958 align:start position:0%
a lot of good policies I wanted to touch
 
06:52:09.388 --> 06:52:09.398 align:start position:0%
on three of them very quickly one
 
06:52:10.590 --> 06:52:10.600 align:start position:0%
thoughtful integration of the
 
06:52:13.070 --> 06:52:13.080 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program this bill
 
06:52:14.948 --> 06:52:14.958 align:start position:0%
is one example of how to do a good job
 
06:52:16.628 --> 06:52:16.638 align:start position:0%
with that there are other ways that
 
06:52:18.110 --> 06:52:18.120 align:start position:0%
could be done if there's going to be
 
06:52:20.270 --> 06:52:20.280 align:start position:0%
another model that that is pursued but
 
06:52:22.310 --> 06:52:22.320 align:start position:0%
that is an important priority this bill
 
06:52:23.910 --> 06:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
does it well
 
06:52:26.388 --> 06:52:26.398 align:start position:0%
this bill also clearly establishes The
 
06:52:28.788 --> 06:52:28.798 align:start position:0%
Authority for the commission to regulate
 
06:52:32.788 --> 06:52:32.798 align:start position:0%
hemp derived synthetic THC products uh
 
06:52:34.788 --> 06:52:34.798 align:start position:0%
we heard that referenced by a couple
 
06:52:37.628 --> 06:52:37.638 align:start position:0%
people who spoke earlier uh those
 
06:52:39.830 --> 06:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
products are now illegal for at least
 
06:52:42.190 --> 06:52:42.200 align:start position:0%
the next year under New Hampshire law uh
 
06:52:45.030 --> 06:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
but they are still being sold uh in some
 
06:52:47.830 --> 06:52:47.840 align:start position:0%
places so if those products are going to
 
06:52:49.708 --> 06:52:49.718 align:start position:0%
be approved for sale they are inherently
 
06:52:52.270 --> 06:52:52.280 align:start position:0%
more risky than natural cannabis they
 
06:52:53.868 --> 06:52:53.878 align:start position:0%
should be sold through the same
 
06:52:56.910 --> 06:52:56.920 align:start position:0%
regulated system I would argue finally I
 
06:52:58.590 --> 06:52:58.600 align:start position:0%
love that this bill includes home
 
06:53:00.990 --> 06:53:01.000 align:start position:0%
cultivation for registered patients and
 
06:53:03.590 --> 06:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
caregivers hom grow is legal for adults
 
06:53:05.548 --> 06:53:05.558 align:start position:0%
in every New England state if we're not
 
06:53:08.030 --> 06:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
going to do that uh I believe we should
 
06:53:10.948 --> 06:53:10.958 align:start position:0%
do uh let's passed the house 10 times
 
06:53:12.948 --> 06:53:12.958 align:start position:0%
and the Senate four times which is allow
 
06:53:14.910 --> 06:53:14.920 align:start position:0%
limited home cultivation for patients
 
06:53:14.920 --> 06:53:16.548 align:start position:0%
limited home cultivation for patients
and

06:53:16.548 --> 06:53:16.558 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:53:18.830 --> 06:53:18.840 align:start position:0%
caregivers so I think those are
 
06:53:20.430 --> 06:53:20.440 align:start position:0%
important policy priorities whether it's
 
06:53:21.910 --> 06:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
this bill or some other Bill and I'm
 
06:53:23.150 --> 06:53:23.160 align:start position:0%
happy to hang out with the the sub
 
06:53:24.670 --> 06:53:24.680 align:start position:0%

did we know we were lying about drugs of
 
06:56:23.350 --> 06:56:23.360 align:start position:0%
course we we did and this was the

conscious reaction to anti-government
 
06:56:27.468 --> 06:56:27.478 align:start position:0%
anti-war organizations this stigma has
 
06:56:28.910 --> 06:56:28.920 align:start position:0%
been maintained in our society greatly
 
06:56:30.670 --> 06:56:30.680 align:start position:0%

06:56:53.030 --> 06:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire this is
 
06:56:55.468 --> 06:56:55.478 align:start position:0%
higher than the 3.64 times of the

Department of Health and Human Services

states that stigma is considered to be

the most formidable obstacle to Future

progress in the area of mental illness
 
06:57:06.230 --> 06:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
and health stigma has reduced the

utilization of healthcare resources and

medical professionals to expand and

operate within their scope of practice
 
06:57:16.150 --> 06:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
that being said by supporting a livefree
 
06:57:17.628 --> 06:57:17.638 align:start position:0%
bill the state of New Hampshire can
 
06:57:19.388 --> 06:57:19.398 align:start position:0%
leave the unscientific bias
 
06:57:21.590 --> 06:57:21.600 align:start position:0%
fear-mongering stigma behind and display
 
06:57:23.230 --> 06:57:23.240 align:start position:0%
the ethical principle of
 
06:57:25.990 --> 06:57:26.000 align:start position:0%

beneficence and Justice to its citizens
 
06:57:31.628 --> 06:57:31.638 align:start position:0%
ultimately it would allow for added
 
06:57:33.110 --> 06:57:33.120 align:start position:0%
economic growth through legal state
 
06:57:35.230 --> 06:57:35.240 align:start position:0%
sales discouraging out ofate purchases
 
06:57:36.708 --> 06:57:36.718 align:start position:0%
creating cannabis entrepreneurs and
 
06:57:38.510 --> 06:57:38.520 align:start position:0%
businesses and allowing young medical
 
06:57:40.030 --> 06:57:40.040 align:start position:0%
professionals like myself to expand our
 
06:57:41.750 --> 06:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
careers in New Hampshire or be pushed to
 
06:57:43.270 --> 06:57:43.280 align:start position:0%
relocate to another neighboring state in
 
06:57:45.070 --> 06:57:45.080 align:start position:0%
which we can openly practice cannabis
 
06:57:46.990 --> 06:57:47.000 align:start position:0%
nursing for the benefit of adult use in
 
06:57:48.830 --> 06:57:48.840 align:start position:0%
medical patients currently many medical
 
06:57:50.270 --> 06:57:50.280 align:start position:0%
patients as we've heard before travel
 
06:57:52.510 --> 06:57:52.520 align:start position:0%
outside the state and these are creating
 
06:57:54.190 --> 06:57:54.200 align:start position:0%
Al offenses as well as increase the risk
 
06:57:56.150 --> 06:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
for the illicit Market to have ADD in
 
06:57:59.110 --> 06:57:59.120 align:start position:0%
poly drugs such as fentanyl or
 
06:58:01.030 --> 06:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
Blues I have found in speaking with
 
06:58:02.230 --> 06:58:02.240 align:start position:0%
patients at the hospital fellow
 
06:58:03.430 --> 06:58:03.440 align:start position:0%
Healthcare professionals and local
 
06:58:04.628 --> 06:58:04.638 align:start position:0%
residents as I also work in the
 
06:58:06.270 --> 06:58:06.280 align:start position:0%
restaurant industry in conquered that
 
06:58:07.788 --> 06:58:07.798 align:start position:0%
the illegal status in the state is one
 
06:58:09.270 --> 06:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
of the many reasons individuals do not
 
06:58:10.590 --> 06:58:10.600 align:start position:0%
disclose the use to healthcare
 
06:58:12.110 --> 06:58:12.120 align:start position:0%
professionals this brings on risks when
 
06:58:13.948 --> 06:58:13.958 align:start position:0%
patients go under anesthesia or other
 
06:58:15.350 --> 06:58:15.360 align:start position:0%
operations whether it's planned or
 
06:58:17.150 --> 06:58:17.160 align:start position:0%
emergent and many fear the stigma
 
06:58:18.110 --> 06:58:18.120 align:start position:0%
associated with speaking with a
 
06:58:19.750 --> 06:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
healthcare provider to obtain a medical
 
06:58:21.510 --> 06:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
card by supporting this bill it would
 
06:58:22.750 --> 06:58:22.760 align:start position:0%
change the stigma associated with
 
06:58:25.030 --> 06:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
cannabis and allow for adult citizens
 
06:58:27.388 --> 06:58:27.398 align:start position:0%
again adult citizens to be open truthful
 
06:58:29.510 --> 06:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
and educated about safe cannabis use
 
06:58:31.030 --> 06:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
while retaining the promising Financial
 
06:58:32.388 --> 06:58:32.398 align:start position:0%
gains from the adult youth cannabis
 
06:58:34.788 --> 06:58:34.798 align:start position:0%
industry and that is all I have to
 
06:58:36.948 --> 06:58:36.958 align:start position:0%
say thank you very much that was very
 
06:58:39.948 --> 06:58:39.958 align:start position:0%
informative thank okay I
 
06:58:43.590 --> 06:58:43.600 align:start position:0%
