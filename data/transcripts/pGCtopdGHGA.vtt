these amendments
 
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
one of the particularly one of the
 
00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
members was silent
 
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:37.590 align:start position:0%
members was silent
who

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:37.600 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
throughout that work session that has
 
00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:41.919 align:start position:0%
proposed some of these amendments
 
00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:43.759 align:start position:0%
this is not the way this committee has
 
00:06:45.189 --> 00:06:45.199 align:start position:0%
worked in the past this is the first
 
00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
time in nine years
 
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
that i have seen some of these
 
00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.590 align:start position:0%
that i have seen some of these
regressive

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:49.600 align:start position:0%
regressive
 
00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:51.919 align:start position:0%
amendments come forth in the 11th hour
 
00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:54.080 align:start position:0%
of our deliberations
 
00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:56.720 align:start position:0%
this is not a transparent process
 
00:06:58.309 --> 00:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
this is not a way that we should do
 
00:06:58.319 --> 00:06:59.270 align:start position:0%
this is not a way that we should do
business

00:06:59.270 --> 00:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:00.800 align:start position:0%
and i object
 
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
to the process that is going forth today
 
00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
on these particular bills that are
 
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.230 align:start position:0%
on these particular bills that are
controversial

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
controversial
 
00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
and i would hope that in the future this
 
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:12.560 align:start position:0%
committee would be more prudent as it
 
00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
looks at the work that we need to do we
 
00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:16.479 align:start position:0%
have not done this in the past rick and
 
00:07:18.469 --> 00:07:18.479 align:start position:0%
you know this
 
00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
representative luna for example
 
00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
has forwarded to you
 
00:07:24.309 --> 00:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
the amendments that he is considering
 
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
ask for your approval on those prior to
 
00:07:29.189 --> 00:07:29.199 align:start position:0%
his sending these out to the committees
 
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:30.800 align:start position:0%
many of these bills that we are now
 
00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
considering these amendments that we
 
00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:34.720 align:start position:0%
were considering came into the 11th hour
 
00:07:37.589 --> 00:07:37.599 align:start position:0%
without any notice to us and i object to
 
00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
that process because that's not the way
 
00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
this committee has done work
 
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much represent my own um
 
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
we at our last hearing or last time we
 
00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:48.560 align:start position:0%
were here together on the zoom we
 
00:07:50.309 --> 00:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
discussed the fact that we were
 
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
encouraging people to put
 
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
amendments in
 
00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
and that we ask that all those
 
00:07:58.230 --> 00:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
amendments be forwarded two folks prior
 
00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:00.560 align:start position:0%
to this exact session today i believe
 
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
that was done
 
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
so with that we're going to go ahead
 
00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
with our meeting today
 
00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
and the first thing i want to do is look
 
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
at the two bills which we've had
 
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
submitted to us from the senate the to
 
00:08:14.309 --> 00:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
concur or not concur i'd like to get
 
00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:16.160 align:start position:0%
that out of the way here so we can then
 
00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
get these down to the clerk's office
 
00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
i sent information out on this to folks
 
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh yesterday
 
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:27.680 align:start position:0%
you've also can notice that uh the bills
 
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
which are coming to us from the senate
 
00:08:31.749 --> 00:08:31.759 align:start position:0%
as they've been amended appears in our
 
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
calendar they've been in the calendar
 
00:08:35.829 --> 00:08:35.839 align:start position:0%
for the last several weeks
 
00:08:38.709 --> 00:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
so the first bill we will take up is the
 
00:08:41.509 --> 00:08:41.519 align:start position:0%
lesser number hb 320
 
00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
uh this is a bill requiring a civics
 
00:08:46.389 --> 00:08:46.399 align:start position:0%
competency assessment as a high school
 
00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:48.320 align:start position:0%
graduation requirement
 
00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
uh what this does it changes one portion
 
00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
of that bill it changes the effective
 
00:08:57.509 --> 00:08:57.519 align:start position:0%
date from 60 days following passage to
 
00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:58.680 align:start position:0%
july 1
 
00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.230 align:start position:0%
july 1
2023

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
2023
 
00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
this remembers if we're not going to
 
00:09:04.389 --> 00:09:04.399 align:start position:0%
have a long debate on this it's where
 
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
you just provide the chair here your
 
00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
position on that bill whether you feel
 
00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
that we should concur with the
 
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
recommendations coming to us
 
00:09:17.269 --> 00:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
whether we're not to concur with that
 
00:09:17.279 --> 00:09:18.949 align:start position:0%
whether we're not to concur with that
recommendation

00:09:18.949 --> 00:09:18.959 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
or number three we're going to concur
 
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
but we see that the bill could be or
 
00:09:25.269 --> 00:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
that amendment and we could work on that
 
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
and come out by the positive
 
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
recommendation so that would be
 
00:09:31.509 --> 00:09:31.519 align:start position:0%
non-concur and recommend a committee of
 
00:09:31.519 --> 00:09:33.030 align:start position:0%
non-concur and recommend a committee of
conference

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
conference
 
00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
so um i'd like to just take a poll of
 
00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:38.720 align:start position:0%
the committee members to find out where
 
00:09:40.389 --> 00:09:40.399 align:start position:0%
we are on this
 
00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
um representative moffat seeing that you
 
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
are the prime sponsor of that bill
 
00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:48.240 align:start position:0%
um do you have any feeling on that
 
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair i would simply
 
00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:52.160 align:start position:0%
concur with the amendment that the
 
00:09:58.630 --> 00:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
the uh the prime sponsor bill has said
 
00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
that now we have as a committee have
 
00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
also passed this bill obviously
 
00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
is there
 
00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
any opposition to what has been
 
00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
suggested by uh representative often
 
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any hands up or
 
00:10:21.509 --> 00:10:21.519 align:start position:0%
waiving or anything like that so that's
 
00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
without a mark down concur with the
 
00:10:26.069 --> 00:10:26.079 align:start position:0%
senate on that bill let's go to the next
 
00:10:26.079 --> 00:10:28.310 align:start position:0%
senate on that bill let's go to the next
bill

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:34.069 --> 00:10:34.079 align:start position:0%
uh this bill is relative to offenses
 
00:10:38.069 --> 00:10:38.079 align:start position:0%
that prevent employment in a school
 
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
and the changes that i see and
 
00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
i did it briefly the other day a couple
 
00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
days back so um
 
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
i believe that what it does it
 
00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
changes uh one portion where we have
 
00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor to felony
 
00:10:57.269 --> 00:10:57.279 align:start position:0%
that was in
 
00:11:00.389 --> 00:11:00.399 align:start position:0%
part one section one of the of the bill
 
00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:02.720 align:start position:0%
the other portions that i see it's
 
00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:03.670 align:start position:0%
the other portions that i see it's
adding

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
adding
 
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:06.160 align:start position:0%
uh for charter public schools
 
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
uh the proposed charter school
 
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
application shall be presented for
 
00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:11.200 align:start position:0%
approval directly to the state board of
 
00:11:13.269 --> 00:11:13.279 align:start position:0%
education by the absence for the
 
00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
prospective charter public school the
 
00:11:17.269 --> 00:11:17.279 align:start position:0%
content of such application shall
 
00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
conform to the requirements set forth in
 
00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
rsa which i just mentioned the felony
 
00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
and that adds in a component underneath
 
00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
rsa 194b roman 2
 
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
uh double e
 
00:11:33.269 --> 00:11:33.279 align:start position:0%
uh you can see that on the back side and
 
00:11:35.829 --> 00:11:35.839 align:start position:0%
so it's just putting that uh statutory
 
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
requirement or where it could be such
 
00:11:40.949 --> 00:11:40.959 align:start position:0%
punish policy may also include language
 
00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:42.720 align:start position:0%
stating that any person has been
 
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
convicted of any
 
00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:46.720 align:start position:0%
rehab uh
 
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor it's now been upgraded to a
 
00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:51.680 align:start position:0%
felony or any of our list of felonies
 
00:11:54.829 --> 00:11:54.839 align:start position:0%
shall not be hired
 
00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
comments represent how do you feel about
 
00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.150 align:start position:0%
comments represent how do you feel about
that

00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
uh well i'm the prime sponsor on that
 
00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:01.110 align:start position:0%

bill

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
representative vlad so i do appreciate
 
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
point of order to speak
 
00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:08.870 align:start position:0%
point of order to speak
um

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
432 in its original form as this
 
00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
committee knows uh went through
 
00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:17.200 align:start position:0%
relatively easily as a request from the
 
00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
department of education to include human
 
00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
trafficking to the list of 189 offenses
 
00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
we currently we commonly call them
 
00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
section 5 offenses
 
00:12:30.069 --> 00:12:30.079 align:start position:0%
that would prohibit somebody from being
 
00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
credentialed in new hampshire to teach
 
00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
i don't think any of us had an objection
 
00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
to that it went through easily
 
00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
when the bill went to the senate i
 
00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
presented as prime sponsor and uh there
 
00:12:47.269 --> 00:12:47.279 align:start position:0%
was discussion
 
00:12:50.069 --> 00:12:50.079 align:start position:0%
regarding senate bill 81 which was
 
00:12:52.389 --> 00:12:52.399 align:start position:0%
senator ruth ward's bill
 
00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
that included the section on charter
 
00:12:58.069 --> 00:12:58.079 align:start position:0%

senator khan

that

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
he agreed with senator ward
 
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
and felt that if
 
00:13:19.509 --> 00:13:19.519 align:start position:0%
people were amenable they would amend
 
00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:22.720 align:start position:0%

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:25.200 align:start position:0%

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
employed public school teachers
 
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:31.040 align:start position:0%

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
conduct and ethics
 
00:13:36.069 --> 00:13:36.079 align:start position:0%
uh were a couple of different places
 
00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
where that had to be referenced as you
 
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned as ee
 
00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:44.720 align:start position:0%
i have absolutely no problem with uh
 
00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
charter school teachers
 
00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
being held to the
 
00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
ethical and conduct standards of our
 
00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
traditional public school teachers and i
 
00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
would ask that people uh concur with
 
00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:58.870 align:start position:0%
would ask that people uh concur with
this

00:13:58.870 --> 00:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
is there any objection to what
 
00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
is uh suggesting
 
00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
i don't see any hands up from ceremony i
 
00:14:07.189 --> 00:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
think we're good to go with it so we
 
00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
will concur
 
00:14:09.829 --> 00:14:09.839 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
amendments made by the
 
00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
by the senate and i concur and agree
 
00:14:16.949 --> 00:14:16.959 align:start position:0%
that all teachers need to be held to
 
00:14:20.069 --> 00:14:20.079 align:start position:0%
this level of expectation
 
00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
and conduct
 
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
and that's why we spent many years with
 
00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
this particular instrument the code of
 
00:14:28.389 --> 00:14:28.399 align:start position:0%
conduct and professional behavior
 
00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much that so we have
 
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:38.560 align:start position:0%

00:18:39.029 --> 00:18:39.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:40.320 align:start position:0%

okay so um we have a
 
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
1901 vote obviously then you are
 
00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:54.320 align:start position:0%
suggesting that it not go on the consent
 
00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
detectives that what you're saying
 
00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
represent lino correct i'm suggesting
 
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:00.640 align:start position:0%
that only because i want to do a
 
00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
minority uh report on the minority

reason why
 
00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:08.240 align:start position:0%
uh an itl is um
 
00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
uh is warranted which i think is
 
00:19:13.029 --> 00:19:13.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:14.640 align:start position:0%

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
so we'll move ahead we'll put that on
 
00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:18.640 align:start position:0%
the regular calendar
 
00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
not on the consent it's 1911.
 
00:19:23.909 --> 00:19:23.919 align:start position:0%

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
we would have to have two different
 
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:26.950 align:start position:0%
we would have to have two different
um

00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
two different motions i believe you can
 
00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.789 align:start position:0%
two different motions i believe you can
include

00:19:30.789 --> 00:19:30.799 align:start position:0%
include
 
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
both reasonings within the same
 
00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:34.720 align:start position:0%
report but i don't believe we can have
 
00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:36.320 align:start position:0%
two reports
 
00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
with the same motion
 
00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
so so point of order on that
 
00:19:44.549 --> 00:19:44.559 align:start position:0%
i thought often times there was uh there
 
00:19:44.559 --> 00:19:45.350 align:start position:0%
i thought often times there was uh there
was

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
otpa motions
 
00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
yeah if you have an amendment yeah
 
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
see i've never heard this either before
 
00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
when we've had a 20 to 00 minutes 19 to
 
00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.110 align:start position:0%
when we've had a 20 to 00 minutes 19 to
1.

00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
1.
 
00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:58.390 align:start position:0%
1.
and

00:19:58.390 --> 00:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:19:59.909 --> 00:19:59.919 align:start position:0%
i mean there would have to be an
 
00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
alternate motion
 
00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:02.710 align:start position:0%
alternate motion
right

00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
on an itl right whenever we do up the
 
00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:07.280 align:start position:0%
report we have to say what our
 
00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
alternative motion is
 
00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
let's see
 
00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:18.150 align:start position:0%
let's see
um

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:18.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:20.210 align:start position:0%
i mean i'm
 
00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:23.669 align:start position:0%
i mean i'm
[Music]

00:20:23.669 --> 00:20:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
i mean really rick all i'm trying to do
 
00:20:28.149 --> 00:20:28.159 align:start position:0%
is um is express
 
00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:30.320 align:start position:0%
the um the the
 
00:20:33.029 --> 00:20:33.039 align:start position:0%
the house democratic caucus position
 
00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
on on the reason why we do not believe
 
00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
uh signum university should be granted
 
00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
degree granting authority
 
00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.029 align:start position:0%
degree granting authority
um

00:20:43.029 --> 00:20:43.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:45.029 --> 00:20:45.039 align:start position:0%
represent luna i think you thoroughly
 
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
did that when we had a discussion of
 
00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
that when it hit the house floor
 
00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:50.549 align:start position:0%
that when it hit the house floor
um

00:20:50.549 --> 00:20:50.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
previously when we had the previous bill
 
00:20:57.669 --> 00:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
that dealt with the same same issue
 
00:20:59.510 --> 00:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
what was it hp
 
00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:00.950 align:start position:0%
what was it hp
5

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
5
 
00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
one three
 
00:21:05.669 --> 00:21:05.679 align:start position:0%
if it's palatable to the committee the
 
00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
multiple reasons for voting itl could be
 
00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
incorporated into one report
 
00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
but that's up to the writer
 
00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
of of the committee report i'd be okay
 
00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:18.320 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
and if so i would change my vote back to
 
00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:21.750 align:start position:0%
and if so i would change my vote back to
um

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
yes on the itl and uh and and okay with
 
00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:26.710 align:start position:0%
yes on the itl and uh and and okay with
consent

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
consent
 
00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
representative should be the writer of
 
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
that report are you as general forces
 
00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
compatible to
 
00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
by incorporating some language uh
 
00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
the language that was expressed
 
00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
you ditto what i had said
 
00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
yeah all i was going to report was this
 
00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:50.149 --> 00:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
what do you guys think
 
00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
i i think the motion is you know that
 
00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
the it's an ought to pass basic motion
 
00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:56.630 align:start position:0%
the it's an ought to pass basic motion
so

00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:21:58.470 --> 00:21:58.480 align:start position:0%
i don't understand why we're writing in
 
00:22:01.669 --> 00:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
two motions within one report
 
00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
especially since this is already an
 
00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
enrolled bill i don't know i'm not not
 
00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
saying you need to do two motions in the
 
00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
report but uh but to express the the
 
00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
committee's rationale for the itl i
 
00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
don't think is as simple as as um
 
00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:22.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
it could say something like some members
 
00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:27.200 align:start position:0%
of the committee felt x and some members
 
00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
agreed with the committee recommendation
 
00:22:34.149 --> 00:22:34.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
i've never done this before
 
00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
miss before and i'm not really uh
 
00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
we we had a vote which was supported
 
00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh being
 
00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:53.110 align:start position:0%
uh being
itl

00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
i'm basically including a minority
 
00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
report within
 
00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
i agree my itl report and that's here
 
00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to support that
 
00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to tell the person to make
 
00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
the motion how to write that report
 
00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
could it be pulled from the consent
 
00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
calendar and then somebody speak to it
 
00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what can happen that can
 
00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
always be done that can be done i think
 
00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:19.360 align:start position:0%
that's the option for representing luna
 
00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
as the vote
 
00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
can be pulled
 
00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:24.320 align:start position:0%
and he can
 
00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:27.200 align:start position:0%
express his uh
 
00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
his concern
 
00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
mr chair could could uh
 
00:23:34.549 --> 00:23:34.559 align:start position:0%
an interim study be an alternate
 
00:23:34.559 --> 00:23:39.270 align:start position:0%
an interim study be an alternate
motion

00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
we have an identical bill
 
00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:45.280 align:start position:0%
which has been passed by the house
 
00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:47.039 align:start position:0%
passed by the senate
 
00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
and now it's enrolled so it's on its way
 
00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:53.700 align:start position:0%
also in previous years
 
00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:55.590 align:start position:0%
also in previous years
[Music]

00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:56.870 align:start position:0%
[Music]
university

00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
university
 
00:23:59.110 --> 00:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
so i'm not saying he's i'm not speaking
 
00:24:00.789 --> 00:24:00.799 align:start position:0%
for him right now because i have spoken
 
00:24:06.149 --> 00:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
to him on uh on uh 513 specifically
 
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:24:11.669 --> 00:24:11.679 align:start position:0%
represent porter you have your hand up
 
00:24:12.789 --> 00:24:12.799 align:start position:0%
i do
 
00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
i i don't consent to putting it on
 
00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:21.350 align:start position:0%
i i don't consent to putting it on
consent

00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
okay so we can we can put on the regular
 
00:24:25.269 --> 00:24:25.279 align:start position:0%
calendar uh
 
00:24:25.279 --> 00:24:27.830 align:start position:0%
calendar uh
19-1

00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
19-1
 
00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
you also then represent porters as
 
00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:32.480 align:start position:0%
voting in the negative
 
00:24:34.789 --> 00:24:34.799 align:start position:0%
are in the positive
 
00:24:34.799 --> 00:24:36.070 align:start position:0%
are in the positive
see

00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not i'm not changing my vote
 
00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
but if it goes on the consent calendar
 
00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
and then needs to be pulled from the
 
00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
consent calendar
 
00:24:46.549 --> 00:24:46.559 align:start position:0%
it will be at the end of a long session
 
00:24:46.559 --> 00:24:47.590 align:start position:0%
it will be at the end of a long session
day

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
day
 
00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't go on consent it will come
 
00:24:51.909 --> 00:24:51.919 align:start position:0%
up in the usual time and i'm requesting
 
00:24:53.909 --> 00:24:53.919 align:start position:0%
that it come up in the usual time in
 
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
if i'm not able to do a it sounds like
 
00:25:14.789 --> 00:25:14.799 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to be able to do
 
00:25:14.799 --> 00:25:16.310 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to be able to do
a

00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
minority report is that correct
 
00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
00:25:22.789 --> 00:25:22.799 align:start position:0%
in in that case
 
00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
then i'll stick with my itl
 
00:25:27.669 --> 00:25:27.679 align:start position:0%
but i agree with representative porter
 
00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
okay so it's are you changing flipping
 
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
the tools back because we have if i'm
 
00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
not able to write a if you're not going
 
00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:44.720 align:start position:0%
to let me write a minority report on it
 
00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
then and and we didn't have an
 
00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity to offer an alternative
 
00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
motion because the itl motion was taken
 
00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:52.390 align:start position:0%
motion because the itl motion was taken
first

00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
then um
 
00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
um i'm not sure what other alternative i
 
00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:58.710 align:start position:0%
um i'm not sure what other alternative i
have

00:25:58.710 --> 00:25:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:01.909 --> 00:26:01.919 align:start position:0%
so we'll put this bill on a 20-0
 
00:26:01.919 --> 00:26:03.110 align:start position:0%
so we'll put this bill on a 20-0
vote

00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
vote
 
00:26:06.549 --> 00:26:06.559 align:start position:0%
on the regular calendar
 
00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
i mean if you have another motion
 
00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
no there's one emotion that's going to
 
00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
come out and you've already me
 
00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
but i mean
 
00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
at least if you did the one he has to
 
00:26:20.149 --> 00:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
list what his other motion would be but
 
00:26:21.909 --> 00:26:21.919 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have another motion that's
 
00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
why we're not having it right before
 
00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:25.830 align:start position:0%
why we're not having it right before
right

00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
it's there's no majority
 
00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
is your hand's still up or are you just
 
00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
so we put that
 
00:26:38.149 --> 00:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
represent shaw you're reporting this now
 
00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
as uh 20 to 1 0
 
00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:42.950 align:start position:0%
as uh 20 to 1 0
yes

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
okay and it will be
 
00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:56.149 --> 00:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
okay uh with that we're going to move to
 
00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
the next bill which i'm going to discuss
 
00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
and that's sb 135 and i want to
 
00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:04.400 align:start position:0%
represent for a motion
 
00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
well i'm sure mr chair on uh sv135 i'd
 
00:27:09.909 --> 00:27:09.919 align:start position:0%
like to make the motion to retain this
 
00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
00:27:14.789 --> 00:27:14.799 align:start position:0%
represent leon you seconded it so we
 
00:27:14.799 --> 00:27:15.669 align:start position:0%
represent leon you seconded it so we
have

00:27:15.669 --> 00:27:15.679 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
uh emotions on the table to retain 135
 
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
made by
 
00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
representative moffatt and second by
 
00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
we're open to discussion we will turn to
 
00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
the maker do you care to speak on that
 
00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:33.430 align:start position:0%
the maker do you care to speak on that
representative

00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
sure mr twisted chair there's a lot to
 
00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
this and i know others
 
00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
i'm sure we'll have some um some
 
00:27:41.669 --> 00:27:41.679 align:start position:0%
comments i simply want to say that some
 
00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
elements and some issues brought up in
 
00:27:46.789 --> 00:27:46.799 align:start position:0%
sb 135 were now already
 
00:27:49.909 --> 00:27:49.919 align:start position:0%
covered and addressed in other measures
 
00:27:51.669 --> 00:27:51.679 align:start position:0%
which means that that
 
00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
this bill is currently structured could
 
00:27:57.269 --> 00:27:57.279 align:start position:0%
create some um some redundancy and maybe
 
00:27:58.870 --> 00:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
some confusion
 
00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
so retention is the best option at this
 
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
time in my view
 
00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
russ and leon i agree with that analysis
 
00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
this was already incorporated
 
00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
and so it makes the most sense to retain
 
00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:11.909 align:start position:0%
and so it makes the most sense to retain
this

00:28:11.909 --> 00:28:11.919 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:14.320 align:start position:0%
okay it's open to further discussion
 
00:28:17.029 --> 00:28:17.039 align:start position:0%
represent porter
 
00:28:19.029 --> 00:28:19.039 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i'm
 
00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:21.440 align:start position:0%
again this is ignorance from the topic
 
00:28:23.909 --> 00:28:23.919 align:start position:0%
however it seems to me that this bill is
 
00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
very important to school districts right
 
00:28:29.029 --> 00:28:29.039 align:start position:0%
now i know that my school district has
 
00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
sent a letter of support for this bill
 
00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:34.240 align:start position:0%
passage um
 
00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:35.269 align:start position:0%
passage um
when

00:28:35.269 --> 00:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
it was heard in the senate
 
00:28:40.549 --> 00:28:40.559 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm concerned if it's retained by
 
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
the time it gets worked on some
 
00:28:44.389 --> 00:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
districts might be in a real crisis
 
00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:46.480 align:start position:0%
situation and i'm wondering if you can
 
00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:53.669 --> 00:28:53.679 align:start position:0%
for the discussion on that
 
00:28:57.269 --> 00:28:57.279 align:start position:0%
great mrexcel leon thank you mr chair i
 
00:28:59.190 --> 00:28:59.200 align:start position:0%
actually was reached out to by the chair
 
00:29:01.269 --> 00:29:01.279 align:start position:0%
of my school board as well about this
 
00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
bill and discussing it and looking at
 
00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
the language in the budget the chair of
 
00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
the dairy school board was was
 
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the budget language um
 
00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
and i believe that this is already
 
00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:12.630 align:start position:0%
and i believe that this is already
addressed

00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:12.640 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:14.240 align:start position:0%
so it makes more sense to retain it
 
00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:16.640 align:start position:0%
rather than killing the body
 
00:29:20.389 --> 00:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
and in addition we have retained hb 608
 
00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
which is an advocacy funding bill
 
00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:23.990 align:start position:0%
which is an advocacy funding bill
and

00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
and we have uh
 
00:29:30.149 --> 00:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
taken the position that that this uh
 
00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
whole process of the funding formula
 
00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
which was studying for the last year and
 
00:29:35.669 --> 00:29:35.679 align:start position:0%
a half or so
 
00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
and um at 608 which i accepted your
 
00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:40.710 align:start position:0%
and um at 608 which i accepted your
argument

00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:40.720 align:start position:0%
argument
 
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:48.389 --> 00:29:48.399 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
so that we will uh by emotional retain
 
00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
we have some amending language uh that
 
00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:55.830 align:start position:0%
we have some amending language uh that
is

00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:29:58.630 --> 00:29:58.640 align:start position:0%
language which we should be aware of and
 
00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
go through the hearing process
 
00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:01.830 align:start position:0%
go through the hearing process
um

00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
that will help us deal with 608 and that
 
00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
funding formula
 
00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
and there is a difference in how we
 
00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
perceive this still within within the
 
00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:13.190 align:start position:0%
perceive this still within within the
house

00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:30:17.669 --> 00:30:17.679 align:start position:0%
we did pass 242 and that is a different
 
00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
perspective although it does have many
 
00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
similar components of the costing of an
 
00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
adequate education
 
00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
00:30:27.669 --> 00:30:27.679 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
life has to have your hand up yeah i do
 
00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:32.720 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to very much thank
 
00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
representative luno for
 
00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:36.710 align:start position:0%
representative luno for
the

00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:37.990 align:start position:0%
the
information

00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
the charts and whatever that you made i
 
00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
find them very useful and i really
 
00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
appreciate your work in doing that
 
00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
as we digest this
 
00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:52.240 align:start position:0%
this will be very useful in trying to
 
00:30:54.389 --> 00:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
figure this out
 
00:30:57.990 --> 00:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
in the future it's good good information
 
00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:58.950 align:start position:0%
in the future it's good good information
and

00:30:58.950 --> 00:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to reiterate yes i know we
 
00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
need to take care of our school
 
00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:04.710 align:start position:0%
need to take care of our school
districts

00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:04.720 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
but that's what sb2 does so
 
00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:10.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
further discussion represent luna
 
00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair so um first
 
00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
of all i i don't have any information
 
00:31:21.029 --> 00:31:21.039 align:start position:0%
that says uh house bill 2 is going to
 
00:31:24.789 --> 00:31:24.799 align:start position:0%
take care of um of districts and the um
 
00:31:27.269 --> 00:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
particularly for fy 22
 
00:31:27.279 --> 00:31:28.470 align:start position:0%
particularly for fy 22
and

00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
house bill 2 is passed by the house
 
00:31:33.909 --> 00:31:33.919 align:start position:0%
does provide some um
 
00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
it eliminates some
 
00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:37.590 align:start position:0%
it eliminates some
of

00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:31:40.549 --> 00:31:40.559 align:start position:0%
100 million dollars of
 
00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
statewide education property tax in fy
 
00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
23 but but doesn't provide um
 
00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
relief in fy 22 as a result of pandemic
 
00:31:54.389 --> 00:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
related enrollment uh
 
00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
changes that that occurred during the
 
00:31:59.190 --> 00:31:59.200 align:start position:0%
school year that we're finishing uh
 
00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
right now and um
 
00:32:05.269 --> 00:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
um and you know in specif specifically
 
00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
that uh pro it's over 45 million dollars
 
00:32:11.509 --> 00:32:11.519 align:start position:0%
um uh affects some uh districts all
 
00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
across the state who um who are not in
 
00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
fact going to be seeing such a dramatic
 
00:32:20.389 --> 00:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
uh drop in enrollment
 
00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:23.039 align:start position:0%
and um and would
 
00:32:25.029 --> 00:32:25.039 align:start position:0%
uh would in fact have to bear those
 
00:32:27.269 --> 00:32:27.279 align:start position:0%
costs on the on the local property
 
00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:29.440 align:start position:0%
taxpayers so that's that's right out of
 
00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
the gun
 
00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
a uh a 45 million dollar property tax
 
00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
hike uh for everybody what hb2 does uh
 
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
specifically and i want to um i want to
 
00:32:43.909 --> 00:32:43.919 align:start position:0%
be really clear on this um is this
 
00:32:43.919 --> 00:32:45.430 align:start position:0%
be really clear on this um is this
provides

00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
provides
 
00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:46.470 align:start position:0%
provides
um

00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:46.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
it does reduce the statewide education
 
00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:51.200 align:start position:0%
property tax by 100 million dollars and
 
00:32:53.669 --> 00:32:53.679 align:start position:0%
then it directs an additional it's over
 
00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
17 million dollars to the wealthiest
 
00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:57.990 align:start position:0%
17 million dollars to the wealthiest
community

00:32:57.990 --> 00:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:32:59.269 --> 00:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
the wealthiest
 
00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
property wise communities across the
 
00:33:05.269 --> 00:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
state so what you'd see in in house bill
 
00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:08.480 align:start position:0%
2 as passed by the the republican uh
 
00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:09.430 align:start position:0%
2 as passed by the the republican uh
house

00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:09.440 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
is you'd see the ad the average or the
 
00:33:14.389 --> 00:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
median property in fact the the biggest
 
00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:16.880 align:start position:0%
um tax cut goes to residents of
 
00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
newcastle which who would see an average
 
00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:21.440 align:start position:0%
or at least for the median property in
 
00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
newcastle over a one thousand dollar
 
00:33:27.269 --> 00:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
reduction in um in property taxes
 
00:33:30.149 --> 00:33:30.159 align:start position:0%
uh going down the list the number two
 
00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
would be rye
 
00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:33.200 align:start position:0%
and then hale's location and then
 
00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
newington and portsmouth and new london
 
00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
moultonborough's in there waterville
 
00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
valleys um
 
00:33:42.789 --> 00:33:42.799 align:start position:0%
in the in the top page and at the very
 
00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:47.200 align:start position:0%
bottom um you're gonna see um towns like
 
00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:48.630 align:start position:0%
bottom um you're gonna see um towns like
um

00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:48.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:05.669 --> 00:34:05.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:05.679 --> 00:34:06.389 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:34:06.389 --> 00:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
and again only only seeing you know a
 
00:34:12.869 --> 00:34:12.879 align:start position:0%
paltry 50 cent relief on the tax bill in
 
00:34:16.869 --> 00:34:16.879 align:start position:0%
fy 23 only um i'm prepared to offer
 
00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
amendments that uh that that go the
 
00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:23.919 align:start position:0%
other way entirely and um and would use
 
00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:26.240 align:start position:0%
that 100 million dollars that um that
 
00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
republicans put into the the hb2
 
00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
uh again that benefit the
 
00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:34.399 align:start position:0%
property wealthiest communities across
 
00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:34:38.869 --> 00:34:38.879 align:start position:0%
and direct that on a need-based
 
00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
formula much like we did in house bill
 
00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:42.310 align:start position:0%
formula much like we did in house bill
709

00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
709
 
00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
from two years ago and it would not just
 
00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
affect fy23
 
00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
but it would affect fy 22
 
00:34:52.629 --> 00:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
the coming school year as well as fy23
 
00:34:55.669 --> 00:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
and um and and in fact
 
00:34:58.230 --> 00:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
you know based on the formula you know
 
00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
um looking at at
 
00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
where this st where the state money
 
00:35:05.829 --> 00:35:05.839 align:start position:0%
would be directed you'd actually see um
 
00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
berlin seeing an fy22 it would the tax
 
00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
reduction would begin in fy 22 and
 
00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:14.240 align:start position:0%
obviously be and it would be there in fy
 
00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
23 of almost four dollars per thousand
 
00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh result resulting in a um and a
 
00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
property tax reduction of over 250
 
00:35:25.349 --> 00:35:25.359 align:start position:0%
dollars on the median price home in
 
00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
berlin um so they're at the top of the
 
00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
list immediately followed by lisbon with
 
00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
almost a 500
 
00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
um tax reduction on the median priced
 
00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
home claremont with over 400 reduction
 
00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
on a median priced home charlestown with
 
00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
almost a four over
 
00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
380 reduction on the median priced home
 
00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
um in fact pittsfield's in the top 10
 
00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
with nearly a 500 reduction on the
 
00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:56.720 align:start position:0%
median priced home of 150 000
 
00:35:59.750 --> 00:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
potential tax rate uh reduction of three
 
00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
almost three dollars per thousand 299
 
00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:04.720 align:start position:0%
uh yielding a um
 
00:36:07.349 --> 00:36:07.359 align:start position:0%
a reduction in real and property taxes
 
00:36:07.359 --> 00:36:08.390 align:start position:0%
a reduction in real and property taxes
paid

00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
paid
 
00:36:09.829 --> 00:36:09.839 align:start position:0%
in pittsfield
 
00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
by by almost 450 dollars you know i
 
00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
could keep going on winchester newport
 
00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
penacook allenstown brookline boston uh
 
00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
northfield haverhill there's haverhill
 
00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
right there with over 200
 
00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
um reduction in um and property taxes
 
00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:28.640 align:start position:0%
paid on the median priced home so you
 
00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
know we're sticking with with hb2
 
00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
um uh haverhill would see a actually
 
00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
they do see something they get a 62
 
00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
reduction in fy 23 on the median priced
 
00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
home as opposed to
 
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
um what i said the 200 reduction both in
 
00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
fy 22 and fy23 so they'd save over 400
 
00:36:54.069 --> 00:36:54.079 align:start position:0%
over the two years as opposed to 62
 
00:36:58.310 --> 00:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
dollars just in fy 23. so i mean
 
00:36:59.750 --> 00:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
you know one of the things that came out
 
00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
of the school funding commission work
 
00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
rick and you were there for this
 
00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
um is is let's use state money where
 
00:37:09.589 --> 00:37:09.599 align:start position:0%
it's needed most and and i just don't
 
00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:12.880 align:start position:0%
see that in in in house bill 2. it's
 
00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
completely opposite that
 
00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
and um and it's it's it's egregious and
 
00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
and for people that profess to be
 
00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:22.880 align:start position:0%
you know people that are again against
 
00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
government waste
 
00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
come on i mean house bill 2 is
 
00:37:30.310 --> 00:37:30.320 align:start position:0%
the the particularly the way the way
 
00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
school funding is being done and and and
 
00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
and um and and you know sweetheart tax
 
00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
breaks are being cut it's all about
 
00:37:41.589 --> 00:37:41.599 align:start position:0%
government waste it's directing state
 
00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
funds to where they're not needed and
 
00:37:45.829 --> 00:37:45.839 align:start position:0%
the amendments that that i talked about
 
00:37:48.069 --> 00:37:48.079 align:start position:0%
last week i talked about during the
 
00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
hearing are all about directing our
 
00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:52.640 align:start position:0%
precious state resources to where
 
00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
they're needed most so this
 
00:37:58.790 --> 00:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
what what what's being done here is just
 
00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
you know i think a travesty against the
 
00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:02.630 align:start position:0%
you know i think a travesty against the
uh

00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:05.200 align:start position:0%
granite staters and and taxpayers all
 
00:38:07.589 --> 00:38:07.599 align:start position:0%
across the state and you know i was
 
00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
gonna i was gonna introduce this a
 
00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:11.440 align:start position:0%
little bit later i'll make sure i send a
 
00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
copy to
 
00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
all the members on the committee but um
 
00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
but the senate did receive a um a letter
 
00:38:22.069 --> 00:38:22.079 align:start position:0%
from the the jim o'brien who's the chair
 
00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
of the hopkinton school board and you
 
00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
may know him because he's also a
 
00:38:27.829 --> 00:38:27.839 align:start position:0%
lobbyist and works for a lot of
 
00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
republican causes
 
00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
and um and he writes in this letter and
 
00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
again i do want this to be included in
 
00:38:37.349 --> 00:38:37.359 align:start position:0%
the senate bill 135 file that and i'm
 
00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
quoting from jim's letter here aside
 
00:38:41.910 --> 00:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
from political ideology we failed to
 
00:38:43.829 --> 00:38:43.839 align:start position:0%
understand why the legislature would
 
00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
undertake this unprecedented action to
 
00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:48.640 align:start position:0%
censor local school districts it is
 
00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
striking that the house rather than
 
00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
focus on providing students and
 
00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
communities with the resources needed to
 
00:38:57.109 --> 00:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
provide an adequate education or address
 
00:38:59.750 --> 00:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
the educational funding gap associated
 
00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:02.720 align:start position:0%
with covid19 has instead used the budget
 
00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
process to interfere with local control
 
00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
of education and freedom
 
00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
we hope that the senate finance
 
00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
committee will use its budget process to
 
00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
focus on providing resources to support
 
00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
student learning and provide local
 
00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
property tax relief right and then
 
00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
rather than fighting a fictitious
 
00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
culture war our students and communities
 
00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:23.440 align:start position:0%
deserve better and so
 
00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:24.310 align:start position:0%
deserve better and so
um

00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:24.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
you know i i think a vote to retain this
 
00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
bill is a vote to kill
 
00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
this bill essentially certainly for fy
 
00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
22 it is which this bill focuses on if
 
00:39:37.589 --> 00:39:37.599 align:start position:0%
you're going to retain it it's not going
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
to do anything um uh
 
00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:41.829 align:start position:0%
to do anything um uh
a so

00:39:41.829 --> 00:39:41.839 align:start position:0%
a so
 
00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
a vote to retain it is uh is clearly a
 
00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
vote against um uh property taxpayers
 
00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
across the state uh in in in particular
 
00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
in our hardest hit um uh most vulnerable
 
00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:54.710 align:start position:0%
in our hardest hit um uh most vulnerable
communities

00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:54.720 align:start position:0%
communities
 
00:39:58.310 --> 00:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
and um and and so i would encourage
 
00:40:01.349 --> 00:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
everybody to vote against the retain
 
00:40:05.829 --> 00:40:05.839 align:start position:0%
motion it's ill-advised uh i'm i'm glad
 
00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
we're doing this via zoom i hope lots of
 
00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
people are watching i know there's some
 
00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
media reporting out on this i hope it's
 
00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
widely reported and and i hope state
 
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
representatives are accountable for
 
00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
their votes
 
00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair
 
00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
i would concur with uh representative
 
00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
luno here
 
00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
the this is a this committee
 
00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
is responsible for dealing with
 
00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
public policy regarding education
 
00:40:39.349 --> 00:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
particularly the funding of education
 
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
by retaining this bill
 
00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
it basically is saying we're not ready
 
00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
to deal with this
 
00:40:47.589 --> 00:40:47.599 align:start position:0%
we've been dealing with this forever
 
00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
but representative luna's amendments
 
00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.190 align:start position:0%
but representative luna's amendments
provide

00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
provide
 
00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
is a clear statement of where this
 
00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
committee should be as it relates to
 
00:40:58.870 --> 00:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
property tax relief funding of schools
 
00:41:02.309 --> 00:41:02.319 align:start position:0%
etc schools cannot wait another year
 
00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with a fiscal year that's
 
00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:06.400 align:start position:0%
coming up that needs to have this kind
 
00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:07.349 align:start position:0%
coming up that needs to have this kind
of

00:41:07.349 --> 00:41:07.359 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:41:09.829 --> 00:41:09.839 align:start position:0%
proposals put forth in a direct kind of
 
00:41:11.829 --> 00:41:11.839 align:start position:0%
a way that can be incorporated into the
 
00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
budget i i really hope this committee
 
00:41:17.349 --> 00:41:17.359 align:start position:0%
will reject the retention
 
00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
motion before us so that we can deal
 
00:41:21.349 --> 00:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
with the amendments that representative
 
00:41:23.109 --> 00:41:23.119 align:start position:0%
luna has so
 
00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
aggressively and uh worked
 
00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
hard to try to provide information to
 
00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
this committee so that they can in fact
 
00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
make a decision and we need to do that
 
00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
now for the sake of the communities that
 
00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:40.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh
 
00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
representative thank you thank you thank
 
00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
you mr chair
 
00:41:47.349 --> 00:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
i am curious if
 
00:41:49.349 --> 00:41:49.359 align:start position:0%
the other representatives have read
 
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
section 44 1 of house bill 2.
 
00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
the language in there is almost exactly
 
00:41:59.270 --> 00:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
what is in senate bill 135 however it is
 
00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
more clear for your reference that's on
 
00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:05.200 align:start position:0%
page 22 lines 30 through 37 the language
 
00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
of the bill itself
 
00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
which has a fiscal note was incorporated
 
00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
in the budget i i know that i'm new but
 
00:42:13.829 --> 00:42:13.839 align:start position:0%
i don't understand how we'd be able to
 
00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
take up amendments that would need a
 
00:42:17.829 --> 00:42:17.839 align:start position:0%
fiscal note when the budget has already
 
00:42:19.349 --> 00:42:19.359 align:start position:0%
left the house is that something that
 
00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
would even be possible
 
00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:32.950 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:34.960 align:start position:0%
mr chair did you say that that's not
 
00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:38.790 align:start position:0%
mr chair did you say that that's not
possible

00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:41.109 --> 00:42:41.119 align:start position:0%
yeah it is possible
 
00:42:42.829 --> 00:42:42.839 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for correcting
 
00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:45.200 align:start position:0%
yourself you're welcome
 
00:42:46.950 --> 00:42:46.960 align:start position:0%
represent anderson
 
00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:49.670 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
i

00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
am in favor of retaining this bill i am
 
00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:56.640 align:start position:0%
all for adequate education and monies
 
00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
but i think we really need to ascertain
 
00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
what districts need what what money
 
00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:08.240 align:start position:0%
so far this year
 
00:43:11.109 --> 00:43:11.119 align:start position:0%
the government has funded over 650
 
00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
to the schools for colbin
 
00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
pre right now 350 million are going to
 
00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
be given out by the state of new
 
00:43:25.589 --> 00:43:25.599 align:start position:0%
hampshire to school districts
 
00:43:28.390 --> 00:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
and for next year i'm
 
00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
i don't think we have accurate figures
 
00:43:34.069 --> 00:43:34.079 align:start position:0%
on everything and i'll tell you why i
 
00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
come from a school district that's not
 
00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
considered a rich school district
 
00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:41.109 align:start position:0%
considered a rich school district
hello

00:43:41.109 --> 00:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
hello
 
00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
but they are going
 
00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
to receive
 
00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:48.800 align:start position:0%
oh us taxpayers are going to receive
 
00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
a fund balance of approximately 2
 
00:43:52.950 --> 00:43:52.960 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:43:55.109 --> 00:43:55.119 align:start position:0%
so if this kind of fun balance is going
 
00:43:57.270 --> 00:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
on in my school districts what's going
 
00:43:59.829 --> 00:43:59.839 align:start position:0%
on in other school districts and i i
 
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
just think we need to ascertain who
 
00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
really needs what before we go any
 
00:44:06.550 --> 00:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
further and i'm in favor of retaining
 
00:44:08.550 --> 00:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
this bill thank you
 
00:44:10.550 --> 00:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much our representative
 
00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:11.829 align:start position:0%
thank you very much our representative
cordelli

00:44:11.829 --> 00:44:11.839 align:start position:0%
cordelli
 
00:44:14.309 --> 00:44:14.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:16.160 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at a
 
00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
document from the legislative budget
 
00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
assistant dated
 
00:44:22.470 --> 00:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
april 27th
 
00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
and it's the estimated total education
 
00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:25.910 align:start position:0%
and it's the estimated total education
aid

00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
aid
 
00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
based on the house passed budget
 
00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
and uh looking at
 
00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
uh current law versus
 
00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
what the house passed
 
00:44:38.069 --> 00:44:38.079 align:start position:0%
a look at berlin
 
00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
since that was mentioned
 
00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
in 2022
 
00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
they get an additional 355 000
 
00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
uh based on the house pass budget and in
 
00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:50.710 align:start position:0%
uh based on the house pass budget and in
2023

00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
2023
 
00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:52.470 align:start position:0%
2023
351

00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:52.480 align:start position:0%
351
 
00:44:57.510 --> 00:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:01.829 --> 00:45:01.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:03.829 --> 00:45:03.839 align:start position:0%
that is one of my towns there is no
 
00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:06.640 align:start position:0%
change in the total aid
 
00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
from moultonborough
 
00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
so i think that
 
00:45:14.309 --> 00:45:14.319 align:start position:0%
this information is available
 
00:45:17.349 --> 00:45:17.359 align:start position:0%
many towns do receive
 
00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
so i think that
 
00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:29.670 align:start position:0%
 
is

00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
a good document um and i'll also point
 
00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:34.240 align:start position:0%
out since payroll was mentioned
 
00:45:38.069 --> 00:45:38.079 align:start position:0%
um they have an increase in 2022
 
00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
of 122 000 almost 123 thousand dollars
 
00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:42.870 align:start position:0%
of 122 000 almost 123 thousand dollars
and

00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:45:45.829 --> 00:45:45.839 align:start position:0%
over 126 000
 
00:45:45.839 --> 00:45:49.750 align:start position:0%
over 126 000
2023

00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
i think that most towns
 
00:45:57.190 --> 00:45:57.200 align:start position:0%
looking at this document will receive um
 
00:45:59.589 --> 00:45:59.599 align:start position:0%
an increase in total education paid
 
00:46:01.829 --> 00:46:01.839 align:start position:0%
under the house past budget
 
00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:05.430 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

00:46:05.430 --> 00:46:05.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair so so you
 
00:46:10.309 --> 00:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
know this is where we need to really pay
 
00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
attention to to the details here
 
00:46:14.950 --> 00:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
you're talking about the house pass
 
00:46:17.829 --> 00:46:17.839 align:start position:0%
budget over current law which uh current
 
00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
law already puts school districts in a
 
00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
90 million dollar deficit compared to fy
 
00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:26.240 align:start position:0%
21 the school year that's being finished
 
00:46:27.349 --> 00:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:46:30.550 --> 00:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
so so over with current law you're
 
00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
already starting out 90 million dollars
 
00:46:34.710 --> 00:46:34.720 align:start position:0%
in the whole um uh representative
 
00:46:37.510 --> 00:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
cordelli mentioned haverhill last so an
 
00:46:41.109 --> 00:46:41.119 align:start position:0%
fy 22 i'm sorry in fy 21 haverhill
 
00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
received an additional up a a a great
 
00:46:47.829 --> 00:46:47.839 align:start position:0%
supplemental grant of 801.
 
00:46:52.069 --> 00:46:52.079 align:start position:0%
make sure you get it right 801 514
 
00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
that goes away and is being replaced by
 
00:46:57.750 --> 00:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
a grant or by not a grant an increase
 
00:46:59.349 --> 00:46:59.359 align:start position:0%
largely due
 
00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
to the um the indexing of um of the of
 
00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
the of the 3709 adequacy
 
00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
to i think it's getting it gets indexed
 
00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
by one and a half percent
 
00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
um and so they're getting an additional
 
00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
would you say represent cordelia was a
 
00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:16.400 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars or something
 
00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
like that so it's it's it's over it's
 
00:47:20.950 --> 00:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
it's about seven hundred thousand
 
00:47:23.589 --> 00:47:23.599 align:start position:0%
dollars less than what haverill received
 
00:47:27.670 --> 00:47:27.680 align:start position:0%
in fy 21. so this is not something that
 
00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
is restoring um the house budget is not
 
00:47:33.349 --> 00:47:33.359 align:start position:0%
something that's restoring communities
 
00:47:36.069 --> 00:47:36.079 align:start position:0%
uh with with with resources beyond what
 
00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
they re school districts with resources
 
00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
beyond what they received in fy 21. it
 
00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
is it is it is pushing them back
 
00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:45.190 align:start position:0%
is it is it is pushing them back
substantially

00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
substantially
 
00:47:48.069 --> 00:47:48.079 align:start position:0%
so so i think represent chairman ladd
 
00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:50.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned that that over current law
 
00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
again current law not fy 21 that it was
 
00:47:54.550 --> 00:47:54.560 align:start position:0%
a um
 
00:47:59.109 --> 00:47:59.119 align:start position:0%
a 16 million add-on so so that is still
 
00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
uh 73
 
00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
74 million dollars short of of of what
 
00:48:09.109 --> 00:48:09.119 align:start position:0%
uh what districts received in fy 21. so
 
00:48:11.670 --> 00:48:11.680 align:start position:0%
so i think it's really important that uh
 
00:48:13.589 --> 00:48:13.599 align:start position:0%
that that when we when we talk about
 
00:48:13.599 --> 00:48:14.710 align:start position:0%
that that when we when we talk about
comparing

00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:14.720 align:start position:0%
comparing
 
00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
um uh house the republican uh budget
 
00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
that that we don't use this this you
 
00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:23.200 align:start position:0%
know this slippery oh you know current
 
00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
law um um that we that we compare it to
 
00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh to fy21 because that's what taxpayers
 
00:48:31.750 --> 00:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
are gonna do
 
00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
and uh follow-up to what you just
 
00:48:35.589 --> 00:48:35.599 align:start position:0%
mentioned represent luno
 
00:48:38.549 --> 00:48:38.559 align:start position:0%
uh and we've discussed this a number of
 
00:48:38.559 --> 00:48:39.750 align:start position:0%
uh and we've discussed this a number of
times

00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
times
 
00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
the issue of we were provided in the
 
00:48:46.630 --> 00:48:46.640 align:start position:0%
previous budget one-time money which are
 
00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
amounted to 60 million
 
00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
physical capacity disparity
 
00:48:52.950 --> 00:48:52.960 align:start position:0%
in several several categories
 
00:48:54.710 --> 00:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
that was put out by the school boards
 
00:48:56.950 --> 00:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
association department of education and
 
00:48:58.549 --> 00:48:58.559 align:start position:0%
other organizations
 
00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
be careful with that funding you receive
 
00:49:04.069 --> 00:49:04.079 align:start position:0%
it's one-time money
 
00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
one-time money that should not be thrown
 
00:49:10.069 --> 00:49:10.079 align:start position:0%
at labor extending labor contracts or or
 
00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
getting you involved with a labor
 
00:49:13.990 --> 00:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
contract that's gonna are not just a
 
00:49:16.549 --> 00:49:16.559 align:start position:0%
labor contract but any kind of contract
 
00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
which is going to cost you in future
 
00:49:21.589 --> 00:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
years this is one-time money so that
 
00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
amounted to 60 million dollars
 
00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:25.349 align:start position:0%
amounted to 60 million dollars
now

00:49:25.349 --> 00:49:25.359 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:49:28.829 --> 00:49:28.839 align:start position:0%
i also realized that we passed a bill hb
 
00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
242 which dealt with fiscal capacity
 
00:49:34.630 --> 00:49:34.640 align:start position:0%
disparity eight we also indicated in
 
00:49:35.829 --> 00:49:35.839 align:start position:0%
that bill there would be no
 
00:49:39.030 --> 00:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
stabilization so policy has spoken out
 
00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh unfortunately and i i agree from one
 
00:49:44.230 --> 00:49:44.240 align:start position:0%
standpoint this bill is based on a lot
 
00:49:46.390 --> 00:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
of stabilization
 
00:49:48.309 --> 00:49:48.319 align:start position:0%
and that to me
 
00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
is incorrect but that's where we are
 
00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
that their districts are receiving what
 
00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
they're receiving in current law in fact
 
00:49:58.870 --> 00:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
more for those communities which need it
 
00:50:00.549 --> 00:50:00.559 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying that the education
 
00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
formula is fixed this is why we wanted
 
00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
to retain and work on this from a policy
 
00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:08.630 align:start position:0%
to retain and work on this from a policy
perspective

00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:08.640 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
00:50:16.069 --> 00:50:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:18.309 --> 00:50:18.319 align:start position:0%
yeah i was just thinking along those
 
00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
same lines
 
00:50:21.829 --> 00:50:21.839 align:start position:0%
is how much of that money that you're
 
00:50:23.589 --> 00:50:23.599 align:start position:0%
saying is less than
 
00:50:23.599 --> 00:50:25.270 align:start position:0%
saying is less than
um

00:50:25.270 --> 00:50:25.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:27.030 align:start position:0%
um
2021

00:50:27.030 --> 00:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
2021
 
00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:29.680 align:start position:0%
is because of the
 
00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh one-time money because that can't
 
00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
really be counted in what they got done
 
00:50:36.870 --> 00:50:36.880 align:start position:0%
because that was a special
 
00:50:39.270 --> 00:50:39.280 align:start position:0%
that was a special circumstance
 
00:50:42.549 --> 00:50:42.559 align:start position:0%
but the other part is how much money are
 
00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
schools getting because of coded
 
00:50:48.390 --> 00:50:48.400 align:start position:0%
and that's real money as well
 
00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:50.640 align:start position:0%
and does how much is that and does that
 
00:50:53.190 --> 00:50:53.200 align:start position:0%
make up if you take the one-time money
 
00:50:55.829 --> 00:50:55.839 align:start position:0%
and the covid money
 
00:50:58.309 --> 00:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
by my calculations most schools are
 
00:51:00.309 --> 00:51:00.319 align:start position:0%
actually getting more money
 
00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:04.240 align:start position:0%
then they i mean you have to take out
 
00:51:05.829 --> 00:51:05.839 align:start position:0%
the one-time money because that doesn't
 
00:51:05.839 --> 00:51:06.950 align:start position:0%
the one-time money because that doesn't
count

00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
count
 
00:51:08.950 --> 00:51:08.960 align:start position:0%
but then you add in the covid money
 
00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
because that's real money that they're
 
00:51:11.910 --> 00:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
getting at any rate
 
00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
i think uh the numbers don't work
 
00:51:16.950 --> 00:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
sam porter
 
00:51:18.630 --> 00:51:18.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and this is just a
 
00:51:20.950 --> 00:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
comment i had the honor of
 
00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
of substituting in uh the finance
 
00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
committee division two when
 
00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
when uh the budget was being finalized
 
00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:30.390 align:start position:0%
when uh the budget was being finalized
and

00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:51:32.870 --> 00:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
a hundred million dollars
 
00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:34.230 align:start position:0%
a hundred million dollars
was

00:51:34.230 --> 00:51:34.240 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
found or the revenue estimates came in
 
00:51:39.990 --> 00:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
100 million dollars 130 million dollars
 
00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
higher than had been expected and the
 
00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
and the division two got a hundred
 
00:51:47.670 --> 00:51:47.680 align:start position:0%
million dollars at that time to uh to
 
00:51:50.950 --> 00:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
use for education and the decision was
 
00:51:53.430 --> 00:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunately to use that hundred
 
00:51:55.990 --> 00:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
million dollars in my opinion to give a
 
00:52:00.870 --> 00:52:00.880 align:start position:0%
a one-time one-time tax cut on the um
 
00:52:03.349 --> 00:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
on the property the education property
 
00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
taxes as representative luna mentioned
 
00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
here in hillsborough
 
00:52:08.470 --> 00:52:08.480 align:start position:0%
that difference is going to get me a
 
00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
nice meal um it's not going to do much
 
00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:12.640 align:start position:0%
else and
 
00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:14.240 align:start position:0%
that hundred thousand dollars 100
 
00:52:15.670 --> 00:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
million dollars could certainly have
 
00:52:16.829 --> 00:52:16.839 align:start position:0%
been used
 
00:52:20.150 --> 00:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
to do what representative luna was
 
00:52:23.430 --> 00:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
recommending with his amendments um so
 
00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
that was one time money everything is
 
00:52:27.829 --> 00:52:27.839 align:start position:0%
one-time money but we keep finding it
 
00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
the next year
 
00:52:31.510 --> 00:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm just just pointing that out
 
00:52:32.790 --> 00:52:32.800 align:start position:0%
to you we could have used that hundred
 
00:52:34.549 --> 00:52:34.559 align:start position:0%
million dollars in a way that really
 
00:52:36.069 --> 00:52:36.079 align:start position:0%
would have benefited
 
00:52:39.109 --> 00:52:39.119 align:start position:0%
taxpayers in school districts um all
 
00:52:41.349 --> 00:52:41.359 align:start position:0%
in the neediest towns in a beneficial
 
00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
way instead of giving a nice
 
00:52:46.710 --> 00:52:46.720 align:start position:0%
fat check to towns that have a lot of
 
00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
rich property and
 
00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
nice meals out to those of us who live
 
00:52:53.109 --> 00:52:53.119 align:start position:0%
in property poor towns
 
00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
thank you from tanner
 
00:52:57.670 --> 00:52:57.680 align:start position:0%
thank you uh mr chair i just want to
 
00:52:59.190 --> 00:52:59.200 align:start position:0%
point out that the coveted money had a
 
00:53:00.549 --> 00:53:00.559 align:start position:0%
lot of restrictions
 
00:53:02.790 --> 00:53:02.800 align:start position:0%
on it what it could be used for and also
 
00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
that schools incurred a lot of costs due
 
00:53:08.549 --> 00:53:08.559 align:start position:0%
to uh things that they had to do uh to
 
00:53:10.950 --> 00:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
comply with kova just even routine
 
00:53:13.109 --> 00:53:13.119 align:start position:0%
maintenance has now changed tremendously
 
00:53:15.430 --> 00:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
because of of covet how everything has
 
00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
to be disinfected um and i'd like to say
 
00:53:21.109 --> 00:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
that even though it was one-time money
 
00:53:24.069 --> 00:53:24.079 align:start position:0%
last year it was a way to show
 
00:53:26.710 --> 00:53:26.720 align:start position:0%
that property tax relief for once could
 
00:53:29.589 --> 00:53:29.599 align:start position:0%
be really really done
 
00:53:30.790 --> 00:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
and done
 
00:53:33.670 --> 00:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
on an equal basis and several towns that
 
00:53:36.870 --> 00:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
i represent really uh need that extra
 
00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:38.150 align:start position:0%
i represent really uh need that extra
money

00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:53:39.829 --> 00:53:39.839 align:start position:0%
to help their property taxes their
 
00:53:42.870 --> 00:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
property taxes are are three four times
 
00:53:44.710 --> 00:53:44.720 align:start position:0%
as high as mine so
 
00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
um living in a property rich town so i
 
00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
think that um
 
00:53:50.870 --> 00:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
you know it's time to look at
 
00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
helping these schools out public schools
 
00:53:55.990 --> 00:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
out in towns that are property poor and
 
00:53:57.510 --> 00:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
we do that by
 
00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
helping with um the extra funds that
 
00:54:02.710 --> 00:54:02.720 align:start position:0%
that uh should be distributed on a
 
00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
disparity basis thank you
 
00:54:07.670 --> 00:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:08.390 align:start position:0%
further discussion
from

00:54:08.390 --> 00:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:10.069 align:start position:0%
from
representatives

00:54:10.069 --> 00:54:10.079 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
00:54:13.430 --> 00:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman uh i i'm
 
00:54:15.990 --> 00:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
strongly against retaining this bill
 
00:54:18.309 --> 00:54:18.319 align:start position:0%
uh this is a bill that lowers property
 
00:54:20.150 --> 00:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
taxes in areas that where they need to
 
00:54:22.309 --> 00:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
be lowered puts
 
00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:24.720 align:start position:0%
more money for education in the areas
 
00:54:27.109 --> 00:54:27.119 align:start position:0%
where it's needed and it distresses me
 
00:54:29.109 --> 00:54:29.119 align:start position:0%
when people on the committee say one
 
00:54:31.190 --> 00:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
time money does not count
 
00:54:33.109 --> 00:54:33.119 align:start position:0%
ask members of a local school board
 
00:54:35.589 --> 00:54:35.599 align:start position:0%
whether the one-time money counts or not
 
00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
and you'll get the answer
 
00:54:40.150 --> 00:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
and i as people have said earlier i'm
 
00:54:42.790 --> 00:54:42.800 align:start position:0%
glad that this particular hearing that
 
00:54:44.950 --> 00:54:44.960 align:start position:0%
we're having or discussion we're having
 
00:54:46.309 --> 00:54:46.319 align:start position:0%
is being
 
00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
will be get into the press and we'll go
 
00:54:51.829 --> 00:54:51.839 align:start position:0%
across the state and local voters will
 
00:54:51.839 --> 00:54:53.030 align:start position:0%
across the state and local voters will
determine

00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
determine
 
00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:54.150 align:start position:0%
determine
how

00:54:54.150 --> 00:54:54.160 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:54:56.309 --> 00:54:56.319 align:start position:0%
what happens as a result of the way we
 
00:54:58.230 --> 00:54:58.240 align:start position:0%
work on this particular bill
 
00:54:59.829 --> 00:54:59.839 align:start position:0%
and those will be that will be the
 
00:55:01.910 --> 00:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
determination about whether
 
00:55:03.910 --> 00:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
we're doing dealing with fair funding
 
00:55:06.150 --> 00:55:06.160 align:start position:0%
for education or something else thank
 
00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:07.109 align:start position:0%
for education or something else thank
you

00:55:07.109 --> 00:55:07.119 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:55:09.829 --> 00:55:09.839 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
sure thank you mr chair
 
00:55:15.190 --> 00:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
uh this committee is made up of uh folks
 
00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:17.200 align:start position:0%
that have been teachers
 
00:55:19.670 --> 00:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
administrators school board members
 
00:55:22.309 --> 00:55:22.319 align:start position:0%
my case all three we're pretty much part
 
00:55:24.470 --> 00:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
of the education establishment we care
 
00:55:26.069 --> 00:55:26.079 align:start position:0%
about education we want to support
 
00:55:26.079 --> 00:55:27.430 align:start position:0%
about education we want to support
education

00:55:27.430 --> 00:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:55:30.069 --> 00:55:30.079 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to say a couple things
 
00:55:30.079 --> 00:55:30.950 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to say a couple things
when

00:55:30.950 --> 00:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
school numbers and populations go up the
 
00:55:36.710 --> 00:55:36.720 align:start position:0%
argument is to give schools more money
 
00:55:39.190 --> 00:55:39.200 align:start position:0%
which i think we all get in this case
 
00:55:41.589 --> 00:55:41.599 align:start position:0%
the school population numbers have gone
 
00:55:44.710 --> 00:55:44.720 align:start position:0%
down and yet that's being used as a
 
00:55:46.950 --> 00:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
reason to give the schools more money
 
00:55:50.950 --> 00:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
um and i think some of us need to get
 
00:55:53.430 --> 00:55:53.440 align:start position:0%
outside the education establishment and
 
00:55:55.109 --> 00:55:55.119 align:start position:0%
look at this from
 
00:55:56.870 --> 00:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
from a broader perspective i just want
 
00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
to read one small paragraph from a
 
00:56:01.829 --> 00:56:01.839 align:start position:0%
message or letter that neil curric
 
00:56:03.670 --> 00:56:03.680 align:start position:0%
former finance chair
 
00:56:05.750 --> 00:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
sent to all of us and he wrote
 
00:56:07.670 --> 00:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
public school districts in new hampshire
 
00:56:09.870 --> 00:56:09.880 align:start position:0%
are slated to receive
 
00:56:13.349 --> 00:56:13.359 align:start position:0%
350 million dollars under president
 
00:56:16.870 --> 00:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
biden's 1.9 trillion american rescue
 
00:56:18.870 --> 00:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
plan which is more than twice what the
 
00:56:20.789 --> 00:56:20.799 align:start position:0%
federal government promised
 
00:56:23.670 --> 00:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
in december's covert 19 relief packets
 
00:56:25.589 --> 00:56:25.599 align:start position:0%
it's roughly eight times what schools
 
00:56:27.510 --> 00:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
here were allocated in the cares act a
 
00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:28.720 align:start position:0%
year ago
 
00:56:30.710 --> 00:56:30.720 align:start position:0%
the so-called strings are tasked and the
 
00:56:33.750 --> 00:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
use of these covert funds are tied quite
 
00:56:37.349 --> 00:56:37.359 align:start position:0%
loosely according to uh neil kirk uh
 
00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
they will more than cover any covert 19
 
00:56:42.870 --> 00:56:42.880 align:start position:0%
related revenue losses and he finishes
 
00:56:45.270 --> 00:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
is it really necessary to add state
 
00:56:47.190 --> 00:56:47.200 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars to these already
 
00:56:49.670 --> 00:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
excessively generous federal grants how
 
00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
many times over should schools be paid
 
00:56:54.549 --> 00:56:54.559 align:start position:0%
for covert 19 related losses so i think
 
00:56:55.430 --> 00:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
that we
 
00:56:57.670 --> 00:56:57.680 align:start position:0%
need to hear some of these other voices
 
00:56:57.680 --> 00:56:58.630 align:start position:0%
need to hear some of these other voices
like

00:56:58.630 --> 00:56:58.640 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:57:04.630 --> 00:57:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:06.150 --> 00:57:06.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:57:08.789 --> 00:57:08.799 align:start position:0%
i agree with entertaining and also
 
00:57:11.510 --> 00:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
comment on one time
 
00:57:14.630 --> 00:57:14.640 align:start position:0%
it came supposedly with strings of tax
 
00:57:16.390 --> 00:57:16.400 align:start position:0%
that should only be used for capital
 
00:57:18.789 --> 00:57:18.799 align:start position:0%
improvements and infrastructure
 
00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
now in our town we made sure that we had
 
00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
a special meeting where we voted to put
 
00:57:27.670 --> 00:57:27.680 align:start position:0%
it in our capital improvement budget so
 
00:57:30.150 --> 00:57:30.160 align:start position:0%
the school board can then use it for
 
00:57:33.270 --> 00:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
emergencies and that kind of stuff
 
00:57:35.349 --> 00:57:35.359 align:start position:0%
you know for example
 
00:57:38.309 --> 00:57:38.319 align:start position:0%
elementary school the electrical systems
 
00:57:40.069 --> 00:57:40.079 align:start position:0%
probably will have to be replaced
 
00:57:41.990 --> 00:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
participates way back
 
00:57:44.710 --> 00:57:44.720 align:start position:0%
and other things that we know may happen
 
00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
so rather than taxing
 
00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:50.240 align:start position:0%
putting in the budget for a future year
 
00:57:53.109 --> 00:57:53.119 align:start position:0%
today we need 50 million for this we
 
00:57:55.030 --> 00:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
have money so
 
00:57:57.349 --> 00:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
that's what it was supposed to be used
 
00:57:59.990 --> 00:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
for it was one time for infrastructure
 
00:58:02.150 --> 00:58:02.160 align:start position:0%
and capital improvement some districts
 
00:58:04.230 --> 00:58:04.240 align:start position:0%
used it for other things that they
 
00:58:06.309 --> 00:58:06.319 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have and now they're going to
 
00:58:06.319 --> 00:58:09.589 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have and now they're going to
suffer

00:58:09.589 --> 00:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
so i think we need to retain this to
 
00:58:15.109 --> 00:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
find out what if anything
 
00:58:17.270 --> 00:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
the budget is going to do
 
00:58:18.710 --> 00:58:18.720 align:start position:0%
also too
 
00:58:21.829 --> 00:58:21.839 align:start position:0%
this as i understand it should have been
 
00:58:23.990 --> 00:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
an early bill because the financial
 
00:58:26.470 --> 00:58:26.480 align:start position:0%
thing but it wasn't giving it to us that
 
00:58:29.109 --> 00:58:29.119 align:start position:0%
way so yeah i think we need to look at
 
00:58:29.119 --> 00:58:29.829 align:start position:0%
way so yeah i think we need to look at
it

00:58:29.829 --> 00:58:29.839 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:58:32.230 --> 00:58:32.240 align:start position:0%
look at other bills
 
00:58:36.069 --> 00:58:36.079 align:start position:0%
bank with funding and come up with and
 
00:58:38.870 --> 00:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
for next november come up with a good
 
00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:40.960 align:start position:0%
bill to fix
 
00:58:43.829 --> 00:58:43.839 align:start position:0%
some of the school funding other than
 
00:58:45.990 --> 00:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
what the house does
 
00:58:47.670 --> 00:58:47.680 align:start position:0%
the house
 
00:58:50.069 --> 00:58:50.079 align:start position:0%
budget and the senate it
 
00:58:52.069 --> 00:58:52.079 align:start position:0%
has done thank you
 
00:58:53.589 --> 00:58:53.599 align:start position:0%
and i'd like to follow up to that just
 
00:58:55.270 --> 00:58:55.280 align:start position:0%
for a second that
 
00:58:57.990 --> 00:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
when we passed hb 242
 
00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
it dealt with all the components of
 
00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:01.670 align:start position:0%
it dealt with all the components of
adequacy

00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
adequacy
 
00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
dealing with the base cost dealing with
 
00:59:07.430 --> 00:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
the differentiated aid as well
 
00:59:10.390 --> 00:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh the other areas which we've had
 
00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
physical capacity disparity
 
00:59:14.470 --> 00:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
above and beyond
 
00:59:17.030 --> 00:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
and grant money but looking back at that
 
00:59:18.390 --> 00:59:18.400 align:start position:0%
base cost
 
00:59:20.710 --> 00:59:20.720 align:start position:0%
we also included within 242 the
 
00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
components what make up base advocacy
 
00:59:25.670 --> 00:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
what is the base cost comprised of well
 
00:59:27.430 --> 00:59:27.440 align:start position:0%
it's comprised of
 
00:59:29.109 --> 00:59:29.119 align:start position:0%
the teachers
 
00:59:30.549 --> 00:59:30.559 align:start position:0%
support staff
 
00:59:32.950 --> 00:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
books classroom uh
 
00:59:35.829 --> 00:59:35.839 align:start position:0%
equipment computers technology
 
00:59:38.470 --> 00:59:38.480 align:start position:0%
technology support all that has been in
 
00:59:41.190 --> 00:59:41.200 align:start position:0%
that base cost for years right back to
 
00:59:43.829 --> 00:59:43.839 align:start position:0%
when we all part started here and we
 
00:59:47.030 --> 00:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
looked at that formula came out of that
 
00:59:48.789 --> 00:59:48.799 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee that
 
00:59:52.870 --> 00:59:52.880 align:start position:0%
dealt with all this back in 2008
 
00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:53.589 align:start position:0%
dealt with all this back in 2008
we

00:59:53.589 --> 00:59:53.599 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:59:55.990 --> 00:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
have the responsibilities of policy
 
00:59:58.390 --> 00:59:58.400 align:start position:0%
committee to look at that and to
 
00:59:58.400 --> 00:59:59.589 align:start position:0%
committee to look at that and to
identify

00:59:59.589 --> 00:59:59.599 align:start position:0%
identify
 
01:00:02.549 --> 01:00:02.559 align:start position:0%
uh are the inputs now matching up with
 
01:00:04.710 --> 01:00:04.720 align:start position:0%
the needs in the schools and that's
 
01:00:06.309 --> 01:00:06.319 align:start position:0%
something that needs to be done we would
 
01:00:08.069 --> 01:00:08.079 align:start position:0%
do that in conjunction with this
 
01:00:09.589 --> 01:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
retaining the bill
 
01:00:11.829 --> 01:00:11.839 align:start position:0%
and and get the policy statements
 
01:00:11.839 --> 01:00:13.030 align:start position:0%
and and get the policy statements
addressed

01:00:13.030 --> 01:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
01:00:16.069 --> 01:00:16.079 align:start position:0%
um i think that everybody agrees here
 
01:00:18.870 --> 01:00:18.880 align:start position:0%
that we need physical capacity disparity
 
01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
uh there's different ways of doing that
 
01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
but we i thought we had all pretty much
 
01:00:24.789 --> 01:00:24.799 align:start position:0%
gotten the same page in terms of using
 
01:00:27.990 --> 01:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
equalized evaluation per pupil and and
 
01:00:29.589 --> 01:00:29.599 align:start position:0%
trying to address those towns where
 
01:00:31.510 --> 01:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
their equalized property valuations are
 
01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
as low as 350 000 dollars approximately
 
01:00:36.549 --> 01:00:36.559 align:start position:0%
and you have of course some that are up
 
01:00:39.109 --> 01:00:39.119 align:start position:0%
for well over seven million dollars per
 
01:00:41.109 --> 01:00:41.119 align:start position:0%
pupil there's a huge difference there
 
01:00:43.829 --> 01:00:43.839 align:start position:0%
and a huge difference in capacity to
 
01:00:45.910 --> 01:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
raise dollars but we also have other
 
01:00:47.589 --> 01:00:47.599 align:start position:0%
issues we have some communities which
 
01:00:47.599 --> 01:00:48.549 align:start position:0%
issues we have some communities which
have

01:00:48.549 --> 01:00:48.559 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:00:50.470 --> 01:00:50.480 align:start position:0%
you know high property valuation per
 
01:00:52.870 --> 01:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
pupil but also have
 
01:00:55.510 --> 01:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh lower medium family incomes based
 
01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:56.390 align:start position:0%
uh lower medium family incomes based
upon

01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
upon
 
01:00:58.390 --> 01:00:58.400 align:start position:0%
the the people are living in the
 
01:01:00.470 --> 01:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
community and those which are in the
 
01:01:02.150 --> 01:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
condos and all that go down to
 
01:01:04.390 --> 01:01:04.400 align:start position:0%
massachusetts everything actually
 
01:01:06.549 --> 01:01:06.559 align:start position:0%
when the skiing season is over
 
01:01:08.789 --> 01:01:08.799 align:start position:0%
and so they still have those property
 
01:01:10.549 --> 01:01:10.559 align:start position:0%
valuations which they're taxing within
 
01:01:12.950 --> 01:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
those committees yes but we also have
 
01:01:13.990 --> 01:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
that same
 
01:01:16.789 --> 01:01:16.799 align:start position:0%
value of tax save that rate applied to
 
01:01:18.870 --> 01:01:18.880 align:start position:0%
those which don't have that capacity to
 
01:01:21.109 --> 01:01:21.119 align:start position:0%
pay that within those communities i
 
01:01:23.109 --> 01:01:23.119 align:start position:0%
understand there's problems
 
01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
and i understand we need to address them
 
01:01:27.190 --> 01:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
we have tried to address them and we
 
01:01:29.910 --> 01:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
will continue to try to address them and
 
01:01:33.270 --> 01:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
so i i just want to make it clear that
 
01:01:35.589 --> 01:01:35.599 align:start position:0%
what represent also said it's something
 
01:01:37.589 --> 01:01:37.599 align:start position:0%
that has to be taken into account our
 
01:01:40.069 --> 01:01:40.079 align:start position:0%
demographics in the state since going
 
01:01:40.079 --> 01:01:40.870 align:start position:0%
demographics in the state since going
back

01:01:40.870 --> 01:01:40.880 align:start position:0%
back
 
01:01:43.589 --> 01:01:43.599 align:start position:0%
20 years ago are significantly lower
 
01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
today than they were then and we're
 
01:01:48.150 --> 01:01:48.160 align:start position:0%
expecting to see another huge decrease
 
01:01:50.470 --> 01:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
in the next eight to ten years
 
01:01:53.589 --> 01:01:53.599 align:start position:0%
so we cannot continue to keep funding
 
01:01:55.829 --> 01:01:55.839 align:start position:0%
based upon what was received and
 
01:01:57.750 --> 01:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
bullying it up for building it all up
 
01:02:00.150 --> 01:02:00.160 align:start position:0%
based on our stabilization we need a
 
01:02:02.470 --> 01:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
formula that's going to be accurate and
 
01:02:04.710 --> 01:02:04.720 align:start position:0%
support the education needs of all in
 
01:02:07.270 --> 01:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
this state and i think that that's we're
 
01:02:08.950 --> 01:02:08.960 align:start position:0%
working towards that i think we have a
 
01:02:12.069 --> 01:02:12.079 align:start position:0%
lot of understanding there however uh we
 
01:02:14.549 --> 01:02:14.559 align:start position:0%
are hopefully the bill that we're seeing
 
01:02:17.270 --> 01:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
coming through the house we did we did
 
01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:18.470 align:start position:0%
coming through the house we did we did
uh

01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:02:21.510 --> 01:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
fund more than current law suggests in
 
01:02:24.950 --> 01:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
fy 22 another 16 million dollars and
 
01:02:27.990 --> 01:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
then flight 23 another 17.5 million
 
01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.030 align:start position:0%
then flight 23 another 17.5 million
dollars

01:02:29.030 --> 01:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:02:32.150 --> 01:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
so there are increases there in our
 
01:02:35.270 --> 01:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
course i understand represent laurels uh
 
01:02:37.750 --> 01:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
where he's coming up with that data
 
01:02:40.230 --> 01:02:40.240 align:start position:0%
however we're not looking at the current
 
01:02:42.710 --> 01:02:42.720 align:start position:0%
law we're looking at various components
 
01:02:44.309 --> 01:02:44.319 align:start position:0%
like the one-time money which is the
 
01:02:46.789 --> 01:02:46.799 align:start position:0%
physical capacity which was the 60
 
01:02:48.789 --> 01:02:48.799 align:start position:0%
million dollars out of that 90 million
 
01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
dollars everybody's talking about thank
 
01:02:54.950 --> 01:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:57.030 --> 01:02:57.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
01:02:58.309 --> 01:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
and i appreciate your comments
 
01:03:01.349 --> 01:03:01.359 align:start position:0%
particularly those that reflect
 
01:03:02.710 --> 01:03:02.720 align:start position:0%
been with dealing with this problem
 
01:03:05.030 --> 01:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
since 2008
 
01:03:06.470 --> 01:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
and the fact that it needs to be
 
01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
addressed well that's the point it needs
 
01:03:09.990 --> 01:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
to be addressed
 
01:03:11.589 --> 01:03:11.599 align:start position:0%
um and when you're talking about
 
01:03:13.349 --> 01:03:13.359 align:start position:0%
declining enrollments in the next eight
 
01:03:15.349 --> 01:03:15.359 align:start position:0%
to ten years that doesn't solve the next
 
01:03:17.829 --> 01:03:17.839 align:start position:0%
two years of budget and putting it back
 
01:03:21.510 --> 01:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
in to way to look at this uh 242 with
 
01:03:23.349 --> 01:03:23.359 align:start position:0%
the old-fashioned way account count
 
01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
pencil accounts desk count kids and
 
01:03:28.150 --> 01:03:28.160 align:start position:0%
divide we've done nothing to improve
 
01:03:31.029 --> 01:03:31.039 align:start position:0%
education property tax relief with this
 
01:03:31.039 --> 01:03:32.390 align:start position:0%
education property tax relief with this
bill

01:03:32.390 --> 01:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:03:34.150 --> 01:03:34.160 align:start position:0%
i would ask how many people sitting
 
01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
around this room sometime during the
 
01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
last political campaign didn't say let's
 
01:03:41.829 --> 01:03:41.839 align:start position:0%
reduce property taxes and let's stop
 
01:03:44.390 --> 01:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
paying having state money state bills
 
01:03:46.150 --> 01:03:46.160 align:start position:0%
passed on localities i can't imagine
 
01:03:47.670 --> 01:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
anyone didn't say that but that's
 
01:03:49.510 --> 01:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
exactly what we're doing
 
01:03:51.109 --> 01:03:51.119 align:start position:0%
so we're not helping property taxes
 
01:03:53.349 --> 01:03:53.359 align:start position:0%
we're not helping education uh across
 
01:03:55.029 --> 01:03:55.039 align:start position:0%
the state we're supposed to be helping
 
01:03:57.589 --> 01:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
education across the state for all
 
01:03:57.599 --> 01:03:58.390 align:start position:0%
education across the state for all
students

01:03:58.390 --> 01:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:04:00.150 --> 01:04:00.160 align:start position:0%
i think the fact is it passes kick in
 
01:04:02.069 --> 01:04:02.079 align:start position:0%
the bucket you you are absolutely
 
01:04:03.589 --> 01:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
correct representative you've been
 
01:04:05.750 --> 01:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
kicking it since 2008 and then one
 
01:04:08.789 --> 01:04:08.799 align:start position:0%
chance to address it we haven't
 
01:04:09.670 --> 01:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:04:11.349 --> 01:04:11.359 align:start position:0%
represent woodcock we've had several
 
01:04:13.829 --> 01:04:13.839 align:start position:0%
chances to address it we have you look
 
01:04:15.349 --> 01:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
back at the
 
01:04:18.390 --> 01:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
task force report came out of 2018
 
01:04:20.789 --> 01:04:20.799 align:start position:0%
and you look at what we proposed through
 
01:04:24.309 --> 01:04:24.319 align:start position:0%
hb 242 we're looking at identifying the
 
01:04:27.109 --> 01:04:27.119 align:start position:0%
cost of an adequate education first
 
01:04:28.870 --> 01:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
what came out of the commission which
 
01:04:32.069 --> 01:04:32.079 align:start position:0%
was looking at the total cost based upon
 
01:04:33.910 --> 01:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
what is annually submitted by the deal
 
01:04:36.150 --> 01:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
on doe 25 form
 
01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
to support students which involves
 
01:04:40.870 --> 01:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
athletics and all kinds of things which
 
01:04:44.309 --> 01:04:44.319 align:start position:0%
are not part of adequacy so you can't
 
01:04:47.190 --> 01:04:47.200 align:start position:0%
come up with an average cost based upon
 
01:04:49.270 --> 01:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
everything we're spending for students
 
01:04:51.430 --> 01:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
it's got to be what is necessary for
 
01:04:53.270 --> 01:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
instruction and curriculum
 
01:04:55.750 --> 01:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
that has not been addressed and that
 
01:04:57.670 --> 01:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
needs to and that's where policy has to
 
01:04:58.789 --> 01:04:58.799 align:start position:0%
step in
 
01:05:00.309 --> 01:05:00.319 align:start position:0%
and that's what we're trying to do with
 
01:05:02.470 --> 01:05:02.480 align:start position:0%
hb 242
 
01:05:06.829 --> 01:05:06.839 align:start position:0%
representative i like this thank you
 
01:05:09.910 --> 01:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that i am very
 
01:05:12.390 --> 01:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
appreciative that representative luno
 
01:05:14.870 --> 01:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
printed out that i really wanted to see
 
01:05:17.190 --> 01:05:17.200 align:start position:0%
was what people are actually paying on
 
01:05:20.470 --> 01:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
their taxes not tax rates not
 
01:05:22.309 --> 01:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
this town is worth this much and this
 
01:05:24.069 --> 01:05:24.079 align:start position:0%
town is worth this much so the first
 
01:05:26.789 --> 01:05:26.799 align:start position:0%
thing i looked at was berlin
 
01:05:30.549 --> 01:05:30.559 align:start position:0%
which yes has a 39.82
 
01:05:31.910 --> 01:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
tax rate
 
01:05:35.029 --> 01:05:35.039 align:start position:0%
but on average people pay
 
01:05:35.039 --> 01:05:35.510 align:start position:0%
but on average people pay
and 2

01:05:35.510 --> 01:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
and 2
 
01:05:37.829 --> 01:05:37.839 align:start position:0%
dollars and i looked at my town which is
 
01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
considered a property rich town hudson
 
01:05:47.829 --> 01:05:47.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:50.789 --> 01:05:50.799 align:start position:0%
which is about half of what berlin is
 
01:05:53.109 --> 01:05:53.119 align:start position:0%
and yet we actually end up paying five
 
01:05:55.430 --> 01:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
thousand four hundred and three dollars
 
01:05:58.069 --> 01:05:58.079 align:start position:0%
which is twice what the people of berlin
 
01:06:00.390 --> 01:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
are paying and that's why
 
01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:01.430 align:start position:0%
are paying and that's why
i

01:06:01.430 --> 01:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:06:02.829 --> 01:06:02.839 align:start position:0%
objected all
 
01:06:05.910 --> 01:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
along since last term
 
01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:07.270 align:start position:0%
along since last term
to

01:06:07.270 --> 01:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:06:09.829 --> 01:06:09.839 align:start position:0%
planning figuring out how much
 
01:06:13.349 --> 01:06:13.359 align:start position:0%
money towns should get based on their
 
01:06:15.750 --> 01:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
property valuation because that doesn't
 
01:06:17.670 --> 01:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
really give you a picture
 
01:06:20.069 --> 01:06:20.079 align:start position:0%
of the taxes in the town
 
01:06:22.470 --> 01:06:22.480 align:start position:0%
and so this gives us a better picture of
 
01:06:25.670 --> 01:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
the actual taxes berlin people in berlin
 
01:06:27.430 --> 01:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
are paying half
 
01:06:29.430 --> 01:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
what the people in hudson are paying
 
01:06:32.390 --> 01:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
even though their tax rate is twice
 
01:06:33.829 --> 01:06:33.839 align:start position:0%
so and
 
01:06:36.870 --> 01:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
as um representative luna said well they
 
01:06:38.470 --> 01:06:38.480 align:start position:0%
make half as much money well they're
 
01:06:41.029 --> 01:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
paying half as much taxes so it's still
 
01:06:41.039 --> 01:06:42.230 align:start position:0%
paying half as much taxes so it's still
equitable

01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
equitable
 
01:06:44.309 --> 01:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
and so i think we should we need to
 
01:06:46.710 --> 01:06:46.720 align:start position:0%
spend this time to come up with
 
01:06:49.349 --> 01:06:49.359 align:start position:0%
another way of figuring out like i
 
01:06:51.510 --> 01:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
really like the free and reduced lunch
 
01:06:53.910 --> 01:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
message if we could because we don't
 
01:06:55.430 --> 01:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
have average
 
01:06:57.109 --> 01:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
amount of money that people make in a
 
01:06:59.029 --> 01:06:59.039 align:start position:0%
town but that makes more sense what is
 
01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
the actual tax burden
 
01:07:05.029 --> 01:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
to the human being to the taxpayer
 
01:07:05.039 --> 01:07:06.230 align:start position:0%
to the human being to the taxpayer
not

01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:07:08.309 --> 01:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
overall and so
 
01:07:10.230 --> 01:07:10.240 align:start position:0%
i think we need to go back and look at
 
01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:11.829 align:start position:0%
i think we need to go back and look at
this

01:07:11.829 --> 01:07:11.839 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:07:12.789 --> 01:07:12.799 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:07:14.549 --> 01:07:14.559 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much um mr chair um
 
01:07:20.150 --> 01:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
you and i and and representative miler
 
01:07:21.910 --> 01:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
have obviously been and others have been
 
01:07:24.549 --> 01:07:24.559 align:start position:0%
working on this a long time and i think
 
01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
um and i've particularly been putting a
 
01:07:28.789 --> 01:07:28.799 align:start position:0%
lot of time in on the amendments for
 
01:07:31.829 --> 01:07:31.839 align:start position:0%
senate bill 135
 
01:07:34.710 --> 01:07:34.720 align:start position:0%
i also put a lot of effort in
 
01:07:39.349 --> 01:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
using the dra data to develop
 
01:07:41.589 --> 01:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
the spreadsheets that that i sent to the
 
01:07:44.150 --> 01:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
committee and sent to the media um in
 
01:07:45.990 --> 01:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
the last couple of days
 
01:07:48.789 --> 01:07:48.799 align:start position:0%
and and i think in all transparency when
 
01:07:51.990 --> 01:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
we talk about what um what what what a
 
01:07:54.710 --> 01:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
property taxpayer is paying on a median
 
01:07:57.670 --> 01:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
priced home in their town we need to
 
01:08:00.230 --> 01:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
have full disclosure on that which which
 
01:08:02.309 --> 01:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
the spreadsheets do unlike what
 
01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:04.799 align:start position:0%
representative leakas just talked about
 
01:08:06.710 --> 01:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
so the median priced
 
01:08:10.549 --> 01:08:10.559 align:start position:0%
residential property um in berlin is
 
01:08:13.990 --> 01:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
sixty five thousand dollars um
 
01:08:15.990 --> 01:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
sixty five thousand fifty dollars
 
01:08:18.390 --> 01:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
actually so when they're paying almost
 
01:08:20.309 --> 01:08:20.319 align:start position:0%
twenty six hundred dollars in property
 
01:08:23.669 --> 01:08:23.679 align:start position:0%
tax on that sixty five thousand dollar
 
01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
piece of property and um uh this comes
 
01:08:29.430 --> 01:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
from the dra data uh it includes
 
01:08:31.910 --> 01:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
residential land as well as residential
 
01:08:34.229 --> 01:08:34.239 align:start position:0%
improved properties so that's the median
 
01:08:36.709 --> 01:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
in berlin 65 000
 
01:08:38.950 --> 01:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
and they're spending almost twenty six
 
01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars in um in property taxes
 
01:08:45.030 --> 01:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
on that so so um you know i think as you
 
01:08:46.950 --> 01:08:46.960 align:start position:0%
go to the southern part of the state
 
01:08:48.390 --> 01:08:48.400 align:start position:0%
you're going to see median property
 
01:08:50.709 --> 01:08:50.719 align:start position:0%
taxes i'm sorry median property
 
01:08:53.269 --> 01:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
valuations being substantially higher
 
01:08:55.749 --> 01:08:55.759 align:start position:0%
than than 65 000 so i think it's
 
01:08:57.669 --> 01:08:57.679 align:start position:0%
important to look at all the data in
 
01:08:59.349 --> 01:08:59.359 align:start position:0%
those um
 
01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
in those spreadsheets
 
01:09:02.550 --> 01:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
the other the other thing that i think
 
01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
is is very important to know and i think
 
01:09:05.910 --> 01:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
this goes to points that were made by
 
01:09:08.309 --> 01:09:08.319 align:start position:0%
representatives moffett and baum
 
01:09:10.789 --> 01:09:10.799 align:start position:0%
who suggested that that look um we
 
01:09:13.349 --> 01:09:13.359 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be asking the taxpayers to uh
 
01:09:16.149 --> 01:09:16.159 align:start position:0%
to spend more money well first of all
 
01:09:17.910 --> 01:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers spend money in new
 
01:09:20.630 --> 01:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire on property taxes that's where
 
01:09:23.590 --> 01:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
it is it's not it's not state taxes
 
01:09:26.229 --> 01:09:26.239 align:start position:0%
um by and large it's property taxes for
 
01:09:28.149 --> 01:09:28.159 align:start position:0%
sure when it comes to schools
 
01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
and and what we're seeing in
 
01:09:33.430 --> 01:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
non-property tax state revenues
 
01:09:36.789 --> 01:09:36.799 align:start position:0%
going to going to schools or actually
 
01:09:39.189 --> 01:09:39.199 align:start position:0%
i don't want to say going to schools um
 
01:09:40.709 --> 01:09:40.719 align:start position:0%
in the uh in
 
01:09:43.349 --> 01:09:43.359 align:start position:0%
in the republican house budget
 
01:09:45.269 --> 01:09:45.279 align:start position:0%
is a hundred million dollars
 
01:09:49.510 --> 01:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
going to um um basically going for this
 
01:09:52.390 --> 01:09:52.400 align:start position:0%
like sweetheart swept tax cut
 
01:09:55.110 --> 01:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
uh that that that directs those monies
 
01:09:57.830 --> 01:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
to the uh to the most property wealthy
 
01:10:00.390 --> 01:10:00.400 align:start position:0%
communities and then an additional 36
 
01:10:02.950 --> 01:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
million dollars this would be the the 16
 
01:10:06.950 --> 01:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
million in fy 22 and 17 million in fy 23
 
01:10:09.590 --> 01:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
that uh that basically are are changes
 
01:10:13.030 --> 01:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
in the indexed um you know amount of of
 
01:10:14.630 --> 01:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
base adequacy and differential
 
01:10:16.950 --> 01:10:16.960 align:start position:0%
differentiate aid it doesn't it doesn't
 
01:10:19.270 --> 01:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
come anywhere close in either one of
 
01:10:20.470 --> 01:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
those years
 
01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
to what uh senator hennessey is
 
01:10:25.189 --> 01:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
proposing in senate bill 14135
 
01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
which is 45 million dollars just to
 
01:10:30.470 --> 01:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
cover the basic adequacy
 
01:10:33.990 --> 01:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
losses as a result of the um of the of
 
01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.390 align:start position:0%
losses as a result of the um of the of
pandemic

01:10:36.390 --> 01:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
01:10:38.470 --> 01:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
enrollment shifts temporary pandemic
 
01:10:40.790 --> 01:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
enrollment shifts so
 
01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:41.910 align:start position:0%
enrollment shifts so
so

01:10:41.910 --> 01:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:10:44.550 --> 01:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
of of that total 100 million dollars
 
01:10:50.630 --> 01:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:53.669 --> 01:10:53.679 align:start position:0%
all of it directed towards towards
 
01:10:53.679 --> 01:10:55.350 align:start position:0%
all of it directed towards towards
towards

01:10:55.350 --> 01:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
towards
 
01:10:57.750 --> 01:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
skewing towards the property wealthy
 
01:10:57.760 --> 01:10:59.110 align:start position:0%
skewing towards the property wealthy
communities

01:10:59.110 --> 01:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
communities
 
01:11:01.510 --> 01:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
certainly not directed at all towards
 
01:11:03.669 --> 01:11:03.679 align:start position:0%
towards where the where the re-state
 
01:11:06.229 --> 01:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
resources are needed most
 
01:11:06.239 --> 01:11:07.430 align:start position:0%
resources are needed most
is

01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
is not at all consistent with i think
 
01:11:12.870 --> 01:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
good government uh fiscal policy in fact
 
01:11:15.590 --> 01:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's it's government waste
 
01:11:18.790 --> 01:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
and um and what we uh what what i hope
 
01:11:20.070 --> 01:11:20.080 align:start position:0%
this this
 
01:11:22.550 --> 01:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
you know committee will do
 
01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:23.270 align:start position:0%
you know committee will do
is

01:11:23.270 --> 01:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:11:26.709 --> 01:11:26.719 align:start position:0%
is open the door to letting us introduce
 
01:11:29.750 --> 01:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
the the three amendments that uh that
 
01:11:32.709 --> 01:11:32.719 align:start position:0%
don't even total up uh at 136 million
 
01:11:34.870 --> 01:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
dollars so it's actually less than what
 
01:11:37.270 --> 01:11:37.280 align:start position:0%
than what you're spending right now in
 
01:11:40.149 --> 01:11:40.159 align:start position:0%
in house bill 2. and uh and directs that
 
01:11:42.709 --> 01:11:42.719 align:start position:0%
money to where it's needed and and just
 
01:11:46.310 --> 01:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
to use you know um berlin as an example
 
01:11:47.750 --> 01:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:11:49.510 --> 01:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
the the house budget
 
01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:50.550 align:start position:0%
the the house budget
um

01:11:50.550 --> 01:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:53.990 --> 01:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
directs 34 in tax savings on that on
 
01:11:56.630 --> 01:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
that median property in berlin only in
 
01:12:00.310 --> 01:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
fy 23. only in fy 23
 
01:12:03.270 --> 01:12:03.280 align:start position:0%
as opposed to 260
 
01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
in tax savings both in fy 22 and another
 
01:12:12.470 --> 01:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
260 dollars in fy 23 so over 500 in tax
 
01:12:15.270 --> 01:12:15.280 align:start position:0%
savings and you see the exact same thing
 
01:12:18.229 --> 01:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
in pittsfield where the the republican
 
01:12:18.239 --> 01:12:20.310 align:start position:0%
in pittsfield where the the republican
budget

01:12:20.310 --> 01:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:12:25.110 --> 01:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
generates 67 in tax savings fy23 only on
 
01:12:28.149 --> 01:12:28.159 align:start position:0%
the median priced home in pittsfield of
 
01:12:31.350 --> 01:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
149 950
 
01:12:33.510 --> 01:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
the amendments that we've got would
 
01:12:38.070 --> 01:12:38.080 align:start position:0%
direct 448 dollars in in tax savings on
 
01:12:41.910 --> 01:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
that same median priced home in fy22 and
 
01:12:45.709 --> 01:12:45.719 align:start position:0%
that same 448 dollars again in
 
01:12:48.950 --> 01:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
fy23 and it all does it
 
01:12:52.310 --> 01:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
with with actually less money than than
 
01:12:53.990 --> 01:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
than the then the state's currently
 
01:12:56.709 --> 01:12:56.719 align:start position:0%
pushing to uh to newcastle rye
 
01:13:00.390 --> 01:13:00.400 align:start position:0%
portsmouth um you know and uh and and
 
01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
communities that
 
01:13:04.470 --> 01:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
that have much much less need than uh
 
01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
than others across the state so um
 
01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
i you know i think i think
 
01:13:11.910 --> 01:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
let's let's make sure when we're when if
 
01:13:13.350 --> 01:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
people are saying well we shouldn't be
 
01:13:16.070 --> 01:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
asking the taxpayers to do more well
 
01:13:19.510 --> 01:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
first of all we're not by by uh by
 
01:13:22.470 --> 01:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
adopting these amendments uh because the
 
01:13:24.470 --> 01:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
the money's already in the state budget
 
01:13:27.110 --> 01:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
to do this and secondly if you if you go
 
01:13:29.510 --> 01:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
to retain it we are in fact asking the
 
01:13:32.310 --> 01:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
taxpayers to do more and they and they
 
01:13:34.870 --> 01:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
understand that they know that they'll
 
01:13:35.990 --> 01:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
they'll certainly know when they see
 
01:13:38.149 --> 01:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
their tax bills
 
01:13:39.189 --> 01:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:13:39.199 --> 01:13:42.630 align:start position:0%
thank you
tanner

01:13:42.630 --> 01:13:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:45.030 --> 01:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i not only are the
 
01:13:46.390 --> 01:13:46.400 align:start position:0%
house values
 
01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:47.270 align:start position:0%
house values
different

01:13:47.270 --> 01:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:13:48.870 --> 01:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
uh and have to be taken into
 
01:13:51.910 --> 01:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
consideration but not not all students
 
01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:53.110 align:start position:0%
consideration but not not all students
achieve

01:13:53.110 --> 01:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
achieve
 
01:13:55.270 --> 01:13:55.280 align:start position:0%
based on the same resources
 
01:13:57.990 --> 01:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
and in these poor communities the
 
01:14:01.669 --> 01:14:01.679 align:start position:0%
property poor communities oftentimes uh
 
01:14:04.709 --> 01:14:04.719 align:start position:0%
with high free and reduced hot lunch or
 
01:14:04.719 --> 01:14:06.390 align:start position:0%
with high free and reduced hot lunch or
they

01:14:06.390 --> 01:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:14:08.790 --> 01:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
they have a significant amount of
 
01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:10.550 align:start position:0%
they have a significant amount of
poverty

01:14:10.550 --> 01:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
poverty
 
01:14:13.669 --> 01:14:13.679 align:start position:0%
there's the students from those areas
 
01:14:15.590 --> 01:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
take more resources
 
01:14:18.229 --> 01:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
and even though the student population
 
01:14:19.910 --> 01:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
is decreasing
 
01:14:23.270 --> 01:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
uh in some of these areas the the need
 
01:14:25.910 --> 01:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
and the cost for their education is
 
01:14:27.189 --> 01:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
going up
 
01:14:29.430 --> 01:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
and one of the great things about the
 
01:14:32.470 --> 01:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
commission report was that it flipped us
 
01:14:34.229 --> 01:14:34.239 align:start position:0%
from thinking about
 
01:14:36.070 --> 01:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
how many people
 
01:14:39.669 --> 01:14:39.679 align:start position:0%
how many deaths how many students we
 
01:14:40.950 --> 01:14:40.960 align:start position:0%
flip that
 
01:14:42.550 --> 01:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
to what does it take for student
 
01:14:45.189 --> 01:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
achievement to bring everybody in their
 
01:14:45.199 --> 01:14:46.229 align:start position:0%
achievement to bring everybody in their
state

01:14:46.229 --> 01:14:46.239 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:14:49.030 --> 01:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
up to a level of student achievement
 
01:14:51.350 --> 01:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
that we will be proud of
 
01:14:53.110 --> 01:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
and i'm proud that new hampshire is in
 
01:14:54.950 --> 01:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
the top ten
 
01:14:57.430 --> 01:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
and i'm proud to have taught at a school
 
01:14:59.669 --> 01:14:59.679 align:start position:0%
that was in
 
01:15:03.030 --> 01:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
the upper echelon of student achievement
 
01:15:05.910 --> 01:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
but we had tremendous resources and i
 
01:15:08.630 --> 01:15:08.640 align:start position:0%
can just drive 10 15 miles away from my
 
01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:09.430 align:start position:0%
can just drive 10 15 miles away from my
home

01:15:09.430 --> 01:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
home
 
01:15:11.270 --> 01:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
and go to another school
 
01:15:13.030 --> 01:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
that's in the bottom
 
01:15:15.430 --> 01:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
of the achievement bracket and it's not
 
01:15:17.510 --> 01:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
because the teachers aren't trying
 
01:15:19.910 --> 01:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
it's not because the school
 
01:15:22.950 --> 01:15:22.960 align:start position:0%
isn't trying it's because they need
 
01:15:24.870 --> 01:15:24.880 align:start position:0%
additional resources
 
01:15:26.630 --> 01:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
and they have
 
01:15:30.149 --> 01:15:30.159 align:start position:0%
melt their property taxes to the highest
 
01:15:32.149 --> 01:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
level that that
 
01:15:34.630 --> 01:15:34.640 align:start position:0%
that people just can't can't tolerate
 
01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:35.990 align:start position:0%
that people just can't can't tolerate
anymore

01:15:35.990 --> 01:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:36.790 align:start position:0%
anymore
and

01:15:36.790 --> 01:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
it also economically affects their town
 
01:15:43.270 --> 01:15:43.280 align:start position:0%
when the school is not achieving
 
01:15:44.709 --> 01:15:44.719 align:start position:0%
the town doesn't
 
01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
you know people don't come into the town
 
01:15:48.550 --> 01:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
people come into towns because they want
 
01:15:50.390 --> 01:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
a good school system for their student
 
01:15:53.669 --> 01:15:53.679 align:start position:0%
for their children and
 
01:15:56.550 --> 01:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
it affects businesses it expects the
 
01:15:59.189 --> 01:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
real estate of that town it it affects
 
01:16:01.270 --> 01:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
the the people in that town after a
 
01:16:03.350 --> 01:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
while they just get beaten down
 
01:16:05.590 --> 01:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
and if we can do something about it and
 
01:16:07.669 --> 01:16:07.679 align:start position:0%
we can do something about it right now
 
01:16:11.110 --> 01:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
and as representative luna said at
 
01:16:14.470 --> 01:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
equal or even less cost but just
 
01:16:16.250 --> 01:16:16.260 align:start position:0%
with some disparity um
 
01:16:16.260 --> 01:16:17.430 align:start position:0%
with some disparity um
[Music]

01:16:17.430 --> 01:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:16:19.910 --> 01:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
aid then we should do it and we should
 
01:16:22.149 --> 01:16:22.159 align:start position:0%
at least look at it now
 
01:16:25.590 --> 01:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
and consider it which would be
 
01:16:28.310 --> 01:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
letting him put his amendments in but
 
01:16:30.790 --> 01:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
even more than that let's do something
 
01:16:33.430 --> 01:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
now we did something last term
 
01:16:35.350 --> 01:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
that made a difference let's do
 
01:16:38.950 --> 01:16:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:40.950 align:start position:0%
 
represented

01:16:40.950 --> 01:16:40.960 align:start position:0%
represented
 
01:16:42.630 --> 01:16:42.640 align:start position:0%
yeah i
 
01:16:45.990 --> 01:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
very much realized that housing
 
01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
values are much higher in the south of
 
01:16:50.950 --> 01:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
the state which is why i wanted this
 
01:16:52.790 --> 01:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
printed up because
 
01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
my point was that it's not the housing
 
01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:56.229 align:start position:0%
my point was that it's not the housing
value

01:16:56.229 --> 01:16:56.239 align:start position:0%
value
 
01:16:59.510 --> 01:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
that matters because my 200 year old
 
01:17:01.430 --> 01:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
farmhouse is still a 200 year old
 
01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:02.470 align:start position:0%
farmhouse is still a 200 year old
farmhouse

01:17:02.470 --> 01:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
farmhouse
 
01:17:05.669 --> 01:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
and its value has skyrocketed just
 
01:17:07.669 --> 01:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
because i live in the southern part of
 
01:17:10.550 --> 01:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
the state people want to move in which
 
01:17:13.350 --> 01:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
all that says is right now there is a
 
01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:14.310 align:start position:0%
all that says is right now there is a
small

01:17:14.310 --> 01:17:14.320 align:start position:0%
small
 
01:17:16.870 --> 01:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
amount of houses available and a small
 
01:17:19.669 --> 01:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
number of people who make a lot of money
 
01:17:21.830 --> 01:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
moving in but i will tell you while we
 
01:17:24.870 --> 01:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
are well above average on property value
 
01:17:26.950 --> 01:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
we are also above average on free and
 
01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:28.320 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch
 
01:17:31.510 --> 01:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
so just because some houses are selling
 
01:17:33.350 --> 01:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
at a high amount of money which brings
 
01:17:35.669 --> 01:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
the property value
 
01:17:38.550 --> 01:17:38.560 align:start position:0%
up across the entire town doesn't mean
 
01:17:40.310 --> 01:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
people are making more money doesn't
 
01:17:43.189 --> 01:17:43.199 align:start position:0%
mean people can afford more to spend in
 
01:17:43.199 --> 01:17:44.550 align:start position:0%
mean people can afford more to spend in
taxes

01:17:44.550 --> 01:17:44.560 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
01:17:47.750 --> 01:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
it just means that at the moment we have
 
01:17:49.510 --> 01:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
a housing shortage in the southern part
 
01:17:51.110 --> 01:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
of the state and people are willing to
 
01:17:53.350 --> 01:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
pay a lot of money the people who are
 
01:17:55.270 --> 01:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
moving which is a small portion of the
 
01:17:57.430 --> 01:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
people who live there
 
01:17:59.590 --> 01:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
are moving in and driving by housing
 
01:18:03.110 --> 01:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
prices up my house value only matters if
 
01:18:06.470 --> 01:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
i sell it and move in the meantime
 
01:18:09.189 --> 01:18:09.199 align:start position:0%
i pay taxes based on that current value
 
01:18:12.229 --> 01:18:12.239 align:start position:0%
so what i'm saying is the values are not
 
01:18:12.239 --> 01:18:13.189 align:start position:0%
so what i'm saying is the values are not
equal

01:18:13.189 --> 01:18:13.199 align:start position:0%
equal
 
01:18:15.510 --> 01:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
from one part of the state to the other
 
01:18:18.470 --> 01:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
a same house the same house in the
 
01:18:19.830 --> 01:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
southern part of the state is going to
 
01:18:22.630 --> 01:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
be valued much higher than the exact
 
01:18:24.390 --> 01:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
same house in the northern part of the
 
01:18:26.630 --> 01:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
state doesn't say anything about what my
 
01:18:29.030 --> 01:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
income is what their income is whether
 
01:18:32.390 --> 01:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
what my tax is what their taxes
 
01:18:34.390 --> 01:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
and that's why i wanted to actually be
 
01:18:35.910 --> 01:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
able to compare
 
01:18:37.590 --> 01:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
taxes paid
 
01:18:39.270 --> 01:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
01:18:41.350 --> 01:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
what might somebody made up for the
 
01:18:44.630 --> 01:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
value of my house which has skyrocketed
 
01:18:47.110 --> 01:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
since i've lived in the same town all
 
01:18:49.350 --> 01:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
these years but i'm not going to get any
 
01:18:51.750 --> 01:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
money out of that until i move which i
 
01:18:55.110 --> 01:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
may die in that house so i may never see
 
01:18:57.830 --> 01:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
that increased valuation
 
01:18:59.750 --> 01:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
and so my point is
 
01:19:02.470 --> 01:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
property value is not the thing to be
 
01:19:03.669 --> 01:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
01:19:06.550 --> 01:19:06.560 align:start position:0%
when we're trying to figure this out
 
01:19:09.669 --> 01:19:09.679 align:start position:0%
a much i mean if we could do
 
01:19:09.679 --> 01:19:10.790 align:start position:0%
a much i mean if we could do
income

01:19:10.790 --> 01:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
income
 
01:19:12.229 --> 01:19:12.239 align:start position:0%
that'd be great but we don't have those
 
01:19:14.149 --> 01:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
numbers but what we have is free and
 
01:19:16.709 --> 01:19:16.719 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch which takes the place of
 
01:19:19.030 --> 01:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
that so free and reduced lunch i think
 
01:19:21.910 --> 01:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
is a much better
 
01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:23.030 align:start position:0%
is a much better
metric

01:19:23.030 --> 01:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
metric
 
01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:24.070 align:start position:0%
metric
for

01:19:24.070 --> 01:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
how much
 
01:19:28.709 --> 01:19:28.719 align:start position:0%
aid is needed for instance in nashua
 
01:19:31.669 --> 01:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
same taxing same school district same
 
01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
everything but as you were talking about
 
01:19:37.189 --> 01:19:37.199 align:start position:0%
how students perform yes they perform
 
01:19:40.950 --> 01:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
very differently from one part of that
 
01:19:42.790 --> 01:19:42.800 align:start position:0%
city to another even though it's the
 
01:19:44.950 --> 01:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
same school board
 
01:19:47.350 --> 01:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
it's the same taxing rate it's the same
 
01:19:50.070 --> 01:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
entity and yet one neighborhood does
 
01:19:51.669 --> 01:19:51.679 align:start position:0%
very different than another but one of
 
01:19:53.270 --> 01:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
the things you'll see different between
 
01:19:55.350 --> 01:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
them is free and reduced lunch
 
01:19:57.669 --> 01:19:57.679 align:start position:0%
percentages so that makes it much
 
01:19:57.679 --> 01:20:00.390 align:start position:0%
percentages so that makes it much
because

01:20:00.390 --> 01:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:02.870 --> 01:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
mostly because of the amount of
 
01:20:05.590 --> 01:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
attention that the students get at home
 
01:20:07.189 --> 01:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
the amount of education that the
 
01:20:08.790 --> 01:20:08.800 align:start position:0%
students get at home the largest
 
01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
predictor in nashua of how students do
 
01:20:12.550 --> 01:20:12.560 align:start position:0%
in school
 
01:20:14.950 --> 01:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
is actually the education level of the
 
01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:16.470 align:start position:0%
is actually the education level of the
parents

01:20:16.470 --> 01:20:16.480 align:start position:0%
parents
 
01:20:20.709 --> 01:20:20.719 align:start position:0%
and so yes we need to make up for that
 
01:20:20.719 --> 01:20:21.510 align:start position:0%
and so yes we need to make up for that
but

01:20:21.510 --> 01:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:20:23.750 --> 01:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
how do you tell whether this community
 
01:20:26.149 --> 01:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
and that that city or that community in
 
01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
that city is going to get more or less
 
01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:29.510 align:start position:0%
that city is going to get more or less
money

01:20:29.510 --> 01:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:20:31.830 --> 01:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
um to make up for the difference in
 
01:20:33.590 --> 01:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
attention that those kids are getting at
 
01:20:36.550 --> 01:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
home free and reduced lunch makes a much
 
01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:37.510 align:start position:0%
home free and reduced lunch makes a much
better

01:20:37.510 --> 01:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
better
 
01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:39.189 align:start position:0%
better
um

01:20:39.189 --> 01:20:39.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
metric for that and so that
 
01:20:44.790 --> 01:20:44.800 align:start position:0%
i'm you know the part of this bill that
 
01:20:47.030 --> 01:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
deals with free and reduced lunch on all
 
01:20:49.590 --> 01:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
four it's the part that has to do with
 
01:20:51.830 --> 01:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
property valuation and all of that
 
01:20:53.510 --> 01:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
because i think those are artificial
 
01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:54.550 align:start position:0%
because i think those are artificial
numbers

01:20:54.550 --> 01:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:55.510 align:start position:0%
numbers
um

01:20:55.510 --> 01:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:57.350 --> 01:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
as in
 
01:20:59.910 --> 01:20:59.920 align:start position:0%
related much less to what people make
 
01:21:01.990 --> 01:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
much less to what type of house and much
 
01:21:03.189 --> 01:21:03.199 align:start position:0%
more to
 
01:21:03.199 --> 01:21:04.790 align:start position:0%
more to
how

01:21:04.790 --> 01:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
how
 
01:21:07.270 --> 01:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
desirable that and how
 
01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:21:12.070 --> 01:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
how few homes are available for sale and
 
01:21:15.110 --> 01:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
how much valuable those homes are how
 
01:21:17.110 --> 01:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
much people want to move into that area
 
01:21:19.430 --> 01:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
more than anything so that's
 
01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:22.229 align:start position:0%
more than anything so that's
anyway

01:21:22.229 --> 01:21:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:25.350 --> 01:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
as a committee representative like us
 
01:21:27.830 --> 01:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
and i'll just reflect again back to hb
 
01:21:30.709 --> 01:21:30.719 align:start position:0%
242 and i'm going to read that bill that
 
01:21:32.310 --> 01:21:32.320 align:start position:0%
passed this house
 
01:21:35.189 --> 01:21:35.199 align:start position:0%
and has gone to the senate there
 
01:21:36.870 --> 01:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
there's a portion of that bill addressed
 
01:21:38.870 --> 01:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
exactly what you just said represented
 
01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:40.070 align:start position:0%
exactly what you just said represented
like

01:21:40.070 --> 01:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:21:41.990 --> 01:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
it says the cost of physical capacity
 
01:21:44.149 --> 01:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
disparity is a separate grant from
 
01:21:45.990 --> 01:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
adequacy and shall be provided to
 
01:21:47.990 --> 01:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities with the lowest equalized
 
01:21:49.830 --> 01:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
property valuation
 
01:21:51.590 --> 01:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
that's not where you're going but it
 
01:21:54.790 --> 01:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
says that it also goes on
 
01:21:56.790 --> 01:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
an additional disparity achievement
 
01:21:59.430 --> 01:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
proficiency increase grant shall be
 
01:22:01.510 --> 01:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
provided to eligible school districts
 
01:22:03.830 --> 01:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
schools and charter public schools to
 
01:22:06.149 --> 01:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
improve academic achievement and growth
 
01:22:08.390 --> 01:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
of level one and level two proficiency
 
01:22:11.110 --> 01:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
students has identified in the annual
 
01:22:14.470 --> 01:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
statewide assessment pursuant to the rsa
 
01:22:17.590 --> 01:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
that level one and two there's a direct
 
01:22:19.750 --> 01:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
relationship between
 
01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:21.030 align:start position:0%
relationship between
poverty

01:22:21.030 --> 01:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
poverty
 
01:22:22.629 --> 01:22:22.639 align:start position:0%
free and reduced
 
01:22:24.310 --> 01:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
where students students on the lowest
 
01:22:28.149 --> 01:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
two uh levels of that test one and two
 
01:22:31.430 --> 01:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
and so we recognize towns like city
 
01:22:33.990 --> 01:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
towns areas like portsmouth
 
01:22:37.189 --> 01:22:37.199 align:start position:0%
have these large pools of kids which are
 
01:22:38.470 --> 01:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
not achieving
 
01:22:41.030 --> 01:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
that come to have a handicap of some
 
01:22:43.830 --> 01:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
kind or have a disability of some kind
 
01:22:45.990 --> 01:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
or that have an issue where they're not
 
01:22:49.830 --> 01:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
achieving and that bill as we propose
 
01:22:53.590 --> 01:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
tried to address both areas
 
01:22:56.070 --> 01:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
the property valuation reputable and
 
01:22:58.310 --> 01:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
those other areas which represent like
 
01:22:59.830 --> 01:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
this is talking about
 
01:23:01.510 --> 01:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
we have done that in our policy
 
01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:02.709 align:start position:0%
we have done that in our policy
statement

01:23:02.709 --> 01:23:02.719 align:start position:0%
statement
 
01:23:04.629 --> 01:23:04.639 align:start position:0%
and here we are rehashing saying this is
 
01:23:06.790 --> 01:23:06.800 align:start position:0%
what we gotta do we did it
 
01:23:09.510 --> 01:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
as a policy committee we've done it
 
01:23:12.070 --> 01:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
so now it's up to the whole house and
 
01:23:14.550 --> 01:23:14.560 align:start position:0%
others to make sure that we get some
 
01:23:16.950 --> 01:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
physical capacity security aid built in
 
01:23:18.790 --> 01:23:18.800 align:start position:0%
and we don't have any more stabilization
 
01:23:21.590 --> 01:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
in the future represent our syrian still
 
01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:25.189 align:start position:0%
in the future represent our syrian still
up

01:23:25.189 --> 01:23:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:27.350 --> 01:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
you're muted
 
01:23:28.390 --> 01:23:28.400 align:start position:0%
i just
 
01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:29.110 align:start position:0%
i just
well

01:23:29.110 --> 01:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:23:31.430 --> 01:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
i um i think uh one of the things
 
01:23:33.669 --> 01:23:33.679 align:start position:0%
representative lakers is pointing out is
 
01:23:36.229 --> 01:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
how regressive property taxes are
 
01:23:39.990 --> 01:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
and i hope um that she sees that and
 
01:23:41.590 --> 01:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
perhaps uh
 
01:23:43.830 --> 01:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
looks at maybe another way with a tax
 
01:23:53.750 --> 01:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:55.590 --> 01:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
that's probably a great reason to retain
 
01:23:57.350 --> 01:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
this bill if we're looking to larger
 
01:23:59.669 --> 01:23:59.679 align:start position:0%
things like changing how education is
 
01:24:01.830 --> 01:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
funded or which taxes
 
01:24:03.669 --> 01:24:03.679 align:start position:0%
let's retain this we have the language
 
01:24:06.390 --> 01:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
we need for the pre-reduced lunch in the
 
01:24:08.390 --> 01:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
budget the senate should probably keep
 
01:24:10.149 --> 01:24:10.159 align:start position:0%
it since this is senator henderson's
 
01:24:12.550 --> 01:24:12.560 align:start position:0%
bill i don't think that this language to
 
01:24:14.550 --> 01:24:14.560 align:start position:0%
make these districts full for introduced
 
01:24:17.030 --> 01:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
lunch is at risk but by retaining this
 
01:24:18.790 --> 01:24:18.800 align:start position:0%
we can start looking at things because
 
01:24:20.790 --> 01:24:20.800 align:start position:0%
there's a clear difference of opinion
 
01:24:22.070 --> 01:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
and we're not going to hammer this out
 
01:24:24.070 --> 01:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
today even if we stay tuned no we're not
 
01:24:26.229 --> 01:24:26.239 align:start position:0%
going to hamper it out today and
 
01:24:28.870 --> 01:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
by retaining it those bills are not dead
 
01:24:31.350 --> 01:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
the bill it can be worked on and and
 
01:24:35.510 --> 01:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
brought back along with 608 so
 
01:24:39.350 --> 01:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
if they don't have anymore fy22
 
01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:40.310 align:start position:0%
if they don't have anymore fy22
army

01:24:40.310 --> 01:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
army
 
01:24:46.390 --> 01:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:49.510 --> 01:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
i just was was wondering if um the
 
01:24:51.910 --> 01:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
issues that you're talking about weren't
 
01:24:55.350 --> 01:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
discussed in the commission that worked
 
01:24:57.590 --> 01:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
over the last year i i was under the
 
01:24:59.990 --> 01:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
understanding that those kinds of issues
 
01:25:02.229 --> 01:25:02.239 align:start position:0%
were what was the focus of that
 
01:25:02.239 --> 01:25:04.629 align:start position:0%
were what was the focus of that
commission

01:25:04.629 --> 01:25:04.639 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:25:06.790 --> 01:25:06.800 align:start position:0%
to keep this another year to look at
 
01:25:07.990 --> 01:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
those same things that were already
 
01:25:10.149 --> 01:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
looked at
 
01:25:12.229 --> 01:25:12.239 align:start position:0%
through the work of that commission
 
01:25:12.239 --> 01:25:13.669 align:start position:0%
through the work of that commission
seems

01:25:13.669 --> 01:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
seems
 
01:25:17.590 --> 01:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:19.590 --> 01:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much i was a member
 
01:25:22.629 --> 01:25:22.639 align:start position:0%
of that commission and of course i was
 
01:25:25.270 --> 01:25:25.280 align:start position:0%
16 i was the one
 
01:25:27.750 --> 01:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
it was just a matter of fact that and
 
01:25:29.430 --> 01:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
we've spoken about it today there's
 
01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:31.110 align:start position:0%
we've spoken about it today there's
different

01:25:31.110 --> 01:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:25:33.350 --> 01:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
ways to put that budget together i
 
01:25:34.870 --> 01:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
believe in an input
 
01:25:36.790 --> 01:25:36.800 align:start position:0%
system not based upon
 
01:25:38.470 --> 01:25:38.480 align:start position:0%
uh some
 
01:25:41.669 --> 01:25:41.679 align:start position:0%
figure that's just extrapolated from the
 
01:25:41.679 --> 01:25:43.590 align:start position:0%
figure that's just extrapolated from the
uh

01:25:43.590 --> 01:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:25:47.350 --> 01:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
doe 25 form which includes uh costs
 
01:25:49.590 --> 01:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
which are above and beyond what i
 
01:25:51.750 --> 01:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
believe is an adequate education
 
01:25:53.990 --> 01:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
and so the figures that have been used
 
01:25:56.790 --> 01:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
in some cases are figures that are
 
01:25:58.870 --> 01:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
higher than they should be
 
01:26:01.830 --> 01:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
and are not necessarily just you know
 
01:26:03.910 --> 01:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
adequacy it could be a marching band the
 
01:26:06.310 --> 01:26:06.320 align:start position:0%
cost of that that is in that commission
 
01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:07.430 align:start position:0%
cost of that that is in that commission
report

01:26:07.430 --> 01:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
report
 
01:26:08.550 --> 01:26:08.560 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
01:26:10.950 --> 01:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
but they're they're i'm not negating the
 
01:26:12.790 --> 01:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
commission report and finance all the
 
01:26:14.550 --> 01:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
way through there are a lot of good
 
01:26:16.790 --> 01:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
things which were discussed
 
01:26:19.270 --> 01:26:19.280 align:start position:0%
and uh and there's some rules i was
 
01:26:21.590 --> 01:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
reflected in 242
 
01:26:23.750 --> 01:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
and we we
 
01:26:25.669 --> 01:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
have sent the message
 
01:26:28.629 --> 01:26:28.639 align:start position:0%
uh it's now a matter of uh
 
01:26:30.950 --> 01:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
i think polis has basically done our job
 
01:26:33.189 --> 01:26:33.199 align:start position:0%
we can still do more work
 
01:26:36.470 --> 01:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
on 608 and and
 
01:26:39.830 --> 01:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
this bill itself uh 135
 
01:26:43.750 --> 01:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
the the bill which we had in uh 608 we
 
01:26:45.510 --> 01:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
just did not have the time because it
 
01:26:47.189 --> 01:26:47.199 align:start position:0%
was an early bill
 
01:26:49.750 --> 01:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
and the formula which we had the funding
 
01:26:52.629 --> 01:26:52.639 align:start position:0%
formula we received
 
01:26:54.629 --> 01:26:54.639 align:start position:0%
information on that almost the day that
 
01:26:56.709 --> 01:26:56.719 align:start position:0%
we were taking action on it
 
01:27:00.550 --> 01:27:00.560 align:start position:0%
so this committee flat ran out of time
 
01:27:03.030 --> 01:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
so at this point in time
 
01:27:04.470 --> 01:27:04.480 align:start position:0%
i'm going to just take a couple more
 
01:27:06.550 --> 01:27:06.560 align:start position:0%
hands and then we're going to have a
 
01:27:08.709 --> 01:27:08.719 align:start position:0%
vote here because we have other bills
 
01:27:11.030 --> 01:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
today omnibus bills which have various
 
01:27:12.310 --> 01:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
parts to them
 
01:27:16.310 --> 01:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:18.149 --> 01:27:18.159 align:start position:0%
first first of all i'd like to say this
 
01:27:20.149 --> 01:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
is one of the most important bills that
 
01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
we're reviewing today because it makes a
 
01:27:25.830 --> 01:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
significant difference next year
 
01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:26.709 align:start position:0%
significant difference next year
um

01:27:26.709 --> 01:27:26.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:29.110 --> 01:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
and i would strongly recommend that we
 
01:27:30.870 --> 01:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
vote down the retain
 
01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:31.669 align:start position:0%
vote down the retain
uh

01:27:31.669 --> 01:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:27:34.070 --> 01:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
motion and put an ought to pass motion
 
01:27:36.950 --> 01:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
on the bill so that we can at least hear
 
01:27:39.990 --> 01:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
representatives luna's amendments
 
01:27:42.470 --> 01:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
and then if you folks still think or
 
01:27:44.310 --> 01:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
certain folks on the committee still
 
01:27:47.669 --> 01:27:47.679 align:start position:0%
think that we're you know not going to
 
01:27:49.430 --> 01:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
to do this they can then
 
01:27:52.390 --> 01:27:52.400 align:start position:0%
uh vote that ought to pass bill down or
 
01:27:54.790 --> 01:27:54.800 align:start position:0%
motion down and we can have another
 
01:27:56.629 --> 01:27:56.639 align:start position:0%
motion in its place
 
01:27:59.510 --> 01:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
um but i think to to retain this bill is
 
01:28:02.229 --> 01:28:02.239 align:start position:0%
to kill this bill and it certainly kills
 
01:28:03.990 --> 01:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh hope
 
01:28:05.910 --> 01:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
for many communities
 
01:28:08.390 --> 01:28:08.400 align:start position:0%
many school districts and like i said
 
01:28:10.229 --> 01:28:10.239 align:start position:0%
it's not just the school we're talking
 
01:28:11.430 --> 01:28:11.440 align:start position:0%
about how
 
01:28:13.189 --> 01:28:13.199 align:start position:0%
the property tax
 
01:28:15.590 --> 01:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
and what happens at the school
 
01:28:18.310 --> 01:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
affects the community and the economics
 
01:28:20.790 --> 01:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
of that community so
 
01:28:23.350 --> 01:28:23.360 align:start position:0%
i would i would strongly urge
 
01:28:24.390 --> 01:28:24.400 align:start position:0%
that we
 
01:28:26.390 --> 01:28:26.400 align:start position:0%
vote down retain
 
01:28:28.390 --> 01:28:28.400 align:start position:0%
listen to the amendments and then if you
 
01:28:30.709 --> 01:28:30.719 align:start position:0%
then after that if you still can't deal
 
01:28:32.149 --> 01:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
with this bill
 
01:28:34.310 --> 01:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
then itl or vote against the ought to
 
01:28:36.950 --> 01:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
pass and put an itl up on it um to
 
01:28:39.590 --> 01:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
retain it uh is just not only kicking it
 
01:28:41.030 --> 01:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
down the road but it's a kick in the
 
01:28:42.550 --> 01:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
face to the people that have to deal
 
01:28:44.149 --> 01:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
with this next year
 
01:28:44.159 --> 01:28:45.669 align:start position:0%
with this next year
representative

01:28:45.669 --> 01:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:28:47.510 --> 01:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
no thank you mr chair
 
01:28:49.910 --> 01:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
and i would concur with uh the words of
 
01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:50.790 align:start position:0%
and i would concur with uh the words of
uh

01:28:50.790 --> 01:28:50.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:28:52.709 --> 01:28:52.719 align:start position:0%
representative tanner
 
01:28:54.550 --> 01:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
earlier in this session
 
01:28:57.110 --> 01:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
i requested of the of you and this
 
01:28:57.120 --> 01:28:58.390 align:start position:0%
i requested of the of you and this
committee

01:28:58.390 --> 01:28:58.400 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:29:00.470 --> 01:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
to hear a full briefing
 
01:29:01.590 --> 01:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
on the
 
01:29:03.350 --> 01:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
school funding commission
 
01:29:04.950 --> 01:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
that was tonight
 
01:29:06.709 --> 01:29:06.719 align:start position:0%
in fact we had time
 
01:29:09.030 --> 01:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
we've had time this month
 
01:29:11.110 --> 01:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
to have that briefing
 
01:29:12.790 --> 01:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
so now what we're being asked to do is
 
01:29:15.270 --> 01:29:15.280 align:start position:0%
to retain a bill where we could have had
 
01:29:17.430 --> 01:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
that time to really look at the school
 
01:29:20.470 --> 01:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
funding i would remind this committee
 
01:29:25.510 --> 01:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:28.470 --> 01:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
to accept this commission's report
 
01:29:31.990 --> 01:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
it fundamentally changes how we fairly
 
01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:33.270 align:start position:0%
it fundamentally changes how we fairly
allocate

01:29:33.270 --> 01:29:33.280 align:start position:0%
allocate
 
01:29:36.149 --> 01:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
current school funding
 
01:29:38.390 --> 01:29:38.400 align:start position:0%
not additional school funding current
 
01:29:40.070 --> 01:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
school funding
 
01:29:41.830 --> 01:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the
 
01:29:45.430 --> 01:29:45.440 align:start position:0%
disparities that exist in our state
 
01:29:48.950 --> 01:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
kids are not having a chance to fairly
 
01:29:51.189 --> 01:29:51.199 align:start position:0%
have an equitable education as other
 
01:29:51.199 --> 01:29:52.550 align:start position:0%
have an equitable education as other
students

01:29:52.550 --> 01:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:29:54.790 --> 01:29:54.800 align:start position:0%
by retaining this bill
 
01:29:56.950 --> 01:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
we basically are saying to those
 
01:30:00.390 --> 01:30:00.400 align:start position:0%
districts that have disparities in it
 
01:30:03.430 --> 01:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
no problem we don't care
 
01:30:05.510 --> 01:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
for another year we're going to kick it
 
01:30:08.310 --> 01:30:08.320 align:start position:0%
down the road one more year and i'm sure
 
01:30:11.510 --> 01:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
we'll do it another time
 
01:30:13.430 --> 01:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
totally disappointed totally
 
01:30:16.709 --> 01:30:16.719 align:start position:0%
disappointed in this fundamental issue
 
01:30:20.149 --> 01:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
of tax relief and funding schools that
 
01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
this committee if they vote to retain
 
01:30:22.560 --> 01:30:23.590 align:start position:0%
this committee if they vote to retain
this

01:30:23.590 --> 01:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:30:26.070 --> 01:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
shirks their responsibility of making a
 
01:30:28.709 --> 01:30:28.719 align:start position:0%
public statement of what we think should
 
01:30:30.629 --> 01:30:30.639 align:start position:0%
be done with schools funding and tax
 
01:30:30.639 --> 01:30:32.629 align:start position:0%
be done with schools funding and tax
relief

01:30:32.629 --> 01:30:32.639 align:start position:0%
relief
 
01:30:34.629 --> 01:30:34.639 align:start position:0%
here i'm gonna take one more hand and
 
01:30:36.070 --> 01:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
then we're going to have
 
01:30:38.310 --> 01:30:38.320 align:start position:0%
to retain most representation
 
01:30:40.950 --> 01:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
my my question was to clarify what i
 
01:30:42.550 --> 01:30:42.560 align:start position:0%
wanted to do is clarify representative
 
01:30:45.510 --> 01:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
milo's statement that 16-1 vote on the
 
01:30:48.070 --> 01:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
commission was straight down party lines
 
01:30:50.310 --> 01:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
so i i i don't want anybody to think
 
01:30:51.910 --> 01:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
that that was a bipartisan point of
 
01:30:53.669 --> 01:30:53.679 align:start position:0%
order that's not yeah
 
01:30:56.229 --> 01:30:56.239 align:start position:0%
that's absolutely wrong that's incorrect
 
01:30:58.870 --> 01:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
that is absolutely incorrect
 
01:31:02.390 --> 01:31:02.400 align:start position:0%
party lines when we met as a commission
 
01:31:04.870 --> 01:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
we basically parked any political
 
01:31:06.790 --> 01:31:06.800 align:start position:0%
feelings we had at the door and we were
 
01:31:09.830 --> 01:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
focusing on students
 
01:31:11.910 --> 01:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
there were there were more
 
01:31:13.669 --> 01:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
republicans on that committee than just
 
01:31:15.990 --> 01:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
representative ladd believe me that's a
 
01:31:18.149 --> 01:31:18.159 align:start position:0%
totally erroneous statement including
 
01:31:19.910 --> 01:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
the governor's representative on the
 
01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:22.320 align:start position:0%

01:31:24.149 --> 01:31:24.159 align:start position:0%

01:31:38.470 --> 01:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
to the chair or to represent luna and
 
01:31:40.629 --> 01:31:40.639 align:start position:0%
asked could we think about putting more
 
01:31:43.030 --> 01:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
republicans and elected republicans on
 
01:31:45.510 --> 01:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
when the chair had the option to do so
 
01:31:47.510 --> 01:31:47.520 align:start position:0%

training um opposes it uh
 
01:36:42.870 --> 01:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
so i think that uh maybe
 
01:36:45.830 --> 01:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
though well-intentioned
 
01:36:47.350 --> 01:36:47.360 align:start position:0%
i think that this
 
01:36:51.030 --> 01:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
senate bill has many problems and should
 
01:36:55.430 --> 01:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:55.440 --> 01:36:56.550 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:36:56.550 --> 01:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:36:58.310 --> 01:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
yeah exactly
 
01:37:02.390 --> 01:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
yeah i agree with the ipl number one
 
01:37:03.510 --> 01:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:37:05.189 --> 01:37:05.199 align:start position:0%
i mean people through stimulus with
 
01:37:06.950 --> 01:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
money extra money
 
01:37:09.350 --> 01:37:09.360 align:start position:0%
for being on unemployment
 
01:37:12.950 --> 01:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
had money available to them to take the
 
01:37:14.470 --> 01:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
course that they needed for a
 
01:37:17.109 --> 01:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
certificate or a badge or whatever
 
01:37:19.189 --> 01:37:19.199 align:start position:0%
so that money was there
 
01:37:22.070 --> 01:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:24.229 --> 01:37:24.239 align:start position:0%
there are more people look there are
 
01:37:26.310 --> 01:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
more job openings
 
01:37:29.750 --> 01:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
than people are that are unemployment
 
01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:30.470 align:start position:0%
than people are that are unemployment
so

01:37:30.470 --> 01:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:37:33.109 --> 01:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
and hopefully once they
 
01:37:33.119 --> 01:37:34.870 align:start position:0%
and hopefully once they
for got stopped

01:37:34.870 --> 01:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
for got stopped
 
01:37:37.750 --> 01:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
which is coming this next month
 
01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:38.629 align:start position:0%
which is coming this next month
that

01:37:38.629 --> 01:37:38.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:37:40.950 --> 01:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
they'll see all those signs up for
 
01:37:43.430 --> 01:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
everywhere just about every kind of job
 
01:37:46.470 --> 01:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
opening that maybe they'll get filled
 
01:37:56.790 --> 01:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:58.870 --> 01:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh discussion
 
01:38:00.790 --> 01:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
representative shaw
 
01:38:02.790 --> 01:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
01:38:05.109 --> 01:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:38:06.390 --> 01:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
a problem
 
01:38:09.990 --> 01:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
in our state and not just our state but
 
01:38:11.590 --> 01:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
other states
 
01:38:14.550 --> 01:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:16.390 --> 01:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
young people
 
01:38:18.229 --> 01:38:18.239 align:start position:0%
coming out of
 
01:38:19.590 --> 01:38:19.600 align:start position:0%
quitting school
 
01:38:22.229 --> 01:38:22.239 align:start position:0%
coming out of out of high school
 
01:38:25.830 --> 01:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
with no direction whatsoever as to where
 
01:38:29.030 --> 01:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:32.550 --> 01:38:32.560 align:start position:0%
a workforce program like this
 
01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:34.229 align:start position:0%
a workforce program like this
would

01:38:34.229 --> 01:38:34.239 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:38:36.709 --> 01:38:36.719 align:start position:0%
take these kids off the street
 
01:38:38.870 --> 01:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
take these young people
 
01:38:41.350 --> 01:38:41.360 align:start position:0%
and show them that there are jobs out
 
01:38:44.629 --> 01:38:44.639 align:start position:0%
there sure you you can see in every
 
01:38:46.950 --> 01:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
every uh storefront
 
01:38:49.350 --> 01:38:49.360 align:start position:0%
help want it help want it
 
01:38:51.350 --> 01:38:51.360 align:start position:0%
but is it something
 
01:38:52.709 --> 01:38:52.719 align:start position:0%
they can do
 
01:38:52.719 --> 01:38:53.750 align:start position:0%
they can do
they

01:38:53.750 --> 01:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:38:55.910 --> 01:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
so many of them don't even
 
01:38:55.920 --> 01:38:57.510 align:start position:0%
so many of them don't even
understand

01:38:57.510 --> 01:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:39:00.070 --> 01:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
what it's like to work or what it is
 
01:39:00.080 --> 01:39:02.070 align:start position:0%
what it's like to work or what it is
they

01:39:02.070 --> 01:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:39:04.790 --> 01:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
i'm not expressing myself well but the
 
01:39:07.590 --> 01:39:07.600 align:start position:0%
point i'm trying to make is
 
01:39:10.229 --> 01:39:10.239 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:39:13.510 --> 01:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
for the betterment of the future of our
 
01:39:16.470 --> 01:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
state of our cities
 
01:39:19.270 --> 01:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
getting kids involved getting
 
01:39:21.510 --> 01:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
young people involved
 
01:39:23.669 --> 01:39:23.679 align:start position:0%
letting them realize
 
01:39:23.679 --> 01:39:24.709 align:start position:0%
letting them realize
that

01:39:24.709 --> 01:39:24.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:39:28.310 --> 01:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
there are opportunities for good jobs
 
01:39:31.270 --> 01:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
out there that they probably have no
 
01:39:34.149 --> 01:39:34.159 align:start position:0%
clue that they could do
 
01:39:37.430 --> 01:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
so that's my reason for supporting it
 
01:39:42.070 --> 01:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
and and not supporting an ito thank you
 
01:39:45.590 --> 01:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:47.910 --> 01:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:39:50.229 --> 01:39:50.239 align:start position:0%
i uh
 
01:39:50.239 --> 01:39:51.030 align:start position:0%
i uh
yeah

01:39:51.030 --> 01:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:39:53.189 --> 01:39:53.199 align:start position:0%
can you hear me all right yes you can i
 
01:39:55.990 --> 01:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
i grapple with this on and off business
 
01:39:59.430 --> 01:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i don't always get it right um
 
01:40:02.070 --> 01:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
i'd like to speak in favor of itl in
 
01:40:03.189 --> 01:40:03.199 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:40:05.189 --> 01:40:05.199 align:start position:0%
although originally i was not thinking
 
01:40:06.390 --> 01:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
in that way
 
01:40:08.790 --> 01:40:08.800 align:start position:0%
and the reason is the bill needs to be
 
01:40:11.990 --> 01:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
improved focused and all these various
 
01:40:15.350 --> 01:40:15.360 align:start position:0%
groups pull together to work in unison
 
01:40:18.470 --> 01:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
rather than impartial support in various
 
01:40:21.830 --> 01:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
ways what representative shaw said is
 
01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:23.189 align:start position:0%
ways what representative shaw said is
correct

01:40:23.189 --> 01:40:23.199 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:40:26.470 --> 01:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
but many of these students also serve uh
 
01:40:29.270 --> 01:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
or are situated in situations like my
 
01:40:31.910 --> 01:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
own when i was in school neither of my
 
01:40:34.070 --> 01:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
parents had been to college
 
01:40:35.990 --> 01:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
i had had that opportunity in their
 
01:40:38.870 --> 01:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
lives and so when i went to college i
 
01:40:41.430 --> 01:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
had no one at home who understood what
 
01:40:43.669 --> 01:40:43.679 align:start position:0%
was supposed to happen from that
 
01:40:46.790 --> 01:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
particular experience and so it takes
 
01:40:49.750 --> 01:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
time to figure out where it all fits
 
01:40:52.149 --> 01:40:52.159 align:start position:0%
when i taught in the community colleges
 
01:40:54.790 --> 01:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and in massachusetts i
 
01:40:56.550 --> 01:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
had a lot of students who thought oh
 
01:40:58.790 --> 01:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
i'll learn computers and i'll have to do
 
01:41:00.550 --> 01:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
that i don't need to write english
 
01:41:02.870 --> 01:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
essays and then i would ask him the
 
01:41:05.750 --> 01:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
question how do you propose to sell your
 
01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:06.870 align:start position:0%
question how do you propose to sell your
program

01:41:06.870 --> 01:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:41:08.229 --> 01:41:08.239 align:start position:0%
if you don't write out a good
 
01:41:10.629 --> 01:41:10.639 align:start position:0%
description of it and then pitch it to
 
01:41:13.510 --> 01:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
somebody so they can understand it if
 
01:41:17.189 --> 01:41:17.199 align:start position:0%
you can't argue it you can't sell it
 
01:41:19.510 --> 01:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
and then they say oh
 
01:41:21.350 --> 01:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
yeah i guess so
 
01:41:23.350 --> 01:41:23.360 align:start position:0%
i worked with framing carpenters one
 
01:41:25.830 --> 01:41:25.840 align:start position:0%
time and one time we were talking about
 
01:41:27.990 --> 01:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
squaring the box so we could one get our
 
01:41:29.990 --> 01:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
first paycheck and two get the
 
01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:31.270 align:start position:0%
first paycheck and two get the
foundation

01:41:31.270 --> 01:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
foundation
 
01:41:33.590 --> 01:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
ready to go
 
01:41:34.709 --> 01:41:34.719 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:41:37.830 --> 01:41:37.840 align:start position:0%
director of the of our our team said to
 
01:41:40.070 --> 01:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
the one guy go and measure the corners
 
01:41:41.669 --> 01:41:41.679 align:start position:0%
and then measure the other corners and
 
01:41:43.669 --> 01:41:43.679 align:start position:0%
see if they're the same
 
01:41:45.750 --> 01:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
he said why would i do that he said to
 
01:41:48.070 --> 01:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
prove it that it's square so we build up
 
01:41:50.149 --> 01:41:50.159 align:start position:0%
the building it'll be square
 
01:41:51.750 --> 01:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
and he said
 
01:41:55.590 --> 01:41:55.600 align:start position:0%
you mean there's a use for that stuff
 
01:41:57.590 --> 01:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
i remember it he didn't say stuff of
 
01:41:59.750 --> 01:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
course but he's a carpenter
 
01:42:01.350 --> 01:42:01.360 align:start position:0%
but that's what he meant
 
01:42:03.669 --> 01:42:03.679 align:start position:0%
no one had ever explained to him that
 
01:42:05.270 --> 01:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
there was a use
 
01:42:07.510 --> 01:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
for that stuff that knowledge
 
01:42:09.109 --> 01:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:42:11.510 --> 01:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
he dropped out of high school
 
01:42:13.990 --> 01:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
later went to a trade school but he
 
01:42:16.390 --> 01:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
dropped out of school
 
01:42:18.229 --> 01:42:18.239 align:start position:0%
and that's what this kind of program is
 
01:42:20.390 --> 01:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
to do is to reach those
 
01:42:23.350 --> 01:42:23.360 align:start position:0%
people who do not have the understanding
 
01:42:25.750 --> 01:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
in their family their life experience
 
01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:27.109 align:start position:0%
in their family their life experience
whatever

01:42:27.109 --> 01:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
01:42:29.430 --> 01:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
to get introduced to
 
01:42:32.229 --> 01:42:32.239 align:start position:0%
how that will work for them to build a
 
01:42:32.239 --> 01:42:33.350 align:start position:0%
how that will work for them to build a
career

01:42:33.350 --> 01:42:33.360 align:start position:0%
career
 
01:42:35.990 --> 01:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
and how to envision a life that involves
 
01:42:38.149 --> 01:42:38.159 align:start position:0%
more education now you don't have to
 
01:42:40.229 --> 01:42:40.239 align:start position:0%
overdo it for me and take four and five
 
01:42:43.030 --> 01:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
degrees but you know a degree would be a
 
01:42:44.470 --> 01:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
good start
 
01:42:46.229 --> 01:42:46.239 align:start position:0%
and that's what this is
 
01:42:47.750 --> 01:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
getting them to a good start to
 
01:42:50.390 --> 01:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
understanding how education links with
 
01:42:53.350 --> 01:42:53.360 align:start position:0%
avocation and vocation
 
01:42:54.629 --> 01:42:54.639 align:start position:0%
and that's what we're really trying to
 
01:42:56.870 --> 01:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
do in this kind of bill and i'm going to
 
01:42:59.510 --> 01:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
work with the the people involved
 
01:43:02.310 --> 01:43:02.320 align:start position:0%
and we will bring back a bill in a year
 
01:43:04.390 --> 01:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
that's much better than this bill
 
01:43:06.390 --> 01:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
much more focused and we'll figure in
 
01:43:08.790 --> 01:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
how all the parts have to work with who
 
01:43:12.310 --> 01:43:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:14.709 --> 01:43:14.719 align:start position:0%

01:43:21.750 --> 01:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
questions and i'll direct them both to

education testifying against this bill
 
01:43:29.350 --> 01:43:29.360 align:start position:0%

01:43:31.669 --> 01:43:31.679 align:start position:0%
refresh my memory on what their
 
01:43:33.830 --> 01:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
objections their specific objections
 
01:43:37.189 --> 01:43:37.199 align:start position:0%
were and second of all um this was this
 
01:43:40.070 --> 01:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
bill was a bipartisan bill and you were
 
01:43:42.070 --> 01:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
actually a co-sponsor on the original
 
01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:42.870 align:start position:0%
actually a co-sponsor on the original
bill

01:43:42.870 --> 01:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:43:46.950 --> 01:43:46.960 align:start position:0%

01:43:49.750 --> 01:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
commenting on
 
01:43:51.669 --> 01:43:51.679 align:start position:0%
what you feel
 
01:43:53.830 --> 01:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
got thrown out what what part of the
 
01:43:55.669 --> 01:43:55.679 align:start position:0%
baby got thrown out with the bathwater
 
01:43:58.550 --> 01:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:01.910 --> 01:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
the the bill addresses uh the
 
01:44:05.350 --> 01:44:05.360 align:start position:0%
uh uh requires uh the community college
 
01:44:06.950 --> 01:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
system of new hampshire
 
01:44:09.350 --> 01:44:09.360 align:start position:0%
to administer this program
 
01:44:11.189 --> 01:44:11.199 align:start position:0%
currently we have new hampshire
 
01:44:12.629 --> 01:44:12.639 align:start position:0%
department of business and economic
 
01:44:15.109 --> 01:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
affairs involved with it we also have
 
01:44:18.149 --> 01:44:18.159 align:start position:0%
the department of education which is the
 
01:44:19.830 --> 01:44:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh includes the career technical
 
01:44:21.590 --> 01:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
education centers
 
01:44:24.550 --> 01:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
uh resources come from the support of
 
01:44:27.109 --> 01:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
the program they come from the
 
01:44:27.119 --> 01:44:28.470 align:start position:0%
the program they come from the
um

01:44:28.470 --> 01:44:28.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:30.790 --> 01:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
federal workforce opportunity investment
 
01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:32.149 align:start position:0%
federal workforce opportunity investment
act

01:44:32.149 --> 01:44:32.159 align:start position:0%
act
 
01:44:35.189 --> 01:44:35.199 align:start position:0%
uh and that act has four titles titles
 
01:44:36.709 --> 01:44:36.719 align:start position:0%
one through four
 
01:44:39.510 --> 01:44:39.520 align:start position:0%

01:44:43.990 --> 01:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation
 
01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:44.790 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation
um

01:44:44.790 --> 01:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:47.350 --> 01:44:47.360 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned about how these resources
 
01:44:49.350 --> 01:44:49.360 align:start position:0%
are going to be allocated now seeing the
 
01:44:51.910 --> 01:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
administration of this program now is up
 
01:44:53.109 --> 01:44:53.119 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:44:54.950 --> 01:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
community college system new hampshire
 
01:44:57.750 --> 01:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned about that the longevity
 
01:44:59.350 --> 01:44:59.360 align:start position:0%
of where resources are going to come
 
01:45:01.350 --> 01:45:01.360 align:start position:0%
from or to maintain
 
01:45:04.229 --> 01:45:04.239 align:start position:0%
this program in the future the community
 
01:45:06.390 --> 01:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
system new hampshire now and university
 
01:45:07.910 --> 01:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
system capture
 
01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:09.510 align:start position:0%
system capture
are

01:45:09.510 --> 01:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:45:12.310 --> 01:45:12.320 align:start position:0%
in another area we're talking merger and
 
01:45:15.030 --> 01:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
we don't know how the overall governance
 
01:45:17.109 --> 01:45:17.119 align:start position:0%
of these uh particular groups are is
 
01:45:19.030 --> 01:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
going to look like in the future
 
01:45:21.189 --> 01:45:21.199 align:start position:0%
so involving the department of education
 
01:45:23.750 --> 01:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
only you don't see doe mentioned in this
 
01:45:27.910 --> 01:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
bill at all other than cte
 
01:45:30.550 --> 01:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
and i believe that there needs to be
 
01:45:32.550 --> 01:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
more reference and with involvement with
 
01:45:34.470 --> 01:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
them the department is certainly a
 
01:45:34.480 --> 01:45:35.510 align:start position:0%
them the department is certainly a
partner

01:45:35.510 --> 01:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
partner
 
01:45:36.870 --> 01:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:45:38.470 --> 01:45:38.480 align:start position:0%
so i that
 
01:45:39.990 --> 01:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
those are my concerns about this
 
01:45:42.470 --> 01:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
particular bill i'm all for workforce
 
01:45:45.030 --> 01:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
development and always have been and
 
01:45:47.510 --> 01:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
will advocate for in the future i just
 
01:45:49.430 --> 01:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
don't think you know support what
 
01:45:51.590 --> 01:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
representative ford said i don't think
 
01:45:53.109 --> 01:45:53.119 align:start position:0%
it's ready i think there's a lot of
 
01:45:55.430 --> 01:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
loose ends in it that need some uh
 
01:45:57.990 --> 01:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
better definition
 
01:46:02.149 --> 01:46:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:04.950 --> 01:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to add that um
 
01:46:07.030 --> 01:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
the school board association i have here
 
01:46:09.350 --> 01:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
on our notes from that hearing that they
 
01:46:10.629 --> 01:46:10.639 align:start position:0%
were against
 
01:46:12.950 --> 01:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
however they did not sign in on that you
 
01:46:15.669 --> 01:46:15.679 align:start position:0%
know to sign up to speak or testify
 
01:46:18.470 --> 01:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
right so uh brett have been looking for
 
01:46:19.830 --> 01:46:19.840 align:start position:0%
that information
 
01:46:21.990 --> 01:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
okay represent mylar
 
01:46:23.910 --> 01:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:46:26.870 --> 01:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
now is the time to do this bill i i
 
01:46:28.790 --> 01:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
concur with representative ford's
 
01:46:31.109 --> 01:46:31.119 align:start position:0%
comments about the need but now is the
 
01:46:32.550 --> 01:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
time to do this we have people who are
 
01:46:34.629 --> 01:46:34.639 align:start position:0%
getting ready to go back to work
 
01:46:36.470 --> 01:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
and we have this bill provides an
 
01:46:38.709 --> 01:46:38.719 align:start position:0%
opportunity for those who are going back
 
01:46:40.629 --> 01:46:40.639 align:start position:0%
to work to perhaps look at another
 
01:46:40.639 --> 01:46:41.990 align:start position:0%
to work to perhaps look at another
alternative

01:46:41.990 --> 01:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
alternative
 
01:46:43.830 --> 01:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
that would advance their current
 
01:46:45.830 --> 01:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
employment status beyond what they
 
01:46:48.070 --> 01:46:48.080 align:start position:0%
currently or what they would have done
 
01:46:50.470 --> 01:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
prior to covet now is the time to deal
 
01:46:52.629 --> 01:46:52.639 align:start position:0%
with this we and also we received a
 
01:46:54.470 --> 01:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
letter today from the business
 
01:46:55.830 --> 01:46:55.840 align:start position:0%
the bia
 
01:46:57.830 --> 01:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
they support this bill these are the
 
01:47:00.229 --> 01:47:00.239 align:start position:0%
folks who are looking for
 
01:47:03.510 --> 01:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
good employees they support this on the
 
01:47:05.510 --> 01:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
presumption that people will have a
 
01:47:07.590 --> 01:47:07.600 align:start position:0%
chance to advance themselves in the
 
01:47:09.910 --> 01:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
employment center now is the time to do
 
01:47:11.910 --> 01:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
this not to wait
 
01:47:14.390 --> 01:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:17.669 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
cornell

01:47:17.669 --> 01:47:17.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:19.750 --> 01:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to say that i'm against
 
01:47:23.189 --> 01:47:23.199 align:start position:0%
itling this we have much more support
 
01:47:25.910 --> 01:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
in the hearing for the bill than against
 
01:47:28.070 --> 01:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
it and like um
 
01:47:30.229 --> 01:47:30.239 align:start position:0%
rep milor just said we got a letter this
 
01:47:33.750 --> 01:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
morning from the bia um the auto dealers
 
01:47:36.310 --> 01:47:36.320 align:start position:0%
which represents 500 businesses
 
01:47:36.320 --> 01:47:37.669 align:start position:0%
which represents 500 businesses
supported

01:47:37.669 --> 01:47:37.679 align:start position:0%
supported
 
01:47:39.750 --> 01:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
the community college supported it and
 
01:47:42.310 --> 01:47:42.320 align:start position:0%
it said it identifies pathways for
 
01:47:45.109 --> 01:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
higher skills and better jobs so there
 
01:47:47.109 --> 01:47:47.119 align:start position:0%
might not be a lot of unemployment but
 
01:47:49.189 --> 01:47:49.199 align:start position:0%
it's people working at
 
01:47:51.109 --> 01:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
dollars and 25 cents an hour they have
 
01:47:53.830 --> 01:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
to work two jobs so that's taking up a
 
01:47:55.270 --> 01:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
lot of the jobs
 
01:47:58.229 --> 01:47:58.239 align:start position:0%
she also said um it would position
 
01:48:00.629 --> 01:48:00.639 align:start position:0%
the the group to apply for federal
 
01:48:02.830 --> 01:48:02.840 align:start position:0%
grants to get more money for more
 
01:48:04.870 --> 01:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
training um
 
01:48:08.950 --> 01:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
the lna barriers were needed um
 
01:48:11.109 --> 01:48:11.119 align:start position:0%
so i i just think that there's much more
 
01:48:13.510 --> 01:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
reason to pass this bill right now than
 
01:48:16.470 --> 01:48:16.480 align:start position:0%
to itl it
 
01:48:17.750 --> 01:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
01:48:17.760 --> 01:48:19.270 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
porter

01:48:19.270 --> 01:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
porter
 
01:48:21.510 --> 01:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i don't see a
 
01:48:23.750 --> 01:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal note on this bill so i'm curious
 
01:48:26.870 --> 01:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
as to um what money was being discussed
 
01:48:28.550 --> 01:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
when you were
 
01:48:32.790 --> 01:48:32.800 align:start position:0%
discussing the concern about funding
 
01:48:34.629 --> 01:48:34.639 align:start position:0%
i'm talking about the administration of
 
01:48:37.109 --> 01:48:37.119 align:start position:0%
the uh workforce federal monies that
 
01:48:38.790 --> 01:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
come down federal workforce
 
01:48:41.590 --> 01:48:41.600 align:start position:0%
communication and opportunity act the
 
01:48:43.270 --> 01:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
community college would then be the
 
01:48:44.709 --> 01:48:44.719 align:start position:0%
minister of that
 
01:48:47.910 --> 01:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
and bea opposes it because it duplicates
 
01:48:50.390 --> 01:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
existing efforts and commits agency
 
01:48:52.550 --> 01:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
resources towards such efforts in ways
 
01:48:56.310 --> 01:48:56.320 align:start position:0%
not previously anticipated and so plans
 
01:48:58.550 --> 01:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
have been developed applications have
 
01:49:01.750 --> 01:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
been received um i i just don't think
 
01:49:04.070 --> 01:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
there i there's too many unanswered
 
01:49:05.750 --> 01:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
questions which were brought up by the
 
01:49:07.750 --> 01:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
business and economic affairs
 
01:49:09.030 --> 01:49:09.040 align:start position:0%

01:49:24.229 --> 01:49:24.239 align:start position:0%
made and i guess the question goes
 
01:49:27.430 --> 01:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
either to you or representative cordelli
 
01:49:30.149 --> 01:49:30.159 align:start position:0%
who at the department of education has
 
01:49:32.310 --> 01:49:32.320 align:start position:0%
filed the objection to this bill was it
 
01:49:34.390 --> 01:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
the commissioner or was it someone from
 
01:49:36.709 --> 01:49:36.719 align:start position:0%
the office of adult education in the in
 
01:49:39.910 --> 01:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:42.070 --> 01:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
i have not talked with anyone in adult
 
01:49:49.590 --> 01:49:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:51.910 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:49:51.910 --> 01:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:53.430 --> 01:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
i mentioned
 
01:49:56.950 --> 01:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
earlier the combined state plan
 
01:49:58.790 --> 01:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
and i would encourage everyone to look
 
01:50:01.270 --> 01:50:01.280 align:start position:0%
at that
 
01:50:02.950 --> 01:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
the vision
 
01:50:05.189 --> 01:50:05.199 align:start position:0%
that they should be the mission
 
01:50:07.350 --> 01:50:07.360 align:start position:0%
that they outlined was to promote and
 
01:50:09.350 --> 01:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
advocate for talent development by
 
01:50:12.070 --> 01:50:12.080 align:start position:0%
partnering with businesses agencies
 
01:50:14.149 --> 01:50:14.159 align:start position:0%
educational institutions and
 
01:50:16.629 --> 01:50:16.639 align:start position:0%

businesses and individual customers
 
01:50:26.310 --> 01:50:26.320 align:start position:0%
they outline values priorities
 
01:50:29.990 --> 01:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
as i said it's over 350 pages long
 
01:50:31.510 --> 01:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
they talk about
 
01:50:35.910 --> 01:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
program specific requirements uh about
 
01:50:39.750 --> 01:50:39.760 align:start position:0%

01:50:47.990 --> 01:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
there are things going on
 
01:50:50.390 --> 01:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
it sets performance goals for the core
 
01:50:52.470 --> 01:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
programs i would encourage
 
01:50:55.510 --> 01:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
anyone who's um
 
01:50:58.470 --> 01:50:58.480 align:start position:0%

01:51:30.470 --> 01:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
department of education's objection
 
01:51:34.229 --> 01:51:34.239 align:start position:0%
i know i see that diana fenton is on uh
 
01:51:36.310 --> 01:51:36.320 align:start position:0%
on this webinar and i was wondering if
 
01:51:37.830 --> 01:51:37.840 align:start position:0%
perhaps she could tell us what their
 
01:51:40.390 --> 01:51:40.400 align:start position:0%
objection is thank you she's here we can
 
01:51:45.750 --> 01:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:47.430 --> 01:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
yep she's here okay
 
01:51:49.030 --> 01:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
miss fenton we're going to promote you
 
01:51:49.040 --> 01:52:02.070 align:start position:0%
miss fenton we're going to promote you
just

01:52:02.070 --> 01:52:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:04.870 --> 01:52:04.880 align:start position:0%
welcome to education
 
01:52:06.629 --> 01:52:06.639 align:start position:0%
thank you good morning
 
01:52:09.270 --> 01:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:10.550 --> 01:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
i believe the
 
01:52:12.950 --> 01:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
question um i don't i don't recall
 
01:52:15.910 --> 01:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
testifying on this bill i might have uh
 
01:52:17.510 --> 01:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
so forgive me at this point in the
 
01:52:20.149 --> 01:52:20.159 align:start position:0%
session uh sometimes my memory fails me
 
01:52:23.910 --> 01:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
um i do recall um
 
01:52:23.920 --> 01:52:24.950 align:start position:0%
um i do recall um
that

01:52:24.950 --> 01:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:52:26.629 --> 01:52:26.639 align:start position:0%
the concern
 
01:52:29.270 --> 01:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
was simply the it appeared to be a very
 
01:52:31.109 --> 01:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
limited role the deal we would play in
 
01:52:33.910 --> 01:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
this bill um and
 
01:52:35.669 --> 01:52:35.679 align:start position:0%
that to the best of my knowledge was the
 
01:52:37.910 --> 01:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
only concern and but again i don't
 
01:52:40.470 --> 01:52:40.480 align:start position:0%
recall if if i testified to it and i
 
01:52:42.830 --> 01:52:42.840 align:start position:0%
don't believe that anyone from adult
 
01:52:45.589 --> 01:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
education uh to address rep uh
 
01:52:47.189 --> 01:52:47.199 align:start position:0%

underemployed
 
01:53:36.390 --> 01:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
um and i agree with representative shaw
 
01:53:38.870 --> 01:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
that this is in milo this is the chance
 
01:53:40.950 --> 01:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
to move forward for folks that need to
 
01:53:43.270 --> 01:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
get out of the 7.25
 
01:53:45.350 --> 01:53:45.360 align:start position:0%

train them i i think what we're doing a
 
01:53:57.510 --> 01:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
disservice to our young people of the
 
01:53:59.750 --> 01:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
state i know a lot of this bill to go

01:54:35.270 --> 01:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
cordelia i think you
 
01:54:39.189 --> 01:54:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:40.629 --> 01:54:40.639 align:start position:0%
yes i i
 
01:54:43.030 --> 01:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
i recall some conversations with people
 
01:54:46.229 --> 01:54:46.239 align:start position:0%
um uh i i don't have my notes with me on
 
01:54:46.239 --> 01:54:47.270 align:start position:0%
um uh i i don't have my notes with me on
that

01:54:47.270 --> 01:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:54:50.550 --> 01:54:50.560 align:start position:0%
um but i would just like to say that uh
 
01:54:53.910 --> 01:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
the department of education in the
 
01:54:56.629 --> 01:54:56.639 align:start position:0%
uh wioa combined state plan
 
01:54:59.109 --> 01:54:59.119 align:start position:0%
is one of the required partners both in
 
01:55:03.430 --> 01:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
terms of titles one two and four
 
01:55:03.440 --> 01:55:04.629 align:start position:0%
terms of titles one two and four
uh

01:55:04.629 --> 01:55:04.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:55:04.639 --> 01:55:05.669 align:start position:0%
uh
so

01:55:05.669 --> 01:55:05.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:55:09.270 --> 01:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
they are a significant partner
 
01:55:09.280 --> 01:55:10.709 align:start position:0%
they are a significant partner
with

01:55:10.709 --> 01:55:10.719 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:55:11.990 --> 01:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
the others
 
01:55:13.669 --> 01:55:13.679 align:start position:0%
in that state plan
 
01:55:15.510 --> 01:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
representative ellison
 
01:55:17.589 --> 01:55:17.599 align:start position:0%
uh thank you thank you mr chair for
 
01:55:20.709 --> 01:55:20.719 align:start position:0%

answer uh
 
01:55:23.830 --> 01:55:23.840 align:start position:0%
recent answer
 
01:55:26.709 --> 01:55:26.719 align:start position:0%
is it now the fact that we do not have a
 
01:55:28.470 --> 01:55:28.480 align:start position:0%
written objection from the department of
 
01:55:35.189 --> 01:55:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:39.189 --> 01:55:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:41.430 --> 01:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
given where we are now do we have a
 
01:55:43.189 --> 01:55:43.199 align:start position:0%
written objection from the department of
 
01:55:47.350 --> 01:55:47.360 align:start position:0%
education to this piece of legislation
 
01:55:50.709 --> 01:55:50.719 align:start position:0%
um i don't recall seeing an email
 
01:55:52.790 --> 01:55:52.800 align:start position:0%
from them
 
01:55:58.830 --> 01:55:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:01.830 --> 01:56:01.840 align:start position:0%
um well so
 
01:56:04.870 --> 01:56:04.880 align:start position:0%
sure mr chair so would it would then be
 
01:56:06.070 --> 01:56:06.080 align:start position:0%
fair to say
 
01:56:08.709 --> 01:56:08.719 align:start position:0%
that that um that the department has not
 
01:56:10.790 --> 01:56:10.800 align:start position:0%
weighed in on this legislation as
 
01:56:13.350 --> 01:56:13.360 align:start position:0%
opposed to what was um what was offered
 
01:56:14.709 --> 01:56:14.719 align:start position:0%
earlier i
 
01:56:17.109 --> 01:56:17.119 align:start position:0%

01:56:18.870 --> 01:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
that they have taken uh
 
01:56:22.709 --> 01:56:22.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:22.719 --> 01:56:24.070 align:start position:0%

01:56:26.149 --> 01:56:26.159 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
01:56:29.030 --> 01:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
leah just stepped out for a moment to
 
01:56:30.310 --> 01:56:30.320 align:start position:0%
take a call
 
01:56:32.629 --> 01:56:32.639 align:start position:0%
uh i see uh representative boehm has his
 
01:56:33.750 --> 01:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
hand up
 
01:56:37.109 --> 01:56:37.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:38.470 --> 01:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
in the past
 
01:56:41.589 --> 01:56:41.599 align:start position:0%
automobile associates dia
 
01:56:44.310 --> 01:56:44.320 align:start position:0%
and other industries has worked with the
 
01:56:47.189 --> 01:56:47.199 align:start position:0%
community college to develop
 
01:56:47.199 --> 01:56:48.470 align:start position:0%
community college to develop
training

01:56:48.470 --> 01:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
training
 
01:56:48.480 --> 01:57:04.310 align:start position:0%
training
examples

01:57:04.310 --> 01:57:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:07.270 --> 01:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
my own past experiences
 
01:57:13.830 --> 01:57:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:17.189 --> 01:57:17.199 align:start position:0%
the company would do that training
 
01:57:18.550 --> 01:57:18.560 align:start position:0%
don't need
 
01:57:20.390 --> 01:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
government spending
 
01:57:22.709 --> 01:57:22.719 align:start position:0%
general government spending in this case
 
01:57:24.870 --> 01:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
01:57:27.030 --> 01:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
already so
 
01:57:29.189 --> 01:57:29.199 align:start position:0%
we do not need this program there are
 
01:57:31.669 --> 01:57:31.679 align:start position:0%
courses available i do agree
 
01:57:34.229 --> 01:57:34.239 align:start position:0%
that high schools are not teaching what
 
01:57:35.990 --> 01:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
they should be teaching
 
01:57:37.669 --> 01:57:37.679 align:start position:0%
for example even when i went to high
 
01:57:39.990 --> 01:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
school many decades ago
 
01:57:41.750 --> 01:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
i mean i said what would i need this
 
01:57:44.629 --> 01:57:44.639 align:start position:0%
basketball to teach you well because in
 
01:57:46.470 --> 01:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
most cases the teachers have never been
 
01:57:48.229 --> 01:57:48.239 align:start position:0%
out of the classroom
 
01:57:50.470 --> 01:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
and that's one of the problems and that
 
01:57:53.430 --> 01:57:53.440 align:start position:0%
was brought up on how to figure out the
 
01:57:55.669 --> 01:57:55.679 align:start position:0%
right angle and why what to use it for
 
01:57:57.350 --> 01:57:57.360 align:start position:0%
measuring the decks and those kind of
 
01:58:00.149 --> 01:58:00.159 align:start position:0%
things i mean i didn't know that until
 
01:58:00.159 --> 01:58:01.430 align:start position:0%
things i mean i didn't know that until
afterwards

01:58:01.430 --> 01:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
afterwards
 
01:58:03.990 --> 01:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh you know watching it
 
01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:04.709 align:start position:0%
uh you know watching it
but

01:58:04.709 --> 01:58:04.719 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:58:07.589 --> 01:58:07.599 align:start position:0%
the thing is training is available for
 
01:58:09.990 --> 01:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
high school i'm not doing a good job on
 
01:58:11.910 --> 01:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
it i'm not telling people
 
01:58:14.550 --> 01:58:14.560 align:start position:0%
why this is needed why you shouldn't do
 
01:58:16.070 --> 01:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
this but
 
01:58:18.629 --> 01:58:18.639 align:start position:0%
this is not part of that and industries
 
01:58:30.229 --> 01:58:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:32.870 --> 01:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i visited a
 
01:58:35.189 --> 01:58:35.199 align:start position:0%
similar workforce development uh group
 
01:58:36.709 --> 01:58:36.719 align:start position:0%
over in vermont
 
01:58:39.350 --> 01:58:39.360 align:start position:0%
and you know the big thing uh just like
 
01:58:41.669 --> 01:58:41.679 align:start position:0%
uh representative ford said a lot of the
 
01:58:44.629 --> 01:58:44.639 align:start position:0%
soft skills like just you know going to
 
01:58:45.990 --> 01:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
work getting up
 
01:58:48.470 --> 01:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh how to dress for work how to talk to
 
01:58:50.629 --> 01:58:50.639 align:start position:0%
people how to shake hands how to look
 
01:58:52.070 --> 01:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
people in the eye
 
01:58:53.830 --> 01:58:53.840 align:start position:0%
those kinds of things
 
01:58:53.840 --> 01:58:54.870 align:start position:0%
those kinds of things
uh

01:58:54.870 --> 01:58:54.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:58:57.990 --> 01:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of students a lot of kids uh and i
 
01:58:59.750 --> 01:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
think representative shaw mentioned this
 
01:59:01.589 --> 01:59:01.599 align:start position:0%
a lot of kids that are just they don't
 
01:59:03.830 --> 01:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
have direction they don't have direction
 
01:59:04.950 --> 01:59:04.960 align:start position:0%
at home
 
01:59:07.270 --> 01:59:07.280 align:start position:0%
um you know this is this is something
 
01:59:09.910 --> 01:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
that takes them from that level
 
01:59:11.750 --> 01:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh and gives them
 
01:59:13.750 --> 01:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
that type of mentoring
 
01:59:13.760 --> 01:59:14.550 align:start position:0%
that type of mentoring
that

01:59:14.550 --> 01:59:14.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:59:15.830 --> 01:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:59:17.669 --> 01:59:17.679 align:start position:0%
yes teachers teach
 
01:59:19.030 --> 01:59:19.040 align:start position:0%
things like that that's why we have
 
01:59:22.550 --> 01:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
performance-based uh assessments now um
 
01:59:24.790 --> 01:59:24.800 align:start position:0%
and experiential learning that's being
 
01:59:27.109 --> 01:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
taught in schools but if it's not at the
 
01:59:29.189 --> 01:59:29.199 align:start position:0%
home if it's not in their culture if
 
01:59:31.990 --> 01:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
it's not uh something that that rings a
 
01:59:34.470 --> 01:59:34.480 align:start position:0%
bell in their head
 
01:59:37.510 --> 01:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
that sometimes they're not ready for it
 
01:59:39.270 --> 01:59:39.280 align:start position:0%
but certainly once they get out in the
 
01:59:41.350 --> 01:59:41.360 align:start position:0%
real world and they they want to get
 
01:59:43.109 --> 01:59:43.119 align:start position:0%
into the workforce well they don't
 
01:59:44.629 --> 01:59:44.639 align:start position:0%
necessarily want to get in the workforce
 
01:59:46.629 --> 01:59:46.639 align:start position:0%
but they need a job they need to get in
 
01:59:48.950 --> 01:59:48.960 align:start position:0%
the workforce we need them to get into
 
01:59:51.189 --> 01:59:51.199 align:start position:0%
the workforce and get off the streets
 
01:59:54.310 --> 01:59:54.320 align:start position:0%
this is this is a great opportunity and
 
01:59:58.310 --> 01:59:58.320 align:start position:0%
um i i personally don't see
 
02:00:01.109 --> 02:00:01.119 align:start position:0%
such a bad objection to this
 
02:00:01.119 --> 02:00:02.629 align:start position:0%
such a bad objection to this
that

02:00:02.629 --> 02:00:02.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:00:05.510 --> 02:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
we can't pass it
 
02:00:07.750 --> 02:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
and then people work on it that are part
 
02:00:09.990 --> 02:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
of this uh group that that's been listed
 
02:00:11.910 --> 02:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
in here i think the community colleges
 
02:00:11.920 --> 02:00:12.629 align:start position:0%
in here i think the community colleges
are

02:00:12.629 --> 02:00:12.639 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:00:16.070 --> 02:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
well suited uh to take this on
 
02:00:20.870 --> 02:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
and um i would i would oppose the itl um
 
02:00:22.390 --> 02:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
i think uh
 
02:00:24.229 --> 02:00:24.239 align:start position:0%
from representative ford's point of view
 
02:00:25.510 --> 02:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
a retain
 
02:00:28.790 --> 02:00:28.800 align:start position:0%
um to work on it and bring it back uh
 
02:00:32.070 --> 02:00:32.080 align:start position:0%
also would be good but itl is just i
 
02:00:34.629 --> 02:00:34.639 align:start position:0%
think it's to kill this bill right now
 
02:00:37.270 --> 02:00:37.280 align:start position:0%
sends out a bad message again it's a
 
02:00:40.790 --> 02:00:40.800 align:start position:0%
message as well as an opportunity so i
 
02:00:44.870 --> 02:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:47.350 --> 02:00:47.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um
 
02:00:49.270 --> 02:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
cordelia do you have a hand up yes thank
 
02:00:52.830 --> 02:00:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:56.790 --> 02:00:56.800 align:start position:0%
i uh again go back to the fact
 
02:00:59.430 --> 02:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
that we have a state plan
 
02:01:02.070 --> 02:01:02.080 align:start position:0%
that's been in effect for uh
 
02:01:04.550 --> 02:01:04.560 align:start position:0%
i think a little bit less than a year
 
02:01:07.030 --> 02:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
we've heard before about giving programs
 
02:01:08.629 --> 02:01:08.639 align:start position:0%
the chance to work
 
02:01:08.639 --> 02:01:09.430 align:start position:0%
the chance to work
well

02:01:09.430 --> 02:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:01:12.149 --> 02:01:12.159 align:start position:0%
we have a state plan that all the
 
02:01:14.629 --> 02:01:14.639 align:start position:0%
stakeholders were invested in
 
02:01:17.030 --> 02:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
and contributed to
 
02:01:19.350 --> 02:01:19.360 align:start position:0%
anywhere from the
 
02:01:21.030 --> 02:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
employment security to the department of
 
02:01:21.040 --> 02:01:22.950 align:start position:0%
employment security to the department of
education

02:01:22.950 --> 02:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
education
 
02:01:24.950 --> 02:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
senior community service employment
 
02:01:24.960 --> 02:01:26.229 align:start position:0%
senior community service employment
program

02:01:26.229 --> 02:01:26.239 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:01:28.229 --> 02:01:28.239 align:start position:0%
they're all involved in developing this
 
02:01:29.510 --> 02:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
state plan
 
02:01:31.589 --> 02:01:31.599 align:start position:0%
i would hope that anyone who is going to
 
02:01:31.599 --> 02:01:33.030 align:start position:0%
i would hope that anyone who is going to
vote

02:01:33.030 --> 02:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
vote
 
02:01:35.669 --> 02:01:35.679 align:start position:0%
against the itl would have looked at the
 
02:01:39.189 --> 02:01:39.199 align:start position:0%
state plan and know what is going on
 
02:01:44.709 --> 02:01:44.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:46.550 --> 02:01:46.560 align:start position:0%
what happens to the funding that's
 
02:01:48.550 --> 02:01:48.560 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in statute
 
02:01:51.270 --> 02:01:51.280 align:start position:0%
what happens what happens there the job
 
02:01:53.750 --> 02:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
training fund what happens to that it's
 
02:01:55.350 --> 02:01:55.360 align:start position:0%
under the department of employment
 
02:01:59.030 --> 02:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
security do we just ignore that rsa
 
02:02:01.430 --> 02:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
this i'll point out uh
 
02:02:05.430 --> 02:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
this takes effect on passage
 
02:02:05.440 --> 02:02:06.229 align:start position:0%
this takes effect on passage
so

02:02:06.229 --> 02:02:06.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:02:08.709 --> 02:02:08.719 align:start position:0%
we're headed for a lot of problems
 
02:02:11.830 --> 02:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
if we pass this bill
 
02:02:13.589 --> 02:02:13.599 align:start position:0%
okay at this point in time i'm gonna
 
02:02:16.390 --> 02:02:16.400 align:start position:0%
it's uh attorney fenton's still there
 
02:02:18.629 --> 02:02:18.639 align:start position:0%
these are these are the questions that i
 
02:02:20.070 --> 02:02:20.080 align:start position:0%
had as well
 
02:02:23.350 --> 02:02:23.360 align:start position:0%
that the we have a state plan
 
02:02:25.830 --> 02:02:25.840 align:start position:0%
and we're going to change something
 
02:02:27.430 --> 02:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
without having
 
02:02:29.430 --> 02:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
gone through the application process for
 
02:02:31.589 --> 02:02:31.599 align:start position:0%
the feds and put this in effect
 
02:02:34.629 --> 02:02:34.639 align:start position:0%
immediately upon being passed
 
02:02:36.310 --> 02:02:36.320 align:start position:0%
uh that there's something that doesn't
 
02:02:38.070 --> 02:02:38.080 align:start position:0%
equate there with me i'm not against
 
02:02:40.470 --> 02:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
workforce support but i'm uh this
 
02:02:43.750 --> 02:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
process seems that needs more work
 
02:02:45.589 --> 02:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
tony fenton there yes
 
02:02:48.790 --> 02:02:48.800 align:start position:0%
she's able to speak go ahead
 
02:02:52.070 --> 02:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
yes thank you good morning um
 
02:02:54.229 --> 02:02:54.239 align:start position:0%
so in looking at this language
 
02:02:56.470 --> 02:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
representative ladd um
 
02:02:59.270 --> 02:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
i do agree if you look at page two
 
02:03:02.709 --> 02:03:02.719 align:start position:0%
lines two and three um it says use
 
02:03:04.629 --> 02:03:04.639 align:start position:0%
resources from the federal workforce
 
02:03:06.629 --> 02:03:06.639 align:start position:0%
opportunity investment act
 
02:03:08.550 --> 02:03:08.560 align:start position:0%
um so i just had the opportunity to
 
02:03:10.310 --> 02:03:10.320 align:start position:0%
speak with the commissioner and that is
 
02:03:12.470 --> 02:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
a concern because it would use resources
 
02:03:14.629 --> 02:03:14.639 align:start position:0%
from a federal program and we believe
 
02:03:16.229 --> 02:03:16.239 align:start position:0%
that would violate
 
02:03:18.390 --> 02:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
our obligations
 
02:03:21.109 --> 02:03:21.119 align:start position:0%
under this federal program in terms of
 
02:03:23.510 --> 02:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
how we disseminate those funds
 
02:03:25.910 --> 02:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
and the effective date is a concern as
 
02:03:25.920 --> 02:03:27.589 align:start position:0%
and the effective date is a concern as
well

02:03:27.589 --> 02:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:03:30.709 --> 02:03:30.719 align:start position:0%
so uh attorney pat the question then
 
02:03:33.669 --> 02:03:33.679 align:start position:0%
when we're looking at modifying how we
 
02:03:36.709 --> 02:03:36.719 align:start position:0%
use these funds from federal programs
 
02:03:38.070 --> 02:03:38.080 align:start position:0%
and we have all kinds of federal
 
02:03:40.950 --> 02:03:40.960 align:start position:0%
programs what's the process for
 
02:03:44.070 --> 02:03:44.080 align:start position:0%
realigning how we use uh can you explain
 
02:03:46.149 --> 02:03:46.159 align:start position:0%
the application process a little bit or
 
02:03:52.229 --> 02:03:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:54.149 --> 02:03:54.159 align:start position:0%
i can speak to it in general terms
 
02:03:56.149 --> 02:03:56.159 align:start position:0%
without going into the details of this
 
02:03:58.790 --> 02:03:58.800 align:start position:0%
particular grant um you know we would
 
02:04:00.950 --> 02:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
have to look at
 
02:04:00.960 --> 02:04:02.390 align:start position:0%
have to look at
the

02:04:02.390 --> 02:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:04:04.229 --> 02:04:04.239 align:start position:0%
the requirements and obligations of that
 
02:04:06.310 --> 02:04:06.320 align:start position:0%
particular federal program and see how
 
02:04:08.470 --> 02:04:08.480 align:start position:0%
they can be uh allocated and see if
 
02:04:10.629 --> 02:04:10.639 align:start position:0%
there's any
 
02:04:13.990 --> 02:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity for a waiver
 
02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.310 align:start position:0%
opportunity for a waiver
okay

02:04:16.310 --> 02:04:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:16.320 --> 02:04:17.189 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:04:17.189 --> 02:04:17.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:04:19.430 --> 02:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
are there other questions that may be
 
02:04:21.669 --> 02:04:21.679 align:start position:0%
directed to department of education that
 
02:04:21.679 --> 02:04:27.350 align:start position:0%
directed to department of education that
attorney

02:04:27.350 --> 02:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:29.830 --> 02:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
yeah i just wanted to make sure i
 
02:04:29.840 --> 02:04:31.750 align:start position:0%
yeah i just wanted to make sure i
understand

02:04:31.750 --> 02:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
understand
 
02:04:31.760 --> 02:04:33.910 align:start position:0%
understand
um

02:04:33.910 --> 02:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:36.709 --> 02:04:36.719 align:start position:0%
if we pass this and this sounded really
 
02:04:40.550 --> 02:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
good to begin with but if we pass this
 
02:04:44.629 --> 02:04:44.639 align:start position:0%
are we then violating other rsas that
 
02:04:47.030 --> 02:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
are already in existence
 
02:04:47.040 --> 02:04:49.109 align:start position:0%
are already in existence
regarding

02:04:49.109 --> 02:04:49.119 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
02:04:51.270 --> 02:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
monies for this very
 
02:04:53.189 --> 02:04:53.199 align:start position:0%
type of program
 
02:04:56.070 --> 02:04:56.080 align:start position:0%
or federal law either one
 
02:05:00.550 --> 02:05:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:03.510 --> 02:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
so the concern again if you look at line
 
02:05:06.070 --> 02:05:06.080 align:start position:0%
three on page two of fall
 
02:05:07.750 --> 02:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
is that term
 
02:05:09.830 --> 02:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
use resources from federal workforce
 
02:05:12.070 --> 02:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity investment acts and so the
 
02:05:13.589 --> 02:05:13.599 align:start position:0%
can you know the concern is that this
 
02:05:14.870 --> 02:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
would violate
 
02:05:14.880 --> 02:05:15.990 align:start position:0%
would violate
um

02:05:15.990 --> 02:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:18.229 --> 02:05:18.239 align:start position:0%
the federal program yes
 
02:05:21.430 --> 02:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
that's right
 
02:05:23.109 --> 02:05:23.119 align:start position:0%
the federal program or the federal
 
02:05:24.950 --> 02:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
application for
 
02:05:27.750 --> 02:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
how we use those monies okay thank you
 
02:05:29.030 --> 02:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
very much
 
02:05:29.040 --> 02:05:31.030 align:start position:0%
very much
diana

02:05:31.030 --> 02:05:31.040 align:start position:0%
diana
 
02:05:33.109 --> 02:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
represent milo you have your hand up for
 
02:05:35.030 --> 02:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
our questions yes i do
 
02:05:37.270 --> 02:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
mr chair i just
 
02:05:38.950 --> 02:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
we can't forget i think the essence of
 
02:05:40.550 --> 02:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
what this bill is about
 
02:05:43.189 --> 02:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
and let me quote from the bill
 
02:05:45.189 --> 02:05:45.199 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the workforce pathway
 
02:05:45.199 --> 02:05:46.229 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the workforce pathway
program

02:05:46.229 --> 02:05:46.239 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:05:48.790 --> 02:05:48.800 align:start position:0%
is to advance the skills
 
02:05:50.950 --> 02:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
and placement of unemployed
 
02:05:53.750 --> 02:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
underemployed new hampshire adults into
 
02:05:56.870 --> 02:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
high demand job entry positions by
 
02:05:59.589 --> 02:05:59.599 align:start position:0%
providing job-ready credentials through
 
02:06:03.589 --> 02:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
a certificate program further it says
 
02:06:05.350 --> 02:06:05.360 align:start position:0%
that the program shall provide training
 
02:06:08.790 --> 02:06:08.800 align:start position:0%
to furloughed laid off dislocated
 
02:06:11.109 --> 02:06:11.119 align:start position:0%
underserved and other populations
 
02:06:13.270 --> 02:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
affected by covet
 
02:06:15.669 --> 02:06:15.679 align:start position:0%
so this is an immediate issue
 
02:06:17.030 --> 02:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
and i don't see
 
02:06:19.669 --> 02:06:19.679 align:start position:0%
why this is a problem particularly when
 
02:06:21.510 --> 02:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
you have businesses
 
02:06:23.510 --> 02:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
who are saying they need this program
 
02:06:23.520 --> 02:06:24.550 align:start position:0%
who are saying they need this program
now

02:06:24.550 --> 02:06:24.560 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:06:27.270 --> 02:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
why would we want to itl this
 
02:06:28.870 --> 02:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:06:30.629 --> 02:06:30.639 align:start position:0%
i think one of the concerns uh
 
02:06:32.790 --> 02:06:32.800 align:start position:0%
representative milo is that
 
02:06:34.470 --> 02:06:34.480 align:start position:0%
and taylor
 
02:06:37.030 --> 02:06:37.040 align:start position:0%
caswell in his letter whose commissioner
 
02:06:39.030 --> 02:06:39.040 align:start position:0%
of the dea
 
02:06:42.149 --> 02:06:42.159 align:start position:0%
stated as his number one concern about
 
02:06:43.350 --> 02:06:43.360 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:06:47.030 --> 02:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
it commits owo to funding a program that
 
02:06:49.510 --> 02:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
is not currently part of the combined
 
02:06:51.350 --> 02:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
state plan
 
02:06:53.109 --> 02:06:53.119 align:start position:0%
so we have a state plan that's been
 
02:06:55.510 --> 02:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
approved federally
 
02:06:58.069 --> 02:06:58.079 align:start position:0%
and now we're going to change it can't
 
02:07:00.069 --> 02:07:00.079 align:start position:0%
we use those resources i don't believe
 
02:07:02.229 --> 02:07:02.239 align:start position:0%
we can use those resources
 
02:07:04.310 --> 02:07:04.320 align:start position:0%
i think the bill
 
02:07:07.750 --> 02:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
probably needs uh and i agree i like the
 
02:07:09.270 --> 02:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
idea of the workforce and the whole
 
02:07:11.669 --> 02:07:11.679 align:start position:0%
principle behind this but i'm concerned
 
02:07:14.790 --> 02:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
and that's why i signed on to it as a
 
02:07:17.030 --> 02:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill initially
 
02:07:19.109 --> 02:07:19.119 align:start position:0%
when i didn't see this part or
 
02:07:21.750 --> 02:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
understand this part now seeing how it
 
02:07:23.750 --> 02:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
interacts with federal dollars and the
 
02:07:25.510 --> 02:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
application has been approved by the
 
02:07:25.520 --> 02:07:26.390 align:start position:0%
application has been approved by the
feds

02:07:26.390 --> 02:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
feds
 
02:07:27.830 --> 02:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
but we're going to change it without
 
02:07:30.790 --> 02:07:30.800 align:start position:0%
that approval on the feds
 
02:07:32.550 --> 02:07:32.560 align:start position:0%
that's that's where it breaks down for
 
02:07:32.560 --> 02:07:35.430 align:start position:0%
that's that's where it breaks down for
myself

02:07:35.430 --> 02:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:37.510 --> 02:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
president porter
 
02:07:39.430 --> 02:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i have
 
02:07:42.470 --> 02:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
two parts two questions first of all um
 
02:07:44.629 --> 02:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
is that something that could be fixed
 
02:07:47.109 --> 02:07:47.119 align:start position:0%
with an amendment to this bill
 
02:07:48.790 --> 02:07:48.800 align:start position:0%
because it is important bill and if
 
02:07:51.430 --> 02:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
that's the sticking point perhaps a way
 
02:07:54.149 --> 02:07:54.159 align:start position:0%
around it could be worked
 
02:07:56.629 --> 02:07:56.639 align:start position:0%
my second um statement is i wanted to
 
02:07:59.030 --> 02:07:59.040 align:start position:0%
respond to something that representative
 
02:08:01.510 --> 02:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
foam had mentioned earlier on about
 
02:08:03.430 --> 02:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
schools not preparing
 
02:08:05.430 --> 02:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
young people for the trades
 
02:08:07.990 --> 02:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
and i just wanted to make a comment that
 
02:08:10.470 --> 02:08:10.480 align:start position:0%
yesterday i was on a zoom call where a
 
02:08:12.790 --> 02:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
superintendent of a property poor town
 
02:08:14.790 --> 02:08:14.800 align:start position:0%
was promoting the fact that he had no
 
02:08:17.189 --> 02:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
had to eliminate the elementary school
 
02:08:18.870 --> 02:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
art teacher position because they
 
02:08:20.870 --> 02:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
couldn't afford to fund it
 
02:08:23.270 --> 02:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
and in my own school district i know we
 
02:08:24.790 --> 02:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
have not had
 
02:08:26.310 --> 02:08:26.320 align:start position:0%
on campus
 
02:08:30.069 --> 02:08:30.079 align:start position:0%
a manual arts or home economics or those
 
02:08:31.830 --> 02:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
kinds of trade
 
02:08:31.840 --> 02:08:32.870 align:start position:0%
kinds of trade
courses

02:08:32.870 --> 02:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
courses
 
02:08:34.950 --> 02:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
because we could not afford to keep them
 
02:08:36.470 --> 02:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
any longer
 
02:08:38.629 --> 02:08:38.639 align:start position:0%
and those are the kinds of skills it
 
02:08:40.790 --> 02:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
seems to me that some of the that this
 
02:08:43.510 --> 02:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
bill is aimed at and if the local public
 
02:08:45.669 --> 02:08:45.679 align:start position:0%
schools can't afford to keep that
 
02:08:47.990 --> 02:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
those kinds of programs running in their
 
02:08:50.550 --> 02:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
districts then this kind of a program is
 
02:08:53.030 --> 02:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
exactly what some people might need to
 
02:08:55.750 --> 02:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
get those skills so i i really wish
 
02:08:57.830 --> 02:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
there was some way that you this
 
02:08:59.350 --> 02:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
committee could figure out how to fix
 
02:09:01.669 --> 02:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
this bill so we could move it forward
 
02:09:04.229 --> 02:09:04.239 align:start position:0%
for the benefit of people who just like
 
02:09:06.870 --> 02:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
a representative milo red who this bill
 
02:09:08.470 --> 02:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
is geared towards
 
02:09:09.669 --> 02:09:09.679 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:09:11.669 --> 02:09:11.679 align:start position:0%
yes as you bring up a couple good points
 
02:09:13.669 --> 02:09:13.679 align:start position:0%
there represent porter one of the
 
02:09:15.669 --> 02:09:15.679 align:start position:0%
concerns another concern that i had
 
02:09:18.149 --> 02:09:18.159 align:start position:0%
after thinking about this is that it
 
02:09:20.229 --> 02:09:20.239 align:start position:0%
gives authority for administering this
 
02:09:22.149 --> 02:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
program to the community college system
 
02:09:23.350 --> 02:09:23.360 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
02:09:25.189 --> 02:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
they're now going to be administering a
 
02:09:28.629 --> 02:09:28.639 align:start position:0%
program that impacts high school kids
 
02:09:30.550 --> 02:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
and career technical education there's
 
02:09:33.030 --> 02:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
no mention of how doe is involved with
 
02:09:35.030 --> 02:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
that in in
 
02:09:35.040 --> 02:09:36.629 align:start position:0%
that in in
uh

02:09:36.629 --> 02:09:36.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:09:39.109 --> 02:09:39.119 align:start position:0%
working cooperatively with the
 
02:09:40.870 --> 02:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
community college system that's not
 
02:09:44.470 --> 02:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned in this bill whatsoever
 
02:09:46.229 --> 02:09:46.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair it's interesting that
 
02:09:48.950 --> 02:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
you bring that up because i i was again
 
02:09:50.950 --> 02:09:50.960 align:start position:0%
when i was doing the substituting in the
 
02:09:53.270 --> 02:09:53.280 align:start position:0%
finance committee one of the programs
 
02:09:55.270 --> 02:09:55.280 align:start position:0%
that the department of education wanted
 
02:09:57.270 --> 02:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
to drop was i think they call it the
 
02:09:59.189 --> 02:09:59.199 align:start position:0%
running start program which is where
 
02:10:01.589 --> 02:10:01.599 align:start position:0%
high school students get credit for
 
02:10:03.189 --> 02:10:03.199 align:start position:0%
community college courses that they
 
02:10:06.149 --> 02:10:06.159 align:start position:0%
would take um and the community colleges
 
02:10:08.149 --> 02:10:08.159 align:start position:0%
were eager to take that on and took on
 
02:10:10.310 --> 02:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
that responsibility because they felt it
 
02:10:13.830 --> 02:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
was an important thing so i i'm seeing
 
02:10:16.069 --> 02:10:16.079 align:start position:0%
that the community colleges
 
02:10:17.589 --> 02:10:17.599 align:start position:0%
most likely would be
 
02:10:19.910 --> 02:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
perfectly fine with administering this
 
02:10:19.920 --> 02:10:21.510 align:start position:0%
perfectly fine with administering this
program

02:10:21.510 --> 02:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:10:24.069 --> 02:10:24.079 align:start position:0%
given what they said what the testimony
 
02:10:25.830 --> 02:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
was that they said during the finance
 
02:10:25.840 --> 02:10:29.510 align:start position:0%
was that they said during the finance
committee

02:10:29.510 --> 02:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:29.520 --> 02:10:31.030 align:start position:0%
 
further

02:10:31.030 --> 02:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
further
 
02:10:33.189 --> 02:10:33.199 align:start position:0%
representative cornelia i'll just point
 
02:10:34.709 --> 02:10:34.719 align:start position:0%
out that
 
02:10:38.149 --> 02:10:38.159 align:start position:0%
there is a state workforce innovation
 
02:10:40.629 --> 02:10:40.639 align:start position:0%
board swib
 
02:10:43.990 --> 02:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
that improves all these players
 
02:10:45.350 --> 02:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
the board
 
02:10:48.870 --> 02:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
they came up with this state plan
 
02:10:48.880 --> 02:10:50.149 align:start position:0%
they came up with this state plan
um

02:10:50.149 --> 02:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:50.159 --> 02:10:51.189 align:start position:0%
um
would

02:10:51.189 --> 02:10:51.199 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:10:53.830 --> 02:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
this board
 
02:10:56.629 --> 02:10:56.639 align:start position:0%
workforce innovation be supplanted by
 
02:11:02.870 --> 02:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:06.470 --> 02:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
and that that that goes to number two in
 
02:11:09.430 --> 02:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:11.189 --> 02:11:11.199 align:start position:0%
uh concerns
 
02:11:13.350 --> 02:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
where he says many of our partnerships
 
02:11:18.629 --> 02:11:18.639 align:start position:0%
we have in owo and on the statewide
 
02:11:18.639 --> 02:11:19.589 align:start position:0%
we have in owo and on the statewide
board

02:11:19.589 --> 02:11:19.599 align:start position:0%
board
 
02:11:21.430 --> 02:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
already provide these services a more
 
02:11:23.350 --> 02:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
effective method of addressing workforce
 
02:11:25.350 --> 02:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
gaps would be to evaluate existing
 
02:11:27.990 --> 02:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
programs and see if there are other ways
 
02:11:29.910 --> 02:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
to integrate them with existing and
 
02:11:33.910 --> 02:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:36.390 --> 02:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
represent us
 
02:11:38.629 --> 02:11:38.639 align:start position:0%
well i guess i was following up the
 
02:11:38.639 --> 02:11:40.390 align:start position:0%
well i guess i was following up the
question

02:11:40.390 --> 02:11:40.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:11:44.790 --> 02:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
is there an amendment is this just
 
02:11:48.310 --> 02:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
violate too many of our our of our
 
02:11:55.750 --> 02:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:59.589 --> 02:11:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:01.189 --> 02:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
the only other way i involve doing
 
02:12:02.950 --> 02:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
something because there are some issues
 
02:12:06.390 --> 02:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
that are real serious issues is to
 
02:12:08.390 --> 02:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
either one retain it
 
02:12:08.400 --> 02:12:09.189 align:start position:0%
either one retain it
or

02:12:09.189 --> 02:12:09.199 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:12:11.910 --> 02:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
or um
 
02:12:14.069 --> 02:12:14.079 align:start position:0%
or change the bill into a study
 
02:12:16.550 --> 02:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
committee and i don't want to do that
 
02:12:19.510 --> 02:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
because we have a board to do that
 
02:12:21.270 --> 02:12:21.280 align:start position:0%
so the only other option i would think
 
02:12:23.589 --> 02:12:23.599 align:start position:0%
would be to retain it
 
02:12:26.790 --> 02:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
and and get the statewide board that's
 
02:12:28.709 --> 02:12:28.719 align:start position:0%
responsible for all these partnerships
 
02:12:28.719 --> 02:12:29.910 align:start position:0%
responsible for all these partnerships
together

02:12:29.910 --> 02:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
together
 
02:12:32.069 --> 02:12:32.079 align:start position:0%
and see where they're coming out so then
 
02:12:35.510 --> 02:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
we could make a recommendation uh
 
02:12:37.109 --> 02:12:37.119 align:start position:0%
following the summer when we come back
 
02:12:37.119 --> 02:12:38.069 align:start position:0%
following the summer when we come back
again

02:12:38.069 --> 02:12:38.079 align:start position:0%
again
 
02:12:40.870 --> 02:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh this bill will be taken up and with
 
02:12:42.629 --> 02:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
recommendations and with mending
 
02:12:43.990 --> 02:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
language we might be able to do
 
02:12:45.910 --> 02:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
something but not oppositional to
 
02:12:48.390 --> 02:12:48.400 align:start position:0%
retaining that i'm not oppositionally so
 
02:12:51.189 --> 02:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
would it make more sense to retain it or
 
02:12:53.510 --> 02:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
to just start from scratch and come up
 
02:13:01.030 --> 02:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:03.990 --> 02:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
i think there are many issues including
 
02:13:08.390 --> 02:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:12.069 --> 02:13:12.079 align:start position:0%
wiser to itl this people can look at all
 
02:13:15.669 --> 02:13:15.679 align:start position:0%
those issues over the summer talk to the
 
02:13:17.830 --> 02:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
state board
 
02:13:21.109 --> 02:13:21.119 align:start position:0%
talk to other players in the process
 
02:13:21.119 --> 02:13:22.390 align:start position:0%
talk to other players in the process
and

02:13:22.390 --> 02:13:22.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:13:26.229 --> 02:13:26.239 align:start position:0%
see if there is a reasonable
 
02:13:27.669 --> 02:13:27.679 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation that could be
 
02:13:31.109 --> 02:13:31.119 align:start position:0%
introduced next year
 
02:13:33.430 --> 02:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
we apparently have two departments that
 
02:13:36.149 --> 02:13:36.159 align:start position:0%
are absolutely bea and the department of
 
02:13:38.390 --> 02:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
education has questions as well
 
02:13:40.229 --> 02:13:40.239 align:start position:0%
so i would say there's two commissioners
 
02:13:43.350 --> 02:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
there that have concerns i don't think
 
02:13:45.430 --> 02:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
they're saying we're against workforce
 
02:13:46.629 --> 02:13:46.639 align:start position:0%
development that's not what they're
 
02:13:48.310 --> 02:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
saying they're just saying we have a
 
02:13:50.229 --> 02:13:50.239 align:start position:0%
statewide plan and we've got that
 
02:13:52.470 --> 02:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
combined plan we've got to work within
 
02:13:54.550 --> 02:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
the limits of that plan
 
02:13:56.550 --> 02:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
and this bill seems to be jumping ahead
 
02:13:58.390 --> 02:13:58.400 align:start position:0%
of the plan and
 
02:14:00.310 --> 02:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
utilizing resources in a way that had
 
02:14:02.709 --> 02:14:02.719 align:start position:0%
not been approved by the vets earlier
 
02:14:02.719 --> 02:14:04.310 align:start position:0%
not been approved by the vets earlier
so

02:14:04.310 --> 02:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:14:07.109 --> 02:14:07.119 align:start position:0%
i i i tend to agree with representative
 
02:14:09.910 --> 02:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
also that there are a lot of issues here
 
02:14:09.920 --> 02:14:11.750 align:start position:0%
also that there are a lot of issues here
and

02:14:11.750 --> 02:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:14:15.430 --> 02:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't negate that the statewide
 
02:14:16.470 --> 02:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:14:19.109 --> 02:14:19.119 align:start position:0%
combined state plan group to to look at
 
02:14:19.119 --> 02:14:20.229 align:start position:0%
combined state plan group to to look at
this

02:14:20.229 --> 02:14:20.239 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:14:21.910 --> 02:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
they don't need to be directed by us to
 
02:14:28.550 --> 02:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:31.830 --> 02:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
yeah it was a follow-on to what you said
 
02:14:31.840 --> 02:14:32.790 align:start position:0%
yeah it was a follow-on to what you said
um

02:14:32.790 --> 02:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:35.830 --> 02:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
it occurs to me that if we ipl this we
 
02:14:38.390 --> 02:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
may not be able to come up with
 
02:14:40.390 --> 02:14:40.400 align:start position:0%
a bill that does the same thing next
 
02:14:40.400 --> 02:14:41.350 align:start position:0%
a bill that does the same thing next
year

02:14:41.350 --> 02:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:14:44.149 --> 02:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
that if we retain it we can so should we
 
02:14:45.669 --> 02:14:45.679 align:start position:0%
not be paying yeah
 
02:14:48.709 --> 02:14:48.719 align:start position:0%
that's correct if you if you itl bill
 
02:14:50.470 --> 02:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
you cannot bring up a similar bill in
 
02:14:51.990 --> 02:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
the same
 
02:14:54.149 --> 02:14:54.159 align:start position:0%
biennium so does it make no sense to
 
02:14:55.990 --> 02:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
retain it
 
02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.229 align:start position:0%
retain it
i

02:14:58.229 --> 02:14:58.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:58.239 --> 02:14:59.030 align:start position:0%
 
i

02:14:59.030 --> 02:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:15:00.709 --> 02:15:00.719 align:start position:0%
follow up to my previous comment i i
 
02:15:02.790 --> 02:15:02.800 align:start position:0%
don't see that it would be uh
 
02:15:05.030 --> 02:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily a similar bill i think that
 
02:15:07.189 --> 02:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
there are so many issues that it's going
 
02:15:10.470 --> 02:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
to be a much different program that what
 
02:15:12.470 --> 02:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
we have before us now
 
02:15:13.669 --> 02:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure we're not
 
02:15:15.669 --> 02:15:15.679 align:start position:0%
limiting yourself that's all conjecture
 
02:15:17.350 --> 02:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
too from everybody here we don't know
 
02:15:19.030 --> 02:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
what would happen right
 
02:15:21.589 --> 02:15:21.599 align:start position:0%
because i i hate to lose what we're
 
02:15:23.510 --> 02:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
trying to do
 
02:15:26.390 --> 02:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
but this isn't the way to do it
 
02:15:27.990 --> 02:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
but how do we
 
02:15:29.510 --> 02:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
do it i guess
 
02:15:31.350 --> 02:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
well you know when something comes to us
 
02:15:33.750 --> 02:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
where there's some significant problems
 
02:15:35.589 --> 02:15:35.599 align:start position:0%
especially when you're down to the 11th
 
02:15:38.310 --> 02:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
hour on the 11th day 11th month here
 
02:15:40.870 --> 02:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
um it's it's um
 
02:15:42.470 --> 02:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
can't be done
 
02:15:45.030 --> 02:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
you you've got either you know if it's
 
02:15:49.990 --> 02:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:51.589 --> 02:15:51.599 align:start position:0%
i would say there's some issues there
 
02:15:52.629 --> 02:15:52.639 align:start position:0%
that are
 
02:15:56.470 --> 02:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
really deep wide-ranging issues
 
02:15:58.870 --> 02:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
that i don't think that by retaining
 
02:15:58.880 --> 02:15:59.669 align:start position:0%
that i don't think that by retaining
what

02:15:59.669 --> 02:15:59.679 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:16:07.830 --> 02:16:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:09.430 --> 02:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
yes um
 
02:16:11.910 --> 02:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
i see this bill as
 
02:16:14.069 --> 02:16:14.079 align:start position:0%
an implementation a
 
02:16:16.950 --> 02:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
a way to get things rolling
 
02:16:19.910 --> 02:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh gets things starting and in a
 
02:16:21.589 --> 02:16:21.599 align:start position:0%
centralized way
 
02:16:24.229 --> 02:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
versus the silo way that's been talked
 
02:16:25.589 --> 02:16:25.599 align:start position:0%
about with the
 
02:16:25.599 --> 02:16:26.629 align:start position:0%
about with the
um

02:16:26.629 --> 02:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:28.709 --> 02:16:28.719 align:start position:0%
different commissions on workforce
 
02:16:30.390 --> 02:16:30.400 align:start position:0%
development you know we do a little here
 
02:16:33.270 --> 02:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
a little there a little there and as
 
02:16:35.830 --> 02:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
representative milor said this is the
 
02:16:35.840 --> 02:16:36.790 align:start position:0%
representative milor said this is the
time

02:16:36.790 --> 02:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:16:39.830 --> 02:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
we're we're in a very special special
 
02:16:42.150 --> 02:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
situation that we haven't ever been in
 
02:16:44.709 --> 02:16:44.719 align:start position:0%
before with this pandemic
 
02:16:46.629 --> 02:16:46.639 align:start position:0%
and we have
 
02:16:49.349 --> 02:16:49.359 align:start position:0%
a workforce issue problem
 
02:16:51.509 --> 02:16:51.519 align:start position:0%
uh it's very apparent we hear it in the
 
02:16:53.190 --> 02:16:53.200 align:start position:0%
news every day
 
02:16:55.270 --> 02:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
02:16:57.910 --> 02:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
i don't personally see
 
02:16:57.920 --> 02:16:58.709 align:start position:0%
i don't personally see
how

02:16:58.709 --> 02:16:58.719 align:start position:0%
how
 
02:17:01.750 --> 02:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
this bill could not be amended
 
02:17:05.110 --> 02:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
um or changed so that we could keep this
 
02:17:08.549 --> 02:17:08.559 align:start position:0%
uh this idea rolling i think
 
02:17:10.709 --> 02:17:10.719 align:start position:0%
representative ford wants to keep it
 
02:17:13.190 --> 02:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
rolling but as representative lake has
 
02:17:16.070 --> 02:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
pointed out if it's similar bill
 
02:17:18.309 --> 02:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
um there's always the possibility that
 
02:17:20.709 --> 02:17:20.719 align:start position:0%
it can't be introduced next term and by
 
02:17:20.719 --> 02:17:21.589 align:start position:0%
it can't be introduced next term and by
then

02:17:21.589 --> 02:17:21.599 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:17:23.509 --> 02:17:23.519 align:start position:0%
you know who knows what the economic
 
02:17:25.589 --> 02:17:25.599 align:start position:0%
situation is going to be
 
02:17:29.030 --> 02:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
so um i would definitely say
 
02:17:31.429 --> 02:17:31.439 align:start position:0%
that we should either amend this or
 
02:17:34.709 --> 02:17:34.719 align:start position:0%
retain it but definitely not to itl it
 
02:17:39.509 --> 02:17:39.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:39.519 --> 02:17:41.349 align:start position:0%
 
again

02:17:41.349 --> 02:17:41.359 align:start position:0%
again
 
02:17:43.349 --> 02:17:43.359 align:start position:0%
i'm still trying to work all of this out
 
02:17:45.750 --> 02:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
because i very much as i said liked the
 
02:17:48.389 --> 02:17:48.399 align:start position:0%
idea and like the idea of this i know
 
02:17:49.750 --> 02:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
there's a need
 
02:17:52.150 --> 02:17:52.160 align:start position:0%
on the other hand if we pass something
 
02:17:54.830 --> 02:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
that violates our own
 
02:17:57.589 --> 02:17:57.599 align:start position:0%
laws it's not going to work and so
 
02:17:59.830 --> 02:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
clearly we can't pass this
 
02:18:01.750 --> 02:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
as it is because it violates our own
 
02:18:05.190 --> 02:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
laws and so the question is just what is
 
02:18:07.270 --> 02:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
the best way to move forward
 
02:18:11.509 --> 02:18:11.519 align:start position:0%
the question is what are our own laws
 
02:18:13.990 --> 02:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
and as long as we can put in that new
 
02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:14.870 align:start position:0%
and as long as we can put in that new
bill

02:18:14.870 --> 02:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:18:16.230 --> 02:18:16.240 align:start position:0%
which um
 
02:18:18.309 --> 02:18:18.319 align:start position:0%
representative ford was talking about
 
02:18:18.319 --> 02:18:19.830 align:start position:0%
representative ford was talking about
doing

02:18:19.830 --> 02:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
doing
 
02:18:22.389 --> 02:18:22.399 align:start position:0%
is there a way can we ask the clerk or
 
02:18:22.399 --> 02:18:23.349 align:start position:0%
is there a way can we ask the clerk or
something

02:18:23.349 --> 02:18:23.359 align:start position:0%
something
 
02:18:26.389 --> 02:18:26.399 align:start position:0%
i know we have the answers right here
 
02:18:27.910 --> 02:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
we can either
 
02:18:29.830 --> 02:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
retain the bill
 
02:18:32.790 --> 02:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
and you can do something you can pull
 
02:18:35.509 --> 02:18:35.519 align:start position:0%
people together and okay how can we move
 
02:18:37.750 --> 02:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
in this direction but you can't move in
 
02:18:39.349 --> 02:18:39.359 align:start position:0%
that direction until you've got it
 
02:18:41.349 --> 02:18:41.359 align:start position:0%
approved by the feds
 
02:18:44.230 --> 02:18:44.240 align:start position:0%
if you're going to use federal dollars
 
02:18:46.549 --> 02:18:46.559 align:start position:0%
so do we have somebody from the fed who
 
02:18:46.559 --> 02:18:47.830 align:start position:0%
so do we have somebody from the fed who
can

02:18:47.830 --> 02:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
can
 
02:18:49.669 --> 02:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
well i know
 
02:18:57.990 --> 02:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:00.389 --> 02:19:00.399 align:start position:0%
acceptance from the feds to modify the
 
02:19:02.070 --> 02:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
plan that we have
 
02:19:05.990 --> 02:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
our waiver yeah and i i i'm not an
 
02:19:09.110 --> 02:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
administrator over at doe or at uh
 
02:19:11.110 --> 02:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
at the bea
 
02:19:13.110 --> 02:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
and i don't know that process well
 
02:19:13.120 --> 02:19:14.070 align:start position:0%
and i don't know that process well
enough

02:19:14.070 --> 02:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
enough
 
02:19:16.070 --> 02:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:19:18.389 --> 02:19:18.399 align:start position:0%
i guess at this point in time
 
02:19:20.790 --> 02:19:20.800 align:start position:0%
um i like to call a caucus amongst
 
02:19:23.750 --> 02:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
republicans here to discuss this
 
02:19:23.760 --> 02:19:25.110 align:start position:0%
republicans here to discuss this
um

02:19:25.110 --> 02:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:29.589 --> 02:19:29.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:32.230 --> 02:19:32.240 align:start position:0%
15 or 20 minutes
 
02:19:35.910 --> 02:19:35.920 align:start position:0%
and and uh uh try to resolve this so
 
02:19:38.150 --> 02:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
this afternoon after lunch we can do the
 
02:19:38.160 --> 02:19:39.469 align:start position:0%
this afternoon after lunch we can do the
140

02:19:39.469 --> 02:19:39.479 align:start position:0%
140
 
02:19:41.509 --> 02:19:41.519 align:start position:0%
7148 thing
 
02:19:43.349 --> 02:19:43.359 align:start position:0%
uh and try to get this thing resolved
 
02:19:45.910 --> 02:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
right now if we can't before lunch
 
02:19:48.790 --> 02:19:48.800 align:start position:0%
so we'll call it caucus here it's by the
 
02:19:51.270 --> 02:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
clock on the wall here
 
02:19:54.870 --> 02:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
the computer clock says 124.
 
02:19:58.550 --> 02:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
okay so you want to say 11 45
 
02:20:02.630 --> 02:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
yeah let's let's come back at 11 45 or
 
02:20:03.990 --> 02:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
let's give it a little bit longer than
 
02:20:05.349 --> 02:20:05.359 align:start position:0%
that about another five minutes we'll
 
02:20:08.710 --> 02:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
come back at 11 uh 50
 
02:20:11.190 --> 02:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
and and uh and we will be cognizing at
 
02:20:12.389 --> 02:20:12.399 align:start position:0%
the same time
 
02:20:14.389 --> 02:20:14.399 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:21:02.550 --> 02:21:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:04.710 --> 02:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
thank you arthur
 
02:21:05.910 --> 02:21:05.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:21:09.349 --> 02:21:09.359 align:start position:0%
for picking up the sphere of who is it
 
02:21:24.630 --> 02:21:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:24.640 --> 02:21:26.790 align:start position:0%
 
about

02:21:26.790 --> 02:21:26.800 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:21:28.550 --> 02:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
that's where that is
 
02:21:28.560 --> 02:21:32.230 align:start position:0%
that's where that is
so

02:21:32.230 --> 02:21:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:36.389 --> 02:21:36.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:38.870 --> 02:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
talk for a few minutes
 
02:21:38.880 --> 02:21:59.429 align:start position:0%
talk for a few minutes
representatives

02:21:59.429 --> 02:21:59.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:59.439 --> 02:39:49.190 align:start position:0%
 
march

02:39:49.190 --> 02:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:15.910 --> 02:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:17.990 --> 02:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
yeah i am rick uh
 
02:40:21.349 --> 02:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
so i'm talking
 
02:40:22.469 --> 02:40:22.479 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
02:40:24.230 --> 02:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
so uh what
 
02:40:27.270 --> 02:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
what we would be prepared to do is
 
02:40:28.710 --> 02:40:28.720 align:start position:0%
that if uh
 
02:40:31.670 --> 02:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
if the itl could be defeated we would
 
02:40:33.910 --> 02:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
support the retention of this
 
02:40:34.790 --> 02:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
so that
 
02:40:36.309 --> 02:40:36.319 align:start position:0%
the respective parties could get
 
02:40:37.910 --> 02:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
together and try to work on something
 
02:40:41.030 --> 02:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
that could bring it back uh next session
 
02:40:42.950 --> 02:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
so what we're going to do now that i'd
 
02:40:45.030 --> 02:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
like to do it quickly if we could i'm
 
02:40:46.469 --> 02:40:46.479 align:start position:0%
going to ask the maker the motion to
 
02:40:52.230 --> 02:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:52.240 --> 02:40:53.429 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:40:53.429 --> 02:40:53.439 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:40:53.439 --> 02:40:54.150 align:start position:0%
okay
so

02:40:54.150 --> 02:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:40:54.160 --> 02:40:55.590 align:start position:0%
so
um

02:40:55.590 --> 02:40:55.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:57.830 --> 02:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
that that's where we're coming
 
02:40:59.510 --> 02:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
down on it uh
 
02:41:01.830 --> 02:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
we like the idea workforce we really
 
02:41:04.150 --> 02:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
think it's important but we there's some
 
02:41:06.150 --> 02:41:06.160 align:start position:0%
we got to work with the commissioners
 
02:41:08.309 --> 02:41:08.319 align:start position:0%
from these various organizations all the
 
02:41:11.030 --> 02:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
partners and getting that plan to make
 
02:41:12.710 --> 02:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
sure the plan we're not screwing it up
 
02:41:14.230 --> 02:41:14.240 align:start position:0%
with the keynote
 
02:41:14.240 --> 02:41:17.670 align:start position:0%
with the keynote
so

02:41:17.670 --> 02:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:19.030 --> 02:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
okay that's good and that's that's kind
 
02:41:20.950 --> 02:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
of what oliver was talking about too so
 
02:41:22.790 --> 02:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh so let's just move that way and we'll

thank you all these amendments that i'm
 
03:52:54.150 --> 03:52:54.160 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm dealing with we're all sent out
 
03:52:56.309 --> 03:52:56.319 align:start position:0%
to the full committee uh if you're a
 
03:52:58.389 --> 03:52:58.399 align:start position:0%
substitute you probably don't have that
 
03:52:59.910 --> 03:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
that's right i have the others but i
 
03:53:01.590 --> 03:53:01.600 align:start position:0%
don't have this one
 
03:53:03.590 --> 03:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
yeah okay thank you
 
03:53:07.030 --> 03:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:08.790 --> 03:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
okay what i've done with this amendment
 
03:53:10.469 --> 03:53:10.479 align:start position:0%
rather than taking a lot of time i took
 
03:53:12.790 --> 03:53:12.800 align:start position:0%
section one deleted that section two
 
03:53:14.469 --> 03:53:14.479 align:start position:0%
deleted that
 
03:53:17.030 --> 03:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
and added underneath the delivery of
 
03:53:19.750 --> 03:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
inadequate education
 
03:53:23.110 --> 03:53:23.120 align:start position:0%
uh simply put um
 
03:53:25.670 --> 03:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
after sub graph paragraph 10 the
 
03:53:28.389 --> 03:53:28.399 align:start position:0%
following new sub uh paragraph will
 
03:53:30.790 --> 03:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
appear there for the delivery of an
 
03:53:32.630 --> 03:53:32.640 align:start position:0%
adequate education
 
03:53:34.710 --> 03:53:34.720 align:start position:0%
and it states the number and percentage
 
03:53:36.950 --> 03:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
of graduating high school students
 
03:53:39.510 --> 03:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
provided in-person school assistance in
 
03:53:41.110 --> 03:53:41.120 align:start position:0%
completing a free application for
 
03:53:42.710 --> 03:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
federal student aid
 
03:53:45.349 --> 03:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
parentheses fafsa form
 
03:53:46.550 --> 03:53:46.560 align:start position:0%
um i
 
03:53:49.030 --> 03:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
i'd like to go ahead and explain that
 
03:53:53.269 --> 03:53:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:55.590 --> 03:53:55.600 align:start position:0%
i understand that the
 
03:53:59.750 --> 03:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
need for students being aware of fafsa
 
03:54:01.510 --> 03:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
and and
 
03:54:03.269 --> 03:54:03.279 align:start position:0%
to be
 
03:54:04.790 --> 03:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
offered help
 
03:54:07.030 --> 03:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
through somebody within the school
 
03:54:07.040 --> 03:54:08.070 align:start position:0%
through somebody within the school
to

03:54:08.070 --> 03:54:08.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:54:10.950 --> 03:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
provide them uh information and how to
 
03:54:13.189 --> 03:54:13.199 align:start position:0%
file and not file but how to fill out
 
03:54:13.199 --> 03:54:14.070 align:start position:0%
file and not file but how to fill out
that

03:54:14.070 --> 03:54:14.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:54:15.990 --> 03:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
application i do not
 
03:54:18.630 --> 03:54:18.640 align:start position:0%
have not incorporated in the number and
 
03:54:20.150 --> 03:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
percentage of graduating high school
 
03:54:22.630 --> 03:54:22.640 align:start position:0%
students filing on that patient because
 
03:54:24.710 --> 03:54:24.720 align:start position:0%
that is information sometimes
 
03:54:26.710 --> 03:54:26.720 align:start position:0%
very personal appearance and they file
 
03:54:29.269 --> 03:54:29.279 align:start position:0%
that without the school knowing that
 
03:54:31.910 --> 03:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
and i believe it's what we need to know
 
03:54:33.269 --> 03:54:33.279 align:start position:0%
as a school
 
03:54:35.269 --> 03:54:35.279 align:start position:0%
is in support of what i
 
03:54:38.150 --> 03:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
have here in a magazine called next
 
03:54:38.160 --> 03:54:39.750 align:start position:0%
have here in a magazine called next
education

03:54:39.750 --> 03:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
education
 
03:54:42.630 --> 03:54:42.640 align:start position:0%
this is a a journal provided to the
 
03:54:44.389 --> 03:54:44.399 align:start position:0%
education committee
 
03:54:44.399 --> 03:54:45.269 align:start position:0%
education committee
and

03:54:45.269 --> 03:54:45.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:54:47.189 --> 03:54:47.199 align:start position:0%
i'm going to read just a small part of
 
03:54:49.429 --> 03:54:49.439 align:start position:0%
what a high-touch nudge would be in
 
03:54:52.630 --> 03:54:52.640 align:start position:0%
terms of helping kids with fafsa
 
03:54:54.630 --> 03:54:54.640 align:start position:0%
graduating seniors were provided and
 
03:54:57.349 --> 03:54:57.359 align:start position:0%
this is in a a situation where they
 
03:54:59.429 --> 03:54:59.439 align:start position:0%
tried to
 
03:55:01.349 --> 03:55:01.359 align:start position:0%
find out one of the best ways of
 
03:55:03.590 --> 03:55:03.600 align:start position:0%
supporting kids with fafsa
 
03:55:05.429 --> 03:55:05.439 align:start position:0%
graduating students were providing
 
03:55:07.269 --> 03:55:07.279 align:start position:0%
in-person assistance over three
 
03:55:10.229 --> 03:55:10.239 align:start position:0%
workshops to help choose a program they
 
03:55:12.710 --> 03:55:12.720 align:start position:0%
would likely get into applied to that
 
03:55:15.429 --> 03:55:15.439 align:start position:0%
program and applied for financial aid
 
03:55:17.510 --> 03:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
college enrollment increased by five
 
03:55:17.520 --> 03:55:18.389 align:start position:0%
college enrollment increased by five
percent

03:55:18.389 --> 03:55:18.399 align:start position:0%
percent
 
03:55:21.510 --> 03:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
percentage points overall and by nine
 
03:55:23.510 --> 03:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
percentage points among those not
 
03:55:26.790 --> 03:55:26.800 align:start position:0%
enrolled in university track courses
 
03:55:29.750 --> 03:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
so there is some benefit to our working
 
03:55:31.590 --> 03:55:31.600 align:start position:0%
with kids
 
03:55:33.590 --> 03:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
the last part i'd like to read
 
03:55:36.469 --> 03:55:36.479 align:start position:0%
they're very short a high-touch nudge
 
03:55:40.150 --> 03:55:40.160 align:start position:0%
for example and helping kids apply to
 
03:55:42.710 --> 03:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
college and understanding the fafsa
 
03:55:44.710 --> 03:55:44.720 align:start position:0%
it is perhaps not surprising that
 
03:55:46.710 --> 03:55:46.720 align:start position:0%
person-to-person interactions are more
 
03:55:50.070 --> 03:55:50.080 align:start position:0%
persuasive compared to text messages
 
03:55:52.070 --> 03:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
email or mail
 
03:55:54.469 --> 03:55:54.479 align:start position:0%
interventions using real people
 
03:55:56.469 --> 03:55:56.479 align:start position:0%
offering up-close help such as
 
03:55:58.790 --> 03:55:58.800 align:start position:0%
application assistance coaching or
 
03:56:01.670 --> 03:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
tutoring show more consistent positive
 
03:56:04.070 --> 03:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
impacts than low-touch cut
 
03:56:07.030 --> 03:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
touch cut not just for doing the the
 
03:56:08.630 --> 03:56:08.640 align:start position:0%
fafsa such as
 
03:56:10.630 --> 03:56:10.640 align:start position:0%
just providing it to the kids and saying
 
03:56:13.030 --> 03:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
go you fill it out or sending it home
 
03:56:13.040 --> 03:56:14.150 align:start position:0%
go you fill it out or sending it home
and

03:56:14.150 --> 03:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:56:16.389 --> 03:56:16.399 align:start position:0%
by way of the kid to the parents to say
 
03:56:19.110 --> 03:56:19.120 align:start position:0%
parents donut parents have had a lot of
 
03:56:21.750 --> 03:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
difficulty in filling out the fafsa and
 
03:56:23.030 --> 03:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
in order to
 
03:56:25.510 --> 03:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
be accepted for pell grant money you
 
03:56:27.670 --> 03:56:27.680 align:start position:0%
need to fill the fafsa
 
03:56:30.870 --> 03:56:30.880 align:start position:0%
and so it's my feeling here where we put
 
03:56:32.309 --> 03:56:32.319 align:start position:0%
down the
 
03:56:35.269 --> 03:56:35.279 align:start position:0%
indicators of uh what we're doing in
 
03:56:37.030 --> 03:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
support of delivering an adequate
 
03:56:39.910 --> 03:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
education we'd add one underneath all
 
03:56:41.429 --> 03:56:41.439 align:start position:0%
the others which talk about the number
 
03:56:41.439 --> 03:56:42.150 align:start position:0%
the others which talk about the number
of

03:56:42.150 --> 03:56:42.160 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:56:44.150 --> 03:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
kids graduating the number of kids etc
 
03:56:46.790 --> 03:56:46.800 align:start position:0%
going on to the military and it lists a
 
03:56:49.189 --> 03:56:49.199 align:start position:0%
whole list of things which indicate
 
03:56:52.309 --> 03:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
whether we are doing our job as an
 
03:56:54.070 --> 03:56:54.080 align:start position:0%
education body
 
03:56:56.150 --> 03:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
uh this one right here just asked for
 
03:56:57.990 --> 03:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
the number percentage of graduating high
 
03:57:00.070 --> 03:57:00.080 align:start position:0%
school students provided
 
03:57:02.309 --> 03:57:02.319 align:start position:0%
in-person school assistance
 
03:57:05.830 --> 03:57:05.840 align:start position:0%
now i've gotten a spreadsheet here from
 
03:57:07.429 --> 03:57:07.439 align:start position:0%
various school districts within our
 
03:57:10.229 --> 03:57:10.239 align:start position:0%
state and it varies widely
 
03:57:12.469 --> 03:57:12.479 align:start position:0%
widely there are some school districts
 
03:57:14.710 --> 03:57:14.720 align:start position:0%
that have less than 20 percent of their
 
03:57:17.189 --> 03:57:17.199 align:start position:0%
kids that are graduating filling out the
 
03:57:17.199 --> 03:57:18.630 align:start position:0%
kids that are graduating filling out the
fafsa

03:57:18.630 --> 03:57:18.640 align:start position:0%
fafsa
 
03:57:20.229 --> 03:57:20.239 align:start position:0%
there are other districts which is more
 
03:57:22.229 --> 03:57:22.239 align:start position:0%
the norm or the middle of somewhere
 
03:57:24.150 --> 03:57:24.160 align:start position:0%
around 39
 
03:57:26.550 --> 03:57:26.560 align:start position:0%
to 40 45
 
03:57:28.309 --> 03:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
but then we have some districts which
 
03:57:28.319 --> 03:57:29.030 align:start position:0%
but then we have some districts which
are

03:57:29.030 --> 03:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:57:31.590 --> 03:57:31.600 align:start position:0%
really doing a great job in it
 
03:57:34.389 --> 03:57:34.399 align:start position:0%
uh for example lincoln woodstock 60 to
 
03:57:36.630 --> 03:57:36.640 align:start position:0%
64 percent fill it out
 
03:57:39.189 --> 03:57:39.199 align:start position:0%
extra 60 64
 
03:57:42.229 --> 03:57:42.239 align:start position:0%
portsmouth 60 64 percent bow school
 
03:57:44.710 --> 03:57:44.720 align:start position:0%
district 60 64
 
03:57:47.429 --> 03:57:47.439 align:start position:0%
colebrook the same hollis brookline
 
03:57:49.510 --> 03:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
70 to 74
 
03:57:52.229 --> 03:57:52.239 align:start position:0%
profile up above franconia
 
03:57:55.189 --> 03:57:55.199 align:start position:0%
um 70 to 74
 
03:57:57.910 --> 03:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
and the virtual learning academy charter
 
03:58:01.349 --> 03:58:01.359 align:start position:0%
school 75 to 79 percent
 
03:58:04.309 --> 03:58:04.319 align:start position:0%
gets 70 to 74 i just jumped around son
 
03:58:06.469 --> 03:58:06.479 align:start position:0%
of peace 70 to 74
 
03:58:08.229 --> 03:58:08.239 align:start position:0%
but there's many that are down in the
 
03:58:10.710 --> 03:58:10.720 align:start position:0%
30s the question is why
 
03:58:13.990 --> 03:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
and but we this stuff comes to us from
 
03:58:14.000 --> 03:58:14.710 align:start position:0%
and but we this stuff comes to us from
the

03:58:14.710 --> 03:58:14.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:58:16.710 --> 03:58:16.720 align:start position:0%
national clearinghouse
 
03:58:19.990 --> 03:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
not from the state of new hampshire
 
03:58:22.550 --> 03:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
so i believe that this is important but
 
03:58:24.630 --> 03:58:24.640 align:start position:0%
we don't need all the other stuff on top
 
03:58:26.389 --> 03:58:26.399 align:start position:0%
of this i believe we should enter in
 
03:58:29.189 --> 03:58:29.199 align:start position:0%
where it's required for
 
03:58:30.630 --> 03:58:30.640 align:start position:0%
kids to be
 
03:58:31.830 --> 03:58:31.840 align:start position:0%
in person
 
03:58:35.110 --> 03:58:35.120 align:start position:0%
work with at school or in a work session
 
03:58:37.510 --> 03:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
with parents after school like one of
 
03:58:38.950 --> 03:58:38.960 align:start position:0%
the school districts does with three
 
03:58:40.550 --> 03:58:40.560 align:start position:0%
separate work sessions
 
03:58:43.349 --> 03:58:43.359 align:start position:0%
very very helpful so i think this should
 
03:58:45.830 --> 03:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
help it also help us help those school
 
03:58:48.389 --> 03:58:48.399 align:start position:0%
districts which are not doing this
 
03:58:50.790 --> 03:58:50.800 align:start position:0%
and to be aware so we can encourage
 
03:58:53.590 --> 03:58:53.600 align:start position:0%
everybody to have that opportunity to
 
03:58:56.630 --> 03:58:56.640 align:start position:0%
complete the fafsa and get support if
 
03:58:59.990 --> 03:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
there are disadvantaged to go to um
 
03:59:01.990 --> 03:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
college or university
 
03:59:03.590 --> 03:59:03.600 align:start position:0%
should be noted that this filling out
 
03:59:06.389 --> 03:59:06.399 align:start position:0%
the fafsa is most beneficial to kids who
 
03:59:08.710 --> 03:59:08.720 align:start position:0%
come from poverty situations
 
03:59:11.990 --> 03:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:14.710 --> 03:59:14.720 align:start position:0%
further discussion uh uh represent
 
03:59:14.720 --> 03:59:16.870 align:start position:0%
further discussion uh uh represent
porter

03:59:16.870 --> 03:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
porter
 
03:59:18.870 --> 03:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair it kind of struck me
 
03:59:21.110 --> 03:59:21.120 align:start position:0%
when you were reading those um the lists
 
03:59:22.710 --> 03:59:22.720 align:start position:0%
of um
 
03:59:24.830 --> 03:59:24.840 align:start position:0%
school districts where there was a high
 
03:59:28.630 --> 03:59:28.640 align:start position:0%
percentage of applicants
 
03:59:31.349 --> 03:59:31.359 align:start position:0%
filling out the the fafsa seem to be
 
03:59:34.870 --> 03:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:34.880 --> 03:59:35.910 align:start position:0%
 
have

03:59:35.910 --> 03:59:35.920 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:59:39.110 --> 03:59:39.120 align:start position:0%
a population that's highly educated or
 
03:59:41.349 --> 03:59:41.359 align:start position:0%
has a high proportion of college
 
03:59:43.030 --> 03:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
educated parents
 
03:59:44.469 --> 03:59:44.479 align:start position:0%
that may be
 
03:59:47.590 --> 03:59:47.600 align:start position:0%
encouraging and aware of the process
 
03:59:51.590 --> 03:59:51.600 align:start position:0%
more so than perhaps in my district
 
03:59:53.990 --> 03:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
and also seem to be the schools that are
 
03:59:55.429 --> 03:59:55.439 align:start position:0%
well funded
 
03:59:55.439 --> 03:59:56.469 align:start position:0%
well funded
and

03:59:56.469 --> 03:59:56.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:59:58.630 --> 03:59:58.640 align:start position:0%
possibly have available
 
04:00:00.950 --> 04:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
the manpower to meet
 
04:00:03.910 --> 04:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
with the students more frequently
 
04:00:05.990 --> 04:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
than others districts do so would be
 
04:00:08.309 --> 04:00:08.319 align:start position:0%
interesting to find those statistics as
 
04:00:08.319 --> 04:00:09.830 align:start position:0%
interesting to find those statistics as
well

04:00:09.830 --> 04:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:00:12.389 --> 04:00:12.399 align:start position:0%
the number of guidance counselors per
 
04:00:14.710 --> 04:00:14.720 align:start position:0%
student for example or
 
04:00:17.030 --> 04:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
the socioeconomic
 
04:00:18.870 --> 04:00:18.880 align:start position:0%
status of the families might be
 
04:00:20.950 --> 04:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
interesting too so i would think that
 
04:00:23.349 --> 04:00:23.359 align:start position:0%
keeping this requirement in the bill
 
04:00:25.670 --> 04:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
would help the communities that are
 
04:00:28.870 --> 04:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
having that aren't aren't so gifted to
 
04:00:30.790 --> 04:00:30.800 align:start position:0%
be aware and to work with their students
 
04:00:32.389 --> 04:00:32.399 align:start position:0%
if it's a requirement
 
04:00:34.309 --> 04:00:34.319 align:start position:0%
um might help them
 
04:00:36.630 --> 04:00:36.640 align:start position:0%
just seems to me
 
04:00:37.750 --> 04:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:00:42.389 --> 04:00:42.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:44.710 --> 04:00:44.720 align:start position:0%
fancy i've seen ants
 
04:00:48.309 --> 04:00:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:49.189 --> 04:00:49.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:00:51.429 --> 04:00:51.439 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair yeah so i
 
04:00:53.349 --> 04:00:53.359 align:start position:0%
think you know i think your comments
 
04:00:55.429 --> 04:00:55.439 align:start position:0%
relative to um
 
04:00:58.070 --> 04:00:58.080 align:start position:0%
students and and families uh receiving
 
04:01:00.550 --> 04:01:00.560 align:start position:0%
some uh assistance
 
04:01:02.790 --> 04:01:02.800 align:start position:0%
in terms of helping them complete the
 
04:01:05.750 --> 04:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
fafsa is is right on and i think part
 
04:01:09.830 --> 04:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
one of the bill as presented includes um
 
04:01:12.389 --> 04:01:12.399 align:start position:0%
uh that uh that type of assistance from
 
04:01:14.710 --> 04:01:14.720 align:start position:0%
the local school district
 
04:01:16.070 --> 04:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
um i i
 
04:01:18.150 --> 04:01:18.160 align:start position:0%
you know i picked up on the same thing
 
04:01:20.550 --> 04:01:20.560 align:start position:0%
when you were listing off the towns like
 
04:01:22.550 --> 04:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
we've been sort of doing all day
 
04:01:25.349 --> 04:01:25.359 align:start position:0%
um that that representative porter uh
 
04:01:27.910 --> 04:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
picked up on that uh that that these are
 
04:01:30.870 --> 04:01:30.880 align:start position:0%
towns across the state that um
 
04:01:32.630 --> 04:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
that um
 
04:01:35.670 --> 04:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
aren't necessarily representative of um
 
04:01:38.870 --> 04:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
of of all of our school districts
 
04:01:40.550 --> 04:01:40.560 align:start position:0%
uh in the state
 
04:01:44.790 --> 04:01:44.800 align:start position:0%
and that um that at least data
 
04:01:46.469 --> 04:01:46.479 align:start position:0%
through uh
 
04:01:48.469 --> 04:01:48.479 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire through um through at
 
04:01:50.469 --> 04:01:50.479 align:start position:0%
least the beginning part of the year
 
04:01:53.269 --> 04:01:53.279 align:start position:0%
showed that only about um 36 percent of
 
04:01:55.510 --> 04:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
high school seniors had had completed
 
04:01:56.870 --> 04:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
the fafsa
 
04:01:59.349 --> 04:01:59.359 align:start position:0%
uh for this year the year that they're
 
04:02:01.429 --> 04:02:01.439 align:start position:0%
graduating and i know obviously there's
 
04:02:03.670 --> 04:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
more time in the year and
 
04:02:06.229 --> 04:02:06.239 align:start position:0%
and uh but for a lot of these seniors
 
04:02:08.389 --> 04:02:08.399 align:start position:0%
you know we're we're um we're
 
04:02:11.110 --> 04:02:11.120 align:start position:0%
you know past decision date as far as as
 
04:02:14.389 --> 04:02:14.399 align:start position:0%
far as going on to higher education
 
04:02:17.429 --> 04:02:17.439 align:start position:0%
and uh getting an early jump start on on
 
04:02:19.910 --> 04:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
the fafsa getting assistance from from
 
04:02:21.429 --> 04:02:21.439 align:start position:0%
the school district
 
04:02:24.229 --> 04:02:24.239 align:start position:0%
and um and letting students know you
 
04:02:24.239 --> 04:02:24.950 align:start position:0%
and um and letting students know you
know

04:02:24.950 --> 04:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:02:27.189 --> 04:02:27.199 align:start position:0%
particularly if it's dispelling
 
04:02:29.349 --> 04:02:29.359 align:start position:0%
um you know some sort of preconceived
 
04:02:31.269 --> 04:02:31.279 align:start position:0%
you know notion that no our family can't
 
04:02:31.279 --> 04:02:32.309 align:start position:0%
you know notion that no our family can't
afford

04:02:32.309 --> 04:02:32.319 align:start position:0%
afford
 
04:02:34.710 --> 04:02:34.720 align:start position:0%
uh to go to higher education and go on
 
04:02:36.070 --> 04:02:36.080 align:start position:0%
to higher education and love to do it
 
04:02:38.070 --> 04:02:38.080 align:start position:0%
but we just can't afford to do it
 
04:02:43.590 --> 04:02:43.600 align:start position:0%
um you know having uh having a fafsa
 
04:02:43.600 --> 04:02:44.790 align:start position:0%
um you know having uh having a fafsa
requirement

04:02:44.790 --> 04:02:44.800 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
04:02:46.469 --> 04:02:46.479 align:start position:0%
more importantly having having the
 
04:02:46.479 --> 04:02:47.830 align:start position:0%
more importantly having having the
district

04:02:47.830 --> 04:02:47.840 align:start position:0%
district
 
04:02:50.229 --> 04:02:50.239 align:start position:0%
you know provide some support there and
 
04:02:52.229 --> 04:02:52.239 align:start position:0%
certainly encouragement certainly a
 
04:02:53.830 --> 04:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
graduation requirement provides some
 
04:02:56.229 --> 04:02:56.239 align:start position:0%
encouragement yes there's a waiver uh to
 
04:02:58.070 --> 04:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
it so i don't think it disenfranchises
 
04:03:00.710 --> 04:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
anybody but um
 
04:03:02.630 --> 04:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
but you know what um you know what's
 
04:03:05.429 --> 04:03:05.439 align:start position:0%
been seen in other states
 
04:03:09.189 --> 04:03:09.199 align:start position:0%
uh like um uh like louisiana and i think
 
04:03:11.110 --> 04:03:11.120 align:start position:0%
the question came up
 
04:03:12.950 --> 04:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
you know the other week you know what's
 
04:03:16.070 --> 04:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
uh what's been the success uh there
 
04:03:19.429 --> 04:03:19.439 align:start position:0%
and in louisiana they saw um
 
04:03:23.910 --> 04:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
fafsa completion go from go from 57
 
04:03:25.990 --> 04:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
to 77
 
04:03:27.910 --> 04:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
and uh and that's pretty significant i
 
04:03:30.150 --> 04:03:30.160 align:start position:0%
think that's consistent with um
 
04:03:32.870 --> 04:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
with with at least new hampshire's um
 
04:03:35.910 --> 04:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
goals for um higher education attainment
 
04:03:38.070 --> 04:03:38.080 align:start position:0%
not talking four-year colleges not
 
04:03:39.429 --> 04:03:39.439 align:start position:0%
necessarily even talking a two-year
 
04:03:42.309 --> 04:03:42.319 align:start position:0%
associate's degree but um but high-value
 
04:03:44.630 --> 04:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
certificates things that really help to
 
04:03:44.640 --> 04:03:46.070 align:start position:0%
certificates things that really help to
um

04:03:46.070 --> 04:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:47.910 --> 04:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
uh improve
 
04:03:52.389 --> 04:03:52.399 align:start position:0%
uh uh and make an educated um
 
04:03:54.870 --> 04:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
workforce available to our um for our
 
04:03:56.389 --> 04:03:56.399 align:start position:0%
economy so
 
04:03:56.399 --> 04:03:57.349 align:start position:0%
economy so
i

04:03:57.349 --> 04:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:03:58.950 --> 04:03:58.960 align:start position:0%
don't support the amendment but do
 
04:03:58.960 --> 04:04:00.229 align:start position:0%
don't support the amendment but do
support

04:04:00.229 --> 04:04:00.239 align:start position:0%
support
 
04:04:02.309 --> 04:04:02.319 align:start position:0%
as it's laid out in
 
04:04:04.389 --> 04:04:04.399 align:start position:0%
part one of 147.
 
04:04:08.710 --> 04:04:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:10.790 --> 04:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair just uh clarify two
 
04:04:13.510 --> 04:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
clarifications um if you if you will the
 
04:04:14.870 --> 04:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
first one is
 
04:04:17.510 --> 04:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
so all of part one is going to accept
 
04:04:19.670 --> 04:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
this one amendment is that correct
 
04:04:19.680 --> 04:04:20.870 align:start position:0%
this one amendment is that correct
abstract

04:04:20.870 --> 04:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
abstract
 
04:04:23.830 --> 04:04:23.840 align:start position:0%
okay and part two of my question is when
 
04:04:25.990 --> 04:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
you're identifying in-person school
 
04:04:27.830 --> 04:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
assistance for the
 
04:04:31.990 --> 04:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:34.070 --> 04:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
does group meetings count i know a lot
 
04:04:36.070 --> 04:04:36.080 align:start position:0%
of high schools do group two three night
 
04:04:38.309 --> 04:04:38.319 align:start position:0%
group meetings does that suffice to
 
04:04:39.910 --> 04:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
counters in person are you looking
 
04:04:42.150 --> 04:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
actually to try to ascertain how many
 
04:04:44.550 --> 04:04:44.560 align:start position:0%
one-on-one with guidance counselors
 
04:04:46.950 --> 04:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
i would say that in-school uh group
 
04:04:49.429 --> 04:04:49.439 align:start position:0%
meetings after school group meetings
 
04:04:49.439 --> 04:04:50.469 align:start position:0%
meetings after school group meetings
count

04:04:50.469 --> 04:04:50.479 align:start position:0%
count
 
04:04:50.479 --> 04:04:51.269 align:start position:0%
count
okay

04:04:51.269 --> 04:04:51.279 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:04:55.670 --> 04:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:59.510 --> 04:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:14.870 --> 04:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:17.469 --> 04:05:17.479 align:start position:0%
and the students in after school as the
 
04:05:19.830 --> 04:05:19.840 align:start position:0%
nhata act
 
04:05:19.840 --> 04:05:21.189 align:start position:0%
nhata act
um

04:05:21.189 --> 04:05:21.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:23.830 --> 04:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
that does that and i remember a dozen
 
04:05:25.990 --> 04:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
years ago my granddaughter was working
 
04:05:27.990 --> 04:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
going to college i came and it was a
 
04:05:28.000 --> 04:05:28.830 align:start position:0%
going to college i came and it was a
couple

04:05:28.830 --> 04:05:28.840 align:start position:0%
couple
 
04:05:30.790 --> 04:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
meetings exactly what you're doing
 
04:05:33.910 --> 04:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
and that do this
 
04:05:35.910 --> 04:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
even go as far as
 
04:05:37.670 --> 04:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
doing the fafsa
 
04:05:39.990 --> 04:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
applying for grants applying to
 
04:05:41.830 --> 04:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
different colleges
 
04:05:44.710 --> 04:05:44.720 align:start position:0%
so their organization there's an
 
04:05:44.720 --> 04:05:47.510 align:start position:0%
so their organization there's an
organization

04:05:47.510 --> 04:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:49.510 --> 04:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
goes around to the high school i think
 
04:05:51.269 --> 04:05:51.279 align:start position:0%
they just have to be invited and they'll
 
04:06:18.070 --> 04:06:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:19.990 --> 04:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
additional language i think it just
 
04:06:21.670 --> 04:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
opens up the door
 
04:06:23.269 --> 04:06:23.279 align:start position:0%
because what happens then is what
 
04:06:33.750 --> 04:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:35.990 --> 04:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
let the students and the
 
04:06:38.070 --> 04:06:38.080 align:start position:0%
families decide what they want the kids
 
04:06:51.830 --> 04:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:53.990 --> 04:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
yes i do mr chair and
 
04:06:57.110 --> 04:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
i i'm concerned one of it seems to me
 
04:06:59.349 --> 04:06:59.359 align:start position:0%
one of the focuses of this bill is to
 
04:07:01.990 --> 04:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
help open up the eyes of students who
 
04:07:02.000 --> 04:07:03.110 align:start position:0%
help open up the eyes of students who
may

04:07:03.110 --> 04:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
may
 
04:07:05.990 --> 04:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
not be aware that they yes indeed could
 
04:07:09.670 --> 04:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
go on to a further education that that
 
04:07:13.349 --> 04:07:13.359 align:start position:0%
the cost of it might not be
 
04:07:15.349 --> 04:07:15.359 align:start position:0%
as prohibitive for them as they thought
 
04:07:17.510 --> 04:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
it was that
 
04:07:19.429 --> 04:07:19.439 align:start position:0%
if they even had an inkling in the back
 
04:07:20.950 --> 04:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
of their mind that they might want to go
 
04:07:22.710 --> 04:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
on to further education but they've
 
04:07:24.550 --> 04:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
heard how expensive it is they don't
 
04:07:25.750 --> 04:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
even try
 
04:07:25.760 --> 04:07:26.710 align:start position:0%
even try
and

04:07:26.710 --> 04:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:07:29.110 --> 04:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
to to to pursue it and i know a couple
 
04:07:30.950 --> 04:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
of very bright young people that that
 
04:07:33.189 --> 04:07:33.199 align:start position:0%
happened to over the years
 
04:07:35.030 --> 04:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
and it seems to me that the purpose of
 
04:07:38.550 --> 04:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
this making it a requirement or signing
 
04:07:42.229 --> 04:07:42.239 align:start position:0%
a waiver is to keep is to open those
 
04:07:44.950 --> 04:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
children and their families eyes to the
 
04:07:47.429 --> 04:07:47.439 align:start position:0%
possibility that yes further education
 
04:07:49.830 --> 04:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
is possible for them
 
04:07:51.830 --> 04:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
and i think that's one of the reasons
 
04:07:55.269 --> 04:07:55.279 align:start position:0%
why we're looking for 75 percent
 
04:07:58.309 --> 04:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
completion rate of the fafsa because it
 
04:08:00.309 --> 04:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
means that all those kids are now
 
04:08:02.309 --> 04:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
realizing that yeah they can they can
 
04:08:03.910 --> 04:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
maybe go on to school afterwards if they
 
04:08:07.830 --> 04:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
want and by just putting it in as a as a
 
04:08:07.840 --> 04:08:09.269 align:start position:0%
want and by just putting it in as a as a
statistic

04:08:09.269 --> 04:08:09.279 align:start position:0%
statistic
 
04:08:09.279 --> 04:08:10.389 align:start position:0%
statistic
under

04:08:10.389 --> 04:08:10.399 align:start position:0%
under
 
04:08:12.150 --> 04:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
whether schools are providing an
 
04:08:15.750 --> 04:08:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:17.590 --> 04:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
it seems to not
 
04:08:20.630 --> 04:08:20.640 align:start position:0%
meet that need number one and number two
 
04:08:23.830 --> 04:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
it seems as if that
 
04:08:26.309 --> 04:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
requirement is set up to shame schools
 
04:08:28.870 --> 04:08:28.880 align:start position:0%
in a certain in a certain way well you
 
04:08:31.910 --> 04:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
know if you don't if only 25 of your
 
04:08:34.150 --> 04:08:34.160 align:start position:0%
kids are filling out fastest you mustn't
 
04:08:36.309 --> 04:08:36.319 align:start position:0%
be doing a good job
 
04:08:37.990 --> 04:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
and and i just
 
04:08:40.309 --> 04:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
i disagree with that i think there are
 
04:08:42.309 --> 04:08:42.319 align:start position:0%
many reasons why kids won't be filling
 
04:08:44.229 --> 04:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
them out not necessarily that the school
 
04:08:46.710 --> 04:08:46.720 align:start position:0%
hasn't hasn't tried
 
04:08:49.110 --> 04:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
those traveling programs that go around
 
04:08:51.990 --> 04:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
to the schools they're very good but the
 
04:08:54.229 --> 04:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
parents have to be motivated to get the
 
04:08:55.830 --> 04:08:55.840 align:start position:0%
kids there
 
04:08:58.150 --> 04:08:58.160 align:start position:0%
or or the kids have to be motivated to
 
04:09:01.429 --> 04:09:01.439 align:start position:0%
get themselves there
 
04:09:03.269 --> 04:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
and that's defeating the purpose too of
 
04:09:06.389 --> 04:09:06.399 align:start position:0%
opening some eyes so i really would
 
04:09:08.229 --> 04:09:08.239 align:start position:0%
not be supportive of of the amendment
 
04:09:10.790 --> 04:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
and would tend to agree that section
 
04:09:13.590 --> 04:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
part one should stay in the bill
 
04:09:14.630 --> 04:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:09:17.910 --> 04:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
04:09:20.550 --> 04:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
represent cordelia thank you mr chairman
 
04:09:24.070 --> 04:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
uh i support uh this amendment i cannot
 
04:09:27.110 --> 04:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
support the language in
 
04:09:27.120 --> 04:09:27.269 align:start position:0%
support the language in
in the

04:09:27.269 --> 04:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
in the
 
04:09:29.269 --> 04:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
04:09:32.790 --> 04:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
we just heard from a representative that
 
04:09:35.189 --> 04:09:35.199 align:start position:0%
parents have to be motivated
 
04:09:37.510 --> 04:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
well here in the original bill
 
04:09:40.070 --> 04:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
what motivation is there in order to get
 
04:09:42.790 --> 04:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
a high school diploma you have to fill
 
04:09:46.950 --> 04:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:46.960 --> 04:09:47.750 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:09:47.750 --> 04:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:09:47.760 --> 04:09:49.990 align:start position:0%
so
requiring

04:09:49.990 --> 04:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
requiring
 
04:09:53.189 --> 04:09:53.199 align:start position:0%
the parent to fill out waivers is not
 
04:09:55.590 --> 04:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
much of a motivation factor what if the
 
04:09:58.229 --> 04:09:58.239 align:start position:0%
parent says i'm not going to fill out
 
04:10:00.150 --> 04:10:00.160 align:start position:0%
this waiver you know we have problems
 
04:10:02.150 --> 04:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
getting information from parents so many
 
04:10:05.030 --> 04:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
times already um what happens if the
 
04:10:07.830 --> 04:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
parent doesn't feel out of weight
 
04:10:10.469 --> 04:10:10.479 align:start position:0%
you know are they not uh not graduate
 
04:10:11.670 --> 04:10:11.680 align:start position:0%
the student
 
04:10:12.950 --> 04:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
um so i
 
04:10:15.910 --> 04:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
i think uh without this amendment uh
 
04:10:19.030 --> 04:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
part one is an unworkable and uh example
 
04:10:21.910 --> 04:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
of government overreach
 
04:10:21.920 --> 04:10:22.830 align:start position:0%
of government overreach
further

04:10:22.830 --> 04:10:22.840 align:start position:0%
further
 
04:10:25.910 --> 04:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
comments represent uh
 
04:10:25.920 --> 04:10:29.590 align:start position:0%
comments represent uh
andres

04:10:29.590 --> 04:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:31.510 --> 04:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
04:10:33.030 --> 04:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
the original
 
04:10:36.229 --> 04:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
part one i am against but i
 
04:10:38.710 --> 04:10:38.720 align:start position:0%
support this amendment
 
04:10:41.830 --> 04:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
because we shouldn't be mandating any
 
04:10:41.840 --> 04:10:42.710 align:start position:0%
because we shouldn't be mandating any
more

04:10:42.710 --> 04:10:42.720 align:start position:0%
more
 
04:10:42.720 --> 04:10:43.750 align:start position:0%
more
but

04:10:43.750 --> 04:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:10:46.389 --> 04:10:46.399 align:start position:0%
parents and their students need to do in
 
04:10:48.790 --> 04:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
order for a person to graduate
 
04:10:50.950 --> 04:10:50.960 align:start position:0%
also in this day and age i know my
 
04:10:53.510 --> 04:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
school district and i imagine it's in
 
04:10:55.349 --> 04:10:55.359 align:start position:0%
most school districts
 
04:10:58.710 --> 04:10:58.720 align:start position:0%
emails go out to parents all the time on
 
04:11:01.349 --> 04:11:01.359 align:start position:0%
all different subjects and everything
 
04:11:03.189 --> 04:11:03.199 align:start position:0%
and there's no reason
 
04:11:03.199 --> 04:11:04.550 align:start position:0%
and there's no reason
information

04:11:04.550 --> 04:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:11:08.309 --> 04:11:08.319 align:start position:0%
on this can be sent to the seniors and
 
04:11:10.870 --> 04:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
their parents in the high school and i
 
04:11:12.790 --> 04:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
think it should take care of the whole
 
04:11:18.070 --> 04:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:20.150 --> 04:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
students make up the decisions that they
 
04:11:21.910 --> 04:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
want to do thank you
 
04:11:24.070 --> 04:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
04:11:27.269 --> 04:11:27.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:29.590 --> 04:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
mullen excuses
 
04:11:31.349 --> 04:11:31.359 align:start position:0%
all right it's because we look so much
 
04:11:40.870 --> 04:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:42.070 --> 04:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
just a couple of things to
 
04:11:44.950 --> 04:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli's concern about
 
04:11:44.960 --> 04:11:45.910 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli's concern about
um

04:11:45.910 --> 04:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:47.910 --> 04:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
kids not graduating if their parents
 
04:11:49.910 --> 04:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
won't sign the waiver there is a
 
04:11:53.110 --> 04:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
provision in the bill that says that if
 
04:11:55.269 --> 04:11:55.279 align:start position:0%
the student is faced with extenuating
 
04:11:55.279 --> 04:11:56.790 align:start position:0%
the student is faced with extenuating
circumstances

04:11:56.790 --> 04:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
04:11:59.269 --> 04:11:59.279 align:start position:0%
but have met all of the other graduation
 
04:12:01.510 --> 04:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
requirements then they would not
 
04:12:04.150 --> 04:12:04.160 align:start position:0%
not graduate as a result of this so
 
04:12:06.229 --> 04:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
that's one thing and the second thing
 
04:12:08.710 --> 04:12:08.720 align:start position:0%
that um the question that i actually
 
04:12:11.750 --> 04:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
have representative ladd is for you
 
04:12:13.910 --> 04:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
in looking at the amendment i understand
 
04:12:15.750 --> 04:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
the necessity to collect the data
 
04:12:17.429 --> 04:12:17.439 align:start position:0%
because we don't know where we are
 
04:12:19.110 --> 04:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
unless we
 
04:12:21.349 --> 04:12:21.359 align:start position:0%
you know get some numbers from people
 
04:12:24.070 --> 04:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
but i don't understand um what your
 
04:12:27.269 --> 04:12:27.279 align:start position:0%
vision of the mechanism for delivery of
 
04:12:29.030 --> 04:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
services is
 
04:12:30.469 --> 04:12:30.479 align:start position:0%
so how
 
04:12:30.479 --> 04:12:31.750 align:start position:0%
so how
would

04:12:31.750 --> 04:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:12:31.760 --> 04:12:33.189 align:start position:0%
would
schools

04:12:33.189 --> 04:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
schools
 
04:12:34.870 --> 04:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
feel compelled
 
04:12:38.070 --> 04:12:38.080 align:start position:0%
and how would parents feel compelled to
 
04:12:40.630 --> 04:12:40.640 align:start position:0%
work as a team to get it done
 
04:12:42.870 --> 04:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
what what is your vision of that
 
04:12:45.429 --> 04:12:45.439 align:start position:0%
i think that that's a local issue
 
04:12:47.510 --> 04:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
in person uh is
 
04:12:49.910 --> 04:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
for the school district to determine or
 
04:12:52.630 --> 04:12:52.640 align:start position:0%
the high school to determine uh just as
 
04:12:54.710 --> 04:12:54.720 align:start position:0%
long and as the student has an
 
04:12:54.720 --> 04:12:56.070 align:start position:0%
long and as the student has an
opportunity

04:12:56.070 --> 04:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
04:12:59.910 --> 04:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
to meet in person or even in a group uh
 
04:13:02.070 --> 04:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
where they work through this form but
 
04:13:05.269 --> 04:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
for us to prescribe a certain format uh
 
04:13:07.590 --> 04:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
for every school to follow i don't think
 
04:13:08.950 --> 04:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
that's going to be
 
04:13:11.910 --> 04:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
workable given the real differences in
 
04:13:13.349 --> 04:13:13.359 align:start position:0%
how we structure and organize our
 
04:13:13.359 --> 04:13:15.990 align:start position:0%
how we structure and organize our
schools

04:13:15.990 --> 04:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:21.590 --> 04:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:21.600 --> 04:13:22.550 align:start position:0%
 
further

04:13:22.550 --> 04:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
further
 
04:13:25.590 --> 04:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
comments represent cordelia
 
04:13:27.590 --> 04:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
just in relation to
 
04:13:31.349 --> 04:13:31.359 align:start position:0%
the current bill and uh
 
04:13:34.309 --> 04:13:34.319 align:start position:0%
extenuating circumstances
 
04:13:37.030 --> 04:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
so that means that if the parent does
 
04:13:38.950 --> 04:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
not fill out
 
04:13:40.630 --> 04:13:40.640 align:start position:0%
the waiver
 
04:13:40.640 --> 04:13:41.670 align:start position:0%
the waiver
uh

04:13:41.670 --> 04:13:41.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:13:43.910 --> 04:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
that that would be an extenuating
 
04:13:45.670 --> 04:13:45.680 align:start position:0%
circumstance and the child could still
 
04:13:48.229 --> 04:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
graduate so what is the purpose of
 
04:13:50.630 --> 04:13:50.640 align:start position:0%
having the requirement for a waiver in
 
04:13:55.590 --> 04:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:58.630 --> 04:13:58.640 align:start position:0%
i i i i am are you directing that to me
 
04:13:58.640 --> 04:14:00.149 align:start position:0%
i i i i am are you directing that to me
representing

04:14:00.149 --> 04:14:00.159 align:start position:0%
representing
 
04:14:02.950 --> 04:14:02.960 align:start position:0%
anybody to anybody
 
04:14:05.030 --> 04:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
i'll take a stab at it even though i was
 
04:14:07.910 --> 04:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
not involved in the in the authorship of
 
04:14:08.870 --> 04:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
04:14:12.790 --> 04:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:14.550 --> 04:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
it provides different kinds of
 
04:14:17.269 --> 04:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
information i mean filling out the the
 
04:14:19.670 --> 04:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
fafsa says we want to see whether or not
 
04:14:21.030 --> 04:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
we qualify
 
04:14:23.910 --> 04:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
filling out the waiver says we were
 
04:14:26.070 --> 04:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
given the opportunity
 
04:14:28.710 --> 04:14:28.720 align:start position:0%
but have chosen not to take it
 
04:14:31.110 --> 04:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
for whatever the reason happens to be
 
04:14:33.510 --> 04:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
whether it's because of privacy or
 
04:14:34.790 --> 04:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
because somebody doesn't think they're
 
04:14:38.389 --> 04:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
gonna meet the economic requirements or
 
04:14:41.990 --> 04:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
um but it also says that local schools
 
04:14:43.590 --> 04:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
would determine the extenuating
 
04:14:45.349 --> 04:14:45.359 align:start position:0%
circumstances so
 
04:14:46.790 --> 04:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
if your
 
04:14:50.630 --> 04:14:50.640 align:start position:0%
parents were either for incapacitated or
 
04:14:54.070 --> 04:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
unable or unwilling to participate
 
04:14:55.750 --> 04:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
then i think that
 
04:14:59.269 --> 04:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
that's an ex that is the prime example
 
04:15:01.110 --> 04:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
of when a local decision needs to be
 
04:15:02.950 --> 04:15:02.960 align:start position:0%
made by the people that know the
 
04:15:05.990 --> 04:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
children and the family and can uh you
 
04:15:06.000 --> 04:15:06.710 align:start position:0%
children and the family and can uh you
know

04:15:06.710 --> 04:15:06.720 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:15:09.110 --> 04:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
determine that something's extenuating
 
04:15:13.510 --> 04:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:14.870 --> 04:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
thank you

04:19:07.510 --> 04:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
the trailways the greyhounds the concord
 
04:19:09.269 --> 04:19:09.279 align:start position:0%
bus that type of thing
 
04:19:11.030 --> 04:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
could you please explain uh the
 
04:19:13.269 --> 04:19:13.279 align:start position:0%
amendment um
 
04:19:15.110 --> 04:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
yes um
 
04:19:15.120 --> 04:19:17.189 align:start position:0%
yes um
representative

04:19:17.189 --> 04:19:17.199 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:19:19.189 --> 04:19:19.199 align:start position:0%
woodcock and i spent a fair amount of
 
04:19:20.870 --> 04:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
time over the weekend in the beginning
 
04:19:22.389 --> 04:19:22.399 align:start position:0%
of this week
 
04:19:24.950 --> 04:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
doing a lot of research i know i talked
 
04:19:27.189 --> 04:19:27.199 align:start position:0%
to a number of different bus companies
 
04:19:29.429 --> 04:19:29.439 align:start position:0%
principals of schools
 
04:19:31.590 --> 04:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
people who plan
 
04:19:33.590 --> 04:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
the dc trips
 
04:19:36.550 --> 04:19:36.560 align:start position:0%
and we've both read
 
04:19:39.990 --> 04:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
all of the rsas concerning contract
 
04:19:41.990 --> 04:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
carriers and
 
04:19:42.000 --> 04:19:42.790 align:start position:0%
carriers and
the

04:19:42.790 --> 04:19:42.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:19:45.189 --> 04:19:45.199 align:start position:0%
ones mentioned in this part
 
04:19:47.670 --> 04:19:47.680 align:start position:0%
and we could not figure out even if we
 
04:19:50.070 --> 04:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
stood on our head and crossed our eyes
 
04:19:50.080 --> 04:19:51.110 align:start position:0%
stood on our head and crossed our eyes
how

04:19:51.110 --> 04:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
how
 
04:19:53.030 --> 04:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh part three
 
04:19:55.510 --> 04:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
section three of part three
 
04:19:59.110 --> 04:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
could possibly apply to contract carrier
 
04:19:59.120 --> 04:20:00.309 align:start position:0%
could possibly apply to contract carrier
drivers

04:20:00.309 --> 04:20:00.319 align:start position:0%
drivers
 
04:20:03.189 --> 04:20:03.199 align:start position:0%
because it has to do with schools
 
04:20:03.199 --> 04:20:04.469 align:start position:0%
because it has to do with schools
and

04:20:04.469 --> 04:20:04.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:20:07.429 --> 04:20:07.439 align:start position:0%
anyway the the
 
04:20:08.950 --> 04:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
the rsas
 
04:20:12.389 --> 04:20:12.399 align:start position:0%
if you did crazy convoluted wording and
 
04:20:15.429 --> 04:20:15.439 align:start position:0%
stuff which this doesn't do you might be
 
04:20:18.229 --> 04:20:18.239 align:start position:0%
able to figure out how to make it apply
 
04:20:19.830 --> 04:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
but it really doesn't and it really
 
04:20:21.590 --> 04:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't work
 
04:20:23.189 --> 04:20:23.199 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:20:23.199 --> 04:20:24.309 align:start position:0%
and so
um

04:20:24.309 --> 04:20:24.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:27.670 --> 04:20:27.680 align:start position:0%
what this amendment does is it takes out
 
04:20:27.680 --> 04:20:28.550 align:start position:0%
what this amendment does is it takes out
that

04:20:28.550 --> 04:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:20:30.149 --> 04:20:30.159 align:start position:0%
section three
 
04:20:33.429 --> 04:20:33.439 align:start position:0%
and the um school bus driver certificate
 
04:20:38.630 --> 04:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
to find an rsa 263 29 which is in both
 
04:20:41.110 --> 04:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
section one and section three
 
04:20:43.590 --> 04:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
um after
 
04:20:45.189 --> 04:20:45.199 align:start position:0%
after um
 
04:20:47.269 --> 04:20:47.279 align:start position:0%
rep woodcock and i
 
04:20:49.349 --> 04:20:49.359 align:start position:0%
talked about all of this i actually
 
04:20:51.670 --> 04:20:51.680 align:start position:0%
managed to get callbacks from
 
04:20:54.149 --> 04:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
other bus companies that i had managed
 
04:20:56.710 --> 04:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
to talk to earlier had a nice long
 
04:20:59.750 --> 04:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
conversation with the vice president of
 
04:21:01.590 --> 04:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
new england coach
 
04:21:03.910 --> 04:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
and answering a number of the questions
 
04:21:05.400 --> 04:21:05.410 align:start position:0%
and concerns that we had
 
04:21:05.410 --> 04:21:06.710 align:start position:0%
and concerns that we had
[Music]

04:21:06.710 --> 04:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:21:08.710 --> 04:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
one thing i asked was would they ever
 
04:21:08.720 --> 04:21:09.750 align:start position:0%
one thing i asked was would they ever
take

04:21:09.750 --> 04:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
take
 
04:21:12.950 --> 04:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
students without adult chaperones and
 
04:21:14.070 --> 04:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
she just
 
04:21:16.229 --> 04:21:16.239 align:start position:0%
just about lost into that question she
 
04:21:16.239 --> 04:21:17.349 align:start position:0%
just about lost into that question she
said

04:21:17.349 --> 04:21:17.359 align:start position:0%
said
 
04:21:19.750 --> 04:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
nobody who values their business at all
 
04:21:22.870 --> 04:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
would ever take the risk of transporting
 
04:21:22.880 --> 04:21:23.910 align:start position:0%
would ever take the risk of transporting
students

04:21:23.910 --> 04:21:23.920 align:start position:0%
students
 
04:21:23.920 --> 04:21:25.189 align:start position:0%
students
without

04:21:25.189 --> 04:21:25.199 align:start position:0%
without
 
04:21:28.389 --> 04:21:28.399 align:start position:0%
proper adult chaperones that it wasn't
 
04:21:30.870 --> 04:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
worth the liability and the risk to
 
04:21:33.670 --> 04:21:33.680 align:start position:0%
their company to do that so nobody would
 
04:21:35.030 --> 04:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
do that
 
04:21:37.750 --> 04:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
number two safety instructions one of
 
04:21:39.429 --> 04:21:39.439 align:start position:0%
the things that we were both concerned
 
04:21:40.790 --> 04:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
about was
 
04:21:43.830 --> 04:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
um how do the kids know how to use the
 
04:21:46.229 --> 04:21:46.239 align:start position:0%
emergency exits etc
 
04:21:48.630 --> 04:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
and i know when i talk to
 
04:21:50.950 --> 04:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
a principal they said they always sat
 
04:21:54.149 --> 04:21:54.159 align:start position:0%
the adults in those exit
 
04:21:56.149 --> 04:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
next to those exit windows rather than
 
04:22:00.070 --> 04:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:00.080 --> 04:22:02.790 align:start position:0%
 
coach

04:22:02.790 --> 04:22:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:06.469 --> 04:22:06.479 align:start position:0%
company she said that these days coach
 
04:22:07.830 --> 04:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
they're so
 
04:22:10.710 --> 04:22:10.720 align:start position:0%
modernized that basically the drivers
 
04:22:12.950 --> 04:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
push a button and a little
 
04:22:14.710 --> 04:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
thing comes up on the video that
 
04:22:16.950 --> 04:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
explains things like where the
 
04:22:19.670 --> 04:22:19.680 align:start position:0%
the fire extinguishers and how do the
 
04:22:21.830 --> 04:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
emergency exits work where are they out
 
04:22:23.750 --> 04:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
located and whatever just like we do on
 
04:22:23.760 --> 04:22:25.030 align:start position:0%
located and whatever just like we do on
airplane

04:22:25.030 --> 04:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
airplane
 
04:22:27.590 --> 04:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
and so it's all automated and easy and
 
04:22:29.830 --> 04:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
they just push a button and boom there
 
04:22:30.950 --> 04:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
it goes
 
04:22:33.030 --> 04:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
um and she said all of the reputable
 
04:22:34.950 --> 04:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
companies that she knows operating in
 
04:22:36.790 --> 04:22:36.800 align:start position:0%
our state do that
 
04:22:38.149 --> 04:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
so there's something they're already
 
04:22:39.750 --> 04:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
taken care of
 
04:22:41.510 --> 04:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
she also said that
 
04:22:43.269 --> 04:22:43.279 align:start position:0%
coaches and one of the things that i was
 
04:22:45.510 --> 04:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
discovering and doing
 
04:22:47.429 --> 04:22:47.439 align:start position:0%
research on this
 
04:22:51.990 --> 04:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
is extremely highly regulated federally
 
04:22:53.910 --> 04:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
so a lot of the things we were looking
 
04:22:55.750 --> 04:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
at having done
 
04:22:58.229 --> 04:22:58.239 align:start position:0%
it's like that's federal regulations
 
04:23:00.389 --> 04:23:00.399 align:start position:0%
already you know they they there are so
 
04:23:02.229 --> 04:23:02.239 align:start position:0%
many hoops they have to jump through
 
04:23:04.550 --> 04:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
just even exist
 
04:23:07.429 --> 04:23:07.439 align:start position:0%
that it takes care a number of things
 
04:23:09.820 --> 04:23:09.830 align:start position:0%
i asked her about um
 
04:23:09.830 --> 04:23:11.990 align:start position:0%
i asked her about um
[Music]

04:23:11.990 --> 04:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:23:14.469 --> 04:23:14.479 align:start position:0%
the criminal history record check and
 
04:23:16.790 --> 04:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
she said yes some schools ask about that
 
04:23:19.269 --> 04:23:19.279 align:start position:0%
and she makes sure that whatever drivers
 
04:23:20.550 --> 04:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
that drive
 
04:23:20.560 --> 04:23:21.429 align:start position:0%
that drive
for

04:23:21.429 --> 04:23:21.439 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:23:21.439 --> 04:23:22.309 align:start position:0%
for
um

04:23:22.309 --> 04:23:22.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:23.510 --> 04:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
that school
 
04:23:25.030 --> 04:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
that they have that
 
04:23:26.229 --> 04:23:26.239 align:start position:0%
they're done
 
04:23:28.710 --> 04:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
but that is done through the bus company
 
04:23:30.630 --> 04:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
not like this wants to do through the
 
04:23:33.750 --> 04:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
doe i mean the doe has no jurisdiction
 
04:23:33.760 --> 04:23:34.950 align:start position:0%
doe i mean the doe has no jurisdiction
over

04:23:34.950 --> 04:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
over
 
04:23:38.149 --> 04:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
commercial bus lines or coach lines and
 
04:23:41.349 --> 04:23:41.359 align:start position:0%
so the coach companies will do that and
 
04:23:43.110 --> 04:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
she said they would only if the school
 
04:23:43.120 --> 04:23:43.990 align:start position:0%
she said they would only if the school
says

04:23:43.990 --> 04:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
says
 
04:23:46.630 --> 04:23:46.640 align:start position:0%
we want the drivers to pass this she
 
04:23:48.070 --> 04:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
said she just make sure that whatever
 
04:23:51.110 --> 04:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
driver she sends she has on record
 
04:23:53.830 --> 04:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
you know that she's done a
 
04:23:53.840 --> 04:23:55.429 align:start position:0%
you know that she's done a
um

04:23:55.429 --> 04:23:55.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:57.590 --> 04:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
yes criminal background check and she
 
04:23:59.349 --> 04:23:59.359 align:start position:0%
has that record in the in the bus
 
04:23:59.359 --> 04:24:00.630 align:start position:0%
has that record in the in the bus
company

04:24:00.630 --> 04:24:00.640 align:start position:0%
company
 
04:24:04.229 --> 04:24:04.239 align:start position:0%
and look at some other things
 
04:24:05.990 --> 04:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
so a number i mean even the number of
 
04:24:07.349 --> 04:24:07.359 align:start position:0%
the things that are written in here
 
04:24:08.790 --> 04:24:08.800 align:start position:0%
she's like
 
04:24:10.309 --> 04:24:10.319 align:start position:0%
yeah they're not allowed on the road
 
04:24:12.309 --> 04:24:12.319 align:start position:0%
unless they do these things so they're
 
04:24:14.389 --> 04:24:14.399 align:start position:0%
already in both federal and state
 
04:24:14.399 --> 04:24:16.070 align:start position:0%
already in both federal and state
regulations

04:24:16.070 --> 04:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
04:24:18.950 --> 04:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:20.309 --> 04:24:20.319 align:start position:0%
the other thing
 
04:24:20.319 --> 04:24:21.269 align:start position:0%
the other thing
is

04:24:21.269 --> 04:24:21.279 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:24:22.830 --> 04:24:22.840 align:start position:0%
that um
 
04:24:27.830 --> 04:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
both lukak and i agreed on is that
 
04:24:31.349 --> 04:24:31.359 align:start position:0%
these coaches just by virtue of
 
04:24:33.110 --> 04:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
what they are and how they're made are
 
04:24:34.710 --> 04:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
much safer
 
04:24:36.950 --> 04:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
than a school bus anyways
 
04:24:39.030 --> 04:24:39.040 align:start position:0%
and they certainly have a lot they're a
 
04:24:41.670 --> 04:24:41.680 align:start position:0%
lot more designed for highways and
 
04:24:43.349 --> 04:24:43.359 align:start position:0%
the drivers have a lot more hours
 
04:24:45.590 --> 04:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
driving on highways and this is what
 
04:24:48.710 --> 04:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
we're talking about is highway trips
 
04:24:51.429 --> 04:24:51.439 align:start position:0%
another thing that i discovered in this
 
04:24:53.349 --> 04:24:53.359 align:start position:0%
is that um
 
04:24:55.269 --> 04:24:55.279 align:start position:0%
like our middle school
 
04:24:58.149 --> 04:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
for the ski club actually uses coaches
 
04:25:00.309 --> 04:25:00.319 align:start position:0%
and i was surprised and they said yeah
 
04:25:01.910 --> 04:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
because then they can put all the gear
 
04:25:03.990 --> 04:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
underneath instead of having it in the
 
04:25:06.950 --> 04:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
bus and i know when i chaperoned on a
 
04:25:09.269 --> 04:25:09.279 align:start position:0%
school bus from milford
 
04:25:10.950 --> 04:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
they piled all the stuff in the back of
 
04:25:12.389 --> 04:25:12.399 align:start position:0%
the bus and every time the bus went
 
04:25:14.710 --> 04:25:14.720 align:start position:0%
around to the porter it would shift and
 
04:25:16.309 --> 04:25:16.319 align:start position:0%
caught into the aisle in front of the
 
04:25:18.870 --> 04:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
exit you know the rear exit it was very
 
04:25:21.990 --> 04:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
not safe and so the idea of the coach
 
04:25:23.990 --> 04:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
and storing it underneath instead of
 
04:25:25.590 --> 04:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
having it piled up in the back of the
 
04:25:25.600 --> 04:25:26.389 align:start position:0%
having it piled up in the back of the
bus

04:25:26.389 --> 04:25:26.399 align:start position:0%
bus
 
04:25:28.469 --> 04:25:28.479 align:start position:0%
because yes i would go back and keep
 
04:25:30.550 --> 04:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
stacking it back in the seats but in the
 
04:25:32.149 --> 04:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
case of an accident
 
04:25:34.550 --> 04:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
that's going all over the place and it
 
04:25:37.110 --> 04:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
would be blocking the emergency exit
 
04:25:37.120 --> 04:25:38.630 align:start position:0%
would be blocking the emergency exit
anyways

04:25:38.630 --> 04:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
anyways
 
04:25:38.640 --> 04:25:40.630 align:start position:0%
anyways
so

04:25:40.630 --> 04:25:40.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:25:42.790 --> 04:25:42.800 align:start position:0%
but and and
 
04:25:45.830 --> 04:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
we couldn't find
 
04:25:49.030 --> 04:25:49.040 align:start position:0%
where it actually
 
04:25:50.710 --> 04:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
made it illegal
 
04:25:53.189 --> 04:25:53.199 align:start position:0%
we think it was maybe by the mission and
 
04:25:56.309 --> 04:25:56.319 align:start position:0%
that it didn't make it legal and so
 
04:25:58.630 --> 04:25:58.640 align:start position:0%
people have been doing this both
 
04:26:01.110 --> 04:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
coaches and schools for years and years
 
04:26:02.469 --> 04:26:02.479 align:start position:0%
as you know
 
04:26:04.710 --> 04:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
we haven't had problems with it
 
04:26:07.269 --> 04:26:07.279 align:start position:0%
um everybody was kind of blown away with
 
04:26:10.149 --> 04:26:10.159 align:start position:0%
what you mean this is illegal and so the
 
04:26:12.630 --> 04:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
idea this amendment is to
 
04:26:13.990 --> 04:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
make it legal
 
04:26:14.000 --> 04:26:15.590 align:start position:0%
make it legal
and

04:26:15.590 --> 04:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:26:17.830 --> 04:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
if schools want to put
 
04:26:19.590 --> 04:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
you know leave it as a local option
 
04:26:21.110 --> 04:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
because we're always talking about local
 
04:26:23.990 --> 04:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
options the school wants to put higher
 
04:26:27.110 --> 04:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
requirements on the bus company they can
 
04:26:28.149 --> 04:26:28.159 align:start position:0%
do that
 
04:26:30.550 --> 04:26:30.560 align:start position:0%
and choose a bus company that's willing
 
04:26:30.560 --> 04:26:31.429 align:start position:0%
and choose a bus company that's willing
to

04:26:31.429 --> 04:26:31.439 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:26:31.439 --> 04:26:32.630 align:start position:0%
to
um

04:26:32.630 --> 04:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:34.630 --> 04:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
do the things that they're asking
 
04:26:36.550 --> 04:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
so that's oh and the other thing was
 
04:26:36.560 --> 04:26:38.229 align:start position:0%
so that's oh and the other thing was
just

04:26:38.229 --> 04:26:38.239 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:26:40.870 --> 04:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
you know it said 75 at least 75 miles
 
04:26:40.880 --> 04:26:42.070 align:start position:0%
you know it said 75 at least 75 miles
before

04:26:42.070 --> 04:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
before
 
04:26:44.950 --> 04:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
and so we just changed it to 150 round
 
04:26:46.309 --> 04:26:46.319 align:start position:0%
trip because
 
04:26:48.790 --> 04:26:48.800 align:start position:0%
there was that 75th street around trip
 
04:26:51.510 --> 04:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
so that was the only difference in the
 
04:26:51.520 --> 04:26:53.030 align:start position:0%
so that was the only difference in the
amendment

04:26:53.030 --> 04:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:26:54.950 --> 04:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
and i'd be happy to take any questions
 
04:26:57.670 --> 04:26:57.680 align:start position:0%
because i did a lot of research
 
04:26:59.670 --> 04:26:59.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh for all that
 
04:26:59.680 --> 04:27:01.110 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh for all that
information

04:27:01.110 --> 04:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:27:01.120 --> 04:27:02.870 align:start position:0%
information
questions

04:27:02.870 --> 04:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:27:06.710 --> 04:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:10.870 --> 04:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:13.990 --> 04:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:16.149 --> 04:27:16.159 align:start position:0%
steve you're muted thank you thank you
 
04:27:18.229 --> 04:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
very much i apologize uh thank you
 
04:27:19.750 --> 04:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
chairman appreciate the chance to just
 
04:27:22.070 --> 04:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
speak a moment uh as representative
 
04:27:23.750 --> 04:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
lucas did say we did spend an anointed
 
04:27:25.429 --> 04:27:25.439 align:start position:0%
amount of time going over all these
 
04:27:27.269 --> 04:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
regulation research in them and and she
 
04:27:29.189 --> 04:27:29.199 align:start position:0%
did a wonderful job checking the bud
 
04:27:31.349 --> 04:27:31.359 align:start position:0%
services however i was surprised to see
 
04:27:32.469 --> 04:27:32.479 align:start position:0%
this amendment because i thought our
 
04:27:34.469 --> 04:27:34.479 align:start position:0%
agreement had been that we believed it
 
04:27:35.910 --> 04:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
needed more work
 
04:27:38.550 --> 04:27:38.560 align:start position:0%
uh and all we've done here is exclude
 
04:27:41.670 --> 04:27:41.680 align:start position:0%
part three the 75 mile piece i
 
04:27:43.429 --> 04:27:43.439 align:start position:0%
wasn't mistaken i thought we agreed as a
 
04:27:45.910 --> 04:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
testimony did it had to be 75 was a
 
04:27:49.110 --> 04:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
round trip but my bigger concern is that
 
04:27:52.469 --> 04:27:52.479 align:start position:0%
in this amendment as it now is presented
 
04:27:55.429 --> 04:27:55.439 align:start position:0%
my concern of the whole amendment was
 
04:27:57.510 --> 04:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
part three that dealt with the carriers
 
04:27:59.510 --> 04:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
and the safety checks record checks for
 
04:28:01.670 --> 04:28:01.680 align:start position:0%
carriers for drivers uh and that's been
 
04:28:03.750 --> 04:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
eliminated because as she as she
 
04:28:05.510 --> 04:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
indicated we couldn't come to agreement
 
04:28:07.750 --> 04:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
nor could we uh figured how was going to
 
04:28:09.670 --> 04:28:09.680 align:start position:0%
happen we thought it needed more time to
 
04:28:12.149 --> 04:28:12.159 align:start position:0%
develop the input as it is now where
 
04:28:13.830 --> 04:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
they've on
 
04:28:15.269 --> 04:28:15.279 align:start position:0%
on line
 
04:28:15.279 --> 04:28:16.630 align:start position:0%
on line
12

04:28:16.630 --> 04:28:16.640 align:start position:0%
12
 
04:28:19.269 --> 04:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
11 and 12 of the amendment
 
04:28:22.469 --> 04:28:22.479 align:start position:0%
um that brought forward it eliminates
 
04:28:24.710 --> 04:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
uh the requirement for bus driver
 
04:28:27.670 --> 04:28:27.680 align:start position:0%
certification which was on line 36 and
 
04:28:29.990 --> 04:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
37 in the in the original bill
 
04:28:31.990 --> 04:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
and i still think that's very critical
 
04:28:34.309 --> 04:28:34.319 align:start position:0%
because that that is that requiring the
 
04:28:36.790 --> 04:28:36.800 align:start position:0%
school department to do uh in the buses
 
04:28:39.750 --> 04:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
to make sure that that no one there is a
 
04:28:39.760 --> 04:28:40.710 align:start position:0%
to make sure that that no one there is a
felon

04:28:40.710 --> 04:28:40.720 align:start position:0%
felon
 
04:28:44.149 --> 04:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
no one there is a pedophile no one there
 
04:28:46.229 --> 04:28:46.239 align:start position:0%
is a drug dealer
 
04:28:46.239 --> 04:28:47.030 align:start position:0%
is a drug dealer
as

04:28:47.030 --> 04:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
as
 
04:28:48.550 --> 04:28:48.560 align:start position:0%
as i suggest they probably aren't for
 
04:28:50.710 --> 04:28:50.720 align:start position:0%
the cdl but that's the whole intent of
 
04:28:53.269 --> 04:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
having the the last part and that was
 
04:28:55.590 --> 04:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
the part that uh representative lucas
 
04:28:57.349 --> 04:28:57.359 align:start position:0%
and i had more difficulty with i thought
 
04:28:58.870 --> 04:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to try to rework
 
04:29:00.870 --> 04:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
over the summer because there has to be
 
04:29:03.590 --> 04:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
a way in my mind that we may ensure that
 
04:29:05.830 --> 04:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
the bus drivers who are driving students
 
04:29:07.510 --> 04:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
meet those requirements and that's
 
04:29:09.910 --> 04:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
that's part of what the uh
 
04:29:11.670 --> 04:29:11.680 align:start position:0%
in the original bill
 
04:29:11.680 --> 04:29:12.469 align:start position:0%
in the original bill
uh

04:29:12.469 --> 04:29:12.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:29:15.750 --> 04:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
required so i i do appreciate her effort
 
04:29:17.349 --> 04:29:17.359 align:start position:0%
on this and our effort because it did
 
04:29:19.910 --> 04:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
take a lot of time and research uh and i
 
04:29:22.469 --> 04:29:22.479 align:start position:0%
will as a side note by the way the rsa
 
04:29:24.070 --> 04:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
books that we had from four years ago
 
04:29:25.750 --> 04:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
don't have all the new bills in them but
 
04:29:28.870 --> 04:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
that that being said uh the reality is
 
04:29:31.990 --> 04:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
under 23 263 29a which is the
 
04:29:32.000 --> 04:29:33.189 align:start position:0%
under 23 263 29a which is the
certificate

04:29:33.189 --> 04:29:33.199 align:start position:0%
certificate
 
04:29:35.189 --> 04:29:35.199 align:start position:0%
uh which has been eliminated i think is
 
04:29:37.110 --> 04:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
major issues and we shouldn't eliminate
 
04:29:39.429 --> 04:29:39.439 align:start position:0%
that and and i would much prefer to
 
04:29:41.349 --> 04:29:41.359 align:start position:0%
to retain this
 
04:29:43.110 --> 04:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
or uh
 
04:29:47.110 --> 04:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
retain this uh so we can correct it uh
 
04:29:49.110 --> 04:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
because part three as it is now it just
 
04:29:51.269 --> 04:29:51.279 align:start position:0%
says okay we're just gonna say we know
 
04:29:52.950 --> 04:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
it's wrong we know it's been illegal so
 
04:29:54.550 --> 04:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
now we're just gonna say it's okay legal
 
04:29:55.990 --> 04:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
which i think is gonna come down to bite
 
04:29:58.149 --> 04:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
us later on when something happens
 
04:29:59.189 --> 04:29:59.199 align:start position:0%
because all we've done is sort of
 
04:30:00.710 --> 04:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
circumvent the issue and not corrected
 
04:30:00.720 --> 04:30:01.590 align:start position:0%
circumvent the issue and not corrected
it

04:30:01.590 --> 04:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:30:01.600 --> 04:30:02.309 align:start position:0%
it
so

04:30:02.309 --> 04:30:02.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:30:03.429 --> 04:30:03.439 align:start position:0%
that's what that's my opinion
 
04:30:04.950 --> 04:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
representative ladd
 
04:30:06.950 --> 04:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:30:09.750 --> 04:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
represent bone thank you
 
04:30:11.670 --> 04:30:11.680 align:start position:0%
we can't just be taken
 
04:30:14.870 --> 04:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
you have to retain the whole bill so i
 
04:30:16.790 --> 04:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
think if somebody thinks
 
04:30:18.630 --> 04:30:18.640 align:start position:0%
it needs more work
 
04:30:21.349 --> 04:30:21.359 align:start position:0%
then fine do more work and come back
 
04:30:24.149 --> 04:30:24.159 align:start position:0%
with another bill next year but we can't
 
04:30:26.710 --> 04:30:26.720 align:start position:0%
just retain one section we have to
 
04:30:29.990 --> 04:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
maintain the whole bill
 
04:30:31.590 --> 04:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
right which is why i
 
04:30:33.590 --> 04:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
remember we had talked about either
 
04:30:36.229 --> 04:30:36.239 align:start position:0%
eliminating the whole thing or making it
 
04:30:37.910 --> 04:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
legal and then putting more stringent
 
04:30:40.309 --> 04:30:40.319 align:start position:0%
regulations if we can figure out how to
 
04:30:43.960 --> 04:30:43.970 align:start position:0%
do it next year and so that was um
 
04:30:43.970 --> 04:30:45.510 align:start position:0%
do it next year and so that was um
[Music]

04:30:45.510 --> 04:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:30:47.910 --> 04:30:47.920 align:start position:0%
that was the way this went let's make
 
04:30:50.229 --> 04:30:50.239 align:start position:0%
sure that kids schools can legally do
 
04:30:51.750 --> 04:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
what they've been doing all this time
 
04:30:53.349 --> 04:30:53.359 align:start position:0%
without problems
 
04:30:54.870 --> 04:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
and then if we think their potential
 
04:30:57.910 --> 04:30:57.920 align:start position:0%
potentially problems add that
 
04:30:59.990 --> 04:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
next year add that piece of legislation
 
04:31:02.790 --> 04:31:02.800 align:start position:0%
in if we can find out by meeting with
 
04:31:04.710 --> 04:31:04.720 align:start position:0%
all of those people
 
04:31:06.630 --> 04:31:06.640 align:start position:0%
how to do
 
04:31:08.870 --> 04:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
criminal record checks
 
04:31:10.950 --> 04:31:10.960 align:start position:0%
but i think they're going to have to
 
04:31:13.670 --> 04:31:13.680 align:start position:0%
belong to the coach companies and not
 
04:31:15.189 --> 04:31:15.199 align:start position:0%
the doe
 
04:31:15.199 --> 04:31:16.790 align:start position:0%
the doe
um

04:31:16.790 --> 04:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:18.229 --> 04:31:18.239 align:start position:0%
and as i said
 
04:31:20.070 --> 04:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
some schools do that now
 
04:31:22.389 --> 04:31:22.399 align:start position:0%
so a school who's not who's concerned or
 
04:31:24.469 --> 04:31:24.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't trust the coach company
 
04:31:27.030 --> 04:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
they can request it and of the coaches
 
04:31:30.630 --> 04:31:30.640 align:start position:0%
now and they do
 
04:31:32.710 --> 04:31:32.720 align:start position:0%
for their discussion
 
04:31:35.189 --> 04:31:35.199 align:start position:0%
just one one follow-up one followed by
 
04:31:37.429 --> 04:31:37.439 align:start position:0%
manchester chair go ahead
 
04:31:39.189 --> 04:31:39.199 align:start position:0%
my follow-up is i'm concerned when we
 
04:31:42.950 --> 04:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
pass this this uh change with just cdls
 
04:31:44.630 --> 04:31:44.640 align:start position:0%
we're never going to see it back again
 
04:31:46.550 --> 04:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
and once we allow the requirements for
 
04:31:48.550 --> 04:31:48.560 align:start position:0%
the the uh
 
04:31:50.870 --> 04:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
school bus driver certification to be
 
04:31:52.950 --> 04:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
removed that means anytime a youngster
 
04:31:54.950 --> 04:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
gets on a regular bus it's just a cdlo
 
04:31:56.870 --> 04:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
bus it's going to be any bus in the
 
04:32:00.469 --> 04:32:00.479 align:start position:0%
world i think we're making a mistake um
 
04:32:00.479 --> 04:32:01.269 align:start position:0%
world i think we're making a mistake um
so

04:32:01.269 --> 04:32:01.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:32:02.870 --> 04:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
if representative bone i assume is
 
04:32:04.790 --> 04:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
correct he knows more than i then take
 
04:32:07.110 --> 04:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
the whole part three out and fix it but
 
04:32:09.349 --> 04:32:09.359 align:start position:0%
i i just think this is an error for
 
04:32:10.710 --> 04:32:10.720 align:start position:0%
opening the door for all kinds of
 
04:32:12.950 --> 04:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
potential issues letting any driver
 
04:32:14.790 --> 04:32:14.800 align:start position:0%
drive our kids we don't do it in the
 
04:32:16.309 --> 04:32:16.319 align:start position:0%
yellow buses but now i say we're gonna
 
04:32:17.750 --> 04:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
take we don't care about the background
 
04:32:19.110 --> 04:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
of that driver when they're doing the
 
04:32:24.149 --> 04:32:24.159 align:start position:0%
cdl's so i think that's a big big error
 
04:32:26.149 --> 04:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
thank you rep senator cornelli thank you
 
04:32:27.990 --> 04:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
i would just comment that i think the
 
04:32:29.990 --> 04:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
door is wide open now
 
04:32:35.110 --> 04:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:37.349 --> 04:32:37.359 align:start position:0%
yep that's true
 
04:32:39.429 --> 04:32:39.439 align:start position:0%
i like us yeah we've been doing this for
 
04:32:41.349 --> 04:32:41.359 align:start position:0%
years as you all know we've been doing
 
04:32:42.710 --> 04:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
this for years
 
04:32:46.630 --> 04:32:46.640 align:start position:0%
and so all this is doing is is saying
 
04:32:48.309 --> 04:32:48.319 align:start position:0%
recognizing we've been doing this for
 
04:32:49.349 --> 04:32:49.359 align:start position:0%
years and
 
04:32:52.550 --> 04:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
yes it's legal to go ahead and do it um
 
04:32:54.469 --> 04:32:54.479 align:start position:0%
but as far as taking out the school bus
 
04:32:56.550 --> 04:32:56.560 align:start position:0%
driver's certificate i talked to a
 
04:32:59.269 --> 04:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
number of bus companies and they were
 
04:32:59.279 --> 04:33:00.309 align:start position:0%
number of bus companies and they were
like

04:33:00.309 --> 04:33:00.319 align:start position:0%
like
 
04:33:02.309 --> 04:33:02.319 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be able to to
 
04:33:05.670 --> 04:33:05.680 align:start position:0%
require their drivers to have school bus
 
04:33:07.510 --> 04:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
driver certificates as well they're not
 
04:33:09.590 --> 04:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
driving school buses they're driving
 
04:33:12.150 --> 04:33:12.160 align:start position:0%
coaches and that has its own set of
 
04:33:14.709 --> 04:33:14.719 align:start position:0%
requirements and training and stuff and
 
04:33:16.230 --> 04:33:16.240 align:start position:0%
remember one of the things i was
 
04:33:18.470 --> 04:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
concerned about that caused us to go and
 
04:33:21.269 --> 04:33:21.279 align:start position:0%
look at this is
 
04:33:23.109 --> 04:33:23.119 align:start position:0%
drivers are only allowed to drive a
 
04:33:25.029 --> 04:33:25.039 align:start position:0%
certain number of hours and then they
 
04:33:27.429 --> 04:33:27.439 align:start position:0%
have to have a relief driver and you
 
04:33:28.830 --> 04:33:28.840 align:start position:0%
can't write
 
04:33:31.510 --> 04:33:31.520 align:start position:0%
this rule in
 
04:33:33.750 --> 04:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
and expect that some
 
04:33:36.949 --> 04:33:36.959 align:start position:0%
driver in north carolina that they are
 
04:33:39.109 --> 04:33:39.119 align:start position:0%
relieving the bus yes it's going to be
 
04:33:40.869 --> 04:33:40.879 align:start position:0%
with the same company but are they going
 
04:33:43.189 --> 04:33:43.199 align:start position:0%
to have our school bus driver
 
04:33:47.349 --> 04:33:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:49.670 --> 04:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
at least well two of the companies
 
04:33:52.070 --> 04:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
basically said if you put that in what's
 
04:33:53.830 --> 04:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
going to happen is coaches just aren't
 
04:33:54.869 --> 04:33:54.879 align:start position:0%
going to
 
04:33:56.629 --> 04:33:56.639 align:start position:0%
work with the schools
 
04:34:00.470 --> 04:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:02.150 --> 04:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
they have a hard enough time signing
 
04:34:04.150 --> 04:34:04.160 align:start position:0%
cdls and we have a hard enough time
 
04:34:06.470 --> 04:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
finding school bus drivers and to try to
 
04:34:08.629 --> 04:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
have to find somebody with both the cdl
 
04:34:10.830 --> 04:34:10.840 align:start position:0%
and the school bus driver certificate
 
04:34:13.269 --> 04:34:13.279 align:start position:0%
just really
 
04:34:17.750 --> 04:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:21.670 --> 04:34:21.680 align:start position:0%
okay rex and whitcock final comment
 
04:34:24.150 --> 04:34:24.160 align:start position:0%
those six words we've always done it
 
04:34:26.949 --> 04:34:26.959 align:start position:0%
this way to not justify continuing doing
 
04:34:26.959 --> 04:34:30.470 align:start position:0%
this way to not justify continuing doing
it

04:34:30.470 --> 04:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:33.830 --> 04:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
thank you represent tanner
 
04:34:36.310 --> 04:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
at at one point in my career
 
04:34:38.310 --> 04:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
uh the school bus
 
04:34:41.189 --> 04:34:41.199 align:start position:0%
group decided that coaches of small
 
04:34:42.869 --> 04:34:42.879 align:start position:0%
teams like tennis
 
04:34:46.150 --> 04:34:46.160 align:start position:0%
uh could their teacher the coach
 
04:34:47.910 --> 04:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
could get certified
 
04:34:50.070 --> 04:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
to drive the small school bus
 
04:34:51.670 --> 04:34:51.680 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:34:53.349 --> 04:34:53.359 align:start position:0%
so i ended up being a bus driver for a
 
04:34:54.949 --> 04:34:54.959 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
04:34:57.910 --> 04:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
and it really wasn't um the requirement
 
04:34:59.590 --> 04:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
the requirements for getting a school
 
04:35:00.949 --> 04:35:00.959 align:start position:0%
bus license
 
04:35:03.269 --> 04:35:03.279 align:start position:0%
was mainly the cdl
 
04:35:04.869 --> 04:35:04.879 align:start position:0%
which fortunately because i had those
 
04:35:07.670 --> 04:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
small vans i didn't have to do
 
04:35:09.990 --> 04:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
but basically it's just uh you know
 
04:35:12.070 --> 04:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
making sure you had a clean record
 
04:35:14.470 --> 04:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
uh making sure that uh you were healthy
 
04:35:16.470 --> 04:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
enough that you weren't gonna you know
 
04:35:18.869 --> 04:35:18.879 align:start position:0%
have a heart attack on the on the bus
 
04:35:21.830 --> 04:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
trip i mean it it really wasn't that and
 
04:35:23.670 --> 04:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
the criminal background check i mean it
 
04:35:24.869 --> 04:35:24.879 align:start position:0%
isn't like
 
04:35:24.879 --> 04:35:26.390 align:start position:0%
isn't like
um

04:35:26.390 --> 04:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:28.949 --> 04:35:28.959 align:start position:0%
you know you have to learn to turn the
 
04:35:31.349 --> 04:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
bus around or whatever and anyway the
 
04:35:33.670 --> 04:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
guys that do the cdl stuff they would
 
04:35:36.310 --> 04:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
know that you know from that so i don't
 
04:35:38.070 --> 04:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
think the uh
 
04:35:40.230 --> 04:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
the actual certification for school bus
 
04:35:42.869 --> 04:35:42.879 align:start position:0%
driver is that rigorous and certainly
 
04:35:44.949 --> 04:35:44.959 align:start position:0%
they are hurting for school bus drivers
 
04:35:46.869 --> 04:35:46.879 align:start position:0%
so they've made it really
 
04:35:46.879 --> 04:35:47.910 align:start position:0%
so they've made it really
um

04:35:47.910 --> 04:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:50.230 --> 04:35:50.240 align:start position:0%
not easy but they've made it
 
04:35:50.240 --> 04:35:51.429 align:start position:0%
not easy but they've made it
really

04:35:51.429 --> 04:35:51.439 align:start position:0%
really
 
04:35:52.789 --> 04:35:52.799 align:start position:0%
easy to get
 
04:35:55.269 --> 04:35:55.279 align:start position:0%
to the certification and and
 
04:35:57.510 --> 04:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
they want to put people through that
 
04:35:59.750 --> 04:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sure that
 
04:36:02.310 --> 04:36:02.320 align:start position:0%
it sounds it sounds like you think that
 
04:36:04.150 --> 04:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
school bus certification is a really
 
04:36:04.160 --> 04:36:06.070 align:start position:0%
school bus certification is a really
tough

04:36:06.070 --> 04:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
tough
 
04:36:10.470 --> 04:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:11.830 --> 04:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:36:13.349 --> 04:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
representative ford
 
04:36:15.590 --> 04:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair
 
04:36:17.910 --> 04:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if the solution lies to
 
04:36:20.390 --> 04:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
move the testing or the
 
04:36:23.189 --> 04:36:23.199 align:start position:0%
security issue from the school board
 
04:36:26.230 --> 04:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
driver to someone who's accompanying the
 
04:36:29.189 --> 04:36:29.199 align:start position:0%
students and that person being required
 
04:36:31.590 --> 04:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
to be with the students anytime they're
 
04:36:34.070 --> 04:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
in contact with the bus driver so if you
 
04:36:36.070 --> 04:36:36.080 align:start position:0%
go to north carolina and pick up another
 
04:36:37.830 --> 04:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
driver they just
 
04:36:40.470 --> 04:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
someone is always with the from your
 
04:36:43.510 --> 04:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
group is always with the bus driver so
 
04:36:45.189 --> 04:36:45.199 align:start position:0%
that that would prevent any kind of
 
04:36:47.750 --> 04:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
unpoured activities and
 
04:36:49.349 --> 04:36:49.359 align:start position:0%
you've done the same thing without
 
04:36:51.429 --> 04:36:51.439 align:start position:0%
requiring the bus company to have all of
 
04:36:53.590 --> 04:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
its drivers up and down the seashore
 
04:36:57.109 --> 04:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
have these background checks
 
04:37:00.230 --> 04:37:00.240 align:start position:0%

about the

the part
 
04:38:56.470 --> 04:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
might talk to the person making that
 
04:38:59.269 --> 04:38:59.279 align:start position:0%
final motion and incorporate that all in
 
04:39:01.189 --> 04:39:01.199 align:start position:0%
like different paragraphs within the

additional state aid for special

additional state aid for special
education

04:39:16.709 --> 04:39:16.719 align:start position:0%
education
 
04:39:18.551 --> 04:39:18.561 align:start position:0%
for certain communities of one thousand
 
04:39:20.709 --> 04:39:20.719 align:start position:0%
for fewer residents
 
04:39:22.709 --> 04:39:22.719 align:start position:0%
and relative to special education risk
 
04:39:26.629 --> 04:39:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:29.189 --> 04:39:29.199 align:start position:0%
from leon you're recognized for a motion
 
04:39:31.189 --> 04:39:31.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i would like to move
 
04:39:41.190 --> 04:39:41.200 align:start position:0%

04:39:52.070 --> 04:39:52.080 align:start position:0%

04:39:54.868 --> 04:39:54.878 align:start position:0%
uh amendment for part four that's
 
04:39:57.190 --> 04:39:57.200 align:start position:0%
fifteen fifty nine grabs and lay on to
 
04:39:59.110 --> 04:39:59.120 align:start position:0%
care to speak the emotion uh yes thank
 
04:40:00.948 --> 04:40:00.958 align:start position:0%
you mr chair
 
04:40:03.270 --> 04:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
this language is enabling language to
 
04:40:05.190 --> 04:40:05.200 align:start position:0%
offer solutions to a clear and pressing
 
04:40:07.510 --> 04:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
need as we discussed in committee
 
04:40:09.430 --> 04:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of special education funding
 
04:40:11.190 --> 04:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
comes from the local level
 
04:40:13.190 --> 04:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
we also know that budgets are set before
 
04:40:14.948 --> 04:40:14.958 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the school year and
 
04:40:17.030 --> 04:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
that even a single unexpected special
 
04:40:18.470 --> 04:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
education student would have a
 
04:40:21.190 --> 04:40:21.200 align:start position:0%
devastating impact on budgets
 
04:40:23.350 --> 04:40:23.360 align:start position:0%
this amendment is sorry today this is
 
04:40:25.190 --> 04:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
addressed two ways there's catastrophic
 
04:40:26.788 --> 04:40:26.798 align:start position:0%
aid from the state and there's
 
04:40:29.190 --> 04:40:29.200 align:start position:0%
self-insurance at the local level
 
04:40:31.190 --> 04:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
last year local school districts set
 
04:40:33.270 --> 04:40:33.280 align:start position:0%
aside six million dollars for this exact
 
04:40:33.280 --> 04:40:34.310 align:start position:0%
aside six million dollars for this exact
risk

04:40:34.310 --> 04:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
risk
 
04:40:36.070 --> 04:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
starting at section two we have a
 
04:40:38.868 --> 04:40:38.878 align:start position:0%
well-studied study purely voluntary way
 
04:40:41.110 --> 04:40:41.120 align:start position:0%
for school districts to join together to
 
04:40:44.230 --> 04:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
spread the risk of unexpected costs
 
04:40:45.990 --> 04:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
today we have the software and data
 
04:40:47.910 --> 04:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
needed to make this happen
 
04:40:50.150 --> 04:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
this data has a shelf life so if we are
 
04:40:52.470 --> 04:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
going to ever offer this option now
 
04:40:53.830 --> 04:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
that's fine
 
04:40:55.510 --> 04:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
the time is now
 
04:40:57.910 --> 04:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
worst case is the districts don't see a
 
04:40:59.830 --> 04:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
value to this and don't join together to
 
04:41:01.190 --> 04:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
form these pools
 
04:41:03.190 --> 04:41:03.200 align:start position:0%
if the pools don't offer them a value
 
04:41:04.948 --> 04:41:04.958 align:start position:0%
then there's no harm no foul all we've
 
04:41:07.350 --> 04:41:07.360 align:start position:0%
done is passed a bill
 
04:41:09.270 --> 04:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
anybody to do anything
 
04:41:11.590 --> 04:41:11.600 align:start position:0%
this all enabling language
 
04:41:14.070 --> 04:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
if they do find this valuable though we
 
04:41:16.230 --> 04:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
can solve a big issue with school school
 
04:41:19.510 --> 04:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
budgets where they can have a 300 000
 
04:41:21.270 --> 04:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
student come into the district at the
 
04:41:23.190 --> 04:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
last moment that's hard enough for a
 
04:41:25.270 --> 04:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
district like derry to absorb there's
 
04:41:28.550 --> 04:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
others with where that's absolutely fast
 
04:41:31.030 --> 04:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
so i that's why i moved on to pass on
 
04:41:32.390 --> 04:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
this amendment and i think that this
 
04:41:34.708 --> 04:41:34.718 align:start position:0%
would be very helpful for our schools
 
04:41:36.390 --> 04:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative you
 
04:41:38.868 --> 04:41:38.878 align:start position:0%

representative
 
04:41:45.830 --> 04:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
oh thank you thank you mr chairman
 
04:41:48.470 --> 04:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
now this was uh my opening comment this
 
04:41:50.708 --> 04:41:50.718 align:start position:0%
morning this was one of the pieces that
 
04:41:51.750 --> 04:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
i was
 
04:41:55.830 --> 04:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
disappointed to see in this amendment
 
04:41:57.750 --> 04:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
we as a committee
 
04:41:59.990 --> 04:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
did consider this issue
 
04:42:01.750 --> 04:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
as a matter of fact we had a substantive
 
04:42:04.550 --> 04:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
conversation about this issue
 
04:42:07.270 --> 04:42:07.280 align:start position:0%
i thought we had come to the conclusion
 
04:42:07.280 --> 04:42:08.550 align:start position:0%
i thought we had come to the conclusion
that

04:42:08.550 --> 04:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:42:10.628 --> 04:42:10.638 align:start position:0%
this may be a good idea
 
04:42:12.788 --> 04:42:12.798 align:start position:0%
but we need to have more study in this
 
04:42:14.948 --> 04:42:14.958 align:start position:0%
and it was my understanding that as a
 
04:42:17.430 --> 04:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
committee we had concluded that we
 
04:42:19.110 --> 04:42:19.120 align:start position:0%
needed to have this more of a study and
 
04:42:20.550 --> 04:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
that we needed to look at in the next
 
04:42:20.560 --> 04:42:21.670 align:start position:0%
that we needed to look at in the next
session

04:42:21.670 --> 04:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
session
 
04:42:23.670 --> 04:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
to see it in this amendment is
 
04:42:25.670 --> 04:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
disappointing because we don't have that
 
04:42:28.628 --> 04:42:28.638 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do the due diligence
 
04:42:31.830 --> 04:42:31.840 align:start position:0%
around this issue before we
 
04:42:34.628 --> 04:42:34.638 align:start position:0%
provide a piece of legislation
 
04:42:37.110 --> 04:42:37.120 align:start position:0%
we need to have this due diligence in
 
04:42:39.430 --> 04:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
order that the legislation can in fact
 
04:42:42.550 --> 04:42:42.560 align:start position:0%
be reflective of those issues the those
 
04:42:44.788 --> 04:42:44.798 align:start position:0%
states that have done similar kinds of
 
04:42:47.430 --> 04:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
things and have learned from it we have
 
04:42:49.030 --> 04:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
we have no history here in the state
 
04:42:52.070 --> 04:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
about this so i'm disappointed that that
 
04:42:53.670 --> 04:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
this is part of this amendment and i
 
04:42:55.910 --> 04:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
will not support this based upon the
 
04:42:58.470 --> 04:42:58.480 align:start position:0%
conversation and the understanding that
 
04:43:00.868 --> 04:43:00.878 align:start position:0%
i thought we had as a committee prior to
 
04:43:06.070 --> 04:43:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:06.080 --> 04:43:07.430 align:start position:0%
 
representation

04:43:07.430 --> 04:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
representation
 
04:43:09.910 --> 04:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i will note that the
 
04:43:12.150 --> 04:43:12.160 align:start position:0%
bill that this was in was heard by our
 
04:43:14.070 --> 04:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
committee passed by our committee and
 
04:43:16.150 --> 04:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
passed on the floor they ran out of time
 
04:43:17.910 --> 04:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
and finance so they retained it but this
 
04:43:19.590 --> 04:43:19.600 align:start position:0%
is something that we did have
 
04:43:21.590 --> 04:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
substantial diagram dialogue and i
 
04:43:24.390 --> 04:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely remember that conversation
 
04:43:27.670 --> 04:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative porter
 
04:43:30.150 --> 04:43:30.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um representative
 
04:43:33.190 --> 04:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
lyon i remember hearing this bill of
 
04:43:34.868 --> 04:43:34.878 align:start position:0%
parts of this bill when i was
 
04:43:36.788 --> 04:43:36.798 align:start position:0%
substituting in finance can you tell me
 
04:43:38.788 --> 04:43:38.798 align:start position:0%
what the result was from the finance
 
04:43:38.798 --> 04:43:41.270 align:start position:0%
what the result was from the finance
committee

04:43:41.270 --> 04:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:43.830 --> 04:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
thank you yes it was retained
 
04:43:45.110 --> 04:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of work that was being
 
04:43:46.390 --> 04:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
done on the budget
 
04:43:47.590 --> 04:43:47.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:43:49.910 --> 04:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:43:52.550 --> 04:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
very much for the follow-up yes earlier
 
04:43:54.070 --> 04:43:54.080 align:start position:0%
you said that it had passed this
 
04:43:57.990 --> 04:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:01.190 --> 04:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
yes it did made it to finance otherwise
 
04:44:02.868 --> 04:44:02.878 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:44:05.430 --> 04:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
613 originated in this body right here
 
04:44:07.510 --> 04:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
the education committee went on to the
 
04:44:10.470 --> 04:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
house floor was voted on and was sent to
 
04:44:10.480 --> 04:44:12.628 align:start position:0%
house floor was voted on and was sent to
finance

04:44:12.628 --> 04:44:12.638 align:start position:0%
finance
 
04:44:15.110 --> 04:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
04:44:17.590 --> 04:44:17.600 align:start position:0%
yeah my understanding this is actually
 
04:44:19.510 --> 04:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
the amendment that i was expecting based
 
04:44:22.708 --> 04:44:22.718 align:start position:0%
on conversation we had on thursday
 
04:44:22.718 --> 04:44:23.590 align:start position:0%
on conversation we had on thursday
and

04:44:23.590 --> 04:44:23.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:44:26.230 --> 04:44:26.240 align:start position:0%
my understanding was that
 
04:44:28.628 --> 04:44:28.638 align:start position:0%
yes finance was going to be working on
 
04:44:31.910 --> 04:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
it and we were waiting for the final
 
04:44:31.920 --> 04:44:33.030 align:start position:0%
it and we were waiting for the final
result

04:44:33.030 --> 04:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
result
 
04:44:33.040 --> 04:44:35.030 align:start position:0%
result
um

04:44:35.030 --> 04:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:38.788 --> 04:44:38.798 align:start position:0%
and that if we got
 
04:44:41.430 --> 04:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
the wording in time it would go into
 
04:44:43.750 --> 04:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
this amendment and apparently we didn't
 
04:44:46.070 --> 04:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
get that in time because
 
04:44:48.230 --> 04:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
it's in this amendment it's exactly what
 
04:44:50.788 --> 04:44:50.798 align:start position:0%
i was expecting from the conversations
 
04:44:53.350 --> 04:44:53.360 align:start position:0%
that we had on thursday so
 
04:44:56.310 --> 04:44:56.320 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
04:44:58.310 --> 04:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
apparently various of us were in the
 
04:45:00.788 --> 04:45:00.798 align:start position:0%
same meeting but we weren't
 
04:45:03.670 --> 04:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:07.350 --> 04:45:07.360 align:start position:0%
further comments representative mullen
 
04:45:07.360 --> 04:45:08.230 align:start position:0%
further comments representative mullen
uh

04:45:08.230 --> 04:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:45:11.030 --> 04:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
with to representative lakers's comments
 
04:45:14.708 --> 04:45:14.718 align:start position:0%
i i remember no conversation about the
 
04:45:16.470 --> 04:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
insurance risk pool
 
04:45:19.590 --> 04:45:19.600 align:start position:0%
uh last week at all so perhaps that took
 
04:45:21.430 --> 04:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
place in your caucus but i don't believe
 
04:45:23.190 --> 04:45:23.200 align:start position:0%
that it took place uh with the full
 
04:45:23.200 --> 04:45:24.390 align:start position:0%
that it took place uh with the full
committee

04:45:24.390 --> 04:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:45:27.190 --> 04:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
and i base my my opinion on the fact
 
04:45:29.830 --> 04:45:29.840 align:start position:0%
that there is another amendment to part
 
04:45:32.628 --> 04:45:32.638 align:start position:0%
four which i authored
 
04:45:35.350 --> 04:45:35.360 align:start position:0%
uh dealing with the first part which was
 
04:45:37.590 --> 04:45:37.600 align:start position:0%
the 250 000
 
04:45:41.270 --> 04:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
that we learned has not been tapped into
 
04:45:43.270 --> 04:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
for districts in need
 
04:45:43.280 --> 04:45:44.550 align:start position:0%
for districts in need
um

04:45:44.550 --> 04:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:46.788 --> 04:45:46.798 align:start position:0%
at no point in time when i was working
 
04:45:49.590 --> 04:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
on that amendment was i even considering
 
04:45:51.270 --> 04:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
the insurance risk pool and i was
 
04:45:53.670 --> 04:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
shocked as representative milor
 
04:45:57.670 --> 04:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned to see it attached to part one
 
04:46:00.310 --> 04:46:00.320 align:start position:0%
because my amendment of course now would
 
04:46:02.868 --> 04:46:02.878 align:start position:0%
reference part one and part two but was
 
04:46:06.948 --> 04:46:06.958 align:start position:0%
intended to uh eliminate part one
 
04:46:09.270 --> 04:46:09.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:46:11.350 --> 04:46:11.360 align:start position:0%
i might add that when we did discuss
 
04:46:14.310 --> 04:46:14.320 align:start position:0%
this in 613 in this committee
 
04:46:16.628 --> 04:46:16.638 align:start position:0%
we had a healthy discussion on it
 
04:46:18.310 --> 04:46:18.320 align:start position:0%
we were informed that there was an
 
04:46:20.708 --> 04:46:20.718 align:start position:0%
actuarial firm out in kansas that had
 
04:46:22.948 --> 04:46:22.958 align:start position:0%
done a calculator for us but and for the
 
04:46:24.788 --> 04:46:24.798 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
04:46:27.030 --> 04:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
and i heard testimony from our
 
04:46:29.270 --> 04:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
discussion when we had it in hearing
 
04:46:29.280 --> 04:46:30.070 align:start position:0%
discussion when we had it in hearing
that

04:46:30.070 --> 04:46:30.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:46:32.310 --> 04:46:32.320 align:start position:0%
it was a good idea and i heard that from
 
04:46:35.670 --> 04:46:35.680 align:start position:0%
both sides four parties uh a follow-up
 
04:46:38.150 --> 04:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
which mr truman
 
04:46:40.868 --> 04:46:40.878 align:start position:0%
mike my issue is not with whether or not
 
04:46:43.990 --> 04:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
it's a good idea or a bad idea my issue
 
04:46:47.750 --> 04:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
is with the fact that we had tons of
 
04:46:50.948 --> 04:46:50.958 align:start position:0%
unanswered questions and while the bill
 
04:46:52.788 --> 04:46:52.798 align:start position:0%
may have gone through
 
04:46:55.350 --> 04:46:55.360 align:start position:0%
it went through uh to give it a chance
 
04:46:58.470 --> 04:46:58.480 align:start position:0%
to get to finance who retained it
 
04:47:00.868 --> 04:47:00.878 align:start position:0%
from my perspective to get answers to
 
04:47:02.470 --> 04:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
those questions
 
04:47:05.190 --> 04:47:05.200 align:start position:0%
so that we could look with knowledge at
 
04:47:07.990 --> 04:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
what we were doing before we made a
 
04:47:10.390 --> 04:47:10.400 align:start position:0%
legitimate vote on whether or not we
 
04:47:15.270 --> 04:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
were making a seismic shift in how we uh
 
04:47:18.470 --> 04:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
reimburse for unexpected special aid
 
04:47:18.480 --> 04:47:19.990 align:start position:0%
reimburse for unexpected special aid
costs

04:47:19.990 --> 04:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
costs
 
04:47:22.788 --> 04:47:22.798 align:start position:0%
so i i just i i i
 
04:47:25.270 --> 04:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
i'm shocked that this is back before us
 
04:47:28.230 --> 04:47:28.240 align:start position:0%
without us having any discussion about
 
04:47:31.190 --> 04:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
the answers to the many many questions
 
04:47:34.310 --> 04:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:37.510 --> 04:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
further discussion from representatives
 
04:47:39.030 --> 04:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
oh i just
 
04:47:39.040 --> 04:47:40.150 align:start position:0%
oh i just
was

04:47:40.150 --> 04:47:40.160 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:47:43.670 --> 04:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
with the whether or not this was there
 
04:47:46.230 --> 04:47:46.240 align:start position:0%
i was thinking oh well maybe it was side
 
04:47:47.990 --> 04:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
conversations or whatever but it
 
04:47:50.070 --> 04:47:50.080 align:start position:0%
occurred to me i was on the zoo meeting
 
04:47:53.030 --> 04:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
last time i wasn't here and i missed our
 
04:47:56.070 --> 04:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
caucus last week so the only place i
 
04:47:57.510 --> 04:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
could have heard it
 
04:48:00.150 --> 04:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
was here was you know the same place you
 
04:48:02.310 --> 04:48:02.320 align:start position:0%
were on the zoo meeting and this is
 
04:48:04.708 --> 04:48:04.718 align:start position:0%
exactly what i was expecting so i was
 
04:48:06.550 --> 04:48:06.560 align:start position:0%
really surprised when
 
04:48:08.788 --> 04:48:08.798 align:start position:0%
when comments were made about this
 
04:48:10.868 --> 04:48:10.878 align:start position:0%
coming out of the blue i'm like wait a
 
04:48:13.030 --> 04:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
minute we talked about this
 
04:48:16.150 --> 04:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
and yes i have the same
 
04:48:22.630 --> 04:48:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:22.640 --> 04:48:24.150 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:48:24.150 --> 04:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:48:26.868 --> 04:48:26.878 align:start position:0%
thanks very much mr chair um no i mean
 
04:48:28.868 --> 04:48:28.878 align:start position:0%
this this amen you know the amendment
 
04:48:30.708 --> 04:48:30.718 align:start position:0%
that you're putting forward today is
 
04:48:33.510 --> 04:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
exactly how it came into this committee
 
04:48:36.628 --> 04:48:36.638 align:start position:0%
uh when we were executing the um uh the
 
04:48:39.590 --> 04:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
underlying bill um i i forget the bill
 
04:48:42.310 --> 04:48:42.320 align:start position:0%
number 631 something like that
 
04:48:45.510 --> 04:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
uh uh back uh back a couple months ago
 
04:48:47.350 --> 04:48:47.360 align:start position:0%
it was brought up at exec there was
 
04:48:50.868 --> 04:48:50.878 align:start position:0%
never a hearing uh held on the um
 
04:48:54.150 --> 04:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
the um uh you know the idea of of having
 
04:48:55.830 --> 04:48:55.840 align:start position:0%
a risk pool
 
04:48:58.150 --> 04:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
for special education costs
 
04:49:01.430 --> 04:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
um you know i'm concerned that um
 
04:49:03.910 --> 04:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
that that a lot of the people that uh
 
04:49:07.590 --> 04:49:07.600 align:start position:0%
that we rely on for for good information
 
04:49:09.190 --> 04:49:09.200 align:start position:0%
such as the
 
04:49:11.270 --> 04:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
school administrators association school

others haven't had any opportunity to
 
04:49:23.750 --> 04:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
provide any testimony on this and that
 
04:49:26.390 --> 04:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
at that exact session which uh which
 
04:49:28.868 --> 04:49:28.878 align:start position:0%
representative leakas was just referring
 
04:49:31.670 --> 04:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
to because the only other time we've um
 
04:49:34.470 --> 04:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
uh we've seen this language uh in front
 
04:49:38.070 --> 04:49:38.080 align:start position:0%
of us that that there was heavy reliance
 
04:49:40.470 --> 04:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
put on the finance committee that they
 
04:49:41.750 --> 04:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
would give this
 
04:49:44.948 --> 04:49:44.958 align:start position:0%
um um a financial
 
04:49:47.750 --> 04:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
element of of of this policy change a
 
04:49:49.670 --> 04:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
thorough vetting which obviously they
 
04:49:52.868 --> 04:49:52.878 align:start position:0%
didn't do so so you know i i think i
 
04:49:56.070 --> 04:49:56.080 align:start position:0%
think this is offering it again here
 
04:49:57.590 --> 04:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
is is
 
04:49:57.600 --> 04:49:59.750 align:start position:0%
is is
is

04:49:59.750 --> 04:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:50:01.910 --> 04:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
just in you know
 
04:50:03.430 --> 04:50:03.440 align:start position:0%
on its face
 
04:50:06.948 --> 04:50:06.958 align:start position:0%
um um conflicting with with even
 
04:50:08.868 --> 04:50:08.878 align:start position:0%
the um um
 
04:50:11.830 --> 04:50:11.840 align:start position:0%
even mr chair your rationale uh months
 
04:50:14.868 --> 04:50:14.878 align:start position:0%
ago on the on the uh the bill you sought
 
04:50:17.350 --> 04:50:17.360 align:start position:0%
to amend then that it would that it
 
04:50:20.150 --> 04:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
would have a um
 
04:50:23.030 --> 04:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
you know a solid vetting in the finance
 
04:50:25.430 --> 04:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
committee so i i really think this is
 
04:50:28.230 --> 04:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
not ready for prime time
 
04:50:30.868 --> 04:50:30.878 align:start position:0%
representative porter
 
04:50:33.350 --> 04:50:33.360 align:start position:0%
yes mr chair thank you for allowing me
 
04:50:35.190 --> 04:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
to speak i just got off the phone with
 
04:50:37.750 --> 04:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
representative heath um i worked that i
 
04:50:39.830 --> 04:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
worked with on the subcommittee that
 
04:50:41.270 --> 04:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
worked on this bill
 
04:50:44.230 --> 04:50:44.240 align:start position:0%
and we did retain it in um finance and
 
04:50:46.708 --> 04:50:46.718 align:start position:0%
no report has gone out yet
 
04:50:49.350 --> 04:50:49.360 align:start position:0%
so um i think it was stated earlier that
 
04:50:50.868 --> 04:50:50.878 align:start position:0%
now that we have the information from
 
04:50:53.430 --> 04:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
finance we can move forward but
 
04:50:56.470 --> 04:50:56.480 align:start position:0%
that's not happened so um
 
04:51:07.760 --> 04:51:07.770 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:07.770 --> 04:51:11.430 align:start position:0%

okay uh representative would you go
 
04:54:39.350 --> 04:54:39.360 align:start position:0%
ahead please
 
04:54:42.550 --> 04:54:42.560 align:start position:0%
sure uh when i initially proposed this
 
04:54:45.510 --> 04:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
amendment it was because i had uh
 
04:54:48.470 --> 04:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
serious concerns with
 
04:54:52.230 --> 04:54:52.240 align:start position:0%
section one of part four which was the
 
04:54:54.150 --> 04:54:54.160 align:start position:0%
allocation of two hundred and fifty
 
04:54:56.628 --> 04:54:56.638 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars to towns with less than
 
04:54:59.670 --> 04:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
a thousand people to use in unexpected
 
04:55:01.830 --> 04:55:01.840 align:start position:0%
special education costs
 
04:55:04.230 --> 04:55:04.240 align:start position:0%
my concerns were over the fact that we
 
04:55:07.110 --> 04:55:07.120 align:start position:0%
heard testimony last thursday that these
 
04:55:09.510 --> 04:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
funds were not being uh
 
04:55:12.310 --> 04:55:12.320 align:start position:0%
tapped into by communities and so the
 
04:55:14.628 --> 04:55:14.638 align:start position:0%
idea that we were going to add an
 
04:55:18.150 --> 04:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
additional 250 000
 
04:55:22.708 --> 04:55:22.718 align:start position:0%
when the original allocation of 250 000
 
04:55:25.750 --> 04:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
was not being utilized did not make a
 
04:55:27.510 --> 04:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
whole lot of sense
 
04:55:31.510 --> 04:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
it seemed to uh have problems in its
 
04:55:34.948 --> 04:55:34.958 align:start position:0%
distribution in widening disparity
 
04:55:38.230 --> 04:55:38.240 align:start position:0%
and we did not have a solution on what
 
04:55:41.110 --> 04:55:41.120 align:start position:0%
to do with cooperative school districts
 
04:55:43.430 --> 04:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
so that was my initial concern
 
04:55:45.750 --> 04:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
but since the amendment came in that
 
04:55:48.390 --> 04:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
added the insurance risk pool to the
 
04:55:52.150 --> 04:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
bill i have many many more concerns and
 
04:55:54.628 --> 04:55:54.638 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to mention some of them
 
04:55:57.030 --> 04:55:57.040 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned about the choice process
 
04:56:01.270 --> 04:56:01.280 align:start position:0%
how the five uh districts come together
 
04:56:05.350 --> 04:56:05.360 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned about the idea
 
04:56:07.190 --> 04:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
that they're supposed to be diverse in
 
04:56:10.150 --> 04:56:10.160 align:start position:0%
terms of geographic region and size but
 
04:56:12.948 --> 04:56:12.958 align:start position:0%
nobody talks about
 
04:56:14.628 --> 04:56:14.638 align:start position:0%
who's going to who's going to make those
 
04:56:17.190 --> 04:56:17.200 align:start position:0%
decisions representative you're speaking
 
04:56:20.830 --> 04:56:20.840 align:start position:0%
to the the bill as amended that first
 
04:56:23.670 --> 04:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
amendment and this particular amendment
 
04:56:27.830 --> 04:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
deals with section one of part four
 
04:56:31.430 --> 04:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the 250 000.
 
04:56:31.440 --> 04:56:32.230 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the 250 000.
so

04:56:32.230 --> 04:56:32.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:56:32.240 --> 04:56:33.030 align:start position:0%
so
uh

04:56:33.030 --> 04:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:56:33.040 --> 04:56:34.070 align:start position:0%
uh
so

04:56:34.070 --> 04:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:56:35.190 --> 04:56:35.200 align:start position:0%
am i
 
04:56:38.708 --> 04:56:38.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:40.230 --> 04:56:40.240 align:start position:0%
i mean the the
 
04:56:40.240 --> 04:56:42.390 align:start position:0%
i mean the the
amendment

04:56:42.390 --> 04:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:56:46.948 --> 04:56:46.958 align:start position:0%
specifies deleting all of part four
 
04:56:48.470 --> 04:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
we have just
 
04:56:51.270 --> 04:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
passed an amendment that expands part
 
04:56:51.280 --> 04:56:52.150 align:start position:0%
passed an amendment that expands part
four

04:56:52.150 --> 04:56:52.160 align:start position:0%
four
 
04:56:54.868 --> 04:56:54.878 align:start position:0%
to include the risk pool
 
04:56:57.830 --> 04:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
so i am under the assumption that if i
 
04:57:02.070 --> 04:57:02.080 align:start position:0%
am making a a motion to get rid of part
 
04:57:04.470 --> 04:57:04.480 align:start position:0%
four that i can now speak to both parts
 
04:57:05.910 --> 04:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
of it
 
04:57:12.230 --> 04:57:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:13.750 --> 04:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
yeah you're you're speaking to of course
 
04:57:16.628 --> 04:57:16.638 align:start position:0%
you're in 1588
 
04:57:19.030 --> 04:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
and you're speaking my amendment is to
 
04:57:21.750 --> 04:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
do away with part four which we just
 
04:57:21.760 --> 04:57:32.788 align:start position:0%
do away with part four which we just
amended

04:57:32.788 --> 04:57:32.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:34.390 --> 04:57:34.400 align:start position:0%
you're talking about amending section
 
04:57:37.270 --> 04:57:37.280 align:start position:0%
one within part four then then if you're
 
04:57:38.788 --> 04:57:38.798 align:start position:0%
saying down below amend the bill by
 
04:57:41.190 --> 04:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
deleting part four
 
04:57:42.470 --> 04:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
looks to me like you're doing two
 
04:57:44.628 --> 04:57:44.638 align:start position:0%
different things
 
04:57:49.110 --> 04:57:49.120 align:start position:0%
uh well no because we changed the bill
 
04:57:53.110 --> 04:57:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:56.708 --> 04:57:56.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:02.470 --> 04:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:04.708 --> 04:58:04.718 align:start position:0%
go ahead and speak to uh amending the
 
04:58:06.948 --> 04:58:06.958 align:start position:0%
entire bill by deleting that we'll just
 
04:58:09.830 --> 04:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
get down to the bottom line here
 
04:58:12.708 --> 04:58:12.718 align:start position:0%
all right so uh again i will go on and
 
04:58:15.990 --> 04:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
say that i'm concerned about the process
 
04:58:18.628 --> 04:58:18.638 align:start position:0%
of how the risk pools are going to be
 
04:58:20.868 --> 04:58:20.878 align:start position:0%
formed and who is going to make the
 
04:58:24.230 --> 04:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
determination on the district size
 
04:58:26.550 --> 04:58:26.560 align:start position:0%
geographic region and whether or not a
 
04:58:28.470 --> 04:58:28.480 align:start position:0%
risk pool is diverse
 
04:58:31.590 --> 04:58:31.600 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned about what happens with
 
04:58:34.070 --> 04:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
school districts that already have high
 
04:58:36.550 --> 04:58:36.560 align:start position:0%
special education costs and whether or
 
04:58:39.190 --> 04:58:39.200 align:start position:0%
not they're going to be chosen to be
 
04:58:40.628 --> 04:58:40.638 align:start position:0%
on the team
 
04:58:42.628 --> 04:58:42.638 align:start position:0%
if you will if they already have high
 
04:58:42.638 --> 04:58:44.150 align:start position:0%
if you will if they already have high
costs

04:58:44.150 --> 04:58:44.160 align:start position:0%
costs
 
04:58:46.550 --> 04:58:46.560 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned about
 
04:58:48.628 --> 04:58:48.638 align:start position:0%
who is going to protect student
 
04:58:51.030 --> 04:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
confidential information because in the
 
04:58:53.670 --> 04:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
bill it repeatedly says that that
 
04:58:55.190 --> 04:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
information will be
 
04:58:59.350 --> 04:58:59.360 align:start position:0%
protected to the extent that is possible
 
04:59:01.750 --> 04:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't define that
 
04:59:04.868 --> 04:59:04.878 align:start position:0%
and i am very concerned about the fact
 
04:59:04.878 --> 04:59:05.670 align:start position:0%
and i am very concerned about the fact
that

04:59:05.670 --> 04:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:59:08.708 --> 04:59:08.718 align:start position:0%
for the first five years the costs of
 
04:59:12.470 --> 04:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
all of this the uh filing fees the
 
04:59:14.708 --> 04:59:14.718 align:start position:0%
request for proposal education and
 
04:59:18.230 --> 04:59:18.240 align:start position:0%
training the actuarial services and cost
 
04:59:20.470 --> 04:59:20.480 align:start position:0%
predictor spreadsheet will be the
 
04:59:22.830 --> 04:59:22.840 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the department of
 
04:59:26.550 --> 04:59:26.560 align:start position:0%
education but after five years the risk
 
04:59:30.470 --> 04:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
pool itself has to assume the cost of
 
04:59:32.230 --> 04:59:32.240 align:start position:0%
all of those things
 
04:59:33.830 --> 04:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
we don't know what those costs are going
 
04:59:37.350 --> 04:59:37.360 align:start position:0%
to be we've had no estimate whatsoever
 
04:59:39.430 --> 04:59:39.440 align:start position:0%
what that price tag is going to look
 
04:59:42.708 --> 04:59:42.718 align:start position:0%
like and that ta that price is going to
 
04:59:45.510 --> 04:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
get given back to the taxpayer because
 
04:59:47.990 --> 04:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
the risks pools themselves are going to
 
04:59:49.510 --> 04:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
have to pay for this
 
04:59:49.520 --> 04:59:50.830 align:start position:0%
have to pay for this
so

04:59:50.830 --> 04:59:50.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:59:54.628 --> 04:59:54.638 align:start position:0%
um i i now believe that that this
 
04:59:57.670 --> 04:59:57.680 align:start position:0%
amendment speaks to uh deleting part
 
04:59:57.680 --> 04:59:58.628 align:start position:0%
amendment speaks to uh deleting part
four

04:59:58.628 --> 04:59:58.638 align:start position:0%
four
 
05:00:00.550 --> 05:00:00.560 align:start position:0%
i thought it was a good idea originally
 
05:00:02.868 --> 05:00:02.878 align:start position:0%
i think it's a better idea now
 
05:00:05.430 --> 05:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
and uh i
 
05:00:08.230 --> 05:00:08.240 align:start position:0%
i see the microphone
 
05:00:10.708 --> 05:00:10.718 align:start position:0%
thank you further discussion
 
05:00:12.948 --> 05:00:12.958 align:start position:0%
representative porter
 
05:00:15.110 --> 05:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i agree with
 
05:00:16.948 --> 05:00:16.958 align:start position:0%
representative mullen there's no money
 
05:00:18.868 --> 05:00:18.878 align:start position:0%
in the budget to fund the department of
 
05:00:21.030 --> 05:00:21.040 align:start position:0%
education assuming these costs and i'm
 
05:00:22.708 --> 05:00:22.718 align:start position:0%
sure that was one of the things that was
 
05:00:24.550 --> 05:00:24.560 align:start position:0%
considered when the finance committee
 
05:00:27.750 --> 05:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:31.590 --> 05:00:31.600 align:start position:0%
further discussion represent like this
 
05:00:32.830 --> 05:00:32.840 align:start position:0%
yeah at
 
05:00:35.590 --> 05:00:35.600 align:start position:0%
first i was liking
 
05:00:39.030 --> 05:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
um brett mullen's amendment because
 
05:00:42.230 --> 05:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
i wasn't big on the
 
05:00:44.390 --> 05:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
thought it was unnecessary
 
05:00:47.750 --> 05:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
for the extra 250 000 but
 
05:00:49.190 --> 05:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say they're going to put it
 
05:00:52.310 --> 05:00:52.320 align:start position:0%
aside it says they may
 
05:00:56.390 --> 05:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
designate up to 250 000
 
05:00:59.110 --> 05:00:59.120 align:start position:0%
so basically if there turns out to be a
 
05:00:59.120 --> 05:01:00.470 align:start position:0%
so basically if there turns out to be a
need

05:01:00.470 --> 05:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
need
 
05:01:03.030 --> 05:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
it has not been foreseen
 
05:01:05.030 --> 05:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
that option is available it may never
 
05:01:07.510 --> 05:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
get used just like not much of the other
 
05:01:09.990 --> 05:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
250 000 has been used but
 
05:01:12.230 --> 05:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
you can't foresee so it's again it's
 
05:01:14.390 --> 05:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
just enabling
 
05:01:17.430 --> 05:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
it is not actually spending that money
 
05:01:18.788 --> 05:01:18.798 align:start position:0%
but i do
 
05:01:20.628 --> 05:01:20.638 align:start position:0%
like that second part
 
05:01:22.948 --> 05:01:22.958 align:start position:0%
the risk management association i think
 
05:01:24.070 --> 05:01:24.080 align:start position:0%
long term
 
05:01:25.830 --> 05:01:25.840 align:start position:0%
that is the way to go
 
05:01:25.840 --> 05:01:27.030 align:start position:0%
that is the way to go
and

05:01:27.030 --> 05:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:01:29.270 --> 05:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
that will i think eliminate a lot of the
 
05:01:32.230 --> 05:01:32.240 align:start position:0%
problems with funding special needs
 
05:01:34.708 --> 05:01:34.718 align:start position:0%
and so for that reason
 
05:01:34.718 --> 05:01:35.830 align:start position:0%
and so for that reason
i

05:01:35.830 --> 05:01:35.840 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:01:38.230 --> 05:01:38.240 align:start position:0%
decided i would support the past last
 
05:01:38.240 --> 05:01:39.430 align:start position:0%
decided i would support the past last
amendment

05:01:39.430 --> 05:01:39.440 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:01:42.948 --> 05:01:42.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:45.190 --> 05:01:45.200 align:start position:0%
specifically because of that second part
 
05:01:47.190 --> 05:01:47.200 align:start position:0%
that was put in there
 
05:01:50.150 --> 05:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
but yeah as far as the first part
 
05:01:55.670 --> 05:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:58.390 --> 05:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
okay further discussion on
 
05:02:01.190 --> 05:02:01.200 align:start position:0%

okay is do we have everybody everybody

let's go down through the parks here and
 
05:22:06.150 --> 05:22:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:09.110 --> 05:22:09.120 align:start position:0%

05:22:18.550 --> 05:22:18.560 align:start position:0%
i don't see any hands so
 
05:22:21.270 --> 05:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
we're done with part one
 
05:22:25.910 --> 05:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:27.030 --> 05:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:22:29.430 --> 05:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chair i i don't i
 
05:22:31.910 --> 05:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
don't have an amendment on part one but
 
05:22:34.550 --> 05:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
i do have a question i i when we had the
 
05:22:35.830 --> 05:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
discussion with the people from the
 
05:22:37.430 --> 05:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
department of ed i asked a question
 
05:22:37.440 --> 05:22:38.310 align:start position:0%
department of ed i asked a question
about

05:22:38.310 --> 05:22:38.320 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:22:40.070 --> 05:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
one of the parts that was being repealed
 
05:22:42.708 --> 05:22:42.718 align:start position:0%
in part one and from what they sent over
 
05:22:44.948 --> 05:22:44.958 align:start position:0%
i can't seem to make get an answer from
 
05:22:47.430 --> 05:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
that so i'm not quite sure
 
05:22:49.510 --> 05:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
where i should bring that up
 
05:22:51.830 --> 05:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
do you have the letter that came in from
 
05:22:51.840 --> 05:22:52.788 align:start position:0%
do you have the letter that came in from
lisa

05:22:52.788 --> 05:22:52.798 align:start position:0%
lisa
 
05:22:54.628 --> 05:22:54.638 align:start position:0%
yes i do
 
05:22:57.670 --> 05:22:57.680 align:start position:0%
it has the underlying areas within it
 
05:22:58.948 --> 05:22:58.958 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
05:23:01.190 --> 05:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
okay so that doesn't help you out
 
05:23:05.510 --> 05:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh it doesn't appear to no okay
 
05:23:07.750 --> 05:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
can you before we go much farther then
 
05:23:07.760 --> 05:23:08.788 align:start position:0%
can you before we go much farther then
let's

05:23:08.788 --> 05:23:08.798 align:start position:0%
let's
 
05:23:11.670 --> 05:23:11.680 align:start position:0%
what's what's your concern are
 
05:23:16.230 --> 05:23:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:19.500 --> 05:23:19.510 align:start position:0%

05:23:23.990 --> 05:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
column 13 relative to insufficient funds
 
05:23:26.708 --> 05:23:26.718 align:start position:0%
and my question was
 
05:23:29.030 --> 05:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
i i would like some context because it
 
05:23:31.670 --> 05:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
appears that this bill is repealing
 
05:23:34.230 --> 05:23:34.240 align:start position:0%
that particular part uh
 
05:23:34.240 --> 05:23:35.590 align:start position:0%
that particular part uh
and

05:23:35.590 --> 05:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:23:37.830 --> 05:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
i want to know what impact repealing
 
05:23:41.190 --> 05:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
that particular part would have
 
05:23:43.590 --> 05:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
the letter from lisa talks about
 
05:23:46.150 --> 05:23:46.160 align:start position:0%
two major
 
05:23:48.628 --> 05:23:48.638 align:start position:0%
programs being affected the other nine
 
05:23:48.638 --> 05:23:49.510 align:start position:0%
programs being affected the other nine
or

05:23:49.510 --> 05:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:23:50.708 --> 05:23:50.718 align:start position:0%
the other
 
05:23:52.708 --> 05:23:52.718 align:start position:0%
statutory provisions are being repealed
 
05:23:54.390 --> 05:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
so i have the same question they started
 
05:23:56.708 --> 05:23:56.718 align:start position:0%
with what is the impact of repealing
 
05:23:59.030 --> 05:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
the section related to relative to
 
05:24:01.430 --> 05:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
insufficient funds okay
 
05:24:04.390 --> 05:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
i hear you uh lisa is there in our
 
05:24:06.070 --> 05:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
attendee list
 
05:24:07.510 --> 05:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
maybe we could bring her up from the
 
05:24:07.520 --> 05:24:10.708 align:start position:0%
maybe we could bring her up from the
department

05:24:10.708 --> 05:24:10.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:10.718 --> 05:24:12.550 align:start position:0%

05:24:30.230 --> 05:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
query
 
05:24:33.670 --> 05:24:33.680 align:start position:0%
i did um i did uh representative ellison
 
05:24:33.680 --> 05:24:34.788 align:start position:0%
i did um i did uh representative ellison
and

05:24:34.788 --> 05:24:34.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:24:37.110 --> 05:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
what what i could surmise from all of
 
05:24:38.948 --> 05:24:38.958 align:start position:0%
the research that i have done on this
 
05:24:42.868 --> 05:24:42.878 align:start position:0%
this week is that this entire program um
 
05:24:46.470 --> 05:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
which includes um 200 c9
 
05:24:51.910 --> 05:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
through uh 200 c14 or c15 rather
 
05:24:54.470 --> 05:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
is for the workers personal care
 
05:24:56.310 --> 05:24:56.320 align:start position:0%
assistance program
 
05:24:58.868 --> 05:24:58.878 align:start position:0%
and what we could surmise with the
 
05:25:01.750 --> 05:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
research we did was that this program
 
05:25:03.510 --> 05:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
was moved
 
05:25:07.190 --> 05:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
between 1986 and 1994
 
05:25:09.590 --> 05:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
to hhs
 
05:25:12.070 --> 05:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
but it was only moved
 
05:25:14.550 --> 05:25:14.560 align:start position:0%
to utilize personal care attendant
 
05:25:16.628 --> 05:25:16.638 align:start position:0%
services during
 
05:25:19.030 --> 05:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
at home in-home services
 
05:25:20.470 --> 05:25:20.480 align:start position:0%
not at work
 
05:25:20.480 --> 05:25:24.150 align:start position:0%
not at work
and

05:25:24.150 --> 05:25:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:26.470 --> 05:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
so there's been no funding for this
 
05:25:29.510 --> 05:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
program from either a federal or a state
 
05:25:32.390 --> 05:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh entity that we could surmise for all
 
05:25:33.910 --> 05:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
these years
 
05:25:35.270 --> 05:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
this is
 
05:25:37.350 --> 05:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
what i would say as well as this is a
 
05:25:40.310 --> 05:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
natural service that would be included
 
05:25:42.708 --> 05:25:42.718 align:start position:0%
on a vocational rehabilitation
 
05:25:45.270 --> 05:25:45.280 align:start position:0%
individual plan for employment so if an
 
05:25:45.280 --> 05:25:46.470 align:start position:0%
individual plan for employment so if an
individual

05:25:46.470 --> 05:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
individual
 
05:25:48.948 --> 05:25:48.958 align:start position:0%
wanted to go to work they needed a pca a
 
05:25:53.350 --> 05:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
personal care attendant to go to work
 
05:25:55.590 --> 05:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
we could absolutely add that in as a
 
05:25:58.948 --> 05:25:58.958 align:start position:0%
service on their plan for employment and
 
05:25:58.958 --> 05:26:00.550 align:start position:0%
service on their plan for employment and
so

05:26:00.550 --> 05:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:26:04.390 --> 05:26:04.400 align:start position:0%
you know we have a service
 
05:26:07.190 --> 05:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
mechanism for providing this service
 
05:26:09.750 --> 05:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
there is no additional you know
 
05:26:12.830 --> 05:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
federal funding or state funding
 
05:26:16.470 --> 05:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
for to provide personal care attendance
 
05:26:17.990 --> 05:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
at work
 
05:26:20.708 --> 05:26:20.718 align:start position:0%
so in other words medicaid will not pay
 
05:26:24.310 --> 05:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
for a pca at work they will only pay for
 
05:26:26.550 --> 05:26:26.560 align:start position:0%
it at home
 
05:26:29.430 --> 05:26:29.440 align:start position:0%
so what we could uh what we could glean
 
05:26:32.310 --> 05:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
from this is that you know
 
05:26:34.628 --> 05:26:34.638 align:start position:0%
you know back in the 80s this was a
 
05:26:37.910 --> 05:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
program um i did talk to one of my staff
 
05:26:40.150 --> 05:26:40.160 align:start position:0%
uh that was around ella mcallister
 
05:26:42.708 --> 05:26:42.718 align:start position:0%
during that time and she indicated she
 
05:26:45.110 --> 05:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
did remember a couple folks
 
05:26:47.590 --> 05:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
utilizing um this provision but when
 
05:26:50.070 --> 05:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
they went away it's sort of like you
 
05:26:51.190 --> 05:26:51.200 align:start position:0%
know there
 
05:26:53.190 --> 05:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
there was no there was no real need for
 
05:26:56.390 --> 05:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
it and then as the vr program has
 
05:26:56.400 --> 05:26:57.830 align:start position:0%
it and then as the vr program has
evolved

05:26:57.830 --> 05:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
evolved
 
05:26:57.840 --> 05:26:58.948 align:start position:0%
evolved
um

05:26:58.948 --> 05:26:58.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:27:00.788 --> 05:27:00.798 align:start position:0%
we didn't we didn't need a specific
 
05:27:00.798 --> 05:27:02.230 align:start position:0%
we didn't we didn't need a specific
legislative

05:27:02.230 --> 05:27:02.240 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
05:27:04.628 --> 05:27:04.638 align:start position:0%
program to do this work we can do it in
 
05:27:07.030 --> 05:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
our normal business practices
 
05:27:12.550 --> 05:27:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:12.560 --> 05:27:13.910 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:27:13.910 --> 05:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:27:16.070 --> 05:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
05:27:18.788 --> 05:27:18.798 align:start position:0%
i i have not seen the letter and i so
 
05:27:20.788 --> 05:27:20.798 align:start position:0%
and i wasn't expecting to be back today
 
05:27:23.670 --> 05:27:23.680 align:start position:0%
so or i would have pursued it further um
 
05:27:26.948 --> 05:27:26.958 align:start position:0%
lisa can you tell me then what about um
 
05:27:30.788 --> 05:27:30.798 align:start position:0%
the first number one rsa 200 c7 that has
 
05:27:33.590 --> 05:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
to do with the deaf telecommunication
 
05:27:35.510 --> 05:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
equipment can you give me an answer to
 
05:27:39.430 --> 05:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
my concern about that yeah so um this is
 
05:27:42.548 --> 05:27:42.558 align:start position:0%
uh so this is a program that was
 
05:27:44.868 --> 05:27:44.878 align:start position:0%
transferred to uh the governor's
 
05:27:46.788 --> 05:27:46.798 align:start position:0%
commission on disability
 
05:27:49.190 --> 05:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
from the vr program and again
 
05:27:52.150 --> 05:27:52.160 align:start position:0%
unfortunately there was no
 
05:27:54.470 --> 05:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
legislative history on sort of when that
 
05:27:54.480 --> 05:27:55.670 align:start position:0%
legislative history on sort of when that
happened

05:27:55.670 --> 05:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
happened
 
05:27:57.750 --> 05:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
so this is a program that is fully
 
05:27:57.760 --> 05:27:59.030 align:start position:0%
so this is a program that is fully
functioning

05:27:59.030 --> 05:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
functioning
 
05:28:01.510 --> 05:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
it's a program that is actually derived
 
05:28:03.990 --> 05:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
from the public utilities commission
 
05:28:05.990 --> 05:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
and the public public utilities
 
05:28:09.030 --> 05:28:09.040 align:start position:0%
commission has in their statute that
 
05:28:11.670 --> 05:28:11.680 align:start position:0%
this program is administered by the
 
05:28:14.070 --> 05:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
governor's commission on disability
 
05:28:15.910 --> 05:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
the governor's commission on disability
 
05:28:19.110 --> 05:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
has administrative rules
 
05:28:21.510 --> 05:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
for administering the program
 
05:28:23.590 --> 05:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
05:28:25.470 --> 05:28:25.480 align:start position:0%
all of these um all the
 
05:28:28.390 --> 05:28:28.400 align:start position:0%
telecommunications equipment programs
 
05:28:30.390 --> 05:28:30.400 align:start position:0%
um now are uh
 
05:28:33.030 --> 05:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
actually served by the future insight
 
05:28:36.628 --> 05:28:36.638 align:start position:0%
administered there so so unfortunately
 
05:28:39.190 --> 05:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
when the program was moved we didn't do
 
05:28:42.788 --> 05:28:42.798 align:start position:0%
any repeal of our statute
 
05:28:46.070 --> 05:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
in that process so i hope that helps
 
05:28:47.750 --> 05:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
yes it does and i was just wondering if
 
05:28:49.670 --> 05:28:49.680 align:start position:0%
you were able to contact or if the
 
05:28:52.230 --> 05:28:52.240 align:start position:0%
commission on deafness and um hearing
 
05:28:54.390 --> 05:28:54.400 align:start position:0%
loss had made any contact
 
05:28:56.548 --> 05:28:56.558 align:start position:0%
at all about this
 
05:28:59.270 --> 05:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
uh no but i did uh have a conversation
 
05:29:02.230 --> 05:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
representative with chuck say just to
 
05:29:04.868 --> 05:29:04.878 align:start position:0%
solidify my understanding
 
05:29:08.470 --> 05:29:08.480 align:start position:0%
of the move um and and ensure that um
 
05:29:10.788 --> 05:29:10.798 align:start position:0%
that i had this correct um what i will
 
05:29:13.030 --> 05:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
also add um i know
 
05:29:15.270 --> 05:29:15.280 align:start position:0%
i had asked chuck say to be to be here
 
05:29:17.430 --> 05:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
and i know he was here this morning but
 
05:29:19.230 --> 05:29:19.240 align:start position:0%
um that program can the
 
05:29:21.510 --> 05:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
telecommunications equipment access
 
05:29:24.070 --> 05:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
program can be utilized by individuals
 
05:29:25.750 --> 05:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
who are deaf and hard of hearing as well
 
05:29:27.750 --> 05:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
as individuals who are blind and
 
05:29:29.830 --> 05:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
visually impaired and have physical
 
05:29:32.868 --> 05:29:32.878 align:start position:0%
disabilities right right yeah okay thank
 
05:29:34.310 --> 05:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
you i thank you for answering my
 
05:29:36.070 --> 05:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
questions i appreciate it makes me
 
05:29:38.310 --> 05:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
reassured no problem
 
05:29:40.310 --> 05:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
lisa does that uh funding for that
 
05:29:43.990 --> 05:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
program come from medicaid schools
 
05:29:46.868 --> 05:29:46.878 align:start position:0%
uh for the telecommunications program
 
05:29:50.948 --> 05:29:50.958 align:start position:0%
that for the uh 200 home seven that the
 
05:29:53.670 --> 05:29:53.680 align:start position:0%
communications equipment
 
05:29:53.680 --> 05:29:54.868 align:start position:0%
communications equipment
um

05:29:54.868 --> 05:29:54.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:29:57.750 --> 05:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
no um that so
 
05:30:01.670 --> 05:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:04.708 --> 05:30:04.718 align:start position:0%
again that's a program that com
 
05:30:07.510 --> 05:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
the funding comes from puc
 
05:30:09.430 --> 05:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
so it's it's a from what i understand
 
05:30:12.788 --> 05:30:12.798 align:start position:0%
it's a federal it's a federal program
 
05:30:13.760 --> 05:30:13.770 align:start position:0%
that um
 
05:30:13.770 --> 05:30:15.670 align:start position:0%
that um
[Music]

05:30:15.670 --> 05:30:15.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:30:17.510 --> 05:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
that is provided for folks to have
 
05:30:17.520 --> 05:30:18.948 align:start position:0%
that is provided for folks to have
access

05:30:18.948 --> 05:30:18.958 align:start position:0%
access
 
05:30:21.350 --> 05:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
so if you have a classroom that needs
 
05:30:23.030 --> 05:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
that equipment within
 
05:30:26.628 --> 05:30:26.638 align:start position:0%
for a disabled student child
 
05:30:28.390 --> 05:30:28.400 align:start position:0%
does the school make the requests
 
05:30:30.390 --> 05:30:30.400 align:start position:0%
through the department or and does it
 
05:30:32.310 --> 05:30:32.320 align:start position:0%
come from from the department or does it
 
05:30:33.590 --> 05:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
come from
 
05:30:35.510 --> 05:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
some other the governor's commission on
 
05:30:35.520 --> 05:30:36.948 align:start position:0%
some other the governor's commission on
disability

05:30:36.948 --> 05:30:36.958 align:start position:0%
disability
 
05:30:36.958 --> 05:30:37.830 align:start position:0%
disability
um

05:30:37.830 --> 05:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:30:40.150 --> 05:30:40.160 align:start position:0%
i mean we typically don't get a lot of
 
05:30:42.390 --> 05:30:42.400 align:start position:0%
requests from the schools
 
05:30:44.948 --> 05:30:44.958 align:start position:0%
uh the the schools i mean they
 
05:30:46.230 --> 05:30:46.240 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
05:30:47.990 --> 05:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
i mean i could get sort of i could get
 
05:30:50.230 --> 05:30:50.240 align:start position:0%
an understanding of the requests that
 
05:30:52.548 --> 05:30:52.558 align:start position:0%
come into them but i'd have to reach out
 
05:30:54.470 --> 05:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
to future insight
 
05:30:56.868 --> 05:30:56.878 align:start position:0%
to determine you know how the schools do
 
05:30:56.878 --> 05:30:58.868 align:start position:0%
to determine you know how the schools do
that

05:30:58.868 --> 05:30:58.878 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:31:00.548 --> 05:31:00.558 align:start position:0%
i apologize that i don't know that off
 
05:31:02.150 --> 05:31:02.160 align:start position:0%
the top of my head
 
05:31:04.390 --> 05:31:04.400 align:start position:0%
well you know it's you know i guess part
 
05:31:05.830 --> 05:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
one of this bill has been more
 
05:31:08.230 --> 05:31:08.240 align:start position:0%
perplexing to me than any other thing
 
05:31:10.470 --> 05:31:10.480 align:start position:0%
we've discussed today in terms of
 
05:31:12.868 --> 05:31:12.878 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out what's going on
 
05:31:12.878 --> 05:31:13.830 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out what's going on
um

05:31:13.830 --> 05:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:31:15.910 --> 05:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
so i guess i'm gonna just take your word
 
05:31:19.030 --> 05:31:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:20.868 --> 05:31:20.878 align:start position:0%
yeah i i mean i guess
 
05:31:22.708 --> 05:31:22.718 align:start position:0%
the only thing i can say representative
 
05:31:22.718 --> 05:31:23.430 align:start position:0%
the only thing i can say representative
is

05:31:23.430 --> 05:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:31:23.440 --> 05:31:24.390 align:start position:0%
is
um

05:31:24.390 --> 05:31:24.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:31:26.590 --> 05:31:26.600 align:start position:0%
i i feel very strongly that the
 
05:31:28.788 --> 05:31:28.798 align:start position:0%
telecommunication needs of individuals
 
05:31:30.390 --> 05:31:30.400 align:start position:0%
with disabilities
 
05:31:32.230 --> 05:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
um are well
 
05:31:32.240 --> 05:31:34.310 align:start position:0%
um are well
addressed

05:31:34.310 --> 05:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
05:31:36.470 --> 05:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh
 
05:31:38.390 --> 05:31:38.400 align:start position:0%
in terms of employment i mean we can
 
05:31:41.030 --> 05:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
help people with anything they need um
 
05:31:43.430 --> 05:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
and if it is something for their home
 
05:31:44.548 --> 05:31:44.558 align:start position:0%
that's really where that
 
05:31:46.470 --> 05:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
telecommunications equipment program
 
05:31:48.390 --> 05:31:48.400 align:start position:0%
comes in
 
05:31:51.110 --> 05:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
um and as well with the work with the
 
05:31:53.990 --> 05:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
workers personal care assistance program
 
05:31:57.670 --> 05:31:57.680 align:start position:0%
um we can provide those services
 
05:32:00.708 --> 05:32:00.718 align:start position:0%
on a plan for employment and so in other
 
05:32:02.390 --> 05:32:02.400 align:start position:0%
words there's really there's no need for
 
05:32:04.070 --> 05:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
a legislative
 
05:32:06.470 --> 05:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
statute to do that because it's in our
 
05:32:08.070 --> 05:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
normal business
 
05:32:09.910 --> 05:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
now i i understand that i can remember
 
05:32:12.708 --> 05:32:12.718 align:start position:0%
discussing this years ago when we had
 
05:32:14.470 --> 05:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
the the equipment had to remain in the
 
05:32:17.430 --> 05:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
home but the school also needed it yeah
 
05:32:20.150 --> 05:32:20.160 align:start position:0%
and is medicaid paying for both sets of
 
05:32:22.150 --> 05:32:22.160 align:start position:0%
equipment or uh
 
05:32:24.230 --> 05:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
is there another budget that we're
 
05:32:26.390 --> 05:32:26.400 align:start position:0%
having to take that money out of to pay
 
05:32:27.750 --> 05:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
for the stuff in the schools that's
 
05:32:30.868 --> 05:32:30.878 align:start position:0%
always been my question yeah
 
05:32:33.270 --> 05:32:33.280 align:start position:0%
yeah and um i could i could send a note
 
05:32:36.230 --> 05:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
to one of my colleagues in special ed um
 
05:32:38.548 --> 05:32:38.558 align:start position:0%
and and ask them um while you guys are
 
05:32:38.558 --> 05:32:40.470 align:start position:0%
and and ask them um while you guys are
continuing

05:32:40.470 --> 05:32:40.480 align:start position:0%
continuing
 
05:32:42.788 --> 05:32:42.798 align:start position:0%
that that'd be fine okay
 
05:32:48.628 --> 05:32:48.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:48.638 --> 05:32:49.430 align:start position:0%
 
uh

05:32:49.430 --> 05:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:32:51.910 --> 05:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
yes thank you one last follow-up on on
 
05:32:54.868 --> 05:32:54.878 align:start position:0%
this section 200 c13
 
05:32:57.430 --> 05:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
uh if it's not repealed
 
05:32:59.670 --> 05:32:59.680 align:start position:0%
then on this question to lisa
 
05:33:01.830 --> 05:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
what is the impact if this is not
 
05:33:05.430 --> 05:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
repealed and it stays in legislation
 
05:33:05.440 --> 05:33:06.310 align:start position:0%
repealed and it stays in legislation
um

05:33:06.310 --> 05:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:33:09.590 --> 05:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
if it wasn't repealed
 
05:33:12.708 --> 05:33:12.718 align:start position:0%
you know we would have to develop rules
 
05:33:14.788 --> 05:33:14.798 align:start position:0%
for this program because they don't
 
05:33:16.788 --> 05:33:16.798 align:start position:0%
currently exist in our rules and our
 
05:33:18.628 --> 05:33:18.638 align:start position:0%
administrative rules
 
05:33:18.638 --> 05:33:20.390 align:start position:0%
administrative rules
um

05:33:20.390 --> 05:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:33:20.400 --> 05:33:22.230 align:start position:0%
um
and

05:33:22.230 --> 05:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:33:25.110 --> 05:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
you know we would we would utilize our
 
05:33:26.948 --> 05:33:26.958 align:start position:0%
vocational rehabilitation grant to
 
05:33:29.510 --> 05:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
provide any services that anyone asked
 
05:33:29.520 --> 05:33:31.350 align:start position:0%
provide any services that anyone asked
for

05:33:31.350 --> 05:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:33:33.030 --> 05:33:33.040 align:start position:0%
um so
 
05:33:38.628 --> 05:33:38.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:40.230 --> 05:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
you know we would do whatever we had to
 
05:33:47.190 --> 05:33:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:48.548 --> 05:33:48.558 align:start position:0%
i think it's
 
05:33:50.788 --> 05:33:50.798 align:start position:0%
programmatically easier if it if it is
 
05:33:52.788 --> 05:33:52.798 align:start position:0%
repealed because we do this in normal
 
05:33:56.788 --> 05:33:56.798 align:start position:0%
business as it stands

we're finished with part one it was nick
 
05:34:17.750 --> 05:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
we don't have any amending language for
 
05:34:19.750 --> 05:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
that we're leaving the way it is
 
05:34:21.590 --> 05:34:21.600 align:start position:0%

uh relative to career and technical
 
05:34:23.360 --> 05:34:26.470 align:start position:0%

education

05:34:26.470 --> 05:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:31.190 --> 05:34:31.200 align:start position:0%

05:35:04.548 --> 05:35:04.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:06.868 --> 05:35:06.878 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
05:35:09.030 --> 05:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
i've i have reviewed this amendment
 
05:35:12.628 --> 05:35:12.638 align:start position:0%
before with uh our our committee
 
05:35:14.628 --> 05:35:14.638 align:start position:0%
and i i think folks should be pretty
 
05:35:16.948 --> 05:35:16.958 align:start position:0%
much familiar with what we're doing here
 
05:35:18.628 --> 05:35:18.638 align:start position:0%
if we're dealing with
 
05:35:22.310 --> 05:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh the expansion replacement of
 
05:35:25.190 --> 05:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
facilities etc but that that's the way
 
05:35:28.150 --> 05:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
the bill came forward to us
 
05:35:30.548 --> 05:35:30.558 align:start position:0%
we've added on the base of the first
 
05:35:32.390 --> 05:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
page of part two
 
05:35:34.150 --> 05:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
new hampshire students are encouraged to
 
05:35:36.070 --> 05:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
access career and technical education to
 
05:35:38.470 --> 05:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
learn and apply technical academic
 
05:35:42.230 --> 05:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
employability skills needed for career
 
05:35:43.590 --> 05:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
prayer and life
 
05:35:43.600 --> 05:35:44.868 align:start position:0%
prayer and life
um

05:35:44.868 --> 05:35:44.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:35:47.030 --> 05:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
and going on down the transportation is
 
05:35:49.030 --> 05:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
really the big big thing we're trying to
 
05:35:51.270 --> 05:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
do within this
 
05:35:53.430 --> 05:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
we recognize the transportation's not
 
05:35:55.030 --> 05:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
fully funded
 
05:35:57.110 --> 05:35:57.120 align:start position:0%
i've given you the figures before we
 
05:35:58.868 --> 05:35:58.878 align:start position:0%
allocate 9 million bucks total for
 
05:36:00.708 --> 05:36:00.718 align:start position:0%
transportation and tuition
 
05:36:02.548 --> 05:36:02.558 align:start position:0%
of which back in the year that we got
 
05:36:04.310 --> 05:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
this data
 
05:36:07.430 --> 05:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
approximately 680 thousand dollars was
 
05:36:09.990 --> 05:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
paid in for transportation to the school
 
05:36:13.030 --> 05:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
districts the actual cost was closer to
 
05:36:17.510 --> 05:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
2.6 million dollars and so this was uh
 
05:36:19.190 --> 05:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
certainly a cost which we're handing
 
05:36:22.150 --> 05:36:22.160 align:start position:0%
down to the cte for cte
 
05:36:22.160 --> 05:36:23.430 align:start position:0%
down to the cte for cte
attendance

05:36:23.430 --> 05:36:23.440 align:start position:0%
attendance
 
05:36:26.788 --> 05:36:26.798 align:start position:0%
and uh working with um
 
05:36:28.628 --> 05:36:28.638 align:start position:0%
with folks on the other side of the wall
 
05:36:30.390 --> 05:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
in the senate
 
05:36:32.628 --> 05:36:32.638 align:start position:0%
we've added in subject to availability
 
05:36:34.310 --> 05:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
of funding
 
05:36:34.320 --> 05:36:35.190 align:start position:0%
of funding
and

05:36:35.190 --> 05:36:35.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:36:37.510 --> 05:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
the i guess the
 
05:36:39.510 --> 05:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
biggest part of this bill
 
05:36:43.350 --> 05:36:43.360 align:start position:0%
is to me at least is on line six on page
 
05:36:46.230 --> 05:36:46.240 align:start position:0%
two where the students resident district
 
05:36:48.070 --> 05:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
shall be responsible for providing
 
05:36:50.788 --> 05:36:50.798 align:start position:0%
transportation not the sending district
 
05:36:53.510 --> 05:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
so this makes provides eligibility to
 
05:36:55.190 --> 05:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
the three districts that no longer
 
05:36:57.590 --> 05:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
receive that have not received any
 
05:36:59.270 --> 05:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
transportation funding
 
05:37:02.628 --> 05:37:02.638 align:start position:0%
exeter nashua and manchester
 
05:37:04.708 --> 05:37:04.718 align:start position:0%
it further goes down and says if a
 
05:37:07.910 --> 05:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
student is permitted to self-transport
 
05:37:09.750 --> 05:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
the students resident district shall
 
05:37:11.350 --> 05:37:11.360 align:start position:0%
reimburse the student in accordance with
 
05:37:15.750 --> 05:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
rules adopted pursuant to rsa 541a
 
05:37:18.628 --> 05:37:18.638 align:start position:0%
that is in our rules right now and we we
 
05:37:21.830 --> 05:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
reimburse i believe it's at 25 cents per
 
05:37:21.840 --> 05:37:23.270 align:start position:0%
reimburse i believe it's at 25 cents per
mile

05:37:23.270 --> 05:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
mile
 
05:37:25.590 --> 05:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
the the school districts for bus
 
05:37:27.910 --> 05:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
transportation i get reimbursed 10 cents
 
05:37:29.910 --> 05:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
a mile
 
05:37:29.920 --> 05:37:30.868 align:start position:0%
a mile
the

05:37:30.868 --> 05:37:30.878 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:37:33.750 --> 05:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
this is for those few students that may
 
05:37:37.350 --> 05:37:37.360 align:start position:0%
drive themselves to the cte center
 
05:37:39.910 --> 05:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
it may be cheaper to provide one car to
 
05:37:39.920 --> 05:37:40.708 align:start position:0%
it may be cheaper to provide one car to
go

05:37:40.708 --> 05:37:40.718 align:start position:0%
go
 
05:37:43.270 --> 05:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
than uh one big bus
 
05:37:45.830 --> 05:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
and in some cte centers the kids stay
 
05:37:48.548 --> 05:37:48.558 align:start position:0%
after school close is to work
 
05:37:50.708 --> 05:37:50.718 align:start position:0%
in an apprenticeship or an internship
 
05:37:52.470 --> 05:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
right there in the community the ct is
 
05:37:55.350 --> 05:37:55.360 align:start position:0%
located in so they come home later at a
 
05:37:57.030 --> 05:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
later hour then the bus will pick them
 
05:37:57.040 --> 05:37:57.750 align:start position:0%
later hour then the bus will pick them
up

05:37:57.750 --> 05:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
up
 
05:37:59.510 --> 05:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
that has to be approved by the local
 
05:38:02.628 --> 05:38:02.638 align:start position:0%
school district the high school
 
05:38:06.548 --> 05:38:06.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:09.990 --> 05:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
much of that came to us uh on pages two
 
05:38:11.670 --> 05:38:11.680 align:start position:0%
and three from there on
 
05:38:14.230 --> 05:38:14.240 align:start position:0%
um going on page
 
05:38:14.240 --> 05:38:15.430 align:start position:0%
um going on page
four

05:38:15.430 --> 05:38:15.440 align:start position:0%

um
 
05:38:42.948 --> 05:38:42.958 align:start position:0%
uh online uh 23 on page four
 
05:38:45.750 --> 05:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh where we've uh in the past when we're
 
05:38:47.670 --> 05:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
talking about dual and concurrent
 
05:38:50.230 --> 05:38:50.240 align:start position:0%
enrollment programs
 
05:38:53.510 --> 05:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
we have provided uh stem courses science
 
05:38:55.830 --> 05:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
technology engineering and math but it's
 
05:38:57.750 --> 05:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
come from the folks on the advisory
 
05:38:57.760 --> 05:38:58.948 align:start position:0%
come from the folks on the advisory
council

05:38:58.948 --> 05:38:58.958 align:start position:0%
council
 
05:39:00.628 --> 05:39:00.638 align:start position:0%
as well as many people in the high
 
05:39:03.270 --> 05:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
schools that communication skills are
 
05:39:05.910 --> 05:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
equally as important as a specific skill
 
05:39:07.910 --> 05:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
so by putting the language in here in
 
05:39:07.920 --> 05:39:08.708 align:start position:0%
so by putting the language in here in
here

05:39:08.708 --> 05:39:08.718 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:39:10.230 --> 05:39:10.240 align:start position:0%
and support doing
 
05:39:12.948 --> 05:39:12.958 align:start position:0%
career technical education courses
 
05:39:15.990 --> 05:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
um and it goes down on line 25
 
05:39:18.948 --> 05:39:18.958 align:start position:0%
then 24-25 that are fundamental and
 
05:39:20.310 --> 05:39:20.320 align:start position:0%
necessary for success in the
 
05:39:22.708 --> 05:39:22.718 align:start position:0%
post-secondary education career path
 
05:39:26.070 --> 05:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity opportunities
 
05:39:27.670 --> 05:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
and to meet new hampshire's emerging
 
05:39:29.830 --> 05:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
workforce needs so they could take the
 
05:39:31.910 --> 05:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
course of communication which has been
 
05:39:33.910 --> 05:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
advocated by the
 
05:39:37.430 --> 05:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
folks at the cte centers and lastly
 
05:39:40.230 --> 05:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
by inserting on line 30
 
05:39:42.390 --> 05:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
grade 10 high schools now
 
05:39:44.310 --> 05:39:44.320 align:start position:0%
allow kids that have been students that
 
05:39:46.948 --> 05:39:46.958 align:start position:0%
are in grades 10 11 and 12 we reduced it
 
05:39:49.350 --> 05:39:49.360 align:start position:0%
from 11 to 12 to 10 11 12
 
05:39:51.670 --> 05:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
to participate in this program now we're
 
05:39:55.270 --> 05:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
providing it also to the cte programs
 
05:39:55.280 --> 05:39:56.150 align:start position:0%
providing it also to the cte programs
um

05:39:56.150 --> 05:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:39:58.070 --> 05:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
i guess that's it for the amendment
 
05:40:00.868 --> 05:40:00.878 align:start position:0%
language and this that's
 
05:40:03.830 --> 05:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
some of it's most of it was here before
 
05:40:06.390 --> 05:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
when we got it you've heard the changes
 
05:40:10.470 --> 05:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:12.470 --> 05:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
05:40:14.390 --> 05:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
yes what about section
 
05:40:19.670 --> 05:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:25.990 --> 05:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:30.310 --> 05:40:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:31.750 --> 05:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm not sure that was in the
 
05:40:34.070 --> 05:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
original bill but
 
05:40:36.150 --> 05:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
if i made it with section 14 in the
 
05:40:39.110 --> 05:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
original bill yeah it's there we did not
 
05:40:40.708 --> 05:40:40.718 align:start position:0%
and that's not part of this amendment
 
05:40:40.718 --> 05:40:52.150 align:start position:0%
and that's not part of this amendment
okay

05:40:52.150 --> 05:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:55.190 --> 05:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
05:40:56.948 --> 05:40:56.958 align:start position:0%
you made the second on that should care
 
05:40:58.628 --> 05:40:58.638 align:start position:0%
to speak to it
 
05:41:00.390 --> 05:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
i think you did a good job pointing out
 
05:41:01.910 --> 05:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
the differences
 
05:41:05.110 --> 05:41:05.120 align:start position:0%
and explaining why they're in there so
 
05:41:07.030 --> 05:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
further discussion on this from some
 
05:41:07.040 --> 05:41:07.910 align:start position:0%
further discussion on this from some
iowa

05:41:07.910 --> 05:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
iowa
 
05:41:10.788 --> 05:41:10.798 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair could you explain
 
05:41:13.030 --> 05:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
to me how you see
 
05:41:15.430 --> 05:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at page one excuse me
 
05:41:18.310 --> 05:41:18.320 align:start position:0%
on line 28 the new language that new
 
05:41:21.030 --> 05:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire students are encouraged
 
05:41:23.430 --> 05:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
to access career and tech edu how do you
 
05:41:25.350 --> 05:41:25.360 align:start position:0%
see that happening
 
05:41:25.360 --> 05:41:26.310 align:start position:0%
see that happening
well

05:41:26.310 --> 05:41:26.320 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:41:28.868 --> 05:41:28.878 align:start position:0%
to go back to work the history on that
 
05:41:31.110 --> 05:41:31.120 align:start position:0%
is it came out of
 
05:41:33.430 --> 05:41:33.440 align:start position:0%
the department and the advisory council
 
05:41:35.350 --> 05:41:35.360 align:start position:0%
that students have the right
 
05:41:36.830 --> 05:41:36.840 align:start position:0%
to cte
 
05:41:40.390 --> 05:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
education um that came under some
 
05:41:42.070 --> 05:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
discussion within the senate and they
 
05:41:45.990 --> 05:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:46.000 --> 05:41:46.788 align:start position:0%
 
and

05:41:46.788 --> 05:41:46.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:41:51.030 --> 05:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
as i was told by senator uh
 
05:41:54.230 --> 05:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
waters um so what we're trying to do
 
05:41:57.590 --> 05:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
there is we're trying to beef up the
 
05:41:59.030 --> 05:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
number of kids
 
05:42:02.628 --> 05:42:02.638 align:start position:0%
that are going to the cte centers uh
 
05:42:04.948 --> 05:42:04.958 align:start position:0%
due to the transportation issues we have
 
05:42:06.548 --> 05:42:06.558 align:start position:0%
really limited the number of students in
 
05:42:08.470 --> 05:42:08.480 align:start position:0%
fact some districts are allocating we
 
05:42:09.830 --> 05:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
got 10 seats
 
05:42:12.310 --> 05:42:12.320 align:start position:0%
and the 14 kids want to go four of them
 
05:42:12.320 --> 05:42:13.030 align:start position:0%
and the 14 kids want to go four of them
are

05:42:13.030 --> 05:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:42:15.910 --> 05:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
are not going uh what we're trying to do
 
05:42:18.628 --> 05:42:18.638 align:start position:0%
is we had a sheet that was handed to us
 
05:42:21.110 --> 05:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
oh months ago months ago when we were
 
05:42:24.548 --> 05:42:24.558 align:start position:0%
discussing tuition and transportation i
 
05:42:27.510 --> 05:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh compared it to the state of delaware
 
05:42:29.910 --> 05:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
where their percentage in attendance was
 
05:42:32.310 --> 05:42:32.320 align:start position:0%
much much higher than ours here
 
05:42:33.830 --> 05:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
and they have approximately the same
 
05:42:35.190 --> 05:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
number of students
 
05:42:36.788 --> 05:42:36.798 align:start position:0%
and and of course the whole funding
 
05:42:39.030 --> 05:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
system is much different as well
 
05:42:41.510 --> 05:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
but uh we need to if we're going to
 
05:42:44.628 --> 05:42:44.638 align:start position:0%
provide skills or the workforce numbers
 
05:42:46.390 --> 05:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
that we are required to provide to
 
05:42:49.190 --> 05:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
support our manufacturers and industry
 
05:42:51.030 --> 05:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
and various businesses
 
05:42:52.948 --> 05:42:52.958 align:start position:0%
we need to encourage and we're hoping
 
05:42:54.868 --> 05:42:54.878 align:start position:0%
that the counselors and schools will
 
05:42:57.030 --> 05:42:57.040 align:start position:0%
recognize that fact and i think they're
 
05:42:58.708 --> 05:42:58.718 align:start position:0%
doing a good job since we've had
 
05:42:58.718 --> 05:42:59.830 align:start position:0%
doing a good job since we've had
counselor

05:42:59.830 --> 05:42:59.840 align:start position:0%
counselor
 
05:43:03.030 --> 05:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
counselors on the council one and that's
 
05:43:06.150 --> 05:43:06.160 align:start position:0%
been a real benefit um
 
05:43:08.310 --> 05:43:08.320 align:start position:0%
we can always do better though
 
05:43:10.230 --> 05:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
follow up please um
 
05:43:11.830 --> 05:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
i know that that in some of these
 
05:43:14.628 --> 05:43:14.638 align:start position:0%
schools there there are limits
 
05:43:16.628 --> 05:43:16.638 align:start position:0%
and in some areas there are i have no
 
05:43:18.470 --> 05:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
problem with the language but
 
05:43:21.830 --> 05:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh has the advisory council
 
05:43:23.590 --> 05:43:23.600 align:start position:0%
looked at the issue that if they get
 
05:43:25.590 --> 05:43:25.600 align:start position:0%
expanded students
 
05:43:28.390 --> 05:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
where they have limited sources already
 
05:43:31.110 --> 05:43:31.120 align:start position:0%
and there's a lottery for those students
 
05:43:33.270 --> 05:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
to attend have they talked about
 
05:43:33.280 --> 05:43:34.070 align:start position:0%
to attend have they talked about
how

05:43:34.070 --> 05:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
how
 
05:43:38.310 --> 05:43:38.320 align:start position:0%
the actual cte center is going to expand
 
05:43:40.628 --> 05:43:40.638 align:start position:0%
the options there if in fact there
 
05:43:42.948 --> 05:43:42.958 align:start position:0%
currently are limited options
 
05:43:44.708 --> 05:43:44.718 align:start position:0%
and you've got with this language there
 
05:43:48.070 --> 05:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
may be more students who want to attend
 
05:43:50.150 --> 05:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
well i i agree we have been limiting our
 
05:43:53.190 --> 05:43:53.200 align:start position:0%
students and unfortunately so uh this is
 
05:43:56.150 --> 05:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
why we're we're trying
 
05:43:58.310 --> 05:43:58.320 align:start position:0%
and it's it comes down to finance that's
 
05:44:01.030 --> 05:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
where it goes now uh it's going to come
 
05:44:03.350 --> 05:44:03.360 align:start position:0%
down as a financial issue that we
 
05:44:05.750 --> 05:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
provide the money and just as we do
 
05:44:07.750 --> 05:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes in special education with the
 
05:44:10.310 --> 05:44:10.320 align:start position:0%
old cad aide now speciality we allocate
 
05:44:12.070 --> 05:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
x number of dollars be at 30 million or
 
05:44:14.708 --> 05:44:14.718 align:start position:0%
where wherever we may be and if we have
 
05:44:16.390 --> 05:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
more students coming in the amount that
 
05:44:18.708 --> 05:44:18.718 align:start position:0%
we reimburse is is of course shrunk
 
05:44:19.990 --> 05:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
because we have to spread it amongst
 
05:44:22.150 --> 05:44:22.160 align:start position:0%
more kids the same thing's happening in
 
05:44:24.310 --> 05:44:24.320 align:start position:0%
cte programs when we allocate this nine
 
05:44:28.150 --> 05:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
million dollars each year so uh then
 
05:44:29.990 --> 05:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
we're in and uh
 
05:44:31.910 --> 05:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
that's going to there's eventually going
 
05:44:34.310 --> 05:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
to be an issue here and uh
 
05:44:37.190 --> 05:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
we need to bring this to the forefront
 
05:44:39.030 --> 05:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
in terms of how we are funding and how
 
05:44:40.548 --> 05:44:40.558 align:start position:0%
we are supporting career technical
 
05:44:43.270 --> 05:44:43.280 align:start position:0%
education that's why we had that uh i
 
05:44:45.030 --> 05:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
can't remember the bill number two
 
05:44:46.708 --> 05:44:46.718 align:start position:0%
because i think one of the first bills
 
05:44:49.270 --> 05:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
was signed by the governor to set up the
 
05:44:51.830 --> 05:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
commission or the committee for looking
 
05:44:54.230 --> 05:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
at tuition and transportation which we
 
05:44:56.868 --> 05:44:56.878 align:start position:0%
need to get going um
 
05:44:56.878 --> 05:44:58.150 align:start position:0%
need to get going um
so

05:44:58.150 --> 05:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:45:00.230 --> 05:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
i understand the question uh i
 
05:45:01.750 --> 05:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
understand though that we have to
 
05:45:03.430 --> 05:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
resolve several things first i think
 
05:45:05.270 --> 05:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
we've got to resolve the issue of nashua
 
05:45:07.590 --> 05:45:07.600 align:start position:0%
exeter and manchester
 
05:45:09.510 --> 05:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
and get them on the boards as far as
 
05:45:12.070 --> 05:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
receiving transportation monies then
 
05:45:13.670 --> 05:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a question and of
 
05:45:15.430 --> 05:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
course this is why
 
05:45:17.590 --> 05:45:17.600 align:start position:0%
legislation such as this has been turned
 
05:45:19.110 --> 05:45:19.120 align:start position:0%
down in the past
 
05:45:22.628 --> 05:45:22.638 align:start position:0%
seeing that the transportation
 
05:45:24.708 --> 05:45:24.718 align:start position:0%
comes out of that nine million dollars
 
05:45:27.190 --> 05:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
each year the remainder is used for
 
05:45:27.200 --> 05:45:28.390 align:start position:0%
each year the remainder is used for
tuition

05:45:28.390 --> 05:45:28.400 align:start position:0%
tuition
 
05:45:29.750 --> 05:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
and so if you use more for
 
05:45:31.110 --> 05:45:31.120 align:start position:0%
transportation it's gonna be less
 
05:45:33.030 --> 05:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
tuition reimbursement
 
05:45:36.708 --> 05:45:36.718 align:start position:0%
um what we've got to do is in order to
 
05:45:38.868 --> 05:45:38.878 align:start position:0%
make this work
 
05:45:41.110 --> 05:45:41.120 align:start position:0%
according to the department eric for
 
05:45:42.948 --> 05:45:42.958 align:start position:0%
worth we're probably going to allocate
 
05:45:45.350 --> 05:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
another 2 million each year for cte
 
05:45:45.360 --> 05:45:47.270 align:start position:0%
another 2 million each year for cte
programs

05:45:47.270 --> 05:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
programs
 
05:45:50.708 --> 05:45:50.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:50.718 --> 05:45:52.470 align:start position:0%
 
representatives

05:45:52.470 --> 05:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
05:45:54.948 --> 05:45:54.958 align:start position:0%
yeah in regards to that question that
 
05:45:56.470 --> 05:45:56.480 align:start position:0%
you just had
 
05:45:59.590 --> 05:45:59.600 align:start position:0%
i did talk to the coordinator at auburn
 
05:46:02.230 --> 05:46:02.240 align:start position:0%
cte in hudson
 
05:46:02.240 --> 05:46:03.830 align:start position:0%
cte in hudson
um

05:46:03.830 --> 05:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:46:05.030 --> 05:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
last year
 
05:46:07.430 --> 05:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
and he said that there were programs
 
05:46:09.750 --> 05:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
that were not being utilized
 
05:46:13.110 --> 05:46:13.120 align:start position:0%
and um his biggest suggestion was making
 
05:46:15.830 --> 05:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
sure that all of the guidance counselors
 
05:46:19.110 --> 05:46:19.120 align:start position:0%
understood what all the options were so
 
05:46:21.430 --> 05:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
a way of
 
05:46:24.230 --> 05:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
encouraging access would be to make sure
 
05:46:26.708 --> 05:46:26.718 align:start position:0%
that all of the guidance councils know
 
05:46:29.590 --> 05:46:29.600 align:start position:0%
just what all programs are available and
 
05:46:31.430 --> 05:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
to get it out to their
 
05:46:33.430 --> 05:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
kids and so that was
 
05:46:37.270 --> 05:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:39.110 --> 05:46:39.120 align:start position:0%
we're up against a real mountain in
 
05:46:42.470 --> 05:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
terms of career technical education
 
05:46:44.070 --> 05:46:44.080 align:start position:0%
understanding that tuition in some
 
05:46:45.830 --> 05:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
schools can be as low as three thousand
 
05:46:47.510 --> 05:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
dollars other schools can be up as high
 
05:46:49.670 --> 05:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
as seven thousand dollars per kid
 
05:46:51.270 --> 05:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
interpretation how many hours they have
 
05:46:53.110 --> 05:46:53.120 align:start position:0%
to be at a cte program are different
 
05:46:55.910 --> 05:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
between new hampshire and uh connecticut
 
05:46:57.750 --> 05:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
and and vermont
 
05:47:00.150 --> 05:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
in order to get credit for the course so
 
05:47:02.548 --> 05:47:02.558 align:start position:0%
there's a whole lot of issues which the
 
05:47:04.708 --> 05:47:04.718 align:start position:0%

05:47:05.910 --> 05:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
some uh
 
05:47:08.868 --> 05:47:08.878 align:start position:0%
coordinated uh commonality here between
 
05:47:12.230 --> 05:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
the the programs all all the 20 plus cte
 
05:47:12.240 --> 05:47:13.270 align:start position:0%
the the programs all all the 20 plus cte
incentives

05:47:13.270 --> 05:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
incentives
 
05:47:20.390 --> 05:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:22.788 --> 05:47:22.798 align:start position:0%
uh any further represent porter
 
05:47:24.788 --> 05:47:24.798 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair i noticed that we
 
05:47:26.868 --> 05:47:26.878 align:start position:0%
changed the effective date
 
05:47:29.510 --> 05:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
way down on page number five
 
05:47:34.310 --> 05:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
line 27 from june 2022 to 2026 and i'm
 
05:47:34.320 --> 05:47:36.070 align:start position:0%
line 27 from june 2022 to 2026 and i'm
wondering

05:47:36.070 --> 05:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
05:47:37.750 --> 05:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
just curious why
 
05:47:42.628 --> 05:47:42.638 align:start position:0%
such a big jump it's done by doa
 
05:47:45.830 --> 05:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
and and it's because we're we're looking
 
05:47:45.840 --> 05:47:47.190 align:start position:0%
and and it's because we're we're looking
at

05:47:47.190 --> 05:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
at
 
05:47:50.150 --> 05:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
budget issues with this
 
05:47:52.470 --> 05:47:52.480 align:start position:0%
uh appropriating dollars
 
05:47:54.230 --> 05:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:47:57.190 --> 05:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
we don't expect uh some of these schools
 
05:47:59.430 --> 05:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
really get on board as quickly as they
 
05:47:59.440 --> 05:48:00.230 align:start position:0%
really get on board as quickly as they
are

05:48:00.230 --> 05:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:48:02.548 --> 05:48:02.558 align:start position:0%
great 11 and 12 kids 10th grade kids
 
05:48:04.310 --> 05:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
will come gradually and they'll have to
 
05:48:05.110 --> 05:48:05.120 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to have the
 
05:48:08.390 --> 05:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
prerequisites to get into the dual and
 
05:48:09.830 --> 05:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
concurrent enrollment that's in this
 
05:48:11.510 --> 05:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
program as well
 
05:48:17.270 --> 05:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:19.110 --> 05:48:19.120 align:start position:0%
do we have anybody up from this career
 
05:48:22.788 --> 05:48:22.798 align:start position:0%
technical education here listening
 
05:48:23.840 --> 05:48:23.850 align:start position:0%
i don't think so
 
05:48:23.850 --> 05:48:25.910 align:start position:0%
i don't think so

thank you
 
05:49:48.628 --> 05:49:48.638 align:start position:0%
hey rick with if we've got diana still
 
05:49:49.750 --> 05:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
on the
 
05:49:53.430 --> 05:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead in the meeting thanks um
 
05:49:55.030 --> 05:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
there may be a simple answer to this i'm
 
05:49:57.910 --> 05:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
just not putting it together but down
 
05:50:00.070 --> 05:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
down where um representative porter was
 
05:50:02.948 --> 05:50:02.958 align:start position:0%
talking about the change in effective
 
05:50:05.750 --> 05:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
date section 18
 
05:50:05.760 --> 05:50:07.590 align:start position:0%
date section 18
um

05:50:07.590 --> 05:50:07.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:50:10.628 --> 05:50:10.638 align:start position:0%
and then on line 27 it goes section
 
05:50:13.750 --> 05:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
three of this act actually it says um i
 
05:50:16.070 --> 05:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
think that's a roman
 
05:50:17.750 --> 05:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
i think it's a roman one
 
05:50:19.670 --> 05:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
um section three of this act shall take
 
05:50:22.230 --> 05:50:22.240 align:start position:0%
effect june 30th 2026. what's being
 
05:50:25.350 --> 05:50:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:26.470 --> 05:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
that's that
 
05:50:28.150 --> 05:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
that's on the first page
 
05:50:31.030 --> 05:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
no that's not
 
05:50:32.868 --> 05:50:32.878 align:start position:0%
that's not the same section three that
 
05:50:34.788 --> 05:50:34.798 align:start position:0%
it's referring to i don't think that
 
05:50:40.948 --> 05:50:40.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:43.590 --> 05:50:43.600 align:start position:0%
because they're talking about amending
 
05:50:47.750 --> 05:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
i think 2019 247 colon 4 is the is house
 
05:50:50.548 --> 05:50:50.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:52.708 --> 05:50:52.718 align:start position:0%
i think that's the budget document
 
05:51:00.548 --> 05:51:00.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:02.230 --> 05:51:02.240 align:start position:0%
you know i i don't have an answer for
 
05:51:04.150 --> 05:51:04.160 align:start position:0%
you on that this is you know this has
 
05:51:07.110 --> 05:51:07.120 align:start position:0%
been developed by by them
 
05:51:07.120 --> 05:51:08.948 align:start position:0%
been developed by by them
right

05:51:08.948 --> 05:51:08.958 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:51:11.910 --> 05:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
but but it's being amended by us yeah i
 
05:51:15.190 --> 05:51:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:16.548 --> 05:51:16.558 align:start position:0%
yes basically
 
05:51:17.830 --> 05:51:17.840 align:start position:0%
you see what i'm saying that i don't
 
05:51:19.830 --> 05:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
think it refers to section three on page
 
05:51:22.070 --> 05:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
one is diana
 
05:51:25.990 --> 05:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
still there could she try to find eric
 
05:51:29.030 --> 05:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
i think it refers to section three
 
05:51:31.350 --> 05:51:31.360 align:start position:0%
on page three
 
05:51:36.548 --> 05:51:36.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:38.830 --> 05:51:38.840 align:start position:0%
we do have mr crowe with welcome to
 
05:51:42.868 --> 05:51:42.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:45.750 --> 05:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
hello eric um we're dealing with uh the
 
05:51:48.150 --> 05:51:48.160 align:start position:0%
part of 148 which deals with career
 
05:51:50.470 --> 05:51:50.480 align:start position:0%
technical education part two
 
05:51:53.350 --> 05:51:53.360 align:start position:0%
okay we're looking at the uh repeal
 
05:51:55.030 --> 05:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
dates effective dates
 
05:51:57.750 --> 05:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
and do you understand or know why we're
 
05:52:01.350 --> 05:52:01.360 align:start position:0%
talking about uh repealing once apart at
 
05:52:04.788 --> 05:52:04.798 align:start position:0%
online 24 2026.
 
05:52:08.150 --> 05:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
in section three also references 2026
 
05:52:10.948 --> 05:52:10.958 align:start position:0%
the other i see referencing you know you
 
05:52:17.190 --> 05:52:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:20.708 --> 05:52:20.718 align:start position:0%
so the the line 24
 
05:52:23.590 --> 05:52:23.600 align:start position:0%
is the the the original legislation that
 
05:52:25.750 --> 05:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
senator waters wrote for the tax
 
05:52:29.430 --> 05:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
donations sunsetted in 2022
 
05:52:31.830 --> 05:52:31.840 align:start position:0%
and in this amendment he was asking to
 
05:52:36.230 --> 05:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:39.350 --> 05:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
i got it yes that's what that piece is
 
05:52:39.360 --> 05:52:41.380 align:start position:0%
i got it yes that's what that piece is
um

05:52:41.380 --> 05:52:41.390 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:52:41.390 --> 05:52:45.430 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

05:52:45.430 --> 05:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:48.230 --> 05:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what line 27 refers to
 
05:52:48.240 --> 05:52:57.270 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what line 27 refers to
though

05:52:57.270 --> 05:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:00.788 --> 05:53:00.798 align:start position:0%
so is that just reacting so as
 
05:53:04.310 --> 05:53:04.320 align:start position:0%
oh so so in june 30th 2026 it gets
 
05:53:04.320 --> 05:53:05.910 align:start position:0%
oh so so in june 30th 2026 it gets
repealed

05:53:05.910 --> 05:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
repealed
 
05:53:12.150 --> 05:53:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:14.948 --> 05:53:14.958 align:start position:0%
that what gets repealed
 
05:53:18.470 --> 05:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
the the tax credit allotment
 
05:53:21.670 --> 05:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
so 247 4
 
05:53:23.750 --> 05:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
is part of that
 
05:53:26.788 --> 05:53:26.798 align:start position:0%
the tax credit allotment
 
05:53:29.670 --> 05:53:29.680 align:start position:0%
okay so it's it's related to
 
05:53:33.030 --> 05:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
um to lines 23 and 24 24 i believe so
 
05:53:33.040 --> 05:53:34.150 align:start position:0%
um to lines 23 and 24 24 i believe so
the

05:53:34.150 --> 05:53:34.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:53:35.350 --> 05:53:35.360 align:start position:0%
as i'm not unfortunately i'm not looking
 
05:53:37.190 --> 05:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
at the original but the original law i
 
05:53:41.350 --> 05:53:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:42.708 --> 05:53:42.718 align:start position:0%
there is the repeal law that says
 
05:53:42.718 --> 05:53:44.150 align:start position:0%
there is the repeal law that says
effective

05:53:44.150 --> 05:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
effective
 
05:53:46.788 --> 05:53:46.798 align:start position:0%
june 30th 2022
 
05:53:49.110 --> 05:53:49.120 align:start position:0%
this portion of the cte law will be
 
05:53:50.548 --> 05:53:50.558 align:start position:0%
repealed which is
 
05:53:50.558 --> 05:53:51.910 align:start position:0%
repealed which is
the

05:53:51.910 --> 05:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:53:54.390 --> 05:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
granting tax credit so this was changing
 
05:54:01.670 --> 05:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:03.110 --> 05:54:03.120 align:start position:0%
i think that's how senator waters
 
05:54:04.868 --> 05:54:04.878 align:start position:0%
explained it to me but between now and
 
05:54:08.548 --> 05:54:08.558 align:start position:0%
then and now i had forgotten that
 
05:54:10.390 --> 05:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
sounds like that answers it rick though
 
05:54:18.628 --> 05:54:18.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:21.590 --> 05:54:21.600 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure in 2024
 
05:54:23.190 --> 05:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
we'll come back to you and ask to extend
 
05:54:25.110 --> 05:54:25.120 align:start position:0%
another four years don't worry i'm sure
 
05:54:26.150 --> 05:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
you will
 
05:54:26.160 --> 05:54:27.430 align:start position:0%
you will
um

05:54:27.430 --> 05:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:54:29.030 --> 05:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
one other thing eric there was a
 
05:54:30.708 --> 05:54:30.718 align:start position:0%
question and i i
 
05:54:34.470 --> 05:54:34.480 align:start position:0%
tried to answer that on the first page
 
05:54:36.470 --> 05:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
where we had a new hampshire student are
 
05:54:38.230 --> 05:54:38.240 align:start position:0%
encouraged to access career technical
 
05:54:41.270 --> 05:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
education at one point in time you folks
 
05:54:43.750 --> 05:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
and the council were talking about uh
 
05:54:45.430 --> 05:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire students have a right
 
05:54:45.440 --> 05:54:46.470 align:start position:0%
new hampshire students have a right
right

05:54:46.470 --> 05:54:46.480 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:54:49.030 --> 05:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
and that that was discussed i believe on
 
05:54:51.270 --> 05:54:51.280 align:start position:0%
this in the senate side was decided that
 
05:54:52.948 --> 05:54:52.958 align:start position:0%
to take that whole sentence out is that
 
05:54:52.958 --> 05:54:54.470 align:start position:0%
to take that whole sentence out is that
correct

05:54:54.470 --> 05:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
correct
 
05:54:56.548 --> 05:54:56.558 align:start position:0%
um i believe yeah you had mentioned that
 
05:54:58.788 --> 05:54:58.798 align:start position:0%
to me uh replied that when it when it
 
05:55:00.470 --> 05:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
came to you that line was missing and
 
05:55:02.390 --> 05:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
you knew it had been there originally
 
05:55:04.470 --> 05:55:04.480 align:start position:0%
yeah and i wanted to back in
 
05:55:06.788 --> 05:55:06.798 align:start position:0%
so i put it in there and then i'm sort
 
05:55:09.510 --> 05:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
of like uh told by the senators that
 
05:55:10.708 --> 05:55:10.718 align:start position:0%
have been involved with this thing
 
05:55:12.708 --> 05:55:12.718 align:start position:0%
you've got to be careful with that with
 
05:55:15.670 --> 05:55:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:18.788 --> 05:55:18.798 align:start position:0%
i i if that will be an issue
 
05:55:18.798 --> 05:55:20.470 align:start position:0%
i i if that will be an issue
this

05:55:20.470 --> 05:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:55:23.030 --> 05:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
um and from my end i you know this is
 
05:55:25.430 --> 05:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
certainly a compromise of it's informing
 
05:55:28.150 --> 05:55:28.160 align:start position:0%
students we we'd like you to go
 
05:55:30.708 --> 05:55:30.718 align:start position:0%
um so
 
05:55:32.070 --> 05:55:32.080 align:start position:0%
yeah i think it's important it
 
05:55:34.310 --> 05:55:34.320 align:start position:0%
encourages them to go
 
05:55:35.990 --> 05:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
to school districts to figure out how to
 
05:55:37.990 --> 05:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
do that
 
05:55:41.430 --> 05:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
but i i um i hadn't been aware when they
 
05:55:43.030 --> 05:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
when it was pulled out originally and
 
05:55:44.548 --> 05:55:44.558 align:start position:0%
senator waters never mentioned anything
 
05:55:45.830 --> 05:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
to me so i'm
 
05:55:45.840 --> 05:55:46.628 align:start position:0%
to me so i'm
i'm

05:55:46.628 --> 05:55:46.638 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
05:55:48.390 --> 05:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
now just curious as to what happened on
 
05:55:49.750 --> 05:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
the senate side that they didn't like
 
05:55:52.070 --> 05:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
the word students have a right it's some
 
05:55:53.670 --> 05:55:53.680 align:start position:0%
of the language that initially came when
 
05:55:55.590 --> 05:55:55.600 align:start position:0%
you were working with the council
 
05:55:56.948 --> 05:55:56.958 align:start position:0%
and we were going through all those
 
05:56:00.868 --> 05:56:00.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:00.878 --> 05:56:03.750 align:start position:0%
 
yes

05:56:03.750 --> 05:56:03.760 align:start position:0%

at um
 
06:00:49.070 --> 06:00:49.080 align:start position:0%
at part three um 1586 and
 
06:00:49.080 --> 06:00:50.628 align:start position:0%
at part three um 1586 and
1585.

06:00:50.628 --> 06:00:50.638 align:start position:0%
1585.
 
06:00:50.638 --> 06:00:52.868 align:start position:0%
1585.
um

06:00:52.868 --> 06:00:52.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:00:52.878 --> 06:00:55.750 align:start position:0%
um
1586

06:00:55.750 --> 06:00:55.760 align:start position:0%
1586
 
06:00:57.750 --> 06:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
what you're offering uh with
 
06:00:59.430 --> 06:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli
 
06:00:59.440 --> 06:01:01.110 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli
um

06:01:01.110 --> 06:01:01.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:01:04.628 --> 06:01:04.638 align:start position:0%
looks to change the the um the focus of
 
06:01:04.638 --> 06:01:05.590 align:start position:0%
looks to change the the um the focus of
this

06:01:05.590 --> 06:01:05.600 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:01:09.430 --> 06:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
to expand it very broadly to um to
 
06:01:12.830 --> 06:01:12.840 align:start position:0%
encompass co-curriculars
 
06:01:12.840 --> 06:01:14.470 align:start position:0%
encompass co-curriculars
1585

06:01:14.470 --> 06:01:14.480 align:start position:0%
1585
 
06:01:14.480 --> 06:01:16.390 align:start position:0%
1585
um

06:01:16.390 --> 06:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:01:18.948 --> 06:01:18.958 align:start position:0%
keeps it specific to sports related
 
06:01:20.948 --> 06:01:20.958 align:start position:0%
injuries but it does take into
 
06:01:20.958 --> 06:01:22.390 align:start position:0%
injuries but it does take into
consideration

06:01:22.390 --> 06:01:22.400 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
06:01:25.430 --> 06:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
um some of your uh comments
 
06:01:27.430 --> 06:01:27.440 align:start position:0%
rip rick particularly definition of
 
06:01:27.440 --> 06:01:28.470 align:start position:0%
rip rick particularly definition of
sports

06:01:28.470 --> 06:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
sports
 
06:01:31.350 --> 06:01:31.360 align:start position:0%
and and privacy concerns but it doesn't
 
06:01:34.548 --> 06:01:34.558 align:start position:0%
lose fidelity towards the very very
 
06:01:37.350 --> 06:01:37.360 align:start position:0%
specific nature of sports injuries
 
06:01:38.868 --> 06:01:38.878 align:start position:0%
and and
 
06:01:41.030 --> 06:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
and the number of incidents
 
06:01:42.548 --> 06:01:42.558 align:start position:0%
that happened in sports compared to
 
06:01:44.788 --> 06:01:44.798 align:start position:0%
other co-curricular activities and i was
 
06:01:46.470 --> 06:01:46.480 align:start position:0%
wondering if maybe this would be one
 
06:01:51.270 --> 06:01:51.280 align:start position:0%
area where we could unify on the idea to
 
06:01:52.708 --> 06:01:52.718 align:start position:0%
pass um
 
06:01:55.430 --> 06:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
the sports keep it keep it focused on
 
06:01:56.948 --> 06:01:56.958 align:start position:0%
where it is
 
06:01:56.958 --> 06:01:58.628 align:start position:0%
where it is
um

06:01:58.628 --> 06:01:58.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:02:01.510 --> 06:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
given the given the support from from
 
06:02:03.590 --> 06:02:03.600 align:start position:0%
the corey stringer institute and other
 
06:02:07.270 --> 06:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
you know national trainers associations
 
06:02:11.350 --> 06:02:11.360 align:start position:0%
and uh and then look to maybe broaden it
 
06:02:13.510 --> 06:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
um to other um
 
06:02:15.590 --> 06:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh co-curricular activities even though
 
06:02:17.270 --> 06:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
i think there are there is something in
 
06:02:19.030 --> 06:02:19.040 align:start position:0%
the statute already that says schools
 
06:02:21.110 --> 06:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
have to have emergency plans in
 
06:02:23.270 --> 06:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
place for other things but for the sake
 
06:02:24.708 --> 06:02:24.718 align:start position:0%
of our athletes
 
06:02:27.350 --> 06:02:27.360 align:start position:0%
um and frankly all students and and you
 
06:02:29.510 --> 06:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
know i was in the very very unfortunate
 
06:02:29.520 --> 06:02:30.548 align:start position:0%
know i was in the very very unfortunate
position

06:02:30.548 --> 06:02:30.558 align:start position:0%
position
 
06:02:32.470 --> 06:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
um and this time it's not a story about
 
06:02:35.750 --> 06:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
being a ski coach having to take a kid
 
06:02:38.868 --> 06:02:38.878 align:start position:0%
with a broken leg off the mountain but
 
06:02:40.070 --> 06:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
a student from
 
06:02:41.910 --> 06:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
basketball player from claremont
 
06:02:41.920 --> 06:02:43.030 align:start position:0%
basketball player from claremont
collapsed

06:02:43.030 --> 06:02:43.040 align:start position:0%
collapsed
 
06:02:46.390 --> 06:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
on our gym floor in hopkinton um with a
 
06:02:48.868 --> 06:02:48.878 align:start position:0%
cardiac arrest
 
06:02:48.878 --> 06:02:49.670 align:start position:0%
cardiac arrest
and

06:02:49.670 --> 06:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:02:52.470 --> 06:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
um so it does happen um i just don't
 
06:02:55.510 --> 06:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
want to lose the fidelity
 
06:02:57.430 --> 06:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
yup we know injury does occur and
 
06:02:59.670 --> 06:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's horrific
 
06:02:59.680 --> 06:03:00.948 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's horrific
um

06:03:00.948 --> 06:03:00.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:03:03.270 --> 06:03:03.280 align:start position:0%
are there questions from the committee
 
06:03:03.280 --> 06:03:04.628 align:start position:0%
are there questions from the committee
regarding

06:03:04.628 --> 06:03:04.638 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
06:03:06.310 --> 06:03:06.320 align:start position:0%
everybody should have a copy of both
 
06:03:08.310 --> 06:03:08.320 align:start position:0%
these amendments
 
06:03:08.320 --> 06:03:09.590 align:start position:0%
these amendments
um

06:03:09.590 --> 06:03:09.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:03:12.310 --> 06:03:12.320 align:start position:0%
there are some differences of course
 
06:03:15.270 --> 06:03:15.280 align:start position:0%
um the differences i read of course
 
06:03:17.910 --> 06:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
the one that represents presenting is
 
06:03:17.920 --> 06:03:19.030 align:start position:0%
the one that represents presenting is
much

06:03:19.030 --> 06:03:19.040 align:start position:0%
much
 
06:03:21.590 --> 06:03:21.600 align:start position:0%
more narrow than the other where it
 
06:03:22.750 --> 06:03:22.760 align:start position:0%
deals with
 
06:03:27.590 --> 06:03:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:29.590 --> 06:03:29.600 align:start position:0%
we've usually used the words curricular
 
06:03:32.628 --> 06:03:32.638 align:start position:0%
and not a non-curricular in the past
 
06:03:35.830 --> 06:03:35.840 align:start position:0%
or intramurals
 
06:03:37.510 --> 06:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
if it's going to involve grades 4
 
06:03:39.510 --> 06:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
through 12
 
06:03:41.750 --> 06:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
the scholastic program
 
06:03:43.510 --> 06:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
it's usually an activities program
 
06:03:45.270 --> 06:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
sometimes they don't really call it that
 
06:03:47.030 --> 06:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
so it's just a matter of terminology i
 
06:03:50.470 --> 06:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
guess the other changes which i see is
 
06:03:52.390 --> 06:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
that you have in their
 
06:03:54.150 --> 06:03:54.160 align:start position:0%
specific reference to various
 
06:03:54.160 --> 06:03:56.310 align:start position:0%
specific reference to various
associations

06:03:56.310 --> 06:03:56.320 align:start position:0%
associations
 
06:03:58.868 --> 06:03:58.878 align:start position:0%
and pre-participation examination
 
06:04:00.708 --> 06:04:00.718 align:start position:0%
developed by the american academy of
 
06:04:00.718 --> 06:04:02.948 align:start position:0%
developed by the american academy of
pediatrics

06:04:02.948 --> 06:04:02.958 align:start position:0%
pediatrics
 
06:04:06.868 --> 06:04:06.878 align:start position:0%
and i would have questions on that
 
06:04:09.350 --> 06:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
usually you know to get into sports
 
06:04:11.270 --> 06:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
right now especially high school sports
 
06:04:13.430 --> 06:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
you have to have a doctor's clearance
 
06:04:15.110 --> 06:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
and there's a doctor's statement where
 
06:04:16.868 --> 06:04:16.878 align:start position:0%
they put you through the fiscal
 
06:04:16.878 --> 06:04:18.150 align:start position:0%
they put you through the fiscal
examination

06:04:18.150 --> 06:04:18.160 align:start position:0%
examination
 
06:04:20.548 --> 06:04:20.558 align:start position:0%
that's for all kids and that's put out
 
06:04:24.390 --> 06:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:27.910 --> 06:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
so i see those as the major
 
06:04:27.920 --> 06:04:28.830 align:start position:0%
so i see those as the major
major

06:04:28.830 --> 06:04:28.840 align:start position:0%
major
 
06:04:31.350 --> 06:04:31.360 align:start position:0%
differences uh there's
 
06:04:33.110 --> 06:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
you also reference american college of
 
06:04:34.788 --> 06:04:34.798 align:start position:0%
sports medicine and national astronaut
 
06:04:36.788 --> 06:04:36.798 align:start position:0%
trainers association
 
06:04:36.798 --> 06:04:38.948 align:start position:0%
trainers association
um

06:04:38.948 --> 06:04:38.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:04:43.030 --> 06:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
uh in in the last you know in roman two
 
06:04:46.150 --> 06:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
i see those as differences
 
06:04:49.430 --> 06:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
yeah i think i i think those are the
 
06:04:50.948 --> 06:04:50.958 align:start position:0%
the changes
 
06:04:52.310 --> 06:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
are being offered
 
06:04:55.030 --> 06:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
and um and you know some of the things
 
06:04:57.750 --> 06:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
that i think we um
 
06:04:59.990 --> 06:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
you know thought best to to leave in
 
06:05:02.948 --> 06:05:02.958 align:start position:0%
there were basically references to the
 
06:05:04.548 --> 06:05:04.558 align:start position:0%
best practices
 
06:05:06.628 --> 06:05:06.638 align:start position:0%
that uh that that
 
06:05:09.750 --> 06:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
schools across the country are adopting
 
06:05:12.150 --> 06:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
uh when it comes to sports related
 
06:05:12.160 --> 06:05:13.430 align:start position:0%
uh when it comes to sports related
emergencies

06:05:13.430 --> 06:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
emergencies
 
06:05:16.150 --> 06:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
and um you know rather than trying to
 
06:05:17.830 --> 06:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
you know um
 
06:05:21.030 --> 06:05:21.040 align:start position:0%
you know keep our statutes
 
06:05:21.040 --> 06:05:21.990 align:start position:0%
you know keep our statutes
um

06:05:21.990 --> 06:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:05:24.628 --> 06:05:24.638 align:start position:0%
up to date with with changes in best
 
06:05:27.350 --> 06:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
practices relying on those national
 
06:05:27.360 --> 06:05:28.470 align:start position:0%
practices relying on those national
institutes

06:05:28.470 --> 06:05:28.480 align:start position:0%
institutes
 
06:05:29.670 --> 06:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
to um
 
06:05:31.990 --> 06:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
to provide the guidance there and we do
 
06:05:34.310 --> 06:05:34.320 align:start position:0%
that in so many sections of the law so
 
06:05:35.990 --> 06:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
that we're not rewriting laws all the
 
06:05:37.830 --> 06:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
time um
 
06:05:40.310 --> 06:05:40.320 align:start position:0%
but but i guess you know what i'm asking
 
06:05:43.670 --> 06:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
is is if we could avoid the the
 
06:05:46.230 --> 06:05:46.240 align:start position:0%
doing both amendments um
 
06:05:49.910 --> 06:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
uh and and uh and you know
 
06:05:52.150 --> 06:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
really look to to
 
06:05:54.948 --> 06:05:54.958 align:start position:0%
you know keep it focused on on you know
 
06:05:58.150 --> 06:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
what was what was uh what was heard uh
 
06:05:59.990 --> 06:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
in the hearing in the house and senate
 
06:06:01.350 --> 06:06:01.360 align:start position:0%
and um
 
06:06:05.350 --> 06:06:05.360 align:start position:0%
and uh uh and maybe you know agreeing to
 
06:06:07.030 --> 06:06:07.040 align:start position:0%
to bring something
 
06:06:09.830 --> 06:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
uh new back next year
 
06:06:09.840 --> 06:06:11.110 align:start position:0%
uh new back next year
that

06:06:11.110 --> 06:06:11.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:06:14.788 --> 06:06:14.798 align:start position:0%
might add some language to to broaden it
 
06:06:18.548 --> 06:06:18.558 align:start position:0%
in other areas but but you know less um
 
06:06:20.628 --> 06:06:20.638 align:start position:0%
you know areas where there's less less
 
06:06:23.590 --> 06:06:23.600 align:start position:0%
frequency of the impact of student
 
06:06:23.600 --> 06:06:24.868 align:start position:0%
frequency of the impact of student
health

06:06:24.868 --> 06:06:24.878 align:start position:0%
health
 
06:06:27.590 --> 06:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
so so dave let's uh before we make a
 
06:06:29.510 --> 06:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
motion on any one of these things let's
 
06:06:31.510 --> 06:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
uh open this up to discussion with the
 
06:06:34.548 --> 06:06:34.558 align:start position:0%
committee at this time
 
06:06:36.548 --> 06:06:36.558 align:start position:0%
so representative bowman i see your hand
 
06:06:39.910 --> 06:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
what's up yeah thank you okay i think
 
06:06:43.910 --> 06:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
co-curricular better define mr
 
06:06:46.390 --> 06:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for watching
 
06:06:48.868 --> 06:06:48.878 align:start position:0%
these kind of occur i was just thinking
 
06:06:50.788 --> 06:06:50.798 align:start position:0%
of the robotics
 
06:06:52.868 --> 06:06:52.878 align:start position:0%
definitely could be some
 
06:06:54.788 --> 06:06:54.798 align:start position:0%
injuries there and i think it means the
 
06:06:56.868 --> 06:06:56.878 align:start position:0%
same type of uh
 
06:06:59.030 --> 06:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
i mean nobody may be robotic to shape
 
06:07:02.230 --> 06:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
and machine hit somebody um
 
06:07:05.030 --> 06:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
so i think no curriculum i think the
 
06:07:06.868 --> 06:07:06.878 align:start position:0%
better we need to cover
 
06:07:09.270 --> 06:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
everything and other things happening in
 
06:07:10.470 --> 06:07:10.480 align:start position:0%
the schools
 
06:07:12.150 --> 06:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
from other
 
06:07:15.590 --> 06:07:15.600 align:start position:0%
non-sports things but uh
 
06:07:17.590 --> 06:07:17.600 align:start position:0%
even though in science lab and stuff
 
06:07:21.430 --> 06:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
like that and chemicals uh i think
 
06:07:25.190 --> 06:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:25.200 --> 06:07:26.230 align:start position:0%
 
represent

06:07:26.230 --> 06:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
represent
 
06:07:27.990 --> 06:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
your hand up
 
06:07:30.708 --> 06:07:30.718 align:start position:0%
uh yes uh i think i have a little bit of
 
06:07:30.718 --> 06:07:32.390 align:start position:0%
uh yes uh i think i have a little bit of
a

06:07:32.390 --> 06:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:07:34.548 --> 06:07:34.558 align:start position:0%
unique perspective on this having
 
06:07:36.948 --> 06:07:36.958 align:start position:0%
coached for 35 years and
 
06:07:36.958 --> 06:07:38.230 align:start position:0%
coached for 35 years and
and

06:07:38.230 --> 06:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:07:41.270 --> 06:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
being a emt at one point and
 
06:07:43.750 --> 06:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
teaching first aid for a long time
 
06:07:47.110 --> 06:07:47.120 align:start position:0%
first responder first aid and cpr
 
06:07:47.120 --> 06:07:48.310 align:start position:0%
first responder first aid and cpr
aed

06:07:48.310 --> 06:07:48.320 align:start position:0%
aed
 
06:07:50.470 --> 06:07:50.480 align:start position:0%
um sports offer
 
06:07:52.470 --> 06:07:52.480 align:start position:0%
uh more risk
 
06:07:53.910 --> 06:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
involved than
 
06:07:56.310 --> 06:07:56.320 align:start position:0%
and and the number of injuries involved
 
06:07:58.948 --> 06:07:58.958 align:start position:0%
with sports whether they're minor to the
 
06:08:01.110 --> 06:08:01.120 align:start position:0%
cardiac arrest that that happened at
 
06:08:01.120 --> 06:08:02.868 align:start position:0%
cardiac arrest that that happened at
hopkinton

06:08:02.868 --> 06:08:02.878 align:start position:0%
hopkinton
 
06:08:04.948 --> 06:08:04.958 align:start position:0%
they're they're more frequent everybody
 
06:08:07.110 --> 06:08:07.120 align:start position:0%
knows that when they
 
06:08:09.270 --> 06:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
are involved in sports there's an added
 
06:08:09.280 --> 06:08:10.150 align:start position:0%
are involved in sports there's an added
risk

06:08:10.150 --> 06:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
risk
 
06:08:12.708 --> 06:08:12.718 align:start position:0%
and a lot of times
 
06:08:15.350 --> 06:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
those playing fields and
 
06:08:17.910 --> 06:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
gymnasiums and our practices were late
 
06:08:20.150 --> 06:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
at night or sunday morning or
 
06:08:22.310 --> 06:08:22.320 align:start position:0%
you know um
 
06:08:24.470 --> 06:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
just not during the regular school hours
 
06:08:24.480 --> 06:08:25.830 align:start position:0%
just not during the regular school hours
where

06:08:25.830 --> 06:08:25.840 align:start position:0%
where
 
06:08:27.830 --> 06:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of the co-curricular activities
 
06:08:29.590 --> 06:08:29.600 align:start position:0%
take place usually
 
06:08:31.350 --> 06:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
right after school where there is still
 
06:08:33.110 --> 06:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
staff in the building
 
06:08:35.670 --> 06:08:35.680 align:start position:0%
and there is a bus for them to go home
 
06:08:37.910 --> 06:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
whereas sports teams often
 
06:08:39.430 --> 06:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
you know sometimes we're in remote
 
06:08:39.440 --> 06:08:41.830 align:start position:0%
you know sometimes we're in remote
locations

06:08:41.830 --> 06:08:41.840 align:start position:0%
locations
 
06:08:43.350 --> 06:08:43.360 align:start position:0%
so i think that
 
06:08:44.948 --> 06:08:44.958 align:start position:0%
uh the the
 
06:08:46.868 --> 06:08:46.878 align:start position:0%
the probability of somebody jumping off
 
06:08:49.670 --> 06:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
a stage and breaking a leg in theater
 
06:08:52.628 --> 06:08:52.638 align:start position:0%
even though they say it all the time
 
06:08:54.230 --> 06:08:54.240 align:start position:0%
probably isn't
 
06:08:56.868 --> 06:08:56.878 align:start position:0%
near as much of a risk as it is in
 
06:09:00.150 --> 06:09:00.160 align:start position:0%
field hockey or skiing or football or
 
06:09:02.230 --> 06:09:02.240 align:start position:0%
even soccer i mean
 
06:09:05.430 --> 06:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
over the years i've i've witnessed um
 
06:09:07.350 --> 06:09:07.360 align:start position:0%
you know a major break of a
 
06:09:10.150 --> 06:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
of a humorous uh femur break
 
06:09:11.830 --> 06:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
collapsed lung
 
06:09:14.548 --> 06:09:14.558 align:start position:0%
sternum separation from ribs
 
06:09:16.628 --> 06:09:16.638 align:start position:0%
we've had a cardiac arrest that i worked
 
06:09:18.470 --> 06:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
on um
 
06:09:21.110 --> 06:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
you know it was just
 
06:09:23.510 --> 06:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
really important that we had a plan and
 
06:09:25.430 --> 06:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
that we were connected to the local fire
 
06:09:26.948 --> 06:09:26.958 align:start position:0%
and rescue people
 
06:09:28.868 --> 06:09:28.878 align:start position:0%
and kearsarge is located out in the
 
06:09:31.350 --> 06:09:31.360 align:start position:0%
middle of nowhere so you know we we
 
06:09:34.310 --> 06:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
realized we had to be pretty independent
 
06:09:34.320 --> 06:09:35.910 align:start position:0%
realized we had to be pretty independent
um

06:09:35.910 --> 06:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:09:37.430 --> 06:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
all our
 
06:09:38.708 --> 06:09:38.718 align:start position:0%
all our
 
06:09:41.190 --> 06:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
plans though we're not necessarily
 
06:09:43.670 --> 06:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
shared with the other fire departments
 
06:09:48.470 --> 06:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
and emergency groups um it's it's been
 
06:09:51.510 --> 06:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
since columbine it's been kind of
 
06:09:53.110 --> 06:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
progressing how
 
06:09:55.110 --> 06:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
emergency plans are done
 
06:09:58.070 --> 06:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
but this this bill this part of the bill
 
06:09:58.080 --> 06:09:58.948 align:start position:0%
but this this bill this part of the bill
is

06:09:58.948 --> 06:09:58.958 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:10:01.990 --> 06:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
to me very important because not only
 
06:10:04.628 --> 06:10:04.638 align:start position:0%
does it set up a plan and get the
 
06:10:06.390 --> 06:10:06.400 align:start position:0%
schools on board and we know with
 
06:10:08.628 --> 06:10:08.638 align:start position:0%
emergency plans rick you know
 
06:10:10.390 --> 06:10:10.400 align:start position:0%
that a lot of schools were reluctant to
 
06:10:12.788 --> 06:10:12.798 align:start position:0%
do it um and
 
06:10:15.030 --> 06:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
or file it with the state but i think it
 
06:10:16.628 --> 06:10:16.638 align:start position:0%
it's really important they have a plan
 
06:10:18.070 --> 06:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
for athletics
 
06:10:21.830 --> 06:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh that they have um statistics taken
 
06:10:24.150 --> 06:10:24.160 align:start position:0%
for these groups like the pediatric
 
06:10:26.070 --> 06:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
group and the athletic trainers that
 
06:10:28.150 --> 06:10:28.160 align:start position:0%
that's important for them
 
06:10:30.070 --> 06:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
to get statistics and it's also
 
06:10:32.628 --> 06:10:32.638 align:start position:0%
important for them when they set up
 
06:10:34.708 --> 06:10:34.718 align:start position:0%
conditioning programs and programs for
 
06:10:37.030 --> 06:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
coaches to train coaches how to deal
 
06:10:39.590 --> 06:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
with program uh different areas and
 
06:10:41.510 --> 06:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
particularly like heat stroke that's
 
06:10:43.830 --> 06:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
that's a real biggie you may think it is
 
06:10:45.910 --> 06:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
it isn't but that's a real biggie in
 
06:10:45.920 --> 06:10:47.510 align:start position:0%
it isn't but that's a real biggie in
august

06:10:47.510 --> 06:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
august
 
06:10:49.910 --> 06:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
and it's becoming more of a biggie
 
06:10:52.548 --> 06:10:52.558 align:start position:0%
as our heat and humidity you know get
 
06:10:54.708 --> 06:10:54.718 align:start position:0%
higher in august when the football
 
06:10:56.788 --> 06:10:56.798 align:start position:0%
soccer the fall seasons field hockey
 
06:10:59.030 --> 06:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
start start really running off
 
06:11:02.310 --> 06:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
so i hate to see this bill watered down
 
06:11:03.510 --> 06:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
i think
 
06:11:06.310 --> 06:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
dave is right we we need to keep the the
 
06:11:07.990 --> 06:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
um basic
 
06:11:09.270 --> 06:11:09.280 align:start position:0%
part of the bill
 
06:11:12.230 --> 06:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
um i agree with with uh some of the
 
06:11:14.830 --> 06:11:14.840 align:start position:0%
reporting needed to be changed but
 
06:11:18.788 --> 06:11:18.798 align:start position:0%
um you know robotics uh theater art
 
06:11:18.798 --> 06:11:19.670 align:start position:0%
um you know robotics uh theater art
music

06:11:19.670 --> 06:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
music
 
06:11:21.750 --> 06:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
um math team
 
06:11:24.788 --> 06:11:24.798 align:start position:0%
those teams uh have lower risk
 
06:11:27.110 --> 06:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
usually within the building or in a
 
06:11:30.708 --> 06:11:30.718 align:start position:0%
building and should have a nurse a
 
06:11:34.070 --> 06:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
school nurse on board during the day um
 
06:11:36.070 --> 06:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
or a health person
 
06:11:38.070 --> 06:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
that that takes care of that and usually
 
06:11:39.590 --> 06:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
there's people identified on the
 
06:11:41.030 --> 06:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
teaching staff
 
06:11:43.110 --> 06:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
who have been trained
 
06:11:45.030 --> 06:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
so um
 
06:11:47.990 --> 06:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
i would i really um am passionate about
 
06:11:49.990 --> 06:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
this i think i think we need to keep it
 
06:11:53.510 --> 06:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
with sports so thank you
 
06:11:55.430 --> 06:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
06:11:58.150 --> 06:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
06:12:00.230 --> 06:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
just a question about something i just
 
06:12:02.548 --> 06:12:02.558 align:start position:0%
heard from the representative
 
06:12:02.558 --> 06:12:03.670 align:start position:0%
heard from the representative
uh

06:12:03.670 --> 06:12:03.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:12:06.788 --> 06:12:06.798 align:start position:0%
mentioned something about statistics for
 
06:12:10.548 --> 06:12:10.558 align:start position:0%
the national trainers association and
 
06:12:12.628 --> 06:12:12.638 align:start position:0%
college of sports medicine i don't see
 
06:12:14.628 --> 06:12:14.638 align:start position:0%
anything in here about providing them
 
06:12:14.638 --> 06:12:15.830 align:start position:0%
anything in here about providing them
information

06:12:15.830 --> 06:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
information
 
06:12:17.350 --> 06:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering if i'm missing
 
06:12:18.548 --> 06:12:18.558 align:start position:0%
something or
 
06:12:24.830 --> 06:12:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:27.830 --> 06:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
comments are you asking me
 
06:12:27.840 --> 06:12:28.788 align:start position:0%
comments are you asking me
uh

06:12:28.788 --> 06:12:28.798 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:12:31.190 --> 06:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
yes or anyone else if i if i missed
 
06:12:32.548 --> 06:12:32.558 align:start position:0%
anything there i don't see anything
 
06:12:35.750 --> 06:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
about providing information to the
 
06:12:40.390 --> 06:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:43.110 --> 06:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
i thought there was um
 
06:12:43.120 --> 06:12:44.150 align:start position:0%
i thought there was um
uh

06:12:44.150 --> 06:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:12:46.230 --> 06:12:46.240 align:start position:0%
the the policies
 
06:12:48.470 --> 06:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
um let's see
 
06:12:51.110 --> 06:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
i thought some of it was
 
06:12:52.788 --> 06:12:52.798 align:start position:0%
i'll go back through it but i i thought
 
06:12:54.948 --> 06:12:54.958 align:start position:0%
there was a part where
 
06:12:56.390 --> 06:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
there was
 
06:12:59.270 --> 06:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
procedures and and um statistics that
 
06:13:01.030 --> 06:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
were kept on hand
 
06:13:03.030 --> 06:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
for what had happened
 
06:13:05.270 --> 06:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
i i know it i know at our school
 
06:13:07.430 --> 06:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
whenever there was an accident
 
06:13:09.590 --> 06:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh we also had an accident report we had
 
06:13:10.788 --> 06:13:10.798 align:start position:0%
to fill out
 
06:13:13.110 --> 06:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
um that was filed with the school
 
06:13:15.510 --> 06:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
and um
 
06:13:17.910 --> 06:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
but i think this uh you know has a
 
06:13:20.628 --> 06:13:20.638 align:start position:0%
little bit more detail so if i missed it
 
06:13:22.390 --> 06:13:22.400 align:start position:0%
i missed it sorry
 
06:13:24.948 --> 06:13:24.958 align:start position:0%
no no i didn't if i can address that mr
 
06:13:24.958 --> 06:13:26.390 align:start position:0%
no no i didn't if i can address that mr
chair

06:13:26.390 --> 06:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
chair
 
06:13:27.590 --> 06:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
um i
 
06:13:31.590 --> 06:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
in the in the amendment in 1585
 
06:13:34.868 --> 06:13:34.878 align:start position:0%
um after the the um
 
06:13:37.270 --> 06:13:37.280 align:start position:0%
the partner and i'm looking at the word
 
06:13:39.670 --> 06:13:39.680 align:start position:0%
document that um i don't know if
 
06:13:42.470 --> 06:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
everybody else has i i i did send out a
 
06:13:42.480 --> 06:13:43.430 align:start position:0%
everybody else has i i i did send out a
copy

06:13:43.430 --> 06:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
copy
 
06:13:45.270 --> 06:13:45.280 align:start position:0%
of it but um
 
06:13:47.590 --> 06:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
but after the section where it talks
 
06:13:51.190 --> 06:13:51.200 align:start position:0%
about hipaa and ferpa the next sentence
 
06:13:52.708 --> 06:13:52.718 align:start position:0%
which i think is what representative
 
06:13:54.628 --> 06:13:54.638 align:start position:0%
tanner was referring to a comprehensive
 
06:13:56.470 --> 06:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
history of information relative to
 
06:13:56.480 --> 06:13:57.670 align:start position:0%
history of information relative to
injuries

06:13:57.670 --> 06:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
injuries
 
06:14:00.310 --> 06:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
um that part is struck
 
06:14:00.320 --> 06:14:02.070 align:start position:0%
um that part is struck
um

06:14:02.070 --> 06:14:02.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:14:03.670 --> 06:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
you know it may be somewhere else in the
 
06:14:07.270 --> 06:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
law but uh but we took it out of of this
 
06:14:10.628 --> 06:14:10.638 align:start position:0%
due to the chairs concerns about um
 
06:14:10.638 --> 06:14:14.070 align:start position:0%
due to the chairs concerns about um
privacy

06:14:14.070 --> 06:14:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:16.948 --> 06:14:16.958 align:start position:0%
thank you uh rep said uh
 
06:14:19.030 --> 06:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
yeah mike lakes
 
06:14:19.040 --> 06:14:20.070 align:start position:0%
yeah mike lakes
yeah

06:14:20.070 --> 06:14:20.080 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:14:23.590 --> 06:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
i don't see expanding this to other
 
06:14:26.868 --> 06:14:26.878 align:start position:0%
activities then sports waters it down in
 
06:14:29.190 --> 06:14:29.200 align:start position:0%
any way it just says this is a really
 
06:14:31.590 --> 06:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
good idea let's follow this up with
 
06:14:33.830 --> 06:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
everybody else and i want to say i was
 
06:14:35.510 --> 06:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
in the marching band
 
06:14:37.270 --> 06:14:37.280 align:start position:0%
we practiced under the lights and we
 
06:14:38.948 --> 06:14:38.958 align:start position:0%
were the only ones there we traveled
 
06:14:41.510 --> 06:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
every place the football teams went
 
06:14:44.070 --> 06:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
we had ankle and whatever injuries we
 
06:14:47.350 --> 06:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
had heat stroke injuries
 
06:14:50.788 --> 06:14:50.798 align:start position:0%
imagine being in your winter wool
 
06:14:53.510 --> 06:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
uniforms that are designed for lasting
 
06:14:55.510 --> 06:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
on a friday night football game in
 
06:14:59.350 --> 06:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
november and being in a band competition
 
06:15:01.670 --> 06:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
lined up for inspection we lost quite a
 
06:15:03.030 --> 06:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
few students
 
06:15:05.670 --> 06:15:05.680 align:start position:0%
who just dropped because they were way
 
06:15:07.590 --> 06:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
overheated because it happened to be one
 
06:15:09.910 --> 06:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
of those really hot spring days
 
06:15:13.190 --> 06:15:13.200 align:start position:0%
and it was just as important
 
06:15:15.750 --> 06:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
for us to know how to handle those heat
 
06:15:18.230 --> 06:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
emergencies for that band and let me
 
06:15:20.628 --> 06:15:20.638 align:start position:0%
tell you we were in some other town far
 
06:15:20.638 --> 06:15:21.590 align:start position:0%
tell you we were in some other town far
away

06:15:21.590 --> 06:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
away
 
06:15:23.030 --> 06:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
from home
 
06:15:25.190 --> 06:15:25.200 align:start position:0%
when that happened so i think those
 
06:15:27.430 --> 06:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
things are just as important and some of
 
06:15:29.430 --> 06:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
the schools especially the agricultural
 
06:15:31.910 --> 06:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
schools have forestry clubs and so
 
06:15:34.230 --> 06:15:34.240 align:start position:0%
they're gone cutting wood and all kinds
 
06:15:36.708 --> 06:15:36.718 align:start position:0%
of stuff um
 
06:15:38.548 --> 06:15:38.558 align:start position:0%
in places that aren't anywhere near the
 
06:15:40.868 --> 06:15:40.878 align:start position:0%
school and as far as theater i know
 
06:15:43.510 --> 06:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
people who students who did theater and
 
06:15:45.510 --> 06:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
they were constantly climbing up in the
 
06:15:47.510 --> 06:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
rigging up above
 
06:15:51.030 --> 06:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
and so a fall or whatever from there
 
06:15:53.430 --> 06:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
can be pretty serious so i think it's
 
06:15:55.990 --> 06:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
short-sighted to say no we're just going
 
06:15:57.830 --> 06:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
to look at sports because sports are
 
06:16:00.150 --> 06:16:00.160 align:start position:0%
more likely to have accidents
 
06:16:02.150 --> 06:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
there are still accidents in other
 
06:16:05.350 --> 06:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
things and not necessarily at school
 
06:16:08.070 --> 06:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
right after school and so i think
 
06:16:10.310 --> 06:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
expanding this doesn't water it down at
 
06:16:12.470 --> 06:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
all it just says this is a good idea
 
06:16:13.910 --> 06:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
let's make sure all our students are
 
06:16:17.750 --> 06:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:17.760 --> 06:16:18.948 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:16:18.948 --> 06:16:18.958 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:16:20.868 --> 06:16:20.878 align:start position:0%
i got a question
 
06:16:22.868 --> 06:16:22.878 align:start position:0%
does anybody know what the
 
06:16:25.750 --> 06:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
pre-participate examination looks like
 
06:16:27.350 --> 06:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
that's put out by the american academy
 
06:16:29.350 --> 06:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
of pediatrics
 
06:16:33.990 --> 06:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:37.270 --> 06:16:37.280 align:start position:0%
um so representative miler i'm marissa
 
06:16:38.470 --> 06:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
06:16:38.480 --> 06:16:39.270 align:start position:0%
mr chair
yeah

06:16:39.270 --> 06:16:39.280 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:16:39.280 --> 06:16:40.070 align:start position:0%
yeah
um

06:16:40.070 --> 06:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:16:42.948 --> 06:16:42.958 align:start position:0%
there is somebody from the um the corey
 
06:16:45.510 --> 06:16:45.520 align:start position:0%
stringer institute that's um in our
 
06:16:48.708 --> 06:16:48.718 align:start position:0%
attendees and we may want to bring um dr
 
06:16:50.948 --> 06:16:50.958 align:start position:0%
sternson to address that question
 
06:16:54.708 --> 06:16:54.718 align:start position:0%
specifically and she has her hand up
 
06:16:55.990 --> 06:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
okay can we
 
06:16:59.510 --> 06:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:03.110 --> 06:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:05.670 --> 06:17:05.680 align:start position:0%
hello representatives thank you for
 
06:17:07.670 --> 06:17:07.680 align:start position:0%
for acknowledging me
 
06:17:10.070 --> 06:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
um and i can speak to the american
 
06:17:12.230 --> 06:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
academy of pediatrics pre-participation
 
06:17:14.628 --> 06:17:14.638 align:start position:0%
exam and i can tell you that it is
 
06:17:17.350 --> 06:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
an exam that is open and freely
 
06:17:19.350 --> 06:17:19.360 align:start position:0%
accessible online that's published by
 
06:17:20.788 --> 06:17:20.798 align:start position:0%
the aap
 
06:17:22.470 --> 06:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
and it is a standard exam that has been
 
06:17:24.628 --> 06:17:24.638 align:start position:0%
adopted across many states
 
06:17:24.638 --> 06:17:25.670 align:start position:0%
adopted across many states
to

06:17:25.670 --> 06:17:25.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:17:27.350 --> 06:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
streamline the
 
06:17:30.948 --> 06:17:30.958 align:start position:0%
pre-participation exam process because
 
06:17:33.430 --> 06:17:33.440 align:start position:0%
depending on where you go for your ppe
 
06:17:35.670 --> 06:17:35.680 align:start position:0%
many physicians who may or may not have
 
06:17:35.680 --> 06:17:36.948 align:start position:0%
many physicians who may or may not have
expertise

06:17:36.948 --> 06:17:36.958 align:start position:0%
expertise
 
06:17:39.430 --> 06:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
in the orthopedic injuries sustained by
 
06:17:39.440 --> 06:17:40.708 align:start position:0%
in the orthopedic injuries sustained by
athletes

06:17:40.708 --> 06:17:40.718 align:start position:0%
athletes
 
06:17:42.390 --> 06:17:42.400 align:start position:0%
have the knowledge and expertise to ask
 
06:17:43.990 --> 06:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
specific questions that would be very
 
06:17:46.548 --> 06:17:46.558 align:start position:0%
pertinent to the risks associated
 
06:17:48.788 --> 06:17:48.798 align:start position:0%
with sport participation so
 
06:17:51.270 --> 06:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
what this ppe does is it provides
 
06:17:53.350 --> 06:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
guidance to ensure that all of those
 
06:17:54.868 --> 06:17:54.878 align:start position:0%
components are included in the
 
06:17:58.310 --> 06:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:59.990 --> 06:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
thank you doctor can you tell me who
 
06:18:02.628 --> 06:18:02.638 align:start position:0%
administers the ppe
 
06:18:05.670 --> 06:18:05.680 align:start position:0%
yep um any um physician that an athlete
 
06:18:05.680 --> 06:18:07.110 align:start position:0%
yep um any um physician that an athlete
would

06:18:07.110 --> 06:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
would
 
06:18:09.350 --> 06:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
schedule their annual exam with could
 
06:18:13.270 --> 06:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:17.190 --> 06:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
for example if i took my child to my
 
06:18:19.670 --> 06:18:19.680 align:start position:0%
child's pediatrician
 
06:18:22.868 --> 06:18:22.878 align:start position:0%
that doctor would have that
 
06:18:25.750 --> 06:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
participation examination there
 
06:18:27.590 --> 06:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
they would have access to it or you
 
06:18:27.600 --> 06:18:28.708 align:start position:0%
they would have access to it or you
could

06:18:28.708 --> 06:18:28.718 align:start position:0%
could
 
06:18:30.788 --> 06:18:30.798 align:start position:0%
the athlete could bring it with them for
 
06:18:32.390 --> 06:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
their exam
 
06:18:34.628 --> 06:18:34.638 align:start position:0%
depending on many schools
 
06:18:36.788 --> 06:18:36.798 align:start position:0%
because of the diversity in history and
 
06:18:39.270 --> 06:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
ppes many schools will provide the
 
06:18:41.670 --> 06:18:41.680 align:start position:0%
actual paperwork to the students and
 
06:18:42.868 --> 06:18:42.878 align:start position:0%
they will bring that with them to
 
06:18:45.350 --> 06:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
complete when they have their exam so
 
06:18:47.030 --> 06:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
it could be accessed either by providing
 
06:18:48.868 --> 06:18:48.878 align:start position:0%
it to the students or
 
06:18:50.868 --> 06:18:50.878 align:start position:0%
it could be accessed for uh by the
 
06:18:53.430 --> 06:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
physician themselves by going to the aap
 
06:18:53.440 --> 06:18:54.708 align:start position:0%
physician themselves by going to the aap
website

06:18:54.708 --> 06:18:54.718 align:start position:0%
website
 
06:18:56.470 --> 06:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
okay i have one last question for you
 
06:18:58.230 --> 06:18:58.240 align:start position:0%
doctor and then i'll open up the rest of
 
06:18:59.270 --> 06:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
06:18:59.280 --> 06:19:01.030 align:start position:0%
the committee
um

06:19:01.030 --> 06:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:19:03.350 --> 06:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
how different is this exam
 
06:19:05.270 --> 06:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
from that which
 
06:19:08.310 --> 06:19:08.320 align:start position:0%
schools are required to have their
 
06:19:09.670 --> 06:19:09.680 align:start position:0%
you know before they can get into
 
06:19:11.990 --> 06:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
athletics to have an examination from a
 
06:19:13.590 --> 06:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
medical doctor
 
06:19:17.430 --> 06:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
how different are the two examinations
 
06:19:19.590 --> 06:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
so because there could be variants in
 
06:19:21.670 --> 06:19:21.680 align:start position:0%
what is currently
 
06:19:23.270 --> 06:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
being used across various school
 
06:19:25.270 --> 06:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
districts and schools themselves i can't
 
06:19:27.030 --> 06:19:27.040 align:start position:0%
speak specifically to that but all i can
 
06:19:28.708 --> 06:19:28.718 align:start position:0%
say is that this
 
06:19:31.190 --> 06:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
american academy of pediatrics
 
06:19:33.190 --> 06:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
pre-participation exam
 
06:19:35.270 --> 06:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
ensures that
 
06:19:37.190 --> 06:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
the questions pertaining to the top
 
06:19:38.708 --> 06:19:38.718 align:start position:0%
causes of
 
06:19:40.390 --> 06:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
sudden death and sport are addressed so
 
06:19:42.868 --> 06:19:42.878 align:start position:0%
it it addresses items
 
06:19:45.350 --> 06:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
pertaining to previous head injuries um
 
06:19:47.670 --> 06:19:47.680 align:start position:0%
previous heat injuries
 
06:19:49.910 --> 06:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
if there are any blood conditions that
 
06:19:51.750 --> 06:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
could predispose them to say an
 
06:19:53.750 --> 06:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
exertional sickling episode all of those
 
06:19:56.470 --> 06:19:56.480 align:start position:0%
are top causes of death in sport and so
 
06:19:58.628 --> 06:19:58.638 align:start position:0%
it ensures that those components are
 
06:20:00.708 --> 06:20:00.718 align:start position:0%
addressed in the history
 
06:20:02.708 --> 06:20:02.718 align:start position:0%
questions that the physician is asking
 
06:20:04.470 --> 06:20:04.480 align:start position:0%
which may or may not be included in
 
06:20:06.470 --> 06:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
other exams
 
06:20:09.990 --> 06:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
thank you um are there questions
 
06:20:11.910 --> 06:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
of the doctor from other members of the
 
06:20:11.920 --> 06:20:15.270 align:start position:0%
of the doctor from other members of the
committee

06:20:15.270 --> 06:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:16.948 --> 06:20:16.958 align:start position:0%
not seeing any hands thank you very much
 
06:20:21.990 --> 06:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:24.390 --> 06:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
okay so we've uh
 
06:20:27.350 --> 06:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
had some discussion regarding
 
06:20:27.360 --> 06:20:31.190 align:start position:0%
had some discussion regarding
1585

06:20:31.190 --> 06:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:36.150 --> 06:20:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:38.470 --> 06:20:38.480 align:start position:0%
and i think everybody now
 
06:20:40.470 --> 06:20:40.480 align:start position:0%
knows the differences
 
06:20:40.480 --> 06:20:42.510 align:start position:0%
knows the differences
um

06:20:42.510 --> 06:20:42.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:20:42.520 --> 06:20:44.708 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

06:20:44.708 --> 06:20:44.718 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:20:47.270 --> 06:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
do we need any time folks to talk this
 
06:20:47.280 --> 06:20:48.070 align:start position:0%
do we need any time folks to talk this
over

06:20:48.070 --> 06:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
over
 
06:20:51.110 --> 06:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
i wanted one more thing to okay mention
 
06:20:53.270 --> 06:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
so um
 
06:20:55.030 --> 06:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
something that i've noticed that we've
 
06:20:57.910 --> 06:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
gotten in trouble with in the past
 
06:21:01.190 --> 06:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
is putting into law the names of
 
06:21:01.200 --> 06:21:02.868 align:start position:0%
is putting into law the names of
organizations

06:21:02.868 --> 06:21:02.878 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
06:21:05.430 --> 06:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
because they changed their names
 
06:21:06.708 --> 06:21:06.718 align:start position:0%
um and
 
06:21:08.788 --> 06:21:08.798 align:start position:0%
came across that this year and something
 
06:21:10.548 --> 06:21:10.558 align:start position:0%
i don't remember but
 
06:21:12.628 --> 06:21:12.638 align:start position:0%
but the organization that was in the law
 
06:21:15.030 --> 06:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
no longer still existed but had a
 
06:21:17.510 --> 06:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
completely different name and so i'm
 
06:21:22.310 --> 06:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:25.350 --> 06:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
of actual organizations
 
06:21:27.510 --> 06:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
in the law because
 
06:21:29.510 --> 06:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
two years from now they may decide
 
06:21:31.270 --> 06:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
they're not for instance american
 
06:21:33.350 --> 06:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
college of sports medicine
 
06:21:34.868 --> 06:21:34.878 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
06:21:37.430 --> 06:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
some other similar
 
06:21:39.510 --> 06:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
name just because the board of directors
 
06:21:42.310 --> 06:21:42.320 align:start position:0%
decided this other name sounded better
 
06:21:46.390 --> 06:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
so i you know i
 
06:21:48.788 --> 06:21:48.798 align:start position:0%
referring to
 
06:21:51.670 --> 06:21:51.680 align:start position:0%
somehow what best practices are without
 
06:21:54.788 --> 06:21:54.798 align:start position:0%
actually naming names of organizations
 
06:21:56.708 --> 06:21:56.718 align:start position:0%
just seems
 
06:21:58.470 --> 06:21:58.480 align:start position:0%
better so we're not having to come back
 
06:22:00.868 --> 06:22:00.878 align:start position:0%
and change them when they decide
 
06:22:02.390 --> 06:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
they want to go by somewhat different
 
06:22:02.400 --> 06:22:05.910 align:start position:0%
they want to go by somewhat different
name

06:22:05.910 --> 06:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:05.920 --> 06:22:07.030 align:start position:0%
 
woodcock

06:22:07.030 --> 06:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
woodcock
 
06:22:10.150 --> 06:22:10.160 align:start position:0%
thank you uh chairman
 
06:22:11.750 --> 06:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
i just want to call on the general
 
06:22:13.590 --> 06:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
process a piece of this part of the
 
06:22:13.600 --> 06:22:14.628 align:start position:0%
process a piece of this part of the
building

06:22:14.628 --> 06:22:14.638 align:start position:0%
building
 
06:22:16.548 --> 06:22:16.558 align:start position:0%
having seen it both as an administrator
 
06:22:16.558 --> 06:22:17.270 align:start position:0%
having seen it both as an administrator
and

06:22:17.270 --> 06:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:22:20.628 --> 06:22:20.638 align:start position:0%
30 years as a coach in three sports
 
06:22:23.270 --> 06:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
sport is uniquely
 
06:22:23.280 --> 06:22:24.390 align:start position:0%
sport is uniquely
different

06:22:24.390 --> 06:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
different
 
06:22:26.948 --> 06:22:26.958 align:start position:0%
than other co-curricular activities not
 
06:22:29.030 --> 06:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
suggesting in a moment all students
 
06:22:30.310 --> 06:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
should be covered
 
06:22:33.350 --> 06:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
all schools have plans but sport is the
 
06:22:33.360 --> 06:22:35.030 align:start position:0%
all schools have plans but sport is the
only

06:22:35.030 --> 06:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
only
 
06:22:37.350 --> 06:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
organization we have for youngsters that
 
06:22:39.430 --> 06:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
they have to take a free physical that
 
06:22:41.510 --> 06:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
i'm aware of there's no pre-physical for
 
06:22:44.868 --> 06:22:44.878 align:start position:0%
music for art for stem for robotics for
 
06:22:47.350 --> 06:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
the forestry club that's not because the
 
06:22:50.070 --> 06:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
unique nature of sport is inherently
 
06:22:52.310 --> 06:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
more dangerous across the general
 
06:22:54.948 --> 06:22:54.958 align:start position:0%
spectrum um so i'm just suggesting i
 
06:22:56.548 --> 06:22:56.558 align:start position:0%
think in this particular case it's
 
06:22:58.868 --> 06:22:58.878 align:start position:0%
important for us to hone in on the sport
 
06:23:01.270 --> 06:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
factor and then if
 
06:23:03.270 --> 06:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
because it's set up for the sport factor
 
06:23:05.590 --> 06:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
um because it's more unique or risky and
 
06:23:07.190 --> 06:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
then if we believe we want to expand it
 
06:23:09.110 --> 06:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
to alcohol curricula
 
06:23:10.788 --> 06:23:10.798 align:start position:0%
let's let's put down that get some
 
06:23:13.270 --> 06:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
information from the the high school
 
06:23:13.280 --> 06:23:14.868 align:start position:0%
information from the the high school
folks

06:23:14.868 --> 06:23:14.878 align:start position:0%
folks
 
06:23:21.270 --> 06:23:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:22.788 --> 06:23:22.798 align:start position:0%
i told you at one point that dog will be
 
06:23:26.070 --> 06:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
barking sorry um in either case the the
 
06:23:27.510 --> 06:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
the other the other co-curricular
 
06:23:29.590 --> 06:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
activities could very well be integrated
 
06:23:32.150 --> 06:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
in a broader picture uh in the future
 
06:23:33.750 --> 06:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
and we can go back to the nhia the
 
06:23:35.110 --> 06:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
activity section and have them bring
 
06:23:37.510 --> 06:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
something forward uh and as a school
 
06:23:39.590 --> 06:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
principal association as well i'm i'm
 
06:23:41.670 --> 06:23:41.680 align:start position:0%
just thinking this time this is specific
 
06:23:43.750 --> 06:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
for sport because it requires a
 
06:23:46.548 --> 06:23:46.558 align:start position:0%
pre-examination it is inherent in injury
 
06:23:48.788 --> 06:23:48.798 align:start position:0%
um and we should facilitate i think that
 
06:23:51.270 --> 06:23:51.280 align:start position:0%
this document singularly on that part of
 
06:23:53.270 --> 06:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
sport interest and go back to the the
 
06:23:55.430 --> 06:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
expanded core curricula at a future date
 
06:23:56.628 --> 06:23:56.638 align:start position:0%
when we have a chance to get more data
 
06:23:58.868 --> 06:23:58.878 align:start position:0%
on what would be best served
 
06:24:03.910 --> 06:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:06.390 --> 06:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much mr chair uh you
 
06:24:08.788 --> 06:24:08.798 align:start position:0%
know uh we we we have had quite a bit of
 
06:24:10.628 --> 06:24:10.638 align:start position:0%
discussion i know we could go into more
 
06:24:14.150 --> 06:24:14.160 align:start position:0%
but i would like to move amendment 1585
 
06:24:17.190 --> 06:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
for odd to pass
 
06:24:17.200 --> 06:24:19.350 align:start position:0%
for odd to pass
second

06:24:19.350 --> 06:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
second
 
06:24:23.030 --> 06:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
okay well we have a motion for
 
06:24:25.590 --> 06:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
15.85 on the table made by
 
06:24:28.788 --> 06:24:28.798 align:start position:0%
representative and second by
 
06:24:30.310 --> 06:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
who is the
 
06:24:30.320 --> 06:24:38.788 align:start position:0%
who is the
woodside

06:24:38.788 --> 06:24:38.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:38.798 --> 06:24:39.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

chorus and those places they all have to
 
06:29:08.310 --> 06:29:08.320 align:start position:0%
work up a plan that has to be on file
 
06:29:10.230 --> 06:29:10.240 align:start position:0%
with the department of education the
 
06:29:11.910 --> 06:29:11.920 align:start position:0%
school board has to know not the
 
06:29:13.830 --> 06:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
department of education school board has
 
06:29:17.430 --> 06:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
to develop the policy
 
06:29:19.270 --> 06:29:19.280 align:start position:0%
and that's where it goes and then you
 
06:29:21.830 --> 06:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
list each school plan shall include the
 
06:29:23.750 --> 06:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
following documents and they're all all
 
06:29:27.270 --> 06:29:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:29.270 --> 06:29:29.280 align:start position:0%
whatever the number goes to
 
06:29:31.670 --> 06:29:31.680 align:start position:0%

06:29:37.030 --> 06:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
the other
 
06:29:38.708 --> 06:29:38.718 align:start position:0%
volunteer time
 
06:29:41.350 --> 06:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
the other bill had to do the same thing
 
06:29:43.830 --> 06:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
for the sports teams well the other bill
 
06:29:47.030 --> 06:29:47.040 align:start position:0%

thank you i'm just i'm just curious i
 
06:29:50.390 --> 06:29:50.400 align:start position:0%
just i thought before we had had a
 
06:29:52.230 --> 06:29:52.240 align:start position:0%
discussion about not forcing schools to
 
06:29:53.430 --> 06:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
do something
 
06:29:55.350 --> 06:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
um and now we're forcing schools to do
 
06:29:57.350 --> 06:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
something so i'm just
 
06:29:57.360 --> 06:29:59.190 align:start position:0%
something so i'm just
asking

06:29:59.190 --> 06:29:59.200 align:start position:0%
asking
 
06:30:01.350 --> 06:30:01.360 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
06:30:01.360 --> 06:30:02.628 align:start position:0%
further discussion

represent your
 
06:30:12.150 --> 06:30:12.160 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative uh as
 
06:30:14.948 --> 06:30:14.958 align:start position:0%
i read this more closely on uh
 
06:30:18.310 --> 06:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
the intro i was wondering why uh
 
06:30:20.548 --> 06:30:20.558 align:start position:0%
charter public schools is not included
 
06:30:21.830 --> 06:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
if we're going to full curricula i
 
06:30:23.590 --> 06:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
understand most chartered public schools
 
06:30:24.868 --> 06:30:24.878 align:start position:0%
a limited number of athletics but if
 
06:30:26.948 --> 06:30:26.958 align:start position:0%
we're going to full co curricula i would
 
06:30:35.750 --> 06:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:37.430 --> 06:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
i mean if support enough for a public
 
06:30:39.350 --> 06:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
school co-curricular to be seen public
 
06:30:43.990 --> 06:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:45.670 --> 06:30:45.680 align:start position:0%
well we're talking about public schools
 
06:30:47.030 --> 06:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
here in charter schools our public
 
06:30:49.190 --> 06:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
schools i understand that it says online
 
06:30:51.510 --> 06:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
18 on the amendment says local school
 
06:30:55.990 --> 06:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:57.830 --> 06:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
school school districts don't control
 
06:30:59.990 --> 06:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
school boards for charter schools
 
06:31:01.750 --> 06:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know why charter schools if it's
 
06:31:03.270 --> 06:31:03.280 align:start position:0%
that important that the
 
06:31:05.030 --> 06:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
every single co-critical activity has it
 
06:31:06.868 --> 06:31:06.878 align:start position:0%
then it should include china public
 
06:31:06.878 --> 06:31:09.430 align:start position:0%
then it should include china public
schools

06:31:09.430 --> 06:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:11.350 --> 06:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
great so noted
 
06:31:13.190 --> 06:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
06:31:14.948 --> 06:31:14.958 align:start position:0%
well can that be changed or just you're
 
06:31:25.750 --> 06:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:25.760 --> 06:31:27.510 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

06:31:27.510 --> 06:31:27.520 align:start position:0%

06:31:33.350 --> 06:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
know with all due respect i don't
 
06:31:35.110 --> 06:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
believe the amendment that's on the
 
06:31:36.708 --> 06:31:36.718 align:start position:0%
table right now
 
06:31:38.310 --> 06:31:38.320 align:start position:0%
is um
 
06:31:41.830 --> 06:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
uh provides um uh the uh anywhere close
 
06:31:44.468 --> 06:31:44.478 align:start position:0%
to the same level of
 
06:31:48.788 --> 06:31:48.798 align:start position:0%
of of protection for um for you know for
 
06:31:50.708 --> 06:31:50.718 align:start position:0%
students in the event of of sports
 
06:31:53.430 --> 06:31:53.440 align:start position:0%
injuries as either the prior amendment
 
06:31:57.830 --> 06:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh we considered or the the baseline um
 
06:31:57.840 --> 06:31:59.110 align:start position:0%
uh we considered or the the baseline um
part

06:31:59.110 --> 06:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
part
 
06:32:02.390 --> 06:32:02.400 align:start position:0%
three part three in senate bill 148
 
06:32:04.948 --> 06:32:04.958 align:start position:0%
and um and so i think if we're if we're
 
06:32:08.468 --> 06:32:08.478 align:start position:0%
really interested in in um in
 
06:32:10.468 --> 06:32:10.478 align:start position:0%
in uh uh
 
06:32:13.990 --> 06:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
prov or at least mitigating the um uh
 
06:32:18.628 --> 06:32:18.638 align:start position:0%
the impact of um of injuries
 
06:32:20.310 --> 06:32:20.320 align:start position:0%
that happen to
 
06:32:22.230 --> 06:32:22.240 align:start position:0%
to students during
 
06:32:24.788 --> 06:32:24.798 align:start position:0%
um interscholastic and intrascholastic
 
06:32:24.798 --> 06:32:27.590 align:start position:0%
um interscholastic and intrascholastic
sports

06:32:27.590 --> 06:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:29.590 --> 06:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
then i think sticking with
 
06:32:31.750 --> 06:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
well we we just lost our ability to go
 
06:32:33.750 --> 06:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
to the um to the amendment offered
 
06:32:36.070 --> 06:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
earlier but sticking with the
 
06:32:38.230 --> 06:32:38.240 align:start position:0%
with the bill with section three in the
 
06:32:40.708 --> 06:32:40.718 align:start position:0%
bill as presented from the senate would
 
06:32:47.270 --> 06:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:49.270 --> 06:32:49.280 align:start position:0%
uh what we're going to do for the whole
 
06:32:51.590 --> 06:32:51.600 align:start position:0%

okay

06:49:16.310 --> 06:49:16.320 align:start position:0%

okay uh
 
06:49:25.110 --> 06:49:25.120 align:start position:0%
what we have done and what we're going
 
06:49:26.390 --> 06:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
to go
 
06:49:28.868 --> 06:49:28.878 align:start position:0%
forward with is that
 
06:49:30.830 --> 06:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
in looking at
 
06:49:35.510 --> 06:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
um uh the amendment 1586
 
06:49:39.590 --> 06:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:39.600 --> 06:49:40.548 align:start position:0%
 
we're

06:49:40.548 --> 06:49:40.558 align:start position:0%
we're
 
06:49:42.788 --> 06:49:42.798 align:start position:0%
looking to have a change made
 
06:49:44.788 --> 06:49:44.798 align:start position:0%
legislative services is working on it as
 
06:49:46.788 --> 06:49:46.798 align:start position:0%
we're speaking
 
06:49:49.590 --> 06:49:49.600 align:start position:0%
emergency plans for co-curricular
 
06:49:49.600 --> 06:49:50.948 align:start position:0%
emergency plans for co-curricular
injuries

06:49:50.948 --> 06:49:50.958 align:start position:0%
injuries
 
06:49:52.548 --> 06:49:52.558 align:start position:0%
rather than for sports related
 
06:49:55.110 --> 06:49:55.120 align:start position:0%
co-curricular related injuries versus
 
06:49:57.590 --> 06:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
sport related injuries because that was
 
06:49:59.190 --> 06:49:59.200 align:start position:0%
a conflict
 
06:50:02.150 --> 06:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
and on line 18 a local board of each
 
06:50:04.468 --> 06:50:04.478 align:start position:0%
school district or
 
06:50:06.708 --> 06:50:06.718 align:start position:0%
public chartered school
 
06:50:09.030 --> 06:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
or the governing body of each non-public
 
06:50:10.948 --> 06:50:10.958 align:start position:0%
school shout
 
06:50:12.628 --> 06:50:12.638 align:start position:0%
so those
 
06:50:14.548 --> 06:50:14.558 align:start position:0%
minor tweaks but their significant
 
06:50:14.558 --> 06:50:15.670 align:start position:0%
minor tweaks but their significant
tweaks

06:50:15.670 --> 06:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
tweaks
 
06:50:19.270 --> 06:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
are being done so what we're gonna do is
 
06:50:20.948 --> 06:50:20.958 align:start position:0%
we're going to
 
06:50:23.270 --> 06:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
not act on part three here right now
 
06:50:25.270 --> 06:50:25.280 align:start position:0%
we're gonna jump to part four
 
06:50:27.830 --> 06:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
and do part five and come back to part
 
06:50:27.840 --> 06:50:30.548 align:start position:0%
and do part five and come back to part
three

06:50:30.548 --> 06:50:30.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:30.558 --> 06:50:32.070 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:50:32.070 --> 06:50:32.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:50:35.830 --> 06:50:35.840 align:start position:0%

from the department
 
06:51:33.200 --> 06:51:33.990 align:start position:0%
from the department
that

06:51:33.990 --> 06:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:51:36.708 --> 06:51:36.718 align:start position:0%
that should satisfy
 
06:51:37.860 --> 06:51:37.870 align:start position:0%
all the
 
06:51:37.870 --> 06:51:39.030 align:start position:0%
all the
[Music]

06:51:39.030 --> 06:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:51:42.628 --> 06:51:42.638 align:start position:0%
yoga studios and others um and that will
 
06:51:42.638 --> 06:51:44.230 align:start position:0%
yoga studios and others um and that will
exempt

06:51:44.230 --> 06:51:44.240 align:start position:0%
exempt
 
06:51:46.230 --> 06:51:46.240 align:start position:0%
entities having a gross tuition under
 
06:51:48.310 --> 06:51:48.320 align:start position:0%
100 000
 
06:51:50.788 --> 06:51:50.798 align:start position:0%
uh from having to do the
 
06:51:54.468 --> 06:51:54.478 align:start position:0%
surety bonds um but everyone else would
 
06:51:58.708 --> 06:51:58.718 align:start position:0%
still be required to uh perform that
 
06:52:00.788 --> 06:52:00.798 align:start position:0%
getting that bond
 
06:52:05.510 --> 06:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
so i think that this amendment satisfies
 
06:52:08.708 --> 06:52:08.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:11.990 --> 06:52:12.000 align:start position:0%

that
 
06:52:36.548 --> 06:52:36.558 align:start position:0%
this amendment does retain
 
06:52:39.110 --> 06:52:39.120 align:start position:0%
um uh part m
 
06:52:40.628 --> 06:52:40.638 align:start position:0%
is is good
 
06:52:44.070 --> 06:52:44.080 align:start position:0%

06:52:45.670 --> 06:52:45.680 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli said that it
 
06:52:47.990 --> 06:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
that it satisfies all of the the
 
06:52:50.070 --> 06:52:50.080 align:start position:0%
interests of the
 
06:52:52.548 --> 06:52:52.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:54.708 --> 06:52:54.718 align:start position:0%

a government affairs representative that
 
06:53:11.830 --> 06:53:11.840 align:start position:0%
that it in fact doesn't so so
 
06:53:14.548 --> 06:53:14.558 align:start position:0%
i would i would suggest that we leave
 
06:53:16.628 --> 06:53:16.638 align:start position:0%

06:53:33.510 --> 06:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:53:36.708 --> 06:53:36.718 align:start position:0%
uh i guess the the specific support for
 
06:53:40.628 --> 06:53:40.638 align:start position:0%
for both these uh pieces that was um put
 
06:53:43.190 --> 06:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
forward by senator ward
 
06:53:46.708 --> 06:53:46.718 align:start position:0%
uh as having a good you know basis for
 
06:53:52.468 --> 06:53:52.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:53.750 --> 06:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:53:53.760 --> 06:53:55.030 align:start position:0%
thank you
welcome

06:53:55.030 --> 06:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
06:53:59.350 --> 06:53:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:00.948 --> 06:54:00.958 align:start position:0%
yes i was wondering if someone could
 
06:54:03.430 --> 06:54:03.440 align:start position:0%
enlighten me as to why
 
06:54:06.070 --> 06:54:06.080 align:start position:0%
the second section is being removed i
 
06:54:08.548 --> 06:54:08.558 align:start position:0%
wasn't here to hear what the objections
 
06:54:23.510 --> 06:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:25.430 --> 06:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
right it was explained by the department
 
06:54:27.670 --> 06:54:27.680 align:start position:0%
and i asked a lot of questions about
 
06:54:27.680 --> 06:54:30.390 align:start position:0%
and i asked a lot of questions about
this

06:54:30.390 --> 06:54:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:33.590 --> 06:54:33.600 align:start position:0%
so one of it is it singles out
 
06:54:35.750 --> 06:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
particular businesses which we try not
 
06:54:36.708 --> 06:54:36.718 align:start position:0%
to do
 
06:54:38.868 --> 06:54:38.878 align:start position:0%
number two it doesn't actually say yoga
 
06:54:41.590 --> 06:54:41.600 align:start position:0%
even though that's what it's addressing
 
06:54:43.110 --> 06:54:43.120 align:start position:0%
number three
 
06:54:45.270 --> 06:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
even when i did talk to the yoga people
 
06:54:48.070 --> 06:54:48.080 align:start position:0%
they said yes the first one would
 
06:54:49.590 --> 06:54:49.600 align:start position:0%
actually take care of all of their
 
06:54:51.270 --> 06:54:51.280 align:start position:0%
people but they still wanted the second
 
06:54:52.468 --> 06:54:52.478 align:start position:0%
one in
 
06:54:55.430 --> 06:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
number four the department was afraid
 
06:54:58.468 --> 06:54:58.478 align:start position:0%
that with this wording it would actually
 
06:55:00.868 --> 06:55:00.878 align:start position:0%
um capture some people that we didn't
 
06:55:02.868 --> 06:55:02.878 align:start position:0%
want captured
 
06:55:05.670 --> 06:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
um and would make it broader and apply
 
06:55:08.390 --> 06:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
to more than the intent
 
06:55:11.590 --> 06:55:11.600 align:start position:0%
and he was not comfortable with section
 
06:55:13.510 --> 06:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
m and was much happier
 
06:55:16.070 --> 06:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
taking it out and leaving m in
 
06:55:19.030 --> 06:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
and nobody could come up with anybody
 
06:55:24.548 --> 06:55:24.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:26.390 --> 06:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
can you tell me who he was that you just
 
06:55:26.400 --> 06:55:27.590 align:start position:0%
can you tell me who he was that you just
referenced

06:55:27.590 --> 06:55:27.600 align:start position:0%
referenced
 
06:55:30.468 --> 06:55:30.478 align:start position:0%
you said no i don't need the name
 
06:55:32.788 --> 06:55:32.798 align:start position:0%
what was the person representing
 
06:55:35.190 --> 06:55:35.200 align:start position:0%
department of education steve applewood
 
06:55:37.510 --> 06:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
thank you he's the one who's in charge
 
06:55:39.910 --> 06:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
of handling this stuff so
 
06:55:42.868 --> 06:55:42.878 align:start position:0%
it was his recommendation or his
 
06:55:44.310 --> 06:55:44.320 align:start position:0%
agreement to
 
06:55:46.390 --> 06:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
the my questions that yes he would
 
06:55:51.510 --> 06:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:53.990 --> 06:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
06:55:56.070 --> 06:55:56.080 align:start position:0%
any further representative cardelli yeah
 
06:55:59.670 --> 06:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
just uh i agree i my problem is that
 
06:56:03.190 --> 06:56:03.200 align:start position:0%
this creates a special class of business
 
06:56:05.750 --> 06:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
and us and uh
 
06:56:07.510 --> 06:56:07.520 align:start position:0%

section that i don't see
 
06:57:51.680 --> 06:57:52.548 align:start position:0%
section that i don't see
no

06:57:52.548 --> 06:57:52.558 align:start position:0%
no
 
06:57:59.830 --> 06:57:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:01.670 --> 06:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
amendment relative to environmental
 
06:58:03.350 --> 06:58:03.360 align:start position:0%
science and outdoor recreation as
 
06:58:07.110 --> 06:58:07.120 align:start position:0%
criteria for inadequate education
 
06:58:15.190 --> 06:58:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:17.110 --> 06:58:17.120 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
06:58:19.270 --> 06:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i move that we adopt
 
06:58:21.270 --> 06:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
amendment 1584 each with a
 
06:58:23.430 --> 06:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
recommendation about the pass
 
06:58:31.510 --> 06:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:34.310 --> 06:58:34.320 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
06:58:36.230 --> 06:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
motion was made by
 
06:58:38.468 --> 06:58:38.478 align:start position:0%
on the past this amendment uh
 
06:58:40.548 --> 06:58:40.558 align:start position:0%
representative leon and second by
 
06:58:43.030 --> 06:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
represent baum uh represent leon do you
 
06:58:45.910 --> 06:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
have any pros of wisdom for us
 
06:58:47.990 --> 06:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair i hope that
 
06:58:49.670 --> 06:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
they're pearls and not just pieces of
 
06:58:49.680 --> 06:58:51.030 align:start position:0%
they're pearls and not just pieces of
sand

06:58:51.030 --> 06:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
sand
 
06:58:52.708 --> 06:58:52.718 align:start position:0%
which is important to the environment by
 
06:58:53.830 --> 06:58:53.840 align:start position:0%
the way
 
06:58:55.750 --> 06:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
so this amendment takes out what would
 
06:58:58.150 --> 06:58:58.160 align:start position:0%
just be section law and while it does
 
06:59:00.310 --> 06:59:00.320 align:start position:0%
give a nice narrative putting things
 
06:59:02.628 --> 06:59:02.638 align:start position:0%
into section law it doesn't look around
 
06:59:05.910 --> 06:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
and so it doesn't make sense
 
06:59:07.830 --> 06:59:07.840 align:start position:0%
uh when we get down to the criteria for
 
06:59:09.510 --> 06:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
inadequate education
 
06:59:11.910 --> 06:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
um it amends it to say including
 
06:59:13.910 --> 06:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
environmental sciences that investigate
 
06:59:15.830 --> 06:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
the complex interaction of physical
 
06:59:18.070 --> 06:59:18.080 align:start position:0%
chemical and biological processes that
 
06:59:20.310 --> 06:59:20.320 align:start position:0%
take place on the earth and that second
 
06:59:21.750 --> 06:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
section adopts the language that's
 
06:59:23.750 --> 06:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
already been passed in uh one of our
 
06:59:25.910 --> 06:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
other bills i believe in 242 but it's
 
06:59:27.590 --> 06:59:27.600 align:start position:0%
been a long thing
 
06:59:29.110 --> 06:59:29.120 align:start position:0%
when we look to those
 
06:59:30.230 --> 06:59:30.240 align:start position:0%
we've discovered we've wrote in
 
06:59:31.670 --> 06:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
committee many times about the
 
06:59:34.150 --> 06:59:34.160 align:start position:0%
integration of skills and knowledge and
 
06:59:36.070 --> 06:59:36.080 align:start position:0%
being able to bring together these
 
06:59:38.390 --> 06:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
different areas of science in order to
 
06:59:40.868 --> 06:59:40.878 align:start position:0%
understand the greater world around us
 
06:59:43.030 --> 06:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
is beneficial to the students knowledge
 
06:59:45.670 --> 06:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
and beneficial to our society so that
 
06:59:48.548 --> 06:59:48.558 align:start position:0%
that change of both that focus gets to
 
06:59:50.628 --> 06:59:50.638 align:start position:0%
the actual core of respecting and
 
06:59:53.670 --> 06:59:53.680 align:start position:0%
understanding the world around us
 
06:59:55.910 --> 06:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
when we get to section 2 here that is
 
06:59:58.310 --> 06:59:58.320 align:start position:0%
the part that is amending the criteria
 
07:00:00.548 --> 07:00:00.558 align:start position:0%
for science to include outdoor
 
07:00:01.990 --> 07:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
recreation with actually sorry i
 
07:00:03.990 --> 07:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
apologize it's already there
 
07:00:06.468 --> 07:00:06.478 align:start position:0%
and in uh section seven
 
07:00:08.868 --> 07:00:08.878 align:start position:0%
it it discusses the need to communicate
 
07:00:10.548 --> 07:00:10.558 align:start position:0%
and participate effectively in a change
 
07:00:13.190 --> 07:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
in society and environment because as

don't know how to do this take personal
 
07:04:04.708 --> 07:04:04.718 align:start position:0%
privilege but i wanted to apologize
 
07:04:08.468 --> 07:04:08.478 align:start position:0%
um i when i we were working on sb 44
 
07:04:08.478 --> 07:04:09.590 align:start position:0%
um i when i we were working on sb 44
earlier

07:04:09.590 --> 07:04:09.600 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
07:04:11.350 --> 07:04:11.360 align:start position:0%
i mentioned that the school board
 
07:04:11.360 --> 07:04:18.628 align:start position:0%
i mentioned that the school board
association

07:04:18.628 --> 07:04:18.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:20.468 --> 07:04:20.478 align:start position:0%
and that's what i had on my handwritten
 
07:04:23.110 --> 07:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
notes but as often happens when i'm
 
07:04:24.868 --> 07:04:24.878 align:start position:0%
trying to let people in and out of
 
07:04:26.788 --> 07:04:26.798 align:start position:0%

07:04:31.510 --> 07:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
the notes
 
07:04:33.110 --> 07:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
uh the minutes from that meeting and in
 
07:04:35.750 --> 07:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
fact there was no uh statement from the
 
07:04:37.750 --> 07:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
school board association so i just
 
07:04:43.590 --> 07:04:43.600 align:start position:0%
