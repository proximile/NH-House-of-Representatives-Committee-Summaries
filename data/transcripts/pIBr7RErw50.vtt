headcount of individuals uh in our
 
00:09:11.069 --> 00:09:11.079 align:start position:0%
tobacco program uh number of the people
 
00:09:13.269 --> 00:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
in in that program uh which is focused
 
00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:15.240 align:start position:0%
on Tobacco asthma and cancer are
 
00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:16.680 align:start position:0%
actually funded by multiple funding
 
00:09:18.829 --> 00:09:18.839 align:start position:0%
sources so I'll have to to go back and
 
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:20.320 align:start position:0%
get back to you with the exact number of
 
00:09:22.829 --> 00:09:22.839 align:start position:0%
people specifically dedicated to Tobacco
 
00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:25.240 align:start position:0%
activities most of them are uh
 
00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
programmatic staff so they're program
 
00:09:29.509 --> 00:09:29.519 align:start position:0%
staff uh who may have any number of
 
00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:30.720 align:start position:0%
backgrounds they may have medical
 
00:09:33.509 --> 00:09:33.519 align:start position:0%
background they may have a background in
 
00:09:35.509 --> 00:09:35.519 align:start position:0%
um Public Health uh Masters in public
 
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
health or other uh Masters train level
 
00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
training and then experience uh in the
 
00:09:42.509 --> 00:09:42.519 align:start position:0%
field uh working in whether nonprofits
 
00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:44.440 align:start position:0%
or other people uh focused on smoking
 
00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
cation or other chronic disease
 
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:52.240 align:start position:0%
work all right followup uh so so I I I
 
00:09:54.389 --> 00:09:54.399 align:start position:0%
don't mind you not having the answer to
 
00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:56.680 align:start position:0%
today because it's a surprise but uh
 
00:09:59.630 --> 00:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
when you if you would email it to me uh
 
00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:02.200 align:start position:0%
I would like to know what you think the
 
00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:04.160 align:start position:0%
actual headcount is that would be
 
00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:06.760 align:start position:0%
attributable to this program and what
 
00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:11.079 align:start position:0%
the the job skill requirements are for
 
00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
for these and then um I think it's been
 
00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:17.200 align:start position:0%
a decade at least that every time this
 
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
program comes up we uh somebody will ask
 
00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
about metrics how do we know that this
 
00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
is money well spent what what metrics do
 
00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:29.839 align:start position:0%
you use to to monitor success of this
 
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:32.680 align:start position:0%
program sure um and so I'll thank my
 
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
colleague Nathan uh was able to pull up
 
00:10:35.829 --> 00:10:35.839 align:start position:0%
our our budget for the specific program
 
00:10:39.269 --> 00:10:39.279 align:start position:0%
so we do have five uh FTE assigned to uh
 
00:10:41.389 --> 00:10:41.399 align:start position:0%
the tobacco program specifically in this
 
00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:43.480 align:start position:0%
Au so the the answer to that one is five
 
00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:46.120 align:start position:0%
in terms of the evaluation of programs
 
00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:48.200 align:start position:0%
we we use a variety of criteria where we
 
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
have the Quit Line um obviously the
 
00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:52.200 align:start position:0%
number of users and and people incoming
 
00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
calls and people referred to to quit
 
00:10:56.269 --> 00:10:56.279 align:start position:0%
services or smoking cation Services
 
00:10:58.430 --> 00:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
would be one metric uh generally it's
 
00:11:00.269 --> 00:11:00.279 align:start position:0%
number of people that are accessing the
 
00:11:02.269 --> 00:11:02.279 align:start position:0%
programs and then those people's uh
 
00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:05.000 align:start position:0%
referrals into smoking sensation uh and
 
00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:07.000 align:start position:0%
other programs in terms of outcomes of
 
00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
those programs we do work where there
 
00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
are vendors involved we we work with
 
00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:11.800 align:start position:0%
those vendors to ensure people are
 
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
staying in the program duration of
 
00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
services you know ensuring that they're
 
00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:17.160 align:start position:0%
getting into a program and then also
 
00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:18.680 align:start position:0%
staying until the services are having an
 
00:11:20.269 --> 00:11:20.279 align:start position:0%
effect on their behaviors and helping
 
00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:21.320 align:start position:0%
them quit
 
00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:24.200 align:start position:0%
smoking okay so and that same email
 
00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:26.680 align:start position:0%
could you send me the metrics what what
 
00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
what the standard is and and how we're
 
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:31.600 align:start position:0%

00:13:02.509 --> 00:13:02.519 align:start position:0%
word but uh authorities under which
 
00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:03.880 align:start position:0%
different refugees have come in from
 
00:13:05.389 --> 00:13:05.399 align:start position:0%
different places over the past numbers
 
00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
of years and you were very good and ask
 
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
you specifically about some of them
 
00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:12.160 align:start position:0%
Haitians in Venezuelans and you g gave a
 
00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
great response which I really appreciate
 
00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
what I'd like to request is that this
 
00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
become part of the DHHS dashboard where
 
00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
you actually have all of the different
 
00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
categories under which refugees are
 
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
considered to be um legally here lack of
 
00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:32.360 align:start position:0%
better a word and an indication of which
 
00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:35.480 align:start position:0%
one it is and what year it was as as in
 
00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
the document that I provided you you
 
00:13:39.389 --> 00:13:39.399 align:start position:0%
know what year that permission if you
 
00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:41.560 align:start position:0%
will was granted um and for how long
 
00:13:44.509 --> 00:13:44.519 align:start position:0%
it's uh for and under what categories
 
00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:46.360 align:start position:0%
because you actually Drew out a number
 
00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
of categories um you mentioned
 
00:13:50.949 --> 00:13:50.959 align:start position:0%
humanitarian parole you mentioned the O
 
00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
which is what this is about you talked
 
00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:54.440 align:start position:0%
about the um the TPS which is what I was
 
00:13:58.389 --> 00:13:58.399 align:start position:0%
asking about and then by child versus
 
00:14:01.389 --> 00:14:01.399 align:start position:0%
adult and by by gender um as well so
 
00:14:03.949 --> 00:14:03.959 align:start position:0%
that we can actually see who is the
 
00:14:05.749 --> 00:14:05.759 align:start position:0%
number the numbers not the people the
 
00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
numbers of people that are coming in um
 
00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:10.040 align:start position:0%
and under what Authority they have come
 
00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
in is that something that you could um
 
00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:24.389 --> 00:14:24.399 align:start position:0%
dashboards thank you uh representative
 
00:14:28.389 --> 00:14:28.399 align:start position:0%
we have some of that data but not all of
 
00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
that data so some of those categories so
 
00:14:36.949 --> 00:14:36.959 align:start position:0%
the program serves refugees humanitarian
 
00:14:36.959 --> 00:14:38.590 align:start position:0%
the program serves refugees humanitarian

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:38.600 align:start position:0%

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:40.749 align:start position:0%

amarian SIV holders Afghans and Iraqis
 
00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
and uh those who are under the
 
00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:50.680 align:start position:0%
conventions of torture and uh couple
 
00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:51.470 align:start position:0%
conventions of torture and uh couple
other

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:54.240 align:start position:0%
categories those were initiated by
 
00:14:55.949 --> 00:14:55.959 align:start position:0%
various acts whether it's the refugee
 
00:14:57.629 --> 00:14:57.639 align:start position:0%
Act of 1980 the immigration
 
00:14:59.470 --> 00:14:59.480 align:start position:0%
Naturalization Act I believe regions are
 
00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
governed by two separate acts as well
 
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
there's an act in the fiscal year Act of
 
00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:07.000 align:start position:0%
2008 I believe that governs the SIV so
 
00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:10.120 align:start position:0%
it varies humanitarian PE Le not all
 
00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
categories of humanitarian peoly are
 
00:15:16.509 --> 00:15:16.519 align:start position:0%
eligible for or benefits and services
 
00:15:19.069 --> 00:15:19.079 align:start position:0%
and who is eligible actually changes and
 
00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
some who are eligible will also change
 
00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
for example uh Afghans are no longer uh
 
00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
if they were to come over eligible as
 
00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:28.120 align:start position:0%
humanitarian proles ukrainians have
 
00:15:30.749 --> 00:15:30.759 align:start position:0%
changed depending on uh what Congress
 
00:15:33.949 --> 00:15:33.959 align:start position:0%
has passed so uh those things uh may
 
00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:38.440 align:start position:0%
change uh we do not provide and release
 
00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
publicly uh data based on uh sex
 
00:15:44.309 --> 00:15:44.319 align:start position:0%
assigned at Birth
 
00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
gender and uh release those for privacy
 
00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
and safety reasons of our clientele we
 
00:15:56.309 --> 00:15:56.319 align:start position:0%
can provide data
 
00:15:59.790 --> 00:15:59.800 align:start position:0%
on nationality which we do
 
00:16:02.389 --> 00:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
and by year as well so we are happy to
 
00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:05.800 align:start position:0%
provide that to you and we can provide
 
00:16:09.069 --> 00:16:09.079 align:start position:0%
data for example on humanitarian peoes
 
00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:12.920 align:start position:0%
versus refugees if you would
 
00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:16.160 align:start position:0%
like yes um and I'll point out you
 
00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned law which is great but some of
 
00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:22.120 align:start position:0%
these are not under law they're under I
 
00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know what it's called when
 
00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
the D when DHHS basically just says
 
00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:28.240 align:start position:0%
we're going to let in the Venezuelans
 
00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:31.230 align:start position:0%
we're going to let in the Venezuelans
now

00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:31.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:33.160 align:start position:0%
but you have that distinction as well so
 
00:16:34.949 --> 00:16:34.959 align:start position:0%
I'm just looking for that that as well
 
00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:38.120 align:start position:0%
and why can't you include the numbers of
 
00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:40.360 align:start position:0%
peoples I'm not asking about the people
 
00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:43.110 align:start position:0%
peoples I'm not asking about the people
themselves

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:45.829 --> 00:16:45.839 align:start position:0%
obviously this is not data that we have
 
00:16:48.949 --> 00:16:48.959 align:start position:0%
ever tracked nor that we do release
 
00:16:53.389 --> 00:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
publicly and we do it typically there is
 
00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:56.240 align:start position:0%
uh small numbers of folks and we do not
 
00:16:59.430 --> 00:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
release it publicly for uh both privacy
 
00:17:02.309 --> 00:17:02.319 align:start position:0%
and safety reasons of clients uh
 
00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
regarding uh versus in law so when you
 
00:17:07.789 --> 00:17:07.799 align:start position:0%
mentioned humanitarian paroles that is
 
00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
governed by the immigration
 
00:17:11.429 --> 00:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
Naturalization Act so that is not
 
00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
something that is uh
 
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.230 align:start position:0%
something that is uh
determined

00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:17.240 align:start position:0%
determined
 
00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:19.839 align:start position:0%
capriciously that is there is no one who
 
00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:23.160 align:start position:0%
has a temporary protective status that
 
00:17:25.669 --> 00:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
is solely given or our benefits and
 
00:17:27.909 --> 00:17:27.919 align:start position:0%
services to say another way just because
 
00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
you have TPS you would not be eligible
 
00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
program follow so from your response in
 
00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:38.600 align:start position:0%
the the written response I understood
 
00:17:39.789 --> 00:17:39.799 align:start position:0%
that but does that mean you're not
 
00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:42.440 align:start position:0%
eligible for any program of the state or
 
00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:45.990 align:start position:0%
eligible for any program of the state or
federal

00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
government TPS and work authorization
 
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
may make you eligible for Medicaid in
 
00:17:56.789 --> 00:17:56.799 align:start position:0%
certain specific instances if you were a
 
00:17:59.669 --> 00:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
pregnant person and a
 
00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
child however there
 
00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
are not for o benefits and
 
00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:11.080 align:start position:0%
services okay hi sorry representative if
 
00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:13.640 align:start position:0%
I could just chime into I think um just
 
00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:15.640 align:start position:0%
to add on to what Ruben saying again the
 
00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:18.200 align:start position:0%
federal government heavily prescribes
 
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
who and when they can receive the
 
00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
services and offered by the refugee
 
00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
resettlement funds and so we we don't
 
00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
decide that in this state who and who's
 
00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
to receive the services the federal
 
00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
government does and so therefore as
 
00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
Ruben was saying just one run criteria
 
00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:38.600 align:start position:0%
does not necessarily correlate with the
 
00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:40.720 align:start position:0%
ability to receive the funding or
 
00:18:42.669 --> 00:18:42.679 align:start position:0%
Services by the funding from o at the
 
00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:44.440 align:start position:0%
federal government and then I just
 
00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:46.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to add as far as the dashboard
 
00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:47.960 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll take that back and whatever
 
00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
information we can publicly share in the
 
00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:53.400 align:start position:0%
way in which you know works for you and
 
00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
and the committee we will but there are
 
00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
we do have restrictions to protect
 
00:18:58.430 --> 00:18:58.440 align:start position:0%
privacy so there's just some data we
 
00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
can't share in the way that you may be
 
00:19:01.669 --> 00:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
asking but we'll take that back and look
 
00:19:03.149 --> 00:19:03.159 align:start position:0%
at what we can and and bring it back to
 
00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
you for the record would you identify
 
00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:07.640 align:start position:0%
yourself oh I'm so sorry and Landry
 
00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:09.880 align:start position:0%
associate commissioner thank you I
 
00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:13.000 align:start position:0%
apologize I am upset that privacy takes
 
00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
place over
 
00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
safety the public always wants to know
 
00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:18.640 align:start position:0%
how many of these people have come into
 
00:19:20.789 --> 00:19:20.799 align:start position:0%
our state and we are unable to give them
 
00:19:23.789 --> 00:19:23.799 align:start position:0%
that number and all this privacy is
 
00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
blocking that number that's not right we
 
00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:28.280 align:start position:0%
have a right to know how many refugees
 
00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:30.360 align:start position:0%
have been sent into our state by the
 
00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:32.840 align:start position:0%
federal government that should be known
 
00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:34.600 align:start position:0%
by you and it should be able to be given
 
00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:35.510 align:start position:0%
by you and it should be able to be given
to

00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:38.360 align:start position:0%
us if I may respond representative wer
 
00:19:40.549 --> 00:19:40.559 align:start position:0%
we can share the numbers of refugees
 
00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
coming into the state through by origin
 
00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:45.400 align:start position:0%
of country through the refugee
 
00:19:47.149 --> 00:19:47.159 align:start position:0%
resettlement program what we can't share
 
00:19:52.549 --> 00:19:52.559 align:start position:0%
necessarily is by gender or by um by age
 
00:19:54.789 --> 00:19:54.799 align:start position:0%
in in areas because the numbers may be
 
00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:57.200 align:start position:0%
so small that that may be identifiable
 
00:19:59.669 --> 00:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
in certain locations but we absolutely
 
00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:02.200 align:start position:0%
can share the numbers coming in we could
 
00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:04.600 align:start position:0%
have a 100 Venezuelan gang members but
 
00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
we're not allowed to know there were so
 
00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
many between the ages of 16 and
 
00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
20 male U Mr that doesn't seem correct
 
00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:15.400 align:start position:0%
Mr chair maybe this conversation might
 
00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:18.520 align:start position:0%
be better uh if you and I got together
 
00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
with HHS and discussed this
 
00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:24.640 align:start position:0%
offline thank you but we do need more
 
00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:26.360 align:start position:0%
information the public wants it and
 
00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
they're not being provided move the item
 
00:20:32.669 --> 00:20:32.679 align:start position:0%
motion to accept the item
 
00:20:35.909 --> 00:20:35.919 align:start position:0%
second further discussion seeing none
 
00:20:40.789 --> 00:20:40.799 align:start position:0%
all in favor say I I motion is item is
 
00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
adopted okay nobody's opposed no one's
 
00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:56.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:00.029 --> 00:21:00.039 align:start position:0%
seven move to item number 40 4
 
00:21:01.789 --> 00:21:01.799 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human
 
00:21:03.909 --> 00:21:03.919 align:start position:0%
Services representative Edwards has
 
00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question um thank you
 
00:21:09.669 --> 00:21:09.679 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chair and uh thank you good
 
00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
morning I um I'm taking a look at this
 
00:21:16.669 --> 00:21:16.679 align:start position:0%
and uh I'm a little uh confused by it in
 
00:21:20.269 --> 00:21:20.279 align:start position:0%
that it appears that this program has an
 
00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:24.200 align:start position:0%
exceptionally High overhead to um
 
00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
Services ratio this this looks to be to
 
00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
me um about for for
 
00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
$1.2 of overhead we're going to spend $5
 
00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
on services and so I'm I think I must be
 
00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding this and I'd like you
 
00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:44.480 align:start position:0%
to clarify because it's they an
 
00:21:47.669 --> 00:21:47.679 align:start position:0%
outrageous ratio if that's true yes
 
00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
thank you uh for the question I'm
 
00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
Melissa Hardy I'm the division director
 
00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:53.960 align:start position:0%
for long-term supports and services um
 
00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
so right now MF Money Follows the person
 
00:21:58.990 --> 00:21:59.000 align:start position:0%
or mfp is a demonstration project so
 
00:22:01.669 --> 00:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
right now we are uh we have two
 
00:22:05.029 --> 00:22:05.039 align:start position:0%
full-time employees one a a program
 
00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:07.880 align:start position:0%
director and a data analyst we're adding
 
00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:10.200 align:start position:0%
we're asking to add three temporary
 
00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:12.520 align:start position:0%
full-time positions in order to get the
 
00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:15.400 align:start position:0%
program up and running um where we see
 
00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
our return is when we have um
 
00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:19.880 align:start position:0%
individuals who are transitioning out of
 
00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
Nursing Facility placement and back into
 
00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
the community because of the cost um of
 
00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
Nursing Facility placement is
 
00:22:29.149 --> 00:22:29.159 align:start position:0%
significantly higher than um people
 
00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
living in the community so we're looking
 
00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:32.600 align:start position:0%
at um about
 
00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
$70,000 per person to live in a nursing
 
00:22:39.029 --> 00:22:39.039 align:start position:0%
facility and about $25,000 per person
 
00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
when somebody is on CFI or transitioning
 
00:22:42.909 --> 00:22:42.919 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:46.120 align:start position:0%
community and um good morning Nathan Way
 
00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:49.000 align:start position:0%
Chief Financial Officer uh and and I I
 
00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
just want to also add in addition to
 
00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:53.080 align:start position:0%
that this is not the only account where
 
00:22:55.149 --> 00:22:55.159 align:start position:0%
the services are budgeted there is an
 
00:22:56.909 --> 00:22:56.919 align:start position:0%
additional account and I can provide
 
00:22:58.909 --> 00:22:58.919 align:start position:0%
that information to you so you can have
 
00:23:00.669 --> 00:23:00.679 align:start position:0%
the full picture because just with this
 
00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:02.120 align:start position:0%
item you're not able to see that cuz
 
00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:04.200 align:start position:0%
that other account isn't affected by
 
00:23:05.909 --> 00:23:05.919 align:start position:0%
this request
 
00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
and follow up all right thank thank you
 
00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
for that that that's reassuring uh is
 
00:23:14.789 --> 00:23:14.799 align:start position:0%
this since this is a demo project
 
00:23:19.669 --> 00:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
um have you had it accepted into the
 
00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
agency budget is this is this uh an
 
00:23:25.789 --> 00:23:25.799 align:start position:0%
established program now within the the
 
00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:35.720 align:start position:0%
now so
 
00:23:40.029 --> 00:23:40.039 align:start position:0%
um we budgeted a portion of this program
 
00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:42.200 align:start position:0%
however um we will need to come forward
 
00:23:44.909 --> 00:23:44.919 align:start position:0%
with a change request at some point
 
00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
during the either the governor's house
 
00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:49.240 align:start position:0%
or Senate phase of the budget process to
 
00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
add the additional federal funds so that
 
00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:53.000 align:start position:0%
we don't have to come back through
 
00:23:56.190 --> 00:23:56.200 align:start position:0%
fiscal uh in state fiscal year 26 so
 
00:23:57.549 --> 00:23:57.559 align:start position:0%
there will be some additional federal
 
00:23:59.430 --> 00:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
funds to be added to the original agency
 
00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:04.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:07.190 align:start position:0%
 
asking

00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
asking
 
00:24:08.909 --> 00:24:08.919 align:start position:0%
representative thank you thank you for
 
00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:10.720 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I just want to
 
00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
confirm that the hsri report when it's
 
00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:15.480 align:start position:0%
available hopefully next month uh will
 
00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:17.480 align:start position:0%
be made available to LBA so they can let
 
00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:20.840 align:start position:0%
us know yes and and a second one I asked
 
00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:23.000 align:start position:0%
you about the UNH it sounded like it was
 
00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
supposed to be a report um but you
 
00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
didn't specifically answer whether that
 
00:24:29.549 --> 00:24:29.559 align:start position:0%
was going to be provided to the public
 
00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:32.200 align:start position:0%
to us or if it was something else yes it
 
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
can be provided we could we can do that
 
00:24:36.029 --> 00:24:36.039 align:start position:0%
but it's also an ongoing um
 
00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
collaboration with them as we get our
 
00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:40.520 align:start position:0%
operational protocol approved so um we
 
00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:43.000 align:start position:0%
can share what we currently have um from
 
00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
UNH but it will be evolving as we um get
 
00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:49.000 align:start position:0%
approval from CMS for our operational
 
00:24:50.789 --> 00:24:50.799 align:start position:0%
protocol that'd be great and I assume
 
00:24:52.029 --> 00:24:52.039 align:start position:0%
there's some progress we made since this
 
00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
actually originated a couple years ago
 
00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:57.600 align:start position:0%

00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:00.070 align:start position:0%

Edwards had a question uh thank you Mr
 
00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
chair thank you Mr commissioner um this
 
00:26:07.269 --> 00:26:07.279 align:start position:0%
is U this is probably something that you
 
00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
you would do routinely um but I'm just
 
00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
verifying it that um project one on this
 
00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
uh program or this request is to conduct
 
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
a study and produce a report on the
 
00:26:22.669 --> 00:26:22.679 align:start position:0%
current status of access to Women's
 
00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
Health Services in the state existing
 
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
impediments to access and ways to
 
00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:29.080 align:start position:0%
improve access
 
00:26:33.549 --> 00:26:33.559 align:start position:0%
and I I want to think that DHHS has been
 
00:26:37.149 --> 00:26:37.159 align:start position:0%
maintaining such a report and I'm I I
 
00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:39.640 align:start position:0%
just would like to make sure that we're
 
00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:42.440 align:start position:0%
leveraging what we know between multiple
 
00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:44.720 align:start position:0%
departments and not just because we have
 
00:26:46.909 --> 00:26:46.919 align:start position:0%
Federal money we're going to take a make
 
00:26:49.669 --> 00:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
a fresh report i' I'd like to get some
 
00:26:51.669 --> 00:26:51.679 align:start position:0%
Synergy there no absolutely and there'll
 
00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
be an opportunity for us to collaborate
 
00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:55.240 align:start position:0%
with health and human services in fact I
 
00:26:56.389 --> 00:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
think we've already received some
 
00:26:59.070 --> 00:26:59.080 align:start position:0%
corresponden from them on some ideas
 
00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
that they have and information that they
 
00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:02.240 align:start position:0%
would like to share what we're
 
00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:05.000 align:start position:0%
specifically going to look at are the
 
00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:07.240 align:start position:0%
topics that you cited as it pertains to
 
00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
Commercial Insurance because obviously
 
00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
that is where our Focus as a department
 
00:27:13.909 --> 00:27:13.919 align:start position:0%
is so it's going to be through that lens
 
00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
that that work will be
 
00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:19.000 align:start position:0%
conducted and when you have that report
 
00:27:20.909 --> 00:27:20.919 align:start position:0%
you'll obviously it'll be available for
 
00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:23.320 align:start position:0%
DHS for okay all right thank you every
 
00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
everything done under this grant will in
 
00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:28.360 align:start position:0%
some way shape or form be public okay I
 
00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:30.200 align:start position:0%
I I thought it was that I just wanted to
 
00:27:33.029 --> 00:27:33.039 align:start position:0%
verify thank
 
00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:36.440 align:start position:0%

sir I'd like to uh bring up uh 398 the
 
00:29:47.669 --> 00:29:47.679 align:start position:0%
DHHS operating

00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:08.320 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm looking at um the YDC
 
00:30:10.789 --> 00:30:10.799 align:start position:0%
statistics uh on the average daily
 
00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:15.320 align:start position:0%
census uh on table six and uh in the
 
00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:18.640 align:start position:0%
last couple months or so there's there's
 
00:30:22.149 --> 00:30:22.159 align:start position:0%
been a request to have kind of a public
 
00:30:25.789 --> 00:30:25.799 align:start position:0%
review uh uh or public facing review of
 
00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
the procedures that we're going to use
 
00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
at the Youth Development Center to
 
00:30:33.149 --> 00:30:33.159 align:start position:0%
manage the census so that so that when
 
00:30:36.389 --> 00:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
we get to 12 people are are aware of it
 
00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
in advance when we go from 12 to 18 we
 
00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
start to implement some kind of active
 
00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:45.640 align:start position:0%
procedures to keep it under 18 then when
 
00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
we go over 18 uh and so so as I'm
 
00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:51.240 align:start position:0%
looking at these census numbers and
 
00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:55.240 align:start position:0%
we're in that sort of red range of 16 um
 
00:30:58.509 --> 00:30:58.519 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm curious what the status is of
 
00:31:00.789 --> 00:31:00.799 align:start position:0%
uh sharing the procedures that'll be
 
00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:05.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
census thank you for the question so
 
00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:10.480 align:start position:0%
there was there has been uh meetings uh
 
00:31:12.629 --> 00:31:12.639 align:start position:0%
with I'll answer that Lori Weaver
 
00:31:15.389 --> 00:31:15.399 align:start position:0%
commissioner Health Human Services um as
 
00:31:17.389 --> 00:31:17.399 align:start position:0%
we've been talking about engaging all of
 
00:31:19.909 --> 00:31:19.919 align:start position:0%
the uh stakeholders that touch every
 
00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
part of that system if you will and
 
00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
working to address that so I believe in
 
00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the month there was a a
 
00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
gathering looking at all of that part of
 
00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
the the mo there is to look at the the
 
00:31:36.789 --> 00:31:36.799 align:start position:0%
processes that we use to keep divert
 
00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:39.880 align:start position:0%
kids out of the JJ system um and using a
 
00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:41.480 align:start position:0%
similar model so you have a lot of the
 
00:31:44.269 --> 00:31:44.279 align:start position:0%
same players in the JJ system also
 
00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
working to tackle so that's jpos that's
 
00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
judges that's law enforcement that's
 
00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:51.320 align:start position:0%
Community that's other departments so
 
00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:53.080 align:start position:0%
that that work is in progress right now
 
00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
with the goal of really being able to
 
00:31:58.110 --> 00:31:58.120 align:start position:0%
make sure that kids get into to the
 
00:31:59.509 --> 00:31:59.519 align:start position:0%
right level of care and not so much to
 
00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
keep the census down right I mean
 
00:32:02.389 --> 00:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
ultimately you get the kids in the right
 
00:32:06.149 --> 00:32:06.159 align:start position:0%
level of care your census should be
 
00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
down okay and and then when when do you
 
00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
think that might be sharable when do you
 
00:32:12.629 --> 00:32:12.639 align:start position:0%
think you'll have enough of a cooked
 
00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
result on on what that process and
 
00:32:17.669 --> 00:32:17.679 align:start position:0%
methodology will look like to to start
 
00:32:19.669 --> 00:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
to share with maybe some of in the
 
00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:22.480 align:start position:0%
legislature and some in the advocacy
 
00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
Community I'm sure I'll I'll check with
 
00:32:26.149 --> 00:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
commissioner uh associate commissioner
 
00:32:28.509 --> 00:32:28.519 align:start position:0%
Tilly who's uh leading up that effort I
 
00:32:29.629 --> 00:32:29.639 align:start position:0%
I would think that they already have
 
00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:31.000 align:start position:0%
minutes from the work that they've done
 
00:32:32.549 --> 00:32:32.559 align:start position:0%
but in terms of a product of where
 
00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:34.200 align:start position:0%
they're at I would think within the next
 
00:32:36.629 --> 00:32:36.639 align:start position:0%
couple of months I think that's great
 
00:32:38.509 --> 00:32:38.519 align:start position:0%
that'd be fine two months would be fine
 
00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:41.960 align:start position:0%
and then I uh if I make switch to table
 
00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh eight which is um I think a good news
 
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
table and I'm just curious what you
 
00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
might attribute it to table eight I
 
00:32:54.669 --> 00:32:54.679 align:start position:0%
think shows a pretty substantial decline
 
00:32:58.149 --> 00:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
postco on use of the community Mental
 
00:32:58.159 --> 00:32:58.950 align:start position:0%
postco on use of the community Mental
Health

00:32:58.950 --> 00:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
Health
 
00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:02.720 align:start position:0%
Centers and uh and and so I I'm just
 
00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:05.240 align:start position:0%
curious if you've looked at that Trend
 
00:33:09.029 --> 00:33:09.039 align:start position:0%
and if there's any uh analysis that we
 
00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
might want to know about um related to
 
00:33:16.990 --> 00:33:17.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:19.269 --> 00:33:19.279 align:start position:0%
decline it would be dangerous for me to
 
00:33:21.870 --> 00:33:21.880 align:start position:0%
answer that alone without Kia Fox here
 
00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:23.480 align:start position:0%
so um if we could come back to that or
 
00:33:25.509 --> 00:33:25.519 align:start position:0%
follow up with you that that that' be
 
00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:28.600 align:start position:0%
that'd be fine uh and then if I could
 
00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
I'd like to Mr chair may I go to table
 
00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:35.320 align:start position:0%
11 yes uh table 11 um is a is also a
 
00:33:38.029 --> 00:33:38.039 align:start position:0%
nice chart that shows we have no DD
 
00:33:41.149 --> 00:33:41.159 align:start position:0%
waiting list and as I recall the DD
 
00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
waiting list whether the thing that
 
00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
determines whether or not there is a
 
00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
waiting list is if there are unfunded DD
 
00:33:54.029 --> 00:33:54.039 align:start position:0%
clients needing services and and so this
 
00:33:56.190 --> 00:33:56.200 align:start position:0%
I didn't say that very well but I think
 
00:33:58.830 --> 00:33:58.840 align:start position:0%
hopefully you know what I mean um what
 
00:34:01.029 --> 00:34:01.039 align:start position:0%
what this waiting list does not measure
 
00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:05.080 align:start position:0%
though is the number of people in the DD
 
00:34:07.669 --> 00:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
community that are awaiting services
 
00:34:09.629 --> 00:34:09.639 align:start position:0%
that are just not available that they
 
00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:11.800 align:start position:0%
are their their services would be fully
 
00:34:13.869 --> 00:34:13.879 align:start position:0%
funded so therefore they're not on the
 
00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
waiting list but because there's nobody
 
00:34:19.470 --> 00:34:19.480 align:start position:0%
available to provide them the services
 
00:34:22.349 --> 00:34:22.359 align:start position:0%
they're effectively not getting the care
 
00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:27.560 align:start position:0%
that we want to see happening so so is
 
00:34:29.950 --> 00:34:29.960 align:start position:0%
is is there is there another I think
 
00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:32.560 align:start position:0%
this is like a three-year-old topic
 
00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
where I've been asking for us to have
 
00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
what I would consider the true weight
 
00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
list which is the number of clients that
 
00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
have funding but for which we have a
 
00:34:50.909 --> 00:34:50.919 align:start position:0%
service shortfall and therefore no
 
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
Services thank you for the question I'm
 
00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
Melissa Hardy division director for
 
00:34:58.109 --> 00:34:58.119 align:start position:0%
long-term supports and services so we do
 
00:35:00.589 --> 00:35:00.599 align:start position:0%
um per your request at HHS oversight
 
00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
committee we do report out on the data
 
00:35:05.109 --> 00:35:05.119 align:start position:0%
that we do have as far as people who are
 
00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:07.960 align:start position:0%
funded but do not receive services and
 
00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
the reasons why so uh we get that
 
00:35:13.069 --> 00:35:13.079 align:start position:0%
information from our area agencies as
 
00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:15.640 align:start position:0%
far as if it's a lack of Staffing a lack
 
00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:18.280 align:start position:0%
of providers um if an individual didn't
 
00:35:21.069 --> 00:35:21.079 align:start position:0%
want to start services so um we're still
 
00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:23.800 align:start position:0%
in the process of since we had a large
 
00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
system change um Gathering all that data
 
00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
into one uh report that we could easily
 
00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
share out but I believe we're on the
 
00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
agenda for next week at HHS to um report
 
00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
out on the wait list that is excellent
 
00:35:39.310 --> 00:35:39.320 align:start position:0%
news thank you welcome and and then I
 
00:35:42.790 --> 00:35:42.800 align:start position:0%
have one more one more uh uh thank you
 
00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
so much I I don't know if this would be
 
00:35:47.470 --> 00:35:47.480 align:start position:0%
your question but um so I I forget the
 
00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:50.680 align:start position:0%
exact terminology of the of the effort
 
00:35:53.349 --> 00:35:53.359 align:start position:0%
um that you all have been undergoing on
 
00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
um getting the the um emergency rooms
 
00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:00.760 align:start position:0%
cleared of the mental health uh clients
 
00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
and project zero or something I think
 
00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:06.920 align:start position:0%
it's called um I'm wondering if um if if
 
00:36:08.950 --> 00:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
it might be appropriate to include in
 
00:36:11.309 --> 00:36:11.319 align:start position:0%
the stash board in the future where
 
00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
we're at with the number of of um people
 
00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
that are still awaiting services and are
 
00:36:20.829 --> 00:36:20.839 align:start position:0%
therefore unfortunately staged at in the
 
00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:23.240 align:start position:0%
eers sure it's called Mission zero just
 
00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:24.920 align:start position:0%
for the record Mission zero thank you
 
00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:27.160 align:start position:0%
Mission zero um we did include it so
 
00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
that Dash board has been up for quite a
 
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
while if you look at your uh cover page
 
00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
there is a link to that dashboard
 
00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:36.520 align:start position:0%
because it's updated daily with counts
 
00:36:38.349 --> 00:36:38.359 align:start position:0%
so if you look in that first parag uh
 
00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
second paragraph if you will there's a
 
00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:41.800 align:start position:0%
link that'll take you where you'll be
 
00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:44.240 align:start position:0%
able to see uh different facets of the
 
00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:46.200 align:start position:0%
data and how we break down those that
 
00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:48.680 align:start position:0%
are waiting that are actually in EDS or
 
00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
those that are um already uh have a
 
00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:54.040 align:start position:0%
placement that but are like such as uh
 
00:36:56.190 --> 00:36:56.200 align:start position:0%
the jail so so I actually knew that I
 
00:36:58.109 --> 00:36:58.119 align:start position:0%
was just giv you an opportunity need to
 
00:37:01.109 --> 00:37:01.119 align:start position:0%
brag okay how how well you guys are
 
00:37:06.109 --> 00:37:06.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:09.349 --> 00:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
sure representative lean I have
 
00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
something that's not on the
 
00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:13.400 align:start position:0%
miscellaneous but I think this will
 
00:37:15.829 --> 00:37:15.839 align:start position:0%
probably be the last meeting that we
 
00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:18.520 align:start position:0%
have as a group of fiscal uh and there
 
00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:20.440 align:start position:0%
are two people on the Senate side that I
 
00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
know that won't be coming back uh Jeb
 
00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
Bradley who I met back in the 90s when
 
00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
he was uh
 
00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
serving as the chair of Science and
 
00:37:33.589 --> 00:37:33.599 align:start position:0%
Technology in the house also the Ethics
 
00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
Committee um I have worked with Senator
 
00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
Bradley on like the New Hampshire Health
 
00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
protection plan um then I look at Lou
 
00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:43.880 align:start position:0%
alesandro that used to be a republican
 
00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:47.960 align:start position:0%
like I was and uh these two individuals
 
00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
have been lions in the state and I can't
 
00:37:53.309 --> 00:37:53.319 align:start position:0%
think of two individuals that have done
 
00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
more positive things for the State of
 
00:37:58.190 --> 00:37:58.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I know all of us are
 
00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:03.240 align:start position:0%

you over the years I I I must say that
 
00:38:53.829 --> 00:38:53.839 align:start position:0%
that it's been an honor to work with
 
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley and to work with members
 
00:38:59.589 --> 00:38:59.599 align:start position:0%
of the committee uh and to hear uh the
 
00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
quality of service that's presented by
 
00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
our commissioners and other individuals
 
00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
who come before us and to bring us
 
00:39:09.109 --> 00:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
information about how the government
 
00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
works and how efficient it is or or what
 
00:39:14.910 --> 00:39:14.920 align:start position:0%
I what our
 
00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:17.880 align:start position:0%
just what our inability is sometimes to
 
00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
do the kinds of things that the
 
00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
legislature wants you to do but
 
00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:21.990 align:start position:0%
legislature wants you to do but
generally

00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
generally
 
00:39:25.109 --> 00:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
speaking uh we should be very pleased at
 
00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
at at what's what's happened that uh I I
 
00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:30.680 align:start position:0%
want to just make one point and that's
 
00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
the the uh the the commissioner of of
 
00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
Revenue and and the job that that she
 
00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
has done with that department to bring
 
00:39:43.390 --> 00:39:43.400 align:start position:0%
in the the uh the rim system I think is
 
00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:45.240 align:start position:0%
Magnificent the fact that she's
 
00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
collecting money that was not collected
 
00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
in the in the past that money is being
 
00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:53.000 align:start position:0%
used to pay off a b debt that we don't
 
00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
have to appropriate General funds for
 
00:39:58.030 --> 00:39:58.040 align:start position:0%
they'll be paid for by the that's being
 
00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:00.760 align:start position:0%
ACR and it's things like that that make
 
00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
government work and we're we're so proud
 
00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:05.560 align:start position:0%
of in in terms of our ability to to
 
00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
manage that but we have we have a lot of
 
00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
problems and uh you know life is a
 
00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:12.680 align:start position:0%
series of problem solving exercises
 
00:40:16.270 --> 00:40:16.280 align:start position:0%
that's what life all about and um I've
 
00:40:18.109 --> 00:40:18.119 align:start position:0%
been here a long time Jeb's been here a
 
00:40:21.109 --> 00:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
long time and as we leave I I think the
 
00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:23.720 align:start position:0%
uh the situation is uh we hope things
 
00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:25.240 align:start position:0%
move in the right direction right that's
 
00:40:27.870 --> 00:40:27.880 align:start position:0%
what we all we all hope for
 
00:40:29.550 --> 00:40:29.560 align:start position:0%
because a lot of people are depending on
 
00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
all of the actions that take place in
 
00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:35.000 align:start position:0%
this legislative body and U the lives of
 
00:40:37.069 --> 00:40:37.079 align:start position:0%
people of the State of New Hampshire are
 
00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
what we're really concerned about that's
 
00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
why we come here that's why we serve
 
00:40:44.349 --> 00:40:44.359 align:start position:0%
here and hopefully when we when we leave
 
00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
it's better than it was when we came
 
00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
thank you br so uh Senator D always
 
00:40:54.190 --> 00:40:54.200 align:start position:0%
makes at a great American day and uh
 
00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
it's really been a pleasure to serve
 
00:40:58.109 --> 00:40:58.119 align:start position:0%
with Lou and I just want to
 
00:41:00.430 --> 00:41:00.440 align:start position:0%
um I was kind of joking about our old
 
00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:02.720 align:start position:0%
goat interview which everybody can come
 
00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:06.200 align:start position:0%
and and watch us um I think it's a 12:30
 
00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
right Lou in the third floor office but
 
00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
um both of us have worked with everybody
 
00:41:15.069 --> 00:41:15.079 align:start position:0%
in this room for years Peter thank you
 
00:41:18.069 --> 00:41:18.079 align:start position:0%
very much for your kind words um done a
 
00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
lot of good bipartison work some par
 
00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:24.200 align:start position:0%
ofon work um I remember Doug Hall
 
00:41:27.870 --> 00:41:27.880 align:start position:0%
telling me uh many years ago
 
00:41:31.109 --> 00:41:31.119 align:start position:0%
the most important trait of any
 
00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
legislator is when you disagree to
 
00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:36.640 align:start position:0%
always try to be agreeable and uh I
 
00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
think Lou you have uh epitomized that
 
00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
and um it's been a pleasure to work with
 
00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
you I also want to give Mike you a shout
 
00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:49.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:52.829 --> 00:41:52.839 align:start position:0%
um I had never sat on the finance
 
00:41:57.910 --> 00:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
committee until um this budget and
 
00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
um I just came to realize not only Mike
 
00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:05.599 align:start position:0%
but the entire LBA staff just does an
 
00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:10.520 align:start position:0%
exceptional job um and I think has made
 
00:42:13.630 --> 00:42:13.640 align:start position:0%
the budget process much more transparent
 
00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:17.880 align:start position:0%
explainable um and was really helpful
 
00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
and so I think that's uh vitally
 
00:42:22.549 --> 00:42:22.559 align:start position:0%
important and you also did a great job
 
00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
of training Nathan um who's done a great
 
00:42:29.349 --> 00:42:29.359 align:start position:0%
job with all of the HHS people that are
 
00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
here in the room today you're the
 
00:42:35.109 --> 00:42:35.119 align:start position:0%
largest Department in uh this great
 
00:42:37.510 --> 00:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
state and so many people depend on you
 
00:42:39.950 --> 00:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
and you manage the resources that you're
 
00:42:43.069 --> 00:42:43.079 align:start position:0%
given I think pretty eff effectively and
 
00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
efficiently um and that enables us
 
00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
to um provide services but do it at a in
 
00:42:54.670 --> 00:42:54.680 align:start position:0%
a rational basis and maintain our
 
00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
advantageous tax structure which is
 
00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
really important right L right if I
 
00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:04.640 align:start position:0%
could Mr chair but the the LBA the the
 
00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
LBA is just unbelievably unbelievably
 
00:43:12.270 --> 00:43:12.280 align:start position:0%
good and uh the young woman who answers
 
00:43:15.309 --> 00:43:15.319 align:start position:0%
the telephone when I call the NBA is is
 
00:43:19.950 --> 00:43:19.960 align:start position:0%
is the best the best and she's promising
 
00:43:21.790 --> 00:43:21.800 align:start position:0%
me that she's not going to retire she's
 
00:43:24.589 --> 00:43:24.599 align:start position:0%
going to hang in and keep pitching now I
 
00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
remember the LBA when Henry good ran the
 
00:43:30.829 --> 00:43:30.839 align:start position:0%
LBA now that goes back over 50 years ago
 
00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
that was my first trip to the office of
 
00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:35.400 align:start position:0%
the LBA when Henry good had the dark
 
00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:38.480 align:start position:0%
lights on was smoking in the office
 
00:43:41.549 --> 00:43:41.559 align:start position:0%
smoking his pipe or his cigar and this
 
00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
whole world was in a different different
 
00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
shape at that that time but I can't
 
00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:48.720 align:start position:0%

00:45:40.109 --> 00:45:40.119 align:start position:0%
effort I want to with the departure of
 
00:45:41.549 --> 00:45:41.559 align:start position:0%

the existing
 
00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:52.520 align:start position:0%
members excuse me that are returning uh
 
00:45:54.670 --> 00:45:54.680 align:start position:0%
to think about the way we did it during
 
00:45:57.790 --> 00:45:57.800 align:start position:0%
co uh that the link that you get with
 
00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
the agenda uh is very quick very easy to
 
00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
get back to the
 
00:46:06.589 --> 00:46:06.599 align:start position:0%
information uh even if someone has to
 
00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate the money to get you all a
 
00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:10.720 align:start position:0%
Chromebook or whatever it is that we
 
00:46:14.430 --> 00:46:14.440 align:start position:0%
would need to do that um we can we can
 
00:46:17.309 --> 00:46:17.319 align:start position:0%
actually save some money save some time
 
00:46:19.230 --> 00:46:19.240 align:start position:0%
um as long as you get a hard copy of
 
00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
that agenda to keep your notes on I
 
00:46:24.109 --> 00:46:24.119 align:start position:0%
think that is doable so give us some
 
00:46:27.589 --> 00:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
thought and uh you know the lb will be
 
00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
happy not to have to put these all
 
00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
together if uh if we get there already
 
00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
there we just get trained by
 
00:46:40.109 --> 00:46:40.119 align:start position:0%
