00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.220 align:start position:0%
chairman Roy members of the criminal
 
00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:07.259 align:start position:0%
justice committee I'm Grant bosse from
 
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Senate introducing
 
00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:11.220 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 130 on behalf of Senator
 
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
Darrell Abbas the Bill's Prime sponsor
 
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
this bill came from a request from the
 
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 align:start position:0%
judicial branch which is responsible for
 
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:19.500 align:start position:0%
ensuring the safety of all of New
 
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:21.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's courts the police standards
 
00:06:23.809 --> 00:06:23.819 align:start position:0%
and training Council has the expertise
 
00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:26.039 align:start position:0%
and infrastructure to provide high
 
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:27.900 align:start position:0%
quality training for law enforcement and
 
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:30.300 align:start position:0%
security officers but it currently lacks
 
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
authority under RSA 106-l to provide
 
00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:36.199 align:start position:0%
that training to court security officers
 
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:38.580 align:start position:0%
sb-130 would enable the police standards
 
00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:40.380 align:start position:0%
and training Council to enter into an
 
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:42.060 align:start position:0%
agreement at the request of Chief
 
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:44.580 align:start position:0%
Justice McDonald to Institute a court
 
00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:47.400 align:start position:0%
security officer education training and
 
00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:49.979 align:start position:0%
certification program this would allow
 
00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:51.479 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to standardize security
 
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
training across all our courts while
 
00:06:55.309 --> 00:06:55.319 align:start position:0%
preparing officers for the specific
 
00:06:57.409 --> 00:06:57.419 align:start position:0%
challenges of keeping our courthouses
 
00:06:59.270 --> 00:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
safe and secure if you have questions
 
00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:00.900 align:start position:0%
for Senator Abbas I'll make sure to get
 
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
you an answer but for today today I
 
00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:05.340 align:start position:0%
would defer to direct a Skipper and the
 
00:07:07.249 --> 00:07:07.259 align:start position:0%
judicial branch on the need for this
 
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
legislation Senator Abbas thanks you for

the room just in case there are any
 
00:08:00.529 --> 00:08:00.539 align:start position:0%
question Jason Jordan hazy is our
 
00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:03.300 align:start position:0%
manager of security operations so there
 
00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:05.160 align:start position:0%
may be if you have any questions that he
 
00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:07.500 align:start position:0%
may need to address he's available and
 
00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:09.780 align:start position:0%
director sipa of police standards and
 
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:12.360 align:start position:0%

are any questions that he may need to
 
00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:16.309 align:start position:0%
are any questions that he may need to
address

00:08:16.309 --> 00:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
address
 
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
um as Mr bossy said this is a request of
 
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
the ability that is the request of the
 
00:08:24.529 --> 00:08:24.539 align:start position:0%
judicial branch currently we have court
 
00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
security officers who manage all the
 
00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:29.160 align:start position:0%
security operations within our circuit
 
00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.249 align:start position:0%
security operations within our circuit
courts

00:08:30.249 --> 00:08:30.259 align:start position:0%
courts
 
00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:33.060 align:start position:0%
they train themselves so they develop
 
00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:34.500 align:start position:0%
their own training program they
 
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
Implement that training and they train
 
00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
themselves and as I've talked about many
 
00:08:41.269 --> 00:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
times before this committee one of our
 
00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:43.919 align:start position:0%
significant issues is resources
 
00:08:47.269 --> 00:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
so we're taking resources away from our
 
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
security Personnel whose job it is to
 
00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:52.140 align:start position:0%
provide security within our courthouses
 
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
and developing on an annual basis
 
00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
training for our court security officers
 
00:08:59.690 --> 00:08:59.700 align:start position:0%
and our sheriffs who are doing this
 
00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:01.500 align:start position:0%
court security within this in the
 
00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:02.940 align:start position:0%
Superior Courts
 
00:09:06.829 --> 00:09:06.839 align:start position:0%
and really that is a drain on really
 
00:09:09.769 --> 00:09:09.779 align:start position:0%
what it is is their primary focus the
 
00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
other aspect of of why we brought this
 
00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:14.820 align:start position:0%
bill forward is that
 
00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:15.829 align:start position:0%
bill forward is that
um

00:09:15.829 --> 00:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:18.180 align:start position:0%
we're in we're we're not professional
 
00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:19.860 align:start position:0%
trainers within our court security
 
00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:23.100 align:start position:0%
program we have individuals who are
 
00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:26.220 align:start position:0%
experts at providing court security but
 
00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:28.740 align:start position:0%
they are not sort of in their day-to-day
 
00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
business staying up to date on the
 
00:09:33.949 --> 00:09:33.959 align:start position:0%
latest training issues the latest sort
 
00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
of uh
 
00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:39.660 align:start position:0%
ways in which court security needs to be
 
00:09:42.829 --> 00:09:42.839 align:start position:0%
managed from a from a security basis so
 
00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:44.580 align:start position:0%
what we would like to do and what this
 
00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
bill does is simply is it simply
 
00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:49.860 align:start position:0%
provides an enabling statute to
 
00:09:51.889 --> 00:09:51.899 align:start position:0%
authorize police standards and training
 
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
to enter into an agreement with the
 
00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:56.100 align:start position:0%
judicial branch to be able to provide
 
00:09:59.690 --> 00:09:59.700 align:start position:0%
that level of training that we believe
 
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
is appropriate for court security
 
00:10:05.329 --> 00:10:05.339 align:start position:0%
officers into with the Chief Justice
 
00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:09.240 align:start position:0%
with Mr Jordan hazy the sheriffs and
 
00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:11.220 align:start position:0%
police standards and training developed
 
00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:13.260 align:start position:0%
that program sort of building off of our
 
00:10:15.829 --> 00:10:15.839 align:start position:0%
existing training program so what this
 
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
bill does is simply creates it simply
 
00:10:20.509 --> 00:10:20.519 align:start position:0%
enables police standards and training to
 
00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:22.500 align:start position:0%
enter into that conversation with the
 
00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:25.500 align:start position:0%
judicial branch to implement a court
 
00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
security training program through police
 
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
standards and training
 
00:10:34.009 --> 00:10:34.019 align:start position:0%
um the other aspect of of why this bill
 
00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
is being brought forward is just the
 
00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
inherent uh nature of having our own
 
00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:42.180 align:start position:0%
people train ourselves you know best
 
00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
practice does provide for having a third
 
00:10:47.329 --> 00:10:47.339 align:start position:0%
party come in and oversee that training
 
00:10:48.769 --> 00:10:48.779 align:start position:0%
and that would be police standards and
 
00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
training uh in this case so we want to
 
00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:53.160 align:start position:0%
be able to you know have our folks
 
00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:55.500 align:start position:0%
trained by folks who are professional
 
00:10:58.069 --> 00:10:58.079 align:start position:0%
trainers who are maintaining sort of the
 
00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:00.540 align:start position:0%
day-to-day knowledge of the latest
 
00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:03.060 align:start position:0%
issues in in training
 
00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
um but all that said our court security
 
00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
officers remain employees of the
 
00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:09.720 align:start position:0%
judicial branch so they are still
 
00:11:11.449 --> 00:11:11.459 align:start position:0%
subject to all the policies and
 
00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:13.500 align:start position:0%
procedures that all judicial branch
 
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
employees are required to uh to follow
 
00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
it at all times
 
00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:20.269 align:start position:0%
it at all times
um

00:11:20.269 --> 00:11:20.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:22.860 align:start position:0%
and I'll just turn it over to director
 
00:11:24.949 --> 00:11:24.959 align:start position:0%
Martin just to sort of talk through some
 
00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:26.820 align:start position:0%
of the conversations she's had with
 
00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:29.100 align:start position:0%
police standards and training and how
 
00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
sort of we look forward to working with
 
00:11:36.889 --> 00:11:36.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:39.720 align:start position:0%
good morning members of the committee
 
00:11:42.889 --> 00:11:42.899 align:start position:0%
um as Richard said I am the director of
 
00:11:44.449 --> 00:11:44.459 align:start position:0%
the administrative office of the courts
 
00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:46.740 align:start position:0%
and the court security function Falls
 
00:11:48.949 --> 00:11:48.959 align:start position:0%
within the administrative office and I
 
00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
am very proud to be able to work with
 
00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:52.860 align:start position:0%
all of these individuals who do this job
 
00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:55.380 align:start position:0%
we have a variety of people who do it
 
00:11:57.889 --> 00:11:57.899 align:start position:0%
some are retired law enforcement some
 
00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:00.420 align:start position:0%
are not and so training is very very
 
00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:02.100 align:start position:0%
important to the work that they do
 
00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:04.380 align:start position:0%
because of the various types of
 
00:12:08.449 --> 00:12:08.459 align:start position:0%
individuals that we get and so when the
 
00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:10.620 align:start position:0%
Chief came into this role a couple of
 
00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:12.540 align:start position:0%
years ago he identified this as a
 
00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:16.500 align:start position:0%
priority for him to Institute Training
 
00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
work with police standards in training
 
00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:21.300 align:start position:0%
and to really professionalize our court
 
00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
security there from an equipment
 
00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
training all of the resources that they
 
00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:29.160 align:start position:0%
need to do this job well and so we
 
00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
reached out to police standards and
 
00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
training and have been engaging with
 
00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
director skippa to try to work on this
 
00:12:38.269 --> 00:12:38.279 align:start position:0%
concept so we would love to have your
 
00:12:41.269 --> 00:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
support to move this forward and to
 
00:12:42.769 --> 00:12:42.779 align:start position:0%
engage with them to make this happen
 
00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:45.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much with that we
 
00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:46.860 align:start position:0%
conclude our comments but we'll be happy
 
00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions
 
00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:51.300 align:start position:0%
thank you um I just have a couple of
 
00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:52.680 align:start position:0%
quick questions so
 
00:12:55.009 --> 00:12:55.019 align:start position:0%
would this would the current officers be
 
00:12:58.129 --> 00:12:58.139 align:start position:0%
be mandated to go to this training as
 
00:12:59.750 --> 00:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
well or would they be grandfathered is
 
00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
there a physical fitness aspect to it
 
00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
that you're contemplating so thank you
 
00:13:05.629 --> 00:13:05.639 align:start position:0%
for the question the the exact details
 
00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:07.740 align:start position:0%
are have still need to be worked out
 
00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:09.660 align:start position:0%
there clearly are going to be different
 
00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
levels of experience of folks coming
 
00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
into our program and people are
 
00:13:15.949 --> 00:13:15.959 align:start position:0%
currently in the program whether they
 
00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:18.180 align:start position:0%
have a long history in law enforcement
 
00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:21.240 align:start position:0%
or not will sort of depend on possibly
 
00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:22.980 align:start position:0%
the the modules that they would have to
 
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
engage in
 
00:13:27.769 --> 00:13:27.779 align:start position:0%
um and and so there I think there's
 
00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:30.060 align:start position:0%
going to be a one a phase in of existing
 
00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:33.420 align:start position:0%
employees and then within as new
 
00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
employees come in in our undergoing the
 
00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
training you know they may already have
 
00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:39.240 align:start position:0%
undertaken some of the training that
 
00:13:41.329 --> 00:13:41.339 align:start position:0%
would be in all of the modules and only
 
00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
to some of them details of that program
 
00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:45.540 align:start position:0%
still need to be worked out in the in
 
00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
the conversations between the judicial
 
00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
branch and police standards and training
 
00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
 
00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:01.860 align:start position:0%
um one of the things I'm trying to
 
00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:04.980 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out is how the training
 
00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:07.860 align:start position:0%
uh that would be offered under police
 
00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:10.740 align:start position:0%
standards and training might differ from
 
00:14:14.269 --> 00:14:14.279 align:start position:0%
uh the training that's offered now in
 
00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
terms of subject matter in terms of
 
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
length in terms of certification
 
00:14:20.509 --> 00:14:20.519 align:start position:0%
requirements can you maybe go one more
 
00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
level of detail sure um so thank you for
 
00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
the question I think the again while the
 
00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:27.540 align:start position:0%
details still need to be worked out as
 
00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned we do currently have a
 
00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:32.540 align:start position:0%
program that we've developed internally
 
00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:35.820 align:start position:0%
so I think that is going to be the the
 
00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
bones of of any training program that is
 
00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:40.980 align:start position:0%
conducted by police standards and
 
00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
training and if you want more detail in
 
00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:46.980 align:start position:0%
terms of the existing CSO program either
 
00:14:50.329 --> 00:14:50.339 align:start position:0%
director Martin or Jason can speak more
 
00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:52.860 align:start position:0%
detail than I can but I think what in
 
00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:56.220 align:start position:0%
terms of process Jason Jordan hazy our
 
00:14:57.650 --> 00:14:57.660 align:start position:0%
Securities manager is going to be
 
00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:00.300 align:start position:0%
working with the sheriffs and police
 
00:15:02.329 --> 00:15:02.339 align:start position:0%
standards and training and sort of
 
00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:05.160 align:start position:0%
taking our current program and
 
00:15:06.949 --> 00:15:06.959 align:start position:0%
implementing that through police
 
00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
standards and training but adding on to
 
00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:12.060 align:start position:0%
that any additional sort of things that
 
00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:14.220 align:start position:0%
they say you know this is this you may
 
00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
need to bring this into your program
 
00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
stuff we haven't thought of but maybe
 
00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:21.540 align:start position:0%
saying you know here's an area that you
 
00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:22.980 align:start position:0%
may need to implement through your
 
00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
people that you're not currently
 
00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:25.980 align:start position:0%
training on we may say okay that's you
 
00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:27.540 align:start position:0%
know another module we want to add into
 
00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:30.180 align:start position:0%
the program but I think the bones of it
 
00:15:37.129 --> 00:15:37.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:40.189 --> 00:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
see no further questions actually um I
 
00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:42.180 align:start position:0%
have one real quick is are you aware of
 
00:15:44.329 --> 00:15:44.339 align:start position:0%
is there is there a national
 
00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:46.980 align:start position:0%
um set of best practices or standards
 
00:15:50.689 --> 00:15:50.699 align:start position:0%
certifications that that are already in
 
00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:53.100 align:start position:0%
existence uh I'm not sure if there's a
 
00:15:54.829 --> 00:15:54.839 align:start position:0%
standard Jason can answer that but we do
 
00:15:58.189 --> 00:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
participate with the national Center and
 
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
Jason and his team participate with that
 
00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:03.300 align:start position:0%
group in determining what appropriate
 
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
standards are is there actually a
 
00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:14.269 align:start position:0%
standards are is there actually a
standard

00:16:14.269 --> 00:16:14.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:16.260 align:start position:0%
however I have actually begged the
 
00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:17.820 align:start position:0%
national Center for state courts for
 
00:16:20.389 --> 00:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
years to come up with that criteria and
 
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
actually uh volunteered my time to help
 
00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:25.980 align:start position:0%
uh come up with that sort of criteria to
 
00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
help us you know as we kind of maintain
 
00:16:32.449 --> 00:16:32.459 align:start position:0%
our training programs so we could act
 
00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
theoretically be on The Cutting Edge of
 
00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
setting up a standard yes sir okay which
 
00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:40.380 align:start position:0%
which again you know folding police
 
00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:42.420 align:start position:0%
standards into our sort of training
 
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
program again like you said it makes a
 
00:16:47.389 --> 00:16:47.399 align:start position:0%
good program better okay um and I hate
 
00:16:48.829 --> 00:16:48.839 align:start position:0%
to do this but since you talked you have
 
00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:51.180 align:start position:0%
to fill out a pin card no problem at all
 
00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:52.980 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:55.380 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you thank
 
00:16:56.569 --> 00:16:56.579 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
00:16:58.129 --> 00:16:58.139 align:start position:0%
um based on everything you heard direct
 
00:16:59.749 --> 00:16:59.759 align:start position:0%
description do you feel you need to add
 
00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:04.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
just don't want to fill out that card do
 
00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:09.590 align:start position:0%
just don't want to fill out that card do
you

00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:13.079 align:start position:0%
um so you know further questions is
 
00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
there anyone else wishing to testify who
 
00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:16.620 align:start position:0%
is not testified on this bill
 
00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:22.630 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:22.640 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:25.260 align:start position:0%
in the committee will be in recessed
 
00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
until 9 30.
 
00:17:26.760 --> 00:32:28.190 align:start position:0%
until 9 30.
foreign

00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:30.769 --> 00:32:30.779 align:start position:0%
at this point we are opening the public
 
00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
hearing on Senate Bill 249
 
00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
and I
 
00:32:38.810 --> 00:32:38.820 align:start position:0%
who's going to always wow Senator Abbas
 
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
is here
 
00:32:59.090 --> 00:32:59.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:59.100 --> 00:32:59.870 align:start position:0%
 
Ed

00:32:59.870 --> 00:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
Ed
 
00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman members of the
 
00:33:03.169 --> 00:33:03.179 align:start position:0%
House criminal justice and Public Safety
 
00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:05.460 align:start position:0%
Committee it's an honor to be back here
 
00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:07.260 align:start position:0%
if for those who didn't served on this
 
00:33:09.049 --> 00:33:09.059 align:start position:0%
committee last term I used to chair this
 
00:33:09.059 --> 00:33:09.950 align:start position:0%
committee last term I used to chair this
committee

00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:11.820 align:start position:0%
and representative Rory was my vice
 
00:33:13.789 --> 00:33:13.799 align:start position:0%
chair so it's a pleasure to be back
 
00:33:16.610 --> 00:33:16.620 align:start position:0%
hopefully this goes well
 
00:33:19.549 --> 00:33:19.559 align:start position:0%
so Senate Bill 249 this for the members
 
00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:20.700 align:start position:0%
that were on this committee last term
 
00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:23.940 align:start position:0%
this language May looks very familiar
 
00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:26.460 align:start position:0%
uh this language which I helped draft
 
00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:28.860 align:start position:0%
actually pass in the Senate twice
 
00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
it was part of a much larger bill I
 
00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:33.720 align:start position:0%
believe it was Senate Bill 294 or maybe
 
00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:35.149 align:start position:0%
believe it was Senate Bill 294 or maybe
292.

00:33:35.149 --> 00:33:35.159 align:start position:0%
292.
 
00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
and what this this is a limited
 
00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
policy it applies to issues of bail but
 
00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:44.580 align:start position:0%
we're only addressing situations where a
 
00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:47.220 align:start position:0%
person has been arrested for a crime
 
00:33:50.149 --> 00:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
and we're talking about a felony a Class
 
00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:52.440 align:start position:0%
A misdemeanor or drunk driving
 
00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:55.500 align:start position:0%
all other class B uh misdemeanors and
 
00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
violations would not apply
 
00:34:00.889 --> 00:34:00.899 align:start position:0%
if that person's released on bail
 
00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:02.940 align:start position:0%
pending their trial and gets arrested
 
00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:03.950 align:start position:0%
pending their trial and gets arrested
again

00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:03.960 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:05.460 align:start position:0%
and now we're talking about another
 
00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
felony Class A misdemeanor or drunk
 
00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:09.589 align:start position:0%
felony Class A misdemeanor or drunk
driving

00:34:09.589 --> 00:34:09.599 align:start position:0%
driving
 
00:34:12.290 --> 00:34:12.300 align:start position:0%
and they get released a second time now
 
00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:15.720 align:start position:0%
when upon being released the third time
 
00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:17.700 align:start position:0%
if they were getting to get arrested
 
00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
again while the first and second charge
 
00:34:23.089 --> 00:34:23.099 align:start position:0%
is still open
 
00:34:25.369 --> 00:34:25.379 align:start position:0%
that and that would also have to be a
 
00:34:28.430 --> 00:34:28.440 align:start position:0%
felony a Class A misdemeanor or drunk
 
00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:29.329 align:start position:0%
felony a Class A misdemeanor or drunk
driving

00:34:29.329 --> 00:34:29.339 align:start position:0%
driving
 
00:34:30.889 --> 00:34:30.899 align:start position:0%
at that point there's going to be a
 
00:34:30.899 --> 00:34:32.270 align:start position:0%
at that point there's going to be a
presumption

00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
presumption
 
00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:34.200 align:start position:0%
the burden is now going to shift to the
 
00:34:36.470 --> 00:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
defendant because the presumption is if
 
00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:39.060 align:start position:0%
they were released they will not abide
 
00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:40.919 align:start position:0%
by the conditions of their release by
 
00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
not getting arrested for any type of
 
00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:46.200 align:start position:0%
bail conditions I've ever heard of or
 
00:34:49.369 --> 00:34:49.379 align:start position:0%
seen one of the conditions is is that
 
00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:51.300 align:start position:0%
you not commit any new offenses you
 
00:34:53.329 --> 00:34:53.339 align:start position:0%
don't get arrested again
 
00:34:56.570 --> 00:34:56.580 align:start position:0%
so what this is saying is
 
00:34:58.430 --> 00:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
because you violate those conditions
 
00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
twice already on offenses that you can
 
00:35:03.349 --> 00:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
go to jail for or drunk driving
 
00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
we're not going to give you the benefit
 
00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
of the doubt now that you're just gonna
 
00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:09.420 align:start position:0%
abide by these conditions and we're we
 
00:35:11.089 --> 00:35:11.099 align:start position:0%
hear the term Catch and Release Catch
 
00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:12.060 align:start position:0%
and Release I don't really like that
 
00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
term but that's where it comes from is
 
00:35:15.109 --> 00:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
where someone gets arrested they get
 
00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:17.160 align:start position:0%
released they get arrested again
 
00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
the people are getting arrested for
 
00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:20.220 align:start position:0%
multiple offenses and these are all in a
 
00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:21.780 align:start position:0%
short period of time
 
00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:23.640 align:start position:0%
so think about the amount of resources
 
00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
between the court the police
 
00:35:28.609 --> 00:35:28.619 align:start position:0%
we're doing a lot of putting a lot of
 
00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
time into and money and expenses into
 
00:35:34.069 --> 00:35:34.079 align:start position:0%
dealing with this and
 
00:35:36.109 --> 00:35:36.119 align:start position:0%
there's no consequence for violating the
 
00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
conditions of your release I would
 
00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:39.240 align:start position:0%
suggest if you don't support this policy
 
00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:41.700 align:start position:0%
you examine why you even have conditions
 
00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
of your release in the first place
 
00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:45.720 align:start position:0%
why have them if you can violate them
 
00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:48.060 align:start position:0%
without consequence
 
00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:51.540 align:start position:0%
in my my humble opinion that is in
 
00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
unnecessary provision at that point I'm
 
00:35:55.010 --> 00:35:55.020 align:start position:0%
not agreeing that we go in that
 
00:35:58.010 --> 00:35:58.020 align:start position:0%
direction because that would basically
 
00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:00.540 align:start position:0%
turn the entire bail system upside down
 
00:36:01.970 --> 00:36:01.980 align:start position:0%
but if you continue to violate your
 
00:36:03.109 --> 00:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
conditions there needs to be a
 
00:36:03.119 --> 00:36:04.190 align:start position:0%
conditions there needs to be a
consequence

00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:04.200 align:start position:0%
consequence
 
00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:06.300 align:start position:0%
and this is setting a clear policy of
 
00:36:08.569 --> 00:36:08.579 align:start position:0%
when it would apply the existing law
 
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
does permit it says the burden will
 
00:36:12.109 --> 00:36:12.119 align:start position:0%
shift and there'll be a rebuttable
 
00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
presumption but is is different
 
00:36:16.609 --> 00:36:16.619 align:start position:0%
interpretations of when that rebuttable
 
00:36:18.109 --> 00:36:18.119 align:start position:0%
presumption would apply is the second
 
00:36:20.329 --> 00:36:20.339 align:start position:0%
arrest this makes it very clear I'm
 
00:36:21.589 --> 00:36:21.599 align:start position:0%
going to do it on the third time and
 
00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:23.460 align:start position:0%
that's it and that's how it should be
 
00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
it's a very clear policy on when it
 
00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:28.140 align:start position:0%
would be applicable it also I believe
 
00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
it's very reasonable I mean think about
 
00:36:31.970 --> 00:36:31.980 align:start position:0%
this you have to be arrested for
 
00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:33.780 align:start position:0%
jailable offenses
 
00:36:36.290 --> 00:36:36.300 align:start position:0%
three times on three separate occasions
 
00:36:39.109 --> 00:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
for different crimes different events in
 
00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
a short period of time
 
00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:42.720 align:start position:0%
that's what this applies to this is a
 
00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:45.420 align:start position:0%
reasonable policy IT addresses up what I
 
00:36:47.089 --> 00:36:47.099 align:start position:0%
would say an unintended consequence of
 
00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:49.140 align:start position:0%
what bail reform was passed a few years
 
00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
back and I think this is a good policy
 
00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
for public safety concerns and I'll
 
00:36:56.990 --> 00:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:59.450 --> 00:36:59.460 align:start position:0%
representative Peru
 
00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:01.140 align:start position:0%
why are we waiting until the third time
 
00:37:03.050 --> 00:37:03.060 align:start position:0%
and not the second did you get pushed
 
00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
back if you tried the second
 
00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
well that's a good question
 
00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:09.410 align:start position:0%
well that's a good question
so

00:37:09.410 --> 00:37:09.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:11.220 align:start position:0%
considering that this policy didn't pass
 
00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
last term at as being the third time I
 
00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:15.720 align:start position:0%
don't believe it didn't pass because
 
00:37:17.089 --> 00:37:17.099 align:start position:0%
people thought it was
 
00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:19.380 align:start position:0%
to Win It
 
00:37:21.109 --> 00:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
so I wouldn't although I wouldn't
 
00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
necessarily be opposed to such a policy
 
00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:25.740 align:start position:0%
I do believe in working together and
 
00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
trying to come to a compromise on a on a
 
00:37:30.290 --> 00:37:30.300 align:start position:0%
practical reasonable policy and
 
00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes these crimes aren't always
 
00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:34.020 align:start position:0%
related so drunk driving yes it's a
 
00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:35.640 align:start position:0%
public safety concern but it is a Class
 
00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
B misdemeanor so if you had a you know a
 
00:37:40.609 --> 00:37:40.619 align:start position:0%
violent offense then three months later
 
00:37:42.349 --> 00:37:42.359 align:start position:0%
you get a drunk driving charge those are
 
00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
separate from each other that you don't
 
00:37:46.370 --> 00:37:46.380 align:start position:0%
have the same victim per se so I
 
00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:48.900 align:start position:0%
understand there are circumstances where
 
00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:50.700 align:start position:0%
this can be a very tight policy I think
 
00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:52.980 align:start position:0%
three is more than reasonable and it's
 
00:37:54.410 --> 00:37:54.420 align:start position:0%
really no excuse for that especially
 
00:37:59.930 --> 00:37:59.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:02.089 --> 00:38:02.099 align:start position:0%
representative salig thank you for
 
00:38:03.829 --> 00:38:03.839 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:38:03.839 --> 00:38:05.030 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:07.790 --> 00:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
yesterday some of us were to go toward
 
00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:09.240 align:start position:0%
the court system and talk with them
 
00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:10.440 align:start position:0%
about some of the issues and one thing
 
00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
that was apparent was the extreme
 
00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
shortage of public defenders which was
 
00:38:15.530 --> 00:38:15.540 align:start position:0%
leading some people to have their trials
 
00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:18.660 align:start position:0%
continued for six to nine months at
 
00:38:21.290 --> 00:38:21.300 align:start position:0%
least before arraignment
 
00:38:24.410 --> 00:38:24.420 align:start position:0%
um how are those people if they have no
 
00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
attorney for six months eight months ten
 
00:38:28.970 --> 00:38:28.980 align:start position:0%
months a year
 
00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
how long is are they subject to to this
 
00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:33.720 align:start position:0%
if they have perhaps an addiction issue
 
00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:36.180 align:start position:0%
or some other challenge
 
00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
so I this won't solve the shortage of
 
00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
public defenders
 
00:38:43.609 --> 00:38:43.619 align:start position:0%
either way whether regardless of whether
 
00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:46.500 align:start position:0%
the case is continued if that's done by
 
00:38:48.050 --> 00:38:48.060 align:start position:0%
agreement that's the choice of the
 
00:38:51.050 --> 00:38:51.060 align:start position:0%
defendant to leave the case open uh I
 
00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
would say I would not advi if I would
 
00:38:54.170 --> 00:38:54.180 align:start position:0%
not advise for in continuance because
 
00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:56.280 align:start position:0%
you have a right to a speedy trial there
 
00:38:58.250 --> 00:38:58.260 align:start position:0%
are some benefits of
 
00:39:00.109 --> 00:39:00.119 align:start position:0%
moving the case forward but there's also
 
00:39:02.450 --> 00:39:02.460 align:start position:0%
benefits perhaps strategy wise of
 
00:39:04.490 --> 00:39:04.500 align:start position:0%
delaying the case I won't get into the
 
00:39:07.069 --> 00:39:07.079 align:start position:0%
many fact patterns of why but that's a
 
00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:09.180 align:start position:0%
if that's ultimately the right to have a
 
00:39:10.970 --> 00:39:10.980 align:start position:0%
speedy trial if they want to raise that
 
00:39:13.310 --> 00:39:13.320 align:start position:0%
argument they can but
 
00:39:15.050 --> 00:39:15.060 align:start position:0%
in this case it's still three times
 
00:39:16.609 --> 00:39:16.619 align:start position:0%
that's another reason for why perhaps
 
00:39:19.370 --> 00:39:19.380 align:start position:0%
maybe two you know having this strict
 
00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
policy on a second offense might be too
 
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.010 align:start position:0%
policy on a second offense might be too
stringent

00:39:22.010 --> 00:39:22.020 align:start position:0%
stringent
 
00:39:24.770 --> 00:39:24.780 align:start position:0%
because it can be delayed at no fault of
 
00:39:27.530 --> 00:39:27.540 align:start position:0%
the uh defendant but it's not an it's
 
00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
not an automatic situation where the
 
00:39:31.849 --> 00:39:31.859 align:start position:0%
person will be held awaiting trial they
 
00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:33.180 align:start position:0%
have to then rebut the presumption
 
00:39:35.210 --> 00:39:35.220 align:start position:0%
explain why they if they are released
 
00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
they're not going to now get arrested a
 
00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
fourth time if they can present that
 
00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:41.160 align:start position:0%
argument in the persuasive Manner and
 
00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
explain why these are our separate
 
00:39:44.930 --> 00:39:44.940 align:start position:0%
offenses perhaps if they were
 
00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
um had substance abuse issues and
 
00:39:48.530 --> 00:39:48.540 align:start position:0%
weren't getting treated but then gut
 
00:39:50.810 --> 00:39:50.820 align:start position:0%
treatment it's perhaps less likely
 
00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
they'll violate the conditions of their
 
00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
release so I think that's an argument
 
00:39:55.490 --> 00:39:55.500 align:start position:0%
that you have to evaluate on a
 
00:39:58.270 --> 00:39:58.280 align:start position:0%
case-by-case basis
 
00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:00.780 align:start position:0%
and just to maybe answer your question
 
00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
if you recall um what we heard was if
 
00:40:06.410 --> 00:40:06.420 align:start position:0%
they were being held the public defender
 
00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
was assigned right away versus if
 
00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:10.260 align:start position:0%
they're out that's when the six months
 
00:40:12.349 --> 00:40:12.359 align:start position:0%
we year thing so
 
00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
if that helps
 
00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:15.609 align:start position:0%
if that helps
um

00:40:15.609 --> 00:40:15.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:18.890 --> 00:40:18.900 align:start position:0%
oh representative Newell
 
00:40:20.329 --> 00:40:20.339 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:40:22.069 --> 00:40:22.079 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:40:25.010 --> 00:40:25.020 align:start position:0%
um I agree with the spirit and and that
 
00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:28.200 align:start position:0%
my question is how does this reconcile
 
00:40:30.050 --> 00:40:30.060 align:start position:0%
with innocent until proven guilty
 
00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:31.740 align:start position:0%
because at this point you're what you're
 
00:40:34.130 --> 00:40:34.140 align:start position:0%
saying is and I'm sure that there's you
 
00:40:36.770 --> 00:40:36.780 align:start position:0%
know it's demonstrable something that is
 
00:40:38.569 --> 00:40:38.579 align:start position:0%
violent or you know that kind of stuff
 
00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
my question is how do you reconcile it
 
00:40:42.410 --> 00:40:42.420 align:start position:0%
you know them not actually being
 
00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
convicted of a crime and still suffering
 
00:40:46.069 --> 00:40:46.079 align:start position:0%
the consequences of
 
00:40:49.130 --> 00:40:49.140 align:start position:0%
you know being deemed as guilty of that
 
00:40:51.770 --> 00:40:51.780 align:start position:0%
crime so innocent until proven guilty
 
00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
that Beyond a reasonable doubt that
 
00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
that's the that's the trial standard so
 
00:40:57.410 --> 00:40:57.420 align:start position:0%
you're there's a presumption of innocent
 
00:40:57.420 --> 00:40:58.430 align:start position:0%
you're there's a presumption of innocent
yes

00:40:58.430 --> 00:40:58.440 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about is when you're
 
00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:01.550 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about is when you're
released

00:41:01.550 --> 00:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
released
 
00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:04.200 align:start position:0%
on bail there's conditions of your
 
00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:07.800 align:start position:0%
release for example do not use drugs or
 
00:41:10.069 --> 00:41:10.079 align:start position:0%
alcohol that can be conditioned if you
 
00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:11.660 align:start position:0%
violate the condition of your release
 
00:41:14.210 --> 00:41:14.220 align:start position:0%
the the state and this is a common
 
00:41:16.010 --> 00:41:16.020 align:start position:0%
throughout all the states that they
 
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
actually are allowed to revoke your bail
 
00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
whether it's pending trial or for a
 
00:41:21.589 --> 00:41:21.599 align:start position:0%
certain time period
 
00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:24.180 align:start position:0%
uh one of those conditions and I've sat
 
00:41:25.970 --> 00:41:25.980 align:start position:0%
through more arraignment hearings than I
 
00:41:28.609 --> 00:41:28.619 align:start position:0%
can count I've represented
 
00:41:31.130 --> 00:41:31.140 align:start position:0%
many criminal defendants I can't I can't
 
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:34.020 align:start position:0%
uh give you an exact number I've never
 
00:41:35.930 --> 00:41:35.940 align:start position:0%
encountered a circumstance where one of
 
00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
the conditions of their release was to
 
00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
not get arrested
 
00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
for any new offenses
 
00:41:44.930 --> 00:41:44.940 align:start position:0%
so what's happening is the violation of
 
00:41:46.970 --> 00:41:46.980 align:start position:0%
the conditions of their release is the
 
00:41:48.349 --> 00:41:48.359 align:start position:0%
fact that they got arrested and charged
 
00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
the new fence and that's why the
 
00:41:52.849 --> 00:41:52.859 align:start position:0%
language uses a probable cause it says
 
00:41:54.109 --> 00:41:54.119 align:start position:0%
probably it says probable cause because
 
00:41:57.349 --> 00:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
that's the standard for the arrest if if
 
00:41:59.750 --> 00:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
you go to court and you defeat it on a
 
00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
probable cause argument it won't
 
00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:05.160 align:start position:0%
actually result in your bill being
 
00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
revoked because you've now defeated that
 
00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:12.950 align:start position:0%
revoked because you've now defeated that
case

00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:15.900 align:start position:0%
representative Sue Newman
 
00:42:18.589 --> 00:42:18.599 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question you
 
00:42:21.310 --> 00:42:21.320 align:start position:0%
had mentioned in your testimony a
 
00:42:24.530 --> 00:42:24.540 align:start position:0%
rearrest within a short period of time
 
00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:27.240 align:start position:0%
is there a definition of what this short
 
00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
period of time is or does that depend on
 
00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:33.060 align:start position:0%
what their current bails status is does
 
00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
that drive it
 
00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
the the time period is not in here when
 
00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
I say short period of time look at this
 
00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:40.010 align:start position:0%
I say short period of time look at this
way

00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:40.020 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
the majority overwhelming majority of
 
00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
the population is able to live their
 
00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:45.720 align:start position:0%
lives without getting arrested never
 
00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:47.700 align:start position:0%
mind three times while the first and
 
00:42:49.609 --> 00:42:49.619 align:start position:0%
second case is still open so I say short
 
00:42:51.530 --> 00:42:51.540 align:start position:0%
period of time relatively you talk about
 
00:42:53.690 --> 00:42:53.700 align:start position:0%
within one year time period
 
00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:55.800 align:start position:0%
give or take to be arrested that many
 
00:42:58.849 --> 00:42:58.859 align:start position:0%
times you're dealing with a person who's
 
00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:00.780 align:start position:0%
not abiding by the conditions of their
 
00:43:02.210 --> 00:43:02.220 align:start position:0%
beliefs but also committing multiple
 
00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:04.740 align:start position:0%
criminal offenses
 
00:43:06.530 --> 00:43:06.540 align:start position:0%
without without consequence to the
 
00:43:07.730 --> 00:43:07.740 align:start position:0%
conditions of the release in the first
 
00:43:10.490 --> 00:43:10.500 align:start position:0%
place and when you have a bail hearing
 
00:43:13.370 --> 00:43:13.380 align:start position:0%
the state is is at their discretion they
 
00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:15.720 align:start position:0%
can argue for a high cash Bill if they
 
00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
want they can argue a lot of different
 
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
conditions but part of it the conditions
 
00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
of the releases it's often even done by
 
00:43:23.210 --> 00:43:23.220 align:start position:0%
agreement of the parties
 
00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
we agree on these conditions and they
 
00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
don't follow the conditions so
 
00:43:29.809 --> 00:43:29.819 align:start position:0%
I I think that's something that needs to
 
00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
be factored in now we're talking about a
 
00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
third violation so short period of time
 
00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
I would say is
 
00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:36.180 align:start position:0%
you know while the first one's still
 
00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:48.829 --> 00:43:48.839 align:start position:0%
thank you for for taking my question
 
00:43:50.569 --> 00:43:50.579 align:start position:0%
um looking at the bill
 
00:43:52.849 --> 00:43:52.859 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that I see is I see
 
00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
the addition of your language
 
00:43:57.950 --> 00:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
but right up above it there's a lot of
 
00:44:01.370 --> 00:44:01.380 align:start position:0%
stuff that's uh that struck out and some
 
00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
of the things that are struck out that
 
00:44:04.690 --> 00:44:04.700 align:start position:0%
first line
 
00:44:08.569 --> 00:44:08.579 align:start position:0%
something I'm I'm curious about is it
 
00:44:10.730 --> 00:44:10.740 align:start position:0%
appears that we already have a
 
00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
rebuttable presumption in the statute
 
00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
that somebody if if somebody who is
 
00:44:19.069 --> 00:44:19.079 align:start position:0%
already on release doesn't abide with
 
00:44:22.370 --> 00:44:22.380 align:start position:0%
the conditions of their release that's
 
00:44:25.790 --> 00:44:25.800 align:start position:0%
something the court can look at and bail
 
00:44:28.250 --> 00:44:28.260 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that it's within the
 
00:44:30.170 --> 00:44:30.180 align:start position:0%
power of the court to actually revoke
 
00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:31.550 align:start position:0%
power of the court to actually revoke
Baal

00:44:31.550 --> 00:44:31.560 align:start position:0%
Baal
 
00:44:34.250 --> 00:44:34.260 align:start position:0%
so one of the things I struggle with a
 
00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:35.880 align:start position:0%
little bit in these bills is when I look
 
00:44:38.750 --> 00:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
at our current statute I see that the
 
00:44:40.130 --> 00:44:40.140 align:start position:0%
power to do that is there the
 
00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
flexibility to do that is there but for
 
00:44:44.930 --> 00:44:44.940 align:start position:0%
some reason uh it doesn't appear to be
 
00:44:46.069 --> 00:44:46.079 align:start position:0%
getting done
 
00:44:48.770 --> 00:44:48.780 align:start position:0%
and what I'm curious about is whether or
 
00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
not you think this actually fixes that
 
00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:53.870 align:start position:0%
not you think this actually fixes that
problem

00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:53.880 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question what I can
 
00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
tell you is this this is the current law
 
00:45:00.530 --> 00:45:00.540 align:start position:0%
is being interpreted and applied
 
00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:01.550 align:start position:0%
is being interpreted and applied
differently

00:45:01.550 --> 00:45:01.560 align:start position:0%
differently
 
00:45:03.530 --> 00:45:03.540 align:start position:0%
depending on where you get arrested and
 
00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
which court you're appearing and which
 
00:45:07.010 --> 00:45:07.020 align:start position:0%
judge you're appearing from
 
00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
and you would like to think that it's
 
00:45:10.730 --> 00:45:10.740 align:start position:0%
the zip code of where you can get
 
00:45:13.130 --> 00:45:13.140 align:start position:0%
arrested shouldn't they play into it or
 
00:45:14.450 --> 00:45:14.460 align:start position:0%
the judge that happens to be sitting in
 
00:45:16.430 --> 00:45:16.440 align:start position:0%
that court on that particular day
 
00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
so that to me this is a clearer policy
 
00:45:23.450 --> 00:45:23.460 align:start position:0%
it's also not clear when so the if the
 
00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
burden shifts and now there's a
 
00:45:26.329 --> 00:45:26.339 align:start position:0%
rebuttable assumption to the defendant
 
00:45:28.370 --> 00:45:28.380 align:start position:0%
it's not clear what happens to that
 
00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:29.329 align:start position:0%
it's not clear what happens to that
party

00:45:29.329 --> 00:45:29.339 align:start position:0%
party
 
00:45:31.790 --> 00:45:31.800 align:start position:0%
it the law is actually not written clear
 
00:45:34.010 --> 00:45:34.020 align:start position:0%
on how the court should handle that
 
00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:35.880 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say what the what the
 
00:45:37.550 --> 00:45:37.560 align:start position:0%
consequence is of violating the
 
00:45:39.050 --> 00:45:39.060 align:start position:0%
conditions it kind of leaves it
 
00:45:41.690 --> 00:45:41.700 align:start position:0%
open-ended so you're getting
 
00:45:44.450 --> 00:45:44.460 align:start position:0%
inconsistent results this creates a
 
00:45:47.329 --> 00:45:47.339 align:start position:0%
clear policy on what and I I would even
 
00:45:49.250 --> 00:45:49.260 align:start position:0%
suggest this was the intent of the
 
00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
original draft
 
00:45:52.069 --> 00:45:52.079 align:start position:0%
but it also makes it clear what happened
 
00:45:53.210 --> 00:45:53.220 align:start position:0%
on the third offense whether the
 
00:45:55.550 --> 00:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
original draft if you were to interpret
 
00:45:58.309 --> 00:45:58.319 align:start position:0%
it you know really narrowly and strictly
 
00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:00.300 align:start position:0%
they could be held on the second offense
 
00:46:02.390 --> 00:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
this makes it clear when that
 
00:46:04.250 --> 00:46:04.260 align:start position:0%
presumption shifts and what would happen
 
00:46:07.370 --> 00:46:07.380 align:start position:0%
when it does and how to overcome it
 
00:46:12.170 --> 00:46:12.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:14.640 align:start position:0%
as a defense attorney and I believe you
 
00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
said that you uh you have defended uh
 
00:46:18.589 --> 00:46:18.599 align:start position:0%
numerous clients
 
00:46:22.370 --> 00:46:22.380 align:start position:0%
um in criminal cases
 
00:46:24.410 --> 00:46:24.420 align:start position:0%
one of the things
 
00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:25.089 align:start position:0%
one of the things
um

00:46:25.089 --> 00:46:25.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:29.470 --> 00:46:29.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:32.460 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I think is part
 
00:46:36.170 --> 00:46:36.180 align:start position:0%
of our judicial system is the idea that
 
00:46:39.349 --> 00:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
uh that the circumstances of different
 
00:46:42.170 --> 00:46:42.180 align:start position:0%
individuals are different which is one
 
00:46:44.930 --> 00:46:44.940 align:start position:0%
of the reasons why we have uh judicial
 
00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
and prosecutorial discretion
 
00:46:51.530 --> 00:46:51.540 align:start position:0%
um it looks like this particular bill
 
00:46:55.010 --> 00:46:55.020 align:start position:0%
would remove that uh that discretion in
 
00:46:58.790 --> 00:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:02.809 --> 00:47:02.819 align:start position:0%
I can my experience is that if the
 
00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:04.440 align:start position:0%
prosecutor does not want the person to
 
00:47:06.109 --> 00:47:06.119 align:start position:0%
be held and they make that
 
00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
recommendation that is something that
 
00:47:10.370 --> 00:47:10.380 align:start position:0%
the court would favorably take into
 
00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:11.930 align:start position:0%
the court would favorably take into
consideration

00:47:11.930 --> 00:47:11.940 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
00:47:14.690 --> 00:47:14.700 align:start position:0%
when applying this policy
 
00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
what I will tell you the prosecutor if
 
00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:19.260 align:start position:0%
they if they don't want to actually
 
00:47:21.650 --> 00:47:21.660 align:start position:0%
prosecute the person and the person's
 
00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
been arrested I'm surprised that they
 
00:47:25.069 --> 00:47:25.079 align:start position:0%
would be advancing the case in the first
 
00:47:25.079 --> 00:47:26.030 align:start position:0%
would be advancing the case in the first
place

00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:47:27.589 --> 00:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
I would think there's an ethical issue
 
00:47:30.589 --> 00:47:30.599 align:start position:0%
when you file a case whether criminal or
 
00:47:33.650 --> 00:47:33.660 align:start position:0%
civil there's a obligation that you
 
00:47:36.170 --> 00:47:36.180 align:start position:0%
intend on seeing that case through
 
00:47:37.849 --> 00:47:37.859 align:start position:0%
and if they don't intend on seeing it
 
00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:40.200 align:start position:0%
through they shouldn't be issuing the
 
00:47:42.050 --> 00:47:42.060 align:start position:0%
complaint or addressing any further it's
 
00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
not just the fact that they've been
 
00:47:45.050 --> 00:47:45.060 align:start position:0%
arrested they've been arrested with a
 
00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:46.440 align:start position:0%
new charge and that charge you would
 
00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
have to have probable cause
 
00:47:51.109 --> 00:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
so that's that's my take I don't think
 
00:47:53.930 --> 00:47:53.940 align:start position:0%
you're taking the discretion away
 
00:47:58.550 --> 00:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question
 
00:48:03.410 --> 00:48:03.420 align:start position:0%
um the fiscal note is interesting it's
 
00:48:06.849 --> 00:48:06.859 align:start position:0%
really long but it has a lot of zeros
 
00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
it says on the back the judicial branch
 
00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
assumes this bill would result in an
 
00:48:15.050 --> 00:48:15.060 align:start position:0%
increase in the number of Bill hearings
 
00:48:16.609 --> 00:48:16.619 align:start position:0%
and Associated costs but they're unable
 
00:48:19.309 --> 00:48:19.319 align:start position:0%
to quantify the size of the increase and
 
00:48:21.410 --> 00:48:21.420 align:start position:0%
then they also talk in the next I think
 
00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:23.940 align:start position:0%
the next last paragraph about the impact
 
00:48:26.510 --> 00:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
on County budgets
 
00:48:28.970 --> 00:48:28.980 align:start position:0%
um which is you know something that we
 
00:48:31.609 --> 00:48:31.619 align:start position:0%
uh the house member set
 
00:48:34.430 --> 00:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
um as far as the cost of running the
 
00:48:36.829 --> 00:48:36.839 align:start position:0%
county jails but they're very clear that
 
00:48:39.410 --> 00:48:39.420 align:start position:0%
they have no idea what the increase
 
00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:40.550 align:start position:0%
they have no idea what the increase
um

00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:40.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:43.309 --> 00:48:43.319 align:start position:0%
tax rate would be because it depends on
 
00:48:45.170 --> 00:48:45.180 align:start position:0%
so many factors do you have any
 
00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
estimates for that
 
00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
if anyone gave an estimate it would be
 
00:48:52.250 --> 00:48:52.260 align:start position:0%
they would be guessing because there's
 
00:48:54.050 --> 00:48:54.060 align:start position:0%
no way to really quantify how many
 
00:48:55.970 --> 00:48:55.980 align:start position:0%
people are going to get get arrested who
 
00:48:57.950 --> 00:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
are already out on bail for their second
 
00:49:01.010 --> 00:49:01.020 align:start position:0%
and third offense so will there be a
 
00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact on the court if you're
 
00:49:03.950 --> 00:49:03.960 align:start position:0%
going to have people in court people
 
00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
being held is a fiscal impact there's
 
00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
also a fiscal impact of processing all
 
00:49:11.089 --> 00:49:11.099 align:start position:0%
these extra cases is a fiscal impact on
 
00:49:13.069 --> 00:49:13.079 align:start position:0%
the county sheriff's department and on
 
00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
law enforcement of constantly having to
 
00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
arrest the same person one of the
 
00:49:19.309 --> 00:49:19.319 align:start position:0%
reasons why I support drunk driving
 
00:49:21.170 --> 00:49:21.180 align:start position:0%
being in here and this was a few years
 
00:49:24.290 --> 00:49:24.300 align:start position:0%
back I had someone call me and it wasn't
 
00:49:25.490 --> 00:49:25.500 align:start position:0%
a constituent but someone in New
 
00:49:27.109 --> 00:49:27.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and they had a family member
 
00:49:29.150 --> 00:49:29.160 align:start position:0%
who was arrested for drunk driving five
 
00:49:31.370 --> 00:49:31.380 align:start position:0%
times in a two-month period and they
 
00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:33.480 align:start position:0%
were wondering how could that happen and
 
00:49:34.970 --> 00:49:34.980 align:start position:0%
I had to explain well they haven't been
 
00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
convicted of the first so we've been not
 
00:49:37.970 --> 00:49:37.980 align:start position:0%
being charged the second third or fourth
 
00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:38.809 align:start position:0%
being charged the second third or fourth
offense

00:49:38.809 --> 00:49:38.819 align:start position:0%
offense
 
00:49:41.030 --> 00:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
what's happening is your system your
 
00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
bail system is a problem
 
00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
this person kept getting released and
 
00:49:46.010 --> 00:49:46.020 align:start position:0%
for someone to
 
00:49:47.930 --> 00:49:47.940 align:start position:0%
not having extensive criminal record and
 
00:49:49.849 --> 00:49:49.859 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden have five drunk driving
 
00:49:51.650 --> 00:49:51.660 align:start position:0%
arrests in a short period of time that
 
00:49:53.870 --> 00:49:53.880 align:start position:0%
seemed like a person in crisis and
 
00:49:56.450 --> 00:49:56.460 align:start position:0%
simply releasing that person I didn't
 
00:49:58.190 --> 00:49:58.200 align:start position:0%
think was a benefit to the public or to
 
00:50:00.410 --> 00:50:00.420 align:start position:0%
that person at this point I don't know
 
00:50:01.790 --> 00:50:01.800 align:start position:0%
though the details of each of those
 
00:50:04.010 --> 00:50:04.020 align:start position:0%
charges and what went into each one of
 
00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:05.880 align:start position:0%
them but they have that many in one
 
00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
period of time you're talking about how
 
00:50:09.470 --> 00:50:09.480 align:start position:0%
many resources are going in you have to
 
00:50:11.450 --> 00:50:11.460 align:start position:0%
arrest the person you have to then
 
00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
process the person then is it the case
 
00:50:16.010 --> 00:50:16.020 align:start position:0%
goes to court it's now an open file if
 
00:50:17.210 --> 00:50:17.220 align:start position:0%
they have a public defender or they're
 
00:50:19.010 --> 00:50:19.020 align:start position:0%
hiring private counsel it's clogging up
 
00:50:21.829 --> 00:50:21.839 align:start position:0%
the court system so this is the Hope is
 
00:50:24.050 --> 00:50:24.060 align:start position:0%
this this will cut down on the amount of
 
00:50:26.329 --> 00:50:26.339 align:start position:0%
repeat offenses which also has a fiscal
 
00:50:27.890 --> 00:50:27.900 align:start position:0%
impact they're thinking in a positive
 
00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
way so hopefully they offset in an
 
00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
equitable way but there's no way to
 
00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:39.109 --> 00:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
okay so you um thanks for taking my
 
00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
follow-up questions so you do anticipate
 
00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
an increased cost to the state judicial
 
00:50:45.770 --> 00:50:45.780 align:start position:0%
system and the county budgets because
 
00:50:47.630 --> 00:50:47.640 align:start position:0%
um this the
 
00:50:49.309 --> 00:50:49.319 align:start position:0%
the courts have made it very clear to
 
00:50:51.470 --> 00:50:51.480 align:start position:0%
this committee that they're underfunded
 
00:50:54.230 --> 00:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
currently and that they need more
 
00:50:56.089 --> 00:50:56.099 align:start position:0%
funding and more staff when we were
 
00:50:58.069 --> 00:50:58.079 align:start position:0%
touring yesterday they were showing us
 
00:50:59.870 --> 00:50:59.880 align:start position:0%
how there was someone working a job she
 
00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't normally work because they were
 
00:51:05.930 --> 00:51:05.940 align:start position:0%
short staffed so are you so you are
 
00:51:07.609 --> 00:51:07.619 align:start position:0%
saying you're aware that this would
 
00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:10.380 align:start position:0%
increase costs to an already underfunded
 
00:51:13.190 --> 00:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
department and you're okay with that but
 
00:51:15.589 --> 00:51:15.599 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping that I I think it will have
 
00:51:17.210 --> 00:51:17.220 align:start position:0%
an increased fiscal impact I'm hoping
 
00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
that the house passes a budget and I'm
 
00:51:21.710 --> 00:51:21.720 align:start position:0%
really hopeful that when I when the
 
00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
budget makes it to the Senate that is
 
00:51:26.210 --> 00:51:26.220 align:start position:0%
adequate funding for the courts because
 
00:51:28.849 --> 00:51:28.859 align:start position:0%
Beyond this policy nothing's and I've
 
00:51:30.170 --> 00:51:30.180 align:start position:0%
seen this nothing's more frustrating
 
00:51:32.210 --> 00:51:32.220 align:start position:0%
than watching someone get paid 300 an
 
00:51:34.190 --> 00:51:34.200 align:start position:0%
hour to sit on the bench waiting for a
 
00:51:36.349 --> 00:51:36.359 align:start position:0%
case to be called I you know as I I
 
00:51:38.390 --> 00:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
don't feel that that's a good attorneys
 
00:51:39.589 --> 00:51:39.599 align:start position:0%
are expensive and if you're paying them
 
00:51:41.210 --> 00:51:41.220 align:start position:0%
to sit there because it's overcrowd I
 
00:51:41.220 --> 00:51:42.230 align:start position:0%
to sit there because it's overcrowd I
don't

00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
that's that's
 
00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:44.030 align:start position:0%
that's that's
um

00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:45.890 --> 00:51:45.900 align:start position:0%
that's not good money well spent so if
 
00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
you keep it moving along in an efficient
 
00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
manner you have police that are waiting
 
00:51:50.990 --> 00:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
for their case to be called there's
 
00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
Court interpreters there's a lot of
 
00:51:55.730 --> 00:51:55.740 align:start position:0%
negative fiscal consequences of having
 
00:51:57.290 --> 00:51:57.300 align:start position:0%
an understaffed Court
 
00:51:59.750 --> 00:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
so I would I would support uh adequate
 
00:52:01.490 --> 00:52:01.500 align:start position:0%
Staffing the court
 
00:52:09.049 --> 00:52:09.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:10.490 --> 00:52:10.500 align:start position:0%
well representative representative
 
00:52:13.970 --> 00:52:13.980 align:start position:0%
excuse me representative Murray first
 
00:52:15.650 --> 00:52:15.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you senator
 
00:52:17.450 --> 00:52:17.460 align:start position:0%
for taking my question and I actually
 
00:52:19.549 --> 00:52:19.559 align:start position:0%
just had two quick ones um one I was
 
00:52:19.559 --> 00:52:21.170 align:start position:0%
just had two quick ones um one I was
wondering

00:52:21.170 --> 00:52:21.180 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
00:52:23.210 --> 00:52:23.220 align:start position:0%
um if there was a reason for striking
 
00:52:25.370 --> 00:52:25.380 align:start position:0%
out the language relating to financial
 
00:52:27.650 --> 00:52:27.660 align:start position:0%
conditions for bail and pre-trial
 
00:52:29.870 --> 00:52:29.880 align:start position:0%
detentions and then my second question
 
00:52:33.890 --> 00:52:33.900 align:start position:0%
was if um this bill coincides well with
 
00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
Senator Susie's bill Senate Bill 252
 
00:52:38.990 --> 00:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
where if they clash with each other
 
00:52:40.970 --> 00:52:40.980 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question and the second
 
00:52:43.250 --> 00:52:43.260 align:start position:0%
part of it with Senate Bill 252 which I
 
00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:44.640 align:start position:0%
also support and it's I believe that's
 
00:52:46.849 --> 00:52:46.859 align:start position:0%
an excellent policy they do not conflict
 
00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
their separate sections of the bail
 
00:52:51.410 --> 00:52:51.420 align:start position:0%
statute and the section about the cash
 
00:52:53.089 --> 00:52:53.099 align:start position:0%
bill being struck out there is another
 
00:52:53.099 --> 00:52:54.230 align:start position:0%
bill being struck out there is another
section

00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:52:57.170 --> 00:52:57.180 align:start position:0%
in the bill chapter that specifically
 
00:53:00.829 --> 00:53:00.839 align:start position:0%
addresses the uh cash bail and if a
 
00:53:02.210 --> 00:53:02.220 align:start position:0%
person's being held simply because they
 
00:53:03.710 --> 00:53:03.720 align:start position:0%
can't pay their bill
 
00:53:05.450 --> 00:53:05.460 align:start position:0%
they don't have the financial resources
 
00:53:07.730 --> 00:53:07.740 align:start position:0%
to do so then there needs to be a
 
00:53:10.069 --> 00:53:10.079 align:start position:0%
written finding that part is struck out
 
00:53:12.589 --> 00:53:12.599 align:start position:0%
because I don't personally in my opinion
 
00:53:13.849 --> 00:53:13.859 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's a good policy well
 
00:53:15.230 --> 00:53:15.240 align:start position:0%
the person's been arrested a second time
 
00:53:17.270 --> 00:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
but will increase their bail from 500 to
 
00:53:18.790 --> 00:53:18.800 align:start position:0%
a thousand dollars I don't think that's
 
00:53:22.790 --> 00:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
really a great policy in in a sense that
 
00:53:24.290 --> 00:53:24.300 align:start position:0%
you're just increasing the bail that has
 
00:53:27.109 --> 00:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
to do with whether they're gonna uh show
 
00:53:28.190 --> 00:53:28.200 align:start position:0%
up at the next court hearing that's
 
00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
really what that's factoring in
 
00:53:32.870 --> 00:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
so that seems to be more of a punitive
 
00:53:34.849 --> 00:53:34.859 align:start position:0%
penalty by increasing the bail
 
00:53:37.430 --> 00:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
this is strictly we're not we're not
 
00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
going to necessarily offer you bail
 
00:53:41.390 --> 00:53:41.400 align:start position:0%
because you keep or to be harder to get
 
00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
bail because you keep violating the
 
00:53:43.849 --> 00:53:43.859 align:start position:0%
conditions whether you're on personal
 
00:53:45.950 --> 00:53:45.960 align:start position:0%
recognizes or paid a cash bill I don't
 
00:53:53.150 --> 00:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:55.970 --> 00:53:55.980 align:start position:0%
uh Senator this seems like it's actually
 
00:53:59.030 --> 00:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
a relaxed
 
00:54:01.370 --> 00:54:01.380 align:start position:0%
excuse me relaxation of the present
 
00:54:04.670 --> 00:54:04.680 align:start position:0%
situation do I understand that if
 
00:54:07.790 --> 00:54:07.800 align:start position:0%
somebody is on released on bail and
 
00:54:10.549 --> 00:54:10.559 align:start position:0%
violates the conditions of Baal
 
00:54:12.589 --> 00:54:12.599 align:start position:0%
the police have the discretion to take
 
00:54:14.390 --> 00:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
them to the county jail immediately
 
00:54:17.930 --> 00:54:17.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:20.410 --> 00:54:20.420 align:start position:0%
so this is in fact
 
00:54:23.690 --> 00:54:23.700 align:start position:0%
relaxing that situ that taking that
 
00:54:25.970 --> 00:54:25.980 align:start position:0%
discretion away is it not
 
00:54:28.309 --> 00:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
I think what this is doing is creating a
 
00:54:31.010 --> 00:54:31.020 align:start position:0%
clear policy of when a person violates
 
00:54:32.690 --> 00:54:32.700 align:start position:0%
the conditions of their release by
 
00:54:35.150 --> 00:54:35.160 align:start position:0%
getting arrested while released on bail
 
00:54:37.670 --> 00:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
already multiple times when it's going
 
00:54:39.890 --> 00:54:39.900 align:start position:0%
to be invoked and it's I think there's
 
00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
an important
 
00:54:42.829 --> 00:54:42.839 align:start position:0%
important subject that doesn't always
 
00:54:44.690 --> 00:54:44.700 align:start position:0%
get talked about is consistency in how
 
00:54:46.849 --> 00:54:46.859 align:start position:0%
the law is applied this is a very clear
 
00:54:49.670 --> 00:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
policy of when it's going to apply you
 
00:54:51.170 --> 00:54:51.180 align:start position:0%
hear some people who get arrested a
 
00:54:52.910 --> 00:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
second time and they're held and someone
 
00:54:55.130 --> 00:54:55.140 align:start position:0%
else doesn't and they they make all
 
00:54:57.230 --> 00:54:57.240 align:start position:0%
sorts of theories why and rather than
 
00:54:59.210 --> 00:54:59.220 align:start position:0%
have that debate this is a clear policy
 
00:55:02.210 --> 00:55:02.220 align:start position:0%
it's it's not it's not subject to debate
 
00:55:04.250 --> 00:55:04.260 align:start position:0%
it's very straightforward of when it
 
00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
would apply so perhaps that when people
 
00:55:08.990 --> 00:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
say taking the discretion away that's
 
00:55:10.970 --> 00:55:10.980 align:start position:0%
discretion does lead to some people to
 
00:55:13.309 --> 00:55:13.319 align:start position:0%
speculate on why this you know
 
00:55:15.890 --> 00:55:15.900 align:start position:0%
statistics suggesting these laws are
 
00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
having a disproportionate impact on
 
00:55:18.829 --> 00:55:18.839 align:start position:0%
certain communities well when there's a
 
00:55:22.250 --> 00:55:22.260 align:start position:0%
clear unambiguous law of when a person
 
00:55:24.349 --> 00:55:24.359 align:start position:0%
is going to likely be held
 
00:55:26.270 --> 00:55:26.280 align:start position:0%
I think that's a better policy for
 
00:55:27.710 --> 00:55:27.720 align:start position:0%
people to follow I think it will be
 
00:55:33.230 --> 00:55:33.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:36.109 --> 00:55:36.119 align:start position:0%
represent Prue
 
00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
so we just had a question of whether
 
00:55:40.190 --> 00:55:40.200 align:start position:0%
this is going to cost more or not but in
 
00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
my head and I'm asking you whether you
 
00:55:43.970 --> 00:55:43.980 align:start position:0%
agree with me or not there's the
 
00:55:43.980 --> 00:55:45.230 align:start position:0%
agree with me or not there's the
question

00:55:45.230 --> 00:55:45.240 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:47.809 align:start position:0%
question
um

00:55:47.809 --> 00:55:47.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
if they don't get released after the
 
00:55:52.309 --> 00:55:52.319 align:start position:0%
third time and they've been known to
 
00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
go out five times as two more uh
 
00:55:57.470 --> 00:55:57.480 align:start position:0%
arraignment hearings that don't have to
 
00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
happen because they're in jail until
 
00:56:04.130 --> 00:56:04.140 align:start position:0%
these other cases are taken care of
 
00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
would you agree to that I most certainly
 
00:56:09.290 --> 00:56:09.300 align:start position:0%
do to give an exact a specific answer on
 
00:56:12.109 --> 00:56:12.119 align:start position:0%
what the fiscal impact would be no way
 
00:56:13.609 --> 00:56:13.619 align:start position:0%
to actually determine that but I think
 
00:56:14.930 --> 00:56:14.940 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of
 
00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
administrative and savings and Community
 
00:56:19.069 --> 00:56:19.079 align:start position:0%
Savings especially on the law
 
00:56:20.390 --> 00:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement side and the court side
 
00:56:23.809 --> 00:56:23.819 align:start position:0%
that's often gets overlooked
 
00:56:25.609 --> 00:56:25.619 align:start position:0%
and wouldn't you agree that community be
 
00:56:28.670 --> 00:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
would be safer if that drunk driver was
 
00:56:30.650 --> 00:56:30.660 align:start position:0%
off the road after the third time
 
00:56:32.930 --> 00:56:32.940 align:start position:0%
permanently until he gets addressed
 
00:56:34.670 --> 00:56:34.680 align:start position:0%
instead of two more times
 
00:56:37.250 --> 00:56:37.260 align:start position:0%
and yes
 
00:56:39.710 --> 00:56:39.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:41.230 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:56:41.230 --> 00:56:41.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:43.490 --> 00:56:43.500 align:start position:0%
representative Adams I have a question
 
00:56:45.049 --> 00:56:45.059 align:start position:0%
um do you have
 
00:56:49.130 --> 00:56:49.140 align:start position:0%
or a number of any idea how often this
 
00:56:50.930 --> 00:56:50.940 align:start position:0%
would actually I mean how often do do we
 
00:56:52.670 --> 00:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
know how and people who have been
 
00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
arrested a fourth time while on bail is
 
00:56:56.690 --> 00:56:56.700 align:start position:0%
is there any examples of this actually
 
00:56:56.700 --> 00:56:58.010 align:start position:0%
is there any examples of this actually
happening

00:56:58.010 --> 00:56:58.020 align:start position:0%
happening
 
00:56:59.390 --> 00:56:59.400 align:start position:0%
well I did give the drunk driving
 
00:57:01.430 --> 00:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
example that was one and that was again
 
00:57:03.530 --> 00:57:03.540 align:start position:0%
that was five times in a two-month time
 
00:57:06.950 --> 00:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
period it does happen a lot you know
 
00:57:08.990 --> 00:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
with drug offenses it happens a lot with
 
00:57:10.670 --> 00:57:10.680 align:start position:0%
domestic violence offenses
 
00:57:12.829 --> 00:57:12.839 align:start position:0%
so you're dealing with people who you
 
00:57:14.210 --> 00:57:14.220 align:start position:0%
know it's not just the substance abuse
 
00:57:16.370 --> 00:57:16.380 align:start position:0%
it's that that person is more likely to
 
00:57:18.650 --> 00:57:18.660 align:start position:0%
commit you know breaking enterings
 
00:57:20.150 --> 00:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
robbery stuff like that so you have
 
00:57:23.930 --> 00:57:23.940 align:start position:0%
other high-level offenses that are um
 
00:57:25.970 --> 00:57:25.980 align:start position:0%
sometimes the byproduct untreated mental
 
00:57:27.950 --> 00:57:27.960 align:start position:0%
health issues but at the same time if
 
00:57:29.270 --> 00:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
we're not gonna if we're gonna let the
 
00:57:31.250 --> 00:57:31.260 align:start position:0%
person out to their own Peril we're not
 
00:57:32.870 --> 00:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily doing them any favors so
 
00:57:34.549 --> 00:57:34.559 align:start position:0%
there are some benefits of having a
 
00:57:36.829 --> 00:57:36.839 align:start position:0%
person in a crisis and not letting them
 
00:57:39.170 --> 00:57:39.180 align:start position:0%
harm themselves or others so there is
 
00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:45.710 --> 00:57:45.720 align:start position:0%
so you know further questions oh is
 
00:57:47.109 --> 00:57:47.119 align:start position:0%
there aside that again
 
00:57:49.490 --> 00:57:49.500 align:start position:0%
I don't know whether this is in order
 
00:57:53.329 --> 00:57:53.339 align:start position:0%
but if I may let me say this I don't
 
00:57:55.910 --> 00:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
think I'm required here but out under
 
00:57:57.470 --> 00:57:57.480 align:start position:0%
ethics to say that I'm a bail
 
00:57:59.650 --> 00:57:59.660 align:start position:0%
commissioner I will under the next bill
 
00:58:03.710 --> 00:58:03.720 align:start position:0%
252. but I'll say it anyway I do I up to
 
00:58:05.690 --> 00:58:05.700 align:start position:0%
I've done it for 22 years I'm up to
 
00:58:09.410 --> 00:58:09.420 align:start position:0%
about 3 300 Bales I see one a year
 
00:58:12.770 --> 00:58:12.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:16.010 --> 00:58:16.020 align:start position:0%
that is somebody violating failed
 
00:58:18.890 --> 00:58:18.900 align:start position:0%
conditions that have before their trial
 
00:58:23.690 --> 00:58:23.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:26.210 --> 00:58:26.220 align:start position:0%
I can say in my humble opinion I've I've
 
00:58:27.950 --> 00:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
seen it not necessarily in courts in
 
00:58:30.470 --> 00:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
this state but I've sat in courthouses
 
00:58:32.150 --> 00:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
watching multiple and I've represented
 
00:58:35.089 --> 00:58:35.099 align:start position:0%
individuals who violated their bail by
 
00:58:36.890 --> 00:58:36.900 align:start position:0%
getting arrested for the same offense
 
00:58:36.900 --> 00:58:39.109 align:start position:0%
getting arrested for the same offense
and

00:58:39.109 --> 00:58:39.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:58:41.210 --> 00:58:41.220 align:start position:0%
managed to argue with successful bail
 
00:58:42.530 --> 00:58:42.540 align:start position:0%
hearing by having that person released
 
00:58:44.569 --> 00:58:44.579 align:start position:0%
again so I've seen it happen
 
00:58:46.730 --> 00:58:46.740 align:start position:0%
several times and I've heard about it
 
00:58:48.470 --> 00:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
happening several times and I read about
 
00:58:50.750 --> 00:58:50.760 align:start position:0%
it and um I would watch other hearings
 
00:58:52.670 --> 00:58:52.680 align:start position:0%
that I'm not involved in so I've seen it
 
00:58:54.109 --> 00:58:54.119 align:start position:0%
happen and not necessarily in the state
 
00:58:56.329 --> 00:58:56.339 align:start position:0%
but it does happen and I think having
 
00:58:57.950 --> 00:58:57.960 align:start position:0%
this policy this way
 
00:58:59.809 --> 00:58:59.819 align:start position:0%
creates a clear policy and it's
 
00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
happening more in some of the higher
 
00:59:04.130 --> 00:59:04.140 align:start position:0%
crime areas specifically Manchester and
 
00:59:06.410 --> 00:59:06.420 align:start position:0%
Nashville is where this happens uh more
 
00:59:11.089 --> 00:59:11.099 align:start position:0%
frequently High higher populated areas
 
00:59:11.099 --> 00:59:14.329 align:start position:0%
frequently High higher populated areas
representative

00:59:14.329 --> 00:59:14.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:16.789 --> 00:59:16.799 align:start position:0%
thank you just one quick question
 
00:59:18.049 --> 00:59:18.059 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry if this was already covered
 
00:59:20.329 --> 00:59:20.339 align:start position:0%
but can you speak to the first paragraph
 
00:59:21.710 --> 00:59:21.720 align:start position:0%
of the fiscal note where the judicial
 
00:59:23.150 --> 00:59:23.160 align:start position:0%
branch says that
 
00:59:24.950 --> 00:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
um that the way that this bill is
 
00:59:27.950 --> 00:59:27.960 align:start position:0%
written is unclear to them
 
00:59:29.630 --> 00:59:29.640 align:start position:0%
that they don't know how to
 
00:59:31.370 --> 00:59:31.380 align:start position:0%
enforce it
 
00:59:33.530 --> 00:59:33.540 align:start position:0%
I believe the judicial branch will be
 
00:59:34.910 --> 00:59:34.920 align:start position:0%
here so you can ask them that question
 
00:59:36.829 --> 00:59:36.839 align:start position:0%
since they I don't think that he can
 
00:59:39.289 --> 00:59:39.299 align:start position:0%
really speak to them unless you can
 
00:59:41.930 --> 00:59:41.940 align:start position:0%
represent Senator Evans so I think the
 
00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
the problem is is that the law there is
 
00:59:46.370 --> 00:59:46.380 align:start position:0%
a rebuttable presumption on the existing
 
00:59:48.470 --> 00:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
law it's just it's not being applied
 
00:59:51.230 --> 00:59:51.240 align:start position:0%
correctly or consists on consistently
 
00:59:53.030 --> 00:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
but it also
 
00:59:54.950 --> 00:59:54.960 align:start position:0%
the other problem you're having is even
 
00:59:56.450 --> 00:59:56.460 align:start position:0%
if you have that rebuttable presumption
 
00:59:58.849 --> 00:59:58.859 align:start position:0%
the law is not clearly expressing what
 
01:00:01.130 --> 01:00:01.140 align:start position:0%
happens in order for you to rebut that
 
01:00:02.930 --> 01:00:02.940 align:start position:0%
presumption what needs to be done and
 
01:00:04.789 --> 01:00:04.799 align:start position:0%
what would happen if you do or don't so
 
01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
even if you don't rebut the presumption
 
01:00:09.109 --> 01:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
people are being still being released
 
01:00:11.809 --> 01:00:11.819 align:start position:0%
so it seems to be applied differently uh
 
01:00:13.970 --> 01:00:13.980 align:start position:0%
depending on where where you're getting
 
01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:18.710 --> 01:00:18.720 align:start position:0%
I promise I
 
01:00:20.809 --> 01:00:20.819 align:start position:0%
promise I'm dragging this out
 
01:00:23.030 --> 01:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
the if you look at the paragraph It's
 
01:00:25.010 --> 01:00:25.020 align:start position:0%
specifically confused about
 
01:00:27.470 --> 01:00:27.480 align:start position:0%
how to implement
 
01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:30.710 align:start position:0%
how to implement
um when

01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:32.809 --> 01:00:32.819 align:start position:0%
when certain
 
01:00:35.450 --> 01:00:35.460 align:start position:0%
activities need to occur that they're
 
01:00:35.460 --> 01:00:36.890 align:start position:0%
activities need to occur that they're
saying

01:00:36.890 --> 01:00:36.900 align:start position:0%
saying
 
01:00:39.470 --> 01:00:39.480 align:start position:0%
that they don't understand
 
01:00:41.569 --> 01:00:41.579 align:start position:0%
I mean they're here right so maybe they
 
01:00:42.950 --> 01:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
can just speak to that but it seems like
 
01:00:43.789 --> 01:00:43.799 align:start position:0%
they're saying that they don't
 
01:00:46.789 --> 01:00:46.799 align:start position:0%
understand like which arrest
 
01:00:47.930 --> 01:00:47.940 align:start position:0%
um and that it's specifically like a
 
01:00:49.910 --> 01:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
wording issue with the bill I don't know
 
01:00:51.589 --> 01:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
so what what's written there is they're
 
01:00:53.870 --> 01:00:53.880 align:start position:0%
not clear about what happens with the
 
01:00:55.789 --> 01:00:55.799 align:start position:0%
second offense the second offense has to
 
01:00:56.930 --> 01:00:56.940 align:start position:0%
still be open
 
01:00:58.970 --> 01:00:58.980 align:start position:0%
so if you if you read this as it's
 
01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:05.750 align:start position:0%
so if you if you read this as it's
written

01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:08.450 --> 01:01:08.460 align:start position:0%
so if this problem cause to believe that
 
01:01:10.970 --> 01:01:10.980 align:start position:0%
a person well on release pending a
 
01:01:13.309 --> 01:01:13.319 align:start position:0%
resolution for prior offense so you have
 
01:01:14.809 --> 01:01:14.819 align:start position:0%
that's your first
 
01:01:16.549 --> 01:01:16.559 align:start position:0%
all right then if you go to the next
 
01:01:18.349 --> 01:01:18.359 align:start position:0%
part it says they committed the felony
 
01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
Class A misdemeanor
 
01:01:22.730 --> 01:01:22.740 align:start position:0%
what um or drunk driving
 
01:01:24.650 --> 01:01:24.660 align:start position:0%
while released unveiled thereafter was
 
01:01:27.289 --> 01:01:27.299 align:start position:0%
arrested for a third felony so you're
 
01:01:28.730 --> 01:01:28.740 align:start position:0%
talking about your first offense you've
 
01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
now been arrested two more times
 
01:01:34.069 --> 01:01:34.079 align:start position:0%
so it says third offense so I can't not
 
01:01:36.170 --> 01:01:36.180 align:start position:0%
sure if you how to explain that
 
01:01:37.910 --> 01:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
any clearance your third offense based
 
01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:39.720 align:start position:0%
on being released on the first that's
 
01:01:41.210 --> 01:01:41.220 align:start position:0%
okay we'll get the the court we'll
 
01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
explain what their thinking was
 
01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:44.210 align:start position:0%
explain what their thinking was
um

01:01:44.210 --> 01:01:44.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:46.010 --> 01:01:46.020 align:start position:0%
so you know further questions thank you
 
01:01:47.809 --> 01:01:47.819 align:start position:0%
representative uh Senator Abbas excuse
 
01:01:47.819 --> 01:01:50.030 align:start position:0%
representative uh Senator Abbas excuse
me

01:01:50.030 --> 01:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:56.030 --> 01:01:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:11.630 --> 01:02:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:13.789 --> 01:02:13.799 align:start position:0%
good morning uh my name is David
 
01:02:16.789 --> 01:02:16.799 align:start position:0%
Rothstein I was a public defender for
 
01:02:19.910 --> 01:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
over 30 years I was one of the directors
 
01:02:23.270 --> 01:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
of the program and I am now in private
 
01:02:25.490 --> 01:02:25.500 align:start position:0%
practice and Exeter focusing largely on
 
01:02:28.190 --> 01:02:28.200 align:start position:0%
criminal defense and I'm here on behalf
 
01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire Association of
 
01:02:31.970 --> 01:02:31.980 align:start position:0%
criminal defense lawyers having listened
 
01:02:34.970 --> 01:02:34.980 align:start position:0%
to uh the senator and to the questions
 
01:02:36.650 --> 01:02:36.660 align:start position:0%
that the committee's already asked I
 
01:02:38.690 --> 01:02:38.700 align:start position:0%
think really covered
 
01:02:40.910 --> 01:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
primarily the points that I was going to
 
01:02:43.130 --> 01:02:43.140 align:start position:0%
make so I'll be even briefer than five
 
01:02:46.849 --> 01:02:46.859 align:start position:0%
minutes first of all I do believe in
 
01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
response to a couple of of the questions
 
01:02:52.490 --> 01:02:52.500 align:start position:0%
that the language already exists in the
 
01:02:55.789 --> 01:02:55.799 align:start position:0%
present statute even with a second uh
 
01:02:55.799 --> 01:02:56.950 align:start position:0%
present statute even with a second uh
offense

01:02:56.950 --> 01:02:56.960 align:start position:0%
offense
 
01:02:59.569 --> 01:02:59.579 align:start position:0%
for example the language in this present
 
01:03:02.089 --> 01:03:02.099 align:start position:0%
statute is if you are released on bail
 
01:03:04.309 --> 01:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
and there's probable cause to believe
 
01:03:05.870 --> 01:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
that while released you committed
 
01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
another offense there is already the
 
01:03:11.450 --> 01:03:11.460 align:start position:0%
mechanism the Machinery to do exactly
 
01:03:14.270 --> 01:03:14.280 align:start position:0%
what this bill would would call for on a
 
01:03:16.910 --> 01:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
second offense so obviously it would be
 
01:03:18.589 --> 01:03:18.599 align:start position:0%
applied to a third offense or a fourth
 
01:03:21.109 --> 01:03:21.119 align:start position:0%
offense so this statute has become
 
01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
very complicated with a lot of different
 
01:03:26.329 --> 01:03:26.339 align:start position:0%
provisions and a lot of different
 
01:03:26.339 --> 01:03:26.930 align:start position:0%
provisions and a lot of different
um

01:03:26.930 --> 01:03:26.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:29.809 --> 01:03:29.819 align:start position:0%
permutations and if it if the language
 
01:03:32.510 --> 01:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
already exists and is clear which I
 
01:03:34.430 --> 01:03:34.440 align:start position:0%
believe it is I don't I don't see the
 
01:03:36.349 --> 01:03:36.359 align:start position:0%
need for an amendment
 
01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
um on top of that I would comment on
 
01:03:44.630 --> 01:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
the language issue is one thing but I I
 
01:03:47.210 --> 01:03:47.220 align:start position:0%
have spoken I think to a number of
 
01:03:49.910 --> 01:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
familiar faces in another session I
 
01:03:52.130 --> 01:03:52.140 align:start position:0%
think there are resource issues and in
 
01:03:53.930 --> 01:03:53.940 align:start position:0%
this state that are very difficult to
 
01:03:56.569 --> 01:03:56.579 align:start position:0%
get a hold of uh and a grip on one of
 
01:03:57.890 --> 01:03:57.900 align:start position:0%
the resource issues that I've heard
 
01:03:59.630 --> 01:03:59.640 align:start position:0%
before is sometimes a bail commissioner
 
01:04:00.950 --> 01:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't know
 
01:04:03.289 --> 01:04:03.299 align:start position:0%
the whole situation when somebody has
 
01:04:05.270 --> 01:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
been rearrested so that's an information
 
01:04:08.809 --> 01:04:08.819 align:start position:0%
situation that has to be addressed at
 
01:04:11.329 --> 01:04:11.339 align:start position:0%
the local level there's uh J-1 which a
 
01:04:13.190 --> 01:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
lot of people have access to in terms of
 
01:04:15.109 --> 01:04:15.119 align:start position:0%
getting information
 
01:04:16.849 --> 01:04:16.859 align:start position:0%
um so that's that's not an issue that
 
01:04:19.490 --> 01:04:19.500 align:start position:0%
this statute can address there are also
 
01:04:21.950 --> 01:04:21.960 align:start position:0%
issues on the setting of bail and
 
01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
getting enough information about the
 
01:04:25.670 --> 01:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
person that you have before you when you
 
01:04:27.650 --> 01:04:27.660 align:start position:0%
set bail when I was here before I talked
 
01:04:30.170 --> 01:04:30.180 align:start position:0%
about how short notice you have when
 
01:04:31.730 --> 01:04:31.740 align:start position:0%
somebody's rearrested you have to hold
 
01:04:34.010 --> 01:04:34.020 align:start position:0%
one of these hearings the prosecutor the
 
01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
judge the defense attorney don't know
 
01:04:38.569 --> 01:04:38.579 align:start position:0%
very much about the person if you have a
 
01:04:40.069 --> 01:04:40.079 align:start position:0%
county where there's pre-trial Services
 
01:04:42.109 --> 01:04:42.119 align:start position:0%
where they can do an interview of the
 
01:04:44.510 --> 01:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
person before the bail hearing like in
 
01:04:45.890 --> 01:04:45.900 align:start position:0%
the federal system you get a lot more
 
01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
information about the person they can
 
01:04:49.549 --> 01:04:49.559 align:start position:0%
run a record on the person they can try
 
01:04:51.130 --> 01:04:51.140 align:start position:0%
to confirm some of their information
 
01:04:53.510 --> 01:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
this happens in some counties it doesn't
 
01:04:55.849 --> 01:04:55.859 align:start position:0%
happen in others but again that's an
 
01:04:58.130 --> 01:04:58.140 align:start position:0%
implementation issue rather than a
 
01:05:00.710 --> 01:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
language issue and finally in response
 
01:05:02.870 --> 01:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
to I believe one of the the questions
 
01:05:06.710 --> 01:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
there is a need for flexibility even in
 
01:05:09.289 --> 01:05:09.299 align:start position:0%
a repeated arrest scenario now I have a
 
01:05:11.089 --> 01:05:11.099 align:start position:0%
different perspective on repeated
 
01:05:13.190 --> 01:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
arrests from my perspective if I'm
 
01:05:15.410 --> 01:05:15.420 align:start position:0%
representing somebody who's been out on
 
01:05:17.809 --> 01:05:17.819 align:start position:0%
bail commits one new offense commits two
 
01:05:20.510 --> 01:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
new offenses it's going to be very very
 
01:05:22.609 --> 01:05:22.619 align:start position:0%
difficult from my perspective as a
 
01:05:24.530 --> 01:05:24.540 align:start position:0%
practical matter to get that person
 
01:05:27.650 --> 01:05:27.660 align:start position:0%
released again on bail however there are
 
01:05:29.870 --> 01:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
still individual circumstances to take
 
01:05:32.510 --> 01:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
into account if the person is getting
 
01:05:35.930 --> 01:05:35.940 align:start position:0%
rearrested for a violent offense if the
 
01:05:37.190 --> 01:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
person is getting arrested for
 
01:05:39.289 --> 01:05:39.299 align:start position:0%
escalating offenses the chances of them
 
01:05:41.329 --> 01:05:41.339 align:start position:0%
being released and I know you've had an
 
01:05:43.490 --> 01:05:43.500 align:start position:0%
opportunity to talk to some judges are
 
01:05:45.470 --> 01:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
incredibly incredibly slim as a
 
01:05:48.049 --> 01:05:48.059 align:start position:0%
practical matter however most of the new
 
01:05:50.089 --> 01:05:50.099 align:start position:0%
offenses that people get released on are
 
01:05:52.970 --> 01:05:52.980 align:start position:0%
not violent mostly you do not have the
 
01:05:55.549 --> 01:05:55.559 align:start position:0%
five DWIs or five armed robberies and
 
01:05:57.289 --> 01:05:57.299 align:start position:0%
people getting released and committing
 
01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
new offenses it's usually attributable
 
01:06:03.650 --> 01:06:03.660 align:start position:0%
to substance use disorder and mental
 
01:06:06.470 --> 01:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
health issues and to put people in jail
 
01:06:09.650 --> 01:06:09.660 align:start position:0%
for potentially a very long time is not
 
01:06:11.809 --> 01:06:11.819 align:start position:0%
the best solution the jails are not
 
01:06:14.510 --> 01:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
outfitted to help people these people
 
01:06:16.190 --> 01:06:16.200 align:start position:0%
are going to be released the jails are
 
01:06:18.230 --> 01:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
not outfitted to get these people what
 
01:06:19.730 --> 01:06:19.740 align:start position:0%
they need so that when they get back
 
01:06:21.710 --> 01:06:21.720 align:start position:0%
into the community they're less likely
 
01:06:23.049 --> 01:06:23.059 align:start position:0%
to reoffend
 
01:06:26.450 --> 01:06:26.460 align:start position:0%
in some counties there is an active
 
01:06:28.910 --> 01:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
pre-trial release program where people
 
01:06:31.309 --> 01:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
actually connect with the person and
 
01:06:32.930 --> 01:06:32.940 align:start position:0%
they figure out what they need and they
 
01:06:34.490 --> 01:06:34.500 align:start position:0%
supervise them in the community and they
 
01:06:36.170 --> 01:06:36.180 align:start position:0%
can get them into long-term drug
 
01:06:38.329 --> 01:06:38.339 align:start position:0%
treatment they can get them into mental
 
01:06:39.529 --> 01:06:39.539 align:start position:0%
health treatment
 
01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
the state is a a great place but it's so
 
01:06:45.230 --> 01:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
variable County to county that in some
 
01:06:47.029 --> 01:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
counties like in Hillsborough County our
 
01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
biggest County where there's probably
 
01:06:50.150 --> 01:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
the most crime and the most serious
 
01:06:52.930 --> 01:06:52.940 align:start position:0%
crime we don't have that type of program
 
01:06:56.029 --> 01:06:56.039 align:start position:0%
I think that again I think it's not so
 
01:06:58.730 --> 01:06:58.740 align:start position:0%
much a language issue as it is an
 
01:07:00.170 --> 01:07:00.180 align:start position:0%
implementation issue and while I
 
01:07:01.849 --> 01:07:01.859 align:start position:0%
understand certainly the point that the
 
01:07:04.370 --> 01:07:04.380 align:start position:0%
senator made quite a valid point quite
 
01:07:05.569 --> 01:07:05.579 align:start position:0%
frustrating when somebody gets
 
01:07:07.789 --> 01:07:07.799 align:start position:0%
rearrested I do think the language here
 
01:07:10.370 --> 01:07:10.380 align:start position:0%
already exists and the energy should be
 
01:07:11.950 --> 01:07:11.960 align:start position:0%
put into trying to develop
 
01:07:15.710 --> 01:07:15.720 align:start position:0%
implementation resources so that people
 
01:07:18.170 --> 01:07:18.180 align:start position:0%
are less likely to reoffend and I'd be
 
01:07:20.390 --> 01:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
glad to take any questions
 
01:07:24.049 --> 01:07:24.059 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:25.609 --> 01:07:25.619 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question maybe it's
 
01:07:27.049 --> 01:07:27.059 align:start position:0%
not in your wheelhouse
 
01:07:29.029 --> 01:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
um I know that about half this committee
 
01:07:31.250 --> 01:07:31.260 align:start position:0%
represents Hillsborough County
 
01:07:34.010 --> 01:07:34.020 align:start position:0%
um do you know if someone is in the
 
01:07:37.309 --> 01:07:37.319 align:start position:0%
example of five DUIs if they're taken to
 
01:07:39.470 --> 01:07:39.480 align:start position:0%
County Jail are there um services
 
01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
available at Hillsborough County for
 
01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:42.829 align:start position:0%
available at Hillsborough County for
them

01:07:42.829 --> 01:07:42.839 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:07:46.250 --> 01:07:46.260 align:start position:0%
yeah Hillsborough County is historically
 
01:07:48.410 --> 01:07:48.420 align:start position:0%
it's obviously the biggest jail in the
 
01:07:49.730 --> 01:07:49.740 align:start position:0%
state because it serves the biggest
 
01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:51.069 align:start position:0%
state because it serves the biggest
population

01:07:51.069 --> 01:07:51.079 align:start position:0%
population
 
01:07:54.250 --> 01:07:54.260 align:start position:0%
historically in in my view it is
 
01:07:54.260 --> 01:07:56.109 align:start position:0%
historically in in my view it is
chronically

01:07:56.109 --> 01:07:56.119 align:start position:0%
chronically
 
01:08:00.190 --> 01:08:00.200 align:start position:0%
the one of the least capable of
 
01:08:03.529 --> 01:08:03.539 align:start position:0%
taking people in and providing them
 
01:08:06.349 --> 01:08:06.359 align:start position:0%
certainly pre-trial resources there is
 
01:08:08.089 --> 01:08:08.099 align:start position:0%
no pre-trial release program in
 
01:08:09.289 --> 01:08:09.299 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County as there is in
 
01:08:11.450 --> 01:08:11.460 align:start position:0%
Merrimack County Stratford County and I
 
01:08:13.549 --> 01:08:13.559 align:start position:0%
believe Cheshire county I think I think
 
01:08:15.230 --> 01:08:15.240 align:start position:0%
a program like that in Hillsborough
 
01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
County would be would be fantastic if it
 
01:08:20.209 --> 01:08:20.219 align:start position:0%
existed but you know we're talking about
 
01:08:21.950 --> 01:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
you're talking about County government I
 
01:08:24.169 --> 01:08:24.179 align:start position:0%
think I think it's very hard for you
 
01:08:27.169 --> 01:08:27.179 align:start position:0%
know for for a statute or for the state
 
01:08:30.169 --> 01:08:30.179 align:start position:0%
to force a county to develop these these
 
01:08:30.179 --> 01:08:35.390 align:start position:0%
to force a county to develop these these
programs

01:08:35.390 --> 01:08:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:38.150 --> 01:08:38.160 align:start position:0%
represent Pro
 
01:08:40.309 --> 01:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
you talked about the language is
 
01:08:43.070 --> 01:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
available at the second one yes but it's
 
01:08:45.169 --> 01:08:45.179 align:start position:0%
not mandatory it's not
 
01:08:47.329 --> 01:08:47.339 align:start position:0%
it's a it but it creates it's not
 
01:08:49.550 --> 01:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
mandatory uh uh representative proof but
 
01:08:53.570 --> 01:08:53.580 align:start position:0%
I I believe it's reasonably
 
01:08:56.090 --> 01:08:56.100 align:start position:0%
a mirror image of the proposed language
 
01:08:56.100 --> 01:08:57.470 align:start position:0%
a mirror image of the proposed language
except

01:08:57.470 --> 01:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
except
 
01:09:00.169 --> 01:09:00.179 align:start position:0%
I think you can do it the the second
 
01:09:02.930 --> 01:09:02.940 align:start position:0%
time as well if you're if if it as I
 
01:09:05.030 --> 01:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
read it if you are on release pending
 
01:09:07.610 --> 01:09:07.620 align:start position:0%
resolution of a prior offense and you
 
01:09:09.829 --> 01:09:09.839 align:start position:0%
commit a felony Class A misdemeanor or
 
01:09:11.689 --> 01:09:11.699 align:start position:0%
driving or operating on impaired there
 
01:09:13.309 --> 01:09:13.319 align:start position:0%
shall be a rebuttable presumption that
 
01:09:15.890 --> 01:09:15.900 align:start position:0%
the person will not be about abide and
 
01:09:17.749 --> 01:09:17.759 align:start position:0%
that means the result of that is if you
 
01:09:19.550 --> 01:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
don't need the rebuttal pool presumption
 
01:09:22.490 --> 01:09:22.500 align:start position:0%
then you can be detained I agree with
 
01:09:25.669 --> 01:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
you that this third offense language is
 
01:09:25.679 --> 01:09:26.749 align:start position:0%
you that this third offense language is
more

01:09:26.749 --> 01:09:26.759 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:09:28.789 --> 01:09:28.799 align:start position:0%
directive and I I think the senator
 
01:09:30.530 --> 01:09:30.540 align:start position:0%
talks about the importance of trying to
 
01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
perpetuate a a policy I I don't think I
 
01:09:36.050 --> 01:09:36.060 align:start position:0%
don't think that anyone including the
 
01:09:38.630 --> 01:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
judges you you met disagree with the
 
01:09:40.610 --> 01:09:40.620 align:start position:0%
fact that if someone comes on a second
 
01:09:44.090 --> 01:09:44.100 align:start position:0%
offense or third offense or more that
 
01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
it's highly highly likely the person is
 
01:09:47.809 --> 01:09:47.819 align:start position:0%
going to be detained as a practical
 
01:09:47.819 --> 01:09:50.150 align:start position:0%
going to be detained as a practical
matter

01:09:50.150 --> 01:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:51.769 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:09:51.769 --> 01:09:51.779 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:09:54.050 --> 01:09:54.060 align:start position:0%
I know in my city
 
01:09:56.330 --> 01:09:56.340 align:start position:0%
it was a revolving door so they weren't
 
01:09:57.890 --> 01:09:57.900 align:start position:0%
using the second one
 
01:10:01.010 --> 01:10:01.020 align:start position:0%
or the third one or the fourth one
 
01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:03.960 align:start position:0%
so I think then I'm all set for putting
 
01:10:06.110 --> 01:10:06.120 align:start position:0%
in mandatory to the second one if I
 
01:10:07.910 --> 01:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
thought it would pass right
 
01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
but I'm kind of liking the at least the
 
01:10:12.290 --> 01:10:12.300 align:start position:0%
third one they need to be held and right
 
01:10:14.330 --> 01:10:14.340 align:start position:0%
and I understand there's other programs
 
01:10:16.370 --> 01:10:16.380 align:start position:0%
that they can go into
 
01:10:18.770 --> 01:10:18.780 align:start position:0%
and maybe being held they can get put
 
01:10:20.930 --> 01:10:20.940 align:start position:0%
into those programs
 
01:10:30.410 --> 01:10:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:35.510 --> 01:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question if if um
 
01:10:42.470 --> 01:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
if mental health and drug issues are
 
01:10:45.470 --> 01:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
are really the root cause of a lot of
 
01:10:49.430 --> 01:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
the the reoffensives that we're seeing
 
01:10:51.470 --> 01:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
and we passed this bill
 
01:10:53.810 --> 01:10:53.820 align:start position:0%
so we're in a situation where we're not
 
01:10:57.410 --> 01:10:57.420 align:start position:0%
only holding more people pre-detension
 
01:10:59.510 --> 01:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
but a lot of the people that we're
 
01:11:03.410 --> 01:11:03.420 align:start position:0%
holding are problematic from you know
 
01:11:05.090 --> 01:11:05.100 align:start position:0%
from a drug in a mental health
 
01:11:08.510 --> 01:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
standpoint you said that there's a lot
 
01:11:10.850 --> 01:11:10.860 align:start position:0%
of variability uh between the counties
 
01:11:12.830 --> 01:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
and how these cases are treated what
 
01:11:15.410 --> 01:11:15.420 align:start position:0%
about the help that somebody can
 
01:11:18.310 --> 01:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
actually get while they're behind bars
 
01:11:21.490 --> 01:11:21.500 align:start position:0%
can they get any
 
01:11:25.189 --> 01:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
well they really can't I mean I I can
 
01:11:27.470 --> 01:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
relate a story I had with somebody who
 
01:11:30.410 --> 01:11:30.420 align:start position:0%
had serious uh mental health issues very
 
01:11:31.790 --> 01:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
serious mental health issues that
 
01:11:33.470 --> 01:11:33.480 align:start position:0%
rendered him
 
01:11:35.630 --> 01:11:35.640 align:start position:0%
um incompetent and the jail said in
 
01:11:37.790 --> 01:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
terms of mental health issues
 
01:11:40.729 --> 01:11:40.739 align:start position:0%
you know we offer very limited like you
 
01:11:42.290 --> 01:11:42.300 align:start position:0%
know once a week they can talk to a
 
01:11:44.930 --> 01:11:44.940 align:start position:0%
counselor uh it's all voluntary
 
01:11:47.030 --> 01:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
their their view on mental health is
 
01:11:48.530 --> 01:11:48.540 align:start position:0%
that if the person's mental health
 
01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
issues are not disrupting the facility
 
01:11:53.149 --> 01:11:53.159 align:start position:0%
in other words if they're not creating a
 
01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
safety concern in the jail then I mean
 
01:11:58.790 --> 01:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
they really don't become proactive in
 
01:12:00.530 --> 01:12:00.540 align:start position:0%
terms of trying to involve that person
 
01:12:02.510 --> 01:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
in mental health counseling so the
 
01:12:05.030 --> 01:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
person is you know is is sitting in in a
 
01:12:06.770 --> 01:12:06.780 align:start position:0%
jail I think any of us even those of us
 
01:12:08.330 --> 01:12:08.340 align:start position:0%
who hopefully have
 
01:12:10.610 --> 01:12:10.620 align:start position:0%
good mental health and don't suffer from
 
01:12:14.149 --> 01:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
from substance use issues would decline
 
01:12:17.450 --> 01:12:17.460 align:start position:0%
significantly if we were incarcerated if
 
01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:19.679 align:start position:0%
we were separated from our community and
 
01:12:20.930 --> 01:12:20.940 align:start position:0%
if we were
 
01:12:23.149 --> 01:12:23.159 align:start position:0%
um probably already untreated when we
 
01:12:25.189 --> 01:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
entered the jail the jails are the jails
 
01:12:27.830 --> 01:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
I think do by and large a very good job
 
01:12:29.390 --> 01:12:29.400 align:start position:0%
at what they're designed to do they are
 
01:12:32.090 --> 01:12:32.100 align:start position:0%
not designed to serve the function of
 
01:12:34.970 --> 01:12:34.980 align:start position:0%
providing rehabilitative services to
 
01:12:37.910 --> 01:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
people who struggle with chronic mental
 
01:12:40.669 --> 01:12:40.679 align:start position:0%
health issues or substance use issues I
 
01:12:42.169 --> 01:12:42.179 align:start position:0%
have heard that the jail if you're in
 
01:12:44.630 --> 01:12:44.640 align:start position:0%
withdrawal I've heard it's just a
 
01:12:48.169 --> 01:12:48.179 align:start position:0%
terrible place to be if you're trying if
 
01:12:49.250 --> 01:12:49.260 align:start position:0%
you're going through the withdrawal
 
01:12:50.630 --> 01:12:50.640 align:start position:0%
symptoms and you're in jail they just
 
01:12:52.370 --> 01:12:52.380 align:start position:0%
don't they just don't have the resources
 
01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
what they have done over time is they
 
01:12:57.169 --> 01:12:57.179 align:start position:0%
have been able to get into giving
 
01:12:59.990 --> 01:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
medically assisted treatment to people
 
01:13:02.149 --> 01:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
who qualify and that can help some
 
01:13:05.149 --> 01:13:05.159 align:start position:0%
people but mental illness is a real I
 
01:13:07.010 --> 01:13:07.020 align:start position:0%
think if you went to the jail and you'd
 
01:13:09.169 --> 01:13:09.179 align:start position:0%
talk to people you would find
 
01:13:11.450 --> 01:13:11.460 align:start position:0%
just a stunning amount of mental illness
 
01:13:13.990 --> 01:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder and also
 
01:13:21.350 --> 01:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:23.870 --> 01:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
representative Newman
 
01:13:26.030 --> 01:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
yeah just to have a quick question my
 
01:13:28.970 --> 01:13:28.980 align:start position:0%
concern about this is the uh taking
 
01:13:31.370 --> 01:13:31.380 align:start position:0%
discretion away from judges and bail
 
01:13:31.380 --> 01:13:32.689 align:start position:0%
discretion away from judges and bail
commissioners

01:13:32.689 --> 01:13:32.699 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
01:13:34.669 --> 01:13:34.679 align:start position:0%
and one of my concerns is according to
 
01:13:37.010 --> 01:13:37.020 align:start position:0%
the way I read the bill
 
01:13:40.490 --> 01:13:40.500 align:start position:0%
all three of the all of three of the
 
01:13:42.890 --> 01:13:42.900 align:start position:0%
offenses that they may have been bailed
 
01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:43.610 align:start position:0%
offenses that they may have been bailed
on

01:13:43.610 --> 01:13:43.620 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:13:46.310 --> 01:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
could have been I don't want to say
 
01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
low-level offenses for driving while
 
01:13:50.870 --> 01:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
intoxicated I mean it could be they all
 
01:13:53.630 --> 01:13:53.640 align:start position:0%
did .12 or whatever the current level is
 
01:13:55.130 --> 01:13:55.140 align:start position:0%
or just above that
 
01:13:58.669 --> 01:13:58.679 align:start position:0%
somebody that maybe has a problem but
 
01:14:01.310 --> 01:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
not a really significant problem and and
 
01:14:03.110 --> 01:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
use misjudgment
 
01:14:06.530 --> 01:14:06.540 align:start position:0%
and got him him or herself arrested a
 
01:14:08.990 --> 01:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
third time is there a potential here
 
01:14:11.750 --> 01:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
that we could unknowingly unwittingly
 
01:14:14.169 --> 01:14:14.179 align:start position:0%
and unwantedly
 
01:14:17.390 --> 01:14:17.400 align:start position:0%
affecting those kind of people
 
01:14:19.550 --> 01:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
who have not been
 
01:14:22.189 --> 01:14:22.199 align:start position:0%
convicted of anything
 
01:14:25.550 --> 01:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
um more so even or more people even than
 
01:14:28.669 --> 01:14:28.679 align:start position:0%
how many are affected by the fourth
 
01:14:31.010 --> 01:14:31.020 align:start position:0%
fifth sixth seventh uh offense kind of
 
01:14:31.020 --> 01:14:32.330 align:start position:0%
fifth sixth seventh uh offense kind of
person

01:14:32.330 --> 01:14:32.340 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:14:34.130 --> 01:14:34.140 align:start position:0%
um I just believe that the judges and
 
01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
the bail Commissioners with the rules
 
01:14:37.669 --> 01:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
the way they're written now have the
 
01:14:40.370 --> 01:14:40.380 align:start position:0%
ability do you agree with that I I do
 
01:14:42.530 --> 01:14:42.540 align:start position:0%
agree representative I think that that
 
01:14:46.130 --> 01:14:46.140 align:start position:0%
you know we have to by and large trust
 
01:14:48.410 --> 01:14:48.420 align:start position:0%
the people who have
 
01:14:50.030 --> 01:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
um the local knowledge the people who
 
01:14:51.530 --> 01:14:51.540 align:start position:0%
are the judges the people who are the
 
01:14:54.350 --> 01:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
prosecutors to make those decisions I
 
01:14:56.090 --> 01:14:56.100 align:start position:0%
think by and large they make good
 
01:14:58.729 --> 01:14:58.739 align:start position:0%
decisions as I said if I am going to
 
01:15:00.890 --> 01:15:00.900 align:start position:0%
court and I am representing somebody
 
01:15:03.770 --> 01:15:03.780 align:start position:0%
who's a recidivist uh in this situation
 
01:15:06.229 --> 01:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
I'm going to do what I can as a defense
 
01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:08.280 align:start position:0%
attorney my ethical obligation is to if
 
01:15:10.970 --> 01:15:10.980 align:start position:0%
they want to be released and try to
 
01:15:12.590 --> 01:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
argue for their release I will tell you
 
01:15:15.050 --> 01:15:15.060 align:start position:0%
on one hand that that's very very
 
01:15:16.970 --> 01:15:16.980 align:start position:0%
difficult to do if someone is a repeat
 
01:15:19.010 --> 01:15:19.020 align:start position:0%
offender is a practical matter but on
 
01:15:20.870 --> 01:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
the other hand I do think that amount of
 
01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:21.850 align:start position:0%
the other hand I do think that amount of
discretion

01:15:21.850 --> 01:15:21.860 align:start position:0%
discretion
 
01:15:25.370 --> 01:15:25.380 align:start position:0%
is is very important and I do think we
 
01:15:26.630 --> 01:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
should trust the people at the local
 
01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
level to to by and large make those
 
01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:31.130 align:start position:0%
level to to by and large make those
decisions

01:15:31.130 --> 01:15:31.140 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
01:15:32.649 --> 01:15:32.659 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:15:37.610 --> 01:15:37.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:40.250 --> 01:15:40.260 align:start position:0%
and the chair recognizes Frank Knack
 
01:15:54.590 --> 01:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:56.330 --> 01:15:56.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
01:15:58.070 --> 01:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Frank Knack I'm the
 
01:15:59.689 --> 01:15:59.699 align:start position:0%
policy director with the ACLU of New
 
01:15:59.699 --> 01:16:01.010 align:start position:0%
policy director with the ACLU of New
Hampshire

01:16:01.010 --> 01:16:01.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:16:02.330 --> 01:16:02.340 align:start position:0%
um we will have a handout for the next
 
01:16:04.430 --> 01:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
bill I don't on this bill in part
 
01:16:06.890 --> 01:16:06.900 align:start position:0%
because we are still not 100 sure what
 
01:16:09.530 --> 01:16:09.540 align:start position:0%
the what the bill is trying to do I
 
01:16:11.930 --> 01:16:11.940 align:start position:0%
think we heard um the senator talk about
 
01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:14.580 align:start position:0%
the fact that this is really just trying
 
01:16:17.030 --> 01:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
to create after the third offense but if
 
01:16:18.229 --> 01:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
you look and I think there was questions
 
01:16:20.030 --> 01:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
about this if you look at how this
 
01:16:22.970 --> 01:16:22.980 align:start position:0%
language is drafted quote the person
 
01:16:24.890 --> 01:16:24.900 align:start position:0%
shall be detained in pre-trial detention
 
01:16:27.530 --> 01:16:27.540 align:start position:0%
based on a relatable presumption that
 
01:16:29.270 --> 01:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
the person shall be detained is new
 
01:16:30.649 --> 01:16:30.659 align:start position:0%
language that doesn't exist anywhere
 
01:16:32.149 --> 01:16:32.159 align:start position:0%
else that I've seen in the Bell statute
 
01:16:34.370 --> 01:16:34.380 align:start position:0%
so if you look at for example the
 
01:16:36.649 --> 01:16:36.659 align:start position:0%
failure appear section the rebuttable
 
01:16:38.149 --> 01:16:38.159 align:start position:0%
presumption is just that there shall be
 
01:16:40.310 --> 01:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
a rebuttable presumption but not that
 
01:16:42.229 --> 01:16:42.239 align:start position:0%
the person shall be detained and so this
 
01:16:43.850 --> 01:16:43.860 align:start position:0%
really makes us think that this is a
 
01:16:46.010 --> 01:16:46.020 align:start position:0%
backdoor three strikes law completely
 
01:16:47.870 --> 01:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
taking judicial discretion
 
01:16:49.970 --> 01:16:49.980 align:start position:0%
out of the statue and again we're also
 
01:16:53.450 --> 01:16:53.460 align:start position:0%
concerned that the pr bail option so
 
01:16:55.490 --> 01:16:55.500 align:start position:0%
that we are not having a two-tiered
 
01:16:57.410 --> 01:16:57.420 align:start position:0%
criminal legal system where people with
 
01:16:59.090 --> 01:16:59.100 align:start position:0%
wealth can pay for their freedom where
 
01:17:01.130 --> 01:17:01.140 align:start position:0%
people without wealth cannot
 
01:17:02.930 --> 01:17:02.940 align:start position:0%
um has been shipped from this
 
01:17:02.940 --> 01:17:03.890 align:start position:0%
um has been shipped from this
um

01:17:03.890 --> 01:17:03.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:06.169 --> 01:17:06.179 align:start position:0%
uh just a few other things that I want
 
01:17:07.430 --> 01:17:07.440 align:start position:0%
to touch on
 
01:17:09.350 --> 01:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
um is you know as you know we are in
 
01:17:12.410 --> 01:17:12.420 align:start position:0%
very uh great really appreciate and huge
 
01:17:14.330 --> 01:17:14.340 align:start position:0%
support of chairman Roy's addition to
 
01:17:16.250 --> 01:17:16.260 align:start position:0%
the budget around getting the funding in
 
01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
there to have a real-time Bill tracking
 
01:17:20.209 --> 01:17:20.219 align:start position:0%
system again we see no data that there's
 
01:17:21.890 --> 01:17:21.900 align:start position:0%
actually an issue Happening Here with
 
01:17:23.570 --> 01:17:23.580 align:start position:0%
people being released we've heard
 
01:17:25.970 --> 01:17:25.980 align:start position:0%
anecdotes but we have no hard data and
 
01:17:27.950 --> 01:17:27.960 align:start position:0%
so having this real-time system in place
 
01:17:30.229 --> 01:17:30.239 align:start position:0%
would ensure that if anyone making these
 
01:17:31.970 --> 01:17:31.980 align:start position:0%
important decisions has all that
 
01:17:33.709 --> 01:17:33.719 align:start position:0%
information in real time so that if
 
01:17:35.649 --> 01:17:35.659 align:start position:0%
someone's being released and getting
 
01:17:38.030 --> 01:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
rearrested that person making that
 
01:17:39.770 --> 01:17:39.780 align:start position:0%
decision has that information in real
 
01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
time we think that's an important step
 
01:17:43.930 --> 01:17:43.940 align:start position:0%
forward and one that does so without
 
01:17:46.130 --> 01:17:46.140 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily taking anyone's Liberty
 
01:17:47.870 --> 01:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
just making sure that we have all the
 
01:17:49.729 --> 01:17:49.739 align:start position:0%
information in place
 
01:17:52.370 --> 01:17:52.380 align:start position:0%
um again I I imagine Professor Cheryl
 
01:17:54.709 --> 01:17:54.719 align:start position:0%
will talk about this but we also have to
 
01:17:56.510 --> 01:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
can't ignore the fact that the data that
 
01:17:59.149 --> 01:17:59.159 align:start position:0%
he has collected shows that 36 percent
 
01:18:01.550 --> 01:18:01.560 align:start position:0%
of the cases that they looked at the
 
01:18:03.470 --> 01:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
cases the charges were later dismissed
 
01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
or null and so this notion that you know
 
01:18:07.189 --> 01:18:07.199 align:start position:0%
everyone who's getting arrested is
 
01:18:09.290 --> 01:18:09.300 align:start position:0%
guilty first of all that's not how our
 
01:18:10.729 --> 01:18:10.739 align:start position:0%
criminal legal system works and second
 
01:18:11.930 --> 01:18:11.940 align:start position:0%
of all that's not how it's working
 
01:18:14.090 --> 01:18:14.100 align:start position:0%
practically in New Hampshire 36 percent
 
01:18:15.950 --> 01:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
of the cases they looked at were later
 
01:18:18.169 --> 01:18:18.179 align:start position:0%
dismissed or null Prost and so the fact
 
01:18:19.610 --> 01:18:19.620 align:start position:0%
that people are going to be
 
01:18:21.229 --> 01:18:21.239 align:start position:0%
automatically detained and taken having
 
01:18:24.350 --> 01:18:24.360 align:start position:0%
their Liberty taken away is is troubling
 
01:18:26.090 --> 01:18:26.100 align:start position:0%
um and finally I think just kind of
 
01:18:27.709 --> 01:18:27.719 align:start position:0%
getting back to the public safety angle
 
01:18:29.030 --> 01:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
and again we'll talk about this on the
 
01:18:31.430 --> 01:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
next bill but there's a huge amount of
 
01:18:33.050 --> 01:18:33.060 align:start position:0%
research on this issue and so when we
 
01:18:34.729 --> 01:18:34.739 align:start position:0%
hear individuals talking about the fact
 
01:18:36.110 --> 01:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
that we need this to increase Public
 
01:18:39.050 --> 01:18:39.060 align:start position:0%
Safety the research says the opposite so
 
01:18:40.669 --> 01:18:40.679 align:start position:0%
there may be specific cases and that's
 
01:18:42.350 --> 01:18:42.360 align:start position:0%
why judicial discretion is important
 
01:18:44.750 --> 01:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
while someone should be detained based
 
01:18:46.490 --> 01:18:46.500 align:start position:0%
on this specific facts in that case and
 
01:18:47.630 --> 01:18:47.640 align:start position:0%
letting the court make that
 
01:18:49.970 --> 01:18:49.980 align:start position:0%
determination having these blankets
 
01:18:52.669 --> 01:18:52.679 align:start position:0%
whole of rules that people shall be
 
01:18:55.010 --> 01:18:55.020 align:start position:0%
detained goes against all the research
 
01:18:56.689 --> 01:18:56.699 align:start position:0%
on this issue because you're going to be
 
01:18:57.890 --> 01:18:57.900 align:start position:0%
pulling people away from their
 
01:18:59.630 --> 01:18:59.640 align:start position:0%
communities their job their
 
01:19:02.149 --> 01:19:02.159 align:start position:0%
responsibilities if they have child care
 
01:19:03.830 --> 01:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
or they're caring for elderly parents
 
01:19:06.950 --> 01:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
there's Myriad rays that people that the
 
01:19:08.930 --> 01:19:08.940 align:start position:0%
harms will just exacerbate if we're
 
01:19:11.149 --> 01:19:11.159 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily detaining people and I
 
01:19:13.250 --> 01:19:13.260 align:start position:0%
apologize we didn't have daycare today
 
01:19:15.350 --> 01:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
so this is my son
 
01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:15.950 align:start position:0%
so this is my son
um

01:19:15.950 --> 01:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:17.570 --> 01:19:17.580 align:start position:0%
so I thank you and happy to answer any
 
01:19:17.580 --> 01:19:19.490 align:start position:0%
so I thank you and happy to answer any
questions

01:19:19.490 --> 01:19:19.500 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:19:22.250 --> 01:19:22.260 align:start position:0%
fill out a pink card oh I'll have him do
 
01:19:22.260 --> 01:19:23.990 align:start position:0%
fill out a pink card oh I'll have him do
that

01:19:23.990 --> 01:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:19:26.990 --> 01:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
any questions uh representative Newell
 
01:19:28.490 --> 01:19:28.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:19:30.229 --> 01:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:19:31.669 --> 01:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
um I was wondering you know a lot of
 
01:19:33.950 --> 01:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
what this sounds like to me is
 
01:19:35.330 --> 01:19:35.340 align:start position:0%
um you know of course we're making it
 
01:19:37.010 --> 01:19:37.020 align:start position:0%
mandatory and of course to me that
 
01:19:39.050 --> 01:19:39.060 align:start position:0%
reminds me of mandatory minimums I would
 
01:19:40.130 --> 01:19:40.140 align:start position:0%
assume that that's kind of what you're
 
01:19:41.510 --> 01:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
talking about the research as far as
 
01:19:43.130 --> 01:19:43.140 align:start position:0%
when we take the discretion away and do
 
01:19:44.630 --> 01:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
that kind of stuff I was wondering if
 
01:19:46.669 --> 01:19:46.679 align:start position:0%
you could speak a little bit to that
 
01:19:48.590 --> 01:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
um you know I won't
 
01:19:50.870 --> 01:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
you share my own my own story of the
 
01:19:53.510 --> 01:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
impact of mandatory minimums on on my
 
01:19:55.550 --> 01:19:55.560 align:start position:0%
life but uh it was very very destructive
 
01:19:57.530 --> 01:19:57.540 align:start position:0%
as far as I'm concerned and so I'm I'm
 
01:19:59.689 --> 01:19:59.699 align:start position:0%
curious especially where that coincides
 
01:20:01.250 --> 01:20:01.260 align:start position:0%
with things like mental health and
 
01:20:04.250 --> 01:20:04.260 align:start position:0%
substance use and I'm sure you know from
 
01:20:06.530 --> 01:20:06.540 align:start position:0%
the ACLU you have probably a lot of
 
01:20:07.790 --> 01:20:07.800 align:start position:0%
information I was wondering if you could
 
01:20:09.050 --> 01:20:09.060 align:start position:0%
expand on that a little bit yeah
 
01:20:11.149 --> 01:20:11.159 align:start position:0%
absolutely you know that a little bit
 
01:20:12.169 --> 01:20:12.179 align:start position:0%
beyond what I was planning on talking
 
01:20:13.729 --> 01:20:13.739 align:start position:0%
about today so I can definitely send you
 
01:20:15.770 --> 01:20:15.780 align:start position:0%
all tons of research on the harms of
 
01:20:17.750 --> 01:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
mandatory minimums in the sentencing
 
01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:18.590 align:start position:0%
mandatory minimums in the sentencing
phase

01:20:18.590 --> 01:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
phase
 
01:20:20.870 --> 01:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
um not in the pre-trial phase but again
 
01:20:23.090 --> 01:20:23.100 align:start position:0%
with that you know we saw that Evolution
 
01:20:24.830 --> 01:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
really started in the early 80s and kind
 
01:20:26.030 --> 01:20:26.040 align:start position:0%
of perpetuate
 
01:20:28.070 --> 01:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
um the you know the fact that we now are
 
01:20:29.450 --> 01:20:29.460 align:start position:0%
I think five percent of the world's
 
01:20:31.310 --> 01:20:31.320 align:start position:0%
population 25 percent of the world's
 
01:20:33.410 --> 01:20:33.420 align:start position:0%
incarcerated population in part because
 
01:20:35.090 --> 01:20:35.100 align:start position:0%
of mandatory minimums and three strikes
 
01:20:35.100 --> 01:20:35.990 align:start position:0%
of mandatory minimums and three strikes
laws

01:20:35.990 --> 01:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
laws
 
01:20:37.550 --> 01:20:37.560 align:start position:0%
um and that we're seeing States across
 
01:20:39.350 --> 01:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
the country including deep red states in
 
01:20:41.030 --> 01:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
the South move away from that because
 
01:20:43.370 --> 01:20:43.380 align:start position:0%
they've seen that they have net harms on
 
01:20:45.290 --> 01:20:45.300 align:start position:0%
the community and if there were actually
 
01:20:47.270 --> 01:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
concerned about having safer communities
 
01:20:49.370 --> 01:20:49.380 align:start position:0%
I'm ensuring that you know the vast
 
01:20:50.750 --> 01:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
majority of people are going to be
 
01:20:52.370 --> 01:20:52.380 align:start position:0%
released that we're ensuring that when
 
01:20:54.050 --> 01:20:54.060 align:start position:0%
people are released um you know we've
 
01:20:55.729 --> 01:20:55.739 align:start position:0%
had proper Rehabilitation and we have
 
01:20:57.649 --> 01:20:57.659 align:start position:0%
proper services in place
 
01:20:58.970 --> 01:20:58.980 align:start position:0%
um that there's been a move away from
 
01:21:01.850 --> 01:21:01.860 align:start position:0%
that but in this pre uh pre-trial phase
 
01:21:04.370 --> 01:21:04.380 align:start position:0%
that that we're concerned with here
 
01:21:06.110 --> 01:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
um it's even it's even more concerning
 
01:21:08.149 --> 01:21:08.159 align:start position:0%
because these people are not convicted
 
01:21:10.370 --> 01:21:10.380 align:start position:0%
of anything they're alleged to have done
 
01:21:12.229 --> 01:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
certain things there's research that we
 
01:21:13.790 --> 01:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
have from New Hampshire that shows that
 
01:21:15.410 --> 01:21:15.420 align:start position:0%
more than one in three people will have
 
01:21:16.850 --> 01:21:16.860 align:start position:0%
those charges later dismissed and
 
01:21:19.310 --> 01:21:19.320 align:start position:0%
they'll Prost and so we're concerned
 
01:21:20.630 --> 01:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
with kind of anything that takes away
 
01:21:22.430 --> 01:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
that judicial discretion for the court
 
01:21:25.070 --> 01:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
to look at all the facts to look at the
 
01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
person as an individual and say I think
 
01:21:29.149 --> 01:21:29.159 align:start position:0%
this person is a danger or a Flight Risk
 
01:21:30.890 --> 01:21:30.900 align:start position:0%
and detain them which they have multiple
 
01:21:32.930 --> 01:21:32.940 align:start position:0%
ways of doing right now under the law or
 
01:21:34.729 --> 01:21:34.739 align:start position:0%
to say I do not think this person is a
 
01:21:36.229 --> 01:21:36.239 align:start position:0%
danger or a Flight Risk and therefore
 
01:21:38.149 --> 01:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
give them release and as has been
 
01:21:39.950 --> 01:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
pointed out there are multiple ways in
 
01:21:41.689 --> 01:21:41.699 align:start position:0%
the current bail law where people can be
 
01:21:43.370 --> 01:21:43.380 align:start position:0%
detained if they break their release
 
01:21:45.470 --> 01:21:45.480 align:start position:0%
orders if a prosecutor disagrees with
 
01:21:46.729 --> 01:21:46.739 align:start position:0%
the chart with a release decision
 
01:21:49.490 --> 01:21:49.500 align:start position:0%
there's Myriad ways that they can be
 
01:21:50.990 --> 01:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
um health
 
01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:54.290 align:start position:0%
um health
thanks

01:21:54.290 --> 01:21:54.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:59.510 --> 01:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:02.209 --> 01:22:02.219 align:start position:0%
um what is your son's name uh Felix I
 
01:22:04.310 --> 01:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
have a follow-up though
 
01:22:06.590 --> 01:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
um Hi Felix
 
01:22:09.590 --> 01:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
um as far as the use that this sort of
 
01:22:12.470 --> 01:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
re-implements the three strikes law I I
 
01:22:13.970 --> 01:22:13.980 align:start position:0%
think I understand that that's some
 
01:22:16.850 --> 01:22:16.860 align:start position:0%
Clinton administration concept do you
 
01:22:18.530 --> 01:22:18.540 align:start position:0%
know if there's any
 
01:22:21.050 --> 01:22:21.060 align:start position:0%
Research into the concept of having
 
01:22:23.149 --> 01:22:23.159 align:start position:0%
three strikes you're out outside of like
 
01:22:26.090 --> 01:22:26.100 align:start position:0%
how it affects baseball
 
01:22:28.070 --> 01:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
um I can definitely send you all lots of
 
01:22:29.570 --> 01:22:29.580 align:start position:0%
information on that
 
01:22:31.370 --> 01:22:31.380 align:start position:0%
um actually a lot of the origins of the
 
01:22:33.290 --> 01:22:33.300 align:start position:0%
three strikes laws unfortunately came
 
01:22:35.030 --> 01:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
from the privatization of our prisons
 
01:22:38.030 --> 01:22:38.040 align:start position:0%
and so uh the private prison providers
 
01:22:41.810 --> 01:22:41.820 align:start position:0%
CCA Geo others at the time were actually
 
01:22:43.790 --> 01:22:43.800 align:start position:0%
pushing these model three strikes laws
 
01:22:46.010 --> 01:22:46.020 align:start position:0%
across the country because it was good
 
01:22:48.050 --> 01:22:48.060 align:start position:0%
for business it was a way for them to
 
01:22:49.189 --> 01:22:49.199 align:start position:0%
ensure that they had more people in
 
01:22:51.970 --> 01:22:51.980 align:start position:0%
their beds they actually in their um
 
01:22:54.290 --> 01:22:54.300 align:start position:0%
their financial disclosures that they're
 
01:22:56.870 --> 01:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
required to disclose way back would
 
01:22:58.490 --> 01:22:58.500 align:start position:0%
actually talk about you know their
 
01:23:00.410 --> 01:23:00.420 align:start position:0%
concerns with efforts to move away from
 
01:23:01.550 --> 01:23:01.560 align:start position:0%
this and how it was going to impact
 
01:23:04.189 --> 01:23:04.199 align:start position:0%
their bottom line and so fortunately New
 
01:23:05.810 --> 01:23:05.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have not gone down that
 
01:23:08.810 --> 01:23:08.820 align:start position:0%
route of private facilities but that one
 
01:23:10.790 --> 01:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
of the major you know origin and kind of
 
01:23:12.590 --> 01:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
the major pushes across the country of
 
01:23:14.990 --> 01:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
these laws not in a pre-trial but in the
 
01:23:16.970 --> 01:23:16.980 align:start position:0%
incred in the in the sentencing phase
 
01:23:22.790 --> 01:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:26.570 --> 01:23:26.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:28.850 --> 01:23:28.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:23:28.860 --> 01:23:30.130 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

01:23:30.130 --> 01:23:30.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:34.189 --> 01:23:34.199 align:start position:0%
this bill and where where it says that
 
01:23:36.830 --> 01:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
um while on bail I'm just curious about
 
01:23:39.709 --> 01:23:39.719 align:start position:0%
personal recognizance in bail are would
 
01:23:41.630 --> 01:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
they be considered the same in this bill
 
01:23:43.149 --> 01:23:43.159 align:start position:0%
or would somebody on personal
 
01:23:45.649 --> 01:23:45.659 align:start position:0%
recognizance get an extra strike or how
 
01:23:48.470 --> 01:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
how do you think that might work
 
01:23:50.270 --> 01:23:50.280 align:start position:0%
I I don't think that there would be a
 
01:23:51.830 --> 01:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
distinction there I think our concern
 
01:23:53.810 --> 01:23:53.820 align:start position:0%
here though is this this is taking out
 
01:23:56.149 --> 01:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
PR bail as an option so that you're
 
01:23:57.890 --> 01:23:57.900 align:start position:0%
going to striking out that section so
 
01:23:59.930 --> 01:23:59.940 align:start position:0%
that people without wealth are now going
 
01:24:01.310 --> 01:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
to be detained because they're going to
 
01:24:02.689 --> 01:24:02.699 align:start position:0%
have cash bail that they can't afford
 
01:24:04.850 --> 01:24:04.860 align:start position:0%
and so the people with wealth will just
 
01:24:07.370 --> 01:24:07.380 align:start position:0%
pay the fee and or pay the bill and and
 
01:24:11.090 --> 01:24:11.100 align:start position:0%
get released thank you
 
01:24:12.890 --> 01:24:12.900 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
01:24:15.590 --> 01:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:36.110 --> 01:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:37.970 --> 01:24:37.980 align:start position:0%
morning Mr chair and members of the
 
01:24:39.890 --> 01:24:39.900 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for having me today
 
01:24:41.870 --> 01:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
my name is John burfonski I'm currently
 
01:24:43.729 --> 01:24:43.739 align:start position:0%
the chief of police in Bedford New
 
01:24:46.669 --> 01:24:46.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where I've been chief for
 
01:24:49.490 --> 01:24:49.500 align:start position:0%
um more than 11 years I have 45 years in
 
01:24:51.590 --> 01:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
law enforcement experience and currently
 
01:24:53.030 --> 01:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
the president of New Hampshire Chiefs of
 
01:24:54.470 --> 01:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
Police Association ladies and gentlemen
 
01:24:55.850 --> 01:24:55.860 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
01:24:57.669 --> 01:24:57.679 align:start position:0%
if the current bail system was working
 
01:25:00.709 --> 01:25:00.719 align:start position:0%
appropriately and properly I wouldn't be
 
01:25:03.590 --> 01:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
here today Senator Abbas would not be
 
01:25:06.290 --> 01:25:06.300 align:start position:0%
sponsoring this bill today if the
 
01:25:09.229 --> 01:25:09.239 align:start position:0%
implementation of the bail system here
 
01:25:11.630 --> 01:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
in the granite state was working to
 
01:25:13.430 --> 01:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
protect victims
 
01:25:16.189 --> 01:25:16.199 align:start position:0%
that word victim I don't think has been
 
01:25:20.510 --> 01:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:22.669 --> 01:25:22.679 align:start position:0%
why aren't we talking about victims here
 
01:25:24.890 --> 01:25:24.900 align:start position:0%
the victims of crime
 
01:25:27.470 --> 01:25:27.480 align:start position:0%
the people that whether they're low
 
01:25:29.810 --> 01:25:29.820 align:start position:0%
level or not if your loved one happens
 
01:25:32.510 --> 01:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
to be a victim of crime it's not a low
 
01:25:34.130 --> 01:25:34.140 align:start position:0%
level offense
 
01:25:35.689 --> 01:25:35.699 align:start position:0%
they're a victim
 
01:25:35.699 --> 01:25:36.830 align:start position:0%
they're a victim
right

01:25:36.830 --> 01:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:25:39.290 --> 01:25:39.300 align:start position:0%
in the 45 years and my police experience
 
01:25:42.110 --> 01:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
I can tell you without
 
01:25:45.890 --> 01:25:45.900 align:start position:0%
any equivocation that the majority of
 
01:25:49.669 --> 01:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
crime is committed at all levels by a
 
01:25:51.350 --> 01:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
small disproportionate number of
 
01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:52.550 align:start position:0%
small disproportionate number of
offenders

01:25:52.550 --> 01:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
offenders
 
01:25:54.649 --> 01:25:54.659 align:start position:0%
that's been the Axiom in the Criminal
 
01:25:56.629 --> 01:25:56.639 align:start position:0%
Justice System since I was an
 
01:25:59.090 --> 01:25:59.100 align:start position:0%
undergraduate in criminology and
 
01:26:02.810 --> 01:26:02.820 align:start position:0%
penology in 1973 50 years ago taught by
 
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
the commissioner Corrections for the
 
01:26:06.490 --> 01:26:06.500 align:start position:0%
state of Connecticut
 
01:26:09.050 --> 01:26:09.060 align:start position:0%
disproportionate number of crime is com
 
01:26:11.570 --> 01:26:11.580 align:start position:0%
the majority of crime is committed by a
 
01:26:13.970 --> 01:26:13.980 align:start position:0%
disproportionate number of offenders
 
01:26:17.030 --> 01:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
prolific offenders are responsible for
 
01:26:19.189 --> 01:26:19.199 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of crime everywhere
 
01:26:21.830 --> 01:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
here in this state as well as across the
 
01:26:24.410 --> 01:26:24.420 align:start position:0%
country included in my written testimony
 
01:26:26.629 --> 01:26:26.639 align:start position:0%
there is a recent study that was
 
01:26:29.090 --> 01:26:29.100 align:start position:0%
completed in Seattle
 
01:26:31.430 --> 01:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
where they implemented a system over a
 
01:26:32.590 --> 01:26:32.600 align:start position:0%
year ago
 
01:26:37.189 --> 01:26:37.199 align:start position:0%
to focus on prolific repeat offenders
 
01:26:39.950 --> 01:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
and lo and behold what they found was
 
01:26:42.649 --> 01:26:42.659 align:start position:0%
that by doing so they reduced crime
 
01:26:45.110 --> 01:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
overall in the city of Seattle
 
01:26:46.970 --> 01:26:46.980 align:start position:0%
another study which is not included but
 
01:26:48.770 --> 01:26:48.780 align:start position:0%
I can get it to you if you want it from
 
01:26:52.669 --> 01:26:52.679 align:start position:0%
California shows precisely the impact of
 
01:26:55.129 --> 01:26:55.139 align:start position:0%
focusing on repeat offenders that are
 
01:26:56.689 --> 01:26:56.699 align:start position:0%
continually releasing the system over
 
01:26:59.990 --> 01:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
and over again who have reoffended
 
01:27:02.450 --> 01:27:02.460 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of talk about the
 
01:27:04.850 --> 01:27:04.860 align:start position:0%
percentages of crime and the percentages
 
01:27:07.010 --> 01:27:07.020 align:start position:0%
and numbers of arrests
 
01:27:09.770 --> 01:27:09.780 align:start position:0%
Bedford New Hampshire does approximately
 
01:27:12.110 --> 01:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
700 arrests a year talking with my
 
01:27:13.610 --> 01:27:13.620 align:start position:0%
colleague Chief Oldenburg who's in the
 
01:27:16.669 --> 01:27:16.679 align:start position:0%
room between Bedford and Manchester we
 
01:27:18.830 --> 01:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
arrest somewhere around the vicinity of
 
01:27:20.750 --> 01:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
5 000 people a year
 
01:27:23.709 --> 01:27:23.719 align:start position:0%
for Bedford alone I've been a chief
 
01:27:26.030 --> 01:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
during the time there's probably been on
 
01:27:28.669 --> 01:27:28.679 align:start position:0%
over 70 000 arrests and I look at each
 
01:27:30.229 --> 01:27:30.239 align:start position:0%
and every one and I have done so for the
 
01:27:32.330 --> 01:27:32.340 align:start position:0%
past 11 years and I can tell you
 
01:27:35.030 --> 01:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
that when we talk about the catch and
 
01:27:36.709 --> 01:27:36.719 align:start position:0%
release system that's precisely what it
 
01:27:36.719 --> 01:27:37.550 align:start position:0%
release system that's precisely what it
is

01:27:37.550 --> 01:27:37.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:27:40.669 --> 01:27:40.679 align:start position:0%
it's become such a mockery that in the
 
01:27:42.530 --> 01:27:42.540 align:start position:0%
criminal justice system the equivalent
 
01:27:44.330 --> 01:27:44.340 align:start position:0%
of a tank of gas or two bags of heroin
 
01:27:45.830 --> 01:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
get you out of jail
 
01:27:47.209 --> 01:27:47.219 align:start position:0%
and that's what happens each and every
 
01:27:49.250 --> 01:27:49.260 align:start position:0%
day across the state to the point where
 
01:27:50.990 --> 01:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
Manchester cops and Bedford cops
 
01:27:53.090 --> 01:27:53.100 align:start position:0%
Troopers and sheriffs know the names of
 
01:27:54.050 --> 01:27:54.060 align:start position:0%
these people
 
01:27:56.090 --> 01:27:56.100 align:start position:0%
they know where they live they know how
 
01:27:57.410 --> 01:27:57.420 align:start position:0%
many times that they've been arrested
 
01:27:58.430 --> 01:27:58.440 align:start position:0%
and they can tell you their criminal
 
01:28:00.169 --> 01:28:00.179 align:start position:0%
history like it's on the back of their
 
01:28:02.870 --> 01:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
hand why because they run across them so
 
01:28:05.209 --> 01:28:05.219 align:start position:0%
many times this is a bill that focuses
 
01:28:07.550 --> 01:28:07.560 align:start position:0%
on prolific repeat offenders
 
01:28:10.370 --> 01:28:10.380 align:start position:0%
right you can draw the line at two you
 
01:28:11.750 --> 01:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
can draw the line at three you can draw
 
01:28:14.629 --> 01:28:14.639 align:start position:0%
a line at four but the line hasn't been
 
01:28:16.430 --> 01:28:16.440 align:start position:0%
drawn at all because we're talking about
 
01:28:18.410 --> 01:28:18.420 align:start position:0%
people that are in and out of jail 12 13
 
01:28:20.689 --> 01:28:20.699 align:start position:0%
14 15 times I know one case in Bedford
 
01:28:23.689 --> 01:28:23.699 align:start position:0%
at least 17 times where this person's
 
01:28:25.250 --> 01:28:25.260 align:start position:0%
been arrested and released
 
01:28:28.129 --> 01:28:28.139 align:start position:0%
uh reoffending each time under bail
 
01:28:28.139 --> 01:28:29.689 align:start position:0%
uh reoffending each time under bail
conditions

01:28:29.689 --> 01:28:29.699 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
01:28:33.530 --> 01:28:33.540 align:start position:0%
it's past time that we take some action
 
01:28:36.530 --> 01:28:36.540 align:start position:0%
and to think about the victims of crime
 
01:28:38.689 --> 01:28:38.699 align:start position:0%
the victims of crime victims of crime
 
01:28:40.490 --> 01:28:40.500 align:start position:0%
can we think about the victims of crime
 
01:28:40.500 --> 01:28:42.169 align:start position:0%
can we think about the victims of crime
once

01:28:42.169 --> 01:28:42.179 align:start position:0%
once
 
01:28:45.290 --> 01:28:45.300 align:start position:0%
when we talk about these types of bills
 
01:28:46.669 --> 01:28:46.679 align:start position:0%
there's people out there that are
 
01:28:48.110 --> 01:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
suffering each and every day at the
 
01:28:50.450 --> 01:28:50.460 align:start position:0%
hands of these people
 
01:28:52.370 --> 01:28:52.380 align:start position:0%
I'm not talking about the retailers and
 
01:28:54.770 --> 01:28:54.780 align:start position:0%
the shoplifting crime that's perpetrated
 
01:28:56.990 --> 01:28:57.000 align:start position:0%
in lows or Target whatever we're talking
 
01:28:58.729 --> 01:28:58.739 align:start position:0%
about the trades person
 
01:29:01.310 --> 01:29:01.320 align:start position:0%
that loses their life's ability to work
 
01:29:03.770 --> 01:29:03.780 align:start position:0%
when their truck is stolen
 
01:29:05.689 --> 01:29:05.699 align:start position:0%
or their tools are stolen
 
01:29:07.310 --> 01:29:07.320 align:start position:0%
or that some person is working three
 
01:29:09.649 --> 01:29:09.659 align:start position:0%
jobs to try to make ends meet to put
 
01:29:11.209 --> 01:29:11.219 align:start position:0%
food on the table and the catalytic
 
01:29:12.890 --> 01:29:12.900 align:start position:0%
converter is cut off their car and it's
 
01:29:14.270 --> 01:29:14.280 align:start position:0%
a two thousand dollar job that they
 
01:29:16.669 --> 01:29:16.679 align:start position:0%
can't pay for
 
01:29:18.950 --> 01:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
that's what we're talking about here
 
01:29:21.169 --> 01:29:21.179 align:start position:0%
it's high time past time that we think
 
01:29:23.149 --> 01:29:23.159 align:start position:0%
about the victims of crime thank you Mr
 
01:29:23.159 --> 01:29:25.850 align:start position:0%
about the victims of crime thank you Mr
chair

01:29:25.850 --> 01:29:25.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:27.770 --> 01:29:27.780 align:start position:0%
representative Noel
 
01:29:29.330 --> 01:29:29.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:29:31.070 --> 01:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:29:33.290 --> 01:29:33.300 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate that a lot you know
 
01:29:35.030 --> 01:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
reminding us to think about the victims
 
01:29:37.729 --> 01:29:37.739 align:start position:0%
of the crime Mike my question I guess is
 
01:29:39.649 --> 01:29:39.659 align:start position:0%
you know the way that it sounds there's
 
01:29:42.590 --> 01:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
already the discretion to be able to
 
01:29:44.450 --> 01:29:44.460 align:start position:0%
detain people if if that's seen as
 
01:29:46.430 --> 01:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
necessary so if there's something but
 
01:29:48.290 --> 01:29:48.300 align:start position:0%
that would be at the discretion of the
 
01:29:50.330 --> 01:29:50.340 align:start position:0%
judge and so my question is
 
01:29:53.450 --> 01:29:53.460 align:start position:0%
are is what you're saying that that the
 
01:29:56.330 --> 01:29:56.340 align:start position:0%
judge is not considering the victims
 
01:29:58.070 --> 01:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
the judge isn't considering the victims
 
01:29:59.930 --> 01:29:59.940 align:start position:0%
the system isn't considering the victims
 
01:30:03.050 --> 01:30:03.060 align:start position:0%
because there is no consequence right uh
 
01:30:05.570 --> 01:30:05.580 align:start position:0%
yes that's precisely the fact I look at
 
01:30:07.669 --> 01:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
every single Minimus that comes from the
 
01:30:09.229 --> 01:30:09.239 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County Attorney's Office to
 
01:30:10.850 --> 01:30:10.860 align:start position:0%
the man to the Bedford Police Department
 
01:30:13.129 --> 01:30:13.139 align:start position:0%
every single day right and the vast
 
01:30:15.470 --> 01:30:15.480 align:start position:0%
majority of those people are are people
 
01:30:17.930 --> 01:30:17.940 align:start position:0%
that have been arrested and reoffended
 
01:30:20.570 --> 01:30:20.580 align:start position:0%
in what world doesn't make any sense to
 
01:30:22.250 --> 01:30:22.260 align:start position:0%
arrest someone for failure to appear and
 
01:30:24.290 --> 01:30:24.300 align:start position:0%
then let them out again
 
01:30:27.709 --> 01:30:27.719 align:start position:0%
on our war and to reoffend
 
01:30:30.050 --> 01:30:30.060 align:start position:0%
it's an accident it's true that the
 
01:30:32.930 --> 01:30:32.940 align:start position:0%
majority of offenders right commit a
 
01:30:34.970 --> 01:30:34.980 align:start position:0%
disproportionate amount of crime and
 
01:30:36.649 --> 01:30:36.659 align:start position:0%
that's been true for many many decades
 
01:30:38.750 --> 01:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
we need to focus on the people that
 
01:30:40.490 --> 01:30:40.500 align:start position:0%
continue to reoffend if we can do that
 
01:30:42.649 --> 01:30:42.659 align:start position:0%
you will have less costs in the criminal
 
01:30:44.629 --> 01:30:44.639 align:start position:0%
justice system you will have less
 
01:30:47.209 --> 01:30:47.219 align:start position:0%
resource costs on the courts you will
 
01:30:50.390 --> 01:30:50.400 align:start position:0%
have less costs for the police
 
01:30:52.610 --> 01:30:52.620 align:start position:0%
departments and the prosecutors and the
 
01:30:54.590 --> 01:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
public defenders because these cases
 
01:30:56.030 --> 01:30:56.040 align:start position:0%
weren't happening and trust me when I
 
01:30:58.610 --> 01:30:58.620 align:start position:0%
tell you offenders if this law goes into
 
01:31:00.830 --> 01:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
effect and offenders know that they hit
 
01:31:03.169 --> 01:31:03.179 align:start position:0%
the third strike law right or the third
 
01:31:04.790 --> 01:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
strike and they're going to go to Valley
 
01:31:06.050 --> 01:31:06.060 align:start position:0%
Street jail
 
01:31:07.610 --> 01:31:07.620 align:start position:0%
they're going to be thinking twice about
 
01:31:11.330 --> 01:31:11.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:15.110 --> 01:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:15.120 --> 01:31:17.149 align:start position:0%
 
scitec

01:31:17.149 --> 01:31:17.159 align:start position:0%
scitec
 
01:31:20.090 --> 01:31:20.100 align:start position:0%
Chief Uh something's getting blurred
 
01:31:20.100 --> 01:31:21.229 align:start position:0%
Chief Uh something's getting blurred
here

01:31:21.229 --> 01:31:21.239 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:31:24.229 --> 01:31:24.239 align:start position:0%
we're talking about pre-trial the
 
01:31:28.010 --> 01:31:28.020 align:start position:0%
instances I see of long rap sheets are
 
01:31:30.350 --> 01:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
people who have committed a new crime
 
01:31:33.110 --> 01:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
after their previous has crime has been
 
01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:34.669 align:start position:0%
after their previous has crime has been
adjudicated

01:31:34.669 --> 01:31:34.679 align:start position:0%
adjudicated
 
01:31:37.629 --> 01:31:37.639 align:start position:0%
are you confusing conflating two
 
01:31:41.330 --> 01:31:41.340 align:start position:0%
situations one of pre-trial and one of a
 
01:31:45.050 --> 01:31:45.060 align:start position:0%
new offense after adjudication and I I
 
01:31:48.290 --> 01:31:48.300 align:start position:0%
this is it sounds slippery to me
 
01:31:50.330 --> 01:31:50.340 align:start position:0%
well let me put some sand on the
 
01:31:52.850 --> 01:31:52.860 align:start position:0%
slippery slope there is no conflating of
 
01:31:54.770 --> 01:31:54.780 align:start position:0%
the two issues well I'm talking about
 
01:31:56.450 --> 01:31:56.460 align:start position:0%
people that we know that have been
 
01:31:58.370 --> 01:31:58.380 align:start position:0%
released on bail conditions failure to
 
01:32:00.410 --> 01:32:00.420 align:start position:0%
appear and other crimes that are
 
01:32:02.689 --> 01:32:02.699 align:start position:0%
continually out reoffend out reoffend
 
01:32:03.950 --> 01:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
and none of those cases have been
 
01:32:05.810 --> 01:32:05.820 align:start position:0%
adjudicated takes a year year and a half
 
01:32:07.910 --> 01:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
two years for some of these cases to go
 
01:32:09.350 --> 01:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
through and some of the other testimony
 
01:32:12.590 --> 01:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
when we talk about non-profit no process
 
01:32:14.930 --> 01:32:14.940 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of those no processes
 
01:32:16.970 --> 01:32:16.980 align:start position:0%
that I get in Bedford are part of what
 
01:32:19.570 --> 01:32:19.580 align:start position:0%
we call the global plea a certain crime
 
01:32:22.189 --> 01:32:22.199 align:start position:0%
that was indicted for example or a
 
01:32:25.669 --> 01:32:25.679 align:start position:0%
complaint is null Prost in favor of a
 
01:32:29.149 --> 01:32:29.159 align:start position:0%
plea to combine charges sometimes
 
01:32:32.030 --> 01:32:32.040 align:start position:0%
between two towns or two cities so
 
01:32:33.410 --> 01:32:33.420 align:start position:0%
oftentimes the people that we arrest
 
01:32:35.330 --> 01:32:35.340 align:start position:0%
happen to be the same people that are
 
01:32:37.010 --> 01:32:37.020 align:start position:0%
arrested in Manchester and then there's
 
01:32:39.830 --> 01:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
a global plea in Superior Court where
 
01:32:41.689 --> 01:32:41.699 align:start position:0%
the Bedford charges non-profits in favor
 
01:32:43.729 --> 01:32:43.739 align:start position:0%
of the other charges in Manchester
 
01:32:45.770 --> 01:32:45.780 align:start position:0%
so be careful when you look at numbers
 
01:32:49.310 --> 01:32:49.320 align:start position:0%
because numbers can be deceiving
 
01:32:51.530 --> 01:32:51.540 align:start position:0%
if isn't it true that even within one
 
01:32:51.540 --> 01:32:52.810 align:start position:0%
if isn't it true that even within one
town

01:32:52.810 --> 01:32:52.820 align:start position:0%
town
 
01:32:55.189 --> 01:32:55.199 align:start position:0%
several charges can be null crossed in
 
01:32:56.870 --> 01:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
favor of one particular charge that is
 
01:32:58.070 --> 01:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
pled to
 
01:33:02.810 --> 01:33:02.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:06.649 --> 01:33:06.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:09.169 --> 01:33:09.179 align:start position:0%
I understand your concerns about
 
01:33:09.179 --> 01:33:10.189 align:start position:0%
I understand your concerns about
um

01:33:10.189 --> 01:33:10.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:12.850 --> 01:33:12.860 align:start position:0%
people who are being victimized
 
01:33:16.430 --> 01:33:16.440 align:start position:0%
is it not the case that many if not most
 
01:33:18.830 --> 01:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
of our drug laws in New Hampshire are
 
01:33:20.750 --> 01:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors which would be included
 
01:33:23.330 --> 01:33:23.340 align:start position:0%
under this legislation and wouldn't we
 
01:33:24.890 --> 01:33:24.900 align:start position:0%
be capturing people
 
01:33:27.709 --> 01:33:27.719 align:start position:0%
with this bill who need drug treatment
 
01:33:30.709 --> 01:33:30.719 align:start position:0%
and maybe aren't being arrested for
 
01:33:32.629 --> 01:33:32.639 align:start position:0%
victimizing anyone
 
01:33:37.430 --> 01:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:39.290 --> 01:33:39.300 align:start position:0%
was the baby that just died in
 
01:33:41.930 --> 01:33:41.940 align:start position:0%
Manchester a victimless crime that was a
 
01:33:43.310 --> 01:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
drug crime
 
01:33:45.649 --> 01:33:45.659 align:start position:0%
that's not a victimless crime
 
01:33:47.930 --> 01:33:47.940 align:start position:0%
um so let me ask you let me ask you uh
 
01:33:50.750 --> 01:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
answer your question
 
01:33:53.270 --> 01:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
we would love in law enforcement to have
 
01:33:56.390 --> 01:33:56.400 align:start position:0%
services in every single jail in every
 
01:33:57.890 --> 01:33:57.900 align:start position:0%
single county in the state of New
 
01:33:57.900 --> 01:33:58.790 align:start position:0%
single county in the state of New
Hampshire

01:33:58.790 --> 01:33:58.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:34:00.530 --> 01:34:00.540 align:start position:0%
where people that are arrested for
 
01:34:03.050 --> 01:34:03.060 align:start position:0%
property crime who have an underlying
 
01:34:05.030 --> 01:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder could get
 
01:34:07.189 --> 01:34:07.199 align:start position:0%
treatment the study that you're seeing
 
01:34:09.169 --> 01:34:09.179 align:start position:0%
in Seattle shows that for the vast
 
01:34:10.790 --> 01:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
majority of people that are released
 
01:34:12.770 --> 01:34:12.780 align:start position:0%
they don't seek treatment
 
01:34:14.810 --> 01:34:14.820 align:start position:0%
that's a fact the vast majority of
 
01:34:16.550 --> 01:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
people that are released don't seek
 
01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:17.689 align:start position:0%
people that are released don't seek
treatment

01:34:17.689 --> 01:34:17.699 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
01:34:19.550 --> 01:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
but if they're arrested and if they have
 
01:34:22.129 --> 01:34:22.139 align:start position:0%
an underlying substance use disorder
 
01:34:24.590 --> 01:34:24.600 align:start position:0%
and if we had effective programs and
 
01:34:26.689 --> 01:34:26.699 align:start position:0%
there are effective programs that are
 
01:34:27.649 --> 01:34:27.659 align:start position:0%
out there
 
01:34:30.770 --> 01:34:30.780 align:start position:0%
that cut recidivism significantly the
 
01:34:33.229 --> 01:34:33.239 align:start position:0%
main State Prison Maine just introduced
 
01:34:35.390 --> 01:34:35.400 align:start position:0%
a medically assisted treatment program
 
01:34:37.790 --> 01:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
in Maine in a prison system a couple of
 
01:34:40.129 --> 01:34:40.139 align:start position:0%
years ago that has shown pretty good
 
01:34:42.290 --> 01:34:42.300 align:start position:0%
results if we had that in our County
 
01:34:45.950 --> 01:34:45.960 align:start position:0%
jails right we would have
 
01:34:47.930 --> 01:34:47.940 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to address this
 
01:34:49.790 --> 01:34:49.800 align:start position:0%
particular problem whereas when people
 
01:34:52.250 --> 01:34:52.260 align:start position:0%
are released
 
01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
they go back to reoffending and they
 
01:34:59.570 --> 01:34:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:01.850 --> 01:35:01.860 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry if I put you on the defensive
 
01:35:03.950 --> 01:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
how my question was worded I think what
 
01:35:06.350 --> 01:35:06.360 align:start position:0%
I was trying to get at was would you
 
01:35:09.470 --> 01:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
object to changing this the wording to
 
01:35:11.169 --> 01:35:11.179 align:start position:0%
be more specific about
 
01:35:14.990 --> 01:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
the types of offenses that would apply
 
01:35:18.229 --> 01:35:18.239 align:start position:0%
so that we're not capturing people who
 
01:35:19.490 --> 01:35:19.500 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:35:21.169 --> 01:35:21.179 align:start position:0%
at a disadvantage if they're
 
01:35:24.229 --> 01:35:24.239 align:start position:0%
incarcerated seeing as it sounds like at
 
01:35:25.669 --> 01:35:25.679 align:start position:0%
least in Hillsborough County it'd be
 
01:35:27.169 --> 01:35:27.179 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily difficult to access
 
01:35:30.169 --> 01:35:30.179 align:start position:0%
treatment while incarcerated there so my
 
01:35:32.090 --> 01:35:32.100 align:start position:0%
question is would you object to making
 
01:35:34.729 --> 01:35:34.739 align:start position:0%
changes to specify
 
01:35:38.030 --> 01:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
um criminal offenses that actually
 
01:35:40.610 --> 01:35:40.620 align:start position:0%
involve victimizing others
 
01:35:42.350 --> 01:35:42.360 align:start position:0%
yes I would because those are the people
 
01:35:44.390 --> 01:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
that are sticking out on the convenience
 
01:35:46.310 --> 01:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
stores on Pine Street
 
01:35:50.149 --> 01:35:50.159 align:start position:0%
right those are victims uh and so we
 
01:35:51.950 --> 01:35:51.960 align:start position:0%
start drawing the line and the squiggly
 
01:35:54.169 --> 01:35:54.179 align:start position:0%
line and gerrymandering different crimes
 
01:35:56.990 --> 01:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
we're not getting the effect that's
 
01:35:59.390 --> 01:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
necessary there needs to be a strong
 
01:36:02.450 --> 01:36:02.460 align:start position:0%
message from you to the uh to these
 
01:36:04.970 --> 01:36:04.980 align:start position:0%
offenders and to a strong message to the
 
01:36:07.310 --> 01:36:07.320 align:start position:0%
victims of crime in your cons in your
 
01:36:11.510 --> 01:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
constituencies that this has to stop
 
01:36:13.490 --> 01:36:13.500 align:start position:0%
Chief the the crimes you talked about
 
01:36:15.649 --> 01:36:15.659 align:start position:0%
the property crimes
 
01:36:17.030 --> 01:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
um you know the stealing of the tools
 
01:36:18.950 --> 01:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
the catalytic converters is that not
 
01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
most of the time to support to pay for
 
01:36:23.689 --> 01:36:23.699 align:start position:0%
their drug addictions is that not the
 
01:36:25.850 --> 01:36:25.860 align:start position:0%
the origin of those crimes most of the
 
01:36:28.010 --> 01:36:28.020 align:start position:0%
time a lot of the level property crime
 
01:36:30.770 --> 01:36:30.780 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely Mr chair as a result of
 
01:36:33.050 --> 01:36:33.060 align:start position:0%
substance abuse disorder and the fact of
 
01:36:34.970 --> 01:36:34.980 align:start position:0%
the matter is is that when those people
 
01:36:37.790 --> 01:36:37.800 align:start position:0%
are released right without any effective
 
01:36:39.830 --> 01:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
treatment right despite the fact that
 
01:36:41.689 --> 01:36:41.699 align:start position:0%
there are bail conditions they continue
 
01:36:44.270 --> 01:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
to reoffend most of the time to support
 
01:36:47.090 --> 01:36:47.100 align:start position:0%
their substance use disorder right but
 
01:36:48.709 --> 01:36:48.719 align:start position:0%
where we have programs in place
 
01:36:51.530 --> 01:36:51.540 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County I believe has a fairly
 
01:36:51.540 --> 01:36:53.229 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County I believe has a fairly
um

01:36:53.229 --> 01:36:53.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:55.370 --> 01:36:55.380 align:start position:0%
well-run program that addresses
 
01:36:57.649 --> 01:36:57.659 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder in their jail and
 
01:36:58.790 --> 01:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
it's effective
 
01:37:00.649 --> 01:37:00.659 align:start position:0%
but if we release them we lose control
 
01:37:02.390 --> 01:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
over the ability to make sure that they
 
01:37:04.430 --> 01:37:04.440 align:start position:0%
get the treatment that they need to stop
 
01:37:07.610 --> 01:37:07.620 align:start position:0%
the behavior that society believes is
 
01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
not what they should be doing
 
01:37:11.810 --> 01:37:11.820 align:start position:0%
as a follow-up what is your experience
 
01:37:15.470 --> 01:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:17.330 --> 01:37:17.340 align:start position:0%
my experience is that it's not very
 
01:37:18.950 --> 01:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
effective and the reason why it's not
 
01:37:20.930 --> 01:37:20.940 align:start position:0%
very effective is because again there's
 
01:37:24.110 --> 01:37:24.120 align:start position:0%
no consequences right if there's no
 
01:37:27.169 --> 01:37:27.179 align:start position:0%
consequence to not adhering to the
 
01:37:30.649 --> 01:37:30.659 align:start position:0%
conditions by which the court sets then
 
01:37:33.050 --> 01:37:33.060 align:start position:0%
the individual continues on a path and a
 
01:37:33.060 --> 01:37:34.090 align:start position:0%
the individual continues on a path and a
trajectory

01:37:34.090 --> 01:37:34.100 align:start position:0%
trajectory
 
01:37:36.590 --> 01:37:36.600 align:start position:0%
that is consistent with what brought
 
01:37:39.350 --> 01:37:39.360 align:start position:0%
them there in the first place so I would
 
01:37:41.570 --> 01:37:41.580 align:start position:0%
say that while drug courts may be
 
01:37:43.550 --> 01:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
effective they need to be coupled with a
 
01:37:44.810 --> 01:37:44.820 align:start position:0%
more effective
 
01:37:48.410 --> 01:37:48.420 align:start position:0%
program of
 
01:37:51.530 --> 01:37:51.540 align:start position:0%
Services as well as a more effective
 
01:37:54.470 --> 01:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
program of treatment
 
01:37:57.169 --> 01:37:57.179 align:start position:0%
to the extent that if the individual
 
01:37:58.970 --> 01:37:58.980 align:start position:0%
who violates the terms and conditions
 
01:38:01.370 --> 01:38:01.380 align:start position:0%
set by the drug court judge
 
01:38:05.330 --> 01:38:05.340 align:start position:0%
then the next step has to be a confined
 
01:38:09.050 --> 01:38:09.060 align:start position:0%
treatment program in a facility that
 
01:38:10.610 --> 01:38:10.620 align:start position:0%
will cost money
 
01:38:12.830 --> 01:38:12.840 align:start position:0%
it will cost a lot of money
 
01:38:15.649 --> 01:38:15.659 align:start position:0%
but at the end of the day it's going to
 
01:38:16.970 --> 01:38:16.980 align:start position:0%
be less money
 
01:38:18.890 --> 01:38:18.900 align:start position:0%
than what's being suffered each and
 
01:38:20.870 --> 01:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
every day each and every year
 
01:38:23.090 --> 01:38:23.100 align:start position:0%
by the victims of crime in the granite
 
01:38:23.100 --> 01:38:23.750 align:start position:0%
by the victims of crime in the granite
state

01:38:23.750 --> 01:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:38:26.030 --> 01:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
they can't representative Newell
 
01:38:28.490 --> 01:38:28.500 align:start position:0%
did I just ask a really quick clarify
 
01:38:30.709 --> 01:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
clarification because you mentioned
 
01:38:33.890 --> 01:38:33.900 align:start position:0%
medically assisted treatment I was I was
 
01:38:35.689 --> 01:38:35.699 align:start position:0%
very involved in changing the rules
 
01:38:37.970 --> 01:38:37.980 align:start position:0%
around buprenorphines commonly known as
 
01:38:41.090 --> 01:38:41.100 align:start position:0%
Suboxone and so that it's easier to
 
01:38:43.070 --> 01:38:43.080 align:start position:0%
prescribe and access and things like
 
01:38:44.689 --> 01:38:44.699 align:start position:0%
that and we did hear when we were going
 
01:38:47.450 --> 01:38:47.460 align:start position:0%
through our orientation that from the
 
01:38:50.330 --> 01:38:50.340 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections that it that's
 
01:38:51.890 --> 01:38:51.900 align:start position:0%
a very helpful thing that's going to be
 
01:38:53.510 --> 01:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
implemented in the state prisons and I'm
 
01:38:55.669 --> 01:38:55.679 align:start position:0%
just on the state level and I'm just
 
01:38:57.770 --> 01:38:57.780 align:start position:0%
curious when you say that uh you know
 
01:38:58.850 --> 01:38:58.860 align:start position:0%
medically assisted treatment you're
 
01:39:00.709 --> 01:39:00.719 align:start position:0%
talking about in Maine are you saying
 
01:39:03.470 --> 01:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
that in on the county level uh there is
 
01:39:05.470 --> 01:39:05.480 align:start position:0%
not necessarily access to medically
 
01:39:07.189 --> 01:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
assisted treatments such as
 
01:39:10.370 --> 01:39:10.380 align:start position:0%
buprenorphine and things like that
 
01:39:12.770 --> 01:39:12.780 align:start position:0%
um anecdotally do I have proof in front
 
01:39:15.590 --> 01:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
of me no but my my senses is that there
 
01:39:17.990 --> 01:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
are insufficient effective programs
 
01:39:19.310 --> 01:39:19.320 align:start position:0%
whether they're medically assisted
 
01:39:21.709 --> 01:39:21.719 align:start position:0%
treatment programs or other programs for
 
01:39:23.570 --> 01:39:23.580 align:start position:0%
people in jail
 
01:39:25.729 --> 01:39:25.739 align:start position:0%
um that have an underlying substance use
 
01:39:31.910 --> 01:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:33.770 --> 01:39:33.780 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you

and I apologize to any members that I
 
01:39:38.689 --> 01:39:38.699 align:start position:0%
had for the questions but we do have to
 
01:39:40.250 --> 01:39:40.260 align:start position:0%
move this one along
 
01:39:42.169 --> 01:39:42.179 align:start position:0%
um the chair recognizes uh Professor
 
01:39:42.179 --> 01:39:53.930 align:start position:0%
um the chair recognizes uh Professor

good morning uh my name is uh Buzz sure

my opinions today are mine only they're
 
01:40:09.410 --> 01:40:09.420 align:start position:0%
not those of unh law UNH or the

01:40:14.330 --> 01:40:14.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:17.750 --> 01:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
let me address a few things that have
 
01:40:19.129 --> 01:40:19.139 align:start position:0%
already been said and then get to the
 
01:40:22.850 --> 01:40:22.860 align:start position:0%
point of my testimony one a bail is can
 
01:40:25.850 --> 01:40:25.860 align:start position:0%
be in three different forms it can be
 
01:40:28.790 --> 01:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
personal cognizance bail PR bail it can
 
01:40:30.950 --> 01:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
be cash bail where you need to put up an
 
01:40:33.290 --> 01:40:33.300 align:start position:0%
amount of cash or it could be corporate
 
01:40:34.910 --> 01:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
charity where you need to put up some
 
01:40:37.669 --> 01:40:37.679 align:start position:0%
sort of security and pay usually about
 
01:40:41.209 --> 01:40:41.219 align:start position:0%
10 percent of uh of what your bail is so
 
01:40:44.030 --> 01:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
those all count as bail be it bail or
 
01:40:46.970 --> 01:40:46.980 align:start position:0%
whether it's called bail or PR
 
01:40:46.980 --> 01:40:47.930 align:start position:0%
whether it's called bail or PR
um

01:40:47.930 --> 01:40:47.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:47.940 --> 01:40:49.910 align:start position:0%
um
uh

01:40:49.910 --> 01:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:40:51.890 --> 01:40:51.900 align:start position:0%
I've said this before and I'm going to
 
01:40:54.850 --> 01:40:54.860 align:start position:0%
continue to say it because uh it it it
 
01:40:56.810 --> 01:40:56.820 align:start position:0%
wrinkles me
 
01:40:58.970 --> 01:40:58.980 align:start position:0%
the term catch and release is a term
 
01:41:02.689 --> 01:41:02.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:05.450 --> 01:41:05.460 align:start position:0%
it does not refer to human beings and to
 
01:41:07.370 --> 01:41:07.380 align:start position:0%
talk about human beings in terms of
 
01:41:10.430 --> 01:41:10.440 align:start position:0%
catch and release is inappropriate and
 
01:41:10.440 --> 01:41:11.570 align:start position:0%
catch and release is inappropriate and
offensive

01:41:11.570 --> 01:41:11.580 align:start position:0%
offensive
 
01:41:14.570 --> 01:41:14.580 align:start position:0%
uh all the people who are involved in
 
01:41:16.490 --> 01:41:16.500 align:start position:0%
the Criminal Justice System including
 
01:41:18.410 --> 01:41:18.420 align:start position:0%
those who are charged with crimes are
 
01:41:19.970 --> 01:41:19.980 align:start position:0%
actually human beings
 
01:41:22.970 --> 01:41:22.980 align:start position:0%
and have complicated lives and so we
 
01:41:25.610 --> 01:41:25.620 align:start position:0%
need to respect all of them whether we
 
01:41:27.770 --> 01:41:27.780 align:start position:0%
like their conduct or not and whether we
 
01:41:30.590 --> 01:41:30.600 align:start position:0%
approve of their conduct or not so
 
01:41:33.229 --> 01:41:33.239 align:start position:0%
um I I will continue to make that point
 
01:41:38.330 --> 01:41:38.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:40.010 --> 01:41:40.020 align:start position:0%
the chief statement that there are no
 
01:41:43.070 --> 01:41:43.080 align:start position:0%
consequences for drug court and problems
 
01:41:46.970 --> 01:41:46.980 align:start position:0%
in drug court is just flat out wrong
 
01:41:50.390 --> 01:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
um I recommend that this committee talk
 
01:41:53.330 --> 01:41:53.340 align:start position:0%
to the judges the Superior Court judges
 
01:41:55.790 --> 01:41:55.800 align:start position:0%
who run drug courts and find out that
 
01:41:58.550 --> 01:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
there are consequences if you fail in
 
01:42:01.310 --> 01:42:01.320 align:start position:0%
drug court drug court does involve
 
01:42:03.890 --> 01:42:03.900 align:start position:0%
requirements of treatment of counseling
 
01:42:06.709 --> 01:42:06.719 align:start position:0%
that's the whole point of drug court to
 
01:42:09.410 --> 01:42:09.420 align:start position:0%
deal with situations in a way different
 
01:42:11.689 --> 01:42:11.699 align:start position:0%
than just sending people to the state
 
01:42:15.109 --> 01:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
prison and letting them further descend
 
01:42:19.490 --> 01:42:19.500 align:start position:0%
into uh repeat crimes uh in the criminal
 
01:42:21.290 --> 01:42:21.300 align:start position:0%
justice system that's the whole idea
 
01:42:24.470 --> 01:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
behind drug court and uh I would ask the
 
01:42:26.870 --> 01:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
chief if he doesn't understand that to
 
01:42:29.209 --> 01:42:29.219 align:start position:0%
talk to Chief Justice Neto of the
 
01:42:31.370 --> 01:42:31.380 align:start position:0%
Superior Court who has managed drug
 
01:42:34.250 --> 01:42:34.260 align:start position:0%
Courts for a number of years they are
 
01:42:36.169 --> 01:42:36.179 align:start position:0%
very effective
 
01:42:38.689 --> 01:42:38.699 align:start position:0%
if only we could have more resources to
 
01:42:45.770 --> 01:42:45.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:49.250 --> 01:42:49.260 align:start position:0%
finally on the issue of nullpross to
 
01:42:51.350 --> 01:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
address something the chair brought up
 
01:42:55.430 --> 01:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
of having several charges in one town uh
 
01:42:59.750 --> 01:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
and them getting no Pros for for uh in
 
01:43:01.810 --> 01:43:01.820 align:start position:0%
return for a plea on one of them
 
01:43:05.030 --> 01:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
the documents that we looked at from the
 
01:43:07.070 --> 01:43:07.080 align:start position:0%
court system they're called case summary
 
01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:08.290 align:start position:0%
court system they're called case summary
sheets

01:43:08.290 --> 01:43:08.300 align:start position:0%
sheets
 
01:43:12.590 --> 01:43:12.600 align:start position:0%
uh if an incident leads to a number of
 
01:43:15.410 --> 01:43:15.420 align:start position:0%
different charges they're all on one
 
01:43:18.830 --> 01:43:18.840 align:start position:0%
case summary sheet and so if there's a
 
01:43:21.109 --> 01:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
plea to one of those charges or to a
 
01:43:23.810 --> 01:43:23.820 align:start position:0%
lesser of those charges that would be
 
01:43:26.930 --> 01:43:26.940 align:start position:0%
reflected on the case summary sheet so I
 
01:43:29.270 --> 01:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
don't think it's the case that the huge
 
01:43:29.280 --> 01:43:30.290 align:start position:0%
don't think it's the case that the huge
majority

01:43:30.290 --> 01:43:30.300 align:start position:0%
majority
 
01:43:33.530 --> 01:43:33.540 align:start position:0%
or even a small majority of the null
 
01:43:36.470 --> 01:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
process that we saw in 36 percent of the
 
01:43:39.649 --> 01:43:39.659 align:start position:0%
504 cases we looked at are because of
 
01:43:41.990 --> 01:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
plea Bargains you know I've talked with
 
01:43:44.450 --> 01:43:44.460 align:start position:0%
the public defender program about that
 
01:43:46.189 --> 01:43:46.199 align:start position:0%
I've talked with a number of lawyers
 
01:43:49.930 --> 01:43:49.940 align:start position:0%
there's just a lot of overcharging
 
01:43:53.030 --> 01:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
and there's no way around that
 
01:43:55.510 --> 01:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
um part of the overcharging is because
 
01:43:59.209 --> 01:43:59.219 align:start position:0%
the system in New Hampshire is not well
 
01:44:01.250 --> 01:44:01.260 align:start position:0%
designed for a lot of consultation
 
01:44:03.410 --> 01:44:03.420 align:start position:0%
between prosecutors and police before
 
01:44:06.470 --> 01:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
the formal charging happens it's a more
 
01:44:08.390 --> 01:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
of a back-end system than a front-end
 
01:44:08.400 --> 01:44:09.250 align:start position:0%
of a back-end system than a front-end
system

01:44:09.250 --> 01:44:09.260 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:44:13.430 --> 01:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh and so I I think you end up with a
 
01:44:15.530 --> 01:44:15.540 align:start position:0%
good bit of overcharging
 
01:44:20.830 --> 01:44:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:23.330 --> 01:44:23.340 align:start position:0%
as this committee knows from my
 
01:44:25.970 --> 01:44:25.980 align:start position:0%
testimony other circumstances I care
 
01:44:29.149 --> 01:44:29.159 align:start position:0%
about actual data uh and I think this
 
01:44:31.370 --> 01:44:31.380 align:start position:0%
committee needs to make decisions based
 
01:44:34.850 --> 01:44:34.860 align:start position:0%
on real data not just anecdote I don't
 
01:44:36.890 --> 01:44:36.900 align:start position:0%
think it's it makes sense for this
 
01:44:40.189 --> 01:44:40.199 align:start position:0%
committee to decide what to do with this
 
01:44:43.550 --> 01:44:43.560 align:start position:0%
bill based on the five DWI example
 
01:44:47.169 --> 01:44:47.179 align:start position:0%
that's a rare occurrence
 
01:44:51.109 --> 01:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
the the there there's several issues in
 
01:44:55.129 --> 01:44:55.139 align:start position:0%
terms of a lack of data one there is
 
01:44:56.689 --> 01:44:56.699 align:start position:0%
really I think
 
01:45:00.470 --> 01:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
in reality in the bail system two two
 
01:45:03.709 --> 01:45:03.719 align:start position:0%
separate categories of people uh
 
01:45:08.870 --> 01:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
identified uh in the current system and
 
01:45:11.990 --> 01:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
the uh the the proposal by Senator Abbas
 
01:45:15.410 --> 01:45:15.420 align:start position:0%
one Those who commit felonies and are
 
01:45:19.310 --> 01:45:19.320 align:start position:0%
out on bail and uh are then charged with
 
01:45:21.410 --> 01:45:21.420 align:start position:0%
another crime
 
01:45:23.510 --> 01:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
or a third crime
 
01:45:26.930 --> 01:45:26.940 align:start position:0%
that group of people as uh attorney uh
 
01:45:30.109 --> 01:45:30.119 align:start position:0%
restein testified that just not very
 
01:45:32.750 --> 01:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
frequently are those people gonna be
 
01:45:32.760 --> 01:45:34.189 align:start position:0%
frequently are those people gonna be
released

01:45:34.189 --> 01:45:34.199 align:start position:0%
released
 
01:45:36.530 --> 01:45:36.540 align:start position:0%
on the second offense let alone the
 
01:45:38.709 --> 01:45:38.719 align:start position:0%
third offense it's just not very common
 
01:45:41.810 --> 01:45:41.820 align:start position:0%
the only reason it's common
 
01:45:44.930 --> 01:45:44.940 align:start position:0%
it the only reason it happens is if
 
01:45:48.350 --> 01:45:48.360 align:start position:0%
because a prosecutor doesn't bring a
 
01:45:50.689 --> 01:45:50.699 align:start position:0%
motion to revoke bail on the original
 
01:45:50.699 --> 01:45:51.950 align:start position:0%
motion to revoke bail on the original
felony

01:45:51.950 --> 01:45:51.960 align:start position:0%
felony
 
01:45:54.830 --> 01:45:54.840 align:start position:0%
some of you may have read in uh
 
01:45:56.870 --> 01:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
editorial an op-ed piece I wrote in the
 
01:45:59.270 --> 01:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
Manchester Union leader about a really
 
01:46:02.510 --> 01:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
tragic homicide case in Manchester where
 
01:46:05.270 --> 01:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
the individual was out on bail on an
 
01:46:07.510 --> 01:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
attempted first degree assault
 
01:46:11.629 --> 01:46:11.639 align:start position:0%
uh he committed another misdemeanor in
 
01:46:14.750 --> 01:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
early August and a set of misdemeanors
 
01:46:17.870 --> 01:46:17.880 align:start position:0%
in later August early September in
 
01:46:21.109 --> 01:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
neither of those instances uh the the
 
01:46:25.810 --> 01:46:25.820 align:start position:0%
the uh did the courts set bail that
 
01:46:28.250 --> 01:46:28.260 align:start position:0%
resulted in being held and he then is
 
01:46:31.370 --> 01:46:31.380 align:start position:0%
later charged with uh killing somebody
 
01:46:34.310 --> 01:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
in those two courts in the court hearing
 
01:46:37.189 --> 01:46:37.199 align:start position:0%
were those two misdemeanor sets
 
01:46:39.470 --> 01:46:39.480 align:start position:0%
subsequent to the first degree assault
 
01:46:41.270 --> 01:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
bail release
 
01:46:44.510 --> 01:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
the prosecutor didn't even bring up the
 
01:46:47.090 --> 01:46:47.100 align:start position:0%
fact that the defendant was out on first
 
01:46:49.910 --> 01:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
attempted first degree murder bail
 
01:46:53.030 --> 01:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
the problem with that circumstance
 
01:46:56.149 --> 01:46:56.159 align:start position:0%
was not the bail statute which
 
01:46:58.310 --> 01:46:58.320 align:start position:0%
completely capable of holding that
 
01:47:00.649 --> 01:47:00.659 align:start position:0%
person after those two sets of
 
01:47:02.870 --> 01:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
subsequent misdemeanors but the
 
01:47:04.910 --> 01:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
prosecutor in each of those misdemeanor
 
01:47:09.590 --> 01:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
sets didn't even bring up
 
01:47:11.689 --> 01:47:11.699 align:start position:0%
that he was out on Bayon attempted first
 
01:47:15.290 --> 01:47:15.300 align:start position:0%
degree murder and second the prosecutor
 
01:47:18.709 --> 01:47:18.719 align:start position:0%
on the attempted first degree assault
 
01:47:21.830 --> 01:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
didn't move in that case to revoke Veil
 
01:47:23.209 --> 01:47:23.219 align:start position:0%
because of the two subsequent
 
01:47:26.090 --> 01:47:26.100 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors sets of misdemeanors so
 
01:47:28.490 --> 01:47:28.500 align:start position:0%
that's a prosecutorial favor
 
01:47:32.090 --> 01:47:32.100 align:start position:0%
and I think with the felonies
 
01:47:34.189 --> 01:47:34.199 align:start position:0%
um where somebody's out on bail on a
 
01:47:36.410 --> 01:47:36.420 align:start position:0%
felony and subsequent offenses are
 
01:47:39.290 --> 01:47:39.300 align:start position:0%
occurred uh they're either getting held
 
01:47:41.149 --> 01:47:41.159 align:start position:0%
or prosecutors are just not bringing it
 
01:47:42.649 --> 01:47:42.659 align:start position:0%
to the attention of the Court not a
 
01:47:45.890 --> 01:47:45.900 align:start position:0%
failure of the bail statute a failure uh
 
01:47:48.470 --> 01:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
of in that instance prosecutorial
 
01:47:51.470 --> 01:47:51.480 align:start position:0%
Behavior the second set of crimes that's
 
01:47:53.510 --> 01:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
kind of buried in the current statute
 
01:47:56.450 --> 01:47:56.460 align:start position:0%
and and and the changes is Class A
 
01:47:56.460 --> 01:47:58.010 align:start position:0%
and and and the changes is Class A
misdemeanors

01:47:58.010 --> 01:47:58.020 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors
 
01:48:00.910 --> 01:48:00.920 align:start position:0%
now Class A misdemeanors can be
 
01:48:04.550 --> 01:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
shoplifting can be disorderly conduct
 
01:48:08.270 --> 01:48:08.280 align:start position:0%
uh uh can be Petty crimes
 
01:48:11.870 --> 01:48:11.880 align:start position:0%
under this statute if you commit three
 
01:48:15.050 --> 01:48:15.060 align:start position:0%
if you are out on bail on PR bail on a
 
01:48:17.510 --> 01:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
petty crime a disorderly conduct kind of
 
01:48:19.970 --> 01:48:19.980 align:start position:0%
yelling in public and you do that two
 
01:48:23.390 --> 01:48:23.400 align:start position:0%
more times uh before your original
 
01:48:25.310 --> 01:48:25.320 align:start position:0%
charges arrested this would
 
01:48:28.669 --> 01:48:28.679 align:start position:0%
automatically mean you go to jail
 
01:48:31.609 --> 01:48:31.619 align:start position:0%
I don't think we want this to work that
 
01:48:31.619 --> 01:48:32.570 align:start position:0%
I don't think we want this to work that
way

01:48:32.570 --> 01:48:32.580 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:48:35.990 --> 01:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
that's more of a street sweeping bail
 
01:48:38.270 --> 01:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
statute than it is something to deal
 
01:48:41.350 --> 01:48:41.360 align:start position:0%
with uh real issues
 
01:48:44.030 --> 01:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
more importantly let me go back to my
 
01:48:44.040 --> 01:48:45.470 align:start position:0%
more importantly let me go back to my
notes

01:48:45.470 --> 01:48:45.480 align:start position:0%
notes
 
01:48:45.480 --> 01:48:46.550 align:start position:0%
notes
um

01:48:46.550 --> 01:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:49.729 --> 01:48:49.739 align:start position:0%
we don't know how many of the first kind
 
01:48:54.050 --> 01:48:54.060 align:start position:0%
of uh uh felony followed by two
 
01:48:56.750 --> 01:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
subsequent arrests how many of those are
 
01:48:59.510 --> 01:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
there are out there whether the problem
 
01:49:04.129 --> 01:49:04.139 align:start position:0%
that Senator Abbas uh and the chief and
 
01:49:06.530 --> 01:49:06.540 align:start position:0%
others describe is a really significant
 
01:49:09.709 --> 01:49:09.719 align:start position:0%
problem or not we just don't have any
 
01:49:13.430 --> 01:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
data and we can't make keep making
 
01:49:16.790 --> 01:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
decisions without data based on this
 
01:49:19.070 --> 01:49:19.080 align:start position:0%
based on anecdote
 
01:49:19.080 --> 01:49:20.689 align:start position:0%
based on anecdote
um

01:49:20.689 --> 01:49:20.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:25.070 --> 01:49:25.080 align:start position:0%
what's left out is really telling what's
 
01:49:27.590 --> 01:49:27.600 align:start position:0%
left out from the way the statute is now
 
01:49:33.229 --> 01:49:33.239 align:start position:0%
to what is proposed are two things one
 
01:49:37.970 --> 01:49:37.980 align:start position:0%
the language that uh you can't you can't
 
01:49:40.189 --> 01:49:40.199 align:start position:0%
hold somebody based on a financial
 
01:49:43.370 --> 01:49:43.380 align:start position:0%
condition without the court determining
 
01:49:45.649 --> 01:49:45.659 align:start position:0%
by clear and convincing evidence that
 
01:49:48.109 --> 01:49:48.119 align:start position:0%
there's no reasonable alternatives
 
01:49:52.370 --> 01:49:52.380 align:start position:0%
the true failure bar any other comments
 
01:49:54.410 --> 01:49:54.420 align:start position:0%
that have been made of Senator abbas's
 
01:49:58.490 --> 01:49:58.500 align:start position:0%
proposal is it's unconstitutional
 
01:50:02.450 --> 01:50:02.460 align:start position:0%
U.S versus Salerno says if you're going
 
01:50:04.669 --> 01:50:04.679 align:start position:0%
to hold somebody
 
01:50:06.709 --> 01:50:06.719 align:start position:0%
without bail
 
01:50:09.530 --> 01:50:09.540 align:start position:0%
as Senator Abbas proposal
 
01:50:11.810 --> 01:50:11.820 align:start position:0%
recommends regardless of the
 
01:50:15.709 --> 01:50:15.719 align:start position:0%
circumstance you have to have a hearing
 
01:50:17.810 --> 01:50:17.820 align:start position:0%
he has to be the individual has to be
 
01:50:19.850 --> 01:50:19.860 align:start position:0%
represented by counsel
 
01:50:22.430 --> 01:50:22.440 align:start position:0%
and there has to be a burden that the
 
01:50:24.290 --> 01:50:24.300 align:start position:0%
state has to prove by clear and
 
01:50:27.229 --> 01:50:27.239 align:start position:0%
convincing evidence that they are
 
01:50:30.830 --> 01:50:30.840 align:start position:0%
dangerous you can't do it with just the
 
01:50:32.689 --> 01:50:32.699 align:start position:0%
rebuttable presumption it's
 
01:50:32.699 --> 01:50:35.750 align:start position:0%
rebuttable presumption it's
unconstitutional

01:50:35.750 --> 01:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:38.330 --> 01:50:38.340 align:start position:0%
um and and I think that's the Fatal flaw
 
01:50:40.910 --> 01:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
uh with this bill
 
01:50:40.920 --> 01:50:45.229 align:start position:0%
uh with this bill
um

01:50:45.229 --> 01:50:45.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:50.330 --> 01:50:50.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:51.649 --> 01:50:51.659 align:start position:0%
I think
 
01:50:54.050 --> 01:50:54.060 align:start position:0%
slowly but surely we're making progress
 
01:50:57.830 --> 01:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
on the issue of bail and bail reform and
 
01:50:59.870 --> 01:50:59.880 align:start position:0%
how the system should work
 
01:51:02.570 --> 01:51:02.580 align:start position:0%
I know uh representative representative
 
01:51:05.770 --> 01:51:05.780 align:start position:0%
Harriet gathright has had a proposal for
 
01:51:08.750 --> 01:51:08.760 align:start position:0%
magistrate judges and that was turned
 
01:51:12.169 --> 01:51:12.179 align:start position:0%
into a study committee which is making
 
01:51:14.270 --> 01:51:14.280 align:start position:0%
its way through the sis the the
 
01:51:16.910 --> 01:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
legislative system I'm very optimistic
 
01:51:19.729 --> 01:51:19.739 align:start position:0%
about that I know represent the chair
 
01:51:24.410 --> 01:51:24.420 align:start position:0%
has uh has gotten into uh the budget a
 
01:51:27.229 --> 01:51:27.239 align:start position:0%
proposal for funding for a real-time
 
01:51:31.729 --> 01:51:31.739 align:start position:0%
bail situation so prosecutors know when
 
01:51:33.590 --> 01:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
they look at a person arrested for
 
01:51:36.830 --> 01:51:36.840 align:start position:0%
something whether immediately not days
 
01:51:40.970 --> 01:51:40.980 align:start position:0%
later but immediately whether there is a
 
01:51:43.250 --> 01:51:43.260 align:start position:0%
uh a pending when the person is already
 
01:51:46.250 --> 01:51:46.260 align:start position:0%
out on bail those developments are very
 
01:51:49.970 --> 01:51:49.980 align:start position:0%
promising and I know a number of uh bail
 
01:51:52.570 --> 01:51:52.580 align:start position:0%
bills arising out of the house have been
 
01:51:56.649 --> 01:51:56.659 align:start position:0%
retained in hopes of having a collective
 
01:52:02.030 --> 01:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
Gathering and this and and uh process of
 
01:52:03.410 --> 01:52:03.420 align:start position:0%
sorting out
 
01:52:06.470 --> 01:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
what adjustments that we can what
 
01:52:08.750 --> 01:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
adjustments can we make to the bail
 
01:52:12.290 --> 01:52:12.300 align:start position:0%
system with all the stakeholders present
 
01:52:15.470 --> 01:52:15.480 align:start position:0%
in that discussion not trying to deal
 
01:52:19.490 --> 01:52:19.500 align:start position:0%
with it by one bill offered by a senator
 
01:52:22.189 --> 01:52:22.199 align:start position:0%
another bill offered by a representative
 
01:52:24.709 --> 01:52:24.719 align:start position:0%
another bill offered by a senator you
 
01:52:26.570 --> 01:52:26.580 align:start position:0%
know individual tweaks here and there
 
01:52:30.109 --> 01:52:30.119 align:start position:0%
let's look at it as a package let's have
 
01:52:33.530 --> 01:52:33.540 align:start position:0%
all the stakeholders with roles in the
 
01:52:36.050 --> 01:52:36.060 align:start position:0%
system and I think I think this
 
01:52:39.350 --> 01:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
committee has done great work in hearing
 
01:52:41.330 --> 01:52:41.340 align:start position:0%
from more and more people in visiting
 
01:52:44.149 --> 01:52:44.159 align:start position:0%
jails and visiting the court system I
 
01:52:46.430 --> 01:52:46.440 align:start position:0%
think that is the way to approach this
 
01:52:49.189 --> 01:52:49.199 align:start position:0%
and we've made more progress in thinking
 
01:52:51.530 --> 01:52:51.540 align:start position:0%
through how to reach good Solutions
 
01:52:53.930 --> 01:52:53.940 align:start position:0%
without knowing exactly what the right
 
01:52:56.090 --> 01:52:56.100 align:start position:0%
solution would be by the efforts that
 
01:52:58.129 --> 01:52:58.139 align:start position:0%
have been made by representative Herod
 
01:53:01.010 --> 01:53:01.020 align:start position:0%
gathright by representative Roy uh by
 
01:53:03.109 --> 01:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
this Committee in retaining bills so I
 
01:53:05.750 --> 01:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
am encourage this committee to retain
 
01:53:08.810 --> 01:53:08.820 align:start position:0%
this bill looking at the time I'm not
 
01:53:11.030 --> 01:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
sure I'm going to be here
 
01:53:13.209 --> 01:53:13.219 align:start position:0%
for the next bill
 
01:53:17.930 --> 01:53:17.940 align:start position:0%
you have heard my thoughts uh in terms
 
01:53:21.590 --> 01:53:21.600 align:start position:0%
of this this the senator Susie's bill
 
01:53:25.550 --> 01:53:25.560 align:start position:0%
which is very similar to uh
 
01:53:28.090 --> 01:53:28.100 align:start position:0%
uh Senator Bradley's bill of last year
 
01:53:30.590 --> 01:53:30.600 align:start position:0%
you've heard my thoughts you've all
 
01:53:32.950 --> 01:53:32.960 align:start position:0%
received a copy of my study
 
01:53:36.950 --> 01:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
that is ongoing I will point out that we
 
01:53:38.750 --> 01:53:38.760 align:start position:0%
continue to increase the number of cases
 
01:53:41.030 --> 01:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
we look at I think we're we're over a
 
01:53:43.370 --> 01:53:43.380 align:start position:0%
thousand now we're seeing no appreciable
 
01:53:47.810 --> 01:53:47.820 align:start position:0%
change in in the results of that study
 
01:53:50.030 --> 01:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
um so um
 
01:53:54.649 --> 01:53:54.659 align:start position:0%
I have strong hopes that if this bill
 
01:53:56.930 --> 01:53:56.940 align:start position:0%
and the subsequent bill is retained we
 
01:53:58.129 --> 01:53:58.139 align:start position:0%
can have
 
01:54:01.790 --> 01:54:01.800 align:start position:0%
we can really think well
 
01:54:03.970 --> 01:54:03.980 align:start position:0%
with input from everybody
 
01:54:07.790 --> 01:54:07.800 align:start position:0%
how to manage the concerns such as they
 
01:54:10.010 --> 01:54:10.020 align:start position:0%
are with the bail bill as it currently
 
01:54:13.729 --> 01:54:13.739 align:start position:0%
exists uh thank you for listening to me
 
01:54:19.870 --> 01:54:19.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:23.149 --> 01:54:23.159 align:start position:0%
oh representative Manion
 
01:54:24.470 --> 01:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:54:26.689 --> 01:54:26.699 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh you mentioned us
 
01:54:29.270 --> 01:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
talking about the data so I'm this
 
01:54:32.149 --> 01:54:32.159 align:start position:0%
question is about the data of the 504
 
01:54:33.770 --> 01:54:33.780 align:start position:0%
cases that you cited and was also
 
01:54:35.990 --> 01:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned by the gentleman from the ACLU
 
01:54:38.810 --> 01:54:38.820 align:start position:0%
of those 504 cases
 
01:54:41.209 --> 01:54:41.219 align:start position:0%
how many were
 
01:54:45.050 --> 01:54:45.060 align:start position:0%
on a person who is out on bail two times
 
01:54:47.629 --> 01:54:47.639 align:start position:0%
prior for felonies Class A misdemeanors
 
01:54:49.790 --> 01:54:49.800 align:start position:0%
or DUI charges
 
01:54:52.310 --> 01:54:52.320 align:start position:0%
then gets arrested a third time for a
 
01:54:53.510 --> 01:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
similar offense
 
01:54:56.090 --> 01:54:56.100 align:start position:0%
had all of those cases non-processed
 
01:55:00.590 --> 01:55:00.600 align:start position:0%
we could not uh look at that because we
 
01:55:02.870 --> 01:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
were limited by the case summary sheet
 
01:55:05.330 --> 01:55:05.340 align:start position:0%
we were looking at and the case summary
 
01:55:08.750 --> 01:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
sheet only has on it those which the
 
01:55:12.649 --> 01:55:12.659 align:start position:0%
person is charged with in that incident
 
01:55:15.229 --> 01:55:15.239 align:start position:0%
so it's an incident by incident case
 
01:55:18.050 --> 01:55:18.060 align:start position:0%
summary sheet it doesn't include in it
 
01:55:21.950 --> 01:55:21.960 align:start position:0%
other subsequent or previous charges
 
01:55:25.370 --> 01:55:25.380 align:start position:0%
from other incidents so we have no way
 
01:55:29.870 --> 01:55:29.880 align:start position:0%
of and we have no way of tracking that
 
01:55:33.770 --> 01:55:33.780 align:start position:0%
through the case summary sheet so I I
 
01:55:36.229 --> 01:55:36.239 align:start position:0%
can't answer the question I'd like to
 
01:55:38.030 --> 01:55:38.040 align:start position:0%
answer the question but that's too
 
01:55:40.310 --> 01:55:40.320 align:start position:0%
complicated uh a data collection thing
 
01:55:40.320 --> 01:55:41.510 align:start position:0%
complicated uh a data collection thing
unfortunately

01:55:41.510 --> 01:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
01:55:44.750 --> 01:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
thank you uh so that data would not
 
01:55:49.930 --> 01:55:49.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:53.570 --> 01:55:53.580 align:start position:0%
ah yes and no thank you
 
01:55:57.290 --> 01:55:57.300 align:start position:0%
uh no big yes uh it would apply because
 
01:55:59.510 --> 01:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
some of those were
 
01:56:02.030 --> 01:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
foundational charges might have been the
 
01:56:04.729 --> 01:56:04.739 align:start position:0%
first felony uh that would count under
 
01:56:06.649 --> 01:56:06.659 align:start position:0%
this bill or the second one or the third
 
01:56:08.629 --> 01:56:08.639 align:start position:0%
one we just don't know that one way or
 
01:56:11.090 --> 01:56:11.100 align:start position:0%
another no in that we can't track it as
 
01:56:12.229 --> 01:56:12.239 align:start position:0%
you described
 
01:56:14.510 --> 01:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
represent Prue
 
01:56:17.990 --> 01:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
so I'm not a big data guy but that
 
01:56:20.149 --> 01:56:20.159 align:start position:0%
sounds like flawed data to me if you
 
01:56:23.209 --> 01:56:23.219 align:start position:0%
can't answer all those questions and see
 
01:56:24.770 --> 01:56:24.780 align:start position:0%
all their previous
 
01:56:24.780 --> 01:56:26.750 align:start position:0%
all their previous
record

01:56:26.750 --> 01:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
record
 
01:56:28.970 --> 01:56:28.980 align:start position:0%
and what's pending on them
 
01:56:32.570 --> 01:56:32.580 align:start position:0%
that's not data oh it it's data for what
 
01:56:35.270 --> 01:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
we represented as we don't represent it
 
01:56:38.629 --> 01:56:38.639 align:start position:0%
as a comprehensive study of of the kind
 
01:56:41.510 --> 01:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative Manion uh I and I when
 
01:56:44.750 --> 01:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
I testify to that study I represented it
 
01:56:47.990 --> 01:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
just as what it was and I appreciate
 
01:56:51.770 --> 01:56:51.780 align:start position:0%
that it's not perfect data it doesn't uh
 
01:56:53.030 --> 01:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
it doesn't
 
01:56:56.030 --> 01:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
um capture uh everything that's going on
 
01:56:58.609 --> 01:56:58.619 align:start position:0%
in the system but uh to be fair
 
01:57:00.770 --> 01:57:00.780 align:start position:0%
representative Prue I did not represent
 
01:57:03.169 --> 01:57:03.179 align:start position:0%
it as a complete picture of what's going
 
01:57:03.179 --> 01:57:04.490 align:start position:0%
it as a complete picture of what's going
on

01:57:04.490 --> 01:57:04.500 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:57:07.910 --> 01:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
um the problem is and this is for this
 
01:57:10.070 --> 01:57:10.080 align:start position:0%
committee and other committees to solve
 
01:57:13.850 --> 01:57:13.860 align:start position:0%
if they want true data complete data of
 
01:57:16.310 --> 01:57:16.320 align:start position:0%
the type you want is you need to spend
 
01:57:20.209 --> 01:57:20.219 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars to to uh so the
 
01:57:22.490 --> 01:57:22.500 align:start position:0%
court system can purchase a data
 
01:57:26.030 --> 01:57:26.040 align:start position:0%
collection system which Software System
 
01:57:29.689 --> 01:57:29.699 align:start position:0%
which they don't have then we could get
 
01:57:33.890 --> 01:57:33.900 align:start position:0%
the data that we all want but that has
 
01:57:36.530 --> 01:57:36.540 align:start position:0%
not happened yet I've I've you know for
 
01:57:38.870 --> 01:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
five years I have been arguing that we
 
01:57:43.790 --> 01:57:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:48.709 --> 01:57:48.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:52.790 --> 01:57:52.800 align:start position:0%
on this on your flawed data now one I
 
01:57:55.250 --> 01:57:55.260 align:start position:0%
disagree with you uh on on it being
 
01:57:57.950 --> 01:57:57.960 align:start position:0%
flawed data it's not flawed in what we
 
01:58:01.370 --> 01:58:01.380 align:start position:0%
represent the data to be I'm not asking
 
01:58:04.189 --> 01:58:04.199 align:start position:0%
you to make a decision based on this
 
01:58:08.810 --> 01:58:08.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:11.689 --> 01:58:11.699 align:start position:0%
I I raised the issue of the study
 
01:58:15.050 --> 01:58:15.060 align:start position:0%
because it had previously been been
 
01:58:19.070 --> 01:58:19.080 align:start position:0%
raised by one of the prior Witnesses
 
01:58:22.250 --> 01:58:22.260 align:start position:0%
representative um Cameron
 
01:58:23.750 --> 01:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:58:26.510 --> 01:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh I found it very
 
01:58:28.430 --> 01:58:28.440 align:start position:0%
interesting when you said
 
01:58:33.290 --> 01:58:33.300 align:start position:0%
that a person that commits a petty theft
 
01:58:35.870 --> 01:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
would be subject to this bill
 
01:58:38.510 --> 01:58:38.520 align:start position:0%
if it's charged as a Class A yes
 
01:58:41.450 --> 01:58:41.460 align:start position:0%
well I just looked up the statute if
 
01:58:43.010 --> 01:58:43.020 align:start position:0%
it's less than a thousand dollars it's a
 
01:58:44.810 --> 01:58:44.820 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor and that means that the
 
01:58:48.229 --> 01:58:48.239 align:start position:0%
prosecutor has the wherewithal to CL in
 
01:58:50.750 --> 01:58:50.760 align:start position:0%
charge of the Class B and you also said
 
01:58:50.760 --> 01:58:52.609 align:start position:0%
charge of the Class B and you also said
that

01:58:52.609 --> 01:58:52.619 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:58:54.109 --> 01:58:54.119 align:start position:0%
um it would be unconstitutional because
 
01:58:55.310 --> 01:58:55.320 align:start position:0%
they weren't they didn't have
 
01:58:57.109 --> 01:58:57.119 align:start position:0%
representation while a Class A
 
01:58:58.970 --> 01:58:58.980 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor requires representation
 
01:59:01.790 --> 01:59:01.800 align:start position:0%
under our constitution so how do you
 
01:59:05.030 --> 01:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
square that uh what I said was if they
 
01:59:07.070 --> 01:59:07.080 align:start position:0%
didn't have representation and the
 
01:59:09.229 --> 01:59:09.239 align:start position:0%
burden of proof was not clear and
 
01:59:11.450 --> 01:59:11.460 align:start position:0%
convincing the you need both those
 
01:59:16.129 --> 01:59:16.139 align:start position:0%
things uh the the statute proposed the
 
01:59:18.229 --> 01:59:18.239 align:start position:0%
amendment proposed by Senator Abbotts
 
01:59:20.570 --> 01:59:20.580 align:start position:0%
eliminates the clear and convincing
 
01:59:22.330 --> 01:59:22.340 align:start position:0%
standard of proof that's what's
 
01:59:25.790 --> 01:59:25.800 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional about it uh number one
 
01:59:28.850 --> 01:59:28.860 align:start position:0%
number two some prosecutors choose to
 
01:59:31.850 --> 01:59:31.860 align:start position:0%
charge uh a petty theft as a Class A
 
01:59:34.010 --> 01:59:34.020 align:start position:0%
some choose to charge it as a Class B
 
01:59:36.709 --> 01:59:36.719 align:start position:0%
many prosecutors choose to charge it as
 
01:59:38.689 --> 01:59:38.699 align:start position:0%
a Class B so the person won't have
 
01:59:38.699 --> 01:59:43.790 align:start position:0%
a Class B so the person won't have
counsel

01:59:43.790 --> 01:59:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:48.410 --> 01:59:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:01.550 --> 02:00:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:03.350 --> 02:00:03.360 align:start position:0%
morning Mr chairman members of the
 
02:00:04.850 --> 02:00:04.860 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Richard head I'm
 
02:00:06.589 --> 02:00:06.599 align:start position:0%
the government Affairs coordinator for
 
02:00:09.050 --> 02:00:09.060 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch judicial branch has
 
02:00:10.850 --> 02:00:10.860 align:start position:0%
no position on the policy of this bill
 
02:00:13.430 --> 02:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
and that's not the point of my comments
 
02:00:15.890 --> 02:00:15.900 align:start position:0%
today I did want to address one of the
 
02:00:17.629 --> 02:00:17.639 align:start position:0%
thought one of the issues that was
 
02:00:20.229 --> 02:00:20.239 align:start position:0%
identified in our fiscal note which was
 
02:00:23.930 --> 02:00:23.940 align:start position:0%
an ability to interpret some of the
 
02:00:25.910 --> 02:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
language in the bill and I've spoken
 
02:00:28.010 --> 02:00:28.020 align:start position:0%
briefly with with Senator Abbas about
 
02:00:32.109 --> 02:00:32.119 align:start position:0%
this as you run through the bill
 
02:00:35.209 --> 02:00:35.219 align:start position:0%
it's essentially a three strikes bill so
 
02:00:37.910 --> 02:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
in the first part of it says if there's
 
02:00:39.709 --> 02:00:39.719 align:start position:0%
probable cause to believe that a person
 
02:00:43.430 --> 02:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
while on release uh pending resolution
 
02:00:45.830 --> 02:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
of a previous offense committed a Class
 
02:00:48.410 --> 02:00:48.420 align:start position:0%
A misdemeanor or driving or operating
 
02:00:50.270 --> 02:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
while impaired and then it goes on to
 
02:00:53.149 --> 02:00:53.159 align:start position:0%
say was released on bail and thereafter
 
02:00:55.669 --> 02:00:55.679 align:start position:0%
was arrested it does not repeat that
 
02:00:58.550 --> 02:00:58.560 align:start position:0%
same language about release pending
 
02:01:01.010 --> 02:01:01.020 align:start position:0%
resolution of a previous offense so it
 
02:01:03.109 --> 02:01:03.119 align:start position:0%
simply said is essentially on the third
 
02:01:05.510 --> 02:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
offense thereafter after the first two
 
02:01:07.550 --> 02:01:07.560 align:start position:0%
offenses without tying without
 
02:01:10.129 --> 02:01:10.139 align:start position:0%
affirmatively tying it to the other two
 
02:01:11.990 --> 02:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
offenses and the status of the other two
 
02:01:14.629 --> 02:01:14.639 align:start position:0%
offenses in our fiscal note
 
02:01:17.270 --> 02:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh we wrote that we assumed that both of
 
02:01:20.510 --> 02:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
those prior to offenses had to still be
 
02:01:22.490 --> 02:01:22.500 align:start position:0%
active essentially at the time of the
 
02:01:24.050 --> 02:01:24.060 align:start position:0%
third arrest
 
02:01:26.990 --> 02:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
um and and based on on Senator abbas's
 
02:01:28.970 --> 02:01:28.980 align:start position:0%
testimony I believe that was the intent
 
02:01:30.970 --> 02:01:30.980 align:start position:0%
it could be
 
02:01:33.770 --> 02:01:33.780 align:start position:0%
resolved by simply saying where it says
 
02:01:36.649 --> 02:01:36.659 align:start position:0%
and thereafter on line 13 while on
 
02:01:38.810 --> 02:01:38.820 align:start position:0%
release pending resolution of the prior
 
02:01:40.910 --> 02:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
to offenses essentially reincorporate
 
02:01:43.850 --> 02:01:43.860 align:start position:0%
that language into the bill
 
02:01:46.430 --> 02:01:46.440 align:start position:0%
um would at least help clarify that
 
02:01:46.440 --> 02:01:47.750 align:start position:0%
um would at least help clarify that
ambiguity

02:01:47.750 --> 02:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
ambiguity
 
02:01:50.510 --> 02:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
the other issue that creates some level
 
02:01:53.629 --> 02:01:53.639 align:start position:0%
of ambiguity is that all of these rely
 
02:01:56.149 --> 02:01:56.159 align:start position:0%
upon knowledge of the status of Baal at
 
02:01:58.550 --> 02:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
the time of arrest and as as has been
 
02:02:00.169 --> 02:02:00.179 align:start position:0%
commented on
 
02:02:01.370 --> 02:02:01.380 align:start position:0%
um based on some of the work that
 
02:02:03.410 --> 02:02:03.420 align:start position:0%
chairman Roy has done there is work
 
02:02:06.950 --> 02:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
that's that's going forward hopefully
 
02:02:09.589 --> 02:02:09.599 align:start position:0%
that will provide some information about
 
02:02:12.430 --> 02:02:12.440 align:start position:0%
the status of bail when the bail is is
 
02:02:15.229 --> 02:02:15.239 align:start position:0%
uh is issued
 
02:02:18.709 --> 02:02:18.719 align:start position:0%
what happens though is that bail can
 
02:02:20.870 --> 02:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
change over time or that a case is
 
02:02:24.410 --> 02:02:24.420 align:start position:0%
resolved at a certain point in that I
 
02:02:26.089 --> 02:02:26.099 align:start position:0%
don't believe would be tracked under
 
02:02:28.550 --> 02:02:28.560 align:start position:0%
that system it's essentially a snapshot
 
02:02:32.689 --> 02:02:32.699 align:start position:0%
of bail at the time bail was issued and
 
02:02:36.950 --> 02:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
then thereafter you know an individual
 
02:02:39.649 --> 02:02:39.659 align:start position:0%
the the status of that bail may not be
 
02:02:42.770 --> 02:02:42.780 align:start position:0%
reflected in that same system it in the
 
02:02:45.109 --> 02:02:45.119 align:start position:0%
same real time and I honestly don't know
 
02:02:46.850 --> 02:02:46.860 align:start position:0%
the answer to that whether would or
 
02:02:49.010 --> 02:02:49.020 align:start position:0%
wouldn't but I think that's a somewhat
 
02:02:51.649 --> 02:02:51.659 align:start position:0%
more complicated system and as has been
 
02:02:53.810 --> 02:02:53.820 align:start position:0%
noted we do not currently in the
 
02:02:55.870 --> 02:02:55.880 align:start position:0%
judicial branch keep a real-time
 
02:02:58.490 --> 02:02:58.500 align:start position:0%
database that is available to law
 
02:03:00.530 --> 02:03:00.540 align:start position:0%
enforcement at the time of arrest that
 
02:03:02.810 --> 02:03:02.820 align:start position:0%
would give the status of bail at the
 
02:03:06.350 --> 02:03:06.360 align:start position:0%
time of arrest we do rely in in terms of
 
02:03:07.910 --> 02:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
a of a court proceeding on the
 
02:03:10.189 --> 02:03:10.199 align:start position:0%
prosecutor to bring forward the status
 
02:03:13.490 --> 02:03:13.500 align:start position:0%
of any uh prior offenses that an
 
02:03:15.770 --> 02:03:15.780 align:start position:0%
individual is is being presented to a
 
02:03:19.910 --> 02:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
judge as it relates to a hearing before
 
02:03:22.070 --> 02:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
a judge so I just want to make those two
 
02:03:23.750 --> 02:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
points but make clear we do not have a
 
02:03:26.450 --> 02:03:26.460 align:start position:0%
position on the on the policy of this
 
02:03:28.250 --> 02:03:28.260 align:start position:0%
bill with that I'd be happy to answer
 
02:03:32.450 --> 02:03:32.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:35.930 --> 02:03:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:38.450 --> 02:03:38.460 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry Terry I just have a lot of
 
02:03:38.460 --> 02:03:40.070 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry Terry I just have a lot of
questions

02:03:40.070 --> 02:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:03:42.229 --> 02:03:42.239 align:start position:0%
um thanks for taking my question are you
 
02:03:43.910 --> 02:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
I feel like what I'm hearing is that I
 
02:03:45.530 --> 02:03:45.540 align:start position:0%
want to know if if I understand you
 
02:03:47.330 --> 02:03:47.340 align:start position:0%
correctly that it's possible like it's
 
02:03:51.169 --> 02:03:51.179 align:start position:0%
within the realm of possibility to be
 
02:03:51.179 --> 02:03:52.010 align:start position:0%
within the realm of possibility to be
um

02:03:52.010 --> 02:03:52.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:56.810 --> 02:03:56.820 align:start position:0%
if this passed to be incarcerated
 
02:04:00.890 --> 02:04:00.900 align:start position:0%
um for bail violations after the case
 
02:04:02.870 --> 02:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
has been resolved for which you were
 
02:04:05.930 --> 02:04:05.940 align:start position:0%
under bail conditions like am I making
 
02:04:08.089 --> 02:04:08.099 align:start position:0%
sense it sounds like because of the
 
02:04:11.149 --> 02:04:11.159 align:start position:0%
limitations of data and tracking cases
 
02:04:14.689 --> 02:04:14.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:14.699 --> 02:04:16.609 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:04:16.609 --> 02:04:16.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:18.890 --> 02:04:18.900 align:start position:0%
in trouble for violating bail conditions
 
02:04:21.709 --> 02:04:21.719 align:start position:0%
that no longer apply you know I think so
 
02:04:22.729 --> 02:04:22.739 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I think it's
 
02:04:24.830 --> 02:04:24.840 align:start position:0%
more likely to occur the other way which
 
02:04:27.350 --> 02:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
is a person would not be held in
 
02:04:30.109 --> 02:04:30.119 align:start position:0%
detention because the time of the third
 
02:04:31.850 --> 02:04:31.860 align:start position:0%
arrest they may not know the status of
 
02:04:34.970 --> 02:04:34.980 align:start position:0%
the other two bail proceedings so I I I
 
02:04:36.950 --> 02:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
think the risk is greater in the other
 
02:04:39.169 --> 02:04:39.179 align:start position:0%
direction which is
 
02:04:40.910 --> 02:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
um the person would not be detained on
 
02:04:43.490 --> 02:04:43.500 align:start position:0%
the third rest because the con the
 
02:04:45.169 --> 02:04:45.179 align:start position:0%
status of the prior to arrest may not be
 
02:04:49.189 --> 02:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:50.750 --> 02:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
thanks for that that helped me
 
02:04:52.430 --> 02:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
understand a lot so it's not that
 
02:04:55.550 --> 02:04:55.560 align:start position:0%
someone might go to jail when they
 
02:04:57.350 --> 02:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
really shouldn't is that they won't go
 
02:04:59.390 --> 02:04:59.400 align:start position:0%
to jail when they should under the
 
02:05:01.729 --> 02:05:01.739 align:start position:0%
current status of things I think that's
 
02:05:03.890 --> 02:05:03.900 align:start position:0%
the the more likely scenario based upon
 
02:05:05.930 --> 02:05:05.940 align:start position:0%
the lack of information about the status
 
02:05:10.550 --> 02:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:12.609 --> 02:05:12.619 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:05:15.189 --> 02:05:15.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:05:17.570 --> 02:05:17.580 align:start position:0%
so what what you were just talking about
 
02:05:19.790 --> 02:05:19.800 align:start position:0%
the the information would not be
 
02:05:19.800 --> 02:05:21.470 align:start position:0%
the the information would not be
available

02:05:21.470 --> 02:05:21.480 align:start position:0%
available
 
02:05:23.530 --> 02:05:23.540 align:start position:0%
um do we need to fix the information
 
02:05:26.689 --> 02:05:26.699 align:start position:0%
problems so that the judges and the
 
02:05:29.510 --> 02:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
prosecutors and whoever has the
 
02:05:32.870 --> 02:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
discretion makes better discretion than
 
02:05:35.629 --> 02:05:35.639 align:start position:0%
trying to Jerry rig the law around all
 
02:05:37.430 --> 02:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
the time to cover all the consequences
 
02:05:40.550 --> 02:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
and maybe catch people and I'm not going
 
02:05:43.550 --> 02:05:43.560 align:start position:0%
to use the rest of that analogy
 
02:05:47.030 --> 02:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
um that have never committed a crime and
 
02:05:49.790 --> 02:05:49.800 align:start position:0%
they've just got three arrests and they
 
02:05:52.490 --> 02:05:52.500 align:start position:0%
according to the way we have now changed
 
02:05:54.589 --> 02:05:54.599 align:start position:0%
the law they get caught in that
 
02:05:56.930 --> 02:05:56.940 align:start position:0%
situation do you does that make any
 
02:05:58.129 --> 02:05:58.139 align:start position:0%
sense to you
 
02:05:59.570 --> 02:05:59.580 align:start position:0%
um yes so thank you for the question and
 
02:06:01.550 --> 02:06:01.560 align:start position:0%
I think one I think the chairman has
 
02:06:03.770 --> 02:06:03.780 align:start position:0%
taken a significant first step towards
 
02:06:07.189 --> 02:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
getting information I do believe having
 
02:06:09.350 --> 02:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
that level of of
 
02:06:11.689 --> 02:06:11.699 align:start position:0%
immediately available information to law
 
02:06:14.089 --> 02:06:14.099 align:start position:0%
enforcement at the time of rest is an
 
02:06:17.870 --> 02:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
important aspect of of the system what
 
02:06:21.589 --> 02:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
it would take though is a considerable
 
02:06:26.390 --> 02:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
level of resources both in terms of
 
02:06:28.729 --> 02:06:28.739 align:start position:0%
technology that would be at the court
 
02:06:31.129 --> 02:06:31.139 align:start position:0%
system and communicating outside of the
 
02:06:34.790 --> 02:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
court system and unfortunately Personnel
 
02:06:34.800 --> 02:06:35.830 align:start position:0%
court system and unfortunately Personnel
because

02:06:35.830 --> 02:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:06:38.510 --> 02:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
there are a large number of bail
 
02:06:42.350 --> 02:06:42.360 align:start position:0%
decisions being made daily and and to be
 
02:06:45.530 --> 02:06:45.540 align:start position:0%
able to input bail decisions into a
 
02:06:47.330 --> 02:06:47.340 align:start position:0%
system immediately such that it is
 
02:06:49.790 --> 02:06:49.800 align:start position:0%
thereafter immediately available takes
 
02:06:53.270 --> 02:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
human resources to be able to monitor
 
02:06:55.550 --> 02:06:55.560 align:start position:0%
bail decisions as they're being made in
 
02:06:57.770 --> 02:06:57.780 align:start position:0%
real time and input that into a system
 
02:07:00.410 --> 02:07:00.420 align:start position:0%
in real time and then have that system
 
02:07:03.950 --> 02:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
immediately accessible and it's a it is
 
02:07:07.129 --> 02:07:07.139 align:start position:0%
a complicated certainly a doable but it
 
02:07:09.290 --> 02:07:09.300 align:start position:0%
would require a large number of human
 
02:07:13.070 --> 02:07:13.080 align:start position:0%
resources and in technology that we
 
02:07:15.350 --> 02:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
currently sort of wouldn't be able to
 
02:07:16.729 --> 02:07:16.739 align:start position:0%
implement immediately
 
02:07:19.669 --> 02:07:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:21.649 --> 02:07:21.659 align:start position:0%
representative salic
 
02:07:24.830 --> 02:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so I just want to
 
02:07:25.970 --> 02:07:25.980 align:start position:0%
make sure I understand the full
 
02:07:28.010 --> 02:07:28.020 align:start position:0%
implications so if I were hypothetically
 
02:07:30.050 --> 02:07:30.060 align:start position:0%
a young college student
 
02:07:33.290 --> 02:07:33.300 align:start position:0%
during pledge week who was not of age to
 
02:07:36.129 --> 02:07:36.139 align:start position:0%
drink alcohol what got myself very drunk
 
02:07:38.570 --> 02:07:38.580 align:start position:0%
hypothetically right
 
02:07:41.030 --> 02:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
um and and during this pledge week then
 
02:07:43.430 --> 02:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
got arrested for drunken disorderly
 
02:07:46.609 --> 02:07:46.619 align:start position:0%
Behavior as a result of my pledge
 
02:07:46.619 --> 02:07:48.770 align:start position:0%
Behavior as a result of my pledge
choices

02:07:48.770 --> 02:07:48.780 align:start position:0%
choices
 
02:07:51.410 --> 02:07:51.420 align:start position:0%
um and then the next day was out with my
 
02:07:55.070 --> 02:07:55.080 align:start position:0%
pledge people again and this time as
 
02:07:57.109 --> 02:07:57.119 align:start position:0%
part of my pledge activities committed
 
02:08:00.709 --> 02:08:00.719 align:start position:0%
shoplifting of something of value
 
02:08:02.510 --> 02:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
so I've now got a second offense that
 
02:08:04.430 --> 02:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
fits within this criteria
 
02:08:07.010 --> 02:08:07.020 align:start position:0%
and then on the third day
 
02:08:09.169 --> 02:08:09.179 align:start position:0%
um perhaps representative attendance are
 
02:08:11.390 --> 02:08:11.400 align:start position:0%
it's gone back to being a police officer
 
02:08:13.790 --> 02:08:13.800 align:start position:0%
state police officer and sees me you
 
02:08:16.189 --> 02:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
know running through traffic on I-95 in
 
02:08:18.890 --> 02:08:18.900 align:start position:0%
an inebriated State and takes me into
 
02:08:20.689 --> 02:08:20.699 align:start position:0%
protective custody she's starting to
 
02:08:24.109 --> 02:08:24.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:27.169 --> 02:08:27.179 align:start position:0%
I've I've now got three offenses within
 
02:08:28.250 --> 02:08:28.260 align:start position:0%
one week
 
02:08:30.290 --> 02:08:30.300 align:start position:0%
and would that then necessitate based on
 
02:08:32.089 --> 02:08:32.099 align:start position:0%
the way this was written that I'd be
 
02:08:34.490 --> 02:08:34.500 align:start position:0%
held in jail because I would obviously
 
02:08:37.550 --> 02:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
not have been capable of adjudicating
 
02:08:39.290 --> 02:08:39.300 align:start position:0%
any of them yet
 
02:08:41.030 --> 02:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question so I'll
 
02:08:43.070 --> 02:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
make a couple assumptions one is at the
 
02:08:46.729 --> 02:08:46.739 align:start position:0%
first two events resulted in class A
 
02:08:48.890 --> 02:08:48.900 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors being charged the third
 
02:08:51.410 --> 02:08:51.420 align:start position:0%
offense would at least
 
02:08:54.470 --> 02:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
um initially uh I think the way I would
 
02:08:56.870 --> 02:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
read this result in in a detention
 
02:08:59.390 --> 02:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
hearing it does not require that
 
02:09:02.030 --> 02:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
detention be the permanent solution for
 
02:09:04.310 --> 02:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
that third offense it says simply that
 
02:09:06.530 --> 02:09:06.540 align:start position:0%
there's a rebuttable presumption that
 
02:09:08.089 --> 02:09:08.099 align:start position:0%
the person would not be able to abide so
 
02:09:11.209 --> 02:09:11.219 align:start position:0%
in that third instance
 
02:09:13.070 --> 02:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
um hypothetically you would be
 
02:09:16.850 --> 02:09:16.860 align:start position:0%
explaining to the judge how uh how you
 
02:09:20.089 --> 02:09:20.099 align:start position:0%
would rebut that presumption of uh of
 
02:09:24.350 --> 02:09:24.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:27.169 --> 02:09:27.179 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:29.030 --> 02:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
so if I as a Class A misdemeanor one of
 
02:09:31.609 --> 02:09:31.619 align:start position:0%
these others would that then put me in
 
02:09:32.870 --> 02:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
this situation
 
02:09:34.970 --> 02:09:34.980 align:start position:0%
as I read the bill I would put you in
 
02:09:36.530 --> 02:09:36.540 align:start position:0%
the position of having a rebuttable
 
02:09:38.689 --> 02:09:38.699 align:start position:0%
presumption but there is a presumption
 
02:09:41.450 --> 02:09:41.460 align:start position:0%
of pre-trial detention but you would be
 
02:09:44.030 --> 02:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
able to rebut that
 
02:09:46.669 --> 02:09:46.679 align:start position:0%
represent jambren thank you Mr chairman
 
02:09:48.950 --> 02:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
02:09:52.490 --> 02:09:52.500 align:start position:0%
um I understand bill has several stages
 
02:09:54.950 --> 02:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
you could be billed prior to the trial
 
02:09:57.550 --> 02:09:57.560 align:start position:0%
after the trial and the finding of guilt
 
02:09:59.870 --> 02:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
you're also billed until you're
 
02:09:59.880 --> 02:10:01.010 align:start position:0%
you're also billed until you're
sentenced

02:10:01.010 --> 02:10:01.020 align:start position:0%
sentenced
 
02:10:03.109 --> 02:10:03.119 align:start position:0%
and then after your sentence until you
 
02:10:05.330 --> 02:10:05.340 align:start position:0%
surrender to the house of correction
 
02:10:07.370 --> 02:10:07.380 align:start position:0%
you'd still be considered under unveil
 
02:10:09.350 --> 02:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
is that correct I think that's right I'm
 
02:10:11.930 --> 02:10:11.940 align:start position:0%
not this is not you're exceeding my
 
02:10:13.609 --> 02:10:13.619 align:start position:0%
level of of knowledge I did not practice
 
02:10:15.830 --> 02:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
criminal law so I always get a little
 
02:10:17.810 --> 02:10:17.820 align:start position:0%
bit uncomfortable when I get into a too
 
02:10:20.990 --> 02:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
much of a detail and follow up
 
02:10:23.750 --> 02:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh the reason for my question is is
 
02:10:26.149 --> 02:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
worded that while on release pending
 
02:10:29.149 --> 02:10:29.159 align:start position:0%
resolution uh Would we not consider the
 
02:10:31.729 --> 02:10:31.739 align:start position:0%
resolution to be the conviction
 
02:10:34.430 --> 02:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
I think that is an interpretation of it
 
02:10:37.609 --> 02:10:37.619 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:40.070 --> 02:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
is AB Newell
 
02:10:42.050 --> 02:10:42.060 align:start position:0%
uh representative pru has been waiting
 
02:10:43.430 --> 02:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
02:10:44.870 --> 02:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:10:46.609 --> 02:10:46.619 align:start position:0%
in your opinion listening to
 
02:10:48.410 --> 02:10:48.420 align:start position:0%
representative Seeley
 
02:10:51.410 --> 02:10:51.420 align:start position:0%
on a three-day spree perhaps she should
 
02:10:53.169 --> 02:10:53.179 align:start position:0%
have been held
 
02:10:56.030 --> 02:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
on the third judge before she went out
 
02:10:59.209 --> 02:10:59.219 align:start position:0%
and crashed on the fourth day
 
02:11:01.490 --> 02:11:01.500 align:start position:0%
I won't comment on her hypothetical oh
 
02:11:05.930 --> 02:11:05.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:07.370 --> 02:11:07.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:11:10.129 --> 02:11:10.139 align:start position:0%
taking my question Mr Ed my uh I'm
 
02:11:12.290 --> 02:11:12.300 align:start position:0%
curious you know yesterday of course we
 
02:11:13.729 --> 02:11:13.739 align:start position:0%
had a wonderful little presentation
 
02:11:13.739 --> 02:11:14.570 align:start position:0%
had a wonderful little presentation
about

02:11:14.570 --> 02:11:14.580 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:11:17.330 --> 02:11:17.340 align:start position:0%
um the drug courts and also mental
 
02:11:19.189 --> 02:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
health supports and I know that you know
 
02:11:20.390 --> 02:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about these type of
 
02:11:22.550 --> 02:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
cases a lot of the time you know as
 
02:11:24.709 --> 02:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
we've established in this hearing
 
02:11:26.689 --> 02:11:26.699 align:start position:0%
um you know it it very much overlaps
 
02:11:28.390 --> 02:11:28.400 align:start position:0%
with substance use
 
02:11:31.729 --> 02:11:31.739 align:start position:0%
issues and mental health issues right
 
02:11:33.169 --> 02:11:33.179 align:start position:0%
um so I I was wondering if you could
 
02:11:35.030 --> 02:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
just kind of uh clarify a little bit for
 
02:11:36.410 --> 02:11:36.420 align:start position:0%
everyone maybe people who weren't there
 
02:11:38.629 --> 02:11:38.639 align:start position:0%
yesterday with the state of mental
 
02:11:40.310 --> 02:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
health support is because I think you
 
02:11:42.770 --> 02:11:42.780 align:start position:0%
know we are seeing drug court expand but
 
02:11:44.570 --> 02:11:44.580 align:start position:0%
I think you know we're we're still in
 
02:11:46.070 --> 02:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
the process with mental health supports
 
02:11:47.149 --> 02:11:47.159 align:start position:0%
am I right
 
02:11:48.709 --> 02:11:48.719 align:start position:0%
um so thank you for the question yes I
 
02:11:48.719 --> 02:11:50.390 align:start position:0%
um so thank you for the question yes I
mean

02:11:50.390 --> 02:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
mean
 
02:11:53.149 --> 02:11:53.159 align:start position:0%
um so two parts one is is I do
 
02:11:55.609 --> 02:11:55.619 align:start position:0%
appreciate everyone's uh attendance
 
02:11:58.490 --> 02:11:58.500 align:start position:0%
yesterday at attending court and also
 
02:11:59.990 --> 02:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
the the presentation I know some of you
 
02:12:02.270 --> 02:12:02.280 align:start position:0%
were not able to make it if the
 
02:12:04.129 --> 02:12:04.139 align:start position:0%
committee in the in the chairman
 
02:12:06.649 --> 02:12:06.659 align:start position:0%
um would like uh judge Netto to present
 
02:12:07.970 --> 02:12:07.980 align:start position:0%
to the full committee at any future
 
02:12:10.250 --> 02:12:10.260 align:start position:0%
event by all means please feel free to
 
02:12:11.330 --> 02:12:11.340 align:start position:0%
reach out
 
02:12:15.109 --> 02:12:15.119 align:start position:0%
um and we can arrange that you know any
 
02:12:17.930 --> 02:12:17.940 align:start position:0%
aspect of when we're dealing with Drug
 
02:12:20.510 --> 02:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
Court mental health court and
 
02:12:24.589 --> 02:12:24.599 align:start position:0%
criminal cases in general there is in
 
02:12:28.550 --> 02:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
this large percentage of cases a mental
 
02:12:33.950 --> 02:12:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:37.669 --> 02:12:37.679 align:start position:0%
within the drug court system
 
02:12:39.830 --> 02:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
it is uh
 
02:12:43.850 --> 02:12:43.860 align:start position:0%
very actively tied towards treatment and
 
02:12:46.970 --> 02:12:46.980 align:start position:0%
that necessarily involves mental health
 
02:12:50.330 --> 02:12:50.340 align:start position:0%
and drug addiction issues based upon
 
02:12:52.850 --> 02:12:52.860 align:start position:0%
just the the close tie between between
 
02:12:54.470 --> 02:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
the two
 
02:12:56.689 --> 02:12:56.699 align:start position:0%
um but that said in terms of a mental
 
02:13:00.290 --> 02:13:00.300 align:start position:0%
health court we are at very early stages
 
02:13:03.709 --> 02:13:03.719 align:start position:0%
of being able to develop protocols and
 
02:13:08.589 --> 02:13:08.599 align:start position:0%
systems where there's a science-based uh
 
02:13:11.930 --> 02:13:11.940 align:start position:0%
protocols that can be implemented to
 
02:13:14.050 --> 02:13:14.060 align:start position:0%
have an effective mental health court
 
02:13:16.609 --> 02:13:16.619 align:start position:0%
and that is something that we are
 
02:13:19.370 --> 02:13:19.380 align:start position:0%
actively working on but is behind where
 
02:13:20.750 --> 02:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
we are in terms of the drug court
 
02:13:22.910 --> 02:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
implementation which has been a very
 
02:13:25.850 --> 02:13:25.860 align:start position:0%
successful program doesn't mean everyone
 
02:13:28.189 --> 02:13:28.199 align:start position:0%
graduates from it successfully but it
 
02:13:30.649 --> 02:13:30.659 align:start position:0%
means that within the parameters of the
 
02:13:32.209 --> 02:13:32.219 align:start position:0%
program we're having a great deal of
 
02:13:35.330 --> 02:13:35.340 align:start position:0%
success and and even within that context
 
02:13:39.229 --> 02:13:39.239 align:start position:0%
the use of punishment and reward is a
 
02:13:41.569 --> 02:13:41.579 align:start position:0%
very delicate balance in terms of
 
02:13:44.689 --> 02:13:44.699 align:start position:0%
ultimately achieving success for the for
 
02:13:47.030 --> 02:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
the persons that are involved and the
 
02:13:48.890 --> 02:13:48.900 align:start position:0%
degree and the nature of the punishment
 
02:13:50.810 --> 02:13:50.820 align:start position:0%
can ultimately affect whether or not
 
02:13:52.970 --> 02:13:52.980 align:start position:0%
there will be a successful outcome in
 
02:13:54.830 --> 02:13:54.840 align:start position:0%
that drug court proceeding and it's in
 
02:13:56.750 --> 02:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
there is a great deal of science-based
 
02:13:56.760 --> 02:13:59.229 align:start position:0%
there is a great deal of science-based
uh

02:13:59.229 --> 02:13:59.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:14:01.609 --> 02:14:01.619 align:start position:0%
processes that are being implemented in
 
02:14:04.010 --> 02:14:04.020 align:start position:0%
that system that we're starting to work
 
02:14:06.470 --> 02:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
on through mental health issues but but
 
02:14:10.550 --> 02:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
a a much more complicated and
 
02:14:10.560 --> 02:14:12.310 align:start position:0%
a a much more complicated and
um

02:14:12.310 --> 02:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:16.250 --> 02:14:16.260 align:start position:0%
and and not as as common in terms of of
 
02:14:18.770 --> 02:14:18.780 align:start position:0%
how courts are addressing it but we are
 
02:14:20.510 --> 02:14:20.520 align:start position:0%
starting down that process in that road
 
02:14:22.850 --> 02:14:22.860 align:start position:0%
but we're ways away from having a a
 
02:14:24.950 --> 02:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
well-implemented mental health court
 
02:14:24.960 --> 02:14:29.030 align:start position:0%
well-implemented mental health court
system

02:14:29.030 --> 02:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:32.270 --> 02:14:32.280 align:start position:0%
representative Sue Newman
 
02:14:35.270 --> 02:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking this question
 
02:14:37.370 --> 02:14:37.380 align:start position:0%
several times there have been comments
 
02:14:39.709 --> 02:14:39.719 align:start position:0%
about data collection and how useful
 
02:14:43.010 --> 02:14:43.020 align:start position:0%
that would be and I wrote down a data
 
02:14:46.370 --> 02:14:46.380 align:start position:0%
collection Software System are you aware
 
02:14:48.770 --> 02:14:48.780 align:start position:0%
of any states anywhere in the United
 
02:14:51.470 --> 02:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
States that do have a good working
 
02:14:51.480 --> 02:14:53.569 align:start position:0%
States that do have a good working
system

02:14:53.569 --> 02:14:53.579 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:14:54.709 --> 02:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
um so thank you for the question I've
 
02:14:54.719 --> 02:14:55.970 align:start position:0%
um so thank you for the question I've
not

02:14:55.970 --> 02:14:55.980 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:14:58.970 --> 02:14:58.980 align:start position:0%
um gone out personally to evaluate what
 
02:15:00.290 --> 02:15:00.300 align:start position:0%
other states are doing in terms of
 
02:15:03.310 --> 02:15:03.320 align:start position:0%
collecting bail data I suspect there are
 
02:15:05.390 --> 02:15:05.400 align:start position:0%
systems that are that are available to
 
02:15:08.149 --> 02:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
do it it's not that it is not possible
 
02:15:10.790 --> 02:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
to do it is the level of resources we
 
02:15:12.229 --> 02:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
would have to add into our current
 
02:15:14.810 --> 02:15:14.820 align:start position:0%
system to be able to do it so it's not
 
02:15:17.030 --> 02:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
only the technology but it's also the
 
02:15:20.270 --> 02:15:20.280 align:start position:0%
human resources to be able to ensure
 
02:15:23.689 --> 02:15:23.699 align:start position:0%
that we are keeping data because data
 
02:15:25.910 --> 02:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't get generated automatically
 
02:15:27.589 --> 02:15:27.599 align:start position:0%
somebody has to be putting it in and it
 
02:15:30.109 --> 02:15:30.119 align:start position:0%
has to be data that's useful and that
 
02:15:33.350 --> 02:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
ultimately can be available to to those
 
02:15:37.129 --> 02:15:37.139 align:start position:0%
who need it and that requires a human
 
02:15:41.390 --> 02:15:41.400 align:start position:0%
being to sit in in real time input data
 
02:15:43.970 --> 02:15:43.980 align:start position:0%
into the system on the status of bail
 
02:15:46.910 --> 02:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
and that that just requires in in
 
02:15:48.470 --> 02:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
essentially every Court somebody
 
02:15:51.050 --> 02:15:51.060 align:start position:0%
dedicated to being able to do that
 
02:15:53.030 --> 02:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
I mean we currently don't have that that
 
02:15:55.129 --> 02:15:55.139 align:start position:0%
level of resource or the technology to
 
02:15:57.229 --> 02:15:57.239 align:start position:0%
implement that and then it also has to
 
02:16:00.470 --> 02:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
communicate with in real time to an
 
02:16:02.209 --> 02:16:02.219 align:start position:0%
officer who's on you know in the street
 
02:16:05.569 --> 02:16:05.579 align:start position:0%
and we do have some information that
 
02:16:07.910 --> 02:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
does do that and and the question is
 
02:16:10.669 --> 02:16:10.679 align:start position:0%
trying to add an additional sort of
 
02:16:12.950 --> 02:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
level of information and data that's not
 
02:16:15.290 --> 02:16:15.300 align:start position:0%
currently in the system into that system
 
02:16:18.649 --> 02:16:18.659 align:start position:0%
and and it it just requires time
 
02:16:20.930 --> 02:16:20.940 align:start position:0%
technology in human beings
 
02:16:24.229 --> 02:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
and money and money yeah and that's
 
02:16:24.239 --> 02:16:27.589 align:start position:0%
and money and money yeah and that's
online

02:16:27.589 --> 02:16:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:29.330 --> 02:16:29.340 align:start position:0%
um so you know further questions thank
 
02:16:30.770 --> 02:16:30.780 align:start position:0%
you very much for your testimony thank
 
02:16:32.450 --> 02:16:32.460 align:start position:0%
you is there anyone else wishing to
 
02:16:33.830 --> 02:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
testifying this bill was not testified
 
02:16:35.570 --> 02:16:35.580 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
02:16:38.629 --> 02:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
see Nana hereby close the public hearing
 
02:16:38.639 --> 02:16:40.129 align:start position:0%
see Nana hereby close the public hearing
and

02:16:40.129 --> 02:16:40.139 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:16:40.139 --> 02:16:41.209 align:start position:0%
and
um

02:16:41.209 --> 02:16:41.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:42.830 --> 02:16:42.840 align:start position:0%
if anyone's here for the executive
 
02:16:44.570 --> 02:16:44.580 align:start position:0%
sessions I just want to give you a heads
 
02:16:46.910 --> 02:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
up we're probably not going to do those
 
02:16:48.410 --> 02:16:48.420 align:start position:0%
I'm going to end up opening and
 
02:16:50.990 --> 02:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
recessing them to next Wednesday so put
 
02:16:52.310 --> 02:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
it on your calendars if you're here to
 
02:16:54.290 --> 02:16:54.300 align:start position:0%
testify in the next bill
 
02:16:55.490 --> 02:16:55.500 align:start position:0%
um I know you've been here a while but
 
02:16:56.870 --> 02:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
we are going to take a 10-minute bio
 
02:17:08.830 --> 02:17:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:51.110 --> 02:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:53.150 --> 02:26:53.160 align:start position:0%
this point we're going to open the
 
02:26:54.889 --> 02:26:54.899 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
02:26:54.899 --> 02:26:56.389 align:start position:0%
public hearing
on

02:26:56.389 --> 02:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:27:02.030 --> 02:27:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:04.670 --> 02:27:04.680 align:start position:0%
and the chair recognizes Senator Susie
 
02:27:18.670 --> 02:27:18.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:21.170 --> 02:27:21.180 align:start position:0%
thank you so much Mr chairman for the
 
02:27:23.330 --> 02:27:23.340 align:start position:0%
record I'm Senator Donna soucy I
 
02:27:25.730 --> 02:27:25.740 align:start position:0%
represent Senate District 18 comprised
 
02:27:27.710 --> 02:27:27.720 align:start position:0%
of the town of Litchfield and five Wards
 
02:27:29.389 --> 02:27:29.399 align:start position:0%
in the city of Manchester
 
02:27:32.090 --> 02:27:32.100 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to start my testimony this
 
02:27:35.210 --> 02:27:35.220 align:start position:0%
morning by first thanking you and each
 
02:27:37.610 --> 02:27:37.620 align:start position:0%
one of the members of the committee I
 
02:27:39.889 --> 02:27:39.899 align:start position:0%
know the previous hearing was a long one
 
02:27:42.469 --> 02:27:42.479 align:start position:0%
I know the issues are difficult but I
 
02:27:45.170 --> 02:27:45.180 align:start position:0%
truly appreciated being here to hear the
 
02:27:47.030 --> 02:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
very thoughtful questions and discussion
 
02:27:50.270 --> 02:27:50.280 align:start position:0%
around this super important issue
 
02:27:51.770 --> 02:27:51.780 align:start position:0%
um there are some things that I
 
02:27:54.710 --> 02:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
certainly took away from the discussion
 
02:27:56.929 --> 02:27:56.939 align:start position:0%
and from the questions that were asked
 
02:28:00.050 --> 02:28:00.060 align:start position:0%
uh I have stack of file folders in front
 
02:28:02.090 --> 02:28:02.100 align:start position:0%
of me they actually all relate to the
 
02:28:05.990 --> 02:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
issue of bail reform and I say that
 
02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:07.429 align:start position:0%
issue of bail reform and I say that
because

02:28:07.429 --> 02:28:07.439 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:28:10.910 --> 02:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
I have been involved though not directly
 
02:28:14.030 --> 02:28:14.040 align:start position:0%
in the initial legislation or the study
 
02:28:16.550 --> 02:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
committee but have been involved in the
 
02:28:18.230 --> 02:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
issue for a while
 
02:28:20.870 --> 02:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
and I think
 
02:28:23.570 --> 02:28:23.580 align:start position:0%
what much of the testimony you heard on
 
02:28:28.210 --> 02:28:28.220 align:start position:0%
the previous bill should show is that
 
02:28:30.530 --> 02:28:30.540 align:start position:0%
contextually speaking
 
02:28:32.270 --> 02:28:32.280 align:start position:0%
they'll reform
 
02:28:34.670 --> 02:28:34.680 align:start position:0%
the first piece of legislation was
 
02:28:36.830 --> 02:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
introduced with
 
02:28:39.590 --> 02:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
a primary goal of ensuring that an
 
02:28:42.410 --> 02:28:42.420 align:start position:0%
individual doesn't sit in a jail simply
 
02:28:44.389 --> 02:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
because they don't have a dollar in
 
02:28:45.889 --> 02:28:45.899 align:start position:0%
their pocket
 
02:28:49.070 --> 02:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
and I think that still is one of the
 
02:28:51.650 --> 02:28:51.660 align:start position:0%
most important goals that finances alone
 
02:28:55.250 --> 02:28:55.260 align:start position:0%
should not be the reason that someone is
 
02:28:58.969 --> 02:28:58.979 align:start position:0%
stuck in jail but I do think that
 
02:29:02.929 --> 02:29:02.939 align:start position:0%
certainly many of those who spoke before
 
02:29:02.939 --> 02:29:03.830 align:start position:0%
certainly many of those who spoke before
me

02:29:03.830 --> 02:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
me
 
02:29:07.190 --> 02:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
sort of outlined what the system is that
 
02:29:10.190 --> 02:29:10.200 align:start position:0%
this new bell reform legislation knew
 
02:29:14.750 --> 02:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
five years ago was placed upon and that
 
02:29:18.110 --> 02:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
is a system that unfortunately is very
 
02:29:18.120 --> 02:29:20.030 align:start position:0%
is a system that unfortunately is very
inconsistent

02:29:20.030 --> 02:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
inconsistent
 
02:29:23.389 --> 02:29:23.399 align:start position:0%
that doesn't fully collect all of the
 
02:29:23.399 --> 02:29:25.190 align:start position:0%
that doesn't fully collect all of the
data

02:29:25.190 --> 02:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
data
 
02:29:28.370 --> 02:29:28.380 align:start position:0%
and I you know I had forgotten that the
 
02:29:29.990 --> 02:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
the good representative representative
 
02:29:32.809 --> 02:29:32.819 align:start position:0%
scitec has been a bail commissioner but
 
02:29:35.690 --> 02:29:35.700 align:start position:0%
I I do think that we
 
02:29:35.700 --> 02:29:37.070 align:start position:0%
I I do think that we
created

02:29:37.070 --> 02:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
created
 
02:29:39.950 --> 02:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
a system for the right reasons for good
 
02:29:39.960 --> 02:29:41.330 align:start position:0%
a system for the right reasons for good
reasons

02:29:41.330 --> 02:29:41.340 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
02:29:42.830 --> 02:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
but that we didn't have the
 
02:29:45.650 --> 02:29:45.660 align:start position:0%
infrastructure to support it and by that
 
02:29:47.450 --> 02:29:47.460 align:start position:0%
I'm not criticizing any of the
 
02:29:48.889 --> 02:29:48.899 align:start position:0%
individuals that serve as bail
 
02:29:51.770 --> 02:29:51.780 align:start position:0%
Commissioners or the court system
 
02:29:51.780 --> 02:29:52.969 align:start position:0%
Commissioners or the court system
but

02:29:52.969 --> 02:29:52.979 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:29:55.429 --> 02:29:55.439 align:start position:0%
there are a myriad of differences
 
02:29:59.210 --> 02:29:59.220 align:start position:0%
between what happens when someone is
 
02:30:01.790 --> 02:30:01.800 align:start position:0%
provided personal recognizance bail in
 
02:30:04.910 --> 02:30:04.920 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County versus in koas
 
02:30:04.920 --> 02:30:05.750 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County versus in koas
County

02:30:05.750 --> 02:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
County
 
02:30:10.070 --> 02:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
or Sullivan County we know that the bail
 
02:30:13.790 --> 02:30:13.800 align:start position:0%
Commissioners are not mandated to have
 
02:30:17.389 --> 02:30:17.399 align:start position:0%
training we know that many times the
 
02:30:19.849 --> 02:30:19.859 align:start position:0%
bail Commissioners go without any
 
02:30:19.859 --> 02:30:22.670 align:start position:0%
bail Commissioners go without any
compensation

02:30:22.670 --> 02:30:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:26.030 --> 02:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
um we have a number of things that I
 
02:30:28.250 --> 02:30:28.260 align:start position:0%
think are very important that we need to
 
02:30:30.170 --> 02:30:30.180 align:start position:0%
reflect upon I think there's some great
 
02:30:32.750 --> 02:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
work being done so you know heard
 
02:30:34.429 --> 02:30:34.439 align:start position:0%
earlier with the study committee that
 
02:30:37.070 --> 02:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
representative Harriet gathwaite uh
 
02:30:39.469 --> 02:30:39.479 align:start position:0%
introduced I think representative Roy's
 
02:30:41.809 --> 02:30:41.819 align:start position:0%
initiative to ensure that there are more
 
02:30:44.929 --> 02:30:44.939 align:start position:0%
resources are all very important
 
02:30:46.610 --> 02:30:46.620 align:start position:0%
but none of these things are going to
 
02:30:49.429 --> 02:30:49.439 align:start position:0%
happen at once
 
02:30:51.889 --> 02:30:51.899 align:start position:0%
these things have been systemic for a
 
02:30:51.899 --> 02:30:53.150 align:start position:0%
these things have been systemic for a
while

02:30:53.150 --> 02:30:53.160 align:start position:0%
while
 
02:30:55.610 --> 02:30:55.620 align:start position:0%
and I think if we sort of step back and
 
02:30:58.190 --> 02:30:58.200 align:start position:0%
look at that there are some discreet
 
02:31:02.090 --> 02:31:02.100 align:start position:0%
things that we can do to ensure that
 
02:31:05.330 --> 02:31:05.340 align:start position:0%
we're doing our job as legislators
 
02:31:08.030 --> 02:31:08.040 align:start position:0%
a couple things I do want to comment on
 
02:31:11.570 --> 02:31:11.580 align:start position:0%
uh that were also said earlier Professor
 
02:31:13.790 --> 02:31:13.800 align:start position:0%
Sher was one of my law professors
 
02:31:15.830 --> 02:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
he's not just a law professor he's a
 
02:31:18.410 --> 02:31:18.420 align:start position:0%
great law professor and there are
 
02:31:19.550 --> 02:31:19.560 align:start position:0%
several things he said that I actually
 
02:31:21.290 --> 02:31:21.300 align:start position:0%
agree with
 
02:31:21.300 --> 02:31:22.550 align:start position:0%
agree with
um

02:31:22.550 --> 02:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:25.309 --> 02:31:25.319 align:start position:0%
but I do have to say even he
 
02:31:27.429 --> 02:31:27.439 align:start position:0%
acknowledged the system in New Hampshire
 
02:31:31.250 --> 02:31:31.260 align:start position:0%
is not well defined it's more of a back
 
02:31:32.929 --> 02:31:32.939 align:start position:0%
end system than a forward end system
 
02:31:35.150 --> 02:31:35.160 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the engagement and
 
02:31:37.190 --> 02:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
making these decisions about whether or
 
02:31:41.389 --> 02:31:41.399 align:start position:0%
not somebody should be out on bail
 
02:31:41.399 --> 02:31:41.990 align:start position:0%
not somebody should be out on bail
um

02:31:41.990 --> 02:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:44.150 --> 02:31:44.160 align:start position:0%
he also talked about the data and I know
 
02:31:46.370 --> 02:31:46.380 align:start position:0%
many of you had questions about the data
 
02:31:46.380 --> 02:31:46.969 align:start position:0%
many of you had questions about the data
um

02:31:46.969 --> 02:31:46.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:49.790 --> 02:31:49.800 align:start position:0%
is his data is limited in scope the
 
02:31:52.370 --> 02:31:52.380 align:start position:0%
scope of data that's available but it's
 
02:31:54.349 --> 02:31:54.359 align:start position:0%
not a complete set of data upon which we
 
02:31:56.630 --> 02:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
can make decisions and I think that's
 
02:31:58.309 --> 02:31:58.319 align:start position:0%
something that we can all agree on as
 
02:32:01.610 --> 02:32:01.620 align:start position:0%
well so this bill a little different
 
02:32:04.070 --> 02:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
than the previous bill this bill
 
02:32:07.309 --> 02:32:07.319 align:start position:0%
attempts to upon arrest
 
02:32:10.190 --> 02:32:10.200 align:start position:0%
identify certain crimes for which
 
02:32:14.170 --> 02:32:14.180 align:start position:0%
someone should be held pending
 
02:32:17.510 --> 02:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
appearance before a judge
 
02:32:20.090 --> 02:32:20.100 align:start position:0%
so instead of going before a bail
 
02:32:23.510 --> 02:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner or and you can see on page
 
02:32:26.990 --> 02:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
one beginning on line 24 for the crimes
 
02:32:28.610 --> 02:32:28.620 align:start position:0%
that we've delineated
 
02:32:32.150 --> 02:32:32.160 align:start position:0%
the individual would be held pending the
 
02:32:34.550 --> 02:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
appearance before a judge now you may
 
02:32:36.950 --> 02:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
hear that this is going to leave someone
 
02:32:39.650 --> 02:32:39.660 align:start position:0%
incarcerated for days and days well I
 
02:32:42.770 --> 02:32:42.780 align:start position:0%
would argue that there I can't argue
 
02:32:44.630 --> 02:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
that there won't be one or two or a
 
02:32:46.490 --> 02:32:46.500 align:start position:0%
couple of instances where
 
02:32:48.349 --> 02:32:48.359 align:start position:0%
because a crime is committed on a Friday
 
02:32:48.359 --> 02:32:49.190 align:start position:0%
because a crime is committed on a Friday
night

02:32:49.190 --> 02:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
night
 
02:32:51.410 --> 02:32:51.420 align:start position:0%
and because weekend days are excluded
 
02:32:53.690 --> 02:32:53.700 align:start position:0%
because the court isn't open someone may
 
02:32:55.370 --> 02:32:55.380 align:start position:0%
have to wait
 
02:32:59.030 --> 02:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
but what I will tell you is that given
 
02:33:00.469 --> 02:33:00.479 align:start position:0%
the volume
 
02:33:04.190 --> 02:33:04.200 align:start position:0%
of some of these potential cases given
 
02:33:07.570 --> 02:33:07.580 align:start position:0%
the potential for a magistrate system
 
02:33:10.730 --> 02:33:10.740 align:start position:0%
given other things that this good
 
02:33:12.590 --> 02:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
committee is working on
 
02:33:14.570 --> 02:33:14.580 align:start position:0%
um I think this makes sense for the
 
02:33:17.710 --> 02:33:17.720 align:start position:0%
times that we're in I know you're being
 
02:33:20.929 --> 02:33:20.939 align:start position:0%
given a lot of different options as to
 
02:33:24.170 --> 02:33:24.180 align:start position:0%
how we might rework the statute
 
02:33:26.270 --> 02:33:26.280 align:start position:0%
but I think that also speaks to the fact
 
02:33:29.929 --> 02:33:29.939 align:start position:0%
that maybe we do need to look back at
 
02:33:32.630 --> 02:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
what we did five years ago and fine tune
 
02:33:35.690 --> 02:33:35.700 align:start position:0%
it not throw it out but fine tune it and
 
02:33:38.450 --> 02:33:38.460 align:start position:0%
I think this bill is a very discreet way
 
02:33:41.090 --> 02:33:41.100 align:start position:0%
that we can do that
 
02:33:44.990 --> 02:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
I also want to speak to you uh about the
 
02:33:48.650 --> 02:33:48.660 align:start position:0%
issue of or the term anecdotes because
 
02:33:51.110 --> 02:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
you are going to hear semantes you are
 
02:33:52.790 --> 02:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
going to hear some stories of where
 
02:33:52.800 --> 02:33:54.650 align:start position:0%
going to hear some stories of where
someone

02:33:54.650 --> 02:33:54.660 align:start position:0%
someone
 
02:33:58.130 --> 02:33:58.140 align:start position:0%
fell victim to a crime then someone was
 
02:34:01.610 --> 02:34:01.620 align:start position:0%
apprehended for that crime and some very
 
02:34:05.330 --> 02:34:05.340 align:start position:0%
dire things occurred as a result of it
 
02:34:05.340 --> 02:34:06.170 align:start position:0%
dire things occurred as a result of it
um

02:34:06.170 --> 02:34:06.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:07.969 --> 02:34:07.979 align:start position:0%
I think there are people
 
02:34:11.210 --> 02:34:11.220 align:start position:0%
on on both sides I think there are
 
02:34:13.849 --> 02:34:13.859 align:start position:0%
victims I also think that we have to be
 
02:34:16.790 --> 02:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
Mindful and respectful in creating a
 
02:34:18.710 --> 02:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
process that recognizes that someone
 
02:34:20.510 --> 02:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
who's been arrested
 
02:34:22.610 --> 02:34:22.620 align:start position:0%
is innocent until proven guilty that is
 
02:34:24.010 --> 02:34:24.020 align:start position:0%
our system
 
02:34:27.410 --> 02:34:27.420 align:start position:0%
but we also have to keep Public Safety
 
02:34:30.590 --> 02:34:30.600 align:start position:0%
in the Forefront of this discussion as
 
02:34:33.530 --> 02:34:33.540 align:start position:0%
well you know in the Senate chamber that
 
02:34:36.230 --> 02:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
room was used for the Supreme Court at
 
02:34:37.070 --> 02:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
one time
 
02:34:39.230 --> 02:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
and as a result if you look between the
 
02:34:41.450 --> 02:34:41.460 align:start position:0%
windows on the top there are scales of
 
02:34:41.460 --> 02:34:42.410 align:start position:0%
windows on the top there are scales of
Justice

02:34:42.410 --> 02:34:42.420 align:start position:0%
Justice
 
02:34:44.510 --> 02:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
and those skills
 
02:34:46.849 --> 02:34:46.859 align:start position:0%
are about balance are about weighting
 
02:34:50.090 --> 02:34:50.100 align:start position:0%
the factors and how we as legislators
 
02:34:52.790 --> 02:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
are going to craft laws that weigh those
 
02:34:55.490 --> 02:34:55.500 align:start position:0%
important factors of Justice
 
02:34:57.950 --> 02:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
and I just want to say that I think the
 
02:34:59.290 --> 02:34:59.300 align:start position:0%
current process
 
02:35:02.450 --> 02:35:02.460 align:start position:0%
has left some people
 
02:35:02.460 --> 02:35:03.290 align:start position:0%
has left some people
um

02:35:03.290 --> 02:35:03.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:05.990 --> 02:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
out in the cold so to speak particularly
 
02:35:10.010 --> 02:35:10.020 align:start position:0%
with respect to victims I've spent
 
02:35:12.770 --> 02:35:12.780 align:start position:0%
a lot of my time as a legislator working
 
02:35:14.450 --> 02:35:14.460 align:start position:0%
on issues particularly surrounding
 
02:35:16.969 --> 02:35:16.979 align:start position:0%
domestic violence I sponsor the domestic
 
02:35:19.070 --> 02:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
violence law that created
 
02:35:20.809 --> 02:35:20.819 align:start position:0%
it was called Joshua's Law that created
 
02:35:23.150 --> 02:35:23.160 align:start position:0%
the crime of domestic violence and I
 
02:35:24.770 --> 02:35:24.780 align:start position:0%
know for a fact although the chair
 
02:35:27.230 --> 02:35:27.240 align:start position:0%
beside me is empty if I could have
 
02:35:29.870 --> 02:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
actually brought someone with me whose
 
02:35:32.870 --> 02:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
story I've heard I know that they would
 
02:35:35.270 --> 02:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
have told you that there are crimes
 
02:35:39.410 --> 02:35:39.420 align:start position:0%
today that are going unreported
 
02:35:42.710 --> 02:35:42.720 align:start position:0%
because of fear that somebody
 
02:35:45.290 --> 02:35:45.300 align:start position:0%
the alleged perpetrator could be
 
02:35:45.300 --> 02:35:46.849 align:start position:0%
the alleged perpetrator could be
released

02:35:46.849 --> 02:35:46.859 align:start position:0%
released
 
02:35:49.849 --> 02:35:49.859 align:start position:0%
in a situation of domestic violence in
 
02:35:52.130 --> 02:35:52.140 align:start position:0%
particular that's critical if somebody
 
02:35:56.870 --> 02:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
is afraid that if they report a crime if
 
02:35:59.570 --> 02:35:59.580 align:start position:0%
the person living in their home remember
 
02:36:01.010 --> 02:36:01.020 align:start position:0%
somebody who shares a relationship
 
02:36:03.830 --> 02:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
likely living in their home is going to
 
02:36:05.750 --> 02:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
be released immediately
 
02:36:07.910 --> 02:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
they fail to report that crime I think
 
02:36:07.920 --> 02:36:08.990 align:start position:0%
they fail to report that crime I think
that's

02:36:08.990 --> 02:36:09.000 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:36:11.210 --> 02:36:11.220 align:start position:0%
that sort of weighing the scales in a
 
02:36:13.550 --> 02:36:13.560 align:start position:0%
way that that really does give me pause
 
02:36:16.730 --> 02:36:16.740 align:start position:0%
and that really does concern me I think
 
02:36:19.250 --> 02:36:19.260 align:start position:0%
on a lot in a lot of our
 
02:36:21.590 --> 02:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
cities and towns and as I said you'll
 
02:36:24.230 --> 02:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
hear some anecdotal information but
 
02:36:26.210 --> 02:36:26.220 align:start position:0%
remember each anecdote includes a victim
 
02:36:29.270 --> 02:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
and every alleged crime whether a person
 
02:36:31.790 --> 02:36:31.800 align:start position:0%
is convicted or not still
 
02:36:35.270 --> 02:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh includes a victim of that crime
 
02:36:38.090 --> 02:36:38.100 align:start position:0%
um I think the word has gotten out that
 
02:36:41.630 --> 02:36:41.640 align:start position:0%
our system is just tilted a little more
 
02:36:44.330 --> 02:36:44.340 align:start position:0%
in the wrong direction for some of the
 
02:36:46.010 --> 02:36:46.020 align:start position:0%
people in our state
 
02:36:49.190 --> 02:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
and although I received great training
 
02:36:52.250 --> 02:36:52.260 align:start position:0%
as a lawyer and I do practice labor and
 
02:36:54.650 --> 02:36:54.660 align:start position:0%
employment law I'm here before you as a
 
02:36:57.290 --> 02:36:57.300 align:start position:0%
state senator who's heard many real
 
02:37:01.250 --> 02:37:01.260 align:start position:0%
stories from my constituents about the
 
02:37:03.230 --> 02:37:03.240 align:start position:0%
impact of the law we passed five years
 
02:37:06.410 --> 02:37:06.420 align:start position:0%
ago and about the need to make some very
 
02:37:10.550 --> 02:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
discrete changes to it to ensure that we
 
02:37:13.730 --> 02:37:13.740 align:start position:0%
are treating victims and perpetrators
 
02:37:17.030 --> 02:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
fairly and that we are ensuring the
 
02:37:18.770 --> 02:37:18.780 align:start position:0%
safety of the public of the State of New
 
02:37:21.050 --> 02:37:21.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so with that I will conclude
 
02:37:23.330 --> 02:37:23.340 align:start position:0%
my testimony I'm happy to take any
 
02:37:26.210 --> 02:37:26.220 align:start position:0%
questions as I say I know that the chief
 
02:37:27.950 --> 02:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
from Manchester is here can certainly
 
02:37:29.929 --> 02:37:29.939 align:start position:0%
speak to some specific incidents about
 
02:37:29.939 --> 02:37:31.030 align:start position:0%
speak to some specific incidents about
this

02:37:31.030 --> 02:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:37:35.450 --> 02:37:35.460 align:start position:0%
this particular Bill the impact uh that
 
02:37:38.030 --> 02:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
the initial bail reform has had and how
 
02:37:40.130 --> 02:37:40.140 align:start position:0%
this bill might help with that problem
 
02:37:42.410 --> 02:37:42.420 align:start position:0%
so thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
02:37:42.420 --> 02:37:45.830 align:start position:0%
so thank you Mr chairman members of the
committee

02:37:45.830 --> 02:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:47.690 --> 02:37:47.700 align:start position:0%
say no questions thank you for your
 
02:37:49.429 --> 02:37:49.439 align:start position:0%
testimony I'm sorry representative I
 
02:37:51.230 --> 02:37:51.240 align:start position:0%
just like that I just wanted to see if
 
02:37:53.510 --> 02:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
anybody else had a question uh Mr chair
 
02:37:56.270 --> 02:37:56.280 align:start position:0%
I have a brief comment and a question
 
02:37:58.550 --> 02:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
for Senator Susie since my only chance
 
02:38:02.150 --> 02:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
to see you uh we I pay attention bell
 
02:38:04.969 --> 02:38:04.979 align:start position:0%
commissioner yes in Rockingham County I
 
02:38:06.770 --> 02:38:06.780 align:start position:0%
want you to know based on what you
 
02:38:09.530 --> 02:38:09.540 align:start position:0%
started your testimony with that the
 
02:38:13.070 --> 02:38:13.080 align:start position:0%
veil reform originated with not keeping
 
02:38:16.790 --> 02:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
people in jail only because of poverty
 
02:38:19.969 --> 02:38:19.979 align:start position:0%
uh we just don't do that and I talk to
 
02:38:21.710 --> 02:38:21.720 align:start position:0%
the people in Rockingham County we don't
 
02:38:23.570 --> 02:38:23.580 align:start position:0%
do that and nobody's ever mentioned
 
02:38:25.490 --> 02:38:25.500 align:start position:0%
Rockingham counties always Cheshire or
 
02:38:27.710 --> 02:38:27.720 align:start position:0%
Sullivan but never rocking him we don't
 
02:38:30.650 --> 02:38:30.660 align:start position:0%
do that that's my comment which is thank
 
02:38:32.510 --> 02:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
you for listening my question is how did
 
02:38:35.389 --> 02:38:35.399 align:start position:0%
you come up with this list
 
02:38:38.090 --> 02:38:38.100 align:start position:0%
um this list actually was worked on
 
02:38:40.370 --> 02:38:40.380 align:start position:0%
um over a couple of years
 
02:38:43.130 --> 02:38:43.140 align:start position:0%
um this list appeared in legislation
 
02:38:43.140 --> 02:38:44.929 align:start position:0%
um this list appeared in legislation
that

02:38:44.929 --> 02:38:44.939 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:38:46.969 --> 02:38:46.979 align:start position:0%
um passed the Senate before I should
 
02:38:48.830 --> 02:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
note this bill passed the Senate on a
 
02:38:52.010 --> 02:38:52.020 align:start position:0%
21-3 vote but the list was a bipartisan
 
02:38:54.170 --> 02:38:54.180 align:start position:0%
collaboration Senator Bradley had
 
02:38:56.990 --> 02:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
similar legislation previously I picked
 
02:38:59.570 --> 02:38:59.580 align:start position:0%
up on this legislation and we were
 
02:39:02.389 --> 02:39:02.399 align:start position:0%
attempting to determine some of the most
 
02:39:04.849 --> 02:39:04.859 align:start position:0%
serious offenses for which there should
 
02:39:09.230 --> 02:39:09.240 align:start position:0%
at least be a pause and careful
 
02:39:11.570 --> 02:39:11.580 align:start position:0%
consideration about someone being
 
02:39:13.250 --> 02:39:13.260 align:start position:0%
released on bail
 
02:39:16.910 --> 02:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:20.630 --> 02:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator thank you very much
 
02:39:37.429 --> 02:39:37.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:38.990 --> 02:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
02:39:40.730 --> 02:39:40.740 align:start position:0%
committee uh my name is Senator Daryl
 
02:39:44.570 --> 02:39:44.580 align:start position:0%
Abbas I represent District 22.
 
02:39:46.010 --> 02:39:46.020 align:start position:0%
it's communities of Pelham Salem
 
02:39:47.330 --> 02:39:47.340 align:start position:0%
Atkinson and
 
02:39:47.340 --> 02:39:49.250 align:start position:0%
Atkinson and
plasto

02:39:49.250 --> 02:39:49.260 align:start position:0%
plasto
 
02:39:50.630 --> 02:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
that's a joke between me and one of the
 
02:39:50.640 --> 02:39:51.950 align:start position:0%
that's a joke between me and one of the
representatives

02:39:51.950 --> 02:39:51.960 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
02:39:54.230 --> 02:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
I'm testifying in support of Senate Bill
 
02:39:54.240 --> 02:39:55.610 align:start position:0%
I'm testifying in support of Senate Bill
252

02:39:55.610 --> 02:39:55.620 align:start position:0%
252
 
02:39:57.889 --> 02:39:57.899 align:start position:0%
and I just want to point out we had a
 
02:40:00.650 --> 02:40:00.660 align:start position:0%
hearing on 249 and they're very
 
02:40:02.870 --> 02:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
different policies and if you look at
 
02:40:05.090 --> 02:40:05.100 align:start position:0%
the vote in the Senate they were
 
02:40:07.070 --> 02:40:07.080 align:start position:0%
different numbers so they're independent
 
02:40:08.450 --> 02:40:08.460 align:start position:0%
of each other and I just asked to give
 
02:40:10.070 --> 02:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
each one Fair consideration because this
 
02:40:13.790 --> 02:40:13.800 align:start position:0%
policy I feel deals more with a specific
 
02:40:16.670 --> 02:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
narrow issue there's a list of offenses
 
02:40:19.849 --> 02:40:19.859 align:start position:0%
and those 12 offenses what they all have
 
02:40:21.170 --> 02:40:21.180 align:start position:0%
in common
 
02:40:23.929 --> 02:40:23.939 align:start position:0%
there's two there's two major things one
 
02:40:26.750 --> 02:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
they're a violent crime where the victim
 
02:40:28.849 --> 02:40:28.859 align:start position:0%
is a person so we're not talking about
 
02:40:31.969 --> 02:40:31.979 align:start position:0%
property damage even breaking entering
 
02:40:34.790 --> 02:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a crime with the
 
02:40:36.230 --> 02:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
victim is a person and it's a violent
 
02:40:38.210 --> 02:40:38.220 align:start position:0%
offense we have domestic violence
 
02:40:40.429 --> 02:40:40.439 align:start position:0%
stalking those type of those type of
 
02:40:43.070 --> 02:40:43.080 align:start position:0%
charges or it involves a sex crime
 
02:40:44.690 --> 02:40:44.700 align:start position:0%
involving a child
 
02:40:47.030 --> 02:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
that's the other type of offenses
 
02:40:50.090 --> 02:40:50.100 align:start position:0%
for those 12 offenses if someone is
 
02:40:51.710 --> 02:40:51.720 align:start position:0%
charged with any of those
 
02:40:54.469 --> 02:40:54.479 align:start position:0%
the only change in policy is they'll
 
02:40:56.450 --> 02:40:56.460 align:start position:0%
still have a hearing where they can be
 
02:40:56.460 --> 02:40:57.770 align:start position:0%
still have a hearing where they can be
held

02:40:57.770 --> 02:40:57.780 align:start position:0%
held
 
02:40:59.450 --> 02:40:59.460 align:start position:0%
they can assess the dangerousness of
 
02:41:00.770 --> 02:41:00.780 align:start position:0%
that person
 
02:41:02.389 --> 02:41:02.399 align:start position:0%
but they're going before a judge they
 
02:41:05.030 --> 02:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
will not be released through a bail
 
02:41:06.830 --> 02:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner that is not we're not
 
02:41:08.389 --> 02:41:08.399 align:start position:0%
targeting bail Commissioners we're not
 
02:41:10.130 --> 02:41:10.140 align:start position:0%
saying that the law is not being applied
 
02:41:10.140 --> 02:41:11.510 align:start position:0%
saying that the law is not being applied
correctly

02:41:11.510 --> 02:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
02:41:13.610 --> 02:41:13.620 align:start position:0%
but we're looking at some of the more
 
02:41:16.190 --> 02:41:16.200 align:start position:0%
egregious unintended consequences of
 
02:41:18.770 --> 02:41:18.780 align:start position:0%
bail reform and trying to address those
 
02:41:21.290 --> 02:41:21.300 align:start position:0%
without repealing the whole thing or
 
02:41:24.110 --> 02:41:24.120 align:start position:0%
reverting back to the prior system
 
02:41:26.750 --> 02:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
so this language may seem similar to the
 
02:41:27.710 --> 02:41:27.720 align:start position:0%
members that are on the committee last
 
02:41:30.710 --> 02:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
term we've we've had a this policy
 
02:41:32.929 --> 02:41:32.939 align:start position:0%
before us one difference is that we
 
02:41:34.790 --> 02:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
separated the bill into several
 
02:41:36.469 --> 02:41:36.479 align:start position:0%
several bills and the reason for doing
 
02:41:38.750 --> 02:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
that is that's if you perhaps if you're
 
02:41:40.969 --> 02:41:40.979 align:start position:0%
not in support of one policy you can
 
02:41:42.290 --> 02:41:42.300 align:start position:0%
still support the other rather than have
 
02:41:44.929 --> 02:41:44.939 align:start position:0%
one big Bill and that was the strategy
 
02:41:47.450 --> 02:41:47.460 align:start position:0%
that I thought maybe better suited to
 
02:41:50.210 --> 02:41:50.220 align:start position:0%
perhaps address some of the problems
 
02:41:52.730 --> 02:41:52.740 align:start position:0%
there is a glaring hole in the procedure
 
02:41:55.070 --> 02:41:55.080 align:start position:0%
and in the law because yes the state
 
02:41:57.849 --> 02:41:57.859 align:start position:0%
does have the opportunity to challenge
 
02:42:00.170 --> 02:42:00.180 align:start position:0%
that person's release if they are
 
02:42:02.270 --> 02:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
released by a bail commissioner and can
 
02:42:03.710 --> 02:42:03.720 align:start position:0%
request a hearing
 
02:42:05.870 --> 02:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
if if the state believes the person is
 
02:42:08.750 --> 02:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
dangerous however if that person has
 
02:42:10.190 --> 02:42:10.200 align:start position:0%
already been released by a bail
 
02:42:10.200 --> 02:42:11.750 align:start position:0%
already been released by a bail
commissioner

02:42:11.750 --> 02:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
02:42:13.790 --> 02:42:13.800 align:start position:0%
in in theory the court could still hold
 
02:42:15.590 --> 02:42:15.600 align:start position:0%
the person after the dangerousness
 
02:42:18.469 --> 02:42:18.479 align:start position:0%
hearing but that dangerous person has
 
02:42:21.710 --> 02:42:21.720 align:start position:0%
been released into the public for uh 48
 
02:42:24.230 --> 02:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
hours so that's the hole in the
 
02:42:26.389 --> 02:42:26.399 align:start position:0%
procedure if the state wants to ask for
 
02:42:27.530 --> 02:42:27.540 align:start position:0%
that hearing
 
02:42:29.150 --> 02:42:29.160 align:start position:0%
it seems that it should be asked before
 
02:42:31.010 --> 02:42:31.020 align:start position:0%
the person is released and they don't
 
02:42:33.590 --> 02:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
even have the opportunity to do that
 
02:42:35.990 --> 02:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
because the person that practices a
 
02:42:37.670 --> 02:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
person will waive their arraignment if
 
02:42:39.650 --> 02:42:39.660 align:start position:0%
they're given if they're awarded bail by
 
02:42:41.030 --> 02:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
the bail commissioner
 
02:42:41.040 --> 02:42:42.590 align:start position:0%
the bail commissioner
so

02:42:42.590 --> 02:42:42.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:42:44.630 --> 02:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
I think we're dealing with specific
 
02:42:48.110 --> 02:42:48.120 align:start position:0%
public safety concerns and and just an
 
02:42:49.730 --> 02:42:49.740 align:start position:0%
example of some of the
 
02:42:51.650 --> 02:42:51.660 align:start position:0%
when I see egregious unintended
 
02:42:53.690 --> 02:42:53.700 align:start position:0%
consequences there was a person who was
 
02:42:55.730 --> 02:42:55.740 align:start position:0%
arrested for domestic violence
 
02:42:58.550 --> 02:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
they were released within a short time
 
02:43:02.770 --> 02:43:02.780 align:start position:0%
within two hours that same night
 
02:43:05.210 --> 02:43:05.220 align:start position:0%
went to that person's house
 
02:43:06.950 --> 02:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
broke into their house and then
 
02:43:09.110 --> 02:43:09.120 align:start position:0%
committed a felony level sexual assault
 
02:43:11.630 --> 02:43:11.640 align:start position:0%
on that person
 
02:43:14.990 --> 02:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
same victim within 24 hours
 
02:43:16.730 --> 02:43:16.740 align:start position:0%
it's in domestic violence is type
 
02:43:18.650 --> 02:43:18.660 align:start position:0%
offense that tends to elevate and that's
 
02:43:20.389 --> 02:43:20.399 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of Statistics showing
 
02:43:22.429 --> 02:43:22.439 align:start position:0%
that it may start as a misdemeanor
 
02:43:24.530 --> 02:43:24.540 align:start position:0%
offense and elevates and that's a one of
 
02:43:26.809 --> 02:43:26.819 align:start position:0%
the most obvious examples of seeing that
 
02:43:26.819 --> 02:43:27.889 align:start position:0%
the most obvious examples of seeing that
but

02:43:27.889 --> 02:43:27.899 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:43:30.349 --> 02:43:30.359 align:start position:0%
that person was given bail without even
 
02:43:32.750 --> 02:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
appearing before a judge all were saying
 
02:43:35.570 --> 02:43:35.580 align:start position:0%
is this person will be brought before a
 
02:43:38.510 --> 02:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
judge I understand that there's an
 
02:43:41.389 --> 02:43:41.399 align:start position:0%
initiative to perhaps convert to a
 
02:43:42.889 --> 02:43:42.899 align:start position:0%
magistrate system
 
02:43:44.929 --> 02:43:44.939 align:start position:0%
I believe this is a safeguard to take
 
02:43:47.389 --> 02:43:47.399 align:start position:0%
into consideration until that system is
 
02:43:48.950 --> 02:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
put into place because as you can see
 
02:43:50.570 --> 02:43:50.580 align:start position:0%
the Baylor procedure is very complicated
 
02:43:53.389 --> 02:43:53.399 align:start position:0%
it's a long chapter and there's a lot of
 
02:43:55.190 --> 02:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
procedural steps that can be taken
 
02:43:57.349 --> 02:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
whether it's a magistrate or remain in
 
02:43:59.210 --> 02:43:59.220 align:start position:0%
the current system we have now
 
02:44:01.610 --> 02:44:01.620 align:start position:0%
but in the meantime we have glaring
 
02:44:03.170 --> 02:44:03.180 align:start position:0%
public safety concerns that need to be
 
02:44:04.730 --> 02:44:04.740 align:start position:0%
addressed this a deal this deals with
 
02:44:07.610 --> 02:44:07.620 align:start position:0%
that in the short term while we perhaps
 
02:44:09.349 --> 02:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
work together to put together a
 
02:44:10.610 --> 02:44:10.620 align:start position:0%
magistrate system
 
02:44:13.070 --> 02:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
uh I can't stress this enough
 
02:44:14.690 --> 02:44:14.700 align:start position:0%
Public Safety when you're talking about
 
02:44:16.429 --> 02:44:16.439 align:start position:0%
violent crimes with the victims of
 
02:44:18.950 --> 02:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
people and crimes of violent crimes or
 
02:44:20.389 --> 02:44:20.399 align:start position:0%
sex crimes against children those are
 
02:44:22.429 --> 02:44:22.439 align:start position:0%
those are as egregious and as bad as
 
02:44:24.710 --> 02:44:24.720 align:start position:0%
worse of an offense as a person can
 
02:44:26.990 --> 02:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
commit these are the most dangerous of
 
02:44:29.750 --> 02:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
the most dangerous and I feel that if
 
02:44:31.490 --> 02:44:31.500 align:start position:0%
that person is going to be granted bail
 
02:44:34.130 --> 02:44:34.140 align:start position:0%
or be released it should go before a
 
02:44:36.170 --> 02:44:36.180 align:start position:0%
judge and the state should have the
 
02:44:38.510 --> 02:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to seek the remedy or seek
 
02:44:40.309 --> 02:44:40.319 align:start position:0%
the bail that they see fit but keep in
 
02:44:40.319 --> 02:44:41.570 align:start position:0%
the bail that they see fit but keep in
mind

02:44:41.570 --> 02:44:41.580 align:start position:0%
mind
 
02:44:44.030 --> 02:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
the state does not is not required to
 
02:44:48.170 --> 02:44:48.180 align:start position:0%
actually ask that the person be held
 
02:44:50.510 --> 02:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
they can waive that they so it's not
 
02:44:53.150 --> 02:44:53.160 align:start position:0%
mandating that anyone be held on bail
 
02:44:54.590 --> 02:44:54.600 align:start position:0%
the state would still have to meet their
 
02:44:56.210 --> 02:44:56.220 align:start position:0%
burden of proof there's two different
 
02:44:58.429 --> 02:44:58.439 align:start position:0%
processes we may come across if a person
 
02:45:01.309 --> 02:45:01.319 align:start position:0%
is in is indicted for an offense
 
02:45:03.590 --> 02:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
uh the comment the common practice of
 
02:45:05.450 --> 02:45:05.460 align:start position:0%
that it could be the result of a longer
 
02:45:07.550 --> 02:45:07.560 align:start position:0%
investigation that went into that
 
02:45:10.550 --> 02:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
and I can imagine that the prosecutor
 
02:45:11.750 --> 02:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
will be in a better position to meet
 
02:45:13.550 --> 02:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
their burden but someone who's arrested
 
02:45:16.070 --> 02:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
on a Thursday and then there first thing
 
02:45:17.929 --> 02:45:17.939 align:start position:0%
in the morning that prosecutor better
 
02:45:19.250 --> 02:45:19.260 align:start position:0%
have their information together they're
 
02:45:20.330 --> 02:45:20.340 align:start position:0%
gonna have a tough time meeting that
 
02:45:22.670 --> 02:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
burden that's that would fall on on the
 
02:45:25.190 --> 02:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
prosecutor for not being prepared for
 
02:45:26.630 --> 02:45:26.640 align:start position:0%
the hearing but at least they have the
 
02:45:26.640 --> 02:45:27.590 align:start position:0%
the hearing but at least they have the
option

02:45:27.590 --> 02:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
option
 
02:45:30.710 --> 02:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
the discretion to ask for it rather than
 
02:45:32.450 --> 02:45:32.460 align:start position:0%
the person be released and we take our
 
02:45:34.610 --> 02:45:34.620 align:start position:0%
chances and see what happens I think
 
02:45:36.230 --> 02:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
given the level of offense is this is
 
02:45:38.389 --> 02:45:38.399 align:start position:0%
not an egregious policy I hope the
 
02:45:40.010 --> 02:45:40.020 align:start position:0%
committee would support not to pass I'll
 
02:45:42.950 --> 02:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:44.929 --> 02:45:44.939 align:start position:0%
Representative no
 
02:45:46.370 --> 02:45:46.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:45:48.889 --> 02:45:48.899 align:start position:0%
taking my question Senator Abbas so in
 
02:45:51.290 --> 02:45:51.300 align:start position:0%
the last bit in the last hearing what we
 
02:45:53.990 --> 02:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
had heard from Professor share was that
 
02:45:57.230 --> 02:45:57.240 align:start position:0%
that one would be unconstitutional and
 
02:45:59.030 --> 02:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
what I wrote down and I may be lacking a
 
02:46:00.710 --> 02:46:00.720 align:start position:0%
little bit I didn't get the support the
 
02:46:03.290 --> 02:46:03.300 align:start position:0%
the case written down just in time but
 
02:46:05.270 --> 02:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
it it there must be a hearing
 
02:46:08.389 --> 02:46:08.399 align:start position:0%
representation must be provided and the
 
02:46:10.309 --> 02:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
burden is on the state to demonstrate
 
02:46:11.630 --> 02:46:11.640 align:start position:0%
that the person is a danger to the
 
02:46:12.950 --> 02:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
public and so when I'm reading this the
 
02:46:14.330 --> 02:46:14.340 align:start position:0%
court shall order that the person be
 
02:46:16.130 --> 02:46:16.140 align:start position:0%
detained pending trial of course it
 
02:46:17.830 --> 02:46:17.840 align:start position:0%
talks about how there will be a hearing
 
02:46:20.030 --> 02:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
pending trial if the court determines by
 
02:46:21.889 --> 02:46:21.899 align:start position:0%
clear and convincing evidence which I'm
 
02:46:23.389 --> 02:46:23.399 align:start position:0%
pretty sure that's what he was saying
 
02:46:25.490 --> 02:46:25.500 align:start position:0%
needed to be demonstrated that would be
 
02:46:27.469 --> 02:46:27.479 align:start position:0%
putting the burden on the court that the
 
02:46:29.630 --> 02:46:29.640 align:start position:0%
person release of a person is the danger
 
02:46:31.010 --> 02:46:31.020 align:start position:0%
to the public or themselves so I just
 
02:46:33.110 --> 02:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify essentially what this
 
02:46:35.270 --> 02:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
does is this removes
 
02:46:38.450 --> 02:46:38.460 align:start position:0%
um what was what was a barrier in the
 
02:46:40.429 --> 02:46:40.439 align:start position:0%
last one this one satisfies those
 
02:46:44.030 --> 02:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
constitutional necessities
 
02:46:45.530 --> 02:46:45.540 align:start position:0%
in respect of the Constitutional
 
02:46:47.690 --> 02:46:47.700 align:start position:0%
question and let's leave it that this is
 
02:46:50.270 --> 02:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
my opinion alone
 
02:46:54.410 --> 02:46:54.420 align:start position:0%
so in that in 249 the when we had that
 
02:46:56.030 --> 02:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
policy last term there was discussion
 
02:46:58.250 --> 02:46:58.260 align:start position:0%
and in consultation with
 
02:46:59.750 --> 02:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office other
 
02:47:02.210 --> 02:47:02.220 align:start position:0%
people in the legal community
 
02:47:04.429 --> 02:47:04.439 align:start position:0%
was if that said clear and convincing
 
02:47:06.050 --> 02:47:06.060 align:start position:0%
evidence all you're trying to in that
 
02:47:07.550 --> 02:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
scenario all you're doing is trying to
 
02:47:09.230 --> 02:47:09.240 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that state is demonstrating
 
02:47:10.730 --> 02:47:10.740 align:start position:0%
you've been arrested so whether that
 
02:47:13.070 --> 02:47:13.080 align:start position:0%
says probable cause clear and convincing
 
02:47:15.110 --> 02:47:15.120 align:start position:0%
evidence or Beyond A Reasonable Doubt
 
02:47:17.510 --> 02:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is to demonstrate the
 
02:47:18.950 --> 02:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
person's been arrested two times
 
02:47:21.469 --> 02:47:21.479 align:start position:0%
thereafter after the first offense being
 
02:47:23.210 --> 02:47:23.220 align:start position:0%
released on bail
 
02:47:25.070 --> 02:47:25.080 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about anything more
 
02:47:26.570 --> 02:47:26.580 align:start position:0%
than their criminal record or perhaps
 
02:47:28.070 --> 02:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
the arrest report
 
02:47:31.010 --> 02:47:31.020 align:start position:0%
so the reason why it says probable cause
 
02:47:33.590 --> 02:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
is that that's the arrest standard if we
 
02:47:34.910 --> 02:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
change that to clear and convincing
 
02:47:37.130 --> 02:47:37.140 align:start position:0%
evidence the court would be required to
 
02:47:39.530 --> 02:47:39.540 align:start position:0%
make two separate written findings and
 
02:47:42.290 --> 02:47:42.300 align:start position:0%
that would one be I don't believe is a
 
02:47:44.210 --> 02:47:44.220 align:start position:0%
good use of resources
 
02:47:46.190 --> 02:47:46.200 align:start position:0%
because regardless of the burden it's
 
02:47:47.270 --> 02:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
you're demonstrating have they been
 
02:47:49.010 --> 02:47:49.020 align:start position:0%
arrested for more than one offense and
 
02:47:50.809 --> 02:47:50.819 align:start position:0%
if you ask the person if the person
 
02:47:53.530 --> 02:47:53.540 align:start position:0%
wishes to testify
 
02:47:56.150 --> 02:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
they can they may state that they may
 
02:47:58.309 --> 02:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
state that for the sake of yes I've been
 
02:47:59.750 --> 02:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
arrested here's my charges they're open
 
02:48:01.670 --> 02:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
charges it's public record
 
02:48:03.650 --> 02:48:03.660 align:start position:0%
with that with that being said the clear
 
02:48:05.690 --> 02:48:05.700 align:start position:0%
and convincing evidence standard
 
02:48:08.090 --> 02:48:08.100 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that that Salerno
 
02:48:09.770 --> 02:48:09.780 align:start position:0%
case the holding was limited to the
 
02:48:11.809 --> 02:48:11.819 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the current of the
 
02:48:13.730 --> 02:48:13.740 align:start position:0%
bail chapter that it was before the
 
02:48:16.010 --> 02:48:16.020 align:start position:0%
court and it's not necessarily bonding
 
02:48:18.710 --> 02:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
on that policy so this says clear and
 
02:48:20.150 --> 02:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
convincing evidence but here you can
 
02:48:22.070 --> 02:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
only have one offense and you're going
 
02:48:23.990 --> 02:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
to be held pending trial because the
 
02:48:26.330 --> 02:48:26.340 align:start position:0%
assessment is whether you pose a danger
 
02:48:28.190 --> 02:48:28.200 align:start position:0%
to the public safe to the public or to
 
02:48:30.590 --> 02:48:30.600 align:start position:0%
yourself and can also take I think
 
02:48:32.150 --> 02:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
Salerno also talked about being a Flight
 
02:48:36.050 --> 02:48:36.060 align:start position:0%
Risk where 249 the analysis is well you
 
02:48:37.730 --> 02:48:37.740 align:start position:0%
keep getting violating your conditions
 
02:48:39.590 --> 02:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
of your release now it's a that's a
 
02:48:41.750 --> 02:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
different analysis because we're saying
 
02:48:43.610 --> 02:48:43.620 align:start position:0%
we've given you bail and you didn't
 
02:48:45.170 --> 02:48:45.180 align:start position:0%
abide by the conditions on more than one
 
02:48:47.570 --> 02:48:47.580 align:start position:0%
occasion here you can have no prior
 
02:48:49.730 --> 02:48:49.740 align:start position:0%
criminal record you can have nothing
 
02:48:51.469 --> 02:48:51.479 align:start position:0%
pending for any court and now you've
 
02:48:53.690 --> 02:48:53.700 align:start position:0%
been arrested and the consideration is
 
02:48:56.510 --> 02:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
what should you be held without bail but
 
02:48:59.090 --> 02:48:59.100 align:start position:0%
whether you're held under 249 or you're
 
02:49:02.210 --> 02:49:02.220 align:start position:0%
held under 252 is still the speedy trial
 
02:49:04.730 --> 02:49:04.740 align:start position:0%
law that it's a constitutional right but
 
02:49:07.670 --> 02:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
it is defined in an RSA if you are being
 
02:49:09.349 --> 02:49:09.359 align:start position:0%
held I believe the case and I was
 
02:49:11.809 --> 02:49:11.819 align:start position:0%
actually in between my testimony I was
 
02:49:12.710 --> 02:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
actually that's what I was doing over
 
02:49:15.410 --> 02:49:15.420 align:start position:0%
there reading about that is
 
02:49:17.389 --> 02:49:17.399 align:start position:0%
if you're being held they will the court
 
02:49:19.370 --> 02:49:19.380 align:start position:0%
will expedite your case and give it
 
02:49:21.230 --> 02:49:21.240 align:start position:0%
priority over someone who's not being
 
02:49:22.670 --> 02:49:22.680 align:start position:0%
held because of that constitutional
 
02:49:24.710 --> 02:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
issue because the speedy trial analysis
 
02:49:27.590 --> 02:49:27.600 align:start position:0%
is well by not getting your speedy trial
 
02:49:29.270 --> 02:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
have you suffered any Prejudice well if
 
02:49:30.590 --> 02:49:30.600 align:start position:0%
you're being held
 
02:49:33.110 --> 02:49:33.120 align:start position:0%
or awaiting your trial I could say that
 
02:49:34.429 --> 02:49:34.439 align:start position:0%
that's pretty clear what that's a
 
02:49:36.650 --> 02:49:36.660 align:start position:0%
Prejudice if you're not being held it's
 
02:49:38.330 --> 02:49:38.340 align:start position:0%
much harder to demonstrate that you
 
02:49:43.429 --> 02:49:43.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:44.870 --> 02:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
I think
 
02:49:47.389 --> 02:49:47.399 align:start position:0%
and I you know I just want to clarify it
 
02:49:48.950 --> 02:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
so correct me if I'm wrong the the
 
02:49:51.290 --> 02:49:51.300 align:start position:0%
difference is in the uh you know the
 
02:49:53.210 --> 02:49:53.220 align:start position:0%
difference is what is the standard what
 
02:49:55.429 --> 02:49:55.439 align:start position:0%
is the Constitutional standard for when
 
02:49:56.870 --> 02:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
someone should be deprived of their
 
02:50:00.050 --> 02:50:00.060 align:start position:0%
Liberty when someone should be detained
 
02:50:02.630 --> 02:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
um and and not able to to move around
 
02:50:05.270 --> 02:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
freely or whatever so I mean that seems
 
02:50:07.130 --> 02:50:07.140 align:start position:0%
to be the difference for me so if it's
 
02:50:09.230 --> 02:50:09.240 align:start position:0%
an arrest which is simply an arrest and
 
02:50:11.750 --> 02:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
that person could be released uh after
 
02:50:14.510 --> 02:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
that that's one burden right and then
 
02:50:15.889 --> 02:50:15.899 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about here is the
 
02:50:17.929 --> 02:50:17.939 align:start position:0%
burden for whether they should be
 
02:50:20.090 --> 02:50:20.100 align:start position:0%
um detained until they have until trial
 
02:50:20.100 --> 02:50:21.230 align:start position:0%
um detained until they have until trial
right

02:50:21.230 --> 02:50:21.240 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:50:24.290 --> 02:50:24.300 align:start position:0%
yes but the one of them is is the burden
 
02:50:26.630 --> 02:50:26.640 align:start position:0%
is clear and convincing evidence but the
 
02:50:28.550 --> 02:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
states arguing are trying to demonstrate
 
02:50:31.429 --> 02:50:31.439 align:start position:0%
you pose a public safety threat to
 
02:50:31.439 --> 02:50:32.450 align:start position:0%
you pose a public safety threat to
yourself

02:50:32.450 --> 02:50:32.460 align:start position:0%
yourself
 
02:50:36.349 --> 02:50:36.359 align:start position:0%
poor to the public or in solerno it
 
02:50:38.389 --> 02:50:38.399 align:start position:0%
talks about it being a Flight Risk
 
02:50:40.070 --> 02:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the conditions of your
 
02:50:41.270 --> 02:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
release that is completely different
 
02:50:43.670 --> 02:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
because you may not pose a danger to the
 
02:50:46.130 --> 02:50:46.140 align:start position:0%
public at all but you're not abiding by
 
02:50:47.450 --> 02:50:47.460 align:start position:0%
the conditions conditions of your
 
02:50:49.910 --> 02:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
release can be several things one can be
 
02:50:51.889 --> 02:50:51.899 align:start position:0%
that you submit to random drug and
 
02:50:53.809 --> 02:50:53.819 align:start position:0%
alcohol screens uh one can be that you
 
02:50:55.130 --> 02:50:55.140 align:start position:0%
remain sober
 
02:50:57.410 --> 02:50:57.420 align:start position:0%
those that can one can be that you
 
02:50:59.090 --> 02:50:59.100 align:start position:0%
submit to a mental health evaluation and
 
02:51:00.530 --> 02:51:00.540 align:start position:0%
especially if these are agreed upon and
 
02:51:02.510 --> 02:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
if a person doesn't abide by those
 
02:51:04.790 --> 02:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
well again what is the consequence of
 
02:51:06.110 --> 02:51:06.120 align:start position:0%
not abiding by your conditions but
 
02:51:07.550 --> 02:51:07.560 align:start position:0%
that's a different analysis because
 
02:51:09.710 --> 02:51:09.720 align:start position:0%
you're not necessarily considering
 
02:51:11.630 --> 02:51:11.640 align:start position:0%
whether they're a threat to the public
 
02:51:14.150 --> 02:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
or whether they um
 
02:51:16.250 --> 02:51:16.260 align:start position:0%
or a Flight Risk it's the violations of
 
02:51:18.410 --> 02:51:18.420 align:start position:0%
the conditions
 
02:51:22.730 --> 02:51:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:22.740 --> 02:51:25.490 align:start position:0%

02:51:27.290 --> 02:51:27.300 align:start position:0%
Senator Abbas I have a couple questions
 
02:51:31.429 --> 02:51:31.439 align:start position:0%
concerning if I may concerning this list
 
02:51:33.710 --> 02:51:33.720 align:start position:0%
as I heard
 
02:51:37.670 --> 02:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
it being described it was the abuse of a
 
02:51:41.870 --> 02:51:41.880 align:start position:0%
child or the actual physical molestation
 
02:51:44.270 --> 02:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
do you see that the safety of the public
 
02:51:47.090 --> 02:51:47.100 align:start position:0%
is involved is it threatened under
 
02:51:49.250 --> 02:51:49.260 align:start position:0%
possession manufactured Distributing of
 
02:51:52.070 --> 02:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
child sexual abuse images blah blah
 
02:51:54.590 --> 02:51:54.600 align:start position:0%
however repulsive that may be I don't
 
02:51:56.929 --> 02:51:56.939 align:start position:0%
see where how do you see tell me how
 
02:51:58.790 --> 02:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
Public Safety is affected by that
 
02:51:58.800 --> 02:52:00.410 align:start position:0%
Public Safety is affected by that
immediately

02:52:00.410 --> 02:52:00.420 align:start position:0%
immediately
 
02:52:03.769 --> 02:52:03.779 align:start position:0%
first of all I would give I would I if
 
02:52:05.450 --> 02:52:05.460 align:start position:0%
you want to sponsor an amendment to
 
02:52:06.889 --> 02:52:06.899 align:start position:0%
remove the child pornography provision
 
02:52:08.450 --> 02:52:08.460 align:start position:0%
I'll let this committee evaluate that
 
02:52:10.370 --> 02:52:10.380 align:start position:0%
but I would the Supreme Court
 
02:52:12.830 --> 02:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
and they've ruled on this and this is
 
02:52:14.389 --> 02:52:14.399 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court United States that
 
02:52:15.469 --> 02:52:15.479 align:start position:0%
when you're in possession of child
 
02:52:17.389 --> 02:52:17.399 align:start position:0%
pornography the mere fact that you
 
02:52:19.550 --> 02:52:19.560 align:start position:0%
support the market the industry that in
 
02:52:21.950 --> 02:52:21.960 align:start position:0%
and of itself is harmed to a child so
 
02:52:23.630 --> 02:52:23.640 align:start position:0%
you may say oh I'm not harming the child
 
02:52:25.250 --> 02:52:25.260 align:start position:0%
because I you know I'm only watching the
 
02:52:27.290 --> 02:52:27.300 align:start position:0%
video well you're supporting the market
 
02:52:29.389 --> 02:52:29.399 align:start position:0%
where that child was harmed in that
 
02:52:32.269 --> 02:52:32.279 align:start position:0%
video never goes away so that child's
 
02:52:34.309 --> 02:52:34.319 align:start position:0%
still a victim whether you're the the
 
02:52:35.630 --> 02:52:35.640 align:start position:0%
physical actor or you're you're
 
02:52:37.429 --> 02:52:37.439 align:start position:0%
supporting it that's what the Supreme
 
02:52:39.769 --> 02:52:39.779 align:start position:0%
Court says so I stand by that
 
02:52:42.769 --> 02:52:42.779 align:start position:0%
well you've answered my question uh the
 
02:52:45.469 --> 02:52:45.479 align:start position:0%
second one is this in the Bare Bones
 
02:52:48.590 --> 02:52:48.600 align:start position:0%
anecdote that you talked about
 
02:52:52.090 --> 02:52:52.100 align:start position:0%
would the judge with respect to woman
 
02:52:54.889 --> 02:52:54.899 align:start position:0%
feloniously sold all that would a judge
 
02:52:57.410 --> 02:52:57.420 align:start position:0%
have done anything different giving your
 
02:53:00.410 --> 02:53:00.420 align:start position:0%
bare bones recital then issue a no
 
02:53:00.420 --> 02:53:03.889 align:start position:0%
bare bones recital then issue a no
contact

02:53:03.889 --> 02:53:03.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:05.870 --> 02:53:05.880 align:start position:0%
assuming that the domestic violence
 
02:53:09.230 --> 02:53:09.240 align:start position:0%
arrest was the first offense again you
 
02:53:11.510 --> 02:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
have to take in account the individual
 
02:53:13.429 --> 02:53:13.439 align:start position:0%
factors does that person have a criminal
 
02:53:15.530 --> 02:53:15.540 align:start position:0%
record have they been convicted of other
 
02:53:18.170 --> 02:53:18.180 align:start position:0%
prior domestic violence offenses do they
 
02:53:19.730 --> 02:53:19.740 align:start position:0%
have a restraining active restraining
 
02:53:21.469 --> 02:53:21.479 align:start position:0%
order there's a lot of other factors
 
02:53:22.790 --> 02:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
that can be taken into consideration
 
02:53:24.530 --> 02:53:24.540 align:start position:0%
when assessing whether someone is a
 
02:53:27.830 --> 02:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
danger to themselves of Public Safety in
 
02:53:28.910 --> 02:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
this case
 
02:53:31.490 --> 02:53:31.500 align:start position:0%
that would not have happened simply
 
02:53:32.929 --> 02:53:32.939 align:start position:0%
because the person would have been held
 
02:53:34.730 --> 02:53:34.740 align:start position:0%
and brought before a judge
 
02:53:36.710 --> 02:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
they never went before a judge they were
 
02:53:38.090 --> 02:53:38.100 align:start position:0%
released by a bail commissioner now
 
02:53:39.830 --> 02:53:39.840 align:start position:0%
would a judge made the same conclusion I
 
02:53:42.170 --> 02:53:42.180 align:start position:0%
cannot answer that I'm not I'm not clear
 
02:53:43.730 --> 02:53:43.740 align:start position:0%
if the um
 
02:53:45.410 --> 02:53:45.420 align:start position:0%
if the prosecutor would have even asked
 
02:53:48.050 --> 02:53:48.060 align:start position:0%
asked for that person be held but what I
 
02:53:49.910 --> 02:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
will point out is
 
02:53:52.010 --> 02:53:52.020 align:start position:0%
in this scenario
 
02:53:54.469 --> 02:53:54.479 align:start position:0%
was the evaluation even made by the
 
02:53:56.690 --> 02:53:56.700 align:start position:0%
court to even consider it was never went
 
02:53:58.670 --> 02:53:58.680 align:start position:0%
before court and
 
02:54:00.110 --> 02:54:00.120 align:start position:0%
consider it a cool and off period
 
02:54:03.769 --> 02:54:03.779 align:start position:0%
someone committed a violent offense
 
02:54:05.269 --> 02:54:05.279 align:start position:0%
do we want to release that person right
 
02:54:06.410 --> 02:54:06.420 align:start position:0%
away do we want that person brought
 
02:54:08.389 --> 02:54:08.399 align:start position:0%
before a judge
 
02:54:10.010 --> 02:54:10.020 align:start position:0%
it could be again if it's a repeat
 
02:54:12.290 --> 02:54:12.300 align:start position:0%
offender I think it's worth having that
 
02:54:14.510 --> 02:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
hearing and let let the
 
02:54:16.910 --> 02:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
County attorney decide what to do if
 
02:54:18.050 --> 02:54:18.060 align:start position:0%
they want to go forward with it and let
 
02:54:30.769 --> 02:54:30.779 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:32.870 --> 02:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
I have one question
 
02:54:37.010 --> 02:54:37.020 align:start position:0%
yeah I uh good to see you before us
 
02:54:39.349 --> 02:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
today I just had one question about the
 
02:54:41.690 --> 02:54:41.700 align:start position:0%
hours 24 hours and 36 hours is that
 
02:54:43.849 --> 02:54:43.859 align:start position:0%
enough time to get together
 
02:54:47.990 --> 02:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
a judge to bring people before a judge
 
02:54:49.670 --> 02:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question that time
 
02:54:52.309 --> 02:54:52.319 align:start position:0%
period is consistent with the circuit
 
02:54:54.650 --> 02:54:54.660 align:start position:0%
court and Superior Court rules it was
 
02:54:57.170 --> 02:54:57.180 align:start position:0%
taking right from there so anyone who
 
02:54:58.490 --> 02:54:58.500 align:start position:0%
has an issue with those rules I mean
 
02:55:01.550 --> 02:55:01.560 align:start position:0%
that's I don't want to take credit for
 
02:55:03.050 --> 02:55:03.060 align:start position:0%
you know supporting that that language
 
02:55:05.330 --> 02:55:05.340 align:start position:0%
already there so I think it's important
 
02:55:07.010 --> 02:55:07.020 align:start position:0%
with any policy have consistent language
 
02:55:12.830 --> 02:55:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:16.190 --> 02:55:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:19.630 --> 02:55:19.640 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes Allen
 
02:55:42.889 --> 02:55:42.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:46.910 --> 02:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
how about now well there I am all right
 
02:55:48.590 --> 02:55:48.600 align:start position:0%
so I
 
02:55:50.150 --> 02:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
like the chairman said I'm Alan
 
02:55:52.010 --> 02:55:52.020 align:start position:0%
waldenberry I'm the chief of police uh
 
02:55:53.630 --> 02:55:53.640 align:start position:0%
for the Manchester police department and
 
02:55:55.190 --> 02:55:55.200 align:start position:0%
have been sold for approximately two and
 
02:55:56.929 --> 02:55:56.939 align:start position:0%
a half years
 
02:55:58.969 --> 02:55:58.979 align:start position:0%
I sit here today in support of Senate
 
02:56:03.349 --> 02:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
bill 252. you know again I will be brief
 
02:56:06.410 --> 02:56:06.420 align:start position:0%
overall crime may be down but crime
 
02:56:07.610 --> 02:56:07.620 align:start position:0%
types that are significantly more
 
02:56:09.530 --> 02:56:09.540 align:start position:0%
harmful the community are up
 
02:56:11.809 --> 02:56:11.819 align:start position:0%
the types of refunding right the types
 
02:56:13.670 --> 02:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
of reoffending while on bail are
 
02:56:13.680 --> 02:56:14.870 align:start position:0%
of reoffending while on bail are
alarming

02:56:14.870 --> 02:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
alarming
 
02:56:17.150 --> 02:56:17.160 align:start position:0%
the inability to hold offenders some
 
02:56:19.130 --> 02:56:19.140 align:start position:0%
offenders results in Greater harm to the
 
02:56:21.410 --> 02:56:21.420 align:start position:0%
community through more victimization
 
02:56:23.210 --> 02:56:23.220 align:start position:0%
there is now no determined effect to
 
02:56:25.730 --> 02:56:25.740 align:start position:0%
arrest bail reform was passed without
 
02:56:28.190 --> 02:56:28.200 align:start position:0%
adequate pre-trial services so there's
 
02:56:31.490 --> 02:56:31.500 align:start position:0%
no oversight of offenders who do bail
 
02:56:33.650 --> 02:56:33.660 align:start position:0%
others that you've heard from today will
 
02:56:35.750 --> 02:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
state that crime is actually down since
 
02:56:37.849 --> 02:56:37.859 align:start position:0%
bail reform began and therefore there is
 
02:56:39.530 --> 02:56:39.540 align:start position:0%
no evidence that the changes to the law
 
02:56:41.929 --> 02:56:41.939 align:start position:0%
of Maine New Hampshire are less safe
 
02:56:44.090 --> 02:56:44.100 align:start position:0%
the fact is yes overall crime may be
 
02:56:46.010 --> 02:56:46.020 align:start position:0%
down in New Hampshire however that is an
 
02:56:47.990 --> 02:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
oversimplification of what our
 
02:56:49.910 --> 02:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
communities are really experiencing and
 
02:56:51.650 --> 02:56:51.660 align:start position:0%
many of you here today represent the
 
02:56:53.750 --> 02:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
community that I serve in
 
02:56:55.610 --> 02:56:55.620 align:start position:0%
this is because different crimes cause
 
02:56:57.950 --> 02:56:57.960 align:start position:0%
different harms a proper assessment
 
02:56:59.990 --> 02:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
includes detailed analysis of certain
 
02:57:01.790 --> 02:57:01.800 align:start position:0%
types of crimes to understand true
 
02:57:05.570 --> 02:57:05.580 align:start position:0%
changes in crime since bail reform began
 
02:57:08.750 --> 02:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
since bail reform began in Manchester we
 
02:57:10.550 --> 02:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
have seen simple assaults increase by
 
02:57:12.650 --> 02:57:12.660 align:start position:0%
six percent theft from buildings
 
02:57:15.110 --> 02:57:15.120 align:start position:0%
increase 145 percent
 
02:57:17.269 --> 02:57:17.279 align:start position:0%
theft from Motor Vehicles increased by
 
02:57:19.969 --> 02:57:19.979 align:start position:0%
16 percent thefts of motor vehicle parts
 
02:57:22.269 --> 02:57:22.279 align:start position:0%
and accessories increased 38 percent
 
02:57:25.370 --> 02:57:25.380 align:start position:0%
credit card credit fraud
 
02:57:27.950 --> 02:57:27.960 align:start position:0%
increased by 15 percent
 
02:57:30.889 --> 02:57:30.899 align:start position:0%
my highest priority is violent crime in
 
02:57:33.050 --> 02:57:33.060 align:start position:0%
the reduction of it and a key indicate
 
02:57:36.530 --> 02:57:36.540 align:start position:0%
key indicator we access is gun crime
 
02:57:38.870 --> 02:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
since bail reform began gun crime in
 
02:57:41.630 --> 02:57:41.640 align:start position:0%
Manchester is up 10 percent it was up 40
 
02:57:44.870 --> 02:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
percent year to year for 2022.
 
02:57:47.150 --> 02:57:47.160 align:start position:0%
gunfire incidents where an actual gun
 
02:57:52.250 --> 02:57:52.260 align:start position:0%
was fired is up 18 18 since bail reform
 
02:57:52.260 --> 02:57:53.570 align:start position:0%
was fired is up 18 18 since bail reform
began

02:57:53.570 --> 02:57:53.580 align:start position:0%
began
 
02:57:55.730 --> 02:57:55.740 align:start position:0%
fortunately our Relentless efforts on
 
02:57:57.590 --> 02:57:57.600 align:start position:0%
this problem is seeing some success and
 
02:57:59.330 --> 02:57:59.340 align:start position:0%
we've been able to reduce non-fatal
 
02:58:01.550 --> 02:58:01.560 align:start position:0%
shootings by approximately 40 percent in
 
02:58:01.560 --> 02:58:03.710 align:start position:0%
shootings by approximately 40 percent in
2022.

02:58:03.710 --> 02:58:03.720 align:start position:0%
2022.
 
02:58:05.389 --> 02:58:05.399 align:start position:0%
it is no coincidence that these
 
02:58:06.769 --> 02:58:06.779 align:start position:0%
increases have occurred since bail
 
02:58:09.290 --> 02:58:09.300 align:start position:0%
reform began the lack of ability to hold
 
02:58:11.030 --> 02:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
prolific offenders pending trial
 
02:58:13.490 --> 02:58:13.500 align:start position:0%
increases reoffending and absolutely
 
02:58:16.010 --> 02:58:16.020 align:start position:0%
makes our communities less safe
 
02:58:17.929 --> 02:58:17.939 align:start position:0%
the type of reoffending we are seeing in
 
02:58:19.670 --> 02:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
Manchester is alarming
 
02:58:22.370 --> 02:58:22.380 align:start position:0%
from April to December of 2022 again
 
02:58:25.250 --> 02:58:25.260 align:start position:0%
just from April to December
 
02:58:28.130 --> 02:58:28.140 align:start position:0%
we had over 700 arrests where the people
 
02:58:30.290 --> 02:58:30.300 align:start position:0%
reported to us at a time of arrest that
 
02:58:32.030 --> 02:58:32.040 align:start position:0%
they were out on bail again that's just
 
02:58:34.010 --> 02:58:34.020 align:start position:0%
from April to December I'm not going
 
02:58:35.269 --> 02:58:35.279 align:start position:0%

unknown what the bill was because we're
 
03:00:22.130 --> 03:00:22.140 align:start position:0%
not able to find it in their system to
 
03:00:23.750 --> 03:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
the gentleman's point and I'm sorry I
 
03:00:25.370 --> 03:00:25.380 align:start position:0%
apologize I forget your name but the
 
03:00:27.469 --> 03:00:27.479 align:start position:0%
he's absolutely right in regards to our
 
03:00:29.990 --> 03:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
ability to track bail accurately is a
 
03:00:31.490 --> 03:00:31.500 align:start position:0%
real problem and the gentleman is uh
 
03:00:34.670 --> 03:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
absolutely right in his comment on that
 
03:00:36.830 --> 03:00:36.840 align:start position:0%

finally arrested on
 
03:00:47.450 --> 03:00:47.460 align:start position:0%
January 30th of this year after being
 
03:00:49.969 --> 03:00:49.979 align:start position:0%
after several cases were issued out of
 
03:00:52.849 --> 03:00:52.859 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro Superior Court after being
 
03:00:55.370 --> 03:00:55.380 align:start position:0%
involved in a pretty significant pursuit
 
03:00:56.870 --> 03:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
in a fight with my police officers in
 
03:00:59.570 --> 03:00:59.580 align:start position:0%
which uh at least one or two were in uh
 
03:01:01.429 --> 03:01:01.439 align:start position:0%
injured as a result of
 
03:01:04.550 --> 03:01:04.560 align:start position:0%
um dealing with this individual
 
03:01:07.070 --> 03:01:07.080 align:start position:0%
so for those that
 
03:01:10.010 --> 03:01:10.020 align:start position:0%
you know I think people
 
03:01:12.469 --> 03:01:12.479 align:start position:0%
and I don't think you people here do
 
03:01:13.490 --> 03:01:13.500 align:start position:0%
this but
 
03:01:15.410 --> 03:01:15.420 align:start position:0%
people tend to minimize the
 
03:01:17.809 --> 03:01:17.819 align:start position:0%
victimization when it's not really in
 
03:01:20.090 --> 03:01:20.100 align:start position:0%
their living room or it's not in your
 
03:01:21.469 --> 03:01:21.479 align:start position:0%
front yard
 
03:01:23.570 --> 03:01:23.580 align:start position:0%
um and once it becomes reality for
 
03:01:25.309 --> 03:01:25.319 align:start position:0%
people those are the people that I get
 
03:01:26.990 --> 03:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
phone calls from when they're a
 
03:01:29.330 --> 03:01:29.340 align:start position:0%
first-time victim and they say hey chief
 
03:01:31.670 --> 03:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
what's wrong with the system why wasn't
 
03:01:34.670 --> 03:01:34.680 align:start position:0%
this person not held and it's hard for
 
03:01:38.809 --> 03:01:38.819 align:start position:0%
it's not hard it's my job to explain to
 
03:01:40.790 --> 03:01:40.800 align:start position:0%
my constituents many of which are yours
 
03:01:43.849 --> 03:01:43.859 align:start position:0%
and explain the difficulties of the bail
 
03:01:45.790 --> 03:01:45.800 align:start position:0%
and the bail system
 
03:01:48.110 --> 03:01:48.120 align:start position:0%
and to have those difficult
 
03:01:50.450 --> 03:01:50.460 align:start position:0%
conversations with these victims and to
 
03:01:52.250 --> 03:01:52.260 align:start position:0%
get them to understand the process is
 
03:01:53.870 --> 03:01:53.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes difficult and it's not their
 
03:01:53.880 --> 03:01:55.190 align:start position:0%
sometimes difficult and it's not their
fault

03:01:55.190 --> 03:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
fault
 
03:01:57.830 --> 03:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
um so again I urge you to support this
 
03:01:59.510 --> 03:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
bill I think it's a good start I think
 
03:02:02.510 --> 03:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
it's a compromise am I in support of the
 
03:02:04.610 --> 03:02:04.620 align:start position:0%
previous Bill yes I am because the
 
03:02:07.670 --> 03:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
quality of life is impacting your
 
03:02:09.590 --> 03:02:09.600 align:start position:0%
constituents that represent the city of
 
03:02:12.769 --> 03:02:12.779 align:start position:0%
Manchester and if you think it's not I
 
03:02:16.190 --> 03:02:16.200 align:start position:0%
encourage you to reach out to me come in
 
03:02:18.769 --> 03:02:18.779 align:start position:0%
and do a ride along and I'll take you
 
03:02:20.150 --> 03:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
around the city and I will show you
 
03:02:24.170 --> 03:02:24.180 align:start position:0%
where your repeat prolific offenders are
 
03:02:26.090 --> 03:02:26.100 align:start position:0%
impacting the city of Manchester in the
 
03:02:28.370 --> 03:02:28.380 align:start position:0%
quality of life because our people in
 
03:02:31.010 --> 03:02:31.020 align:start position:0%
this state in particular in Manchester
 
03:02:33.110 --> 03:02:33.120 align:start position:0%
in particular as a state as a whole
 
03:02:37.790 --> 03:02:37.800 align:start position:0%
deserve better from this body and law
 
03:02:39.410 --> 03:02:39.420 align:start position:0%
enforcement just wants to be part of
 
03:02:41.570 --> 03:02:41.580 align:start position:0%
that solution so thank you for your time
 
03:02:45.170 --> 03:02:45.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:48.050 --> 03:02:48.060 align:start position:0%
representative scitec please pardon a
 
03:02:50.030 --> 03:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
little defensiveness on my part but I
 
03:02:51.950 --> 03:02:51.960 align:start position:0%
try to do a pretty good job and I've
 
03:02:55.429 --> 03:02:55.439 align:start position:0%
listened to your list of incidents there
 
03:02:59.349 --> 03:02:59.359 align:start position:0%
were at least two where the violence the
 
03:03:04.250 --> 03:03:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:06.710 --> 03:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
that's a problem with the court that a
 
03:03:09.290 --> 03:03:09.300 align:start position:0%
judge had to let him out no nobody can
 
03:03:11.929 --> 03:03:11.939 align:start position:0%
release a stalking repeat stalker
 
03:03:14.870 --> 03:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
accepted court is that not true that's
 
03:03:17.570 --> 03:03:17.580 align:start position:0%
true sir I wasn't attacked I was I'm not
 
03:03:19.070 --> 03:03:19.080 align:start position:0%
attacking bail commissioner sir I've
 
03:03:21.530 --> 03:03:21.540 align:start position:0%
worked with them for the last 27 years
 
03:03:23.450 --> 03:03:23.460 align:start position:0%
um it's a very difficult job it's a
 
03:03:24.650 --> 03:03:24.660 align:start position:0%
thankless job
 
03:03:27.230 --> 03:03:27.240 align:start position:0%
um I think sometimes they
 
03:03:29.269 --> 03:03:29.279 align:start position:0%
I know they do the best they can every
 
03:03:31.190 --> 03:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
day when they come in and they're often
 
03:03:33.230 --> 03:03:33.240 align:start position:0%
oftentimes presented
 
03:03:34.490 --> 03:03:34.500 align:start position:0%
um you know with minimal information
 
03:03:37.550 --> 03:03:37.560 align:start position:0%
have to make very difficult decisions is
 
03:03:39.110 --> 03:03:39.120 align:start position:0%
there a problem you know quite frankly
 
03:03:40.190 --> 03:03:40.200 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:03:42.050 --> 03:03:42.060 align:start position:0%
I think from County to County court to
 
03:03:44.630 --> 03:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
court where a person appears the
 
03:03:45.710 --> 03:03:45.720 align:start position:0%
circumstances are going to be different
 
03:03:47.630 --> 03:03:47.640 align:start position:0%
I don't think to your point I think
 
03:03:49.370 --> 03:03:49.380 align:start position:0%
there's a lack of consistency across the
 
03:03:51.469 --> 03:03:51.479 align:start position:0%
courts in regards to who's released and
 
03:03:52.730 --> 03:03:52.740 align:start position:0%
who's not released
 
03:03:55.610 --> 03:03:55.620 align:start position:0%
um are you and I going to fix that
 
03:03:55.620 --> 03:03:57.290 align:start position:0%
um are you and I going to fix that
no

03:03:57.290 --> 03:03:57.300 align:start position:0%
no
 
03:04:00.050 --> 03:04:00.060 align:start position:0%
maybe for a judge someday but probably
 
03:04:04.250 --> 03:04:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:06.349 --> 03:04:06.359 align:start position:0%
representative Cameron
 
03:04:08.269 --> 03:04:08.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you chief
 
03:04:10.429 --> 03:04:10.439 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
03:04:14.150 --> 03:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
it sounds like in that particular case
 
03:04:17.990 --> 03:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
something failed now was it the law was
 
03:04:21.950 --> 03:04:21.960 align:start position:0%
it the justice that that uh set bail in
 
03:04:24.170 --> 03:04:24.180 align:start position:0%
your in your opinion I I value your
 
03:04:25.490 --> 03:04:25.500 align:start position:0%
opinion you've got a lot of experience
 
03:04:28.370 --> 03:04:28.380 align:start position:0%
who do you think uh could have prevented
 
03:04:33.349 --> 03:04:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:33.359 --> 03:04:35.210 align:start position:0%
 
overall

03:04:35.210 --> 03:04:35.220 align:start position:0%
overall
 
03:04:37.010 --> 03:04:37.020 align:start position:0%
um to be honest with you probably
 
03:04:39.110 --> 03:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
probably a judge
 
03:04:41.450 --> 03:04:41.460 align:start position:0%
um in recognizing the escalation of
 
03:04:41.460 --> 03:04:42.910 align:start position:0%
um in recognizing the escalation of
behavior

03:04:42.910 --> 03:04:42.920 align:start position:0%
behavior
 
03:04:45.349 --> 03:04:45.359 align:start position:0%
obviously I laid it out over a short
 
03:04:46.630 --> 03:04:46.640 align:start position:0%
period of time
 
03:04:50.330 --> 03:04:50.340 align:start position:0%
very violent individual that was you
 
03:04:53.030 --> 03:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
know had potential to kill somebody
 
03:04:53.040 --> 03:04:53.630 align:start position:0%
know had potential to kill somebody
um

03:04:53.630 --> 03:04:53.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:04:55.849 --> 03:04:55.859 align:start position:0%
I would say that you know a judge should
 
03:04:58.849 --> 03:04:58.859 align:start position:0%
have recognized that now you know to
 
03:05:00.889 --> 03:05:00.899 align:start position:0%
Professor Shearer's Point
 
03:05:03.230 --> 03:05:03.240 align:start position:0%
um yeah there are times when you know
 
03:05:04.849 --> 03:05:04.859 align:start position:0%
prosecutors don't make the appropriate
 
03:05:06.530 --> 03:05:06.540 align:start position:0%
argument they don't read they don't
 
03:05:10.309 --> 03:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
raise reach the bar that could be for a
 
03:05:12.050 --> 03:05:12.060 align:start position:0%
lot of reasons or they don't make the
 
03:05:14.510 --> 03:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
argument so it's really it's a
 
03:05:17.929 --> 03:05:17.939 align:start position:0%
combination of you know the total system
 
03:05:17.939 --> 03:05:19.190 align:start position:0%
combination of you know the total system
um

03:05:19.190 --> 03:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:25.070 --> 03:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:26.570 --> 03:05:26.580 align:start position:0%
you know further questions thank you
 
03:05:27.889 --> 03:05:27.899 align:start position:0%
Chief thank you for your time ladies and
 
03:05:27.899 --> 03:05:32.809 align:start position:0%
Chief thank you for your time ladies and
gentlemen

03:05:32.809 --> 03:05:32.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:02.690 --> 03:06:02.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:04.370 --> 03:06:04.380 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chair members of the committee
 
03:06:05.570 --> 03:06:05.580 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for the opportunity to
 
03:06:07.550 --> 03:06:07.560 align:start position:0%
testify my name is Frank Knack policy
 
03:06:09.110 --> 03:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
director with the ACLU of New Hampshire
 
03:06:14.150 --> 03:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
here in opposition to HB or SB 252
 
03:06:14.160 --> 03:06:14.809 align:start position:0%
here in opposition to HB or SB 252
um

03:06:14.809 --> 03:06:14.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:16.790 --> 03:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh so the handout has a lot of the
 
03:06:17.870 --> 03:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
information I'll be referring to
 
03:06:20.269 --> 03:06:20.279 align:start position:0%
including in the um the the appendix to
 
03:06:21.950 --> 03:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
the handouts
 
03:06:23.690 --> 03:06:23.700 align:start position:0%
um but really just want to focus on the
 
03:06:25.370 --> 03:06:25.380 align:start position:0%
the basic fact that we've all talked
 
03:06:28.010 --> 03:06:28.020 align:start position:0%
about before that again the current bail
 
03:06:30.650 --> 03:06:30.660 align:start position:0%
statute provides Myriad opportunities to
 
03:06:33.110 --> 03:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
hold any individual if they violate
 
03:06:35.269 --> 03:06:35.279 align:start position:0%
their conditions if a prosecutor
 
03:06:37.250 --> 03:06:37.260 align:start position:0%
disagrees with their lease order
 
03:06:38.929 --> 03:06:38.939 align:start position:0%
Etc there are multiple ways that someone
 
03:06:40.969 --> 03:06:40.979 align:start position:0%
can be held and the beauty of the
 
03:06:42.349 --> 03:06:42.359 align:start position:0%
current statute is that it's
 
03:06:44.450 --> 03:06:44.460 align:start position:0%
individualized it takes the individual
 
03:06:46.490 --> 03:06:46.500 align:start position:0%
who comes before the bail commissioner
 
03:06:49.550 --> 03:06:49.560 align:start position:0%
before the judge that person can look at
 
03:06:51.590 --> 03:06:51.600 align:start position:0%
that person's facts in that case and
 
03:06:53.450 --> 03:06:53.460 align:start position:0%
determine if that person is a danger or
 
03:06:55.730 --> 03:06:55.740 align:start position:0%
Flight Risk as the Constitution requires
 
03:06:59.170 --> 03:06:59.180 align:start position:0%
it is a system that has functioned well
 
03:07:02.269 --> 03:07:02.279 align:start position:0%
and when we have heard concerns with the
 
03:07:04.429 --> 03:07:04.439 align:start position:0%
existing system these anecdotes when you
 
03:07:06.170 --> 03:07:06.180 align:start position:0%
actually dig into the anecdotes as
 
03:07:08.389 --> 03:07:08.399 align:start position:0%
representative sitak pointed out the
 
03:07:10.610 --> 03:07:10.620 align:start position:0%
facts don't match the anecdote so in the
 
03:07:11.990 --> 03:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
case of stalking where it wasn't a bail
 
03:07:13.309 --> 03:07:13.319 align:start position:0%
commissioner it was a judge who made the
 
03:07:15.410 --> 03:07:15.420 align:start position:0%
order again under this I'm under this
 
03:07:17.929 --> 03:07:17.939 align:start position:0%
proposed Bill the individuals are not
 
03:07:19.730 --> 03:07:19.740 align:start position:0%
going to be held pre-trial indefinitely
 
03:07:21.230 --> 03:07:21.240 align:start position:0%
they're going to be held for a couple of
 
03:07:23.090 --> 03:07:23.100 align:start position:0%
days and taken away from their lives
 
03:07:25.070 --> 03:07:25.080 align:start position:0%
until they get before a judge they're
 
03:07:28.250 --> 03:07:28.260 align:start position:0%
just going to miss the bail commissioner
 
03:07:30.230 --> 03:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
um and so in that case again that person
 
03:07:33.130 --> 03:07:33.140 align:start position:0%
could be released so in the case of
 
03:07:35.990 --> 03:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
Representative sideak uh mentioned we
 
03:07:37.969 --> 03:07:37.979 align:start position:0%
also heard earlier in the Senate
 
03:07:39.590 --> 03:07:39.600 align:start position:0%
testimony on this bill when this bill
 
03:07:41.349 --> 03:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
was originally introduced the big
 
03:07:43.429 --> 03:07:43.439 align:start position:0%
anecdotal case that they were relying
 
03:07:45.230 --> 03:07:45.240 align:start position:0%
upon was the horrific murder in
 
03:07:48.950 --> 03:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
Manchester which happened last year and
 
03:07:51.830 --> 03:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
so when that murder happened again it
 
03:07:54.110 --> 03:07:54.120 align:start position:0%
was a frontal attack on bail system has
 
03:07:56.330 --> 03:07:56.340 align:start position:0%
failed and it wasn't until when
 
03:07:58.429 --> 03:07:58.439 align:start position:0%
Professor Sher who who had to
 
03:07:59.690 --> 03:07:59.700 align:start position:0%
unfortunately leave and you can't
 
03:08:01.130 --> 03:08:01.140 align:start position:0%
testify in this bill but I think he'll
 
03:08:02.750 --> 03:08:02.760 align:start position:0%
be sending you notes when he actually
 
03:08:04.429 --> 03:08:04.439 align:start position:0%
dug into that case and looked at the
 
03:08:06.710 --> 03:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
facts in that case where it became clear
 
03:08:08.330 --> 03:08:08.340 align:start position:0%
that it had nothing to do with bail
 
03:08:09.830 --> 03:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
Commissioners it had to do it had
 
03:08:11.269 --> 03:08:11.279 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with the courts it had to
 
03:08:13.370 --> 03:08:13.380 align:start position:0%
do with prosecutors not doing their job
 
03:08:17.630 --> 03:08:17.640 align:start position:0%
in multiple instances and to lead to
 
03:08:19.969 --> 03:08:19.979 align:start position:0%
that person to not be held so again
 
03:08:22.130 --> 03:08:22.140 align:start position:0%
using that that anecdote was the
 
03:08:23.750 --> 03:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
anecdote that we were going to repeal
 
03:08:25.610 --> 03:08:25.620 align:start position:0%
Bill reform with until the facts came
 
03:08:27.769 --> 03:08:27.779 align:start position:0%
out again we heard another anecdote here
 
03:08:29.809 --> 03:08:29.819 align:start position:0%
but when we actually look at the facts
 
03:08:31.370 --> 03:08:31.380 align:start position:0%
behind these anecdotes it's all too
 
03:08:33.230 --> 03:08:33.240 align:start position:0%
often that the facts don't match the
 
03:08:35.570 --> 03:08:35.580 align:start position:0%
rhetoric and so we're deeply concerned
 
03:08:37.130 --> 03:08:37.140 align:start position:0%
that we would be repealing an entire
 
03:08:40.010 --> 03:08:40.020 align:start position:0%
section of a bail reform based on these
 
03:08:41.809 --> 03:08:41.819 align:start position:0%
anecdotes that are that are kind of
 
03:08:44.510 --> 03:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
paper thin when you start digging
 
03:08:47.150 --> 03:08:47.160 align:start position:0%
um we also heard the chief talk about I
 
03:08:48.950 --> 03:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
think probably assuming what what we had
 
03:08:50.389 --> 03:08:50.399 align:start position:0%
testified in the past that we were going
 
03:08:52.190 --> 03:08:52.200 align:start position:0%
to talk about reductions in crime rates
 
03:08:53.929 --> 03:08:53.939 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire well that isn't a you
 
03:08:55.670 --> 03:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
know an undeniable fact since bail
 
03:08:57.889 --> 03:08:57.899 align:start position:0%
reform in New Hampshire crime we're
 
03:08:59.870 --> 03:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
talking about group a crime and so just
 
03:09:01.790 --> 03:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
so you know our source for this it's the
 
03:09:04.429 --> 03:09:04.439 align:start position:0%
department of safety has great crime
 
03:09:07.550 --> 03:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
records data so we took Department of
 
03:09:10.010 --> 03:09:10.020 align:start position:0%
State these information from 2018 which
 
03:09:12.469 --> 03:09:12.479 align:start position:0%
is your bail reform through 2021 which
 
03:09:14.809 --> 03:09:14.819 align:start position:0%
was the most recent year for uh data
 
03:09:16.790 --> 03:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
available crime overall on group a
 
03:09:18.769 --> 03:09:18.779 align:start position:0%
crimes which is all violent offenses and
 
03:09:20.450 --> 03:09:20.460 align:start position:0%
the majority of other offenses is down
 
03:09:20.460 --> 03:09:21.370 align:start position:0%
the majority of other offenses is down
18

03:09:21.370 --> 03:09:21.380 align:start position:0%
18
 
03:09:23.809 --> 03:09:23.819 align:start position:0%
in Bedford where we heard the chief
 
03:09:27.050 --> 03:09:27.060 align:start position:0%
testify on the last bill group a crimes
 
03:09:30.290 --> 03:09:30.300 align:start position:0%
and arrests are down 21 over 21 percent
 
03:09:32.809 --> 03:09:32.819 align:start position:0%
in Manchester group a crimes and arrests
 
03:09:34.450 --> 03:09:34.460 align:start position:0%
are Down group a crimes are down 13
 
03:09:37.670 --> 03:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
arrests are down 33 percent and so while
 
03:09:39.010 --> 03:09:39.020 align:start position:0%
they're absolutely going to be
 
03:09:41.150 --> 03:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
cherry-picked opportunities to say well
 
03:09:43.730 --> 03:09:43.740 align:start position:0%
in this case crime has gone up it's gone
 
03:09:46.429 --> 03:09:46.439 align:start position:0%
down drastically over the past four or
 
03:09:48.410 --> 03:09:48.420 align:start position:0%
five years since bail reform uh in New
 
03:09:51.469 --> 03:09:51.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in Bedford and Manchester
 
03:09:52.969 --> 03:09:52.979 align:start position:0%
um and so I'm not going to sit here and
 
03:09:55.130 --> 03:09:55.140 align:start position:0%
say bail reform is the reason that crime
 
03:09:56.990 --> 03:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
has decreased that would be disingenuous
 
03:09:59.150 --> 03:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
of me but the the fact that others are
 
03:10:01.190 --> 03:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
trying to argue that bill reform has
 
03:10:03.050 --> 03:10:03.060 align:start position:0%
somehow undermined Community safety is
 
03:10:06.710 --> 03:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
again not backed by any actual facts
 
03:10:08.929 --> 03:10:08.939 align:start position:0%
um again we also heard Public Safety and
 
03:10:10.610 --> 03:10:10.620 align:start position:0%
I talked a little bit about this in on
 
03:10:12.410 --> 03:10:12.420 align:start position:0%
the last bill but the fact of the matter
 
03:10:14.450 --> 03:10:14.460 align:start position:0%
is when you actually look if we really
 
03:10:16.070 --> 03:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
care about public safety and we actually
 
03:10:18.889 --> 03:10:18.899 align:start position:0%
look at the impact of carceral
 
03:10:21.410 --> 03:10:21.420 align:start position:0%
approaches pre-trial the data is
 
03:10:24.110 --> 03:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely crystal clear Decades of data
 
03:10:26.230 --> 03:10:26.240 align:start position:0%
on this issue that holding people
 
03:10:28.969 --> 03:10:28.979 align:start position:0%
pre-trial unless there's individualized
 
03:10:31.010 --> 03:10:31.020 align:start position:0%
determination of dangerness is actually
 
03:10:32.990 --> 03:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
a net harm to the communities because
 
03:10:34.190 --> 03:10:34.200 align:start position:0%
it's going to pull them out of their
 
03:10:36.230 --> 03:10:36.240 align:start position:0%
Community it's going to increase their
 
03:10:38.150 --> 03:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
likelihood of recidivating down the road
 
03:10:39.710 --> 03:10:39.720 align:start position:0%
because they have been pulled away from
 
03:10:42.110 --> 03:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
the community from their job access to
 
03:10:44.389 --> 03:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
employment Etc
 
03:10:44.399 --> 03:10:45.290 align:start position:0%
employment Etc
um

03:10:45.290 --> 03:10:45.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:46.849 --> 03:10:46.859 align:start position:0%
and finally
 
03:10:48.530 --> 03:10:48.540 align:start position:0%
um you know that we have great
 
03:10:50.150 --> 03:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
opportunities to actually look forward
 
03:10:52.370 --> 03:10:52.380 align:start position:0%
and to strengthen the bail system so uh
 
03:10:54.050 --> 03:10:54.060 align:start position:0%
representative Harry gathwright's Bill
 
03:10:56.450 --> 03:10:56.460 align:start position:0%
to move towards uh potentially studying
 
03:10:58.190 --> 03:10:58.200 align:start position:0%
whether it would make sense to have a
 
03:10:59.570 --> 03:10:59.580 align:start position:0%
magistrate system or some hybrid
 
03:11:01.250 --> 03:11:01.260 align:start position:0%
magistrate bail commissioner system
 
03:11:03.050 --> 03:11:03.060 align:start position:0%
whatever that might look like and
 
03:11:04.370 --> 03:11:04.380 align:start position:0%
actually taking time to look through
 
03:11:07.490 --> 03:11:07.500 align:start position:0%
that uh chairman Roy's work to get the
 
03:11:09.349 --> 03:11:09.359 align:start position:0%
funding into the budget around real-time
 
03:11:11.870 --> 03:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
bail tracking system those are concrete
 
03:11:13.790 --> 03:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
steps that we can take to ensure that we
 
03:11:16.150 --> 03:11:16.160 align:start position:0%
have a bail system that is stronger
 
03:11:19.450 --> 03:11:19.460 align:start position:0%
versus this which is an anecdote-based
 
03:11:23.330 --> 03:11:23.340 align:start position:0%
attempt to which will result only in
 
03:11:25.309 --> 03:11:25.319 align:start position:0%
individuals being held unnecessarily
 
03:11:27.230 --> 03:11:27.240 align:start position:0%
potentially thousands of individuals
 
03:11:29.809 --> 03:11:29.819 align:start position:0%
every year and so from Australia's
 
03:11:31.550 --> 03:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
perspective the cost savings argument is
 
03:11:33.469 --> 03:11:33.479 align:start position:0%
less important to us but also you know
 
03:11:35.570 --> 03:11:35.580 align:start position:0%
we're talking about 1.5 I think million
 
03:11:38.450 --> 03:11:38.460 align:start position:0%
dollars just on the state level for the
 
03:11:40.370 --> 03:11:40.380 align:start position:0%
courts that does nothing to talk about
 
03:11:42.110 --> 03:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
the fact that we're going to be spending
 
03:11:45.650 --> 03:11:45.660 align:start position:0%
105 to 125 a day to jail and all those
 
03:11:47.269 --> 03:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
individuals which would be an unfunded
 
03:11:51.010 --> 03:11:51.020 align:start position:0%
mandate on all of your localities
 
03:11:53.690 --> 03:11:53.700 align:start position:0%
particularly I think it's important from
 
03:11:55.670 --> 03:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
a cost savings from an ace perspective
 
03:11:57.950 --> 03:11:57.960 align:start position:0%
from a cost perspective because we do
 
03:11:59.450 --> 03:11:59.460 align:start position:0%
know things that will actually improve
 
03:12:01.130 --> 03:12:01.140 align:start position:0%
if we really care about Public Safety
 
03:12:04.309 --> 03:12:04.319 align:start position:0%
housing access is connected to Public
 
03:12:06.530 --> 03:12:06.540 align:start position:0%
Safety there's reductions in crime when
 
03:12:09.110 --> 03:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
you have better access to housing there
 
03:12:10.490 --> 03:12:10.500 align:start position:0%
are multiple ways that if we really are
 
03:12:12.050 --> 03:12:12.060 align:start position:0%
concerned about Public Safety that we
 
03:12:13.969 --> 03:12:13.979 align:start position:0%
can investing those dollars to actually
 
03:12:17.090 --> 03:12:17.100 align:start position:0%
make our community safer so happy to
 
03:12:18.650 --> 03:12:18.660 align:start position:0%
take any questions and really appreciate
 
03:12:21.650 --> 03:12:21.660 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to testify thank you
 
03:12:23.570 --> 03:12:23.580 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler thank you Mr
 
03:12:26.030 --> 03:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you Mr Knack we heard a
 
03:12:28.490 --> 03:12:28.500 align:start position:0%
lot of different statistics today I'm
 
03:12:31.010 --> 03:12:31.020 align:start position:0%
just wondering if you could address what
 
03:12:34.130 --> 03:12:34.140 align:start position:0%
Chief eldenburg said about crime is down
 
03:12:36.889 --> 03:12:36.899 align:start position:0%
but the specific crimes that are hurting
 
03:12:39.290 --> 03:12:39.300 align:start position:0%
people whether it's property crimes for
 
03:12:42.410 --> 03:12:42.420 align:start position:0%
the catalytic converters or whatever
 
03:12:44.750 --> 03:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
um else the chief had said he said those
 
03:12:46.849 --> 03:12:46.859 align:start position:0%
were up despite crime being down I
 
03:12:47.990 --> 03:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
wonder if you could address that point
 
03:12:50.030 --> 03:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
yeah definitely so these this is what
 
03:12:51.530 --> 03:12:51.540 align:start position:0%
the sheet looks like if you go to the
 
03:12:53.150 --> 03:12:53.160 align:start position:0%
Department of safety's website so this
 
03:12:55.670 --> 03:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
is Manchester for example so all the
 
03:12:58.070 --> 03:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
group a offenses by offense type and
 
03:13:01.670 --> 03:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
then reported and cleared arrests and
 
03:13:04.130 --> 03:13:04.140 align:start position:0%
um for adults and juveniles and so you
 
03:13:05.330 --> 03:13:05.340 align:start position:0%
can definitely go through here and
 
03:13:07.490 --> 03:13:07.500 align:start position:0%
cherry pick a few where crime may have
 
03:13:09.290 --> 03:13:09.300 align:start position:0%
gone up slightly
 
03:13:11.750 --> 03:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
um but overall and particularly for the
 
03:13:13.610 --> 03:13:13.620 align:start position:0%
more serious offenses crime is down
 
03:13:16.250 --> 03:13:16.260 align:start position:0%
substantially in Manchester in Bedford
 
03:13:18.650 --> 03:13:18.660 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire overall
 
03:13:21.110 --> 03:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
um and so I'll go back and look at what
 
03:13:23.210 --> 03:13:23.220 align:start position:0%
the specific I know I think you
 
03:13:25.070 --> 03:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned like three or four crime types
 
03:13:27.710 --> 03:13:27.720 align:start position:0%
so I can go back and look through that
 
03:13:29.809 --> 03:13:29.819 align:start position:0%
um but I could also you know quickly
 
03:13:31.490 --> 03:13:31.500 align:start position:0%
cherry pick a number of other specific
 
03:13:32.750 --> 03:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
offenses where it's gone down
 
03:13:34.910 --> 03:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
substantially I think it's important to
 
03:13:36.889 --> 03:13:36.899 align:start position:0%
look overall at the data and then to
 
03:13:42.849 --> 03:13:42.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:45.670 --> 03:13:45.680 align:start position:0%
representative Muse
 
03:13:48.130 --> 03:13:48.140 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question
 
03:13:51.710 --> 03:13:51.720 align:start position:0%
earlier we heard Senator Susie talk
 
03:13:54.530 --> 03:13:54.540 align:start position:0%
about how a large part of why we're in
 
03:13:56.030 --> 03:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
the situation we're in is really a
 
03:14:00.710 --> 03:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
failure an infrastructure to support
 
03:14:03.769 --> 03:14:03.779 align:start position:0%
um support the current law
 
03:14:03.779 --> 03:14:06.830 align:start position:0%
um support the current law
um

03:14:06.830 --> 03:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:11.290 --> 03:14:11.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:15.469 --> 03:14:15.479 align:start position:0%
this particular bill doesn't attempt to
 
03:14:17.929 --> 03:14:17.939 align:start position:0%
address those infrastructure issues at
 
03:14:20.030 --> 03:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
all what it attempts to do is to change
 
03:14:22.190 --> 03:14:22.200 align:start position:0%
the law
 
03:14:22.200 --> 03:14:22.849 align:start position:0%
the law
um

03:14:22.849 --> 03:14:22.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:25.250 --> 03:14:25.260 align:start position:0%
from a from a constitutional perspective
 
03:14:26.630 --> 03:14:26.640 align:start position:0%
and I know one of the things we're
 
03:14:28.969 --> 03:14:28.979 align:start position:0%
always very concerned we're always
 
03:14:30.530 --> 03:14:30.540 align:start position:0%
concerned about the rights of victims
 
03:14:32.630 --> 03:14:32.640 align:start position:0%
but I think we're also very much aware
 
03:14:35.330 --> 03:14:35.340 align:start position:0%
of the power of the state over an
 
03:14:37.190 --> 03:14:37.200 align:start position:0%
individual who might find himself or
 
03:14:39.590 --> 03:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
herself in one of these situations from
 
03:14:41.110 --> 03:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
a constitutional
 
03:14:41.120 --> 03:14:43.010 align:start position:0%
a constitutional
perspective

03:14:43.010 --> 03:14:43.020 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
03:14:43.020 --> 03:14:44.410 align:start position:0%
perspective
um

03:14:44.410 --> 03:14:44.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:49.250 --> 03:14:49.260 align:start position:0%
does a bill like this pass pass muster
 
03:14:53.809 --> 03:14:53.819 align:start position:0%
is are we still being as protective when
 
03:14:56.090 --> 03:14:56.100 align:start position:0%
it comes to the rights of individuals as
 
03:14:58.849 --> 03:14:58.859 align:start position:0%
we need to be if we if we pass a law
 
03:15:01.490 --> 03:15:01.500 align:start position:0%
like this without actually addressing
 
03:15:03.050 --> 03:15:03.060 align:start position:0%
any of the same the infrastructure
 
03:15:05.269 --> 03:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
issues I guess I'm concerned that
 
03:15:07.370 --> 03:15:07.380 align:start position:0%
the kind of infrastructure issues that
 
03:15:11.050 --> 03:15:11.060 align:start position:0%
are making the current statute
 
03:15:13.630 --> 03:15:13.640 align:start position:0%
occasionally fail
 
03:15:16.969 --> 03:15:16.979 align:start position:0%
if we're not addressing them as as part
 
03:15:19.250 --> 03:15:19.260 align:start position:0%
of this are we really are we really
 
03:15:21.290 --> 03:15:21.300 align:start position:0%
helping or are we just sort of opening
 
03:15:24.650 --> 03:15:24.660 align:start position:0%
up a constitutional bag of worms
 
03:15:26.450 --> 03:15:26.460 align:start position:0%
no I definitely appreciate that question
 
03:15:28.550 --> 03:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
and and to give a little bit of context
 
03:15:30.290 --> 03:15:30.300 align:start position:0%
to my answer
 
03:15:32.150 --> 03:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
um you know I think it is somewhat
 
03:15:32.160 --> 03:15:33.170 align:start position:0%
um you know I think it is somewhat
frustrating

03:15:33.170 --> 03:15:33.180 align:start position:0%
frustrating
 
03:15:34.929 --> 03:15:34.939 align:start position:0%
um the Monopoly that I think certain
 
03:15:37.250 --> 03:15:37.260 align:start position:0%
folks think they have over certain terms
 
03:15:39.170 --> 03:15:39.180 align:start position:0%
like victims and so from my perspective
 
03:15:40.790 --> 03:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
you know before in this role I was
 
03:15:41.929 --> 03:15:41.939 align:start position:0%
working I worked for the Montana
 
03:15:44.750 --> 03:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
Innocence Project and so worked directly
 
03:15:46.550 --> 03:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
every day with people including folks
 
03:15:48.650 --> 03:15:48.660 align:start position:0%
two folks who had been held incarcerated
 
03:15:50.990 --> 03:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
for 23 years each for a crime that they
 
03:15:52.849 --> 03:15:52.859 align:start position:0%
didn't commit and that the police knew
 
03:15:55.730 --> 03:15:55.740 align:start position:0%
they didn't commit on the front end and
 
03:15:58.550 --> 03:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
so it is you know dealt with both both
 
03:16:00.530 --> 03:16:00.540 align:start position:0%
of them and the trauma they faced their
 
03:16:02.389 --> 03:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
family members on a daily basis talking
 
03:16:04.070 --> 03:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
to them regularly about the trauma that
 
03:16:05.450 --> 03:16:05.460 align:start position:0%
they faced not only you know being
 
03:16:07.010 --> 03:16:07.020 align:start position:0%
separated from their family but also
 
03:16:08.870 --> 03:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
having a loved one who was accused of a
 
03:16:10.550 --> 03:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
heinous offense that everyone should
 
03:16:11.690 --> 03:16:11.700 align:start position:0%
have known on the front end didn't
 
03:16:14.929 --> 03:16:14.939 align:start position:0%
happen and so again when we heard from
 
03:16:17.090 --> 03:16:17.100 align:start position:0%
Professor sure 36 percent of these cases
 
03:16:19.250 --> 03:16:19.260 align:start position:0%
are dismissed or no pros and I think you
 
03:16:21.469 --> 03:16:21.479 align:start position:0%
know there may be a few where the plea
 
03:16:23.269 --> 03:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
impacted that but again we're assuming
 
03:16:24.590 --> 03:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
that all these people committed the
 
03:16:27.590 --> 03:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
fence when the facts are possibly very
 
03:16:29.450 --> 03:16:29.460 align:start position:0%
likely that not a good chunk of those
 
03:16:30.769 --> 03:16:30.779 align:start position:0%
folks didn't do anything in the first
 
03:16:30.779 --> 03:16:32.210 align:start position:0%
folks didn't do anything in the first
place

03:16:32.210 --> 03:16:32.220 align:start position:0%
place
 
03:16:34.690 --> 03:16:34.700 align:start position:0%
um or were over drastically overcharged
 
03:16:36.950 --> 03:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
but getting to the Constitutional clash
 
03:16:38.090 --> 03:16:38.100 align:start position:0%
in the U.S you know the Supreme Court
 
03:16:40.790 --> 03:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
has always been clear that individuals
 
03:16:42.170 --> 03:16:42.180 align:start position:0%
there has to be an individualized
 
03:16:43.910 --> 03:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
determination there has to be a finding
 
03:16:45.590 --> 03:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
of dangerousness and it has to be a
 
03:16:47.230 --> 03:16:47.240 align:start position:0%
finding at a clear and convincing level
 
03:16:50.150 --> 03:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
and so again we have concerns with
 
03:16:52.550 --> 03:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
blanket opportunity blanket holds like
 
03:16:54.889 --> 03:16:54.899 align:start position:0%
this would have so you know there's
 
03:16:56.809 --> 03:16:56.819 align:start position:0%
definitely some question here about how
 
03:16:58.610 --> 03:16:58.620 align:start position:0%
this would because this is holding just
 
03:17:00.410 --> 03:17:00.420 align:start position:0%
before a judge not all the way through
 
03:17:03.410 --> 03:17:03.420 align:start position:0%
pre-trial detention so being transparent
 
03:17:05.090 --> 03:17:05.100 align:start position:0%
I think there are some factors here that
 
03:17:07.190 --> 03:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
might weigh there but I do think that
 
03:17:08.750 --> 03:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
there are serious concerns here from a
 
03:17:10.670 --> 03:17:10.680 align:start position:0%
constitutional perspective
 
03:17:13.130 --> 03:17:13.140 align:start position:0%
um and again that I think our concern
 
03:17:14.630 --> 03:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
with this as well the bigger picture
 
03:17:16.730 --> 03:17:16.740 align:start position:0%
concern is we are just wholeheartedly
 
03:17:19.190 --> 03:17:19.200 align:start position:0%
considering you're this person charged
 
03:17:21.490 --> 03:17:21.500 align:start position:0%
with this offense is going to be held
 
03:17:23.690 --> 03:17:23.700 align:start position:0%
regardless of the facts in that case
 
03:17:26.330 --> 03:17:26.340 align:start position:0%
regard regardless of whether you know as
 
03:17:28.070 --> 03:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
you all often know when prosecutors get
 
03:17:30.110 --> 03:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
the case File they could be like oh this
 
03:17:31.370 --> 03:17:31.380 align:start position:0%
is way overcharged I'm going to reduce
 
03:17:34.070 --> 03:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
so that ignores all of those facts
 
03:17:35.750 --> 03:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
um that we're just going to blanket hold
 
03:17:38.090 --> 03:17:38.100 align:start position:0%
this whole set of people and do so at a
 
03:17:39.769 --> 03:17:39.779 align:start position:0%
time when we have absolutely no hard
 
03:17:41.990 --> 03:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
data to show that there's actually any
 
03:17:43.610 --> 03:17:43.620 align:start position:0%
problem and that this is actually a
 
03:17:45.889 --> 03:17:45.899 align:start position:0%
solution and when we do know the facts
 
03:17:47.990 --> 03:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
are clear that there are Myriad ways
 
03:17:49.610 --> 03:17:49.620 align:start position:0%
that individuals could be held right now
 
03:17:51.769 --> 03:17:51.779 align:start position:0%
and that the for whatever reason would
 
03:17:53.450 --> 03:17:53.460 align:start position:0%
be it prosecutors not doing their job
 
03:17:56.750 --> 03:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
whatever they're not being held so we
 
03:18:02.510 --> 03:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:06.290 --> 03:18:06.300 align:start position:0%
Mr connect can I ask you to stay uh I
 
03:18:08.389 --> 03:18:08.399 align:start position:0%
can't believe the police held somebody
 
03:18:10.969 --> 03:18:10.979 align:start position:0%
years that knew he didn't care but
 
03:18:16.010 --> 03:18:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:21.889 --> 03:18:21.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:33.349 --> 03:18:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:35.030 --> 03:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon my name is David
 
03:18:37.670 --> 03:18:37.680 align:start position:0%
Rothstein again I'm here uh on behalf of
 
03:18:39.650 --> 03:18:39.660 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Association of
 
03:18:41.150 --> 03:18:41.160 align:start position:0%
criminal defense attorneys I am not
 
03:18:46.190 --> 03:18:46.200 align:start position:0%
going to repeat uh comments I basically
 
03:18:48.050 --> 03:18:48.060 align:start position:0%
just wanted to
 
03:18:51.590 --> 03:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
State my I think what I have said before
 
03:18:54.950 --> 03:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
is that the the best approach on bail
 
03:18:57.710 --> 03:18:57.720 align:start position:0%
continues to be a totality of the
 
03:18:59.690 --> 03:18:59.700 align:start position:0%
circumstances approach which would
 
03:19:01.910 --> 03:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
consider certainly the nature of the
 
03:19:03.410 --> 03:19:03.420 align:start position:0%
offense absolutely as a bail
 
03:19:05.330 --> 03:19:05.340 align:start position:0%
commissioner as a judge when you hear
 
03:19:07.010 --> 03:19:07.020 align:start position:0%
there's a certain offense you you raise
 
03:19:08.630 --> 03:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
an eyebrow you focus in if it's
 
03:19:10.910 --> 03:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
aggravated for any sexual assault or if
 
03:19:13.130 --> 03:19:13.140 align:start position:0%
it's disorderly conduct on the street
 
03:19:15.469 --> 03:19:15.479 align:start position:0%
corner you you have a much different
 
03:19:17.570 --> 03:19:17.580 align:start position:0%
perspective you have to look at the
 
03:19:18.950 --> 03:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
offense you have to look at
 
03:19:20.570 --> 03:19:20.580 align:start position:0%
individualized factors as I believe
 
03:19:22.490 --> 03:19:22.500 align:start position:0%
Senator Abba said you have to look at
 
03:19:25.309 --> 03:19:25.319 align:start position:0%
the offender a couple of comments on
 
03:19:27.230 --> 03:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
this list which other people have
 
03:19:30.050 --> 03:19:30.060 align:start position:0%
commented on it starts with homicide and
 
03:19:33.050 --> 03:19:33.060 align:start position:0%
it includes which is obviously the most
 
03:19:34.870 --> 03:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
serious offense under our criminal code
 
03:19:37.570 --> 03:19:37.580 align:start position:0%
it also includes
 
03:19:40.010 --> 03:19:40.020 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor domestic violence or
 
03:19:42.050 --> 03:19:42.060 align:start position:0%
stalking offenses it also includes
 
03:19:44.269 --> 03:19:44.279 align:start position:0%
second-degree assault offenses which I
 
03:19:45.769 --> 03:19:45.779 align:start position:0%
had done some prior research when I was
 
03:19:47.769 --> 03:19:47.779 align:start position:0%
with the public defender there are many
 
03:19:50.510 --> 03:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
second-degree assault offenses that are
 
03:19:52.550 --> 03:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
overcharged and when you look at how
 
03:19:55.130 --> 03:19:55.140 align:start position:0%
they ultimately resolve they resolve as
 
03:19:56.990 --> 03:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors with no time once everybody
 
03:19:59.050 --> 03:19:59.060 align:start position:0%
has a chance to look at them or even
 
03:20:04.130 --> 03:20:04.140 align:start position:0%
lesser so to treat a homicide offense in
 
03:20:07.130 --> 03:20:07.140 align:start position:0%
the same sort of sequence of crimes as
 
03:20:08.870 --> 03:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
some of these other offenses seems to me
 
03:20:09.849 --> 03:20:09.859 align:start position:0%
to be
 
03:20:12.830 --> 03:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
improper if you think about homicide the
 
03:20:14.389 --> 03:20:14.399 align:start position:0%
average sentence that a person is going
 
03:20:16.130 --> 03:20:16.140 align:start position:0%
to get in a homicide case in New
 
03:20:18.590 --> 03:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is about 30 to life the
 
03:20:20.150 --> 03:20:20.160 align:start position:0%
average sentence that someone is going
 
03:20:22.670 --> 03:20:22.680 align:start position:0%
to get on a first-time domestic violence
 
03:20:25.429 --> 03:20:25.439 align:start position:0%
offense if the case goes to prosecution
 
03:20:27.830 --> 03:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
is going to be a suspended sentence with
 
03:20:29.690 --> 03:20:29.700 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to potentially
 
03:20:32.330 --> 03:20:32.340 align:start position:0%
participate in some counseling the case
 
03:20:34.550 --> 03:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
analysis in a homicide is also very very
 
03:20:36.410 --> 03:20:36.420 align:start position:0%
different a homicide is being brought by
 
03:20:38.990 --> 03:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office the cases
 
03:20:41.809 --> 03:20:41.819 align:start position:0%
are typically extremely strong they
 
03:20:43.550 --> 03:20:43.560 align:start position:0%
typically either go to trial where the
 
03:20:45.410 --> 03:20:45.420 align:start position:0%
person is found guilty after trial of
 
03:20:47.330 --> 03:20:47.340 align:start position:0%
first or second degree murder or where
 
03:20:48.650 --> 03:20:48.660 align:start position:0%
there's a plea to something like 30
 
03:20:51.110 --> 03:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
degrees to life these other types of
 
03:20:53.389 --> 03:20:53.399 align:start position:0%
cases the the domestic violence case is
 
03:20:55.490 --> 03:20:55.500 align:start position:0%
the second degree assault cases the case
 
03:20:58.429 --> 03:20:58.439 align:start position:0%
analysis is very very different we talk
 
03:21:01.610 --> 03:21:01.620 align:start position:0%
about this as being a back-end system if
 
03:21:04.010 --> 03:21:04.020 align:start position:0%
you look at the back end those cases do
 
03:21:06.170 --> 03:21:06.180 align:start position:0%
not tend to get significant jail
 
03:21:08.269 --> 03:21:08.279 align:start position:0%
sentences or prison sentences they
 
03:21:10.070 --> 03:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
oftentimes don't even result in felony
 
03:21:10.080 --> 03:21:11.150 align:start position:0%
oftentimes don't even result in felony
convictions

03:21:11.150 --> 03:21:11.160 align:start position:0%
convictions
 
03:21:12.889 --> 03:21:12.899 align:start position:0%
I think that there are some people
 
03:21:15.230 --> 03:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
charged with aggravated feloniosexual
 
03:21:17.150 --> 03:21:17.160 align:start position:0%
assault who absolutely should be
 
03:21:19.429 --> 03:21:19.439 align:start position:0%
detained pending trial I've had some of
 
03:21:21.530 --> 03:21:21.540 align:start position:0%
those clients I had a Manchester client
 
03:21:23.510 --> 03:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
who was alleged to be a serial rapist in
 
03:21:26.389 --> 03:21:26.399 align:start position:0%
Manchester he was detained pending trial
 
03:21:28.670 --> 03:21:28.680 align:start position:0%
we had a trial he was convicted I've had
 
03:21:30.170 --> 03:21:30.180 align:start position:0%
other clients charged with aggravated
 
03:21:32.210 --> 03:21:32.220 align:start position:0%
formosexual assault where perhaps its
 
03:21:35.090 --> 03:21:35.100 align:start position:0%
delayed report for many years ago the
 
03:21:36.950 --> 03:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
client has no criminal record the client
 
03:21:39.349 --> 03:21:39.359 align:start position:0%
has no reason to have any contact with
 
03:21:41.630 --> 03:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
the alleged victim and that person is
 
03:21:43.790 --> 03:21:43.800 align:start position:0%
released on bail in the case the case
 
03:21:46.610 --> 03:21:46.620 align:start position:0%
goes forward that way so again I do
 
03:21:48.050 --> 03:21:48.060 align:start position:0%
think you have to look at individual
 
03:21:51.349 --> 03:21:51.359 align:start position:0%
circumstances armed robbery is on this
 
03:21:53.570 --> 03:21:53.580 align:start position:0%
list I don't think there are too many
 
03:21:55.370 --> 03:21:55.380 align:start position:0%
bail Commissioners who are going to look
 
03:21:57.110 --> 03:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
at somebody charged with armed robbery
 
03:21:59.389 --> 03:21:59.399 align:start position:0%
with a weapon and who are going to just
 
03:22:02.330 --> 03:22:02.340 align:start position:0%
say hey you know PR bail we'll see you
 
03:22:04.130 --> 03:22:04.140 align:start position:0%
at court I think that type of offense
 
03:22:06.469 --> 03:22:06.479 align:start position:0%
the the system is working that type of
 
03:22:10.309 --> 03:22:10.319 align:start position:0%
person is not going to be given a PR
 
03:22:13.550 --> 03:22:13.560 align:start position:0%
bail as a typical matter I don't think
 
03:22:16.130 --> 03:22:16.140 align:start position:0%
the system is broken I think that even
 
03:22:19.250 --> 03:22:19.260 align:start position:0%
24 to 36 hours in jail can be a very
 
03:22:22.070 --> 03:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
very significant period of time for a
 
03:22:24.110 --> 03:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
person a very significant interruption
 
03:22:26.330 --> 03:22:26.340 align:start position:0%
in their life and as far as the
 
03:22:27.950 --> 03:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
permanent attention goes and being
 
03:22:30.950 --> 03:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
driven by the offense I do agree that
 
03:22:32.809 --> 03:22:32.819 align:start position:0%
courts attempt to give priority to
 
03:22:35.030 --> 03:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
incarcerated cases but if you check with
 
03:22:36.710 --> 03:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
our Superior Courts they're scheduling
 
03:22:38.870 --> 03:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
even incarcerated clients out several
 
03:22:41.269 --> 03:22:41.279 align:start position:0%
months for trial at this point due to
 
03:22:44.450 --> 03:22:44.460 align:start position:0%
the volume of cases that that exist so
 
03:22:47.769 --> 03:22:47.779 align:start position:0%
in some I I don't I understand
 
03:22:50.150 --> 03:22:50.160 align:start position:0%
the very eloquent comments that were
 
03:22:52.550 --> 03:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
made in support of the statute but I
 
03:22:54.469 --> 03:22:54.479 align:start position:0%
respectfully disagree that it's
 
03:22:57.170 --> 03:22:57.180 align:start position:0%
necessary and I'll take any questions if
 
03:23:02.030 --> 03:23:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:03.889 --> 03:23:03.899 align:start position:0%
representative Rhodes thank you Mr
 
03:23:05.570 --> 03:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
chairman I I just want to make sure I
 
03:23:08.030 --> 03:23:08.040 align:start position:0%
I'm understanding this so when Senator
 
03:23:09.769 --> 03:23:09.779 align:start position:0%
Susie testified
 
03:23:13.190 --> 03:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
she made it adamantly clear that
 
03:23:15.469 --> 03:23:15.479 align:start position:0%
that this is affecting
 
03:23:17.630 --> 03:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
the crimes where their victim was a
 
03:23:20.870 --> 03:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
person yes right so you were just saying
 
03:23:22.729 --> 03:23:22.739 align:start position:0%
was about
 
03:23:24.290 --> 03:23:24.300 align:start position:0%
you know the disruption in someone's
 
03:23:25.790 --> 03:23:25.800 align:start position:0%
life because they're they're not being
 
03:23:27.650 --> 03:23:27.660 align:start position:0%
they're in prison I'm sorry that they're
 
03:23:29.630 --> 03:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
being detained for possibly two to three
 
03:23:31.429 --> 03:23:31.439 align:start position:0%
days right
 
03:23:33.469 --> 03:23:33.479 align:start position:0%
but those are crimes
 
03:23:35.990 --> 03:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
that there is a victim much I'm thinking
 
03:23:37.790 --> 03:23:37.800 align:start position:0%
safe to assume that their lives are
 
03:23:39.290 --> 03:23:39.300 align:start position:0%
probably disrupted for more than two to
 
03:23:41.269 --> 03:23:41.279 align:start position:0%
three days so is there a difference from
 
03:23:43.429 --> 03:23:43.439 align:start position:0%
what you're saying than what she was
 
03:23:46.190 --> 03:23:46.200 align:start position:0%
saying I don't think so um I I think
 
03:23:47.870 --> 03:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
that what I'm saying I'm obviously
 
03:23:49.969 --> 03:23:49.979 align:start position:0%
talking about it from a different
 
03:23:51.590 --> 03:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
perspective without question I'm talking
 
03:23:54.050 --> 03:23:54.060 align:start position:0%
about it from the perspective of of the
 
03:23:56.570 --> 03:23:56.580 align:start position:0%
offender I appreciate that these are
 
03:23:58.610 --> 03:23:58.620 align:start position:0%
um what that what these crimes have in
 
03:24:00.410 --> 03:24:00.420 align:start position:0%
common is that they all involve victims
 
03:24:03.170 --> 03:24:03.180 align:start position:0%
they're not they're not property crimes
 
03:24:05.510 --> 03:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
um what I'm saying is you you still have
 
03:24:07.130 --> 03:24:07.140 align:start position:0%
to look at the nature of the offense and
 
03:24:09.229 --> 03:24:09.239 align:start position:0%
the offender I mean a homicide is very
 
03:24:11.990 --> 03:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
different from a domestic violence
 
03:24:13.910 --> 03:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
simple assault or from a domestic
 
03:24:15.710 --> 03:24:15.720 align:start position:0%
violence stalking offense they're just
 
03:24:17.690 --> 03:24:17.700 align:start position:0%
very different offenses they're very
 
03:24:19.729 --> 03:24:19.739 align:start position:0%
different offenders it may well be
 
03:24:22.389 --> 03:24:22.399 align:start position:0%
appropriate to incarcerate somebody
 
03:24:25.370 --> 03:24:25.380 align:start position:0%
on a first offense domestic violence or
 
03:24:27.710 --> 03:24:27.720 align:start position:0%
to hold them for that 24 to 36 hour
 
03:24:30.530 --> 03:24:30.540 align:start position:0%
period but not as a blanket matter I
 
03:24:32.990 --> 03:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
think is all that I'm saying and I think
 
03:24:36.530 --> 03:24:36.540 align:start position:0%
that in the case where a person should
 
03:24:38.809 --> 03:24:38.819 align:start position:0%
be incarcerated in that period there are
 
03:24:41.090 --> 03:24:41.100 align:start position:0%
going to be factors brought to bear
 
03:24:42.830 --> 03:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
brought to the attention of the person
 
03:24:44.809 --> 03:24:44.819 align:start position:0%
that the bail commissioner or the
 
03:24:46.910 --> 03:24:46.920 align:start position:0%
magistrator whomever and that person can
 
03:24:48.710 --> 03:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
make a decision on an individualized
 
03:24:51.590 --> 03:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
basis rather than merely being driven by
 
03:24:56.990 --> 03:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:59.269 --> 03:24:59.279 align:start position:0%
to testimony
 
03:25:01.870 --> 03:25:01.880 align:start position:0%
the court calls Attorney Richard head
 
03:25:04.370 --> 03:25:04.380 align:start position:0%
excuse me the we're talking about court
 
03:25:14.809 --> 03:25:14.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:16.370 --> 03:25:16.380 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman members of
 
03:25:17.690 --> 03:25:17.700 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Richard head
 
03:25:19.729 --> 03:25:19.739 align:start position:0%
I'm the government Affairs coordinator
 
03:25:22.670 --> 03:25:22.680 align:start position:0%
for the judicial branch
 
03:25:24.950 --> 03:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
um somewhat different in this bill than
 
03:25:26.630 --> 03:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
the last bill I do have some data I
 
03:25:28.910 --> 03:25:28.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to share with you regarding the
 
03:25:31.190 --> 03:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
impact of this bill and also a
 
03:25:32.750 --> 03:25:32.760 align:start position:0%
Confluence of a couple of events that's
 
03:25:35.870 --> 03:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
going to occur on January 1st in circuit
 
03:25:38.269 --> 03:25:38.279 align:start position:0%
court so unrelated to this bill but
 
03:25:40.370 --> 03:25:40.380 align:start position:0%
already passed in a previous session of
 
03:25:42.889 --> 03:25:42.899 align:start position:0%
the legislature we have the repeal of
 
03:25:46.090 --> 03:25:46.100 align:start position:0%
felonies first so under current practice
 
03:25:48.910 --> 03:25:48.920 align:start position:0%
felonies are initiated in Superior Court
 
03:25:50.870 --> 03:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors and violations are
 
03:25:53.030 --> 03:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
initiated in Circuit Court
 
03:25:56.510 --> 03:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
come January 1st in that in that process
 
03:25:58.729 --> 03:25:58.739 align:start position:0%
is called felonies first felonies first
 
03:26:00.590 --> 03:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
start in Superior Court and that was
 
03:26:03.530 --> 03:26:03.540 align:start position:0%
implemented in around 2015. in the last
 
03:26:07.370 --> 03:26:07.380 align:start position:0%
session felonies first was repealed so
 
03:26:10.010 --> 03:26:10.020 align:start position:0%
we go back to an older system in which
 
03:26:12.650 --> 03:26:12.660 align:start position:0%
all cases felonies misdemeanors
 
03:26:15.950 --> 03:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
violations will initiate in circuit
 
03:26:19.070 --> 03:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
court so none of those cases virtually
 
03:26:21.349 --> 03:26:21.359 align:start position:0%
none of those cases will initiate in
 
03:26:25.309 --> 03:26:25.319 align:start position:0%
Superior Court so come January 1st our
 
03:26:27.530 --> 03:26:27.540 align:start position:0%
circuit court is going to have an influx
 
03:26:27.540 --> 03:26:28.610 align:start position:0%
circuit court is going to have an influx
of

03:26:28.610 --> 03:26:28.620 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:26:31.190 --> 03:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
felonies that are not currently being
 
03:26:32.870 --> 03:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
absorbed into the system and we have to
 
03:26:35.630 --> 03:26:35.640 align:start position:0%
absorb those into the system and so what
 
03:26:38.929 --> 03:26:38.939 align:start position:0%
that means in terms of of what is
 
03:26:42.170 --> 03:26:42.180 align:start position:0%
circuit court so circuit court is made
 
03:26:44.450 --> 03:26:44.460 align:start position:0%
up of three divisions uh District
 
03:26:46.190 --> 03:26:46.200 align:start position:0%
division where the criminal cases are
 
03:26:48.410 --> 03:26:48.420 align:start position:0%
heard Family Division where you have the
 
03:26:51.590 --> 03:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
family type of of cases and probate
 
03:26:53.210 --> 03:26:53.220 align:start position:0%
division where the where the probate
 
03:26:55.010 --> 03:26:55.020 align:start position:0%
cases are heard all of those are heard
 
03:26:58.849 --> 03:26:58.859 align:start position:0%
in Circuit Court same judges are hearing
 
03:27:00.950 --> 03:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
the same cases in all those divisions we
 
03:27:02.510 --> 03:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
don't we don't separate them out
 
03:27:04.429 --> 03:27:04.439 align:start position:0%
probate's a little bit different
 
03:27:07.250 --> 03:27:07.260 align:start position:0%
So within within Circuit Court we have
 
03:27:10.309 --> 03:27:10.319 align:start position:0%
42 judges and
 
03:27:12.710 --> 03:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
um on top of that we have some part-time
 
03:27:16.550 --> 03:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
judges who are essentially retired
 
03:27:19.010 --> 03:27:19.020 align:start position:0%
and they hear and they receive on an
 
03:27:20.750 --> 03:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
annual basis under the current system
 
03:27:23.030 --> 03:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
about a hundred and twenty seven
 
03:27:25.429 --> 03:27:25.439 align:start position:0%
thousand new cases every year so we have
 
03:27:28.010 --> 03:27:28.020 align:start position:0%
42 plus judges going through that we
 
03:27:30.469 --> 03:27:30.479 align:start position:0%
have court staff processing all of those
 
03:27:34.250 --> 03:27:34.260 align:start position:0%
cases it is a tremendous burden that
 
03:27:36.830 --> 03:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
occurs within the circuit court system
 
03:27:39.830 --> 03:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
come January 1st felonies first will be
 
03:27:41.870 --> 03:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
repealed and we're going to add into
 
03:27:44.809 --> 03:27:44.819 align:start position:0%
that system somewhere around eight to
 
03:27:47.150 --> 03:27:47.160 align:start position:0%
nine thousand new criminal cases that
 
03:27:48.769 --> 03:27:48.779 align:start position:0%
are not currently being absorbed into
 
03:27:51.229 --> 03:27:51.239 align:start position:0%
the circuit court system because they're
 
03:27:53.210 --> 03:27:53.220 align:start position:0%
starting currently in in Superior Court
 
03:27:55.490 --> 03:27:55.500 align:start position:0%
and we're moving those into circuit
 
03:27:58.790 --> 03:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
court so brand new cases not currently
 
03:28:01.490 --> 03:28:01.500 align:start position:0%
in the dockets in the circuit court and
 
03:28:04.010 --> 03:28:04.020 align:start position:0%
those will all now have to get opened by
 
03:28:06.229 --> 03:28:06.239 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court staff they will all have
 
03:28:09.050 --> 03:28:09.060 align:start position:0%
to get heard by Circuit Court judges and
 
03:28:11.570 --> 03:28:11.580 align:start position:0%
those cases that are felonies if they
 
03:28:13.309 --> 03:28:13.319 align:start position:0%
don't plea down to a misdemeanor in
 
03:28:15.490 --> 03:28:15.500 align:start position:0%
circuit court at arraignment
 
03:28:18.710 --> 03:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
or probably probable cause hearing will
 
03:28:21.469 --> 03:28:21.479 align:start position:0%
then get transferred and restart over in
 
03:28:23.929 --> 03:28:23.939 align:start position:0%
Superior Court and that's the the system
 
03:28:26.929 --> 03:28:26.939 align:start position:0%
that you sort of approved last last
 
03:28:26.939 --> 03:28:28.429 align:start position:0%
that you sort of approved last last
session

03:28:28.429 --> 03:28:28.439 align:start position:0%
session
 
03:28:31.070 --> 03:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
what this does so we so that's coming
 
03:28:36.410 --> 03:28:36.420 align:start position:0%
January 1st and is is a process that is
 
03:28:38.330 --> 03:28:38.340 align:start position:0%
taking up a fair amount of Court staff
 
03:28:40.010 --> 03:28:40.020 align:start position:0%
time currently to try to figure out how
 
03:28:41.389 --> 03:28:41.399 align:start position:0%
to how to do it and how to do it
 
03:28:41.399 --> 03:28:42.650 align:start position:0%
to how to do it and how to do it
smoothly

03:28:42.650 --> 03:28:42.660 align:start position:0%
smoothly
 
03:28:45.650 --> 03:28:45.660 align:start position:0%
what this case what this bill adds to
 
03:28:47.870 --> 03:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
that are cases that are not currently
 
03:28:50.450 --> 03:28:50.460 align:start position:0%
being heard as detention hearings
 
03:28:53.630 --> 03:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
detention bail hearings and adds the uh
 
03:28:56.450 --> 03:28:56.460 align:start position:0%
into the load detention bail hearings
 
03:28:59.510 --> 03:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
and we do have some data that suggests
 
03:29:01.670 --> 03:29:01.680 align:start position:0%
about how many we're going to have post
 
03:29:04.490 --> 03:29:04.500 align:start position:0%
felonies first repeal and and it's
 
03:29:05.929 --> 03:29:05.939 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the neighborhood of
 
03:29:09.469 --> 03:29:09.479 align:start position:0%
approximately 3 400 new detention bail
 
03:29:12.469 --> 03:29:12.479 align:start position:0%
hearings that currently are are not
 
03:29:14.630 --> 03:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
coming to the court as a detention bail
 
03:29:17.750 --> 03:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
hearing essentially meaning that a bail
 
03:29:20.809 --> 03:29:20.819 align:start position:0%
commissioner has likely issued a
 
03:29:24.110 --> 03:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
personal recognizance bail
 
03:29:25.429 --> 03:29:25.439 align:start position:0%
um and so the person's not being
 
03:29:26.870 --> 03:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
detained and it's not coming to the
 
03:29:30.170 --> 03:29:30.180 align:start position:0%
court as a detention hearing so those
 
03:29:33.110 --> 03:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
then so for the folks who were at court
 
03:29:35.750 --> 03:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
yesterday in the spirit Court those are
 
03:29:37.250 --> 03:29:37.260 align:start position:0%
the ones that are likely to be heard on
 
03:29:39.650 --> 03:29:39.660 align:start position:0%
that video arraignments that we saw that
 
03:29:42.769 --> 03:29:42.779 align:start position:0%
the judge do at 10 o'clock and and those
 
03:29:45.650 --> 03:29:45.660 align:start position:0%
are likely to be folks who are now in
 
03:29:47.450 --> 03:29:47.460 align:start position:0%
the county jail
 
03:29:50.150 --> 03:29:50.160 align:start position:0%
um who are going to be video arraigned
 
03:29:54.229 --> 03:29:54.239 align:start position:0%
into the court on a daily basis so those
 
03:29:56.269 --> 03:29:56.279 align:start position:0%
that that load just sort of has to get
 
03:29:59.630 --> 03:29:59.640 align:start position:0%
added in so what does that mean and in
 
03:30:02.210 --> 03:30:02.220 align:start position:0%
addition to having absorbed felonies
 
03:30:04.849 --> 03:30:04.859 align:start position:0%
first into the system we now have to
 
03:30:07.190 --> 03:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
absorb these bail hearings and these
 
03:30:09.290 --> 03:30:09.300 align:start position:0%
bail hearings may not be one-offs
 
03:30:12.650 --> 03:30:12.660 align:start position:0%
because if that bail hearing
 
03:30:15.050 --> 03:30:15.060 align:start position:0%
um occurs in the first instance A
 
03:30:17.090 --> 03:30:17.100 align:start position:0%
detention bail hearing and a public
 
03:30:19.070 --> 03:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
defender has not been assigned for those
 
03:30:21.650 --> 03:30:21.660 align:start position:0%
of you who saw yesterday the judge will
 
03:30:23.690 --> 03:30:23.700 align:start position:0%
ask the individual do you want to argue
 
03:30:25.610 --> 03:30:25.620 align:start position:0%
your bail today or do you want to wait
 
03:30:28.670 --> 03:30:28.680 align:start position:0%
until the bail until a a
 
03:30:30.469 --> 03:30:30.479 align:start position:0%
lawyers assigned to you and that might
 
03:30:32.090 --> 03:30:32.100 align:start position:0%
be tomorrow because if you're in
 
03:30:32.100 --> 03:30:33.190 align:start position:0%
be tomorrow because if you're in
detention

03:30:33.190 --> 03:30:33.200 align:start position:0%
detention
 
03:30:37.190 --> 03:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
public defenders do quickly assign a a
 
03:30:39.050 --> 03:30:39.060 align:start position:0%
lawyer to that case if you're not in
 
03:30:41.630 --> 03:30:41.640 align:start position:0%
detention uh and you're charged with a
 
03:30:44.510 --> 03:30:44.520 align:start position:0%
with a crime and you're eligible for for
 
03:30:47.050 --> 03:30:47.060 align:start position:0%
a lawyer it can take
 
03:30:50.210 --> 03:30:50.220 align:start position:0%
180 days sometimes for a lawyer to get
 
03:30:51.950 --> 03:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
appointed and then the process can
 
03:30:53.510 --> 03:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
essentially start if you're detained
 
03:30:55.790 --> 03:30:55.800 align:start position:0%
it's going to happen quickly
 
03:30:55.800 --> 03:30:57.410 align:start position:0%
it's going to happen quickly
um

03:30:57.410 --> 03:30:57.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:30:59.510 --> 03:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
so that might mean okay we've had the
 
03:31:01.849 --> 03:31:01.859 align:start position:0%
the hearing today the individual has
 
03:31:03.349 --> 03:31:03.359 align:start position:0%
decided I don't want to argue bail today
 
03:31:04.910 --> 03:31:04.920 align:start position:0%
I want to wait to my lawyers assigned
 
03:31:06.650 --> 03:31:06.660 align:start position:0%
the lawyer gets assigned lawyer files
 
03:31:08.090 --> 03:31:08.100 align:start position:0%
bail paperwork we gotta have another
 
03:31:11.269 --> 03:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
hearing within 24 hours of that of that
 
03:31:13.250 --> 03:31:13.260 align:start position:0%
paperwork being filed so that's two
 
03:31:15.050 --> 03:31:15.060 align:start position:0%
hearings now that may occur as a result
 
03:31:17.330 --> 03:31:17.340 align:start position:0%
of that detention hearing and then if
 
03:31:20.809 --> 03:31:20.819 align:start position:0%
the decision is uh one that results in
 
03:31:23.330 --> 03:31:23.340 align:start position:0%
further detention by the judge that that
 
03:31:25.190 --> 03:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
bail decision could be appealed so there
 
03:31:27.290 --> 03:31:27.300 align:start position:0%
might be a third a hearing that comes
 
03:31:30.050 --> 03:31:30.060 align:start position:0%
out of that but I'll focus on the one
 
03:31:32.030 --> 03:31:32.040 align:start position:0%
so what we're talking about let's say
 
03:31:34.670 --> 03:31:34.680 align:start position:0%
we're adding 3 400 new hearings
 
03:31:36.710 --> 03:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
detention hearings into the system and
 
03:31:38.330 --> 03:31:38.340 align:start position:0%
let's say each one of those hearings
 
03:31:40.790 --> 03:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
takes six minutes that's probably low
 
03:31:43.309 --> 03:31:43.319 align:start position:0%
but let's let's just say it takes six
 
03:31:43.319 --> 03:31:44.450 align:start position:0%
but let's let's just say it takes six
minutes

03:31:44.450 --> 03:31:44.460 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
03:31:46.490 --> 03:31:46.500 align:start position:0%
if we do that
 
03:31:49.630 --> 03:31:49.640 align:start position:0%
and add up add that over 3 400
 
03:31:53.889 --> 03:31:53.899 align:start position:0%
new hearings that adds what are called
 
03:31:58.010 --> 03:31:58.020 align:start position:0%
uh 46 session days to our schedule and
 
03:31:59.929 --> 03:31:59.939 align:start position:0%
the session day is essentially
 
03:32:02.210 --> 03:32:02.220 align:start position:0%
the seven and a half hours that a judge
 
03:32:05.090 --> 03:32:05.100 align:start position:0%
has in a courtroom available to hear
 
03:32:08.210 --> 03:32:08.220 align:start position:0%
cases so that's one session day we have
 
03:32:11.150 --> 03:32:11.160 align:start position:0%
to add into the system 46 session days
 
03:32:13.250 --> 03:32:13.260 align:start position:0%
just to handle that first round of
 
03:32:16.610 --> 03:32:16.620 align:start position:0%
hearings from detention bail hearings so
 
03:32:18.410 --> 03:32:18.420 align:start position:0%
what does that mean since since you're
 
03:32:20.389 --> 03:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
not a finance group you're a policy
 
03:32:23.510 --> 03:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
group what how does that impact you that
 
03:32:25.190 --> 03:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
means within the system we have to
 
03:32:29.269 --> 03:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
absorb 46 days of time of a judge not
 
03:32:31.309 --> 03:32:31.319 align:start position:0%
doing something else so what is it the
 
03:32:33.410 --> 03:32:33.420 align:start position:0%
judge has discretion to do or not do
 
03:32:37.010 --> 03:32:37.020 align:start position:0%
that can add and absorb 46 days into the
 
03:32:37.020 --> 03:32:38.090 align:start position:0%
that can add and absorb 46 days into the
system

03:32:38.090 --> 03:32:38.100 align:start position:0%
system
 
03:32:41.929 --> 03:32:41.939 align:start position:0%
so there are a number of things that by
 
03:32:44.330 --> 03:32:44.340 align:start position:0%
Statute we have to do within a certain
 
03:32:47.630 --> 03:32:47.640 align:start position:0%
period of time so landlord tenant has a
 
03:32:49.250 --> 03:32:49.260 align:start position:0%
10-day deadline you got to have a
 
03:32:49.260 --> 03:32:50.170 align:start position:0%
10-day deadline you got to have a
hearing

03:32:50.170 --> 03:32:50.180 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
03:32:53.450 --> 03:32:53.460 align:start position:0%
juvenile cases have statutory hearings
 
03:32:55.849 --> 03:32:55.859 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect cases have statutory
 
03:32:58.550 --> 03:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
hearings and deadlines so there's a
 
03:33:00.769 --> 03:33:00.779 align:start position:0%
number of things that have statutory
 
03:33:02.690 --> 03:33:02.700 align:start position:0%
deadlines we've got to hear these cases
 
03:33:04.130 --> 03:33:04.140 align:start position:0%
and we got to hear them within a certain
 
03:33:05.450 --> 03:33:05.460 align:start position:0%
period of time
 
03:33:08.269 --> 03:33:08.279 align:start position:0%
if we add up the total number of Judges
 
03:33:10.849 --> 03:33:10.859 align:start position:0%
we have currently 42 plus the part-time
 
03:33:13.849 --> 03:33:13.859 align:start position:0%
judges that are that are retired we have
 
03:33:15.710 --> 03:33:15.720 align:start position:0%
a total number of session days available
 
03:33:17.570 --> 03:33:17.580 align:start position:0%
to us so the number of seven and a half
 
03:33:19.969 --> 03:33:19.979 align:start position:0%
hour days that these total that these
 
03:33:22.790 --> 03:33:22.800 align:start position:0%
judges can sit in front of a uh in a
 
03:33:25.550 --> 03:33:25.560 align:start position:0%
courtroom in total is about 16 000
 
03:33:28.670 --> 03:33:28.680 align:start position:0%
session days so we can cover 16 000
 
03:33:31.130 --> 03:33:31.140 align:start position:0%
session days with our judges to hear all
 
03:33:32.269 --> 03:33:32.279 align:start position:0%
the cases
 
03:33:35.210 --> 03:33:35.220 align:start position:0%
of those sixteen thousand about five
 
03:33:37.130 --> 03:33:37.140 align:start position:0%
thousand five thousand of them are
 
03:33:38.990 --> 03:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
locked into those things that have
 
03:33:41.690 --> 03:33:41.700 align:start position:0%
statutory deadlines so we just have to
 
03:33:44.090 --> 03:33:44.100 align:start position:0%
get those things done so that's about
 
03:33:45.889 --> 03:33:45.899 align:start position:0%
five thousand that five thousand does
 
03:33:48.410 --> 03:33:48.420 align:start position:0%
not include the criminal cases that's
 
03:33:51.229 --> 03:33:51.239 align:start position:0%
about another three thousand uh session
 
03:33:52.969 --> 03:33:52.979 align:start position:0%
days so net or thirty five hundred
 
03:33:52.979 --> 03:33:53.809 align:start position:0%
days so net or thirty five hundred
actually

03:33:53.809 --> 03:33:53.819 align:start position:0%
actually
 
03:33:56.269 --> 03:33:56.279 align:start position:0%
so now if we add all the things with
 
03:33:58.490 --> 03:33:58.500 align:start position:0%
statutory deadlines in our criminal
 
03:33:58.500 --> 03:33:59.630 align:start position:0%
statutory deadlines in our criminal
cases

03:33:59.630 --> 03:33:59.640 align:start position:0%
cases
 
03:34:02.510 --> 03:34:02.520 align:start position:0%
of the of the 16 000 session days
 
03:34:05.809 --> 03:34:05.819 align:start position:0%
available we've consumed about 8 500 of
 
03:34:05.819 --> 03:34:06.590 align:start position:0%
available we've consumed about 8 500 of
them

03:34:06.590 --> 03:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:34:09.170 --> 03:34:09.180 align:start position:0%
and so what that means is those things
 
03:34:11.450 --> 03:34:11.460 align:start position:0%
that have discretionary deadlines we
 
03:34:13.670 --> 03:34:13.680 align:start position:0%
don't have to do a statute that's not
 
03:34:16.250 --> 03:34:16.260 align:start position:0%
Constitution that says we have to do it
 
03:34:18.110 --> 03:34:18.120 align:start position:0%
those are getting pushed and the reality
 
03:34:19.969 --> 03:34:19.979 align:start position:0%
is those are getting pushed so what type
 
03:34:22.250 --> 03:34:22.260 align:start position:0%
of cases are we talking about civil
 
03:34:24.170 --> 03:34:24.180 align:start position:0%
cases your small claims cases are
 
03:34:25.729 --> 03:34:25.739 align:start position:0%
getting reached
 
03:34:28.070 --> 03:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
much later than we would like them to
 
03:34:30.050 --> 03:34:30.060 align:start position:0%
but that's because we're doing all these
 
03:34:33.050 --> 03:34:33.060 align:start position:0%
other things so civil cases get pushed
 
03:34:35.929 --> 03:34:35.939 align:start position:0%
uh divorce cases don't have deadlines
 
03:34:38.150 --> 03:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
those get pushed and I spend a lot of
 
03:34:39.889 --> 03:34:39.899 align:start position:0%
time in in the children and family law
 
03:34:41.809 --> 03:34:41.819 align:start position:0%
committee and I hear a lot of complaints
 
03:34:43.250 --> 03:34:43.260 align:start position:0%
about that our cases aren't getting
 
03:34:43.260 --> 03:34:44.870 align:start position:0%
about that our cases aren't getting
reached

03:34:44.870 --> 03:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
reached
 
03:34:44.880 --> 03:34:45.790 align:start position:0%
reached
um

03:34:45.790 --> 03:34:45.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:49.190 --> 03:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
uh some you know some there so there's
 
03:34:51.410 --> 03:34:51.420 align:start position:0%
some Equity cases some trust cases you
 
03:34:53.030 --> 03:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
know the things that don't have a
 
03:34:55.309 --> 03:34:55.319 align:start position:0%
deadline just naturally because you're
 
03:34:57.830 --> 03:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
pushing only so much into a system they
 
03:35:00.170 --> 03:35:00.180 align:start position:0%
get pushed later and you hear about
 
03:35:02.330 --> 03:35:02.340 align:start position:0%
those things so it's you know it becomes
 
03:35:04.010 --> 03:35:04.020 align:start position:0%
a very intensive
 
03:35:07.250 --> 03:35:07.260 align:start position:0%
resource issue and and in these numbers
 
03:35:10.250 --> 03:35:10.260 align:start position:0%
I'm only talking about Judges so far
 
03:35:12.530 --> 03:35:12.540 align:start position:0%
on top of that within our Clerk's
 
03:35:15.050 --> 03:35:15.060 align:start position:0%
offices they
 
03:35:17.330 --> 03:35:17.340 align:start position:0%
because of felonies first repeal have to
 
03:35:19.849 --> 03:35:19.859 align:start position:0%
absorb another eight nine thousand cases
 
03:35:23.030 --> 03:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
into what they do in the work that they
 
03:35:25.550 --> 03:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
do and if I took just to open a case
 
03:35:27.889 --> 03:35:27.899 align:start position:0%
let's say it's a half an hour to open a
 
03:35:27.899 --> 03:35:28.729 align:start position:0%
let's say it's a half an hour to open a
case

03:35:28.729 --> 03:35:28.739 align:start position:0%
case
 
03:35:31.429 --> 03:35:31.439 align:start position:0%
for for
 
03:35:33.590 --> 03:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
um for these types of cases that we're
 
03:35:35.809 --> 03:35:35.819 align:start position:0%
talking about in this bill separating
 
03:35:38.750 --> 03:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
out felonies first we have to absorb
 
03:35:42.170 --> 03:35:42.180 align:start position:0%
about another 226 days worth of work by
 
03:35:46.610 --> 03:35:46.620 align:start position:0%
by Court staff in order to process the
 
03:35:49.070 --> 03:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
additional materials if you assume each
 
03:35:51.110 --> 03:35:51.120 align:start position:0%
one and bail Commissioners know the
 
03:35:52.969 --> 03:35:52.979 align:start position:0%
paperwork alone for these things takes a
 
03:35:52.979 --> 03:35:53.650 align:start position:0%
paperwork alone for these things takes a
while

03:35:53.650 --> 03:35:53.660 align:start position:0%
while
 
03:35:56.570 --> 03:35:56.580 align:start position:0%
in getting it processed so we have to
 
03:36:00.110 --> 03:36:00.120 align:start position:0%
absorb that into the system and what we
 
03:36:03.889 --> 03:36:03.899 align:start position:0%
also know is that based upon a study
 
03:36:06.469 --> 03:36:06.479 align:start position:0%
that was conducted on our system last
 
03:36:08.090 --> 03:36:08.100 align:start position:0%
year from the national Center of state
 
03:36:08.100 --> 03:36:09.170 align:start position:0%
year from the national Center of state
courts

03:36:09.170 --> 03:36:09.180 align:start position:0%
courts
 
03:36:11.630 --> 03:36:11.640 align:start position:0%
that we currently are short if we don't
 
03:36:13.610 --> 03:36:13.620 align:start position:0%
add felonies first into it if we don't
 
03:36:16.370 --> 03:36:16.380 align:start position:0%
add bail reform into it in Circuit Court
 
03:36:19.250 --> 03:36:19.260 align:start position:0%
we're short about 17 judges and we're
 
03:36:22.790 --> 03:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
sure about 31 30 30 plus in terms of
 
03:36:22.800 --> 03:36:23.870 align:start position:0%
sure about 31 30 30 plus in terms of
staff

03:36:23.870 --> 03:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
staff
 
03:36:25.910 --> 03:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
and we have in the in our budget this
 
03:36:28.370 --> 03:36:28.380 align:start position:0%
year the chief justice has has asked for
 
03:36:30.229 --> 03:36:30.239 align:start position:0%
significant resources and we ask for
 
03:36:32.809 --> 03:36:32.819 align:start position:0%
support of that in the sense of of the
 
03:36:35.269 --> 03:36:35.279 align:start position:0%
17 judges that are suggested he's asked
 
03:36:38.090 --> 03:36:38.100 align:start position:0%
for seven of the Court staff he's asked
 
03:36:41.570 --> 03:36:41.580 align:start position:0%
for 31 but he has not factored into you
 
03:36:43.010 --> 03:36:43.020 align:start position:0%
know the additional workload that would
 
03:36:46.010 --> 03:36:46.020 align:start position:0%
be added by new legislation
 
03:36:49.550 --> 03:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
um so I I think in terms of of the
 
03:36:51.950 --> 03:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
impacts and we don't have any view on
 
03:36:53.809 --> 03:36:53.819 align:start position:0%
the policy we look at how does this
 
03:36:56.030 --> 03:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
impact Court operations and the only
 
03:36:58.010 --> 03:36:58.020 align:start position:0%
purpose of my testimony is to give you
 
03:37:00.469 --> 03:37:00.479 align:start position:0%
that insight as you are deliberating on
 
03:37:04.190 --> 03:37:04.200 align:start position:0%
the policy uh goals of this bill is that
 
03:37:07.010 --> 03:37:07.020 align:start position:0%
they will have impacts within the court
 
03:37:09.530 --> 03:37:09.540 align:start position:0%
system there's only so much that the
 
03:37:12.650 --> 03:37:12.660 align:start position:0%
system can absorb and as we take on more
 
03:37:15.590 --> 03:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
it just means stuff gets pushed you know
 
03:37:17.450 --> 03:37:17.460 align:start position:0%
we hear complaints in a perfectly
 
03:37:20.330 --> 03:37:20.340 align:start position:0%
legitimate issues that a Cornish issues
 
03:37:22.670 --> 03:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
an order that doesn't get mailed out for
 
03:37:24.769 --> 03:37:24.779 align:start position:0%
two or three weeks sometimes because
 
03:37:27.469 --> 03:37:27.479 align:start position:0%
that Court staff is doing 20 other
 
03:37:29.389 --> 03:37:29.399 align:start position:0%
things before they can get to the
 
03:37:31.790 --> 03:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
mailing of that order and that's just a
 
03:37:33.889 --> 03:37:33.899 align:start position:0%
reality of the work within the circuit
 
03:37:37.670 --> 03:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
court so anytime we're adding loads into
 
03:37:40.090 --> 03:37:40.100 align:start position:0%
the circuit court system we are we're
 
03:37:42.650 --> 03:37:42.660 align:start position:0%
stressing what is a system that already
 
03:37:46.070 --> 03:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
has a fairly high level of stress
 
03:37:46.080 --> 03:37:46.670 align:start position:0%
has a fairly high level of stress
um

03:37:46.670 --> 03:37:46.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:48.710 --> 03:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
but again I do want to emphasize we have
 
03:37:50.750 --> 03:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely no position on the policy
 
03:37:52.490 --> 03:37:52.500 align:start position:0%
goals of this if this is the the
 
03:37:54.950 --> 03:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
direction that that the legislature
 
03:37:57.769 --> 03:37:57.779 align:start position:0%
wants to take we have no view on that it
 
03:37:59.150 --> 03:37:59.160 align:start position:0%
is simply
 
03:38:01.490 --> 03:38:01.500 align:start position:0%
um the need then to accommodate the the
 
03:38:04.010 --> 03:38:04.020 align:start position:0%
resources and also the understanding of
 
03:38:06.830 --> 03:38:06.840 align:start position:0%
what that results in in terms of impact
 
03:38:09.710 --> 03:38:09.720 align:start position:0%
on cases that are not criminal that are
 
03:38:11.809 --> 03:38:11.819 align:start position:0%
not statutory deadlines and the effect
 
03:38:14.090 --> 03:38:14.100 align:start position:0%
that it has but that I would conclude my
 
03:38:15.650 --> 03:38:15.660 align:start position:0%
comments but I'd be happy to answer any
 
03:38:17.389 --> 03:38:17.399 align:start position:0%
questions thank you
 
03:38:21.769 --> 03:38:21.779 align:start position:0%
thank you um if we were to take for
 
03:38:23.510 --> 03:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
example the the magistrate system
 
03:38:25.729 --> 03:38:25.739 align:start position:0%
contemplated in the study committee by
 
03:38:28.790 --> 03:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
representative Eric Wright's bill with
 
03:38:28.800 --> 03:38:29.690 align:start position:0%
representative Eric Wright's bill with
that

03:38:29.690 --> 03:38:29.700 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:38:31.190 --> 03:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
um would that alleviate some of the
 
03:38:33.290 --> 03:38:33.300 align:start position:0%
stress in in the system
 
03:38:34.490 --> 03:38:34.500 align:start position:0%
um so thank you for the question yes
 
03:38:34.500 --> 03:38:35.929 align:start position:0%
um so thank you for the question yes
absolutely

03:38:35.929 --> 03:38:35.939 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
03:38:38.450 --> 03:38:38.460 align:start position:0%
um it would well we would see the the
 
03:38:40.550 --> 03:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
responsibility of someone along the
 
03:38:42.889 --> 03:38:42.899 align:start position:0%
lines of a magistrate would be to do a
 
03:38:46.070 --> 03:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
lot within as employees of the system
 
03:38:49.490 --> 03:38:49.500 align:start position:0%
trained within the system and hopefully
 
03:38:52.070 --> 03:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
a smaller number so that we can get some
 
03:38:55.429 --> 03:38:55.439 align:start position:0%
consistency within that group they would
 
03:38:57.290 --> 03:38:57.300 align:start position:0%
handle a lot of the paperwork that would
 
03:39:01.429 --> 03:39:01.439 align:start position:0%
be done by a clerk's office and would be
 
03:39:03.229 --> 03:39:03.239 align:start position:0%
making the decision that a judge would
 
03:39:05.990 --> 03:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
currently be making so it does offload
 
03:39:07.849 --> 03:39:07.859 align:start position:0%
some of that the the stress is there it
 
03:39:10.670 --> 03:39:10.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't eliminate all of the the sort of
 
03:39:12.110 --> 03:39:12.120 align:start position:0%
work within the clerk's office so
 
03:39:14.210 --> 03:39:14.220 align:start position:0%
there's still no matter what going to be
 
03:39:15.830 --> 03:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
an increased burden within the clerk's
 
03:39:15.840 --> 03:39:17.450 align:start position:0%
an increased burden within the clerk's
offices

03:39:17.450 --> 03:39:17.460 align:start position:0%
offices
 
03:39:19.910 --> 03:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
um but that would alleviate sort of the
 
03:39:21.710 --> 03:39:21.720 align:start position:0%
in court time that we're talking about
 
03:39:24.590 --> 03:39:24.600 align:start position:0%
at least in the first hearing role
 
03:39:27.590 --> 03:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
um as you know the the you get the
 
03:39:30.050 --> 03:39:30.060 align:start position:0%
issues of of
 
03:39:33.530 --> 03:39:33.540 align:start position:0%
um waiting for the appointment of of a
 
03:39:36.790 --> 03:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
public defender or second or third
 
03:39:39.050 --> 03:39:39.060 align:start position:0%
attempts at the at the bail decision
 
03:39:41.809 --> 03:39:41.819 align:start position:0%
those would be less those would still
 
03:39:43.490 --> 03:39:43.500 align:start position:0%
impact the courts in the same way but in
 
03:39:45.530 --> 03:39:45.540 align:start position:0%
the first round that would definitely
 
03:39:48.290 --> 03:39:48.300 align:start position:0%
have a positive impact in terms of
 
03:39:50.269 --> 03:39:50.279 align:start position:0%
helping resource needs
 
03:39:53.870 --> 03:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
so in in the opinion of the Court uh
 
03:39:58.729 --> 03:39:58.739 align:start position:0%
via your opinion would um would passing
 
03:40:00.769 --> 03:40:00.779 align:start position:0%
for example the current bill we're
 
03:40:03.769 --> 03:40:03.779 align:start position:0%
discussing at the same time as we began
 
03:40:05.570 --> 03:40:05.580 align:start position:0%
that that process of that study
 
03:40:07.190 --> 03:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
commission for that would that be a wise
 
03:40:07.200 --> 03:40:08.330 align:start position:0%
commission for that would that be a wise
decision

03:40:08.330 --> 03:40:08.340 align:start position:0%
decision
 
03:40:09.469 --> 03:40:09.479 align:start position:0%
um so thank you for the question I think
 
03:40:11.510 --> 03:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
I think it'd be an excellent idea
 
03:40:14.269 --> 03:40:14.279 align:start position:0%
um it you know one we don't want to be
 
03:40:14.279 --> 03:40:16.010 align:start position:0%
um it you know one we don't want to be
implementing

03:40:16.010 --> 03:40:16.020 align:start position:0%
implementing
 
03:40:19.130 --> 03:40:19.140 align:start position:0%
um that process today because I think we
 
03:40:20.750 --> 03:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
might have some some people break down
 
03:40:22.910 --> 03:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
if we had it if we did that yeah
 
03:40:25.429 --> 03:40:25.439 align:start position:0%
but it is a system I think has
 
03:40:29.210 --> 03:40:29.220 align:start position:0%
substantial Merit and if we can identify
 
03:40:31.849 --> 03:40:31.859 align:start position:0%
through a legislative process the best
 
03:40:33.650 --> 03:40:33.660 align:start position:0%
way to implement that in conjunction
 
03:40:37.250 --> 03:40:37.260 align:start position:0%
with bail commissioner roles and and
 
03:40:39.469 --> 03:40:39.479 align:start position:0%
just how we would um how we would bring
 
03:40:41.870 --> 03:40:41.880 align:start position:0%
that into fruition and also you know how
 
03:40:43.550 --> 03:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
would we start to to accommodate
 
03:40:45.410 --> 03:40:45.420 align:start position:0%
electronic bail which we do not
 
03:40:47.269 --> 03:40:47.279 align:start position:0%
currently do
 
03:40:49.969 --> 03:40:49.979 align:start position:0%
um and and some other benefits I think
 
03:40:53.570 --> 03:40:53.580 align:start position:0%
if we can study the the use of bail
 
03:40:55.670 --> 03:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and the use of a new
 
03:40:57.590 --> 03:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
system of magistrates at the same time
 
03:40:59.630 --> 03:40:59.640 align:start position:0%
we're implementing this type of
 
03:41:01.969 --> 03:41:01.979 align:start position:0%
legislation I think that would be a an
 
03:41:04.070 --> 03:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
excellent combination
 
03:41:05.990 --> 03:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions from the
 
03:41:06.000 --> 03:41:07.309 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions from the
committee

03:41:07.309 --> 03:41:07.319 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:41:10.969 --> 03:41:10.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:12.290 --> 03:41:12.300 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:41:14.450 --> 03:41:14.460 align:start position:0%
um my question has to do with the the
 
03:41:16.849 --> 03:41:16.859 align:start position:0%
limitations that are in this bill the 20
 
03:41:18.950 --> 03:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
the 24 hours
 
03:41:21.469 --> 03:41:21.479 align:start position:0%
but they all exclude holidays and and
 
03:41:21.479 --> 03:41:23.510 align:start position:0%
but they all exclude holidays and and
weekends

03:41:23.510 --> 03:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
weekends
 
03:41:26.090 --> 03:41:26.100 align:start position:0%
and additionally it also has language in
 
03:41:27.830 --> 03:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
there between if you're arrested between
 
03:41:30.950 --> 03:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
8 A.M and 1 pm and the person's attorney
 
03:41:33.050 --> 03:41:33.060 align:start position:0%
is not available which would probably be
 
03:41:35.929 --> 03:41:35.939 align:start position:0%
the case with public attorney
 
03:41:38.990 --> 03:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
um and it also has that 36 hours and
 
03:41:41.090 --> 03:41:41.100 align:start position:0%
then it says not including Saturdays and
 
03:41:43.190 --> 03:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
holidays so it seems like
 
03:41:45.650 --> 03:41:45.660 align:start position:0%
the elimination of this of the
 
03:41:48.050 --> 03:41:48.060 align:start position:0%
discretion being taken away from the
 
03:41:50.929 --> 03:41:50.939 align:start position:0%
judges and the bail Commissioners may
 
03:41:53.510 --> 03:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
have an even greater impact if this bill
 
03:41:56.690 --> 03:41:56.700 align:start position:0%
is passed then probably the statistics
 
03:41:59.030 --> 03:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
you just mentioned or did it include
 
03:42:02.269 --> 03:42:02.279 align:start position:0%
that in your analysis
 
03:42:03.950 --> 03:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
um so thank you for the question I have
 
03:42:05.630 --> 03:42:05.640 align:start position:0%
two parts I think to my answer one is
 
03:42:05.640 --> 03:42:06.889 align:start position:0%
two parts I think to my answer one is
the

03:42:06.889 --> 03:42:06.899 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:42:09.410 --> 03:42:09.420 align:start position:0%
um for folks who are so detention
 
03:42:11.690 --> 03:42:11.700 align:start position:0%
hearings happen currently and these
 
03:42:14.090 --> 03:42:14.100 align:start position:0%
rules apply to to those folks
 
03:42:16.790 --> 03:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
um so the uh so the Saturday Sundays
 
03:42:19.969 --> 03:42:19.979 align:start position:0%
holidays in the eight to one thing Are
 
03:42:22.849 --> 03:42:22.859 align:start position:0%
all uh exist under the current system of
 
03:42:25.130 --> 03:42:25.140 align:start position:0%
detention hearings which we have
 
03:42:27.650 --> 03:42:27.660 align:start position:0%
in terms of the impact on the courts
 
03:42:30.290 --> 03:42:30.300 align:start position:0%
What in in every one of our circuit
 
03:42:33.950 --> 03:42:33.960 align:start position:0%
courts Monday mornings are a huge bail
 
03:42:36.170 --> 03:42:36.180 align:start position:0%
day I mean that's all they can do and
 
03:42:39.950 --> 03:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
that's what they do in this you know
 
03:42:42.650 --> 03:42:42.660 align:start position:0%
adds to what is going to happen on a
 
03:42:45.050 --> 03:42:45.060 align:start position:0%
Monday bail hearing day
 
03:42:48.050 --> 03:42:48.060 align:start position:0%
um so the the the burden on this was
 
03:42:50.630 --> 03:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
really focused not so much on the totals
 
03:42:52.309 --> 03:42:52.319 align:start position:0%
that I gave because those totals are the
 
03:42:55.190 --> 03:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
same it affects the distribution so that
 
03:42:57.530 --> 03:42:57.540 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about is is Monday
 
03:42:59.090 --> 03:42:59.100 align:start position:0%
morning is going to be Monday morning
 
03:43:00.849 --> 03:43:00.859 align:start position:0%
Monday afternoon
 
03:43:03.889 --> 03:43:03.899 align:start position:0%
and sort of balancing one of the other
 
03:43:06.710 --> 03:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
aspects of of what the clerk has to do
 
03:43:09.110 --> 03:43:09.120 align:start position:0%
is and what the counties have to do
 
03:43:11.090 --> 03:43:11.100 align:start position:0%
because these are all people that will
 
03:43:14.210 --> 03:43:14.220 align:start position:0%
be incarcerated in a County Jail is
 
03:43:17.150 --> 03:43:17.160 align:start position:0%
coordinating the individual so that a
 
03:43:18.830 --> 03:43:18.840 align:start position:0%
particular time they're sitting in front
 
03:43:22.670 --> 03:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
of the camera that is set up in uh
 
03:43:24.469 --> 03:43:24.479 align:start position:0%
Concord circuit court so that the
 
03:43:26.210 --> 03:43:26.220 align:start position:0%
judging Concord circuit court is seeing
 
03:43:28.729 --> 03:43:28.739 align:start position:0%
the person who is who is in Merrimack
 
03:43:30.889 --> 03:43:30.899 align:start position:0%
County Jail at the same time at the
 
03:43:32.929 --> 03:43:32.939 align:start position:0%
right time so that we have this process
 
03:43:34.750 --> 03:43:34.760 align:start position:0%
in the in the clerk's office is
 
03:43:38.030 --> 03:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
coordinate that with the county jails
 
03:43:39.950 --> 03:43:39.960 align:start position:0%
and that in and of itself is just a
 
03:43:43.250 --> 03:43:43.260 align:start position:0%
process and in part what we just don't
 
03:43:46.010 --> 03:43:46.020 align:start position:0%
know is
 
03:43:49.729 --> 03:43:49.739 align:start position:0%
what is the maximum number of video
 
03:43:52.550 --> 03:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
hearings that we can have in one day
 
03:43:55.370 --> 03:43:55.380 align:start position:0%
because within the county system they
 
03:43:58.130 --> 03:43:58.140 align:start position:0%
typically have one camera available in
 
03:44:00.110 --> 03:44:00.120 align:start position:0%
in one room available for their video
 
03:44:03.290 --> 03:44:03.300 align:start position:0%
arraignments and once that maxes out so
 
03:44:05.150 --> 03:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
once you've hit capacity of that system
 
03:44:07.010 --> 03:44:07.020 align:start position:0%
and people have to be arraigned on a
 
03:44:09.769 --> 03:44:09.779 align:start position:0%
particular day that's going to result in
 
03:44:11.809 --> 03:44:11.819 align:start position:0%
more transports from the county to the
 
03:44:14.809 --> 03:44:14.819 align:start position:0%
courthouse so the so then we have the
 
03:44:16.849 --> 03:44:16.859 align:start position:0%
coordination of the sheriff's offices to
 
03:44:18.530 --> 03:44:18.540 align:start position:0%
transport an individual from the county
 
03:44:22.490 --> 03:44:22.500 align:start position:0%
jail to the courthouse and
 
03:44:24.790 --> 03:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
possibly back to the county jail
 
03:44:28.070 --> 03:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
so there's there's a great deal of
 
03:44:30.410 --> 03:44:30.420 align:start position:0%
coordination that has to happen both in
 
03:44:34.010 --> 03:44:34.020 align:start position:0%
terms of video and in transport that all
 
03:44:36.110 --> 03:44:36.120 align:start position:0%
has to happen in a very short window of
 
03:44:38.809 --> 03:44:38.819 align:start position:0%
time in terms of the coordination and
 
03:44:40.729 --> 03:44:40.739 align:start position:0%
even knowing sort of who's going to
 
03:44:43.370 --> 03:44:43.380 align:start position:0%
who's subject to these things so there's
 
03:44:46.070 --> 03:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
a great deal of work but it What What In
 
03:44:47.990 --> 03:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
terms of what you highlighted that sort
 
03:44:49.910 --> 03:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
of focus is a great deal of attention on
 
03:44:52.969 --> 03:44:52.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:56.450 --> 03:44:56.460 align:start position:0%
thank you for answer follow-up
 
03:44:58.729 --> 03:44:58.739 align:start position:0%
so I guess I just want to get to the
 
03:45:01.969 --> 03:45:01.979 align:start position:0%
basic question does the does the loss of
 
03:45:03.950 --> 03:45:03.960 align:start position:0%
discretion without having bail
 
03:45:05.870 --> 03:45:05.880 align:start position:0%
commission is available
 
03:45:08.269 --> 03:45:08.279 align:start position:0%
make the situation with felonies first
 
03:45:09.950 --> 03:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
on the Circuit Court
 
03:45:13.370 --> 03:45:13.380 align:start position:0%
more better or or worse
 
03:45:15.290 --> 03:45:15.300 align:start position:0%
because that discretion is not there so
 
03:45:17.690 --> 03:45:17.700 align:start position:0%
what it does is is it adds what I said
 
03:45:20.030 --> 03:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
at the beginning which is about 3 500
 
03:45:24.290 --> 03:45:24.300 align:start position:0%
new hearings so that's 3500 events where
 
03:45:26.750 --> 03:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
today a bail commissioner might be
 
03:45:30.229 --> 03:45:30.239 align:start position:0%
handling that that under this bill would
 
03:45:33.290 --> 03:45:33.300 align:start position:0%
bypass bail Commissioners and have that
 
03:45:35.330 --> 03:45:35.340 align:start position:0%
person appear in front of a judge so
 
03:45:37.630 --> 03:45:37.640 align:start position:0%
it's about 3 500 cases
 
03:45:40.969 --> 03:45:40.979 align:start position:0%
annually that currently based on sort of
 
03:45:43.729 --> 03:45:43.739 align:start position:0%
past or past numbers
 
03:45:43.739 --> 03:45:44.630 align:start position:0%
past or past numbers
um

03:45:44.630 --> 03:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:45:46.969 --> 03:45:46.979 align:start position:0%
would now result in a detention hearing
 
03:45:48.889 --> 03:45:48.899 align:start position:0%
before a circuit court judge that
 
03:45:50.630 --> 03:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
currently doesn't have that detention
 
03:45:56.030 --> 03:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:58.490 --> 03:45:58.500 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
03:46:00.229 --> 03:46:00.239 align:start position:0%
anyone else wishing to testify on this
 
03:46:02.150 --> 03:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
bill was not testified in this bill
 
03:46:04.010 --> 03:46:04.020 align:start position:0%

yeah we are we're going to exec a few of
 
04:39:22.070 --> 04:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:23.869 --> 04:39:23.879 align:start position:0%
good afternoon at this point we are
 
04:39:26.449 --> 04:39:26.459 align:start position:0%

04:39:34.369 --> 04:39:34.379 align:start position:0%
representative janvarin for a motion
 
04:39:36.769 --> 04:39:36.779 align:start position:0%
chairman I move ought to pass on Senate
 
04:39:41.990 --> 04:39:42.000 align:start position:0%

04:39:44.630 --> 04:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:39:48.110 --> 04:39:48.120 align:start position:0%
uh it's quite obvious that the judicial
 
04:39:50.090 --> 04:39:50.100 align:start position:0%
branch needs this type of training
 
04:39:51.830 --> 04:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
available and the police station
 
04:39:54.410 --> 04:39:54.420 align:start position:0%
training is willing to do so so if the
 
04:39:56.570 --> 04:39:56.580 align:start position:0%
Bills should pass and allow them to work
 
04:39:59.208 --> 04:39:59.218 align:start position:0%

course of action to get the address
 
04:40:10.150 --> 04:40:10.160 align:start position:0%

commitment to everyone that we're going

04:43:37.910 --> 04:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:43:41.270 --> 04:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
politics being what it is we need to
 
04:43:43.010 --> 04:43:43.020 align:start position:0%
come up with something this year
 
04:43:45.910 --> 04:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
and I am going to work with
 
04:43:47.990 --> 04:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
representative here at gathright to come
 
04:43:50.030 --> 04:43:50.040 align:start position:0%
up with a good piece of legislation
 
04:43:52.490 --> 04:43:52.500 align:start position:0%
based on a couple of them that are in
 
04:43:54.350 --> 04:43:54.360 align:start position:0%
front of us and one of those is not
 
04:43:57.050 --> 04:43:57.060 align:start position:0%
representative Senator abbas's Bill so
 
04:43:59.030 --> 04:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
we are going to retain that like we did
 
04:44:00.350 --> 04:44:00.360 align:start position:0%
all the other ones
 
04:44:02.628 --> 04:44:02.638 align:start position:0%
and we're going to continue to work over
 
04:44:04.550 --> 04:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
this weekend and come up with something
 
04:44:07.150 --> 04:44:07.160 align:start position:0%
that I hope we can all support
 
04:44:10.430 --> 04:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
so having said that with regard to this
 
04:44:10.440 --> 04:44:11.690 align:start position:0%
so having said that with regard to this
bill

04:44:11.690 --> 04:44:11.700 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:44:11.700 --> 04:44:12.890 align:start position:0%
bill
um

04:44:12.890 --> 04:44:12.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:16.070 --> 04:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that the support is
 
04:44:18.650 --> 04:44:18.660 align:start position:0%
there for it regardless of how any of us
 
04:44:20.270 --> 04:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
may feel
 
04:44:21.948 --> 04:44:21.958 align:start position:0%
um I think it's best to hold off let's
 
04:44:23.930 --> 04:44:23.940 align:start position:0%
retain it with the other ones and see
 
04:44:25.368 --> 04:44:25.378 align:start position:0%
what we can come up with in the meantime
 
04:44:27.350 --> 04:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
that we can get to the floor that will
 
04:44:29.270 --> 04:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
pass the whole body and that we know
 
04:44:30.910 --> 04:44:30.920 align:start position:0%
will pass the Senate
 
04:44:32.750 --> 04:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your second
 
04:44:37.070 --> 04:44:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:39.230 --> 04:44:39.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:44:41.868 --> 04:44:41.878 align:start position:0%
um as stated we've had a lot of
 
04:44:43.490 --> 04:44:43.500 align:start position:0%
conversations about all the bills that
 
04:44:45.948 --> 04:44:45.958 align:start position:0%
we've had that related to bail or bail
 
04:44:45.958 --> 04:44:47.510 align:start position:0%
we've had that related to bail or bail
reform

04:44:47.510 --> 04:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
reform
 
04:44:49.310 --> 04:44:49.320 align:start position:0%
um and for the most part the committee
 
04:44:53.208 --> 04:44:53.218 align:start position:0%
has agreed that we would save one for a
 
04:44:55.010 --> 04:44:55.020 align:start position:0%
committee so that we could kind of take
 
04:44:57.890 --> 04:44:57.900 align:start position:0%
really do a deep dive in so
 
04:45:00.970 --> 04:45:00.980 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to ask everyone to
 
04:45:05.690 --> 04:45:05.700 align:start position:0%
vote yay on this particular Bill and see
 
04:45:10.250 --> 04:45:10.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:13.670 --> 04:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
and I would just add that it has not
 
04:45:16.128 --> 04:45:16.138 align:start position:0%
been easy retaining all these bills as
 
04:45:17.990 --> 04:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
I'm sure some of you know there's been
 
04:45:19.610 --> 04:45:19.620 align:start position:0%
enormous pressure brought to bear and I
 
04:45:22.670 --> 04:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
have stood and held it to this point but
 
04:45:24.288 --> 04:45:24.298 align:start position:0%
as we get closer
 
04:45:26.628 --> 04:45:26.638 align:start position:0%
um it's becoming more and more evident
 
04:45:28.910 --> 04:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
that we need to we need to move a little
 
04:45:30.708 --> 04:45:30.718 align:start position:0%
bit quicker on some of these so that's
 
04:45:32.510 --> 04:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
what we're going to work hard over to do
 
04:45:34.850 --> 04:45:34.860 align:start position:0%
any further discussion on the retention
 
04:45:37.010 --> 04:45:37.020 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
04:45:38.750 --> 04:45:38.760 align:start position:0%

um yes this bill
 
04:48:04.550 --> 04:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
um excuse me this statute uh is an old
 
04:48:08.690 --> 04:48:08.700 align:start position:0%
one from I believe the 1920s and uh came
 
04:48:11.390 --> 04:48:11.400 align:start position:0%
before us at the the uh behest of the
 
04:48:14.330 --> 04:48:14.340 align:start position:0%
hotel association stakeholders
 
04:48:17.090 --> 04:48:17.100 align:start position:0%
um given a need for an update
 
04:48:17.100 --> 04:48:18.410 align:start position:0%
um given a need for an update
and

04:48:18.410 --> 04:48:18.420 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:48:22.850 --> 04:48:22.860 align:start position:0%
um this uh current Amendment will
 
04:48:26.030 --> 04:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
address the issue they had that required
 
04:48:28.490 --> 04:48:28.500 align:start position:0%
before a book or card system
 
04:48:30.590 --> 04:48:30.600 align:start position:0%
um method of bookkeeping which is
 
04:48:33.050 --> 04:48:33.060 align:start position:0%
certainly outdated and they would like
 
04:48:34.970 --> 04:48:34.980 align:start position:0%
to have the option to use more current
 
04:48:37.550 --> 04:48:37.560 align:start position:0%
data collection kind of
 
04:48:40.010 --> 04:48:40.020 align:start position:0%
um tools like computers and those kinds
 
04:48:43.128 --> 04:48:43.138 align:start position:0%
of things so um this amendment
 
04:48:46.670 --> 04:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
um does a few things it changes the
 
04:48:49.128 --> 04:48:49.138 align:start position:0%
requirement for a book or card system to
 
04:48:51.470 --> 04:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
be held and now we'll just re uh require
 
04:48:54.050 --> 04:48:54.060 align:start position:0%
that a record of the registered guests
 
04:48:57.170 --> 04:48:57.180 align:start position:0%
will be would be kept it also deleted
 
04:49:00.530 --> 04:49:00.540 align:start position:0%
the word each as it re it would
 
04:49:03.110 --> 04:49:03.120 align:start position:0%
reference guests who were required to
 
04:49:05.470 --> 04:49:05.480 align:start position:0%
provide their name for the hotel record
 
04:49:08.570 --> 04:49:08.580 align:start position:0%
it also deleted the
 
04:49:10.610 --> 04:49:10.620 align:start position:0%
um necessity and the reference to sign
 
04:49:13.190 --> 04:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
as it as to a signature for registering
 
04:49:13.200 --> 04:49:14.208 align:start position:0%
as it as to a signature for registering
guests

04:49:14.208 --> 04:49:14.218 align:start position:0%
guests
 
04:49:16.850 --> 04:49:16.860 align:start position:0%
um so now it's just their their name and
 
04:49:19.070 --> 04:49:19.080 align:start position:0%
it also deleted the option for a
 
04:49:21.288 --> 04:49:21.298 align:start position:0%
registering guest to use any name other
 
04:49:22.788 --> 04:49:22.798 align:start position:0%
than their legal name
 
04:49:25.970 --> 04:49:25.980 align:start position:0%
so it's pretty simple but we'll meet the
 
04:49:29.390 --> 04:49:29.400 align:start position:0%
needs of the stakeholders and
 
04:49:31.490 --> 04:49:31.500 align:start position:0%
um it was a lot of discussion amongst
 
04:49:33.708 --> 04:49:33.718 align:start position:0%
members and I think this is a is a good
 
04:49:35.570 --> 04:49:35.580 align:start position:0%
Amendment we'll address the issue thank
 
04:49:38.270 --> 04:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative pru would
 
04:49:39.708 --> 04:49:39.718 align:start position:0%
you like to speak to you second was it
 
04:49:41.750 --> 04:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
she said okay
 
04:49:44.810 --> 04:49:44.820 align:start position:0%
um I I agree with uh some of the members
 
04:49:47.390 --> 04:49:47.400 align:start position:0%
um that the bill did raise an
 
04:49:49.010 --> 04:49:49.020 align:start position:0%
interesting question actually some
 
04:49:51.050 --> 04:49:51.060 align:start position:0%
random citizen testified that brought
 
04:49:51.060 --> 04:49:51.948 align:start position:0%
random citizen testified that brought
that

04:49:51.948 --> 04:49:51.958 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:49:53.990 --> 04:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
um that in light of the Constitutional
 
04:49:56.810 --> 04:49:56.820 align:start position:0%
Amendment we just passed it is worthy of
 
04:49:59.270 --> 04:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
further discussion as to whether or not
 
04:50:01.550 --> 04:50:01.560 align:start position:0%
that should continue to be allowed or it
 
04:50:03.350 --> 04:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
should be tailored or all done with all
 
04:50:05.628 --> 04:50:05.638 align:start position:0%
done away with all together
 
04:50:07.368 --> 04:50:07.378 align:start position:0%
um having said that
 
04:50:09.410 --> 04:50:09.420 align:start position:0%
I don't want to punish the the folks
 
04:50:11.030 --> 04:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
that brought this forward asking for a
 
04:50:12.410 --> 04:50:12.420 align:start position:0%
simple fix but
 
04:50:14.448 --> 04:50:14.458 align:start position:0%
making it into a huge thing at this
 
04:50:17.330 --> 04:50:17.340 align:start position:0%
point I am going to look at it over the
 
04:50:19.730 --> 04:50:19.740 align:start position:0%
summer and speak with some folks and see
 
04:50:22.670 --> 04:50:22.680 align:start position:0%
if it's the legislation is possibly
 
04:50:24.770 --> 04:50:24.780 align:start position:0%
beneficial in the fall but right now
 
04:50:26.150 --> 04:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
we're just going to fix what they asked
 
04:50:28.190 --> 04:50:28.200 align:start position:0%
us to and we'll examine the issue that
 
04:50:30.230 --> 04:50:30.240 align:start position:0%

Mr just if you're working on something
 
04:50:38.208 --> 04:50:38.218 align:start position:0%
that would
 
04:50:41.150 --> 04:50:41.160 align:start position:0%
uh get rid of this outdated law or out
 
04:50:42.530 --> 04:50:42.540 align:start position:0%
of Warrant requirement I'd be happy to
 
04:50:43.970 --> 04:50:43.980 align:start position:0%
work with you in a bipartisan way on
 
04:50:46.190 --> 04:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
that yeah I appreciate that I'm not sure
 
04:50:47.448 --> 04:50:47.458 align:start position:0%
either one of those is what will happen
 
04:50:49.788 --> 04:50:49.798 align:start position:0%
but we're going to look at it and see
 
04:50:51.890 --> 04:50:51.900 align:start position:0%
um representative scitec

we have a right to privacy and you said
 
04:51:06.110 --> 04:51:06.120 align:start position:0%
it all and uh I think we have to keep

04:51:11.448 --> 04:51:11.458 align:start position:0%

motion representative Murphy

I know I think I think everything was
 
04:52:31.250 --> 04:52:31.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:32.990 --> 04:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
representative jambrian
 
04:52:35.448 --> 04:52:35.458 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh I think I may
 
04:52:37.730 --> 04:52:37.740 align:start position:0%
have told the committee that uh we had
 
04:52:39.410 --> 04:52:39.420 align:start position:0%
an incident in the town of Seabrook
 
04:52:42.708 --> 04:52:42.718 align:start position:0%
recently where a false alarm was called
 
04:52:46.128 --> 04:52:46.138 align:start position:0%
into the police by a person that was an
 
04:52:47.868 --> 04:52:47.878 align:start position:0%
Uber trying to protect her boyfriend
 
04:52:50.868 --> 04:52:50.878 align:start position:0%
from being arrested for shoplifting and
 
04:52:52.910 --> 04:52:52.920 align:start position:0%
it turned out to be a active shooter
 
04:52:55.448 --> 04:52:55.458 align:start position:0%
slash bomb threat
 
04:52:58.670 --> 04:52:58.680 align:start position:0%
through the investigation
 
04:53:00.650 --> 04:53:00.660 align:start position:0%
the police were able to determine where
 
04:53:03.770 --> 04:53:03.780 align:start position:0%
this person was staying by utilizing
 
04:53:06.230 --> 04:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
this law they were able to call the the
 
04:53:06.240 --> 04:53:07.850 align:start position:0%
this law they were able to call the the
hotel

04:53:07.850 --> 04:53:07.860 align:start position:0%
hotel
 
04:53:10.430 --> 04:53:10.440 align:start position:0%
and say do you have so-and-so registered
 
04:53:14.330 --> 04:53:14.340 align:start position:0%
here and they said yes so this law
 
04:53:17.090 --> 04:53:17.100 align:start position:0%
helped the investigation and quick
 
04:53:19.788 --> 04:53:19.798 align:start position:0%
resolution of that uh that incident in
 
04:53:22.010 --> 04:53:22.020 align:start position:0%
the town of Seabrook so I support the
 
04:53:24.470 --> 04:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
bill as amended
 
04:53:26.930 --> 04:53:26.940 align:start position:0%
thank you representative and I do think
 
04:53:28.990 --> 04:53:29.000 align:start position:0%
that there is a certain value in the law
 
04:53:31.430 --> 04:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
especially given the transient nature of
 
04:53:34.310 --> 04:53:34.320 align:start position:0%
people in a in a hotel versus people who
 
04:53:36.530 --> 04:53:36.540 align:start position:0%
there's a record of where they live in a
 
04:53:39.050 --> 04:53:39.060 align:start position:0%
permanent residence but I do think we
 
04:53:41.448 --> 04:53:41.458 align:start position:0%
have to balance that with the um the
 
04:53:44.208 --> 04:53:44.218 align:start position:0%
wishes of the people for privacy so
 
04:53:46.128 --> 04:53:46.138 align:start position:0%
we'll be looking at both sides of that
 
04:53:48.170 --> 04:53:48.180 align:start position:0%
very closely if we think of any new um
 
04:53:50.170 --> 04:53:50.180 align:start position:0%
legislation that would be necessary
 
04:53:52.788 --> 04:53:52.798 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
04:53:54.708 --> 04:53:54.718 align:start position:0%
see none of us could call the role
 
04:53:57.110 --> 04:53:57.120 align:start position:0%
representative I just can't help but
 
04:54:00.050 --> 04:54:00.060 align:start position:0%
observe we can get make a lot law
 
04:54:01.788 --> 04:54:01.798 align:start position:0%
enforcement a lot easier by getting rid
 
04:54:04.250 --> 04:54:04.260 align:start position:0%
of the Fourth Amendment reasonable
 
04:54:07.730 --> 04:54:07.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:11.270 --> 04:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
I think that would be a different motion
 
04:54:11.280 --> 04:54:12.590 align:start position:0%
I think that would be a different motion
um

04:54:12.590 --> 04:54:12.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:16.128 --> 04:54:16.138 align:start position:0%
I'll ask the clerk to call the rule and
 
04:54:17.510 --> 04:54:17.520 align:start position:0%

you Mr chairman uh so just as a friendly
 
04:55:43.970 --> 04:55:43.980 align:start position:0%
reminder to Senate Bill 76 it was the
 
04:55:47.270 --> 04:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
bill that had to do with reporting uh a
 
04:55:49.730 --> 04:55:49.740 align:start position:0%
death if a person comes across it and or
 
04:55:51.708 --> 04:55:51.718 align:start position:0%
the lack of not reporting it when you
 
04:55:54.170 --> 04:55:54.180 align:start position:0%
know about it and the committee all
 
04:55:56.090 --> 04:55:56.100 align:start position:0%
worked you know really hard and we you
 
04:55:57.170 --> 04:55:57.180 align:start position:0%
know I hurried up and I got the
 
04:55:59.570 --> 04:55:59.580 align:start position:0%
amendment taken care of and then that
 
04:56:01.670 --> 04:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
day we were working very quickly to move
 
04:56:04.190 --> 04:56:04.200 align:start position:0%
through and when the Senate bill came
 
04:56:06.110 --> 04:56:06.120 align:start position:0%
back we were the amendment we all
 
04:56:09.170 --> 04:56:09.180 align:start position:0%
completely forgot to put the title of
 
04:56:11.930 --> 04:56:11.940 align:start position:0%
the bill and our friend representative
 
04:56:13.910 --> 04:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
wheeler remembered after we all voted
 
04:56:16.070 --> 04:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
and we found out we needed to hold on to
 
04:56:19.070 --> 04:56:19.080 align:start position:0%
that in order to to introduce that
 
04:56:20.628 --> 04:56:20.638 align:start position:0%
amendment to name the bill and I would
 
04:56:22.368 --> 04:56:22.378 align:start position:0%
just ask everybody to please reconsider
 
04:56:24.650 --> 04:56:24.660 align:start position:0%
so that we can do that for this family
 
04:56:26.810 --> 04:56:26.820 align:start position:0%
and could you refresh us on what the
 
04:56:31.208 --> 04:56:31.218 align:start position:0%
name and why oh sure uh
 
04:56:33.770 --> 04:56:33.780 align:start position:0%
Maryland Maryland I think I believe that
 
04:56:34.970 --> 04:56:34.980 align:start position:0%
this is going to be called Maryland's
 
04:56:37.368 --> 04:56:37.378 align:start position:0%
law and it was the um the young lady
 
04:56:39.470 --> 04:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
that testified very unfortunate that her
 
04:56:41.570 --> 04:56:41.580 align:start position:0%
grandmother had passed away and it seems
 
04:56:43.550 --> 04:56:43.560 align:start position:0%
that a family member just
 
04:56:45.830 --> 04:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
chose to not report that and this bill
 
04:56:47.510 --> 04:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
will be named after the the woman's
 
04:56:47.520 --> 04:56:50.030 align:start position:0%
will be named after the the woman's
grandmother

04:56:50.030 --> 04:56:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:51.350 --> 04:56:51.360 align:start position:0%

04:56:54.650 --> 04:56:54.660 align:start position:0%
Representatives Rhodes said other than

to say that representative mannion was
 
04:56:58.550 --> 04:56:58.560 align:start position:0%
actually the person who reminded me I
 
04:56:59.810 --> 04:56:59.820 align:start position:0%
was just the one who did the life work
 
04:56:59.820 --> 04:57:00.770 align:start position:0%
was just the one who did the life work
but

04:57:00.770 --> 04:57:00.780 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:57:03.288 --> 04:57:03.298 align:start position:0%
it's a real great teamwork there
 
04:57:03.298 --> 04:57:05.050 align:start position:0%
it's a real great teamwork there
um

04:57:05.050 --> 04:57:05.060 align:start position:0%

04:58:28.070 --> 04:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
I have a question
 
04:58:29.810 --> 04:58:29.820 align:start position:0%
can the committee recommend two
 
04:58:31.310 --> 04:58:31.320 align:start position:0%
amendments because it was already
 
04:58:34.010 --> 04:58:34.020 align:start position:0%
amended we already passed Amendment so
 
04:58:36.110 --> 04:58:36.120 align:start position:0%
when it goes to the floor will it will
 
04:58:45.890 --> 04:58:45.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:48.890 --> 04:58:48.900 align:start position:0%
no because we have to pass the committee
 
04:58:50.150 --> 04:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
Amendment on the floor we can also
 
04:59:06.110 --> 04:59:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:08.628 --> 04:59:08.638 align:start position:0%
okay so um would you like to speak to
 
04:59:10.610 --> 04:59:10.620 align:start position:0%
your motion representative wheeler I
 
04:59:12.110 --> 04:59:12.120 align:start position:0%
think representative Rhodes said it very
 
04:59:13.550 --> 04:59:13.560 align:start position:0%
well this is just to honor the
 
04:59:15.530 --> 04:59:15.540 align:start position:0%
grandmother of the woman who took the
 
04:59:17.868 --> 04:59:17.878 align:start position:0%
time to come speak before us and gave us
 
04:59:19.910 --> 04:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
really heartfelt and Powerful testimony
 
04:59:22.070 --> 04:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
that I think we all took with heart and
 
04:59:24.590 --> 04:59:24.600 align:start position:0%
uh it's a good honor to pass this
 
04:59:26.150 --> 04:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
legislation and an even better one to
 
04:59:28.190 --> 04:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
honor her wish to name it after her
 
04:59:31.010 --> 04:59:31.020 align:start position:0%
grandmother herself thank you
 
04:59:32.330 --> 04:59:32.340 align:start position:0%
um would you like to speak to Second
 
04:59:34.788 --> 04:59:34.798 align:start position:0%
representative Manny I was covered thank
 
04:59:34.798 --> 04:59:35.810 align:start position:0%
representative Manny I was covered thank
you

04:59:35.810 --> 04:59:35.820 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:59:38.448 --> 04:59:38.458 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
04:59:40.550 --> 04:59:40.560 align:start position:0%
go ahead Mr chair so I do have a
 
04:59:41.510 --> 04:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
question actually
 
04:59:41.520 --> 04:59:42.288 align:start position:0%
question actually
um

04:59:42.288 --> 04:59:42.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:46.910 --> 04:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:49.670 --> 04:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
so does that actually that that Nolan
 
04:59:51.470 --> 04:59:51.480 align:start position:0%
voids everything we did last week so do
 
04:59:53.570 --> 04:59:53.580 align:start position:0%
we actually have to now vote on the
 
04:59:55.730 --> 04:59:55.740 align:start position:0%
amendment that was first brought that
 
04:59:58.250 --> 04:59:58.260 align:start position:0%
had the language that we wanted
 
05:00:00.890 --> 05:00:00.900 align:start position:0%
uh I think that all we reconsider was
 
05:00:02.868 --> 05:00:02.878 align:start position:0%
the final vote which was ought to pass
 
05:00:05.690 --> 05:00:05.700 align:start position:0%
okay very good very good after we had
 
05:00:08.270 --> 05:00:08.280 align:start position:0%
already adopted the amendment okay
 
05:00:11.030 --> 05:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
um I am going to hold on to this though
 
05:00:13.010 --> 05:00:13.020 align:start position:0%
after we vote today just to make sure
 
05:00:14.868 --> 05:00:14.878 align:start position:0%
it's okay with the clerk in case we need
 
05:00:16.550 --> 05:00:16.560 align:start position:0%
to take it up again to re-adopt all the
 
05:00:18.170 --> 05:00:18.180 align:start position:0%
Amendments okay
 
05:00:23.330 --> 05:00:23.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:27.310 --> 05:00:27.320 align:start position:0%
not a big fan of naming bills because
 
05:00:29.570 --> 05:00:29.580 align:start position:0%
we'll start with this one and then we're
 
05:00:31.490 --> 05:00:31.500 align:start position:0%
going to have to name every bill
 
05:00:31.500 --> 05:00:33.190 align:start position:0%
going to have to name every bill
so

05:00:33.190 --> 05:00:33.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:00:37.430 --> 05:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:39.650 --> 05:00:39.660 align:start position:0%
important that a name needs to go with
 
05:00:44.270 --> 05:00:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:46.070 --> 05:00:46.080 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler
 
05:00:47.570 --> 05:00:47.580 align:start position:0%
it's in response to what representative
 
05:00:50.150 --> 05:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
proof said I I hear that concern
 
05:00:52.610 --> 05:00:52.620 align:start position:0%
um I think there has been two bills that
 
05:00:53.990 --> 05:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
we've seen already in this committee
 
05:00:55.670 --> 05:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
that have had names one of them last
 
05:00:58.368 --> 05:00:58.378 align:start position:0%
week and I was so I hear that concern
 
05:01:00.410 --> 05:01:00.420 align:start position:0%
but I I think this is an instance in
 
05:01:02.330 --> 05:01:02.340 align:start position:0%
which naming the legislation is is
 
05:01:02.340 --> 05:01:05.930 align:start position:0%
which naming the legislation is is
warrant

05:01:05.930 --> 05:01:05.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:08.390 --> 05:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
you could representative um
 
05:01:11.628 --> 05:01:11.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:16.070 --> 05:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
thanks um not to be controversial but
 
05:01:18.170 --> 05:01:18.180 align:start position:0%
anyone who has a problem with the
 
05:01:20.330 --> 05:01:20.340 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment could take the
 
05:01:20.340 --> 05:01:21.708 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment could take the
opportunity

05:01:21.708 --> 05:01:21.718 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
05:01:23.448 --> 05:01:23.458 align:start position:0%
to make a restroom break or something
 
05:01:25.190 --> 05:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
out of respect for the family given the
 
05:01:26.990 --> 05:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
subject matter
 
05:01:29.330 --> 05:01:29.340 align:start position:0%
um for what it's worth we don't name a
 
05:01:30.530 --> 05:01:30.540 align:start position:0%
lot of stuff
 
05:01:32.690 --> 05:01:32.700 align:start position:0%
just a suggestion you don't always have
 
05:01:34.788 --> 05:01:34.798 align:start position:0%
to vote especially because some men and
 
05:01:37.010 --> 05:01:37.020 align:start position:0%
I'm sure we're all in agreement it is a
 
05:01:39.550 --> 05:01:39.560 align:start position:0%
legitimate um suggestion representative
 
05:01:42.890 --> 05:01:42.900 align:start position:0%
my heart's not really in this because I
 
05:01:45.110 --> 05:01:45.120 align:start position:0%
I don't like to vote for Resolutions and
 
05:01:48.288 --> 05:01:48.298 align:start position:0%
I don't like to vote for naming laws so
 
05:01:50.448 --> 05:01:50.458 align:start position:0%
I'm going to agree with a representative
 
05:01:52.670 --> 05:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
Prue but I will of course vote for the
 
05:01:54.650 --> 05:01:54.660 align:start position:0%
amended bill
 
05:01:58.910 --> 05:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
thank you I see that both of the um
 
05:02:00.830 --> 05:02:00.840 align:start position:0%
both of the representatives who grew up
 
05:02:02.330 --> 05:02:02.340 align:start position:0%
in Edna
 
05:02:07.310 --> 05:02:07.320 align:start position:0%
seem to not like Eamon Bells I I feel uh
 
05:02:12.110 --> 05:02:12.120 align:start position:0%
that um yeah okay any further discussion
 
05:02:15.050 --> 05:02:15.060 align:start position:0%
oh representative Newman
 
05:02:17.810 --> 05:02:17.820 align:start position:0%
oh yes on this vote for the amendment
 
05:02:19.670 --> 05:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
does not really change the bill it'll
 
05:02:21.110 --> 05:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
always be referred to by the official
 
05:02:22.910 --> 05:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
name and this is just a short title and
 
05:02:25.128 --> 05:02:25.138 align:start position:0%
it's a note in the bill itself
 
05:02:26.930 --> 05:02:26.940 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't even believe that this
 
05:02:29.150 --> 05:02:29.160 align:start position:0%
would show up in the books that this
 
05:02:31.310 --> 05:02:31.320 align:start position:0%
name part I don't think
 
05:02:33.410 --> 05:02:33.420 align:start position:0%
um but I'm not sure
 
05:02:34.788 --> 05:02:34.798 align:start position:0%
maybe that's not in chapter law
 
05:02:37.128 --> 05:02:37.138 align:start position:0%
representative Bolton I'm personally
 
05:02:38.510 --> 05:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
feeling really anxious about this two
 
05:02:40.010 --> 05:02:40.020 align:start position:0%
amendments thing so I'm just gonna go
 
05:02:42.590 --> 05:02:42.600 align:start position:0%
call Paul as I said
 
05:02:44.868 --> 05:02:44.878 align:start position:0%
oh you already talked to him oh I guess
 
05:02:46.970 --> 05:02:46.980 align:start position:0%
I missed that detail okay yeah and
 
05:02:49.010 --> 05:02:49.020 align:start position:0%
anyway I'm gonna have Karen hold on to
 
05:02:51.050 --> 05:02:51.060 align:start position:0%
it for a day or so so I can check to
 
05:02:53.690 --> 05:02:53.700 align:start position:0%
make sure okay would hate to have to
 
05:02:55.190 --> 05:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
have this whole conversation all over
 
05:02:55.200 --> 05:02:58.670 align:start position:0%
have this whole conversation all over
again

05:02:58.670 --> 05:02:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:00.470 --> 05:03:00.480 align:start position:0%

05:08:27.288 --> 05:08:27.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:44.170 --> 05:08:44.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:47.330 --> 05:08:47.340 align:start position:0%
so Mr chairman
 
05:08:50.150 --> 05:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
representative janvard be quiet
 
05:08:56.150 --> 05:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
we have to redo our redo
 
05:08:59.170 --> 05:08:59.180 align:start position:0%
yes so last week
 
05:09:02.448 --> 05:09:02.458 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler called the house
 
05:09:06.110 --> 05:09:06.120 align:start position:0%
Clerk and he he told us to hold on to he
 
05:09:07.970 --> 05:09:07.980 align:start position:0%
told us to hold on to the blurb and to
 
05:09:10.490 --> 05:09:10.500 align:start position:0%
not submit it to his office for us to
 
05:09:13.070 --> 05:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
reconsider our vote and we misunderstood
 
05:09:14.990 --> 05:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
when he when he told representative
 
05:09:16.930 --> 05:09:16.940 align:start position:0%
wheeler to just write the amendment
 
05:09:19.070 --> 05:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
renaming the bill
 
05:09:21.708 --> 05:09:21.718 align:start position:0%
I believe what he meant was rewrite
 
05:09:24.230 --> 05:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
rewrite the amendment renaming the bill
 
05:09:26.628 --> 05:09:26.638 align:start position:0%
in with the amendment that was already
 
05:09:29.570 --> 05:09:29.580 align:start position:0%
written with all the language so now we
 
05:09:32.868 --> 05:09:32.878 align:start position:0%
need another amendment to bring it all
 
05:09:32.878 --> 05:09:34.070 align:start position:0%
need another amendment to bring it all
together

05:09:34.070 --> 05:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
together
 
05:09:36.770 --> 05:09:36.780 align:start position:0%
so okay so we're not going to transmit
 
05:09:37.910 --> 05:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
that bill we're going to hold it and
 
05:09:39.288 --> 05:09:39.298 align:start position:0%
we'll take it up Wednesday in the
 
05:09:40.610 --> 05:09:40.620 align:start position:0%
meantime someone will get the amendment
 
05:09:43.010 --> 05:09:43.020 align:start position:0%
of the amendment on the amendment who
 
05:09:45.410 --> 05:09:45.420 align:start position:0%
who owes me uh like a coffee or
 
05:09:47.030 --> 05:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
something could have saved us the
 
05:09:48.830 --> 05:09:48.840 align:start position:0%
trouble no I don't think so because we
 
05:10:04.490 --> 05:10:04.500 align:start position:0%
