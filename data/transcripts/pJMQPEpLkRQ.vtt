television

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
television
 
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:31.120 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah we spoke i can't i can't hear
 
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
if you don't talk
 
00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:37.990 align:start position:0%

sir

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:40.469 --> 00:07:40.479 align:start position:0%
yes there was testimony about that and
 
00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:44.869 --> 00:07:44.879 align:start position:0%
well i think they said it was an
 
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
inconvenience to have to be licensed
 
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
just if you blew into town with
 
00:07:50.469 --> 00:07:50.479 align:start position:0%
hollywood and wanted to
 
00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
you know or were doing a tv appearance
 
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
or something
 
00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
oh i'm not close enough
 
00:07:59.189 --> 00:07:59.199 align:start position:0%
they regarded it as an inconvenience if
 
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
you were sort of just having a tv
 
00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
appearance or hollywood production blew
 
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
into town to to find local people just
 
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
to cater to them that they would prefer
 
00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
that did not have to be licensed
 
00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
yeah right i think i mean i think
 
00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
they might have their own people but if
 
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
they're only in for a little bit they're
 
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
probably not going to be licensed in new
 
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.629 align:start position:0%
probably not going to be licensed in new
hampshire

00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:22.240 align:start position:0%
i think a lot of times they bring their
 
00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.510 align:start position:0%
i think a lot of times they bring their
lives

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
lives
 
00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.990 align:start position:0%
lives
sorry

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah but
 
00:08:30.869 --> 00:08:30.879 align:start position:0%
um i'm i'm good with that i'm
 
00:08:32.469 --> 00:08:32.479 align:start position:0%
my concern
 
00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
with the whole bill has to do with um
 
00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:43.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
i have that concern
 
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:49.200 align:start position:0%
because it involves glue
 
00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.030 align:start position:0%
because it involves glue
and

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
getting glue close to somebody's eye
 
00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
really bothers me
 
00:08:58.389 --> 00:08:58.399 align:start position:0%
and if you don't use the right kind of
 
00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:00.800 align:start position:0%
glue you know
 
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
so i'm concerned about that part
 
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:09.430 align:start position:0%
so i'm concerned about that part
and

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:13.269 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:09:13.269 --> 00:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:19.360 align:start position:0%
same glue issue again on the
 
00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
line five
 
00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:26.720 align:start position:0%
blow drying sounds fine but it defines
 
00:09:29.509 --> 00:09:29.519 align:start position:0%
it it says it includes
 
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
hair extensions and sometimes those are
 
00:09:35.509 --> 00:09:35.519 align:start position:0%
from what i read on the internet
 
00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes those are glued in too
 
00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:40.630 align:start position:0%
sometimes those are glued in too
and

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:54.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:00.389 --> 00:10:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:01.829 --> 00:10:01.839 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:04.800 align:start position:0%

with amendment
otp

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:48.150 align:start position:0%
 
second

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:51.990 align:start position:0%
 
discussion

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.949 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:12:54.949 --> 00:12:54.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
i don't want to take much time but i
 
00:12:59.670 --> 00:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
think you know exempting these
 
00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
parts of the uh
 
00:13:04.629 --> 00:13:04.639 align:start position:0%
the licensing seems reasonable to me
 
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah i support that i believe
 
00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:08.720 align:start position:0%
this will open up the market for people
 
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
who want to do this who probably have
 
00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
done it all their lives
 
00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:17.200 align:start position:0%
it's a niche market for the people yeah
 
00:13:18.389 --> 00:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
that want to provide the service and
 
00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:21.200 align:start position:0%
there's demand clearly so thank you
 
00:13:22.629 --> 00:13:22.639 align:start position:0%
and then just one more thing real quick
 
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh a lot of these things they don't even
 
00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
teach in the 1500 hours of training so
 
00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
if you get license in it you still don't
 
00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:30.710 align:start position:0%
if you get license in it you still don't
have

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:13:32.629 --> 00:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
the education required to be safe in
 
00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
oh on the bill if you want to discuss
 
00:13:46.629 --> 00:13:46.639 align:start position:0%
the bill now with the amendment
 
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
well i would just respond to that by
 
00:13:51.269 --> 00:13:51.279 align:start position:0%
saying that there isn't any
 
00:13:53.269 --> 00:13:53.279 align:start position:0%
you know maybe the cosmetologists that
 
00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
are licensed don't have training in this
 
00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
but neither do the people there's no
 
00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
requirement that the um people who will
 
00:14:03.269 --> 00:14:03.279 align:start position:0%
start doing this have any training
 
00:14:03.279 --> 00:14:04.389 align:start position:0%
start doing this have any training
either

00:14:04.389 --> 00:14:04.399 align:start position:0%
either
 
00:14:08.069 --> 00:14:08.079 align:start position:0%
and they can do it without any training
 
00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
there's no more discussion
 
00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:27.269 --> 00:14:27.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:29.829 --> 00:14:29.839 align:start position:0%
yeah i'll vote yes
 
00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:37.910 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:40.389 align:start position:0%
all right
uh

00:14:40.389 --> 00:14:40.399 align:start position:0%

thank you so we're closing the hearing
 
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:03.120 align:start position:0%

yeah this is a much
 
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
simpler build this is kind of a
 
00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:36.069 align:start position:0%
simpler build this is kind of a
reciprocity

00:15:36.069 --> 00:15:36.079 align:start position:0%
reciprocity
 
00:15:36.079 --> 00:15:39.509 align:start position:0%
reciprocity
um

00:15:39.509 --> 00:15:39.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
so somebody coming in from a different
 
00:15:46.949 --> 00:15:46.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:50.720 align:start position:0%

1560. yeah if you any question any
 
00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
discussion please representative golly
 
00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and i
 
00:16:24.069 --> 00:16:24.079 align:start position:0%
too will
 
00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:26.720 align:start position:0%
be voting against this i think what we
 
00:16:29.189 --> 00:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
haven't current statute is uh sufficient
 
00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
and needs not be changed
 
00:16:34.389 --> 00:16:34.399 align:start position:0%
as long as the uh requirements
 
00:16:36.389 --> 00:16:36.399 align:start position:0%
of other states are similar to ours i
 
00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
think is
 
00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:39.350 align:start position:0%
think is
um

00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
proficient um i
 
00:16:43.189 --> 00:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
don't know what other states have in
 
00:16:44.949 --> 00:16:44.959 align:start position:0%
mind or whether states may do to lower
 
00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:46.720 align:start position:0%
the requirements but
 
00:16:50.389 --> 00:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
if they are a very low standard
 
00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:51.839 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure it's in the best interest
 
00:16:53.509 --> 00:16:53.519 align:start position:0%
of the folks here in new hampshire to
 
00:16:55.269 --> 00:16:55.279 align:start position:0%
just automatically have a reciprocity
 
00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
with that state so i can't support the
 
00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.310 align:start position:0%
with that state so i can't support the
change

00:16:58.310 --> 00:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:16:59.350 --> 00:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
00:17:05.669 --> 00:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
so um i i agree with that exactly so if
 
00:17:07.429 --> 00:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
i know that there's an effort around the
 
00:17:07.439 --> 00:17:11.990 align:start position:0%
i know that there's an effort around the
country

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
other state legislators are all also
 
00:17:17.429 --> 00:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
seeing a bill similar to this but
 
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
but what it does is it just would if one
 
00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:22.079 align:start position:0%
state lowers the
 
00:17:25.189 --> 00:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
requirements from you know like
 
00:17:27.909 --> 00:17:27.919 align:start position:0%
a thousand hours of for cosmetology for
 
00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
example like a thousand hours of
 
00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
training and
 
00:17:33.669 --> 00:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
and they lower it to like all you have
 
00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
to do is just register with us to get a
 
00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:37.029 align:start position:0%
to do is just register with us to get a
license

00:17:37.029 --> 00:17:37.039 align:start position:0%
license
 
00:17:37.039 --> 00:17:37.990 align:start position:0%
license
then

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:17:40.549 --> 00:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
all all the states that adopt this will
 
00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
suddenly have their standards plummet
 
00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:44.549 align:start position:0%
suddenly have their standards plummet
and

00:17:44.549 --> 00:17:44.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
you won't even have time to
 
00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
react you know you might not even know
 
00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
it happens and there's not time for the
 
00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
legislators to react to that so this is
 
00:17:59.029 --> 00:17:59.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:07.440 align:start position:0%

01:30:16.629 --> 01:30:16.639 align:start position:0%
first of all the sign in sheet for the
 
01:30:18.709 --> 01:30:18.719 align:start position:0%
committee members is over by
 
01:30:21.350 --> 01:30:21.360 align:start position:0%

whatever those are whatever those are
 
01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:30.000 align:start position:0%

submitted this bill at our request
 
01:33:33.110 --> 01:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
what it does is it changes the
 
01:33:35.830 --> 01:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
classification system for two of our
 
01:33:37.669 --> 01:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
two of the leaders the senior leaders in
 
01:33:40.790 --> 01:33:40.800 align:start position:0%
the in the department
 
01:33:42.470 --> 01:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
so the cemetery director who is
 
01:33:44.709 --> 01:33:44.719 align:start position:0%
currently a classified employee and the
 
01:33:46.470 --> 01:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
director of the division of
 
01:33:48.790 --> 01:33:48.800 align:start position:0%
community-based military programs
 
01:33:52.470 --> 01:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
in 2019 rsa-110b was amended and it
 
01:33:53.910 --> 01:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
created the department of military
 
01:33:55.750 --> 01:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
affairs and veterans services formerly
 
01:33:58.470 --> 01:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
the adjutant general's department
 
01:33:59.990 --> 01:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
now the department has three major
 
01:34:02.790 --> 01:34:02.800 align:start position:0%
divisions uh from a state perspective
 
01:34:04.790 --> 01:34:04.800 align:start position:0%
clearly the national guard is part of
 
01:34:06.470 --> 01:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
the department but from a state
 
01:34:08.390 --> 01:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
perspective servicing the veterans of
 
01:34:09.830 --> 01:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
the state we now have the division of
 
01:34:11.350 --> 01:34:11.360 align:start position:0%
veterans services the division of
 
01:34:13.030 --> 01:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
community-based military programs and
 
01:34:15.910 --> 01:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:17.590 --> 01:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
all three of those divisions are
 
01:34:19.830 --> 01:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
authorized in existing statute
 
01:34:21.590 --> 01:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
currently only the
 
01:34:22.950 --> 01:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
director of the division of veteran
 
01:34:24.550 --> 01:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
services is in the unclassified
 
01:34:26.950 --> 01:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
personnel system the other two directors
 
01:34:29.750 --> 01:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
still punch a time clock
 
01:34:30.870 --> 01:34:30.880 align:start position:0%
in the past
 
01:34:32.310 --> 01:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
four years the duties and
 
01:34:34.149 --> 01:34:34.159 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of those two positions
 
01:34:35.990 --> 01:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
that are on the classified system have
 
01:34:37.910 --> 01:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
evolved significantly both in scope and
 
01:34:37.920 --> 01:34:39.750 align:start position:0%
evolved significantly both in scope and
responsibility

01:34:39.750 --> 01:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
01:34:41.750 --> 01:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
the current paradigm is outdated
 
01:34:43.590 --> 01:34:43.600 align:start position:0%
inefficient and an impediment to our
 
01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:44.830 align:start position:0%
inefficient and an impediment to our
mission

01:34:44.830 --> 01:34:44.840 align:start position:0%
mission
 
01:34:47.350 --> 01:34:47.360 align:start position:0%
accomplishment additionally so so i'll
 
01:34:48.950 --> 01:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
give you a little background on how
 
01:34:50.870 --> 01:34:50.880 align:start position:0%
those positions have evolved a little
 
01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:52.070 align:start position:0%
those positions have evolved a little
bit

01:34:52.070 --> 01:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
bit
 
01:34:53.669 --> 01:34:53.679 align:start position:0%
two sessions ago the veterans bill of
 
01:34:56.470 --> 01:34:56.480 align:start position:0%
rights significantly added uh
 
01:34:57.910 --> 01:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility to the division of
 
01:35:00.390 --> 01:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
community-based military programs
 
01:35:02.790 --> 01:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
now they have to administer a military
 
01:35:05.030 --> 01:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
skills test waiver program
 
01:35:06.550 --> 01:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
enable the acceptance of military
 
01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:07.750 align:start position:0%
enable the acceptance of military
training

01:35:07.750 --> 01:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
training
 
01:35:08.870 --> 01:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
and ex
 
01:35:11.270 --> 01:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
and experience in professional licensing
 
01:35:12.870 --> 01:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
and establish a program to end
 
01:35:15.270 --> 01:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
homelessness for veterans
 
01:35:17.030 --> 01:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
the scope of the cemetery uh
 
01:35:18.470 --> 01:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
superintendent which is how it's
 
01:35:21.109 --> 01:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
currently described in uh in statute
 
01:35:24.550 --> 01:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
has also uh involve evolved now he has
 
01:35:26.310 --> 01:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
to plan and budget for
 
01:35:28.550 --> 01:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
and coordinate some multi-million dollar
 
01:35:30.229 --> 01:35:30.239 align:start position:0%
expansions at the cemetery which is
 
01:35:34.229 --> 01:35:34.239 align:start position:0%
growing at almost an exponential rate
 
01:35:35.510 --> 01:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
he coordinates directly with the
 
01:35:36.790 --> 01:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
department of veterans affairs for
 
01:35:38.709 --> 01:35:38.719 align:start position:0%
funding and policy
 
01:35:40.870 --> 01:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
in recent years
 
01:35:42.629 --> 01:35:42.639 align:start position:0%
we've seen the number of in when i say
 
01:35:45.189 --> 01:35:45.199 align:start position:0%
recent years since 2015 the number of
 
01:35:47.030 --> 01:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
people number of souls interred at the
 
01:35:49.510 --> 01:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
cemetery has doubled
 
01:35:50.950 --> 01:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
right so the cemeteries are going to be
 
01:35:53.350 --> 01:35:53.360 align:start position:0%
25 years old in september
 
01:35:55.669 --> 01:35:55.679 align:start position:0%
and in the last seven years
 
01:35:55.679 --> 01:35:56.550 align:start position:0%
and in the last seven years
the

01:35:56.550 --> 01:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:35:58.870 --> 01:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
the census at the cemetery has doubled
 
01:36:01.030 --> 01:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
we expect it to continue to be that high
 
01:36:02.229 --> 01:36:02.239 align:start position:0%
last year was the highest number of
 
01:36:04.550 --> 01:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
internments we had at the cemetery
 
01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:05.350 align:start position:0%
internments we had at the cemetery
ever

01:36:05.350 --> 01:36:05.360 align:start position:0%
ever
 
01:36:07.750 --> 01:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
with about 1150
 
01:36:10.629 --> 01:36:10.639 align:start position:0%
souls interred there
 
01:36:13.830 --> 01:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
we also have executed in the last
 
01:36:15.910 --> 01:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
eight years three expansions and the
 
01:36:19.030 --> 01:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
next expansion to add 2 800 more column
 
01:36:20.709 --> 01:36:20.719 align:start position:0%
barrier niches
 
01:36:24.870 --> 01:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:26.709 --> 01:36:26.719 align:start position:0%
so those two classified employees that
 
01:36:29.430 --> 01:36:29.440 align:start position:0%
that lead those two divisions right they
 
01:36:31.750 --> 01:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
have fixed schedules and their duties
 
01:36:34.629 --> 01:36:34.639 align:start position:0%
often in require them to work outside of
 
01:36:36.470 --> 01:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
those fixed schedules it just makes it
 
01:36:38.629 --> 01:36:38.639 align:start position:0%
hard right so we have to punch a time
 
01:36:40.550 --> 01:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
clock we have to ask for you know
 
01:36:41.910 --> 01:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
changes to
 
01:36:44.070 --> 01:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
uh to work schedules and those kinds of
 
01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:44.950 align:start position:0%
uh to work schedules and those kinds of
things

01:36:44.950 --> 01:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:36:48.709 --> 01:36:48.719 align:start position:0%
moving them to the unclassified salary
 
01:36:51.109 --> 01:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
system would just make it
 
01:36:53.990 --> 01:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
easier more efficient
 
01:36:55.669 --> 01:36:55.679 align:start position:0%
better for our mission accomplishment as
 
01:36:57.270 --> 01:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
we move forward
 
01:36:59.350 --> 01:36:59.360 align:start position:0%
so this is uh this is something that we
 
01:37:02.310 --> 01:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
think is is uh will benefit the state
 
01:37:04.709 --> 01:37:04.719 align:start position:0%
at not an additional significant
 
01:37:07.270 --> 01:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
additional cost frankly they're worth it
 
01:37:09.030 --> 01:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
right the incumbents that do these jobs
 
01:37:10.390 --> 01:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
right now and anybody who holds these
 
01:37:12.470 --> 01:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
jobs in the future will be worth it they
 
01:37:13.910 --> 01:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
provide a tremendous service for the
 
01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:14.870 align:start position:0%
provide a tremendous service for the
veterans

01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
veterans
 
01:37:16.070 --> 01:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
and the citizens of the state of new
 
01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:16.950 align:start position:0%
and the citizens of the state of new
hampshire

01:37:16.950 --> 01:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:37:20.550 --> 01:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
uh before i before i uh
 
01:37:21.990 --> 01:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
yield to questions and i'll take all of
 
01:37:23.910 --> 01:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
your questions i would like to say that
 
01:37:26.310 --> 01:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the the work and help of
 
01:37:28.470 --> 01:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
representative fellowes who pointed out
 
01:37:30.390 --> 01:37:30.400 align:start position:0%
that some of the language in the bill as
 
01:37:30.400 --> 01:37:31.189 align:start position:0%
that some of the language in the bill as
uh

01:37:31.189 --> 01:37:31.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:37:31.199 --> 01:37:32.629 align:start position:0%
uh
as

01:37:32.629 --> 01:37:32.639 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:37:34.870 --> 01:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
it was originally written and introduced
 
01:37:37.669 --> 01:37:37.679 align:start position:0%
had some very clunky language in it
 
01:37:40.149 --> 01:37:40.159 align:start position:0%
and she has graciously uh represented
 
01:37:41.990 --> 01:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
fellows has graciously
 
01:37:43.910 --> 01:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
agreed to to
 
01:37:45.270 --> 01:37:45.280 align:start position:0%
submit an amendment to this bill that
 
01:37:47.750 --> 01:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
amendment is uh
 
01:37:49.109 --> 01:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
0 2 2
 
01:37:51.990 --> 01:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
0 9 6 h i think copies were available on
 
01:37:54.149 --> 01:37:54.159 align:start position:0%
the table all it does is all the
 
01:37:57.030 --> 01:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
amendment does is clean up the clunky
 
01:37:59.590 --> 01:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
language when we submitted it to ols and
 
01:38:01.750 --> 01:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
ols wrote it right so this is probably
 
01:38:04.629 --> 01:38:04.639 align:start position:0%
on me as i drafted the language
 
01:38:06.470 --> 01:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
and i appreciate the attention to detail
 
01:38:09.270 --> 01:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
that representative fellowes
 
01:38:11.830 --> 01:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
provided and her counsel which was
 
01:38:16.550 --> 01:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
outstanding all it does is really delete
 
01:38:18.709 --> 01:38:18.719 align:start position:0%
some of that clunky language so i
 
01:38:19.830 --> 01:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
imagine as you work through the
 
01:38:21.669 --> 01:38:21.679 align:start position:0%
executive session of the bill you'll be
 
01:38:23.430 --> 01:38:23.440 align:start position:0%
able to address that and
 
01:38:26.629 --> 01:38:26.639 align:start position:0%
it should clean up that clunky language
 
01:38:29.590 --> 01:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
that concludes my testimony and i'm
 
01:38:32.149 --> 01:38:32.159 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any of your questions
 
01:38:34.950 --> 01:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:37.030 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
o'brien

01:38:37.030 --> 01:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
o'brien
 
01:38:38.390 --> 01:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
thank you i understand what you're
 
01:38:40.790 --> 01:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
trying to do uh these positions that
 
01:38:42.709 --> 01:38:42.719 align:start position:0%
you're trying to change
 
01:38:45.750 --> 01:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
into this new format are they under any
 
01:38:47.430 --> 01:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
type of pension system that could be
 
01:38:50.310 --> 01:38:50.320 align:start position:0%
affected with these type of changes
 
01:38:52.709 --> 01:38:52.719 align:start position:0%
our good intentions could cause a
 
01:38:52.719 --> 01:38:53.830 align:start position:0%
our good intentions could cause a
blowback

01:38:53.830 --> 01:38:53.840 align:start position:0%
blowback
 
01:38:56.550 --> 01:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
so the answer is they are they are part
 
01:38:58.709 --> 01:38:58.719 align:start position:0%
of the state's pension system but it my
 
01:39:00.310 --> 01:39:00.320 align:start position:0%
understanding is based on changes to the
 
01:39:02.070 --> 01:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
current law that they will
 
01:39:04.070 --> 01:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
the way it's written now that will not
 
01:39:09.510 --> 01:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:09.520 --> 01:39:10.390 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:39:10.390 --> 01:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:39:12.870 --> 01:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
classified and unclassified employees
 
01:39:14.470 --> 01:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
both are covered under the pension
 
01:39:14.480 --> 01:39:16.390 align:start position:0%
both are covered under the pension
system

01:39:16.390 --> 01:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:39:17.669 --> 01:39:17.679 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:39:17.679 --> 01:39:18.310 align:start position:0%
other questions
and

01:39:18.310 --> 01:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:39:20.149 --> 01:39:20.159 align:start position:0%
if i could clarify one other point
 
01:39:22.149 --> 01:39:22.159 align:start position:0%
mountain chairs that they also recently
 
01:39:24.070 --> 01:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
said that they could keep their vacation
 
01:39:25.590 --> 01:39:25.600 align:start position:0%
earned so we don't we won't have to pay
 
01:39:27.189 --> 01:39:27.199 align:start position:0%
them out
 
01:39:29.750 --> 01:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
the law changed recently so any vacation
 
01:39:31.270 --> 01:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
that they've earned we don't have to pay
 
01:39:32.870 --> 01:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
them out for that vacation they can roll
 
01:39:34.790 --> 01:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
it into the unclassified system and
 
01:39:39.189 --> 01:39:39.199 align:start position:0%
either use it or be paid out later in
 
01:39:41.030 --> 01:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
in their career
 
01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:44.070 align:start position:0%
in their career
okay

01:39:44.070 --> 01:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:45.590 --> 01:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:39:47.590 --> 01:39:47.600 align:start position:0%
right seeing none thank you very much
 
01:39:48.790 --> 01:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your favorable
 
01:40:05.189 --> 01:40:05.199 align:start position:0%

where we are today on this
 
01:40:45.750 --> 01:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
in december of 2016 governor elect
 
01:40:47.990 --> 01:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
sununu attended our state veterans

advisory committee and he asked us a
 
01:40:52.070 --> 01:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
question that frankly we couldn't answer
 
01:40:53.990 --> 01:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
and that question was
 
01:40:55.669 --> 01:40:55.679 align:start position:0%
if i have a veteran who has a problem
 
01:40:58.070 --> 01:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
who do i send them to
 
01:40:59.510 --> 01:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
and we all looked at each other and said
 
01:41:01.430 --> 01:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
well i guess it sort of depends on what
 
01:41:03.510 --> 01:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
the problem is and and we can probably
 
01:41:05.430 --> 01:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
figure it out and and the governor said
 
01:41:07.189 --> 01:41:07.199 align:start position:0%
you know that really is not is not what
 
01:41:09.109 --> 01:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
i'm looking for i'm looking for as we
 
01:41:10.709 --> 01:41:10.719 align:start position:0%
used to say in the military the single
 
01:41:12.390 --> 01:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
belly button i can push to get things
 
01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:13.189 align:start position:0%
belly button i can push to get things
done

01:41:13.189 --> 01:41:13.199 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:41:15.350 --> 01:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
and that that sort of
 
01:41:18.390 --> 01:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
impetus resulted in the the act two
 
01:41:21.430 --> 01:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
years ago or in 2019 that with the 2019
 
01:41:22.870 --> 01:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
session that created the department of
 
01:41:24.790 --> 01:41:24.800 align:start position:0%
military affairs and veterans services
 
01:41:27.109 --> 01:41:27.119 align:start position:0%
and we we realized all along as we were
 
01:41:28.550 --> 01:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
doing this and the bill was changing and
 
01:41:29.990 --> 01:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
everything else that there would be some
 
01:41:31.270 --> 01:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
things we would need to clean up a
 
01:41:33.669 --> 01:41:33.679 align:start position:0%
little bit once this is all done
 
01:41:36.390 --> 01:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
and this bill is part of that cleanup
 
01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:37.510 align:start position:0%
and this bill is part of that cleanup
process

01:41:37.510 --> 01:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:41:39.590 --> 01:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
i know both of the people involved in in
 
01:41:41.270 --> 01:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
this personally they are very hard
 
01:41:44.470 --> 01:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
working folks and as
 
01:41:47.350 --> 01:41:47.360 align:start position:0%
as mr perry said they frequently do a
 
01:41:49.750 --> 01:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
lot of things that don't necessarily
 
01:41:51.830 --> 01:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
line up with a nine to five schedule
 
01:41:54.550 --> 01:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
i'll give you a couple of examples my uh
 
01:41:56.310 --> 01:41:56.320 align:start position:0%
my my association of graduates of the
 
01:41:57.910 --> 01:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
air force academy group wanted to do a
 
01:41:59.430 --> 01:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
community service project and so we
 
01:42:01.990 --> 01:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
reached out to sean buck at the veterans
 
01:42:03.990 --> 01:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
cemetery and he said i've got a group of
 
01:42:05.590 --> 01:42:05.600 align:start position:0%
folks from gold star mothers that are
 
01:42:08.390 --> 01:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
going to come in and clean gravestones
 
01:42:10.870 --> 01:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh in a week and so we brought our group
 
01:42:12.550 --> 01:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
and combined with them and between the
 
01:42:14.470 --> 01:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
three of us we are between the two
 
01:42:16.629 --> 01:42:16.639 align:start position:0%
groups we cleaned about a third of the
 
01:42:18.790 --> 01:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
of the headstones in one in one weekend
 
01:42:20.310 --> 01:42:20.320 align:start position:0%
but he had to be there and members of
 
01:42:22.790 --> 01:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
his staff had to be there to help us on
 
01:42:24.550 --> 01:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
a weekend to get that done
 
01:42:26.070 --> 01:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
when you have a job that is you know
 
01:42:28.390 --> 01:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
community relations oriented like amy
 
01:42:30.870 --> 01:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
cook's job is a lot of the things she
 
01:42:32.629 --> 01:42:32.639 align:start position:0%
needs to attend the meetings she goes to
 
01:42:35.270 --> 01:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
those kinds of things occur after hours
 
01:42:36.629 --> 01:42:36.639 align:start position:0%
because the people that are doing those
 
01:42:37.910 --> 01:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
kind of volunteer things for our
 
01:42:40.310 --> 01:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
veterans in the community are have a job
 
01:42:42.229 --> 01:42:42.239 align:start position:0%
during the day i'm certain everyone in
 
01:42:44.390 --> 01:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
this room can can appreciate that given
 
01:42:46.470 --> 01:42:46.480 align:start position:0%
the time that you give up to do this
 
01:42:47.990 --> 01:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
the last reason that we really support
 
01:42:50.470 --> 01:42:50.480 align:start position:0%
this bill is thinking big picture
 
01:42:52.390 --> 01:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
although we really like the job that
 
01:42:54.470 --> 01:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
sean and amy are doing you know things
 
01:42:57.109 --> 01:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
change you know opportunities arise
 
01:42:58.629 --> 01:42:58.639 align:start position:0%
they're not always going to be in that
 
01:43:00.790 --> 01:43:00.800 align:start position:0%
position and i think that when we look
 
01:43:02.390 --> 01:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
down the road
 
01:43:04.550 --> 01:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
we're going to be able to attract
 
01:43:07.750 --> 01:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
a lot more qualified candidates if if
 
01:43:09.430 --> 01:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:43:11.910 --> 01:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
a salaried position rather than a time
 
01:43:13.830 --> 01:43:13.840 align:start position:0%
clock position i think we're we're just
 
01:43:15.350 --> 01:43:15.360 align:start position:0%
going to set ourselves up for success
 
01:43:17.510 --> 01:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
better that way so unless there are any
 
01:43:18.870 --> 01:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
questions that's really all i wanted to
 
01:43:20.310 --> 01:43:20.320 align:start position:0%
say to you this morning thank you madam
 
01:43:24.709 --> 01:43:24.719 align:start position:0%

some combination of wednesday thursday
 
01:50:03.109 --> 01:50:03.119 align:start position:0%

representative rhodes you have a motion
 
01:50:11.830 --> 01:50:11.840 align:start position:0%
on house bill 1171
 
01:50:14.550 --> 01:50:14.560 align:start position:0%
madam chair yes just i just want to make
 
01:50:15.430 --> 01:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
sure we
 
01:50:17.430 --> 01:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
do things correctly but it's my
 
01:50:18.870 --> 01:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
understanding that the rest of these
 
01:50:20.790 --> 01:50:20.800 align:start position:0%
bills are time certain for exec session
 
01:50:23.030 --> 01:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure we can go forward
 
01:50:25.189 --> 01:50:25.199 align:start position:0%
that's what i was thought also if it's
 
01:50:27.430 --> 01:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
noticed on the public hearing that exact
 
01:50:30.229 --> 01:50:30.239 align:start position:0%
sessions could occur at any time
 
01:50:30.239 --> 01:50:33.109 align:start position:0%
sessions could occur at any time
that's

01:50:33.109 --> 01:50:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:34.550 --> 01:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
yeah i
 
01:50:36.830 --> 01:50:36.840 align:start position:0%
i think that is correct
 
01:50:40.950 --> 01:50:40.960 align:start position:0%
um i think we should take a break
 
01:50:42.629 --> 01:50:42.639 align:start position:0%
if anyone wants them there are muffins
 
01:50:45.030 --> 01:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
in the office because we're going to go
 
01:50:47.350 --> 01:50:47.360 align:start position:0%
through at least five bills before we
 
01:50:49.350 --> 01:50:49.360 align:start position:0%
break for lunch
 
01:50:50.950 --> 01:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
and representative fellows can work on
 
01:51:17.910 --> 01:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:19.910 --> 01:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
we'll take at least a 15-minute break
 
01:51:22.550 --> 01:51:22.560 align:start position:0%
and i will call the clerk and find out
 
01:51:24.790 --> 01:51:24.800 align:start position:0%
the stuff
 
01:51:26.709 --> 01:51:26.719 align:start position:0%
that we know we can handle i mean sit
 
01:51:27.870 --> 01:51:27.880 align:start position:0%

that was brought up during the testimony
 
02:22:56.389 --> 02:22:56.399 align:start position:0%
it's it's pretty straightforward it just
 
02:22:58.389 --> 02:22:58.399 align:start position:0%
basically is saying that
 
02:23:00.150 --> 02:23:00.160 align:start position:0%

when you i shouldn't say when

straightener that you were using
 
02:24:12.950 --> 02:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
that would be an example that they might
 
02:24:14.550 --> 02:24:14.560 align:start position:0%
have used the straightener
 
02:24:16.230 --> 02:24:16.240 align:start position:0%
on your hair and then they have it for

this is an expert follow-up sorry

this is an expert follow-up sorry
follow-up

02:24:31.110 --> 02:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:33.590 --> 02:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
it says
 
02:24:36.870 --> 02:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:38.870 --> 02:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say
 
02:24:42.150 --> 02:24:42.160 align:start position:0%
that 15 is am i just like overthinking
 
02:24:45.590 --> 02:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
this 15 is not tied into 14 in any way
 
02:24:45.600 --> 02:24:46.790 align:start position:0%
this 15 is not tied into 14 in any way
because

02:24:46.790 --> 02:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:24:48.630 --> 02:24:48.640 align:start position:0%
what we're saying is people who engage
 
02:24:50.790 --> 02:24:50.800 align:start position:0%
in blow dry styling and hair styling are
 
02:24:53.270 --> 02:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
exempt from the license
 
02:24:55.110 --> 02:24:55.120 align:start position:0%
and then we say persons who demonstrate
 
02:24:56.950 --> 02:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
the use of cosmetic beauty aid or
 
02:24:59.510 --> 02:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
equipment for the purpose
 
02:25:01.990 --> 02:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
to the public such beauty equipment
 
02:25:04.550 --> 02:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
that's exempt but those people could
 
02:25:06.710 --> 02:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
also be working in the mall right is
 
02:25:09.190 --> 02:25:09.200 align:start position:0%
that what you're saying
 
02:25:12.950 --> 02:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
all of those exemptions are independent
 
02:25:15.030 --> 02:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
but a person may
 
02:25:15.040 --> 02:25:16.230 align:start position:0%
but a person may
qualify

02:25:16.230 --> 02:25:16.240 align:start position:0%
qualify
 
02:25:18.230 --> 02:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
under more that may perform more than
 
02:25:21.510 --> 02:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
one of those tasks right
 
02:25:23.590 --> 02:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
so my concern with this is that we still
 
02:25:25.910 --> 02:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
have eyelash extension application and
 
02:25:28.309 --> 02:25:28.319 align:start position:0%
i'm not in support of this amendment as
 
02:25:31.270 --> 02:25:31.280 align:start position:0%
long as it involves chemicals in any way
 
02:25:34.150 --> 02:25:34.160 align:start position:0%
and you have to stick those eyelashes on
 
02:25:35.990 --> 02:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
with glue
 
02:25:38.070 --> 02:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
and that's a chemical and it's near the
 
02:25:38.080 --> 02:25:38.870 align:start position:0%
and that's a chemical and it's near the
eye

02:25:38.870 --> 02:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
eye
 
02:25:41.190 --> 02:25:41.200 align:start position:0%
and i'm sorry to see this again in here
 
02:25:43.190 --> 02:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
so i would not support this amendment
 
02:25:44.950 --> 02:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
based on that thank you
 
02:25:48.710 --> 02:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:50.630 --> 02:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
representative horrigan
 
02:25:52.389 --> 02:25:52.399 align:start position:0%
let's just have a quick question
 
02:25:53.910 --> 02:25:53.920 align:start position:0%
representative rhodes referred to a dry
 
02:25:55.830 --> 02:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
bar and i did actually
 
02:25:58.070 --> 02:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
i was actually here substituting that
 
02:25:59.429 --> 02:25:59.439 align:start position:0%
day and i guess i heard the whole
 
02:26:00.870 --> 02:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
hearing on youtube while driving over
 
02:26:03.910 --> 02:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
here so what exactly is a dry bar and
 
02:26:06.469 --> 02:26:06.479 align:start position:0%
a blow dry bar a blow dryer where
 
02:26:09.270 --> 02:26:09.280 align:start position:0%
someone goes to get their hair styled
 
02:26:10.950 --> 02:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
but not
 
02:26:14.070 --> 02:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
colored or permed and okay that's that
 
02:26:15.429 --> 02:26:15.439 align:start position:0%
correct representative
 
02:26:17.190 --> 02:26:17.200 align:start position:0%
thank you so
 
02:26:17.200 --> 02:26:18.790 align:start position:0%
thank you so
the

02:26:18.790 --> 02:26:18.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:26:21.670 --> 02:26:21.680 align:start position:0%
one of these particular
 
02:26:24.150 --> 02:26:24.160 align:start position:0%
businesses would not offer
 
02:26:25.349 --> 02:26:25.359 align:start position:0%
you would not be able to go and have
 
02:26:26.469 --> 02:26:26.479 align:start position:0%
your hair permed you'd not be able to
 
02:26:28.070 --> 02:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
have your hair colored you would not be
 
02:26:29.990 --> 02:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
able to have your hair cut
 
02:26:32.630 --> 02:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
there would not be any any kind of of
 
02:26:34.309 --> 02:26:34.319 align:start position:0%
chemical service at all whereas if you
 
02:26:37.750 --> 02:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
go into a salon you very well may
 
02:26:38.950 --> 02:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
walk out and have some kind of a
 
02:26:40.950 --> 02:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
chemical burn that that unfortunately
 
02:26:42.389 --> 02:26:42.399 align:start position:0%
does happen regardless of how long a
 
02:26:44.870 --> 02:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
person is licensed it happens
 
02:26:47.190 --> 02:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
this would not that would not be able to
 
02:26:49.349 --> 02:26:49.359 align:start position:0%
happen here and as far as the eyelash
 
02:26:52.469 --> 02:26:52.479 align:start position:0%
extensions um i've been trying to find
 
02:26:54.870 --> 02:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
what these actual 10 states are but i'm
 
02:26:56.550 --> 02:26:56.560 align:start position:0%
unfortunate i'm having trouble but i do
 
02:26:58.630 --> 02:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
know that we are only one of 10 states
 
02:27:00.309 --> 02:27:00.319 align:start position:0%
that still require that you have to have
 
02:27:01.750 --> 02:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
a license to do that
 
02:27:03.670 --> 02:27:03.680 align:start position:0%
and as an example california i think we
 
02:27:05.830 --> 02:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
would all agree is an incredibly
 
02:27:08.630 --> 02:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
regulated state and they have
 
02:27:10.230 --> 02:27:10.240 align:start position:0%
eyelash bars
 
02:27:11.910 --> 02:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
everywhere it's it's one of the new
 
02:27:13.670 --> 02:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
trends that you see popping up all over
 
02:27:14.950 --> 02:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
hollywood and you do not have to have a
 
02:27:17.510 --> 02:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
license to open up one of those
 
02:27:19.670 --> 02:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
kind of places and in here you would be
 
02:27:22.389 --> 02:27:22.399 align:start position:0%
able to do that if you wanted
 
02:27:26.710 --> 02:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
and well so why do we thank you thanks
 
02:27:29.349 --> 02:27:29.359 align:start position:0%

representative lackas
 
02:28:32.790 --> 02:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
um maybe i'm confused but i'm looking at
 
02:28:35.510 --> 02:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
the original bill and it appears that it
 
02:28:37.030 --> 02:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
includes the eyelash extension the
 
02:28:38.230 --> 02:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
original bill so i don't know the
 
02:28:40.469 --> 02:28:40.479 align:start position:0%
amendment affects that
 
02:28:43.429 --> 02:28:43.439 align:start position:0%
is that am i missing something
 
02:28:44.710 --> 02:28:44.720 align:start position:0%
representative rhodes if you could
 
02:28:47.349 --> 02:28:47.359 align:start position:0%
explain that
 
02:28:49.030 --> 02:28:49.040 align:start position:0%
thank you you you're not missing
 
02:28:52.790 --> 02:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:55.590 --> 02:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
representative allegro
 
02:28:57.270 --> 02:28:57.280 align:start position:0%
i don't really pay much attention when i
 
02:28:59.429 --> 02:28:59.439 align:start position:0%
go down that aisle in the grocery store
 
02:29:01.510 --> 02:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
but um
 
02:29:03.830 --> 02:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
are not eyelash extension
 
02:29:05.750 --> 02:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
kits also
 
02:29:08.070 --> 02:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
on sale to the general public in cvs and
 
02:29:10.710 --> 02:29:10.720 align:start position:0%
places like that
 
02:29:12.309 --> 02:29:12.319 align:start position:0%
yes they are so
 
02:29:14.469 --> 02:29:14.479 align:start position:0%
basically you you are able to go into
 
02:29:16.070 --> 02:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
any store
 
02:29:17.750 --> 02:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
and you could buy
 
02:29:19.510 --> 02:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
a box of hair color and you could go
 
02:29:21.190 --> 02:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
home and do that yourself now those do
 
02:29:21.200 --> 02:29:22.630 align:start position:0%
home and do that yourself now those do
have

02:29:22.630 --> 02:29:22.640 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:29:25.429 --> 02:29:25.439 align:start position:0%
they are not is i would say as potent
 
02:29:27.270 --> 02:29:27.280 align:start position:0%
is necessarily whenever you go in and
 
02:29:28.950 --> 02:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
have your hair done in a professional
 
02:29:31.429 --> 02:29:31.439 align:start position:0%
salon however bleaches bleach
 
02:29:33.750 --> 02:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
and the peroxide that is used as
 
02:29:35.429 --> 02:29:35.439 align:start position:0%
you know developer i should say is used
 
02:29:36.630 --> 02:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
is the same
 
02:29:38.150 --> 02:29:38.160 align:start position:0%
they do have different strands of it 10
 
02:29:40.309 --> 02:29:40.319 align:start position:0%
20 30 and so forth
 
02:29:42.389 --> 02:29:42.399 align:start position:0%
you can go in and
 
02:29:44.469 --> 02:29:44.479 align:start position:0%
buy eyelashes and yes it does come with
 
02:29:46.790 --> 02:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
glue but some of course are magnetic and
 
02:29:50.870 --> 02:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
so forth as as far as the the potency of
 
02:29:53.190 --> 02:29:53.200 align:start position:0%
that particular glue i i don't i don't
 
02:29:54.790 --> 02:29:54.800 align:start position:0%
know i'm not an expert in that but i do
 
02:29:56.070 --> 02:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
know that
 
02:29:57.750 --> 02:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
it also would require
 
02:29:59.349 --> 02:29:59.359 align:start position:0%
you know adult supervision if you're a
 
02:30:01.510 --> 02:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
child so we did have
 
02:30:03.750 --> 02:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
the representative did speak of having
 
02:30:05.270 --> 02:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
somebody that came in and had that
 
02:30:06.790 --> 02:30:06.800 align:start position:0%
happen where there was an issue with the
 
02:30:06.800 --> 02:30:07.670 align:start position:0%
happen where there was an issue with the
glue

02:30:07.670 --> 02:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
glue
 
02:30:09.910 --> 02:30:09.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know the age of that person
 
02:30:11.429 --> 02:30:11.439 align:start position:0%
but i would have to think that if
 
02:30:13.190 --> 02:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
somebody was going in and having eyelash
 
02:30:13.200 --> 02:30:14.870 align:start position:0%
somebody was going in and having eyelash
extensions

02:30:14.870 --> 02:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
extensions
 
02:30:16.950 --> 02:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
put on they would at least be of age to
 
02:30:18.230 --> 02:30:18.240 align:start position:0%

president

02:30:25.590 --> 02:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:28.389 --> 02:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
thank you um during the testimony i did
 
02:30:32.309 --> 02:30:32.319 align:start position:0%
object to chemicals in this bill and so
 
02:30:32.319 --> 02:30:33.750 align:start position:0%
object to chemicals in this bill and so
um

02:30:33.750 --> 02:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:33.760 --> 02:30:34.469 align:start position:0%
um
i

02:30:34.469 --> 02:30:34.479 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:30:36.469 --> 02:30:36.479 align:start position:0%
had hoped that we would take the eyelash
 
02:30:38.790 --> 02:30:38.800 align:start position:0%
extension out and for clarification i
 
02:30:41.110 --> 02:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
like eyelash extension
 
02:30:43.270 --> 02:30:43.280 align:start position:0%
and artificial lashes that you buy at
 
02:30:45.190 --> 02:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
the grocery store are quite two very
 
02:30:47.830 --> 02:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
different things
 
02:30:50.950 --> 02:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
the eyelash extension are individuals
 
02:30:53.750 --> 02:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
hairs that are glued to the individual
 
02:30:53.760 --> 02:30:55.590 align:start position:0%
hairs that are glued to the individual
eyelash

02:30:55.590 --> 02:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
eyelash
 
02:30:57.670 --> 02:30:57.680 align:start position:0%
and it's done very quickly and it's done
 
02:31:00.150 --> 02:31:00.160 align:start position:0%
with a very different kind of glue that
 
02:31:03.030 --> 02:31:03.040 align:start position:0%
you would buy on the supermarket shelves
 
02:31:05.349 --> 02:31:05.359 align:start position:0%
so i'm sorry that
 
02:31:08.230 --> 02:31:08.240 align:start position:0%
there's this misunderstanding
 
02:31:10.710 --> 02:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
but eyelash extensions are quite
 
02:31:13.030 --> 02:31:13.040 align:start position:0%
different from the things that you buy
 
02:31:15.429 --> 02:31:15.439 align:start position:0%
at the grocery store and the chemicals
 
02:31:17.830 --> 02:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
involved the glue involved
 
02:31:20.230 --> 02:31:20.240 align:start position:0%
is uh significantly stronger because
 
02:31:21.830 --> 02:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
they stay on
 
02:31:26.710 --> 02:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:27.590 --> 02:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:31:29.429 --> 02:31:29.439 align:start position:0%
for that i wasn't certainly was not
 
02:31:31.590 --> 02:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
aware of that for one
 
02:31:33.670 --> 02:31:33.680 align:start position:0%

02:31:38.230 --> 02:31:38.240 align:start position:0%
um i'm not going to repeat the things
 
02:31:40.950 --> 02:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
that have already been said but on
 
02:31:43.910 --> 02:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
the original bill on line five of the
 
02:31:45.670 --> 02:31:45.680 align:start position:0%
first page
 
02:31:49.590 --> 02:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
it defines blow drying as including
 
02:31:51.750 --> 02:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
hair extensions
 
02:31:51.760 --> 02:31:52.790 align:start position:0%
hair extensions
and

02:31:52.790 --> 02:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:31:55.030 --> 02:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
i just don't in which
 
02:31:58.469 --> 02:31:58.479 align:start position:0%
can be applied with glue also and i just
 
02:32:00.150 --> 02:32:00.160 align:start position:0%
i just think that
 
02:32:00.160 --> 02:32:01.910 align:start position:0%
i just think that
including

02:32:01.910 --> 02:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
including
 
02:32:03.590 --> 02:32:03.600 align:start position:0%

02:33:53.600 --> 02:33:55.349 align:start position:0%

yes

02:33:55.349 --> 02:33:55.359 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:33:59.590 --> 02:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:01.990 --> 02:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
do you wish to speak to your motion
 
02:34:05.510 --> 02:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:07.190 --> 02:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
during the the testimony and even what
 
02:34:08.870 --> 02:34:08.880 align:start position:0%
we've just heard with with the amendment
 
02:34:08.880 --> 02:34:10.710 align:start position:0%
we've just heard with with the amendment
there's

02:34:10.710 --> 02:34:10.720 align:start position:0%
there's
 
02:34:12.070 --> 02:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
i think if your mind is already met up
 
02:34:13.590 --> 02:34:13.600 align:start position:0%
your mind is already made up however if
 
02:34:15.110 --> 02:34:15.120 align:start position:0%
it is not there's a couple of things i
 
02:34:16.469 --> 02:34:16.479 align:start position:0%
would really like to point out and one
 
02:34:18.630 --> 02:34:18.640 align:start position:0%
of them is that
 
02:34:20.790 --> 02:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
this would not allow somebody to go in
 
02:34:22.630 --> 02:34:22.640 align:start position:0%
and have their hair cut you're not going
 
02:34:24.309 --> 02:34:24.319 align:start position:0%
to have your hair colored
 
02:34:25.910 --> 02:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
you are going to go in and have your
 
02:34:28.550 --> 02:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
hair styled as if you were going on if
 
02:34:29.750 --> 02:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
you're going to the prom maybe you're
 
02:34:32.790 --> 02:34:32.800 align:start position:0%
going to be on tv for something um
 
02:34:34.469 --> 02:34:34.479 align:start position:0%
the same thing with you know makeup
 
02:34:35.990 --> 02:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
application there was there was talk
 
02:34:37.670 --> 02:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
about if you are
 
02:34:39.110 --> 02:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
you know going to be on tv doing an
 
02:34:39.120 --> 02:34:40.150 align:start position:0%
you know going to be on tv doing an
interview

02:34:40.150 --> 02:34:40.160 align:start position:0%
interview
 
02:34:41.590 --> 02:34:41.600 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire you
 
02:34:42.710 --> 02:34:42.720 align:start position:0%
actually would have to have a
 
02:34:44.630 --> 02:34:44.640 align:start position:0%
professional license to be able to do
 
02:34:46.230 --> 02:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
theoretical makeup
 
02:34:46.240 --> 02:34:47.190 align:start position:0%
theoretical makeup
and

02:34:47.190 --> 02:34:47.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:34:48.710 --> 02:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
you know you can actually take classes
 
02:34:50.309 --> 02:34:50.319 align:start position:0%
to do that you don't have to be licensed
 
02:34:51.990 --> 02:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
in order to do that
 
02:34:53.110 --> 02:34:53.120 align:start position:0%
but here you would actually have to be
 
02:34:55.270 --> 02:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
licensed this would stop that this would
 
02:34:56.790 --> 02:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
make somebody that
 
02:34:59.750 --> 02:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
maybe used to have a cosmetology license
 
02:35:01.830 --> 02:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
and for whatever reason it has it has
 
02:35:05.030 --> 02:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
lapsed it's expired um they may years
 
02:35:06.389 --> 02:35:06.399 align:start position:0%
later change their mind and want to be
 
02:35:07.830 --> 02:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
able to get back into the profession
 
02:35:10.630 --> 02:35:10.640 align:start position:0%
this this would make that possible uh it
 
02:35:14.230 --> 02:35:14.240 align:start position:0%
also you would not have to go through
 
02:35:15.990 --> 02:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
the entire the entire process of being
 
02:35:18.070 --> 02:35:18.080 align:start position:0%
licensed in the expense that can be you
 
02:35:20.309 --> 02:35:20.319 align:start position:0%
know 21 to 25 000
 
02:35:22.309 --> 02:35:22.319 align:start position:0%
in in order to have that happen
 
02:35:22.319 --> 02:35:23.110 align:start position:0%
in in order to have that happen
um

02:35:23.110 --> 02:35:23.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:24.469 --> 02:35:24.479 align:start position:0%
the other thing that is very very
 
02:35:26.309 --> 02:35:26.319 align:start position:0%
important that i want to point out is we
 
02:35:27.990 --> 02:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
heard testimony
 
02:35:30.550 --> 02:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
and it said that
 
02:35:30.560 --> 02:35:31.270 align:start position:0%
and it said that
they

02:35:31.270 --> 02:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:35:32.309 --> 02:35:32.319 align:start position:0%
they learn
 
02:35:34.469 --> 02:35:34.479 align:start position:0%
how to identify and treat
 
02:35:36.790 --> 02:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
conditions of the scalp that is
 
02:35:39.030 --> 02:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely false that is illegal a
 
02:35:41.510 --> 02:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
cosmetologist is not allowed in any way
 
02:35:43.830 --> 02:35:43.840 align:start position:0%
shape or form to treat
 
02:35:46.230 --> 02:35:46.240 align:start position:0%
a condition they are not doctors
 
02:35:47.910 --> 02:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
if somebody come in and had head lice
 
02:35:49.429 --> 02:35:49.439 align:start position:0%
they would have to ask that person to
 
02:35:52.469 --> 02:35:52.479 align:start position:0%
leave they are not allowed to treat that
 
02:35:52.479 --> 02:35:57.830 align:start position:0%
leave they are not allowed to treat that
um

02:35:57.830 --> 02:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:59.910 --> 02:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
i think there's more on here but i think
 
02:36:03.030 --> 02:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
we already have the gist of it thank you
 
02:36:05.670 --> 02:36:05.680 align:start position:0%

ought to pass with the amendment
 
02:36:23.750 --> 02:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
i will speak briefly on that amendment
 
02:36:25.990 --> 02:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
as now that is part to the bill uh
 
02:36:28.309 --> 02:36:28.319 align:start position:0%
dealing with the eyelash extensions
 
02:36:30.870 --> 02:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
and i think we've heard
 
02:36:32.710 --> 02:36:32.720 align:start position:0%
very specifically that
 
02:36:35.429 --> 02:36:35.439 align:start position:0%
eyelash extensions are totally different
 
02:36:38.309 --> 02:36:38.319 align:start position:0%
than eyelash kits that you buy in the
 
02:36:38.319 --> 02:36:39.990 align:start position:0%
than eyelash kits that you buy in the
store

02:36:39.990 --> 02:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
store
 
02:36:42.230 --> 02:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
and i think we've heard in the testimony
 
02:36:43.590 --> 02:36:43.600 align:start position:0%
uh maybe
 
02:36:45.110 --> 02:36:45.120 align:start position:0%
from a member of this committee about
 
02:36:47.750 --> 02:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
isla someone's eye being glued shut and
 
02:36:51.670 --> 02:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
having to be open due to the
 
02:36:53.670 --> 02:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
potency of the glue used
 
02:36:55.590 --> 02:36:55.600 align:start position:0%
representative goalie that
 
02:36:57.270 --> 02:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
although it's true that someone had to
 
02:37:00.630 --> 02:37:00.640 align:start position:0%
cut an eye eyelid open it was
 
02:37:02.710 --> 02:37:02.720 align:start position:0%
there was no testimony as to how that
 
02:37:02.720 --> 02:37:06.790 align:start position:0%
there was no testimony as to how that
happened

02:37:06.790 --> 02:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:09.030 --> 02:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
point well taken but it was brought to
 
02:37:11.510 --> 02:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
our attention that that had happened
 
02:37:13.750 --> 02:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
so for those reasons uh with this being
 
02:37:15.190 --> 02:37:15.200 align:start position:0%
part still part of the amendment if it
 
02:37:17.030 --> 02:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
had been removed i would have supported
 
02:37:18.870 --> 02:37:18.880 align:start position:0%
the rest of it but i cannot with this in
 
02:37:20.389 --> 02:37:20.399 align:start position:0%
the amendment thank you
 
02:37:22.630 --> 02:37:22.640 align:start position:0%
thank you representative marsh uh thank
 
02:37:24.710 --> 02:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and uh while i am
 
02:37:27.110 --> 02:37:27.120 align:start position:0%
concerned about eyes being glued shut my
 
02:37:28.309 --> 02:37:28.319 align:start position:0%
biggest problem with this bill is
 
02:37:29.910 --> 02:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
actually a different section of the bill
 
02:37:31.910 --> 02:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
it's section eight of the bill we heard
 
02:37:33.910 --> 02:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
testimony from the department of justice
 
02:37:35.110 --> 02:37:35.120 align:start position:0%
that this would give the attorney
 
02:37:37.349 --> 02:37:37.359 align:start position:0%
general a new area of enforcement i
 
02:37:39.750 --> 02:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
think the regulation of speech that is
 
02:37:41.190 --> 02:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
being done in this section of the bill
 
02:37:43.110 --> 02:37:43.120 align:start position:0%
could easily become a violation of the
 
02:37:43.120 --> 02:37:44.830 align:start position:0%
could easily become a violation of the
first

02:37:44.830 --> 02:37:44.840 align:start position:0%
first
 
02:37:48.309 --> 02:37:48.319 align:start position:0%
amendment took it out completely
 
02:37:49.830 --> 02:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
section 8
 
02:37:51.429 --> 02:37:51.439 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:37:53.190 --> 02:37:53.200 align:start position:0%
i'm glad to oblige
 
02:37:53.200 --> 02:37:55.190 align:start position:0%
i'm glad to oblige
representative

02:37:55.190 --> 02:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:37:57.270 --> 02:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um
 
02:38:00.550 --> 02:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
i still have concerns about the bill
 
02:38:03.910 --> 02:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
just something as simple as a shampoo
 
02:38:06.790 --> 02:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
some people have allergies i'm not sure
 
02:38:09.270 --> 02:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
if someone who has not
 
02:38:11.750 --> 02:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
had more extensive training would
 
02:38:11.760 --> 02:38:13.270 align:start position:0%
had more extensive training would
recognize

02:38:13.270 --> 02:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
recognize
 
02:38:15.349 --> 02:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
if an allergy shows up
 
02:38:18.389 --> 02:38:18.399 align:start position:0%
to something as simple as shampoo
 
02:38:22.070 --> 02:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
i also heard during testimony that
 
02:38:24.550 --> 02:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
if someone is not licensed
 
02:38:27.510 --> 02:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
and a client has an issue
 
02:38:28.870 --> 02:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
that it would
 
02:38:31.670 --> 02:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
make it more difficult for them to
 
02:38:33.830 --> 02:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
bring an action against someone who has
 
02:38:35.190 --> 02:38:35.200 align:start position:0%
damaged them
 
02:38:38.710 --> 02:38:38.720 align:start position:0%
so those are my concerns
 
02:38:41.670 --> 02:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
thank you any other comments questions
 
02:38:43.830 --> 02:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
representative rhodes are you
 
02:38:46.630 --> 02:38:46.640 align:start position:0%
thank you um in in response to
 
02:38:49.830 --> 02:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
to the comment that was just made
 
02:38:51.349 --> 02:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
i i'm sure i would be corrected if i'm
 
02:38:53.110 --> 02:38:53.120 align:start position:0%
wrong but
 
02:38:55.110 --> 02:38:55.120 align:start position:0%
i believe that a person can bring legal
 
02:38:56.710 --> 02:38:56.720 align:start position:0%
action pretty much against anybody
 
02:38:59.270 --> 02:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
especially if there was damages done i
 
02:39:01.030 --> 02:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
don't think if if you're licensed or not
 
02:39:02.870 --> 02:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
would have any effect on that and
 
02:39:04.230 --> 02:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
actually i would think that if you were
 
02:39:06.630 --> 02:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
not and there was some damage that done
 
02:39:07.990 --> 02:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
i'm pretty sure there'd be a line of
 
02:39:09.590 --> 02:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
attorneys waiting to be able to bring
 
02:39:14.389 --> 02:39:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:18.389 --> 02:39:18.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:20.070 --> 02:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
uh representative fellows will then show
 
02:39:22.389 --> 02:39:22.399 align:start position:0%
it yeah i would just like to add that
 
02:39:25.510 --> 02:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
you know my objection is to
 
02:39:27.349 --> 02:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
the um
 
02:39:30.309 --> 02:39:30.319 align:start position:0%
the eyelastic extensions
 
02:39:33.429 --> 02:39:33.439 align:start position:0%
because of the glue and i think that
 
02:39:35.990 --> 02:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
that blow drying
 
02:39:40.230 --> 02:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
could could include glue so i don't
 
02:39:43.030 --> 02:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
you know i don't support that other all
 
02:39:43.040 --> 02:39:44.230 align:start position:0%
you know i don't support that other all
also

02:39:44.230 --> 02:39:44.240 align:start position:0%
also
 
02:39:46.389 --> 02:39:46.399 align:start position:0%
thank you brooks i'm sure
 
02:39:48.150 --> 02:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
thank you i don't want to get into a
 
02:39:49.830 --> 02:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
whole debate here but
 
02:39:52.469 --> 02:39:52.479 align:start position:0%
i will acknowledge that yes lawsuits are
 
02:39:55.190 --> 02:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
possible however that would not prevent
 
02:40:01.190 --> 02:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:04.950 --> 02:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
okay anyone any other comments questions
 
02:40:04.960 --> 02:40:08.870 align:start position:0%
okay anyone any other comments questions
concerns

02:40:11.190 --> 02:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
okay in that case the motion is ought to
 
02:40:13.429 --> 02:40:13.439 align:start position:0%
pass with amendment by representative
 
02:40:15.750 --> 02:40:15.760 align:start position:0%

02:43:00.790 --> 02:43:00.800 align:start position:0%

02:43:03.269 --> 02:43:03.279 align:start position:0%
aspects of what we heard in
 
02:43:06.870 --> 02:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
testimony in reference to
 
02:43:09.030 --> 02:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
especially in reference to the the way
 
02:43:10.950 --> 02:43:10.960 align:start position:0%
the board was altered in the original
 
02:43:10.960 --> 02:43:11.910 align:start position:0%
the board was altered in the original
bill

02:43:11.910 --> 02:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:43:14.950 --> 02:43:14.960 align:start position:0%
and in recognizing um
 
02:43:17.110 --> 02:43:17.120 align:start position:0%
that that took things a little too far
 
02:43:19.269 --> 02:43:19.279 align:start position:0%
the amendment restores the
 
02:43:22.710 --> 02:43:22.720 align:start position:0%
midwife advisory council back to its
 
02:43:25.429 --> 02:43:25.439 align:start position:0%
original makeup of six members but does
 
02:43:28.070 --> 02:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
now include two alternates as we are
 
02:43:29.269 --> 02:43:29.279 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
02:43:32.790 --> 02:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
add alternates to the various boards
 
02:43:32.800 --> 02:43:34.469 align:start position:0%
add alternates to the various boards
um

02:43:34.469 --> 02:43:34.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:37.590 --> 02:43:37.600 align:start position:0%
and it defines what the alternates
 
02:43:40.790 --> 02:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
are in in reference to
 
02:43:40.800 --> 02:43:41.750 align:start position:0%
are in in reference to
um

02:43:41.750 --> 02:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:45.910 --> 02:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:48.070 --> 02:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
the other part was during the original
 
02:43:49.349 --> 02:43:49.359 align:start position:0%
bill there were sections that were
 
02:43:49.359 --> 02:43:50.710 align:start position:0%
bill there were sections that were
directed

02:43:50.710 --> 02:43:50.720 align:start position:0%
directed
 
02:43:54.070 --> 02:43:54.080 align:start position:0%
specifically to the executive director
 
02:43:55.590 --> 02:43:55.600 align:start position:0%
and we felt that there were some areas
 
02:43:57.269 --> 02:43:57.279 align:start position:0%
where it really should read executive
 
02:43:58.870 --> 02:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
director in consultation with the
 
02:43:58.880 --> 02:44:00.469 align:start position:0%
director in consultation with the
council

02:44:00.469 --> 02:44:00.479 align:start position:0%
council
 
02:44:03.030 --> 02:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
in those locations
 
02:44:05.750 --> 02:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
that involve aspects of the specific
 
02:44:09.269 --> 02:44:09.279 align:start position:0%
profession and not administrative
 
02:44:11.990 --> 02:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
pursuits were amended
 
02:44:14.309 --> 02:44:14.319 align:start position:0%
into or were modified in this amendment
 
02:44:16.309 --> 02:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
to read executive director in
 
02:44:18.710 --> 02:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
consultation with the board and that
 
02:44:20.630 --> 02:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
occurred in roughly
 
02:44:23.990 --> 02:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
nine or ten spots we also discovered an
 
02:44:26.550 --> 02:44:26.560 align:start position:0%
error in the original drafting
 
02:44:26.560 --> 02:44:27.910 align:start position:0%
error in the original drafting
in

02:44:27.910 --> 02:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:44:31.670 --> 02:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
line 24 on page three where it directed
 
02:44:33.990 --> 02:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
uh the fee that was involved it
 
02:44:35.510 --> 02:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
referenced a section of law that was
 
02:44:35.520 --> 02:44:37.269 align:start position:0%
referenced a section of law that was
inappropriate

02:44:37.269 --> 02:44:37.279 align:start position:0%
inappropriate
 
02:44:37.279 --> 02:44:38.710 align:start position:0%
inappropriate
so

02:44:38.710 --> 02:44:38.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:44:42.070 --> 02:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
we fixed that to rsa 310 which is the
 
02:44:46.469 --> 02:44:46.479 align:start position:0%
rsa that establishes oplc's ability to
 
02:44:49.830 --> 02:44:49.840 align:start position:0%
set the renewal fees
 
02:44:52.710 --> 02:44:52.720 align:start position:0%
for the various boards
 
02:44:55.670 --> 02:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
that is the gist of the amendment
 
02:44:57.190 --> 02:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
thank you reference rhodes do we should
 
02:44:58.870 --> 02:44:58.880 align:start position:0%
speak to your second
 
02:45:00.790 --> 02:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman representative
 
02:45:02.230 --> 02:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
pearson said it all
 
02:45:02.240 --> 02:45:03.190 align:start position:0%
pearson said it all
okay

02:45:03.190 --> 02:45:03.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:45:05.670 --> 02:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
that's pearson wrote
 
02:45:07.670 --> 02:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
yes okay any
 
02:45:09.670 --> 02:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
comments questions of scitec and then
 
02:45:12.550 --> 02:45:12.560 align:start position:0%
marsh uh i'll i've i'm going to take
 
02:45:15.190 --> 02:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
this opportunity to say something
 
02:45:17.269 --> 02:45:17.279 align:start position:0%
slightly off topic i'll say it once for
 
02:45:19.750 --> 02:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
the day and that's that i've grown
 
02:45:21.429 --> 02:45:21.439 align:start position:0%
increasingly uncomfortable within
 
02:45:24.870 --> 02:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
consultation with who has the final word
 
02:45:26.710 --> 02:45:26.720 align:start position:0%
are we talking about discipline are we
 
02:45:28.630 --> 02:45:28.640 align:start position:0%
talking about i understand some of this
 
02:45:30.070 --> 02:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
has already been answered but the
 
02:45:32.870 --> 02:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
questions come up is this about
 
02:45:32.880 --> 02:45:33.830 align:start position:0%
questions come up is this about
scope

02:45:33.830 --> 02:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
scope
 
02:45:36.070 --> 02:45:36.080 align:start position:0%
scope practice is it
 
02:45:39.670 --> 02:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
where does administration blend into
 
02:45:41.990 --> 02:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
this lack of quorum business i think
 
02:45:43.910 --> 02:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
this is the it is a
 
02:45:46.550 --> 02:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
difficult issue i'm not sure i'm happy
 
02:45:48.550 --> 02:45:48.560 align:start position:0%
with this solution i don't i'm not going
 
02:45:50.469 --> 02:45:50.479 align:start position:0%
to man the ramparts on this thing but
 
02:45:52.870 --> 02:45:52.880 align:start position:0%
i'm just uncomfortable with in
 
02:45:56.150 --> 02:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
consultation with as a substitute for a
 
02:45:58.790 --> 02:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
more thorough analysis of how this
 
02:46:01.670 --> 02:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
situation should be handled on these
 
02:46:03.030 --> 02:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
on these
 
02:46:05.269 --> 02:46:05.279 align:start position:0%
orphan boards and i'm i'm done for the
 
02:46:07.830 --> 02:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
day on that topic
 
02:46:09.510 --> 02:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
02:46:12.070 --> 02:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair unfortunately i
 
02:46:13.590 --> 02:46:13.600 align:start position:0%
don't think i can support either this
 
02:46:16.070 --> 02:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
amendment or the bill as amended
 
02:46:17.510 --> 02:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
unlike many of the boards that we've
 
02:46:19.110 --> 02:46:19.120 align:start position:0%
been discussing today this was not
 
02:46:21.110 --> 02:46:21.120 align:start position:0%
brought to us because of a quorum issue
 
02:46:23.429 --> 02:46:23.439 align:start position:0%
opal say tell us that and they sent us a
 
02:46:26.230 --> 02:46:26.240 align:start position:0%
letter dated january 20 20th that the
 
02:46:27.910 --> 02:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
reason they brought this to us is their
 
02:46:29.670 --> 02:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
concern about anti-trust issues is
 
02:46:31.510 --> 02:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
brought forward by north carolina state
 
02:46:34.870 --> 02:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
board of dental examiners versus the ftc
 
02:46:34.880 --> 02:46:35.670 align:start position:0%
board of dental examiners versus the ftc
uh

02:46:35.670 --> 02:46:35.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:46:37.830 --> 02:46:37.840 align:start position:0%
i think those concerns are overblown
 
02:46:39.750 --> 02:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
because the midwives in new hampshire
 
02:46:41.830 --> 02:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
are providing a service at a lower cost
 
02:46:43.510 --> 02:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
than the alternatives they're providing
 
02:46:46.230 --> 02:46:46.240 align:start position:0%
it in some of the maternity deserts of
 
02:46:47.990 --> 02:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
the state where women do not have good
 
02:46:49.830 --> 02:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
access to maternity care for instance
 
02:46:51.910 --> 02:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
where i live it is well over an hour's
 
02:46:53.510 --> 02:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
drive to where maternity care would be
 
02:46:55.910 --> 02:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
accessible and that's highly problematic
 
02:46:57.590 --> 02:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
for a great many of the young families
 
02:46:59.269 --> 02:46:59.279 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire i don't
 
02:47:01.030 --> 02:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
believe this bill is ready at this time
 
02:47:02.469 --> 02:47:02.479 align:start position:0%
i think that what we ought to do is send
 
02:47:04.389 --> 02:47:04.399 align:start position:0%
this bill to interim study and i will
 
02:47:06.070 --> 02:47:06.080 align:start position:0%
not be voting in favor either of the
 
02:47:08.230 --> 02:47:08.240 align:start position:0%
amendment or of the bill
 
02:47:09.590 --> 02:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:47:11.110 --> 02:47:11.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:47:14.389 --> 02:47:14.399 align:start position:0%
other comments representative schuett
 
02:47:16.469 --> 02:47:16.479 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
02:47:17.990 --> 02:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
i will be voting for the amendment
 
02:47:21.429 --> 02:47:21.439 align:start position:0%
because it does make the bill better
 
02:47:23.190 --> 02:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
i tend to agree with representative
 
02:47:24.710 --> 02:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
marsh that
 
02:47:29.269 --> 02:47:29.279 align:start position:0%
we got an awful lot of feedback from
 
02:47:30.710 --> 02:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
not only
 
02:47:32.070 --> 02:47:32.080 align:start position:0%
midwives but
 
02:47:34.469 --> 02:47:34.479 align:start position:0%
many of their clients that they're not
 
02:47:36.070 --> 02:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
happy with
 
02:47:38.870 --> 02:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
what they see as a loss of autonomy over
 
02:47:40.870 --> 02:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
the profession
 
02:47:44.070 --> 02:47:44.080 align:start position:0%
and i also will point out to
 
02:47:46.710 --> 02:47:46.720 align:start position:0%
representative scitec's comments
 
02:47:46.720 --> 02:47:47.590 align:start position:0%
representative scitec's comments
that

02:47:47.590 --> 02:47:47.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:47:50.389 --> 02:47:50.399 align:start position:0%
we are hopeful that we'll be able to
 
02:47:52.389 --> 02:47:52.399 align:start position:0%
come up with a
 
02:47:54.630 --> 02:47:54.640 align:start position:0%
a group of this committee in the senate
 
02:47:58.550 --> 02:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
the body on the other side of the aisle
 
02:47:58.560 --> 02:47:59.429 align:start position:0%
the body on the other side of the aisle
to

02:47:59.429 --> 02:47:59.439 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:48:03.190 --> 02:48:03.200 align:start position:0%
oversee what's going on at oplc
 
02:48:05.750 --> 02:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
in a in an opportunity for the boards to
 
02:48:07.269 --> 02:48:07.279 align:start position:0%
have a place to
 
02:48:10.070 --> 02:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
bring issues that they are having in in
 
02:48:12.070 --> 02:48:12.080 align:start position:0%
defining the difference between
 
02:48:12.080 --> 02:48:13.510 align:start position:0%
defining the difference between
administrative

02:48:13.510 --> 02:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
02:48:17.750 --> 02:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
and overseeing the professions thank you
 
02:48:17.760 --> 02:48:19.910 align:start position:0%
and overseeing the professions thank you
okay

02:48:19.910 --> 02:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:48:22.309 --> 02:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
i'd like to comment that
 
02:48:25.030 --> 02:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
currently the oplc has a
 
02:48:27.750 --> 02:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
great deal of authority over the boards
 
02:48:30.550 --> 02:48:30.560 align:start position:0%
but it's not entirely clear who does
 
02:48:32.309 --> 02:48:32.319 align:start position:0%
what to whom or when
 
02:48:33.349 --> 02:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
and this
 
02:48:35.830 --> 02:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
this bill among the others that we have
 
02:48:37.750 --> 02:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
is an attempt to clarify the
 
02:48:37.760 --> 02:48:40.070 align:start position:0%
is an attempt to clarify the
responsibility

02:48:40.070 --> 02:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
02:48:42.950 --> 02:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
i've been reading the emails we get from
 
02:48:44.630 --> 02:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
people saying we don't want state
 
02:48:47.590 --> 02:48:47.600 align:start position:0%
control of midwives but
 
02:48:50.150 --> 02:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
that shows a total misunderstanding of
 
02:48:52.309 --> 02:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
the current situation which is that
 
02:48:53.990 --> 02:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
midwives are
 
02:48:57.110 --> 02:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
licensed by the state and controlled by
 
02:49:00.389 --> 02:49:00.399 align:start position:0%
us a board established by the state and
 
02:49:01.910 --> 02:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
the oplc
 
02:49:05.590 --> 02:49:05.600 align:start position:0%
in a rather confusing manner so
 
02:49:08.070 --> 02:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
i'm convinced that a great deal of the
 
02:49:10.630 --> 02:49:10.640 align:start position:0%
opposition to this is
 
02:49:12.550 --> 02:49:12.560 align:start position:0%
due to misunderstandings
 
02:49:14.150 --> 02:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
and the fact that we have a very
 
02:49:16.790 --> 02:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
confusing setup right now because the
 
02:49:16.800 --> 02:49:18.469 align:start position:0%
confusing setup right now because the
oplc

02:49:18.469 --> 02:49:18.479 align:start position:0%
oplc
 
02:49:21.349 --> 02:49:21.359 align:start position:0%
has statutory authority and it's not
 
02:49:22.630 --> 02:49:22.640 align:start position:0%
clear what the
 
02:49:24.550 --> 02:49:24.560 align:start position:0%
how that relates to the authority of the
 
02:49:26.870 --> 02:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
board this and this bill is an attempt
 
02:49:29.110 --> 02:49:29.120 align:start position:0%
to straighten that out
 
02:49:31.750 --> 02:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
any other comments representative laccas
 
02:49:34.389 --> 02:49:34.399 align:start position:0%
briefly i i support the amendment i uh i
 
02:49:35.990 --> 02:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
would have voted against the bill as
 
02:49:38.309 --> 02:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
originally written but
 
02:49:39.830 --> 02:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
because i understood the concerns about
 
02:49:41.429 --> 02:49:41.439 align:start position:0%
the membership of the board but i can
 
02:49:43.269 --> 02:49:43.279 align:start position:0%
support the amendment and then the bill
 
02:49:45.670 --> 02:49:45.680 align:start position:0%

eighteen to one okay the amendment is
 
02:50:44.150 --> 02:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
adopted by a vote of eighteen to one
 
02:50:45.990 --> 02:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
representative pearson you have a motion
 
02:50:48.469 --> 02:50:48.479 align:start position:0%
i have a motion ought to pass
 
02:50:52.469 --> 02:50:52.479 align:start position:0%
with amendment 0 9 4 8 h is there a
 
02:50:52.479 --> 02:50:54.230 align:start position:0%
with amendment 0 9 4 8 h is there a
second

02:50:54.230 --> 02:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
second
 
02:50:54.240 --> 02:50:57.510 align:start position:0%
second
second

02:50:57.510 --> 02:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:59.269 --> 02:50:59.279 align:start position:0%
do you wish to speak to your
 
02:51:02.070 --> 02:51:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:04.469 --> 02:51:04.479 align:start position:0%
i think the the chair brought up a very
 
02:51:05.670 --> 02:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
good point
 
02:51:08.389 --> 02:51:08.399 align:start position:0%
and it really boils down to this
 
02:51:11.429 --> 02:51:11.439 align:start position:0%
if this bill doesn't pass oplc
 
02:51:14.710 --> 02:51:14.720 align:start position:0%
still has authority over this board but
 
02:51:16.950 --> 02:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
they do it with a in a very muddy
 
02:51:19.590 --> 02:51:19.600 align:start position:0%
situation there seems to be a tremendous
 
02:51:21.190 --> 02:51:21.200 align:start position:0%
amount of confusion
 
02:51:23.269 --> 02:51:23.279 align:start position:0%
and complaints on both sides back and
 
02:51:23.279 --> 02:51:24.309 align:start position:0%
and complaints on both sides back and
forth

02:51:24.309 --> 02:51:24.319 align:start position:0%
forth
 
02:51:27.110 --> 02:51:27.120 align:start position:0%
in reference to who's responsible for
 
02:51:29.510 --> 02:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
what where the records are kept who's
 
02:51:32.150 --> 02:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
who's performing what function and this
 
02:51:34.790 --> 02:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
bill clarifies
 
02:51:37.750 --> 02:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
what is the responsibility of oplc and
 
02:51:42.150 --> 02:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
what is the responsibility of the board
 
02:51:45.030 --> 02:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
what this bill does not do is remove it
 
02:51:47.510 --> 02:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
so the choice is simple they continue to
 
02:51:50.950 --> 02:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
operate in a very muddy situation or
 
02:51:53.269 --> 02:51:53.279 align:start position:0%
they can operate with some structure
 
02:51:55.590 --> 02:51:55.600 align:start position:0%
and that's really it the there's no
 
02:51:57.750 --> 02:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
other alternative here so
 
02:51:59.269 --> 02:51:59.279 align:start position:0%
i think that this
 
02:52:02.790 --> 02:52:02.800 align:start position:0%
provides clarification
 
02:52:05.670 --> 02:52:05.680 align:start position:0%
as to who does what it because it allows
 
02:52:07.269 --> 02:52:07.279 align:start position:0%
for independent
 
02:52:10.870 --> 02:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
oversight in reference to complaints
 
02:52:13.190 --> 02:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
and investigations it should it should
 
02:52:13.200 --> 02:52:14.550 align:start position:0%
and investigations it should it should
satisfy

02:52:14.550 --> 02:52:14.560 align:start position:0%
satisfy
 
02:52:16.150 --> 02:52:16.160 align:start position:0%
the ruling that came out of north
 
02:52:16.160 --> 02:52:18.309 align:start position:0%
the ruling that came out of north
carolina

02:52:18.309 --> 02:52:18.319 align:start position:0%
carolina
 
02:52:18.319 --> 02:52:19.990 align:start position:0%
carolina
and

02:52:19.990 --> 02:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:52:22.469 --> 02:52:22.479 align:start position:0%
this will move them forward
 
02:52:24.230 --> 02:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
with what i hope to be a better
 
02:52:24.240 --> 02:52:26.150 align:start position:0%
with what i hope to be a better
relationship

02:52:26.150 --> 02:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
relationship
 
02:52:28.550 --> 02:52:28.560 align:start position:0%
with oplc because they're stuck with
 
02:52:28.560 --> 02:52:31.429 align:start position:0%
with oplc because they're stuck with
oplc

02:52:31.429 --> 02:52:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:32.309 --> 02:52:32.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:52:33.990 --> 02:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
representative rhodes do you wish to
 
02:52:35.349 --> 02:52:35.359 align:start position:0%
speak to your second
 
02:52:37.030 --> 02:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
i'm all set thank you madam chair
 
02:52:38.630 --> 02:52:38.640 align:start position:0%
representative mark
 
02:52:40.469 --> 02:52:40.479 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair i want to
 
02:52:42.630 --> 02:52:42.640 align:start position:0%
expound upon a point that representative
 
02:52:44.070 --> 02:52:44.080 align:start position:0%
scitec made
 
02:52:47.429 --> 02:52:47.439 align:start position:0%
this bill as amended concentrates power
 
02:52:50.630 --> 02:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
in the executive director of oplc
 
02:52:52.550 --> 02:52:52.560 align:start position:0%
now we may have a good person in that
 
02:52:54.550 --> 02:52:54.560 align:start position:0%
position or we may have a bad person in
 
02:52:57.190 --> 02:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
that situation position but if we have
 
02:52:59.830 --> 02:52:59.840 align:start position:0%
someone in that position who for
 
02:53:01.269 --> 02:53:01.279 align:start position:0%
whatever reason
 
02:53:04.469 --> 02:53:04.479 align:start position:0%
does not want to continue midwifery in
 
02:53:04.479 --> 02:53:05.429 align:start position:0%
does not want to continue midwifery in
the

02:53:05.429 --> 02:53:05.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:53:06.790 --> 02:53:06.800 align:start position:0%
way it has been practiced in new
 
02:53:08.630 --> 02:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire for a great many years they
 
02:53:10.630 --> 02:53:10.640 align:start position:0%
would very much have the power to make
 
02:53:12.710 --> 02:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
it almost impossible for these people to
 
02:53:12.720 --> 02:53:13.670 align:start position:0%
it almost impossible for these people to
practice

02:53:13.670 --> 02:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
practice
 
02:53:15.190 --> 02:53:15.200 align:start position:0%
that would have the unintended
 
02:53:17.750 --> 02:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
consequence of removing
 
02:53:20.309 --> 02:53:20.319 align:start position:0%
obstetrical care from some large areas
 
02:53:21.750 --> 02:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
of the state which are currently
 
02:53:24.550 --> 02:53:24.560 align:start position:0%
significantly underserved and i think
 
02:53:26.389 --> 02:53:26.399 align:start position:0%
that is far too much power to
 
02:53:28.070 --> 02:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
concentrate in the hands of a single
 
02:53:30.230 --> 02:53:30.240 align:start position:0%
individual and therefore i do not
 
02:53:32.630 --> 02:53:32.640 align:start position:0%
understand why some of the people who
 
02:53:34.309 --> 02:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
otherwise would oppose government
 
02:53:36.630 --> 02:53:36.640 align:start position:0%
control of
 
02:53:38.790 --> 02:53:38.800 align:start position:0%
various activities in the state would be
 
02:53:40.630 --> 02:53:40.640 align:start position:0%
supportive of this bill as amended so
 
02:53:42.150 --> 02:53:42.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:53:43.750 --> 02:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
i believe most of those people would be
 
02:53:45.190 --> 02:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
perfectly happy to delete the
 
02:53:49.349 --> 02:53:49.359 align:start position:0%
requirement for licensing midwives but
 
02:53:51.429 --> 02:53:51.439 align:start position:0%
which is an entirely different matter
 
02:53:53.190 --> 02:53:53.200 align:start position:0%
representative scientist if we're going
 
02:53:54.950 --> 02:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
to argue about glowing eyelashes are
 
02:53:56.710 --> 02:53:56.720 align:start position:0%
 this is the birth of a human
 
02:53:58.150 --> 02:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
being come on
 
02:53:58.160 --> 02:53:59.269 align:start position:0%
being come on
um

02:53:59.269 --> 02:53:59.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:54:01.990 --> 02:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representatives excuse me
 
02:54:04.630 --> 02:54:04.640 align:start position:0%
to finish
 
02:54:06.389 --> 02:54:06.399 align:start position:0%
representatives show it when you get
 
02:54:08.469 --> 02:54:08.479 align:start position:0%
together with the body on the other side
 
02:54:11.030 --> 02:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
of the wall
 
02:54:12.630 --> 02:54:12.640 align:start position:0%
see if you can come up with a template
 
02:54:16.790 --> 02:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:18.389 --> 02:54:18.399 align:start position:0%
yes represent
 
02:54:20.630 --> 02:54:20.640 align:start position:0%
just briefly representative scitec it is
 
02:54:23.990 --> 02:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:25.750 --> 02:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
other comments
 
02:54:31.670 --> 02:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:33.590 --> 02:54:33.600 align:start position:0%
it would be possible under this theory
 
02:54:33.600 --> 02:54:35.030 align:start position:0%
it would be possible under this theory
then

02:54:35.030 --> 02:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:54:37.349 --> 02:54:37.359 align:start position:0%
for the director of oplc to eliminate
 
02:54:39.910 --> 02:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
the profession of electrician it could
 
02:54:42.230 --> 02:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
eliminate the profession of plumber
 
02:54:44.469 --> 02:54:44.479 align:start position:0%
eliminate a whole bunch of professions
 
02:54:46.389 --> 02:54:46.399 align:start position:0%
there's no there's nothing in this
 
02:54:46.399 --> 02:54:48.070 align:start position:0%
there's no there's nothing in this
statute

02:54:48.070 --> 02:54:48.080 align:start position:0%
statute
 
02:54:51.990 --> 02:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
that directs or or makes clear in any
 
02:54:55.349 --> 02:54:55.359 align:start position:0%
way that the intention is to remove this
 
02:54:57.429 --> 02:54:57.439 align:start position:0%
profession and i think that is just
 
02:54:59.670 --> 02:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
tremendous fear-mongering on something
 
02:55:02.389 --> 02:55:02.399 align:start position:0%
that is just not happening
 
02:55:05.030 --> 02:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
in this state
 
02:55:05.040 --> 02:55:06.230 align:start position:0%
in this state
okay

02:55:06.230 --> 02:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:55:10.790 --> 02:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:12.630 --> 02:55:12.640 align:start position:0%
i don't think there's any segment of our
 
02:55:15.190 --> 02:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
society that looks down on electricians
 
02:55:16.950 --> 02:55:16.960 align:start position:0%
but there is a segment of society that
 
02:55:18.870 --> 02:55:18.880 align:start position:0%
looks down on midwifery
 
02:55:20.630 --> 02:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
and no
 
02:55:23.190 --> 02:55:23.200 align:start position:0%
the director of oplc cannot with a
 
02:55:23.200 --> 02:55:24.150 align:start position:0%
the director of oplc cannot with a
single

02:55:24.150 --> 02:55:24.160 align:start position:0%
single
 
02:55:26.230 --> 02:55:26.240 align:start position:0%
uh swing of the acts
 
02:55:28.070 --> 02:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
end the profession
 
02:55:29.910 --> 02:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
but as we've seen in so many other
 
02:55:32.230 --> 02:55:32.240 align:start position:0%
venues so many avenues of our lives they
 
02:55:33.910 --> 02:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
can make it utterly miserable and
 
02:55:36.150 --> 02:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
difficult for it to survive
 
02:55:38.070 --> 02:55:38.080 align:start position:0%
so they're not quite the same but i
 
02:55:40.550 --> 02:55:40.560 align:start position:0%
respectfully disagree on that one
 
02:55:42.309 --> 02:55:42.319 align:start position:0%
son of golly
 
02:55:44.309 --> 02:55:44.319 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i'll be real brief
 
02:55:44.319 --> 02:55:45.670 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i'll be real brief
um

02:55:45.670 --> 02:55:45.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:55:47.670 --> 02:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
well i supported the amendment i cannot
 
02:55:51.269 --> 02:55:51.279 align:start position:0%
support the password amendment i think
 
02:55:53.269 --> 02:55:53.279 align:start position:0%
there were a number of us who met over
 
02:55:55.110 --> 02:55:55.120 align:start position:0%
at oplc and when we talked about
 
02:55:56.870 --> 02:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
advisory boards we talked about ones
 
02:55:58.550 --> 02:55:58.560 align:start position:0%
that were small and had troubles meeting
 
02:55:58.560 --> 02:55:59.750 align:start position:0%
that were small and had troubles meeting
quorums

02:55:59.750 --> 02:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
quorums
 
02:56:01.990 --> 02:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
we didn't hear of that problem here for
 
02:56:04.309 --> 02:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
a reason to make an advisory we heard
 
02:56:05.990 --> 02:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
about a court case we didn't hear about
 
02:56:07.590 --> 02:56:07.600 align:start position:0%
that when we were over there until this
 
02:56:09.190 --> 02:56:09.200 align:start position:0%
day of the public hearing
 
02:56:11.429 --> 02:56:11.439 align:start position:0%
we don't have a letter from the ag's
 
02:56:11.439 --> 02:56:12.630 align:start position:0%
we don't have a letter from the ag's
office

02:56:12.630 --> 02:56:12.640 align:start position:0%
office
 
02:56:15.429 --> 02:56:15.439 align:start position:0%
advising us whether or not that court
 
02:56:18.230 --> 02:56:18.240 align:start position:0%
case would affect this decision here
 
02:56:20.790 --> 02:56:20.800 align:start position:0%
so for that reason i cannot support the
 
02:56:22.550 --> 02:56:22.560 align:start position:0%
bill as amended until we get further
 
02:56:24.870 --> 02:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
information regarding that court case
 
02:56:28.070 --> 02:56:28.080 align:start position:0%

02:57:49.670 --> 02:57:49.680 align:start position:0%

interim study please and i'll second
 
02:57:55.030 --> 02:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:55.040 --> 02:57:55.910 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:57:55.910 --> 02:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:57:55.920 --> 02:57:57.670 align:start position:0%
okay
the

02:57:57.670 --> 02:57:57.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:57:59.030 --> 02:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
motion is
 
02:58:00.950 --> 02:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
interim study by representative allegro
 
02:58:05.830 --> 02:58:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:07.510 --> 02:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
do you wish to speak to your motion
 
02:58:11.349 --> 02:58:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:14.389 --> 02:58:14.399 align:start position:0%
i've expressed recently that
 
02:58:16.469 --> 02:58:16.479 align:start position:0%
i have a great deal of respect for oplc
 
02:58:19.030 --> 02:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
in their director
 
02:58:19.040 --> 02:58:20.070 align:start position:0%
in their director
but

02:58:20.070 --> 02:58:20.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:58:21.830 --> 02:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
what i've seen recently is making me
 
02:58:25.030 --> 02:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
think twice about consolidating
 
02:58:27.349 --> 02:58:27.359 align:start position:0%
so much decision making
 
02:58:30.870 --> 02:58:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:33.110 --> 02:58:33.120 align:start position:0%
so i think this is a case where
 
02:58:34.389 --> 02:58:34.399 align:start position:0%
a little more time for further
 
02:58:36.710 --> 02:58:36.720 align:start position:0%
consideration really helped me to
 
02:58:38.070 --> 02:58:38.080 align:start position:0%
to reach
 
02:58:40.710 --> 02:58:40.720 align:start position:0%
the most informed decision and i i would
 
02:58:46.790 --> 02:58:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:49.349 --> 02:58:49.359 align:start position:0%
thank you representative marsh
 
02:58:51.030 --> 02:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
i concur with that statement and i think
 
02:58:53.110 --> 02:58:53.120 align:start position:0%
i've said enough already
 
02:58:54.710 --> 02:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:58:56.469 --> 02:58:56.479 align:start position:0%
any further discussion comments
 
02:58:58.389 --> 02:58:58.399 align:start position:0%
representative schuett
 
02:59:01.030 --> 02:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh with all due
 
02:59:03.670 --> 02:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
respect to representative pearson
 
02:59:05.510 --> 02:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
i think this is probably the best
 
02:59:10.070 --> 02:59:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:13.030 --> 02:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
sure anyone else representative pearson
 
02:59:15.429 --> 02:59:15.439 align:start position:0%
um this was not my bill so i don't
 
02:59:16.630 --> 02:59:16.640 align:start position:0%
really have a
 
02:59:19.269 --> 02:59:19.279 align:start position:0%
heartstrings moan on this one mike
 
02:59:22.070 --> 02:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
what my concern is is that
 
02:59:25.429 --> 02:59:25.439 align:start position:0%
interim study it means various things to
 
02:59:28.150 --> 02:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
various people and we do often refer to
 
02:59:30.070 --> 02:59:30.080 align:start position:0%
it as death with dignity
 
02:59:30.080 --> 02:59:30.950 align:start position:0%
it as death with dignity
so

02:59:30.950 --> 02:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:59:33.429 --> 02:59:33.439 align:start position:0%
the concern that i have here is that the
 
02:59:35.990 --> 02:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
relationship between the midwife board
 
02:59:39.670 --> 02:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
and oplc is really bad right now
 
02:59:42.870 --> 02:59:42.880 align:start position:0%
we have done nothing to repair that and
 
02:59:47.269 --> 02:59:47.279 align:start position:0%
oplc lplc still has full authority over
 
02:59:49.190 --> 02:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
that board so i hope that if this is
 
02:59:51.030 --> 02:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
going to be interim studied that it
 
02:59:52.870 --> 02:59:52.880 align:start position:0%
actually is looked at to figure out how
 
02:59:54.870 --> 02:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
to make this work better between those
 
02:59:57.590 --> 02:59:57.600 align:start position:0%
two agencies because they are married
 
02:59:59.670 --> 02:59:59.680 align:start position:0%
and there are there's no divorce in
 
02:59:59.680 --> 03:00:03.349 align:start position:0%
and there are there's no divorce in
sight

03:00:03.349 --> 03:00:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:06.309 --> 03:00:06.319 align:start position:0%
anyone else comments represent marsh uh
 
03:00:07.910 --> 03:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
yes in response to representative
 
03:00:09.910 --> 03:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
pearson i i just would like to say that
 
03:00:11.510 --> 03:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
i have heard from members of the board
 
03:00:13.590 --> 03:00:13.600 align:start position:0%
some of whom are in attendance today
 
03:00:15.110 --> 03:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
that they are perfectly willing to work
 
03:00:17.190 --> 03:00:17.200 align:start position:0%
with oplc to come up with language that
 
03:00:19.429 --> 03:00:19.439 align:start position:0%
is acceptable to all parties and i
 
03:00:20.870 --> 03:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
personally believe that until that
 
03:00:22.630 --> 03:00:22.640 align:start position:0%
happens it's not time for us to pass a
 
03:00:22.640 --> 03:00:25.590 align:start position:0%
happens it's not time for us to pass a
bill

03:00:25.590 --> 03:00:25.600 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:00:28.469 --> 03:00:28.479 align:start position:0%
thank you representative grota

bills related to oplc in interim city
 
03:00:38.389 --> 03:00:38.399 align:start position:0%
and i think that the purpose of that
 
03:00:40.630 --> 03:00:40.640 align:start position:0%
motion and the obligation of this
 
03:00:43.190 --> 03:00:43.200 align:start position:0%

the amendment we had a hearing on the
 
03:02:53.279 --> 03:02:54.230 align:start position:0%
the amendment we had a hearing on the
bill

03:02:54.230 --> 03:02:54.240 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:02:54.240 --> 03:02:55.349 align:start position:0%
bill
um

03:02:55.349 --> 03:02:55.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:02:58.870 --> 03:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
and by various indicators the
 
03:03:00.790 --> 03:03:00.800 align:start position:0%
the position of medical technicians
 
03:03:02.630 --> 03:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't really need to be licensed we
 
03:03:04.870 --> 03:03:04.880 align:start position:0%
already have layers and layers of
 
03:03:09.030 --> 03:03:09.040 align:start position:0%
institutions and persons that oversee
 
03:03:10.950 --> 03:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
this profession they can't really work
 
03:03:12.550 --> 03:03:12.560 align:start position:0%
on their own they work in a hospital in
 
03:03:14.550 --> 03:03:14.560 align:start position:0%
the lab
 
03:03:14.560 --> 03:03:16.309 align:start position:0%
the lab
um

03:03:16.309 --> 03:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:03:18.790 --> 03:03:18.800 align:start position:0%
that's why this is a
 
03:03:20.870 --> 03:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
cleanup bill i don't we use that
 
03:03:22.630 --> 03:03:22.640 align:start position:0%
language but this is what the amendment
 
03:03:22.640 --> 03:03:24.230 align:start position:0%
language but this is what the amendment
does

03:03:24.230 --> 03:03:24.240 align:start position:0%
does
 
03:03:24.240 --> 03:03:25.510 align:start position:0%
does
it

03:03:25.510 --> 03:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:03:25.520 --> 03:03:28.630 align:start position:0%
it
takes

03:03:28.630 --> 03:03:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:30.870 --> 03:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
medical technicians out of the
 
03:03:32.630 --> 03:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
professional licensure certification
 
03:03:32.640 --> 03:03:35.429 align:start position:0%
professional licensure certification
office

03:03:35.429 --> 03:03:35.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:36.469 --> 03:03:36.479 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:03:38.070 --> 03:03:38.080 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative lucas do you
 
03:03:40.630 --> 03:03:40.640 align:start position:0%

03:03:40.640 --> 03:03:42.469 align:start position:0%
want to speak your second uh no thank
you

03:03:42.469 --> 03:03:42.479 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:03:44.630 --> 03:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion
 
03:03:46.790 --> 03:03:46.800 align:start position:0%
representative martian
 
03:03:49.830 --> 03:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you madam chair i am afraid
 
03:03:52.469 --> 03:03:52.479 align:start position:0%
that i cannot support the this amendment
 
03:03:55.110 --> 03:03:55.120 align:start position:0%
which in essence would repeal
 
03:03:56.870 --> 03:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
the board of registration of medical
 
03:03:58.950 --> 03:03:58.960 align:start position:0%
technicians the purpose of the sport is
 
03:04:02.309 --> 03:04:02.319 align:start position:0%
we heard extensive testimony from
 
03:04:04.309 --> 03:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
health care experts
 
03:04:06.389 --> 03:04:06.399 align:start position:0%
it was to protect the public from
 
03:04:08.469 --> 03:04:08.479 align:start position:0%
hepatitis c exposure as actually
 
03:04:10.950 --> 03:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
happened at exeter hospital and there
 
03:04:14.309 --> 03:04:14.319 align:start position:0%
have been since the institution of this
 
03:04:16.469 --> 03:04:16.479 align:start position:0%
new registration there have been no
 
03:04:18.070 --> 03:04:18.080 align:start position:0%
incidences of this happening in the
 
03:04:19.510 --> 03:04:19.520 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire so this was a
 
03:04:21.670 --> 03:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
problem that was solved
 
03:04:23.670 --> 03:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
that's not to say that we cannot improve
 
03:04:24.710 --> 03:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
the board
 
03:04:28.230 --> 03:04:28.240 align:start position:0%
i do believe that the minority amendment
 
03:04:31.110 --> 03:04:31.120 align:start position:0%
uh which we can discuss later would
 
03:04:33.349 --> 03:04:33.359 align:start position:0%
improve this bill substantially but to
 
03:04:36.790 --> 03:04:36.800 align:start position:0%
actually repeal this entire uh board is
 
03:04:39.269 --> 03:04:39.279 align:start position:0%
uh substantial overreach and we put the
 
03:04:41.030 --> 03:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
public at risk
 
03:04:43.269 --> 03:04:43.279 align:start position:0%
for significant harm that that has
 
03:04:44.469 --> 03:04:44.479 align:start position:0%
happened to
 
03:04:46.550 --> 03:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
numerous people in our state so thank
 
03:04:48.830 --> 03:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
you for that
 
03:04:51.990 --> 03:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
representative thank you madam chair so
 
03:04:55.510 --> 03:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
i have the same concerns that um
 
03:04:57.670 --> 03:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
representative marsh has and i just
 
03:05:01.590 --> 03:05:01.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to do any of these rsas that
 
03:05:10.070 --> 03:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:13.269 --> 03:05:13.279 align:start position:0%
are these are these rsas licensure for
 
03:05:17.110 --> 03:05:17.120 align:start position:0%
for medical technicians in various
 
03:05:18.710 --> 03:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
professions in the medical industry i'm
 
03:05:19.910 --> 03:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
03:05:21.670 --> 03:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to
 
03:05:21.680 --> 03:05:25.590 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to
connect

03:05:25.590 --> 03:05:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:28.389 --> 03:05:28.399 align:start position:0%
those are the licensing rsas for various
 
03:05:31.190 --> 03:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
medical professions
 
03:05:31.200 --> 03:05:32.389 align:start position:0%
medical professions
doctors

03:05:32.389 --> 03:05:32.399 align:start position:0%
doctors
 
03:05:35.349 --> 03:05:35.359 align:start position:0%
physicians nurses
 
03:05:37.429 --> 03:05:37.439 align:start position:0%
psychologists etc
 
03:05:40.269 --> 03:05:40.279 align:start position:0%
and it deletes rsa
 
03:05:43.750 --> 03:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
2328 i which is the medical technician
 
03:05:43.760 --> 03:05:46.070 align:start position:0%
2328 i which is the medical technician
registration

03:05:46.070 --> 03:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
registration
 
03:05:48.550 --> 03:05:48.560 align:start position:0%
and further question please please so
 
03:05:50.469 --> 03:05:50.479 align:start position:0%
underneath these rsas are there medical
 
03:05:53.830 --> 03:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
technician categories or are they just
 
03:05:57.110 --> 03:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
no they are it is one category
 
03:05:58.790 --> 03:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
last question so in essence we are
 
03:06:00.389 --> 03:06:00.399 align:start position:0%
removing the licensing procedure for
 
03:06:02.389 --> 03:06:02.399 align:start position:0%
medical technicians and i don't
 
03:06:03.830 --> 03:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
understand what the significance of
 
03:06:05.990 --> 03:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
these rsas what's the difference between
 
03:06:08.309 --> 03:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
saying this and just deleting
 
03:06:11.670 --> 03:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
those that's this is simply re de re
 
03:06:13.590 --> 03:06:13.600 align:start position:0%
deleting the reference to the
 
03:06:16.870 --> 03:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
registration of medical technicians in
 
03:06:20.230 --> 03:06:20.240 align:start position:0%
rsa 310a which is allowing telehealth
 
03:06:23.830 --> 03:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:26.630 --> 03:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
and anyone else representative bailey
 
03:06:29.510 --> 03:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
and then scitec i'm i'm not certain but
 
03:06:31.429 --> 03:06:31.439 align:start position:0%
i think the notion that there haven't
 
03:06:33.269 --> 03:06:33.279 align:start position:0%
been any problems since the board has
 
03:06:35.590 --> 03:06:35.600 align:start position:0%
been put in place therefore
 
03:06:37.670 --> 03:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
that was a solution as in the nature of
 
03:06:42.790 --> 03:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
a post-hoc proctor hawk logical error
 
03:06:44.469 --> 03:06:44.479 align:start position:0%
thank you representative bailey for
 
03:06:47.670 --> 03:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
educating us on the proper use of lodge
 
03:06:52.070 --> 03:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:55.990 --> 03:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
bailey beat me to the punch
 
03:06:57.910 --> 03:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
representative goalie
 
03:07:00.389 --> 03:07:00.399 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um during the
 
03:07:02.389 --> 03:07:02.399 align:start position:0%
public testimony we heard
 
03:07:04.550 --> 03:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
many reasons why
 
03:07:06.150 --> 03:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
we registered these individuals and the
 
03:07:08.230 --> 03:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
reason why this
 
03:07:10.389 --> 03:07:10.399 align:start position:0%
rsa was put in place
 
03:07:12.230 --> 03:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
uh we also heard from a number of
 
03:07:12.240 --> 03:07:13.429 align:start position:0%
uh we also heard from a number of
healthcare

03:07:13.429 --> 03:07:13.439 align:start position:0%
healthcare
 
03:07:13.439 --> 03:07:14.550 align:start position:0%
healthcare
groups

03:07:14.550 --> 03:07:14.560 align:start position:0%
groups
 
03:07:16.469 --> 03:07:16.479 align:start position:0%
supporting keeping this in place and not
 
03:07:18.230 --> 03:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
repealing it
 
03:07:21.750 --> 03:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
and i specifically asked those groups
 
03:07:24.309 --> 03:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
if it was in the best interest of the
 
03:07:24.319 --> 03:07:25.990 align:start position:0%
if it was in the best interest of the
public

03:07:25.990 --> 03:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
public
 
03:07:27.750 --> 03:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
to register these individuals because
 
03:07:29.590 --> 03:07:29.600 align:start position:0%
that's what we have licensing for here
 
03:07:31.030 --> 03:07:31.040 align:start position:0%
in the state when we look at whether a
 
03:07:33.190 --> 03:07:33.200 align:start position:0%
license is practical or not it's whether
 
03:07:35.110 --> 03:07:35.120 align:start position:0%
it's in the best interest of the public
 
03:07:37.590 --> 03:07:37.600 align:start position:0%
and public health protecting the public
 
03:07:37.600 --> 03:07:38.710 align:start position:0%
and public health protecting the public
and

03:07:38.710 --> 03:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:07:41.190 --> 03:07:41.200 align:start position:0%
the answer was yes
 
03:07:43.670 --> 03:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
so i cannot support the amendment
 
03:07:46.150 --> 03:07:46.160 align:start position:0%
to repeal the registration of these
 
03:07:48.230 --> 03:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
individuals and i'll be voting against
 
03:07:49.750 --> 03:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
the amendment thank you representative
 
03:07:52.230 --> 03:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
scitec representative goalie i heard you
 
03:07:54.710 --> 03:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
ask that question what other answer
 
03:07:56.710 --> 03:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
could they possibly give as a health
 
03:07:56.720 --> 03:08:00.230 align:start position:0%
could they possibly give as a health
professional

03:08:00.230 --> 03:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:03.030 --> 03:08:03.040 align:start position:0%
i believe that's a rhetorical question
 
03:08:05.030 --> 03:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:08:07.190 --> 03:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
i'd like to comment that as one of the
 
03:08:09.429 --> 03:08:09.439 align:start position:0%
few members of the of the committee that
 
03:08:11.349 --> 03:08:11.359 align:start position:0%
was here when we imposed this
 
03:08:11.359 --> 03:08:14.070 align:start position:0%
was here when we imposed this
registration

03:08:14.070 --> 03:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
registration
 
03:08:17.590 --> 03:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
it was pointed out that the main purpose
 
03:08:20.230 --> 03:08:20.240 align:start position:0%
of it being registration rather than a
 
03:08:23.750 --> 03:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
license is that we can't define what the
 
03:08:26.150 --> 03:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
what the duties are or skills of a
 
03:08:27.910 --> 03:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
medical technician are because they are
 
03:08:29.750 --> 03:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
highly variable
 
03:08:31.590 --> 03:08:31.600 align:start position:0%
and that they are determined by the
 
03:08:33.910 --> 03:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
employer which is generally a hospital
 
03:08:36.950 --> 03:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
or some other medical clinic
 
03:08:39.349 --> 03:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
and that the whole point of registration
 
03:08:41.590 --> 03:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
was to scare off the people who would
 
03:08:44.389 --> 03:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
fail the background check because the
 
03:08:47.670 --> 03:08:47.680 align:start position:0%
entire medical technician industry
 
03:08:51.830 --> 03:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
has a practice of in the whole medical
 
03:08:51.840 --> 03:08:53.190 align:start position:0%
has a practice of in the whole medical
professions

03:08:53.190 --> 03:08:53.200 align:start position:0%
professions
 
03:08:56.150 --> 03:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
and industry has a policy of firing
 
03:08:58.150 --> 03:08:58.160 align:start position:0%
someone who performs
 
03:08:58.160 --> 03:08:59.750 align:start position:0%
someone who performs
these

03:08:59.750 --> 03:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
these
 
03:09:02.870 --> 03:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
immoral at least acts if whether or not
 
03:09:04.389 --> 03:09:04.399 align:start position:0%
they're illegal
 
03:09:07.190 --> 03:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
and then fires them and sends them on
 
03:09:07.200 --> 03:09:08.630 align:start position:0%
and then fires them and sends them on
without

03:09:08.630 --> 03:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
without
 
03:09:11.429 --> 03:09:11.439 align:start position:0%
having any way to say that they are
 
03:09:14.389 --> 03:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
unqualified to be in a position of trust
 
03:09:14.399 --> 03:09:15.750 align:start position:0%
unqualified to be in a position of trust
or

03:09:15.750 --> 03:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:09:19.349 --> 03:09:19.359 align:start position:0%
actually dealing with someone's medical
 
03:09:19.359 --> 03:09:21.030 align:start position:0%
actually dealing with someone's medical
experience

03:09:21.030 --> 03:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
experience
 
03:09:23.349 --> 03:09:23.359 align:start position:0%
and so that the thought was that we
 
03:09:25.110 --> 03:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
would make it a hassle
 
03:09:26.710 --> 03:09:26.720 align:start position:0%
and convince
 
03:09:28.630 --> 03:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
those medical technicians with bad
 
03:09:30.630 --> 03:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
records to go to other states where it's
 
03:09:32.469 --> 03:09:32.479 align:start position:0%
easier to get a job
 
03:09:32.479 --> 03:09:33.830 align:start position:0%
easier to get a job
and

03:09:33.830 --> 03:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:09:35.349 --> 03:09:35.359 align:start position:0%
which is
 
03:09:38.469 --> 03:09:38.479 align:start position:0%
i think violating the principle of
 
03:09:40.870 --> 03:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
registration but that's my personal
 
03:09:43.269 --> 03:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
opinion representative allegro thank you
 
03:09:45.110 --> 03:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
i would like to uh
 
03:09:47.110 --> 03:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
echo what representative scitec and
 
03:09:49.269 --> 03:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
bailly uh pointed out but in less
 
03:09:50.870 --> 03:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
rhetorical form
 
03:09:53.110 --> 03:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
when we ask if we're protecting the
 
03:09:55.510 --> 03:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
public with an action
 
03:09:59.190 --> 03:09:59.200 align:start position:0%
um you know it's easy to to focus on
 
03:10:00.790 --> 03:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
the specific group that's receiving
 
03:10:02.630 --> 03:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
those circums those services at that
 
03:10:02.640 --> 03:10:03.510 align:start position:0%
those circums those services at that
time

03:10:03.510 --> 03:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:10:05.110 --> 03:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
there's a bigger question are we
 
03:10:06.870 --> 03:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
protecting the public in general and
 
03:10:09.349 --> 03:10:09.359 align:start position:0%
that goes to representative scitec's uh
 
03:10:11.750 --> 03:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
point and to representative bailey's
 
03:10:14.070 --> 03:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
point he's absolutely right if we voted
 
03:10:16.389 --> 03:10:16.399 align:start position:0%
to all wear a pocket handkerchief
 
03:10:19.510 --> 03:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
after that accident um the result
 
03:10:20.710 --> 03:10:20.720 align:start position:0%
probably would have been the same that
 
03:10:22.550 --> 03:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
there would have been a reduction in
 
03:10:23.910 --> 03:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
those incidents
 
03:10:26.710 --> 03:10:26.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:10:26.720 --> 03:10:28.070 align:start position:0%

it was a criminal act it wasn't an
accident

03:14:08.950 --> 03:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
licenses or hoping any kind of
 
03:14:11.590 --> 03:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
businesses without a cosmetology license
 
03:14:14.309 --> 03:14:14.319 align:start position:0%
this bill is actually making it easier
 
03:14:16.389 --> 03:14:16.399 align:start position:0%
for those individuals that are already
 
03:14:18.469 --> 03:14:18.479 align:start position:0%
licensed in another state
 
03:14:18.479 --> 03:14:19.510 align:start position:0%
licensed in another state
to

03:14:19.510 --> 03:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:14:22.070 --> 03:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
be able to operate in new hampshire if
 
03:14:24.070 --> 03:14:24.080 align:start position:0%
they are already licensed so basically
 
03:14:26.229 --> 03:14:26.239 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the reciprocity
 
03:14:28.469 --> 03:14:28.479 align:start position:0%
if you have a license in another state
 
03:14:30.550 --> 03:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
when you move to new hampshire
 
03:14:33.590 --> 03:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
it is actually quite difficult to obtain
 
03:14:38.950 --> 03:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:41.030 --> 03:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
as an example
 
03:14:42.469 --> 03:14:42.479 align:start position:0%
you have to
 
03:14:45.429 --> 03:14:45.439 align:start position:0%
have the the documentation from the
 
03:14:47.269 --> 03:14:47.279 align:start position:0%
school you've where you have obtained a
 
03:14:47.279 --> 03:14:49.030 align:start position:0%
school you've where you have obtained a
license

03:14:49.030 --> 03:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
license
 
03:14:51.510 --> 03:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
if you already have it and you've passed
 
03:14:53.190 --> 03:14:53.200 align:start position:0%
the test i'm not really sure why you
 
03:14:54.630 --> 03:14:54.640 align:start position:0%
have to go back and be able to get the
 
03:14:57.990 --> 03:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
transcripts from that particular school
 
03:15:00.550 --> 03:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
sometimes the school is closed
 
03:15:02.790 --> 03:15:02.800 align:start position:0%
there's many many examples i personally
 
03:15:04.070 --> 03:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
fell into that i
 
03:15:06.389 --> 03:15:06.399 align:start position:0%
the school i graduated from closed like
 
03:15:08.309 --> 03:15:08.319 align:start position:0%
a month later
 
03:15:09.750 --> 03:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
you have to be able to have proof of
 
03:15:11.510 --> 03:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
your high school diploma
 
03:15:15.910 --> 03:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:17.590 --> 03:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
the the other thing that we need to keep
 
03:15:19.990 --> 03:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
in mind is
 
03:15:22.469 --> 03:15:22.479 align:start position:0%
your skill or your license does not
 
03:15:25.030 --> 03:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
change when you cross a state line
 
03:15:26.870 --> 03:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
you're still doing the exact same
 
03:15:28.630 --> 03:15:28.640 align:start position:0%
service you're just doing it in a
 
03:15:30.229 --> 03:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
different state
 
03:15:31.670 --> 03:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
some states
 
03:15:35.269 --> 03:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
that do require more licensing hours
 
03:15:37.830 --> 03:15:37.840 align:start position:0%
as an example if you live in vermont
 
03:15:38.790 --> 03:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
and you
 
03:15:41.349 --> 03:15:41.359 align:start position:0%
attend a school in new hampshire
 
03:15:43.030 --> 03:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
the reason you have to have more hours
 
03:15:44.710 --> 03:15:44.720 align:start position:0%
isn't because you necessarily wanted to
 
03:15:46.229 --> 03:15:46.239 align:start position:0%
have more hours it's because that's the
 
03:15:47.830 --> 03:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
amount of hours that were required in
 
03:15:50.710 --> 03:15:50.720 align:start position:0%
order to graduate and we heard testimony
 
03:15:52.790 --> 03:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
that was saying that these people wanted
 
03:15:54.309 --> 03:15:54.319 align:start position:0%
more hours because it was more training
 
03:15:56.229 --> 03:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
when the reality is that
 
03:15:57.750 --> 03:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
that is what was required for them to be
 
03:16:00.469 --> 03:16:00.479 align:start position:0%
able to graduate so basically you know
 
03:16:02.389 --> 03:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
if you move to new hampshire and you
 
03:16:04.710 --> 03:16:04.720 align:start position:0%
want to continue driving a car
 
03:16:06.550 --> 03:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
you're able to do that you have to go
 
03:16:08.950 --> 03:16:08.960 align:start position:0%
take the test you know pass your past
 
03:16:11.269 --> 03:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
the um the state laws and you and you
 
03:16:11.279 --> 03:16:12.790 align:start position:0%
the um the state laws and you and you
drive

03:16:12.790 --> 03:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
drive
 
03:16:14.630 --> 03:16:14.640 align:start position:0%
so i'm not really sure why new hampshire
 
03:16:16.550 --> 03:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
is making it quite so difficult but i
 
03:16:17.990 --> 03:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
think at the end of the day we want to
 
03:16:20.309 --> 03:16:20.319 align:start position:0%
we want to promote entrepreneurship and
 
03:16:21.670 --> 03:16:21.680 align:start position:0%
we want people to be able to continue
 
03:16:23.510 --> 03:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
earning a living and not make it more
 
03:16:26.469 --> 03:16:26.479 align:start position:0%
difficult once they cross the state line
 
03:16:34.229 --> 03:16:34.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:36.389 --> 03:16:36.399 align:start position:0%
yeah it was not the word says everything
 
03:16:39.349 --> 03:16:39.359 align:start position:0%
so i don't have to to go there we are
 
03:16:40.790 --> 03:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
hungry now
 
03:16:42.870 --> 03:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative grota you had a
 
03:16:45.750 --> 03:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
comment i just have a question on the
 
03:16:48.389 --> 03:16:48.399 align:start position:0%
reciprocity is it is this bill in line
 
03:16:50.630 --> 03:16:50.640 align:start position:0%
with other bills where we've
 
03:16:50.640 --> 03:16:51.990 align:start position:0%
with other bills where we've
um

03:16:51.990 --> 03:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:16:56.870 --> 03:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:59.110 --> 03:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
a pretty much except that
 
03:17:01.349 --> 03:17:01.359 align:start position:0%
for real estate we require
 
03:17:03.830 --> 03:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire specific law tests
 
03:17:05.910 --> 03:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
the cosmetology industry doesn't have
 
03:17:08.469 --> 03:17:08.479 align:start position:0%
any new hampshire-specific
 
03:17:10.870 --> 03:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
laws that they need to be aware of
 
03:17:12.950 --> 03:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:17:15.030 --> 03:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
representative marsh and then goalie and
 
03:17:17.190 --> 03:17:17.200 align:start position:0%
phillips thank you madam chair uh i
 
03:17:19.590 --> 03:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
think i can agree with all the comments
 
03:17:21.830 --> 03:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
that were previously made i just
 
03:17:23.830 --> 03:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
question whether they're pertinent to
 
03:17:26.389 --> 03:17:26.399 align:start position:0%
the bills that we see before us if we
 
03:17:28.070 --> 03:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
look at this bill what it does is it
 
03:17:29.750 --> 03:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
removes the phrase other states
 
03:17:31.670 --> 03:17:31.680 align:start position:0%
licensing requirements are substantially
 
03:17:33.190 --> 03:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
equivalent to or higher than those of
 
03:17:35.269 --> 03:17:35.279 align:start position:0%
this state and replaces them with
 
03:17:37.110 --> 03:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
applicant holds a current and valid
 
03:17:37.120 --> 03:17:38.950 align:start position:0%
applicant holds a current and valid
license

03:17:38.950 --> 03:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
license
 
03:17:40.870 --> 03:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
that doesn't address any of the concerns
 
03:17:42.790 --> 03:17:42.800 align:start position:0%
that were addressed previously all it
 
03:17:44.630 --> 03:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
does is it means if they have a license
 
03:17:45.990 --> 03:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
somewhere else we're going to give them
 
03:17:47.830 --> 03:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
a license here whether or not their
 
03:17:50.950 --> 03:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
license is for something that's totally
 
03:17:50.960 --> 03:17:52.309 align:start position:0%
license is for something that's totally
unequivalent

03:17:52.309 --> 03:17:52.319 align:start position:0%
unequivalent
 
03:17:54.630 --> 03:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
so i don't think that's really what
 
03:17:56.469 --> 03:17:56.479 align:start position:0%
we're intended to do
 
03:17:58.790 --> 03:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
um and and i don't see how that's any
 
03:18:00.070 --> 03:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
different from just repealing the
 
03:18:02.870 --> 03:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
licensing requirement altogether so i
 
03:18:04.389 --> 03:18:04.399 align:start position:0%
don't think this bill is ready in its
 
03:18:06.309 --> 03:18:06.319 align:start position:0%
current form and i cannot support it
 
03:18:07.269 --> 03:18:07.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:18:09.269 --> 03:18:09.279 align:start position:0%
represent goalie
 
03:18:12.070 --> 03:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and i too cannot
 
03:18:13.429 --> 03:18:13.439 align:start position:0%
support this
 
03:18:15.110 --> 03:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
we set standards here
 
03:18:16.630 --> 03:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire for a reason and when
 
03:18:18.710 --> 03:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
we look at those standards
 
03:18:20.150 --> 03:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
we like to make sure that those are
 
03:18:22.950 --> 03:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
licensed under the standards we set
 
03:18:25.510 --> 03:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
by the way they're done this
 
03:18:27.349 --> 03:18:27.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't keep those standards in place it
 
03:18:29.510 --> 03:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
just says as long as they're licensed no
 
03:18:31.429 --> 03:18:31.439 align:start position:0%
matter what the credentials were coming
 
03:18:31.439 --> 03:18:32.550 align:start position:0%
matter what the credentials were coming
forward

03:18:32.550 --> 03:18:32.560 align:start position:0%
forward
 
03:18:35.429 --> 03:18:35.439 align:start position:0%
no longer having them equal to or higher
 
03:18:37.269 --> 03:18:37.279 align:start position:0%
than new hampshire standards
 
03:18:40.550 --> 03:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
and just for the second part uh if you
 
03:18:43.030 --> 03:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
look at that language i just it caught
 
03:18:44.070 --> 03:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
my eye when we were talking about
 
03:18:44.080 --> 03:18:45.750 align:start position:0%
my eye when we were talking about
midwifery

03:18:45.750 --> 03:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
midwifery
 
03:18:48.229 --> 03:18:48.239 align:start position:0%
that same language is in
 
03:18:50.790 --> 03:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
that statute as well and it says the
 
03:18:53.030 --> 03:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
exact same thing reciprocity
 
03:18:54.710 --> 03:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
applicant who is licensed by any other
 
03:18:56.309 --> 03:18:56.319 align:start position:0%
state provided that states licensing or
 
03:18:57.510 --> 03:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
certification requirements are
 
03:18:59.670 --> 03:18:59.680 align:start position:0%
substantially equivalent or higher to
 
03:19:01.990 --> 03:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
those uh of the state so we have it in
 
03:19:03.429 --> 03:19:03.439 align:start position:0%
other statutes and i think we should
 
03:19:05.030 --> 03:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
keep it there thank you
 
03:19:06.790 --> 03:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
03:19:09.190 --> 03:19:09.200 align:start position:0%
um my comment is on this along the same
 
03:19:12.550 --> 03:19:12.560 align:start position:0%
line um the current language allows for
 
03:19:14.950 --> 03:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
a substantially equivalent so for
 
03:19:18.389 --> 03:19:18.399 align:start position:0%
example if a cosmetology
 
03:19:20.389 --> 03:19:20.399 align:start position:0%
person wanted to get licensed in new
 
03:19:23.349 --> 03:19:23.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire and the hours required
 
03:19:23.359 --> 03:19:24.790 align:start position:0%
hampshire and the hours required
for

03:19:24.790 --> 03:19:24.800 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:19:28.150 --> 03:19:28.160 align:start position:0%
an apprenticeship or the program was
 
03:19:30.550 --> 03:19:30.560 align:start position:0%
10 percent less i assume that that would
 
03:19:33.429 --> 03:19:33.439 align:start position:0%
qualify as substantial but what this
 
03:19:35.910 --> 03:19:35.920 align:start position:0%
does is it opens the door
 
03:19:35.920 --> 03:19:37.190 align:start position:0%
does is it opens the door
for

03:19:37.190 --> 03:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:19:40.070 --> 03:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
some other state and we might not even
 
03:19:41.750 --> 03:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
know about it right away
 
03:19:44.469 --> 03:19:44.479 align:start position:0%
decides that they don't need to license
 
03:19:46.309 --> 03:19:46.319 align:start position:0%
cosmetologists at all they're just going
 
03:19:49.750 --> 03:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
to register them and then instantly the
 
03:19:52.389 --> 03:19:52.399 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire has that as their
 
03:19:52.399 --> 03:19:53.510 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire has that as their
standard

03:19:53.510 --> 03:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
standard
 
03:19:53.520 --> 03:19:54.630 align:start position:0%
standard
and

03:19:54.630 --> 03:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:19:57.269 --> 03:19:57.279 align:start position:0%
with no prior notice not even time for a
 
03:19:59.349 --> 03:19:59.359 align:start position:0%
legislature to say no no no we don't
 
03:20:02.389 --> 03:20:02.399 align:start position:0%
want that it'll be too late so this just
 
03:20:07.750 --> 03:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:10.710 --> 03:20:10.720 align:start position:0%
i'd like to comment that the phrase
 
03:20:12.950 --> 03:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
substantially equivalent
 
03:20:17.110 --> 03:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
is rather subjective and in many cases
 
03:20:19.590 --> 03:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
there have been very subjective
 
03:20:21.349 --> 03:20:21.359 align:start position:0%
decisions made
 
03:20:21.359 --> 03:20:24.550 align:start position:0%
decisions made
that

03:20:24.550 --> 03:20:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:26.389 --> 03:20:26.399 align:start position:0%
a person who was not concerned about
 
03:20:28.309 --> 03:20:28.319 align:start position:0%
bringing in more people to compete with
 
03:20:30.550 --> 03:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
their business
 
03:20:33.349 --> 03:20:33.359 align:start position:0%
might not think were not substantially
 
03:20:36.229 --> 03:20:36.239 align:start position:0%
equivalent their people have been denied
 
03:20:37.910 --> 03:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
their um
 
03:20:39.990 --> 03:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
denied a license
 
03:20:40.000 --> 03:20:44.790 align:start position:0%
denied a license
for

03:20:44.790 --> 03:20:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:46.469 --> 03:20:46.479 align:start position:0%
reasons that some people would think
 
03:20:46.479 --> 03:20:47.910 align:start position:0%
reasons that some people would think
invalid

03:20:47.910 --> 03:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
invalid
 
03:20:50.229 --> 03:20:50.239 align:start position:0%
and also as representative rhodes
 
03:20:52.550 --> 03:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned there's
 
03:20:52.560 --> 03:20:53.349 align:start position:0%
mentioned there's
the

03:20:53.349 --> 03:20:53.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:20:55.429 --> 03:20:55.439 align:start position:0%
absolute hassle
 
03:20:59.510 --> 03:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
of getting the documentation required
 
03:20:59.520 --> 03:21:00.630 align:start position:0%
of getting the documentation required
and

03:21:00.630 --> 03:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:21:03.590 --> 03:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
which we removed when we
 
03:21:04.790 --> 03:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
dealt with
 
03:21:04.800 --> 03:21:07.269 align:start position:0%
dealt with
the

03:21:07.269 --> 03:21:07.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:09.590 --> 03:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
mental health workers we deleted the
 
03:21:11.510 --> 03:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
requirement that
 
03:21:12.790 --> 03:21:12.800 align:start position:0%
we we
 
03:21:15.269 --> 03:21:15.279 align:start position:0%
made explicit in statute that someone
 
03:21:19.349 --> 03:21:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:22.469 --> 03:21:22.479 align:start position:0%
location did not have to provide their
 
03:21:26.309 --> 03:21:26.319 align:start position:0%
transcripts their supervision reports
 
03:21:28.550 --> 03:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
and other things that a
 
03:21:30.469 --> 03:21:30.479 align:start position:0%
person who's been in the profession for
 
03:21:32.229 --> 03:21:32.239 align:start position:0%
a long time
 
03:21:34.229 --> 03:21:34.239 align:start position:0%
is going to have trouble locating and
 
03:21:36.550 --> 03:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
verifying i mean i know i couldn't find
 
03:21:36.560 --> 03:21:37.830 align:start position:0%
verifying i mean i know i couldn't find
my

03:21:37.830 --> 03:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
my
 
03:21:39.910 --> 03:21:39.920 align:start position:0%
high school diploma and i'm not sure i
 
03:21:43.750 --> 03:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:46.469 --> 03:21:46.479 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm concerned that that
 
03:21:49.349 --> 03:21:49.359 align:start position:0%
requirement in our statute is too vague
 
03:21:53.030 --> 03:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
and two offers too much opportunity for
 
03:21:55.429 --> 03:21:55.439 align:start position:0%
self-serving decisions
 
03:21:59.110 --> 03:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
and too subjective and so i'm going up
 
03:22:00.710 --> 03:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
in favor of repealing that
 
03:22:03.269 --> 03:22:03.279 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
03:22:03.279 --> 03:22:04.469 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
i

03:22:04.469 --> 03:22:04.479 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:22:07.429 --> 03:22:07.439 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to say that
 
03:22:11.190 --> 03:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
i agree substantial can be subjective
 
03:22:14.630 --> 03:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
but in terms of having to find
 
03:22:17.590 --> 03:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
diplomas or you know proof that you pass
 
03:22:19.190 --> 03:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
to test
 
03:22:22.469 --> 03:22:22.479 align:start position:0%
the individual wouldn't have to do that
 
03:22:25.110 --> 03:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
they'd just if that state that they're
 
03:22:27.910 --> 03:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
coming from had that requirement they
 
03:22:29.429 --> 03:22:29.439 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't have to produce those
 
03:22:33.349 --> 03:22:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:34.870 --> 03:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
representative road
 
03:22:36.309 --> 03:22:36.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:22:37.990 --> 03:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman so a couple
 
03:22:39.510 --> 03:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
things i would like to point out is if
 
03:22:41.510 --> 03:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
you if if anybody in the committee has
 
03:22:44.309 --> 03:22:44.319 align:start position:0%
not looked up the reciprocity agreements
 
03:22:46.150 --> 03:22:46.160 align:start position:0%
to have a new hampshire cosmetology
 
03:22:48.630 --> 03:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
license i would encourage you to do that
 
03:22:51.190 --> 03:22:51.200 align:start position:0%
honestly it is not as simple it is not
 
03:22:54.469 --> 03:22:54.479 align:start position:0%
simple at all so as an example if i have
 
03:22:56.389 --> 03:22:56.399 align:start position:0%
a license in pennsylvania and i moved to
 
03:22:57.670 --> 03:22:57.680 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
03:22:59.910 --> 03:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
i would have to have a letter verifying
 
03:23:02.469 --> 03:23:02.479 align:start position:0%
my school and my training
 
03:23:05.190 --> 03:23:05.200 align:start position:0%
if i that is keep in mind if i come with
 
03:23:06.710 --> 03:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
a current
 
03:23:08.950 --> 03:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
license a current cosmetology license
 
03:23:10.790 --> 03:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
for the state of pennsylvania
 
03:23:12.550 --> 03:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
if i come here and i want to continue
 
03:23:14.710 --> 03:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
practicing i would have to show the
 
03:23:17.110 --> 03:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
verification of the school i went to
 
03:23:19.030 --> 03:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
if that school closes you are not able
 
03:23:21.910 --> 03:23:21.920 align:start position:0%
to obtain that so the fact that you have
 
03:23:24.389 --> 03:23:24.399 align:start position:0%
that current cosmetology license is
 
03:23:26.150 --> 03:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
almost pointless
 
03:23:28.309 --> 03:23:28.319 align:start position:0%
you have to show your copy of your high
 
03:23:30.150 --> 03:23:30.160 align:start position:0%
school diploma
 
03:23:32.309 --> 03:23:32.319 align:start position:0%
again if you already have that current
 
03:23:34.630 --> 03:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
license you you're not doing anything
 
03:23:36.309 --> 03:23:36.319 align:start position:0%
different and one of the biggest things
 
03:23:37.910 --> 03:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
i would like to point out for everybody
 
03:23:39.590 --> 03:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
to pay attention to
 
03:23:39.600 --> 03:23:40.710 align:start position:0%
to pay attention to
is

03:23:40.710 --> 03:23:40.720 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:23:43.590 --> 03:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
you do not have to take the state laws
 
03:23:45.590 --> 03:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
test in the state of new hampshire to
 
03:23:47.670 --> 03:23:47.680 align:start position:0%
say that you understand the difference
 
03:23:49.590 --> 03:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
between the laws in new hampshire and
 
03:23:51.910 --> 03:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
what other state you already came from
 
03:23:53.910 --> 03:23:53.920 align:start position:0%
so this is not about laws this comes
 
03:23:56.710 --> 03:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
down to skill the skill is exactly the
 
03:24:00.870 --> 03:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:00.880 --> 03:24:03.750 align:start position:0%
 
represents

03:24:03.750 --> 03:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:05.990 --> 03:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
i do come from the commonwealth of
 
03:24:06.000 --> 03:24:08.309 align:start position:0%
i do come from the commonwealth of
pennsylvania

03:24:08.309 --> 03:24:08.319 align:start position:0%
pennsylvania
 
03:24:08.319 --> 03:24:09.349 align:start position:0%
pennsylvania
the

03:24:09.349 --> 03:24:09.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:24:11.269 --> 03:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
what i'd love to see
 
03:24:14.150 --> 03:24:14.160 align:start position:0%
we debate in these four walls this is
 
03:24:16.070 --> 03:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
the world i have a completely different
 
03:24:18.389 --> 03:24:18.399 align:start position:0%
slant on this has anybody actually
 
03:24:21.269 --> 03:24:21.279 align:start position:0%
looked up and said wyoming has less
 
03:24:23.429 --> 03:24:23.439 align:start position:0%
standards and we can't trust somebody
 
03:24:26.070 --> 03:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
from wyoming it'd be nice to have a list
 
03:24:28.229 --> 03:24:28.239 align:start position:0%
of the states that we don't trust you
 
03:24:30.550 --> 03:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
know is there such a truck is there such
 
03:24:31.510 --> 03:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
a state
 
03:24:34.790 --> 03:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
among our 50 representative psychic the
 
03:24:36.950 --> 03:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
boards are have been requested on
 
03:24:40.229 --> 03:24:40.239 align:start position:0%
multiple occasions to identify states
 
03:24:40.239 --> 03:24:41.110 align:start position:0%
multiple occasions to identify states
where

03:24:41.110 --> 03:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
where
 
03:24:41.120 --> 03:24:41.990 align:start position:0%
where
the

03:24:41.990 --> 03:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:24:43.830 --> 03:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
requirements are not substantially
 
03:24:45.830 --> 03:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
equivalent and most of them have
 
03:24:51.269 --> 03:24:51.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:52.790 --> 03:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:24:54.150 --> 03:24:54.160 align:start position:0%
again i would like to agree with
 
03:24:55.910 --> 03:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
representative rhodes as the issues that
 
03:24:58.630 --> 03:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
she had transferring her license however
 
03:25:00.229 --> 03:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
this does not appear to me to be a
 
03:25:02.309 --> 03:25:02.319 align:start position:0%
problem with statute it appears to be a
 
03:25:03.670 --> 03:25:03.680 align:start position:0%
problem with the rules that are
 
03:25:05.590 --> 03:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
implementing the statute and that is an
 
03:25:07.429 --> 03:25:07.439 align:start position:0%
entirely different question i don't
 
03:25:09.190 --> 03:25:09.200 align:start position:0%
think we need to give up
 
03:25:10.950 --> 03:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
the requirement that the other states
 
03:25:12.870 --> 03:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
licensing requirements are substantially
 
03:25:12.880 --> 03:25:14.710 align:start position:0%
licensing requirements are substantially
equivalent

03:25:14.710 --> 03:25:14.720 align:start position:0%
equivalent
 
03:25:17.190 --> 03:25:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:19.510 --> 03:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
03:25:21.830 --> 03:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
representative fellows yes i i don't
 
03:25:24.630 --> 03:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
mean to drag this out but
 
03:25:27.429 --> 03:25:27.439 align:start position:0%
the situation that representative marsh
 
03:25:30.389 --> 03:25:30.399 align:start position:0%
just explained is is that the reason
 
03:25:32.309 --> 03:25:32.319 align:start position:0%
that it's hard to get the cosmetology
 
03:25:35.750 --> 03:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
license because the board hasn't
 
03:25:37.510 --> 03:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
specified that
 
03:25:39.429 --> 03:25:39.439 align:start position:0%
pennsylvania or any other particular
 
03:25:41.269 --> 03:25:41.279 align:start position:0%
state is is
 
03:25:43.910 --> 03:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
similar or substantially similar and
 
03:25:45.750 --> 03:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
it's not you deal with each
 
03:25:45.760 --> 03:25:47.030 align:start position:0%
it's not you deal with each
person

03:25:47.030 --> 03:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
person
 
03:25:47.040 --> 03:25:48.550 align:start position:0%
person
individually

03:25:48.550 --> 03:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
individually
 
03:25:51.349 --> 03:25:51.359 align:start position:0%
which is grossly inefficient
 
03:25:51.359 --> 03:25:53.269 align:start position:0%
which is grossly inefficient
and

03:25:53.269 --> 03:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:25:55.750 --> 03:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
for example in massachusetts
 
03:25:58.469 --> 03:25:58.479 align:start position:0%
they require only a thousand hours of
 
03:26:00.150 --> 03:26:00.160 align:start position:0%
training which
 
03:26:02.309 --> 03:26:02.319 align:start position:0%
for the
 
03:26:04.469 --> 03:26:04.479 align:start position:0%
areas of public safety
 
03:26:08.229 --> 03:26:08.239 align:start position:0%
are probably quite adequate the
 
03:26:09.990 --> 03:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
national organization has said a
 
03:26:15.510 --> 03:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:20.229 --> 03:26:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:21.990 --> 03:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
yeah so i'm scrolling through the street
 
03:26:24.389 --> 03:26:24.399 align:start position:0%
requirements for cosmetology as we're
 
03:26:25.830 --> 03:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
talking through this and i don't really
 
03:26:27.429 --> 03:26:27.439 align:start position:0%
have an issue with
 
03:26:29.269 --> 03:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
if someone has a state license from
 
03:26:29.279 --> 03:26:30.150 align:start position:0%
if someone has a state license from
another

03:26:30.150 --> 03:26:30.160 align:start position:0%
another
 
03:26:30.160 --> 03:26:31.750 align:start position:0%
another
state

03:26:31.750 --> 03:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:26:34.469 --> 03:26:34.479 align:start position:0%
having them get a new hampshire state
 
03:26:36.150 --> 03:26:36.160 align:start position:0%
license doesn't seem to be an issue to
 
03:26:39.030 --> 03:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
me because as i'm scrolling through
 
03:26:40.790 --> 03:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
there isn't one state other than
 
03:26:42.870 --> 03:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
massachusetts that requires less than a
 
03:26:45.510 --> 03:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
thousand hours and
 
03:26:47.990 --> 03:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
i don't i think that new hampshire falls
 
03:26:49.750 --> 03:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
in line with the rest of the country so
 
03:26:52.469 --> 03:26:52.479 align:start position:0%
i in my opinion if there's a licensed
 
03:26:54.550 --> 03:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
cosmetologist in
 
03:26:56.389 --> 03:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
another state i wouldn't have a problem
 
03:26:57.990 --> 03:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
with them having a license in new
 
03:26:58.000 --> 03:27:01.990 align:start position:0%
with them having a license in new
hampshire

03:27:01.990 --> 03:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:02.000 --> 03:27:04.389 align:start position:0%
 
oregon

03:27:04.389 --> 03:27:04.399 align:start position:0%
oregon
 
03:27:06.070 --> 03:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
well this is beyond
 
03:27:08.150 --> 03:27:08.160 align:start position:0%
the scope of an amendment to this bill
 
03:27:09.910 --> 03:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
or at least to be non-germane but if
 
03:27:10.950 --> 03:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
03:27:12.389 --> 03:27:12.399 align:start position:0%
problem with professional schools in
 
03:27:14.870 --> 03:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
cosmetology or any other field
 
03:27:17.030 --> 03:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
closing and then not uh
 
03:27:19.670 --> 03:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
depositing the records with a surviving
 
03:27:21.030 --> 03:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
institution then that's probably
 
03:27:23.429 --> 03:27:23.439 align:start position:0%
something that
 
03:27:24.950 --> 03:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
would be a useful subject for bill
 
03:27:26.550 --> 03:27:26.560 align:start position:0%
because i know if with colleges and high
 
03:27:28.070 --> 03:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
schools even if your college or high
 
03:27:30.389 --> 03:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
school closes they usually deposit their
 
03:27:31.670 --> 03:27:31.680 align:start position:0%
records with
 
03:27:34.229 --> 03:27:34.239 align:start position:0%
another institution so so if that's not
 
03:27:35.830 --> 03:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
the case with professional or trade
 
03:27:38.710 --> 03:27:38.720 align:start position:0%
schools then it probably should be
 
03:27:39.670 --> 03:27:39.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:27:42.950 --> 03:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
i agree with you that a wise procedure
 
03:27:44.870 --> 03:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
but totally irrelevant representative
 
03:27:46.950 --> 03:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
scitec how are we going to enforce that
 
03:27:51.110 --> 03:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:52.950 --> 03:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
exactly thank you
 
03:27:55.110 --> 03:27:55.120 align:start position:0%

so this is about human history this is a
 
03:30:23.830 --> 03:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
fascinating fascinating topic
 
03:30:23.840 --> 03:30:24.630 align:start position:0%
fascinating fascinating topic
um

03:30:24.630 --> 03:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:30:24.640 --> 03:30:26.790 align:start position:0%
um
and

03:30:26.790 --> 03:30:26.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:30:27.990 --> 03:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
the people
 
03:30:29.429 --> 03:30:29.439 align:start position:0%
as they appeared on the american
 
03:30:29.439 --> 03:30:31.190 align:start position:0%
as they appeared on the american
continent

03:30:31.190 --> 03:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
continent
 
03:30:33.110 --> 03:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
i'll try to be very brief but there's a
 
03:30:35.110 --> 03:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
lot to talk about so people originated
 
03:30:38.309 --> 03:30:38.319 align:start position:0%
about 200 200 000 years in africa and
 
03:30:40.790 --> 03:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
they migrated all over the planet they
 
03:30:42.150 --> 03:30:42.160 align:start position:0%
traveled through
 
03:30:45.510 --> 03:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
arabia through europe eurasia
 
03:30:47.670 --> 03:30:47.680 align:start position:0%
so the american
 
03:30:47.680 --> 03:30:48.710 align:start position:0%
so the american
peoples

03:30:48.710 --> 03:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
peoples
 
03:30:51.349 --> 03:30:51.359 align:start position:0%
got here over
 
03:30:53.590 --> 03:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
siberia over the bering straits they
 
03:30:55.670 --> 03:30:55.680 align:start position:0%
walked over
 
03:30:57.030 --> 03:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
probably ice
 
03:30:58.630 --> 03:30:58.640 align:start position:0%
down the american continent up and down
 
03:30:59.910 --> 03:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
the american continent from north
 
03:30:59.920 --> 03:31:01.030 align:start position:0%
the american continent from north
america

03:31:01.030 --> 03:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
america
 
03:31:04.630 --> 03:31:04.640 align:start position:0%
and about 14 000 years ago they got here
 
03:31:06.309 --> 03:31:06.319 align:start position:0%
those are the regional migrants those
 
03:31:07.990 --> 03:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
are the indigenous people as we know
 
03:31:10.870 --> 03:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:13.750 --> 03:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
other tribes um they came on foot it
 
03:31:15.990 --> 03:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
took many generations to get here
 
03:31:18.790 --> 03:31:18.800 align:start position:0%
it's just amazing what they did
 
03:31:21.349 --> 03:31:21.359 align:start position:0%
other peoples all over the world got
 
03:31:24.870 --> 03:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
as far as australia and other continents
 
03:31:26.950 --> 03:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
um and then
 
03:31:26.960 --> 03:31:28.550 align:start position:0%
um and then
so

03:31:28.550 --> 03:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:31:31.269 --> 03:31:31.279 align:start position:0%
the history is full of these fascinating
 
03:31:31.279 --> 03:31:32.309 align:start position:0%
the history is full of these fascinating
facts

03:31:32.309 --> 03:31:32.319 align:start position:0%
facts
 
03:31:36.229 --> 03:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
and um on december 23rd in 1994
 
03:31:38.150 --> 03:31:38.160 align:start position:0%
the united nations uh actually the
 
03:31:39.510 --> 03:31:39.520 align:start position:0%
subcommission on promotion and
 
03:31:42.309 --> 03:31:42.319 align:start position:0%
protection of human rights
 
03:31:44.469 --> 03:31:44.479 align:start position:0%
so the general assembly of the united
 
03:31:47.990 --> 03:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
nations recognized the indigenous people
 
03:31:49.429 --> 03:31:49.439 align:start position:0%
and they recognized the indigenous
 
03:31:51.510 --> 03:31:51.520 align:start position:0%
people's day
 
03:31:53.750 --> 03:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
back then so
 
03:31:55.590 --> 03:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
this is where this bill is coming from i
 
03:31:58.469 --> 03:31:58.479 align:start position:0%
believe that there is time that
 
03:32:01.190 --> 03:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
for the people of our lands of the
 
03:32:03.349 --> 03:32:03.359 align:start position:0%
people of new hampshire
 
03:32:05.190 --> 03:32:05.200 align:start position:0%
we finally extend the courtesy to them
 
03:32:08.389 --> 03:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
and recognize them just the same
 
03:32:10.469 --> 03:32:10.479 align:start position:0%
and that's why i'm moving out to pass on
 
03:32:13.190 --> 03:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
the bill the indigenous people they
 
03:32:14.550 --> 03:32:14.560 align:start position:0%

yes thank you madam chair
 
03:32:21.269 --> 03:32:21.279 align:start position:0%
i think the indigenous people
 
03:32:24.229 --> 03:32:24.239 align:start position:0%
deserve to be recognized in new
 
03:32:24.239 --> 03:32:28.389 align:start position:0%
deserve to be recognized in new
hampshire

03:32:28.389 --> 03:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:30.070 --> 03:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
it seems like
 
03:32:32.630 --> 03:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
we forgot our past
 
03:32:36.630 --> 03:32:36.640 align:start position:0%
but we can forget them
 
03:32:37.590 --> 03:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:32:38.630 --> 03:32:38.640 align:start position:0%

03:32:44.229 --> 03:32:44.239 align:start position:0%
representative horrick um yes if you
 
03:32:46.150 --> 03:32:46.160 align:start position:0%
recall i came in and testified against
 
03:32:48.550 --> 03:32:48.560 align:start position:0%
this bill last month and i've
 
03:32:50.309 --> 03:32:50.319 align:start position:0%
been a sponsor co-sponsored several
 
03:32:52.229 --> 03:32:52.239 align:start position:0%
bills establishing the second monday in
 
03:32:52.239 --> 03:32:53.429 align:start position:0%
bills establishing the second monday in
october

03:32:53.429 --> 03:32:53.439 align:start position:0%
october
 
03:32:55.190 --> 03:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
as the indigenous people's day holiday
 
03:32:57.110 --> 03:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
and that's um
 
03:32:59.030 --> 03:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
that's very specifically what the
 
03:33:00.710 --> 03:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
purpose of that was to try to get
 
03:33:03.190 --> 03:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
official recognition for a holiday for a
 
03:33:04.870 --> 03:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
celebration that's already being
 
03:33:07.429 --> 03:33:07.439 align:start position:0%
celebrated that the indigent the
 
03:33:07.439 --> 03:33:08.150 align:start position:0%
celebrated that the indigent the
uh

03:33:08.150 --> 03:33:08.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:33:09.910 --> 03:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
you know the indigenous peoples in the
 
03:33:12.630 --> 03:33:12.640 align:start position:0%
united states of america and uh people
 
03:33:14.229 --> 03:33:14.239 align:start position:0%
like myself who have no indigenous
 
03:33:15.830 --> 03:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
ancestry to speak of
 
03:33:18.150 --> 03:33:18.160 align:start position:0%
that's the day we've adopted and there's
 
03:33:19.990 --> 03:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
various reasons why that's controversial
 
03:33:21.429 --> 03:33:21.439 align:start position:0%
but that's
 
03:33:22.870 --> 03:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
that's the day they've been celebrating
 
03:33:24.550 --> 03:33:24.560 align:start position:0%
so they were not
 
03:33:26.469 --> 03:33:26.479 align:start position:0%
asking for permission for us to give us
 
03:33:29.349 --> 03:33:29.359 align:start position:0%
just a day to celebrate they were like
 
03:33:30.950 --> 03:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
trying to get official recognition for
 
03:33:33.990 --> 03:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
the celebration that has already uh
 
03:33:35.269 --> 03:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
has already been going on for a number
 
03:33:37.110 --> 03:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
of years and in fact has probably become
 
03:33:39.349 --> 03:33:39.359 align:start position:0%
more popular than columbus day so that's
 
03:33:39.359 --> 03:33:40.630 align:start position:0%
more popular than columbus day so that's
um

03:33:40.630 --> 03:33:40.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:42.790 --> 03:33:42.800 align:start position:0%
that's why it's a proponent of uh
 
03:33:44.950 --> 03:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
changing the second monday in october to
 
03:33:47.030 --> 03:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
from its current name to indigenous
 
03:33:48.550 --> 03:33:48.560 align:start position:0%
people's day that's why at least for me
 
03:33:51.269 --> 03:33:51.279 align:start position:0%
that's not a acceptable compromise and
 
03:33:51.279 --> 03:33:52.550 align:start position:0%
that's not a acceptable compromise and
some

03:33:52.550 --> 03:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
some
 
03:33:54.710 --> 03:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
also say this is the first time if this
 
03:33:56.070 --> 03:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
passes a law it's the first time we've
 
03:33:57.510 --> 03:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
ever passed a law that says something
 
03:33:59.510 --> 03:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
good about the u.n which uh
 
03:33:59.520 --> 03:34:00.550 align:start position:0%
good about the u.n which uh
but

03:34:00.550 --> 03:34:00.560 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:34:02.710 --> 03:34:02.720 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative so anyway
 
03:34:05.190 --> 03:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
we're not that's uh yes thanks
 
03:34:07.030 --> 03:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
representative fellow
 
03:34:10.229 --> 03:34:10.239 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um since you the
 
03:34:13.910 --> 03:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
u.n and other countries recognize this
 
03:34:16.790 --> 03:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
particular day august 9th is as an
 
03:34:20.229 --> 03:34:20.239 align:start position:0%
indigenous people's day i think that
 
03:34:23.349 --> 03:34:23.359 align:start position:0%
works for new hampshire also
 
03:34:25.429 --> 03:34:25.439 align:start position:0%
uh it there
 
03:34:28.950 --> 03:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
is some controversy in the bill about
 
03:34:31.990 --> 03:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
whether or not the indigenous tribes
 
03:34:34.469 --> 03:34:34.479 align:start position:0%
mentioned here are
 
03:34:36.550 --> 03:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
includes all of the ones that should be
 
03:34:38.550 --> 03:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned but since it says including
 
03:34:41.349 --> 03:34:41.359 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't exclude anyone then i
 
03:34:43.830 --> 03:34:43.840 align:start position:0%
think this bill works
 
03:34:45.190 --> 03:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
better than some of the other bills
 
03:34:47.750 --> 03:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
we've seen in the past
 
03:34:49.349 --> 03:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
representative elect
 
03:34:51.429 --> 03:34:51.439 align:start position:0%
i find it so ironic that we're willing
 
03:34:53.269 --> 03:34:53.279 align:start position:0%
to paint all the indigenous peoples of
 
03:34:56.630 --> 03:34:56.640 align:start position:0%
the world with the same paintbrush
 
03:34:58.710 --> 03:34:58.720 align:start position:0%
like every other group
 
03:35:02.550 --> 03:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
of european descent african descent
 
03:35:04.070 --> 03:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
asian descent
 
03:35:06.070 --> 03:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
indigenous peoples represent a wide
 
03:35:08.070 --> 03:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
variety of peoples
 
03:35:11.269 --> 03:35:11.279 align:start position:0%
now that includes peaceful industrious
 
03:35:12.950 --> 03:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
tribes and nations
 
03:35:15.030 --> 03:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
and it includes violent aggressive war
 
03:35:17.349 --> 03:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
like tribes and nations
 
03:35:18.870 --> 03:35:18.880 align:start position:0%
and if we're talking about columbus
 
03:35:19.990 --> 03:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
we're talking about landing in the
 
03:35:21.510 --> 03:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
caribbean basin
 
03:35:24.309 --> 03:35:24.319 align:start position:0%
where for example the caribs uh
 
03:35:26.389 --> 03:35:26.399 align:start position:0%
committed genocide and eliminated the
 
03:35:27.590 --> 03:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
arrow acts
 
03:35:29.750 --> 03:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
in fact what they did was they enslaved
 
03:35:31.910 --> 03:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
them and they ate them
 
03:35:34.950 --> 03:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
they were cannibals so before we declare
 
03:35:37.349 --> 03:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
an indigenous people's days
 
03:35:40.389 --> 03:35:40.399 align:start position:0%
um i think we had to carefully consider
 
03:35:42.469 --> 03:35:42.479 align:start position:0%
that there were good indigenous people
 
03:35:44.710 --> 03:35:44.720 align:start position:0%
and there were violent and war-like ones
 
03:35:46.950 --> 03:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
and uh i'm not prepared to vote for bill
 
03:35:49.429 --> 03:35:49.439 align:start position:0%
that's going to celebrate the caribs
 
03:35:51.590 --> 03:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:35:53.910 --> 03:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
representative black
 
03:35:56.870 --> 03:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
um i understand the you know reasons
 
03:35:59.030 --> 03:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
behind this bill and i'm not inherently
 
03:36:00.950 --> 03:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
opposed to them but
 
03:36:02.710 --> 03:36:02.720 align:start position:0%
uh as i and other people have stated
 
03:36:05.110 --> 03:36:05.120 align:start position:0%
before that uh you know making things
 
03:36:06.870 --> 03:36:06.880 align:start position:0%
official days is
 
03:36:09.190 --> 03:36:09.200 align:start position:0%
in my view not the preferred way to
 
03:36:09.200 --> 03:36:10.870 align:start position:0%
in my view not the preferred way to
celebrate

03:36:10.870 --> 03:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
celebrate
 
03:36:12.550 --> 03:36:12.560 align:start position:0%

03:40:26.800 --> 03:40:31.510 align:start position:0%
bye
okay

03:40:31.510 --> 03:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:33.990 --> 03:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
this bill has a different procedure for
 
03:40:36.790 --> 03:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
administrative rules
 
03:40:39.670 --> 03:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
the bill as written has some issues
 
03:40:41.590 --> 03:40:41.600 align:start position:0%
but no one will say that the
 
03:40:44.630 --> 03:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
administrative rule process is perfect
 
03:40:46.469 --> 03:40:46.479 align:start position:0%
and i know a number of people have
 
03:40:48.710 --> 03:40:48.720 align:start position:0%
expressed ideas they want to have
 
03:40:48.720 --> 03:40:49.910 align:start position:0%
expressed ideas they want to have
considered

03:40:49.910 --> 03:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
considered
 
03:40:51.670 --> 03:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
so i'd like to
 
03:40:54.950 --> 03:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
keep this bill to use as a vehicle for
 
03:40:58.309 --> 03:40:58.319 align:start position:0%
study of the rulemaking process
 
03:41:00.710 --> 03:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
representative lackas um i agree with
 
03:41:02.389 --> 03:41:02.399 align:start position:0%
all that and also in looking over the
 
03:41:05.110 --> 03:41:05.120 align:start position:0%
bill and uh talking with the sponsor
 
03:41:07.750 --> 03:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
and i found i mean there's there are on
 
03:41:09.429 --> 03:41:09.439 align:start position:0%
top on top of those complications
 
03:41:11.269 --> 03:41:11.279 align:start position:0%
there's changes that even to do what he
 
03:41:12.710 --> 03:41:12.720 align:start position:0%

represent marsh please speak to your

motion yes i think that uh we are all we
 
04:33:52.949 --> 04:33:52.959 align:start position:0%
all recognize are an agreement uh with
 
04:33:55.269 --> 04:33:55.279 align:start position:0%
senate bill 282 which has passed the
 
04:33:57.029 --> 04:33:57.039 align:start position:0%
other body
 
04:34:01.510 --> 04:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
this amendment makes house bill uh 1192
 
04:34:03.670 --> 04:34:03.680 align:start position:0%
essentially identical
 
04:34:06.070 --> 04:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
to the senate bill which was passed the
 
04:34:08.949 --> 04:34:08.959 align:start position:0%
only difference is we were contacted by
 
04:34:10.949 --> 04:34:10.959 align:start position:0%
the board of acupuncture
 
04:34:14.150 --> 04:34:14.160 align:start position:0%
licensing to add an additional phrase
 
04:34:15.349 --> 04:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
to the bill
 
04:34:17.830 --> 04:34:17.840 align:start position:0%
such that they don't have to
 
04:34:20.390 --> 04:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
pass new legislation if the national
 
04:34:22.551 --> 04:34:22.561 align:start position:0%
organization that certifies
 
04:34:25.109 --> 04:34:25.119 align:start position:0%
these licensees happens to change their
 
04:34:27.590 --> 04:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
name so we incorporated that additional
 
04:34:30.390 --> 04:34:30.400 align:start position:0%
language into the senate language and
 
04:34:33.189 --> 04:34:33.199 align:start position:0%
that's where amendment 0913 came from
 
04:34:34.310 --> 04:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
04:34:37.429 --> 04:34:37.439 align:start position:0%
blechus yeah thank you
 
04:34:39.590 --> 04:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
basically the senate did almost exactly
 
04:34:41.429 --> 04:34:41.439 align:start position:0%
what we pretty much exactly what we want
 
04:34:43.670 --> 04:34:43.680 align:start position:0%
to do and i uh
 
04:34:46.230 --> 04:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
the acupuncturists who testified before
 
04:34:48.470 --> 04:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
us did work with the senate on that and
 
04:34:50.390 --> 04:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
i communicated with them
 
04:34:52.949 --> 04:34:52.959 align:start position:0%
and got their assurance that they were
 
04:34:54.869 --> 04:34:54.879 align:start position:0%
fine with this language
 
04:34:56.949 --> 04:34:56.959 align:start position:0%
and so actually i ran into senator
 
04:34:58.310 --> 04:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
reagan in the hall and thanked him for
 
04:34:59.990 --> 04:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
doing our work for us
 
04:35:01.670 --> 04:35:01.680 align:start position:0%

wished we had done and we're going to
 
04:35:19.189 --> 04:35:19.199 align:start position:0%
apparently have an opportunity to do it
 
04:35:21.109 --> 04:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
when the senate comes over
 
04:35:23.109 --> 04:35:23.119 align:start position:0%
is add an alternate to their board other
 
04:35:24.390 --> 04:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
than that
 
04:35:27.429 --> 04:35:27.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:29.590 --> 04:35:29.600 align:start position:0%
anyone else represent black yeah well
 
04:35:31.590 --> 04:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
we'll have to amend their bill anyway to
 
04:35:34.230 --> 04:35:34.240 align:start position:0%
include the um the last minute change
 
04:35:36.230 --> 04:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
that uh representative marsh just
 
04:35:37.510 --> 04:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned so we'll have to do something
 
04:35:39.590 --> 04:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
with it anyway
 
04:35:43.990 --> 04:35:44.000 align:start position:0%

yes
 
04:39:26.310 --> 04:39:26.320 align:start position:0%
in the absence of the prime sponsor who
 
04:39:27.590 --> 04:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
we know has
 
04:39:30.070 --> 04:39:30.080 align:start position:0%
health issues
 
04:39:32.070 --> 04:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire asked me if i

would make the motion on this we did not
 
04:39:34.160 --> 04:39:35.670 align:start position:0%
would make the motion on this we did not
hear

04:39:35.670 --> 04:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
hear
 
04:39:38.230 --> 04:39:38.240 align:start position:0%
any one representing the court reporters
 
04:39:40.470 --> 04:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
that had objections to this
 
04:39:43.830 --> 04:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
and it's basically in line with
 
04:39:45.830 --> 04:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
the other advisory boards that she was
 
04:39:48.948 --> 04:39:48.958 align:start position:0%
putting forward
 
04:39:51.750 --> 04:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
and regarding i seconded and my comment
 
04:39:53.990 --> 04:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
is that
 
04:39:55.510 --> 04:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
as the
 
04:39:56.948 --> 04:39:56.958 align:start position:0%
previous speaker said the court
 
04:39:59.510 --> 04:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
reporters don't object the bill seems
 
04:40:00.868 --> 04:40:00.878 align:start position:0%
straight forward
 
04:40:00.878 --> 04:40:01.750 align:start position:0%
straight forward
and

04:40:01.750 --> 04:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:40:04.070 --> 04:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
the question of transition is not
 
04:40:07.430 --> 04:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
necessary because the
 
04:40:09.110 --> 04:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
board members are appointed by the
 
04:40:11.350 --> 04:40:11.360 align:start position:0%
executive director and
 
04:40:12.948 --> 04:40:12.958 align:start position:0%
so she can just appoint the current
 
04:40:12.958 --> 04:40:14.070 align:start position:0%
so she can just appoint the current
members

04:40:14.070 --> 04:40:14.080 align:start position:0%
members
 
04:40:16.708 --> 04:40:16.718 align:start position:0%
it's not an issue
 
04:40:21.750 --> 04:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:23.830 --> 04:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
over the representative pearson not to
 
04:40:23.840 --> 04:40:25.670 align:start position:0%
over the representative pearson not to
uh

04:40:25.670 --> 04:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:40:27.830 --> 04:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
sound like a skipping record but uh i
 
04:40:29.350 --> 04:40:29.360 align:start position:0%
would have liked to seen an alternate on
 
04:40:31.910 --> 04:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
this board also
 
04:40:33.990 --> 04:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
and if we had made any amendments we
 
04:40:37.750 --> 04:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:37.760 --> 04:40:39.590 align:start position:0%

what's a skipping record
 
04:40:45.270 --> 04:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
i as a as an avid collector of records i
 
04:40:47.910 --> 04:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
don't like to use the term broken
 
04:40:49.510 --> 04:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
because they if they're broken they
 
04:40:52.868 --> 04:40:52.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:57.110 --> 04:40:57.120 align:start position:0%

do you wish to speak to your motion i do
 
04:42:54.070 --> 04:42:54.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:42:57.830 --> 04:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:00.070 --> 04:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
we learned here
 
04:43:02.070 --> 04:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
a couple things we learned in the
 
04:43:04.708 --> 04:43:04.718 align:start position:0%
attempt here to increase hours
 
04:43:07.430 --> 04:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
was one this would in in essence allow
 
04:43:09.990 --> 04:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
teachers to work full-time
 
04:43:11.590 --> 04:43:11.600 align:start position:0%
and collect their retirement
 
04:43:13.830 --> 04:43:13.840 align:start position:0%
simultaneously which was
 
04:43:16.390 --> 04:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
certainly not the intent
 
04:43:19.350 --> 04:43:19.360 align:start position:0%
and also too we learned that with the
 
04:43:21.030 --> 04:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
affordable care act
 
04:43:23.430 --> 04:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
it would be possible for a community to
 
04:43:28.708 --> 04:43:28.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:31.590 --> 04:43:31.600 align:start position:0%
we heard
 
04:43:33.270 --> 04:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
we had some discussions in reference to
 
04:43:35.110 --> 04:43:35.120 align:start position:0%
some of the communities that do
 
04:43:38.070 --> 04:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
seasonal work like hampton and rye and
 
04:43:39.830 --> 04:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
places with beaches
 
04:43:43.030 --> 04:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
but the summertime hours for those
 
04:43:44.390 --> 04:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
per employee
 
04:43:47.350 --> 04:43:47.360 align:start position:0%
to go between the holidays is only 640
 
04:43:49.590 --> 04:43:49.600 align:start position:0%
hours so this the current law did not
 
04:43:51.030 --> 04:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
restrict or
 
04:43:54.310 --> 04:43:54.320 align:start position:0%
cause problems in any way at 1352. so
 
04:43:56.150 --> 04:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
this just really
 
04:43:56.160 --> 04:43:57.030 align:start position:0%
this just really
this

04:43:57.030 --> 04:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:43:59.910 --> 04:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
this doesn't do anything it gets us into
 
04:44:02.070 --> 04:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
a situation of potential problems and it
 
04:44:02.080 --> 04:44:03.270 align:start position:0%
a situation of potential problems and it
doesn't

04:44:03.270 --> 04:44:03.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
04:44:04.550 --> 04:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
it doesn't
 
04:44:06.390 --> 04:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
solve anything really communities are
 
04:44:08.070 --> 04:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
free to hire as many part-time people as
 
04:44:10.868 --> 04:44:10.878 align:start position:0%
they choose and this hourly restriction
 
04:44:14.150 --> 04:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
is not per community it's per person so
 
04:44:16.948 --> 04:44:16.958 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee felt that this was uh
 
04:44:19.670 --> 04:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
there was no need of this thank you
 
04:44:19.680 --> 04:44:21.590 align:start position:0%
there was no need of this thank you
representative

04:44:21.590 --> 04:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:44:23.990 --> 04:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and
 
04:44:26.150 --> 04:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
uh while i agree with representative
 
04:44:28.708 --> 04:44:28.718 align:start position:0%
pearson and very well said uh they also
 
04:44:30.628 --> 04:44:30.638 align:start position:0%
the other part that uh
 
04:44:33.110 --> 04:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
i had an issue with was the removing the
 
04:44:33.120 --> 04:44:35.030 align:start position:0%
i had an issue with was the removing the
28-day

04:44:35.030 --> 04:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
28-day
 
04:44:37.910 --> 04:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
cooling-off period during retirement um
 
04:44:41.110 --> 04:44:41.120 align:start position:0%
this was allowing those individuals to
 
04:44:43.670 --> 04:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
by removing that clause allowing them to
 
04:44:46.628 --> 04:44:46.638 align:start position:0%
retire in may and go right back to work
 
04:44:48.150 --> 04:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
full time with the number of hours
 
04:44:50.150 --> 04:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
stated if we increase them
 
04:44:52.708 --> 04:44:52.718 align:start position:0%
um so that's that's not retirement in my
 
04:44:54.948 --> 04:44:54.958 align:start position:0%
uh book retirement's retirement take
 
04:44:57.270 --> 04:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
some time off enjoy and then if you want
 
04:44:59.350 --> 04:44:59.360 align:start position:0%
to work later on in life you're more
 
04:45:00.788 --> 04:45:00.798 align:start position:0%
than welcome to
 
04:45:02.470 --> 04:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
so that that was one of the other issues
 
04:45:03.750 --> 04:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
i had with this
 
04:45:06.070 --> 04:45:06.080 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation thank you
 
04:45:08.708 --> 04:45:08.718 align:start position:0%
yes and i'd like to mention that the irs
 
04:45:10.788 --> 04:45:10.798 align:start position:0%
also had issues with
 
04:45:13.270 --> 04:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
retire and go immediately back to work
 
04:45:13.280 --> 04:45:14.390 align:start position:0%
retire and go immediately back to work
and

04:45:14.390 --> 04:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:45:16.230 --> 04:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
there's one organization we don't want
 
04:45:20.230 --> 04:45:20.240 align:start position:0%
to fall fall foul of it's the irs
 
04:45:23.270 --> 04:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
any other comments questions
 
04:45:23.280 --> 04:45:24.470 align:start position:0%
any other comments questions
representative

04:45:24.470 --> 04:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:45:25.910 --> 04:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
what's wrong with teachers working
 
04:45:31.190 --> 04:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:32.390 --> 04:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
if you're going to
 
04:45:34.390 --> 04:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
advocate for double dipping
 
04:45:36.628 --> 04:45:36.638 align:start position:0%
which is one of the six things that was
 
04:45:38.390 --> 04:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
is in retirement legislation as a
 
04:45:42.948 --> 04:45:42.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:44.550 --> 04:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
representative pearson we'll meet you

all right any other comments questions
 
04:45:53.030 --> 04:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none in that case the
 
04:45:55.350 --> 04:45:55.360 align:start position:0%
motion is inexpedient to legislate on
 
04:45:57.750 --> 04:45:57.760 align:start position:0%

is your motion i'm intending to move

that we send it to interim study
 
04:47:19.990 --> 04:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
with the idea that it's a similar
 
04:47:23.430 --> 04:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
situation to the midwives bill
 
04:47:25.670 --> 04:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
i know that representative pearson has
 
04:47:28.390 --> 04:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
an amendment but that can also be
 
04:47:31.990 --> 04:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
considered in interim study
 
04:47:32.000 --> 04:47:34.310 align:start position:0%
considered in interim study
the

04:47:34.310 --> 04:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:36.390 --> 04:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
members of this profession
 
04:47:39.350 --> 04:47:39.360 align:start position:0%
have similar issues to the midwives
 
04:47:39.360 --> 04:47:40.390 align:start position:0%
have similar issues to the midwives
and

04:47:40.390 --> 04:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
and

we broke for lunch and she'd be
 
04:47:46.628 --> 04:47:46.638 align:start position:0%
very happy to work with us
 
04:47:49.270 --> 04:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
during interim study to perfect some
 
04:47:51.270 --> 04:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
wording that will
 
04:47:53.430 --> 04:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
hopefully be satisfactory to their
 
04:48:02.310 --> 04:48:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:14.310 --> 04:48:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:16.708 --> 04:48:16.718 align:start position:0%
i am all set with that i'm just opening
 
04:48:18.310 --> 04:48:18.320 align:start position:0%

the
 
04:48:28.948 --> 04:48:28.958 align:start position:0%
when we went through this
 
04:48:31.190 --> 04:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
and keep in mind this was also made at
 
04:48:34.150 --> 04:48:34.160 align:start position:0%
the request of the director
 
04:48:35.830 --> 04:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
you know there this was a this was
 
04:48:37.430 --> 04:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
similar in the sense that there were
 
04:48:39.270 --> 04:48:39.280 align:start position:0%
some areas in here that
 
04:48:42.708 --> 04:48:42.718 align:start position:0%
the specific profession that
 
04:48:44.948 --> 04:48:44.958 align:start position:0%
we needed to amend to
 
04:48:46.948 --> 04:48:46.958 align:start position:0%
to say in consultation with and that's
 
04:48:46.958 --> 04:48:48.550 align:start position:0%

what
 
04:48:50.390 --> 04:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
an amendment i drafted
 
04:48:52.948 --> 04:48:52.958 align:start position:0%
certainly does

certainly does
the

04:48:54.948 --> 04:48:54.958 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:48:56.650 --> 04:48:56.660 align:start position:0%
that was the primary
 
04:48:56.660 --> 04:48:58.788 align:start position:0%
that was the primary
[Music]

04:48:58.788 --> 04:48:58.798 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:49:01.990 --> 04:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
cusp of the situation with this with
 
04:49:05.990 --> 04:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:06.000 --> 04:49:07.430 align:start position:0%
 
no

04:49:07.430 --> 04:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:49:09.590 --> 04:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
notes of any kind
 
04:49:12.230 --> 04:49:12.240 align:start position:0%
that the profession was
 
04:49:14.550 --> 04:49:14.560 align:start position:0%
objectionable to this i don't
 
04:49:14.560 --> 04:49:16.310 align:start position:0%
objectionable to this i don't
we

04:49:16.310 --> 04:49:16.320 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:49:18.708 --> 04:49:18.718 align:start position:0%
all i have is a letter in support from
 
04:49:21.350 --> 04:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
the office of professional licensure so
 
04:49:23.270 --> 04:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
you know and again in keeping with the
 
04:49:28.230 --> 04:49:28.240 align:start position:0%
idea that oplc should administer
 
04:49:30.230 --> 04:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
and the boards themselves should
 
04:49:32.628 --> 04:49:32.638 align:start position:0%
determine their profession that is what
 
04:49:32.638 --> 04:49:33.590 align:start position:0%
determine their profession that is what
the

04:49:33.590 --> 04:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:49:35.190 --> 04:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
that's what my amendment
 
04:49:37.750 --> 04:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
would do
 
04:49:39.670 --> 04:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
so you know if we're going to start
 
04:49:39.680 --> 04:49:40.868 align:start position:0%
so you know if we're going to start
fundamentally

04:49:40.868 --> 04:49:40.878 align:start position:0%
fundamentally
 
04:49:43.270 --> 04:49:43.280 align:start position:0%
breaking oplc apart
 
04:49:43.280 --> 04:49:44.310 align:start position:0%
breaking oplc apart
then

04:49:44.310 --> 04:49:44.320 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:49:45.510 --> 04:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
and we're not going to be consistent
 
04:49:47.190 --> 04:49:47.200 align:start position:0%
across the 54 boards this room is going
 
04:49:53.270 --> 04:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:55.670 --> 04:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
thank you uh just a question and that is
 
04:49:57.910 --> 04:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not remembering but uh
 
04:50:00.230 --> 04:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
other than the the executive director
 
04:50:02.868 --> 04:50:02.878 align:start position:0%
requesting it were there
 
04:50:05.350 --> 04:50:05.360 align:start position:0%
another question is were there any um
 
04:50:07.830 --> 04:50:07.840 align:start position:0%
issues raised you know current active
 
04:50:07.840 --> 04:50:12.150 align:start position:0%
issues raised you know current active
problems

04:50:12.150 --> 04:50:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:14.788 --> 04:50:14.798 align:start position:0%
we were all um i mean i have the
 
04:50:17.110 --> 04:50:17.120 align:start position:0%
i have the letter that was sent by
 
04:50:19.430 --> 04:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
director courtney in front of me
 
04:50:25.030 --> 04:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:27.830 --> 04:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
there's discussion about
 
04:50:27.840 --> 04:50:34.470 align:start position:0%
there's discussion about
consistency

04:50:34.470 --> 04:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:37.030 --> 04:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
it's also the letter also talks about as
 
04:50:39.510 --> 04:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
it did in others about
 
04:50:42.628 --> 04:50:42.638 align:start position:0%
clarifying responsibilities
 
04:50:43.910 --> 04:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:50:45.590 --> 04:50:45.600 align:start position:0%
oh and also too
 
04:50:47.350 --> 04:50:47.360 align:start position:0%
as we've heard
 
04:50:49.350 --> 04:50:49.360 align:start position:0%
systematically throughout this this term
 
04:50:52.470 --> 04:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
you know the the quorum issue
 
04:50:52.480 --> 04:50:54.628 align:start position:0%
you know the the quorum issue
representative

04:50:54.628 --> 04:50:54.638 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:50:56.628 --> 04:50:56.638 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and that's exactly
 
04:50:57.830 --> 04:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
what i was going to bring up i have the
 
04:50:59.910 --> 04:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
letter in front of me as well and states
 
04:50:59.920 --> 04:51:01.750 align:start position:0%
letter in front of me as well and states
that

04:51:01.750 --> 04:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:51:03.590 --> 04:51:03.600 align:start position:0%
while they're permitted to start holding
 
04:51:06.230 --> 04:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
meetings may 7 2021 the board did not
 
04:51:08.868 --> 04:51:08.878 align:start position:0%
hold monthly meetings in may and june
 
04:51:10.550 --> 04:51:10.560 align:start position:0%
stemmer november meetings were cancelled
 
04:51:12.868 --> 04:51:12.878 align:start position:0%
due to a lack of quorum
 
04:51:15.270 --> 04:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
and the board did meet in july august
 
04:51:17.830 --> 04:51:17.840 align:start position:0%
october and just the past month which
 
04:51:18.868 --> 04:51:18.878 align:start position:0%
this was
 
04:51:20.230 --> 04:51:20.240 align:start position:0%
posted in january so they did meet in
 
04:51:21.910 --> 04:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
december but it seems like they did not
 
04:51:23.270 --> 04:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
meet in november
 
04:51:24.788 --> 04:51:24.798 align:start position:0%
so it seems like it's a quorum or a
 
04:51:27.110 --> 04:51:27.120 align:start position:0%
meeting issue um unlike the midwifery
 
04:51:28.948 --> 04:51:28.958 align:start position:0%
board that they're having issues with
 
04:51:28.958 --> 04:51:30.788 align:start position:0%
board that they're having issues with
this

04:51:30.788 --> 04:51:30.798 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:51:32.708 --> 04:51:32.718 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
04:51:33.830 --> 04:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:51:36.310 --> 04:51:36.320 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry the
 
04:51:38.708 --> 04:51:38.718 align:start position:0%
representative of this board who was
 
04:51:41.750 --> 04:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
here prior to lunches has not come back
 
04:51:43.910 --> 04:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
she intimated to me that
 
04:51:46.708 --> 04:51:46.718 align:start position:0%
they had missed two meetings last year
 
04:51:49.510 --> 04:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
and two meetings the year before
 
04:51:54.070 --> 04:51:54.080 align:start position:0%
that was it basically refuting
 
04:51:56.470 --> 04:51:56.480 align:start position:0%
that testimony so i'm not sure
 
04:51:56.480 --> 04:51:57.430 align:start position:0%
that testimony so i'm not sure
who's

04:51:57.430 --> 04:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
who's
 
04:51:57.440 --> 04:51:58.708 align:start position:0%
who's
correct

04:51:58.708 --> 04:51:58.718 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:51:58.718 --> 04:51:59.910 align:start position:0%
correct
but

04:51:59.910 --> 04:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:52:03.030 --> 04:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
she was hopeful like i said that
 
04:52:05.270 --> 04:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
their case could be considered
 
04:52:07.750 --> 04:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
along with the midwives
 
04:52:10.230 --> 04:52:10.240 align:start position:0%
in study because they do feel that they
 
04:52:10.240 --> 04:52:11.110 align:start position:0%
in study because they do feel that they
have

04:52:11.110 --> 04:52:11.120 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:52:12.788 --> 04:52:12.798 align:start position:0%
issues in
 
04:52:14.868 --> 04:52:14.878 align:start position:0%
dealing with oplc
 
04:52:19.670 --> 04:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:21.910 --> 04:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
president blackest
 
04:52:23.990 --> 04:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
04:52:26.150 --> 04:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
i mean i'm inclined to
 
04:52:28.948 --> 04:52:28.958 align:start position:0%
uh oppose the interim study i mean
 
04:52:31.670 --> 04:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
we do have to have some interim study or
 
04:52:31.680 --> 04:52:32.708 align:start position:0%
we do have to have some interim study or
something

04:52:32.708 --> 04:52:32.718 align:start position:0%
something
 
04:52:34.390 --> 04:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
on the larger question of how to deal
 
04:52:35.990 --> 04:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
with the relationship between the boards
 
04:52:40.230 --> 04:52:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:42.230 --> 04:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
you know i don't know how big the
 
04:52:43.670 --> 04:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
problem is with this one meeting and
 
04:52:45.270 --> 04:52:45.280 align:start position:0%
meeting their obligations apparently
 
04:52:46.788 --> 04:52:46.798 align:start position:0%
there's some problem but maybe it's not
 
04:52:48.708 --> 04:52:48.718 align:start position:0%
that bad my inclination would be at this
 
04:52:48.718 --> 04:52:49.510 align:start position:0%
that bad my inclination would be at this
point

04:52:49.510 --> 04:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
point
 
04:52:51.350 --> 04:52:51.360 align:start position:0%
not to support the interim study to go
 
04:52:53.430 --> 04:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
with the amendment and the bill
 
04:52:56.788 --> 04:52:56.798 align:start position:0%
and then look at a larger
 
04:52:59.830 --> 04:52:59.840 align:start position:0%
potential cleanup or changes to all of
 
04:53:04.830 --> 04:53:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:07.830 --> 04:53:07.840 align:start position:0%
representative so when i go to the oplc
 
04:53:09.190 --> 04:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
website and i look at the board of
 
04:53:11.590 --> 04:53:11.600 align:start position:0%
medical imaging and radiation
 
04:53:15.350 --> 04:53:15.360 align:start position:0%
in 2020 20 they have minutes for all but
 
04:53:17.110 --> 04:53:17.120 align:start position:0%
two meetings
 
04:53:20.390 --> 04:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
and in 2021 they have meetings for all
 
04:53:22.230 --> 04:53:22.240 align:start position:0%
but two meetings
 
04:53:24.948 --> 04:53:24.958 align:start position:0%
and in 2022 they have no meetings they
 
04:53:26.948 --> 04:53:26.958 align:start position:0%
have not met at all
 
04:53:31.110 --> 04:53:31.120 align:start position:0%
so i understand i mean i would agree
 
04:53:31.120 --> 04:53:33.030 align:start position:0%
so i understand i mean i would agree
um

04:53:33.030 --> 04:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:35.590 --> 04:53:35.600 align:start position:0%
and i do think that somehow this is
 
04:53:35.600 --> 04:53:37.350 align:start position:0%
and i do think that somehow this is
issue

04:53:37.350 --> 04:53:37.360 align:start position:0%
issue
 
04:53:39.910 --> 04:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
um has to be taken up
 
04:53:41.910 --> 04:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if
 
04:53:43.510 --> 04:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
i'm going to look to those people who
 
04:53:45.270 --> 04:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
have been in this
 
04:53:47.350 --> 04:53:47.360 align:start position:0%
business longer than i
 
04:53:51.510 --> 04:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:51.520 --> 04:53:52.628 align:start position:0%
 
we

04:53:52.628 --> 04:53:52.638 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:53:54.310 --> 04:53:54.320 align:start position:0%
put it in my my
 
04:53:56.390 --> 04:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
tendency would be to put an interim
 
04:53:56.400 --> 04:53:57.350 align:start position:0%
tendency would be to put an interim
study

04:53:57.350 --> 04:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
study
 
04:54:00.150 --> 04:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
and look at it as a whole
 
04:54:01.670 --> 04:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
then passing legislation that we're
 
04:54:03.750 --> 04:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
going to undo later
 
04:54:07.270 --> 04:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
but i oh i am so sorry
 
04:54:07.280 --> 04:54:09.190 align:start position:0%
but i oh i am so sorry
um

04:54:09.190 --> 04:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:09.200 --> 04:54:10.550 align:start position:0%
um
so

04:54:10.550 --> 04:54:10.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:54:13.830 --> 04:54:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:15.670 --> 04:54:15.680 align:start position:0%
so i'll leave it up to the committee to
 
04:54:18.310 --> 04:54:18.320 align:start position:0%
convince me one way the other
 
04:54:20.070 --> 04:54:20.080 align:start position:0%
representation i'm sure
 
04:54:23.110 --> 04:54:23.120 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah i think the hope was
 
04:54:24.948 --> 04:54:24.958 align:start position:0%
as we had
 
04:54:27.030 --> 04:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
stated previously that
 
04:54:29.110 --> 04:54:29.120 align:start position:0%
we're going to try and put
 
04:54:32.310 --> 04:54:32.320 align:start position:0%
something in place to have oversight
 
04:54:34.070 --> 04:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
over oplc
 
04:54:36.550 --> 04:54:36.560 align:start position:0%
and i think that
 
04:54:39.110 --> 04:54:39.120 align:start position:0%
the hope from this board was that
 
04:54:41.590 --> 04:54:41.600 align:start position:0%
nothing would be done until that
 
04:54:45.270 --> 04:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:48.948 --> 04:54:48.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:50.788 --> 04:54:50.798 align:start position:0%
has there already been
 
04:54:53.110 --> 04:54:53.120 align:start position:0%
this this whole thing is the turning
 
04:54:55.350 --> 04:54:55.360 align:start position:0%
into a quagmire or has the potential for
 
04:54:57.590 --> 04:54:57.600 align:start position:0%
that as i mentioned earlier
 
04:54:59.830 --> 04:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
has there been any discussion thought
 
04:55:01.830 --> 04:55:01.840 align:start position:0%
about virtual meetings
 
04:55:03.510 --> 04:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that solve a lot of problems i
 
04:55:05.350 --> 04:55:05.360 align:start position:0%
mean we don't really have to sit around
 
04:55:07.110 --> 04:55:07.120 align:start position:0%
the same table for
 
04:55:10.310 --> 04:55:10.320 align:start position:0%
this uh yes that is under consideration
 
04:55:13.750 --> 04:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
in other committees
 
04:55:16.150 --> 04:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
represent fellows you had a comment um
 
04:55:16.160 --> 04:55:17.510 align:start position:0%
represent fellows you had a comment um
yes

04:55:17.510 --> 04:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:55:18.948 --> 04:55:18.958 align:start position:0%
based on the
 
04:55:20.868 --> 04:55:20.878 align:start position:0%
state of the state speech we know that
 
04:55:23.270 --> 04:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
the governor wants to do something with
 
04:55:23.280 --> 04:55:24.788 align:start position:0%
the governor wants to do something with
oplc

04:55:24.788 --> 04:55:24.798 align:start position:0%
oplc
 
04:55:27.110 --> 04:55:27.120 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:55:29.750 --> 04:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
there seems so there seems to be so much
 
04:55:32.070 --> 04:55:32.080 align:start position:0%
in up in the air about
 
04:55:35.030 --> 04:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
the operation of oplc and what kinds of
 
04:55:37.750 --> 04:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
changes are meeting are needed i'm
 
04:55:39.670 --> 04:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
thinking that
 
04:55:42.230 --> 04:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
there would probably be no harm in
 
04:55:47.510 --> 04:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:48.948 --> 04:55:48.958 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
04:55:51.350 --> 04:55:51.360 align:start position:0%
i'd like to comment that this is a very
 
04:55:53.910 --> 04:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
new board we only passed the requirement
 
04:55:55.990 --> 04:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
for licensing these people i think three
 
04:55:57.350 --> 04:55:57.360 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
04:56:00.948 --> 04:56:00.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:03.430 --> 04:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
it doesn't encourage me to believe that
 
04:56:05.430 --> 04:56:05.440 align:start position:0%
we need to license these people if they
 
04:56:05.440 --> 04:56:06.948 align:start position:0%
we need to license these people if they
can't

04:56:06.948 --> 04:56:06.958 align:start position:0%
can't
 
04:56:09.190 --> 04:56:09.200 align:start position:0%
establish a board and have and have a
 
04:56:09.200 --> 04:56:10.470 align:start position:0%
establish a board and have and have a
quorum

04:56:10.470 --> 04:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
quorum
 
04:56:13.510 --> 04:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:16.470 --> 04:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
it seems odd to me that they that the
 
04:56:16.480 --> 04:56:17.430 align:start position:0%
it seems odd to me that they that the
newly

04:56:17.430 --> 04:56:17.440 align:start position:0%
newly
 
04:56:20.070 --> 04:56:20.080 align:start position:0%
newly appointed and and presumably
 
04:56:22.788 --> 04:56:22.798 align:start position:0%
enthusiastic members of the board don't
 
04:56:24.788 --> 04:56:24.798 align:start position:0%
make the meeting
 
04:56:24.798 --> 04:56:27.190 align:start position:0%
make the meeting
but

04:56:27.190 --> 04:56:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:29.510 --> 04:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
i would remind the chair that the two
 
04:56:31.910 --> 04:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
years in question were during this
 
04:56:31.920 --> 04:56:33.190 align:start position:0%
years in question were during this
pandemic

04:56:33.190 --> 04:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
04:56:35.670 --> 04:56:35.680 align:start position:0%
and i imagine that
 
04:56:38.150 --> 04:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
anyone in the health care field
 
04:56:39.350 --> 04:56:39.360 align:start position:0%
might have had
 
04:56:42.948 --> 04:56:42.958 align:start position:0%
trouble making time to attend
 
04:56:44.230 --> 04:56:44.240 align:start position:0%
board meetings
 
04:56:45.830 --> 04:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
in addition to their
 
04:56:48.830 --> 04:56:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:52.788 --> 04:56:52.798 align:start position:0%
rip representative marsh in the grota
 
04:56:55.430 --> 04:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh yes uh thank you and uh in response
 
04:56:57.910 --> 04:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
to the chair's comments i will remind us
 
04:57:00.390 --> 04:57:00.400 align:start position:0%
all that we're talking about people who
 
04:57:03.670 --> 04:57:03.680 align:start position:0%
expose the public to radiation um and
 
04:57:05.510 --> 04:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
considering the significant and
 
04:57:07.510 --> 04:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
long-lasting harmful effects to certain
 
04:57:10.070 --> 04:57:10.080 align:start position:0%
members of the public who may be exposed
 
04:57:12.070 --> 04:57:12.080 align:start position:0%
to doses that are either toxic on their
 
04:57:14.948 --> 04:57:14.958 align:start position:0%
own regard or are carcinogenic
 
04:57:16.948 --> 04:57:16.958 align:start position:0%
or harmful in other ways
 
04:57:19.110 --> 04:57:19.120 align:start position:0%
that it very much is within our mission
 
04:57:20.628 --> 04:57:20.638 align:start position:0%
to protect the public to make sure that
 
04:57:22.150 --> 04:57:22.160 align:start position:0%
the people who are doing these things
 
04:57:27.350 --> 04:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:29.830 --> 04:57:29.840 align:start position:0%
representative pearson
 
04:57:31.430 --> 04:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
well the only harm here we're talking
 
04:57:33.110 --> 04:57:33.120 align:start position:0%
about is if this board doesn't meet
 
04:57:34.948 --> 04:57:34.958 align:start position:0%
everything stops right because you've
 
04:57:38.070 --> 04:57:38.080 align:start position:0%
got folks that we have a
 
04:57:39.910 --> 04:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
the entire medical field is hurting for
 
04:57:39.920 --> 04:57:41.110 align:start position:0%
the entire medical field is hurting for
people

04:57:41.110 --> 04:57:41.120 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:57:41.120 --> 04:57:41.830 align:start position:0%
people
so

04:57:41.830 --> 04:57:41.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:57:45.110 --> 04:57:45.120 align:start position:0%
it's not really comforting to me that
 
04:57:47.270 --> 04:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
they can
 
04:57:49.510 --> 04:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
randomly go for two months at a whack
 
04:57:51.190 --> 04:57:51.200 align:start position:0%
without having a meeting when when
 
04:57:53.190 --> 04:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
they're trying to
 
04:57:55.030 --> 04:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:57:55.040 --> 04:57:56.310 align:start position:0%
you know
process

04:57:56.310 --> 04:57:56.320 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:57:59.110 --> 04:57:59.120 align:start position:0%
applications and licensing and whatnot
 
04:58:01.990 --> 04:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
under the current makeup
 
04:58:04.150 --> 04:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
04:58:05.830 --> 04:58:05.840 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to correct this and i'm
 
04:58:09.110 --> 04:58:09.120 align:start position:0%
going to say this again in 2020
 
04:58:11.990 --> 04:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
the board met 10 out of the 12 months
 
04:58:14.470 --> 04:58:14.480 align:start position:0%
and if you look at their minutes they
 
04:58:16.310 --> 04:58:16.320 align:start position:0%
were they had a quorum there were people
 
04:58:18.948 --> 04:58:18.958 align:start position:0%
there and they were action taken the
 
04:58:22.868 --> 04:58:22.878 align:start position:0%
same in 2020 2021 so the board is
 
04:58:22.878 --> 04:58:24.070 align:start position:0%
same in 2020 2021 so the board is
meeting

04:58:24.070 --> 04:58:24.080 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
04:58:26.390 --> 04:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
and they are meeting
 
04:58:29.110 --> 04:58:29.120 align:start position:0%
in consecutive months
 
04:58:32.470 --> 04:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
so i don't see that this board is
 
04:58:33.910 --> 04:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know why they haven't met in
 
04:58:37.190 --> 04:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
2022 yet but i don't believe that this
 
04:58:39.590 --> 04:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
board has a history of being
 
04:58:39.600 --> 04:58:41.750 align:start position:0%
board has a history of being
um

04:58:41.750 --> 04:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:48.070 --> 04:58:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:49.750 --> 04:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
no but it has has not followed their
 
04:58:51.750 --> 04:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
responsibilities i see
 
04:58:53.590 --> 04:58:53.600 align:start position:0%
if you i see
 
04:58:56.628 --> 04:58:56.638 align:start position:0%
from what i i'm reading that they are
 
04:58:58.550 --> 04:58:58.560 align:start position:0%
meeting and they are taking action on
 
04:59:04.470 --> 04:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:06.470 --> 04:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
comments represent goalie
 
04:59:09.510 --> 04:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and
 
04:59:11.430 --> 04:59:11.440 align:start position:0%
looking at 2021
 
04:59:13.750 --> 04:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
they did not meet in
 
04:59:15.590 --> 04:59:15.600 align:start position:0%
may or june
 
04:59:17.190 --> 04:59:17.200 align:start position:0%
there is no one of the things i think we
 
04:59:18.628 --> 04:59:18.638 align:start position:0%
need to look at when we look at the
 
04:59:21.430 --> 04:59:21.440 align:start position:0%
whole operation of oplc
 
04:59:24.470 --> 04:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
if if there are no items to put on the
 
04:59:26.230 --> 04:59:26.240 align:start position:0%
agenda is it
 
04:59:28.788 --> 04:59:28.798 align:start position:0%
isn't it reasonable that they may not
 
04:59:32.150 --> 04:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
have met for that reason
 
04:59:32.160 --> 04:59:33.670 align:start position:0%
have met for that reason
and

04:59:33.670 --> 04:59:33.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:59:35.430 --> 04:59:35.440 align:start position:0%
and then the other part of my question
 
04:59:35.440 --> 04:59:36.390 align:start position:0%
and then the other part of my question
is

04:59:36.390 --> 04:59:36.400 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:59:38.470 --> 04:59:38.480 align:start position:0%
if if representative
 
04:59:41.510 --> 04:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
grota is looking at minutes
 
04:59:43.430 --> 04:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
in most cases
 
04:59:46.310 --> 04:59:46.320 align:start position:0%
the minutes would have are approved in
 
04:59:48.868 --> 04:59:48.878 align:start position:0%
the meeting after
 
04:59:51.510 --> 04:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
and so it's not going to show up until
 
04:59:51.520 --> 04:59:52.788 align:start position:0%
and so it's not going to show up until
then

04:59:52.788 --> 04:59:52.798 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:59:56.070 --> 04:59:56.080 align:start position:0%
and also if it's not posted yet in terms
 
04:59:56.080 --> 04:59:56.750 align:start position:0%
and also if it's not posted yet in terms
of

04:59:56.750 --> 04:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:59:56.760 --> 04:59:58.390 align:start position:0%
of
2022

04:59:58.390 --> 04:59:58.400 align:start position:0%
2022
 
05:00:00.470 --> 05:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
that's probably an administrative
 
05:00:03.110 --> 05:00:03.120 align:start position:0%
function of oplc i'm not saying that
 
05:00:05.350 --> 05:00:05.360 align:start position:0%
they met or they didn't meet you know
 
05:00:07.510 --> 05:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
i'm just saying that we don't really
 
05:00:09.590 --> 05:00:09.600 align:start position:0%
know for sure what's going on for for
 
05:00:13.030 --> 05:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:16.310 --> 05:00:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:28.070 --> 05:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:29.320 --> 05:00:29.330 align:start position:0%
if i may madam chair
 
05:00:29.330 --> 05:00:30.868 align:start position:0%
if i may madam chair
[Music]

05:00:30.868 --> 05:00:30.878 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:00:32.948 --> 05:00:32.958 align:start position:0%
i feel like i'm speaking on behalf of
 
05:00:37.110 --> 05:00:37.120 align:start position:0%
this board but i'll just tell you that
 
05:00:39.350 --> 05:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
the representative of the board that was
 
05:00:42.948 --> 05:00:42.958 align:start position:0%
here that i spoke with before lunch
 
05:00:46.070 --> 05:00:46.080 align:start position:0%
had similar problems that the
 
05:00:48.550 --> 05:00:48.560 align:start position:0%
chair of the midwifery board indicated
 
05:00:48.560 --> 05:00:49.910 align:start position:0%
chair of the midwifery board indicated
that

05:00:49.910 --> 05:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:00:52.150 --> 05:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
for example the
 
05:00:54.310 --> 05:00:54.320 align:start position:0%
oplc had said
 
05:00:56.310 --> 05:00:56.320 align:start position:0%
you know you haven't dealt with an
 
05:00:58.948 --> 05:00:58.958 align:start position:0%
application from such and such
 
05:01:00.310 --> 05:01:00.320 align:start position:0%
and she said
 
05:01:02.550 --> 05:01:02.560 align:start position:0%
they never presented it to them to look
 
05:01:04.230 --> 05:01:04.240 align:start position:0%
at so
 
05:01:06.310 --> 05:01:06.320 align:start position:0%
again it's it's difficulties that the
 
05:01:09.510 --> 05:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
boards are having dealing with oplc
 
05:01:11.830 --> 05:01:11.840 align:start position:0%
i don't know who's right and who's wrong
 
05:01:13.910 --> 05:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
but i think it's worth looking at in
 
05:01:15.190 --> 05:01:15.200 align:start position:0%
more depth
 
05:01:17.830 --> 05:01:17.840 align:start position:0%
okay i don't recall at the hearing
 
05:01:20.310 --> 05:01:20.320 align:start position:0%
having any representatives from the
 
05:01:21.670 --> 05:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
from the
 
05:01:21.680 --> 05:01:24.070 align:start position:0%
from the
uh

05:01:24.070 --> 05:01:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:26.470 --> 05:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
from the affected party
 
05:01:27.990 --> 05:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
representative pearson did they support
 
05:01:30.230 --> 05:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
your subcommittee
 
05:01:31.430 --> 05:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
thank you no
 
05:01:33.190 --> 05:01:33.200 align:start position:0%
there was no one
 
05:01:36.628 --> 05:01:36.638 align:start position:0%
we no we didn't have any
 
05:01:39.990 --> 05:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:42.150 --> 05:01:42.160 align:start position:0%
so if someone's coming now in the 11th
 
05:01:43.350 --> 05:01:43.360 align:start position:0%
hour that's
 
05:01:44.788 --> 05:01:44.798 align:start position:0%
it would have been much nicer if they
 
05:01:46.070 --> 05:01:46.080 align:start position:0%
had been here
 
05:01:48.230 --> 05:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
earlier in the process so we could at
 
05:01:49.910 --> 05:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
least have had a discussion a two-way
 
05:01:51.270 --> 05:01:51.280 align:start position:0%
discussion with them
 
05:01:53.430 --> 05:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
i can appreciate that
 
05:01:56.070 --> 05:01:56.080 align:start position:0%
i will say that i've heard from
 
05:01:57.830 --> 05:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
several representatives of the boards
 
05:02:00.390 --> 05:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
that they were not notified that these
 
05:02:02.868 --> 05:02:02.878 align:start position:0%
bills were in the works
 
05:02:04.708 --> 05:02:04.718 align:start position:0%
yes it's probably their responsibility
 
05:02:08.868 --> 05:02:08.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:11.270 --> 05:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
or the cosmetologist
 
05:02:13.830 --> 05:02:13.840 align:start position:0%
so that's uh
 
05:02:13.840 --> 05:02:15.430 align:start position:0%
so that's uh
i'm

05:02:15.430 --> 05:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
05:02:15.440 --> 05:02:16.150 align:start position:0%
i'm
i

05:02:16.150 --> 05:02:16.160 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:02:18.230 --> 05:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
ignorance of the law is no excuse as
 
05:02:19.750 --> 05:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
they say it just
 
05:02:23.190 --> 05:02:23.200 align:start position:0%
it just seems that if oplc was
 
05:02:25.110 --> 05:02:25.120 align:start position:0%
putting these forward that they would
 
05:02:29.110 --> 05:02:29.120 align:start position:0%
have at least notified the board members
 
05:02:31.830 --> 05:02:31.840 align:start position:0%
okay any further comments questions
 
05:02:31.840 --> 05:02:36.150 align:start position:0%
okay any further comments questions
discussion

did i omit representative bailey so let
 
05:04:25.750 --> 05:04:25.760 align:start position:0%

i recorded you without asking you
 
05:04:33.830 --> 05:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
it's unacceptable it's more efficient
 
05:04:34.708 --> 05:04:34.718 align:start position:0%
that way
 
05:04:37.510 --> 05:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
am i that predictable
 
05:04:39.030 --> 05:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
well madam chair based on the the
 
05:04:41.110 --> 05:04:41.120 align:start position:0%
failure of that um
 
05:04:42.550 --> 05:04:42.560 align:start position:0%
perhaps we should announce the vote
 
05:04:44.230 --> 05:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
first okay uh
 
05:04:46.868 --> 05:04:46.878 align:start position:0%
three in favor of interim study 16
 
05:04:50.390 --> 05:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
opposed okay the motion fails 3-16
 
05:04:52.230 --> 05:04:52.240 align:start position:0%
representative pearson
 
05:04:55.030 --> 05:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
in lieu of that i'll move ought to pass
 
05:04:57.030 --> 05:04:57.040 align:start position:0%
with uh and i'll
 
05:04:59.110 --> 05:04:59.120 align:start position:0%
introduce an amendment
 
05:05:02.070 --> 05:05:02.080 align:start position:0%
okay which amendment it will be
 
05:05:05.110 --> 05:05:05.120 align:start position:0%
929 h
 
05:05:07.830 --> 05:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
i passed out copies um
 
05:05:10.390 --> 05:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
and there's plenty if i missed you
 
05:05:12.868 --> 05:05:12.878 align:start position:0%
okay is there a second
 
05:05:15.830 --> 05:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
second okay seconded by representative
 
05:05:17.350 --> 05:05:17.360 align:start position:0%
rhodes do we should speak to your motion
 
05:05:19.190 --> 05:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
reference madam chair thank you
 
05:05:21.510 --> 05:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
so one of the things that uh
 
05:05:23.030 --> 05:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
in keeping with
 
05:05:24.868 --> 05:05:24.878 align:start position:0%
the purpose of oplc is to do
 
05:05:26.470 --> 05:05:26.480 align:start position:0%
administrative things
 
05:05:30.150 --> 05:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
and not run professions so
 
05:05:32.070 --> 05:05:32.080 align:start position:0%
this is this is a similar concept of
 
05:05:34.470 --> 05:05:34.480 align:start position:0%
going through and looking at areas that
 
05:05:34.480 --> 05:05:36.390 align:start position:0%
going through and looking at areas that
involve

05:05:36.390 --> 05:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
involve
 
05:05:38.550 --> 05:05:38.560 align:start position:0%
where the board where the executive
 
05:05:40.708 --> 05:05:40.718 align:start position:0%
director in consultation with the board
 
05:05:43.110 --> 05:05:43.120 align:start position:0%
should be doing the various function and
 
05:05:45.350 --> 05:05:45.360 align:start position:0%
not the executive director alone and
 
05:05:45.360 --> 05:05:46.788 align:start position:0%
not the executive director alone and
that's

05:05:46.788 --> 05:05:46.798 align:start position:0%
that's
 
05:05:49.510 --> 05:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
in its entirety what the amendment did
 
05:05:49.520 --> 05:05:52.550 align:start position:0%
in its entirety what the amendment did
in

05:05:52.550 --> 05:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:55.510 --> 05:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:57.590 --> 05:05:57.600 align:start position:0%
other than that the the amendment or the
 
05:05:59.830 --> 05:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
bill stays the same
 
05:06:01.750 --> 05:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative rhodes do
 
05:06:03.030 --> 05:06:03.040 align:start position:0%
you wish to speak
 
05:06:05.670 --> 05:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair okay
 
05:06:12.070 --> 05:06:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:12.080 --> 05:06:13.270 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:06:13.270 --> 05:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:06:15.590 --> 05:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
i will i will mention that the amendment
 
05:06:18.550 --> 05:06:18.560 align:start position:0%
also adds an alternate to the board
 
05:06:24.070 --> 05:06:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:25.670 --> 05:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
people in in on
 
05:06:27.910 --> 05:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
available for uh
 
05:06:29.430 --> 05:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
to fill in
 
05:06:29.440 --> 05:06:30.868 align:start position:0%
to fill in
any

05:06:30.868 --> 05:06:30.878 align:start position:0%
any
 
05:06:32.708 --> 05:06:32.718 align:start position:0%
representative bailly you sort of
 
05:06:34.868 --> 05:06:34.878 align:start position:0%
suggested that might be questions i mean
 
05:06:37.590 --> 05:06:37.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't this kind of
 
05:06:39.750 --> 05:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
we did a lot of this last year trying to
 
05:06:42.070 --> 05:06:42.080 align:start position:0%
consolidate it all to be the same and we
 
05:06:43.830 --> 05:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
seem to be
 
05:06:45.430 --> 05:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
pretty far into this year with this
 
05:06:45.440 --> 05:06:46.470 align:start position:0%
pretty far into this year with this
stuff

05:06:46.470 --> 05:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
05:06:49.670 --> 05:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
and we've discovered suddenly that
 
05:06:50.830 --> 05:06:50.840 align:start position:0%
that's not quite
 
05:06:53.510 --> 05:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
right how does this get fixed ultimately
 
05:06:55.110 --> 05:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
if you want them all to be the same this
 
05:06:57.510 --> 05:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
is part of the actually the normal
 
05:07:00.550 --> 05:07:00.560 align:start position:0%
process a couple of years ago we
 
05:07:00.560 --> 05:07:01.910 align:start position:0%
process a couple of years ago we
essentially

05:07:01.910 --> 05:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
05:07:04.830 --> 05:07:04.840 align:start position:0%
shoved all the boards under oplc
 
05:07:08.150 --> 05:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
and uh have been spending the last few
 
05:07:11.110 --> 05:07:11.120 align:start position:0%
years finding places where we didn't do
 
05:07:13.190 --> 05:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
a thorough enough job
 
05:07:13.200 --> 05:07:14.628 align:start position:0%
a thorough enough job
uh

05:07:14.628 --> 05:07:14.638 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:07:17.910 --> 05:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
so we're cleaning up the language this
 
05:07:17.920 --> 05:07:18.830 align:start position:0%
so we're cleaning up the language this
this

05:07:18.830 --> 05:07:18.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:07:23.590 --> 05:07:23.600 align:start position:0%
the thrust to make them advisory is
 
05:07:25.670 --> 05:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
has been muttered about but this is the
 
05:07:28.550 --> 05:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
first time it's come out into bills
 
05:07:32.070 --> 05:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
and it looks like a lot because we
 
05:07:34.310 --> 05:07:34.320 align:start position:0%
put each individual board into a
 
05:07:35.750 --> 05:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
separate bill
 
05:07:38.070 --> 05:07:38.080 align:start position:0%
to deal with it rather than having one
 
05:07:40.070 --> 05:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
massive bill that would deal with you
 
05:07:42.628 --> 05:07:42.638 align:start position:0%
know a large number of boards
 
05:07:42.638 --> 05:07:43.670 align:start position:0%
know a large number of boards
and

05:07:43.670 --> 05:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:07:45.750 --> 05:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
be because it's easier to deal with them
 
05:07:48.868 --> 05:07:48.878 align:start position:0%
one at a time
 
05:07:50.708 --> 05:07:50.718 align:start position:0%
follow-up yeah
 
05:07:52.470 --> 05:07:52.480 align:start position:0%
it would seem that we're introducing
 
05:07:54.230 --> 05:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies again
 
05:07:55.350 --> 05:07:55.360 align:start position:0%
and that we're
 
05:07:56.788 --> 05:07:56.798 align:start position:0%
of course we're doing it this way for
 
05:08:00.310 --> 05:08:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:02.708 --> 05:08:02.718 align:start position:0%
well that's why all
 
05:08:05.110 --> 05:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
a number of these bills were introduced
 
05:08:07.750 --> 05:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
by various members of the committee
 
05:08:09.830 --> 05:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
and they are they started out as
 
05:08:09.840 --> 05:08:11.270 align:start position:0%
and they are they started out as
identical

05:08:11.270 --> 05:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
identical
 
05:08:14.310 --> 05:08:14.320 align:start position:0%
we me essentially and we made changes as
 
05:08:14.320 --> 05:08:15.750 align:start position:0%
we me essentially and we made changes as
necessary

05:08:15.750 --> 05:08:15.760 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
05:08:18.070 --> 05:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
the idea of board alternates came out
 
05:08:19.830 --> 05:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
during discussion and so we're adding
 
05:08:23.030 --> 05:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:23.040 --> 05:08:24.310 align:start position:0%
 
yes

05:08:24.310 --> 05:08:24.320 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:08:25.830 --> 05:08:25.840 align:start position:0%
the entire
 
05:08:28.390 --> 05:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
like many other sections of our laws we
 
05:08:31.670 --> 05:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
really need to
 
05:08:34.550 --> 05:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
wipe out and completely rewrite the
 
05:08:36.628 --> 05:08:36.638 align:start position:0%
licensing statutes
 
05:08:38.628 --> 05:08:38.638 align:start position:0%
but that's going to be
 
05:08:40.788 --> 05:08:40.798 align:start position:0%
a horrendous job and you need somebody
 
05:08:43.350 --> 05:08:43.360 align:start position:0%
dedicated to do it
 
05:08:44.628 --> 05:08:44.638 align:start position:0%
if you
 
05:08:46.470 --> 05:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
if you want to volunteer or start
 
05:08:52.230 --> 05:08:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:53.750 --> 05:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
i beg your pardon thank you thank you
 
05:08:55.910 --> 05:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
for answering my question okay you know
 
05:08:55.920 --> 05:08:56.788 align:start position:0%
for answering my question okay you know
it's

05:08:56.788 --> 05:08:56.798 align:start position:0%
it's
 
05:08:58.788 --> 05:08:58.798 align:start position:0%
yes it's it looks messy but that's
 
05:08:58.798 --> 05:09:00.470 align:start position:0%
yes it's it looks messy but that's
because

05:09:00.470 --> 05:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:09:03.430 --> 05:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:05.510 --> 05:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
representative goalie
 
05:09:06.868 --> 05:09:06.878 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and i thought i
 
05:09:08.550 --> 05:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
saw representative scitec sticking his
 
05:09:10.310 --> 05:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
chin out to take on that task but i may
 
05:09:12.550 --> 05:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
be pointing
 
05:09:14.948 --> 05:09:14.958 align:start position:0%
um but getting back to the bill
 
05:09:14.958 --> 05:09:15.910 align:start position:0%
um but getting back to the bill
um

05:09:15.910 --> 05:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:18.390 --> 05:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
as i looked at the minutes
 
05:09:21.190 --> 05:09:21.200 align:start position:0%
uh back in 2021 and
 
05:09:23.110 --> 05:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
back as we go
 
05:09:23.120 --> 05:09:24.230 align:start position:0%
back as we go
um

05:09:24.230 --> 05:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:25.830 --> 05:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
you look in the minutes and you see
 
05:09:27.590 --> 05:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
their task of
 
05:09:30.390 --> 05:09:30.400 align:start position:0%
approving applications and renewals
 
05:09:32.390 --> 05:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
and missing four months
 
05:09:34.708 --> 05:09:34.718 align:start position:0%
a third of the year of the meetings when
 
05:09:36.708 --> 05:09:36.718 align:start position:0%
you're approving renewals and
 
05:09:36.718 --> 05:09:38.310 align:start position:0%
you're approving renewals and
applications

05:09:38.310 --> 05:09:38.320 align:start position:0%
applications
 
05:09:39.750 --> 05:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
there is an issue there when you're
 
05:09:41.830 --> 05:09:41.840 align:start position:0%
looking to get people licensed in a
 
05:09:43.350 --> 05:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
timely fashion
 
05:09:43.360 --> 05:09:44.230 align:start position:0%
timely fashion
um

05:09:44.230 --> 05:09:44.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:45.510 --> 05:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
so that's the reason why i'm going to
 
05:09:47.990 --> 05:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
support the bill as amended for those
 
05:09:50.390 --> 05:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
reasons thank you thank you
 
05:09:53.190 --> 05:09:53.200 align:start position:0%
we try to deal with that but still
 
05:09:57.190 --> 05:09:57.200 align:start position:0%
it it something that's got to be done
 
05:10:00.628 --> 05:10:00.638 align:start position:0%

05:13:34.470 --> 05:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
bill 1135.
 
05:13:38.150 --> 05:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
zero eight okay is there a second second
 
05:13:42.868 --> 05:13:42.878 align:start position:0%
zero eight four seven eight okay
 
05:13:44.070 --> 05:13:44.080 align:start position:0%
okay that's
 
05:13:46.948 --> 05:13:46.958 align:start position:0%
represent fellows you seconded
 
05:13:50.788 --> 05:13:50.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:52.788 --> 05:13:52.798 align:start position:0%
do we should speak to your motion um i
 
05:13:54.788 --> 05:13:54.798 align:start position:0%
do thank you um
 
05:13:58.070 --> 05:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
i certainly support audits and uh you
 
05:14:00.150 --> 05:14:00.160 align:start position:0%
know i wanna
 
05:14:02.070 --> 05:14:02.080 align:start position:0%
hopefully find out that this program is
 
05:14:04.708 --> 05:14:04.718 align:start position:0%
working well but if we're gonna
 
05:14:06.070 --> 05:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
have the state spend the money on an
 
05:14:07.910 --> 05:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
audit i'd like to have it be an audit
 
05:14:09.110 --> 05:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
that's going to provide useful
 
05:14:11.910 --> 05:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
information and um
 
05:14:13.430 --> 05:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
you know as there was some discussion
 
05:14:16.550 --> 05:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
before and there was a letter um
 
05:14:19.510 --> 05:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
that the chair passed around from
 
05:14:21.190 --> 05:14:21.200 align:start position:0%
the audit which i don't know who's it
 
05:14:22.550 --> 05:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
from but
 
05:14:24.550 --> 05:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
for the
 
05:14:26.948 --> 05:14:26.958 align:start position:0%
legislative budget assistant i believe
 
05:14:28.708 --> 05:14:28.718 align:start position:0%
that's on the back
 
05:14:30.150 --> 05:14:30.160 align:start position:0%
from the audit division of the
 
05:14:31.510 --> 05:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
legislative budget
 
05:14:33.510 --> 05:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
stephen smith of the audit director of
 
05:14:34.948 --> 05:14:34.958 align:start position:0%
the audit division
 
05:14:34.958 --> 05:14:35.990 align:start position:0%
the audit division
um

05:14:35.990 --> 05:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:39.190 --> 05:14:39.200 align:start position:0%
you know they like they want to have
 
05:14:42.070 --> 05:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
at a minimum a year's worth of steady
 
05:14:43.750 --> 05:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
state operation
 
05:14:46.550 --> 05:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
and if they have more two three you know
 
05:14:49.030 --> 05:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
or more years then they can actually do
 
05:14:50.628 --> 05:14:50.638 align:start position:0%
a better job because they can look and
 
05:14:53.590 --> 05:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
see trends and how things are going
 
05:14:53.600 --> 05:14:55.190 align:start position:0%
see trends and how things are going
so

05:14:55.190 --> 05:14:55.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:14:58.628 --> 05:14:58.638 align:start position:0%
what i want to make sure is that
 
05:15:00.550 --> 05:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
this program has been in place with its
 
05:15:03.590 --> 05:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
final rules for a minimum of a year
 
05:15:05.430 --> 05:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
before the odds done and if it runs
 
05:15:06.948 --> 05:15:06.958 align:start position:0%
longer you know somewhat longer than a
 
05:15:09.110 --> 05:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
year in some ways that's better although
 
05:15:11.110 --> 05:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
i i do want to know relatively soon you
 
05:15:12.948 --> 05:15:12.958 align:start position:0%
know not too far not indefinitely far
 
05:15:15.110 --> 05:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
out how it's going so
 
05:15:17.350 --> 05:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
what this amendment does is it uh moves
 
05:15:19.430 --> 05:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
the effective date out by a year
 
05:15:23.590 --> 05:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
to july 1st of 2023 rather than 2022
 
05:15:25.670 --> 05:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
and i understand that the audit isn't
 
05:15:27.590 --> 05:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
going to occur at that point because the
 
05:15:29.110 --> 05:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
whole process to go through to get the
 
05:15:31.030 --> 05:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
audit going
 
05:15:33.110 --> 05:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
but having it somewhat further out i
 
05:15:35.350 --> 05:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
don't think is a problem i want to make
 
05:15:38.150 --> 05:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
very sure that it's not going to happen
 
05:15:40.230 --> 05:15:40.240 align:start position:0%
until there's been a minimum of one year
 
05:15:42.470 --> 05:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
of steady state operation preferably
 
05:15:45.830 --> 05:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
more thank you
 
05:15:47.590 --> 05:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
okay restaurant do you wish to speak to
 
05:15:48.868 --> 05:15:48.878 align:start position:0%
your second
 
05:15:50.708 --> 05:15:50.718 align:start position:0%
i do thank you and i'm chair because of
 
05:15:52.470 --> 05:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
the situation that we have with covet i
 
05:15:53.990 --> 05:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
don't think that
 
05:15:56.150 --> 05:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
um i agree that we need one year of
 
05:15:58.310 --> 05:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
steady state and we were that's been
 
05:16:00.868 --> 05:16:00.878 align:start position:0%
interrupted with the pandemic so i think
 
05:16:02.230 --> 05:16:02.240 align:start position:0%
putting it on a year we get more
 
05:16:05.190 --> 05:16:05.200 align:start position:0%
reliable data thank you
 
05:16:06.948 --> 05:16:06.958 align:start position:0%
representatives i could
 
05:16:09.750 --> 05:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
yeah uh when i mentioned the very same
 
05:16:11.670 --> 05:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
thing to representative fellows a while
 
05:16:14.230 --> 05:16:14.240 align:start position:0%
back she pointed out that as a practical
 
05:16:14.240 --> 05:16:15.270 align:start position:0%
back she pointed out that as a practical
matter

05:16:15.270 --> 05:16:15.280 align:start position:0%
matter
 
05:16:17.190 --> 05:16:17.200 align:start position:0%
no matter what they just couldn't get to
 
05:16:19.990 --> 05:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
it after a full year was in place so i'm
 
05:16:22.390 --> 05:16:22.400 align:start position:0%
inclined to just go forward with the
 
05:16:24.868 --> 05:16:24.878 align:start position:0%
bill as it is i want to see this done as
 
05:16:27.590 --> 05:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
soon as reasonably possible i i'm not
 
05:16:29.670 --> 05:16:29.680 align:start position:0%
the biggest fan of education freedom
 
05:16:31.430 --> 05:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
accounts but i want them
 
05:16:34.070 --> 05:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
i want i want them to either be shown to
 
05:16:36.310 --> 05:16:36.320 align:start position:0%
be effective or not and let's get this
 
05:16:38.948 --> 05:16:38.958 align:start position:0%
taken care of
 
05:16:41.750 --> 05:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
fellows thank you madam chair
 
05:16:41.760 --> 05:16:43.430 align:start position:0%
fellows thank you madam chair
um

05:16:43.430 --> 05:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:46.628 --> 05:16:46.638 align:start position:0%
i speak against this amendment
 
05:16:46.638 --> 05:16:48.708 align:start position:0%
i speak against this amendment
um

05:16:48.708 --> 05:16:48.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:50.230 --> 05:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
if we adopt
 
05:16:52.708 --> 05:16:52.718 align:start position:0%
one thing to to go over
 
05:16:57.030 --> 05:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:59.990 --> 05:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
will put the audit in the queue
 
05:17:01.190 --> 05:17:01.200 align:start position:0%
and will
 
05:17:03.350 --> 05:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
assuming it pass and it will mean that
 
05:17:05.270 --> 05:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
the audit will occur
 
05:17:08.550 --> 05:17:08.560 align:start position:0%
it does not specify when the audit will
 
05:17:10.150 --> 05:17:10.160 align:start position:0%
take place
 
05:17:13.590 --> 05:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:17.110 --> 05:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
the lba does not do is they would not do
 
05:17:18.708 --> 05:17:18.718 align:start position:0%
two audits
 
05:17:21.350 --> 05:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
at the same agency or at least for sure
 
05:17:23.190 --> 05:17:23.200 align:start position:0%
the department of education i'm not sure
 
05:17:25.590 --> 05:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
about hhs that's really big they would
 
05:17:28.390 --> 05:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
not do two audits of the department of
 
05:17:30.708 --> 05:17:30.718 align:start position:0%
education at the same time
 
05:17:33.430 --> 05:17:33.440 align:start position:0%
and they have one audit in the queue
 
05:17:36.868 --> 05:17:36.878 align:start position:0%
right now special ed which they
 
05:17:36.878 --> 05:17:37.750 align:start position:0%
right now special ed which they
may

05:17:37.750 --> 05:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
may
 
05:17:40.390 --> 05:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
um if they have started it they've only
 
05:17:42.550 --> 05:17:42.560 align:start position:0%
started it within just the last week or
 
05:17:42.560 --> 05:17:43.910 align:start position:0%
started it within just the last week or
two

05:17:43.910 --> 05:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
two
 
05:17:43.920 --> 05:17:44.708 align:start position:0%
two
so

05:17:44.708 --> 05:17:44.718 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:17:47.190 --> 05:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is it gets it in the
 
05:17:47.200 --> 05:17:48.628 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is it gets it in the
queue

05:17:48.628 --> 05:17:48.638 align:start position:0%
queue
 
05:17:51.270 --> 05:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:17:54.230 --> 05:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
if it gets in the queue now the earliest
 
05:17:56.550 --> 05:17:56.560 align:start position:0%
they would be able to start on it
 
05:17:58.948 --> 05:17:58.958 align:start position:0%
would be october
 
05:18:01.750 --> 05:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
and they wouldn't finish up with it
 
05:18:01.760 --> 05:18:03.030 align:start position:0%
and they wouldn't finish up with it
until

05:18:03.030 --> 05:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
until
 
05:18:05.190 --> 05:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
probably late spring
 
05:18:05.200 --> 05:18:06.550 align:start position:0%
probably late spring
of

05:18:06.550 --> 05:18:06.560 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:18:06.560 --> 05:18:08.628 align:start position:0%
of
2023

05:18:08.628 --> 05:18:08.638 align:start position:0%
2023
 
05:18:13.030 --> 05:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
and the process is fairly long because
 
05:18:17.110 --> 05:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
the audit is still open until they get
 
05:18:18.350 --> 05:18:18.360 align:start position:0%
through all their
 
05:18:21.270 --> 05:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
evaluations they write their report they
 
05:18:23.910 --> 05:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
go back to the agency and the agency has
 
05:18:25.990 --> 05:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to say
 
05:18:29.430 --> 05:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:31.830 --> 05:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
what you said here is incorrect you
 
05:18:33.830 --> 05:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
probably misunderstood the person you
 
05:18:35.190 --> 05:18:35.200 align:start position:0%
were talking to
 
05:18:37.990 --> 05:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
so the agency has
 
05:18:41.430 --> 05:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
time which could be weeks or maybe more
 
05:18:41.440 --> 05:18:42.390 align:start position:0%
time which could be weeks or maybe more
to

05:18:42.390 --> 05:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:18:45.270 --> 05:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
get those issues corrected and then the
 
05:18:47.830 --> 05:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
whole process is not finished
 
05:18:50.948 --> 05:18:50.958 align:start position:0%
until it's presented to fiscal and
 
05:18:53.990 --> 05:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal accepts the report
 
05:18:56.708 --> 05:18:56.718 align:start position:0%
so that's not going to happen until
 
05:18:56.718 --> 05:18:58.150 align:start position:0%
so that's not going to happen until
maybe

05:18:58.150 --> 05:18:58.160 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
05:18:58.160 --> 05:18:59.110 align:start position:0%
maybe
um

05:18:59.110 --> 05:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:01.590 --> 05:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
more than a year from now
 
05:19:03.590 --> 05:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
if and it's
 
05:19:03.600 --> 05:19:04.470 align:start position:0%
if and it's
uh

05:19:04.470 --> 05:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:19:04.480 --> 05:19:05.510 align:start position:0%
uh
unlike

05:19:05.510 --> 05:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
unlike
 
05:19:07.830 --> 05:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
the letter that we read is pretty much
 
05:19:10.628 --> 05:19:10.638 align:start position:0%
generic it doesn't talk about
 
05:19:13.030 --> 05:19:13.040 align:start position:0%
this specific audit
 
05:19:15.190 --> 05:19:15.200 align:start position:0%
one of the um
 
05:19:15.200 --> 05:19:16.470 align:start position:0%
one of the um
reasons

05:19:16.470 --> 05:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
05:19:18.788 --> 05:19:18.798 align:start position:0%
to do an audit is
 
05:19:21.990 --> 05:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
if there's a high potential of risk to
 
05:19:23.590 --> 05:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
the state
 
05:19:26.310 --> 05:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
and with education funding
 
05:19:29.990 --> 05:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
like adequacy aid in this program which
 
05:19:30.000 --> 05:19:31.350 align:start position:0%
like adequacy aid in this program which
is

05:19:31.350 --> 05:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:19:35.110 --> 05:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
sending a significant amount of money
 
05:19:36.070 --> 05:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
out to
 
05:19:36.080 --> 05:19:37.670 align:start position:0%
out to
parents

05:19:37.670 --> 05:19:37.680 align:start position:0%
parents
 
05:19:39.270 --> 05:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
by means of
 
05:19:41.670 --> 05:19:41.680 align:start position:0%
a contractor
 
05:19:43.750 --> 05:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
at to the department of education which
 
05:19:47.510 --> 05:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
is a very unusual situation that has
 
05:19:47.520 --> 05:19:48.550 align:start position:0%
is a very unusual situation that has
never

05:19:48.550 --> 05:19:48.560 align:start position:0%
never
 
05:19:50.310 --> 05:19:50.320 align:start position:0%
happened before
 
05:19:52.550 --> 05:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
that state money has gone
 
05:19:55.510 --> 05:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
to a contractor directly
 
05:19:58.628 --> 05:19:58.638 align:start position:0%
and there is high risk there's high risk
 
05:19:58.638 --> 05:20:02.390 align:start position:0%
and there is high risk there's high risk
for

05:20:02.390 --> 05:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:05.830 --> 05:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
ineligible people receiving money
 
05:20:05.840 --> 05:20:06.948 align:start position:0%
ineligible people receiving money
for

05:20:06.948 --> 05:20:06.958 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:20:10.310 --> 05:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
the money being spent
 
05:20:12.150 --> 05:20:12.160 align:start position:0%
on ineligible
 
05:20:12.160 --> 05:20:13.830 align:start position:0%
on ineligible
items

05:20:13.830 --> 05:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
items
 
05:20:15.110 --> 05:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
and so
 
05:20:17.110 --> 05:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
i think it's important
 
05:20:19.750 --> 05:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
to get this thing in the queue
 
05:20:22.150 --> 05:20:22.160 align:start position:0%
and it'll go to the
 
05:20:24.868 --> 05:20:24.878 align:start position:0%
audit review board first
 
05:20:26.948 --> 05:20:26.958 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily going to be the
 
05:20:29.270 --> 05:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
next audit that they will do
 
05:20:31.190 --> 05:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
but it gets it in the queue
 
05:20:34.708 --> 05:20:34.718 align:start position:0%
delayed delaying gets it in the queue
 
05:20:38.230 --> 05:20:38.240 align:start position:0%
pushes out when we will see the results
 
05:20:42.548 --> 05:20:42.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:47.510 --> 05:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:50.548 --> 05:20:50.558 align:start position:0%
if we adopt this amendment the earliest
 
05:20:53.430 --> 05:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
that the results could be
 
05:20:53.440 --> 05:20:54.788 align:start position:0%
that the results could be
approved

05:20:54.788 --> 05:20:54.798 align:start position:0%
approved
 
05:20:56.150 --> 05:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
by fiscal
 
05:20:57.430 --> 05:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
would be
 
05:20:58.948 --> 05:20:58.958 align:start position:0%
just before
 
05:20:58.958 --> 05:21:00.948 align:start position:0%
just before
um

05:21:00.948 --> 05:21:00.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:00.958 --> 05:21:01.830 align:start position:0%
um
we

05:21:01.830 --> 05:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
we
 
05:21:05.510 --> 05:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
will probably late spring of 2024 two
 
05:21:07.670 --> 05:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
years from now
 
05:21:07.680 --> 05:21:09.190 align:start position:0%
years from now
and

05:21:09.190 --> 05:21:09.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:21:11.830 --> 05:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
if the audit identifies
 
05:21:15.030 --> 05:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
changes that need to be made
 
05:21:15.040 --> 05:21:15.990 align:start position:0%
changes that need to be made
those

05:21:15.990 --> 05:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
those
 
05:21:19.670 --> 05:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
changes can't be made earlier than
 
05:21:19.680 --> 05:21:20.430 align:start position:0%
changes can't be made earlier than
the

05:21:20.430 --> 05:21:20.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:21:22.948 --> 05:21:22.958 align:start position:0%
24-25 school year
 
05:21:25.270 --> 05:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
which is the fourth year that the
 
05:21:27.750 --> 05:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
program will be in operation
 
05:21:30.310 --> 05:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
and sometimes audits recommend
 
05:21:33.510 --> 05:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
legislative changes that should be made
 
05:21:35.750 --> 05:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
because the agency can't do it unless
 
05:21:38.868 --> 05:21:38.878 align:start position:0%
they have the authority to do it
 
05:21:42.310 --> 05:21:42.320 align:start position:0%
then those changes couldn't occur
 
05:21:42.320 --> 05:21:43.590 align:start position:0%
then those changes couldn't occur
before

05:21:43.590 --> 05:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
before
 
05:21:45.670 --> 05:21:45.680 align:start position:0%
the 25-26
 
05:21:47.590 --> 05:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
school year
 
05:21:50.628 --> 05:21:50.638 align:start position:0%
so given how far that pushes it out
 
05:21:53.430 --> 05:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
i think it's much better to just
 
05:21:55.830 --> 05:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
use the bill without the amendment and
 
05:21:57.510 --> 05:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
get it in the queue
 
05:22:00.390 --> 05:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
because this with this pushes it out and
 
05:22:02.390 --> 05:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
makes us wait a very long time before we
 
05:22:05.030 --> 05:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
see the results
 
05:22:07.270 --> 05:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative pearson
 
05:22:09.030 --> 05:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um i'm going to go
 
05:22:10.868 --> 05:22:10.878 align:start position:0%
the other way
 
05:22:13.190 --> 05:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
on this one in the sense that when you
 
05:22:14.948 --> 05:22:14.958 align:start position:0%
have a program that's new
 
05:22:16.948 --> 05:22:16.958 align:start position:0%
and it's new to the state you're going
 
05:22:19.750 --> 05:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
to have a learning curve
 
05:22:21.430 --> 05:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
in the implementation of that program
 
05:22:22.548 --> 05:22:22.558 align:start position:0%
you're going to have adjustments that
 
05:22:24.230 --> 05:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
need to be made
 
05:22:28.390 --> 05:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
and to see if a program works after the
 
05:22:30.310 --> 05:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
initial settling is going to require
 
05:22:32.310 --> 05:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
probably two or three school years worth
 
05:22:34.070 --> 05:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
of data so
 
05:22:35.510 --> 05:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
to actually look at what it's really
 
05:22:37.430 --> 05:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
doing rather than looking at us at the
 
05:22:39.910 --> 05:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
first year of implementation and
 
05:22:42.470 --> 05:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
making that become the
 
05:22:44.470 --> 05:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
you know the defining
 
05:22:46.708 --> 05:22:46.718 align:start position:0%
study on whether this concept works or
 
05:22:48.788 --> 05:22:48.798 align:start position:0%
not so i'll i mean i'm down with the
 
05:22:51.190 --> 05:22:51.200 align:start position:0%
amendment but i'd even i'd even go one
 
05:22:54.070 --> 05:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
year farther personally so
 
05:22:55.750 --> 05:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative lekkis and then
 
05:22:55.760 --> 05:22:57.110 align:start position:0%
thank you representative lekkis and then
horrigan

05:22:57.110 --> 05:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
horrigan
 
05:22:59.350 --> 05:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
thank you um yeah as i said i wouldn't
 
05:23:01.990 --> 05:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
want it uh any earlier than that and a
 
05:23:04.310 --> 05:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
little further out i'd be fine with uh i
 
05:23:06.310 --> 05:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
thought this might be an acceptable
 
05:23:08.230 --> 05:23:08.240 align:start position:0%
compromise um
 
05:23:09.910 --> 05:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
i want to correct one thing and that is
 
05:23:11.510 --> 05:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
the money never the parents never have
 
05:23:13.990 --> 05:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
their hands on the money it is paid by
 
05:23:16.788 --> 05:23:16.798 align:start position:0%
the uh con there's a contractor i agree
 
05:23:18.548 --> 05:23:18.558 align:start position:0%
but it's paid by the contractor directly
 
05:23:20.230 --> 05:23:20.240 align:start position:0%
to the vendor so
 
05:23:22.230 --> 05:23:22.240 align:start position:0%
i mean i'm not saying things couldn't be
 
05:23:24.470 --> 05:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
handled incorrectly
 
05:23:26.788 --> 05:23:26.798 align:start position:0%
but i don't think the risk is as extreme
 
05:23:29.590 --> 05:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
as as some people may believe
 
05:23:32.070 --> 05:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
um and i really want to as i agree i
 
05:23:33.670 --> 05:23:33.680 align:start position:0%
want to have things settle down so at
 
05:23:35.750 --> 05:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
least you have a minimum of a good solid
 
05:23:37.110 --> 05:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
school year
 
05:23:39.110 --> 05:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
with the rules settled and two would
 
05:23:40.708 --> 05:23:40.718 align:start position:0%
actually be better
 
05:23:42.708 --> 05:23:42.718 align:start position:0%
um so there's more experience and things
 
05:23:44.070 --> 05:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
are running in kind of steady state and
 
05:23:46.070 --> 05:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
then we'll get a useful audit it's not
 
05:23:47.270 --> 05:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
like we're going to then do another
 
05:23:49.590 --> 05:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
audit on it if we do one early
 
05:23:51.270 --> 05:23:51.280 align:start position:0%
that's maybe a little iffy because
 
05:23:52.390 --> 05:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
things are changing we're not going to
 
05:23:54.628 --> 05:23:54.638 align:start position:0%
do one anytime soon on the same subject
 
05:23:54.638 --> 05:23:55.670 align:start position:0%
do one anytime soon on the same subject
so

05:23:55.670 --> 05:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:23:55.680 --> 05:23:56.948 align:start position:0%
so
representative

05:23:56.948 --> 05:23:56.958 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:23:58.628 --> 05:23:58.638 align:start position:0%
um yes i
 
05:24:00.230 --> 05:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
make it go on all day about this but
 
05:24:02.470 --> 05:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
this is a very oddly designed program i
 
05:24:03.830 --> 05:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
think probably
 
05:24:05.350 --> 05:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
it was past rather
 
05:24:07.510 --> 05:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
hastily but i'm not
 
05:24:07.520 --> 05:24:09.190 align:start position:0%
hastily but i'm not
yes

05:24:09.190 --> 05:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:24:10.470 --> 05:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
yes the uh
 
05:24:11.910 --> 05:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
if we do the
 
05:24:11.920 --> 05:24:13.270 align:start position:0%
if we do the
um

05:24:13.270 --> 05:24:13.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:15.590 --> 05:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
i think the uh timeline in the original
 
05:24:17.510 --> 05:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
bill as representative fellows explained
 
05:24:18.788 --> 05:24:18.798 align:start position:0%
is uh is
 
05:24:20.948 --> 05:24:20.958 align:start position:0%
plenty plenty long enough and so i think
 
05:24:20.958 --> 05:24:22.150 align:start position:0%
plenty plenty long enough and so i think
um

05:24:22.150 --> 05:24:22.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:23.510 --> 05:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
yeah there's obviously many many
 
05:24:25.590 --> 05:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
questions and i'm not even sure what the
 
05:24:28.628 --> 05:24:28.638 align:start position:0%
lba could do with the contractor so but
 
05:24:30.310 --> 05:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
and that which is
 
05:24:32.150 --> 05:24:32.160 align:start position:0%
where most of the det most of the
 
05:24:32.160 --> 05:24:33.190 align:start position:0%
where most of the det most of the
problems

05:24:33.190 --> 05:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
problems
 
05:24:36.150 --> 05:24:36.160 align:start position:0%
would be thank you so i would i would
 
05:24:38.310 --> 05:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
say the uh understand the concern behind
 
05:24:40.070 --> 05:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
the amendment i think the original bill
 
05:24:41.510 --> 05:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
is the way to go and it still takes a
 
05:24:43.910 --> 05:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
rather lengthy time to get the process
 
05:24:43.920 --> 05:24:45.350 align:start position:0%
rather lengthy time to get the process
complete

05:24:45.350 --> 05:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
complete
 
05:24:47.830 --> 05:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
i'd like to make a couple of comments
 
05:24:51.350 --> 05:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
first of all nearly a very large portion
 
05:24:53.750 --> 05:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
of our health and human services budget
 
05:24:56.390 --> 05:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
is administered through contractors
 
05:24:58.948 --> 05:24:58.958 align:start position:0%
it's not like we individually pay for
 
05:25:01.830 --> 05:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
everybody we we deal with a lot of sub
 
05:25:03.670 --> 05:25:03.680 align:start position:0%
of contractors in the health and human
 
05:25:06.628 --> 05:25:06.638 align:start position:0%
services so it is not unheard of that we
 
05:25:08.470 --> 05:25:08.480 align:start position:0%
have large programs run through
 
05:25:08.480 --> 05:25:09.910 align:start position:0%
have large programs run through
contractors

05:25:09.910 --> 05:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
contractors
 
05:25:13.190 --> 05:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
and secondly we gelcar just approved the
 
05:25:15.350 --> 05:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
rules for this program
 
05:25:16.548 --> 05:25:16.558 align:start position:0%
with the
 
05:25:18.310 --> 05:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
with the
 
05:25:21.510 --> 05:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
proviso that the department of education
 
05:25:23.750 --> 05:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
worked with the legislature to clear up
 
05:25:25.350 --> 05:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
some of the areas
 
05:25:26.990 --> 05:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
of con of
 
05:25:29.670 --> 05:25:29.680 align:start position:0%
self-contradiction or confusion so that
 
05:25:31.750 --> 05:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
we will probably see some legislative
 
05:25:34.548 --> 05:25:34.558 align:start position:0%
changes due to the detailing of the
 
05:25:34.558 --> 05:25:35.990 align:start position:0%
changes due to the detailing of the
rules

05:25:35.990 --> 05:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
rules
 
05:25:39.590 --> 05:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
there are also as i believe 17 bills to
 
05:25:42.310 --> 05:25:42.320 align:start position:0%
amend or affect this program in the
 
05:25:43.990 --> 05:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
education committee
 
05:25:46.788 --> 05:25:46.798 align:start position:0%
plus several in the senate so
 
05:25:49.590 --> 05:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult to do an audit when
 
05:25:53.110 --> 05:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
your baseline is in that much turmoil
 
05:25:55.190 --> 05:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
so that's why i'm supporting this
 
05:25:57.510 --> 05:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
amendment that we should do it after we
 
05:25:59.590 --> 05:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
know what the program is supposed to be
 
05:25:59.600 --> 05:26:00.390 align:start position:0%
know what the program is supposed to be
doing

05:26:00.390 --> 05:26:00.400 align:start position:0%
doing
 
05:26:02.948 --> 05:26:02.958 align:start position:0%
representative allegro
 
05:26:05.110 --> 05:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
i would like to make two points first is
 
05:26:05.120 --> 05:26:06.470 align:start position:0%
i would like to make two points first is
that

05:26:06.470 --> 05:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:26:08.470 --> 05:26:08.480 align:start position:0%
with this amendment the bill is in the
 
05:26:08.480 --> 05:26:09.670 align:start position:0%
with this amendment the bill is in the
queue

05:26:09.670 --> 05:26:09.680 align:start position:0%
queue
 
05:26:11.350 --> 05:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
that doesn't change anything it just
 
05:26:13.110 --> 05:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
puts it back in my mistaken did you say
 
05:26:14.948 --> 05:26:14.958 align:start position:0%
one year
 
05:26:16.788 --> 05:26:16.798 align:start position:0%
which is nothing
 
05:26:19.030 --> 05:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
and secondly when you're trying to
 
05:26:21.110 --> 05:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
perform a study or an audit
 
05:26:23.030 --> 05:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
on how a program is working you don't
 
05:26:24.868 --> 05:26:24.878 align:start position:0%
want to contaminate that with how the
 
05:26:27.030 --> 05:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
program has started up
 
05:26:28.628 --> 05:26:28.638 align:start position:0%
so again
 
05:26:31.910 --> 05:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh in support of uh representative lexus
 
05:26:31.920 --> 05:26:33.270 align:start position:0%
uh in support of uh representative lexus
amendment

05:26:33.270 --> 05:26:33.280 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:26:36.470 --> 05:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
pushing it back a year is a minimum if
 
05:26:38.070 --> 05:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
we want to study how the program is
 
05:26:38.080 --> 05:26:39.110 align:start position:0%
we want to study how the program is
running

05:26:39.110 --> 05:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
running
 
05:26:42.390 --> 05:26:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:42.400 --> 05:26:43.430 align:start position:0%
 
fellows

05:26:43.430 --> 05:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
fellows
 
05:26:46.310 --> 05:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
thank you um i'd like to respond to one
 
05:26:47.670 --> 05:26:47.680 align:start position:0%
of the things that
 
05:26:49.910 --> 05:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
representative pearson said
 
05:26:53.670 --> 05:26:53.680 align:start position:0%
that in many cases the audit of a pro of
 
05:26:55.030 --> 05:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
a program
 
05:26:57.590 --> 05:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
has to do with how effective the program
 
05:26:59.990 --> 05:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
is so if you were trying to
 
05:27:02.948 --> 05:27:02.958 align:start position:0%
you know reduce substance abuse or
 
05:27:06.070 --> 05:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
you know have fewer homeless people
 
05:27:07.990 --> 05:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
that makes sense
 
05:27:08.000 --> 05:27:08.868 align:start position:0%
that makes sense
this

05:27:08.868 --> 05:27:08.878 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:27:13.190 --> 05:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
program does not have any outcomes in
 
05:27:16.548 --> 05:27:16.558 align:start position:0%
terms of educational performance
 
05:27:16.558 --> 05:27:17.830 align:start position:0%
terms of educational performance
involved

05:27:17.830 --> 05:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
involved
 
05:27:17.840 --> 05:27:18.708 align:start position:0%
involved
the

05:27:18.708 --> 05:27:18.718 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:27:21.830 --> 05:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
audit focuses on the fact of whether or
 
05:27:21.840 --> 05:27:23.110 align:start position:0%
audit focuses on the fact of whether or
not

05:27:23.110 --> 05:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:27:26.628 --> 05:27:26.638 align:start position:0%
the money state money is being handled
 
05:27:26.638 --> 05:27:28.070 align:start position:0%
the money state money is being handled
properly

05:27:28.070 --> 05:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
properly
 
05:27:31.350 --> 05:27:31.360 align:start position:0%
and if the money is being
 
05:27:34.150 --> 05:27:34.160 align:start position:0%
put in the hands or have
 
05:27:37.030 --> 05:27:37.040 align:start position:0%
if the money is being expended
 
05:27:39.990 --> 05:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
based on what parents want to spend it
 
05:27:40.000 --> 05:27:41.350 align:start position:0%
based on what parents want to spend it
on

05:27:41.350 --> 05:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:27:44.390 --> 05:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
and if those if those parents are elig
 
05:27:46.708 --> 05:27:46.718 align:start position:0%
it looks are they eligible or not are
 
05:27:50.390 --> 05:27:50.400 align:start position:0%
the expenditures eligible or not is the
 
05:27:54.230 --> 05:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
money being accounted for properly
 
05:27:56.788 --> 05:27:56.798 align:start position:0%
so there is a great deal of risk
 
05:27:58.548 --> 05:27:58.558 align:start position:0%
involved with this
 
05:28:00.948 --> 05:28:00.958 align:start position:0%
because if money is being paid out to
 
05:28:03.270 --> 05:28:03.280 align:start position:0%
people who are not entitled to that
 
05:28:03.280 --> 05:28:04.628 align:start position:0%
people who are not entitled to that
money

05:28:04.628 --> 05:28:04.638 align:start position:0%
money
 
05:28:06.948 --> 05:28:06.958 align:start position:0%
after three years do you think you're
 
05:28:08.708 --> 05:28:08.718 align:start position:0%
going to be able to get that money back
 
05:28:11.030 --> 05:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
from them
 
05:28:14.788 --> 05:28:14.798 align:start position:0%
so that's that's the reason for
 
05:28:17.990 --> 05:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
the urgency to get it done as quickly as
 
05:28:20.310 --> 05:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
possible and in quickly as possible is
 
05:28:21.990 --> 05:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
still talking about like you know more
 
05:28:26.470 --> 05:28:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:27.990 --> 05:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative pearson i'd
 
05:28:29.750 --> 05:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
just like to focus on line four line
 
05:28:31.430 --> 05:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
four says the audit shall include but is
 
05:28:33.990 --> 05:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
not limited to this audit as far as its
 
05:28:34.000 --> 05:28:36.470 align:start position:0%
not limited to this audit as far as its
scope

05:28:36.470 --> 05:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:38.948 --> 05:28:38.958 align:start position:0%
is going to most likely
 
05:28:41.110 --> 05:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
wiggle a little bit based on
 
05:28:43.910 --> 05:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
if we have 17 bills in the house alone
 
05:28:46.708 --> 05:28:46.718 align:start position:0%
on putting parameters in when they go to
 
05:28:49.030 --> 05:28:49.040 align:start position:0%
audit this program if the if there are
 
05:28:52.070 --> 05:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
additional parameters involved
 
05:28:53.750 --> 05:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
the auditors are not going to just turn
 
05:28:55.030 --> 05:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
a blind eye to this they're going to
 
05:28:57.270 --> 05:28:57.280 align:start position:0%
look at whatever whatever wiggling has
 
05:29:00.548 --> 05:29:00.558 align:start position:0%
been done here so it's not specifically
 
05:29:03.830 --> 05:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
tied only to a through g well actually
 
05:29:06.230 --> 05:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
it since we just went through the rules
 
05:29:08.470 --> 05:29:08.480 align:start position:0%
at great length we said that the
 
05:29:10.948 --> 05:29:10.958 align:start position:0%
allowable expenses
 
05:29:10.958 --> 05:29:11.750 align:start position:0%
allowable expenses
are

05:29:11.750 --> 05:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:29:13.910 --> 05:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
a through n
 
05:29:17.030 --> 05:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
and then o is other so
 
05:29:18.868 --> 05:29:18.878 align:start position:0%
i mean there are a lot of different
 
05:29:20.390 --> 05:29:20.400 align:start position:0%
things that could be covered as
 
05:29:23.750 --> 05:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
allowable expenses it's the end and
 
05:29:27.510 --> 05:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:30.390 --> 05:29:30.400 align:start position:0%
and that would need to be verified
 
05:29:32.628 --> 05:29:32.638 align:start position:0%
whether they're approved
 
05:29:32.638 --> 05:29:33.990 align:start position:0%
whether they're approved
represent

05:29:33.990 --> 05:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
represent
 
05:29:36.150 --> 05:29:36.160 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
05:29:38.708 --> 05:29:38.718 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair in terms of wiggle
 
05:29:38.718 --> 05:29:41.270 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair in terms of wiggle
room

05:29:41.270 --> 05:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:41.280 --> 05:29:42.548 align:start position:0%
 
these

05:29:42.548 --> 05:29:42.558 align:start position:0%
these
 
05:29:44.628 --> 05:29:44.638 align:start position:0%
this bill identifies things that need to
 
05:29:47.190 --> 05:29:47.200 align:start position:0%
be covered but it also goes to the audit
 
05:29:49.830 --> 05:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
review board and and they can wiggle and
 
05:29:52.470 --> 05:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
they can put additional things in it
 
05:29:55.350 --> 05:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
and the auditors are going to use
 
05:29:57.430 --> 05:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
whatever statutes
 
05:29:59.670 --> 05:29:59.680 align:start position:0%
exist at the time that they're doing the
 
05:30:02.390 --> 05:30:02.400 align:start position:0%
audit so we know for sure
 
05:30:04.708 --> 05:30:04.718 align:start position:0%
they're not going to start that audit
 
05:30:06.868 --> 05:30:06.878 align:start position:0%
earlier than october of this year which
 
05:30:09.430 --> 05:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
is after we pass our bills for this term
 
05:30:11.590 --> 05:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
and it it you know it could be like
 
05:30:14.310 --> 05:30:14.320 align:start position:0%
another six eight months out i mean it
 
05:30:16.310 --> 05:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
might not even be in
 
05:30:17.430 --> 05:30:17.440 align:start position:0%
in uh
 
05:30:20.230 --> 05:30:20.240 align:start position:0%
they it won't be finished before
 
05:30:23.750 --> 05:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
2003 and it may be 2004
 
05:30:26.470 --> 05:30:26.480 align:start position:0%
if we get it in the queue now if we
 
05:30:28.470 --> 05:30:28.480 align:start position:0%
don't get it in the queue now there
 
05:30:31.030 --> 05:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
could be another education bill that
 
05:30:32.868 --> 05:30:32.878 align:start position:0%
comes in and
 
05:30:34.948 --> 05:30:34.958 align:start position:0%
you know gets presented and
 
05:30:37.110 --> 05:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
puts in the cube before it
 
05:30:39.110 --> 05:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative elect
 
05:30:41.350 --> 05:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
uh thank you yeah um
 
05:30:44.548 --> 05:30:44.558 align:start position:0%
starting it in october
 
05:30:46.390 --> 05:30:46.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't necessarily make sense even i
 
05:30:49.030 --> 05:30:49.040 align:start position:0%
mean the issue is the auditor testified
 
05:30:50.628 --> 05:30:50.638 align:start position:0%
the person who testified said they'd
 
05:30:53.590 --> 05:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
like to have a full fiscal year
 
05:30:56.150 --> 05:30:56.160 align:start position:0%
with the rules set and
 
05:30:57.830 --> 05:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
that's not going to start
 
05:30:59.670 --> 05:30:59.680 align:start position:0%
this you know the fiscal year that's
 
05:31:01.030 --> 05:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
going to include that's going to be any
 
05:31:03.430 --> 05:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
part of this year
 
05:31:06.628 --> 05:31:06.638 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be until after june
 
05:31:09.110 --> 05:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
of 2023 and that's why i thought the
 
05:31:10.470 --> 05:31:10.480 align:start position:0%
date uh
 
05:31:10.480 --> 05:31:11.590 align:start position:0%
date uh
anyway

05:31:11.590 --> 05:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
anyway

05:32:27.590 --> 05:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:32:30.628 --> 05:32:30.638 align:start position:0%
student enrollment data because the

05:32:44.150 --> 05:32:44.160 align:start position:0%
two years of student data
 
05:32:46.070 --> 05:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
and in the pro the other issues their
 
05:32:46.080 --> 05:32:51.110 align:start position:0%
and in the pro the other issues their
process

05:32:51.110 --> 05:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:53.030 --> 05:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
representative laccas uh yeah just
 
05:32:54.310 --> 05:32:54.320 align:start position:0%
briefly and
 
05:32:56.470 --> 05:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
the program did start
 
05:32:58.548 --> 05:32:58.558 align:start position:0%
you know uh the end of last summer more
 
05:33:00.150 --> 05:33:00.160 align:start position:0%
or less but
 
05:33:02.390 --> 05:33:02.400 align:start position:0%
certainly not with stable rules which
 
05:33:04.470 --> 05:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
has only occurred very recently
 
05:33:05.670 --> 05:33:05.680 align:start position:0%
the the
 
05:33:07.350 --> 05:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
there were significant differences
 
05:33:09.350 --> 05:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
between the interim rules they started
 
05:33:11.750 --> 05:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
the school year with and the final rules
 
05:33:17.270 --> 05:33:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:19.670 --> 05:33:19.680 align:start position:0%
we've beat this dead horse
 
05:33:22.948 --> 05:33:22.958 align:start position:0%
any further comments or questions
 
05:33:25.350 --> 05:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
representative scitec this audit has
 
05:33:27.270 --> 05:33:27.280 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with the effectiveness of
 
05:33:29.750 --> 05:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
the program this is about where
 
05:33:31.510 --> 05:33:31.520 align:start position:0%
where the without doing a financial
 
05:33:33.270 --> 05:33:33.280 align:start position:0%
audit is where the money is going is
 
05:33:35.990 --> 05:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:38.230 --> 05:33:38.240 align:start position:0%
i believe that if you look at what the
 
05:33:40.548 --> 05:33:40.558 align:start position:0%
bill specifies the audit to look at the
 
05:33:42.868 --> 05:33:42.878 align:start position:0%
month where the money goes is one one of
 
05:33:44.708 --> 05:33:44.718 align:start position:0%
the major items and then checking the
 
05:33:46.788 --> 05:33:46.798 align:start position:0%
eligibility of the students and
 
05:33:46.798 --> 05:33:49.110 align:start position:0%

state policy
 
05:36:53.430 --> 05:36:53.440 align:start position:0%

with all the study committees it just
 
05:36:57.990 --> 05:36:58.000 align:start position:0%

yes representative o'brien
 
05:38:13.350 --> 05:38:13.360 align:start position:0%
yes and the chair
 
05:38:15.590 --> 05:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
yes that is 19-0
 
05:38:18.788 --> 05:38:18.798 align:start position:0%
okay the motion passes 19-0
 
05:38:20.390 --> 05:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
without objection we'll put it on
 
05:38:20.400 --> 05:38:24.390 align:start position:0%
without objection we'll put it on
consent

05:38:24.390 --> 05:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:25.990 --> 05:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
representative bailey you have a motion
 
05:38:29.430 --> 05:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
on house bill 1312 yes thank you
 
05:38:32.310 --> 05:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
i'd like to move interim study on
 
05:38:35.110 --> 05:38:35.120 align:start position:0%
house bill 1312.
 
05:38:35.120 --> 05:38:37.590 align:start position:0%
house bill 1312.
second

05:38:37.590 --> 05:38:37.600 align:start position:0%
second
 
05:38:37.600 --> 05:38:39.110 align:start position:0%
second
bye

05:38:39.110 --> 05:38:39.120 align:start position:0%
bye
 
05:38:40.708 --> 05:38:40.718 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you
 
05:38:41.910 --> 05:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
do we should speak to your motion
 
05:38:43.350 --> 05:38:43.360 align:start position:0%
representative bailey
 
05:38:43.360 --> 05:38:44.470 align:start position:0%
representative bailey
yes

05:38:44.470 --> 05:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:38:46.230 --> 05:38:46.240 align:start position:0%
this is the one that was kind of
 
05:38:49.270 --> 05:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
perplexing in that they had zero
 
05:38:51.270 --> 05:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
grease input and
 
05:38:54.868 --> 05:38:54.878 align:start position:0%
10 000 gallon tank for that zero input
 
05:38:54.878 --> 05:38:56.310 align:start position:0%
10 000 gallon tank for that zero input
and

05:38:56.310 --> 05:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:38:58.948 --> 05:38:58.958 align:start position:0%
i think that this bill is intended to
 
05:39:02.230 --> 05:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
cut it back to uh
 
05:39:04.948 --> 05:39:04.958 align:start position:0%
just to an international standard
 
05:39:07.910 --> 05:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
but it didn't seem
 
05:39:10.310 --> 05:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
it didn't seem like this didn't have any
 
05:39:12.868 --> 05:39:12.878 align:start position:0%
gradations in a sense that you couldn't
 
05:39:15.110 --> 05:39:15.120 align:start position:0%
have a 10 gallon grease tank or you know
 
05:39:17.510 --> 05:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
it's like it was either all or nothing
 
05:39:19.830 --> 05:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
so this maybe needs somebody to take a
 
05:39:22.230 --> 05:39:22.240 align:start position:0%
look at it in more detail
 
05:39:24.230 --> 05:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
representative goalie
 
05:39:26.548 --> 05:39:26.558 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and i too agree
 
05:39:28.150 --> 05:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
with everything representative bailey
 
05:39:29.830 --> 05:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
said it
 
05:39:29.840 --> 05:39:31.510 align:start position:0%
said it
was

05:39:31.510 --> 05:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:39:33.190 --> 05:39:33.200 align:start position:0%
hard to
 
05:39:35.350 --> 05:39:35.360 align:start position:0%
follow what happened there
 
05:39:38.470 --> 05:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
because it sounded like
 
05:39:40.390 --> 05:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
they either had to put in this thousand
 
05:39:41.990 --> 05:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
gallon tank or they would not be
 
05:39:42.000 --> 05:39:43.750 align:start position:0%
gallon tank or they would not be
permitted

05:39:43.750 --> 05:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
permitted
 
05:39:44.788 --> 05:39:44.798 align:start position:0%
but yet
 
05:39:47.510 --> 05:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
at the end of the public hearing
 
05:39:49.910 --> 05:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
you had des looking over to those folks
 
05:39:51.750 --> 05:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
saying well we're willing to work with
 
05:39:51.760 --> 05:39:53.430 align:start position:0%
saying well we're willing to work with
you

05:39:53.430 --> 05:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:39:54.788 --> 05:39:54.798 align:start position:0%
and that bothered me because that was
 
05:39:56.310 --> 05:39:56.320 align:start position:0%
after the fact that they spent the money
 
05:39:58.150 --> 05:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
and put this in for him to turn around
 
05:40:00.628 --> 05:40:00.638 align:start position:0%
and say that to these individuals
 
05:40:02.708 --> 05:40:02.718 align:start position:0%
and the other thing that bothered me was
 
05:40:05.190 --> 05:40:05.200 align:start position:0%
listening to the hearing was that
 
05:40:06.708 --> 05:40:06.718 align:start position:0%
when they go into a business that they
 
05:40:09.590 --> 05:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
assume 100 percent of the grease being
 
05:40:11.430 --> 05:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
used in the facility is going down the
 
05:40:13.270 --> 05:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
drain and we all know that doesn't
 
05:40:15.510 --> 05:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
happen you have to have a cutoff point
 
05:40:16.708 --> 05:40:16.718 align:start position:0%
it's not all going down the drain
 
05:40:18.470 --> 05:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
because it would cost you more to clean
 
05:40:21.510 --> 05:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
out your pipes than it would to empty
 
05:40:23.030 --> 05:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
that grease trap
 
05:40:25.430 --> 05:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
and the final thing they got me was
 
05:40:26.628 --> 05:40:26.638 align:start position:0%
when the department said they were
 
05:40:28.868 --> 05:40:28.878 align:start position:0%
looking after the best interests of the
 
05:40:31.670 --> 05:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
owners by giving them a bigger grease
 
05:40:33.110 --> 05:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
trap so that they wouldn't have to spend
 
05:40:34.470 --> 05:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
the money to have it emptied out as
 
05:40:36.868 --> 05:40:36.878 align:start position:0%
often that's a business decision not
 
05:40:38.390 --> 05:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
their decision
 
05:40:40.390 --> 05:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
so for those three reasons i
 
05:40:41.750 --> 05:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
support the interim study so we can look
 
05:40:44.390 --> 05:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
further into this yes thank you
 
05:40:46.948 --> 05:40:46.958 align:start position:0%
i i would like to comment that yes it is
 
05:40:48.708 --> 05:40:48.718 align:start position:0%
a business decision when you clean out
 
05:40:50.548 --> 05:40:50.558 align:start position:0%
your grease straps
 
05:40:50.558 --> 05:40:51.670 align:start position:0%
your grease straps
and

05:40:51.670 --> 05:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:40:54.310 --> 05:40:54.320 align:start position:0%
what concerned me about this
 
05:40:57.270 --> 05:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
was that des as you said said well we'll
 
05:40:59.670 --> 05:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
work with you but their rules have
 
05:41:02.310 --> 05:41:02.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely no question of
 
05:41:05.510 --> 05:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
alternatives or operational workarounds
 
05:41:08.310 --> 05:41:08.320 align:start position:0%
or even asking for a waiver
 
05:41:10.230 --> 05:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
and so i'm very concerned that their
 
05:41:12.628 --> 05:41:12.638 align:start position:0%
rules are written in a
 
05:41:16.390 --> 05:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
crude one-size-fits-all manner that
 
05:41:18.788 --> 05:41:18.798 align:start position:0%
entraps small businesses
 
05:41:21.910 --> 05:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
and then the building control board
 
05:41:23.750 --> 05:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
building code review board came in and
 
05:41:25.350 --> 05:41:25.360 align:start position:0%
said well this isn't the way we should
 
05:41:26.310 --> 05:41:26.320 align:start position:0%
deal with
 
05:41:28.150 --> 05:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
building code issues they have to get
 
05:41:31.030 --> 05:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
involved so i think the
 
05:41:31.040 --> 05:41:35.270 align:start position:0%
involved so i think the
entire

05:41:35.270 --> 05:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:37.990 --> 05:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
entire issue of these grease traps is
 
05:41:40.230 --> 05:41:40.240 align:start position:0%
not just with des there's other people
 
05:41:42.788 --> 05:41:42.798 align:start position:0%
involved and we should be looking at it
 
05:41:44.470 --> 05:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
when we do the study
 
05:41:46.310 --> 05:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
05:41:46.320 --> 05:41:47.110 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
yes

05:41:47.110 --> 05:41:47.120 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:41:49.590 --> 05:41:49.600 align:start position:0%
one of the things i recall is it sounded
 
05:41:52.628 --> 05:41:52.638 align:start position:0%
to me as if it was a visit from
 
05:41:56.868 --> 05:41:56.878 align:start position:0%
hhs inspecting the food establishment
 
05:41:58.628 --> 05:41:58.638 align:start position:0%
that triggered the whole thing because
 
05:42:00.948 --> 05:42:00.958 align:start position:0%
it from the testimony we heard it
 
05:42:02.470 --> 05:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
sounded like
 
05:42:06.708 --> 05:42:06.718 align:start position:0%
the hhs person was the person who said
 
05:42:08.868 --> 05:42:08.878 align:start position:0%
you need to you know
 
05:42:08.878 --> 05:42:10.070 align:start position:0%
you need to you know
address

05:42:10.070 --> 05:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
address
 
05:42:12.548 --> 05:42:12.558 align:start position:0%
the grease traps situation
 
05:42:14.708 --> 05:42:14.718 align:start position:0%
so we have multiple agencies that we
 
05:42:16.230 --> 05:42:16.240 align:start position:0%
need to hear from
 
05:42:18.708 --> 05:42:18.718 align:start position:0%
okay representative pearson we're also
 
05:42:21.590 --> 05:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
in a situation of of
 
05:42:25.510 --> 05:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
the a change in in both technology and
 
05:42:25.520 --> 05:42:26.708 align:start position:0%
the a change in in both technology and
in

05:42:26.708 --> 05:42:26.718 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:42:28.070 --> 05:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
the value of
 
05:42:30.470 --> 05:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
greece some of these rules go back quite
 
05:42:33.190 --> 05:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
a ways where greece was was a more of a
 
05:42:34.628 --> 05:42:34.638 align:start position:0%
pain in the butt than anything else and
 
05:42:36.868 --> 05:42:36.878 align:start position:0%
now it's a it's something you sell
 
05:42:36.878 --> 05:42:37.830 align:start position:0%
now it's a it's something you sell
so

05:42:37.830 --> 05:42:37.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:42:39.750 --> 05:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
i think that we've not kept up with the
 
05:42:42.150 --> 05:42:42.160 align:start position:0%
times in reference to what folks really
 
05:42:43.990 --> 05:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
truly do with greece and for a new
 
05:42:45.750 --> 05:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
establishment the machines that use the
 
05:42:48.070 --> 05:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
grease now keeping in mind that it has
 
05:42:51.990 --> 05:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
value also are more apt to retain it
 
05:42:53.990 --> 05:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
than they are just to get rid of it so
 
05:42:55.110 --> 05:42:55.120 align:start position:0%
this is
 
05:42:57.110 --> 05:42:57.120 align:start position:0%
i think this is a case of where we were
 
05:42:59.510 --> 05:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
just not caught up with the times
 
05:43:02.230 --> 05:43:02.240 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative um yep
 
05:43:04.310 --> 05:43:04.320 align:start position:0%
this represent pearson athlete pointed
 
05:43:06.628 --> 05:43:06.638 align:start position:0%
out um we can recycle
 
05:43:08.230 --> 05:43:08.240 align:start position:0%
greece and in fact i think there's a
 
05:43:10.788 --> 05:43:10.798 align:start position:0%
criminal case going on right now
 
05:43:12.788 --> 05:43:12.798 align:start position:0%
where somebody is being prosecuted for
 
05:43:14.708 --> 05:43:14.718 align:start position:0%
stealing greece from a well-known local
 
05:43:16.708 --> 05:43:16.718 align:start position:0%
restaurant's grease traps so
 
05:43:18.230 --> 05:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
you probably want as big a grease trap
 
05:43:20.628 --> 05:43:20.638 align:start position:0%
as you can get if the stuff is saleable
 
05:43:21.910 --> 05:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
and also
 
05:43:23.350 --> 05:43:23.360 align:start position:0%
the way the bill's written it referred
 
05:43:25.030 --> 05:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
to a section of plumbing code and i
 
05:43:26.230 --> 05:43:26.240 align:start position:0%
looked it up and
 
05:43:27.670 --> 05:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
i know nothing about plumbing i didn't
 
05:43:28.948 --> 05:43:28.958 align:start position:0%
understand it but it seemed to deal with
 
05:43:30.548 --> 05:43:30.558 align:start position:0%
a lot of issues other than the grease
 
05:43:32.788 --> 05:43:32.798 align:start position:0%
traps per se so
 
05:43:32.798 --> 05:43:34.310 align:start position:0%
traps per se so
yeah

05:43:34.310 --> 05:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:43:37.110 --> 05:43:37.120 align:start position:0%
okay other comments questions
 
05:43:37.120 --> 05:43:38.628 align:start position:0%
okay other comments questions
issues

05:43:38.628 --> 05:43:38.638 align:start position:0%
issues
 
05:43:39.830 --> 05:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:43:42.230 --> 05:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
seeing none the motion is interim study
 
05:43:45.190 --> 05:43:45.200 align:start position:0%
on house bill 1312
 
05:43:49.990 --> 05:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:51.590 --> 05:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
representative rhodes
 
05:43:51.600 --> 05:43:52.708 align:start position:0%
representative rhodes
yes

05:43:52.708 --> 05:43:52.718 align:start position:0%
yes

represent bailey's seconds okay

speak to your motion yes thank you we've
 
05:45:17.510 --> 05:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
every one of us in this room have uh
 
05:45:19.350 --> 05:45:19.360 align:start position:0%
had to deal at one level or another with
 
05:45:20.868 --> 05:45:20.878 align:start position:0%
fine print
 
05:45:23.590 --> 05:45:23.600 align:start position:0%
in all sorts of uh
 
05:45:23.600 --> 05:45:24.948 align:start position:0%
in all sorts of uh
things

05:45:24.948 --> 05:45:24.958 align:start position:0%
things
 
05:45:28.230 --> 05:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
and this bill actually is a really good
 
05:45:30.628 --> 05:45:30.638 align:start position:0%
solution to a fine print problem that
 
05:45:32.708 --> 05:45:32.718 align:start position:0%
could be very costly
 
05:45:36.150 --> 05:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
so the the item was that um
 
05:45:39.350 --> 05:45:39.360 align:start position:0%
in listing contracts for real estate
 
05:45:41.990 --> 05:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
in the fine print there can be language
 
05:45:44.150 --> 05:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
that indicates that
 
05:45:46.708 --> 05:45:46.718 align:start position:0%
the listing agent
 
05:45:48.948 --> 05:45:48.958 align:start position:0%
can actually make the sale
 
05:45:50.948 --> 05:45:50.958 align:start position:0%
without getting back to in other words
 
05:45:53.030 --> 05:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
without sanction from the
 
05:45:55.350 --> 05:45:55.360 align:start position:0%
listing owner from the owner of the
 
05:45:55.360 --> 05:45:56.788 align:start position:0%
listing owner from the owner of the
property

05:45:56.788 --> 05:45:56.798 align:start position:0%
property
 
05:45:58.788 --> 05:45:58.798 align:start position:0%
so people can sign
 
05:46:00.948 --> 05:46:00.958 align:start position:0%
a listing contract not thinking that
 
05:46:02.948 --> 05:46:02.958 align:start position:0%
anything like this was in it
 
05:46:05.350 --> 05:46:05.360 align:start position:0%
and then they're surprised by a sale
 
05:46:07.590 --> 05:46:07.600 align:start position:0%
that they had no idea was coming
 
05:46:09.990 --> 05:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
this bill simply says that
 
05:46:10.000 --> 05:46:10.708 align:start position:0%
this bill simply says that
uh

05:46:10.708 --> 05:46:10.718 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:46:13.270 --> 05:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
the agent has to be proactive in
 
05:46:13.280 --> 05:46:14.390 align:start position:0%
the agent has to be proactive in
obtaining

05:46:14.390 --> 05:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
obtaining
 
05:46:16.470 --> 05:46:16.480 align:start position:0%
uh power of attorney
 
05:46:19.030 --> 05:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
from the uh from the owner so the owner
 
05:46:21.510 --> 05:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
knows what actually happened
 
05:46:23.350 --> 05:46:23.360 align:start position:0%
and knows that they're giving power of
 
05:46:25.990 --> 05:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
attorney legal power of attorney under
 
05:46:28.310 --> 05:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's laws to this listing
 
05:46:28.320 --> 05:46:29.190 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's laws to this listing
agent

05:46:29.190 --> 05:46:29.200 align:start position:0%
agent
 
05:46:31.430 --> 05:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
and so i i think it's a really good bill
 
05:46:33.830 --> 05:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
and it ought to pass and
 
05:46:35.910 --> 05:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
if we're concerned with protecting
 
05:46:35.920 --> 05:46:37.350 align:start position:0%
if we're concerned with protecting
consumers

05:46:37.350 --> 05:46:37.360 align:start position:0%
consumers
 
05:46:39.510 --> 05:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
this is a simple one thank you
 
05:46:40.948 --> 05:46:40.958 align:start position:0%
rosanna bailey do you wish to speak to
 
05:46:42.390 --> 05:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
your second
 
05:46:45.030 --> 05:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
he said it all thank you hey thank you
 
05:46:47.830 --> 05:46:47.840 align:start position:0%
are there is there any other comments
 
05:46:51.750 --> 05:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:51.760 --> 05:46:52.708 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:46:52.708 --> 05:46:52.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:46:54.708 --> 05:46:54.718 align:start position:0%
i don't think that the bill is necessary
 
05:46:56.470 --> 05:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
because in new hampshire
 
05:46:58.788 --> 05:46:58.798 align:start position:0%
in order to sign a purchase and sales
 
05:47:03.350 --> 05:47:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:04.948 --> 05:47:04.958 align:start position:0%
the real estate broker would have to
 
05:47:07.190 --> 05:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
have a legal power of attorney
 
05:47:07.200 --> 05:47:09.990 align:start position:0%
have a legal power of attorney
so

05:47:09.990 --> 05:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:11.590 --> 05:47:11.600 align:start position:0%
i don't believe it can be inserted into
 
05:47:14.788 --> 05:47:14.798 align:start position:0%
a listing contract
 
05:47:17.910 --> 05:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:20.628 --> 05:47:20.638 align:start position:0%
okay that is a good point any other
 
05:47:23.350 --> 05:47:23.360 align:start position:0%
comments questions issues anybody
 
05:47:25.350 --> 05:47:25.360 align:start position:0%
represented fellows i just i don't
 
05:47:28.628 --> 05:47:28.638 align:start position:0%
recall did anybody ever tell us that
 
05:47:30.548 --> 05:47:30.558 align:start position:0%
they there was that they knew of a
 
05:47:30.558 --> 05:47:31.830 align:start position:0%
they there was that they knew of a
specific

05:47:31.830 --> 05:47:31.840 align:start position:0%
specific
 
05:47:34.548 --> 05:47:34.558 align:start position:0%
situation where this actually happened
 
05:47:36.868 --> 05:47:36.878 align:start position:0%
because it seems like it might be just
 
05:47:37.750 --> 05:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:47:39.670 --> 05:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
trying to fix a problem that's never
 
05:47:39.680 --> 05:47:41.430 align:start position:0%
trying to fix a problem that's never
existed

05:47:41.430 --> 05:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
existed
 
05:47:43.990 --> 05:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
i believe there were comments but they
 
05:47:45.510 --> 05:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
weren't in new hampshire representative
 
05:47:45.520 --> 05:47:46.628 align:start position:0%
weren't in new hampshire representative
lackas

05:47:46.628 --> 05:47:46.638 align:start position:0%
lackas
 
05:47:49.430 --> 05:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
yeah i and again i don't have notes and
 
05:47:51.190 --> 05:47:51.200 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm trying to dredge my memory but i
 
05:47:53.190 --> 05:47:53.200 align:start position:0%
believe represented silver mentioned
 
05:47:55.590 --> 05:47:55.600 align:start position:0%
that at least there were
 
05:47:57.270 --> 05:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
listing contracts that actually had that
 
05:47:59.590 --> 05:47:59.600 align:start position:0%
language in it but i'm not a hundred
 
05:48:01.750 --> 05:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
percent certain thank you
 
05:48:04.788 --> 05:48:04.798 align:start position:0%
representative allegro then
 
05:48:07.670 --> 05:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
yes to second representative lexus's
 
05:48:09.030 --> 05:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
comments there
 
05:48:10.310 --> 05:48:10.320 align:start position:0%
the testimony that were heard
 
05:48:11.830 --> 05:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
specifically addressed that that
 
05:48:14.788 --> 05:48:14.798 align:start position:0%
language can be found not at all but can
 
05:48:16.470 --> 05:48:16.480 align:start position:0%
be found in new hampshire listing
 
05:48:16.480 --> 05:48:17.750 align:start position:0%
be found in new hampshire listing
contracts

05:48:17.750 --> 05:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
contracts
 
05:48:19.110 --> 05:48:19.120 align:start position:0%
and if we're looking for individual
 
05:48:21.670 --> 05:48:21.680 align:start position:0%
examples well that's awful hard to do
 
05:48:26.628 --> 05:48:26.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:33.030 --> 05:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:35.190 --> 05:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
it was it was a representative silver
 
05:48:37.350 --> 05:48:37.360 align:start position:0%
that brought this up
 
05:48:39.990 --> 05:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:48:42.310 --> 05:48:42.320 align:start position:0%
he said only the owner or formal power
 
05:48:44.390 --> 05:48:44.400 align:start position:0%

05:49:49.270 --> 05:49:49.280 align:start position:0%
can't do any harm and
 
05:49:51.750 --> 05:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
if it and i'm still not sure whether or
 
05:49:55.190 --> 05:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
not it's necessary but if it
 
05:49:58.470 --> 05:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
if it simply clarifies the intent of the
 
05:49:58.480 --> 05:49:59.750 align:start position:0%
if it simply clarifies the intent of the
law

05:49:59.750 --> 05:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
law
 
05:50:02.070 --> 05:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
and puts it in a place where it's easier
 
05:50:04.390 --> 05:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
for people to find that may serve some
 
05:50:04.400 --> 05:50:06.070 align:start position:0%
for people to find that may serve some
purpose

05:50:06.070 --> 05:50:06.080 align:start position:0%

05:51:40.070 --> 05:51:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:43.190 --> 05:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion uh sure this is a
 
05:51:44.708 --> 05:51:44.718 align:start position:0%
study committee for
 
05:51:47.590 --> 05:51:47.600 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire hiring process um
 
05:51:47.600 --> 05:51:48.628 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire hiring process um
and

05:51:48.628 --> 05:51:48.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:51:50.548 --> 05:51:50.558 align:start position:0%
i just think that uh
 
05:51:52.230 --> 05:51:52.240 align:start position:0%
it's inherent that government is gonna
 
05:51:54.230 --> 05:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
just be a little bit slower in hiring
 
05:51:56.788 --> 05:51:56.798 align:start position:0%
than the private sector and
 
05:51:56.798 --> 05:51:57.830 align:start position:0%
than the private sector and
that

05:51:57.830 --> 05:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:51:59.510 --> 05:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
we just don't need a study committee for
 
05:51:59.520 --> 05:52:01.110 align:start position:0%
we just don't need a study committee for
this

05:52:01.110 --> 05:52:01.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:52:02.628 --> 05:52:02.638 align:start position:0%
you know it's just a symptom of the
 
05:52:02.638 --> 05:52:03.750 align:start position:0%
you know it's just a symptom of the
overall

05:52:03.750 --> 05:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
overall
 
05:52:05.190 --> 05:52:05.200 align:start position:0%
labor shortage that everyone's
 
05:52:05.200 --> 05:52:07.030 align:start position:0%
labor shortage that everyone's
experiencing

05:52:07.030 --> 05:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
experiencing
 
05:52:08.390 --> 05:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
more than the process that's been the
 
05:52:11.270 --> 05:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:12.788 --> 05:52:12.798 align:start position:0%
representative rhodes do you wish to
 
05:52:14.628 --> 05:52:14.638 align:start position:0%
speak to your second no thank you madam
 
05:52:17.270 --> 05:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
chair okay representative
 
05:52:19.430 --> 05:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
psychic and then grota
 
05:52:21.430 --> 05:52:21.440 align:start position:0%
did we hear that
 
05:52:23.990 --> 05:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
from that other states had the same kind
 
05:52:26.788 --> 05:52:26.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:31.110 --> 05:52:31.120 align:start position:0%
i i does anybody recall that
 
05:52:33.190 --> 05:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
no i don't recall that
 
05:52:37.350 --> 05:52:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:39.510 --> 05:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
this this i've had i've i've thought
 
05:52:41.030 --> 05:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
about this bill for some time and i
 
05:52:43.110 --> 05:52:43.120 align:start position:0%
think that it's important that we
 
05:52:45.510 --> 05:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
uh pass it because first of all i don't
 
05:52:46.868 --> 05:52:46.878 align:start position:0%
think anything should be inherent to
 
05:52:48.708 --> 05:52:48.718 align:start position:0%
anything if that's the argument that's
 
05:52:51.190 --> 05:52:51.200 align:start position:0%
not in my book strong enough
 
05:52:53.910 --> 05:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
number two if there's a process that um
 
05:52:55.590 --> 05:52:55.600 align:start position:0%
we're doing that slows down our hiring
 
05:52:57.190 --> 05:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
that can be resolved i think we should
 
05:52:58.708 --> 05:52:58.718 align:start position:0%
certainly do that
 
05:53:01.830 --> 05:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
number three we have a 20 percent
 
05:53:03.510 --> 05:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate throughout our state
 
05:53:05.910 --> 05:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
agencies 50 percent in corrections which
 
05:53:07.990 --> 05:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
is significant
 
05:53:09.510 --> 05:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
so i think that
 
05:53:11.990 --> 05:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
i know that we have a low unemployment
 
05:53:12.000 --> 05:53:13.270 align:start position:0%
i know that we have a low unemployment
rate

05:53:13.270 --> 05:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
rate
 
05:53:14.948 --> 05:53:14.958 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire but if there's some way
 
05:53:17.750 --> 05:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
that we can get our state agencies
 
05:53:19.830 --> 05:53:19.840 align:start position:0%
employ employment
 
05:53:21.510 --> 05:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
ratios up
 
05:53:24.390 --> 05:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
and use that and use this lady to do so
 
05:53:25.750 --> 05:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
and look at the way we do hire our
 
05:53:27.670 --> 05:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
practices our hiring practices i think
 
05:53:29.670 --> 05:53:29.680 align:start position:0%
that we should do that that's my
 
05:53:32.548 --> 05:53:32.558 align:start position:0%
recommendation is to pass this bill okay
 
05:53:35.030 --> 05:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
other comments
 
05:53:38.628 --> 05:53:38.638 align:start position:0%
representative gr fellows
 
05:53:41.030 --> 05:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
um i i think that there are probably
 
05:53:43.830 --> 05:53:43.840 align:start position:0%
room for improvements
 
05:53:43.840 --> 05:53:45.670 align:start position:0%
room for improvements
they

05:53:45.670 --> 05:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
they
 
05:53:48.390 --> 05:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
processes for
 
05:53:51.110 --> 05:53:51.120 align:start position:0%
an application has to go through many
 
05:53:53.510 --> 05:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
steps before a person actually gets
 
05:53:55.270 --> 05:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
hired and i think there can be
 
05:53:55.280 --> 05:53:56.548 align:start position:0%
hired and i think there can be
improvements

05:53:56.548 --> 05:53:56.558 align:start position:0%
improvements
 
05:53:58.150 --> 05:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
but given
 
05:54:00.548 --> 05:54:00.558 align:start position:0%
the current situation with
 
05:54:03.670 --> 05:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
the agency having to try to you know
 
05:54:06.948 --> 05:54:06.958 align:start position:0%
hire people through covid and through a
 
05:54:08.548 --> 05:54:08.558 align:start position:0%
period when we know
 
05:54:10.868 --> 05:54:10.878 align:start position:0%
you know there are vacancies in the
 
05:54:14.230 --> 05:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
private sector also i think that this is
 
05:54:16.390 --> 05:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
not the year to do this
 
05:54:19.990 --> 05:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you i represent goalie
 
05:54:22.390 --> 05:54:22.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and i
 
05:54:25.110 --> 05:54:25.120 align:start position:0%
will vote against the itl as well if i
 
05:54:28.390 --> 05:54:28.400 align:start position:0%
recall correctly i believe we had
 
05:54:29.990 --> 05:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
both the chair and vice chair of the
 
05:54:31.430 --> 05:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
labor committee here before us
 
05:54:34.708 --> 05:54:34.718 align:start position:0%
testifying in support of this bill
 
05:54:36.230 --> 05:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
both agreeing that
 
05:54:37.910 --> 05:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
it needs to be looked at
 
05:54:40.150 --> 05:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
in a bipartisan way and so for that
 
05:54:43.670 --> 05:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
reason i will vote against itl and
 
05:54:45.590 --> 05:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
support another motion thank you
 
05:54:47.270 --> 05:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
representative seitek
 
05:54:49.750 --> 05:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
well the same way that we have within
 
05:54:52.470 --> 05:54:52.480 align:start position:0%
our province the ability to examine
 
05:54:54.788 --> 05:54:54.798 align:start position:0%
boards without anybody bothering us i
 
05:54:57.590 --> 05:54:57.600 align:start position:0%
think the labor committee can do this on
 
05:54:58.788 --> 05:54:58.798 align:start position:0%
their own
 
05:55:00.548 --> 05:55:00.558 align:start position:0%
what concerns me
 
05:55:00.558 --> 05:55:01.750 align:start position:0%
what concerns me
is

05:55:01.750 --> 05:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:55:04.948 --> 05:55:04.958 align:start position:0%
that this is a really in the weeds
 
05:55:07.190 --> 05:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
kind of thing are we really going to get
 
05:55:10.230 --> 05:55:10.240 align:start position:0%
into how the application process works
 
05:55:12.948 --> 05:55:12.958 align:start position:0%
at doe it goes to this desk that desk
 
05:55:14.788 --> 05:55:14.798 align:start position:0%
we're going to be shadowing these people
 
05:55:14.798 --> 05:55:15.590 align:start position:0%
we're going to be shadowing these people
just

05:55:15.590 --> 05:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
just
 
05:55:17.590 --> 05:55:17.600 align:start position:0%
this is a committee that wants to do
 
05:55:19.110 --> 05:55:19.120 align:start position:0%
global stuff they're not going to want
 
05:55:21.510 --> 05:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
to sit there and sift through i just
 
05:55:25.030 --> 05:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
don't see it happening i good luck but i
 
05:55:26.628 --> 05:55:26.638 align:start position:0%
don't see it actually accomplishing
 
05:55:29.510 --> 05:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
anything yes i'd like to expand on that
 
05:55:31.750 --> 05:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
the bureau of personnel says that they
 
05:55:33.590 --> 05:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
are working on this problem they have
 
05:55:35.590 --> 05:55:35.600 align:start position:0%
been for a while and they are
 
05:55:39.190 --> 05:55:39.200 align:start position:0%
investigating it i think that they are
 
05:55:41.270 --> 05:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
fully capable of investigating the
 
05:55:43.510 --> 05:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
hiring process in much greater detail
 
05:55:45.510 --> 05:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
than a legislative committee
 
05:55:47.270 --> 05:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
and i think they would prefer to be able
 
05:55:49.110 --> 05:55:49.120 align:start position:0%
to do it without us looking over their
 
05:55:49.120 --> 05:55:50.548 align:start position:0%
to do it without us looking over their

that i'm
 
06:11:34.628 --> 06:11:34.638 align:start position:0%

program is operational
 
06:11:39.030 --> 06:11:39.040 align:start position:0%

i just don't know
 
06:11:45.350 --> 06:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
how much time
 
06:11:47.350 --> 06:11:47.360 align:start position:0%

second part at the end he gives an
 
06:11:50.948 --> 06:11:50.958 align:start position:0%
example of
 
06:11:53.190 --> 06:11:53.200 align:start position:0%
its therapeutic cannabis identification
 
06:11:55.190 --> 06:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
card program i don't know that that's
 
06:11:57.270 --> 06:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
directly comparable but it's an example
 
06:11:58.868 --> 06:11:58.878 align:start position:0%
of why or of
 
06:12:01.510 --> 06:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
the concern about an early audit
 
06:12:02.788 --> 06:12:02.798 align:start position:0%
is also
 
06:12:04.788 --> 06:12:04.798 align:start position:0%

we're going to have um
 
06:12:20.070 --> 06:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
lba is going to have a moving target if
 
06:12:22.310 --> 06:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
if that's the right expression or it's
 
06:12:26.788 --> 06:12:26.798 align:start position:0%
going to be amorphous how do you
 
06:12:26.798 --> 06:12:29.190 align:start position:0%
