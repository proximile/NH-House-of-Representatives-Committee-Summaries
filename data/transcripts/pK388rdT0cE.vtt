00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
public hearing for the non- gerine
 
00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
amendment to Senate Bill 315 the
 
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.470 align:start position:0%
 
2024-25

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:44.480 align:start position:0%
2024-25
 
00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:47.720 align:start position:0%
7h and I recognize chairman Roy to
 
00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
introduce his Amendment thank you madam
 
00:16:53.189 --> 00:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
chairman uh members of the
 
00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:55.880 align:start position:0%
committee today I'm bringing forward
 
00:16:59.309 --> 00:16:59.319 align:start position:0%
Amendment 164 7h
 
00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
this deals with the issue of
 
00:17:04.029 --> 00:17:04.039 align:start position:0%
squatters um we had a brief conversation
 
00:17:06.429 --> 00:17:06.439 align:start position:0%
about it last week and in between that
 
00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
time and now we've taken steps to narrow
 
00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
down this
 
00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
definition and with regard to who it
 
00:17:15.949 --> 00:17:15.959 align:start position:0%
applies to and who it
 
00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't we wanted to be very careful to
 
00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
make sure that we weren't getting
 
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
involved in landlord tenant disputes or
 
00:17:26.789 --> 00:17:26.799 align:start position:0%
in any way infringing on anyone's rights
 
00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
to doe process through a vict
 
00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
process this is designed to deal
 
00:17:33.669 --> 00:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
strictly with people that have
 
00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely no business being in someone
 
00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:37.960 align:start position:0%
else's home or property and who have
 
00:17:41.029 --> 00:17:41.039 align:start position:0%
taken advantage of our lack laws to do
 
00:17:44.029 --> 00:17:44.039 align:start position:0%
so I understand that we will probably
 
00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:46.600 align:start position:0%
have to um make some changes to this as
 
00:17:48.909 --> 00:17:48.919 align:start position:0%
we listen to testimony this morning this
 
00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:51.400 align:start position:0%
is designed to be the beginning step and
 
00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:53.320 align:start position:0%
we will continue to work on it to get it
 
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
correct before we bring it forward to
 
00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
the floor but it is something that our
 
00:17:59.710 --> 00:17:59.720 align:start position:0%
constituents have asked for
 
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
um I know personally I've received
 
00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:04.360 align:start position:0%
numerous emails and phone calls and
 
00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:06.200 align:start position:0%
there are numerous stakeholders involved
 
00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
in asking us to do
 
00:18:10.789 --> 00:18:10.799 align:start position:0%
something therefore I'm bringing this
 
00:18:12.549 --> 00:18:12.559 align:start position:0%
forward and I ask that we work on it
 
00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:15.320 align:start position:0%
together and that we take our time and
 
00:18:17.789 --> 00:18:17.799 align:start position:0%
get it right but it's not something that
 
00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
can be put off because it's happening to
 
00:18:24.029 --> 00:18:24.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:26.200 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:18:28.549 --> 00:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
celik thank you and thank you for taking
 
00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
my question um I'm curious see since I
 
00:18:35.549 --> 00:18:35.559 align:start position:0%
live in a college town where many
 
00:18:38.549 --> 00:18:38.559 align:start position:0%
students sublet their properties over
 
00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
the summer and they tend not to do it
 
00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
with any paperwork or any proof or
 
00:18:46.149 --> 00:18:46.159 align:start position:0%
documentation of any kind so that there
 
00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:47.720 align:start position:0%
are other people living in their
 
00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
Apartments who are certainly not listed
 
00:18:54.149 --> 00:18:54.159 align:start position:0%
in anything um how you know if if for
 
00:18:57.669 --> 00:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
example um someone subl an apartment and
 
00:18:59.350 --> 00:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
they believed they were doing everything
 
00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
they were supposed to but the landlord
 
00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
determined that they weren't on the
 
00:19:04.549 --> 00:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
lease and decided they shouldn't be
 
00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:07.000 align:start position:0%
there what's the protection for the
 
00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:08.440 align:start position:0%
person who believed that they had an
 
00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:11.480 align:start position:0%
appropriate subl with this bill well as
 
00:19:13.029 --> 00:19:13.039 align:start position:0%
it's written now and as I said I'm I'm
 
00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:15.880 align:start position:0%
certainly open to making tweaks to it as
 
00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
it's written now the landlord first of
 
00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:20.840 align:start position:0%
all would have to swear under the pains
 
00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
and penalties of perjury that he had no
 
00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
idea that this person is a tenant never
 
00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
heard of them before they never he's
 
00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
never seen them before so first of all
 
00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
he's making a statement that if he
 
00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:33.400 align:start position:0%
falsified he could be charged second of
 
00:19:35.789 --> 00:19:35.799 align:start position:0%
all it allows for the person to produce
 
00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:39.320 align:start position:0%
any kind of evidence um a bill something
 
00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:40.520 align:start position:0%
with their address that shows that
 
00:19:42.909 --> 00:19:42.919 align:start position:0%
they've lived there for a period of time
 
00:19:45.029 --> 00:19:45.039 align:start position:0%
so it's not even Witnesses they know
 
00:19:47.669 --> 00:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
she's lived with us this is about people
 
00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:50.720 align:start position:0%
who have no evidence the land lord has
 
00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:52.200 align:start position:0%
no idea who they are it's never seen
 
00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:55.909 align:start position:0%
no idea who they are it's never seen
them

00:19:55.909 --> 00:19:55.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:58.990 --> 00:19:59.000 align:start position:0%
before thank you right I understand that
 
00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
but often times especially what I
 
00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:03.720 align:start position:0%
witness with students is they arrange a
 
00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
summer sublet purely by word of mouth
 
00:20:07.549 --> 00:20:07.559 align:start position:0%
with the other student who's on the
 
00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
lease right so um for example you know
 
00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
if if Jody was a college student in
 
00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:16.640 align:start position:0%
Durham and she had an apartment and I
 
00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
representative new will and I I had
 
00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:19.720 align:start position:0%
arranged with her just through text
 
00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:21.480 align:start position:0%
messaging or whatever I wouldn't have
 
00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
any proof or documentation
 
00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
representative n may not have bothered
 
00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
to notify her landlord because she might
 
00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:28.240 align:start position:0%
not have realized that she should tell
 
00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
her landord Lord you know and and I
 
00:20:31.669 --> 00:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have thought to tell the
 
00:20:33.549 --> 00:20:33.559 align:start position:0%
landlord cuz I just thought well isn't
 
00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
this just kind of how it works I'm just
 
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
staying here for a couple months in the
 
00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
summer so again there wouldn't be
 
00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
documentation but if the landlord then
 
00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:41.720 align:start position:0%
decided to come in and found me and
 
00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
viewed me as a squatter because I'm not
 
00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:45.200 align:start position:0%
on the lease I'm just a friend of
 
00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
Representative NES what's what's the
 
00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:50.240 align:start position:0%
protection in that case with
 
00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
this I would um first point to the
 
00:20:55.549 --> 00:20:55.559 align:start position:0%
language currently in there that says
 
00:20:57.630 --> 00:20:57.640 align:start position:0%
unrestricted um if it's a rental
 
00:20:59.390 --> 00:20:59.400 align:start position:0%
property it falls into the restricted
 
00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:01.640 align:start position:0%
property um so this wouldn't apply to
 
00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:03.440 align:start position:0%
that if it's a if it's a rental a true
 
00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
rental that's used as a rental um but I
 
00:21:08.669 --> 00:21:08.679 align:start position:0%
would also say at some point we have to
 
00:21:10.909 --> 00:21:10.919 align:start position:0%
to draw a line and you can come up with
 
00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:12.440 align:start position:0%
as many scenarios as you want but at the
 
00:21:13.669 --> 00:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
end of the day what happens if that's
 
00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
someone's house so we have to be able to
 
00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:18.440 align:start position:0%
balance that somehow so we can't
 
00:21:20.909 --> 00:21:20.919 align:start position:0%
extend to to people that just seem to
 
00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:22.480 align:start position:0%
have no way to prove that they were
 
00:21:24.269 --> 00:21:24.279 align:start position:0%
there legally at all
 
00:21:26.789 --> 00:21:26.799 align:start position:0%
ever so as to allow people to move into
 
00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
someone's home while they're not home so
 
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:36.269 --> 00:21:36.279 align:start position:0%
balance representative
 
00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
Muse thank you for taking my question um
 
00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
it's not like New Hampshire doesn't have
 
00:21:46.269 --> 00:21:46.279 align:start position:0%
any protections against this at all and
 
00:21:48.669 --> 00:21:48.679 align:start position:0%
uh what I'm wondering is what do you
 
00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
think the problem is specifically where
 
00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
with our existing civil law
 
00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:00.360 align:start position:0%
that requires us to speedily take uh
 
00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:01.960 align:start position:0%
this kind of an
 
00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:04.360 align:start position:0%
action um actually we we have no
 
00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
protections against this at all we have
 
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
a protection against adverse possession
 
00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:10.480 align:start position:0%
which means I actually take your home
 
00:22:13.549 --> 00:22:13.559 align:start position:0%
and it's mine now but against me while
 
00:22:16.549 --> 00:22:16.559 align:start position:0%
you're on vacation moving in putting my
 
00:22:17.909 --> 00:22:17.919 align:start position:0%
stuff in there and making myself a
 
00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:19.880 align:start position:0%
sandwich and saying I live here now and
 
00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
you come home and say he doesn't belong
 
00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:22.760 align:start position:0%
here I say I do he said I could live
 
00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
here you have no protection at all the
 
00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
police are going to say go to court now
 
00:22:29.149 --> 00:22:29.159 align:start position:0%
you may have the ability to pay for a
 
00:22:31.669 --> 00:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
hotel and an attorney to have me removed
 
00:22:35.149 --> 00:22:35.159 align:start position:0%
after months but say it's a family with
 
00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
young children who come home from a
 
00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
vacation they went on a 10-day Cruise
 
00:22:41.549 --> 00:22:41.559 align:start position:0%
they saved up a year to pay for that
 
00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:44.600 align:start position:0%
they've got uh a 2-year-old an
 
00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:46.760 align:start position:0%
18-month-old and their seven-year-old
 
00:22:48.269 --> 00:22:48.279 align:start position:0%
grandmother with them lived with them
 
00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:50.440 align:start position:0%
they get home someone's in their home
 
00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:52.640 align:start position:0%
they say we live here they said we could
 
00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:54.520 align:start position:0%
now they have to go get a hotel get a
 
00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
lawyer and wait time to get into the
 
00:22:58.669 --> 00:22:58.679 align:start position:0%
courts to have someone evicted they the
 
00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:01.240 align:start position:0%
money for it so why should someone who
 
00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
saved their life to build a home and buy
 
00:23:05.669 --> 00:23:05.679 align:start position:0%
a home be forced to be homeless while
 
00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:08.600 align:start position:0%
someone else squats in their home and
 
00:23:11.029 --> 00:23:11.039 align:start position:0%
our laws have no mechanism to remove
 
00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:14.320 align:start position:0%
somebody immediately so in effect the
 
00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:17.200 align:start position:0%
person who owns the home is now homeless
 
00:23:19.029 --> 00:23:19.039 align:start position:0%
and their kids are homeless they can't
 
00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
go to work because their clothes are in
 
00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
there the kids can't go to school their
 
00:23:25.789 --> 00:23:25.799 align:start position:0%
entire life is upside down and contrary
 
00:23:28.029 --> 00:23:28.039 align:start position:0%
to popular belief I've received emails
 
00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
from s people this has happened in The
 
00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:33.200 align:start position:0%
Lakes area I got one and somewhere on
 
00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:35.480 align:start position:0%
the coast another
 
00:23:39.269 --> 00:23:39.279 align:start position:0%
one followup please follow
 
00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:41.960 align:start position:0%
up so I I I do know that in New
 
00:23:44.029 --> 00:23:44.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um you actually have to live
 
00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
in a place for 20 years to be able to
 
00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:50.240 align:start position:0%
claim a residency um uh short of that 20
 
00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
years you're trespassing and my
 
00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:55.640 align:start position:0%
understanding is there is a civil
 
00:23:59.190 --> 00:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
process that uh can be undertaken
 
00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
that we have used successfully in this
 
00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:04.120 align:start position:0%
state for many years uh represent people
 
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
are in this
 
00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:08.440 align:start position:0%
situation yeah my my qu my question uh
 
00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:24:14.669 --> 00:24:14.679 align:start position:0%
boils down to the fact um of why is this
 
00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
bill necessary at this time sure I'll
 
00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:21.640 align:start position:0%
reiterate the 20-year law is for adverse
 
00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
possession that means before it can
 
00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
become legally yours in other words the
 
00:24:28.029 --> 00:24:28.039 align:start position:0%
house is now yours not only can you stay
 
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
there it's your house after 20 years
 
00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:33.320 align:start position:0%
that doesn't apply to get people out in
 
00:24:35.549 --> 00:24:35.559 align:start position:0%
the meantime and to your point there is
 
00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
a civil process indeed and that would
 
00:24:39.549 --> 00:24:39.559 align:start position:0%
involve going to court getting on the
 
00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:41.200 align:start position:0%
docket hiring an
 
00:24:43.669 --> 00:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
attorney um and during that time which
 
00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
can be months sometimes a year because
 
00:24:48.789 --> 00:24:48.799 align:start position:0%
it's the normal eviction process the
 
00:24:50.549 --> 00:24:50.559 align:start position:0%
person who owns the home the person
 
00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
who's paying the taxes on the home can't
 
00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:55.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:00.200 align:start position:0%
home representative PR
 
00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
so just for a little Clarity like in
 
00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
representative s they sublet nobody
 
00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:08.360 align:start position:0%
would know that they were subletting
 
00:25:11.149 --> 00:25:11.159 align:start position:0%
because the real owner isn't
 
00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
coming to to Mo get back in right so
 
00:25:17.269 --> 00:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
nobody would know that it only happens
 
00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
in like the scenario that you're talking
 
00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
about they went away for a little while
 
00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
the real occupants show up and then
 
00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
somebody else is there that's correct so
 
00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
the chances of representative s isn't
 
00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
going to happen no the only way I could
 
00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:35.240 align:start position:0%
potentially see what her scenario
 
00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:37.000 align:start position:0%
happening is if the landlord wanted to
 
00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
relet the house to someone and that
 
00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:40.640 align:start position:0%
person was there and so well no I
 
00:25:42.149 --> 00:25:42.159 align:start position:0%
already let it and they don't have a
 
00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
lease they'd end up in a court dispute
 
00:25:46.549 --> 00:25:46.559 align:start position:0%
and that's that I don't I don't see this
 
00:25:48.669 --> 00:25:48.679 align:start position:0%
law applying because it's restricted
 
00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:25:57.630 --> 00:25:57.640 align:start position:0%
Newman yeah I just have a question on
 
00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
the language on
 
00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
um first page line 12 and it's just I'm
 
00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:06.440 align:start position:0%
a little bit confused about what it
 
00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:09.240 align:start position:0%
actually means the the language and it's
 
00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
it says has caused to believe that the
 
00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
person is not a legal occupant of a
 
00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:16.760 align:start position:0%
non-restricted property pursuant to a
 
00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
written lease or agreement or other
 
00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
agreement between the person and the
 
00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
owner and the design and my confusion is
 
00:26:25.669 --> 00:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
does it apply to someone that has a
 
00:26:28.389 --> 00:26:28.399 align:start position:0%
lease or does it only apply to people
 
00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:30.520 align:start position:0%
that are unrestricted and don't have a
 
00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
lease which one well the unrestricted
 
00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
part refers to the category of property
 
00:26:38.029 --> 00:26:38.039 align:start position:0%
whether it's a a a a lease property
 
00:26:39.669 --> 00:26:39.679 align:start position:0%
that's used for rentals that falls under
 
00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
our rental lease laws and the the the
 
00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:44.630 align:start position:0%
our rental lease laws and the the the
lease

00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
lease
 
00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
portion is meant to cover people who
 
00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
don't have a lease because as has been
 
00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:50.440 align:start position:0%
pointed out many people don't have a
 
00:26:52.029 --> 00:26:52.039 align:start position:0%
written lease so it covers both whether
 
00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
they have a lease or other agreement
 
00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
such as a handshake that says you can
 
00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up and we so that that
 
00:27:01.909 --> 00:27:01.919 align:start position:0%
definition of unrestricted property
 
00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
would be in the law that's being that
 
00:27:06.029 --> 00:27:06.039 align:start position:0%
that would be amended by this yes it's
 
00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:08.480 align:start position:0%
an existing statute and that language
 
00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:09.880 align:start position:0%
came at the suggestion of the Attorney
 
00:27:11.669 --> 00:27:11.679 align:start position:0%
General's office so as to stay out of
 
00:27:18.269 --> 00:27:18.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:22.549 --> 00:27:22.559 align:start position:0%
disputes I I'm surprised personally I'm
 
00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
surprised that that's not Criminal
 
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
Trespass and they're thrown out
 
00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
immediately by the police but that's
 
00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
that's a person might miss perhaps
 
00:27:33.870 --> 00:27:33.880 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding this squatter business
 
00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:35.960 align:start position:0%
if somebody is in the house when you get
 
00:27:38.269 --> 00:27:38.279 align:start position:0%
home didn't they break and Enter isn't
 
00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
that a crime right then and there I mean
 
00:27:43.509 --> 00:27:43.519 align:start position:0%
that this is a criminal act you you
 
00:27:46.149 --> 00:27:46.159 align:start position:0%
would one would think so um but first of
 
00:27:48.669 --> 00:27:48.679 align:start position:0%
all um we don't have a breaking and
 
00:27:51.029 --> 00:27:51.039 align:start position:0%
entering statute per se in in New
 
00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:54.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have a um robbery statute
 
00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:56.120 align:start position:0%
that means that you illegally enter a
 
00:27:57.509 --> 00:27:57.519 align:start position:0%
property with the intent to commit a
 
00:27:57.519 --> 00:27:58.870 align:start position:0%
property with the intent to commit a
crime

00:27:58.870 --> 00:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
crime
 
00:28:01.389 --> 00:28:01.399 align:start position:0%
and that would apply but once someone
 
00:28:04.029 --> 00:28:04.039 align:start position:0%
has said I'm legally here now you have
 
00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:07.480 align:start position:0%
to prove did they and it puts the police
 
00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:09.880 align:start position:0%
in in a horrible situation because if
 
00:28:11.389 --> 00:28:11.399 align:start position:0%
they deprive someone of their rights
 
00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
because they're a tenant and you know
 
00:28:15.909 --> 00:28:15.919 align:start position:0%
it's it's it it puts them in a difficult
 
00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
situation so they inevitably do what
 
00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:19.480 align:start position:0%
they should and say you got to go to
 
00:28:22.149 --> 00:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
court with this mess um but to your
 
00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:24.640 align:start position:0%
point you would think it's Prime of face
 
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
you broken in or you don't belong here
 
00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:29.000 align:start position:0%
but once they say no oh I live here I'm
 
00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
not committing a crime it takes it into
 
00:28:36.029 --> 00:28:36.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:38.320 align:start position:0%
realm see no more questions thank you
 
00:28:46.029 --> 00:28:46.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:02.149 --> 00:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
good morning uh my name is kirson
 
00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:04.120 align:start position:0%
Cornell I am an attorney at New
 
00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:06.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legal assistance I'm here
 
00:29:09.149 --> 00:29:09.159 align:start position:0%
today in opposition to this amendment um
 
00:29:11.149 --> 00:29:11.159 align:start position:0%
I want to make sure that everybody is
 
00:29:13.149 --> 00:29:13.159 align:start position:0%
clear about a couple of things before we
 
00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:16.640 align:start position:0%
get started unrestricted property under
 
00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:22.840 align:start position:0%
the law um refers to um rental property
 
00:29:25.909 --> 00:29:25.919 align:start position:0%
that um include that includes four units
 
00:29:28.669 --> 00:29:28.679 align:start position:0%
or less where the owner is occupying one
 
00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
of the units or single family homes in
 
00:29:34.269 --> 00:29:34.279 align:start position:0%
which the owner owns three or fewer
 
00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:37.000 align:start position:0%
properties so I honestly was having a
 
00:29:39.389 --> 00:29:39.399 align:start position:0%
little bit of a hard time hearing I just
 
00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:40.600 align:start position:0%
want to make sure we're clear about that
 
00:29:42.509 --> 00:29:42.519 align:start position:0%
cuz I thought that I heard it
 
00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:44.480 align:start position:0%
represented that uh unrestricted
 
00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:47.320 align:start position:0%
property did not relate to rental
 
00:29:48.789 --> 00:29:48.799 align:start position:0%
property and I want to be clear that it
 
00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
is it is distinguished from restricted
 
00:29:55.669 --> 00:29:55.679 align:start position:0%
property um which is all other property
 
00:29:59.029 --> 00:29:59.039 align:start position:0%
but for what I just said um and the you
 
00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
know basic reason behind this
 
00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
distinction is to try to allow uh a
 
00:30:06.149 --> 00:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
little bit more flexibility for
 
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
landlords who are who have only a few
 
00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
Properties or who live in the property
 
00:30:13.389 --> 00:30:13.399 align:start position:0%
that they're renting than uh those
 
00:30:16.269 --> 00:30:16.279 align:start position:0%
landlords who uh it's their business of
 
00:30:18.029 --> 00:30:18.039 align:start position:0%
renting housing so they have many
 
00:30:20.029 --> 00:30:20.039 align:start position:0%
properties so I just want to make sure
 
00:30:23.269 --> 00:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
we're clear about that um in terms of
 
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
adverse possession in order to gain any
 
00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:28.240 align:start position:0%
property rights through adverse p
 
00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
adverse possession which is typically uh
 
00:30:33.389 --> 00:30:33.399 align:start position:0%
what is referred to you know what
 
00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
squatting refers to um one has to openly
 
00:30:41.389 --> 00:30:41.399 align:start position:0%
um use the property for 20 years so it's
 
00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:44.320 align:start position:0%
not a matter of somebody coming and
 
00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
residing in a place for a couple of
 
00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:49.640 align:start position:0%
months there has to be 20 years um to
 
00:30:52.669 --> 00:30:52.679 align:start position:0%
gain any property rights uh with regards
 
00:30:55.669 --> 00:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
to what was stated um you know a family
 
00:30:58.750 --> 00:30:58.760 align:start position:0%
goes away for 10 days comes back that is
 
00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:01.240 align:start position:0%
in fact Criminal Trespass that would not
 
00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
require the eviction process um in order
 
00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:08.120 align:start position:0%
to remove the person um and while I am
 
00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
not an expert in criminal law um I do
 
00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
believe we have a burglary Statute in
 
00:31:14.269 --> 00:31:14.279 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire which would
 
00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:17.880 align:start position:0%
be breaking and entering so uh just
 
00:31:20.269 --> 00:31:20.279 align:start position:0%
wanted to to talk about those things
 
00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
first um you know I I'm happy to hear
 
00:31:27.269 --> 00:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
representative Roy say that um he
 
00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:28.840 align:start position:0%
understands that that we need to use a
 
00:31:31.629 --> 00:31:31.639 align:start position:0%
process to come to agreeable terms with
 
00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
regards to um a bill that is solving a a
 
00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
problem that uh I don't believe is is
 
00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:39.880 align:start position:0%
new and I don't believe is
 
00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
expansive um the amendment as written I
 
00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:46.760 align:start position:0%
think is confusingly written um as a
 
00:31:48.269 --> 00:31:48.279 align:start position:0%
lawyer I had to read it a number of
 
00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:51.480 align:start position:0%
times to fully understand what it meant
 
00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
um and the way that it is written it
 
00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
would be enforced by police officers and
 
00:31:58.789 --> 00:31:58.799 align:start position:0%
landlords who
 
00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
uh while they have jobs that I imagine I
 
00:32:02.789 --> 00:32:02.799 align:start position:0%
couldn't do I don't believe that they
 
00:32:05.669 --> 00:32:05.679 align:start position:0%
necessarily will be able to immediately
 
00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:07.000 align:start position:0%
understand the statute and they will be
 
00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:09.480 align:start position:0%
the ones responsible for enforcing it
 
00:32:13.710 --> 00:32:13.720 align:start position:0%
without any opportunity for um a an
 
00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
occupant whether they be there lawfully
 
00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
or not to be heard by a judge uh which
 
00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:21.320 align:start position:0%
is the typical process for civil
 
00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:22.950 align:start position:0%
is the typical process for civil
matters

00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
matters
 
00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
um which is the biggest issue I think
 
00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:28.760 align:start position:0%
with this bill is that it doesn't
 
00:32:31.789 --> 00:32:31.799 align:start position:0%
provide protection for people who either
 
00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
are there lawfully or who believe that
 
00:32:35.629 --> 00:32:35.639 align:start position:0%
they are there lawfully like in the
 
00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
example of the subletting student
 
00:32:41.029 --> 00:32:41.039 align:start position:0%
earlier uh the only way that that person
 
00:32:43.909 --> 00:32:43.919 align:start position:0%
would be able to get a hearing in a
 
00:32:46.789 --> 00:32:46.799 align:start position:0%
court would be if they uh declin to
 
00:32:49.509 --> 00:32:49.519 align:start position:0%
leave when they are asked by the police
 
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
and then um were removed and were
 
00:32:57.269 --> 00:32:57.279 align:start position:0%
arrested for trespass and then went to a
 
00:32:59.350 --> 00:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
criminal Court to be heard on whether or
 
00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:01.880 align:start position:0%
not they had committed the crime of
 
00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:06.440 align:start position:0%
trespass uh housing is a civil matter
 
00:33:08.149 --> 00:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
it's not a criminal matter and that's
 
00:33:10.669 --> 00:33:10.679 align:start position:0%
why laws related to rental housing are
 
00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:16.200 align:start position:0%
in RSA 540 or chapter instead of the um
 
00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
criminal law rsas which are in chapter
 
00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:21.320 align:start position:0%
600 and I'm not an expert on criminal
 
00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:23.080 align:start position:0%
law so I I can't tell you exactly I
 
00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:25.880 align:start position:0%
apologize for that um I can tell you
 
00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
that the bill references uh 6351 and
 
00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
6352 which I believe are TR I know one
 
00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
is trespassing and I believe the other
 
00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:34.310 align:start position:0%
is trespassing and I believe the other
is

00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:38.120 align:start position:0%
burglary uh my what my biggest concern
 
00:33:40.629 --> 00:33:40.639 align:start position:0%
with this bill is that as written I
 
00:33:43.789 --> 00:33:43.799 align:start position:0%
believe that it does uh something that
 
00:33:46.269 --> 00:33:46.279 align:start position:0%
people talk about a lot um but I'm not
 
00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
sure is ever really defined which is
 
00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
criminalizing homelessness so the
 
00:33:53.149 --> 00:33:53.159 align:start position:0%
example that was given was somebody
 
00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
coming home you somebody breaking into
 
00:33:57.070 --> 00:33:57.080 align:start position:0%
somebody's house while they're on
 
00:34:00.629 --> 00:34:00.639 align:start position:0%
vacation for 10 days um that is that is
 
00:34:04.029 --> 00:34:04.039 align:start position:0%
a crime and that is trespassing but a
 
00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:08.399 align:start position:0%
situation where somebody is staying in a
 
00:34:10.430 --> 00:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
place where they either believe that
 
00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
they are allowed to be or perhaps they
 
00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:15.919 align:start position:0%
you know if we take is true that they
 
00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
they know that they don't have any
 
00:34:22.069 --> 00:34:22.079 align:start position:0%
specific um authorization to be there
 
00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
that's a separate thing from
 
00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:26.800 align:start position:0%
trespass that is not having a place to
 
00:34:29.069 --> 00:34:29.079 align:start position:0%
go and and I believe everyone in this
 
00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
state is aware that we're in the midst
 
00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:33.200 align:start position:0%
of a crushing housing crisis in fact
 
00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:34.760 align:start position:0%
we're in the midst of the most acute
 
00:34:36.869 --> 00:34:36.879 align:start position:0%
housing crisis that is being experienced
 
00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
across the country we had the highest
 
00:34:41.869 --> 00:34:41.879 align:start position:0%
proportion increase percentage increase
 
00:34:45.430 --> 00:34:45.440 align:start position:0%
of uh homelessness over between 2022 and
 
00:34:48.069 --> 00:34:48.079 align:start position:0%
2023 I say all of this because I think
 
00:34:50.190 --> 00:34:50.200 align:start position:0%
it's important to realize that people
 
00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:52.399 align:start position:0%
are staying places where potentially
 
00:34:54.669 --> 00:34:54.679 align:start position:0%
they don't have direct authorization
 
00:34:56.190 --> 00:34:56.200 align:start position:0%
because they don't have anywhere to go
 
00:34:58.870 --> 00:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
there's a 6% vacancy rate in the state
 
00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
right now a healthy housing economy has
 
00:35:04.069 --> 00:35:04.079 align:start position:0%
a 5 to 6% vacancy rate and that means
 
00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:06.520 align:start position:0%
that it's a housing economy where a a
 
00:35:08.349 --> 00:35:08.359 align:start position:0%
per you know a person who's renting a
 
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
home could relatively easily um you know
 
00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:14.320 align:start position:0%
move from one rental to another without
 
00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:16.640 align:start position:0%
losing access to their Community without
 
00:35:18.589 --> 00:35:18.599 align:start position:0%
having to move across the state or even
 
00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:20.920 align:start position:0%
leave the state without having to uproot
 
00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:22.720 align:start position:0%
their their children from their school
 
00:35:25.589 --> 00:35:25.599 align:start position:0%
and and get new doctors um you know as
 
00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
we heard representative Roy say one of
 
00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
person becomes homeless their life falls
 
00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
apart and I think we need to be very
 
00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
clear about what is happening with this
 
00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
law and and what what is falling apart
 
00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
due to actions that I do not believe
 
00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:42.040 align:start position:0%
have Criminal Intent and intent is a
 
00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:43.960 align:start position:0%
requirement in order to be convicted of
 
00:35:48.430 --> 00:35:48.440 align:start position:0%
a crime um I think that there is a
 
00:35:52.109 --> 00:35:52.119 align:start position:0%
willingness on the part of um I know
 
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
there's a willingness on the part of New
 
00:35:56.589 --> 00:35:56.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Legal Assistant as well as um
 
00:35:58.630 --> 00:35:58.640 align:start position:0%
landlord representative to work together
 
00:36:02.829 --> 00:36:02.839 align:start position:0%
to find a solution to um the issue of
 
00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:04.680 align:start position:0%
circumstances where a person is not
 
00:36:06.589 --> 00:36:06.599 align:start position:0%
authorized to be in a in a building and
 
00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
it and it becomes difficult for a
 
00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
property owner to have them removed
 
00:36:12.349 --> 00:36:12.359 align:start position:0%
through the court process but we have a
 
00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
civil statute RSA 540A that provides an
 
00:36:19.069 --> 00:36:19.079 align:start position:0%
opportunity for both landlords and
 
00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
tenants to bring actions before the
 
00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:24.200 align:start position:0%
court to say that one of the you know
 
00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:25.640 align:start position:0%
the the other party is behaving
 
00:36:28.109 --> 00:36:28.119 align:start position:0%
unlawfully and to ask the court for and
 
00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:31.480 align:start position:0%
that does not take a long time uh so I I
 
00:36:34.309 --> 00:36:34.319 align:start position:0%
just would really encourage um ask this
 
00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
committee to uh think carefully about
 
00:36:41.069 --> 00:36:41.079 align:start position:0%
what the full consequences are of of
 
00:36:43.589 --> 00:36:43.599 align:start position:0%
this amendment uh the how it is treating
 
00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
people in very vulnerable situations and
 
00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
and to recognize that there is a group
 
00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
of people with a lot of knowledge in
 
00:36:52.069 --> 00:36:52.079 align:start position:0%
this area who are willing to work
 
00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
together to come up with something that
 
00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:55.270 align:start position:0%
together to come up with something that
will

00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:36:58.510 --> 00:36:58.520 align:start position:0%
work happy to take questions
 
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
so I I have a question um I'm looking
 
00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:04.200 align:start position:0%
the the criminal trespass has been
 
00:37:05.589 --> 00:37:05.599 align:start position:0%
mentioned so I'm looking at that
 
00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
particular statute
 
00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:13.880 align:start position:0%
and so I actually have so in here where
 
00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
it says about was asked to be was asked
 
00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
to leave or if they didn't leave and
 
00:37:22.349 --> 00:37:22.359 align:start position:0%
then you had mentioned a a court order
 
00:37:25.349 --> 00:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
so could you ex could you maybe touch on
 
00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
that a little bit more because I think I
 
00:37:28.589 --> 00:37:28.599 align:start position:0%
was a little bit confused so in this
 
00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
situation if you know you come home and
 
00:37:35.109 --> 00:37:35.119 align:start position:0%
there indeed is a is a person there and
 
00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
you say hey this is my house leave like
 
00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:39.880 align:start position:0%
what are you doing here and the cop
 
00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:42.280 align:start position:0%
comes and says you have to leave and
 
00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:43.430 align:start position:0%
comes and says you have to leave and
they

00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
won't then that's where I was confused
 
00:37:47.829 --> 00:37:47.839 align:start position:0%
on what you said about about going
 
00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
through court so in that instance the
 
00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:51.720 align:start position:0%
person would be arrested for criminal
 
00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
trespassing and they would be removed
 
00:37:56.430 --> 00:37:56.440 align:start position:0%
from the property that I believe is a
 
00:37:59.069 --> 00:37:59.079 align:start position:0%
different circumstance than what I
 
00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
understand this bill to be trying to
 
00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:03.400 align:start position:0%
address which is when a person is
 
00:38:06.309 --> 00:38:06.319 align:start position:0%
inhabiting a home for a period of time
 
00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
without a a rental facility a rental
 
00:38:13.069 --> 00:38:13.079 align:start position:0%
home without a direct relationship or
 
00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:15.880 align:start position:0%
direct agreement between that person and
 
00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:18.200 align:start position:0%
the landlord which again is what we get
 
00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:20.920 align:start position:0%
at in the issue of the college student
 
00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:22.680 align:start position:0%
that was the example that was given
 
00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:25.240 align:start position:0%
earlier where that student has not
 
00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:27.160 align:start position:0%
communicated directly with the landlord
 
00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:28.640 align:start position:0%
because they thought it was sorted out
 
00:38:29.950 --> 00:38:29.960 align:start position:0%
with the person who was living there
 
00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
previously and so they don't know that
 
00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:34.040 align:start position:0%
they're there unlawfully and then
 
00:38:36.589 --> 00:38:36.599 align:start position:0%
they're faced with this you know
 
00:38:39.349 --> 00:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
trespassing charge in that instance when
 
00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a person breaking
 
00:38:44.069 --> 00:38:44.079 align:start position:0%
into a home and and being there while a
 
00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:45.200 align:start position:0%
family's on
 
00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
vacation that's a very different
 
00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
situation that is CRI that is
 
00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
trespassing and potentially burglar like
 
00:38:54.309 --> 00:38:54.319 align:start position:0%
I said I'm not a criminal attorney so I
 
00:38:55.950 --> 00:38:55.960 align:start position:0%
can't I don't want to try to speak to
 
00:38:58.710 --> 00:38:58.720 align:start position:0%
that but if a person is guilty of
 
00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
trespass then they will be arrested and
 
00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:03.240 align:start position:0%
removed and they will have the
 
00:39:05.109 --> 00:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be heard by the criminal
 
00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
court that's a separate issue from a
 
00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:11.480 align:start position:0%
housing matter that goes before a civil
 
00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
court so in reference to what you had
 
00:39:16.829 --> 00:39:16.839 align:start position:0%
mentioned about the college student so
 
00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
if the college student is subletting
 
00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
their property and their lease clearly
 
00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:23.640 align:start position:0%
says that they're not to do that and
 
00:39:25.349 --> 00:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
they claim what we didn't know when they
 
00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:27.200 align:start position:0%
clearly signed the lease I would have to
 
00:39:28.309 --> 00:39:28.319 align:start position:0%
think if they were in college it would
 
00:39:31.309 --> 00:39:31.319 align:start position:0%
be literate so what is the process for
 
00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
that so so I I think that we're getting
 
00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
a little mixed up in the example the
 
00:39:40.309 --> 00:39:40.319 align:start position:0%
example as I understood was not that
 
00:39:42.829 --> 00:39:42.839 align:start position:0%
the the person who would be removed
 
00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
under this statute would be the
 
00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:46.640 align:start position:0%
subletter so the subletter may not have
 
00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
read the lease especially a college
 
00:39:50.109 --> 00:39:50.119 align:start position:0%
student I can honestly think of a time
 
00:39:51.790 --> 00:39:51.800 align:start position:0%
that I sublet a unit when I don't think
 
00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
I had any contact with the landlord so
 
00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
in under this it would be the person who
 
00:39:59.309 --> 00:39:59.319 align:start position:0%
was there the subletter who would be
 
00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
removed and potentially charged with
 
00:40:04.589 --> 00:40:04.599 align:start position:0%
trespassing not the person who violated
 
00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:07.960 align:start position:0%
the lease provision of of not subletting
 
00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
the apartment in the instance that um
 
00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
there is an effort to remove the person
 
00:40:17.069 --> 00:40:17.079 align:start position:0%
who was the lawful uh tenant under the
 
00:40:20.109 --> 00:40:20.119 align:start position:0%
lease who was violating the no
 
00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:22.760 align:start position:0%
subletting provision there is an
 
00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:25.000 align:start position:0%
eviction process for a
 
00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
violation a violation of substantial
 
00:40:29.349 --> 00:40:29.359 align:start position:0%
violation of a lease provision that
 
00:40:30.829 --> 00:40:30.839 align:start position:0%
would go through the eviction process
 
00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
under RSA 540 so it's two it's two
 
00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:36.920 align:start position:0%
separate issues and and under this
 
00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:39.720 align:start position:0%
amendment it is the person without
 
00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
knowledge who would be being removed and
 
00:40:45.349 --> 00:40:45.359 align:start position:0%
potentially charged with criminal
 
00:40:47.589 --> 00:40:47.599 align:start position:0%
receive criminal penalties because they
 
00:40:50.910 --> 00:40:50.920 align:start position:0%
were unaware of of their law whether
 
00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
their presence was allowed okay
 
00:40:57.470 --> 00:40:57.480 align:start position:0%
representative PR
 
00:40:59.550 --> 00:40:59.560 align:start position:0%
so let's jump right back into that so
 
00:41:00.910 --> 00:41:00.920 align:start position:0%
I'm a
 
00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
landlord I write
 
00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:08.720 align:start position:0%
noting not student goes off
 
00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
sublets and now I find out that's
 
00:41:14.910 --> 00:41:14.920 align:start position:0%
happened and I want that person removed
 
00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:16.720 align:start position:0%
because as a landlord I want to know
 
00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
who's in my building in my apartment I
 
00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:22.240 align:start position:0%
want to vet them but I didn't get to vet
 
00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
them so you're going to take my rights
 
00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:25.960 align:start position:0%
away as a
 
00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:28.480 align:start position:0%
landlord say that I can't remove that
 
00:41:30.910 --> 00:41:30.920 align:start position:0%
person that I didn't want there I'm not
 
00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:33.720 align:start position:0%
saying that at all what I am saying is
 
00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:36.760 align:start position:0%
that there we can create a civil process
 
00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
that can be Speedy that will allow that
 
00:41:41.069 --> 00:41:41.079 align:start position:0%
to occur I'm not trying to say that
 
00:41:43.109 --> 00:41:43.119 align:start position:0%
that's never an issue I'm not trying to
 
00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
say there aren't instances when there
 
00:41:47.910 --> 00:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
are problems with tenants who or not
 
00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
tenants people who are there um
 
00:41:52.589 --> 00:41:52.599 align:start position:0%
unlawfully perhaps
 
00:41:55.109 --> 00:41:55.119 align:start position:0%
unknowingly and we can address that
 
00:41:58.069 --> 00:41:58.079 align:start position:0%
issue I don't think that this Amendment
 
00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
does that appropriately and I don't
 
00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
think that it will do it successfully
 
00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
and I think that that there are is a
 
00:42:07.270 --> 00:42:07.280 align:start position:0%
group of people who again have a lot of
 
00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:08.480 align:start position:0%
expertise on these things who are
 
00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:10.720 align:start position:0%
willing to work together to address the
 
00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
issue you just
 
00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
articulated followup
 
00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:18.640 align:start position:0%
so I'm the landlord I go to the
 
00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
subletter I said you need to be out get
 
00:42:23.910 --> 00:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
them out that day we go through the
 
00:42:26.069 --> 00:42:26.079 align:start position:0%
Civil process that takes a while they
 
00:42:27.630 --> 00:42:27.640 align:start position:0%
trash my building because they know
 
00:42:30.190 --> 00:42:30.200 align:start position:0%
they're getting thrown out right but if
 
00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
I could have got them removed right then
 
00:42:34.309 --> 00:42:34.319 align:start position:0%
that day I wouldn't have that problem I
 
00:42:36.670 --> 00:42:36.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have all that damage so I would
 
00:42:38.190 --> 00:42:38.200 align:start position:0%
say two things one you could bring a
 
00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
claim against them in small claims court
 
00:42:43.390 --> 00:42:43.400 align:start position:0%
uh in order to get the the cost of the
 
00:42:46.309 --> 00:42:46.319 align:start position:0%
damage that occurred I would also say
 
00:42:49.030 --> 00:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
that in any uh business that you conduct
 
00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:52.440 align:start position:0%
there is some level of risk and that if
 
00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
the person and that also that the
 
00:42:56.589 --> 00:42:56.599 align:start position:0%
process doesn't have to take a long time
 
00:42:58.270 --> 00:42:58.280 align:start position:0%
I think that can create a process that
 
00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:00.800 align:start position:0%
is quite Speedy it may not be a removal
 
00:43:03.630 --> 00:43:03.640 align:start position:0%
in a day but it can be a removal it
 
00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
certainly is not the 30 30 days that uh
 
00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
an eviction takes which is what happens
 
00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
under RSA 540 and I think people are
 
00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
referring to so doesn't this amendment
 
00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:18.520 align:start position:0%
do that this amendment would uh require
 
00:43:23.710 --> 00:43:23.720 align:start position:0%
somebody to leave that day or be um at
 
00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:26.480 align:start position:0%
risk of being charged with trespassing
 
00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
they would have no no opportunity to go
 
00:43:30.549 --> 00:43:30.559 align:start position:0%
before a judge to prove that they were
 
00:43:30.559 --> 00:43:31.390 align:start position:0%
before a judge to prove that they were
there

00:43:31.390 --> 00:43:31.400 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
lawfully and the law would be enforced
 
00:43:40.270 --> 00:43:40.280 align:start position:0%
by um the police rather than a court um
 
00:43:43.150 --> 00:43:43.160 align:start position:0%
which is where civil matters belong
 
00:43:45.670 --> 00:43:45.680 align:start position:0%
under this there there's no way for a
 
00:43:47.790 --> 00:43:47.800 align:start position:0%
person it was also mentioned previously
 
00:43:49.150 --> 00:43:49.160 align:start position:0%
you know that the landlord would need to
 
00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
swear under the penalties of perjury
 
00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
that what they're saying is true um but
 
00:43:56.510 --> 00:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
it would also be very difficult for a
 
00:43:58.870 --> 00:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
person to bring any action if that
 
00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
statement was false and by the time they
 
00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:03.160 align:start position:0%
were able to bring an action they would
 
00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:04.880 align:start position:0%
have lost their personal property and
 
00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
they would be homeless and the redress
 
00:44:10.309 --> 00:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
for that would be difficult to come by
 
00:44:13.309 --> 00:44:13.319 align:start position:0%
and would take a long time what I'm
 
00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
saying is
 
00:44:17.430 --> 00:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
that we are not saying that that there
 
00:44:22.270 --> 00:44:22.280 align:start position:0%
is never a problem but creating a a
 
00:44:24.829 --> 00:44:24.839 align:start position:0%
criminal incorporating a criminal
 
00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
statute into a civil law does not create
 
00:44:30.829 --> 00:44:30.839 align:start position:0%
a process that truly addresses the
 
00:44:33.069 --> 00:44:33.079 align:start position:0%
problem and does create a process that
 
00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:36.200 align:start position:0%
places people who are there lawfully or
 
00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
believe that they are there lawfully at
 
00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
Great risk of losing their property of
 
00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
becoming homeless and potentially having
 
00:44:44.430 --> 00:44:44.440 align:start position:0%
criminal charges brought against
 
00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
them wait wait representative PR I'm
 
00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:48.520 align:start position:0%
going to move on and if your question
 
00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't get answered we'll come back to
 
00:44:51.589 --> 00:44:51.599 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:44:55.309 --> 00:44:55.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:57.589 --> 00:44:57.599 align:start position:0%
chair could you kind of Cl clarify for
 
00:44:59.910 --> 00:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
me when a person has a lease and then
 
00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
they lose their job they they start not
 
00:45:05.870 --> 00:45:05.880 align:start position:0%
paying their they fall behind on their
 
00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:09.880 align:start position:0%
rent where is the the line there that
 
00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
they are now illegally in the in the U
 
00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
process so yeah so in the instance that
 
00:45:20.470 --> 00:45:20.480 align:start position:0%
a person has a lease and they are uh
 
00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
become unable to pay their rent um that
 
00:45:26.230 --> 00:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
will go through the eviction process but
 
00:45:28.390 --> 00:45:28.400 align:start position:0%
for a payment of rent eviction it's a
 
00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:30.520 align:start position:0%
7-Day notice period and then it goes to
 
00:45:33.870 --> 00:45:33.880 align:start position:0%
court so a 7-Day notice period from the
 
00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
time that the person is notified that
 
00:45:37.950 --> 00:45:37.960 align:start position:0%
they're being evicted to the time that
 
00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:40.200 align:start position:0%
it goes through court and they you know
 
00:45:42.589 --> 00:45:42.599 align:start position:0%
that that process begins is only 7 days
 
00:45:44.190 --> 00:45:44.200 align:start position:0%
so then that court process goes on
 
00:45:47.069 --> 00:45:47.079 align:start position:0%
there's actually um an allowance in the
 
00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:49.000 align:start position:0%
law for the person to find a way to
 
00:45:52.150 --> 00:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
catch up on rent within like the time
 
00:45:55.030 --> 00:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
before the hearing comes in order to
 
00:45:57.910 --> 00:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
maintain housed um but that would go
 
00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
through uh the the eviction process
 
00:46:02.309 --> 00:46:02.319 align:start position:0%
which is in RSA
 
00:46:08.109 --> 00:46:08.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
followup and the other thing that
 
00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:12.640 align:start position:0%
confuses me about the the language as it
 
00:46:15.630 --> 00:46:15.640 align:start position:0%
is so if you if you own the
 
00:46:19.349 --> 00:46:19.359 align:start position:0%
home it's not a rental property so so
 
00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
what what's the circumstance how does
 
00:46:23.190 --> 00:46:23.200 align:start position:0%
this work when it's your home and
 
00:46:24.309 --> 00:46:24.319 align:start position:0%
somebody's in
 
00:46:27.430 --> 00:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
it how does that different from rental
 
00:46:29.309 --> 00:46:29.319 align:start position:0%
from a rental property oh I want to make
 
00:46:30.670 --> 00:46:30.680 align:start position:0%
sure I understand what you're saying so
 
00:46:33.109 --> 00:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
are you talking so if a person has a
 
00:46:34.990 --> 00:46:35.000 align:start position:0%
lease then they are renting that
 
00:46:36.910 --> 00:46:36.920 align:start position:0%
property and somebody else owns it so
 
00:46:38.750 --> 00:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
that could be a single family home it
 
00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
could be an apartment complex it could
 
00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
be a duplex for clarification I was just
 
00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:47.640 align:start position:0%
thinking that that the home was owner
 
00:46:50.270 --> 00:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
occupied how how is is that affected by
 
00:46:52.750 --> 00:46:52.760 align:start position:0%
this at all so owner
 
00:46:55.150 --> 00:46:55.160 align:start position:0%
occupied um dwellings are actually
 
00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
governed under RSA 540 B and um RSA 540b
 
00:47:04.030 --> 00:47:04.040 align:start position:0%
applies to instances where um an owner
 
00:47:07.069 --> 00:47:07.079 align:start position:0%
rents out say one bedroom of their house
 
00:47:09.670 --> 00:47:09.680 align:start position:0%
um and the process for removing a tenant
 
00:47:13.790 --> 00:47:13.800 align:start position:0%
under that law is um is is different and
 
00:47:16.510 --> 00:47:16.520 align:start position:0%
and doesn't have court process um there
 
00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
is a a notice requirement um and the the
 
00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
period of the notice requirement depends
 
00:47:27.790 --> 00:47:27.800 align:start position:0%
on the uh reason for the eviction uh and
 
00:47:30.829 --> 00:47:30.839 align:start position:0%
then the the person can seek the the
 
00:47:33.349 --> 00:47:33.359 align:start position:0%
owner can ask the police to come and
 
00:47:37.109 --> 00:47:37.119 align:start position:0%
have the person removed um the owner is
 
00:47:40.750 --> 00:47:40.760 align:start position:0%
required to um maintain the property the
 
00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
personal property of the person who's
 
00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:44.240 align:start position:0%
been living there for a period of time
 
00:47:46.150 --> 00:47:46.160 align:start position:0%
and allow them to come back and get it
 
00:47:47.349 --> 00:47:47.359 align:start position:0%
so that they don't lose all of their
 
00:47:50.309 --> 00:47:50.319 align:start position:0%
personal property it would note that in
 
00:47:50.319 --> 00:47:51.510 align:start position:0%
personal property it would note that in
those

00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
instances we have often found that
 
00:47:58.390 --> 00:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
police officers will are reluctant to
 
00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
enforce 540b because they believe
 
00:48:03.109 --> 00:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
housing to be a civil matter as well and
 
00:48:04.589 --> 00:48:04.599 align:start position:0%
suggest that it go through the court
 
00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
process unfortunately that's not a
 
00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:09.680 align:start position:0%
possibility under 540b which presents a
 
00:48:12.069 --> 00:48:12.079 align:start position:0%
separate legal issue but that's the
 
00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
process in that circumstance can I ask
 
00:48:16.750 --> 00:48:16.760 align:start position:0%
one final question just to clarify what
 
00:48:19.710 --> 00:48:19.720 align:start position:0%
you said about I wanted just one more
 
00:48:21.069 --> 00:48:21.079 align:start position:0%
yes but I would like to point out to the
 
00:48:23.349 --> 00:48:23.359 align:start position:0%
committee that we are this bill is not
 
00:48:25.309 --> 00:48:25.319 align:start position:0%
addressing people that have not paid
 
00:48:27.270 --> 00:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
their rent that a landlord knows is
 
00:48:28.589 --> 00:48:28.599 align:start position:0%
there this bill is
 
00:48:31.829 --> 00:48:31.839 align:start position:0%
addressing people that are illegally
 
00:48:34.990 --> 00:48:35.000 align:start position:0%
living or occupied a a property that
 
00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
they had no right to do in the first
 
00:48:38.750 --> 00:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
place and that the landlord was not
 
00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
aware that was even there so we're not
 
00:48:42.030 --> 00:48:42.040 align:start position:0%
talking about people that just didn't
 
00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
pay their rent so just like to clarify
 
00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
that and my question would be if if
 
00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
there is no rental they didn't rent out
 
00:48:50.910 --> 00:48:50.920 align:start position:0%
any of the property how are they
 
00:48:53.309 --> 00:48:53.319 align:start position:0%
affected by this bill you come home the
 
00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
cruised thing you come home there's
 
00:48:57.789 --> 00:48:57.799 align:start position:0%
somebody in your house MH and you don't
 
00:49:00.150 --> 00:49:00.160 align:start position:0%
rent out any rooms how how does this
 
00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
Bill affect that situation um I don't
 
00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:05.200 align:start position:0%
think that this bill applies to that
 
00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
situation I think that situation would
 
00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
be addressed criminally through a a
 
00:49:11.829 --> 00:49:11.839 align:start position:0%
being charged with criminal
 
00:49:15.349 --> 00:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:18.510 --> 00:49:18.520 align:start position:0%
you representative Su thank you and
 
00:49:21.470 --> 00:49:21.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I'm I'm
 
00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
curious too thinking about that people
 
00:49:25.870 --> 00:49:25.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes have people move in with them
 
00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
who wouldn't be on a Le Le for example
 
00:49:30.109 --> 00:49:30.119 align:start position:0%
it might be a romantic relationship that
 
00:49:32.589 --> 00:49:32.599 align:start position:0%
goes arai and sometimes becomes a
 
00:49:33.990 --> 00:49:34.000 align:start position:0%
domestic violence
 
00:49:36.190 --> 00:49:36.200 align:start position:0%
situation um where someone could then
 
00:49:39.069 --> 00:49:39.079 align:start position:0%
say you know this person is not allowed
 
00:49:42.270 --> 00:49:42.280 align:start position:0%
to live here um would would this bill
 
00:49:44.990 --> 00:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
then put the victim of the domestic
 
00:49:48.670 --> 00:49:48.680 align:start position:0%
violence at additional risk of being so
 
00:49:51.390 --> 00:49:51.400 align:start position:0%
that trying to understand yes so the the
 
00:49:54.829 --> 00:49:54.839 align:start position:0%
relation between uh a person who is a
 
00:49:56.309 --> 00:49:56.319 align:start position:0%
survivor of domestic violence and is
 
00:49:57.750 --> 00:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
living with the perpetrator of that
 
00:49:59.750 --> 00:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
violence is a little bit complex and
 
00:50:02.950 --> 00:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
Depends partially on um who is on that
 
00:50:05.270 --> 00:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
lease so or one of them might be the
 
00:50:08.069 --> 00:50:08.079 align:start position:0%
homeowner right so in a circumstance
 
00:50:12.190 --> 00:50:12.200 align:start position:0%
where a survivor of domestic violence um
 
00:50:14.349 --> 00:50:14.359 align:start position:0%
get so a survivor of domestic violence
 
00:50:16.670 --> 00:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
can seek a a civil protective order
 
00:50:18.750 --> 00:50:18.760 align:start position:0%
under the statute RSA
 
00:50:21.150 --> 00:50:21.160 align:start position:0%
173b in that protective order they can
 
00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
be granted um full access to the home
 
00:50:29.549 --> 00:50:29.559 align:start position:0%
that they shared with the abuser
 
00:50:31.470 --> 00:50:31.480 align:start position:0%
regardless of who owns that home or
 
00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:33.240 align:start position:0%
regardless who is the renter of that
 
00:50:37.630 --> 00:50:37.640 align:start position:0%
home as a protection under the DV
 
00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
statute so this wouldn't apply correct
 
00:50:42.829 --> 00:50:42.839 align:start position:0%
well I I I mean I think that that's
 
00:50:46.069 --> 00:50:46.079 align:start position:0%
that's an open question is um we don't
 
00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
fully know I don't think exactly how
 
00:50:50.270 --> 00:50:50.280 align:start position:0%
everything would be swept up in this
 
00:50:52.470 --> 00:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
bill I think that one of the problems
 
00:50:55.109 --> 00:50:55.119 align:start position:0%
with using such an expeditious process
 
00:50:57.430 --> 00:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
is that it's difficult to to think
 
00:51:00.069 --> 00:51:00.079 align:start position:0%
through all of the impacts that a
 
00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
proposed law may have
 
00:51:06.109 --> 00:51:06.119 align:start position:0%
um it can be surprising at times to find
 
00:51:08.109 --> 00:51:08.119 align:start position:0%
out the impacts that a law that has been
 
00:51:12.069 --> 00:51:12.079 align:start position:0%
in place for a long time can have um and
 
00:51:15.390 --> 00:51:15.400 align:start position:0%
so I think that I don't feel I can I can
 
00:51:18.630 --> 00:51:18.640 align:start position:0%
fully answer that question um beyond
 
00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:20.240 align:start position:0%
what I've just said and I think the fact
 
00:51:22.270 --> 00:51:22.280 align:start position:0%
that I can't fully answer that question
 
00:51:24.510 --> 00:51:24.520 align:start position:0%
beyond what I've just said is further
 
00:51:27.750 --> 00:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
indication of the problem with trying to
 
00:51:31.789 --> 00:51:31.799 align:start position:0%
rush um an amendment or a bill such as
 
00:51:35.230 --> 00:51:35.240 align:start position:0%
this representative n thank you madam
 
00:51:36.309 --> 00:51:36.319 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:51:38.670 --> 00:51:38.680 align:start position:0%
question sure I think um I think
 
00:51:40.670 --> 00:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
actually you you kind of just hit on
 
00:51:42.069 --> 00:51:42.079 align:start position:0%
what I was thinking about is the the
 
00:51:45.069 --> 00:51:45.079 align:start position:0%
idea of um this being uh the difference
 
00:51:48.030 --> 00:51:48.040 align:start position:0%
of between a criminal or a civil process
 
00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:51.480 align:start position:0%
and how that um what that entails why it
 
00:51:54.349 --> 00:51:54.359 align:start position:0%
is set up to be a civil matter and what
 
00:51:57.670 --> 00:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
the implications would be of um of
 
00:52:00.030 --> 00:52:00.040 align:start position:0%
essentially putting law enforcement um
 
00:52:03.829 --> 00:52:03.839 align:start position:0%
in the in the position of um of of
 
00:52:06.390 --> 00:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
making that decision right um and I
 
00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
guess kind of you you kind of already
 
00:52:09.349 --> 00:52:09.359 align:start position:0%
answered my question in saying that
 
00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
there are so there are a variety of
 
00:52:13.470 --> 00:52:13.480 align:start position:0%
implications coming from that um that we
 
00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:14.710 align:start position:0%
implications coming from that um that we
can't

00:52:14.710 --> 00:52:14.720 align:start position:0%
can't
 
00:52:16.589 --> 00:52:16.599 align:start position:0%
necessarily I'm trying to I'm trying to
 
00:52:17.950 --> 00:52:17.960 align:start position:0%
get it back to a question because you
 
00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:20.270 align:start position:0%
get it back to a question because you
kind

00:52:20.270 --> 00:52:20.280 align:start position:0%
kind
 
00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:22.480 align:start position:0%
aome because my question was going to be
 
00:52:24.750 --> 00:52:24.760 align:start position:0%
could you speak to uh the potential
 
00:52:26.950 --> 00:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
implications um that this could entail
 
00:52:28.190 --> 00:52:28.200 align:start position:0%
so if you want to elaborate on that a
 
00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
little bit more that would be wonderful
 
00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I just want to make sure I
 
00:52:32.710 --> 00:52:32.720 align:start position:0%
understand so you're asking what are the
 
00:52:36.430 --> 00:52:36.440 align:start position:0%
potential consequences of criminalizing
 
00:52:38.990 --> 00:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
uh civil matter and involving the police
 
00:52:42.510 --> 00:52:42.520 align:start position:0%
in that matter okay so I think that any
 
00:52:45.549 --> 00:52:45.559 align:start position:0%
time Police become involved in a civil
 
00:52:48.430 --> 00:52:48.440 align:start position:0%
matter it heightens anxiety and creates
 
00:52:50.349 --> 00:52:50.359 align:start position:0%
a situation where people may behave in
 
00:52:52.510 --> 00:52:52.520 align:start position:0%
ways that they ordinarily may not
 
00:52:54.829 --> 00:52:54.839 align:start position:0%
especially when they feel that something
 
00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
that they have a great need for is at
 
00:52:58.990 --> 00:52:59.000 align:start position:0%
risk which is in this case would be
 
00:53:00.309 --> 00:53:00.319 align:start position:0%
housing which is one of our most
 
00:53:01.990 --> 00:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
fundamental needs shelter is one of our
 
00:53:04.630 --> 00:53:04.640 align:start position:0%
most fundamental needs the other issue
 
00:53:06.510 --> 00:53:06.520 align:start position:0%
so I think that it often times will
 
00:53:09.829 --> 00:53:09.839 align:start position:0%
create behaviors that are escalated that
 
00:53:12.990 --> 00:53:13.000 align:start position:0%
would not need be um separate and apart
 
00:53:14.549 --> 00:53:14.559 align:start position:0%
from that and from a more legal
 
00:53:17.470 --> 00:53:17.480 align:start position:0%
perspective it PE puts people at risk of
 
00:53:19.950 --> 00:53:19.960 align:start position:0%
of being charged criminally and prot and
 
00:53:24.670 --> 00:53:24.680 align:start position:0%
potentially convicted of a crime um when
 
00:53:26.630 --> 00:53:26.640 align:start position:0%
they that was not their that was not
 
00:53:30.349 --> 00:53:30.359 align:start position:0%
intent so for most crimes their elements
 
00:53:32.710 --> 00:53:32.720 align:start position:0%
must be met and for most of them men's
 
00:53:36.789 --> 00:53:36.799 align:start position:0%
rehea so intent is one of them um and in
 
00:53:38.950 --> 00:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
circumstances where a person is not
 
00:53:41.549 --> 00:53:41.559 align:start position:0%
intending to commit a crime but is in
 
00:53:45.309 --> 00:53:45.319 align:start position:0%
fact prosecuted um and convicted of that
 
00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:47.640 align:start position:0%
crime that goes on their record and then
 
00:53:49.270 --> 00:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
they have a criminal record and that
 
00:53:51.349 --> 00:53:51.359 align:start position:0%
makes it even more difficult to get
 
00:53:53.150 --> 00:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
housing in the future to get any number
 
00:53:54.910 --> 00:53:54.920 align:start position:0%
of things in the future makes it
 
00:53:56.750 --> 00:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
particularly difficult if a person is
 
00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
seeking some kind of rental subsidy um
 
00:54:04.109 --> 00:54:04.119 align:start position:0%
which often are the very people who are
 
00:54:06.829 --> 00:54:06.839 align:start position:0%
living in situations um where
 
00:54:08.789 --> 00:54:08.799 align:start position:0%
potentially they don't have a direct
 
00:54:10.870 --> 00:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
agreement with the landlord to stay
 
00:54:14.190 --> 00:54:14.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:18.910 --> 00:54:18.920 align:start position:0%
go representative Newman yes thank you
 
00:54:21.910 --> 00:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
in your capacity for dealing with all of
 
00:54:25.069 --> 00:54:25.079 align:start position:0%
this in your experience have you seen an
 
00:54:29.630 --> 00:54:29.640 align:start position:0%
assortment of lease is themselves and I
 
00:54:32.670 --> 00:54:32.680 align:start position:0%
I would expect that some are much better
 
00:54:35.069 --> 00:54:35.079 align:start position:0%
written than others yeah I've I've been
 
00:54:37.870 --> 00:54:37.880 align:start position:0%
practicing housing law for seven years
 
00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
um I've seen quite a few leases um it is
 
00:54:43.349 --> 00:54:43.359 align:start position:0%
absolutely true that some are I I don't
 
00:54:45.230 --> 00:54:45.240 align:start position:0%
know if it's better or worse some are
 
00:54:47.950 --> 00:54:47.960 align:start position:0%
written with many more terms than others
 
00:54:49.829 --> 00:54:49.839 align:start position:0%
some are written with much more clear
 
00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:52.799 align:start position:0%
Provisions than others um some are not
 
00:54:55.030 --> 00:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
written right so there are lease there
 
00:54:57.390 --> 00:54:57.400 align:start position:0%
there are tency agreements that are oral
 
00:54:59.109 --> 00:54:59.119 align:start position:0%
but there are many things that a
 
00:55:00.829 --> 00:55:00.839 align:start position:0%
landlord could write into a lease that
 
00:55:02.990 --> 00:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
would accomplish the objectives that it
 
00:55:06.630 --> 00:55:06.640 align:start position:0%
seems this is this is trying to
 
00:55:10.150 --> 00:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
yes Qui just a quick followup
 
00:55:13.670 --> 00:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
um this is a question poorly
 
00:55:17.069 --> 00:55:17.079 align:start position:0%
phrased in in the leases I'm familiar
 
00:55:19.230 --> 00:55:19.240 align:start position:0%
with I don't know if it's still current
 
00:55:21.950 --> 00:55:21.960 align:start position:0%
or not but the former real um the
 
00:55:24.630 --> 00:55:24.640 align:start position:0%
Realtors had a standard lease agreement
 
00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
that would be used and I believe
 
00:55:30.630 --> 00:55:30.640 align:start position:0%
in there it was addressed number of
 
00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
occupants you had the name so the
 
00:55:35.950 --> 00:55:35.960 align:start position:0%
landlord could vet the people coming in
 
00:55:38.510 --> 00:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
I believe there were also Provisions for
 
00:55:40.829 --> 00:55:40.839 align:start position:0%
guests how long they could stay and
 
00:55:42.710 --> 00:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
there probably was something in there
 
00:55:45.789 --> 00:55:45.799 align:start position:0%
about no subletting in in there would
 
00:55:48.150 --> 00:55:48.160 align:start position:0%
would that be something yes I would say
 
00:55:50.069 --> 00:55:50.079 align:start position:0%
that the large majority of leases that I
 
00:55:54.549 --> 00:55:54.559 align:start position:0%
see have no subletting Provisions um and
 
00:55:56.349 --> 00:55:56.359 align:start position:0%
what you've described is accurate I
 
00:55:58.069 --> 00:55:58.079 align:start position:0%
think that the one exception for when
 
00:56:00.109 --> 00:56:00.119 align:start position:0%
names may not be on a lease is sometimes
 
00:56:03.190 --> 00:56:03.200 align:start position:0%
children are not named on leases so they
 
00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
may have the number of children and the
 
00:56:06.750 --> 00:56:06.760 align:start position:0%
ages of the children but not the names
 
00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:10.829 align:start position:0%
ages of the children but not the names
of

00:56:10.829 --> 00:56:10.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:13.109 --> 00:56:13.119 align:start position:0%
children representative
 
00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
scitec um uh Madam chair do you know
 
00:56:17.870 --> 00:56:17.880 align:start position:0%
where this bill is going is there going

this time represent I have about 30 to
 
00:56:29.230 --> 00:56:29.240 align:start position:0%
40 questions all right well that's a
 
00:56:31.829 --> 00:56:31.839 align:start position:0%
good place to keep them thank you very
 
00:56:40.789 --> 00:56:40.799 align:start position:0%

question

00:56:53.230 --> 00:56:53.240 align:start position:0%

Property

00:57:32.670 --> 00:57:32.680 align:start position:0%
Property
 
00:57:35.190 --> 00:57:35.200 align:start position:0%
Management uh landling you could say for
 
00:57:39.510 --> 00:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
about 35 years we've been very active
 
00:57:42.630 --> 00:57:42.640 align:start position:0%
and my core team on this
 
00:57:46.750 --> 00:57:46.760 align:start position:0%
particular issue I sent an email to you
 
00:57:49.390 --> 00:57:49.400 align:start position:0%
previously last week and I sent one very
 
00:57:51.230 --> 00:57:51.240 align:start position:0%
early in the morning when I was finally
 
00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
getting through with you know pulling
 
00:57:56.430 --> 00:57:56.440 align:start position:0%
all together the pieces so you have that
 
00:57:58.870 --> 00:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
there's been even yet some some
 
00:58:00.670 --> 00:58:00.680 align:start position:0%
additional changes which I'm going to
 
00:58:04.390 --> 00:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
pass out to you in my proposed amendment
 
00:58:06.349 --> 00:58:06.359 align:start position:0%
I have been talking with Elliot Barry
 
00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
and Kristen of the New Hampshire legal
 
00:58:10.870 --> 00:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
assistance we're prepared to present to
 
00:58:14.829 --> 00:58:14.839 align:start position:0%
you um some ideas that will make this
 
00:58:19.470 --> 00:58:19.480 align:start position:0%
work in a way that um well it could make
 
00:58:22.069 --> 00:58:22.079 align:start position:0%
it work so I'm going to pass that out to
 
00:58:26.109 --> 00:58:26.119 align:start position:0%
you when I I finish I invite questions
 
00:58:29.549 --> 00:58:29.559 align:start position:0%
particularly many questions this is a
 
00:58:32.630 --> 00:58:32.640 align:start position:0%
very complex issue anytime you start to
 
00:58:35.589 --> 00:58:35.599 align:start position:0%
work with changing landlord tenant law
 
00:58:39.309 --> 00:58:39.319 align:start position:0%
and real estate law is complex there's
 
00:58:41.349 --> 00:58:41.359 align:start position:0%
many many scenarios you've heard many
 
00:58:44.430 --> 00:58:44.440 align:start position:0%
different scenarios that have come up so
 
00:58:45.910 --> 00:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
when you're putting together a law you
 
00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
need to make sure that you're addressing
 
00:58:49.029 --> 00:58:49.039 align:start position:0%
all those different scenarios and you're
 
00:58:51.109 --> 00:58:51.119 align:start position:0%
doing in responsible way that doesn't
 
00:58:54.710 --> 00:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
have tremendous unint unintended
 
00:58:57.710 --> 00:58:57.720 align:start position:0%
consequences so first the bill the
 
00:59:01.390 --> 00:59:01.400 align:start position:0%
amendment as it's written has some
 
00:59:02.910 --> 00:59:02.920 align:start position:0%
several major
 
00:59:05.710 --> 00:59:05.720 align:start position:0%
concerns uh first of all it's good that
 
00:59:08.349 --> 00:59:08.359 align:start position:0%
we're addressing squatting that's an
 
00:59:10.789 --> 00:59:10.799 align:start position:0%
issue we need to address it it happens
 
00:59:13.230 --> 00:59:13.240 align:start position:0%
for people that own their homes and are
 
00:59:15.230 --> 00:59:15.240 align:start position:0%
not renting it happens for people that
 
00:59:16.950 --> 00:59:16.960 align:start position:0%
are owning property and they're renting
 
00:59:20.589 --> 00:59:20.599 align:start position:0%
it out so we do need to address
 
00:59:26.349 --> 00:59:26.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
some of the concerns are that there's in
 
00:59:32.470 --> 00:59:32.480 align:start position:0%
this bill solicited some proofs of what
 
00:59:35.630 --> 00:59:35.640 align:start position:0%
would conate a proof of a residence but
 
00:59:38.510 --> 00:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
uh most many of those could easily be
 
00:59:41.430 --> 00:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
falsified utility bills for instance I
 
00:59:43.109 --> 00:59:43.119 align:start position:0%
have a tenant move into a property
 
00:59:45.630 --> 00:59:45.640 align:start position:0%
routinely practically every time and
 
00:59:47.630 --> 00:59:47.640 align:start position:0%
they turn on the utilities without ever
 
00:59:49.710 --> 00:59:49.720 align:start position:0%
Consulting me the utility company just
 
00:59:52.630 --> 00:59:52.640 align:start position:0%
turns them on so having a proof of
 
00:59:55.870 --> 00:59:55.880 align:start position:0%
service like that would would be uh I
 
00:59:58.789 --> 00:59:58.799 align:start position:0%
would I would say not sufficient to
 
00:59:58.799 --> 01:00:00.230 align:start position:0%
would I would say not sufficient to
prove

01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
prove
 
01:00:02.910 --> 01:00:02.920 align:start position:0%
residency same with there's a language
 
01:00:05.230 --> 01:00:05.240 align:start position:0%
in there that says other services but
 
01:00:07.950 --> 01:00:07.960 align:start position:0%
it's not defined what is another service
 
01:00:09.230 --> 01:00:09.240 align:start position:0%
a laundry
 
01:00:12.390 --> 01:00:12.400 align:start position:0%
service um also is listed as approve
 
01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:13.990 align:start position:0%
service um also is listed as approve
government

01:00:13.990 --> 01:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:00:17.630 --> 01:00:17.640 align:start position:0%
ID but it's not defined what kind of ID
 
01:00:20.190 --> 01:00:20.200 align:start position:0%
does it actually specify an address and
 
01:00:22.710 --> 01:00:22.720 align:start position:0%
we know that government IDs can be
 
01:00:25.710 --> 01:00:25.720 align:start position:0%
falsified so I think that those are not
 
01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:26.789 align:start position:0%
falsified so I think that those are not
good

01:00:26.789 --> 01:00:26.799 align:start position:0%
good
 
01:00:28.789 --> 01:00:28.799 align:start position:0%
uh sufficient
 
01:00:31.750 --> 01:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
proofs uh it shouldn't be that the
 
01:00:34.510 --> 01:00:34.520 align:start position:0%
housing provider is at risk of someone
 
01:00:36.990 --> 01:00:37.000 align:start position:0%
squatting because a utility company or a
 
01:00:39.430 --> 01:00:39.440 align:start position:0%
government ID or some other service has
 
01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:40.670 align:start position:0%
government ID or some other service has
a

01:00:40.670 --> 01:00:40.680 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:00:43.870 --> 01:00:43.880 align:start position:0%
loose uh requirement for establishing
 
01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:45.910 align:start position:0%
loose uh requirement for establishing
the

01:00:45.910 --> 01:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:00:48.549 --> 01:00:48.559 align:start position:0%
service uh I also think it would be a
 
01:00:51.230 --> 01:00:51.240 align:start position:0%
mistake for the legislature to get too
 
01:00:53.109 --> 01:00:53.119 align:start position:0%
heavily involved in
 
01:00:56.710 --> 01:00:56.720 align:start position:0%
defining the various proofs that that
 
01:01:00.029 --> 01:01:00.039 align:start position:0%
really should be something in the the
 
01:01:03.510 --> 01:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
court I also think that in general we
 
01:01:06.190 --> 01:01:06.200 align:start position:0%
should get rid of the idea there seems
 
01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
to be a presumption that someone
 
01:01:10.309 --> 01:01:10.319 align:start position:0%
occupying a property has to go through
 
01:01:11.870 --> 01:01:11.880 align:start position:0%
the eviction
 
01:01:14.309 --> 01:01:14.319 align:start position:0%
process um I think there should be some
 
01:01:14.319 --> 01:01:15.230 align:start position:0%
process um I think there should be some
due

01:01:15.230 --> 01:01:15.240 align:start position:0%
due
 
01:01:19.029 --> 01:01:19.039 align:start position:0%
process um and one of the things that
 
01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:21.720 align:start position:0%
was mentioned is about sheriffs and
 
01:01:24.430 --> 01:01:24.440 align:start position:0%
police police in particular I can tell
 
01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
you from the years of experience that
 
01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
that I have and the the uh input that I
 
01:01:31.950 --> 01:01:31.960 align:start position:0%
get from our members we distribute
 
01:01:34.510 --> 01:01:34.520 align:start position:0%
legislative updates to about
 
01:01:37.029 --> 01:01:37.039 align:start position:0%
3500 recipients around the state of New
 
01:01:38.870 --> 01:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire landlords across the entire
 
01:01:42.510 --> 01:01:42.520 align:start position:0%
state every week um police typically
 
01:01:45.430 --> 01:01:45.440 align:start position:0%
will not get involved in removing
 
01:01:48.150 --> 01:01:48.160 align:start position:0%
someone that's illegally in an
 
01:01:51.269 --> 01:01:51.279 align:start position:0%
apartment you go to them and say that
 
01:01:54.549 --> 01:01:54.559 align:start position:0%
here's proof that they're not legally
 
01:01:57.230 --> 01:01:57.240 align:start position:0%
able to or should be there the police
 
01:01:59.630 --> 01:01:59.640 align:start position:0%
typically won't touch it they say I'm
 
01:02:02.589 --> 01:02:02.599 align:start position:0%
sorry that's a civil matter even though
 
01:02:03.950 --> 01:02:03.960 align:start position:0%
perhaps it does look like they're
 
01:02:06.150 --> 01:02:06.160 align:start position:0%
trespassing so then when you get into
 
01:02:07.670 --> 01:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
that situation they'll say you need to
 
01:02:10.109 --> 01:02:10.119 align:start position:0%
go evict them someone asked about the
 
01:02:11.950 --> 01:02:11.960 align:start position:0%
length of the eviction
 
01:02:14.910 --> 01:02:14.920 align:start position:0%
process that I can review my notes right
 
01:02:17.029 --> 01:02:17.039 align:start position:0%
here I can tell you about the eviction
 
01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
process it can
 
01:02:22.549 --> 01:02:22.559 align:start position:0%
take typically about six to eight weeks
 
01:02:26.549 --> 01:02:26.559 align:start position:0%
to get someone out on the shortest um
 
01:02:29.470 --> 01:02:29.480 align:start position:0%
eviction process with other Provisions
 
01:02:32.309 --> 01:02:32.319 align:start position:0%
in the law can take up to 169 days with
 
01:02:35.269 --> 01:02:35.279 align:start position:0%
appeals it can be a year or longer so I
 
01:02:40.109 --> 01:02:40.119 align:start position:0%
mean just it's just un tenable to to go
 
01:02:41.470 --> 01:02:41.480 align:start position:0%
through eviction process for someone
 
01:02:44.829 --> 01:02:44.839 align:start position:0%
that has no right to be there
 
01:02:47.910 --> 01:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
however as much as Property Owners would
 
01:02:51.109 --> 01:02:51.119 align:start position:0%
like to see in a quick and judic and
 
01:02:54.309 --> 01:02:54.319 align:start position:0%
expedient process to get a squatter out
 
01:02:56.710 --> 01:02:56.720 align:start position:0%
it would be against the
 
01:02:58.910 --> 01:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
Constitution of the United States 5ifth
 
01:03:03.829 --> 01:03:03.839 align:start position:0%
and 14th amendments to deny someone due
 
01:03:09.309 --> 01:03:09.319 align:start position:0%
process or something that removes their
 
01:03:11.309 --> 01:03:11.319 align:start position:0%
deprives them of life liberty and
 
01:03:11.319 --> 01:03:13.069 align:start position:0%
deprives them of life liberty and
property

01:03:13.069 --> 01:03:13.079 align:start position:0%
property
 
01:03:18.549 --> 01:03:18.559 align:start position:0%
and so you have to have some kind of a
 
01:03:22.190 --> 01:03:22.200 align:start position:0%
due process now we can make that due
 
01:03:25.470 --> 01:03:25.480 align:start position:0%
process very expedient and that is what
 
01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:26.870 align:start position:0%
process very expedient and that is what
Chris

01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
Chris
 
01:03:30.109 --> 01:03:30.119 align:start position:0%
has just referred to and Elliot and I
 
01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
are working together in in my proposal
 
01:03:35.470 --> 01:03:35.480 align:start position:0%
that I'll give to you there's a process
 
01:03:39.630 --> 01:03:39.640 align:start position:0%
that's Loosely called the 540A petition
 
01:03:42.029 --> 01:03:42.039 align:start position:0%
in landlord tenant law it's already
 
01:03:45.630 --> 01:03:45.640 align:start position:0%
written in the law it has a very large
 
01:03:49.150 --> 01:03:49.160 align:start position:0%
amount of vetting for years and years to
 
01:03:51.789 --> 01:03:51.799 align:start position:0%
create a a good
 
01:03:54.309 --> 01:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
process and it can be expedient and
 
01:03:56.710 --> 01:03:56.720 align:start position:0%
quick in our propos proposal we would
 
01:03:58.109 --> 01:03:58.119 align:start position:0%
make it two
 
01:04:01.789 --> 01:04:01.799 align:start position:0%
days to go through the process and I
 
01:04:03.990 --> 01:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
believe we've already talked quite a bit
 
01:04:06.190 --> 01:04:06.200 align:start position:0%
that we can come together with something
 
01:04:08.109 --> 01:04:08.119 align:start position:0%
for you on that and I'll be here this
 
01:04:10.670 --> 01:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
afternoon during your exact
 
01:04:14.269 --> 01:04:14.279 align:start position:0%
session there's some other issues with
 
01:04:18.430 --> 01:04:18.440 align:start position:0%
the bill as written I can go into more
 
01:04:20.630 --> 01:04:20.640 align:start position:0%
but what I'd like to do at the risk of
 
01:04:22.430 --> 01:04:22.440 align:start position:0%
taking too much time is go ahead and
 
01:04:23.710 --> 01:04:23.720 align:start position:0%
pass out
 
01:04:30.789 --> 01:04:30.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:40.589 --> 01:04:40.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:43.470 --> 01:04:43.480 align:start position:0%
shortly okay just so the just so the
 
01:04:45.549 --> 01:04:45.559 align:start position:0%
committee is aware this I believe this
 
01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
is an amendment that's being passed out
 
01:04:49.750 --> 01:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
that has not yet been introduced so we
 
01:04:52.390 --> 01:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
will not be discussing any part of this
 
01:04:54.470 --> 01:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
amendment right
 
01:04:57.470 --> 01:04:57.480 align:start position:0%
now okay this is I wouldn't even say
 
01:04:59.950 --> 01:04:59.960 align:start position:0%
it's a Amendment it's a proposal of what
 
01:05:03.069 --> 01:05:03.079 align:start position:0%
could be done to address this situation
 
01:05:06.230 --> 01:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
give due process make it quick and
 
01:05:08.990 --> 01:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
answer pres most of the questions that
 
01:05:34.950 --> 01:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:36.990 align:start position:0%

01:11:30.830 --> 01:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
reopening our public hearing and just
 
01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:31.990 align:start position:0%
reopening our public hearing and just
for

for
 
01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
everybody's you know thought or
 
01:11:35.990 --> 01:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
consideration um I feel like we're kind
 
01:11:37.669 --> 01:11:37.679 align:start position:0%
of gone down a different path of what
 
01:11:40.990 --> 01:11:41.000 align:start position:0%
the bill is that we're addressing we are
 
01:11:44.310 --> 01:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
not here addressing a person that is not
 
01:11:47.149 --> 01:11:47.159 align:start position:0%
paying rent right we're not here talking
 
01:11:49.629 --> 01:11:49.639 align:start position:0%
about um any kind of rental property
 
01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
we're talking about people that have
 
01:11:52.990 --> 01:11:53.000 align:start position:0%
taken possession of
 
01:11:56.510 --> 01:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
property without a lease with without a
 
01:11:58.790 --> 01:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
verbal contract of you know you may live
 
01:12:00.750 --> 01:12:00.760 align:start position:0%
here um so let's just please keep that
 
01:12:05.270 --> 01:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
in mind as we as we continue this um
 
01:12:07.470 --> 01:12:07.480 align:start position:0%
and I'm not really sure what this
 
01:12:11.669 --> 01:12:11.679 align:start position:0%
particular P papers okay so you may
 
01:12:15.830 --> 01:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
continue thank you so the
 
01:12:19.750 --> 01:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
amendment 1647 H as written does address
 
01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:21.470 align:start position:0%
amendment 1647 H as written does address
rental

01:12:21.470 --> 01:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
rental
 
01:12:24.990 --> 01:12:25.000 align:start position:0%
property that's very clear it talks
 
01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:28.110 align:start position:0%
property that's very clear it talks
about

01:12:28.110 --> 01:12:28.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:30.550 --> 01:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
about non-restricted
 
01:12:33.189 --> 01:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
property and non-restricted property
 
01:12:38.629 --> 01:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:42.350 --> 01:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
property um so what we're
 
01:12:45.669 --> 01:12:45.679 align:start position:0%
proposing is we use a process that's
 
01:12:49.149 --> 01:12:49.159 align:start position:0%
already in place called The
 
01:12:52.070 --> 01:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
540A petition and the short version of
 
01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
that would be that the housing provider
 
01:12:56.950 --> 01:12:56.960 align:start position:0%
files a petition that says the occupants
 
01:12:59.350 --> 01:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
are there without
 
01:13:03.350 --> 01:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
permission and that could be uh a
 
01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
homeowner that just owns their home and
 
01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't lease it it could be a landlord
 
01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:09.110 align:start position:0%
doesn't lease it it could be a landlord
either

01:13:09.110 --> 01:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
either
 
01:13:12.990 --> 01:13:13.000 align:start position:0%
one uh stating that the the ents don't
 
01:13:16.110 --> 01:13:16.120 align:start position:0%
have any right there the arents would
 
01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
then need to show evidence like a lease
 
01:13:20.629 --> 01:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
or rental payments or other evidence to
 
01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
prove their residency or owner interest
 
01:13:25.830 --> 01:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
a hearing would be held with in 48
 
01:13:28.790 --> 01:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
business hours the court would rule if
 
01:13:31.390 --> 01:13:31.400 align:start position:0%
the rule if the Court ruled in favor of
 
01:13:35.030 --> 01:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
the owner then the people would be
 
01:13:37.870 --> 01:13:37.880 align:start position:0%
removed uh immediately by law
 
01:13:39.950 --> 01:13:39.960 align:start position:0%
enforcement if the ruling was in favor
 
01:13:42.470 --> 01:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
of the occupants then they would stay
 
01:13:45.709 --> 01:13:45.719 align:start position:0%
and if the owner wanted to pursue
 
01:13:47.070 --> 01:13:47.080 align:start position:0%
further they' have to go through the
 
01:13:49.830 --> 01:13:49.840 align:start position:0%
normal eviction process so it would
 
01:13:53.270 --> 01:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
provide means of due
 
01:13:56.750 --> 01:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
process and it would provide something
 
01:13:56.760 --> 01:13:57.830 align:start position:0%
process and it would provide something
very

01:13:57.830 --> 01:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:14:00.510 --> 01:14:00.520 align:start position:0%
expeditious with the backing of laws
 
01:14:01.790 --> 01:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
already in
 
01:14:04.830 --> 01:14:04.840 align:start position:0%
place I would love to take any
 
01:14:08.709 --> 01:14:08.719 align:start position:0%
questions and I will be here in
 
01:14:11.470 --> 01:14:11.480 align:start position:0%

something together that will work for
all

01:14:27.990 --> 01:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:30.709 --> 01:14:30.719 align:start position:0%
situations so please keep in mind we are
 
01:14:32.790 --> 01:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
not asking questions on the paper that
 
01:14:34.550 --> 01:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
was just handed out this is not language
 
01:14:37.189 --> 01:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:38.950 --> 01:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
introduced do you still have a question
 
01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:40.030 align:start position:0%
introduced do you still have a question
representative

01:14:40.030 --> 01:14:40.040 align:start position:0%

thank you for letting me ask
 
01:14:45.199 --> 01:14:46.750 align:start position:0%
thank you for letting me ask
it

01:14:46.750 --> 01:14:46.760 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:14:51.030 --> 01:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
uh one of the things that you you seem
 
01:14:54.590 --> 01:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
to be saying uh in your testimony is
 
01:14:56.350 --> 01:14:56.360 align:start position:0%
that we we should really be looking at
 
01:14:58.950 --> 01:14:58.960 align:start position:0%
creating a FastTrack process within
 
01:15:02.030 --> 01:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
existing to creating a separate uh
 
01:15:04.590 --> 01:15:04.600 align:start position:0%
criminal process is that kind of a short
 
01:15:06.990 --> 01:15:07.000 align:start position:0%
way to describe what what you're
 
01:15:10.350 --> 01:15:10.360 align:start position:0%
suggesting yes okay yeah thank
 
01:15:13.750 --> 01:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
you I have a point of order yes
 
01:15:15.950 --> 01:15:15.960 align:start position:0%
representative the point of order is you
 
01:15:18.030 --> 01:15:18.040 align:start position:0%
you you say this is an amendment it's
 
01:15:20.070 --> 01:15:20.080 align:start position:0%
not an amendment it's testimony from the
 
01:15:23.070 --> 01:15:23.080 align:start position:0%
person here and it gives information on
 
01:15:25.030 --> 01:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
what it has I have questions about do
 
01:15:27.149 --> 01:15:27.159 align:start position:0%
process and I look at this and there is
 
01:15:31.470 --> 01:15:31.480 align:start position:0%
one section of it that gives a a a valid
 
01:15:33.950 --> 01:15:33.960 align:start position:0%
way to make this bill bet make this
 
01:15:36.270 --> 01:15:36.280 align:start position:0%
amendment better to have it done in one
 
01:15:38.510 --> 01:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
or two days and I think that we probably
 
01:15:40.310 --> 01:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
have the right to ask questions about
 
01:15:42.470 --> 01:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
testimony so I want to leave it at that
 
01:15:44.709 --> 01:15:44.719 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:15:46.750 --> 01:15:46.760 align:start position:0%

Madam acting chairman I suppose wor um
 
01:16:15.430 --> 01:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Elliot Barry
 
01:16:19.070 --> 01:16:19.080 align:start position:0%
i' I too had the opportunity to testify
 
01:16:21.870 --> 01:16:21.880 align:start position:0%
before you last time just to remind you
 
01:16:24.110 --> 01:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
or for people who haven't uh who weren't
 
01:16:27.669 --> 01:16:27.679 align:start position:0%
here uh uh I have represented tenants in
 
01:16:29.669 --> 01:16:29.679 align:start position:0%
at at New Hampshire legal assistance for
 
01:16:33.390 --> 01:16:33.400 align:start position:0%
47 years before my retirement um I'm not
 
01:16:35.669 --> 01:16:35.679 align:start position:0%
going to repeat a lot of what my former
 
01:16:39.390 --> 01:16:39.400 align:start position:0%
colleague Kirsten Cornell testified to I
 
01:16:41.910 --> 01:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
just want to emphasize that what the
 
01:16:45.430 --> 01:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
bill does and my major problem problem
 
01:16:49.030 --> 01:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
with it is two things number one it
 
01:16:53.790 --> 01:16:53.800 align:start position:0%
makes the police the judge in the case
 
01:16:56.350 --> 01:16:56.360 align:start position:0%
rather than a
 
01:17:00.790 --> 01:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
judge number two the only way that the
 
01:17:03.709 --> 01:17:03.719 align:start position:0%
tenant or the alleged tenant gets to
 
01:17:07.149 --> 01:17:07.159 align:start position:0%
tell his or her side to to of the story
 
01:17:10.470 --> 01:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
to a neutral decision maker is in
 
01:17:13.030 --> 01:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
defending a criminal
 
01:17:15.950 --> 01:17:15.960 align:start position:0%
prosecution even if he or she is willing
 
01:17:19.750 --> 01:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
to take that chance and many won't be
 
01:17:23.550 --> 01:17:23.560 align:start position:0%
even if they do many applications for
 
01:17:27.310 --> 01:17:27.320 align:start position:0%
whether it's tency or a job will ask
 
01:17:29.870 --> 01:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
have you ever been
 
01:17:32.550 --> 01:17:32.560 align:start position:0%
arrested what's the answer and they
 
01:17:34.790 --> 01:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
could have had a very legitimate claim
 
01:17:36.790 --> 01:17:36.800 align:start position:0%
to be where they
 
01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
are most importantly I want to say that
 
01:17:45.149 --> 01:17:45.159 align:start position:0%
I very much agree with Nick Norman there
 
01:17:48.669 --> 01:17:48.679 align:start position:0%
is an existing statute RSA
 
01:17:51.229 --> 01:17:51.239 align:start position:0%
54a which I have been involved with
 
01:17:54.550 --> 01:17:54.560 align:start position:0%
hundreds of times that provides a very
 
01:17:57.390 --> 01:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
almost most immediate access for the off
 
01:18:00.110 --> 01:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
offending party the plaintiff to get
 
01:18:02.790 --> 01:18:02.800 align:start position:0%
before the court and get an immediate or
 
01:18:05.310 --> 01:18:05.320 align:start position:0%
temporary order which is followed up by
 
01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
a final order and is enforceable by
 
01:18:11.510 --> 01:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
contempt of the powers of contempt of
 
01:18:14.910 --> 01:18:14.920 align:start position:0%
court that is 540A I don't need I drew
 
01:18:16.669 --> 01:18:16.679 align:start position:0%
up an amendment and this is really
 
01:18:19.189 --> 01:18:19.199 align:start position:0%
interesting I mean obviously I'm not
 
01:18:21.750 --> 01:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
legislative Services I have it if you
 
01:18:25.070 --> 01:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
want it but remarkable thing about it is
 
01:18:26.750 --> 01:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
that acting
 
01:18:30.310 --> 01:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
independently my version is quite
 
01:18:34.149 --> 01:18:34.159 align:start position:0%
similar to what Nick Norman did using
 
01:18:37.550 --> 01:18:37.560 align:start position:0%
the existing process with the only
 
01:18:41.110 --> 01:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
possibility of criminal prosecution
 
01:18:43.910 --> 01:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
would be contempt of court if after a
 
01:18:47.070 --> 01:18:47.080 align:start position:0%
hearing the So-Cal the alleged tenant
 
01:18:50.510 --> 01:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
refuses to comply with the legitimate
 
01:18:52.189 --> 01:18:52.199 align:start position:0%
order of the
 
01:18:55.750 --> 01:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
Court um
 
01:18:58.669 --> 01:18:58.679 align:start position:0%
oh just one other thing the scenario
 
01:19:01.550 --> 01:19:01.560 align:start position:0%
where you go on vacation you come home
 
01:19:04.350 --> 01:19:04.360 align:start position:0%
to your house and somebody is living in
 
01:19:06.950 --> 01:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
there if that isn't Criminal Trespass I
 
01:19:09.189 --> 01:19:09.199 align:start position:0%
don't know what is and I agree with Nick
 
01:19:11.709 --> 01:19:11.719 align:start position:0%
that there are plenty of fuzzy cases
 
01:19:15.110 --> 01:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
espe in the apartment context where the
 
01:19:17.430 --> 01:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
police may say this looks kind of more
 
01:19:19.189 --> 01:19:19.199 align:start position:0%
appropriate for eviction than it does
 
01:19:21.390 --> 01:19:21.400 align:start position:0%
for Criminal Trespass
 
01:19:25.510 --> 01:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
but I cannot believe that there are is
 
01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
any significant number of cases where
 
01:19:29.629 --> 01:19:29.639 align:start position:0%
the police have refused to remove
 
01:19:32.310 --> 01:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
somebody from a single family home when
 
01:19:36.149 --> 01:19:36.159 align:start position:0%
it you know returning from a vacation um
 
01:19:37.709 --> 01:19:37.719 align:start position:0%
that's my testimony I'd be happy to
 
01:19:39.950 --> 01:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
answer any questions but if you give us
 
01:19:43.110 --> 01:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
the time and that we don't need a lot of
 
01:19:46.910 --> 01:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
time I am very confident that Mr Norman
 
01:19:50.189 --> 01:19:50.199 align:start position:0%
and the landlords he represents and Miss
 
01:19:51.550 --> 01:19:51.560 align:start position:0%
Cornell and New Hampshire legal
 
01:19:53.830 --> 01:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
assistance and I can work out something
 
01:19:56.149 --> 01:19:56.159 align:start position:0%
that will make a civil a fair civil
 
01:19:59.510 --> 01:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
process that's fast and comports with
 
01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:07.390 align:start position:0%
process that's fast and comports with
due

01:20:07.390 --> 01:20:07.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:10.750 --> 01:20:10.760 align:start position:0%
process thank you madam chair um the
 
01:20:12.790 --> 01:20:12.800 align:start position:0%
information that you have did you make
 
01:20:14.950 --> 01:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
copies of it yeah I have it like are you
 
01:20:16.470 --> 01:20:16.480 align:start position:0%
going to pass that out for if you like
 
01:20:18.189 --> 01:20:18.199 align:start position:0%
thank you I don't want to swamp you with
 
01:20:21.030 --> 01:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
papers especially it's not but again I
 
01:20:22.510 --> 01:20:22.520 align:start position:0%
understand it's not an amendment it's
 
01:20:25.270 --> 01:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
something to think about if you were you
 
01:20:30.510 --> 01:20:30.520 align:start position:0%
gave 247 thank you madam
 
01:20:39.910 --> 01:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:44.110 --> 01:20:44.120 align:start position:0%
wait so does your proposed
 
01:20:47.189 --> 01:20:47.199 align:start position:0%
information uh have an immediate
 
01:20:50.070 --> 01:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
relief um what the way I've written it
 
01:20:53.229 --> 01:20:53.239 align:start position:0%
and it's subject to negotiation the the
 
01:20:56.189 --> 01:20:56.199 align:start position:0%
land the owner of the property would
 
01:20:59.470 --> 01:20:59.480 align:start position:0%
provide a a notice saying get out in 3
 
01:21:04.270 --> 01:21:04.280 align:start position:0%
days uh and if they don't uh if they
 
01:21:06.709 --> 01:21:06.719 align:start position:0%
either leave or then the landlord files
 
01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
a petition in which an order could be
 
01:21:11.510 --> 01:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
granted that day a temporary order and
 
01:21:13.070 --> 01:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
that would and the Tenant would have a
 
01:21:15.270 --> 01:21:15.280 align:start position:0%
right to a hearing within 48 working
 
01:21:17.629 --> 01:21:17.639 align:start position:0%
days again which is interesting because
 
01:21:20.550 --> 01:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
Mr Norman and I that provision about a
 
01:21:23.030 --> 01:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
40 a hearing within 48 days of filing
 
01:21:27.950 --> 01:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:32.830 --> 01:21:32.840 align:start position:0%
same hours I'm yeah sorry about that 48
 
01:21:35.270 --> 01:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
Hours follow
 
01:21:39.390 --> 01:21:39.400 align:start position:0%
up so in this scenario right I I have a
 
01:21:41.990 --> 01:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
three story tenament my middle
 
01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.709 align:start position:0%
three story tenament my middle
apartment's

01:21:44.709 --> 01:21:44.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:47.790 --> 01:21:47.800 align:start position:0%
vacant I I bet somebody they go to move
 
01:21:50.950 --> 01:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
in somebody's already
 
01:21:54.270 --> 01:21:54.280 align:start position:0%
there can they be removed when I call
 
01:21:56.350 --> 01:21:56.360 align:start position:0%
the police in your
 
01:21:58.709 --> 01:21:58.719 align:start position:0%
language I think they could be if the
 
01:22:00.550 --> 01:22:00.560 align:start position:0%
police will enforce as I think they
 
01:22:02.870 --> 01:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
probably should Criminal Trespass then
 
01:22:05.870 --> 01:22:05.880 align:start position:0%
they're out in my language um they would
 
01:22:08.750 --> 01:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
have to get some notice to leave and
 
01:22:10.990 --> 01:22:11.000 align:start position:0%
then uh request a hearing to court if
 
01:22:13.070 --> 01:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
they don't want to go but I don't see
 
01:22:14.629 --> 01:22:14.639 align:start position:0%
how you can make the
 
01:22:17.350 --> 01:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
police if they're not willing to there
 
01:22:18.870 --> 01:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
must be some reason the police aren't
 
01:22:20.830 --> 01:22:20.840 align:start position:0%
going to enforce it and if there's not I
 
01:22:22.950 --> 01:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
don't see how you can make in accordance
 
01:22:24.870 --> 01:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
with the process how you can can make
 
01:22:26.590 --> 01:22:26.600 align:start position:0%
the police the
 
01:22:30.790 --> 01:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:32.790 --> 01:22:32.800 align:start position:0%
sense I think the confusion that we're
 
01:22:35.149 --> 01:22:35.159 align:start position:0%
having is because the the due process is
 
01:22:37.709 --> 01:22:37.719 align:start position:0%
the word that keeps on being said and
 
01:22:39.110 --> 01:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
when the bill was introduced by the
 
01:22:42.110 --> 01:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
sponsor he's not he's not talking about
 
01:22:44.830 --> 01:22:44.840 align:start position:0%
people that have a legal right to be
 
01:22:46.790 --> 01:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
there so I think that's where the where
 
01:22:48.950 --> 01:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
we're being confused is saying well you
 
01:22:51.750 --> 01:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
can follow a petition but if the person
 
01:22:54.189 --> 01:22:54.199 align:start position:0%
isn't has no legal basis to be there and
 
01:22:54.199 --> 01:22:55.030 align:start position:0%
isn't has no legal basis to be there and
now

01:22:55.030 --> 01:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:22:56.709 --> 01:22:56.719 align:start position:0%
the person that legally owns the home
 
01:22:59.990 --> 01:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
has to go through a a court process I I
 
01:23:03.669 --> 01:23:03.679 align:start position:0%
actually the yeah a couple things number
 
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
one the question is who has a legal
 
01:23:08.470 --> 01:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
right to be here last time the owner of
 
01:23:10.110 --> 01:23:10.120 align:start position:0%
the property I would have to say well
 
01:23:12.189 --> 01:23:12.199 align:start position:0%
here but here's the problem I talked a
 
01:23:17.229 --> 01:23:17.239 align:start position:0%
lot last time about the the issue of um
 
01:23:20.350 --> 01:23:20.360 align:start position:0%
implied tencies right where a tenant has
 
01:23:22.149 --> 01:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
been there with the no with the
 
01:23:26.189 --> 01:23:26.199 align:start position:0%
knowledge or Ann M that that tenant had
 
01:23:27.830 --> 01:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
a right to be there even though they're
 
01:23:30.189 --> 01:23:30.199 align:start position:0%
not on the lease there are many and then
 
01:23:32.229 --> 01:23:32.239 align:start position:0%
number of tenants have no lease and then
 
01:23:35.070 --> 01:23:35.080 align:start position:0%
they're arguing about is there an oral
 
01:23:37.390 --> 01:23:37.400 align:start position:0%
agreement these are legitimate things
 
01:23:39.030 --> 01:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
that come up often and there's a
 
01:23:40.470 --> 01:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
disagreement whether there's a
 
01:23:43.510 --> 01:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
legitimate or not legitimate tency and
 
01:23:45.470 --> 01:23:45.480 align:start position:0%
somebody besides the police should have
 
01:23:47.629 --> 01:23:47.639 align:start position:0%
to figure that out but if we can get
 
01:23:51.229 --> 01:23:51.239 align:start position:0%
them a hearing within you know within 40
 
01:23:53.390 --> 01:23:53.400 align:start position:0%
48 Hours of the time the tenant asked
 
01:23:54.950 --> 01:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
for it
 
01:23:57.590 --> 01:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
it seems to me then at least a judge is
 
01:23:59.590 --> 01:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
making the decision about whether they
 
01:24:01.669 --> 01:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
do have a legal right to be there if
 
01:24:04.830 --> 01:24:04.840 align:start position:0%
it's Crystal Clear they don't the police
 
01:24:07.790 --> 01:24:07.800 align:start position:0%
ought to be enforcing the criminal uh
 
01:24:10.430 --> 01:24:10.440 align:start position:0%
trespass statute which I have somewhere
 
01:24:14.229 --> 01:24:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:17.669 --> 01:24:17.679 align:start position:0%
clear oh I'm sorry here it is a person
 
01:24:20.629 --> 01:24:20.639 align:start position:0%
is guilty of Criminal Trespass if
 
01:24:22.350 --> 01:24:22.360 align:start position:0%
knowing that he's not licensed or
 
01:24:25.709 --> 01:24:25.719 align:start position:0%
privileged to do so he enters or remains
 
01:24:28.709 --> 01:24:28.719 align:start position:0%
in any place I mean if the police are
 
01:24:31.149 --> 01:24:31.159 align:start position:0%
screwing this up then that's another
 
01:24:34.390 --> 01:24:34.400 align:start position:0%
issue but people ought to have the right
 
01:24:36.669 --> 01:24:36.679 align:start position:0%
to have some
 
01:24:40.629 --> 01:24:40.639 align:start position:0%
judicial referee or judge decide whether
 
01:24:43.430 --> 01:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
their claim of lawful residence is in
 
01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:44.709 align:start position:0%
their claim of lawful residence is in
fact

01:24:44.709 --> 01:24:44.719 align:start position:0%
fact
 
01:24:48.750 --> 01:24:48.760 align:start position:0%
valid representative Manion I got you
 
01:24:50.950 --> 01:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
you're all set representative
 
01:24:53.669 --> 01:24:53.679 align:start position:0%
Newman it seems to me the big problem in
 
01:24:55.790 --> 01:24:55.800 align:start position:0%
this is in the first sentence that's in
 
01:24:55.800 --> 01:24:56.550 align:start position:0%
this is in the first sentence that's in
this

01:24:56.550 --> 01:24:56.560 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:24:59.270 --> 01:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
bill and it says any person who has
 
01:25:01.270 --> 01:25:01.280 align:start position:0%
entered or remained in an OCC within an
 
01:25:03.709 --> 01:25:03.719 align:start position:0%
occupied structure or structure or
 
01:25:06.390 --> 01:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
secured premises in violation of the two
 
01:25:09.310 --> 01:25:09.320 align:start position:0%
laws and who law a law enforcement has
 
01:25:11.590 --> 01:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
probable cause to believe is not a legal
 
01:25:15.149 --> 01:25:15.159 align:start position:0%
occupant so that's where it starts to be
 
01:25:17.109 --> 01:25:17.119 align:start position:0%
a judge so could you the first part of
 
01:25:19.830 --> 01:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
that any person who has enter to remain
 
01:25:23.270 --> 01:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
is that legal or unlegal or I'm just
 
01:25:25.030 --> 01:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
confused by that entire High sentence
 
01:25:27.229 --> 01:25:27.239 align:start position:0%
could you comment on that
 
01:25:32.550 --> 01:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
sentence well I think there is a
 
01:25:35.070 --> 01:25:35.080 align:start position:0%
legitimate uh use of the word have they
 
01:25:37.550 --> 01:25:37.560 align:start position:0%
entered and remained an occupied or
 
01:25:41.510 --> 01:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
secured premises in violation of the of
 
01:25:43.750 --> 01:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
the criminal law stat of the Criminal
 
01:25:46.229 --> 01:25:46.239 align:start position:0%
Trespass statute that's a legitimate
 
01:25:49.590 --> 01:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
sentence right but let let me just point
 
01:25:52.270 --> 01:25:52.280 align:start position:0%
this out the notion of what is probable
 
01:25:56.270 --> 01:25:56.280 align:start position:0%
cause probable cause is all know is is
 
01:25:58.550 --> 01:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
the basis for filing a criminal
 
01:26:01.229 --> 01:26:01.239 align:start position:0%
complaint it's not the basis for
 
01:26:03.990 --> 01:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
deciding that somebody is acting without
 
01:26:06.550 --> 01:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
right and then incarcerating them
 
01:26:08.350 --> 01:26:08.360 align:start position:0%
finding them or in this case kicking
 
01:26:10.590 --> 01:26:10.600 align:start position:0%
them out of their place that probable
 
01:26:13.030 --> 01:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
cause is the beginning of a pro of a
 
01:26:15.830 --> 01:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
legal process that has a legal hearing
 
01:26:19.189 --> 01:26:19.199 align:start position:0%
attached to it and this doesn't do that
 
01:26:20.990 --> 01:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
but I'm sorry I suspected by your I'm
 
01:26:24.390 --> 01:26:24.400 align:start position:0%
not answering your question
 
01:26:26.830 --> 01:26:26.840 align:start position:0%
it was probably a poorly worded question
 
01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
representative scitech well here's
 
01:26:30.149 --> 01:26:30.159 align:start position:0%
another poorly worded question you're
 
01:26:32.950 --> 01:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
distinguishing the case I I have an
 
01:26:34.550 --> 01:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
department for rent I haven't been there

that you're not going that P does that
 
01:26:44.470 --> 01:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
person have any that's criminal
 
01:26:47.189 --> 01:26:47.199 align:start position:0%
trespasses I agree okay I just want to
 
01:26:51.950 --> 01:26:51.960 align:start position:0%

01:28:06.109 --> 01:28:06.119 align:start position:0%
some concerns we're really pleased to
 
01:28:09.750 --> 01:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
hear that the um that the uh Prime
 
01:28:11.669 --> 01:28:11.679 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the non- gerain amendment has
 
01:28:13.189 --> 01:28:13.199 align:start position:0%
said that he really wanted to work to
 
01:28:14.830 --> 01:28:14.840 align:start position:0%

we're also really pleased to uh to hear
 
01:28:20.510 --> 01:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
that there are proposals in play uh that
 
01:28:23.030 --> 01:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
could really solve the issue uh of
 
01:28:26.229 --> 01:28:26.239 align:start position:0%
concern um so we uh you know urge a
 
01:28:29.590 --> 01:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
member uh of this committee to um to
 
01:28:32.310 --> 01:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
work with with those experts uh to to
 
01:28:35.510 --> 01:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
bring forth a uh a new formal Amendment
 
01:28:38.430 --> 01:28:38.440 align:start position:0%
uh in partnership with this uh sponsor
 
01:28:40.590 --> 01:28:40.600 align:start position:0%
uh to make sure but I just wanted to add
 
01:28:42.189 --> 01:28:42.199 align:start position:0%
from our perspective our members are
 
01:28:44.669 --> 01:28:44.679 align:start position:0%
those who develop Finance manage
 
01:28:46.709 --> 01:28:46.719 align:start position:0%
affordable housing properties homeless
 
01:28:48.950 --> 01:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
service providers public housing
 
01:28:51.270 --> 01:28:51.280 align:start position:0%
agencies Supportive Housing providers
 
01:28:54.109 --> 01:28:54.119 align:start position:0%
and low-income family advocates so we
 
01:28:56.430 --> 01:28:56.440 align:start position:0%
are heavily involved in the supply side
 
01:28:58.629 --> 01:28:58.639 align:start position:0%
crisis and as you know there are over 50
 
01:29:03.149 --> 01:29:03.159 align:start position:0%
bills uh this session um looking at the
 
01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
uh affordable housing crisis that we
 
01:29:06.229 --> 01:29:06.239 align:start position:0%
have in the granite state and as Miss
 
01:29:08.910 --> 01:29:08.920 align:start position:0%
Cornell said you know we have this
 
01:29:10.870 --> 01:29:10.880 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate that's really concerning
 
01:29:13.830 --> 01:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
really driving prices up and we have uh
 
01:29:16.109 --> 01:29:16.119 align:start position:0%
a major increase in homelessness what
 
01:29:18.189 --> 01:29:18.199 align:start position:0%
we're concerned with the the uh
 
01:29:20.390 --> 01:29:20.400 align:start position:0%
Amendment as proposed is really the
 
01:29:22.189 --> 01:29:22.199 align:start position:0%
ambiguity that's been named several
 
01:29:25.030 --> 01:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
times in different ways um and also the
 
01:29:28.229 --> 01:29:28.239 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences um homelessness
 
01:29:30.750 --> 01:29:30.760 align:start position:0%
in our state uh can look a little
 
01:29:32.629 --> 01:29:32.639 align:start position:0%
different uh particularly in places that
 
01:29:35.390 --> 01:29:35.400 align:start position:0%
don't have Services close by and so a
 
01:29:37.270 --> 01:29:37.280 align:start position:0%
lot of families with children will
 
01:29:41.430 --> 01:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
choose to couch surf uh instead of um
 
01:29:43.229 --> 01:29:43.239 align:start position:0%
seek shelter
 
01:29:46.669 --> 01:29:46.679 align:start position:0%
Services um and so we're concerned that
 
01:29:49.430 --> 01:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
they would get caught up in a uh
 
01:29:51.750 --> 01:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
scenario that has been articulated in
 
01:29:53.310 --> 01:29:53.320 align:start position:0%
this case sometimes about a student
 
01:29:56.390 --> 01:29:56.400 align:start position:0%
unknowingly subletting perhaps a family
 
01:30:02.070 --> 01:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
member um uh uh who is sharing uh a um
 
01:30:05.270 --> 01:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
non-restricted property or even a a
 
01:30:08.629 --> 01:30:08.639 align:start position:0%
rental situation and anyway it seems
 
01:30:10.950 --> 01:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
like there is a a way to address any
 
01:30:12.750 --> 01:30:12.760 align:start position:0%
concerns about that through a civil
 
01:30:15.750 --> 01:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
process and to avoid uh putting these
 
01:30:18.950 --> 01:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
families through a criminal process um
 
01:30:22.070 --> 01:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
in an already uh very hostile sit
 
01:30:24.510 --> 01:30:24.520 align:start position:0%
housing situation with that I really
 
01:30:26.229 --> 01:30:26.239 align:start position:0%
don't have anything else to add I'm I'm
 
01:30:29.310 --> 01:30:29.320 align:start position:0%
happy to feel any
 
01:30:32.550 --> 01:30:32.560 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you very much
 
01:30:34.470 --> 01:30:34.480 align:start position:0%
is there anybody else wishing to testify
 
01:30:36.750 --> 01:30:36.760 align:start position:0%
on this bill that has not done so seeing
 
01:30:38.910 --> 01:30:38.920 align:start position:0%
none I will close the public hearing for
 
01:30:40.229 --> 01:30:40.239 align:start position:0%
the non- gerine
 
01:30:44.550 --> 01:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
amendment what was it uh 20241
 
01:30:48.270 --> 01:30:48.280 align:start position:0%
647h and um we are late for our other
 
01:30:49.990 --> 01:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
hearing but does the committee wish to
 
01:30:52.550 --> 01:30:52.560 align:start position:0%

this in your testimony and I see it in

the bill but I just wanted to reinforce
 
01:48:21.030 --> 01:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
that this doesn't construe anti-Semitism
 
01:48:23.510 --> 01:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
as criticism for Israel or vice vers
 
01:48:28.510 --> 01:48:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:30.910 --> 01:48:30.920 align:start position:0%
such I would I would add to that by
 
01:48:33.470 --> 01:48:33.480 align:start position:0%
saying the same way that if you were
 
01:48:35.030 --> 01:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
have criticized a Vatican doesn't mean
 
01:48:37.830 --> 01:48:37.840 align:start position:0%

anti-Semitism um on multiple occasions
 
01:50:32.870 --> 01:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
including in response to my uh my
 
01:50:35.270 --> 01:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
legislation around the concept of having
 
01:50:38.070 --> 01:50:38.080 align:start position:0%
a study committee to look at hate crimes
 
01:50:41.109 --> 01:50:41.119 align:start position:0%

um uh emails and um messages of one kind
 
01:50:48.550 --> 01:50:48.560 align:start position:0%
and another that attacked me purely
 
01:50:50.830 --> 01:50:50.840 align:start position:0%
because of my Jewish identity and
 
01:50:54.750 --> 01:50:54.760 align:start position:0%
accused me um of trying to take over the
 
01:50:58.109 --> 01:50:58.119 align:start position:0%
government with my uh anti-American
 
01:51:01.510 --> 01:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
beliefs because I'm a rabid such and
 
01:51:04.669 --> 01:51:04.679 align:start position:0%
such and other types of words um I just
 
01:51:07.910 --> 01:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to offer my services to answer
 
01:51:11.350 --> 01:51:11.360 align:start position:0%
questions about um what anti-Semitism
 
01:51:13.709 --> 01:51:13.719 align:start position:0%
feels like or what anti-Semitism
 
01:51:16.149 --> 01:51:16.159 align:start position:0%
experiences have been um because I know
 
01:51:18.270 --> 01:51:18.280 align:start position:0%
not everyone has been has had the
 
01:51:20.270 --> 01:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
experience of being dis specifically
 
01:51:22.709 --> 01:51:22.719 align:start position:0%
discriminated against because purely
 
01:51:25.629 --> 01:51:25.639 align:start position:0%
because of their identity um I I I
 
01:51:27.189 --> 01:51:27.199 align:start position:0%
consider myself very lucky to have been
 
01:51:29.629 --> 01:51:29.639 align:start position:0%
born a US citizen and to have the
 
01:51:32.350 --> 01:51:32.360 align:start position:0%
Privileges of a US citizen I consider
 
01:51:35.589 --> 01:51:35.599 align:start position:0%
myself very lucky to have been afforded
 
01:51:37.950 --> 01:51:37.960 align:start position:0%
a number of privileges in my life um
 
01:51:42.189 --> 01:51:42.199 align:start position:0%
including Financial Security um but I I
 
01:51:44.629 --> 01:51:44.639 align:start position:0%
can tell you that my first experiences
 
01:51:46.790 --> 01:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
my first remembered experiences of
 
01:51:48.589 --> 01:51:48.599 align:start position:0%
anti-Semitism began when I was a
 
01:51:50.669 --> 01:51:50.679 align:start position:0%
preschooler and continued from there and
 
01:51:52.030 --> 01:51:52.040 align:start position:0%
I'm more than happy to answer any
 
01:51:52.040 --> 01:51:55.669 align:start position:0%
I'm more than happy to answer any
questions

01:51:55.669 --> 01:51:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:55.679 --> 01:51:58.750 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:51:58.750 --> 01:51:58.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:00.990 --> 01:52:01.000 align:start position:0%
Muse thank you for taking my question
 
01:52:04.189 --> 01:52:04.199 align:start position:0%
have you had uh a chance to look at the
 
01:52:07.390 --> 01:52:07.400 align:start position:0%
IH uh definition of anti-semitism and
 
01:52:11.229 --> 01:52:11.239 align:start position:0%
what are your comments on it yes I I did
 
01:52:13.310 --> 01:52:13.320 align:start position:0%
in fact um pull up the specific
 
01:52:16.270 --> 01:52:16.280 align:start position:0%
definition to read through it carefully
 
01:52:19.229 --> 01:52:19.239 align:start position:0%
um overall I think it's a pretty strong
 
01:52:21.669 --> 01:52:21.679 align:start position:0%
definition that gives clear terms I
 
01:52:23.189 --> 01:52:23.199 align:start position:0%
think if you look on their website they
 
01:52:26.270 --> 01:52:26.280 align:start position:0%
give specific examples of how it has
 
01:52:29.470 --> 01:52:29.480 align:start position:0%
been interpreted um I think especially
 
01:52:30.910 --> 01:52:30.920 align:start position:0%
in light of current events there's a
 
01:52:32.870 --> 01:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
little bit of a Sticky Wicket in terms
 
01:52:36.030 --> 01:52:36.040 align:start position:0%
of descriptions about Israel and the
 
01:52:38.669 --> 01:52:38.679 align:start position:0%
right of Israel to exist
 
01:52:40.910 --> 01:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
um and I I don't know how we address
 
01:52:44.629 --> 01:52:44.639 align:start position:0%
that as a committee it's a very um
 
01:52:47.510 --> 01:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
complex and complicated question that
 
01:52:49.830 --> 01:52:49.840 align:start position:0%
you know has roots that are 2,000 years
 
01:52:52.709 --> 01:52:52.719 align:start position:0%
old um but more specifically in the last
 
01:52:56.069 --> 01:52:56.079 align:start position:0%
40 years um you know I think there's a
 
01:52:58.430 --> 01:52:58.440 align:start position:0%
lot of rhetoric that's thrown around
 
01:53:00.310 --> 01:53:00.320 align:start position:0%
about Israel in
 
01:53:03.550 --> 01:53:03.560 align:start position:0%
particular that is based on
 
01:53:05.629 --> 01:53:05.639 align:start position:0%
misinformation and
 
01:53:08.109 --> 01:53:08.119 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding um and I think that
 
01:53:10.750 --> 01:53:10.760 align:start position:0%
people perhaps don't understand that by
 
01:53:13.149 --> 01:53:13.159 align:start position:0%
using terms like I heard on the radio
 
01:53:14.629 --> 01:53:14.639 align:start position:0%
this morning where people were shouting
 
01:53:18.270 --> 01:53:18.280 align:start position:0%
long live the antifa which is a Hamas
 
01:53:21.910 --> 01:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
code word for kill the Jews um that
 
01:53:21.920 --> 01:53:23.350 align:start position:0%
code word for kill the Jews um that
that's

01:53:23.350 --> 01:53:23.360 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:53:25.990 --> 01:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
what they're saying um that's not to say
 
01:53:27.790 --> 01:53:27.800 align:start position:0%
I agree with the Israeli government and
 
01:53:29.510 --> 01:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
how they're choosing to respond to
 
01:53:32.750 --> 01:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
attacks from Hamas but um it is
 
01:53:33.830 --> 01:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
certainly different when there's a
 
01:53:35.430 --> 01:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
government with a specific religious
 
01:53:36.990 --> 01:53:37.000 align:start position:0%
Focus although I would say that the
 
01:53:38.910 --> 01:53:38.920 align:start position:0%
Israeli government is made up of people
 
01:53:43.589 --> 01:53:43.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:45.790 --> 01:53:45.800 align:start position:0%
religions representative wheer thank you
 
01:53:48.470 --> 01:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
madam chair does the legislation ban the
 
01:53:50.870 --> 01:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
use of the word intifa as far as I
 
01:53:52.669 --> 01:53:52.679 align:start position:0%
understand you know that can be used in
 
01:53:54.430 --> 01:53:54.440 align:start position:0%
many different ways but it simply means
 
01:53:57.910 --> 01:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
revolution I suppose um so how how it's
 
01:54:00.229 --> 01:54:00.239 align:start position:0%
used is how is is is I I would say the
 
01:54:04.910 --> 01:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
intent is for me the the issue and um
 
01:54:06.310 --> 01:54:06.320 align:start position:0%
that's a separate but that's a separate
 
01:54:07.790 --> 01:54:07.800 align:start position:0%
conversation I don't believe this bill
 
01:54:10.069 --> 01:54:10.079 align:start position:0%
addresses that specifically I think
 
01:54:13.830 --> 01:54:13.840 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of misunderstanding of
 
01:54:13.840 --> 01:54:15.430 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of misunderstanding of
terms

01:54:15.430 --> 01:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
terms
 
01:54:17.950 --> 01:54:17.960 align:start position:0%
good all right thank you for your
 
01:54:20.189 --> 01:54:20.199 align:start position:0%
testimony is there anybody else here
 
01:54:22.390 --> 01:54:22.400 align:start position:0%
that wishes to testify that has not
 
01:54:24.350 --> 01:54:24.360 align:start position:0%
turned in a card seeing none I will
 
01:54:28.669 --> 01:54:28.679 align:start position:0%

01:54:34.669 --> 01:54:34.679 align:start position:0%

Paul Burch I live in West Milan New
 
03:03:10.950 --> 03:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I served in the house from
 
03:03:14.510 --> 03:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
2012 to 2022 and was a member of House
 
03:03:18.229 --> 03:03:18.239 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee the entire time
 
03:03:20.429 --> 03:03:20.439 align:start position:0%
I would note that I'm past president of
 
03:03:22.550 --> 03:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
the bror area Jewish Community the
 
03:03:25.269 --> 03:03:25.279 align:start position:0%
largest synagogue in southern Vermont
 
03:03:27.190 --> 03:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
I've been described as a leading
 
03:03:30.070 --> 03:03:30.080 align:start position:0%
spokesperson against anti-Semitism in
 
03:03:32.830 --> 03:03:32.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and elsewhere I am here to
 
03:03:36.070 --> 03:03:36.080 align:start position:0%
support and urge the passage of this
 
03:03:38.349 --> 03:03:38.359 align:start position:0%
amendment relating to the definition of
 
03:03:40.630 --> 03:03:40.640 align:start position:0%
anti-semitism and its use in New
 
03:03:43.349 --> 03:03:43.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's anti-discrimination laws
 
03:03:45.269 --> 03:03:45.279 align:start position:0%
this should be a bipartisan measure and
 
03:03:48.030 --> 03:03:48.040 align:start position:0%
I expect that it will be this amendment
 
03:03:50.110 --> 03:03:50.120 align:start position:0%
is carefully and narrowly drawn I
 
03:03:53.110 --> 03:03:53.120 align:start position:0%
support the amendment 100% why does New
 
03:03:56.269 --> 03:03:56.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire need the IH working definition
 
03:03:56.279 --> 03:03:57.110 align:start position:0%
Hampshire need the IH working definition
of

03:03:57.110 --> 03:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:04:00.110 --> 03:04:00.120 align:start position:0%
anti-semitism simply to fight hate you
 
03:04:03.870 --> 03:04:03.880 align:start position:0%
must be able to identify it the IH
 
03:04:06.910 --> 03:04:06.920 align:start position:0%
definition does exactly that supported
 
03:04:08.830 --> 03:04:08.840 align:start position:0%
by most Jewish communities and
 
03:04:10.990 --> 03:04:11.000 align:start position:0%
organizations it has been adopted by
 
03:04:13.870 --> 03:04:13.880 align:start position:0%
governments businesses Nos and other
 
03:04:16.349 --> 03:04:16.359 align:start position:0%
institutions around the world it is by
 
03:04:19.110 --> 03:04:19.120 align:start position:0%
far the most widely accepted definition
 
03:04:19.120 --> 03:04:19.950 align:start position:0%
far the most widely accepted definition
of

03:04:19.950 --> 03:04:19.960 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:04:23.269 --> 03:04:23.279 align:start position:0%
anti-semitism adopted by over 1100
 
03:04:26.790 --> 03:04:26.800 align:start position:0%
Global entities as of December
 
03:04:29.190 --> 03:04:29.200 align:start position:0%
2022 identifying hate can have a
 
03:04:32.110 --> 03:04:32.120 align:start position:0%
subjective and objective approach let's
 
03:04:35.429 --> 03:04:35.439 align:start position:0%
use an example somebody wears a clan
 
03:04:37.910 --> 03:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
outfit to rep's Hall and is called out
 
03:04:41.349 --> 03:04:41.359 align:start position:0%
for racism they say that in their mind
 
03:04:43.950 --> 03:04:43.960 align:start position:0%
there's nothing racist about a clothing
 
03:04:46.590 --> 03:04:46.600 align:start position:0%
Choice similarly a call from someone
 
03:04:48.710 --> 03:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
that people of color should be sent back
 
03:04:51.910 --> 03:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
to where they came from insist that
 
03:04:54.389 --> 03:04:54.399 align:start position:0%
racism has nothing to do it's just an
 
03:04:57.190 --> 03:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
opinion so obviously leaving it to the
 
03:05:00.469 --> 03:05:00.479 align:start position:0%
individual doesn't work some believe
 
03:05:03.110 --> 03:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
especially on my side of the aisle that
 
03:05:05.309 --> 03:05:05.319 align:start position:0%
is the exclusive right of the community
 
03:05:08.229 --> 03:05:08.239 align:start position:0%
affected to Define what is racism and
 
03:05:10.750 --> 03:05:10.760 align:start position:0%
hate that works in my opinion to a
 
03:05:13.990 --> 03:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
limited degree what has happened in the
 
03:05:17.830 --> 03:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
Jew hate universe is that in this form
 
03:05:20.429 --> 03:05:20.439 align:start position:0%
of hate everybody including the Jew
 
03:05:23.309 --> 03:05:23.319 align:start position:0%
haters believe they have a right to
 
03:05:27.950 --> 03:05:27.960 align:start position:0%
Define what is anti-Semitic so in 2016
 
03:05:30.229 --> 03:05:30.239 align:start position:0%
there was an international effort to
 
03:05:32.469 --> 03:05:32.479 align:start position:0%
provide an objective working definition
 
03:05:32.479 --> 03:05:33.229 align:start position:0%
provide an objective working definition
of

03:05:33.229 --> 03:05:33.239 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:05:35.429 --> 03:05:35.439 align:start position:0%
anti-semitism which has resulted in a
 
03:05:37.630 --> 03:05:37.640 align:start position:0%
working definition that has been pretty
 
03:05:39.750 --> 03:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
much universally adopted in the
 
03:05:42.030 --> 03:05:42.040 align:start position:0%
westernized world I can't speak to
 
03:05:44.550 --> 03:05:44.560 align:start position:0%
Russia China places like
 
03:05:48.750 --> 03:05:48.760 align:start position:0%
that the IH a definition consists of two
 
03:05:52.030 --> 03:05:52.040 align:start position:0%
part the first part has the definition
 
03:05:54.670 --> 03:05:54.680 align:start position:0%
anti-Semitism is certain perception of
 
03:05:56.990 --> 03:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
Jews which may be expressed as hatred
 
03:05:59.790 --> 03:05:59.800 align:start position:0%
towards Jews rhetorical and physical
 
03:06:01.590 --> 03:06:01.600 align:start position:0%
manifestations of
 
03:06:03.630 --> 03:06:03.640 align:start position:0%
anti-Semitism are directed towards
 
03:06:06.150 --> 03:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
Jewish or non-jewish individuals and or
 
03:06:08.269 --> 03:06:08.279 align:start position:0%
their property towards Jewish Community
 
03:06:11.070 --> 03:06:11.080 align:start position:0%
institutions and religious facilities
 
03:06:14.030 --> 03:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
the second part lists several examples
 
03:06:15.830 --> 03:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
they serve as illustrations and help
 
03:06:18.469 --> 03:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
with the application of the definition
 
03:06:21.750 --> 03:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
in practice widespread acceptance and
 
03:06:25.150 --> 03:06:25.160 align:start position:0%
use of this definition ensure that
 
03:06:28.110 --> 03:06:28.120 align:start position:0%
anti-semitic incidents can be registered
 
03:06:31.550 --> 03:06:31.560 align:start position:0%
and compared in a uniform and systemic
 
03:06:35.110 --> 03:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
way let me emphasize that last sentence
 
03:06:37.590 --> 03:06:37.600 align:start position:0%
the adoption of the working definition
 
03:06:40.990 --> 03:06:41.000 align:start position:0%
ensures accurate record keeping as well
 
03:06:44.030 --> 03:06:44.040 align:start position:0%
as consistent application of responses
 
03:06:47.150 --> 03:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
to anti-semitic instances if you for
 
03:06:47.160 --> 03:06:48.269 align:start position:0%
to anti-semitic instances if you for
example

03:06:48.269 --> 03:06:48.279 align:start position:0%
example
 
03:06:51.070 --> 03:06:51.080 align:start position:0%
want to compare the incidence of
 
03:06:53.190 --> 03:06:53.200 align:start position:0%
anti-Semitism in New Hampshire to
 
03:06:55.830 --> 03:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
Georgia it helps to be using the same
 
03:06:57.670 --> 03:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
definition of
 
03:06:59.950 --> 03:06:59.960 align:start position:0%
anti-semitism or else you run the risk
 
03:07:02.309 --> 03:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
of comparing apples to oranges and the
 
03:07:04.790 --> 03:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
like so to the extent that there's a
 
03:07:07.790 --> 03:07:07.800 align:start position:0%
uniformity of definition you're be
 
03:07:09.990 --> 03:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
you're able to track anti-Semitism
 
03:07:13.269 --> 03:07:13.279 align:start position:0%
better you're able to create data you're
 
03:07:16.469 --> 03:07:16.479 align:start position:0%
able to take action on information
 
03:07:18.190 --> 03:07:18.200 align:start position:0%
that's reliable
 
03:07:20.110 --> 03:07:20.120 align:start position:0%
this amendment is carefully and narrowly
 
03:07:22.950 --> 03:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
drawn in terms of its usage there are
 
03:07:25.469 --> 03:07:25.479 align:start position:0%
limits to the legislation to prevent
 
03:07:28.830 --> 03:07:28.840 align:start position:0%
misuse in terms of its application yet
 
03:07:31.990 --> 03:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
if we wish our anti-discrimination laws
 
03:07:33.630 --> 03:07:33.640 align:start position:0%
to be fully
 
03:07:35.990 --> 03:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
applicable they must clearly be
 
03:07:38.349 --> 03:07:38.359 align:start position:0%
protective of our New Hampshire Jewish
 
03:07:41.190 --> 03:07:41.200 align:start position:0%

Jewish institutions private homes and
 
03:09:19.590 --> 03:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
public spaces have all been victims how
 
03:09:22.030 --> 03:09:22.040 align:start position:0%
can we fight anti-Semitism without being
 
03:09:24.269 --> 03:09:24.279 align:start position:0%
able to Define it throughout our state
 
03:09:25.750 --> 03:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
the Jewish Community would Define their
 
03:09:28.309 --> 03:09:28.319 align:start position:0%
Judaism in many ways some would say
 
03:09:31.110 --> 03:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
religious others cultural or ethnic
 
03:09:33.630 --> 03:09:33.640 align:start position:0%
without a standard definition it is too
 
03:09:35.469 --> 03:09:35.479 align:start position:0%
easy for people to claim something was
 
03:09:37.590 --> 03:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
not anti-semitic because it was not
 
03:09:40.269 --> 03:09:40.279 align:start position:0%
based on a particular characteristic
 
03:09:42.429 --> 03:09:42.439 align:start position:0%
without a definition how can we expect
 
03:09:44.550 --> 03:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
public officials who may not be familiar
 
03:09:46.790 --> 03:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
with anti-Semitism to recognize an
 
03:09:49.110 --> 03:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
incident and handle it
 
03:09:51.710 --> 03:09:51.720 align:start position:0%

46% of Young Americans 18 to 29 don't
 
03:10:09.269 --> 03:10:09.279 align:start position:0%
believe denying the Holocaust is
 
03:10:11.870 --> 03:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
anti-Semitic and one in five think it is
 
03:10:14.510 --> 03:10:14.520 align:start position:0%

during the Holocaust for the first time

I will be bringing my 11-year-old son
 
03:10:31.870 --> 03:10:31.880 align:start position:0%
not only because it is important for him
 
03:10:34.070 --> 03:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
to know the history of the Holocaust the
 
03:10:35.870 --> 03:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
horror of what took place in honor the
 
03:10:38.269 --> 03:10:38.279 align:start position:0%
lives lost but because he also needs to
 
03:10:40.510 --> 03:10:40.520 align:start position:0%
know the reality of what Jewish people
 
03:10:42.790 --> 03:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
are currently facing and that unless
 
03:10:44.750 --> 03:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
people are willing to stand up and speak
 
03:10:47.830 --> 03:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
out history will repeat itself the
 
03:10:50.110 --> 03:10:50.120 align:start position:0%
statistics above show how little
 
03:10:52.469 --> 03:10:52.479 align:start position:0%
knowledge young adults have and will
 
03:10:54.790 --> 03:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
only allow anti-Semitism to continue to
 
03:10:57.389 --> 03:10:57.399 align:start position:0%
rise it is vital that New Hampshire
 
03:11:00.550 --> 03:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
clearly identifies defines anti-Semitism
 
03:11:02.630 --> 03:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
to keep our Jewish communi safe amidst
 
03:11:04.590 --> 03:11:04.600 align:start position:0%
the increase of threats and attacks they
 
03:11:06.950 --> 03:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
face over a thousand entities have
 
03:11:08.469 --> 03:11:08.479 align:start position:0%
already adopted or endorsed the
 
03:11:11.469 --> 03:11:11.479 align:start position:0%
definition worldwide the IH definition
 
03:11:12.990 --> 03:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
is the only definition that has been
 
03:11:15.150 --> 03:11:15.160 align:start position:0%
officially recognized internationally
 
03:11:16.830 --> 03:11:16.840 align:start position:0%
and adopted by mainstream Jewish
 
03:11:16.840 --> 03:11:18.389 align:start position:0%
and adopted by mainstream Jewish
organizations

03:11:18.389 --> 03:11:18.399 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
03:11:19.950 --> 03:11:19.960 align:start position:0%
it is the most comprehensive and
 
03:11:22.190 --> 03:11:22.200 align:start position:0%
effective definition of anti-semitism
 
03:11:24.309 --> 03:11:24.319 align:start position:0%
ensuring proper assessment valid
 
03:11:26.389 --> 03:11:26.399 align:start position:0%
monitoring compliance ensuring
 
03:11:28.790 --> 03:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
anti-semitic hate and bias are addressed
 
03:11:30.790 --> 03:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
and equally to other types of hate and
 
03:11:34.229 --> 03:11:34.239 align:start position:0%
bias and signifies anti-Semitism will
 
03:11:36.750 --> 03:11:36.760 align:start position:0%
not be tolerated in New Hampshire I ask

03:12:24.030 --> 03:12:24.040 align:start position:0%
a crisis right now and um 35 states have
 
03:12:26.870 --> 03:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
adopted or uh codified or endorsed this
 
03:12:28.830 --> 03:12:28.840 align:start position:0%
definition over the last couple of years
 
03:12:30.469 --> 03:12:30.479 align:start position:0%
and I look forward to New Hampshire
 
03:12:32.269 --> 03:12:32.279 align:start position:0%
being the next one I really appreciate
 
03:12:35.110 --> 03:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
um I really appreciate this this gesture
 
03:12:36.710 --> 03:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
and this move because it's it's
 
03:12:36.720 --> 03:12:38.229 align:start position:0%
and this move because it's it's
meaningful

03:12:38.229 --> 03:12:38.239 align:start position:0%
meaningful
 
03:12:40.950 --> 03:12:40.960 align:start position:0%
um one of the members U of the house you
 
03:12:43.830 --> 03:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
identify yourself I'm sorry Jake Bennett
 
03:12:45.590 --> 03:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
from Israeli American Coalition for
 
03:12:48.950 --> 03:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
Action um a National Organization that
 
03:12:52.349 --> 03:12:52.359 align:start position:0%
um that serves Jewish Americans
 
03:12:54.750 --> 03:12:54.760 align:start position:0%
um so someone asked me to address the
 
03:12:57.150 --> 03:12:57.160 align:start position:0%
question of uh freedom of speech and and
 
03:12:58.469 --> 03:12:58.479 align:start position:0%
does defining
 
03:13:00.550 --> 03:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
anti-Semitism infringe on that in some
 
03:13:02.710 --> 03:13:02.720 align:start position:0%
way this bill is very clearly written to
 
03:13:05.630 --> 03:13:05.640 align:start position:0%
not do that the Supreme Court has shown
 
03:13:08.510 --> 03:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
uh in in a number of cases that defining
 
03:13:11.590 --> 03:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
racism or bigotry does not chill the
 
03:13:14.429 --> 03:13:14.439 align:start position:0%
speech of bigotry or racism this bill
 
03:13:17.389 --> 03:13:17.399 align:start position:0%
likewise does not chill that speech the
 
03:13:19.429 --> 03:13:19.439 align:start position:0%
purpose of having a definition is so
 
03:13:22.150 --> 03:13:22.160 align:start position:0%
that when uh unlawful discrimination
 
03:13:25.269 --> 03:13:25.279 align:start position:0%
happens that might might be anti-semitic
 
03:13:27.389 --> 03:13:27.399 align:start position:0%
in nature but there might be confusion
 
03:13:29.269 --> 03:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
what is it you know it can take so many
 
03:13:32.830 --> 03:13:32.840 align:start position:0%
shapes uh anti-jewish racism conspiracy
 
03:13:35.870 --> 03:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
theories um religious-based
 
03:13:37.910 --> 03:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
anti-Semitism this definition helps
 
03:13:40.269 --> 03:13:40.279 align:start position:0%
break it down national origin uh based
 
03:13:42.269 --> 03:13:42.279 align:start position:0%
on someone's uh national origin
 
03:13:43.830 --> 03:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
connection to Israel or support for
 
03:13:45.790 --> 03:13:45.800 align:start position:0%
Israel so that's what this definition
 
03:13:47.590 --> 03:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
does a person can still go down the
 
03:13:49.510 --> 03:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
street saying whatever hateful things
 
03:13:51.229 --> 03:13:51.239 align:start position:0%
they want about the Jewish people the
 
03:13:53.469 --> 03:13:53.479 align:start position:0%
Jewish religion the state of Israel that
 
03:13:54.750 --> 03:13:54.760 align:start position:0%
is not illegal this bill doesn't
 
03:13:57.510 --> 03:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
criminalized speech but if that person
 
03:14:00.910 --> 03:14:00.920 align:start position:0%
then um then unlawfully discriminates
 
03:14:03.389 --> 03:14:03.399 align:start position:0%
against a Jewish New Hampshire right and
 
03:14:05.510 --> 03:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
the court say I'm confused by what's
 
03:14:06.830 --> 03:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
going on well here's a here's a
 
03:14:11.469 --> 03:14:11.479 align:start position:0%
definition you can reference um so uh it
 
03:14:13.670 --> 03:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
also will help the state be in line with
 
03:14:15.349 --> 03:14:15.359 align:start position:0%
federal law because right now this
 
03:14:17.630 --> 03:14:17.640 align:start position:0%
definition is being used for title six
 
03:14:19.269 --> 03:14:19.279 align:start position:0%
um and there are currently bills in
 
03:14:22.750 --> 03:14:22.760 align:start position:0%
Congress uh to bring it also to title 7
 
03:14:25.910 --> 03:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
um through executive order um back in
 
03:14:28.550 --> 03:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
September it was applied to uh to all
 
03:14:31.550 --> 03:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
the the federal departments that didn't
 
03:14:34.030 --> 03:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
yet use this definition um it's been
 
03:14:36.110 --> 03:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
applied by the last four administrations
 
03:14:38.990 --> 03:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
successively in into different uh
 
03:14:41.429 --> 03:14:41.439 align:start position:0%
different departments uh President Obama
 
03:14:43.590 --> 03:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
brought it into Department of State um
 
03:14:44.870 --> 03:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
president Trump into Department of
 
03:14:47.030 --> 03:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
Education and then President Biden into
 
03:14:49.990 --> 03:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
several other departments
 
03:14:54.190 --> 03:14:54.200 align:start position:0%
um so just to take a another minute to
 
03:14:56.110 --> 03:14:56.120 align:start position:0%
talk about the crisis that's going on
 
03:14:58.389 --> 03:14:58.399 align:start position:0%
around the country and to and to put it
 
03:14:58.399 --> 03:14:59.190 align:start position:0%
around the country and to and to put it
in

03:14:59.190 --> 03:14:59.200 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:15:02.309 --> 03:15:02.319 align:start position:0%
perspective um how deep and wide is this
 
03:15:04.429 --> 03:15:04.439 align:start position:0%
crisis Congress and the White House are
 
03:15:08.550 --> 03:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
um are beginning to talk about uh about
 
03:15:10.710 --> 03:15:10.720 align:start position:0%
applying title six penalties to schools
 
03:15:12.870 --> 03:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
who are not standing up to civil rights
 
03:15:15.389 --> 03:15:15.399 align:start position:0%
infringements targeting Jews uh the
 
03:15:17.190 --> 03:15:17.200 align:start position:0%
gaslighting that's been happening on
 
03:15:18.469 --> 03:15:18.479 align:start position:0%
campuses has been called out in
 
03:15:20.550 --> 03:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
Congressional hearings uh ivy league
 
03:15:22.269 --> 03:15:22.279 align:start position:0%
College presidents have been reprimanded
 
03:15:24.790 --> 03:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
in those hearings um and in the national
 
03:15:26.870 --> 03:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
press for sweeping the problem under the
 
03:15:28.910 --> 03:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
rug for so long for pretending that
 
03:15:31.790 --> 03:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
calls for genocide of Jews uh whether in
 
03:15:34.189 --> 03:15:34.199 align:start position:0%
Israel or globalizing the inata that
 
03:15:35.229 --> 03:15:35.239 align:start position:0%
those are not
 
03:15:37.189 --> 03:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
anti-semitic it should be noted that the
 
03:15:39.229 --> 03:15:39.239 align:start position:0%
word inata has a meaning it means
 
03:15:41.429 --> 03:15:41.439 align:start position:0%
violent attacks and lynchings of Jewish
 
03:15:44.870 --> 03:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
people and in uh in in Israel there have
 
03:15:48.550 --> 03:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
been over 1500 Jews lynched uh through
 
03:15:50.510 --> 03:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
mob violence or or killed in Terror
 
03:15:53.189 --> 03:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
attacks under inata so on campuses here
 
03:15:55.309 --> 03:15:55.319 align:start position:0%
we have students calling to globalize
 
03:15:58.750 --> 03:15:58.760 align:start position:0%
the inata localize the inata um
 
03:16:00.389 --> 03:16:00.399 align:start position:0%
commentators on national news outlets
 
03:16:02.070 --> 03:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
are calling out the double standards
 
03:16:04.349 --> 03:16:04.359 align:start position:0%
evident in the non-application of Campus
 
03:16:07.150 --> 03:16:07.160 align:start position:0%
codes of conduct when it comes to
 
03:16:09.070 --> 03:16:09.080 align:start position:0%
anti-Semitism we know that no school
 
03:16:11.550 --> 03:16:11.560 align:start position:0%
would allow protests on campus uh to
 
03:16:12.990 --> 03:16:13.000 align:start position:0%
persist for more than a day that called
 
03:16:15.189 --> 03:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
for the lynching of black or lgbtq
 
03:16:17.229 --> 03:16:17.239 align:start position:0%
students yet those protest test have
 
03:16:19.150 --> 03:16:19.160 align:start position:0%

Jews for more than 7 months since
 
03:16:23.830 --> 03:16:23.840 align:start position:0%

to all students uh telling Jewish
 
03:16:32.309 --> 03:16:32.319 align:start position:0%
students they should remain home or
 
03:16:33.550 --> 03:16:33.560 align:start position:0%
could remain home for the rest of the
 
03:16:36.389 --> 03:16:36.399 align:start position:0%
semester because uh because it was
 
03:16:38.150 --> 03:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
dangerous for them on campus and the
 
03:16:40.870 --> 03:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
school wasn't uh taking action and
 
03:16:43.070 --> 03:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
actually last night they did uh and
 
03:16:46.070 --> 03:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
arrested a number of the protesters um
 
03:16:47.670 --> 03:16:47.680 align:start position:0%
it turned out that many of them were not
 
03:16:49.510 --> 03:16:49.520 align:start position:0%
even students they were organized uh
 
03:16:51.870 --> 03:16:51.880 align:start position:0%

03:17:14.670 --> 03:17:14.680 align:start position:0%
flight of stairs um the examples go on
 
03:17:17.349 --> 03:17:17.359 align:start position:0%
in the 3 months uh that I data for
 
03:17:19.750 --> 03:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
between October 7th and January 7th
 
03:17:21.670 --> 03:17:21.680 align:start position:0%
there were an average of 34 anti-semitic
 
03:17:24.189 --> 03:17:24.199 align:start position:0%
incidents per day across the country
 
03:17:28.189 --> 03:17:28.199 align:start position:0%
these 3,291 incidents included 56

harassment and 1,37 rallies that
 
03:17:41.429 --> 03:17:41.439 align:start position:0%
included both anti-semitic rhetoric and
 
03:17:43.550 --> 03:17:43.560 align:start position:0%
expressions of support for terrorism
 
03:17:45.590 --> 03:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
against the state of Israel Andor Jews
 
03:17:45.600 --> 03:17:49.269 align:start position:0%
against the state of Israel Andor Jews
generally

03:17:49.269 --> 03:17:49.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:51.309 --> 03:17:51.319 align:start position:0%
so I want to wrap up because I don't
 
03:17:52.429 --> 03:17:52.439 align:start position:0%
want to I don't want to take too much
 
03:17:53.790 --> 03:17:53.800 align:start position:0%
longer but this is what we're dealing
 
03:17:57.389 --> 03:17:57.399 align:start position:0%
with um is uh is a a broad and
 
03:18:01.269 --> 03:18:01.279 align:start position:0%
widespread crisis that is that is uh
 
03:18:03.510 --> 03:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
frankly affecting not only not only
 
03:18:06.389 --> 03:18:06.399 align:start position:0%
students at at college campuses but also
 
03:18:09.349 --> 03:18:09.359 align:start position:0%
uh my organization uh we take complaints
 
03:18:11.790 --> 03:18:11.800 align:start position:0%
from from parents and of students in
 
03:18:13.630 --> 03:18:13.640 align:start position:0%
high schools and middle schools and even
 
03:18:15.630 --> 03:18:15.640 align:start position:0%
elementary schools where where this
 
03:18:17.269 --> 03:18:17.279 align:start position:0%
stuff is creeping in
 
03:18:19.309 --> 03:18:19.319 align:start position:0%
we got a national problem and and uh I
 
03:18:21.309 --> 03:18:21.319 align:start position:0%
want to thank you again for for dealing
 
03:18:22.990 --> 03:18:23.000 align:start position:0%
with it because you can't treat a
 
03:18:24.229 --> 03:18:24.239 align:start position:0%
problem or solve a problem if you don't
 
03:18:26.870 --> 03:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
Define the problem and I'm available for
 
03:18:28.590 --> 03:18:28.600 align:start position:0%
any questions and I have a onepage or
 
03:18:30.229 --> 03:18:30.239 align:start position:0%
fact sheet I can hand out if the
 
03:18:33.830 --> 03:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
chairman wishes sure that's fine um
 
03:18:33.840 --> 03:18:34.790 align:start position:0%
chairman wishes sure that's fine um
representative

03:18:34.790 --> 03:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:18:37.389 --> 03:18:37.399 align:start position:0%
rhs thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
03:18:40.510 --> 03:18:40.520 align:start position:0%
for taking my question if if you don't
 
03:18:44.070 --> 03:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
mind we we received um a letter in
 
03:18:47.670 --> 03:18:47.680 align:start position:0%
opposition from the ACLU and I just
 
03:18:49.150 --> 03:18:49.160 align:start position:0%
wanted to read this as I just want to
 
03:18:50.830 --> 03:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
know if this if this is an opinion that
 
03:18:52.469 --> 03:18:52.479 align:start position:0%
you would have or what or how you would
 
03:18:55.150 --> 03:18:55.160 align:start position:0%
say we could address this um it says if
 
03:18:56.870 --> 03:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
the state were to adopt this definition
 
03:18:58.790 --> 03:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
government officials could likely
 
03:19:00.550 --> 03:19:00.560 align:start position:0%
silence a range of protected speech
 
03:19:02.670 --> 03:19:02.680 align:start position:0%
including criticism of the Israeli
 
03:19:06.110 --> 03:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
government treatment of Palestinians
 
03:19:08.110 --> 03:19:08.120 align:start position:0%
analogies liking Israel policies those
 
03:19:10.229 --> 03:19:10.239 align:start position:0%
of Nazi Germany and it goes on to talk
 
03:19:11.910 --> 03:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
about that um protected whether or not
 
03:19:15.590 --> 03:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
we agree or not do you feel that that
 
03:19:17.870 --> 03:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
that if this is adopted that that indeed
 
03:19:21.030 --> 03:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
will um prohibit protests of somebody
 
03:19:23.269 --> 03:19:23.279 align:start position:0%
that has a disagreement no absolutely
 
03:19:25.269 --> 03:19:25.279 align:start position:0%
not uh I I think it's
 
03:19:28.550 --> 03:19:28.560 align:start position:0%
a I think it's a it's a false claim and
 
03:19:30.910 --> 03:19:30.920 align:start position:0%
and if you read the bill it it clearly
 
03:19:32.990 --> 03:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
says this does not affect freedom of
 
03:19:35.229 --> 03:19:35.239 align:start position:0%
speech that's number one number two the
 
03:19:37.750 --> 03:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
definition itself doesn't even say that
 
03:19:40.150 --> 03:19:40.160 align:start position:0%
criticism of Israel is anti-Semitic in
 
03:19:42.670 --> 03:19:42.680 align:start position:0%
fact among Jewish people engaged with
 
03:19:44.630 --> 03:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
Israel and among Israelis if you go and
 
03:19:46.950 --> 03:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
visit Israel criticism of the government
 
03:19:49.150 --> 03:19:49.160 align:start position:0%
is the national Pastime second only to
 
03:19:52.590 --> 03:19:52.600 align:start position:0%
soccer um so it's not anti-semitic but
 
03:19:54.670 --> 03:19:54.680 align:start position:0%
uh but the definition does point out
 
03:19:57.590 --> 03:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
three ways uh that you can that you can
 
03:20:02.110 --> 03:20:02.120 align:start position:0%
clarify when that criticism goes into
 
03:20:04.389 --> 03:20:04.399 align:start position:0%
anti-Semitism and and those three are
 
03:20:06.070 --> 03:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
are demonization saying Israel is
 
03:20:07.670 --> 03:20:07.680 align:start position:0%
inherently evil double standards
 
03:20:09.229 --> 03:20:09.239 align:start position:0%
applying different standards to Israel
 
03:20:12.150 --> 03:20:12.160 align:start position:0%
than to other countries and uh um and
 
03:20:13.950 --> 03:20:13.960 align:start position:0%
delegitimization saying that Israel
 
03:20:16.389 --> 03:20:16.399 align:start position:0%
alone among all countries has no right
 
03:20:20.590 --> 03:20:20.600 align:start position:0%
to exist Bless but bless um but even
 
03:20:23.189 --> 03:20:23.199 align:start position:0%
still even recognizing that criticism
 
03:20:25.189 --> 03:20:25.199 align:start position:0%
can cross the line into anti-Semitism
 
03:20:28.269 --> 03:20:28.279 align:start position:0%
into Jew hate this bill doesn't doesn't
 
03:20:29.870 --> 03:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
say that you can't do those things you
 
03:20:31.469 --> 03:20:31.479 align:start position:0%
can you can say those things you can say
 
03:20:33.830 --> 03:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
the most hateful things you can keep on
 
03:20:35.389 --> 03:20:35.399 align:start position:0%
saying most hateful things but now if
 
03:20:39.189 --> 03:20:39.199 align:start position:0%
you were to discriminate against someone
 
03:20:40.870 --> 03:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
um in a way that's unlawful under the
 
03:20:42.990 --> 03:20:43.000 align:start position:0%
laws of New Hampshire and you're saying
 
03:20:44.229 --> 03:20:44.239 align:start position:0%
those things and you're discriminating
 
03:20:45.950 --> 03:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
against Jews and someone wants to say
 
03:20:47.830 --> 03:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
well why are you discriminating well we
 
03:20:49.710 --> 03:20:49.720 align:start position:0%
can understand why you're discriminating
 
03:20:53.429 --> 03:20:53.439 align:start position:0%
so um I hope that addresses that
 
03:20:53.439 --> 03:20:55.550 align:start position:0%
so um I hope that addresses that
question

03:20:55.550 --> 03:20:55.560 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:20:58.870 --> 03:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
yeah representative um as a sponsor I'm
 
03:21:00.790 --> 03:21:00.800 align:start position:0%
not going to ask any questions but I am
 
03:21:02.189 --> 03:21:02.199 align:start position:0%
going to ask representative wheeler to
 
03:21:04.710 --> 03:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
re askk his question regarding um inata
 
03:21:07.910 --> 03:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
and its meaning um would this bill would
 
03:21:11.269 --> 03:21:11.279 align:start position:0%
this bill Outlaw the the word antifa or
 
03:21:15.389 --> 03:21:15.399 align:start position:0%
make it or make it um anti-Semitism in
 
03:21:17.750 --> 03:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
and of itself minus context because it's
 
03:21:19.710 --> 03:21:19.720 align:start position:0%
an Arab War yeah mean that that was my
 
03:21:22.469 --> 03:21:22.479 align:start position:0%
question to representative selig was uh
 
03:21:25.870 --> 03:21:25.880 align:start position:0%
the word antifa used in a context I see
 
03:21:27.429 --> 03:21:27.439 align:start position:0%
how that can be hateful but in another
 
03:21:29.510 --> 03:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
context I mean that word means
 
03:21:33.309 --> 03:21:33.319 align:start position:0%
revolution and I think how it's used as
 
03:21:36.469 --> 03:21:36.479 align:start position:0%
important so would this ban the use of
 
03:21:40.349 --> 03:21:40.359 align:start position:0%
the word antifa in that way uh then the
 
03:21:42.429 --> 03:21:42.439 align:start position:0%
chairman asked my question for me
 
03:21:44.790 --> 03:21:44.800 align:start position:0%
but yes Mr chairman representative
 
03:21:47.830 --> 03:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
wheeler um this definition in this bill
 
03:21:49.830 --> 03:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't ban the use of any words it
 
03:21:51.910 --> 03:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't ban the use of that word but
 
03:21:54.710 --> 03:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
let's also understand what the word
 
03:21:57.389 --> 03:21:57.399 align:start position:0%
means revolution not not exactly the
 
03:22:02.630 --> 03:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
first inata in 1987 resulted in 300 Jews
 
03:22:05.269 --> 03:22:05.279 align:start position:0%
lynched or killed in Terror attacks
 
03:22:08.269 --> 03:22:08.279 align:start position:0%
stonings lynchings uh and a couple of
 
03:22:10.990 --> 03:22:11.000 align:start position:0%
thousand wounded injured the second
 
03:22:14.030 --> 03:22:14.040 align:start position:0%
inata that started in 2000 resulted in
 
03:22:16.670 --> 03:22:16.680 align:start position:0%
over 1100 Jews killed one of the the
 
03:22:20.389 --> 03:22:20.399 align:start position:0%
most famous ones um which has
 
03:22:22.830 --> 03:22:22.840 align:start position:0%
been which has been revived in public
 
03:22:24.349 --> 03:22:24.359 align:start position:0%
Consciousness over the last few months
 
03:22:26.710 --> 03:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
with uh on some of these campuses with
 
03:22:29.510 --> 03:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
the bloody red hands where two Israeli
 
03:22:29.520 --> 03:22:30.429 align:start position:0%
the bloody red hands where two Israeli
uh

03:22:30.429 --> 03:22:30.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:22:32.910 --> 03:22:32.920 align:start position:0%
reservists took a wrong turn into rala
 
03:22:35.590 --> 03:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
and the mob took them lynched them
 
03:22:39.070 --> 03:22:39.080 align:start position:0%
dismembered them um cut them up and then
 
03:22:40.710 --> 03:22:40.720 align:start position:0%
stood in the window with bloody hands so
 
03:22:42.830 --> 03:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
you've seen these bloody hand prints on
 
03:22:44.830 --> 03:22:44.840 align:start position:0%
trees and rocks and at the Oscars on
 
03:22:46.870 --> 03:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
some people's pins that's a called to
 
03:22:49.510 --> 03:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
Lynch and and dismember Jews so it's a
 
03:22:51.710 --> 03:22:51.720 align:start position:0%
very violent thing more recent uses of
 
03:22:54.030 --> 03:22:54.040 align:start position:0%
the word inata was the knife stabbing
 
03:22:57.150 --> 03:22:57.160 align:start position:0%
inata um the car ramming inata the
 
03:23:00.550 --> 03:23:00.560 align:start position:0%
ticktock assault inata um I I've never
 
03:23:02.790 --> 03:23:02.800 align:start position:0%
heard the word inata used in a way that
 
03:23:06.189 --> 03:23:06.199 align:start position:0%
didn't call for a lynching and killing
 
03:23:09.229 --> 03:23:09.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:11.990 --> 03:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
Jews thank you further questions oh
 
03:23:17.030 --> 03:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:18.189 --> 03:23:18.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:23:21.590 --> 03:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question um so I can see just
 
03:23:24.469 --> 03:23:24.479 align:start position:0%
by reading the bill about the um doesn't
 
03:23:26.349 --> 03:23:26.359 align:start position:0%
take away free speech because it has a
 
03:23:28.030 --> 03:23:28.040 align:start position:0%
nothing in the subdivision shall be
 
03:23:30.830 --> 03:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
construed as blah blah you go to page
 
03:23:33.150 --> 03:23:33.160 align:start position:0%
two in the bill there are then several
 
03:23:35.950 --> 03:23:35.960 align:start position:0%
other nothing in the subdivision shall
 
03:23:38.750 --> 03:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
be deemed as doing this that and the
 
03:23:40.830 --> 03:23:40.840 align:start position:0%
other thing could you is there one of
 
03:23:43.110 --> 03:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
them that supports what you just said
 
03:23:45.630 --> 03:23:45.640 align:start position:0%
about it this does not exclude the use
 
03:23:47.110 --> 03:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
of the word in
 
03:23:49.189 --> 03:23:49.199 align:start position:0%
in I couldn't even spell it so I
 
03:23:52.630 --> 03:23:52.640 align:start position:0%
couldn't look it up in um it doesn't it
 
03:23:54.910 --> 03:23:54.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't it doesn't create any speech
 
03:23:56.710 --> 03:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
code at all nowhere in this bill is
 
03:23:57.830 --> 03:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
there a speech
 
03:24:01.990 --> 03:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
code people can say Jews intermarrying
 
03:24:03.750 --> 03:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
is polluting our blood you know we've
 
03:24:06.710 --> 03:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
seen that one around and uh and and Jews
 
03:24:09.830 --> 03:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
are evil marxists bringing communism to
 
03:24:11.429 --> 03:24:11.439 align:start position:0%
America and Jews are evil capitalists
 
03:24:12.790 --> 03:24:12.800 align:start position:0%
bringing capitalism and all the
 
03:24:14.429 --> 03:24:14.439 align:start position:0%
conspiracy theories and Jews control the
 
03:24:17.510 --> 03:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
weather and Jews control the media um
 
03:24:19.389 --> 03:24:19.399 align:start position:0%
none of that none of that is affected in
 
03:24:22.070 --> 03:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
terms of free speech so the protesters
 
03:24:24.030 --> 03:24:24.040 align:start position:0%
can can go with their signs saying all
 
03:24:26.189 --> 03:24:26.199 align:start position:0%
their hateful things but if they then
 
03:24:28.309 --> 03:24:28.319 align:start position:0%
stand at the at the gates of the campus
 
03:24:30.309 --> 03:24:30.319 align:start position:0%
like they've been doing at UCLA like
 
03:24:31.750 --> 03:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
they've been doing at Colombia and
 
03:24:34.229 --> 03:24:34.239 align:start position:0%
saying if you're a Jew you can't pass
 
03:24:35.830 --> 03:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
you can't go into the library you can't
 
03:24:38.070 --> 03:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
come into the campus you can't go to
 
03:24:40.349 --> 03:24:40.359 align:start position:0%
your class you can't oh if you're a
 
03:24:42.910 --> 03:24:42.920 align:start position:0%
Jewish Professor you can't speak at our
 
03:24:45.510 --> 03:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
school um then you're getting into
 
03:24:47.870 --> 03:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
discrimination and if those people are
 
03:24:49.750 --> 03:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
holding these signs and and you're
 
03:24:51.110 --> 03:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
saying well I don't understand the
 
03:24:52.950 --> 03:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
Discrimination this is all so confusing
 
03:24:54.229 --> 03:24:54.239 align:start position:0%
here's a definition to help you
 
03:24:55.510 --> 03:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
understand it are they stopped from
 
03:24:57.790 --> 03:24:57.800 align:start position:0%
saying it no their their freedom of
 
03:24:59.790 --> 03:24:59.800 align:start position:0%
speech is there but their freedom to
 
03:25:02.990 --> 03:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
Breaking the Law unlawful acts is that's
 
03:25:04.429 --> 03:25:04.439 align:start position:0%
not freedom of speech that's not first
 
03:25:07.590 --> 03:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you
 
03:25:10.349 --> 03:25:10.359 align:start position:0%
yeah questions um representative scitec
 
03:25:13.510 --> 03:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
interrup M um this is uh not right on
 
03:25:15.630 --> 03:25:15.640 align:start position:0%
the bill let me but I'd like to ask this
 
03:25:18.670 --> 03:25:18.680 align:start position:0%
because of you're naal experience the
 
03:25:20.150 --> 03:25:20.160 align:start position:0%
events of the
 
03:25:25.070 --> 03:25:25.080 align:start position:0%
past months alarm me because is
 
03:25:27.429 --> 03:25:27.439 align:start position:0%
anti-Semitism on the rise or is it just
 
03:25:30.269 --> 03:25:30.279 align:start position:0%
being revealed what is your sense of
 
03:25:31.590 --> 03:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
that if I may
 
03:25:35.269 --> 03:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
ask yeah that's a that's a good question
 
03:25:39.630 --> 03:25:39.640 align:start position:0%
um I think it's a I think it's
 
03:25:41.950 --> 03:25:41.960 align:start position:0%
both I think there's a few there's a
 
03:25:45.349 --> 03:25:45.359 align:start position:0%
there's a few streams uh going on here
 
03:25:48.550 --> 03:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
um one the the attack of October 7th was
 
03:25:51.150 --> 03:25:51.160 align:start position:0%
so bloody and
 
03:25:51.160 --> 03:25:53.349 align:start position:0%
so bloody and
horrific

03:25:53.349 --> 03:25:53.359 align:start position:0%
horrific
 
03:25:57.030 --> 03:25:57.040 align:start position:0%
um 1,00 people killed
 
03:26:00.110 --> 03:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
horrible genital mutilations of women
 
03:26:02.429 --> 03:26:02.439 align:start position:0%
infanticide of babies in the most
 
03:26:06.910 --> 03:26:06.920 align:start position:0%
horrible ways um Mass gang rapes of of
 
03:26:10.910 --> 03:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
hundreds of women hostages taken many of
 
03:26:13.429 --> 03:26:13.439 align:start position:0%
the ones who were returned came back
 
03:26:15.309 --> 03:26:15.319 align:start position:0%
pregnant impregnated by their rapists
 
03:26:16.870 --> 03:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
one of them
 
03:26:20.830 --> 03:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
was tested with uh had 76 different DNA
 
03:26:22.429 --> 03:26:22.439 align:start position:0%
specimens in her she had been gang rap
 
03:26:24.830 --> 03:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
by 76 people and the people who hate
 
03:26:29.670 --> 03:26:29.680 align:start position:0%
Jews already see these horrible things
 
03:26:32.590 --> 03:26:32.600 align:start position:0%
and and it's like a mob mentality comes
 
03:26:34.870 --> 03:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
out the victims down the victims being
 
03:26:37.389 --> 03:26:37.399 align:start position:0%
pummeled the victims being beat up and
 
03:26:39.070 --> 03:26:39.080 align:start position:0%
and cut
 
03:26:41.750 --> 03:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
and and so they come out and they feel
 
03:26:41.760 --> 03:26:42.910 align:start position:0%
and and so they come out and they feel
they

03:26:42.910 --> 03:26:42.920 align:start position:0%
they
 
03:26:45.590 --> 03:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
feel allowed to say the things that
 
03:26:47.269 --> 03:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
they've been keeping to
 
03:26:49.309 --> 03:26:49.319 align:start position:0%
themselves I think that's a big part of
 
03:26:51.630 --> 03:26:51.640 align:start position:0%
what's going on another thing that's
 
03:26:53.870 --> 03:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
going on is there are people who have
 
03:26:56.790 --> 03:26:56.800 align:start position:0%
been committed to demonizing and and
 
03:26:58.910 --> 03:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
delegitimizing and destroying Israel for
 
03:27:01.389 --> 03:27:01.399 align:start position:0%
years and these protests have created an
 
03:27:02.950 --> 03:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity you notice at all these
 
03:27:04.950 --> 03:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
campuses everyone has these matching
 
03:27:07.030 --> 03:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
tents there's someone with a deep
 
03:27:08.349 --> 03:27:08.359 align:start position:0%
pocketbook that's paying for all those
 
03:27:10.910 --> 03:27:10.920 align:start position:0%
tents because if you ever go to a if you
 
03:27:12.630 --> 03:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
ever go to a park or you ever go to a
 
03:27:14.269 --> 03:27:14.279 align:start position:0%
concert and people bring their tents
 
03:27:15.510 --> 03:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
everyone's tents is from a different
 
03:27:16.790 --> 03:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
year a different decade a different
 
03:27:18.189 --> 03:27:18.199 align:start position:0%
store they're different colors different
 
03:27:19.830 --> 03:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
shapes and sizes but you look at
 
03:27:21.189 --> 03:27:21.199 align:start position:0%
Columbia and you look at Yale and you
 
03:27:23.030 --> 03:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
look at UCLA and they're all the exact
 
03:27:23.040 --> 03:27:23.950 align:start position:0%
look at UCLA and they're all the exact
same

03:27:23.950 --> 03:27:23.960 align:start position:0%
same
 
03:27:27.630 --> 03:27:27.640 align:start position:0%
model um so you've got some people
 
03:27:30.110 --> 03:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
funding and pushing it and you've got
 
03:27:31.510 --> 03:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
professional agitators and
 
03:27:33.110 --> 03:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
revolutionaries joining it because they
 
03:27:35.030 --> 03:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
see it as a way to tear down the west
 
03:27:38.110 --> 03:27:38.120 align:start position:0%
and they you know the the chant of uh
 
03:27:40.309 --> 03:27:40.319 align:start position:0%
the chant of both Iran and and the huies
 
03:27:43.469 --> 03:27:43.479 align:start position:0%
from Yemen is death to America death to
 
03:27:45.870 --> 03:27:45.880 align:start position:0%
Israel and and among the houthis they
 
03:27:47.389 --> 03:27:47.399 align:start position:0%
also add death to the
 
03:27:50.070 --> 03:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
Jews um so that's another factor and
 
03:27:52.150 --> 03:27:52.160 align:start position:0%
then and then a third Factor going into
 
03:27:54.750 --> 03:27:54.760 align:start position:0%
this is you've got a lot of young people
 
03:27:57.830 --> 03:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
in America um and at college campuses
 
03:28:01.910 --> 03:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
and even at Ivy ivy league schools who
 
03:28:04.710 --> 03:28:04.720 align:start position:0%
um who don't understand basic American
 
03:28:07.630 --> 03:28:07.640 align:start position:0%
values and morals and uh and they were
 
03:28:11.070 --> 03:28:11.080 align:start position:0%
raised thinking that that somehow
 
03:28:12.269 --> 03:28:12.279 align:start position:0%
there's something good about being a
 
03:28:15.070 --> 03:28:15.080 align:start position:0%
revolutionary well maybe when there's
 
03:28:16.910 --> 03:28:16.920 align:start position:0%
oppression or tyranny
 
03:28:19.229 --> 03:28:19.239 align:start position:0%
uh yeah but they're joining in because
 
03:28:21.389 --> 03:28:21.399 align:start position:0%
they don't know any better so I mean
 
03:28:23.389 --> 03:28:23.399 align:start position:0%
you've seen that too in in interviews of
 
03:28:25.309 --> 03:28:25.319 align:start position:0%
these protesters where journalists come
 
03:28:27.510 --> 03:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
and ask them tell me what you know about
 
03:28:28.950 --> 03:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
Israel and Palestine when did you start
 
03:28:32.070 --> 03:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
following this and and you'll see kids
 
03:28:34.590 --> 03:28:34.600 align:start position:0%
say actually I don't know too much and
 
03:28:36.070 --> 03:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
I'm just here because I I want to do the
 
03:28:38.309 --> 03:28:38.319 align:start position:0%
right thing but I don't know who's who I
 
03:28:40.389 --> 03:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
don't know what's I mean I see it in
 
03:28:42.710 --> 03:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
frankly I've read the resolutions that
 
03:28:44.429 --> 03:28:44.439 align:start position:0%
are being passed around and these are
 
03:28:47.389 --> 03:28:47.399 align:start position:0%
organized through National organizations
 
03:28:48.870 --> 03:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
and international organizations the
 
03:28:52.389 --> 03:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
resolutions on college campuses about
 
03:28:55.950 --> 03:28:55.960 align:start position:0%
colonialism and uh and and uh indigenous
 
03:28:58.389 --> 03:28:58.399 align:start position:0%
rights and and you go through all of the
 
03:29:00.950 --> 03:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh the Preamble and the whereases and
 
03:29:03.269 --> 03:29:03.279 align:start position:0%
there's like a complete denial of even
 
03:29:06.030 --> 03:29:06.040 align:start position:0%
Jewish identity and Jewish history and
 
03:29:07.830 --> 03:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
they don't understand who Israel is they
 
03:29:10.030 --> 03:29:10.040 align:start position:0%
don't understand who the players are at
 
03:29:12.830 --> 03:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
all I mean Jews with a 4,000 year old
 
03:29:16.750 --> 03:29:16.760 align:start position:0%
history in Israel uh 100 years ago at
 
03:29:18.070 --> 03:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
the end of World War I there was a
 
03:29:21.349 --> 03:29:21.359 align:start position:0%
movement to to to get rid of imperialism
 
03:29:23.630 --> 03:29:23.640 align:start position:0%
and colonialism and create indigenous
 
03:29:26.870 --> 03:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
rights and local rights and Israel uh
 
03:29:28.429 --> 03:29:28.439 align:start position:0%
was created out of that a lot of people
 
03:29:31.110 --> 03:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
look at 1948 the actual Independence but
 
03:29:33.150 --> 03:29:33.160 align:start position:0%
it started in 1920 with the Sano
 
03:29:36.309 --> 03:29:36.319 align:start position:0%
conference uh the Ottoman Empire gave up
 
03:29:38.830 --> 03:29:38.840 align:start position:0%
uh a vast Empire and it was divvied up
 
03:29:40.870 --> 03:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
to give Independence to indigenous
 
03:29:43.309 --> 03:29:43.319 align:start position:0%
groups now you've got college kids
 
03:29:45.510 --> 03:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
saying the Jews are somehow colonialists
 
03:29:47.429 --> 03:29:47.439 align:start position:0%
because some of them lived in Morocco
 
03:29:49.990 --> 03:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
and Algeria and Tunisia and Russia and
 
03:29:52.750 --> 03:29:52.760 align:start position:0%
and uh and so they use this language of
 
03:29:54.830 --> 03:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
colonialism when really it was a a
 
03:29:56.349 --> 03:29:56.359 align:start position:0%
restoration of Jewish sovereignty that's
 
03:29:57.630 --> 03:29:57.640 align:start position:0%
the language that was used by the League
 
03:30:00.550 --> 03:30:00.560 align:start position:0%
of Nations a restoration of uh of
 
03:30:02.110 --> 03:30:02.120 align:start position:0%
sovereignty for the indigenous people of
 
03:30:05.229 --> 03:30:05.239 align:start position:0%
Israel and and uh
 
03:30:07.830 --> 03:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
so so where's this anti-Semitism coming
 
03:30:09.429 --> 03:30:09.439 align:start position:0%
from some of its some of its ignorance
 
03:30:12.110 --> 03:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
and people getting on the bandwagon and
 
03:30:15.590 --> 03:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
then and then there's also funding that
 
03:30:19.510 --> 03:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
is good going you know right now um to
 
03:30:22.189 --> 03:30:22.199 align:start position:0%
the Palestinian
 
03:30:25.870 --> 03:30:25.880 align:start position:0%
Authority that's being funel to uh to
 
03:30:27.830 --> 03:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
anti-semitic groups in America and
 
03:30:30.510 --> 03:30:30.520 align:start position:0%
Europe to to push these narratives so
 
03:30:32.510 --> 03:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
there is this there is
 
03:30:35.510 --> 03:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
this you know this false narrative going
 
03:30:38.150 --> 03:30:38.160 align:start position:0%
on kids don't even know they don't even
 
03:30:40.349 --> 03:30:40.359 align:start position:0%
know who the players are much less who's
 
03:30:41.750 --> 03:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
right and who's
 
03:30:44.790 --> 03:30:44.800 align:start position:0%
wrong thank you for that um informed
 
03:30:47.710 --> 03:30:47.720 align:start position:0%
answer and I suppose that would make
 
03:30:50.710 --> 03:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
Catholic Bishops colonialists in uh in
 
03:30:55.110 --> 03:30:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:58.830 --> 03:30:58.840 align:start position:0%
Muse thank you um in in our state we
 
03:31:02.229 --> 03:31:02.239 align:start position:0%
have uh an enhanced penalty uh for
 
03:31:04.150 --> 03:31:04.160 align:start position:0%
somebody who actually commits an act
 
03:31:07.429 --> 03:31:07.439 align:start position:0%
which is found to be a hate crime um
 
03:31:10.229 --> 03:31:10.239 align:start position:0%
what are you hoping that the adoption of
 
03:31:12.469 --> 03:31:12.479 align:start position:0%
this definition achieves when it comes
 
03:31:17.510 --> 03:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
to prosecution of crimes like that
 
03:31:19.710 --> 03:31:19.720 align:start position:0%
so in in this particular bill I think
 
03:31:21.429 --> 03:31:21.439 align:start position:0%
it's written just for anti-semitic
 
03:31:23.750 --> 03:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
discrimination not for hate crimes but
 
03:31:25.550 --> 03:31:25.560 align:start position:0%
um you could do that as well a number of
 
03:31:29.830 --> 03:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
states have um and
 
03:31:33.429 --> 03:31:33.439 align:start position:0%
uh you know once again if if the uh if
 
03:31:35.150 --> 03:31:35.160 align:start position:0%
the definition is adopted for that
 
03:31:37.429 --> 03:31:37.439 align:start position:0%
purpose it wouldn't be creating a new
 
03:31:39.630 --> 03:31:39.640 align:start position:0%
class it wouldn't be creating a new law
 
03:31:42.469 --> 03:31:42.479 align:start position:0%
it would just be about accurate
 
03:31:45.990 --> 03:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
application of uh of the law in the case
 
03:31:52.389 --> 03:31:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:55.110 --> 03:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
acts thank you any further
 
03:31:57.429 --> 03:31:57.439 align:start position:0%

03:44:59.710 --> 03:44:59.720 align:start position:0%
with that I am opening the executive
 
03:45:03.110 --> 03:45:03.120 align:start position:0%
session on Senate Bill 508 and I
 
03:45:04.950 --> 03:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
recognize representative Muse to make a
 
03:45:09.710 --> 03:45:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:12.149 --> 03:45:12.159 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you Mr chair uh this is
 
03:45:13.590 --> 03:45:13.600 align:start position:0%
not the amendment we were just talking
 
03:45:14.990 --> 03:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
about this is an amendment to the
 
03:45:17.189 --> 03:45:17.199 align:start position:0%
original Bill uh that Senator Whitley
 
03:45:20.670 --> 03:45:20.680 align:start position:0%
asked us to put in uh in the original
 
03:45:22.830 --> 03:45:22.840 align:start position:0%
Bill one of the things uh that uh they
 
03:45:27.429 --> 03:45:27.439 align:start position:0%
neglected to do was to include um uh uh
 
03:45:30.510 --> 03:45:30.520 align:start position:0%
let me see what is the word the uh exact
 
03:45:32.429 --> 03:45:32.439 align:start position:0%
wording for that uh I think it's
 
03:45:35.510 --> 03:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
Certified Recovery workers uh as part of
 
03:45:38.110 --> 03:45:38.120 align:start position:0%
the uh part of the scope of the bill so
 
03:45:40.349 --> 03:45:40.359 align:start position:0%
that's what the amendment effectively
 
03:45:45.229 --> 03:45:45.239 align:start position:0%
does uh and I ask you to support it
 
03:45:48.349 --> 03:45:48.359 align:start position:0%
is there a second just second by
 
03:45:51.630 --> 03:45:51.640 align:start position:0%
representative right
 
03:45:54.790 --> 03:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
um that's correct the sponsor if
 
03:45:56.630 --> 03:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
everyone recalls um at the end of her
 
03:45:58.189 --> 03:45:58.199 align:start position:0%
testimony told us there was an amendment
 
03:46:00.070 --> 03:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
because they forgot to add a group
 
03:46:02.830 --> 03:46:02.840 align:start position:0%
that's all this is as a quick correction
 
03:46:02.840 --> 03:46:04.189 align:start position:0%
that's all this is as a quick correction
any

03:46:04.189 --> 03:46:04.199 align:start position:0%
any
 
03:46:06.309 --> 03:46:06.319 align:start position:0%

anyone wants to we we discussed it we
 
03:47:45.110 --> 03:47:45.120 align:start position:0%
heard the hearing in the testimony what
 
03:47:47.070 --> 03:47:47.080 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler apologies Mr
 
03:47:48.269 --> 03:47:48.279 align:start position:0%
chairman I just wanted to say I'll be
 
03:47:50.550 --> 03:47:50.560 align:start position:0%
voting for this amendment but I do have
 
03:47:52.630 --> 03:47:52.640 align:start position:0%
some reservations that I'll be following
 
03:47:55.349 --> 03:47:55.359 align:start position:0%
up on talking to the people who have
 
03:47:57.990 --> 03:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
stakeholders about it and the ACLU who
 
03:48:01.149 --> 03:48:01.159 align:start position:0%
issued opposition to it um I I am
 
03:48:04.149 --> 03:48:04.159 align:start position:0%
concerned that we
 
03:48:06.469 --> 03:48:06.479 align:start position:0%
sweepingly make criticism of the nation
 
03:48:10.349 --> 03:48:10.359 align:start position:0%
of Israel um not the people of Israel
 
03:48:12.830 --> 03:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
not the the Jews but the the nation of
 
03:48:17.110 --> 03:48:17.120 align:start position:0%
Israel uh illegal under this and I I I I
 
03:48:20.590 --> 03:48:20.600 align:start position:0%
do have concerns about that because um I
 
03:48:22.870 --> 03:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
think you know we ALS I think most of us
 
03:48:24.429 --> 03:48:24.439 align:start position:0%
here in this table support Israel's
 
03:48:27.110 --> 03:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
right to exist but are concerned with
 
03:48:28.309 --> 03:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
the current government and how it's
 
03:48:31.630 --> 03:48:31.640 align:start position:0%
treating people in the Gaza Strip and I
 
03:48:34.030 --> 03:48:34.040 align:start position:0%
think that's why how uh there's so much
 
03:48:35.910 --> 03:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
concern in the in the country right now
 
03:48:39.149 --> 03:48:39.159 align:start position:0%
about that um so yeah I just had to say
 
03:48:41.229 --> 03:48:41.239 align:start position:0%
that I I I will vote for the amendment
 
03:48:44.910 --> 03:48:44.920 align:start position:0%
right here I am concerned about
 
03:48:46.870 --> 03:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
how it moves forward how broad it is I'm
 
03:48:48.070 --> 03:48:48.080 align:start position:0%
I'm always concerned when we get an
 
03:48:50.710 --> 03:48:50.720 align:start position:0%
amendment uh right beforehand but uh I
 
03:48:52.229 --> 03:48:52.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for putting it together I
 
03:48:54.070 --> 03:48:54.080 align:start position:0%
stand with the Jewish Community against
 
03:48:55.710 --> 03:48:55.720 align:start position:0%
hate I stand with the Arab Community
 
03:48:57.590 --> 03:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
against hate uh and I want to make sure
 
03:49:00.429 --> 03:49:00.439 align:start position:0%
that we get a situation in which that
 
03:49:02.229 --> 03:49:02.239 align:start position:0%
can work out so thank you for Miss
 
03:49:05.229 --> 03:49:05.239 align:start position:0%
letting me thank you and I would point
 
03:49:08.070 --> 03:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
out um just for the record this does not
 
03:49:10.469 --> 03:49:10.479 align:start position:0%
Outlaw any language whatsoever it just
 
03:49:15.030 --> 03:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
says this is a definition of a behavior
 
03:49:17.790 --> 03:49:17.800 align:start position:0%
that when applied to an illegal act
 
03:49:21.070 --> 03:49:21.080 align:start position:0%
would constitute a hate crime or
 
03:49:23.910 --> 03:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
discrimination but the language itself
 
03:49:26.149 --> 03:49:26.159 align:start position:0%
regardless of how it's put makes no law
 
03:49:28.990 --> 03:49:29.000 align:start position:0%
no statements illegal um it just
 
03:49:30.710 --> 03:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
provides a definition for
 
03:49:33.429 --> 03:49:33.439 align:start position:0%
context um but I I
 
03:49:36.510 --> 03:49:36.520 align:start position:0%
agree further
 
03:49:39.070 --> 03:49:39.080 align:start position:0%
comments wow
 
03:49:46.189 --> 03:49:46.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:48.269 --> 03:49:48.279 align:start position:0%
yes we can one's a one's a non-gain
 
03:49:49.870 --> 03:49:49.880 align:start position:0%
Amendment and one is the amendment to
 
03:49:51.590 --> 03:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
the bill we've already adopted the
 
03:49:56.750 --> 03:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:59.670 --> 03:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you representative Stone
 
03:50:01.790 --> 03:50:01.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and I think the uh
 
03:50:05.070 --> 03:50:05.080 align:start position:0%
efforts are apparently uh very well
 
03:50:07.070 --> 03:50:07.080 align:start position:0%
thought out that we need to standardize
 
03:50:08.750 --> 03:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
the uh definition and it's a prudent
 
03:50:10.510 --> 03:50:10.520 align:start position:0%
measure that I fully
 
03:50:15.550 --> 03:50:15.560 align:start position:0%
support thank you further represent
 
03:50:18.229 --> 03:50:18.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just would say um I
 
03:50:19.750 --> 03:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate your having brought this
 
03:50:21.389 --> 03:50:21.399 align:start position:0%
forward and I would have loved to have
 
03:50:23.030 --> 03:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
had the opportunity to co-sponsor it
 
03:50:24.750 --> 03:50:24.760 align:start position:0%
with you initially and I'm happy to be
 
03:50:27.309 --> 03:50:27.319 align:start position:0%
the second on it now oh yeah absolutely
 
03:50:29.269 --> 03:50:29.279 align:start position:0%
and had I had more time myself I would
 
03:50:31.590 --> 03:50:31.600 align:start position:0%
have included you in it um this was
 
03:50:34.349 --> 03:50:34.359 align:start position:0%
brought to my attention fairly recently
 
03:50:36.630 --> 03:50:36.640 align:start position:0%
and um I felt that it was very important
 
03:50:39.910 --> 03:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
to get it in while we were all here so
 
03:50:41.149 --> 03:50:41.159 align:start position:0%
that being said without further
 
03:50:42.510 --> 03:50:42.520 align:start position:0%
discussion I would ask the clerk to call
 
03:50:43.950 --> 03:50:43.960 align:start position:0%
the role the motion on the floor is
 
03:50:46.269 --> 03:50:46.279 align:start position:0%

03:51:00.790 --> 03:51:00.800 align:start position:0%

03:51:03.309 --> 03:51:03.319 align:start position:0%

03:51:04.750 --> 03:51:04.760 align:start position:0%

second Mr chairman
 
03:54:08.670 --> 03:54:08.680 align:start position:0%
uh I read
 
03:54:15.349 --> 03:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
the um fiscal note for Senate Bill 508
 
03:54:19.389 --> 03:54:19.399 align:start position:0%
and it it raised the concern uh for me
 
03:54:22.469 --> 03:54:22.479 align:start position:0%
and so I can't support the Senate bill
 
03:54:25.950 --> 03:54:25.960 align:start position:0%
and I'll tell you why um this is uh
 
03:54:28.750 --> 03:54:28.760 align:start position:0%
going to cause an indeterminable
 
03:54:33.149 --> 03:54:33.159 align:start position:0%
increase in expenditures by the uh
 
03:54:35.590 --> 03:54:35.600 align:start position:0%
counties and I'm going to read article
 
03:54:38.790 --> 03:54:38.800 align:start position:0%
28a one more time the state shall not
 
03:54:40.630 --> 03:54:40.640 align:start position:0%
mandate or assign any new expanded or
 
03:54:42.630 --> 03:54:42.640 align:start position:0%
modified programs or responsibilities to
 
03:54:45.070 --> 03:54:45.080 align:start position:0%
any political subdivision which the
 
03:54:47.469 --> 03:54:47.479 align:start position:0%
county is in such a way as to
 
03:54:49.110 --> 03:54:49.120 align:start position:0%
necessitate additional local
 
03:54:50.389 --> 03:54:50.399 align:start position:0%
expenditures by the political
 
03:54:52.710 --> 03:54:52.720 align:start position:0%
subdivision unless such programs or
 
03:54:54.510 --> 03:54:54.520 align:start position:0%
responsibilities are fully funded by the
 
03:54:57.429 --> 03:54:57.439 align:start position:0%
state or such programs or
 
03:54:59.070 --> 03:54:59.080 align:start position:0%
responsibilities are approved by for
 
03:55:00.349 --> 03:55:00.359 align:start position:0%
funding by a vote of the local
 
03:55:02.349 --> 03:55:02.359 align:start position:0%
legislative body of the political
 
03:55:04.870 --> 03:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
subdivision I will note that as a state
 
03:55:08.469 --> 03:55:08.479 align:start position:0%
representative I am the legislative body
 
03:55:10.030 --> 03:55:10.040 align:start position:0%
of the political subdivision of the
 
03:55:12.349 --> 03:55:12.359 align:start position:0%
County uh we have had no such vote in
 
03:55:14.309 --> 03:55:14.319 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County so I can't support the
 
03:55:17.429 --> 03:55:17.439 align:start position:0%
to bill because of that fiscal note and
 
03:55:22.510 --> 03:55:22.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:25.990 --> 03:55:26.000 align:start position:0%

finance committee that indeterminant
 
03:55:38.710 --> 03:55:38.720 align:start position:0%
usually means a small increase that
 
03:55:40.670 --> 03:55:40.680 align:start position:0%

03:55:42.670 --> 03:55:42.680 align:start position:0%
