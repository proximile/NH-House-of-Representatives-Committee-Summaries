00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
out get back to
 
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:50.880 align:start position:0%

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
because of a conflict some have in the
 
00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.110 align:start position:0%
because of a conflict some have in the
morning

00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:09:01.069 --> 00:09:01.079 align:start position:0%
DHHS Commissioners up date and the chair
 
00:09:07.069 --> 00:09:07.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:13.240 align:start position:0%
afternoon that was fast it usually takes
 
00:09:14.949 --> 00:09:14.959 align:start position:0%
a little longer to get through the
 
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
meeting minutes I was thought I had more
 
00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:20.440 align:start position:0%
time thank you for for having me I have
 
00:09:23.509 --> 00:09:23.519 align:start position:0%
a little bit of a um I guess a variety
 
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
of updates for you today uh focusing on
 
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
some things that maybe we haven't talked
 
00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:28.680 align:start position:0%
about in a little a little while and one
 
00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:31.800 align:start position:0%
of those would be uh retention or uh
 
00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
vacancy rates so I think I believe might
 
00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:36.360 align:start position:0%
have been beginning of this calendar
 
00:09:39.069 --> 00:09:39.079 align:start position:0%
year or maybe a year ago um I sat before
 
00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:40.360 align:start position:0%
you and talked about some of the
 
00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
challenges we had with with recruiting
 
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:46.720 align:start position:0%
um we I am proud to let you know that we
 
00:09:49.829 --> 00:09:49.839 align:start position:0%
actually are uh improving our vacancy
 
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:52.360 align:start position:0%
rate about a year ago was about
 
00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
19.6% and we're down to about
 
00:09:59.150 --> 00:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
17.2% so you know that's you know
 
00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
roughly we have about roughly about 2700
 
00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:04.760 align:start position:0%
positions filled a little less than that
 
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
when we were at about 2500 so we'll
 
00:10:09.069 --> 00:10:09.079 align:start position:0%
always have constant attrition
 
00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
especially with some of our Direct Care
 
00:10:12.949 --> 00:10:12.959 align:start position:0%
Services but we're making uh gains in
 
00:10:14.829 --> 00:10:14.839 align:start position:0%
the right direction so we've gotten some
 
00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:17.640 align:start position:0%
new recruitment tools uh software tools
 
00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:19.640 align:start position:0%
working with the division of personnel
 
00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:23.320 align:start position:0%
having um really innovative ways to get
 
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
out and get the word out what type of
 
00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
jobs we have um and what people would be
 
00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:29.839 align:start position:0%
eligible for so we're going to keep
 
00:10:31.829 --> 00:10:31.839 align:start position:0%
marching in that direction um it's part
 
00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
of our road map for the Department we'll
 
00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:37.240 align:start position:0%
continue um into next year and Beyond of
 
00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:39.240 align:start position:0%
having Workforce be a priority and be a
 
00:10:42.069 --> 00:10:42.079 align:start position:0%
goal so so that's good
 
00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:44.600 align:start position:0%
news and the other SC of good news is
 
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
that I recently um nominated Marissa hen
 
00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:49.800 align:start position:0%
to be Deputy Commissioner of the
 
00:10:51.509 --> 00:10:51.519 align:start position:0%
department and it was confirmed by the
 
00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:53.720 align:start position:0%
council about three or four weeks ago so
 
00:10:55.389 --> 00:10:55.399 align:start position:0%
Marissa hen who was an associate
 
00:10:56.949 --> 00:10:56.959 align:start position:0%
commissioner is now the Deputy
 
00:10:58.790 --> 00:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of the department and it's
 
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
great to have a deputy I haven't had one
 
00:11:03.389 --> 00:11:03.399 align:start position:0%
for a year so um happy about that and we
 
00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
will be we are actively recruiting to
 
00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
backfill for that associate commissioner
 
00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:10.360 align:start position:0%
position so at that point I'll hopefully
 
00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
have a full Senior Team to start the new
 
00:11:17.949 --> 00:11:17.959 align:start position:0%
year and lastly I just wanted to update
 
00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
you we talk a lot about all of the
 
00:11:21.949 --> 00:11:21.959 align:start position:0%
things that are happening um and there's
 
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
a lot in the department as we know every
 
00:11:25.509 --> 00:11:25.519 align:start position:0%
single day there's something happening
 
00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:27.800 align:start position:0%
but there's actually some construction
 
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
happening on our campus and it's been um
 
00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
on time and is is coming along if you
 
00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:35.160 align:start position:0%
happen to work at New Hampshire hospital
 
00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:37.240 align:start position:0%
you are constantly reminded by the
 
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
drills and the pounding that there is a
 
00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
forensic hospital going up right next to
 
00:11:43.629 --> 00:11:43.639 align:start position:0%
the hospital so that has been steady uh
 
00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:46.200 align:start position:0%
steady build and they're on time as of
 
00:11:48.829 --> 00:11:48.839 align:start position:0%
as of this point in time knock on wood
 
00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:51.680 align:start position:0%
um so that when is the expected opening
 
00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:53.320 align:start position:0%
date or hope I believe it's the summer
 
00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:55.949 align:start position:0%
date or hope I believe it's the summer
of

00:11:55.949 --> 00:11:55.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:59.389 --> 00:11:59.399 align:start position:0%
25 and then in addition we have also
 
00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
been doing some Renovations on what we
 
00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:04.200 align:start position:0%
call our enf unit within the hospital
 
00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
which is the 35 beds that have been
 
00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
offline for various reasons over the
 
00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:10.760 align:start position:0%
last couple of years and that cons
 
00:12:12.629 --> 00:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
renovation will be complete probably
 
00:12:14.189 --> 00:12:14.199 align:start position:0%
towards the end of January and we'll
 
00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:16.240 align:start position:0%
start to bring those beds back online
 
00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:18.680 align:start position:0%
which will hopefully have an impact at
 
00:12:20.509 --> 00:12:20.519 align:start position:0%
least for a point in time on our Ed
 
00:12:23.829 --> 00:12:23.839 align:start position:0%
boarding weight list so um we've been uh
 
00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:26.120 align:start position:0%
actively recruiting nurses uh we still
 
00:12:28.389 --> 00:12:28.399 align:start position:0%
have the majority of nurses at New
 
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital hital are still
 
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
agency n nurses but we are hiring
 
00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:33.880 align:start position:0%
full-time nurses as well so we're making
 
00:12:37.069 --> 00:12:37.079 align:start position:0%
gains in that direction um as well so I
 
00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
think I promis to only bring good news
 
00:12:42.069 --> 00:12:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:44.629 --> 00:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
list any
 
00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
questions on the good news list
 
00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:49.480 align:start position:0%

between coin Greek and classical Greek
 
00:14:04.069 --> 00:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
and I lost thank you for coming well our
 
00:14:05.389 --> 00:14:05.399 align:start position:0%
our name was changed when my
 
00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:07.160 align:start position:0%
great-grandfather came to Ellis Island
 
00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:08.600 align:start position:0%
he was speaking Greek and that's what
 
00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
they wrote down so that became our last
 
00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:13.880 align:start position:0%
name and that's how he was very blessed
 
00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:16.040 align:start position:0%
that it just didn't become
 
00:14:20.629 --> 00:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:25.269 --> 00:14:25.279 align:start position:0%
yeah okay um so good afternoon um I
 
00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:30.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate the time um I did send um
 
00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
a um a handout I don't know if everyone
 
00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
has it I just want to make sure
 
00:14:40.629 --> 00:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
no it was sent electronically but I do
 
00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
well what's going
 
00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
on so I'll wait till everyone has it to
 
00:14:57.790 --> 00:14:57.800 align:start position:0%
go into detail but um this doesn't
 
00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
include every detail in the complaint
 
00:15:01.829 --> 00:15:01.839 align:start position:0%
process but I think it's a good sort of
 
00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:03.800 align:start position:0%
overview and a good place to kind of
 
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
start the
 
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
discussion oh I have more
 
00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
here all right so what you have before
 
00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:16.600 align:start position:0%
you is basically a flowchart
 
00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:20.680 align:start position:0%
illustrating the post HB 655 and HP 409
 
00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement process not only for Board
 
00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:25.320 align:start position:0%
of Medicine but other boards as well um
 
00:15:27.269 --> 00:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
and this is for non-emergency
 
00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
matters so a complaint if alleges
 
00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:31.880 align:start position:0%
something that would be an emergency
 
00:15:33.309 --> 00:15:33.319 align:start position:0%
there's a different process we can talk
 
00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:35.240 align:start position:0%
about if you're you'd like to but this
 
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
is a non-emergency
 
00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
process so a complaint is received um by
 
00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
the division of enforcement at
 
00:15:46.309 --> 00:15:46.319 align:start position:0%
oplc and it is reviewed for it's a legal
 
00:15:48.749 --> 00:15:48.759 align:start position:0%
review um to determine is it facially
 
00:15:51.069 --> 00:15:51.079 align:start position:0%
valid essentially assuming all
 
00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
allegations are true does it allege
 
00:15:57.629 --> 00:15:57.639 align:start position:0%
anything that would be misconduct um or
 
00:15:59.470 --> 00:15:59.480 align:start position:0%
unprofessional conduct
 
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
so we review that if the determination
 
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
is that it does not meet that standard
 
00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:09.240 align:start position:0%
then we draft a recom a recommendation
 
00:16:11.509 --> 00:16:11.519 align:start position:0%
for dismissal and that goes to the
 
00:16:14.949 --> 00:16:14.959 align:start position:0%
board so only the board can dismiss
 
00:16:17.389 --> 00:16:17.399 align:start position:0%
complaints we can only make a
 
00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
recommendation um we being enforcement
 
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
so right now all the attorneys and
 
00:16:25.069 --> 00:16:25.079 align:start position:0%
enforcement review complaints we take
 
00:16:28.069 --> 00:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
turns we are hiring an individual to
 
00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
specific do that attorneys of
 
00:16:35.069 --> 00:16:35.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:38.120 align:start position:0%
you um so again we can only make a
 
00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation we can't actually dismiss
 
00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:41.560 align:start position:0%
anything in enforcement it's up to the
 
00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
board so we send the recommend
 
00:16:45.269 --> 00:16:45.279 align:start position:0%
recommendations for dismissal to the
 
00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
board and they can
 
00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
dismiss or they can look at it and say
 
00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:51.800 align:start position:0%
no enforcement we don't agree with you
 
00:16:54.309 --> 00:16:54.319 align:start position:0%
and they can send it back to us if that
 
00:16:57.069 --> 00:16:57.079 align:start position:0%
happens we'll request a response if we
 
00:16:58.509 --> 00:16:58.519 align:start position:0%
look at a complaint and say yes this is
 
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
is facially valid then we would request
 
00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:02.720 align:start position:0%
a response so those are the two ways
 
00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
that we get to the response phase once a
 
00:17:08.949 --> 00:17:08.959 align:start position:0%
response from the lcy is received the
 
00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
complaint and response are R reviewed
 
00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
again sometimes the response provides
 
00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:16.360 align:start position:0%
enough information particularly in um
 
00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
like medicine cases where they might
 
00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
provide some documentation some records
 
00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
to help support their position that
 
00:17:23.789 --> 00:17:23.799 align:start position:0%
might be enough we may recommend
 
00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
dismissal again at that point we're able
 
00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:28.720 align:start position:0%
to do that so that is not depicted here
 
00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
just because there'd be too many arrows
 
00:17:32.789 --> 00:17:32.799 align:start position:0%
it would get really messy and confusing
 
00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
but we do another review at that stage
 
00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:37.400 align:start position:0%
to determine should it be dismissed or
 
00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:38.480 align:start position:0%
should it be
 
00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:40.600 align:start position:0%
investigated so again we would send the
 
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
right any recommendations for dismissal
 
00:17:43.909 --> 00:17:43.919 align:start position:0%
to the board that's purely their
 
00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
decision they can either agree and
 
00:17:47.669 --> 00:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
dismiss or send it back to us and say we
 
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
don't agree with you enforcement go
 
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
forth and
 
00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
investigate um so if the board sends it
 
00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:55.480 align:start position:0%
back or we review and say yes this needs
 
00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
to be investigated it is immediately
 
00:17:59.149 --> 00:17:59.159 align:start position:0%
assigned to an investig vator who begins
 
00:17:59.159 --> 00:18:00.470 align:start position:0%
assigned to an investig vator who begins
an

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
an
 
00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:02.360 align:start position:0%
investigation uh once they complete
 
00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
their investigation they draft an Roi or
 
00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:07.360 align:start position:0%
report of investigation and that is sent
 
00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
to the board with a recommendation the
 
00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:11.400 align:start position:0%
recommendation may be to dismiss at that
 
00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:14.480 align:start position:0%
point or it may be um for adjudication
 
00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:16.200 align:start position:0%
again that's a recommendation the board
 
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
gets the ROI and they make a decision
 
00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:20.360 align:start position:0%
they can accept whatever the
 
00:18:21.789 --> 00:18:21.799 align:start position:0%
recommendation is or they can make a
 
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
different determination um but the board
 
00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
at that point upon receiving the ROI
 
00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:28.760 align:start position:0%
would either dismiss the case or order
 
00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:37.640 align:start position:0%
scheduled any questions on the diagram
 
00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:39.549 align:start position:0%
scheduled any questions on the diagram
representative

00:18:39.549 --> 00:18:39.559 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:18:41.909 --> 00:18:41.919 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chair and thank
 
00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
you for taking the question on the
 
00:18:47.149 --> 00:18:47.159 align:start position:0%
process where you saw the complaint
 
00:18:49.789 --> 00:18:49.799 align:start position:0%
review what I think I heard was that's
 
00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:54.320 align:start position:0%
done by attorneys not done by peers so
 
00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:56.200 align:start position:0%
therefore I don't know whether the
 
00:18:59.270 --> 00:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
attorney has the clinical knowledge
 
00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
to make a determination from whether
 
00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
it's clinically relevant ver it just
 
00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:04.200 align:start position:0%
legally relevant so how does the
 
00:19:06.149 --> 00:19:06.159 align:start position:0%
clinical team get pulled into that
 
00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
review process yes thank you for the
 
00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:11.720 align:start position:0%
question um so it depends on what the
 
00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
complaint is right if it says my doctor
 
00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:15.480 align:start position:0%
sexually assaulted me you don't need a
 
00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
clinician to tell you that that's
 
00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:19.000 align:start position:0%
facially valid and needs to be
 
00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
investigated um if you get a complaint
 
00:19:22.549 --> 00:19:22.559 align:start position:0%
like this is a real complaint from Board
 
00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
of Nursing the nurse gave me the wrong
 
00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
color Jello you don't need to be a
 
00:19:28.029 --> 00:19:28.039 align:start position:0%
clinician to know that that's the uh
 
00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
that's not facially valid for the ones
 
00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
that you do need that expertise um we
 
00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
would Rely Upon Our contractor um who we
 
00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
work with who is a physician to help us
 
00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
make that determination because we're
 
00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
not doctors um so it depends on what the
 
00:19:44.909 --> 00:19:44.919 align:start position:0%
complaint alleges sometimes we can tell
 
00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:47.320 align:start position:0%
from what it says and if we can't if it
 
00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
has medical language and you know it
 
00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
talks about standard of care I'm not
 
00:19:53.549 --> 00:19:53.559 align:start position:0%
going to know that I'm not a doctor so
 
00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to rely upon someone who is
 
00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:57.080 align:start position:0%
to assist us in making that
 
00:19:58.789 --> 00:19:58.799 align:start position:0%
recommendation or deter mining that it
 
00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:04.029 --> 00:20:04.039 align:start position:0%
forward representative
 
00:20:07.029 --> 00:20:07.039 align:start position:0%
McDonald thank you Mr chairman I do how
 
00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:12.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
now that is a really great question for
 
00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:17.480 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine specifically or all
 
00:20:21.029 --> 00:20:21.039 align:start position:0%
boards well all boards affected by
 
00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
not it's a I don't have a specific
 
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
number um we have had a number of
 
00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:35.480 align:start position:0%
challenges regarding the electronic
 
00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
system that we keep track of cases in
 
00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:39.480 align:start position:0%
and a lot of improvements have been made
 
00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
recently that allows us to better track
 
00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:43.480 align:start position:0%
them and close out the ones that need to
 
00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:46.520 align:start position:0%
be um and we are working on getting a
 
00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:48.360 align:start position:0%
new system that will allow me to just
 
00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
provide that information but right now I
 
00:20:52.029 --> 00:20:52.039 align:start position:0%
don't have a lot of confidence in the
 
00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:54.200 align:start position:0%
data and so I'd be hesitant to give you
 
00:20:57.789 --> 00:20:57.799 align:start position:0%
a number um what I can tell you is that
 
00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:01.480 align:start position:0%
through this new process um recently
 
00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
there was a month where the Board of
 
00:21:05.149 --> 00:21:05.159 align:start position:0%
Medicine was able to dismiss over a 100
 
00:21:07.789 --> 00:21:07.799 align:start position:0%
cases because we've made a push um Board
 
00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
of Medicine does have a lot of pending
 
00:21:12.149 --> 00:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
cases so we've made a push to review as
 
00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
many as we can um and to be completely
 
00:21:16.549 --> 00:21:16.559 align:start position:0%
transparent a lot of those were sort of
 
00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
in grouped in the same bucket so it was
 
00:21:20.789 --> 00:21:20.799 align:start position:0%
easy to make a recommendation for a
 
00:21:23.789 --> 00:21:23.799 align:start position:0%
group of them but we were able to to do
 
00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:25.919 align:start position:0%
that for over a 100 complaints in one
 
00:21:27.789 --> 00:21:27.799 align:start position:0%
month which means that those are and
 
00:21:27.799 --> 00:21:28.549 align:start position:0%
month which means that those are and
they

00:21:28.549 --> 00:21:28.559 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
and they dismiss them um so that means
 
00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
that those are taken off the case list
 
00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
and we can focus on the ones that do
 
00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:35.240 align:start position:0%
need to be
 
00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:38.200 align:start position:0%
investigated follow up follow up um when
 
00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:39.640 align:start position:0%
you say dismissed does that mean
 
00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:42.390 align:start position:0%
you say dismissed does that mean
unfounded

00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
unfounded
 
00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
basically right it's of evidence
 
00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
whatever right it it doesn't rise to the
 
00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
level um it doesn't it doesn't right the
 
00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:53.320 align:start position:0%
board decided to dismiss it I think our
 
00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
recommendation would be it's facially
 
00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
invalid um it doesn't rise to the level
 
00:21:59.830 --> 00:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
of professional miscon conduct and I
 
00:22:01.029 --> 00:22:01.039 align:start position:0%
assume they agreed with that because
 
00:22:03.029 --> 00:22:03.039 align:start position:0%
they dismissed it but they did dismiss
 
00:22:05.269 --> 00:22:05.279 align:start position:0%
it I have one more one more thank you Mr
 
00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
chairman what's the and I know it would
 
00:22:10.269 --> 00:22:10.279 align:start position:0%
vary by department and severity and so
 
00:22:12.269 --> 00:22:12.279 align:start position:0%
forth but what's the average turnaround
 
00:22:14.029 --> 00:22:14.039 align:start position:0%
time on on a complaint in the
 
00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
investigation and so forth
 
00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:18.760 align:start position:0%
resolution so it does vary a lot
 
00:22:22.269 --> 00:22:22.279 align:start position:0%
depending on board um also complexity of
 
00:22:24.549 --> 00:22:24.559 align:start position:0%
complaint um some medicine cases
 
00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:26.120 align:start position:0%
especially if there's multiple doctors
 
00:22:28.549 --> 00:22:28.559 align:start position:0%
involved may take much longer
 
00:22:31.669 --> 00:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
um if it's something that maybe is not
 
00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
emergent but
 
00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
is urgent let's say you know it's going
 
00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
to be prioritized so that would be moved
 
00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:43.360 align:start position:0%
much more quickly um so it depends I can
 
00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
tell you what what our goal is moving
 
00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
forward as we're we're catching sort of
 
00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:49.720 align:start position:0%
cleaning this up and like I said trying
 
00:22:51.789 --> 00:22:51.799 align:start position:0%
to clean out the cases that should be
 
00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
dismissed in investigating the ones that
 
00:22:57.269 --> 00:22:57.279 align:start position:0%
weren't investigation um the goal is any
 
00:22:59.070 --> 00:22:59.080 align:start position:0%
complaint the maximum amount of time
 
00:23:02.269 --> 00:23:02.279 align:start position:0%
from time of complaint receipt to
 
00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:03.880 align:start position:0%
assuming it goes to adjudication because
 
00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
not all do but assuming it does to
 
00:23:09.269 --> 00:23:09.279 align:start position:0%
decision is a year or less most of them
 
00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
should probably be much less a lot of
 
00:23:13.269 --> 00:23:13.279 align:start position:0%
them will be dismissed at the complaint
 
00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:16.240 align:start position:0%
or um complaint response phase some of
 
00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:18.360 align:start position:0%
them um the investigation may take
 
00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
longer or shorter um if there's a
 
00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:22.400 align:start position:0%
hearing obviously that that time frame
 
00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
is a little bit longer than if the board
 
00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
dismisses after an Roi but the goal is
 
00:23:28.669 --> 00:23:28.679 align:start position:0%
every complaint that comes the maximum
 
00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
amount of time it would be around is one
 
00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
year and that's assuming that it does go
 
00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:35.720 align:start position:0%
to hearing okay um there would be a rare
 
00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:38.600 align:start position:0%
exception for certain cases either
 
00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
really really complex which we usually
 
00:23:42.269 --> 00:23:42.279 align:start position:0%
don't see in administrative law but we
 
00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:44.200 align:start position:0%
can um or if there's a criminal
 
00:23:46.149 --> 00:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
component sometimes just because the
 
00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
criminal portion of you know the the
 
00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
criminal courts might take longer um so
 
00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes depending on how we need to
 
00:23:57.390 --> 00:23:57.400 align:start position:0%
handle things it might take a little bit
 
00:23:59.029 --> 00:23:59.039 align:start position:0%
longer for our case depending on what's
 
00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:01.480 align:start position:0%
happening in the criminal court thank
 
00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
Murphy thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:08.360 align:start position:0%
you for this um flowchart is actually
 
00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
very helpful for me
 
00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
um so according to the flowchart unless
 
00:24:15.669 --> 00:24:15.679 align:start position:0%
you have a need to have a clinician
 
00:24:18.269 --> 00:24:18.279 align:start position:0%
present or to evaluate the Board of
 
00:24:20.789 --> 00:24:20.799 align:start position:0%
Medicine will not see this until an Roi
 
00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
is made is that
 
00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
correct uh right if we don't recommend
 
00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
dismiss so then yes first time they'll
 
00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
see it that is the first time they'll
 
00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:32.360 align:start position:0%
see it so at the very beginning the
 
00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:34.360 align:start position:0%
complaint is received I'm assuming that
 
00:24:38.269 --> 00:24:38.279 align:start position:0%
means also like a um um a malpractice
 
00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:41.960 align:start position:0%
lawsuit is that correct yes and how does
 
00:24:44.269 --> 00:24:44.279 align:start position:0%
that report come to you that complaint
 
00:24:46.269 --> 00:24:46.279 align:start position:0%
come to you does it come with five
 
00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
bounds of charts from hospital or does
 
00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:50.320 align:start position:0%
it come with an executive summary how do
 
00:24:52.389 --> 00:24:52.399 align:start position:0%
you get that report say specifically of
 
00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
a malpractice suit uh the malpractice
 
00:24:56.990 --> 00:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
suit typically comes from the court
 
00:24:58.110 --> 00:24:58.120 align:start position:0%
because they're supposed to know notify
 
00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:00.440 align:start position:0%
us anytime when is filed um there's a
 
00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
cover letter saying we're disclosing
 
00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:04.120 align:start position:0%
this to you and then it's a copy of the
 
00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:06.200 align:start position:0%
complaint filed in civil court and
 
00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:08.840 align:start position:0%
that's typically it just one more
 
00:25:10.909 --> 00:25:10.919 align:start position:0%
followup followup and you mentioned the
 
00:25:12.669 --> 00:25:12.679 align:start position:0%
complaint reviewed by a contractor is
 
00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
this some who is what is a contractor is
 
00:25:18.549 --> 00:25:18.559 align:start position:0%
it employed by oplc or is it do you pull
 
00:25:20.389 --> 00:25:20.399 align:start position:0%
people in regularly depending on the
 
00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
case or what is a contractor and where
 
00:25:24.149 --> 00:25:24.159 align:start position:0%
do they come from sure so we contract
 
00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
with a physician um who he's an investig
 
00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
Ator who works with our office um we
 
00:25:31.549 --> 00:25:31.559 align:start position:0%
have a number of contract investigators
 
00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
with different expertise so Board of
 
00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:35.080 align:start position:0%
Medicine currently has one and we're
 
00:25:36.789 --> 00:25:36.799 align:start position:0%
working on additional contracts for
 
00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:38.600 align:start position:0%
additional people with different
 
00:25:40.909 --> 00:25:40.919 align:start position:0%
different areas of expertise um the
 
00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:43.480 align:start position:0%
Board of Nursing Psychiatry the vet
 
00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
veterinarians a number of other boards
 
00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
utilize contract investigators um to
 
00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:50.600 align:start position:0%
help us where we need that expertise
 
00:25:52.269 --> 00:25:52.279 align:start position:0%
because our investigators are experts in
 
00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
investigating but not necessarily in
 
00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
matter right subject matter um in
 
00:25:59.470 --> 00:25:59.480 align:start position:0%
medicine or nursing or those types of
 
00:26:01.789 --> 00:26:01.799 align:start position:0%
things so um so we work in conjunction
 
00:26:03.789 --> 00:26:03.799 align:start position:0%
with them so when I referred to the
 
00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:05.640 align:start position:0%
contractor it's the physician that we
 
00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:07.880 align:start position:0%
currently contract with um like I said
 
00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:09.640 align:start position:0%
we're working on getting other contracts
 
00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
into place um we used to have the
 
00:26:13.909 --> 00:26:13.919 align:start position:0%
medical revieww subcommittee and there
 
00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
were some challenges with that but when
 
00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
we lost that um group we did recognize
 
00:26:22.669 --> 00:26:22.679 align:start position:0%
that we needed additional contracts in
 
00:26:24.789 --> 00:26:24.799 align:start position:0%
order to con continue this work I'm
 
00:26:27.669 --> 00:26:27.679 align:start position:0%
sorry just one more f one more um when
 
00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:29.320 align:start position:0%
we were looking earlier in the year at
 
00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:31.360 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine in the in the
 
00:26:33.789 --> 00:26:33.799 align:start position:0%
committee or commission or committee to
 
00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
uh evaluate the Board of Medicine one of
 
00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
the big issues that came up was Staffing
 
00:26:40.909 --> 00:26:40.919 align:start position:0%
or the lack of it do you feel like oplc
 
00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
has staffed adequately enough to handle
 
00:26:45.789 --> 00:26:45.799 align:start position:0%
the number of cases that come before you
 
00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:49.320 align:start position:0%
currently I do we did just add I think
 
00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
it's one and one and a half
 
00:26:53.149 --> 00:26:53.159 align:start position:0%
investigators we had one part-time
 
00:26:55.789 --> 00:26:55.799 align:start position:0%
investigator who left and we replaced
 
00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
that person's position with a full-time
 
00:26:59.590 --> 00:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
and then we hired an additional
 
00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:02.840 align:start position:0%
investigator um so right now I feel we
 
00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
are fully staffed um to handle what what
 
00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:08.120 align:start position:0%
matters we have and like I said that
 
00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:09.720 align:start position:0%
goal is to have that one year or less
 
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
time frame and as we move along and get
 
00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:13.880 align:start position:0%
better data we'll be able to identify
 
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
whether we truly are fully staffed
 
00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:17.720 align:start position:0%
rather than feeling like we're fully
 
00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
y representative Merchant thank you Mr
 
00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:25.720 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for thinking the
 
00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:29.240 align:start position:0%
question I I Al like C of Murphy said I
 
00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:30.760 align:start position:0%
found this to be very interesting I
 
00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
think one of the comments I heard about
 
00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:35.320 align:start position:0%
this it does not only apply to the Board
 
00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:39.240 align:start position:0%
of Medicine but to other entities within
 
00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
oplc so in saying that is the process
 
00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:45.640 align:start position:0%
going to be the same for other health
 
00:27:47.269 --> 00:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
care providers whether it be a
 
00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:51.320 align:start position:0%
podiatrist chiropractor a dentist and so
 
00:27:55.870 --> 00:27:55.880 align:start position:0%
forth yes um HB 655 and HB
 
00:27:59.029 --> 00:27:59.039 align:start position:0%
409 essentially Consolidated the process
 
00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:01.320 align:start position:0%
into one process whereas before we had
 
00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
50 some OD processes because every board
 
00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
wanted things slightly different um so
 
00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:07.480 align:start position:0%
now we have one
 
00:28:11.389 --> 00:28:11.399 align:start position:0%
process follow up thank you can you
 
00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
speak to the communication process
 
00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:16.600 align:start position:0%
between the time a complaint is
 
00:28:20.789 --> 00:28:20.799 align:start position:0%
filed to the time there's resolution to
 
00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
it how is the person who's been the
 
00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
individual who filed the complaint how
 
00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:26.480 align:start position:0%
are they kept in the loop that
 
00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:28.120 align:start position:0%
something's actually happening
 
00:28:29.789 --> 00:28:29.799 align:start position:0%
if it goes out for a year and there's no
 
00:28:31.149 --> 00:28:31.159 align:start position:0%
communication with the person who's
 
00:28:33.789 --> 00:28:33.799 align:start position:0%
filed the complaint it's going to sound
 
00:28:36.269 --> 00:28:36.279 align:start position:0%
like it may be fallowing unde years
 
00:28:37.509 --> 00:28:37.519 align:start position:0%
that's one of the questions the other
 
00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
question is going to be is how do the
 
00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
person who wants to file a complaint
 
00:28:42.549 --> 00:28:42.559 align:start position:0%
where do they go and how do they know
 
00:28:44.149 --> 00:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
where to go to file the complaint
 
00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
because if the system is problematic so
 
00:28:48.909 --> 00:28:48.919 align:start position:0%
it's two questions I guess one is what's
 
00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
the communication process with the
 
00:28:51.509 --> 00:28:51.519 align:start position:0%
person making the complaint what's
 
00:28:52.909 --> 00:28:52.919 align:start position:0%
communication to the people out in the
 
00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:55.000 align:start position:0%
public that they where to go to file a
 
00:28:57.789 --> 00:28:57.799 align:start position:0%
complaint sure um I'll answer the second
 
00:28:59.230 --> 00:28:59.240 align:start position:0%
one first if that's okay cuz I think
 
00:29:03.549 --> 00:29:03.559 align:start position:0%
it's a easier shorter answer um so uh we
 
00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:05.360 align:start position:0%
have a complaint I mean people can file
 
00:29:06.909 --> 00:29:06.919 align:start position:0%
complaints however they're comfortable
 
00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
so if some we get some by snail mail
 
00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:11.080 align:start position:0%
with hard copy sometimes they just email
 
00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:12.760 align:start position:0%
us we do have the information on our
 
00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
website how to file a complaint we have
 
00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
an online form that they can complete
 
00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:18.200 align:start position:0%
and send to us not everyone's
 
00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:19.880 align:start position:0%
comfortable doing that so like I said if
 
00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:21.720 align:start position:0%
they want to email us or if they some
 
00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
people write out or handw write us
 
00:29:25.509 --> 00:29:25.519 align:start position:0%
something and drop it in the mail we'll
 
00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
take it through all those means um when
 
00:29:30.669 --> 00:29:30.679 align:start position:0%
we get a complaint they get a receipt of
 
00:29:33.509 --> 00:29:33.519 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement so we have received your
 
00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
complaint um if it does go to I mean if
 
00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
it's recommended for dismissal and it's
 
00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:40.200 align:start position:0%
dismissed early on they're going to get
 
00:29:42.389 --> 00:29:42.399 align:start position:0%
a letter um from the board indicating
 
00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
your complaint was dismissed um if it
 
00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
goes into investigation then an
 
00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
investigator would reach out because
 
00:29:49.149 --> 00:29:49.159 align:start position:0%
that's part of the investigation you
 
00:29:50.789 --> 00:29:50.799 align:start position:0%
don't just take obviously what's in the
 
00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
complaint you want to talk to the
 
00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:53.080 align:start position:0%
complaintant and get some additional
 
00:29:54.269 --> 00:29:54.279 align:start position:0%
information they may have to be a
 
00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
witness in the hearing so we want to
 
00:29:58.310 --> 00:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
talk to them um so they would know the
 
00:29:59.669 --> 00:29:59.679 align:start position:0%
investigator who's working on their
 
00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:01.480 align:start position:0%
complaint and they would know it is in
 
00:30:05.269 --> 00:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
process um so they'd have a
 
00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
a Avenue to communicate with our office
 
00:30:10.269 --> 00:30:10.279 align:start position:0%
regarding the the status if it's an
 
00:30:12.269 --> 00:30:12.279 align:start position:0%
investigation um now what we can tell
 
00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:14.200 align:start position:0%
them is very limited because even though
 
00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:16.120 align:start position:0%
they are the complainant um
 
00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
investigations are confidential so they
 
00:30:20.269 --> 00:30:20.279 align:start position:0%
know it's been filed they know it's
 
00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
being investigated because they're part
 
00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
of the process but we're very limited in
 
00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
outcome representative
 
00:30:35.549 --> 00:30:35.559 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you for taking my question
 
00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here today and thank
 
00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:41.000 align:start position:0%
you for the updates um I notice that if
 
00:30:43.509 --> 00:30:43.519 align:start position:0%
I go to the Board of Medicine page I
 
00:30:45.389 --> 00:30:45.399 align:start position:0%
can't find the complaint procedure
 
00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:47.720 align:start position:0%
unless I happen to click on frequently
 
00:30:50.509 --> 00:30:50.519 align:start position:0%
asked questions and I wonder if it might
 
00:30:53.789 --> 00:30:53.799 align:start position:0%
be helpful for the public to have a link
 
00:30:57.269 --> 00:30:57.279 align:start position:0%
on that front page if I go for example
 
00:30:59.230 --> 00:30:59.240 align:start position:0%
to the Attorney General's office and I
 
00:31:00.669 --> 00:31:00.679 align:start position:0%
have a complaint about something there's
 
00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:02.440 align:start position:0%
something right on their front page that
 
00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:04.720 align:start position:0%
tells me how to get there so I wonder if
 
00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
that might be helpful going forward okay
 
00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:09.720 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that feedback um it should
 
00:31:11.909 --> 00:31:11.919 align:start position:0%
say report or file a complaint at the
 
00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:13.480 align:start position:0%
top of the page and I thought that there
 
00:31:15.549 --> 00:31:15.559 align:start position:0%
was a link further down the page but I
 
00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate that feedback and I'll
 
00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:18.440 align:start position:0%
certainly look into it and I'll I'll
 
00:31:20.549 --> 00:31:20.559 align:start position:0%
bring that back no I'm I'm wrong there
 
00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:22.840 align:start position:0%
is a there is
 
00:31:25.629 --> 00:31:25.639 align:start position:0%
a I am mistaken there is a file and
 
00:31:27.909 --> 00:31:27.919 align:start position:0%
complaint thing it's in the line with
 
00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
the other stuff so I was reading down
 
00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:32.840 align:start position:0%
okay still valuable feedback though
 
00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:34.120 align:start position:0%
because if you weren't able to find it
 
00:31:35.629 --> 00:31:35.639 align:start position:0%
when you went there looking for it
 
00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:38.440 align:start position:0%
others may not as well so thank
 
00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:44.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
helpful representative McDonald uh thank
 
00:31:50.509 --> 00:31:50.519 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman I used to be an
 
00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
investigator with um the department and
 
00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
the Fraud Unit the welfare fraud unit
 
00:31:56.269 --> 00:31:56.279 align:start position:0%
that's why I I find this very
 
00:31:56.279 --> 00:31:57.750 align:start position:0%
that's why I I find this very
interesting

00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
00:31:59.110 --> 00:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
uh and I know on an ongoing
 
00:32:00.629 --> 00:32:00.639 align:start position:0%
investigation you're very limited in
 
00:32:02.269 --> 00:32:02.279 align:start position:0%
terms of what you can share in fact we
 
00:32:04.269 --> 00:32:04.279 align:start position:0%
couldn't share anything we take the
 
00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
complaint and then would proceed and
 
00:32:07.909 --> 00:32:07.919 align:start position:0%
unless it went to court we couldn't
 
00:32:09.269 --> 00:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
share anything if it was an
 
00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:10.720 align:start position:0%
administrative hearing we couldn't share
 
00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
anything how much are you able to share
 
00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:14.840 align:start position:0%
when you said you can share the outcome
 
00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
are you able to share the outcome um um
 
00:32:20.149 --> 00:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
enforcement is not the board is because
 
00:32:21.789 --> 00:32:21.799 align:start position:0%
that's a board decision so that's
 
00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
communicated through the board
 
00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
administrator um so that is communicated
 
00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
to both the complainant and if it um you
 
00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
know if there's if it goes to
 
00:32:33.389 --> 00:32:33.399 align:start position:0%
investigation then obviously the leny
 
00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
needs to be notified as well if the
 
00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
outcome um but it doesn't have to go to
 
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
court for the outcome to be known it
 
00:32:41.149 --> 00:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
does not have to go to court right the
 
00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:44.360 align:start position:0%
hearing is before the board um and then
 
00:32:47.509 --> 00:32:47.519 align:start position:0%
the public or yes the the hearings are
 
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
public um there I think we've had very
 
00:32:52.629 --> 00:32:52.639 align:start position:0%
rare occasion where maybe the subject
 
00:32:54.629 --> 00:32:54.639 align:start position:0%
matter being covered was very sensitive
 
00:32:57.549 --> 00:32:57.559 align:start position:0%
so it's been sealed or
 
00:32:59.830 --> 00:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
um portions of it have been sealed but
 
00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:08.629 --> 00:33:08.639 align:start position:0%
you you will recall a while ago the
 
00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
Boston Globe
 
00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:14.600 align:start position:0%
investigated the matters of a surgeon at
 
00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
CMC and that the Massachusetts Board of
 
00:33:19.269 --> 00:33:19.279 align:start position:0%
Medicine reported
 
00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:23.080 align:start position:0%
20 um settlements and the New Hampshire
 
00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:25.720 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine reported none and that
 
00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
led to borrow multiple pages of uh
 
00:33:34.269 --> 00:33:34.279 align:start position:0%
report in the Boston Globe I was ex uh
 
00:33:37.149 --> 00:33:37.159 align:start position:0%
interviewed extensively by the globe I
 
00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:41.000 align:start position:0%
was in media so you know um and then by
 
00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
other media outlets and lately they've
 
00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:47.080 align:start position:0%
been giving me a call and saying how's
 
00:33:50.029 --> 00:33:50.039 align:start position:0%
it going now compared and I wanted to
 
00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:52.120 align:start position:0%
wait until I heard from you folks before
 
00:33:59.070 --> 00:33:59.080 align:start position:0%
I get back to them um and would now the
 
00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:02.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Board of Medicine have
 
00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:03.350 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Board of Medicine have
this

00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:06.720 align:start position:0%
information on report this information
 
00:34:08.990 --> 00:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
whereas before they
 
00:34:11.470 --> 00:34:11.480 align:start position:0%
didn't I'm sorry I'm not certain I
 
00:34:13.869 --> 00:34:13.879 align:start position:0%
understand your question the public did
 
00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
not know yeah by the New Hampshire
 
00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
board's Revelations about the uh 20
 
00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
malpractice settlements of the
 
00:34:25.629 --> 00:34:25.639 align:start position:0%
surgeon unless they read the
 
00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:27.800 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts board of medicine's
 
00:34:30.430 --> 00:34:30.440 align:start position:0%
website and we were told at the time
 
00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
well the procedures the Staffing the
 
00:34:34.669 --> 00:34:34.679 align:start position:0%
this it sounded plausible I didn't think
 
00:34:37.990 --> 00:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
anyone was being bad I just thought we
 
00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:40.200 align:start position:0%
need to be updated we need to change
 
00:34:42.990 --> 00:34:43.000 align:start position:0%
procedures we need to hire a few folks
 
00:34:46.629 --> 00:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
would you say that the legislation now
 
00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:49.919 align:start position:0%
law and the efforts at
 
00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
oplc have improved to the point where
 
00:34:57.950 --> 00:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
that problem will no longer happen
 
00:34:59.910 --> 00:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
so I think with the improvements that
 
00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
we've had I mean so if a case like I
 
00:35:06.069 --> 00:35:06.079 align:start position:0%
said cases are confidential basically
 
00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
until there there's a hearing right so
 
00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
the hearings are public so that would be
 
00:35:12.589 --> 00:35:12.599 align:start position:0%
available that would be noticed that
 
00:35:15.310 --> 00:35:15.320 align:start position:0%
would that would be public um any
 
00:35:17.349 --> 00:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
outcome um you know if there's a
 
00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:19.160 align:start position:0%
settlement agreement if they settle
 
00:35:21.349 --> 00:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
prior to a hearing but you know
 
00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:22.720 align:start position:0%
adjudication has been ordered and they
 
00:35:24.829 --> 00:35:24.839 align:start position:0%
settle or even if it's before then if
 
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
there's a settlement agreement um if
 
00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:28.760 align:start position:0%
there's a finding of misconduct whatever
 
00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:30.280 align:start position:0%
the board orders are those are all on
 
00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:32.280 align:start position:0%
our website and those are also if you
 
00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:34.640 align:start position:0%
look up a lensey they are also posted
 
00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
there so if you have a new doctor and
 
00:35:38.069 --> 00:35:38.079 align:start position:0%
you want to look them up you can look up
 
00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:39.880 align:start position:0%
their license make sure they're actively
 
00:35:41.589 --> 00:35:41.599 align:start position:0%
licensed and see if there's any
 
00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
discipline attached to their record um
 
00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
I'm not certain if that's answering your
 
00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
question I'm not sure I'm asking it
 
00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:52.040 align:start position:0%
exactly to get the information I wanted
 
00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:55.240 align:start position:0%
because maybe the 20 things that were
 
00:35:57.710 --> 00:35:57.720 align:start position:0%
reported in Mass assachusetts
 
00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:00.200 align:start position:0%
hadn't been settled or were settled out
 
00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
of court or whatever they were it wasn't
 
00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:05.400 align:start position:0%
up to the standard of what the Board of
 
00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:07.480 align:start position:0%
Medicine was allowed to do could do or
 
00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:09.710 align:start position:0%
Medicine was allowed to do could do or
whatever

00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:09.720 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:12.520 align:start position:0%
counselor good afternoon Douglas
 
00:36:15.109 --> 00:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
HC um I would say that a majority of the
 
00:36:17.950 --> 00:36:17.960 align:start position:0%
changes that we saw in 655 and 409
 
00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:20.200 align:start position:0%
updated the process not so much the
 
00:36:24.069 --> 00:36:24.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:29.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:33.280 align:start position:0%
I I think I can maybe help out um is is
 
00:36:35.470 --> 00:36:35.480 align:start position:0%
it not true that we had a number of
 
00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
meetings where we tried in various fora
 
00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:39.630 align:start position:0%
meetings where we tried in various fora
to

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:39.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
describe what things must be posted and
 
00:36:47.230 --> 00:36:47.240 align:start position:0%
to date we haven't actually reached a
 
00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
consensus about what things must be
 
00:36:52.990 --> 00:36:53.000 align:start position:0%
posted so that the the actual postings
 
00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.230 align:start position:0%
posted so that the the actual postings
are

00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
not that different from what they were
 
00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
before what is different from what there
 
00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
were before is a more robust
 
00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:03.240 align:start position:0%
investigative process I would say that's
 
00:37:07.349 --> 00:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
accurate thank you is this is for
 
00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:12.680 align:start position:0%
anybody is is the process of coming to
 
00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
arguably better postings are still a
 
00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:16.520 align:start position:0%
work in
 
00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:18.680 align:start position:0%
progress well can I ask a question when
 
00:37:20.069 --> 00:37:20.079 align:start position:0%
you say that there were settlements and
 
00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:22.720 align:start position:0%
you you kind of referred to court
 
00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
settlements I mean those will never be
 
00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
posted on our website if it's a court
 
00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:30.520 align:start position:0%
settlement um if we receive such a
 
00:37:32.109 --> 00:37:32.119 align:start position:0%
document and it's considered a complaint
 
00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:33.480 align:start position:0%
we're not going to post that because
 
00:37:37.309 --> 00:37:37.319 align:start position:0%
it's confidential um the courts you know
 
00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:40.480 align:start position:0%
I it's difficult to find out you know I
 
00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:41.880 align:start position:0%
mean I moved here from another state I
 
00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:43.640 align:start position:0%
used to look up and do a civil case
 
00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
search to see any of my new doctors you
 
00:37:47.309 --> 00:37:47.319 align:start position:0%
know do they have any medical
 
00:37:48.910 --> 00:37:48.920 align:start position:0%
malpractice cases that were filed
 
00:37:49.870 --> 00:37:49.880 align:start position:0%
against them and I could see all the
 
00:37:51.829 --> 00:37:51.839 align:start position:0%
pleadings online and I found that New
 
00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has chosen not to do that
 
00:37:55.950 --> 00:37:55.960 align:start position:0%
which I'm not making a judgment call but
 
00:37:58.030 --> 00:37:58.040 align:start position:0%
that's that's not something you can just
 
00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
do um but CA case filings would be
 
00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:03.720 align:start position:0%
something the court would have to post
 
00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:06.760 align:start position:0%
we would not post those followup
 
00:38:09.589 --> 00:38:09.599 align:start position:0%
representative Weber and this is just a
 
00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:13.560 align:start position:0%
statement um my my recollection is that
 
00:38:15.790 --> 00:38:15.800 align:start position:0%
we had a number of discussions I think
 
00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:19.960 align:start position:0%
in the context of a bill and uh the
 
00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
issue that we wrestled with that I think
 
00:38:25.630 --> 00:38:25.640 align:start position:0%
everybody wrestles with is where is the
 
00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:27.270 align:start position:0%
everybody wrestles with is where is the
line

00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
between uh information that is
 
00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
clear that needs to be shared with the
 
00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
public and how early in the process do
 
00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:41.880 align:start position:0%
we make things public in order to be
 
00:38:44.109 --> 00:38:44.119 align:start position:0%
fair not only to the Public's right to
 
00:38:46.910 --> 00:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
know about their providers but also
 
00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:49.160 align:start position:0%
whether the complaint is about the color
 
00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
of the jello rather than which may be a
 
00:38:55.870 --> 00:38:55.880 align:start position:0%
valid complaint but it's not um
 
00:38:59.230 --> 00:38:59.240 align:start position:0%
actionable in terms of somebody's
 
00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
practice um and my recollection was that
 
00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:06.160 align:start position:0%
we wrestled Mally and
 
00:39:09.790 --> 00:39:09.800 align:start position:0%
didn't have a lot of success in deciding
 
00:39:13.790 --> 00:39:13.800 align:start position:0%
where that dividing line ought to be so
 
00:39:16.309 --> 00:39:16.319 align:start position:0%
I think probably the legislature needs
 
00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
to take some uh ownership for the fact
 
00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
that until they do successfully grapple
 
00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:25.880 align:start position:0%
with that issue and set a very clear
 
00:39:28.109 --> 00:39:28.119 align:start position:0%
standard for what's going to get posted
 
00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:29.680 align:start position:0%
what's going to get posted isn't going
 
00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:31.880 align:start position:0%
to change unless it somehow gets changed
 
00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
by rule but I don't think we've
 
00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
delegated that Authority so it can't be
 
00:39:39.150 --> 00:39:39.160 align:start position:0%
changed by rule so until we do something
 
00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
I don't think anything's going to happen
 
00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:43.880 align:start position:0%
if that's a help with the process if not
 
00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
the answer well I think it is because
 
00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
the answer seems to me that the
 
00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
difference between what the
 
00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Board of Medicine felt
 
00:39:57.309 --> 00:39:57.319 align:start position:0%
comfortable in posting versus the New
 
00:39:59.910 --> 00:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire leaving any legal terms out of
 
00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
it whatever they did we didn't and that
 
00:40:04.750 --> 00:40:04.760 align:start position:0%
isn't changing
 
00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:06.670 align:start position:0%
isn't changing
yet

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:06.680 align:start position:0%
yet
 
00:40:09.109 --> 00:40:09.119 align:start position:0%
okay that's very helpful and and thank
 
00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
you representative representative Murphy
 
00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
thank you uh just a follow up to that
 
00:40:15.390 --> 00:40:15.400 align:start position:0%
conversation so is it fair to say on
 
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
your flow diagram here
 
00:40:21.309 --> 00:40:21.319 align:start position:0%
that uh if a complaint were to result in
 
00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
any sort of um reprimand that would not
 
00:40:27.589 --> 00:40:27.599 align:start position:0%
be released to the public until it got
 
00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:30.920 align:start position:0%
to an Roi into the Board of Medicine it
 
00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
would not come out publicly before that
 
00:40:34.349 --> 00:40:34.359 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:40:37.150 --> 00:40:37.160 align:start position:0%
correct so if a complaint comes in to
 
00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:39.880 align:start position:0%
the board of to the oplc and you've gone
 
00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
through your entire process of
 
00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
reviewing um an investigator is assigned
 
00:40:48.309 --> 00:40:48.319 align:start position:0%
to it etc etc and judge or Roi is
 
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
determined or is given it would seem to
 
00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
me then that part would not be public is
 
00:40:55.109 --> 00:40:55.119 align:start position:0%
that correct that would not be publicly
 
00:40:57.710 --> 00:40:57.720 align:start position:0%
available in in most other states as
 
00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
well as ours but it could be at the
 
00:41:02.910 --> 00:41:02.920 align:start position:0%
point when it gets to the Board of
 
00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
Medicine it's accurate that the ROI it's
 
00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:08.200 align:start position:0%
not public at that point because the
 
00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
board hasn't made a decision so yeah but
 
00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
it's when the Board of Medicine gets it
 
00:41:15.150 --> 00:41:15.160 align:start position:0%
and they make a decision to dismiss or
 
00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
ad adjudicate that's when it would be
 
00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
potentially out on the public domain is
 
00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
that correct right if they order
 
00:41:24.109 --> 00:41:24.119 align:start position:0%
adjudication the notice of the hearing
 
00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:25.880 align:start position:0%
and the hearing would be public if it's
 
00:41:28.349 --> 00:41:28.359 align:start position:0%
dismiss missed then there's no notice to
 
00:41:29.790 --> 00:41:29.800 align:start position:0%
the public that a complaint had been
 
00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:31.640 align:start position:0%
ping so nothing up to that point in time
 
00:41:33.829 --> 00:41:33.839 align:start position:0%
of the RO I guess I'm asking is nothing
 
00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
up to the point of the ROI is really
 
00:41:39.349 --> 00:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
available to the public correct okay
 
00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:43.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:47.790 --> 00:41:47.800 align:start position:0%
you it would be just to beat it to death
 
00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
it would be the
 
00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:52.440 align:start position:0%
legislature that will
 
00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:54.510 align:start position:0%
legislature that will
inform

00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:54.520 align:start position:0%
inform
 
00:41:58.109 --> 00:41:58.119 align:start position:0%
oplc or the the boards that's one
 
00:42:00.670 --> 00:42:00.680 align:start position:0%
question where the line should
 
00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:04.200 align:start position:0%
be you aren't going to do
 
00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
that they can't change
 
00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:09.400 align:start position:0%
it that's what I'm trying to pound
 
00:42:12.069 --> 00:42:12.079 align:start position:0%
several Nails into correct right now we
 
00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
are unable to disclose that information
 
00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
okay right it would have to I believe
 
00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:19.480 align:start position:0%
have to be a statutory change to allow
 
00:42:23.349 --> 00:42:23.359 align:start position:0%
that Mr chair yes if I could I I think
 
00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:25.720 align:start position:0%
this transcends the Board of Medicine I
 
00:42:27.630 --> 00:42:27.640 align:start position:0%
think going to do it for one Healthcare
 
00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
discipline we have to be doing it for
 
00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
all not just for one and single someone
 
00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:33.549 align:start position:0%
all not just for one and single someone
else

00:42:33.549 --> 00:42:33.559 align:start position:0%
else
 
00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:42.400 align:start position:0%
else thank you attorney Ood and Miz or
 
00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:45.640 align:start position:0%
Council or what dror
 
00:42:48.549 --> 00:42:48.559 align:start position:0%
um um I'm buying time until I keep
 
00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
rehearsing it's a don't worry about it
 
00:42:54.109 --> 00:42:54.119 align:start position:0%
an I mean I am an attorney but Miz is
 
00:42:57.430 --> 00:42:57.440 align:start position:0%

polius perfect got it thank you for
 
00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
coming one more update last legislative
 
00:43:06.510 --> 00:43:06.520 align:start position:0%
season the Board of Medicine uh with the
 
00:43:09.109 --> 00:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
mrsc going away was given statutory
 
00:43:11.710 --> 00:43:11.720 align:start position:0%
authority to create a subcommittee and
 
00:43:14.670 --> 00:43:14.680 align:start position:0%
they can create um essentially a panel
 
00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
of experts to Aid our investigators
 
00:43:19.349 --> 00:43:19.359 align:start position:0%
during investigations uh that's
 
00:43:21.069 --> 00:43:21.079 align:start position:0%
currently in the rulemaking process
 
00:43:22.589 --> 00:43:22.599 align:start position:0%
there's drafts I don't have anything yet
 
00:43:24.109 --> 00:43:24.119 align:start position:0%
to share but the Board of Medicine is
 
00:43:26.589 --> 00:43:26.599 align:start position:0%
working on those uh so in the future
 
00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:28.640 align:start position:0%
this extra panel to insist our
 
00:43:30.910 --> 00:43:30.920 align:start position:0%
investigators will
 
00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:42.109 --> 00:43:42.119 align:start position:0%
you next item the developmental Services
 
00:43:44.910 --> 00:43:44.920 align:start position:0%
redesign implementation status update
 
00:43:51.710 --> 00:43:51.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:54.549 align:start position:0%
 
is

00:43:54.549 --> 00:43:54.559 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:43:56.750 --> 00:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
Mr I understand
 
00:44:01.349 --> 00:44:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:04.480 align:start position:0%
that good good afternoon Chris Antonello
 
00:44:08.270 --> 00:44:08.280 align:start position:0%
I'm here for Melissa Hardy today um
 
00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
so I actually probably have a relatively
 
00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
um brief update um I know that Melissa
 
00:44:21.230 --> 00:44:21.240 align:start position:0%
typically this was regarding retain
 
00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
608 which is now interim study um 608
 
00:44:30.790 --> 00:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
correct recomend recommended thank you
 
00:44:34.109 --> 00:44:34.119 align:start position:0%
the house has to vote okay so that's
 
00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
kind of um where we are um we
 
00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:43.720 align:start position:0%
um uh November 3rd we presented to the
 
00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on HB um 608 so some of
 
00:44:50.270 --> 00:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
this information may be repetitive I
 
00:44:53.069 --> 00:44:53.079 align:start position:0%
know Melissa spends a lot of time here
 
00:44:55.109 --> 00:44:55.119 align:start position:0%
talking about stakeholder engagement and
 
00:44:57.109 --> 00:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
I think that's where I'd like to spend
 
00:45:01.349 --> 00:45:01.359 align:start position:0%
our time today if that's okay um when we
 
00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
met in front of the subcommittee to hear
 
00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
um retain 608 um I shared and I
 
00:45:12.270 --> 00:45:12.280 align:start position:0%
reiterate today um that the department
 
00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
is committed to collaborating with all
 
00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
stakeholders um to improve our
 
00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:21.240 align:start position:0%
developmental Services System I think
 
00:45:26.270 --> 00:45:26.280 align:start position:0%
there um has been a lot of anxiety um in
 
00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
the system because we had a number of
 
00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:31.000 align:start position:0%
items that we had to move forward for
 
00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
compliance and now we're past that pit
 
00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
phase and so we really have the ability
 
00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
um to stop pause and get meaningful
 
00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
engagement from all stakeholders whether
 
00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:46.960 align:start position:0%
that's an individual a family provider
 
00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:50.200 align:start position:0%
agencies area agencies whomever and so
 
00:45:53.390 --> 00:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
we've actually started to um map out
 
00:45:55.309 --> 00:45:55.319 align:start position:0%
some of those stakeholder engagement
 
00:45:55.319 --> 00:45:56.390 align:start position:0%
some of those stakeholder engagement
sessions

00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
sessions
 
00:45:59.390 --> 00:45:59.400 align:start position:0%
and starting in I think it's after
 
00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
Thanksgiving we're going to kick off a
 
00:46:05.790 --> 00:46:05.800 align:start position:0%
number of four um family and information
 
00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:06.710 align:start position:0%
number of four um family and information
um

00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
settings um just to really talk and
 
00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:11.400 align:start position:0%
understand what's working well what's
 
00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
not working what do you want to see
 
00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:15.240 align:start position:0%
changed and begin to go down that
 
00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:18.640 align:start position:0%
process so that's really kind of um
 
00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
where we are right now and then we will
 
00:46:23.829 --> 00:46:23.839 align:start position:0%
also be meeting with the area agencies
 
00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:26.240 align:start position:0%
through CSN I asked some of the same um
 
00:46:28.990 --> 00:46:29.000 align:start position:0%
issues and then also with our private
 
00:46:31.349 --> 00:46:31.359 align:start position:0%
provider networks and we're spending the
 
00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
time really um we don't have any firm
 
00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
start dates for any new um changes to
 
00:46:43.710 --> 00:46:43.720 align:start position:0%
the service delivery system we've put
 
00:46:47.030 --> 00:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
some of the um rate work on hold not the
 
00:46:50.109 --> 00:46:50.119 align:start position:0%
hb2 rate work that's still happening
 
00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
January 1st but some of the other rate
 
00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
work we're putting that on pause a
 
00:46:58.589 --> 00:46:58.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:58.599 --> 00:46:59.790 align:start position:0%
 
any

00:46:59.790 --> 00:46:59.800 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:47:01.870 --> 00:47:01.880 align:start position:0%
questions from
 
00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:03.710 align:start position:0%
questions from
the

00:47:03.710 --> 00:47:03.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
committee Mr chair
 
00:47:09.150 --> 00:47:09.160 align:start position:0%
yes thank thank you Mr chair also thank
 
00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
you for the update one of the things I
 
00:47:13.549 --> 00:47:13.559 align:start position:0%
also they talked about was the process
 
00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
which I'm glad to hear that we're
 
00:47:16.349 --> 00:47:16.359 align:start position:0%
bringing back the stakeholder
 
00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:18.640 align:start position:0%
involvement yeah to this degree I think
 
00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
it's helpful for both both sides of the
 
00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:24.160 align:start position:0%
fence was the cash flow issue was trying
 
00:47:25.829 --> 00:47:25.839 align:start position:0%
to find a way to be sure that there's
 
00:47:29.069 --> 00:47:29.079 align:start position:0%
staying financially viable and a lot of
 
00:47:30.549 --> 00:47:30.559 align:start position:0%
that comes down to is trying to be sure
 
00:47:32.109 --> 00:47:32.119 align:start position:0%
that they're getting sufficient cash
 
00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:34.040 align:start position:0%
because of the the issues around the
 
00:47:35.589 --> 00:47:35.599 align:start position:0%
billing issue and so forth can you speak
 
00:47:37.990 --> 00:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
to where we are with that part of it
 
00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:40.160 align:start position:0%
because sure it's nice to have a process
 
00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
but you don't have agencies to do the
 
00:47:43.470 --> 00:47:43.480 align:start position:0%
process we don't have to worry about to
 
00:47:47.230 --> 00:47:47.240 align:start position:0%
yep totally agree so we actually um have
 
00:47:49.069 --> 00:47:49.079 align:start position:0%
been meeting with area agencies
 
00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
oneon-one um because I really think that
 
00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:53.680 align:start position:0%
you know yes we do a lots of training
 
00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
and information and meet with a group
 
00:47:57.349 --> 00:47:57.359 align:start position:0%
but meeting with a agencies oneon-one to
 
00:47:59.630 --> 00:47:59.640 align:start position:0%
really understand what's your pain Point
 
00:48:01.829 --> 00:48:01.839 align:start position:0%
what do you need help with and so we've
 
00:48:04.470 --> 00:48:04.480 align:start position:0%
had um at
 
00:48:07.950 --> 00:48:07.960 align:start position:0%
least four five four of those with
 
00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
individ five individual meetings one was
 
00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
around service authorization the rest
 
00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:15.200 align:start position:0%
was around cash flow so we're continuing
 
00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:17.680 align:start position:0%
to work with them and if we have to give
 
00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
manual payments we've been continuing to
 
00:48:23.870 --> 00:48:23.880 align:start position:0%
do that we have I know when we were at
 
00:48:27.710 --> 00:48:27.720 align:start position:0%
the um subcommittee on the 3 we talked
 
00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:29.960 align:start position:0%
about slowing down like that December
 
00:48:31.829 --> 00:48:31.839 align:start position:0%
payback and we've absolutely done that
 
00:48:33.829 --> 00:48:33.839 align:start position:0%
really on an individual basis really
 
00:48:36.030 --> 00:48:36.040 align:start position:0%
it's up to the agencies but we meet with
 
00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:38.520 align:start position:0%
them upon request
 
00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:41.240 align:start position:0%
immediately thank you you're welcome
 
00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:43.589 align:start position:0%
immediately thank you you're welcome
representative

00:48:43.589 --> 00:48:43.599 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:48:46.710 --> 00:48:46.720 align:start position:0%
Weber and I'll just note for having had
 
00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
a uh conversation with somebody from an
 
00:48:53.710 --> 00:48:53.720 align:start position:0%
agency fairly recently um there is still
 
00:48:56.510 --> 00:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
considerable anxiety out there about the
 
00:49:01.549 --> 00:49:01.559 align:start position:0%
payback issue so that that needs to be
 
00:49:06.789 --> 00:49:06.799 align:start position:0%
communicated more more Yep clearly I if
 
00:49:10.470 --> 00:49:10.480 align:start position:0%
um I totally agree not necessarily to me
 
00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
and the other piece that uh is causing a
 
00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:16.160 align:start position:0%
great deal of heartburn other than the
 
00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
how do we enter things properly into the
 
00:49:21.549 --> 00:49:21.559 align:start position:0%
system so that we can actually get
 
00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
reimbursed and the mess that that was um
 
00:49:28.109 --> 00:49:28.119 align:start position:0%
which is slowly I think being
 
00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:33.240 align:start position:0%
unraveled is is the issue of um direct
 
00:49:36.430 --> 00:49:36.440 align:start position:0%
entry for the services and and the whole
 
00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:38.240 align:start position:0%
issue of how do we do it when the cell
 
00:49:40.589 --> 00:49:40.599 align:start position:0%
phones don't work and that kind of thing
 
00:49:45.549 --> 00:49:45.559 align:start position:0%

out there but I know everybody's aware
 
00:49:51.549 --> 00:49:51.559 align:start position:0%

00:58:04.589 --> 00:58:04.599 align:start position:0%
question campaign uh which if you're not
 
00:58:07.390 --> 00:58:07.400 align:start position:0%
you're all most likely familiar with um
 
00:58:11.470 --> 00:58:11.480 align:start position:0%
is whereby a clinician care provider law
 
00:58:14.710 --> 00:58:14.720 align:start position:0%
enforcement teacher asks if one has
 
00:58:19.349 --> 00:58:19.359 align:start position:0%
asked if a family member or uh yourself
 
00:58:22.430 --> 00:58:22.440 align:start position:0%
has served in the military and so that
 
00:58:24.990 --> 00:58:25.000 align:start position:0%
enables a provider to address the next
 
00:58:27.750 --> 00:58:27.760 align:start position:0%
level of care and a more targeted
 
00:58:30.470 --> 00:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
approach to Veterans
 
00:58:33.670 --> 00:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
healthare uh and then another initiative
 
00:58:36.150 --> 00:58:36.160 align:start position:0%
that the military leadership team and
 
00:58:40.510 --> 00:58:40.520 align:start position:0%
esac is assessing is addressing the Gap
 
00:58:44.029 --> 00:58:44.039 align:start position:0%
in uh Dental Health Care needs for our
 
00:58:44.039 --> 00:58:45.950 align:start position:0%
in uh Dental Health Care needs for our
veterans

00:58:45.950 --> 00:58:45.960 align:start position:0%
veterans
 
00:58:49.309 --> 00:58:49.319 align:start position:0%
um we are modeling our approach after
 
00:58:51.750 --> 00:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
the state of Maine the state of Maine
 
00:58:54.309 --> 00:58:54.319 align:start position:0%
and uh worked in coordination with
 
00:58:56.029 --> 00:58:56.039 align:start position:0%
northe de to
 
00:58:59.710 --> 00:58:59.720 align:start position:0%
dental uh to provide coverage for
 
00:59:03.190 --> 00:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
veterans that are cannot pay out a
 
00:59:06.190 --> 00:59:06.200 align:start position:0%
pocket or or do not have access to
 
00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:07.549 align:start position:0%
pocket or or do not have access to
dental

00:59:07.549 --> 00:59:07.559 align:start position:0%
dental
 
00:59:11.710 --> 00:59:11.720 align:start position:0%
insurance so in addition uh there are
 
00:59:15.270 --> 00:59:15.280 align:start position:0%
available services for veterans in
 
00:59:18.150 --> 00:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
isolated pockets of New Hampshire such
 
00:59:21.270 --> 00:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
as in North Country that will provide on
 
00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
a regional level
 
00:59:25.910 --> 00:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
assistance um we we do not have a
 
00:59:27.950 --> 00:59:27.960 align:start position:0%
Statewide program for that so we're
 
00:59:32.829 --> 00:59:32.839 align:start position:0%
currently uh looking into um looking
 
00:59:35.789 --> 00:59:35.799 align:start position:0%
into this through uh and
 
00:59:38.549 --> 00:59:38.559 align:start position:0%
assessing um the capacity and resources
 
00:59:39.710 --> 00:59:39.720 align:start position:0%
that are
 
00:59:44.270 --> 00:59:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:47.349 --> 00:59:47.359 align:start position:0%
time um in addition uh I'd like to
 
00:59:49.870 --> 00:59:49.880 align:start position:0%

this
 
01:05:18.910 --> 01:05:18.920 align:start position:0%
report would you say it's a lack of
 
01:05:21.549 --> 01:05:21.559 align:start position:0%
awareness um is it a question about
 
01:05:23.829 --> 01:05:23.839 align:start position:0%
availability of Workforce is it a
 
01:05:26.269 --> 01:05:26.279 align:start position:0%
question about locality in other words
 
01:05:29.710 --> 01:05:29.720 align:start position:0%
in the state of Hampshire we have one VA
 
01:05:31.789 --> 01:05:31.799 align:start position:0%
facility in Manchester we have another
 
01:05:33.510 --> 01:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
one in the border with Vermont way re
 
01:05:37.029 --> 01:05:37.039 align:start position:0%
Junction is a question of a
 
01:05:39.150 --> 01:05:39.160 align:start position:0%
awareness we don't have enough people to
 
01:05:41.309 --> 01:05:41.319 align:start position:0%
provide service to the veterans or they
 
01:05:42.750 --> 01:05:42.760 align:start position:0%
just don't have time or the ability to
 
01:05:47.269 --> 01:05:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:50.549 --> 01:05:50.559 align:start position:0%
service so just to understand your
 
01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
question um you wish to know if there is
 
01:05:57.829 --> 01:05:57.839 align:start position:0%
a lack of capacity to is it a lack of
 
01:05:59.549 --> 01:05:59.559 align:start position:0%
the veterans being aware of what's going
 
01:06:01.630 --> 01:06:01.640 align:start position:0%
on what's available to them is it a
 
01:06:03.230 --> 01:06:03.240 align:start position:0%
question of lack of capacity which is
 
01:06:06.269 --> 01:06:06.279 align:start position:0%
really driven by the workforce or is it
 
01:06:09.789 --> 01:06:09.799 align:start position:0%
a a lack of um access in a sense of
 
01:06:12.269 --> 01:06:12.279 align:start position:0%
geographically if I live in Burlington
 
01:06:14.309 --> 01:06:14.319 align:start position:0%
bermont sorry Burlington New Hampshire
 
01:06:15.470 --> 01:06:15.480 align:start position:0%
and I have to go all the way down to
 
01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:17.400 align:start position:0%
Manchester it becomes a difficult
 
01:06:22.789 --> 01:06:22.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:27.109 --> 01:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
there um in terms of the the needs um
 
01:06:29.309 --> 01:06:29.319 align:start position:0%
part of the snapshot that was provided
 
01:06:32.549 --> 01:06:32.559 align:start position:0%
in the packet really does um outline a
 
01:06:35.910 --> 01:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
couple of the needs that we focus on um
 
01:06:38.589 --> 01:06:38.599 align:start position:0%
one of those is the coordinated um
 
01:06:40.670 --> 01:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
referral and assistance which really is
 
01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
you need we need to make sure that uh
 
01:06:45.269 --> 01:06:45.279 align:start position:0%
veteran service members and their
 
01:06:48.390 --> 01:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
families have increased awareness so you
 
01:06:50.589 --> 01:06:50.599 align:start position:0%
know that definitely is part of the
 
01:06:52.910 --> 01:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
initiatives and efforts it's weaved in
 
01:06:55.910 --> 01:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
everywhere um um the other is uh
 
01:06:58.630 --> 01:06:58.640 align:start position:0%
increasing the capacity for community-
 
01:07:01.549 --> 01:07:01.559 align:start position:0%
Based Services um and having that
 
01:07:04.910 --> 01:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
Equitable across all regions um so
 
01:07:06.309 --> 01:07:06.319 align:start position:0%
that's certainly something that we're
 
01:07:09.430 --> 01:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
looking at when we do uh our listening
 
01:07:12.750 --> 01:07:12.760 align:start position:0%
sessions or gaps analysis in terms of uh
 
01:07:15.630 --> 01:07:15.640 align:start position:0%
what may be available to individuals and
 
01:07:18.829 --> 01:07:18.839 align:start position:0%
uh veterans uh military service members
 
01:07:21.510 --> 01:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
and their families are are part of that
 
01:07:24.390 --> 01:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
uh population that we're working with um
 
01:07:26.950 --> 01:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
and certainly with the with the veteran
 
01:07:30.430 --> 01:07:30.440 align:start position:0%
service officers the goal primarily is
 
01:07:32.630 --> 01:07:32.640 align:start position:0%
to make sure PE more people have
 
01:07:34.829 --> 01:07:34.839 align:start position:0%
increased access to the to the VA
 
01:07:37.390 --> 01:07:37.400 align:start position:0%
enrollment and what that process looks
 
01:07:39.390 --> 01:07:39.400 align:start position:0%
like and being able to support them
 
01:07:44.069 --> 01:07:44.079 align:start position:0%
through that thank you representative
 
01:07:46.269 --> 01:07:46.279 align:start position:0%
Weber this is mostly going to be
 
01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
observations and some of it's a plea if
 
01:07:51.870 --> 01:07:51.880 align:start position:0%
if I were a veteran I wouldn't know
 
01:07:54.150 --> 01:07:54.160 align:start position:0%
whether I needed to go because I in
 
01:07:57.549 --> 01:07:57.559 align:start position:0%
Chester County to the Keen Veteran
 
01:08:00.589 --> 01:08:00.599 align:start position:0%
Center to the White River Junction VA
 
01:08:03.069 --> 01:08:03.079 align:start position:0%
Center to the Manchester VA Center or
 
01:08:04.950 --> 01:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
would I call the community behavioral
 
01:08:07.630 --> 01:08:07.640 align:start position:0%
health center or would I contact Nami or
 
01:08:10.109 --> 01:08:10.119 align:start position:0%
would I try and get through to 211 which
 
01:08:12.870 --> 01:08:12.880 align:start position:0%
is sometimes not as helpful as it might
 
01:08:17.390 --> 01:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
be and so I'm going to do the thing that
 
01:08:19.110 --> 01:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
I've done in the context of any number
 
01:08:22.630 --> 01:08:22.640 align:start position:0%
of other agencies and say I have 20
 
01:08:24.749 --> 01:08:24.759 align:start position:0%
years of formal education and a law
 
01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
degree and I'm a
 
01:08:28.829 --> 01:08:28.839 align:start position:0%
representative and I have access to a
 
01:08:31.510 --> 01:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
lot of people to explain things to me
 
01:08:34.870 --> 01:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
and I have a good computer and I can't
 
01:08:38.910 --> 01:08:38.920 align:start position:0%
figure this out so if I don't have good
 
01:08:41.070 --> 01:08:41.080 align:start position:0%
access to Computer Services and people
 
01:08:45.390 --> 01:08:45.400 align:start position:0%
who can help explain it to me uh what
 
01:08:48.669 --> 01:08:48.679 align:start position:0%
I've heard today is who is liazon with
 
01:08:51.910 --> 01:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
who and partnering with who and making
 
01:08:54.309 --> 01:08:54.319 align:start position:0%
uh a a web with who
 
01:08:58.149 --> 01:08:58.159 align:start position:0%
and I wind up with an image in my mind
 
01:09:01.070 --> 01:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
of a giant spider web where everybody's
 
01:09:02.870 --> 01:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
talking to everybody else about who's
 
01:09:06.430 --> 01:09:06.440 align:start position:0%
talking to whom and I'm still not clear
 
01:09:09.189 --> 01:09:09.199 align:start position:0%
who's providing the services or where
 
01:09:13.470 --> 01:09:13.480 align:start position:0%
and um I know that in the context of
 
01:09:16.870 --> 01:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Access for the general
 
01:09:21.390 --> 01:09:21.400 align:start position:0%
population we talk about no wrong door
 
01:09:24.189 --> 01:09:24.199 align:start position:0%
and we talk about getting people to the
 
01:09:29.070 --> 01:09:29.080 align:start position:0%
services they need but dear God could we
 
01:09:31.030 --> 01:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
have fewer
 
01:09:33.829 --> 01:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
doors and you
 
01:09:39.070 --> 01:09:39.080 align:start position:0%
know a simpler and more direct line to
 
01:09:41.630 --> 01:09:41.640 align:start position:0%
Services overall I know that's not
 
01:09:43.070 --> 01:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
something you're going to do by next
 
01:09:46.470 --> 01:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
Friday but it's a plea that I make
 
01:09:50.149 --> 01:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
because um I sometimes try and explain
 
01:09:53.829 --> 01:09:53.839 align:start position:0%
to constituents where they find services
 
01:09:56.709 --> 01:09:56.719 align:start position:0%
and when it's hard for me and I've been
 
01:09:58.590 --> 01:09:58.600 align:start position:0%
serving on Health and Human Services for
 
01:10:01.830 --> 01:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
six or eight years now if I can't find
 
01:10:03.390 --> 01:10:03.400 align:start position:0%
where they should
 
01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
go then how are they going to find it I
 
01:10:08.350 --> 01:10:08.360 align:start position:0%
mean I I always do but that's usually
 
01:10:11.470 --> 01:10:11.480 align:start position:0%
because I call our Mr Williams and he
 
01:10:14.030 --> 01:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
points me in the right direction and not
 
01:10:15.669 --> 01:10:15.679 align:start position:0%
everybody can do that he can't do that
 
01:10:19.110 --> 01:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
for everybody in the State uh so I I
 
01:10:22.750 --> 01:10:22.760 align:start position:0%
just I'm really concerned about the
 
01:10:25.270 --> 01:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
number of different
 
01:10:27.350 --> 01:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
little the number of different
 
01:10:29.709 --> 01:10:29.719 align:start position:0%
organizations that each have a little
 
01:10:31.630 --> 01:10:31.640 align:start position:0%
tiny piece of the
 
01:10:34.310 --> 01:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
pie uh but I'm afraid that there are an
 
01:10:36.510 --> 01:10:36.520 align:start position:0%
awful lot of veterans who are getting no
 
01:10:39.910 --> 01:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
pie so I I just throw that out there
 
01:10:42.030 --> 01:10:42.040 align:start position:0%
because it's a real concern to me and
 
01:10:43.750 --> 01:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
I'm sure it's a real concern to you as
 
01:10:45.709 --> 01:10:45.719 align:start position:0%
well CU I know that you're I know that
 
01:10:48.390 --> 01:10:48.400 align:start position:0%
you're working hard on it but it's it's
 
01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:51.350 align:start position:0%
you're working hard on it but it's it's
not

01:10:51.350 --> 01:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:55.390 --> 01:10:55.400 align:start position:0%
easy thank you chair has a question
 
01:10:58.950 --> 01:10:58.960 align:start position:0%
speaking of uh Mr Williams He regularly
 
01:11:02.229 --> 01:11:02.239 align:start position:0%
appes us with a document called
 
01:11:05.870 --> 01:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
DHHS contact list for constituent
 
01:11:08.709 --> 01:11:08.719 align:start position:0%
referrals and I'm looking down on page
 
01:11:13.229 --> 01:11:13.239 align:start position:0%
two to um elderly long-term supports and
 
01:11:15.950 --> 01:11:15.960 align:start position:0%
services indent elderly and Adult
 
01:11:19.870 --> 01:11:19.880 align:start position:0%
Services skip a line when the ultimate
 
01:11:22.350 --> 01:11:22.360 align:start position:0%
administrator but the line I skip talks
 
01:11:25.270 --> 01:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
about community service is nursing home
 
01:11:27.990 --> 01:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
and residential care I don't see
 
01:11:31.590 --> 01:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:34.550 --> 01:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
I we wouldn't necessarily specifically
 
01:11:38.470 --> 01:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
identify a one population we serve all
 
01:11:42.669 --> 01:11:42.679 align:start position:0%
populations all pairs so um in terms of
 
01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
whether or not somebody's served in the
 
01:11:46.629 --> 01:11:46.639 align:start position:0%
military or they have family who served
 
01:11:48.390 --> 01:11:48.400 align:start position:0%
in the military that's something that we
 
01:11:52.270 --> 01:11:52.280 align:start position:0%
would ask um based on them you know
 
01:11:55.350 --> 01:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
contacting us and providing you know a
 
01:11:59.790 --> 01:11:59.800 align:start position:0%
warm handoff to um an organization or
 
01:12:02.590 --> 01:12:02.600 align:start position:0%
one of our um one of our program staff
 
01:12:05.310 --> 01:12:05.320 align:start position:0%
within the bureau if they had a specific
 
01:12:08.470 --> 01:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
question or need um that may relate to
 
01:12:10.990 --> 01:12:11.000 align:start position:0%
their connection um to being a veteran
 
01:12:13.390 --> 01:12:13.400 align:start position:0%
or a service member allow me to
 
01:12:15.669 --> 01:12:15.679 align:start position:0%
disagree the line item speaks
 
01:12:18.189 --> 01:12:18.199 align:start position:0%
specifically of nursing homes and then
 
01:12:20.030 --> 01:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
we get down a little bit further and we
 
01:12:22.070 --> 01:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
talk about seniors with mental health
 
01:12:24.270 --> 01:12:24.280 align:start position:0%
needs I'm reading this do doent and I'm
 
01:12:25.709 --> 01:12:25.719 align:start position:0%
seeing some nice
 
01:12:28.870 --> 01:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
breakouts this doesn't help me in terms
 
01:12:32.070 --> 01:12:32.080 align:start position:0%
of what representative Weber isn't
 
01:12:35.910 --> 01:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
feeling helped with this needs this
 
01:12:37.550 --> 01:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
document I appreciate it it's better
 
01:12:39.709 --> 01:12:39.719 align:start position:0%
than none when I was growing up I never
 
01:12:42.550 --> 01:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
had anything like this this is wonderful
 
01:12:44.870 --> 01:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
it's not enough if you want to make it
 
01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:46.189 align:start position:0%
it's not enough if you want to make it
four

01:12:46.189 --> 01:12:46.199 align:start position:0%
four
 
01:12:49.950 --> 01:12:49.960 align:start position:0%
pages fine but I want to be able to see
 
01:12:52.470 --> 01:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
under the subheadings and the sub
 
01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:53.990 align:start position:0%
under the subheadings and the sub
subheadings

01:12:53.990 --> 01:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
subheadings
 
01:12:58.750 --> 01:12:58.760 align:start position:0%
a lot more breakouts as to whom I
 
01:13:01.629 --> 01:13:01.639 align:start position:0%
call and not just on your line item
 
01:13:03.189 --> 01:13:03.199 align:start position:0%
which I don't think you probably wrote I
 
01:13:05.149 --> 01:13:05.159 align:start position:0%
think somebody wrote it for
 
01:13:07.790 --> 01:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
you and some of the others this is a
 
01:13:10.350 --> 01:13:10.360 align:start position:0%
good start it's not enough that's my
 
01:13:13.110 --> 01:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
plea thank you and I'll pass that on to
 
01:13:15.590 --> 01:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
John Williams he's on vacation in North
 
01:13:18.510 --> 01:13:18.520 align:start position:0%
Carolina visiting he told me Mayberry
 
01:13:21.709 --> 01:13:21.719 align:start position:0%
and Andy and goober and Gomer and and
 
01:13:24.270 --> 01:13:24.280 align:start position:0%
Barney 5 he said that actually in
 
01:13:26.310 --> 01:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
uh but when he gets back yes this would
 
01:13:28.870 --> 01:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
be very helpful in the next addition
 
01:13:30.830 --> 01:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone
 
01:13:34.350 --> 01:13:34.360 align:start position:0%
else chairman yes uh representative
 
01:13:36.390 --> 01:13:36.400 align:start position:0%
McDonald thank you Mr chairman let's
 
01:13:38.590 --> 01:13:38.600 align:start position:0%
hope Andy doesn't arrest Mr Williams
 
01:13:40.310 --> 01:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
while he's down that be Barney anyway
 
01:13:43.790 --> 01:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
but um I'd always heard and and I don't
 
01:13:44.790 --> 01:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
think it's in here and I don't think
 
01:13:47.629 --> 01:13:47.639 align:start position:0%
you've addressed it New Hampshire has if
 
01:13:50.030 --> 01:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
not the highest per capita population of
 
01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
veterans we have one of the highest is
 
01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:52.350 align:start position:0%
veterans we have one of the highest is
that

01:13:52.350 --> 01:13:52.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:56.070 align:start position:0%
that
true

01:13:56.070 --> 01:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:59.310 --> 01:13:59.320 align:start position:0%
I believe we are in the top 10 sir okay
 
01:14:01.550 --> 01:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
top 10 okay so we're not the're not the
 
01:14:03.590 --> 01:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
most per capita than I because I had
 
01:14:06.950 --> 01:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
heard that I I'm but it's a fairly heavy
 
01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
per capita veterans population from what
 
01:14:13.629 --> 01:14:13.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:15.669 --> 01:14:15.679 align:start position:0%
or are you looking I know it's not
 
01:14:17.430 --> 01:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
broken out like that I'm just thinking
 
01:14:18.750 --> 01:14:18.760 align:start position:0%
that that that contributes to the
 
01:14:20.629 --> 01:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
problem that it's it's it's that heavy
 
01:14:23.870 --> 01:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
so anyway thank you
 
01:14:27.990 --> 01:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
anyone else any other
 
01:14:30.590 --> 01:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
questions thank you so much for coming
 
01:14:33.750 --> 01:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:38.870 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:14:38.870 --> 01:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:42.470 --> 01:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
and Report update regarding the use of
 
01:14:44.669 --> 01:14:44.679 align:start position:0%
restraints and the use of different
 
01:14:47.430 --> 01:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
modes of transportation of patients to
 
01:14:50.310 --> 01:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital or designated
 
01:14:52.750 --> 01:14:52.760 align:start position:0%
receiving facilities and this is a
 
01:14:56.070 --> 01:14:56.080 align:start position:0%
particular interest to mine because my
 
01:14:57.629 --> 01:14:57.639 align:start position:0%
other son not the one that's in the
 
01:14:59.950 --> 01:14:59.960 align:start position:0%
legislature he's on team red he's a fire
 
01:15:02.149 --> 01:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
Lieutenant but my younger son Michael
 
01:15:04.070 --> 01:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
who's team blue who's a corrections
 
01:15:06.750 --> 01:15:06.760 align:start position:0%
officer at a Maximum Security Prison in
 
01:15:09.229 --> 01:15:09.239 align:start position:0%
New York and he transports patients back
 
01:15:11.350 --> 01:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
and forth all the time so we've had long
 
01:15:12.750 --> 01:15:12.760 align:start position:0%
Chats on this so this is going to be
 
01:15:14.629 --> 01:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
fascinating to
 
01:15:20.470 --> 01:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
me I'll try to show restraints and my
 
01:15:22.870 --> 01:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
enthusiasm just for clarification when
 
01:15:24.709 --> 01:15:24.719 align:start position:0%
we talk talked about team red and team
 
01:15:27.390 --> 01:15:27.400 align:start position:0%
blue was that fire and police yes thank
 
01:15:29.870 --> 01:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
you welcome they have a hockey game
 
01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:31.470 align:start position:0%
you welcome they have a hockey game
every

01:15:31.470 --> 01:15:31.480 align:start position:0%
every
 
01:15:33.910 --> 01:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
year well good afternoon Mr chairman
 
01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
members of the committee thank you for
 
01:15:37.629 --> 01:15:37.639 align:start position:0%
having me my name is Caroline Lavoy I'm
 
01:15:38.990 --> 01:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
the senior director of health
 
01:15:41.310 --> 01:15:41.320 align:start position:0%
information and analytics at the New
 
01:15:44.990 --> 01:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Hospital Association
 
01:15:47.990 --> 01:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
analy and I am Cynthia bonis and I'm
 
01:15:49.470 --> 01:15:49.480 align:start position:0%
here representing the New Hampshire
 
01:15:52.189 --> 01:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
hospital executive
 
01:15:55.110 --> 01:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
team and I'm going to walk you through
 
01:15:58.390 --> 01:15:58.400 align:start position:0%
the fourth iteration of this report but
 
01:16:00.310 --> 01:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
before I do so I do want to give just a
 
01:16:03.870 --> 01:16:03.880 align:start position:0%
little bit of background on why we are
 
01:16:06.990 --> 01:16:07.000 align:start position:0%
collecting and Reporting on this data to
 
01:16:10.270 --> 01:16:10.280 align:start position:0%
you so all patients designated as an
 
01:16:13.830 --> 01:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
involuntary emergency admission or iea
 
01:16:16.590 --> 01:16:16.600 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire must be transported
 
01:16:18.870 --> 01:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
from the emergency department from which
 
01:16:21.070 --> 01:16:21.080 align:start position:0%
they were admitted to New Hampshire
 
01:16:23.149 --> 01:16:23.159 align:start position:0%
hospital or another one of the six
 
01:16:26.229 --> 01:16:26.239 align:start position:0%
designated receiving facilities or drfs
 
01:16:28.510 --> 01:16:28.520 align:start position:0%
to receive the appropriate inpatient
 
01:16:31.750 --> 01:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
psychiatric treatment historically those
 
01:16:33.830 --> 01:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
transports were all done by law
 
01:16:36.790 --> 01:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
enforcement but Senate Bill 177
 
01:16:39.669 --> 01:16:39.679 align:start position:0%
effective January 1st of 2020 allowed
 
01:16:41.990 --> 01:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
for the explicit option to use an
 
01:16:44.590 --> 01:16:44.600 align:start position:0%
ambulance for the transport along with
 
01:16:46.830 --> 01:16:46.840 align:start position:0%
law enforcement and the idea was to
 
01:16:48.910 --> 01:16:48.920 align:start position:0%
reduced the number of restraints and
 
01:16:52.110 --> 01:16:52.120 align:start position:0%
Associated trauma um but still
 
01:16:54.950 --> 01:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
protecting everyone involved the patient
 
01:16:58.350 --> 01:16:58.360 align:start position:0%
the employees and the general public so
 
01:17:01.430 --> 01:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
now a provider who declares the Ia
 
01:17:03.110 --> 01:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
chooses the appropriate mode of
 
01:17:05.510 --> 01:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
transportation for the patient and the
 
01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
transport agency themselves decides if
 
01:17:12.550 --> 01:17:12.560 align:start position:0%
restraints are appropriate in the
 
01:17:14.950 --> 01:17:14.960 align:start position:0%
situation um in addition to these change
 
01:17:18.709 --> 01:17:18.719 align:start position:0%
in protocol uh the law also mandated
 
01:17:21.189 --> 01:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
that all the drfs report annually to
 
01:17:24.070 --> 01:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
this committee uh on the number of
 
01:17:26.350 --> 01:17:26.360 align:start position:0%
restraints broken down by age type of
 
01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
transport and restraint usage New
 
01:17:30.270 --> 01:17:30.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Hospital Association
 
01:17:32.830 --> 01:17:32.840 align:start position:0%
volunteered on behalf of its members to
 
01:17:35.310 --> 01:17:35.320 align:start position:0%
consolidate this and um bring it to the
 
01:17:38.189 --> 01:17:38.199 align:start position:0%
committee uh in a consistent
 
01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
manner so this is now the fourth report
 
01:17:43.950 --> 01:17:43.960 align:start position:0%
that uh is brought to the committee and
 
01:17:47.510 --> 01:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
it's covering the months of October 2022
 
01:17:49.870 --> 01:17:49.880 align:start position:0%
to September of
 
01:17:52.669 --> 01:17:52.679 align:start position:0%
2023 if we turn to the report itself so
 
01:17:54.390 --> 01:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
the top of page one just has a little
 
01:17:56.830 --> 01:17:56.840 align:start position:0%
bit more background on Senate Bill
 
01:17:59.390 --> 01:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
177 and the bottom of page one there's
 
01:18:01.270 --> 01:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
some summary statistics for you so there
 
01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:02.790 align:start position:0%
some summary statistics for you so there
were

01:18:02.790 --> 01:18:02.800 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:18:06.470 --> 01:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
1,146 IA transfers in this year that's
 
01:18:09.950 --> 01:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
an average of 96 per month 99% of those
 
01:18:13.149 --> 01:18:13.159 align:start position:0%
transports were adults um in time in
 
01:18:16.110 --> 01:18:16.120 align:start position:0%
terms of type of transport we have 38%
 
01:18:19.430 --> 01:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
by ambulance 61% by law enforcement and
 
01:18:21.669 --> 01:18:21.679 align:start position:0%
1% by other means and other means could
 
01:18:24.750 --> 01:18:24.760 align:start position:0%
be facility St family members that type
 
01:18:28.870 --> 01:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
of thing just over half of all
 
01:18:33.030 --> 01:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
transports did use restraints uh to move
 
01:18:35.229 --> 01:18:35.239 align:start position:0%
the patient and in terms of type of
 
01:18:37.390 --> 01:18:37.400 align:start position:0%
restraints used I have the breakdown
 
01:18:40.830 --> 01:18:40.840 align:start position:0%
there just about half were a combination
 
01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
and then there are others um handcuffs
 
01:18:45.189 --> 01:18:45.199 align:start position:0%
was spt only leg restraint
 
01:18:49.149 --> 01:18:49.159 align:start position:0%
only top of page two uh have a table
 
01:18:50.950 --> 01:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
here just shows you the breakdown of
 
01:18:53.550 --> 01:18:53.560 align:start position:0%
number of transports by drf to give you
 
01:18:57.709 --> 01:18:57.719 align:start position:0%
a sense the volume um each drf brings
 
01:19:00.590 --> 01:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
in and then the following sections are
 
01:19:03.870 --> 01:19:03.880 align:start position:0%
summaries of the different data points
 
01:19:05.629 --> 01:19:05.639 align:start position:0%
if you want to see more detail there is
 
01:19:08.110 --> 01:19:08.120 align:start position:0%
an appendix in the back with uh some
 
01:19:11.870 --> 01:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
tables for you so let's look at adults
 
01:19:16.430 --> 01:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
first we have the mode of transportation
 
01:19:20.189 --> 01:19:20.199 align:start position:0%
um about 61% of adults went by law
 
01:19:23.310 --> 01:19:23.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement 38% by ambulance and you can
 
01:19:25.910 --> 01:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
see by the chart that this stayed
 
01:19:29.790 --> 01:19:29.800 align:start position:0%
relatively consistent over the 12
 
01:19:32.189 --> 01:19:32.199 align:start position:0%
months the next page we're looking at
 
01:19:32.199 --> 01:19:33.350 align:start position:0%
months the next page we're looking at
restraint

01:19:33.350 --> 01:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
restraint
 
01:19:36.270 --> 01:19:36.280 align:start position:0%
application um for law enforcement it's
 
01:19:39.629 --> 01:19:39.639 align:start position:0%
about 86% of all adults transported by
 
01:19:42.110 --> 01:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
law enforcement had restraints applied
 
01:19:43.830 --> 01:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
for ambulance there were only two
 
01:19:46.350 --> 01:19:46.360 align:start position:0%
instances in the 12 months in which
 
01:19:47.950 --> 01:19:47.960 align:start position:0%
restraints were applied so you can see
 
01:19:50.910 --> 01:19:50.920 align:start position:0%
there's a very uh stark contrast between
 
01:19:53.669 --> 01:19:53.679 align:start position:0%
the two transport options in terms of
 
01:19:56.510 --> 01:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
restraint usage and then the following
 
01:19:58.950 --> 01:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
page we see just a breakdown of the type
 
01:20:02.590 --> 01:20:02.600 align:start position:0%
of restraints used by law enforcement um
 
01:20:06.070 --> 01:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
no one is really dominant over the
 
01:20:09.390 --> 01:20:09.400 align:start position:0%
others for the CH child transports there
 
01:20:11.910 --> 01:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
were only eight children transported as
 
01:20:15.070 --> 01:20:15.080 align:start position:0%
an iea in the 12-month period five by
 
01:20:17.990 --> 01:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
ambulance and three by law enforcement
 
01:20:20.350 --> 01:20:20.360 align:start position:0%
and restraint usage was divided directly
 
01:20:23.790 --> 01:20:23.800 align:start position:0%
by the type of transport
 
01:20:25.950 --> 01:20:25.960 align:start position:0%
ambulance using
 
01:20:28.910 --> 01:20:28.920 align:start position:0%
none then the next two pages since this
 
01:20:31.229 --> 01:20:31.239 align:start position:0%
is now the fourth iteration of the
 
01:20:35.149 --> 01:20:35.159 align:start position:0%
report gives you some trending data and
 
01:20:38.229 --> 01:20:38.239 align:start position:0%
to summarize the trends and other than a
 
01:20:41.070 --> 01:20:41.080 align:start position:0%
reduction in the average number of
 
01:20:43.910 --> 01:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
transports per month and the precipitous
 
01:20:46.669 --> 01:20:46.679 align:start position:0%
drop of children because of change in
 
01:20:49.830 --> 01:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
protocol things are remaining relatively
 
01:20:52.470 --> 01:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
stable across the years in terms of the
 
01:20:56.030 --> 01:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
type typ of um transport and how they're
 
01:20:59.229 --> 01:20:59.239 align:start position:0%
using restraints so we're seeing that
 
01:21:01.110 --> 01:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
the medical community is pretty
 
01:21:03.550 --> 01:21:03.560 align:start position:0%
consistent in their choices when it
 
01:21:05.830 --> 01:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
comes to iea
 
01:21:08.950 --> 01:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
transports and that's the summary for
 
01:21:12.910 --> 01:21:12.920 align:start position:0%
the year for report and open up for
 
01:21:15.470 --> 01:21:15.480 align:start position:0%
questions any questions yes
 
01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:16.750 align:start position:0%
questions any questions yes
representative

01:21:16.750 --> 01:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:21:19.189 --> 01:21:19.199 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you for the report and thank
 
01:21:20.750 --> 01:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
you for taking my
 
01:21:24.470 --> 01:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
question um so I'm delighted by the low
 
01:21:26.430 --> 01:21:26.440 align:start position:0%
number of transport of children but I
 
01:21:28.030 --> 01:21:28.040 align:start position:0%
want to know how the kids are getting
 
01:21:29.950 --> 01:21:29.960 align:start position:0%
from one place to another are they just
 
01:21:31.910 --> 01:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
being taken by their parents in most
 
01:21:34.790 --> 01:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
cases is that what
 
01:21:36.990 --> 01:21:37.000 align:start position:0%
happens the majority of children's
 
01:21:39.550 --> 01:21:39.560 align:start position:0%
admissions are voluntary they're not IA
 
01:21:42.030 --> 01:21:42.040 align:start position:0%
and so it would be a parent
 
01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:44.229 align:start position:0%
and so it would be a parent
transport

01:21:44.229 --> 01:21:44.239 align:start position:0%
transport
 
01:21:47.790 --> 01:21:47.800 align:start position:0%
okay in that case I'm kind of wondering
 
01:21:49.709 --> 01:21:49.719 align:start position:0%
if I've got a disconnect here somewhere
 
01:21:51.990 --> 01:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
because we hear about kids waiting in
 
01:21:54.510 --> 01:21:54.520 align:start position:0%
Waiting rooms in emergency
 
01:21:56.470 --> 01:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
rooms and they're waiting for a
 
01:21:58.310 --> 01:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
voluntary placement rather than an
 
01:22:00.350 --> 01:22:00.360 align:start position:0%
involuntary placement is that what's
 
01:22:02.590 --> 01:22:02.600 align:start position:0%
happening for children waiting in
 
01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:04.629 align:start position:0%
happening for children waiting in
emergency

01:22:04.629 --> 01:22:04.639 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
01:22:07.149 --> 01:22:07.159 align:start position:0%
rooms because children are minors their
 
01:22:08.950 --> 01:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
parents can admit them voluntary by
 
01:22:11.470 --> 01:22:11.480 align:start position:0%
Guardian to a facility so yes they are
 
01:22:12.910 --> 01:22:12.920 align:start position:0%
waiting in an emergency room for a
 
01:22:16.149 --> 01:22:16.159 align:start position:0%
voluntary by Guardian I gotcha okay that
 
01:22:21.550 --> 01:22:21.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:23.750 align:start position:0%
 
much

01:22:23.750 --> 01:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:22:33.990 --> 01:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:37.270 --> 01:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
much a l addition to
 
01:22:41.470 --> 01:22:41.480 align:start position:0%
the agenda representative Leah kushman
 
01:22:44.070 --> 01:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
has asked if she could make a brief
 
01:22:46.510 --> 01:22:46.520 align:start position:0%
presentation to us when I got the gist
 
01:22:50.310 --> 01:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
of it I felt this was in keeping with
 
01:22:52.870 --> 01:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
what this committee does we receive
 
01:22:57.070 --> 01:22:57.080 align:start position:0%
reports from DHHS but we also exercise
 
01:22:57.080 --> 01:22:58.030 align:start position:0%
reports from DHHS but we also exercise
some

01:22:58.030 --> 01:22:58.040 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:22:58.040 --> 01:22:59.950 align:start position:0%
some
oversight

01:22:59.950 --> 01:22:59.960 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
01:23:16.910 --> 01:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:19.110 --> 01:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
me thank you chairman
 
01:23:21.229 --> 01:23:21.239 align:start position:0%
Pearson thank you fellow members of the
 
01:23:23.590 --> 01:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
house did you hold off until we have the
 
01:23:26.030 --> 01:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
paperwork we're trying to figure out
 
01:23:29.070 --> 01:23:29.080 align:start position:0%
what is a I see stack yeah they're all
 
01:23:32.669 --> 01:23:32.679 align:start position:0%
just I figured it out okay vertical
 
01:23:37.709 --> 01:23:37.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:41.590 --> 01:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
that pre yes wow see we're not used to
 
01:23:43.350 --> 01:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
being spoiled like that well sometimes
 
01:23:45.990 --> 01:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
we are okay I know how fun it is to try
 
01:23:48.350 --> 01:23:48.360 align:start position:0%
to do that in the seat while someone's
 
01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:51.470 align:start position:0%
to do that in the seat while someone's
talking

01:23:51.470 --> 01:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:53.629 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:23:53.629 --> 01:23:53.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:23:55.870 --> 01:23:55.880 align:start position:0%
very good
 
01:23:59.110 --> 01:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
so um good morning for the record my
 
01:24:01.629 --> 01:24:01.639 align:start position:0%
name is Leah kushman um I'm an agent of
 
01:24:03.189 --> 01:24:03.199 align:start position:0%
the people serving in the general court
 
01:24:04.830 --> 01:24:04.840 align:start position:0%
representing you be closer to the
 
01:24:08.030 --> 01:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
microphone please bring it closer to me
 
01:24:09.510 --> 01:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
um Mr chairman I thank you for getting
 
01:24:11.189 --> 01:24:11.199 align:start position:0%
this matter before the committee um
 
01:24:12.830 --> 01:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
without delay I didn't have as much time
 
01:24:15.870 --> 01:24:15.880 align:start position:0%
to gather um stories and names of people
 
01:24:17.350 --> 01:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
who have dealt with the dayc carees in
 
01:24:19.709 --> 01:24:19.719 align:start position:0%
this issue specifically um but it's not
 
01:24:21.310 --> 01:24:21.320 align:start position:0%
as important as the Constitution and
 
01:24:23.470 --> 01:24:23.480 align:start position:0%
legal principles around um why this is
 
01:24:26.390 --> 01:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
an issue um it's all Focus there so
 
01:24:28.629 --> 01:24:28.639 align:start position:0%
after the LA uh over the last couple of
 
01:24:30.590 --> 01:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
years I've received numerous complaints
 
01:24:32.430 --> 01:24:32.440 align:start position:0%
about child care agencies denying
 
01:24:35.070 --> 01:24:35.080 align:start position:0%
exemptions to vaccination I had heard
 
01:24:37.950 --> 01:24:37.960 align:start position:0%
many stories and um directed people to
 
01:24:39.629 --> 01:24:39.639 align:start position:0%
the statute and said you know show this
 
01:24:42.470 --> 01:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
to them and um they should honor your
 
01:24:44.870 --> 01:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
exemption then I received an email from
 
01:24:47.629 --> 01:24:47.639 align:start position:0%
a woman who sent me a screenshot and it
 
01:24:50.790 --> 01:24:50.800 align:start position:0%
was of an email from the child care
 
01:24:52.629 --> 01:24:52.639 align:start position:0%
licensing unit which is under under the
 
01:24:54.510 --> 01:24:54.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:24:57.030 --> 01:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
to a child care agency um which you have
 
01:24:59.430 --> 01:24:59.440 align:start position:0%
there is the first page in the handouts
 
01:25:02.669 --> 01:25:02.679 align:start position:0%
and I believe what the uh cclu agent
 
01:25:04.470 --> 01:25:04.480 align:start position:0%
stated and that email is incorrect and
 
01:25:06.750 --> 01:25:06.760 align:start position:0%
they're not enforcing the law and even
 
01:25:08.910 --> 01:25:08.920 align:start position:0%
worse they're actively colluding with a
 
01:25:11.510 --> 01:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
licy to deny rights to the people under
 
01:25:13.590 --> 01:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
the law which is Mal Administration and
 
01:25:15.669 --> 01:25:15.679 align:start position:0%
now that they've received notice of this
 
01:25:17.350 --> 01:25:17.360 align:start position:0%
they continue it meiz to the level of
 
01:25:20.149 --> 01:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
malice um first I want to establish what
 
01:25:21.790 --> 01:25:21.800 align:start position:0%
rights are they're inalienable you'd
 
01:25:23.390 --> 01:25:23.400 align:start position:0%
have them even if the government didn't
 
01:25:25.470 --> 01:25:25.480 align:start position:0%
exist um and they would only be taken
 
01:25:27.470 --> 01:25:27.480 align:start position:0%
from you by force government exists only
 
01:25:28.910 --> 01:25:28.920 align:start position:0%
to protect you from having your rights
 
01:25:31.629 --> 01:25:31.639 align:start position:0%
unduly taken from others by force I've
 
01:25:33.270 --> 01:25:33.280 align:start position:0%
printed out for you some handouts if you
 
01:25:35.189 --> 01:25:35.199 align:start position:0%
look at the one with the Constitutional
 
01:25:38.149 --> 01:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
articles on it um I believe it's at the
 
01:25:40.510 --> 01:25:40.520 align:start position:0%
end of the first page or top of the SEC
 
01:25:43.470 --> 01:25:43.480 align:start position:0%
second of those uh article 38 a frequent
 
01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:44.590 align:start position:0%
second of those uh article 38 a frequent
frequent

01:25:44.590 --> 01:25:44.600 align:start position:0%
frequent
 
01:25:46.550 --> 01:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
recurrence um to the fundamental
 
01:25:48.350 --> 01:25:48.360 align:start position:0%
principles of the Constitution the
 
01:25:50.390 --> 01:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
people have a right to require of their
 
01:25:52.350 --> 01:25:52.360 align:start position:0%
lawgivers and magistrates an exact and
 
01:25:53.830 --> 01:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
constant observance of them in the
 
01:25:55.950 --> 01:25:55.960 align:start position:0%
formation and execution of the
 
01:25:59.189 --> 01:25:59.199 align:start position:0%
laws um that's why I'm walking us
 
01:26:01.910 --> 01:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
through the Constitution here um because
 
01:26:04.109 --> 01:26:04.119 align:start position:0%
it says that we frequently need to
 
01:26:06.669 --> 01:26:06.679 align:start position:0%
revert back to it and refer to it and
 
01:26:09.790 --> 01:26:09.800 align:start position:0%
look at it so part one um article one
 
01:26:11.709 --> 01:26:11.719 align:start position:0%
says all men are born equally free and
 
01:26:13.310 --> 01:26:13.320 align:start position:0%
independent therefore all government of
 
01:26:14.990 --> 01:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
right originates from the people is
 
01:26:16.870 --> 01:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
founded in consent and instituted for
 
01:26:19.629 --> 01:26:19.639 align:start position:0%
the general good article 3 says when men
 
01:26:21.189 --> 01:26:21.199 align:start position:0%
enter into a state of society they
 
01:26:22.590 --> 01:26:22.600 align:start position:0%
surrender up some of their natural
 
01:26:24.629 --> 01:26:24.639 align:start position:0%
rights to that Society in order to
 
01:26:26.270 --> 01:26:26.280 align:start position:0%
ensure the protection of others and
 
01:26:27.910 --> 01:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
without such an equivalent the surrender
 
01:26:30.310 --> 01:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
is void so government exists with the
 
01:26:33.709 --> 01:26:33.719 align:start position:0%
people's consent and they I just ask a
 
01:26:35.229 --> 01:26:35.239 align:start position:0%
point of order you may ask a point of
 
01:26:35.239 --> 01:26:37.870 align:start position:0%
point of order you may ask a point of
order

01:26:37.870 --> 01:26:37.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:41.109 --> 01:26:41.119 align:start position:0%
always these are con thank you and thank
 
01:26:44.149 --> 01:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
you for taking my inquiry it would be
 
01:26:46.950 --> 01:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
very helpful if I understood before you
 
01:26:49.669 --> 01:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
start reading the applicable
 
01:26:51.790 --> 01:26:51.800 align:start position:0%
constitutional principles if I
 
01:26:54.830 --> 01:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
understand what the problem is because
 
01:26:56.950 --> 01:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
I've heard the principles many many
 
01:26:58.830 --> 01:26:58.840 align:start position:0%
times and I don't know in what context
 
01:27:01.030 --> 01:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
you're addressing them except that it
 
01:27:02.669 --> 01:27:02.679 align:start position:0%
has something to do with child care
 
01:27:05.470 --> 01:27:05.480 align:start position:0%
licensing so if you could tell me what
 
01:27:08.070 --> 01:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
the actual problem that people are
 
01:27:11.590 --> 01:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
encountering is first and then explain
 
01:27:13.270 --> 01:27:13.280 align:start position:0%
the constitutional principles it would
 
01:27:15.750 --> 01:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
be really very helpful to me thank you
 
01:27:19.390 --> 01:27:19.400 align:start position:0%
um as I said a lot of people are being
 
01:27:22.229 --> 01:27:22.239 align:start position:0%
denied enrollment for child care because
 
01:27:27.270 --> 01:27:27.280 align:start position:0%
as they um are seeking to use their
 
01:27:29.910 --> 01:27:29.920 align:start position:0%
right to religious exemption um for
 
01:27:33.270 --> 01:27:33.280 align:start position:0%
vaccination requirements so um
 
01:27:35.030 --> 01:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
government exists with the people's
 
01:27:37.470 --> 01:27:37.480 align:start position:0%
concent again before you do this we want
 
01:27:41.430 --> 01:27:41.440 align:start position:0%
to nail this down some Child Care
 
01:27:45.109 --> 01:27:45.119 align:start position:0%
Facilities yes private businesses have
 
01:27:47.030 --> 01:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
are taking what they believe is their
 
01:27:51.350 --> 01:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
right to refuse to admit a child into
 
01:27:55.310 --> 01:27:55.320 align:start position:0%
their business into their group of kids
 
01:27:58.590 --> 01:27:58.600 align:start position:0%
uh because somebody is not immunized
 
01:28:02.109 --> 01:28:02.119 align:start position:0%
correct and your assertion is a private
 
01:28:04.950 --> 01:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
business does not have that right um not
 
01:28:06.910 --> 01:28:06.920 align:start position:0%
according to our well okay I I want to
 
01:28:07.790 --> 01:28:07.800 align:start position:0%
get the
 
01:28:10.910 --> 01:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
point point is that
 
01:28:15.229 --> 01:28:15.239 align:start position:0%
it that's the main gist of it yes okay
 
01:28:17.470 --> 01:28:17.480 align:start position:0%
any anyone want to continue to yes
 
01:28:19.189 --> 01:28:19.199 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant let be clear are
 
01:28:21.870 --> 01:28:21.880 align:start position:0%
we're talking about private business not
 
01:28:25.430 --> 01:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
a public entity can I finish my what I'm
 
01:28:28.510 --> 01:28:28.520 align:start position:0%
trying to because once I read this to
 
01:28:30.149 --> 01:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
you you'll understand where I'm going it
 
01:28:31.669 --> 01:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
depends if you're going to go through a
 
01:28:33.790 --> 01:28:33.800 align:start position:0%
whole long recitation of the
 
01:28:35.669 --> 01:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
Constitution no you may not I'm not
 
01:28:37.629 --> 01:28:37.639 align:start position:0%
going through a whole I'm going to go
 
01:28:39.669 --> 01:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
Point by point with the law and how
 
01:28:41.950 --> 01:28:41.960 align:start position:0%
they're violating it okay is everybody
 
01:28:45.229 --> 01:28:45.239 align:start position:0%
clear what the allegation is here that
 
01:28:47.950 --> 01:28:47.960 align:start position:0%
we're we're trying to deal with yes and
 
01:28:50.629 --> 01:28:50.639 align:start position:0%
no I'm I'm clear about the allegation
 
01:28:52.270 --> 01:28:52.280 align:start position:0%
I'm not clear why a private private
 
01:28:56.550 --> 01:28:56.560 align:start position:0%
business is required to
 
01:28:59.229 --> 01:28:59.239 align:start position:0%
um why a private business is not allowed
 
01:29:01.830 --> 01:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
to govern their own business
 
01:29:06.870 --> 01:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
practices M please I we're talking
 
01:29:09.669 --> 01:29:09.679 align:start position:0%
about private child care not Public
 
01:29:12.390 --> 01:29:12.400 align:start position:0%
Child Care are we talking about
 
01:29:15.430 --> 01:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
both uh New Hampshire law says a all
 
01:29:17.510 --> 01:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
child care agencies that are licensed
 
01:29:20.310 --> 01:29:20.320 align:start position:0%
and the licensing rules also say that
 
01:29:23.550 --> 01:29:23.560 align:start position:0%
they have to honor the exemptions
 
01:29:25.709 --> 01:29:25.719 align:start position:0%
so public or private so the private or
 
01:29:28.470 --> 01:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
public isn't really at issue because
 
01:29:29.950 --> 01:29:29.960 align:start position:0%
they're all licensed so therefore
 
01:29:34.030 --> 01:29:34.040 align:start position:0%
they're all under a public control I
 
01:29:36.109 --> 01:29:36.119 align:start position:0%
think we're asserting I think we're
 
01:29:39.070 --> 01:29:39.080 align:start position:0%
asserting that okay please continue
 
01:29:43.229 --> 01:29:43.239 align:start position:0%
thank you um so we're here to protect
 
01:29:47.390 --> 01:29:47.400 align:start position:0%
people's rights and um that's what
 
01:29:48.870 --> 01:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
legislators were doing when they created
 
01:29:53.830 --> 01:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
RSA 141 C 20-a and see those are um on
 
01:29:56.669 --> 01:29:56.679 align:start position:0%
that in that stapled packet there they
 
01:29:58.109 --> 01:29:58.119 align:start position:0%
imposed a requirement for the protection
 
01:29:59.629 --> 01:29:59.639 align:start position:0%
of rights of the whole but acknowledged
 
01:30:00.910 --> 01:30:00.920 align:start position:0%
and took due care to protect the
 
01:30:02.669 --> 01:30:02.679 align:start position:0%
inalienable rights of the minority at
 
01:30:05.510 --> 01:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
the same time um that statute says no
 
01:30:07.189 --> 01:30:07.199 align:start position:0%
child shall be enrolled without the
 
01:30:08.830 --> 01:30:08.840 align:start position:0%
required vaccinations partial
 
01:30:11.229 --> 01:30:11.239 align:start position:0%
vaccination or exemption then it refers
 
01:30:14.270 --> 01:30:14.280 align:start position:0%
to 141 c20c where exemptions for medical
 
01:30:15.950 --> 01:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
issues or religious beliefs are to be
 
01:30:18.310 --> 01:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
accepted in Le of vaccination so they
 
01:30:19.910 --> 01:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
created law that balance the rights of
 
01:30:21.390 --> 01:30:21.400 align:start position:0%
different people where they may conflict
 
01:30:22.950 --> 01:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
that's a problem Rule now the next
 
01:30:26.229 --> 01:30:26.239 align:start position:0%
statute RSA 170e talks about licenses
 
01:30:28.430 --> 01:30:28.440 align:start position:0%
being required for certain child care
 
01:30:30.910 --> 01:30:30.920 align:start position:0%
agencies um and they'll be issued in the
 
01:30:32.350 --> 01:30:32.360 align:start position:0%
form and matter as prescribed by the
 
01:30:34.750 --> 01:30:34.760 align:start position:0%
rules then you go to the rules further
 
01:30:39.189 --> 01:30:39.199 align:start position:0%
down and you see HC
 
01:30:42.229 --> 01:30:42.239 align:start position:0%
4210 D where it repeats the statute that
 
01:30:44.350 --> 01:30:44.360 align:start position:0%
the agency or leny shall request
 
01:30:46.470 --> 01:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
documentation on immunizations in
 
01:30:48.910 --> 01:30:48.920 align:start position:0%
accordance with RSA 141
 
01:30:52.430 --> 01:30:52.440 align:start position:0%
c2a and then in F that exemptions to
 
01:30:54.070 --> 01:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
immunization shall be in accordance with
 
01:30:59.109 --> 01:30:59.119 align:start position:0%
RSA 141 c 20- c the legislature put a
 
01:31:00.629 --> 01:31:00.639 align:start position:0%
requirement on schools and daycares that
 
01:31:01.990 --> 01:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
children who are enrolled shall be
 
01:31:03.790 --> 01:31:03.800 align:start position:0%
either vaccinated per statute or provide
 
01:31:06.390 --> 01:31:06.400 align:start position:0%
an exemption from the email from Melissa
 
01:31:07.990 --> 01:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
Clement the unit chief for the child
 
01:31:10.189 --> 01:31:10.199 align:start position:0%
care licensing unit she stated according
 
01:31:12.990 --> 01:31:13.000 align:start position:0%
to DHHS legal council and you have a
 
01:31:14.310 --> 01:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
copy of that there the public
 
01:31:16.510 --> 01:31:16.520 align:start position:0%
accommodation statute States it's
 
01:31:18.470 --> 01:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
unlawful for anyone including a private
 
01:31:20.390 --> 01:31:20.400 align:start position:0%
business to refuse withhold or deny any
 
01:31:22.229 --> 01:31:22.239 align:start position:0%
person accommodations ADV vages
 
01:31:24.070 --> 01:31:24.080 align:start position:0%

01:31:26.550 --> 01:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
sex race Creed color marital status
 
01:31:27.830 --> 01:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
physical or mental disability or
 
01:31:29.790 --> 01:31:29.800 align:start position:0%
national origin she goes on to say
 
01:31:31.390 --> 01:31:31.400 align:start position:0%
vaccination status is not a protected
 
01:31:33.390 --> 01:31:33.400 align:start position:0%
class under this law that is a
 
01:31:35.550 --> 01:31:35.560 align:start position:0%
deflection and is what I like to call a
 
01:31:37.470 --> 01:31:37.480 align:start position:0%
lawyer trick that controvers the
 
01:31:39.310 --> 01:31:39.320 align:start position:0%
controversy at hand is not whether
 
01:31:41.629 --> 01:31:41.639 align:start position:0%
someone has a protection protection for
 
01:31:43.270 --> 01:31:43.280 align:start position:0%
vaccination status it's whether they
 
01:31:45.310 --> 01:31:45.320 align:start position:0%
have a protection from discrimination
 
01:31:47.390 --> 01:31:47.400 align:start position:0%
for religious beliefs or disability as
 
01:31:48.910 --> 01:31:48.920 align:start position:0%
is afforded to them in the form of the
 
01:31:51.310 --> 01:31:51.320 align:start position:0%
right to exemptions it says Creed right
 
01:31:53.510 --> 01:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
there in the statute um that she
 
01:31:54.870 --> 01:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
referenced the constitution of New
 
01:31:56.510 --> 01:31:56.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire says Creed in part one Article
 
01:31:58.910 --> 01:31:58.920 align:start position:0%
2 that's on your handout today Creed has
 
01:32:00.669 --> 01:32:00.679 align:start position:0%
a more narrow meaning of official
 
01:32:02.070 --> 01:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
statement of faith of a religious
 
01:32:05.950 --> 01:32:05.960 align:start position:0%
institution but um in the time of the
 
01:32:09.229 --> 01:32:09.239 align:start position:0%
Constitution's writing uh the definition
 
01:32:11.950 --> 01:32:11.960 align:start position:0%
was more broad Noah Webster 1828 says
 
01:32:14.430 --> 01:32:14.440 align:start position:0%
it's that which is believed any system
 
01:32:15.870 --> 01:32:15.880 align:start position:0%
of principles which are believed or
 
01:32:18.870 --> 01:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
professed as a political Creed uh Creed
 
01:32:20.709 --> 01:32:20.719 align:start position:0%
is protected in our constitution freedom
 
01:32:22.470 --> 01:32:22.480 align:start position:0%
from religious discrimination is also
 
01:32:24.990 --> 01:32:25.000 align:start position:0%
required uh by the federal Civil Rights
 
01:32:27.470 --> 01:32:27.480 align:start position:0%
Act of 1964 in places of public
 
01:32:29.430 --> 01:32:29.440 align:start position:0%
accommodation disability is also
 
01:32:31.350 --> 01:32:31.360 align:start position:0%
protected um so a medical exemption
 
01:32:32.470 --> 01:32:32.480 align:start position:0%
would fall under that under the
 
01:32:34.590 --> 01:32:34.600 align:start position:0%
Americans with Disabilities Act these
 
01:32:35.870 --> 01:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
are protected rights per the
 
01:32:38.390 --> 01:32:38.400 align:start position:0%
Constitution and federal and state law
 
01:32:40.189 --> 01:32:40.199 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman we hear a lot of talk about
 
01:32:41.750 --> 01:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
the rights of private businesses if a
 
01:32:43.910 --> 01:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
business is incorporated it deres its
 
01:32:45.830 --> 01:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
very existence from the legislature it
 
01:32:47.510 --> 01:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
was created through statute the
 
01:32:49.470 --> 01:32:49.480 align:start position:0%
legislature created the statutes that
 
01:32:51.669 --> 01:32:51.679 align:start position:0%
enable the creation of incorporate
 
01:32:54.030 --> 01:32:54.040 align:start position:0%
Incorporated entities such as es Corps
 
01:32:56.430 --> 01:32:56.440 align:start position:0%
llc's 501
 
01:32:59.390 --> 01:32:59.400 align:start position:0%
c3s can the legislature Grant Authority
 
01:33:01.750 --> 01:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
in statute to violate inalienable rights
 
01:33:04.109 --> 01:33:04.119 align:start position:0%
reserved back to the people no it
 
01:33:05.669 --> 01:33:05.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't have that Authority the
 
01:33:07.390 --> 01:33:07.400 align:start position:0%
legislature has no authority to violate
 
01:33:09.669 --> 01:33:09.679 align:start position:0%
those rights or delegate a violation of
 
01:33:12.910 --> 01:33:12.920 align:start position:0%
rights to to another entity maximum loss
 
01:33:15.070 --> 01:33:15.080 align:start position:0%
as the derivative power cannot be
 
01:33:16.430 --> 01:33:16.440 align:start position:0%
greater than the original from which
 
01:33:19.030 --> 01:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
it's derived Miranda versus Arizona
 
01:33:20.750 --> 01:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
where rights secured by the Constitution
 
01:33:22.470 --> 01:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
are involved they're can be no Ru making
 
01:33:25.310 --> 01:33:25.320 align:start position:0%
or legislation which would abgate them
 
01:33:27.470 --> 01:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
this is also true of lenses lur is a
 
01:33:29.790 --> 01:33:29.800 align:start position:0%
creation of the legislature I believe
 
01:33:31.629 --> 01:33:31.639 align:start position:0%
the legislature understood that in
 
01:33:34.270 --> 01:33:34.280 align:start position:0%
creating RSA 141c that while they could
 
01:33:35.590 --> 01:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
impose requirements for schools and
 
01:33:37.709 --> 01:33:37.719 align:start position:0%
daycares concerning vaccinations they
 
01:33:38.830 --> 01:33:38.840 align:start position:0%
also had to ensure they were not
 
01:33:40.189 --> 01:33:40.199 align:start position:0%
granting Authority for government or
 
01:33:42.149 --> 01:33:42.159 align:start position:0%
it's created entities to violate
 
01:33:44.189 --> 01:33:44.199 align:start position:0%
Constitution and federal law balance
 
01:33:47.550 --> 01:33:47.560 align:start position:0%
it's about balancing protected rights so
 
01:33:49.229 --> 01:33:49.239 align:start position:0%
um all government agencies and agents
 
01:33:50.910 --> 01:33:50.920 align:start position:0%
are bound to the highest law and
 
01:33:52.550 --> 01:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
expected to act act on behalf of the
 
01:33:54.109 --> 01:33:54.119 align:start position:0%
people and defend their rights so we've
 
01:33:56.229 --> 01:33:56.239 align:start position:0%
got the law creating balance of Rights
 
01:33:58.030 --> 01:33:58.040 align:start position:0%
in mind we have an agency created for
 
01:34:00.070 --> 01:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
common good of the people and entrusted
 
01:34:02.590 --> 01:34:02.600 align:start position:0%
to protect those rights we have a leny
 
01:34:04.070 --> 01:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
who agreed to play by the rules for a
 
01:34:06.950 --> 01:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
lure and if they're Incorporated they
 
01:34:08.790 --> 01:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
agreed to play by those rules in
 
01:34:11.430 --> 01:34:11.440 align:start position:0%
exchange for the sovereignty um to give
 
01:34:12.950 --> 01:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
up some sovereignty in exchange for the
 
01:34:14.830 --> 01:34:14.840 align:start position:0%
corporate Shield so the laws and
 
01:34:17.310 --> 01:34:17.320 align:start position:0%
approval laws and rules apply to these
 
01:34:19.590 --> 01:34:19.600 align:start position:0%
entities they don't apply to each child
 
01:34:21.310 --> 01:34:21.320 align:start position:0%
once they're enrolled only they apply to
 
01:34:23.030 --> 01:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
the agency as a whole and how it
 
01:34:25.669 --> 01:34:25.679 align:start position:0%
conducts its business so we have the
 
01:34:30.629 --> 01:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
exemption in the law um and I I just see
 
01:34:33.629 --> 01:34:33.639 align:start position:0%
a big problem with the agency and agents
 
01:34:37.270 --> 01:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
and the attorneys all paid by the people
 
01:34:38.590 --> 01:34:38.600 align:start position:0%
and granted their Authority by the
 
01:34:40.470 --> 01:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
people working together with the
 
01:34:42.510 --> 01:34:42.520 align:start position:0%
childcare licensing unit against the
 
01:34:46.709 --> 01:34:46.719 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights of the people um
 
01:34:48.870 --> 01:34:48.880 align:start position:0%
so on on your handout part one article 8
 
01:34:50.910 --> 01:34:50.920 align:start position:0%
it says all power residing originally in
 
01:34:52.550 --> 01:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
and derive from from the people all
 
01:34:53.950 --> 01:34:53.960 align:start position:0%
magistrates and officers of government
 
01:34:55.629 --> 01:34:55.639 align:start position:0%
are their substitutes and agents and all
 
01:34:57.750 --> 01:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
times accountable to them article 14
 
01:34:59.070 --> 01:34:59.080 align:start position:0%
says every subject of the state is
 
01:35:01.550 --> 01:35:01.560 align:start position:0%
entitled to a certain remedy um and it
 
01:35:03.030 --> 01:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
goes on to say that it should be
 
01:35:04.510 --> 01:35:04.520 align:start position:0%
complete and without denial and it
 
01:35:05.950 --> 01:35:05.960 align:start position:0%
should be promptly without delay and
 
01:35:08.310 --> 01:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
conformable to the laws so I'm just
 
01:35:10.550 --> 01:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
asking that we remedy this issue um here
 
01:35:12.790 --> 01:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
and now without delay restore the rights
 
01:35:14.270 --> 01:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
to the people as guaranteed to them in
 
01:35:15.550 --> 01:35:15.560 align:start position:0%
the Constitution and the federal and
 
01:35:19.990 --> 01:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
state laws um I I guess we just need the
 
01:35:23.229 --> 01:35:23.239 align:start position:0%
commissioner to to um give us a plan for
 
01:35:25.590 --> 01:35:25.600 align:start position:0%
that to be implemented that this
 
01:35:27.550 --> 01:35:27.560 align:start position:0%
practice of uh telling people that they
 
01:35:29.629 --> 01:35:29.639 align:start position:0%
don't have that
 
01:35:33.750 --> 01:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
right uh representative uh kushman in
 
01:35:36.070 --> 01:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
the letter that starts good afternoon
 
01:35:37.910 --> 01:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
representative kushman in the signed by
 
01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:39.149 align:start position:0%
representative kushman in the signed by
Melissa

01:35:39.149 --> 01:35:39.159 align:start position:0%
Melissa
 
01:35:42.709 --> 01:35:42.719 align:start position:0%
Clement um towards the end of the big
 
01:35:44.590 --> 01:35:44.600 align:start position:0%
paragraph in the middle people are not
 
01:35:49.550 --> 01:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
to be denied by age sex race Creed the
 
01:35:52.189 --> 01:35:52.199 align:start position:0%
word creed comes to Latin kredo
 
01:35:54.390 --> 01:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
I believe it is used in the beginning of
 
01:35:56.550 --> 01:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
the nyine crade and the apostles crade
 
01:35:59.350 --> 01:35:59.360 align:start position:0%
it is a religious statement broader than
 
01:36:03.070 --> 01:36:03.080 align:start position:0%
but it at least is that so
 
01:36:07.030 --> 01:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
therefore if I'm reading this correctly
 
01:36:11.910 --> 01:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
one's Creed is not a a legitimate reason
 
01:36:16.830 --> 01:36:16.840 align:start position:0%
to deny and then if I go over to 141
 
01:36:20.870 --> 01:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
c20c in the next handout apparent legal
 
01:36:23.790 --> 01:36:23.800 align:start position:0%
guardian a child should be exempt from
 
01:36:26.270 --> 01:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
immunization if the parent or legal
 
01:36:28.669 --> 01:36:28.679 align:start position:0%
guardian signs a form because of
 
01:36:32.149 --> 01:36:32.159 align:start position:0%
religious beliefs now that means the
 
01:36:35.629 --> 01:36:35.639 align:start position:0%
child can be exempt from having to have
 
01:36:39.590 --> 01:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
a vaccine um I'm not sure where daycare
 
01:36:42.590 --> 01:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
centers fit in under that exemption at
 
01:36:44.669 --> 01:36:44.679 align:start position:0%
the bottom of the page so I'm arguing
 
01:36:46.310 --> 01:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
both sides of this year I'm just trying
 
01:36:48.270 --> 01:36:48.280 align:start position:0%
to get stuff into evidence
 
01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:50.070 align:start position:0%
to get stuff into evidence
representative

01:36:50.070 --> 01:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:36:53.550 --> 01:36:53.560 align:start position:0%
Weber well that leads me to my comment
 
01:36:56.109 --> 01:36:56.119 align:start position:0%
which is we don't take evidence here I
 
01:36:58.270 --> 01:36:58.280 align:start position:0%
mean we listen to people but we are not
 
01:37:03.470 --> 01:37:03.480 align:start position:0%
an adjudicatory body and the remedy for
 
01:37:05.950 --> 01:37:05.960 align:start position:0%
a violation of the public accommodation
 
01:37:08.669 --> 01:37:08.679 align:start position:0%
statute or any of those other things
 
01:37:11.750 --> 01:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
lies not with us but with either the
 
01:37:16.310 --> 01:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:19.950 --> 01:37:19.960 align:start position:0%
courts respectfully I disagree how would
 
01:37:23.830 --> 01:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
that provide prompt and without delay uh
 
01:37:26.910 --> 01:37:26.920 align:start position:0%
remedy for rights violated we absolutely
 
01:37:29.830 --> 01:37:29.840 align:start position:0%
work with the Departments all the time
 
01:37:32.070 --> 01:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
and advise them on practices that may
 
01:37:35.070 --> 01:37:35.080 align:start position:0%
not be correct and this seems like the
 
01:37:37.709 --> 01:37:37.719 align:start position:0%
perfectly appropriate body to have that
 
01:37:39.990 --> 01:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
discussion with the Department say hey
 
01:37:42.350 --> 01:37:42.360 align:start position:0%
this is this practice is out of line
 
01:37:45.229 --> 01:37:45.239 align:start position:0%
with the Constitution and our laws and
 
01:37:47.310 --> 01:37:47.320 align:start position:0%
we would like you to change them
 
01:37:50.870 --> 01:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
representative Weber because what is the
 
01:37:53.910 --> 01:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
problem here is one person has the
 
01:37:56.950 --> 01:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
rights that you're talking about but if
 
01:38:00.589 --> 01:38:00.599 align:start position:0%
I have a child that I want to send to
 
01:38:03.149 --> 01:38:03.159 align:start position:0%
daycare and I don't want them to be
 
01:38:06.070 --> 01:38:06.080 align:start position:0%
exposed to things that I don't want them
 
01:38:09.790 --> 01:38:09.800 align:start position:0%
to be exposed to you are B there are two
 
01:38:12.030 --> 01:38:12.040 align:start position:0%
sets of people with two sets of Rights
 
01:38:14.470 --> 01:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
all all of which are
 
01:38:18.870 --> 01:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
important and The Balancing Act there is
 
01:38:22.510 --> 01:38:22.520 align:start position:0%
either for
 
01:38:24.790 --> 01:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
certainly the legislature is a part of
 
01:38:28.149 --> 01:38:28.159 align:start position:0%
it but if you feel that the existing
 
01:38:31.709 --> 01:38:31.719 align:start position:0%
laws are not being enforced
 
01:38:37.030 --> 01:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:41.350 --> 01:38:41.360 align:start position:0%
Judiciary it's to balance the rights of
 
01:38:44.310 --> 01:38:44.320 align:start position:0%
various parties all of whom have
 
01:38:47.310 --> 01:38:47.320 align:start position:0%
rights as opposed to accepting the
 
01:38:49.669 --> 01:38:49.679 align:start position:0%
rights of one set of people as absolute
 
01:38:52.430 --> 01:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
and the rights of other people as lesser
 
01:38:56.070 --> 01:38:56.080 align:start position:0%
than respectfully the right to Religious
 
01:38:57.830 --> 01:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
Freedom is in our Constitution and it's
 
01:38:59.510 --> 01:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
in our laws
 
01:39:03.910 --> 01:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
so to be argued but the other right that
 
01:39:06.070 --> 01:39:06.080 align:start position:0%
you mentioned is not a constitutional
 
01:39:09.830 --> 01:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
right fine I understand the the balance
 
01:39:13.830 --> 01:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
here excuse the question is is this the
 
01:39:16.910 --> 01:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
venue to solve this
 
01:39:19.189 --> 01:39:19.199 align:start position:0%
problem I think if the department is
 
01:39:21.669 --> 01:39:21.679 align:start position:0%
willing to listen
 
01:39:24.589 --> 01:39:24.599 align:start position:0%
and take heed of the notice that they've
 
01:39:26.109 --> 01:39:26.119 align:start position:0%
received that they're out of compliance
 
01:39:27.310 --> 01:39:27.320 align:start position:0%
with the law and they're failing to
 
01:39:30.149 --> 01:39:30.159 align:start position:0%
uphold the law then yes I think this is
 
01:39:31.790 --> 01:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
a perfectly fine
 
01:39:35.229 --> 01:39:35.239 align:start position:0%
venue I believe it's a venue to listen
 
01:39:37.589 --> 01:39:37.599 align:start position:0%
and that's why I granted you to come
 
01:39:39.750 --> 01:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
today I don't think we have the
 
01:39:42.709 --> 01:39:42.719 align:start position:0%
authority to enforce anything and tell
 
01:39:44.350 --> 01:39:44.360 align:start position:0%
them what they have to
 
01:39:47.310 --> 01:39:47.320 align:start position:0%
do um other members of the committee how
 
01:39:49.430 --> 01:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
do you read our
 
01:39:53.149 --> 01:39:53.159 align:start position:0%
charge I've explained my position okay I
 
01:39:55.629 --> 01:39:55.639 align:start position:0%
leave representative Murphy well thank
 
01:39:59.750 --> 01:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
you I I I I understand that the um the
 
01:40:03.510 --> 01:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
concern um and I would agree that if a
 
01:40:08.030 --> 01:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
child or any individual is um uh
 
01:40:10.390 --> 01:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
jeopardized um acceptance into a
 
01:40:12.990 --> 01:40:13.000 align:start position:0%
business or child care or any other
 
01:40:15.950 --> 01:40:15.960 align:start position:0%
organization based on their religion
 
01:40:17.470 --> 01:40:17.480 align:start position:0%
that's a problem that should be a
 
01:40:18.830 --> 01:40:18.840 align:start position:0%
problem and it is a problem in the
 
01:40:21.589 --> 01:40:21.599 align:start position:0%
Constitution as you pointed out
 
01:40:25.390 --> 01:40:25.400 align:start position:0%
however um to me if the parents have
 
01:40:28.109 --> 01:40:28.119 align:start position:0%
chosen not to have a vaccination given
 
01:40:29.550 --> 01:40:29.560 align:start position:0%
to the child because of religious
 
01:40:31.229 --> 01:40:31.239 align:start position:0%
beliefs that's entirely their
 
01:40:33.669 --> 01:40:33.679 align:start position:0%
prerogative I would think so my question
 
01:40:35.270 --> 01:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
is I would agree I I don't believe that
 
01:40:37.669 --> 01:40:37.679 align:start position:0%
we're the correct body to look at this
 
01:40:41.629 --> 01:40:41.639 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that this is basically um
 
01:40:44.589 --> 01:40:44.599 align:start position:0%
a question for the courts to decide um
 
01:40:47.149 --> 01:40:47.159 align:start position:0%
only because it is in statute that they
 
01:40:48.750 --> 01:40:48.760 align:start position:0%
cannot be discriminated against because
 
01:40:52.750 --> 01:40:52.760 align:start position:0%
of age sex Creed you know Etc but not
 
01:40:54.790 --> 01:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
necessarily vaccination I I you know and
 
01:40:57.589 --> 01:40:57.599 align:start position:0%
again regardless of private versus
 
01:41:00.709 --> 01:41:00.719 align:start position:0%
public um there there are so many other
 
01:41:02.550 --> 01:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
competing priorities including as
 
01:41:04.750 --> 01:41:04.760 align:start position:0%
representative Weber said other people's
 
01:41:08.189 --> 01:41:08.199 align:start position:0%
you know concerns and uh rights it
 
01:41:09.709 --> 01:41:09.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to me that this is the
 
01:41:11.589 --> 01:41:11.599 align:start position:0%
correct body to make that distinction it
 
01:41:13.629 --> 01:41:13.639 align:start position:0%
would seem to me like the courts of law
 
01:41:16.310 --> 01:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
should be the ones that handle
 
01:41:20.070 --> 01:41:20.080 align:start position:0%
this anyone else representative McDonald
 
01:41:21.870 --> 01:41:21.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman

Statute does anybody have a copy of the
 
01:41:28.709 --> 01:41:28.719 align:start position:0%
statute handy that so that we can know
 
01:41:34.629 --> 01:41:34.639 align:start position:0%

01:43:33.109 --> 01:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
further um does this
 
01:43:36.149 --> 01:43:36.159 align:start position:0%
group believe that having heard the
 
01:43:39.669 --> 01:43:39.679 align:start position:0%
charge to this group we should proceed
 
01:43:42.109 --> 01:43:42.119 align:start position:0%
and if so in what manner that will be
 
01:43:46.030 --> 01:43:46.040 align:start position:0%
the discussion representative
 
01:43:48.589 --> 01:43:48.599 align:start position:0%
King I first have to declare that I'm an
 
01:43:50.310 --> 01:43:50.320 align:start position:0%
engineer and I don't do well in these
 
01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:51.470 align:start position:0%
engineer and I don't do well in these
areas

01:43:51.470 --> 01:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
areas
 
01:43:55.550 --> 01:43:55.560 align:start position:0%
is um but if if I
 
01:43:58.709 --> 01:43:58.719 align:start position:0%
can the way I look at this is that a
 
01:44:01.990 --> 01:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
charge has been made not that we're here
 
01:44:07.990 --> 01:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
to make the decision on what needs to
 
01:44:13.470 --> 01:44:13.480 align:start position:0%
be uh executed or uh determined it's
 
01:44:13.480 --> 01:44:14.470 align:start position:0%
be uh executed or uh determined it's
just

01:44:14.470 --> 01:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:44:17.589 --> 01:44:17.599 align:start position:0%
that we could be the committee that
 
01:44:19.589 --> 01:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
brings it to the
 
01:44:23.510 --> 01:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
DHHS to be reviewed and and a response
 
01:44:25.189 --> 01:44:25.199 align:start position:0%
made and matter fact I think I heard
 
01:44:26.790 --> 01:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
representative kushman make that
 
01:44:29.229 --> 01:44:29.239 align:start position:0%
reference at one point that she was
 
01:44:32.870 --> 01:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
looking for a plan or maybe a statement
 
01:44:36.070 --> 01:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
from the commissioner on what they have
 
01:44:38.709 --> 01:44:38.719 align:start position:0%
found and if we if that's not
 
01:44:40.669 --> 01:44:40.679 align:start position:0%
satisfactory then she could take it to
 
01:44:44.870 --> 01:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
the next level and U and then take it to
 
01:44:48.510 --> 01:44:48.520 align:start position:0%
a court of law that's what I've heard
 
01:44:52.149 --> 01:44:52.159 align:start position:0%
but then again I am an engineer
 
01:44:54.669 --> 01:44:54.679 align:start position:0%
other members representative Merchant
 
01:44:56.990 --> 01:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:44:58.910 --> 01:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
taking the question representative
 
01:45:01.830 --> 01:45:01.840 align:start position:0%
kishman I think there's also another
 
01:45:05.430 --> 01:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
Avenue to explore ABA through the
 
01:45:07.709 --> 01:45:07.719 align:start position:0%
process there's the issue going to the
 
01:45:09.109 --> 01:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
courts and trying to resolve the
 
01:45:12.510 --> 01:45:12.520 align:start position:0%
conflict between rights you could also
 
01:45:15.589 --> 01:45:15.599 align:start position:0%
as a legislator introduce a bill to
 
01:45:18.030 --> 01:45:18.040 align:start position:0%
clarify it and maybe that's another
 
01:45:20.950 --> 01:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
Avenue for one to consider because if I
 
01:45:23.550 --> 01:45:23.560 align:start position:0%
read through on the RSA
 
01:45:23.560 --> 01:45:25.270 align:start position:0%
read through on the RSA
126

01:45:25.270 --> 01:45:25.280 align:start position:0%
126
 
01:45:28.189 --> 01:45:28.199 align:start position:0%
A113 I don't see where the committee
 
01:45:30.950 --> 01:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
here has enforcement authority over the
 
01:45:32.790 --> 01:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
department and that's the part I'm
 
01:45:34.430 --> 01:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
trying to wrestle with I see a lot of
 
01:45:36.070 --> 01:45:36.080 align:start position:0%
things to do with coordination of care
 
01:45:38.790 --> 01:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
reports in that part of it but not so
 
01:45:40.629 --> 01:45:40.639 align:start position:0%
much the compliance or
 
01:45:44.510 --> 01:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement within the the RSA itself so
 
01:45:46.350 --> 01:45:46.360 align:start position:0%
I'm kind of reluctant to go down that
 
01:45:48.669 --> 01:45:48.679 align:start position:0%
path because of it but however I would
 
01:45:50.870 --> 01:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
also say as a representative you have
 
01:45:53.189 --> 01:45:53.199 align:start position:0%
the full Authority as a member of this
 
01:45:55.669 --> 01:45:55.679 align:start position:0%
legislative body to introduce a bill to
 
01:45:55.679 --> 01:45:56.910 align:start position:0%
legislative body to introduce a bill to
provide

01:45:56.910 --> 01:45:56.920 align:start position:0%
provide
 
01:46:01.750 --> 01:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
clarification thank you for for that um
 
01:46:04.669 --> 01:46:04.679 align:start position:0%
there anyone else in the committee I've
 
01:46:06.470 --> 01:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
shut your mic off anyone else in the
 
01:46:09.510 --> 01:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
committee want to give an answer to how
 
01:46:13.030 --> 01:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:15.430 --> 01:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
proceed I I think I think I've made it
 
01:46:16.950 --> 01:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
clear but I just want to say that I
 
01:46:19.550 --> 01:46:19.560 align:start position:0%
don't think this falls into our charge I
 
01:46:21.149 --> 01:46:21.159 align:start position:0%
think our charge is
 
01:46:24.030 --> 01:46:24.040 align:start position:0%
far more an administrative and
 
01:46:27.430 --> 01:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
Reporting thing we certainly don't have
 
01:46:30.149 --> 01:46:30.159 align:start position:0%
as far as I know the ability to tell the
 
01:46:31.510 --> 01:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner that they're going to do
 
01:46:34.270 --> 01:46:34.280 align:start position:0%
anything I think that the fact that the
 
01:46:37.709 --> 01:46:37.719 align:start position:0%
representative has brought to us this
 
01:46:41.070 --> 01:46:41.080 align:start position:0%
concern and it's been heard here uh that
 
01:46:43.149 --> 01:46:43.159 align:start position:0%
certainly the department will know that
 
01:46:45.350 --> 01:46:45.360 align:start position:0%
it is a concern but it has also been
 
01:46:48.750 --> 01:46:48.760 align:start position:0%
brought to them directly and I don't see
 
01:46:50.950 --> 01:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
what this committee can do consistent
 
01:46:55.070 --> 01:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
with separation of powers uh to compel
 
01:46:59.430 --> 01:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
them to do um something that they're not
 
01:47:02.830 --> 01:47:02.840 align:start position:0%
going to do anyway uh that would be
 
01:47:05.470 --> 01:47:05.480 align:start position:0%
either changing their mandate by
 
01:47:08.830 --> 01:47:08.840 align:start position:0%
changing the statute which you have a a
 
01:47:12.589 --> 01:47:12.599 align:start position:0%
road towards or
 
01:47:12.599 --> 01:47:14.790 align:start position:0%
road towards or
a

01:47:14.790 --> 01:47:14.800 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:47:17.669 --> 01:47:17.679 align:start position:0%
um resort to either the Human Rights
 
01:47:19.550 --> 01:47:19.560 align:start position:0%
Commission or the Judiciary as an
 
01:47:21.709 --> 01:47:21.719 align:start position:0%
Enforcement Act of what's already in
 
01:47:26.629 --> 01:47:26.639 align:start position:0%
place so uh th those are both I think
 
01:47:28.870 --> 01:47:28.880 align:start position:0%
more appropriate forums than this one
 
01:47:30.310 --> 01:47:30.320 align:start position:0%
because I don't think this is within our
 
01:47:32.669 --> 01:47:32.679 align:start position:0%
charge you may turn your mic back
 
01:47:35.990 --> 01:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
on thank you Mr chairman there's a whole
 
01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:37.270 align:start position:0%
on thank you Mr chairman there's a whole
section

01:47:37.270 --> 01:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:47:39.709 --> 01:47:39.719 align:start position:0%
under RSA
 
01:47:42.589 --> 01:47:42.599 align:start position:0%
126a colum 15 that has the duties of the
 
01:47:45.470 --> 01:47:45.480 align:start position:0%
oversight committee and it says it's
 
01:47:48.270 --> 01:47:48.280 align:start position:0%
include but not limited to
 
01:47:50.390 --> 01:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
analyzing and it goes down to the the
 
01:47:52.589 --> 01:47:52.599 align:start position:0%
fourth line reviewing alternate approach
 
01:47:55.109 --> 01:47:55.119 align:start position:0%
approaches to programmatic and
 
01:47:55.119 --> 01:47:56.550 align:start position:0%
approaches to programmatic and
administrative

01:47:56.550 --> 01:47:56.560 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
01:47:59.750 --> 01:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
concerns um
 
01:48:02.870 --> 01:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
and so that's where I felt that this was
 
01:48:04.870 --> 01:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
the appropriate committee um I
 
01:48:06.510 --> 01:48:06.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate at least being able to air
 
01:48:10.229 --> 01:48:10.239 align:start position:0%
the concern here in the public um and I
 
01:48:11.990 --> 01:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
I hope to work with the Department I
 
01:48:13.830 --> 01:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
don't want to have to bring legislation
 
01:48:15.270 --> 01:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't have to bring legislation
 
01:48:17.390 --> 01:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
for what's already in law and people
 
01:48:18.910 --> 01:48:18.920 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have to go to court to sue for
 
01:48:20.550 --> 01:48:20.560 align:start position:0%
what they already have a legal right to
 
01:48:22.229 --> 01:48:22.239 align:start position:0%
either would you give that reference
 
01:48:24.149 --> 01:48:24.159 align:start position:0%
again because I'm slow to write it down
 
01:48:26.510 --> 01:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
I want to look at up the charge to this
 
01:48:29.270 --> 01:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
committee where you believe perhaps we
 
01:48:30.990 --> 01:48:31.000 align:start position:0%
we could do something about that what's
 
01:48:33.990 --> 01:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
the um the number
 
01:48:37.510 --> 01:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
126-a col 15 Roman
 
01:48:40.910 --> 01:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
one okay
 
01:48:46.470 --> 01:48:46.480 align:start position:0%
um I I'm I propose yes you may please uh
 
01:48:49.189 --> 01:48:49.199 align:start position:0%
the I believe that the effective part of
 
01:48:51.790 --> 01:48:51.800 align:start position:0%
that says the committee shall provide
 
01:48:53.750 --> 01:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight of and
 
01:48:55.669 --> 01:48:55.679 align:start position:0%
informational meetings on this is what
 
01:48:58.149 --> 01:48:58.159 align:start position:0%
you were reading to us the programs
 
01:49:00.390 --> 01:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
policies and rules of the department as
 
01:49:01.870 --> 01:49:01.880 align:start position:0%
brought to its attention by committee
 
01:49:03.990 --> 01:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
members legislators Department Personnel
 
01:49:07.030 --> 01:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
or others so far so good but the
 
01:49:09.149 --> 01:49:09.159 align:start position:0%
committee shall monitor the efficiency
 
01:49:11.669 --> 01:49:11.679 align:start position:0%
of operation and the quality of services
 
01:49:13.790 --> 01:49:13.800 align:start position:0%
provided the committee's work may
 
01:49:16.189 --> 01:49:16.199 align:start position:0%
include but is not limited to analyzing
 
01:49:19.270 --> 01:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
the efficiency of selected programs uh
 
01:49:21.270 --> 01:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
studying the character istics of Target
 
01:49:23.990 --> 01:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
populations researching Trends affecting
 
01:49:26.750 --> 01:49:26.760 align:start position:0%
programs costs and participation and
 
01:49:28.750 --> 01:49:28.760 align:start position:0%
reviewing alternate approaches to
 
01:49:31.950 --> 01:49:31.960 align:start position:0%
programmatic and administrative concerns
 
01:49:32.990 --> 01:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
uh the committee may make
 
01:49:34.910 --> 01:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
recommendations to the committee
 
01:49:37.270 --> 01:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner and recommendations for
 
01:49:39.790 --> 01:49:39.800 align:start position:0%
legislation um and shall maintain
 
01:49:41.629 --> 01:49:41.639 align:start position:0%
Communications with the department and
 
01:49:44.310 --> 01:49:44.320 align:start position:0%
any other departments as necessary I
 
01:49:46.990 --> 01:49:47.000 align:start position:0%
still don't see that that provides the
 
01:49:51.430 --> 01:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
focus that you're concerned about as
 
01:49:55.589 --> 01:49:55.599 align:start position:0%
opposed to a more uh
 
01:49:55.599 --> 01:49:57.310 align:start position:0%
opposed to a more uh
narrowly

01:49:57.310 --> 01:49:57.320 align:start position:0%
narrowly
 
01:50:00.350 --> 01:50:00.360 align:start position:0%
administrative oversight so that's just
 
01:50:03.589 --> 01:50:03.599 align:start position:0%
me representative McDonald thank you Mr
 
01:50:05.910 --> 01:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
chairman um I'm new to this committee
 
01:50:08.030 --> 01:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
I've only been on it this year and I
 
01:50:10.830 --> 01:50:10.840 align:start position:0%
know that may be true of a number of US
 
01:50:12.750 --> 01:50:12.760 align:start position:0%
Representative um oh Mr chairman
 
01:50:14.229 --> 01:50:14.239 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson three years I
 
01:50:16.629 --> 01:50:16.639 align:start position:0%
know you you've been on it for three is
 
01:50:18.070 --> 01:50:18.080 align:start position:0%
have we ever got into any kind of
 
01:50:20.430 --> 01:50:20.440 align:start position:0%
enforcement or of anything of that
 
01:50:22.430 --> 01:50:22.440 align:start position:0%
nature and the history of the in your
 
01:50:24.790 --> 01:50:24.800 align:start position:0%
experience or I I've only served two
 
01:50:26.950 --> 01:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
terms on the committee I had a Hiatus
 
01:50:30.629 --> 01:50:30.639 align:start position:0%
last I've served years um I haven't I
 
01:50:32.470 --> 01:50:32.480 align:start position:0%
haven't seen or heard of them and and
 
01:50:34.030 --> 01:50:34.040 align:start position:0%
certainly in my work on the Health and
 
01:50:36.830 --> 01:50:36.840 align:start position:0%
Human Services committee the issues that
 
01:50:39.109 --> 01:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
we have referred to the committee when I
 
01:50:41.109 --> 01:50:41.119 align:start position:0%
was not sitting on it have been of a
 
01:50:45.390 --> 01:50:45.400 align:start position:0%
different nature why not this since this
 
01:50:49.030 --> 01:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
is going to take some thought I would
 
01:50:52.910 --> 01:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
propose that I send a memorandum to all
 
01:50:53.870 --> 01:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
of our
 
01:50:57.669 --> 01:50:57.679 align:start position:0%
members and um if you could email me the
 
01:51:00.229 --> 01:51:00.239 align:start position:0%
packets because I don't have a scanner
 
01:51:02.950 --> 01:51:02.960 align:start position:0%
to turn it into emails and I will send
 
01:51:05.510 --> 01:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
this to them and I will say the question
 
01:51:08.149 --> 01:51:08.159 align:start position:0%
I would like us to consider as a
 
01:51:10.950 --> 01:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
committee is is this something we should
 
01:51:14.629 --> 01:51:14.639 align:start position:0%
go forward with in other words a broad
 
01:51:16.589 --> 01:51:16.599 align:start position:0%
definition of what we can do versus a
 
01:51:20.149 --> 01:51:20.159 align:start position:0%
very narrow definition of it and if it
 
01:51:21.990 --> 01:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
is our conclusion we're not going to
 
01:51:23.589 --> 01:51:23.599 align:start position:0%
touch this we're not going to touch it
 
01:51:26.589 --> 01:51:26.599 align:start position:0%
and if it the majority of people think
 
01:51:28.750 --> 01:51:28.760 align:start position:0%
we should go forward with something at
 
01:51:30.870 --> 01:51:30.880 align:start position:0%
least maybe just a recommendation
 
01:51:32.870 --> 01:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
because we have no enforcement we will
 
01:51:35.589 --> 01:51:35.599 align:start position:0%
work towards that um how does that
 
01:51:38.069 --> 01:51:38.079 align:start position:0%
strike you all I don't think we can
 
01:51:40.430 --> 01:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
decide it today would we decide it by
 
01:51:42.550 --> 01:51:42.560 align:start position:0%
next month is my question representative
 
01:51:44.750 --> 01:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
Merchant I
 
01:51:47.709 --> 01:51:47.719 align:start position:0%
would ask the chair to consider reaching
 
01:51:50.550 --> 01:51:50.560 align:start position:0%
out to house counsel oh sure understand
 
01:51:51.990 --> 01:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
where we are because at this point in
 
01:51:53.910 --> 01:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
time I don't know if we have actually
 
01:51:56.990 --> 01:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
have any legal Authority in this Arena I
 
01:51:59.669 --> 01:51:59.679 align:start position:0%
think the house council could advise us
 
01:52:02.189 --> 01:52:02.199 align:start position:0%
on where we're treading so we don't very
 
01:52:05.270 --> 01:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
wise very wise thank you representative
 
01:52:09.149 --> 01:52:09.159 align:start position:0%
McDonald sure thank you Mr chairman I
 
01:52:11.430 --> 01:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
concur I mean there's a legitimate
 
01:52:13.109 --> 01:52:13.119 align:start position:0%
concern here representative kushman
 
01:52:16.109 --> 01:52:16.119 align:start position:0%
there's no question about that um but
 
01:52:17.870 --> 01:52:17.880 align:start position:0%
this committee needs to make sure we're
 
01:52:19.669 --> 01:52:19.679 align:start position:0%
operating within it within our bounds
 
01:52:21.629 --> 01:52:21.639 align:start position:0%
and if we don't then we could actually
 
01:52:24.430 --> 01:52:24.440 align:start position:0%
make it worse if we if we overstep and
 
01:52:27.629 --> 01:52:27.639 align:start position:0%
undermine our ability to to to even meet
 
01:52:29.510 --> 01:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
the you know the clear charge specified
 
01:52:32.950 --> 01:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
in statute so um I I would concur and I
 
01:52:35.470 --> 01:52:35.480 align:start position:0%
having worked with attorney Cy on other
 
01:52:38.069 --> 01:52:38.079 align:start position:0%
issues most recently uh subcommittee
 
01:52:39.550 --> 01:52:39.560 align:start position:0%
that representative Merchant and I were
 
01:52:41.709 --> 01:52:41.719 align:start position:0%
on he's very good he's very thorough and
 
01:52:42.990 --> 01:52:43.000 align:start position:0%
I and I think he can give us wise
 
01:52:45.189 --> 01:52:45.199 align:start position:0%
counsel so how's
 
01:52:47.550 --> 01:52:47.560 align:start position:0%
that thank you that that would be great
 
01:52:49.629 --> 01:52:49.639 align:start position:0%
yeah I just even if it just comes down
 
01:52:52.589 --> 01:52:52.599 align:start position:0%
to a recommendation to the you know that
 
01:52:54.669 --> 01:52:54.679 align:start position:0%
a legislative uh committee was looking
 
01:52:56.950 --> 01:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
at it and finds that it's inappropriate
 
01:52:57.870 --> 01:52:57.880 align:start position:0%
and that they should change their
 
01:53:00.109 --> 01:53:00.119 align:start position:0%
practices you know I wasn't saying that
 
01:53:02.669 --> 01:53:02.679 align:start position:0%
you guys you know go to the speaker and
 
01:53:05.510 --> 01:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
get a warrant and you know subpoena and
 
01:53:08.550 --> 01:53:08.560 align:start position:0%
yeah oh that crosses my mind on many
 
01:53:11.189 --> 01:53:11.199 align:start position:0%
occasions so thank you yeah and the
 
01:53:13.350 --> 01:53:13.360 align:start position:0%
restraints are put on me when I do thank
 
01:53:14.229 --> 01:53:14.239 align:start position:0%
you so
 
01:53:16.470 --> 01:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
much um is there anybody from the
 
01:53:18.870 --> 01:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
Department which wishes to speak to this
 
01:53:18.880 --> 01:53:20.310 align:start position:0%
Department which wishes to speak to this
issue

01:53:20.310 --> 01:53:20.320 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:53:22.430 --> 01:53:22.440 align:start position:0%
yes come on
 
01:53:34.470 --> 01:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:37.910 --> 01:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
here sorry hi uh for the record Melissa
 
01:53:39.310 --> 01:53:39.320 align:start position:0%
saier I'm the chief legal officer for
 
01:53:41.750 --> 01:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
the Department I oversee our legal
 
01:53:43.870 --> 01:53:43.880 align:start position:0%
services but I also oversee um our light
 
01:53:44.830 --> 01:53:44.840 align:start position:0%
our Bureau of Licensing and
 
01:53:47.149 --> 01:53:47.159 align:start position:0%
certification which includes childcare
 
01:53:51.310 --> 01:53:51.320 align:start position:0%
licensing um the and and I I agree with
 
01:53:53.910 --> 01:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
um representative kushman that you know
 
01:53:56.030 --> 01:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
there there may be a a valid reason I
 
01:53:57.910 --> 01:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
can't speak to um whether or not these
 
01:54:00.149 --> 01:54:00.159 align:start position:0%
individuals have a a right or a claim
 
01:54:03.750 --> 01:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
obviously um but I our childcare
 
01:54:06.830 --> 01:54:06.840 align:start position:0%
licensing rules they oversee the quality
 
01:54:09.830 --> 01:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
of services with that are provided by
 
01:54:13.229 --> 01:54:13.239 align:start position:0%
the Child Care Agency they don't oversee
 
01:54:17.189 --> 01:54:17.199 align:start position:0%
the kind of how they accept children
 
01:54:19.430 --> 01:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
into their program it really only has to
 
01:54:20.790 --> 01:54:20.800 align:start position:0%
do with the quality of services that are
 
01:54:23.189 --> 01:54:23.199 align:start position:0%
provided once they're actually there and
 
01:54:26.589 --> 01:54:26.599 align:start position:0%
in the program and so we do require them
 
01:54:30.790 --> 01:54:30.800 align:start position:0%
to have on record if it if if Public
 
01:54:32.669 --> 01:54:32.679 align:start position:0%
Health requires if our
 
01:54:35.430 --> 01:54:35.440 align:start position:0%
141c um statute requires that
 
01:54:37.910 --> 01:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
immunizations be on record that we
 
01:54:39.709 --> 01:54:39.719 align:start position:0%
require the Child Care Agency to hold
 
01:54:41.830 --> 01:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
those in their record and if there's an
 
01:54:43.990 --> 01:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
exemption they also have to have that
 
01:54:46.669 --> 01:54:46.679 align:start position:0%
exemption in their record for the child
 
01:54:48.430 --> 01:54:48.440 align:start position:0%
for the child that's in their care but
 
01:54:50.350 --> 01:54:50.360 align:start position:0%
we don't dictate who they can and cannot
 
01:54:52.109 --> 01:54:52.119 align:start position:0%
take in because it really only has to do
 
01:54:55.350 --> 01:54:55.360 align:start position:0%
with um 171e which is our our statute
 
01:54:57.149 --> 01:54:57.159 align:start position:0%
that talks about quality of Services of
 
01:55:00.310 --> 01:55:00.320 align:start position:0%
of the children in their charge um that
 
01:55:02.790 --> 01:55:02.800 align:start position:0%
that being said there is a statute
 
01:55:05.790 --> 01:55:05.800 align:start position:0%
around um discrimination for um certain
 
01:55:08.950 --> 01:55:08.960 align:start position:0%
aspects under R say 354a which is what
 
01:55:11.470 --> 01:55:11.480 align:start position:0%
was mentioned already if there is a
 
01:55:14.870 --> 01:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
discrimination uh uh any kind of you
 
01:55:16.149 --> 01:55:16.159 align:start position:0%
know discrimination that has been
 
01:55:18.709 --> 01:55:18.719 align:start position:0%
alleged at a childcare institution we
 
01:55:20.709 --> 01:55:20.719 align:start position:0%
would contact Department of Justice for
 
01:55:22.430 --> 01:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
them to handle that situation so it's
 
01:55:25.069 --> 01:55:25.079 align:start position:0%
not something that we um would deal with
 
01:55:26.629 --> 01:55:26.639 align:start position:0%
from a licensing perspective because
 
01:55:27.830 --> 01:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
like I said that has to do with the
 
01:55:29.990 --> 01:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
quality of services so it's really the
 
01:55:31.910 --> 01:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice who uh we would
 
01:55:33.149 --> 01:55:33.159 align:start position:0%
contact and just say there's been a
 
01:55:35.390 --> 01:55:35.400 align:start position:0%
claim that that there's discrimination
 
01:55:37.750 --> 01:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
against this um this family for you know
 
01:55:40.030 --> 01:55:40.040 align:start position:0%
the way that they're intaking children
 
01:55:41.550 --> 01:55:41.560 align:start position:0%
and and then we would leave it in their
 
01:55:43.310 --> 01:55:43.320 align:start position:0%
hands to investigate and and make a
 
01:55:45.709 --> 01:55:45.719 align:start position:0%
determination or they or the individual
 
01:55:46.870 --> 01:55:46.880 align:start position:0%
themselves the parent themselves can
 
01:55:48.870 --> 01:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
also seek their own counsel so that's
 
01:55:50.990 --> 01:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
essentially how we handle that um so
 
01:55:53.870 --> 01:55:53.880 align:start position:0%
even if we think about it for a month
 
01:55:56.350 --> 01:55:56.360 align:start position:0%
and come back and say hey let's let's uh
 
01:55:58.550 --> 01:55:58.560 align:start position:0%
send a memo to
 
01:56:02.069 --> 01:56:02.079 align:start position:0%
DHHS it isn't DHHS that would reive
 
01:56:06.109 --> 01:56:06.119 align:start position:0%
something cancel that meeting um the
 
01:56:09.069 --> 01:56:09.079 align:start position:0%
complaint would come to you folks yes if
 
01:56:10.229 --> 01:56:10.239 align:start position:0%
we got a complaint that there was a
 
01:56:11.310 --> 01:56:11.320 align:start position:0%
discrimination that there was a
 
01:56:13.629 --> 01:56:13.639 align:start position:0%
violation of that statute that's not our
 
01:56:15.870 --> 01:56:15.880 align:start position:0%
we only enforce RSA 170e that's all we
 
01:56:17.470 --> 01:56:17.480 align:start position:0%
have the authority to enforce under
 
01:56:19.910 --> 01:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
childcare licensing so other statute
 
01:56:21.310 --> 01:56:21.320 align:start position:0%
including the public health statute we
 
01:56:22.669 --> 01:56:22.679 align:start position:0%
would have to refer to Public Health if
 
01:56:25.390 --> 01:56:25.400 align:start position:0%
it were a one 354a discrimination
 
01:56:26.709 --> 01:56:26.719 align:start position:0%
statute we would have to refer to the
 
01:56:28.910 --> 01:56:28.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice or or as I said
 
01:56:29.870 --> 01:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
they would have to seat their own
 
01:56:32.229 --> 01:56:32.239 align:start position:0%
councel could the agreed citizen go to
 
01:56:35.149 --> 01:56:35.159 align:start position:0%
doj directly uh absolutely okay
 
01:56:35.159 --> 01:56:38.350 align:start position:0%
doj directly uh absolutely okay
absolutely

01:56:38.350 --> 01:56:38.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:41.870 --> 01:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
yep Mr chairman yes just to clarify
 
01:56:43.550 --> 01:56:43.560 align:start position:0%
which meeting did you want to
 
01:56:47.510 --> 01:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
cancel uh not next month the the um the
 
01:56:49.109 --> 01:56:49.119 align:start position:0%
scanning all of these documents and
 
01:56:51.550 --> 01:56:51.560 align:start position:0%
sending everybody an email and coming to
 
01:56:53.750 --> 01:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
the conclusion whether we want to uh
 
01:56:56.470 --> 01:56:56.480 align:start position:0%
make a remonstrance to the commissioner
 
01:56:58.109 --> 01:56:58.119 align:start position:0%
and that's off the table now because it
 
01:57:00.709 --> 01:57:00.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter even if we did yes
 
01:57:02.669 --> 01:57:02.679 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant yes I think it's
 
01:57:04.310 --> 01:57:04.320 align:start position:0%
definitely off the table but if it's
 
01:57:06.430 --> 01:57:06.440 align:start position:0%
okay with the chair I still like to have
 
01:57:08.310 --> 01:57:08.320 align:start position:0%
the chair reach out to house counsel to
 
01:57:09.709 --> 01:57:09.719 align:start position:0%
understand what our role and what our
 
01:57:12.109 --> 01:57:12.119 align:start position:0%
what our gu rails are because I think if
 
01:57:14.069 --> 01:57:14.079 align:start position:0%
this comes to us be again or anything
 
01:57:16.510 --> 01:57:16.520 align:start position:0%
like it we should be able to respond to
 
01:57:18.510 --> 01:57:18.520 align:start position:0%
it accordingly saying this is not within
 
01:57:22.390 --> 01:57:22.400 align:start position:0%
our scope um of authorities just get
 
01:57:23.830 --> 01:57:23.840 align:start position:0%
that cleared get it cleared up and get
 
01:57:25.510 --> 01:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
it done with because other things like
 
01:57:27.790 --> 01:57:27.800 align:start position:0%
