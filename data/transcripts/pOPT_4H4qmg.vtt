00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 align:start position:0%
six 08 we're still waiting for the um
 
00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
amended language uh one of the things
 
00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 align:start position:0%
we're changing on that was the effect of
 
00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
date which was recommended through some
 
00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:12.199 align:start position:0%
of the testimony we heard which is uh
 
00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:14.759 align:start position:0%
appropo and we need to do that so as
 
00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
soon as that comes we'll be able to jump
 
00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 align:start position:0%
on that one also we are still waiting uh
 
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
for a Amendment for the
 
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.600 align:start position:0%
hb20 uh the amendment came through
 
00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 align:start position:0%
yesterday but it had left off uh some of
 
00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:30.199 align:start position:0%
the information that was supposed to be
 
00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:33.039 align:start position:0%
included in that so that too we're going
 
00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:34.479 align:start position:0%
to have to wait for that amendment to
 
00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:36.600 align:start position:0%
come through we have received amendments
 
00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
however for HB
 
00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:41.759 align:start position:0%
594 uh FN that that's a bill which deals
 
00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
with school building Aid we have
 
00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
discussed this before um uh with uh in
 
00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:50.039 align:start position:0%
conjunction with 214 which we did retain
 
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 align:start position:0%
that's a school building Aid Bill also
 
00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:55.720 align:start position:0%
um this this bill right here is one
 
00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
which uh is an early Bill
 
00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:00.759 align:start position:0%
594 and so we will be discussing that
 
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
one at this particular
 
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
moment we have uh several amendments
 
00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
here and I want to make sure that uh
 
00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 align:start position:0%
there's nothing else in the in in the
 
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
hopper here as far as amending language
 
00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:17.759 align:start position:0%
I have one that's uh from represent luno
 
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
0243 um it's uh has an amendment which
 
00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:26.800 align:start position:0%
deals with changing the the language uh
 
00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:28.840 align:start position:0%
in the first portion of the bill which
 
00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:30.520 align:start position:0%
deals with the $50
 
00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
million there is a second uh Amendment
 
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:36.360 align:start position:0%
which is put forth by myself which does
 
00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:38.680 align:start position:0%
the same thing for that section which
 
00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:41.960 align:start position:0%
addresses the $50 million pretty much
 
00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
accomplishes the same type of L uh end
 
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
um just the wording is a little bit
 
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
different uh and but it have the the one
 
00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
I also have has a second par portion to
 
00:06:57.589 --> 00:06:57.599 align:start position:0%

Amendment uh to HB 594 number
 
00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.389 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh to HB 594 number
0400

00:08:55.389 --> 00:08:55.399 align:start position:0%
0400
 
00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
H is there a
 
00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:01.640 align:start position:0%
second order yeah the motion's wrong we
 
00:09:03.509 --> 00:09:03.519 align:start position:0%
have a motion on so there's no point of
 
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:05.560 align:start position:0%
order no there is a point of order it
 
00:09:08.269 --> 00:09:08.279 align:start position:0%
supersedes all
 
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:10.600 align:start position:0%
motions go ahead what is your point of
 
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
order represent I I believe the motion
 
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
would have should have been ought to
 
00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:20.200 align:start position:0%
pass on the bill and then an amendment
 
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
um come on I think I I think that
 
00:09:25.389 --> 00:09:25.399 align:start position:0%
absolutely what uh represent cordelli
 
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:28.240 align:start position:0%
was trying to say we're recommending he
 
00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
would you please phrase your motion
 
00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:33.240 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli yes I would like to
 
00:09:37.069 --> 00:09:37.079 align:start position:0%
move ought to pass on House Bill
 
00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
594 and offer Amendment 400h it's two
 
00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
separate it's two separate motions you
 
00:09:47.829 --> 00:09:47.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
amendment we first consider the
 
00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:51.240 align:start position:0%
amendment because there're two separate
 
00:09:52.949 --> 00:09:52.959 align:start position:0%
votes so we have to vote on the
 
00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:54.440 align:start position:0%
amendment first before there can be a
 
00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
motion to that's correct but I believe
 
00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
the wording um did I
 
00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
offered uh came from the clerk but we
 
00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
will be considering the amendment first
 
00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you need a second on that
 
00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:11.519 align:start position:0%
Amendment represent leus is recognized
 
00:10:15.829 --> 00:10:15.839 align:start position:0%
and she seconds the the amendment so now
 
00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:19.720 align:start position:0%
we're uh open to discussion here uh and
 
00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask the maker of the motion
 
00:10:28.509 --> 00:10:28.519 align:start position:0%
if he has any uh thing to say or or the
 
00:10:31.069 --> 00:10:31.079 align:start position:0%
the person a second that represent leus
 
00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:35.160 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli uh thank you um I I
 
00:10:38.269 --> 00:10:38.279 align:start position:0%
think that uh one important part of this
 
00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:42.680 align:start position:0%
amendment uh is the uh 10-year plan uh I
 
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
believe that uh this um addition to the
 
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
bill um was worked out uh with the uh
 
00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:52.760 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
Education uh the uh facilities director
 
00:10:59.829 --> 00:10:59.839 align:start position:0%
uh Miss Clark um and I think this would
 
00:11:03.949 --> 00:11:03.959 align:start position:0%
help uh the department in planning for
 
00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:10.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
uh okay thank you uh represent leus do
 
00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:15.720 align:start position:0%
you have anything to
 
00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
add just basically we do this with our
 
00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
roads and it makes sense to do it with
 
00:11:23.829 --> 00:11:23.839 align:start position:0%
our school buildings for for thank you
 
00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
very much uh for those that are out on
 
00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:28.200 align:start position:0%
on remote and and I haven't had an
 
00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity to read the second portion
 
00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:33.160 align:start position:0%
of it because the top portion is simply
 
00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
addressing that we will Fund in terms of
 
00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:38.680 align:start position:0%
school building Aid no less than $50
 
00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
million right now you all know it it's
 
00:11:44.069 --> 00:11:44.079 align:start position:0%
uh shall not exceed $50 million so we've
 
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
been funding the tail and as I've spoken
 
00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:48.680 align:start position:0%
many times the tale for the first year
 
00:11:51.509 --> 00:11:51.519 align:start position:0%
of this by by any we're looking at is
 
00:11:53.509 --> 00:11:53.519 align:start position:0%
right around $32 million which leaves
 
00:11:56.829 --> 00:11:56.839 align:start position:0%
$18 million for new and renovation
 
00:11:59.590 --> 00:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
projects including emergencies uh
 
00:12:01.829 --> 00:12:01.839 align:start position:0%
however we have not always at from a
 
00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:04.760 align:start position:0%
policy perspective funded that total $50
 
00:12:07.069 --> 00:12:07.079 align:start position:0%
million the previous year we funded
 
00:12:07.079 --> 00:12:07.949 align:start position:0%
million the previous year we funded
three

00:12:07.949 --> 00:12:07.959 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
projects uh and and then the year prior
 
00:12:13.069 --> 00:12:13.079 align:start position:0%
to that we had one emergency project
 
00:12:13.079 --> 00:12:13.790 align:start position:0%
to that we had one emergency project
with

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
Hinsdale uh so it's uh and we've heard
 
00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:20.600 align:start position:0%
so many times that we have all these
 
00:12:22.389 --> 00:12:22.399 align:start position:0%
projects throughout the state with the
 
00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
buildings being 60% of our buildings now
 
00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:28.240 align:start position:0%
over or excuse me 50% of the buildings
 
00:12:30.829 --> 00:12:30.839 align:start position:0%
right now that are over are over 60
 
00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:33.680 align:start position:0%
years old so we we have some real
 
00:12:35.629 --> 00:12:35.639 align:start position:0%
serious problems out there and we
 
00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
discussed them in the hearing with it
 
00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
with achievement that's related to
 
00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:42.720 align:start position:0%
conditions within buildings HVAC
 
00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:45.800 align:start position:0%
Acoustics lighting Etc the second part
 
00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
of that bill deals with the 10-year plan
 
00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:51.040 align:start position:0%

00:15:02.629 --> 00:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
takes a long time for school districts
 
00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:04.720 align:start position:0%
to talk about building projects put them
 
00:15:06.949 --> 00:15:06.959 align:start position:0%
together get the community on board vote
 
00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
for um do a bond vote and uh and so I
 
00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:12.040 align:start position:0%
think that would also be a good change
 
00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
but the reason I'm going to vote against
 
00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
the amendment is for what it loses um
 
00:15:20.389 --> 00:15:20.399 align:start position:0%
first of all it um it retains the the
 
00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:23.720 align:start position:0%
current um um pay the grant well it's
 
00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:26.360 align:start position:0%
80% up front and 20% I think at the
 
00:15:27.629 --> 00:15:27.639 align:start position:0%
completion of the project so you
 
00:15:29.389 --> 00:15:29.399 align:start position:0%
basically get your Grant
 
00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
uh when you uh when you do uh the
 
00:15:35.309 --> 00:15:35.319 align:start position:0%
project and U we've already heard from
 
00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:37.720 align:start position:0%
from director Clark that in the in the
 
00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
first year of this bium um uh there will
 
00:15:44.189 --> 00:15:44.199 align:start position:0%
or the first year of of fy22 there will
 
00:15:47.309 --> 00:15:47.319 align:start position:0%
only be $15 million available so so
 
00:15:50.949 --> 00:15:50.959 align:start position:0%
we've got a project backlog uh of with a
 
00:15:55.189 --> 00:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
grant value currently of $104 million so
 
00:15:58.590 --> 00:15:58.600 align:start position:0%
under the current um plan design uh only
 
00:16:01.749 --> 00:16:01.759 align:start position:0%
only about um 15% of those projects or
 
00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:04.360 align:start position:0%
15% of that project value is going to be
 
00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:08.680 align:start position:0%
able to uh to be be awarded and um and
 
00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
we know that that you know $14 million
 
00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
of of um Grant value and that comes to
 
00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
$270 Million worth of building projects
 
00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
that's what we've got in the pipeline
 
00:16:21.829 --> 00:16:21.839 align:start position:0%
now we haven't even opened the door yet
 
00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
for the for the grant applications for
 
00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
FY 23 and I think when the program comes
 
00:16:28.949 --> 00:16:28.959 align:start position:0%
off moratorium there's probably going to
 
00:16:31.829 --> 00:16:31.839 align:start position:0%
be substantially more um projects that
 
00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:34.160 align:start position:0%
are that are applied for in the second
 
00:16:36.949 --> 00:16:36.959 align:start position:0%
year of the bium there's going to be $18
 
00:16:39.629 --> 00:16:39.639 align:start position:0%
million available for new projects so
 
00:16:42.189 --> 00:16:42.199 align:start position:0%
again if um if we're if we're not
 
00:16:45.389 --> 00:16:45.399 align:start position:0%
changing the plan design as is um as is
 
00:16:47.949 --> 00:16:47.959 align:start position:0%
done in House Bill 594 the underlying
 
00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:50.360 align:start position:0%
House Bill 594 then we're going to be
 
00:16:52.069 --> 00:16:52.079 align:start position:0%
severely limited to the number of
 
00:16:54.069 --> 00:16:54.079 align:start position:0%
projects the state's going to be able to
 
00:16:57.629 --> 00:16:57.639 align:start position:0%
support what 594 does is change it from
 
00:16:57.639 --> 00:16:59.430 align:start position:0%
support what 594 does is change it from
100%

00:16:59.430 --> 00:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
100%
 
00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:02.120 align:start position:0%
payment you know in the when the
 
00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
Project's done to 20% and then and then
 
00:17:07.949 --> 00:17:07.959 align:start position:0%
the balance gets paid in 20 equal
 
00:17:10.949 --> 00:17:10.959 align:start position:0%
payments over 20 years so if we're
 
00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:13.640 align:start position:0%
looking at a a current um projects in
 
00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:17.079 align:start position:0%
the pipeline with $104 Million worth of
 
00:17:20.549 --> 00:17:20.559 align:start position:0%
Grant value times 20% is about $20
 
00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
million and we've got $15 million to um
 
00:17:25.549 --> 00:17:25.559 align:start position:0%
to work with so we're going to be able
 
00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:28.760 align:start position:0%
to get three4 of those projects approved
 
00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
with the changes that are that are that
 
00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:33.480 align:start position:0%
are made in the underlying Bill and are
 
00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:35.640 align:start position:0%
removed with with the amendment that's
 
00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
being proferred by representative blad
 
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
so that's the first thing that we lose
 
00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
with the amendment um uh changing the
 
00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
plan design to a 20% 20-year plan that
 
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
can go after the backlog and do it in a
 
00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
responsible way the second thing we lose
 
00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
is is a more is expanding the grant
 
00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
range not the total grants that are
 
00:17:59.350 --> 00:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
delivered but the grant range range from
 
00:18:02.669 --> 00:18:02.679 align:start position:0%
currently 30 to 60% so if you're a well
 
00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
healed Community lots of property values
 
00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
you'll get a grant from the state of 30%
 
00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:10.760 align:start position:0%
if you're if you're a very property poor
 
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
District under the current plan design
 
00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
you can get a grant of of up to
 
00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
60% um the underlying Bill 594 expands
 
00:18:23.549 --> 00:18:23.559 align:start position:0%
that range from 30 to 60% to 20 to 80%
 
00:18:25.669 --> 00:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
so that is much more commensurate with
 
00:18:27.669 --> 00:18:27.679 align:start position:0%
the uh with the fiscal disparities that
 
00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
we see across Ross the state in terms of
 
00:18:32.029 --> 00:18:32.039 align:start position:0%
the ability for for local property
 
00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
taxpayers to fund projects using using
 
00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:39.400 align:start position:0%
local tax dollars um and in fact during
 
00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:42.520 align:start position:0%
the uh during the hearing on that we had
 
00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
on um representative Lads Bill House
 
00:18:47.789 --> 00:18:47.799 align:start position:0%
Bill 214 and House Bill 594 I think
 
00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
there was a substantial um uh commentary
 
00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:54.280 align:start position:0%
provided by um by representative Hill
 
00:18:56.149 --> 00:18:56.159 align:start position:0%
who's been involved in building projects
 
00:18:57.990 --> 00:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
the only thing he liked about either of
 
00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
these two bills was the uh was the
 
00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:02.440 align:start position:0%
expansion of the uh of the grant range
 
00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
to 20 to 80% so that's another thing
 
00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
that we lose by by adopting the
 
00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:10.520 align:start position:0%
amendment director Clark also said also
 
00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
gave us information in the handouts that
 
00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:15.320 align:start position:0%
showed even with the expanded range the
 
00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:18.760 align:start position:0%
average Grant would still be the same um
 
00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:21.480 align:start position:0%
so so we don't lose anything uh from
 
00:19:23.149 --> 00:19:23.159 align:start position:0%
that we're just providing grants in a
 
00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
more Equitable uh distribution across
 
00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:28.760 align:start position:0%
the state and then the Third third thing
 
00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:31.480 align:start position:0%
we lose by adopting this amendment is
 
00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
the ability and this is in the
 
00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:35.000 align:start position:0%
underlying bill for projects that were
 
00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
started or completed during the
 
00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:39.400 align:start position:0%
moratorium um period so projects that
 
00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:41.960 align:start position:0%
were not able to be applied to to apply
 
00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
for um for State Building Aid grants
 
00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:46.720 align:start position:0%
would be uh would be considered and
 
00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
there'd be a short time frame as
 
00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:51.400 align:start position:0%
outlined in the underlying bill for for
 
00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
these school districts to apply to the
 
00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:55.960 align:start position:0%
department for building aid for projects
 
00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
that were completed during the
 
00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:01.000 align:start position:0%
moratorium um um just in Windham alone
 
00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:03.400 align:start position:0%
just in Windham alone there was about a
 
00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
$40 million project that would be
 
00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
eligible for an $8 million retroactive
 
00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
Grant under um under the underlying bill
 
00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
of 594 so that's something that gets
 
00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:19.240 align:start position:0%
lost when you um um when you adopt this
 
00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:21.400 align:start position:0%
this amendment all
 
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
told the um projects that were completed
 
00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
during the
 
00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
moratorium um come up to
 
00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
uh looks like about uh $500 million
 
00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
worth of worth of projects the uh the
 
00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
underlying Bill 594 does limit that
 
00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
Grant to only 20% so you don't get the
 
00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:44.600 align:start position:0%
full range on that but but it's it's
 
00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:47.000 align:start position:0%
certainly something to to help out these
 
00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
communities that just couldn't wait for
 
00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
the state to uh to to get off its butt
 
00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
and get the um and get the building aid
 
00:20:57.470 --> 00:20:57.480 align:start position:0%
program put uh put back in business so
 
00:21:00.549 --> 00:21:00.559 align:start position:0%
um so uh uh by adopting the amendment
 
00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
yep two good things happen you increase
 
00:21:04.549 --> 00:21:04.559 align:start position:0%
the total funding for the for the
 
00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:07.640 align:start position:0%
program you improve the um the the
 
00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
rulemaking authority of the department
 
00:21:12.269 --> 00:21:12.279 align:start position:0%
that can help districts plan I agree
 
00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:15.480 align:start position:0%
with both those two things but you lose
 
00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
the improved plan design that can go
 
00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
after more projects you improve the more
 
00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
Equitable range of uh of funding
 
00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
projects and you you lose the um the uh
 
00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:28.120 align:start position:0%
uh the ability for projects that were
 
00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
done during the moratorium to to
 
00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:32.240 align:start position:0%
participate in this
 
00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
program thank thank you very much uh
 
00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:36.320 align:start position:0%
represent luno are there
 
00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:42.549 --> 00:21:42.559 align:start position:0%
discussion uh I'd like to just make one
 
00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:45.640 align:start position:0%
comment in in in regard to uh what Ron
 
00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
luno has said yes there is a backlog of
 
00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:51.880 align:start position:0%
projects no we're no longer in a
 
00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:54.200 align:start position:0%
moratorium that has been done we did
 
00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
fund the three projects last year that
 
00:21:58.549 --> 00:21:58.559 align:start position:0%
were in the in in the
 
00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
a hopper um the significant changes
 
00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
within uh the 594 as initially sent
 
00:22:10.149 --> 00:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
changes the application process and the
 
00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:13.000 align:start position:0%
checks and balances within the uh School
 
00:22:15.789 --> 00:22:15.799 align:start position:0%
building Aid approval process in fact it
 
00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
totally eliminates the use of the school
 
00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
building authority which is a balance to
 
00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:22.440 align:start position:0%
the recommendations that come out from
 
00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
the department and from the school
 
00:22:25.789 --> 00:22:25.799 align:start position:0%
building authority the recommendations
 
00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:27.480 align:start position:0%
go on to the school State Board of
 
00:22:29.909 --> 00:22:29.919 align:start position:0%
Education for approval uh there's
 
00:22:31.909 --> 00:22:31.919 align:start position:0%
confusion within the bill as it was
 
00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:34.600 align:start position:0%
written as to is the state board going
 
00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:36.520 align:start position:0%
to be approving these projects or is the
 
00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:37.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Education going to be
 
00:22:39.789 --> 00:22:39.799 align:start position:0%
approving these projects so that that's
 
00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:42.760 align:start position:0%
the whole process has been jumped
 
00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
without having any hearing on that
 
00:22:47.269 --> 00:22:47.279 align:start position:0%
process at all and that was the point of
 
00:22:47.279 --> 00:22:48.470 align:start position:0%
process at all and that was the point of
retaining

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
retaining
 
00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:52.440 align:start position:0%
hb214 as to really dive into this whole
 
00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
process in terms of what are the
 
00:22:56.029 --> 00:22:56.039 align:start position:0%
strengths what are the weaknesses how
 
00:22:58.510 --> 00:22:58.520 align:start position:0%
can we improve and how can we
 
00:23:00.269 --> 00:23:00.279 align:start position:0%
gather that information and work with
 
00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:03.640 align:start position:0%
doe to accomplish that desired end
 
00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:07.000 align:start position:0%
secondly by reducing the amount of money
 
00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
which is paid to a district upfront and
 
00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
that's the
 
00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
80% and the remaining portion of that
 
00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
money from the state uh the other 20%
 
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
being paid upon completion of the
 
00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
project I feel that that process will um
 
00:23:25.149 --> 00:23:25.159 align:start position:0%
uh make it more difficult for the
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
districts which don't have the
 
00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:29.870 align:start position:0%
districts which don't have the
wherewithal

00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
wherewithal
 
00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
the where with all to uh uh fund these
 
00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:35.640 align:start position:0%
and it will also hamper I believe uh
 
00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
approval these projects by the town
 
00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:39.480 align:start position:0%
meeting process which is required to
 
00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:43.720 align:start position:0%
have a two-thirds or at least a 60% vote
 
00:23:46.909 --> 00:23:46.919 align:start position:0%
so that that is part of my concern the
 
00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:49.000 align:start position:0%
other part is I'm I'm really worried
 
00:23:51.909 --> 00:23:51.919 align:start position:0%
about what happens when we start uh
 
00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:55.400 align:start position:0%
paying back the state's uh portion uh of
 
00:23:58.110 --> 00:23:58.120 align:start position:0%
the debt of the principal uh over over
 
00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
20 year period we're going to start
 
00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:02.240 align:start position:0%
sliding back to where we were
 
00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:04.200 align:start position:0%
approximately 10 years ago when the
 
00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:07.240 align:start position:0%
state had a scheme not like this but we
 
00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
had a scheme where we borrowing from our
 
00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:10.760 align:start position:0%
Master Card to pay our Visa card and we
 
00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:13.400 align:start position:0%
had $540 million of debt which we're
 
00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
still trying to work off and that won't
 
00:24:18.909 --> 00:24:18.919 align:start position:0%
be accomplished until year
 
00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:22.600 align:start position:0%
2040 so uh this is a huge jump if we're
 
00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
going to move ahead and and and and
 
00:24:29.389 --> 00:24:29.399 align:start position:0%
adopt any of the other components of 594
 
00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
as they were presented uh there are
 
00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:34.600 align:start position:0%
significant issues with it uh I
 
00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:36.200 align:start position:0%
understand the intent of the bill is to
 
00:24:39.669 --> 00:24:39.679 align:start position:0%
try to support those poor districts um
 
00:24:42.389 --> 00:24:42.399 align:start position:0%
by changing the whole scale from from a
 
00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:46.360 align:start position:0%
30 to 60 to a 20 to an 80 uh but I I
 
00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
don't think that is is necessarily the
 
00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
correct answer and lastly with this
 
00:24:53.389 --> 00:24:53.399 align:start position:0%
committee has discussed many bills in
 
00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
the past which dealt with retroactive
 
00:24:57.389 --> 00:24:57.399 align:start position:0%
payment uh projects which were started
 
00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
during the of course the moratorium it's
 
00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
been decided by the house on the floor
 
00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:03.880 align:start position:0%
that no we're not going that direction
 
00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
we're not going to back off those people
 
00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:07.720 align:start position:0%
that went ahead in towns that went ahead
 
00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
and uh in approv bonding that is on
 
00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
their their s right now on there to pay
 
00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:16.600 align:start position:0%
them to pay that off um the state's not
 
00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
going to get back into that because
 
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
those projects were not approved through
 
00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:24.760 align:start position:0%
this application process and and did not
 
00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:28.440 align:start position:0%
pass through the the eyes in in the the
 
00:25:30.669 --> 00:25:30.679 align:start position:0%
discussions of our director over there
 
00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:33.480 align:start position:0%
Amy Clark so in conclusion I cannot
 
00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:38.240 align:start position:0%
support U the full uh language in 594
 
00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:40.840 align:start position:0%
however I do feel that the need for a
 
00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
10year plan is absolutely needed and
 
00:25:46.149 --> 00:25:46.159 align:start position:0%
it'd be a milestone if we can just get
 
00:25:49.909 --> 00:25:49.919 align:start position:0%
the the state uh to approve up to $50
 
00:25:53.549 --> 00:25:53.559 align:start position:0%
million uh in projects
 
00:25:57.070 --> 00:25:57.080 align:start position:0%
lastly we have re received an Esser
 
00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:01.000 align:start position:0%
Monies and in other monies uh funds
 
00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:02.720 align:start position:0%
enough to take care of some of these
 
00:26:06.029 --> 00:26:06.039 align:start position:0%
HVAC concerns within buildings the first
 
00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:08.200 align:start position:0%
Esser Grant came down with 30 plus
 
00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
million do the second one is well over
 
00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:15.240 align:start position:0%
uh what $200 plus and then we I just
 
00:26:16.669 --> 00:26:16.679 align:start position:0%
learned from the Department there's
 
00:26:19.029 --> 00:26:19.039 align:start position:0%
another $300 million coming down from
 
00:26:21.389 --> 00:26:21.399 align:start position:0%
the federal government these projects
 
00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
are this money is available for
 
00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
supplementing school and even supp
 
00:26:28.909 --> 00:26:28.919 align:start position:0%
planning areas which are dealing with
 
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
issues specifically dealing with
 
00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:34.480 align:start position:0%
facilities as is stated in the in the
 
00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:38.360 align:start position:0%
grants so for those reasons I cannot uh
 
00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:41.640 align:start position:0%
support the full 594 but I can uh
 
00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
support as amended here in 0400 thank
 
00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:49.360 align:start position:0%
you if um the people who are remote uh
 
00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
could mute when they're not speaking
 
00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:54.520 align:start position:0%
they're getting a little feedback I
 
00:26:56.789 --> 00:26:56.799 align:start position:0%
understand so is there any further
 
00:26:59.310 --> 00:26:59.320 align:start position:0%

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
yes uh with this bill being a a 20 but
 
00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:27.750 align:start position:0%
yes uh with this bill being a a 20 but
it

00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:30:29.549 --> 00:30:29.559 align:start position:0%
uh does have
 
00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
a well I would question whether there's
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
a financial note 214 said exactly what
 
00:30:38.389 --> 00:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
this does on the part one and that's
 
00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
what the law allows us to do right now
 
00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:42.200 align:start position:0%
it's $50 million and the second part
 
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't so I don't know if there is a
 
00:30:47.389 --> 00:30:47.399 align:start position:0%
financial note on this anymore um with
 
00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:49.240 align:start position:0%
the the portions of the bill which were
 
00:30:52.389 --> 00:30:52.399 align:start position:0%
in 594 not being attached with this uh
 
00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:54.200 align:start position:0%
is there any objection to putting this
 
00:30:58.629 --> 00:30:58.639 align:start position:0%
on consent no thank thank you very much
 
00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
um no okay thank you very much
 
00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
representative Miler um one comment I'd
 
00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
like to make regarding this building Aid
 
00:31:08.430 --> 00:31:08.440 align:start position:0%
I think we all recognize based upon this
 
00:31:10.669 --> 00:31:10.679 align:start position:0%
vote that building Aid is a serious
 
00:31:13.269 --> 00:31:13.279 align:start position:0%
issue in this state and we do have
 
00:31:15.149 --> 00:31:15.159 align:start position:0%
several other bills which will be coming
 
00:31:18.669 --> 00:31:18.679 align:start position:0%
up really dealing with this a topic or a
 
00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
criteria within it HVAC acoustical sound
 
00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
stuff those bills will be heard and
 
00:31:28.909 --> 00:31:28.919 align:start position:0%
those they're all linked to to the issue
 
00:31:30.789 --> 00:31:30.799 align:start position:0%
of of how we're taking care of our
 
00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:32.440 align:start position:0%
facilities and how we're maintaining
 
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
them replacing them and building them uh
 
00:31:38.389 --> 00:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
so that uh I think this discussion will
 
00:31:41.629 --> 00:31:41.639 align:start position:0%
continue and as I've said before we will
 
00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
initiate a subcommittee here as soon as
 
00:31:46.909 --> 00:31:46.919 align:start position:0%
we get by this early Bill per period to
 
00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:49.320 align:start position:0%
really start trying to take a dive into
 
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
this working with the department and and
 
00:31:54.389 --> 00:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
working with folks in the field to try
 
00:31:57.269 --> 00:31:57.279 align:start position:0%
to make some recommendations that can
 
00:31:59.230 --> 00:31:59.240 align:start position:0%
move forward I thank you again for your
 
00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:02.430 align:start position:0%
move forward I thank you again for your
vote

00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:02.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:05.669 --> 00:32:05.679 align:start position:0%
today okay uh we have two other bills
 
00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
and uh I've just got to find out whether
 
00:32:11.149 --> 00:32:11.159 align:start position:0%
we've got the amending language back uh
 
00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
has anybody seen the amending language
 
00:32:17.909 --> 00:32:17.919 align:start position:0%
for hb20 or 608 yet um we have not had
 
00:32:20.029 --> 00:32:20.039 align:start position:0%
this and I I need to get off this and
 
00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
and give a call to OS and find out what
 
00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:25.320 align:start position:0%
the status is so we will be taking
 
00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:28.200 align:start position:0%
another break here on as we did the
 
00:32:29.909 --> 00:32:29.919 align:start position:0%
other day I'm I'm sorry to have to do
 
00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
that but uh it's things are just coming
 
00:32:34.629 --> 00:32:34.639 align:start position:0%
out of there there were 40 bills stacked
 
00:32:37.149 --> 00:32:37.159 align:start position:0%
up in OLS this morning for amending for
 
00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:39.080 align:start position:0%
the various committees it's just not
 
00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
moving quickly at all folks so Mr chair
 
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
yes represento yeah just a question on
 
00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:47.880 align:start position:0%
the amendment that you're you're waiting
 
00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
on for House Bill 20 is uh what's the
 
00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:52.360 align:start position:0%
difference between that Amendment the
 
00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:54.760 align:start position:0%
amendment that we received um yesterday
 
00:32:58.149 --> 00:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
afternoon the I I believe excuse me that
 
00:32:59.950 --> 00:32:59.960 align:start position:0%
that the amendment for
 
00:33:04.269 --> 00:33:04.279 align:start position:0%
hb20 had NE negated to put on the second
 
00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:07.320 align:start position:0%
uh uh author of the bill but but it also
 
00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
left off all references to hold harmless
 
00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:12.360 align:start position:0%
or the portion of the bill which would
 
00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:15.200 align:start position:0%
allow a gradual reduction of funding to
 
00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:18.120 align:start position:0%
support schools uh and that's that's an
 
00:33:20.549 --> 00:33:20.559 align:start position:0%
important part of this whole equation we
 
00:33:23.789 --> 00:33:23.799 align:start position:0%
had two primary focuses with that bill
 
00:33:27.029 --> 00:33:27.039 align:start position:0%
one was to introduce the the concept of
 
00:33:30.389 --> 00:33:30.399 align:start position:0%
eligibility being 375% of the FPL the
 
00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:32.720 align:start position:0%
federal poverty level the second was
 
00:33:37.669 --> 00:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
also to uh develop a hold harmless or a
 
00:33:39.909 --> 00:33:39.919 align:start position:0%
waterfall effect towards the reduction
 
00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:42.760 align:start position:0%
of funding to help support a ncon
 
00:33:45.549 --> 00:33:45.559 align:start position:0%
stabilization because stabilization is a
 
00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:47.720 align:start position:0%
term that brings a lot of bad memories
 
00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
back to myself and I think others that
 
00:33:52.389 --> 00:33:52.399 align:start position:0%
have been involved with school Finance
 
00:33:55.870 --> 00:33:55.880 align:start position:0%
so uh we we do need to have that that uh
 
00:33:58.509 --> 00:33:58.519 align:start position:0%
full Amendment available to us so you we
 
00:34:00.549 --> 00:34:00.559 align:start position:0%
can have a healthy discussion and read
 
00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
it and and then make the the decisions
 
00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:04.600 align:start position:0%
we have to
 
00:34:08.069 --> 00:34:08.079 align:start position:0%
make thank you you're welcome so is
 
00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
there gonna
 
00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:11.720 align:start position:0%
be go ahead yeah will there be a fiscal
 
00:34:15.310 --> 00:34:15.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
it uh is there a fiscal note attached to
 
00:34:24.589 --> 00:34:24.599 align:start position:0%

00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:28.520 align:start position:0%
that there is a not a fiscal note from
 
00:34:30.829 --> 00:34:30.839 align:start position:0%

use this as another caucus we're gonna
 
00:54:12.069 --> 00:54:12.079 align:start position:0%
listen to what Rick has to say on uh
 
00:54:15.870 --> 00:54:15.880 align:start position:0%
hb20 okay and then I'm gonna ask for him
 
00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
to set up another hearing on this thing
 
00:54:21.069 --> 00:54:21.079 align:start position:0%
because of all the changes that are here
 
00:54:22.829 --> 00:54:22.839 align:start position:0%

request about a a 30 minute caucus for
 
00:54:34.270 --> 00:54:34.280 align:start position:0%
this okay because of the because of the
 
00:54:37.390 --> 00:54:37.400 align:start position:0%
radical nature of the changes here right
 
00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:41.280 align:start position:0%

in ways and means but I'll have I'll
 
00:55:05.270 --> 00:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
have another laptop going um not sure
 
00:55:07.150 --> 00:55:07.160 align:start position:0%

00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:53.990 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:54.000 --> 00:56:53.870 align:start position:0%
 
for

00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:53.880 --> 00:57:23.789 align:start position:0%

00:57:23.799 --> 00:58:53.710 align:start position:0%
 
for

00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:53.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:53.720 --> 00:59:23.630 align:start position:0%
 
what

00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:23.640 --> 01:00:01.230 align:start position:0%
 
for

01:00:01.230 --> 01:00:01.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:04.470 --> 01:00:04.480 align:start position:0%
but that I mean look
 
01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:15.270 --> 01:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:17.829 --> 01:00:17.839 align:start position:0%
there we have the
 
01:00:23.549 --> 01:00:23.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:25.990 --> 01:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
that can the rest of the committee hear
 
01:00:29.710 --> 01:00:29.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:35.069 --> 01:00:35.079 align:start position:0%
us yes we can okay thank you um we uh
 
01:00:37.390 --> 01:00:37.400 align:start position:0%
have been in touch with uh Anthony to
 
01:00:40.150 --> 01:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
cross away in in the legislative
 
01:00:43.789 --> 01:00:43.799 align:start position:0%
Services plus the uh person writing this
 
01:00:45.990 --> 01:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
this legislation for both these
 
01:00:48.349 --> 01:00:48.359 align:start position:0%
evidently something was done and sent
 
01:00:49.630 --> 01:00:49.640 align:start position:0%
but it's
 
01:00:52.349 --> 01:00:52.359 align:start position:0%
been not we could we couldn't locate it
 
01:00:55.069 --> 01:00:55.079 align:start position:0%
but they're redoing it right now now as
 
01:00:58.589 --> 01:00:58.599 align:start position:0%
we speak so as soon as th those two
 
01:01:01.230 --> 01:01:01.240 align:start position:0%
amendments come for 608 and
 
01:01:03.789 --> 01:01:03.799 align:start position:0%
hb20 um we'll forward them to you and I
 
01:01:06.309 --> 01:01:06.319 align:start position:0%
would assume that it's my assumption
 
01:01:07.990 --> 01:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
that you would like to have probably a
 
01:01:10.789 --> 01:01:10.799 align:start position:0%
caucus or some something to get together
 
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
and discuss um both of these uh
 
01:01:16.630 --> 01:01:16.640 align:start position:0%
amendments would you prefer something
 
01:01:18.789 --> 01:01:18.799 align:start position:0%
like that repent
 
01:01:22.190 --> 01:01:22.200 align:start position:0%
Miler yeah I think what we'd like to do
 
01:01:26.430 --> 01:01:26.440 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman is to have an
 
01:01:30.670 --> 01:01:30.680 align:start position:0%
explanation have explanation of the
 
01:01:33.430 --> 01:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
amendment have you go through that
 
01:01:36.069 --> 01:01:36.079 align:start position:0%
explain the changes U and your
 
01:01:38.710 --> 01:01:38.720 align:start position:0%
recommendations on that and then at that
 
01:01:43.470 --> 01:01:43.480 align:start position:0%
point in time uh the uh Dem caucus will
 
01:01:47.670 --> 01:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
take place so that we can uh review your
 
01:01:49.829 --> 01:01:49.839 align:start position:0%
comments and uh our response to those
 
01:01:52.349 --> 01:01:52.359 align:start position:0%
comments if that's appropriate both the
 
01:01:54.829 --> 01:01:54.839 align:start position:0%
MERS were just s out okay uh yeah both
 
01:01:56.829 --> 01:01:56.839 align:start position:0%
of the amendments were just set out I I
 
01:01:59.430 --> 01:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
don't have them in front of me right now
 
01:02:03.549 --> 01:02:03.559 align:start position:0%
but uh we could uh open up uh
 
01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:07.400 align:start position:0%
hb20 and and look at uh that Amendment
 
01:02:09.630 --> 01:02:09.640 align:start position:0%
explain that and then provide you an
 
01:02:14.029 --> 01:02:14.039 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have a caucus it is um so
 
01:02:16.870 --> 01:02:16.880 align:start position:0%
um we have folks here that are familiar
 
01:02:18.870 --> 01:02:18.880 align:start position:0%
with that Amendment but uh unfortunately
 
01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
we don't have it line by line on the new
 
01:02:22.950 --> 01:02:22.960 align:start position:0%
one so
 
01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
um what we we need to do is uh can you
 
01:02:28.510 --> 01:02:28.520 align:start position:0%
pull that up in your computer re
 
01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:34.430 align:start position:0%
pull that up in your computer re
cordelli

01:02:34.430 --> 01:02:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:37.109 --> 01:02:37.119 align:start position:0%
yeah just to P yeah that's what we're
 
01:02:37.119 --> 01:02:38.269 align:start position:0%
yeah just to P yeah that's what we're
GNA

01:02:38.269 --> 01:02:38.279 align:start position:0%
GNA
 
01:02:41.269 --> 01:02:41.279 align:start position:0%
do what we like to do is you know he
 
01:02:43.750 --> 01:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
will have an on his
 
01:02:46.390 --> 01:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
screen and he can go through the
 
01:02:49.589 --> 01:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
amendment the amendment for HB well I I
 
01:02:51.069 --> 01:02:51.079 align:start position:0%
I I'm not going to guess I've not seen
 
01:02:52.870 --> 01:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
it yet so I'm not going to project what
 
01:02:55.470 --> 01:02:55.480 align:start position:0%
was put in it or not in terms of who's
 
01:02:57.589 --> 01:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
sponsoring it it's supposed to be myself
 
01:03:00.309 --> 01:03:00.319 align:start position:0%
and representative Allard on the
 
01:03:02.470 --> 01:03:02.480 align:start position:0%
amendment which which amendment are we
 
01:03:14.990 --> 01:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:23.269 --> 01:03:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:35.910 --> 01:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
email 0398 is in your legislative email
 
01:03:40.589 --> 01:03:40.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:44.870 --> 01:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
Mullen I can't 0398 the Network's
 
01:03:48.390 --> 01:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:52.870 --> 01:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
yes seems I have a problem with page
 
01:03:55.109 --> 01:03:55.119 align:start position:0%
three do do you have that in front of
 
01:03:57.950 --> 01:03:57.960 align:start position:0%
you right now represent it does every
 
01:03:57.960 --> 01:03:59.510 align:start position:0%
you right now represent it does every
can

01:03:59.510 --> 01:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:04:02.029 --> 01:04:02.039 align:start position:0%
I I know it's quite a leap for some to
 
01:04:04.549 --> 01:04:04.559 align:start position:0%
get that you know that on one computer
 
01:04:06.789 --> 01:04:06.799 align:start position:0%
and then be also doing this as well but
 
01:04:09.069 --> 01:04:09.079 align:start position:0%
you could put Pull It in front and then
 
01:04:11.870 --> 01:04:11.880 align:start position:0%
you could be still talking uh with your
 
01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:16.029 align:start position:0%
you could be still talking uh with your
Zoom

01:04:16.029 --> 01:04:16.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:16.039 --> 01:04:18.109 align:start position:0%
 
um9

01:04:18.109 --> 01:04:18.119 align:start position:0%
um9
 
01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:26.109 --> 01:04:26.119 align:start position:0%
it we can start walking through that if
 
01:04:29.190 --> 01:04:29.200 align:start position:0%
it's uh if you're ready for that out
 
01:04:32.029 --> 01:04:32.039 align:start position:0%
there in the remote country then we got
 
01:04:32.039 --> 01:04:33.950 align:start position:0%
there in the remote country then we got
six

01:04:33.950 --> 01:04:33.960 align:start position:0%
six
 
01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:36.960 align:start position:0%

too polite and then uh if there's any
 
01:05:15.069 --> 01:05:15.079 align:start position:0%
questions regarding that and then we

will you know allow caucus to
 
01:05:21.349 --> 01:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
occur so um represent cordelli could you
 
01:05:24.309 --> 01:05:24.319 align:start position:0%
take us through that Amendment please
 
01:05:28.789 --> 01:05:28.799 align:start position:0%
thank you uh yes um this is in response
 
01:05:32.829 --> 01:05:32.839 align:start position:0%
to what we heard um at the hearings um
 
01:05:34.510 --> 01:05:34.520 align:start position:0%
our two days of
 
01:05:39.029 --> 01:05:39.039 align:start position:0%
hearings so I I'll start on uh page one
 
01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
um with the uh eligible student uh Roman
 
01:05:48.990 --> 01:05:49.000 align:start position:0%
6 and um this uh section was a
 
01:05:53.269 --> 01:05:53.279 align:start position:0%
simplified um and in a uh it's
 
01:05:55.269 --> 01:05:55.279 align:start position:0%
simplified to to say that a resident of
 
01:05:57.349 --> 01:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
the state who's eligible to enroll in a
 
01:06:01.510 --> 01:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
public school qualifies but we added
 
01:06:04.589 --> 01:06:04.599 align:start position:0%
that the household income must be less
 
01:06:07.230 --> 01:06:07.240 align:start position:0%
than or equal to
 
01:06:10.910 --> 01:06:10.920 align:start position:0%
375% of the federal poverty uh
 
01:06:13.630 --> 01:06:13.640 align:start position:0%
guidelines and that currently for a
 
01:06:17.950 --> 01:06:17.960 align:start position:0%
family of four is approximately
 
01:06:20.829 --> 01:06:20.839 align:start position:0%
$99,000 and that would mean that
 
01:06:24.390 --> 01:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
approximately half the families in the
 
01:06:27.269 --> 01:06:27.279 align:start position:0%
state would
 
01:06:30.870 --> 01:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
qualify um going down to Romans
 
01:06:37.309 --> 01:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
7 um we added in that this satisfies
 
01:06:39.549 --> 01:06:39.559 align:start position:0%
compulsory attendance
 
01:06:44.630 --> 01:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
requirements uh this has to do with uh
 
01:06:47.470 --> 01:06:47.480 align:start position:0%
categories of students that qual that
 
01:06:51.269 --> 01:06:51.279 align:start position:0%
meet uh compulsory attendance currently
 
01:06:54.549 --> 01:06:54.559 align:start position:0%
they are three uh in number they are
 
01:06:56.470 --> 01:06:56.480 align:start position:0%
public school students private school
 
01:07:00.390 --> 01:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
students and homeschool students and so
 
01:07:04.349 --> 01:07:04.359 align:start position:0%
in this and two other places we clarify
 
01:07:08.029 --> 01:07:08.039 align:start position:0%
that uh there is a now a fourth category
 
01:07:11.390 --> 01:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
students um proceeding on to the next
 
01:07:16.990 --> 01:07:17.000 align:start position:0%
page page
 
01:07:22.349 --> 01:07:22.359 align:start position:0%
two um coming down to
 
01:07:25.349 --> 01:07:25.359 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
01:07:31.230 --> 01:07:31.240 align:start position:0%
Roman 2 uh B we clarified
 
01:07:37.269 --> 01:07:37.279 align:start position:0%
that EFA funds tuition uh expenses can
 
01:07:40.750 --> 01:07:40.760 align:start position:0%
be used to go to a public school outside
 
01:07:44.190 --> 01:07:44.200 align:start position:0%
of their resident District uh this is a
 
01:07:47.589 --> 01:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
clarification um and we also added that
 
01:07:51.750 --> 01:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
the EFA funds are to be used for that uh
 
01:07:53.910 --> 01:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
tuition at a out of District public
 
01:07:56.190 --> 01:07:56.200 align:start position:0%
public school and that the department
 
01:07:59.109 --> 01:07:59.119 align:start position:0%
should make no adequacy payment to that
 
01:08:02.029 --> 01:08:02.039 align:start position:0%
school for the student so to is avoid
 
01:08:05.269 --> 01:08:05.279 align:start position:0%
any duplication of funding there and
 
01:08:08.789 --> 01:08:08.799 align:start position:0%
that same um elimination of possibility
 
01:08:12.710 --> 01:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
of duplication is added in e in relation
 
01:08:16.269 --> 01:08:16.279 align:start position:0%
to curricular activities and
 
01:08:19.510 --> 01:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
programs coming down to
 
01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:21.789 align:start position:0%
programs coming down to
Jay

01:08:21.789 --> 01:08:21.799 align:start position:0%
Jay
 
01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
um we just changed
 
01:08:27.870 --> 01:08:27.880 align:start position:0%
that um from uh I believe it was just a
 
01:08:30.669 --> 01:08:30.679 align:start position:0%
national standardized uh test to a
 
01:08:33.229 --> 01:08:33.239 align:start position:0%
nationally standardized Norm reference
 
01:08:33.239 --> 01:08:34.669 align:start position:0%
nationally standardized Norm reference
achievement

01:08:34.669 --> 01:08:34.679 align:start position:0%
achievement
 
01:08:37.430 --> 01:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
test as an allowable
 
01:08:40.510 --> 01:08:40.520 align:start position:0%
expense uh proceeding on to page
 
01:08:45.669 --> 01:08:45.679 align:start position:0%
three um in rooman 7 uh there was just
 
01:08:49.349 --> 01:08:49.359 align:start position:0%
um a wording change in some places in
 
01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
the uh Bill uh it had said intentional
 
01:08:55.709 --> 01:08:55.719 align:start position:0%
and substantial Mis use of funds in some
 
01:08:58.630 --> 01:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
places had just substantial so we went
 
01:09:01.390 --> 01:09:01.400 align:start position:0%
back and added the same language in all
 
01:09:04.470 --> 01:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
those locations to read intentional and
 
01:09:10.910 --> 01:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:14.309 --> 01:09:14.319 align:start position:0%
funds coming over to page
 
01:09:19.430 --> 01:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
four um this is where we
 
01:09:24.349 --> 01:09:24.359 align:start position:0%
added um in response to hearing comments
 
01:09:28.870 --> 01:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
uh similar uh academic
 
01:09:31.510 --> 01:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
accountability uh Provisions that we've
 
01:09:34.189 --> 01:09:34.199 align:start position:0%
had in Prior legislation and you'll see
 
01:09:38.829 --> 01:09:38.839 align:start position:0%
that in number three that is um in what
 
01:09:43.950 --> 01:09:43.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:47.510 --> 01:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
um line nine or
 
01:09:52.910 --> 01:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
10 and um the parent is to provide an
 
01:09:54.510 --> 01:09:54.520 align:start position:0%
annual record of of
 
01:09:58.189 --> 01:09:58.199 align:start position:0%
attainment um by one of three means one
 
01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
is to take that nationally standardized
 
01:10:02.470 --> 01:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
Norm reference achievement test that we
 
01:10:05.229 --> 01:10:05.239 align:start position:0%
had defined as an allowable expense uh
 
01:10:07.669 --> 01:10:07.679 align:start position:0%
they can take uh the Statewide student
 
01:10:10.590 --> 01:10:10.600 align:start position:0%
assessment at a public school or
 
01:10:14.229 --> 01:10:14.239 align:start position:0%
maintain a portfolio or educational
 
01:10:17.189 --> 01:10:17.199 align:start position:0%
record um including uh
 
01:10:21.149 --> 01:10:21.159 align:start position:0%
materials um and uh workbooks uh created
 
01:10:24.030 --> 01:10:24.040 align:start position:0%
by the student during the year and that
 
01:10:28.430 --> 01:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
would be uh reviewed by a uh teacher um
 
01:10:32.030 --> 01:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
which is similar to Provisions in uh the
 
01:10:35.390 --> 01:10:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:39.910 --> 01:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
laws coming down to Roman
 
01:10:44.149 --> 01:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
8 which I believe is on line
 
01:10:47.070 --> 01:10:47.080 align:start position:0%
24 or
 
01:10:50.110 --> 01:10:50.120 align:start position:0%
um maybe I might have the wrong line
 
01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
number but it's um
 
01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:54.189 align:start position:0%
number but it's um
30

01:10:54.189 --> 01:10:54.199 align:start position:0%
30
 
01:10:59.110 --> 01:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
um that uh if the student uh the the
 
01:11:02.070 --> 01:11:02.080 align:start position:0%
student may withdraw from the program
 
01:11:06.030 --> 01:11:06.040 align:start position:0%
and enroll in another qualified program
 
01:11:09.149 --> 01:11:09.159 align:start position:0%
uh this goes back to the separation of
 
01:11:12.669 --> 01:11:12.679 align:start position:0%
categories uh to clarify that EFA
 
01:11:15.870 --> 01:11:15.880 align:start position:0%
students are not homeschool students so
 
01:11:18.470 --> 01:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
a student an EFA student can withdraw
 
01:11:22.270 --> 01:11:22.280 align:start position:0%
from the EFA program U and go back into
 
01:11:26.590 --> 01:11:26.600 align:start position:0%
public school or to a private school or
 
01:11:31.790 --> 01:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:40.270 --> 01:11:40.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:45.669 --> 01:11:45.679 align:start position:0%
believe scroll down um in uh Romans
 
01:11:49.830 --> 01:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
6A uh there was just a typo in the uh
 
01:11:54.750 --> 01:11:54.760 align:start position:0%
reference number uh to an RSA um prior
 
01:12:01.990 --> 01:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:06.550 --> 01:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:10.709 --> 01:12:10.719 align:start position:0%
six um again just the uh change to make
 
01:12:15.350 --> 01:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:18.590 --> 01:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
funds um on to page
 
01:12:23.070 --> 01:12:23.080 align:start position:0%
7 uh the scholarship organization uh May
 
01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:24.030 align:start position:0%
7 uh the scholarship organization uh May
adopt

01:12:24.030 --> 01:12:24.040 align:start position:0%
adopt
 
01:12:26.229 --> 01:12:26.239 align:start position:0%
guidelines or procedures we just changed
 
01:12:29.910 --> 01:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
this from Rules or procedures uh to uh
 
01:12:34.709 --> 01:12:34.719 align:start position:0%
clarify that uh as stated in the um
 
01:12:37.189 --> 01:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
section just above that that uh the
 
01:12:42.390 --> 01:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:47.310 --> 01:12:47.320 align:start position:0%
rules proceeding on to uh page eight and
 
01:12:51.350 --> 01:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
the uh advisory commission that's
 
01:12:53.950 --> 01:12:53.960 align:start position:0%
established um we just
 
01:12:56.669 --> 01:12:56.679 align:start position:0%
clarified uh there was a typo in the
 
01:12:59.030 --> 01:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
number of members that there are 13
 
01:13:05.229 --> 01:13:05.239 align:start position:0%
members um in total and that the um uh
 
01:13:08.390 --> 01:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
legislative uh members as well as the
 
01:13:10.470 --> 01:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
Director of the scholarship organization
 
01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:20.030 --> 01:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
members um and
 
01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:21.990 align:start position:0%
members um and
then

01:13:21.990 --> 01:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:13:27.629 --> 01:13:27.639 align:start position:0%
I see where the um line number is um
 
01:13:30.590 --> 01:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
should be on page nine I believe that we
 
01:13:36.189 --> 01:13:36.199 align:start position:0%
added um what is called the um it's a
 
01:13:39.550 --> 01:13:39.560 align:start position:0%
194 E10 line
 
01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:41.189 align:start position:0%
194 E10 line
29

01:13:41.189 --> 01:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
29
 
01:13:43.510 --> 01:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
um uh phase out
 
01:13:48.189 --> 01:13:48.199 align:start position:0%
grants or hold harmless grants
 
01:13:51.629 --> 01:13:51.639 align:start position:0%
um basically with this provision uh the
 
01:13:54.470 --> 01:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
first year that a student lead Lees a
 
01:13:56.830 --> 01:13:56.840 align:start position:0%
public school the public school is going
 
01:13:59.750 --> 01:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
to get 100% funding for that student
 
01:14:03.310 --> 01:14:03.320 align:start position:0%
since um payments are a year
 
01:14:06.350 --> 01:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
behind with this addition in the second
 
01:14:08.790 --> 01:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
year after that student leaves the
 
01:14:10.709 --> 01:14:10.719 align:start position:0%
district would get
 
01:14:16.590 --> 01:14:16.600 align:start position:0%
50% of that student's uh Grant and then
 
01:14:20.189 --> 01:14:20.199 align:start position:0%
25% in the third year so there is a a
 
01:14:23.790 --> 01:14:23.800 align:start position:0%
draw down or phase out um of the funds
 
01:14:26.669 --> 01:14:26.679 align:start position:0%
for the uh district for each student so
 
01:14:29.070 --> 01:14:29.080 align:start position:0%
they don't hit get hit in the second
 
01:14:31.110 --> 01:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
year with a complete loss of funds for
 
01:14:33.669 --> 01:14:33.679 align:start position:0%
that student uh to try and help with
 
01:14:36.070 --> 01:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
their uh budgeting and
 
01:14:41.910 --> 01:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
planning um so that is uh the new
 
01:14:47.350 --> 01:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
provision in this amendment um
 
01:14:49.350 --> 01:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
0399 um and
 
01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
I'll mention also on the last page uh
 
01:14:56.590 --> 01:14:56.600 align:start position:0%
two two things
 
01:14:56.600 --> 01:14:58.430 align:start position:0%
two two things
here

01:14:58.430 --> 01:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:15:00.669 --> 01:15:00.679 align:start position:0%
um in line
 
01:15:04.270 --> 01:15:04.280 align:start position:0%
18 uh again this is related to
 
01:15:08.229 --> 01:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
compulsory attendance and that uh EFA
 
01:15:10.430 --> 01:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
students are a new category and that's
 
01:15:13.470 --> 01:15:13.480 align:start position:0%
what you'll see in um section three the
 
01:15:15.910 --> 01:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
new subparagraph to the compulsory
 
01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:17.110 align:start position:0%
new subparagraph to the compulsory
attendance

01:15:17.110 --> 01:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
attendance
 
01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:18.950 align:start position:0%
attendance
law

01:15:18.950 --> 01:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:15:24.189 --> 01:15:24.199 align:start position:0%
and the uh number four line
 
01:15:26.790 --> 01:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
22 uh
 
01:15:31.189 --> 01:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
the income uh limit of
 
01:15:32.990 --> 01:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
375% is
 
01:15:38.750 --> 01:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
repealed in uh July of
 
01:15:42.470 --> 01:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
2026 uh this is a a trial period if you
 
01:15:46.709 --> 01:15:46.719 align:start position:0%
will um to uh see how the program is
 
01:15:49.910 --> 01:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
going so that uh income limit would be
 
01:15:52.110 --> 01:15:52.120 align:start position:0%
repealed and we also have the
 
01:15:54.149 --> 01:15:54.159 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee that is
 
01:15:56.830 --> 01:15:56.840 align:start position:0%
in effect that will monitor how the
 
01:15:58.990 --> 01:15:59.000 align:start position:0%
program is going and they can make
 
01:16:01.830 --> 01:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
recommendations such as U
 
01:16:06.790 --> 01:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
extending uh the income limit or um uh
 
01:16:08.510 --> 01:16:08.520 align:start position:0%
what they think is
 
01:16:13.629 --> 01:16:13.639 align:start position:0%
necessary and uh just to be uh be
 
01:16:18.709 --> 01:16:18.719 align:start position:0%
um full uh clarification also I'll
 
01:16:20.950 --> 01:16:20.960 align:start position:0%
mention with that phase out program I
 
01:16:22.870 --> 01:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
want to go back to that uh because I
 
01:16:26.390 --> 01:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
think left out one fact related to that
 
01:16:32.149 --> 01:16:32.159 align:start position:0%
um that also uh phases out the the
 
01:16:36.669 --> 01:16:36.679 align:start position:0%
phaseout grant provision um would end
 
01:16:40.430 --> 01:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
for new EFA students in July of
 
01:16:44.870 --> 01:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
26 uh just as this um the income uh
 
01:16:49.470 --> 01:16:49.480 align:start position:0%
limit does so that uh a new if EFA
 
01:16:52.229 --> 01:16:52.239 align:start position:0%
student um leaving the district after
 
01:16:53.629 --> 01:16:53.639 align:start position:0%
July 20
 
01:16:56.790 --> 01:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
26 there would be no phase out grant for
 
01:16:59.910 --> 01:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
that student however if uh a student
 
01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
left in
 
01:17:03.830 --> 01:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
2025 and was let's say in the second or
 
01:17:08.669 --> 01:17:08.679 align:start position:0%
third year of their um departure um
 
01:17:12.229 --> 01:17:12.239 align:start position:0%
those grants would continue for any uh
 
01:17:15.310 --> 01:17:15.320 align:start position:0%
student had who had left prior to that
 
01:17:17.550 --> 01:17:17.560 align:start position:0%
uh 2026
 
01:17:21.189 --> 01:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
date so those are the um I think the the
 
01:17:24.790 --> 01:17:24.800 align:start position:0%
main things included in this uh
 
01:17:29.750 --> 01:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
revision and um I think it addresses a
 
01:17:31.030 --> 01:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
number of the
 
01:17:33.990 --> 01:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
concerns um and comments made at the
 
01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:34.790 align:start position:0%
concerns um and comments made at the
public

01:17:34.790 --> 01:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:17:41.229 --> 01:17:41.239 align:start position:0%
hearings um and um we hope it will uh um
 
01:17:45.189 --> 01:17:45.199 align:start position:0%
meet some of those criticisms and
 
01:17:48.510 --> 01:17:48.520 align:start position:0%
um we think it uh really improves the
 
01:17:55.189 --> 01:17:55.199 align:start position:0%
bill and uh will be um more acceptable
 
01:18:00.390 --> 01:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
to school districts um and still be
 
01:18:04.030 --> 01:18:04.040 align:start position:0%
uh accomplishing what we wanted to do in
 
01:18:07.030 --> 01:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
terms of helping students throughout the
 
01:18:09.390 --> 01:18:09.400 align:start position:0%
state thank you Mr chairman you're
 
01:18:13.910 --> 01:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
you're welcome uh so with that um the if
 
01:18:16.590 --> 01:18:16.600 align:start position:0%
uh any individuals on the committee have
 
01:18:19.629 --> 01:18:19.639 align:start position:0%
questions regarding the amended language
 
01:18:21.669 --> 01:18:21.679 align:start position:0%
uh as presented in
 
01:18:23.669 --> 01:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
398 a
 
01:18:25.870 --> 01:18:25.880 align:start position:0%
um now is an opportunity and then what
 
01:18:28.110 --> 01:18:28.120 align:start position:0%
we'll do is uh once we go through the
 
01:18:30.149 --> 01:18:30.159 align:start position:0%
question period then we'll enter into
 
01:18:33.950 --> 01:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
the caucus um represent Miler yeah Mr
 
01:18:37.550 --> 01:18:37.560 align:start position:0%
chair uh I I
 
01:18:41.350 --> 01:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
respectfully asked the chair to create a
 
01:18:43.350 --> 01:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
hearing on this bill this is some these
 
01:18:46.669 --> 01:18:46.679 align:start position:0%
are major changes in a controversial
 
01:18:49.149 --> 01:18:49.159 align:start position:0%
bill that we've received hundreds of
 
01:18:52.270 --> 01:18:52.280 align:start position:0%
emails on and thousands of people have
 
01:18:54.830 --> 01:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
monitored this
 
01:18:58.870 --> 01:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
process and it seems to me that with
 
01:19:01.510 --> 01:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
these major changes that have just come
 
01:19:05.110 --> 01:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
about in the last 10 15
 
01:19:07.750 --> 01:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
minutes that there is reason that there
 
01:19:16.310 --> 01:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:20.629 --> 01:19:20.639 align:start position:0%
hearing so that who have voes these
 
01:19:22.870 --> 01:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
changes and I I would respectfully
 
01:19:25.709 --> 01:19:25.719 align:start position:0%
request the chair to set aside this at
 
01:19:28.229 --> 01:19:28.239 align:start position:0%
this point in time and create a hearing
 
01:19:30.110 --> 01:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
so that people can uh we have a chance
 
01:19:32.270 --> 01:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
to to really look at this I there's some
 
01:19:35.189 --> 01:19:35.199 align:start position:0%
major issues here that in you know the
 
01:19:38.470 --> 01:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
time remaining even in today to try to
 
01:19:41.430 --> 01:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
uh far it out the various issues I mean
 
01:19:44.110 --> 01:19:44.120 align:start position:0%
this this is this is a major
 
01:19:47.189 --> 01:19:47.199 align:start position:0%
shift in how we provide educational
 
01:19:49.149 --> 01:19:49.159 align:start position:0%
opportunities for students in the state
 
01:19:50.950 --> 01:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
and I would submit that uh we need to
 
01:19:53.149 --> 01:19:53.159 align:start position:0%
have more time on this I mean we were
 
01:19:54.669 --> 01:19:54.679 align:start position:0%
prepared to deal with what was already
 
01:19:56.990 --> 01:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
presented in the hearing
 
01:19:59.430 --> 01:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
before but these are major issues here
 
01:20:00.950 --> 01:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
that I I would submit that we need to
 
01:20:03.030 --> 01:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
have a hearing and and put this aside
 
01:20:04.830 --> 01:20:04.840 align:start position:0%
until we have that
 
01:20:08.310 --> 01:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
hearing are there are there any other uh
 
01:20:11.709 --> 01:20:11.719 align:start position:0%
uh comments at this point in time uh I
 
01:20:16.270 --> 01:20:16.280 align:start position:0%
will respond to this it's the the whole
 
01:20:18.870 --> 01:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
principle and concept behind this
 
01:20:21.189 --> 01:20:21.199 align:start position:0%
legislation and the intent of this
 
01:20:23.510 --> 01:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
legislation has been known
 
01:20:27.669 --> 01:20:27.679 align:start position:0%
from from its uh start uh the the
 
01:20:29.990 --> 01:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
concept is to provide the educational
 
01:20:32.709 --> 01:20:32.719 align:start position:0%
opportunity for those that just need
 
01:20:36.430 --> 01:20:36.440 align:start position:0%
another alternative situation or pathway
 
01:20:39.709 --> 01:20:39.719 align:start position:0%
uh to achieve their Public School
 
01:20:43.470 --> 01:20:43.480 align:start position:0%
experience um so I don't see what where
 
01:20:45.990 --> 01:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
you're saying this is a major shift
 
01:20:47.629 --> 01:20:47.639 align:start position:0%
there there's some changes in here in
 
01:20:50.430 --> 01:20:50.440 align:start position:0%
terms of Eligibility those changes are
 
01:20:52.550 --> 01:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
not anything really different than it
 
01:20:55.790 --> 01:20:55.800 align:start position:0%
was has been been discussed um uh
 
01:20:58.510 --> 01:20:58.520 align:start position:0%
through conversations or through even
 
01:20:58.520 --> 01:20:59.709 align:start position:0%
through conversations or through even
earlier

01:20:59.709 --> 01:20:59.719 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
01:21:02.870 --> 01:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
legislation um the concept of a phase
 
01:21:06.870 --> 01:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
out is one where uh it it supports some
 
01:21:09.870 --> 01:21:09.880 align:start position:0%
of the concerns that uh individuals had
 
01:21:12.310 --> 01:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
regarding assistance to districts during
 
01:21:15.470 --> 01:21:15.480 align:start position:0%
this initial startup um whether in
 
01:21:17.430 --> 01:21:17.440 align:start position:0%
phasing it out yes but it does as
 
01:21:19.470 --> 01:21:19.480 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli said provide the
 
01:21:22.270 --> 01:21:22.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity for a discussion through the
 
01:21:27.229 --> 01:21:27.239 align:start position:0%
over site committee so I I I'm not uh
 
01:21:29.189 --> 01:21:29.199 align:start position:0%
accepting the fact that this is a a
 
01:21:32.270 --> 01:21:32.280 align:start position:0%
major change it's um just refining this
 
01:21:34.310 --> 01:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
bill as we normally do with most bills
 
01:21:36.629 --> 01:21:36.639 align:start position:0%
with amending language it's a followup
 
01:21:38.669 --> 01:21:38.679 align:start position:0%
Mr chair yes there are ma there's a
 
01:21:41.550 --> 01:21:41.560 align:start position:0%
major fiscal impacts here you're talking
 
01:21:43.950 --> 01:21:43.960 align:start position:0%
about additional uh funds that are going
 
01:21:46.470 --> 01:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
to be made available to not only
 
01:21:48.669 --> 01:21:48.679 align:start position:0%
students but you're also talking about
 
01:21:50.750 --> 01:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
additional fiscal impact on the on the
 
01:21:53.149 --> 01:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
trust fund uh to
 
01:21:55.229 --> 01:21:55.239 align:start position:0%
in the uh to school district for those
 
01:21:57.350 --> 01:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
students who are leaving and yet we have
 
01:22:00.950 --> 01:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
not seen any phisical not fiscal note on
 
01:22:03.990 --> 01:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
what the impact of this bill is to the
 
01:22:07.149 --> 01:22:07.159 align:start position:0%
State education trust fund that alone
 
01:22:08.830 --> 01:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
should say to me that that we need to
 
01:22:11.790 --> 01:22:11.800 align:start position:0%
have at least that before we can pursue
 
01:22:13.910 --> 01:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
uh concluding this the discussion on
 
01:22:16.669 --> 01:22:16.679 align:start position:0%
this bill uh representative Miler I
 
01:22:18.189 --> 01:22:18.199 align:start position:0%
don't think that you're going to get an
 
01:22:21.030 --> 01:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
answer to your question there until this
 
01:22:24.229 --> 01:22:24.239 align:start position:0%
bill reaches Finance where the people
 
01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
that are properly prepared to delve into
 
01:22:30.830 --> 01:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal matters we are a policy committee
 
01:22:33.030 --> 01:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
and so we're addressing here the policy
 
01:22:36.830 --> 01:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
associated with uh
 
01:22:40.310 --> 01:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
hb20 however we don't we don't I I I
 
01:22:42.590 --> 01:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
don't disagree from the policy question
 
01:22:44.510 --> 01:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
but in the past Rick we we have looked
 
01:22:47.189 --> 01:22:47.199 align:start position:0%
at not only the policy but also the
 
01:22:49.669 --> 01:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact when we have the numbers
 
01:22:52.350 --> 01:22:52.360 align:start position:0%
and we don't have any numbers here and
 
01:22:55.149 --> 01:22:55.159 align:start position:0%
and that's very troubling to those of us
 
01:22:58.229 --> 01:22:58.239 align:start position:0%
that are concerned about the the uh
 
01:23:02.070 --> 01:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
policy question here but uh to submit
 
01:23:05.669 --> 01:23:05.679 align:start position:0%
this to the finance without an
 
01:23:07.550 --> 01:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
understanding of what some of the fiscal
 
01:23:10.550 --> 01:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
impact might be I think it's just
 
01:23:13.149 --> 01:23:13.159 align:start position:0%
irresponsible thank you um I'm GNA move
 
01:23:14.629 --> 01:23:14.639 align:start position:0%
on a couple other question I see the
 
01:23:17.390 --> 01:23:17.400 align:start position:0%
represent L has his hand up yeah thank
 
01:23:19.390 --> 01:23:19.400 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman I just want to Echo what
 
01:23:21.229 --> 01:23:21.239 align:start position:0%
representative Miler is stating here I
 
01:23:23.790 --> 01:23:23.800 align:start position:0%
mean um I understand that we're a policy
 
01:23:25.790 --> 01:23:25.800 align:start position:0%
committee and not necessarily fiscal but
 
01:23:28.110 --> 01:23:28.120 align:start position:0%
this new Amendment actually addresses
 
01:23:30.550 --> 01:23:30.560 align:start position:0%
certain fiscal matters and adopts them
 
01:23:34.110 --> 01:23:34.120 align:start position:0%
as policy okay so you are already
 
01:23:37.470 --> 01:23:37.480 align:start position:0%
considering issues of cost by putting in
 
01:23:39.510 --> 01:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
this phase out you have acknowledged
 
01:23:43.470 --> 01:23:43.480 align:start position:0%
that cost is part of the policy in this
 
01:23:45.910 --> 01:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
committee and therefore there should be
 
01:23:49.229 --> 01:23:49.239 align:start position:0%
fiscal knowledge uh of the overall cost
 
01:23:51.430 --> 01:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
as part of our consideration of the
 
01:23:53.510 --> 01:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
effects of this policy by your own
 
01:23:56.950 --> 01:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
admission in this amendment thank you
 
01:24:02.750 --> 01:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:07.189 --> 01:24:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:11.510 --> 01:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
lus yes um normally when we have a
 
01:24:13.870 --> 01:24:13.880 align:start position:0%
public hearing on something we then look
 
01:24:15.590 --> 01:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
at all of the input that was given
 
01:24:17.669 --> 01:24:17.679 align:start position:0%
during the public hearing we make
 
01:24:20.709 --> 01:24:20.719 align:start position:0%
amendments based on that input we do not
 
01:24:22.790 --> 01:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
have another public hearing at after
 
01:24:25.350 --> 01:24:25.360 align:start position:0%
that we have discussion amongst the
 
01:24:28.030 --> 01:24:28.040 align:start position:0%
committee what we did here was we took
 
01:24:31.110 --> 01:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
the majority input that we got from all
 
01:24:33.669 --> 01:24:33.679 align:start position:0%
of the people during two public hearings
 
01:24:35.990 --> 01:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
and included those in the bill we
 
01:24:37.830 --> 01:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
responded with the things that people
 
01:24:41.350 --> 01:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
were asking for and so at this point
 
01:24:43.910 --> 01:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
what we would normally do this is normal
 
01:24:46.390 --> 01:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
procedure is at this point we would not
 
01:24:48.109 --> 01:24:48.119 align:start position:0%
have a public another public hearing
 
01:24:50.870 --> 01:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
I've never actually heard of that we've

of that and come back so if I add uh the
 
01:25:30.590 --> 01:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
look at the clock right now it's roughly
 
01:25:34.709 --> 01:25:34.719 align:start position:0%
around 11 o'clock um so that if you take
 
01:25:37.629 --> 01:25:37.639 align:start position:0%
uh to to 11:45 and then we come back and
 
01:25:41.390 --> 01:25:41.400 align:start position:0%

01:25:49.310 --> 01:25:49.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair um just to
 
01:25:51.790 --> 01:25:51.800 align:start position:0%
just to clarify when we come back um
 
01:25:54.470 --> 01:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
that's when we're going to be able to to
 
01:25:57.070 --> 01:25:57.080 align:start position:0%
ask questions about the um uh the
 
01:26:00.390 --> 01:26:00.400 align:start position:0%
amendment and um make and and have uh uh
 
01:26:01.750 --> 01:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
essentially have
 
01:26:04.149 --> 01:26:04.159 align:start position:0%
deliberations we will when we come back
 
01:26:08.470 --> 01:26:08.480 align:start position:0%
we will have a motion to uh address this
 
01:26:10.870 --> 01:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
amendment and and then we'll get into
 
01:26:13.030 --> 01:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
discussion on on the amendment which is
 
01:26:16.430 --> 01:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
basically the bill um so that that will
 
01:26:17.990 --> 01:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
be our
 
01:26:20.910 --> 01:26:20.920 align:start position:0%
process well I think if I may though I
 
01:26:23.510 --> 01:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
think there may be questions that we
 
01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:24.430 align:start position:0%
think there may be questions that we
might

01:26:24.430 --> 01:26:24.440 align:start position:0%
might
 
01:26:27.430 --> 01:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
have uh for points of clarification
 
01:26:30.350 --> 01:26:30.360 align:start position:0%
before we get actually get into the
 
01:26:32.790 --> 01:26:32.800 align:start position:0%
discussion or the debate on this bill
 
01:26:34.950 --> 01:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
because I think there as we begin to
 
01:26:36.830 --> 01:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
review this amendment there are are
 
01:26:38.189 --> 01:26:38.199 align:start position:0%
going to be some questions come up and I
 
01:26:39.709 --> 01:26:39.719 align:start position:0%
think the question period is a little
 
01:26:42.669 --> 01:26:42.679 align:start position:0%
different than the actual debate that
 
01:26:45.070 --> 01:26:45.080 align:start position:0%
would be my
 
01:26:47.790 --> 01:26:47.800 align:start position:0%
suggestion thank you I'll take that into
 
01:26:50.270 --> 01:26:50.280 align:start position:0%
consideration thank you you're welcome
 
01:26:52.229 --> 01:26:52.239 align:start position:0%
so at this point in time we are going to
 
01:26:54.390 --> 01:26:54.400 align:start position:0%
recess and we'll come back at
 
01:26:57.109 --> 01:26:57.119 align:start position:0%
12:30 uh and and during that period of
 
01:26:58.790 --> 01:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
time we will have both opportunity for

20 and five uh and 608 excuse me um I'm
 
03:04:56.269 --> 03:04:56.279 align:start position:0%
not going to be taking any motions at
 
03:04:59.510 --> 03:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
this particular time um I'm I feel that
 
03:05:02.269 --> 03:05:02.279 align:start position:0%
there's really still a need for a little
 
03:05:05.150 --> 03:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
bit of discussion regarding hb20 and
 
03:05:07.309 --> 03:05:07.319 align:start position:0%
certainly with HB
 
03:05:11.950 --> 03:05:11.960 align:start position:0%
608 um so um I'd like to uh continue
 
03:05:15.349 --> 03:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
with hb2 we were when we when we left
 
03:05:15.359 --> 03:05:18.670 align:start position:0%
with hb2 we were when we when we left
off

03:05:18.670 --> 03:05:18.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:21.750 --> 03:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
um I I listened to uh some of the
 
03:05:24.190 --> 03:05:24.200 align:start position:0%
discussion beforehand that was coming
 
03:05:27.429 --> 03:05:27.439 align:start position:0%
from those that are all remote and there
 
03:05:31.190 --> 03:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
are some concerns there uh that we heard
 
03:05:34.030 --> 03:05:34.040 align:start position:0%
um and so I would like just to open this
 
03:05:37.429 --> 03:05:37.439 align:start position:0%
up to discussion to further discuss um
 
03:05:41.590 --> 03:05:41.600 align:start position:0%
uh hb20 uh with all people here on the
 
03:05:44.670 --> 03:05:44.680 align:start position:0%
committee um is is there anybody that
 
03:05:49.910 --> 03:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:54.349 --> 03:05:54.359 align:start position:0%
hb20 yes representa Tanner uh thank you
 
03:05:59.070 --> 03:05:59.080 align:start position:0%
chairman um I in going back through the
 
03:06:00.269 --> 03:06:00.279 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
03:06:03.750 --> 03:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
hb20 and looking specifically at all the
 
03:06:06.510 --> 03:06:06.520 align:start position:0%
things that the scholarship committee is
 
03:06:09.750 --> 03:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh designated to do I noticed that in
 
03:06:12.550 --> 03:06:12.560 align:start position:0%
some places it's called a scholarship
 
03:06:14.790 --> 03:06:14.800 align:start position:0%
committee and in other places it's
 
03:06:18.469 --> 03:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
called the scholarship committee um and
 
03:06:20.389 --> 03:06:20.399 align:start position:0%
right now we have actually two
 
03:06:22.190 --> 03:06:22.200 align:start position:0%
scholarship committees giving out the
 
03:06:23.790 --> 03:06:23.800 align:start position:0%
educational tax
 
03:06:25.670 --> 03:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
scholarships uh the children's
 
03:06:28.030 --> 03:06:28.040 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund and the giving and
 
03:06:32.710 --> 03:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
goinging Alliance and as I go through
 
03:06:35.990 --> 03:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
hb20 uh again and the places where the
 
03:06:38.030 --> 03:06:38.040 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization is supposed to
 
03:06:41.710 --> 03:06:41.720 align:start position:0%
make all these rules and oversight and
 
03:06:45.750 --> 03:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
forms for parents and um oversight on
 
03:06:48.790 --> 03:06:48.800 align:start position:0%
the spending um I'm wondering how that's
 
03:06:52.110 --> 03:06:52.120 align:start position:0%
going to be split up right now between
 
03:06:55.030 --> 03:06:55.040 align:start position:0%
two scholarship committees and certainly
 
03:06:59.349 --> 03:06:59.359 align:start position:0%
um if others came in and wished to uh be
 
03:07:01.190 --> 03:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
recognized as a scholarship committee
 
03:07:03.750 --> 03:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
for this purpose I'm sure that they
 
03:07:06.030 --> 03:07:06.040 align:start position:0%
could get uh approval by the Secretary
 
03:07:09.550 --> 03:07:09.560 align:start position:0%
of State and the um budget
 
03:07:11.750 --> 03:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
office oh repr
 
03:07:14.830 --> 03:07:14.840 align:start position:0%
cardelli uh thank than you Mr chairman
 
03:07:16.750 --> 03:07:16.760 align:start position:0%
um first of all a scholarship
 
03:07:18.870 --> 03:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
organization has to uh go through the
 
03:07:20.590 --> 03:07:20.600 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue Administration and
 
03:07:24.710 --> 03:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
get approved by then and uh I believe uh
 
03:07:27.429 --> 03:07:27.439 align:start position:0%
in Prior discussions with the Department
 
03:07:31.830 --> 03:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:35.469 --> 03:07:35.479 align:start position:0%
RFP so if there were multiple um just as
 
03:07:41.950 --> 03:07:41.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:43.950 --> 03:07:43.960 align:start position:0%
scholarship I
 
03:07:48.269 --> 03:07:48.279 align:start position:0%
can't hear you represent Tanner are you
 
03:07:52.269 --> 03:07:52.279 align:start position:0%
did yes um as a followup um just if
 
03:07:54.590 --> 03:07:54.600 align:start position:0%
there's multiple organizations handling
 
03:07:57.389 --> 03:07:57.399 align:start position:0%
this uh information this oversight for
 
03:07:59.469 --> 03:07:59.479 align:start position:0%
example the oversight committee where
 
03:08:03.030 --> 03:08:03.040 align:start position:0%
the scholarship committee um
 
03:08:06.309 --> 03:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
appoints uh you know seven members to it
 
03:08:09.469 --> 03:08:09.479 align:start position:0%
um I don't see any way in this bill that
 
03:08:11.790 --> 03:08:11.800 align:start position:0%
that organiz that type of organization
 
03:08:14.469 --> 03:08:14.479 align:start position:0%
and and I have to reiterate that the
 
03:08:17.510 --> 03:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization has taken
 
03:08:21.070 --> 03:08:21.080 align:start position:0%
over uh a lot of what a Department of
 
03:08:24.750 --> 03:08:24.760 align:start position:0%
Education would do or um the education
 
03:08:28.269 --> 03:08:28.279 align:start position:0%
laws it it takes that whole uh part of
 
03:08:31.750 --> 03:08:31.760 align:start position:0%
the oversite out how how is that going
 
03:08:34.190 --> 03:08:34.200 align:start position:0%
to work intertwine with multiple
 
03:08:34.200 --> 03:08:37.150 align:start position:0%
to work intertwine with multiple
scholarship

03:08:37.150 --> 03:08:37.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:40.790 --> 03:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
organizations uh as I tried to indicate
 
03:08:43.229 --> 03:08:43.239 align:start position:0%
there would be an RFP issued and there
 
03:08:45.590 --> 03:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
would be one scholarship organization
 
03:08:49.190 --> 03:08:49.200 align:start position:0%
managing the accounts so as a followup
 
03:08:52.429 --> 03:08:52.439 align:start position:0%
to that so we're setting up a monopoly
 
03:08:55.469 --> 03:08:55.479 align:start position:0%
for one scholarship organization that's
 
03:08:59.190 --> 03:08:59.200 align:start position:0%
going to receive 10% of the monies that
 
03:09:01.309 --> 03:09:01.319 align:start position:0%
go into that scholarship Organization
 
03:09:03.990 --> 03:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
for administration and and whatever is
 
03:09:06.269 --> 03:09:06.279 align:start position:0%
that is that what I'm led to believe at
 
03:09:06.279 --> 03:09:07.670 align:start position:0%
that is that what I'm led to believe at
this

03:09:07.670 --> 03:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:09:10.790 --> 03:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
point I do not believe that you could uh
 
03:09:12.750 --> 03:09:12.760 align:start position:0%
legitimately call it a monopoly you
 
03:09:16.309 --> 03:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
would be uh awarding a contract uh with
 
03:09:20.389 --> 03:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:22.510 --> 03:09:22.520 align:start position:0%
accounts Mr
 
03:09:25.190 --> 03:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
chair representa Ellison's had his hand
 
03:09:28.389 --> 03:09:28.399 align:start position:0%
up representative Ellison thank you Mr
 
03:09:31.150 --> 03:09:31.160 align:start position:0%
chairman I I'd like some clarification
 
03:09:34.590 --> 03:09:34.600 align:start position:0%
if I can get it from sponsors of of the
 
03:09:38.710 --> 03:09:38.720 align:start position:0%
of the bill relating to uh page seven
 
03:09:43.590 --> 03:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
lines 15 to 18 which talk about
 
03:09:46.309 --> 03:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
uh you should not exclude discriminate
 
03:09:48.070 --> 03:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
against otherwise disadvantage any
 
03:09:50.190 --> 03:09:50.200 align:start position:0%
educational provider with respect to
 
03:09:53.429 --> 03:09:53.439 align:start position:0%
programs my question is that if you have
 
03:09:55.670 --> 03:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
an educational organization a school for
 
03:09:59.590 --> 03:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
instance which could be a Jewish school
 
03:10:02.269 --> 03:10:02.279 align:start position:0%
a Muslim School a Christian School
 
03:10:05.309 --> 03:10:05.319 align:start position:0%
whatever it was and in in its mission
 
03:10:08.469 --> 03:10:08.479 align:start position:0%
statement it said that homosexuality is
 
03:10:10.870 --> 03:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
a sin and gay people will not be allowed
 
03:10:13.670 --> 03:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
to enroll in
 
03:10:17.870 --> 03:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
school would uh an EFA still be accepted
 
03:10:21.190 --> 03:10:21.200 align:start position:0%
or EFA be given to that school if that
 
03:10:23.190 --> 03:10:23.200 align:start position:0%
was the
 
03:10:25.389 --> 03:10:25.399 align:start position:0%
situation there are federal
 
03:10:28.429 --> 03:10:28.439 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination laws that apply to
 
03:10:29.630 --> 03:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
all our
 
03:10:32.870 --> 03:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
organizations uh but at the same time a
 
03:10:34.870 --> 03:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
religious institution is not going to be
 
03:10:38.190 --> 03:10:38.200 align:start position:0%
required to change the basic tenants um
 
03:10:41.229 --> 03:10:41.239 align:start position:0%
of their faith or
 
03:10:44.870 --> 03:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
practice follow up Mr Mr
 
03:10:48.469 --> 03:10:48.479 align:start position:0%
chairman uh well then if if in fact the
 
03:10:51.429 --> 03:10:51.439 align:start position:0%
basic tenant of the school was
 
03:10:54.110 --> 03:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
that only Muslim Students would be
 
03:10:56.710 --> 03:10:56.720 align:start position:0%
accepted that you had to be a a believer
 
03:10:59.070 --> 03:10:59.080 align:start position:0%
in that faith and no one else could be
 
03:11:01.630 --> 03:11:01.640 align:start position:0%
would that come under that particular
 
03:11:08.429 --> 03:11:08.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:10.790 --> 03:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
rule I'm not sure that's a that's a
 
03:11:13.550 --> 03:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
hypothetical question I I don't know
 
03:11:18.630 --> 03:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
um uh but uh I do know that it would be
 
03:11:21.269 --> 03:11:21.279 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional uh in my opinion I'm
 
03:11:26.670 --> 03:11:26.680 align:start position:0%
not a a lawyer or desire to be a lawyer
 
03:11:33.190 --> 03:11:33.200 align:start position:0%
um but uh it would not be uh valid to
 
03:11:36.269 --> 03:11:36.279 align:start position:0%
have an organization be required to
 
03:11:38.550 --> 03:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
change uh you know we've seen Court
 
03:11:41.469 --> 03:11:41.479 align:start position:0%
decisions recently uh in the past couple
 
03:11:44.389 --> 03:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
of years uh about uh with healthc care
 
03:11:47.309 --> 03:11:47.319 align:start position:0%
and requirements for organizations to do
 
03:11:49.910 --> 03:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
various things um in opposition to the
 
03:11:52.590 --> 03:11:52.600 align:start position:0%
tenants of their faith so I I think you
 
03:11:55.870 --> 03:11:55.880 align:start position:0%
could look to those Court
 
03:11:57.910 --> 03:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
decisions further
 
03:12:02.510 --> 03:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
question Mr chair yeah just a procedure
 
03:12:07.070 --> 03:12:07.080 align:start position:0%
here uh could I suggest that we start on
 
03:12:07.080 --> 03:12:08.030 align:start position:0%
here uh could I suggest that we start on
page

03:12:08.030 --> 03:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
page
 
03:12:11.750 --> 03:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
one and go through the various sections
 
03:12:14.870 --> 03:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
so that there's some sense of order uh
 
03:12:17.150 --> 03:12:17.160 align:start position:0%
to raising questions of Representative
 
03:12:19.550 --> 03:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
cordelli so it's it's not just all over
 
03:12:21.269 --> 03:12:21.279 align:start position:0%
the map but we can go right through and
 
03:12:23.630 --> 03:12:23.640 align:start position:0%
go through and raise a serious qu raise
 
03:12:25.790 --> 03:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
whatever question someone might have on
 
03:12:27.510 --> 03:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
a particular if there's no question then
 
03:12:29.269 --> 03:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
we just move right on I'm just
 
03:12:32.229 --> 03:12:32.239 align:start position:0%
suggesting that as a
 
03:12:34.670 --> 03:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
procedural move
 
03:12:37.229 --> 03:12:37.239 align:start position:0%
here I have no objections to that
 
03:12:41.070 --> 03:12:41.080 align:start position:0%
process all right so so uh will will all
 
03:12:43.229 --> 03:12:43.239 align:start position:0%
of us does everybody have have it either
 
03:12:46.110 --> 03:12:46.120 align:start position:0%
up on their computer or have a copy of a
 
03:12:47.590 --> 03:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
a hard copy
 
03:12:52.590 --> 03:12:52.600 align:start position:0%
available so we'll look at um page one
 
03:12:57.349 --> 03:12:57.359 align:start position:0%
good and if there's um someone with a
 
03:13:00.750 --> 03:13:00.760 align:start position:0%
question uh referencing page one page
 
03:13:03.030 --> 03:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
one includes
 
03:13:06.190 --> 03:13:06.200 align:start position:0%
definitions and also uh one of those
 
03:13:09.429 --> 03:13:09.439 align:start position:0%
definitions is that of an eligible
 
03:13:12.190 --> 03:13:12.200 align:start position:0%
student yeah well before we get there I
 
03:13:17.309 --> 03:13:17.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:17.319 --> 03:13:19.030 align:start position:0%
 
19

03:13:19.030 --> 03:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
19
 
03:13:23.630 --> 03:13:23.640 align:start position:0%
uh it talks about an education service
 
03:13:26.630 --> 03:13:26.640 align:start position:0%
provider means a person or organization
 
03:13:29.150 --> 03:13:29.160 align:start position:0%
that receives payment but it does not
 
03:13:32.750 --> 03:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
have any sense of definition of what is
 
03:13:36.269 --> 03:13:36.279 align:start position:0%
an educational provider uh can somebody
 
03:13:39.870 --> 03:13:39.880 align:start position:0%
clarify for me what that means it it it
 
03:13:42.510 --> 03:13:42.520 align:start position:0%
it appears that there's no qualific
 
03:13:44.630 --> 03:13:44.640 align:start position:0%
appliation whatsoever as far as
 
03:13:47.309 --> 03:13:47.319 align:start position:0%
credentialing experience Etc so could
 
03:13:51.349 --> 03:13:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:54.229 --> 03:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
please I thought it was pretty
 
03:13:59.590 --> 03:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
self-explanatory I can't hear you GL
 
03:14:02.150 --> 03:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
sorry you're mut yeah I'm not used to
 
03:14:04.950 --> 03:14:04.960 align:start position:0%
pressing the microphone button um I'm
 
03:14:07.510 --> 03:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
lucky if I can press it on my computer
 
03:14:09.950 --> 03:14:09.960 align:start position:0%
um the uh I thought it was pretty
 
03:14:11.790 --> 03:14:11.800 align:start position:0%
self-explanatory it can be either a
 
03:14:13.630 --> 03:14:13.640 align:start position:0%
person in or organization that provides
 
03:14:16.550 --> 03:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
services it could be a a private school
 
03:14:18.429 --> 03:14:18.439 align:start position:0%
um it could be a teacher who's working
 
03:14:23.269 --> 03:14:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:28.630 --> 03:14:28.640 align:start position:0%
um or a store that sells a
 
03:14:32.190 --> 03:14:32.200 align:start position:0%
curriculum so with that though I mean I
 
03:14:34.110 --> 03:14:34.120 align:start position:0%
I think we may have raised this before
 
03:14:37.150 --> 03:14:37.160 align:start position:0%
so if uh if I want my member of my
 
03:14:41.510 --> 03:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
family for example uh to be a tutor of
 
03:14:46.349 --> 03:14:46.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:51.910 --> 03:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:55.309 --> 03:14:55.319 align:start position:0%
then could you're
 
03:14:58.710 --> 03:14:58.720 align:start position:0%
you're a education service provider is
 
03:14:58.720 --> 03:14:59.469 align:start position:0%
you're a education service provider is
that

03:14:59.469 --> 03:14:59.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:15:01.590 --> 03:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
correct let let me try can you hear me
 
03:15:04.990 --> 03:15:05.000 align:start position:0%
better now yes yes okay so my question
 
03:15:08.309 --> 03:15:08.319 align:start position:0%
was is that if if I have a member of my
 
03:15:09.630 --> 03:15:09.640 align:start position:0%
family for
 
03:15:12.790 --> 03:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
example who I would select to be a two
 
03:15:16.590 --> 03:15:16.600 align:start position:0%
of one of my children that individual
 
03:15:19.510 --> 03:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
family member could be an education
 
03:15:22.550 --> 03:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
service provider is that
 
03:15:25.750 --> 03:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
correct I think that uh anyone looking
 
03:15:27.670 --> 03:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
to educate their children if they are
 
03:15:29.750 --> 03:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
looking for a tutor is going to uh
 
03:15:32.910 --> 03:15:32.920 align:start position:0%
select someone who is qualified in the
 
03:15:34.670 --> 03:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
subject matter that they are looking to
 
03:15:38.229 --> 03:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
teach certainly for a tutoring facility
 
03:15:40.670 --> 03:15:40.680 align:start position:0%
um we have a number of organizations
 
03:15:42.389 --> 03:15:42.399 align:start position:0%
around the state that provide tutor
 
03:15:44.309 --> 03:15:44.319 align:start position:0%
green services that I think would be
 
03:15:47.349 --> 03:15:47.359 align:start position:0%
qualified to uh perform that function
 
03:15:50.389 --> 03:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
that's not if I may uh Mr chair that
 
03:15:53.469 --> 03:15:53.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't answer my question I understand
 
03:15:54.790 --> 03:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
that there are there are those kinds of
 
03:15:57.750 --> 03:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
providers out there but there is no
 
03:16:02.510 --> 03:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
qualification for what is a education
 
03:16:04.630 --> 03:16:04.640 align:start position:0%
service provider that's really my point
 
03:16:07.710 --> 03:16:07.720 align:start position:0%
and my concern that there's no
 
03:16:10.670 --> 03:16:10.680 align:start position:0%
definition of what that individual might
 
03:16:13.870 --> 03:16:13.880 align:start position:0%
be organizations IND uals Etc that's my
 
03:16:15.510 --> 03:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
concern on this this particular
 
03:16:18.950 --> 03:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
definition thank you represent
 
03:16:21.670 --> 03:16:21.680 align:start position:0%
leus yes I was asking some of these
 
03:16:25.429 --> 03:16:25.439 align:start position:0%
questions um over the last few months
 
03:16:30.189 --> 03:16:30.199 align:start position:0%
and my understanding is that
 
03:16:34.710 --> 03:16:34.720 align:start position:0%
um we'll be using class wallet and in
 
03:16:37.389 --> 03:16:37.399 align:start position:0%
order for anybody to get paid through
 
03:16:41.830 --> 03:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
class wallet they have to have um gotten
 
03:16:43.910 --> 03:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
clearance from the scholarship
 
03:16:46.309 --> 03:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
Organization for money to be able to go
 
03:16:49.550 --> 03:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
to them so for somebody who wants to be
 
03:16:51.710 --> 03:16:51.720 align:start position:0%
a service provider has to sign up
 
03:16:53.309 --> 03:16:53.319 align:start position:0%
through the scholarship
 
03:16:56.630 --> 03:16:56.640 align:start position:0%
organization and um so there's oversight
 
03:16:58.590 --> 03:16:58.600 align:start position:0%
there as to who would be doing that or
 
03:17:00.309 --> 03:17:00.319 align:start position:0%
they would not get
 
03:17:04.110 --> 03:17:04.120 align:start position:0%
money further questions representative
 
03:17:04.120 --> 03:17:05.269 align:start position:0%
money further questions representative
uh

03:17:05.269 --> 03:17:05.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:17:08.189 --> 03:17:08.199 align:start position:0%
leay thank you Mr chairman um before I
 
03:17:09.990 --> 03:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
ask my questions I would respond to the
 
03:17:12.429 --> 03:17:12.439 align:start position:0%
previous comment there that um oversight
 
03:17:14.870 --> 03:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
there is no oversight there um for
 
03:17:16.950 --> 03:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
example if my spouse has a different
 
03:17:19.150 --> 03:17:19.160 align:start position:0%
last name than I do the scholarship
 
03:17:21.269 --> 03:17:21.279 align:start position:0%
organization would have no idea that we
 
03:17:24.990 --> 03:17:25.000 align:start position:0%
are uh married um and since there seems
 
03:17:27.110 --> 03:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
to be no provision for any sort of
 
03:17:29.750 --> 03:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
qualifications to make a judgment um
 
03:17:31.910 --> 03:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
obviously it would go through um we need
 
03:17:33.590 --> 03:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
to be talking about the specifics and
 
03:17:35.189 --> 03:17:35.199 align:start position:0%
the things that are actually in the bill
 
03:17:38.309 --> 03:17:38.319 align:start position:0%
not what we think people might do um I
 
03:17:40.349 --> 03:17:40.359 align:start position:0%
have a specific question though um and
 
03:17:42.349 --> 03:17:42.359 align:start position:0%
This concerns um the definition of an
 
03:17:44.349 --> 03:17:44.359 align:start position:0%
eligible student actually uh just two
 
03:17:47.990 --> 03:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
questions one um so as far as the way
 
03:17:49.830 --> 03:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
the definition goes if I were 40 years
 
03:17:51.590 --> 03:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
old and I did not graduate high school
 
03:17:56.229 --> 03:17:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:01.469 --> 03:18:01.479 align:start position:0%
eligible no 20 no no an eligible student
 
03:18:05.349 --> 03:18:05.359 align:start position:0%
for uh Public School in New
 
03:18:07.750 --> 03:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire am I eligible to go back to
 
03:18:09.150 --> 03:18:09.160 align:start position:0%
public school in any way if I didn't
 
03:18:11.349 --> 03:18:11.359 align:start position:0%
finish high school if I did not graduate
 
03:18:14.790 --> 03:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:18.670 --> 03:18:18.680 align:start position:0%
okay second question um the
 
03:18:22.750 --> 03:18:22.760 align:start position:0%
375% uh or actually no um actually I'll
 
03:18:24.349 --> 03:18:24.359 align:start position:0%
wait I'll wait I'll
 
03:18:26.469 --> 03:18:26.479 align:start position:0%
wait sorry if I may it's the
 
03:18:29.150 --> 03:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
representative Leon the the right now a
 
03:18:31.030 --> 03:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
public school student is no longer a
 
03:18:32.590 --> 03:18:32.600 align:start position:0%
public school student after their 21
 
03:18:35.630 --> 03:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
years of age that's in the statutes okay
 
03:18:39.189 --> 03:18:39.199 align:start position:0%
thank you I said no right uh and if I
 
03:18:42.750 --> 03:18:42.760 align:start position:0%
could go back um there are provisions in
 
03:18:45.790 --> 03:18:45.800 align:start position:0%
numerous places for the scholarship
 
03:18:47.750 --> 03:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
organization where there is a
 
03:18:50.950 --> 03:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
substantial misuse of funds uh to report
 
03:18:52.870 --> 03:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
that to the department and to the
 
03:18:55.630 --> 03:18:55.640 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office it needs to be
 
03:18:57.950 --> 03:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
substantial and intentional
 
03:19:01.030 --> 03:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
correct okay are are there further areas
 
03:19:03.870 --> 03:19:03.880 align:start position:0%
that let's walk through and again look
 
03:19:07.349 --> 03:19:07.359 align:start position:0%
at specific areas within so we can all
 
03:19:10.510 --> 03:19:10.520 align:start position:0%
respond uh representative
 
03:19:13.950 --> 03:19:13.960 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you Mr chairman um I'd
 
03:19:15.710 --> 03:19:15.720 align:start position:0%
like to follow up on representative

mil's comment and the answer from
 
03:19:20.510 --> 03:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli when you're
 
03:19:22.309 --> 03:19:22.319 align:start position:0%
talking about the service provider and I
 
03:19:25.790 --> 03:19:25.800 align:start position:0%
know you didn't want to flip forward but
 
03:19:28.269 --> 03:19:28.279 align:start position:0%
on line
 
03:19:31.229 --> 03:19:31.239 align:start position:0%
19 of page eight going back to that
 
03:19:35.630 --> 03:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
comment it says providers ECP providers
 
03:19:38.830 --> 03:19:38.840 align:start position:0%
the service scholarship organization May
 
03:19:41.590 --> 03:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
provide approve education service
 
03:19:43.469 --> 03:19:43.479 align:start position:0%
providers of our own
 
03:19:45.150 --> 03:19:45.160 align:start position:0%
initiative doesn't say anything about
 
03:19:47.030 --> 03:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
going through the
 
03:19:50.910 --> 03:19:50.920 align:start position:0%
process page 19 I mean page eight line9
 
03:19:52.870 --> 03:19:52.880 align:start position:0%

03:19:55.910 --> 03:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
Education Service Providers on its own
 
03:19:58.750 --> 03:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
initiative at the request of parents but
 
03:20:02.030 --> 03:20:02.040 align:start position:0%
no it to a Sol organization so it's it's
 
03:20:05.150 --> 03:20:05.160 align:start position:0%
not as clearcut as it may seem by
 
03:20:06.750 --> 03:20:06.760 align:start position:0%
representative quell's presentation that
 
03:20:07.870 --> 03:20:07.880 align:start position:0%
they're going through
 
03:20:10.030 --> 03:20:10.040 align:start position:0%
this uh
 
03:20:15.469 --> 03:20:15.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:15.479 --> 03:20:16.830 align:start position:0%
 
represent

03:20:16.830 --> 03:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
represent
 
03:20:20.229 --> 03:20:20.239 align:start position:0%
luno thank you very much Mr chair um I
 
03:20:22.710 --> 03:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
also have a um a question with regards
 
03:20:25.910 --> 03:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
to on on page one with regards to the
 
03:20:28.550 --> 03:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
the the definition of an eligible
 
03:20:31.550 --> 03:20:31.560 align:start position:0%
student and um I want to talk about it
 
03:20:33.110 --> 03:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
with the training wheels taken off
 
03:20:35.550 --> 03:20:35.560 align:start position:0%
basically the the repeal at the uh at
 
03:20:38.070 --> 03:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
the end of this bill that um that
 
03:20:41.110 --> 03:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
repeals um Roman 6 which is the
 
03:20:43.910 --> 03:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
definition of an eligible student so I'd
 
03:20:46.630 --> 03:20:46.640 align:start position:0%
like the questions I have answered in in
 
03:20:50.189 --> 03:20:50.199 align:start position:0%
that context so my first question is
 
03:20:52.269 --> 03:20:52.279 align:start position:0%
would um would students who live in New
 
03:20:54.990 --> 03:20:55.000 align:start position:0%

03:21:00.790 --> 03:21:00.800 align:start position:0%
private or Charter or H schools be um uh
 
03:21:00.800 --> 03:21:02.550 align:start position:0%

be
eligible

03:21:04.269 --> 03:21:04.279 align:start position:0%
eligible
 
03:21:06.389 --> 03:21:06.399 align:start position:0%
yes first of all I'm not sure what
 
03:21:07.630 --> 03:21:07.640 align:start position:0%
you're talking about in terms of
 
03:21:10.830 --> 03:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
training wheels all right well basically
 
03:21:14.110 --> 03:21:14.120 align:start position:0%
Paras secondly can I finish my answer
 
03:21:17.590 --> 03:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
thank you uh secondly wa when when when
 
03:21:19.189 --> 03:21:19.199 align:start position:0%
I talk about that I'm talking about the
 
03:21:20.750 --> 03:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
repeal language I thought I was pretty
 
03:21:23.469 --> 03:21:23.479 align:start position:0%
clear on that well I'm not familiar with
 
03:21:25.750 --> 03:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
the training wheels reference well
 
03:21:27.030 --> 03:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
that's what it's what you called it you
 
03:21:28.469 --> 03:21:28.479 align:start position:0%
said we wanted to give it a try for a
 
03:21:32.150 --> 03:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
few years and then and then open it wide
 
03:21:34.469 --> 03:21:34.479 align:start position:0%
up that's pretty much what TR training
 
03:21:37.389 --> 03:21:37.399 align:start position:0%
wheels do well let Let's uh let's not go
 
03:21:39.189 --> 03:21:39.199 align:start position:0%
there okay folks let's keep you know
 
03:21:40.229 --> 03:21:40.239 align:start position:0%
what I'm talking about you know what the
 
03:21:43.790 --> 03:21:43.800 align:start position:0%
question is
 
03:21:46.870 --> 03:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
go go ahead uh representative cordelli
 
03:21:50.590 --> 03:21:50.600 align:start position:0%
do you have want to respond to
 
03:21:53.510 --> 03:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
that could you restate your question uh
 
03:21:57.110 --> 03:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
sure sure I in in the context of this
 
03:22:02.229 --> 03:22:02.239 align:start position:0%
bill with Roman 6 on page one
 
03:22:04.670 --> 03:22:04.680 align:start position:0%
repealed based on the the repeal
 
03:22:05.910 --> 03:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
language in the
 
03:22:09.229 --> 03:22:09.239 align:start position:0%
bill would a student who lives in New
 
03:22:12.750 --> 03:22:12.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and attends either a public
 
03:22:16.469 --> 03:22:16.479 align:start position:0%
private Charter or is homeschooled be
 
03:22:21.150 --> 03:22:21.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:26.189 --> 03:22:26.199 align:start position:0%
program the uh yes the right now the uh
 
03:22:28.750 --> 03:22:28.760 align:start position:0%
student who is homeschooled in a private
 
03:22:31.630 --> 03:22:31.640 align:start position:0%
school or a public school is eligible
 
03:22:32.990 --> 03:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
okay and a I've got a couple of
 
03:22:35.150 --> 03:22:35.160 align:start position:0%
follow-ups on that because I W to take
 
03:22:37.950 --> 03:22:37.960 align:start position:0%
it through and really understand what an
 
03:22:40.189 --> 03:22:40.199 align:start position:0%
eligible student who is eligible for
 
03:22:43.550 --> 03:22:43.560 align:start position:0%
this program once the um once Roman six
 
03:22:47.510 --> 03:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
is is repealed so um would would a
 
03:22:52.150 --> 03:22:52.160 align:start position:0%
student who is uh in New Hampshire um or
 
03:22:54.590 --> 03:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
let me say it another way would a person
 
03:22:57.030 --> 03:22:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh who lives in New Hampshire and is
 
03:22:58.670 --> 03:22:58.680 align:start position:0%
over the age of
 
03:23:02.349 --> 03:23:02.359 align:start position:0%
18 um be eligible for this
 
03:23:05.030 --> 03:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
program yes if they haven't graduated
 
03:23:07.830 --> 03:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
from high school uh yeah if they haven't
 
03:23:09.670 --> 03:23:09.680 align:start position:0%
graduated from high school right now we
 
03:23:14.870 --> 03:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
have uh 167 year olds um who are in uh
 
03:23:17.150 --> 03:23:17.160 align:start position:0%
program called diploma programs paying
 
03:23:19.830 --> 03:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
for tuition at schools so they can uh
 
03:23:23.990 --> 03:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
get their uh uh degrees from high school
 
03:23:27.070 --> 03:23:27.080 align:start position:0%
okay and but we also have um 20 and 21
 
03:23:30.189 --> 03:23:30.199 align:start position:0%
year olds also that that don't have a
 
03:23:33.870 --> 03:23:33.880 align:start position:0%
high school degree that's correct and
 
03:23:35.830 --> 03:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
they would be eligible for this program
 
03:23:37.429 --> 03:23:37.439 align:start position:0%
all right I want to push it I want to
 
03:23:39.150 --> 03:23:39.160 align:start position:0%
push it a little further because it's
 
03:23:41.269 --> 03:23:41.279 align:start position:0%
really important to understand who's
 
03:23:41.279 --> 03:23:42.309 align:start position:0%
really important to understand who's
eligible

03:23:42.309 --> 03:23:42.319 align:start position:0%
eligible
 
03:23:44.590 --> 03:23:44.600 align:start position:0%
um for this so I I appreciate the
 
03:23:49.070 --> 03:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
chair's Indulgence um on this and um and
 
03:23:52.790 --> 03:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
and so would would a student who dropped
 
03:23:55.910 --> 03:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
out of high school let's say when they
 
03:23:55.920 --> 03:23:57.229 align:start position:0%
out of high school let's say when they
were

03:23:57.229 --> 03:23:57.239 align:start position:0%
were
 
03:23:59.349 --> 03:23:59.359 align:start position:0%
18 never
 
03:24:02.349 --> 03:24:02.359 align:start position:0%
graduated and then and now they're
 
03:24:07.150 --> 03:24:07.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:10.110 --> 03:24:10.120 align:start position:0%
program no I do not believe so all right
 
03:24:12.550 --> 03:24:12.560 align:start position:0%
could you point to the the particular
 
03:24:15.790 --> 03:24:15.800 align:start position:0%
piece in the um bill which would um
 
03:24:18.910 --> 03:24:18.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:22.150 --> 03:24:22.160 align:start position:0%
answer age okay well we're not gonna in
 
03:24:25.229 --> 03:24:25.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:29.910 --> 03:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:32.030 --> 03:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
it I mean could this be one of the
 
03:24:34.590 --> 03:24:34.600 align:start position:0%
things that's judged by no government
 
03:24:37.630 --> 03:24:37.640 align:start position:0%
intervention or stuff like
 
03:24:42.229 --> 03:24:42.239 align:start position:0%
that uh I think um we see where you're
 
03:24:44.870 --> 03:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
going with this
 
03:24:47.870 --> 03:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
um excuse me I think we see where you're
 
03:24:50.510 --> 03:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
going and um you know would have been a
 
03:24:53.870 --> 03:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
lot simpler um to uh ask a direct
 
03:24:57.910 --> 03:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
question but um perhaps the a was uh
 
03:25:00.870 --> 03:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
left out of that repeal provision um in
 
03:25:00.880 --> 03:25:01.870 align:start position:0%
left out of that repeal provision um in
the

03:25:01.870 --> 03:25:01.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:25:04.590 --> 03:25:04.600 align:start position:0%
redrafting okay so I want to keep going
 
03:25:07.710 --> 03:25:07.720 align:start position:0%
I really want to understand this so so
 
03:25:11.550 --> 03:25:11.560 align:start position:0%
so age no longer is a is a consideration
 
03:25:14.349 --> 03:25:14.359 align:start position:0%
so I think representative Le's question
 
03:25:18.590 --> 03:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
the answer I think is is probably yes so
 
03:25:21.349 --> 03:25:21.359 align:start position:0%
now I want to now I want to move forward
 
03:25:24.150 --> 03:25:24.160 align:start position:0%
to a student whose F who lives in
 
03:25:27.710 --> 03:25:27.720 align:start position:0%
Connecticut who attends a a a private
 
03:25:29.429 --> 03:25:29.439 align:start position:0%
school in New Hampshire would they be
 
03:25:31.790 --> 03:25:31.800 align:start position:0%
eligible for this
 
03:25:34.110 --> 03:25:34.120 align:start position:0%
program family lives in
 
03:25:34.120 --> 03:25:36.870 align:start position:0%
program family lives in
Connecticut

03:25:36.870 --> 03:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
Connecticut
 
03:25:40.030 --> 03:25:40.040 align:start position:0%
yeah it's a question not that is not the
 
03:25:43.150 --> 03:25:43.160 align:start position:0%
intention um and if we need to look at
 
03:25:44.870 --> 03:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
that repeal language we
 
03:25:48.469 --> 03:25:48.479 align:start position:0%
will well what's the so is there
 
03:25:50.469 --> 03:25:50.479 align:start position:0%
anything in the in the in the bill that
 
03:25:52.510 --> 03:25:52.520 align:start position:0%
would prevent
 
03:25:56.349 --> 03:25:56.359 align:start position:0%
that um I'll stand by my previous
 
03:26:00.950 --> 03:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
comment okay um all right so I guess my
 
03:26:04.710 --> 03:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
my final comment on this would be for
 
03:26:07.590 --> 03:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
for somebody who when was when they when
 
03:26:09.630 --> 03:26:09.640 align:start position:0%
you were in when they were introducing
 
03:26:12.910 --> 03:26:12.920 align:start position:0%
the amendment talked about the fine
 
03:26:15.510 --> 03:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
attention to detail on statutory
 
03:26:18.550 --> 03:26:18.560 align:start position:0%
references yet left the barn door wide
 
03:26:22.469 --> 03:26:22.479 align:start position:0%
open to anybody to take advantage of
 
03:26:26.429 --> 03:26:26.439 align:start position:0%
this program at any age from any state
 
03:26:30.110 --> 03:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
in any educational setting or not um is
 
03:26:33.469 --> 03:26:33.479 align:start position:0%
just is just frankly
 
03:26:36.510 --> 03:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
unbelievable are there further
 
03:26:39.189 --> 03:26:39.199 align:start position:0%
questions I'm not
 
03:26:44.030 --> 03:26:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:44.040 --> 03:26:45.030 align:start position:0%
 
uh

03:26:45.030 --> 03:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:26:47.150 --> 03:26:47.160 align:start position:0%
late well I was just going to ask are we
 
03:26:48.750 --> 03:26:48.760 align:start position:0%
still on we're on page one yet is that
 
03:26:48.760 --> 03:26:49.550 align:start position:0%
still on we're on page one yet is that
it

03:26:49.550 --> 03:26:49.560 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:26:51.950 --> 03:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
yeah well we're we're just moving
 
03:26:54.750 --> 03:26:54.760 align:start position:0%
through in accordance with uh yeah the
 
03:26:57.469 --> 03:26:57.479 align:start position:0%
request of uh represent Miler so are we
 
03:26:59.630 --> 03:26:59.640 align:start position:0%
done with page one I I have a very
 
03:27:02.950 --> 03:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
simple question which I noncontroversial
 
03:27:06.469 --> 03:27:06.479 align:start position:0%
um at the bottom of page one it
 
03:27:09.750 --> 03:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
references in a definition remote or
 
03:27:12.590 --> 03:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
hybrid um but the doesn't seem to be any
 
03:27:14.309 --> 03:27:14.319 align:start position:0%
further reference to that that I could
 
03:27:16.630 --> 03:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
see in the amendment so I was just
 
03:27:18.550 --> 03:27:18.560 align:start position:0%
wondering why that was in
 
03:27:18.560 --> 03:27:21.309 align:start position:0%
wondering why that was in
there

03:27:21.309 --> 03:27:21.319 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:27:29.750 --> 03:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:34.070 --> 03:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
one that goes back to uh the original uh
 
03:27:36.550 --> 03:27:36.560 align:start position:0%
bill and the definition of an eligible
 
03:27:38.389 --> 03:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
student where we did talk about remote
 
03:27:38.399 --> 03:27:40.309 align:start position:0%
student where we did talk about remote
and

03:27:40.309 --> 03:27:40.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:27:40.319 --> 03:27:42.309 align:start position:0%
and
hybrid

03:27:42.309 --> 03:27:42.319 align:start position:0%
hybrid
 
03:27:46.110 --> 03:27:46.120 align:start position:0%
so okay all right that's
 
03:27:49.110 --> 03:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
questions yes representa
 
03:27:51.750 --> 03:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
MF yeah thank you Mr chair uh still on
 
03:27:53.750 --> 03:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
the subject of eligible students I have
 
03:27:55.670 --> 03:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
a message from another state
 
03:27:58.510 --> 03:27:58.520 align:start position:0%
representative to which is a good good
 
03:28:01.670 --> 03:28:01.680 align:start position:0%
question with regard to a a student who
 
03:28:03.830 --> 03:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
is currently in a hybrid status there
 
03:28:05.309 --> 03:28:05.319 align:start position:0%
are those that are out there who
 
03:28:08.590 --> 03:28:08.600 align:start position:0%
homeschool but they they do one or two
 
03:28:12.150 --> 03:28:12.160 align:start position:0%
classes or whatever so the the question
 
03:28:16.309 --> 03:28:16.319 align:start position:0%
is how is is such a person who's a
 
03:28:18.790 --> 03:28:18.800 align:start position:0%
hybrid student taking one or two classes
 
03:28:21.429 --> 03:28:21.439 align:start position:0%
and doing mostly homeschooling could
 
03:28:23.630 --> 03:28:23.640 align:start position:0%
could they be eligible for this program
 
03:28:25.630 --> 03:28:25.640 align:start position:0%
and and and along with that how would
 
03:28:29.870 --> 03:28:29.880 align:start position:0%
that impact uh you know the the money
 
03:28:33.150 --> 03:28:33.160 align:start position:0%
award and the budget you know the uh you
 
03:28:34.389 --> 03:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
know the money that the school would
 
03:28:34.399 --> 03:28:35.150 align:start position:0%
know the money that the school would
have

03:28:35.150 --> 03:28:35.160 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:28:37.670 --> 03:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
gotten if you're tracking that that
 
03:28:40.510 --> 03:28:40.520 align:start position:0%
situation with a hybrid student right a
 
03:28:42.870 --> 03:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
hybrid student student or student in
 
03:28:46.990 --> 03:28:47.000 align:start position:0%
remote learning um would uh leave their
 
03:28:49.229 --> 03:28:49.239 align:start position:0%
um resident Public School District and
 
03:28:51.269 --> 03:28:51.279 align:start position:0%
sign an agreement for an EFA and become
 
03:28:55.750 --> 03:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
an EFA student oh right and the the
 
03:28:58.229 --> 03:28:58.239 align:start position:0%
question that I think she has and I have
 
03:29:02.150 --> 03:29:02.160 align:start position:0%
as well is how would that impact uh I'm
 
03:29:07.590 --> 03:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
not clear we're not clear on the the the
 
03:29:11.550 --> 03:29:11.560 align:start position:0%
money that that the school gets you know
 
03:29:13.710 --> 03:29:13.720 align:start position:0%
for a full-time student you know from
 
03:29:15.950 --> 03:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
the uh from the
 
03:29:21.030 --> 03:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
state if this student um is a part-time
 
03:29:23.950 --> 03:29:23.960 align:start position:0%
student it's just not clear as to if
 
03:29:26.870 --> 03:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
they go from part-time to full-time EFA
 
03:29:29.110 --> 03:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
how how does that impact there is no
 
03:29:32.070 --> 03:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
part-time EFA or either in one of
 
03:29:34.309 --> 03:29:34.319 align:start position:0%
several categories public school student
 
03:29:36.630 --> 03:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
private school student homeschool or EFA
 
03:29:39.269 --> 03:29:39.279 align:start position:0%
student right so what I'm trying to say
 
03:29:42.150 --> 03:29:42.160 align:start position:0%
it's not I understand the EFA situations
 
03:29:44.229 --> 03:29:44.239 align:start position:0%
not PRI time but if a student is a
 
03:29:46.950 --> 03:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
hybrid student who is has a mixed
 
03:29:49.990 --> 03:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
situation like I said where they are
 
03:29:51.990 --> 03:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
mostly homeschooled but taking some
 
03:29:56.830 --> 03:29:56.840 align:start position:0%
classes it's just not clear on how this
 
03:30:01.030 --> 03:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
would impact the you know the the a you
 
03:30:04.269 --> 03:30:04.279 align:start position:0%
know the awards that that the the
 
03:30:07.550 --> 03:30:07.560 align:start position:0%
monetary awards that go to the uh to the
 
03:30:13.950 --> 03:30:13.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:17.349 --> 03:30:17.359 align:start position:0%
student go ahead repent like this okay
 
03:30:20.070 --> 03:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
this was a question I had um a few
 
03:30:22.830 --> 03:30:22.840 align:start position:0%
months ago and did track down um
 
03:30:25.990 --> 03:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
currently if a student is homeschooled
 
03:30:27.870 --> 03:30:27.880 align:start position:0%
and takes some classes at the high
 
03:30:31.349 --> 03:30:31.359 align:start position:0%
school the state pays a pro-rated amount
 
03:30:35.070 --> 03:30:35.080 align:start position:0%
to that high school if they are in
 
03:30:37.990 --> 03:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
EFA they have all of that state money
 
03:30:41.110 --> 03:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
comes to them in the EFA so if they take
 
03:30:42.910 --> 03:30:42.920 align:start position:0%
some classes at the high school they're
 
03:30:45.990 --> 03:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
required to pay out of their EFA to the
 
03:30:47.750 --> 03:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
high school and that's why it has
 
03:30:50.309 --> 03:30:50.319 align:start position:0%
specifically in here that the state will
 
03:30:51.990 --> 03:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
not pay the high school for those
 
03:30:54.110 --> 03:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
students because the state has already
 
03:30:56.670 --> 03:30:56.680 align:start position:0%
paid the student for those classes so
 
03:30:59.750 --> 03:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:02.030 --> 03:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
dip thank you that clears that up Son
 
03:31:02.040 --> 03:31:02.990 align:start position:0%
dip thank you that clears that up Son
thank

03:31:02.990 --> 03:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:31:07.309 --> 03:31:07.319 align:start position:0%
you on on that point uh Mr chairman I
 
03:31:10.030 --> 03:31:10.040 align:start position:0%
think the issue of payment for part-time
 
03:31:13.910 --> 03:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
students is subject to each school
 
03:31:16.070 --> 03:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
district and the little research that
 
03:31:18.429 --> 03:31:18.439 align:start position:0%
I've done is it seems that there really
 
03:31:25.110 --> 03:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
is um a mixed uh practice of how PE how
 
03:31:27.309 --> 03:31:27.319 align:start position:0%
students who either homeschooled or in
 
03:31:29.790 --> 03:31:29.800 align:start position:0%
this instance would be able to
 
03:31:31.910 --> 03:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
participate in other programs in the
 
03:31:35.910 --> 03:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
school some have some fees frankly most
 
03:31:37.550 --> 03:31:37.560 align:start position:0%
don't have
 
03:31:41.070 --> 03:31:41.080 align:start position:0%
fees we have in statute where if you you
 
03:31:44.349 --> 03:31:44.359 align:start position:0%
are a homeschooling student you have the
 
03:31:47.990 --> 03:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to attend a public school uh
 
03:31:50.110 --> 03:31:50.120 align:start position:0%
and if you attend that one as I've
 
03:31:53.269 --> 03:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
mentioned before that one science course
 
03:31:55.830 --> 03:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
in the high school the high school may
 
03:31:58.910 --> 03:31:58.920 align:start position:0%
be reimbursed depending upon the uh
 
03:32:01.349 --> 03:32:01.359 align:start position:0%
status of funds available here in the
 
03:32:06.830 --> 03:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
state a 0.15 or about 15% of the adma
 
03:32:11.349 --> 03:32:11.359 align:start position:0%
cost for that kid the adequacy cost um
 
03:32:13.469 --> 03:32:13.479 align:start position:0%
and so that that's how we have set that
 
03:32:15.150 --> 03:32:15.160 align:start position:0%
up we have put that in the statute I
 
03:32:16.550 --> 03:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
think you've been a part of it or when
 
03:32:19.950 --> 03:32:19.960 align:start position:0%
we did this um now in terms of a middle
 
03:32:23.309 --> 03:32:23.319 align:start position:0%
school or Elementary School student that
 
03:32:25.870 --> 03:32:25.880 align:start position:0%
is not applicable to that particular
 
03:32:27.750 --> 03:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
statute is not applicable to them seeing
 
03:32:29.550 --> 03:32:29.560 align:start position:0%
that they're not set up by courses
 
03:32:32.110 --> 03:32:32.120 align:start position:0%
they're set up by entire school program
 
03:32:37.670 --> 03:32:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:42.030 --> 03:32:42.040 align:start position:0%
program uh rep representative uh
 
03:32:43.469 --> 03:32:43.479 align:start position:0%
I'm going right across the screen here
 
03:32:45.750 --> 03:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
back and forth with the four of you here
 
03:32:49.110 --> 03:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
um represent LE thank you Mr chairman
 
03:32:51.550 --> 03:32:51.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for indulging uh just to so I
 
03:32:53.429 --> 03:32:53.439 align:start position:0%
I just want to I'm trying to get my head
 
03:32:57.150 --> 03:32:57.160 align:start position:0%
around this so we say that does it say
 
03:32:59.150 --> 03:32:59.160 align:start position:0%
somewhere in this amendment that you you
 
03:33:02.189 --> 03:33:02.199 align:start position:0%
cannot be enrolled in your
 
03:33:05.990 --> 03:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
resident Public School
 
03:33:08.630 --> 03:33:08.640 align:start position:0%
District yes
 
03:33:11.389 --> 03:33:11.399 align:start position:0%
okay but now it seems that if you're
 
03:33:14.870 --> 03:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
less than four 50% you can attend your
 
03:33:17.469 --> 03:33:17.479 align:start position:0%
resident Public School District and be
 
03:33:20.189 --> 03:33:20.199 align:start position:0%
on the EFA is that correct I just want
 
03:33:21.910 --> 03:33:21.920 align:start position:0%
to make sure I understand
 
03:33:25.030 --> 03:33:25.040 align:start position:0%
that no
 
03:33:27.389 --> 03:33:27.399 align:start position:0%
the you're either a public school
 
03:33:31.150 --> 03:33:31.160 align:start position:0%
student or an EFA student but the but an
 
03:33:35.269 --> 03:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
EFA student can sign for work in their
 
03:33:37.229 --> 03:33:37.239 align:start position:0%
resident public school as long as
 
03:33:39.750 --> 03:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
they're doing it for less than 50%
 
03:33:42.030 --> 03:33:42.040 align:start position:0%
because the definition
 
03:33:45.070 --> 03:33:45.080 align:start position:0%
they they can take courses at their
 
03:33:48.870 --> 03:33:48.880 align:start position:0%
public school as a homeschool student
 
03:33:50.950 --> 03:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
currently can as just described by the
 
03:33:53.110 --> 03:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
chairman okay all right thank you I just
 
03:33:54.510 --> 03:33:54.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure I understood thank
 
03:33:58.590 --> 03:33:58.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:01.189 --> 03:34:01.199 align:start position:0%
leas rather than the big goor round that
 
03:34:05.389 --> 03:34:05.399 align:start position:0%
we had earlier yes there was a bit of a
 
03:34:10.830 --> 03:34:10.840 align:start position:0%
mistake in the um repeal part I think
 
03:34:14.389 --> 03:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
the part that was meant to repeal was um
 
03:34:17.750 --> 03:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
not just not just a but I think the
 
03:34:20.269 --> 03:34:20.279 align:start position:0%
second half of a and it just didn't get
 
03:34:24.429 --> 03:34:24.439 align:start position:0%
referenced right um trying to do this we
 
03:34:26.510 --> 03:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
send in one thing we get something else
 
03:34:28.830 --> 03:34:28.840 align:start position:0%
back and so this is frustrating for us
 
03:34:31.550 --> 03:34:31.560 align:start position:0%
too and it didn't it we knew what was
 
03:34:33.150 --> 03:34:33.160 align:start position:0%
supposed to be referenced but that is
 
03:34:35.750 --> 03:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
not what got referenced the idea was the
 
03:34:38.510 --> 03:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
part that was less than or equal to
 
03:34:41.309 --> 03:34:41.319 align:start position:0%
375% is the part that
 
03:34:44.750 --> 03:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
would be repealed but could be looked at
 
03:34:48.630 --> 03:34:48.640 align:start position:0%
before that to say or even repeal it and
 
03:34:50.229 --> 03:34:50.239 align:start position:0%
say well we want a different number
 
03:34:53.510 --> 03:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
there or we don't need it anymore or we
 
03:34:55.830 --> 03:34:55.840 align:start position:0%
or continue it at that point it would be
 
03:34:59.950 --> 03:34:59.960 align:start position:0%
revealed and I mean Ral reviewed and
 
03:35:02.469 --> 03:35:02.479 align:start position:0%
then um figure out what to do the part
 
03:35:04.870 --> 03:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
of eligible to enroll in a public
 
03:35:07.710 --> 03:35:07.720 align:start position:0%
elementary or secondary school was not
 
03:35:10.710 --> 03:35:10.720 align:start position:0%
supposed to be repealed it just when
 
03:35:13.269 --> 03:35:13.279 align:start position:0%
they rewarded it it ended up that way
 
03:35:15.389 --> 03:35:15.399 align:start position:0%
and that is correct that was not uh the
 
03:35:19.590 --> 03:35:19.600 align:start position:0%
way my original submission to uh OS was
 
03:35:22.469 --> 03:35:22.479 align:start position:0%
um drafted I i' just like to explain
 
03:35:23.910 --> 03:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
everybody this is part of the reasons
 
03:35:26.630 --> 03:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
why we're been starting late and trying
 
03:35:28.790 --> 03:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
the amended language which is being sent
 
03:35:32.110 --> 03:35:32.120 align:start position:0%
over is coming back different than what
 
03:35:35.229 --> 03:35:35.239 align:start position:0%
we send and we're trying to catch this I
 
03:35:38.030 --> 03:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
I believe that that service available to
 
03:35:40.710 --> 03:35:40.720 align:start position:0%
us is just on tilt and there they're
 
03:35:42.590 --> 03:35:42.600 align:start position:0%
rushing to get things done due to this
 
03:35:44.750 --> 03:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
darn covid deadline and compressed
 
03:35:46.630 --> 03:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
schedule that we've been had have to
 
03:35:48.790 --> 03:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
work within here going on to
 
03:35:50.389 --> 03:35:50.399 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock you have your
 
03:35:52.870 --> 03:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
hand up also yeah I do thank you and I'm
 
03:35:56.189 --> 03:35:56.199 align:start position:0%
still on page one but that may be your
 
03:36:00.429 --> 03:36:00.439 align:start position:0%
comment Mr chairman just um magnifies
 
03:36:01.910 --> 03:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
the importance of representive Mile's
 
03:36:04.110 --> 03:36:04.120 align:start position:0%
point that this thing is not ready for
 
03:36:06.070 --> 03:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
whatever reason it should be taken at a
 
03:36:08.349 --> 03:36:08.359 align:start position:0%
slower Pace that that's exactly why
 
03:36:10.110 --> 03:36:10.120 align:start position:0%
we're we're walking through this right
 
03:36:11.429 --> 03:36:11.439 align:start position:0%
now walking through it if you're not
 
03:36:12.870 --> 03:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
going to give it a a hearing but in
 
03:36:16.550 --> 03:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
either case Mr chair going back to um
 
03:36:19.070 --> 03:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
the the comment that represent leakas
 
03:36:22.070 --> 03:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
and cordellia made sort of uniform here
 
03:36:23.510 --> 03:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
under eligibility when they're talking
 
03:36:25.110 --> 03:36:25.120 align:start position:0%
about that
 
03:36:27.389 --> 03:36:27.399 align:start position:0%
375% and I think I just heard it say
 
03:36:28.910 --> 03:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
they could be rolled back or increased
 
03:36:32.830 --> 03:36:32.840 align:start position:0%
not increase so that that money of the
 
03:36:34.990 --> 03:36:35.000 align:start position:0%
two family and
 
03:36:38.309 --> 03:36:38.319 align:start position:0%
64,000 or three family $81,000 limit
 
03:36:41.229 --> 03:36:41.239 align:start position:0%
that could be taken out next year uh and
 
03:36:44.070 --> 03:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
repeal that number as you just said and
 
03:36:46.030 --> 03:36:46.040 align:start position:0%
it could be zero so it goes back to the
 
03:36:49.189 --> 03:36:49.199 align:start position:0%
same issue we had last uh I don't know
 
03:36:52.150 --> 03:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
was the packet bill or the cordelan
 
03:36:53.710 --> 03:36:53.720 align:start position:0%

03:36:55.150 --> 03:36:55.160 align:start position:0%
amendment I don't know which amendment
 
03:36:57.309 --> 03:36:57.319 align:start position:0%
it was in there but where talked about
 
03:37:00.710 --> 03:37:00.720 align:start position:0%
the the uh anyone could go any time but
 
03:37:02.670 --> 03:37:02.680 align:start position:0%
I do want to go back and reference again
 
03:37:04.950 --> 03:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
what representative L said that under
 
03:37:08.429 --> 03:37:08.439 align:start position:0%
eligible student I am and and represent
 
03:37:09.790 --> 03:37:09.800 align:start position:0%
Cordell you can stop me if I'm wrong
 
03:37:12.550 --> 03:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
because I would heck wrong on this if I
 
03:37:15.389 --> 03:37:15.399 align:start position:0%
understand this correctly I am 18 years
 
03:37:19.590 --> 03:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
old 19 years old I follow into fall into
 
03:37:22.830 --> 03:37:22.840 align:start position:0%
the not 21 year old category yet I fall
 
03:37:26.150 --> 03:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
into the not homeschool category yet I
 
03:37:27.830 --> 03:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
didn't fall into the not high school
 
03:37:31.550 --> 03:37:31.560 align:start position:0%
graduate category yet and I decide that
 
03:37:34.429 --> 03:37:34.439 align:start position:0%
I want to be an EFA
 
03:37:38.150 --> 03:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
student and I take I sign up and I take
 
03:37:40.630 --> 03:37:40.640 align:start position:0%
courses at your approved School
 
03:37:44.510 --> 03:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
according to uh your approval process
 
03:37:48.070 --> 03:37:48.080 align:start position:0%
and under um if I get this correct here
 
03:37:50.630 --> 03:37:50.640 align:start position:0%
uh the category allows me to take it
 
03:37:52.670 --> 03:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
anywhere any time which should be on
 
03:37:54.349 --> 03:37:54.359 align:start position:0%
page three on the tuition the fees the
 
03:37:54.359 --> 03:37:55.189 align:start position:0%
page three on the tuition the fees the
higher

03:37:55.189 --> 03:37:55.199 align:start position:0%
higher
 
03:37:58.429 --> 03:37:58.439 align:start position:0%
education so if I'm on page three going
 
03:38:00.229 --> 03:38:00.239 align:start position:0%
back to eligibility of page one I'm on
 
03:38:03.990 --> 03:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
page three line four so you're with me
 
03:38:06.830 --> 03:38:06.840 align:start position:0%
page three line four represent Celli I'm
 
03:38:09.349 --> 03:38:09.359 align:start position:0%

College High School college program that
 
03:38:37.710 --> 03:38:37.720 align:start position:0%

if I play my cards right here I can go
 
03:38:43.269 --> 03:38:43.279 align:start position:0%
to College on public school money
 
03:38:44.670 --> 03:38:44.680 align:start position:0%
without ever getting a high school
 
03:38:46.349 --> 03:38:46.359 align:start position:0%
diploma until I get enough credits back
 
03:38:51.429 --> 03:38:51.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:55.590 --> 03:38:55.600 align:start position:0%
says the um that's a yes or
 
03:38:58.189 --> 03:38:58.199 align:start position:0%
no I'm sorry I I'll choose the answer
 
03:39:01.110 --> 03:39:01.120 align:start position:0%
the question uh without dictate as to
 
03:39:04.790 --> 03:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
how I answer it um the
 
03:39:09.229 --> 03:39:09.239 align:start position:0%
uh the system currently has uh dual
 
03:39:13.150 --> 03:39:13.160 align:start position:0%
enrollment um running start all kinds of
 
03:39:16.110 --> 03:39:16.120 align:start position:0%
um abilities for Current public school
 
03:39:18.830 --> 03:39:18.840 align:start position:0%

careeres uh various opportunities um and
 
03:39:24.469 --> 03:39:24.479 align:start position:0%
it would be no different uh for an EFA
 
03:39:27.309 --> 03:39:27.319 align:start position:0%
student so if I may follow up then so
 
03:39:29.910 --> 03:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
the answer is yes I could not graduate
 
03:39:32.750 --> 03:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
from high school Bel to an es become an
 
03:39:36.150 --> 03:39:36.160 align:start position:0%

03:40:10.870 --> 03:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
number one we've done page one
 
03:40:12.469 --> 03:40:12.479 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock I'm having a
 
03:40:13.870 --> 03:40:13.880 align:start position:0%
hard time understanding where you're
 
03:40:15.910 --> 03:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
going under I'm just trying I'm trying
 
03:40:18.309 --> 03:40:18.319 align:start position:0%
to get page one eligibility Mr CH you
 
03:40:20.389 --> 03:40:20.399 align:start position:0%
said you a page one and I keep on
 
03:40:21.790 --> 03:40:21.800 align:start position:0%
hearing different answers about
 
03:40:23.030 --> 03:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
different questions that's all so I'm
 
03:40:24.269 --> 03:40:24.279 align:start position:0%
trying to get try to get some
 
03:40:25.630 --> 03:40:25.640 align:start position:0%
clarification understanding of
 
03:40:28.030 --> 03:40:28.040 align:start position:0%
concurrent and dual enrollment a student
 
03:40:31.150 --> 03:40:31.160 align:start position:0%
can take uh those courses while they're
 
03:40:33.189 --> 03:40:33.199 align:start position:0%
in high school leading towards their
 
03:40:35.309 --> 03:40:35.319 align:start position:0%
graduation but they can also take
 
03:40:37.710 --> 03:40:37.720 align:start position:0%
courses which build up and they will
 
03:40:39.670 --> 03:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
receive credit for those when they are
 
03:40:43.189 --> 03:40:43.199 align:start position:0%
going to College upon graduation
 
03:40:45.790 --> 03:40:45.800 align:start position:0%
I representative chairman lad I
 
03:40:47.429 --> 03:40:47.439 align:start position:0%
understand that but I wasn't asking
 
03:40:49.070 --> 03:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
about dual enrollment I wasn't asking
 
03:40:51.030 --> 03:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
about running start I was asking
 
03:40:54.389 --> 03:40:54.399 align:start position:0%
specifically in this program as an Esa
 
03:40:57.189 --> 03:40:57.199 align:start position:0%
student if I could take college courses
 
03:41:00.030 --> 03:41:00.040 align:start position:0%
at 19 years old having not graduated
 
03:41:02.269 --> 03:41:02.279 align:start position:0%
from high school I want to be an Esa
 
03:41:04.710 --> 03:41:04.720 align:start position:0%
student so I go there and earn college
 
03:41:06.950 --> 03:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
credits which I will eventually send
 
03:41:09.070 --> 03:41:09.080 align:start position:0%
back to the high school um and so I
 
03:41:11.710 --> 03:41:11.720 align:start position:0%
could get one or two years of my college
 
03:41:14.790 --> 03:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
education paid for by this program that
 
03:41:17.429 --> 03:41:17.439 align:start position:0%
was the question thank
 
03:41:20.150 --> 03:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
you on that on that point I think one of
 
03:41:21.750 --> 03:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
the reasons why we're concerned about
 
03:41:24.189 --> 03:41:24.199 align:start position:0%
that Mr chairman is that in the
 
03:41:27.349 --> 03:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
governor's current program in his
 
03:41:31.149 --> 03:41:31.159 align:start position:0%
proposed uh project he has basically cut
 
03:41:33.750 --> 03:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
money out for dual and concurrent
 
03:41:35.710 --> 03:41:35.720 align:start position:0%
programs so that's a concern that we
 
03:41:38.149 --> 03:41:38.159 align:start position:0%
have here thank you thank you represent
 
03:41:40.710 --> 03:41:40.720 align:start position:0%
Leon um thank you Mr chair here I'm
 
03:41:42.510 --> 03:41:42.520 align:start position:0%
trying to understand this question are
 
03:41:44.389 --> 03:41:44.399 align:start position:0%
you talking about students who don't
 
03:41:47.309 --> 03:41:47.319 align:start position:0%
have a high school diploma enrolling at
 
03:41:50.309 --> 03:41:50.319 align:start position:0%
High um at some of the higher education
 
03:41:52.429 --> 03:41:52.439 align:start position:0%
higher educational institutions that
 
03:41:54.229 --> 03:41:54.239 align:start position:0%
don't accept students that haven't yet
 
03:41:58.990 --> 03:41:59.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:01.590 --> 03:42:01.600 align:start position:0%
school who's
 
03:42:03.950 --> 03:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
reting rep
 
03:42:06.469 --> 03:42:06.479 align:start position:0%
Le U I'm sorry I sort of dropped down
 
03:42:08.950 --> 03:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
back in up but no um schools will accept
 
03:42:11.510 --> 03:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
at times um I know my University had
 
03:42:14.429 --> 03:42:14.439 align:start position:0%
accepts students from Conan High School
 
03:42:16.229 --> 03:42:16.239 align:start position:0%
um and there's no you know there's a
 
03:42:18.189 --> 03:42:18.199 align:start position:0%
maybe a local Arrangement um and I think
 
03:42:21.030 --> 03:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
the students have to pay to some extent
 
03:42:24.349 --> 03:42:24.359 align:start position:0%
um but um they do allow that um and I
 
03:42:25.710 --> 03:42:25.720 align:start position:0%
know of students who have actually been
 
03:42:27.469 --> 03:42:27.479 align:start position:0%
accepted without having graduated high
 
03:42:31.030 --> 03:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
school um it does happen I mean not
 
03:42:33.830 --> 03:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
often but it does happen um I do know
 
03:42:36.510 --> 03:42:36.520 align:start position:0%
that my institution MIT does provide
 
03:42:38.269 --> 03:42:38.279 align:start position:0%
education to younger students but it's
 
03:42:40.510 --> 03:42:40.520 align:start position:0%
not on a credit basis and anybody who's
 
03:42:43.229 --> 03:42:43.239 align:start position:0%
been accepted is conditional upon High
 
03:42:44.990 --> 03:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
School graduation to actually enroll and
 
03:42:46.830 --> 03:42:46.840 align:start position:0%
get those credits so I guess I don't
 
03:42:48.229 --> 03:42:48.239 align:start position:0%
quite understand the concern when it's
 
03:42:49.870 --> 03:42:49.880 align:start position:0%
already set up for community colleges
 
03:42:51.349 --> 03:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
and other schools where you can get that
 
03:42:52.950 --> 03:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
running start and I think we're
 
03:42:55.590 --> 03:42:55.600 align:start position:0%
conflating two different issues here
 
03:42:58.349 --> 03:42:58.359 align:start position:0%
okay I'd like to move on now to uh
 
03:43:00.710 --> 03:43:00.720 align:start position:0%
another point we we we've hammered on
 
03:43:04.349 --> 03:43:04.359 align:start position:0%
this one uh can are we still on page one
 
03:43:06.510 --> 03:43:06.520 align:start position:0%
or are we ready to move
 
03:43:11.830 --> 03:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
on page two page two good
 
03:43:15.429 --> 03:43:15.439 align:start position:0%
making progress I've got a question we
 
03:43:19.550 --> 03:43:19.560 align:start position:0%
know you do go ahead okay my question is
 
03:43:23.870 --> 03:43:23.880 align:start position:0%
and it's a simple one um once the once
 
03:43:23.880 --> 03:43:25.070 align:start position:0%
and it's a simple one um once the once
the

03:43:25.070 --> 03:43:25.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:43:28.630 --> 03:43:28.640 align:start position:0%
distribution of the grant Mel what line
 
03:43:31.349 --> 03:43:31.359 align:start position:0%
are are you on right now I'm sorry I'm
 
03:43:33.349 --> 03:43:33.359 align:start position:0%
looking on line
 
03:43:38.590 --> 03:43:38.600 align:start position:0%
13 okay once the transfer of the grant
 
03:43:41.830 --> 03:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
is made the the the parent has been
 
03:43:45.510 --> 03:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
accepted uh and uh the grant has been
 
03:43:49.110 --> 03:43:49.120 align:start position:0%
given to the uh scholarship
 
03:43:52.670 --> 03:43:52.680 align:start position:0%
organization at that point in time it's
 
03:43:57.269 --> 03:43:57.279 align:start position:0%
my understanding that the state of New
 
03:44:01.030 --> 03:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has no other obligation to
 
03:44:04.229 --> 03:44:04.239 align:start position:0%
ensure that the student is getting an
 
03:44:07.990 --> 03:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:11.110 --> 03:44:11.120 align:start position:0%
correct uh the go
 
03:44:14.710 --> 03:44:14.720 align:start position:0%
ahead payments are made on a quarterly
 
03:44:18.510 --> 03:44:18.520 align:start position:0%
basis um as you'll see in
 
03:44:18.520 --> 03:44:20.349 align:start position:0%
basis um as you'll see in
19842

03:44:20.349 --> 03:44:20.359 align:start position:0%
19842
 
03:44:24.910 --> 03:44:24.920 align:start position:0%
um the uh progress of a student is
 
03:44:26.389 --> 03:44:26.399 align:start position:0%
monitored by the scholarship
 
03:44:28.349 --> 03:44:28.359 align:start position:0%
organization and we have added the
 
03:44:30.670 --> 03:44:30.680 align:start position:0%
accountability measures um that we
 
03:44:33.990 --> 03:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
talked about previously based on um what
 
03:44:36.389 --> 03:44:36.399 align:start position:0%
we heard at the public
 
03:44:39.229 --> 03:44:39.239 align:start position:0%
hearings yeah my so my so the answer to
 
03:44:43.110 --> 03:44:43.120 align:start position:0%
your question is is I would assume is no
 
03:44:45.149 --> 03:44:45.159 align:start position:0%
the department has no further
 
03:44:47.269 --> 03:44:47.279 align:start position:0%
responsibility it really shifts that
 
03:44:50.469 --> 03:44:50.479 align:start position:0%
responsibility then to the scholarship
 
03:44:52.710 --> 03:44:52.720 align:start position:0%
organization representative Miler this
 
03:44:54.790 --> 03:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
is very similar to a homeschooling
 
03:44:57.189 --> 03:44:57.199 align:start position:0%
student only this is a different leg of
 
03:45:00.630 --> 03:45:00.640 align:start position:0%
the stool it's the fourth leg the EFA so
 
03:45:04.349 --> 03:45:04.359 align:start position:0%
now the student is now uh complying with
 
03:45:07.030 --> 03:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
compulsory attendance requirements and
 
03:45:10.070 --> 03:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
within the EFA statute you see here the
 
03:45:14.149 --> 03:45:14.159 align:start position:0%
bill that student is now responsible for
 
03:45:17.630 --> 03:45:17.640 align:start position:0%
submitting progress a portfolio progress
 
03:45:21.830 --> 03:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
report um standardized uh Norm reference
 
03:45:24.750 --> 03:45:24.760 align:start position:0%
standardized assessment data to the
 
03:45:27.149 --> 03:45:27.159 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization which is then
 
03:45:30.750 --> 03:45:30.760 align:start position:0%
aggregated and sent on to Department of
 
03:45:32.830 --> 03:45:32.840 align:start position:0%
Education so the answer to my question
 
03:45:32.840 --> 03:45:34.950 align:start position:0%
Education so the answer to my question
is

03:45:34.950 --> 03:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:45:37.710 --> 03:45:37.720 align:start position:0%
yes because the department all the
 
03:45:39.149 --> 03:45:39.159 align:start position:0%
department does is just receive the
 
03:45:39.159 --> 03:45:40.429 align:start position:0%
department does is just receive the
information

03:45:40.429 --> 03:45:40.439 align:start position:0%
information
 
03:45:42.030 --> 03:45:42.040 align:start position:0%
but it's it's my understanding correct
 
03:45:44.070 --> 03:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
me if I'm wrong it is a scholarship
 
03:45:45.990 --> 03:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
organization that's
 
03:45:48.790 --> 03:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
responsible for the continuity of the
 
03:45:52.750 --> 03:45:52.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:55.229 --> 03:45:55.239 align:start position:0%
student I think it's also backing off
 
03:45:57.229 --> 03:45:57.239 align:start position:0%
where the parent is responsible and the
 
03:45:59.870 --> 03:45:59.880 align:start position:0%
student is responsible obviously but I'm
 
03:46:02.630 --> 03:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
talking from an Institutional standpoint
 
03:46:04.229 --> 03:46:04.239 align:start position:0%
because I'm concerned about making sure
 
03:46:06.030 --> 03:46:06.040 align:start position:0%
that there is that adequate education
 
03:46:08.149 --> 03:46:08.159 align:start position:0%
being given and I'm just saying the
 
03:46:11.269 --> 03:46:11.279 align:start position:0%
person who's responsible the clearly is
 
03:46:13.630 --> 03:46:13.640 align:start position:0%
but the institution that monitors this
 
03:46:16.429 --> 03:46:16.439 align:start position:0%
that grants the fees to the respective
 
03:46:19.870 --> 03:46:19.880 align:start position:0%
education service provider is in fact
 
03:46:22.110 --> 03:46:22.120 align:start position:0%
the scholarship organization that's I
 
03:46:24.269 --> 03:46:24.279 align:start position:0%
just yeah I understand what you're
 
03:46:25.990 --> 03:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
saying but I really don't see much
 
03:46:28.510 --> 03:46:28.520 align:start position:0%
difference between this process and that
 
03:46:31.229 --> 03:46:31.239 align:start position:0%
of homeschooling homeschooling you have
 
03:46:33.990 --> 03:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
the same requirements in terms of the
 
03:46:36.630 --> 03:46:36.640 align:start position:0%
assessment accountability side of things
 
03:46:38.309 --> 03:46:38.319 align:start position:0%
and yet we're seeing amongst our
 
03:46:41.349 --> 03:46:41.359 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers very very high achievement
 
03:46:45.189 --> 03:46:45.199 align:start position:0%
rates so it's a program that is working
 
03:46:47.429 --> 03:46:47.439 align:start position:0%
and I see no reason why this program set
 
03:46:49.510 --> 03:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
up in a very similar manner wouldn't
 
03:46:51.670 --> 03:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
work either yeah again I'm not talking
 
03:46:53.870 --> 03:46:53.880 align:start position:0%
about quality the question is it's
 
03:46:56.710 --> 03:46:56.720 align:start position:0%
either yes or no who's responsible for
 
03:46:59.269 --> 03:46:59.279 align:start position:0%
that child and I assume my assumption
 
03:47:01.790 --> 03:47:01.800 align:start position:0%
reading this is that it is in fact on a
 
03:47:04.149 --> 03:47:04.159 align:start position:0%
primary standpoint it is a scholarship
 
03:47:08.510 --> 03:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:10.910 --> 03:47:10.920 align:start position:0%
Education go ahead I I think there is
 
03:47:14.710 --> 03:47:14.720 align:start position:0%
also the question um are we looking at
 
03:47:17.309 --> 03:47:17.319 align:start position:0%
uh education through the lens of
 
03:47:19.269 --> 03:47:19.279 align:start position:0%
government control of a student's
 
03:47:21.990 --> 03:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
education or parental control of
 
03:47:24.429 --> 03:47:24.439 align:start position:0%
student's education I think we have to
 
03:47:28.269 --> 03:47:28.279 align:start position:0%
put parents back in their proper place
 
03:47:30.590 --> 03:47:30.600 align:start position:0%
um in uh the education of their children
 
03:47:30.600 --> 03:47:32.710 align:start position:0%
um in uh the education of their children
as

03:47:32.710 --> 03:47:32.720 align:start position:0%
as
 
03:47:35.349 --> 03:47:35.359 align:start position:0%
well I don't I don't debate the role of
 
03:47:38.830 --> 03:47:38.840 align:start position:0%
parents very key I'm just thinking the
 
03:47:42.429 --> 03:47:42.439 align:start position:0%
institution who's responsible for the
 
03:47:42.439 --> 03:47:43.830 align:start position:0%
institution who's responsible for the
taxpayer

03:47:43.830 --> 03:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
taxpayer
 
03:47:45.990 --> 03:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
dollars making sure there's an adequate
 
03:47:47.950 --> 03:47:47.960 align:start position:0%
education so I'll answer the question
 
03:47:50.429 --> 03:47:50.439 align:start position:0%
for me it's the scholarship organization
 
03:47:52.189 --> 03:47:52.199 align:start position:0%
thank you and we can move
 
03:47:55.269 --> 03:47:55.279 align:start position:0%
on thank you uh reps and Woodcock I see
 
03:47:59.910 --> 03:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
you have your hand up yes sir thank you
 
03:48:04.630 --> 03:48:04.640 align:start position:0%
um question if I may on line 15 of the
 
03:48:08.830 --> 03:48:08.840 align:start position:0%
alled lad Amendment it wasn't in the
 
03:48:10.110 --> 03:48:10.120 align:start position:0%
packet Amendment minute but it was in
 
03:48:13.670 --> 03:48:13.680 align:start position:0%

03:48:17.189 --> 03:48:17.199 align:start position:0%
approved private school can you tell me
 
03:48:19.630 --> 03:48:19.640 align:start position:0%
what that means approve private school
 
03:48:22.510 --> 03:48:22.520 align:start position:0%
who does the approving the Department of
 
03:48:26.710 --> 03:48:26.720 align:start position:0%
Education so to follow up to that if I
 
03:48:26.720 --> 03:48:27.870 align:start position:0%
Education so to follow up to that if I
am

03:48:27.870 --> 03:48:27.880 align:start position:0%
am
 
03:48:31.950 --> 03:48:31.960 align:start position:0%
uh uh Steve woodcock's Elementary School
 
03:48:33.510 --> 03:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
for Esa
 
03:48:35.429 --> 03:48:35.439 align:start position:0%
students uh and
 
03:48:38.389 --> 03:48:38.399 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers they could not come to my
 
03:48:40.389 --> 03:48:40.399 align:start position:0%
school are you approved by the
 
03:48:42.790 --> 03:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
Department of Education um I think that
 
03:48:45.710 --> 03:48:45.720 align:start position:0%
also goes to the uh uh informational
 
03:48:48.790 --> 03:48:48.800 align:start position:0%
session a few weeks ago where a former
 
03:48:51.349 --> 03:48:51.359 align:start position:0%
legislator was concerned about uh
 
03:48:54.030 --> 03:48:54.040 align:start position:0%
students with an EFA going to schools of
 
03:48:56.870 --> 03:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
terrorism I think it's a a similarly
 
03:49:00.349 --> 03:49:00.359 align:start position:0%
ridiculous situation or ridiculous
 
03:49:03.030 --> 03:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
question well if I may Mr chairman this
 
03:49:04.990 --> 03:49:05.000 align:start position:0%
was it wasn't anything about terrorism
 
03:49:08.510 --> 03:49:08.520 align:start position:0%
no ridiculous uh this is ridiculous in
 
03:49:10.790 --> 03:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
my mind but beond that if I am a
 
03:49:12.309 --> 03:49:12.319 align:start position:0%
religious school in the state of New
 
03:49:14.229 --> 03:49:14.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire do I have to be approved by
 
03:49:16.870 --> 03:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education Mr quelli I
 
03:49:18.830 --> 03:49:18.840 align:start position:0%

03:49:23.110 --> 03:49:23.120 align:start position:0%
school is that a yes it's all that
 
03:49:24.630 --> 03:49:24.640 align:start position:0%
information and the list of schools is
 
03:49:26.710 --> 03:49:26.720 align:start position:0%
on the department website available for
 
03:49:28.389 --> 03:49:28.399 align:start position:0%
everyone I know what schools that were
 
03:49:31.950 --> 03:49:31.960 align:start position:0%
on the site thank you not all there that
 
03:49:33.469 --> 03:49:33.479 align:start position:0%
should answer your question then are
 
03:49:36.189 --> 03:49:36.199 align:start position:0%
there any other questions on page
 
03:49:40.189 --> 03:49:40.199 align:start position:0%
two not seeing any hands One More Mr
 
03:49:45.630 --> 03:49:45.640 align:start position:0%
chairman go ahead thank you on line
 
03:49:49.710 --> 03:49:49.720 align:start position:0%
35 it talks 35 on page two of the uh lad
 
03:49:53.910 --> 03:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
allot Amendment it talks about summer
 
03:49:53.920 --> 03:49:56.590 align:start position:0%
allot Amendment it talks about summer
educational

03:49:56.590 --> 03:49:56.600 align:start position:0%
educational
 
03:50:01.870 --> 03:50:01.880 align:start position:0%
programs so if I am going to take a stem
 
03:50:06.750 --> 03:50:06.760 align:start position:0%
class uh Esa would pay for that for my
 
03:50:11.349 --> 03:50:11.359 align:start position:0%
child it's educational program is that
 
03:50:14.189 --> 03:50:14.199 align:start position:0%
correct I would think so if I am going
 
03:50:17.710 --> 03:50:17.720 align:start position:0%
to take a swimming instructional program
 
03:50:20.550 --> 03:50:20.560 align:start position:0%
under the guys of physical education
 
03:50:25.469 --> 03:50:25.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:30.030 --> 03:50:30.040 align:start position:0%
that it it might be in the context of uh
 
03:50:32.750 --> 03:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
what that uh class is if it's just a a
 
03:50:35.630 --> 03:50:35.640 align:start position:0%
swimming class um I'm not sure if that
 
03:50:38.389 --> 03:50:38.399 align:start position:0%
would qualify if I am going to take an
 
03:50:41.110 --> 03:50:41.120 align:start position:0%
advanced athle atic competition class to
 
03:50:43.750 --> 03:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
improve my skills would that fit under
 
03:50:45.710 --> 03:50:45.720 align:start position:0%
that category as someone would do in
 
03:50:47.950 --> 03:50:47.960 align:start position:0%
high school possibly no I'm talking
 
03:50:50.309 --> 03:50:50.319 align:start position:0%
about summer summer school well as
 
03:50:52.750 --> 03:50:52.760 align:start position:0%
someone in high school would do an
 
03:50:56.590 --> 03:50:56.600 align:start position:0%
advanced physical uh um program um I
 
03:50:58.550 --> 03:50:58.560 align:start position:0%
would imagine uh would be available
 
03:51:00.750 --> 03:51:00.760 align:start position:0%
through a high school that would also be
 
03:51:04.030 --> 03:51:04.040 align:start position:0%
available through the EFA so that means
 
03:51:06.070 --> 03:51:06.080 align:start position:0%
basically I could go to summer camp
 
03:51:08.149 --> 03:51:08.159 align:start position:0%
athletic Camp basketball camp I know
 
03:51:10.389 --> 03:51:10.399 align:start position:0%
what you're saying and pay for that
 
03:51:12.830 --> 03:51:12.840 align:start position:0%
under out of line 35 under summer
 
03:51:14.870 --> 03:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
educational program ESI that's fine I'm
 
03:51:16.990 --> 03:51:17.000 align:start position:0%

03:51:56.550 --> 03:51:56.560 align:start position:0%
question is the um the um per pupil
 
03:52:01.110 --> 03:52:01.120 align:start position:0%
adequate education grant pursuant to
 
03:52:04.750 --> 03:52:04.760 align:start position:0%
1984a which I know is subject of of a
 
03:52:06.510 --> 03:52:06.520 align:start position:0%
lot of other bills right now including
 
03:52:08.510 --> 03:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
House Bill 608 which I think we're going
 
03:52:10.950 --> 03:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
to talk about later and the specific
 
03:52:14.309 --> 03:52:14.319 align:start position:0%
question is how do you I guess how do
 
03:52:18.950 --> 03:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
you consider the um um that that in um
 
03:52:21.710 --> 03:52:21.720 align:start position:0%
in House Bill 608 specifically that that
 
03:52:24.830 --> 03:52:24.840 align:start position:0%
amount of money includes um free and
 
03:52:27.429 --> 03:52:27.439 align:start position:0%
reduce price lunch Equitable Grant
 
03:52:30.469 --> 03:52:30.479 align:start position:0%
dollars that are not student specific
 
03:52:33.469 --> 03:52:33.479 align:start position:0%
but are specific to the school district
 
03:52:38.030 --> 03:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:38.040 --> 03:52:39.990 align:start position:0%
 
attends

03:52:39.990 --> 03:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
attends
 
03:52:42.950 --> 03:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
currently uh the Department of Education
 
03:52:45.429 --> 03:52:45.439 align:start position:0%
communicates to the treasur uh the
 
03:52:48.670 --> 03:52:48.680 align:start position:0%
amount uh to be sent to school districts
 
03:52:51.389 --> 03:52:51.399 align:start position:0%
it would be no different for uh the
 
03:52:53.750 --> 03:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
transfer to a scholarship
 
03:52:58.269 --> 03:52:58.279 align:start position:0%
organization and um currently uh the
 
03:53:02.590 --> 03:53:02.600 align:start position:0%
adequacy uh Grant um formula includes
 
03:53:05.429 --> 03:53:05.439 align:start position:0%
the base adequacy amount plus the uh
 
03:53:07.990 --> 03:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid uh categories that
 
03:53:11.389 --> 03:53:11.399 align:start position:0%
are in uh statute right
 
03:53:13.870 --> 03:53:13.880 align:start position:0%
now we're only dealing with what is in
 
03:53:16.550 --> 03:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
statute now not what is proposed
 
03:53:19.990 --> 03:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
language that minor uh might not be
 
03:53:22.870 --> 03:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
signed into law okay so followup quick
 
03:53:25.429 --> 03:53:25.439 align:start position:0%
followup so I'm sure then you're aware
 
03:53:26.870 --> 03:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
that in
 
03:53:30.670 --> 03:53:30.680 align:start position:0%
19839 the um uh monies from such fund so
 
03:53:32.550 --> 03:53:32.560 align:start position:0%
this is the statute that establishes the

than to distribute adequate education
 
03:53:38.680 --> 03:53:39.469 align:start position:0%
than to distribute adequate education

03:53:56.229 --> 03:53:56.239 align:start position:0%
actually have to jump off to and talk um
 
03:53:57.990 --> 03:53:58.000 align:start position:0%

03:54:07.389 --> 03:54:07.399 align:start position:0%
just saying all right
 
03:54:10.070 --> 03:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
yeah further
 
03:54:12.189 --> 03:54:12.199 align:start position:0%
comments okay
 
03:54:15.070 --> 03:54:15.080 align:start position:0%
um we're going to move on to page three
 
03:54:17.950 --> 03:54:17.960 align:start position:0%
now we have some business to do today so
 
03:54:17.960 --> 03:54:22.590 align:start position:0%
now we have some business to do today so
page

03:54:22.590 --> 03:54:22.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:27.149 --> 03:54:27.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:31.389 --> 03:54:31.399 align:start position:0%
chair yes go ahead on line
 
03:54:34.189 --> 03:54:34.199 align:start position:0%
17 it talks
 
03:54:38.870 --> 03:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
about that the uh the depos the the fun
 
03:54:41.830 --> 03:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
funds from the uh e
 
03:54:46.110 --> 03:54:46.120 align:start position:0%
EFA uh are not taxable income according
 
03:54:48.229 --> 03:54:48.239 align:start position:0%
with the IRS didn't we when we were
 
03:54:50.710 --> 03:54:50.720 align:start position:0%
dealing with this question before didn't
 
03:54:53.830 --> 03:54:53.840 align:start position:0%
we just determine that state
 
03:54:58.950 --> 03:54:58.960 align:start position:0%
law does not uh does not
 
03:55:02.030 --> 03:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
predispose IRS regulations that in fact
 
03:55:03.070 --> 03:55:03.080 align:start position:0%
it's the
 
03:55:05.830 --> 03:55:05.840 align:start position:0%
IRS that is the one who determines what
 
03:55:08.950 --> 03:55:08.960 align:start position:0%
is taxable income am I incorrect In
 
03:55:10.389 --> 03:55:10.399 align:start position:0%
remembering that when we deal dealt with
 
03:55:11.830 --> 03:55:11.840 align:start position:0%
this issue
 
03:55:14.950 --> 03:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
before uh I do not recall that
 
03:55:17.389 --> 03:55:17.399 align:start position:0%
conversation previously but uh this
 
03:55:20.950 --> 03:55:20.960 align:start position:0%
information uh this um language has been
 
03:55:23.389 --> 03:55:23.399 align:start position:0%
Incorporated uh in other states in
 
03:55:26.189 --> 03:55:26.199 align:start position:0%
similar programs without any uh
 
03:55:33.110 --> 03:55:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:37.830 --> 03:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
you uh another question please on um
 
03:55:37.840 --> 03:55:40.030 align:start position:0%
you uh another question please on um
online

03:55:40.030 --> 03:55:40.040 align:start position:0%
online
 
03:55:44.349 --> 03:55:44.359 align:start position:0%
24 of Page Three it reads nothing in
 
03:55:46.389 --> 03:55:46.399 align:start position:0%
this chapter shall be construed to
 
03:55:49.070 --> 03:55:49.080 align:start position:0%
require an EFA student to be enrolled
 
03:55:52.070 --> 03:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
full or part-time in either a private
 
03:55:54.149 --> 03:55:54.159 align:start position:0%
school or
 
03:55:56.910 --> 03:55:56.920 align:start position:0%
nonpublic online
 
03:55:56.920 --> 03:55:58.510 align:start position:0%
nonpublic online
school

03:55:58.510 --> 03:55:58.520 align:start position:0%
school
 
03:56:01.590 --> 03:56:01.600 align:start position:0%
so I need a clarification what does
 
03:56:03.790 --> 03:56:03.800 align:start position:0%
what's that mean from a standpoint of a
 
03:56:05.950 --> 03:56:05.960 align:start position:0%
child who is not going to be in a
 
03:56:09.870 --> 03:56:09.880 align:start position:0%
private school or a non-online school uh
 
03:56:12.229 --> 03:56:12.239 align:start position:0%
what what is the options for a student
 
03:56:15.030 --> 03:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
at that point in time a totalized
 
03:56:19.189 --> 03:56:19.199 align:start position:0%
totally customized education um mapped
 
03:56:21.710 --> 03:56:21.720 align:start position:0%
out uh by their parents and others in
 
03:56:26.830 --> 03:56:26.840 align:start position:0%
terms of uh uh online courses uh tutors
 
03:56:31.590 --> 03:56:31.600 align:start position:0%
um it could be a uh teacher at a small
 
03:56:33.469 --> 03:56:33.479 align:start position:0%
group instruction it could be a
 
03:56:36.429 --> 03:56:36.439 align:start position:0%
homeschool Co-op uh whatever are
 
03:56:39.670 --> 03:56:39.680 align:start position:0%
allowable expenses uh
 
03:56:41.990 --> 03:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
um that would cover uh the education of
 
03:56:46.269 --> 03:56:46.279 align:start position:0%
a child um to best meet their needs so
 
03:56:48.349 --> 03:56:48.359 align:start position:0%
so on that point then representative
 
03:56:51.030 --> 03:56:51.040 align:start position:0%
cordelli a person who has that kind of a
 
03:56:53.389 --> 03:56:53.399 align:start position:0%
program that you just defined I would
 
03:56:55.389 --> 03:56:55.399 align:start position:0%
assume when they reach the age of
 
03:56:58.550 --> 03:56:58.560 align:start position:0%
matriculation age 18 they would not have
 
03:57:03.550 --> 03:57:03.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:07.590 --> 03:57:07.600 align:start position:0%
correct that could be the case thank
 
03:57:07.600 --> 03:57:10.830 align:start position:0%
correct that could be the case thank
you

03:57:10.830 --> 03:57:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:13.550 --> 03:57:13.560 align:start position:0%
yes representative lakus there are a lot
 
03:57:15.189 --> 03:57:15.199 align:start position:0%
of accrediting
 
03:57:17.830 --> 03:57:17.840 align:start position:0%
organizations um both in the state and
 
03:57:19.510 --> 03:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
nationally and there are a lot of
 
03:57:21.870 --> 03:57:21.880 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers who want actually
 
03:57:23.830 --> 03:57:23.840 align:start position:0%
accreditation for the classes that they
 
03:57:25.550 --> 03:57:25.560 align:start position:0%
have and so they work through those
 
03:57:29.149 --> 03:57:29.159 align:start position:0%
organizations they have to turn in
 
03:57:31.429 --> 03:57:31.439 align:start position:0%
whatever paperwork Etc that that
 
03:57:34.790 --> 03:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
organization wants and so a person could
 
03:57:38.790 --> 03:57:38.800 align:start position:0%
come out with a high school uh diploma
 
03:57:40.229 --> 03:57:40.239 align:start position:0%
from one of those accrediting
 
03:57:43.510 --> 03:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
organizations that exist
 
03:57:47.309 --> 03:57:47.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:50.550 --> 03:57:50.560 align:start position:0%
you uh representative Le thank you thank
 
03:57:52.070 --> 03:57:52.080 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for taking the
 
03:57:55.429 --> 03:57:55.439 align:start position:0%
questions um just a real quick one on um
 
03:57:57.149 --> 03:57:57.159 align:start position:0%
near the top of the page fees for
 
03:57:59.790 --> 03:57:59.800 align:start position:0%
transportation paid to a fee for service
 
03:58:02.189 --> 03:58:02.199 align:start position:0%
Transportation provider again if I set
 
03:58:05.790 --> 03:58:05.800 align:start position:0%
up my own uh company to do such a thing
 
03:58:09.269 --> 03:58:09.279 align:start position:0%
can I pay myself to transport my child
 
03:58:13.630 --> 03:58:13.640 align:start position:0%
I I doubt whether the uh uh that kind of
 
03:58:16.389 --> 03:58:16.399 align:start position:0%
situation would be approved uh depending
 
03:58:19.510 --> 03:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
on the situation uh public schools now
 
03:58:23.550 --> 03:58:23.560 align:start position:0%
uh pay parents to uh transport their own
 
03:58:26.309 --> 03:58:26.319 align:start position:0%
children okay so it could happen Okay
 
03:58:29.030 --> 03:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
and then um further down on the page and
 
03:58:30.950 --> 03:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm looking at the uh uh
 
03:58:32.389 --> 03:58:32.399 align:start position:0%
earlier Amendment so I don't have the
 
03:58:34.510 --> 03:58:34.520 align:start position:0%
exact line but it's close to this uh
 
03:58:36.950 --> 03:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
somewhere around line uh probably 2021
 
03:58:39.750 --> 03:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
22 this is on the uh um the EFA is
 
03:58:42.590 --> 03:58:42.600 align:start position:0%
closed because of an intentional and
 
03:58:44.590 --> 03:58:44.600 align:start position:0%
substantial misuse of funds and I
 
03:58:46.469 --> 03:58:46.479 align:start position:0%
believe the word intentional has been
 
03:58:49.309 --> 03:58:49.319 align:start position:0%
added here I was wondering why I believe
 
03:58:50.830 --> 03:58:50.840 align:start position:0%
in the original bill it just said
 
03:58:53.189 --> 03:58:53.199 align:start position:0%
substantial uh misuse of
 
03:58:58.590 --> 03:58:58.600 align:start position:0%
funds um yes that was uh um a legal
 
03:59:01.910 --> 03:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
suggestion that we received um uh we
 
03:59:05.910 --> 03:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
have other uh suggestions that it' be uh
 
03:59:10.469 --> 03:59:10.479 align:start position:0%
just uh substantial or uh just U
 
03:59:14.309 --> 03:59:14.319 align:start position:0%
intentional so uh we covered both with
 
03:59:16.870 --> 03:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
intentional and substantial well if it
 
03:59:19.910 --> 03:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
were both it would be intentional or
 
03:59:22.229 --> 03:59:22.239 align:start position:0%
substantial um in that case so here
 
03:59:23.910 --> 03:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
you're you're setting the bar rather
 
03:59:26.389 --> 03:59:26.399 align:start position:0%
high am I correct by saying it must be
 
03:59:27.990 --> 03:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
demonstrated not just that there is
 
03:59:31.149 --> 03:59:31.159 align:start position:0%
substantial misuse but that it was
 
03:59:34.950 --> 03:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
intentionally misused as well correct
 
03:59:37.429 --> 03:59:37.439 align:start position:0%
both both need to be met in order
 
03:59:37.439 --> 03:59:39.189 align:start position:0%
both both need to be met in order
unintentional

03:59:39.189 --> 03:59:39.199 align:start position:0%
unintentional
 
03:59:42.990 --> 03:59:43.000 align:start position:0%
misuse um I don't think would be
 
03:59:45.070 --> 03:59:45.080 align:start position:0%
something that we wanted to prosecute
 
03:59:49.510 --> 03:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
someone for um but certainly um if there
 
03:59:51.670 --> 03:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
is a pattern of
 
03:59:54.189 --> 03:59:54.199 align:start position:0%
misuse um and it isn't intentional
 
03:59:57.229 --> 03:59:57.239 align:start position:0%
that's something that uh uh should be
 
03:59:57.239 --> 03:59:58.189 align:start position:0%
that's something that uh uh should be
looked

03:59:58.189 --> 03:59:58.199 align:start position:0%
looked
 
04:00:00.710 --> 04:00:00.720 align:start position:0%
at well like you I I don't want to
 
04:00:03.950 --> 04:00:03.960 align:start position:0%
become a lawyer um but but my
 
04:00:05.469 --> 04:00:05.479 align:start position:0%
understanding is that intentional is a
 
04:00:07.870 --> 04:00:07.880 align:start position:0%
rather High bar to set there so anyway
 
04:00:15.710 --> 04:00:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:19.269 --> 04:00:19.279 align:start position:0%
helps uh any further questions on uh
 
04:00:21.670 --> 04:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
page three yes my hand still raised Mr
 
04:00:24.309 --> 04:00:24.319 align:start position:0%
chairman oh I'm
 
04:00:26.870 --> 04:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
sorry um representative Turner and I
 
04:00:28.349 --> 04:00:28.359 align:start position:0%
both have our Tanner and I both have our
 
04:00:32.189 --> 04:00:32.199 align:start position:0%
hands up but I'll go men before women uh
 
04:00:34.070 --> 04:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
the question that goes back to page
 
04:00:35.990 --> 04:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
three which we're on
 
04:00:39.469 --> 04:00:39.479 align:start position:0%
line uh four and five it's a followup to
 
04:00:41.309 --> 04:00:41.319 align:start position:0%
my homeschool question before of a
 
04:00:44.189 --> 04:00:44.199 align:start position:0%
youngster who's 18 homeschooled and not
 
04:00:47.710 --> 04:00:47.720 align:start position:0%
graduated so that means I could not only
 
04:00:49.429 --> 04:00:49.439 align:start position:0%
allow my youngster or send my youngster
 
04:00:51.990 --> 04:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
to a college I could have him take the
 
04:00:54.469 --> 04:00:54.479 align:start position:0%
Uber service and pay the Uber to take
 
04:00:56.870 --> 04:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
them back and forth every day under that
 
04:01:00.950 --> 04:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:04.030 --> 04:01:04.040 align:start position:0%
right it are are you talking about
 
04:01:08.670 --> 04:01:08.680 align:start position:0%
transportation to school or yes right
 
04:01:10.870 --> 04:01:10.880 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm I'm trying to get clarification
 
04:01:13.349 --> 04:01:13.359 align:start position:0%
on your question are you talking about
 
04:01:15.229 --> 04:01:15.239 align:start position:0%
transportation to someone who's
 
04:01:18.149 --> 04:01:18.159 align:start position:0%
providing an educational service yes I'm
 
04:01:22.790 --> 04:01:22.800 align:start position:0%
talking about line four line four I am a
 
04:01:25.750 --> 04:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
homeschooled 19-year-old non- high
 
04:01:29.149 --> 04:01:29.159 align:start position:0%
school graduate attending a college and
 
04:01:32.110 --> 04:01:32.120 align:start position:0%
line five we're going to have Uber take
 
04:01:33.910 --> 04:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
them back and
 
04:01:37.229 --> 04:01:37.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:40.389 --> 04:01:40.399 align:start position:0%
correct uh students uh all over the
 
04:01:43.429 --> 04:01:43.439 align:start position:0%
country currently take uh taxi services
 
04:01:46.110 --> 04:01:46.120 align:start position:0%
uh or bus services uh to Educational
 
04:01:50.110 --> 04:01:50.120 align:start position:0%
Service uh opportunities um that is what
 
04:01:52.790 --> 04:01:52.800 align:start position:0%
uh is uh being covered here
 
04:01:54.469 --> 04:01:54.479 align:start position:0%
representative qu so I'm not care about
 
04:01:56.429 --> 04:01:56.439 align:start position:0%
students all the United States students
 
04:01:57.990 --> 04:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
all the United States AR being bankrupt
 
04:02:00.309 --> 04:02:00.319 align:start position:0%
by this bill I'm just asking about this
 
04:02:03.030 --> 04:02:03.040 align:start position:0%
particular line so in your your view yes
 
04:02:06.189 --> 04:02:06.199 align:start position:0%
I can go to college get paid my view is
 
04:02:10.229 --> 04:02:10.239 align:start position:0%
that my view is that we are looking to
 
04:02:13.070 --> 04:02:13.080 align:start position:0%
cover transportation services to an
 
04:02:15.710 --> 04:02:15.720 align:start position:0%
education service provider so the answer
 
04:02:19.990 --> 04:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:22.469 --> 04:02:22.479 align:start position:0%
you uh representative
 
04:02:24.710 --> 04:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
Tanner uh thank you for taking my
 
04:02:26.550 --> 04:02:26.560 align:start position:0%
question I I just want to go back to the
 
04:02:29.630 --> 04:02:29.640 align:start position:0%
income tax uh question that that was
 
04:02:31.830 --> 04:02:31.840 align:start position:0%
here before and and also there's there's
 
04:02:33.830 --> 04:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
some other issues later on in the bill
 
04:02:36.070 --> 04:02:36.080 align:start position:0%
but um
 
04:02:38.630 --> 04:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
have since you think that since you
 
04:02:41.510 --> 04:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned that this has been uh used in
 
04:02:43.429 --> 04:02:43.439 align:start position:0%
in other states where this same bill has
 
04:02:47.550 --> 04:02:47.560 align:start position:0%
come up um has there been any Court
 
04:02:50.149 --> 04:02:50.159 align:start position:0%
challenges uh or do you expect Court
 
04:02:51.750 --> 04:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
challenges to this
 
04:02:53.870 --> 04:02:53.880 align:start position:0%
bill I do
 
04:02:56.710 --> 04:02:56.720 align:start position:0%
not um representative lakus you had a
 
04:02:58.670 --> 04:02:58.680 align:start position:0%
question have there been Court
 
04:03:03.110 --> 04:03:03.120 align:start position:0%
challenges to in to have a followup yes
 
04:03:04.830 --> 04:03:04.840 align:start position:0%
have there been Court challenges to the
 
04:03:07.429 --> 04:03:07.439 align:start position:0%
income tax part of this bill not to my
 
04:03:09.590 --> 04:03:09.600 align:start position:0%
knowledge not to
 
04:03:12.189 --> 04:03:12.199 align:start position:0%
my representative
 
04:03:14.870 --> 04:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
lakus yeah I just wanted to say somehow
 
04:03:17.309 --> 04:03:17.319 align:start position:0%
in our minds we're cumulatively adding
 
04:03:20.910 --> 04:03:20.920 align:start position:0%
all of these things college courses um
 
04:03:23.510 --> 04:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
tuition etc etc and forgetting that
 
04:03:26.349 --> 04:03:26.359 align:start position:0%
there is an upper limit and for a family
 
04:03:27.990 --> 04:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
that has money and doesn't have any
 
04:03:31.110 --> 04:03:31.120 align:start position:0%
other special needs it's like 3,700 and
 
04:03:33.830 --> 04:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
something a parent is given a pot of
 
04:03:35.790 --> 04:03:35.800 align:start position:0%
money to be distributed amongst other
 
04:03:38.149 --> 04:03:38.159 align:start position:0%
things so if they spend that money to
 
04:03:40.550 --> 04:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
send their child for a couple courses at
 
04:03:43.269 --> 04:03:43.279 align:start position:0%
the college and transportation to get
 
04:03:45.189 --> 04:03:45.199 align:start position:0%
there they aren't going to have it for
 
04:03:48.189 --> 04:03:48.199 align:start position:0%
other things um that they might need to
 
04:03:50.550 --> 04:03:50.560 align:start position:0%
have so it's a set pot of money it's not
 
04:03:54.110 --> 04:03:54.120 align:start position:0%
breaking the the bank providing all this
 
04:03:55.990 --> 04:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
huge list of things it's whatever the
 
04:03:59.189 --> 04:03:59.199 align:start position:0%
parent can get with that set amount of
 
04:04:00.990 --> 04:04:01.000 align:start position:0%
money thank
 
04:04:05.670 --> 04:04:05.680 align:start position:0%
you thank you um further
 
04:04:08.750 --> 04:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
questions uh page four then
 
04:04:11.030 --> 04:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman follow up to that
 
04:04:14.550 --> 04:04:14.560 align:start position:0%
comment okay I understand represent leas
 
04:04:16.830 --> 04:04:16.840 align:start position:0%
that it is it is a limited amount of
 
04:04:19.189 --> 04:04:19.199 align:start position:0%
money anywhere between $4 and $8,000
 
04:04:21.389 --> 04:04:21.399 align:start position:0%
their pool I understand representative
 
04:04:22.990 --> 04:04:23.000 align:start position:0%
Celli's position that parents should be
 
04:04:25.950 --> 04:04:25.960 align:start position:0%
allowed to control they go but think
 
04:04:28.269 --> 04:04:28.279 align:start position:0%
about the scenario here under the last
 
04:04:30.469 --> 04:04:30.479 align:start position:0%
one about education summer programs I
 
04:04:33.630 --> 04:04:33.640 align:start position:0%
can go to summer program buy Uber take a
 
04:04:35.910 --> 04:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
basketball course and have the taxpayers
 
04:04:38.510 --> 04:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
foot it that's all I'm saying the bill
 
04:04:41.870 --> 04:04:41.880 align:start position:0%
allows that thank
 
04:04:45.710 --> 04:04:45.720 align:start position:0%
you on page four I have a
 
04:04:48.429 --> 04:04:48.439 align:start position:0%
question yes president Miler okay I'm
 
04:04:53.309 --> 04:04:53.319 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at U that on on page on line
 
04:04:57.590 --> 04:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
three so my presumption of the statement
 
04:05:00.349 --> 04:05:00.359 align:start position:0%
about the uh
 
04:05:04.710 --> 04:05:04.720 align:start position:0%
that that the parents will ensure that
 
04:05:07.349 --> 04:05:07.359 align:start position:0%
an education takes place in the domains
 
04:05:09.309 --> 04:05:09.319 align:start position:0%
of science mathematics language
 
04:05:11.630 --> 04:05:11.640 align:start position:0%
government history Health Reading
 
04:05:13.590 --> 04:05:13.600 align:start position:0%
Writing spelling history of the
 
04:05:15.110 --> 04:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
Constitution of the United States and
 
04:05:18.229 --> 04:05:18.239 align:start position:0%
the and New Hampshire uh
 
04:05:21.830 --> 04:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
so my my sense is is that before there
 
04:05:23.710 --> 04:05:23.720 align:start position:0%
was I I thought there was an indication
 
04:05:25.630 --> 04:05:25.640 align:start position:0%
that you know parents can do anything
 
04:05:28.870 --> 04:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
they want to but with this
 
04:05:33.030 --> 04:05:33.040 align:start position:0%
language am I correct that regardless of
 
04:05:36.950 --> 04:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
the approach that an EFA parent might
 
04:05:40.269 --> 04:05:40.279 align:start position:0%
want to take they have to ensure that
 
04:05:43.710 --> 04:05:43.720 align:start position:0%
these domains must be part of their
 
04:05:46.910 --> 04:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
education am I reading that
 
04:05:49.950 --> 04:05:49.960 align:start position:0%
correctly I'm not sure what you meant by
 
04:05:52.469 --> 04:05:52.479 align:start position:0%
parents can do anything that they want
 
04:05:54.870 --> 04:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
but um these are the core knowledge
 
04:05:57.950 --> 04:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
domains um that are in the statute yes
 
04:06:06.790 --> 04:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:14.389 --> 04:06:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:19.590 --> 04:06:19.600 align:start position:0%
you um re L uh thank you Mr chair uh
 
04:06:22.030 --> 04:06:22.040 align:start position:0%
just a real quick question on um we're
 
04:06:24.070 --> 04:06:24.080 align:start position:0%
on page four I assume I'm sorry I had to
 
04:06:26.750 --> 04:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
drop out for a minute um this is just on
 
04:06:29.910 --> 04:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
the portfolio piece um that the parent
 
04:06:31.550 --> 04:06:31.560 align:start position:0%
it's one of the options for the um sort
 
04:06:34.950 --> 04:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
of uh assessment of academic progress um
 
04:06:37.189 --> 04:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
and it states um or a teacher currently
 
04:06:41.950 --> 04:06:41.960 align:start position:0%
teaching in non-public school okay um so
 
04:06:43.389 --> 04:06:43.399 align:start position:0%
does that have to be an approved
 
04:06:45.389 --> 04:06:45.399 align:start position:0%
non-public school or could it be any
 
04:06:48.469 --> 04:06:48.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:50.710 --> 04:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
anything yes you would be an approved
 
04:06:53.149 --> 04:06:53.159 align:start position:0%
public school yes nonpublic school so
 
04:06:56.910 --> 04:06:56.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:58.870 --> 04:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
there because again we don't want them
 
04:07:01.950 --> 04:07:01.960 align:start position:0%
going to the Steven Woodcock school for
 
04:07:05.030 --> 04:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
um gosh gosh knows what um a good school
 
04:07:06.429 --> 04:07:06.439 align:start position:0%
though it's a good
 
04:07:09.269 --> 04:07:09.279 align:start position:0%
school so anyway it's just a suggestion
 
04:07:11.950 --> 04:07:11.960 align:start position:0%
small point Thank You representative
 
04:07:13.910 --> 04:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
Cordelia I do have I have a question on
 
04:07:17.030 --> 04:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
the assessment Parts here the cons one
 
04:07:18.870 --> 04:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
of the concerns I have I see that there
 
04:07:21.790 --> 04:07:21.800 align:start position:0%
are three options that an EFA student
 
04:07:24.990 --> 04:07:25.000 align:start position:0%
has for some sense of accountability of
 
04:07:26.670 --> 04:07:26.680 align:start position:0%
the education they're
 
04:07:29.670 --> 04:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
receiving but it's my
 
04:07:32.070 --> 04:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
understanding that with these
 
04:07:34.510 --> 04:07:34.520 align:start position:0%
assessments that a home school a
 
04:07:39.070 --> 04:07:39.080 align:start position:0%
homeschool student would not be eligible
 
04:07:42.349 --> 04:07:42.359 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that homeschool
 
04:07:46.429 --> 04:07:46.439 align:start position:0%
students do not have to file do not have
 
04:07:50.790 --> 04:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
to file assessment reports to anyone and
 
04:07:53.670 --> 04:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
that a homeschooled parent that the law
 
04:07:55.349 --> 04:07:55.359 align:start position:0%
basically requires that The Homeschool
 
04:07:58.830 --> 04:07:58.840 align:start position:0%
parents to keep those records personal
 
04:08:00.710 --> 04:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
and they don't have to report that to
 
04:08:05.870 --> 04:08:05.880 align:start position:0%
anyone am I incorrect in that that
 
04:08:08.750 --> 04:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
understanding uh provisions are uh
 
04:08:10.830 --> 04:08:10.840 align:start position:0%
slightly different than for a homeschool
 
04:08:13.229 --> 04:08:13.239 align:start position:0%
student because they are uh different
 
04:08:16.910 --> 04:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
categories of uh student but if I if I'm
 
04:08:21.750 --> 04:08:21.760 align:start position:0%
a homeschool student and I seek an EFA
 
04:08:24.590 --> 04:08:24.600 align:start position:0%
grant that then moves me into another
 
04:08:27.590 --> 04:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
category according to this law that's
 
04:08:29.389 --> 04:08:29.399 align:start position:0%
correct you you no longer are a
 
04:08:31.309 --> 04:08:31.319 align:start position:0%
homeschool student you are now an EFA
 
04:08:34.710 --> 04:08:34.720 align:start position:0%
student so okay so if I am a homeschool
 
04:08:38.269 --> 04:08:38.279 align:start position:0%
student and I do not want to have the
 
04:08:42.510 --> 04:08:42.520 align:start position:0%
and comply with these three options of
 
04:08:44.870 --> 04:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
accountability then I in essence could
 
04:08:48.070 --> 04:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
not become an EFA student because if I
 
04:08:50.429 --> 04:08:50.439 align:start position:0%
did then I would have to submit those
 
04:08:53.710 --> 04:08:53.720 align:start position:0%
reports to the scholarship organization
 
04:08:56.550 --> 04:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
correct if a homeschool student and
 
04:08:59.950 --> 04:08:59.960 align:start position:0%
their parents decide um that they want
 
04:09:05.469 --> 04:09:05.479 align:start position:0%
to get an EA excuse me an EFA account uh
 
04:09:07.149 --> 04:09:07.159 align:start position:0%
they would have to comply with these
 
04:09:07.159 --> 04:09:08.950 align:start position:0%
they would have to comply with these
provisions

04:09:08.950 --> 04:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
provisions
 
04:09:10.870 --> 04:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you because we have received
 
04:09:14.389 --> 04:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
as we all know we have received a few uh
 
04:09:17.469 --> 04:09:17.479 align:start position:0%
emails from EF from homeschool parents
 
04:09:21.309 --> 04:09:21.319 align:start position:0%
concerned about potential impact upon uh
 
04:09:24.389 --> 04:09:24.399 align:start position:0%
their um ability to continue to be a
 
04:09:26.269 --> 04:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
homeschool parent as well as being an
 
04:09:28.630 --> 04:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
EFA but you've clarified that that in
 
04:09:30.510 --> 04:09:30.520 align:start position:0%
fact they have a decision to make either
 
04:09:33.109 --> 04:09:33.119 align:start position:0%
stay a homeschool or become an EFA thank
 
04:09:35.710 --> 04:09:35.720 align:start position:0%
you for that clarification yes that's
 
04:09:38.269 --> 04:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
one of the uh Main things we wanted to
 
04:09:40.870 --> 04:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
do in this amendment um from from what
 
04:09:43.070 --> 04:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
we've seen in emails and heard from
 
04:09:45.349 --> 04:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
people and heard at the hearings that
 
04:09:48.469 --> 04:09:48.479 align:start position:0%
was the purpose of uh putting forward
 
04:09:48.479 --> 04:09:50.750 align:start position:0%
was the purpose of uh putting forward
this

04:09:50.750 --> 04:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:54.590 --> 04:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:57.309 --> 04:09:57.319 align:start position:0%
you are we on to page
 
04:09:59.750 --> 04:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
five excuse me Mr chair I have a
 
04:10:03.670 --> 04:10:03.680 align:start position:0%
question tan I'm sorry thank you um with
 
04:10:08.109 --> 04:10:08.119 align:start position:0%
this assessment uh part if they take uh
 
04:10:13.309 --> 04:10:13.319 align:start position:0%
the the um State uh test uh or any part
 
04:10:16.109 --> 04:10:16.119 align:start position:0%
of it I guess are they uh part of the
 
04:10:19.109 --> 04:10:19.119 align:start position:0%
Essa are are they included in Essa at
 
04:10:19.119 --> 04:10:20.630 align:start position:0%
Essa are are they included in Essa at
all

04:10:20.630 --> 04:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
all
 
04:10:24.710 --> 04:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
um for statistics
 
04:10:32.429 --> 04:10:32.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:35.790 --> 04:10:35.800 align:start position:0%
whatever in in terms in terms of Essa
 
04:10:39.870 --> 04:10:39.880 align:start position:0%
ESS is the um we have a state plan for
 
04:10:43.389 --> 04:10:43.399 align:start position:0%
uh complying with Federal Essa law I'm
 
04:10:47.309 --> 04:10:47.319 align:start position:0%
not sure what your um if they take the
 
04:10:50.429 --> 04:10:50.439 align:start position:0%
Statewide assessment yes are they then
 
04:10:53.269 --> 04:10:53.279 align:start position:0%
part of the Essa the the Essa statistics
 
04:10:57.269 --> 04:10:57.279 align:start position:0%
that go in and uh do we have a a special
 
04:11:01.109 --> 04:11:01.119 align:start position:0%
category for them or there is
 
04:11:03.590 --> 04:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
uh I have not discussed with the
 
04:11:04.790 --> 04:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
Department if there' be a separate
 
04:11:08.309 --> 04:11:08.319 align:start position:0%
category but I I do not envision
 
04:11:09.950 --> 04:11:09.960 align:start position:0%
that that would be
 
04:11:13.309 --> 04:11:13.319 align:start position:0%
required okay and just another followup
 
04:11:16.550 --> 04:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
on this again uh coming back to my
 
04:11:19.109 --> 04:11:19.119 align:start position:0%
initial uh question where the
 
04:11:21.710 --> 04:11:21.720 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization is doing all
 
04:11:24.030 --> 04:11:24.040 align:start position:0%
this and we presently have two approved
 
04:11:26.670 --> 04:11:26.680 align:start position:0%
scholarship organizations will there be
 
04:11:31.389 --> 04:11:31.399 align:start position:0%
a brand new RFP put out so that
 
04:11:34.670 --> 04:11:34.680 align:start position:0%
um we will understand who actually is
 
04:11:34.680 --> 04:11:36.349 align:start position:0%
um we will understand who actually is
running

04:11:36.349 --> 04:11:36.359 align:start position:0%
running
 
04:11:36.359 --> 04:11:38.269 align:start position:0%
running
this

04:11:38.269 --> 04:11:38.279 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:11:40.790 --> 04:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
um I believe that's what I indicated
 
04:11:43.389 --> 04:11:43.399 align:start position:0%
earlier so it isn't necessarily the
 
04:11:44.870 --> 04:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
children's scholarship fund that we're
 
04:11:50.710 --> 04:11:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:54.950 --> 04:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
point was that a question yes yeah um
 
04:11:57.910 --> 04:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
yeah there would be uh an RFP is my
 
04:12:00.590 --> 04:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
understanding from the Department um and
 
04:12:02.790 --> 04:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
um that's the process that would be
 
04:12:06.149 --> 04:12:06.159 align:start position:0%
followed thank you on on that point
 
04:12:08.030 --> 04:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
though could it be possible that there
 
04:12:10.590 --> 04:12:10.600 align:start position:0%
could be two scholarship organ or
 
04:12:12.750 --> 04:12:12.760 align:start position:0%
multiple scholarship organizations that
 
04:12:15.790 --> 04:12:15.800 align:start position:0%
would be prepared to monitor this or is
 
04:12:17.710 --> 04:12:17.720 align:start position:0%
it the intent of this law that would
 
04:12:20.990 --> 04:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
there' be one scholarship organization
 
04:12:23.309 --> 04:12:23.319 align:start position:0%
only I I believe the intent is that
 
04:12:25.590 --> 04:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
there would be one scholarship program
 
04:12:27.910 --> 04:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
one scholarship organization managing
 
04:12:32.349 --> 04:12:32.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:36.189 --> 04:12:36.199 align:start position:0%
you uh representative Mullen thank you I
 
04:12:37.550 --> 04:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
thought you might like to just talk to
 
04:12:39.630 --> 04:12:39.640 align:start position:0%
somebody different for just a minute or
 
04:12:42.469 --> 04:12:42.479 align:start position:0%
so representative cordelli thank you
 
04:12:46.790 --> 04:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
you're quite welcome you owe me um uh so
 
04:12:48.710 --> 04:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
as part of the agreement that the parent
 
04:12:52.030 --> 04:12:52.040 align:start position:0%
makes uh in getting into the program
 
04:12:54.790 --> 04:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
they agree that their student will not
 
04:12:57.590 --> 04:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
attend their resident District full-time
 
04:13:00.950 --> 04:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
that that's correct right yes um can
 
04:13:05.550 --> 04:13:05.560 align:start position:0%
they I could a student take one course
 
04:13:08.070 --> 04:13:08.080 align:start position:0%
what if the student wanted to take lab
 
04:13:10.790 --> 04:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
science or foreign language or something
 
04:13:12.910 --> 04:13:12.920 align:start position:0%
that uh the parent didn't feel that they
 
04:13:14.510 --> 04:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
could provide for the student could they
 
04:13:17.309 --> 04:13:17.319 align:start position:0%
do that in their in their resident high
 
04:13:19.750 --> 04:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
school chemistry lab or something like
 
04:13:23.910 --> 04:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
that yeah and and I heard um
 
04:13:26.550 --> 04:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
representative lad say something about
 
04:13:30.670 --> 04:13:30.680 align:start position:0%
um a fee a school could in fact charge a
 
04:13:35.269 --> 04:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
fee if the child were not being funded
 
04:13:37.510 --> 04:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
through the adequacy grant or whatever
 
04:13:42.389 --> 04:13:42.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:45.109 --> 04:13:45.119 align:start position:0%
that what are you on our curricular or
 
04:13:47.429 --> 04:13:47.439 align:start position:0%
non-curricular Alicia's nodding so I'm
 
04:13:50.070 --> 04:13:50.080 align:start position:0%
gonna go with Alicia
 
04:13:52.950 --> 04:13:52.960 align:start position:0%
that I just I just walked in so I'm on
 
04:13:56.070 --> 04:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
page four I'm just asking a question um
 
04:13:58.269 --> 04:13:58.279 align:start position:0%
as part of the parental agreement it
 
04:14:00.469 --> 04:14:00.479 align:start position:0%
says that you won't enroll your student
 
04:14:03.389 --> 04:14:03.399 align:start position:0%
full-time so I was asking can you go
 
04:14:07.429 --> 04:14:07.439 align:start position:0%
part-time is there a fee who sets up
 
04:14:10.189 --> 04:14:10.199 align:start position:0%
that fee and administ administers it
 
04:14:11.309 --> 04:14:11.319 align:start position:0%
does the
 
04:14:15.309 --> 04:14:15.319 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization do that as
 
04:14:18.309 --> 04:14:18.319 align:start position:0%
well can can I answer that okay
 
04:14:19.910 --> 04:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
representative Lakers yeah this was a
 
04:14:23.750 --> 04:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
question I had because my U last son was
 
04:14:26.189 --> 04:14:26.199 align:start position:0%
homeschooled and he took two classes at
 
04:14:28.309 --> 04:14:28.319 align:start position:0%
the high school all the time and I did
 
04:14:30.309 --> 04:14:30.319 align:start position:0%
call the doe because I wanted to make
 
04:14:32.429 --> 04:14:32.439 align:start position:0%
sure that children doing this could
 
04:14:34.830 --> 04:14:34.840 align:start position:0%
still do that and I said and we didn't
 
04:14:36.670 --> 04:14:36.680 align:start position:0%
pay anything because we pay taxes and he
 
04:14:39.030 --> 04:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
said well actually the
 
04:14:42.630 --> 04:14:42.640 align:start position:0%
school um is reimbursed for those
 
04:14:45.389 --> 04:14:45.399 align:start position:0%
classes were we reimbursed when my son
 
04:14:49.510 --> 04:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
went and that with this um the parent
 
04:14:51.750 --> 04:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
would since the parent now has the state
 
04:14:54.189 --> 04:14:54.199 align:start position:0%
money and that was reimbursed from the
 
04:14:57.830 --> 04:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
state money at that
 
04:15:00.830 --> 04:15:00.840 align:start position:0%
0.15 um the school the parent would then
 
04:15:04.630 --> 04:15:04.640 align:start position:0%
reimburse the school from this for that
 
04:15:07.309 --> 04:15:07.319 align:start position:0%
0.15 so it would be the amount that the
 
04:15:09.389 --> 04:15:09.399 align:start position:0%
state would have paid only because the
 
04:15:11.550 --> 04:15:11.560 align:start position:0%
state gave the money to the parent
 
04:15:13.790 --> 04:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
already then it has to come out of the
 
04:15:16.349 --> 04:15:16.359 align:start position:0%
EFA money but it's the same money that
 
04:15:18.510 --> 04:15:18.520 align:start position:0%
would have gone to the school either way
 
04:15:20.109 --> 04:15:20.119 align:start position:0%
no I get that what I want to know though
 
04:15:23.030 --> 04:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
is um who who has to do the accounting
 
04:15:25.030 --> 04:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
for this does the scholarship
 
04:15:28.510 --> 04:15:28.520 align:start position:0%
organization do it or is the school
 
04:15:32.070 --> 04:15:32.080 align:start position:0%
supposed to do the accounting for this
 
04:15:35.710 --> 04:15:35.720 align:start position:0%
or the the school would be a service
 
04:15:37.790 --> 04:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
provider and
 
04:15:41.710 --> 04:15:41.720 align:start position:0%
um U would be paid from the
 
04:15:45.149 --> 04:15:45.159 align:start position:0%
account okay so so my followup then to
 
04:15:47.670 --> 04:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
that and I'm sorry that it's not on the
 
04:15:49.910 --> 04:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
right page and you can tell me to wait
 
04:15:53.429 --> 04:15:53.439 align:start position:0%
until we get to the page if you want but
 
04:15:55.630 --> 04:15:55.640 align:start position:0%
how would that
 
04:15:59.710 --> 04:15:59.720 align:start position:0%
interface with no government control and
 
04:16:02.710 --> 04:16:02.720 align:start position:0%
no state regulations or whatever if
 
04:16:06.070 --> 04:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
you're an actual Public School providing
 
04:16:10.950 --> 04:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:13.149 --> 04:16:13.159 align:start position:0%
my my understanding is that that would
 
04:16:15.030 --> 04:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
be an agreement between the family in
 
04:16:16.870 --> 04:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
the public school in order to provide
 
04:16:19.149 --> 04:16:19.159 align:start position:0%
access at a certain agreed upon
 
04:16:22.670 --> 04:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
price right but on page um eight I think
 
04:16:25.389 --> 04:16:25.399 align:start position:0%
representative Lon um there's that
 
04:16:29.830 --> 04:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
statement about no government no ESP
 
04:16:34.469 --> 04:16:34.479 align:start position:0%
will be subject to uh government control
 
04:16:37.590 --> 04:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
and then right below that Roman 2
 
04:16:42.109 --> 04:16:42.119 align:start position:0%
says that um I'm paraphrasing uh but
 
04:16:45.510 --> 04:16:45.520 align:start position:0%
says that you the statute does not
 
04:16:49.269 --> 04:16:49.279 align:start position:0%
expand the state's rights to make rules
 
04:16:52.510 --> 04:16:52.520 align:start position:0%
and regulations basically around it so I
 
04:16:55.510 --> 04:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
I get how it works if you're not a
 
04:16:57.910 --> 04:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
government agency but I don't get how it
 
04:17:00.830 --> 04:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
works if you are a government agency I
 
04:17:01.990 --> 04:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
guess it comes to the matter of
 
04:17:04.550 --> 04:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
voluntary participation because if you
 
04:17:06.550 --> 04:17:06.560 align:start position:0%
voluntarily are working with your school
 
04:17:08.149 --> 04:17:08.159 align:start position:0%
district that's not increasing their
 
04:17:11.149 --> 04:17:11.159 align:start position:0%
control it's allowing you to voluntarily
 
04:17:13.030 --> 04:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
enter into an agreement with a
 
04:17:14.630 --> 04:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
government body and it shouldn't always
 
04:17:16.469 --> 04:17:16.479 align:start position:0%
be about mandates it should be about the
 
04:17:19.109 --> 04:17:19.119 align:start position:0%
fact that our government does Serve the
 
04:17:20.950 --> 04:17:20.960 align:start position:0%
People and we do provide important
 
04:17:22.710 --> 04:17:22.720 align:start position:0%
services and this should be Vol there
 
04:17:25.750 --> 04:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
should be voluntary ways that do not
 
04:17:29.109 --> 04:17:29.119 align:start position:0%
need to be be strictly laid out when you
 
04:17:30.990 --> 04:17:31.000 align:start position:0%
can reach an agreement that is agreeable
 
04:17:32.550 --> 04:17:32.560 align:start position:0%
to the school to the parent and to the
 
04:17:34.630 --> 04:17:34.640 align:start position:0%
student to best provide it I think I'm
 
04:17:36.389 --> 04:17:36.399 align:start position:0%
coming at it from a different direction
 
04:17:39.309 --> 04:17:39.319 align:start position:0%
though what I want to know is is the
 
04:17:42.830 --> 04:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
school subject to control what I want to
 
04:17:45.309 --> 04:17:45.319 align:start position:0%
know is hey if I'm a chemistry teacher
 
04:17:48.630 --> 04:17:48.640 align:start position:0%
in a public school and I've got Esa kids
 
04:17:53.109 --> 04:17:53.119 align:start position:0%
can I uh sort of skirt the regulations
 
04:17:57.710 --> 04:17:57.720 align:start position:0%
or uh do things differently because I
 
04:18:01.870 --> 04:18:01.880 align:start position:0%
get sort of a um you know free pass on
 
04:18:04.670 --> 04:18:04.680 align:start position:0%
the regulation aspect of my teaching
 
04:18:06.990 --> 04:18:07.000 align:start position:0%
that's you're now an ESP yeah cuz you're
 
04:18:08.750 --> 04:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
an ESP you're no longer you know what
 
04:18:11.309 --> 04:18:11.319 align:start position:0%
I'm saying I uh I don't think so unless
 
04:18:13.070 --> 04:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
you're talking about our other bill
 
04:18:15.269 --> 04:18:15.279 align:start position:0%
which grants waivers for
 
04:18:18.830 --> 04:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
Innovation ah there you go touche
 
04:18:21.090 --> 04:18:21.100 align:start position:0%
representative cord
 
04:18:21.100 --> 04:18:22.710 align:start position:0%
representative cord
[Laughter]

04:18:22.710 --> 04:18:22.720 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
04:18:25.389 --> 04:18:25.399 align:start position:0%
Deli okay thank you very much thank you
 
04:18:27.910 --> 04:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
very much representative Mullen okay
 
04:18:29.910 --> 04:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
further questions represent whitcock
 
04:18:33.670 --> 04:18:33.680 align:start position:0%
thank you page four U I had two question
 
04:18:37.870 --> 04:18:37.880 align:start position:0%
but representative Mullen stole one uh
 
04:18:40.870 --> 04:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
in the part of the accountability
 
04:18:43.309 --> 04:18:43.319 align:start position:0%
represent in the amendment that the most
 
04:18:45.790 --> 04:18:45.800 align:start position:0%
recent one the Alid lad amendment I
 
04:18:47.630 --> 04:18:47.640 align:start position:0%
can't see the number because it's on the
 
04:18:50.349 --> 04:18:50.359 align:start position:0%
screen um the one we get this afternoon
 
04:18:52.389 --> 04:18:52.399 align:start position:0%
it talks about under
 
04:18:55.630 --> 04:18:55.640 align:start position:0%
14 uh that the certification the review
 
04:18:56.910 --> 04:18:56.920 align:start position:0%
of the assessment the authentic
 
04:18:59.830 --> 04:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
assessment all those types of pieces uh
 
04:19:03.630 --> 04:19:03.640 align:start position:0%
can be selected by a teacher uh by the
 
04:19:06.349 --> 04:19:06.359 align:start position:0%
parent uh so basically if I understand
 
04:19:07.229 --> 04:19:07.239 align:start position:0%
this right
 
04:19:10.870 --> 04:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
if I am a teacher of a youngster I can
 
04:19:13.389 --> 04:19:13.399 align:start position:0%
also be one selected to meet this
 
04:19:15.429 --> 04:19:15.439 align:start position:0%
assessment requirement by the parent is
 
04:19:18.990 --> 04:19:19.000 align:start position:0%
that correct yes okay so it's really not
 
04:19:21.550 --> 04:19:21.560 align:start position:0%
a so it's like you know taking care of
 
04:19:24.309 --> 04:19:24.319 align:start position:0%
your own sort like the you know who's
 
04:19:26.389 --> 04:19:26.399 align:start position:0%
who's control of foresty if if I'm I'm
 
04:19:27.670 --> 04:19:27.680 align:start position:0%
teaching you I'm assuming you're doing
 
04:19:29.990 --> 04:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
well and I'm saying you assess it okay
 
04:19:32.030 --> 04:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
so that I want to one more part of that
 
04:19:34.429 --> 04:19:34.439 align:start position:0%
if I may represent that that whole piece
 
04:19:36.710 --> 04:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
the requirement the assessment the
 
04:19:39.389 --> 04:19:39.399 align:start position:0%
certification the parent doing this um
 
04:19:40.870 --> 04:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
the teachers doing that making sure the
 
04:19:43.469 --> 04:19:43.479 align:start position:0%
youngsters is on track would that not be
 
04:19:46.550 --> 04:19:46.560 align:start position:0%
in conflict with the same same citation
 
04:19:48.710 --> 04:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
that representative Mullen talked about
 
04:19:53.229 --> 04:19:53.239 align:start position:0%
uh on page eight line 33 it says the es
 
04:19:56.469 --> 04:19:56.479 align:start position:0%
students uh shall be given Max freed to
 
04:19:59.429 --> 04:19:59.439 align:start position:0%
provide Ed esps provide the needs
 
04:20:01.189 --> 04:20:01.199 align:start position:0%
without any government control wouldn't
 
04:20:03.469 --> 04:20:03.479 align:start position:0%
that be government control telling them
 
04:20:05.510 --> 04:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
that they have to this that the the
 
04:20:07.710 --> 04:20:07.720 align:start position:0%
outline of our structure is telling them
 
04:20:15.710 --> 04:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:17.630 --> 04:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
assessments I I don't know throughout
 
04:20:21.389 --> 04:20:21.399 align:start position:0%
this entire uh Bill we've had questions
 
04:20:24.109 --> 04:20:24.119 align:start position:0%
regarding accountability and I I think
 
04:20:27.309 --> 04:20:27.319 align:start position:0%
these assessments back right to that
 
04:20:30.149 --> 04:20:30.159 align:start position:0%
form of accountability and every one of
 
04:20:33.149 --> 04:20:33.159 align:start position:0%
these four areas that we have public
 
04:20:37.630 --> 04:20:37.640 align:start position:0%
school private school um uh e fa and
 
04:20:40.030 --> 04:20:40.040 align:start position:0%
homeschooling there's an accountability
 
04:20:42.630 --> 04:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
process laid out in
 
04:20:45.269 --> 04:20:45.279 align:start position:0%
statute but my question repr L wouldn't
 
04:20:49.870 --> 04:20:49.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:52.630 --> 04:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
control uh I I think that you're looking
 
04:20:54.550 --> 04:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
at the assessment which has accomplished
 
04:20:59.630 --> 04:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
the way it's so stated here is uh yes it
 
04:21:01.990 --> 04:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
is looking at that were we through the
 
04:21:04.830 --> 04:21:04.840 align:start position:0%
compulsory attendance we're we saying
 
04:21:07.469 --> 04:21:07.479 align:start position:0%
that and with State money in involved
 
04:21:09.030 --> 04:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
there has to be some kind of
 
04:21:10.670 --> 04:21:10.680 align:start position:0%
accountability that there is a program
 
04:21:13.149 --> 04:21:13.159 align:start position:0%
occurring and that program is
 
04:21:15.469 --> 04:21:15.479 align:start position:0%
effective I'm not talking about consuls
 
04:21:18.269 --> 04:21:18.279 align:start position:0%
attendance for I'm talking about line
 
04:21:21.510 --> 04:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
line 33 that says the provider I don't
 
04:21:23.109 --> 04:21:23.119 align:start position:0%
think any wrong with it the providers
 
04:21:25.590 --> 04:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
allowed maximum flexibility without
 
04:21:28.109 --> 04:21:28.119 align:start position:0%
government control but it seems to me
 
04:21:30.550 --> 04:21:30.560 align:start position:0%
once we St putting these standards in of
 
04:21:32.670 --> 04:21:32.680 align:start position:0%
certify assessment that's government
 
04:21:34.030 --> 04:21:34.040 align:start position:0%
control we're telling them what they
 
04:21:35.910 --> 04:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
have to do it's just it just doesn't
 
04:21:37.349 --> 04:21:37.359 align:start position:0%
make any sense you can't have it both
 
04:21:41.510 --> 04:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
ways that's all so so do I take it that
 
04:21:43.590 --> 04:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
you are not in favor of those
 
04:21:43.600 --> 04:21:46.070 align:start position:0%
you are not in favor of those
accountability

04:21:46.070 --> 04:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
04:21:49.030 --> 04:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
standards as regards what the one of the
 
04:21:51.149 --> 04:21:51.159 align:start position:0%
after I go to college VI my Uber play
 
04:21:53.349 --> 04:21:53.359 align:start position:0%
basketball and use a tax money that's a
 
04:21:55.389 --> 04:21:55.399 align:start position:0%
good standard
 
04:21:57.950 --> 04:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
no I didn't catch that
 
04:21:57.960 --> 04:22:00.349 align:start position:0%
no I didn't catch that
but

04:22:00.349 --> 04:22:00.359 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:22:04.229 --> 04:22:04.239 align:start position:0%
sorry yeah it says that the provider is
 
04:22:06.910 --> 04:22:06.920 align:start position:0%
not um under those stand standards it
 
04:22:10.309 --> 04:22:10.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't say that the parent student is
 
04:22:13.469 --> 04:22:13.479 align:start position:0%
not the parent student is agreeing to
 
04:22:16.269 --> 04:22:16.279 align:start position:0%
these things when they do this that's
 
04:22:18.229 --> 04:22:18.239 align:start position:0%
saying the government it doesn't say the
 
04:22:19.870 --> 04:22:19.880 align:start position:0%
government has control over the student
 
04:22:21.790 --> 04:22:21.800 align:start position:0%
or their learning it says the government
 
04:22:24.309 --> 04:22:24.319 align:start position:0%
has or not control says the government
 
04:22:28.590 --> 04:22:28.600 align:start position:0%
is the provider is not being
 
04:22:31.710 --> 04:22:31.720 align:start position:0%
uh having additional at any rate you
 
04:22:33.950 --> 04:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
know what I mean if they at least if
 
04:22:35.630 --> 04:22:35.640 align:start position:0%
they have to provide assessment that's
 
04:22:37.109 --> 04:22:37.119 align:start position:0%
control telling them what they have to
 
04:22:39.510 --> 04:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
assess and how to do
 
04:22:42.429 --> 04:22:42.439 align:start position:0%
it representative
 
04:22:45.590 --> 04:22:45.600 align:start position:0%

yes uh further
 
04:23:59.710 --> 04:23:59.720 align:start position:0%
questions okay are we uh off of this

you are there any questions uh uh
 
04:24:21.830 --> 04:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
referencing we've moved around one one
 
04:24:23.990 --> 04:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
page necessarily maybe backed up with
 
04:24:26.429 --> 04:24:26.439 align:start position:0%
another page yes but page five are there
 
04:24:30.070 --> 04:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:32.189 --> 04:24:32.199 align:start position:0%
comments representative Mullen you have
 
04:24:33.269 --> 04:24:33.279 align:start position:0%

04:24:36.680 --> 04:24:42.349 align:start position:0%
up is taking it down okay thank you
represent

04:24:42.349 --> 04:24:42.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:46.149 --> 04:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:48.109 --> 04:24:48.119 align:start position:0%
mute that's probably the best way to
 
04:24:50.389 --> 04:24:50.399 align:start position:0%
have me thank you representa lad I
 
04:24:54.910 --> 04:24:54.920 align:start position:0%
apologize um on page five line 24 of the
 
04:24:58.990 --> 04:24:59.000 align:start position:0%
most recent uh Amendment tonight's uh
 
04:25:00.670 --> 04:25:00.680 align:start position:0%
lad allot Amendment the last one that
 
04:25:06.229 --> 04:25:06.239 align:start position:0%
came in um on page 24 it says uh the if
 
04:25:07.670 --> 04:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
I read the right right right there
 
04:25:10.870 --> 04:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
section a 22 3 and 4 the intent of that
 
04:25:13.910 --> 04:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
is to the scholarship organization to
 
04:25:16.309 --> 04:25:16.319 align:start position:0%
provide the most non-restrictive and
 
04:25:22.990 --> 04:25:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:25.429 --> 04:25:25.439 align:start position:0%
correct now which which line are you on
 
04:25:29.990 --> 04:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
now in Rick line 22 through 26 it's the
 
04:25:33.309 --> 04:25:33.319 align:start position:0%
okay it's the how I pay routine
 
04:25:35.469 --> 04:25:35.479 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm assuming that they're trying
 
04:25:40.910 --> 04:25:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:43.030 --> 04:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
possible that is that that is that the
 
04:25:46.389 --> 04:25:46.399 align:start position:0%
right understanding is that if if that
 
04:25:50.790 --> 04:25:50.800 align:start position:0%
was a question uh yes they're trying to
 
04:25:54.269 --> 04:25:54.279 align:start position:0%
they're trying to uh um eliminate the
 
04:25:58.670 --> 04:25:58.680 align:start position:0%
need for uh uh payment um out of pocket
 
04:26:02.389 --> 04:26:02.399 align:start position:0%
where possible um and uh wait for
 
04:26:05.109 --> 04:26:05.119 align:start position:0%
reimbursement on part of the Cent yeah
 
04:26:07.149 --> 04:26:07.159 align:start position:0%
it sounds like teachers song I get that
 
04:26:09.990 --> 04:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
okay so on line thank you representative
 
04:26:14.349 --> 04:26:14.359 align:start position:0%
cordelli on line 23 it says but rather
 
04:26:16.429 --> 04:26:16.439 align:start position:0%
uh and that goes in maximum
 
04:26:19.070 --> 04:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
flexibility to the parents by
 
04:26:21.309 --> 04:26:21.319 align:start position:0%
facilitating direct payments to the
 
04:26:24.910 --> 04:26:24.920 align:start position:0%
esps so my question there is does that
 
04:26:27.309 --> 04:26:27.319 align:start position:0%
mean the scholarship organization will
 
04:26:29.550 --> 04:26:29.560 align:start position:0%
be sending the money tuition money
 
04:26:31.429 --> 04:26:31.439 align:start position:0%
directly to the religious
 
04:26:34.990 --> 04:26:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:37.590 --> 04:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
school if there there will be an
 
04:26:39.670 --> 04:26:39.680 align:start position:0%
electronic system as I think
 
04:26:41.630 --> 04:26:41.640 align:start position:0%
representative lakus mentioned before a
 
04:26:43.790 --> 04:26:43.800 align:start position:0%
system called class wallet who we've
 
04:26:48.349 --> 04:26:48.359 align:start position:0%
heard from in the um public hearing uh
 
04:26:50.790 --> 04:26:50.800 align:start position:0%
is most likely the system electronic
 
04:26:54.189 --> 04:26:54.199 align:start position:0%
system to be used and uh the uh
 
04:26:57.189 --> 04:26:57.199 align:start position:0%
religious school or non-religious school
 
04:26:59.550 --> 04:26:59.560 align:start position:0%
would be a service provider and be in
 
04:27:02.630 --> 04:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
that system and be paid uh via that
 
04:27:04.830 --> 04:27:04.840 align:start position:0%
system for the tuition fees for the
 
04:27:08.070 --> 04:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
student okay so just to follow up your
 
04:27:09.950 --> 04:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
comment repr Kelly I wasn't questioning
 
04:27:11.790 --> 04:27:11.800 align:start position:0%
how it did that I understood that what
 
04:27:13.590 --> 04:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
represent leas made very clear before
 
04:27:15.710 --> 04:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
that system so but the bottom line is
 
04:27:18.030 --> 04:27:18.040 align:start position:0%
the simple layman's term is the money is
 
04:27:21.349 --> 04:27:21.359 align:start position:0%
going from the organization to the
 
04:27:24.189 --> 04:27:24.199 align:start position:0%
religious school to the not not from not
 
04:27:26.670 --> 04:27:26.680 align:start position:0%
from the organization the service
 
04:27:29.790 --> 04:27:29.800 align:start position:0%
provider service provider State service
 
04:27:31.269 --> 04:27:31.279 align:start position:0%
provider religious school is that
 
04:27:34.309 --> 04:27:34.319 align:start position:0%
correct that the
 
04:27:38.349 --> 04:27:38.359 align:start position:0%
Train the this State funds get to put
 
04:27:41.389 --> 04:27:41.399 align:start position:0%
into the account the account is directed
 
04:27:44.830 --> 04:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
by the parent in this case to the uh
 
04:27:47.950 --> 04:27:47.960 align:start position:0%
school for payment of tuition this says
 
04:27:50.870 --> 04:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
direct payments from the the service
 
04:27:53.030 --> 04:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
facilitating direct payments to the es
 
04:27:55.149 --> 04:27:55.159 align:start position:0%
provider doesn't say from the parent
 
04:27:56.910 --> 04:27:56.920 align:start position:0%
it's the scholarship organization
 
04:27:59.870 --> 04:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't say the parent this is bypass
 
04:28:03.510 --> 04:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:06.229 --> 04:28:06.239 align:start position:0%
purpose thank you there they are
 
04:28:09.229 --> 04:28:09.239 align:start position:0%
preapproved programs
 
04:28:11.990 --> 04:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
so not suggesting they're not valid not
 
04:28:13.950 --> 04:28:13.960 align:start position:0%
pre-approved represent I'm just saying
 
04:28:16.229 --> 04:28:16.239 align:start position:0%
the money in simple lay terms is going
 
04:28:18.790 --> 04:28:18.800 align:start position:0%
from the esa to the provider to the
 
04:28:21.830 --> 04:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
religious school that's all represent
 
04:28:21.840 --> 04:28:22.630 align:start position:0%
religious school that's all represent
like

04:28:22.630 --> 04:28:22.640 align:start position:0%
like
 
04:28:26.670 --> 04:28:26.680 align:start position:0%
us yeah my understanding is that it's
 
04:28:31.149 --> 04:28:31.159 align:start position:0%
sort of like having an EBT card um as
 
04:28:33.950 --> 04:28:33.960 align:start position:0%
the parent you're actually using the
 
04:28:37.149 --> 04:28:37.159 align:start position:0%
card the money is and it goes through
 
04:28:39.070 --> 04:28:39.080 align:start position:0%
that it goes through that service
 
04:28:41.349 --> 04:28:41.359 align:start position:0%
provider but it is the parent who's
 
04:28:43.950 --> 04:28:43.960 align:start position:0%
using the card so it's the parent who's
 
04:28:47.630 --> 04:28:47.640 align:start position:0%
paying just like if you paid let's say
 
04:28:50.750 --> 04:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
you paid with a Visa card you're paying
 
04:28:52.830 --> 04:28:52.840 align:start position:0%
but there's service interactions that go
 
04:28:55.229 --> 04:28:55.239 align:start position:0%
on in between and your money goes from
 
04:28:56.910 --> 04:28:56.920 align:start position:0%
here to there whatever but you're the
 
04:28:58.550 --> 04:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
one it's always considered that you're
 
04:29:02.030 --> 04:29:02.040 align:start position:0%
the one who's who's making the charge
 
04:29:04.189 --> 04:29:04.199 align:start position:0%
right or with an EBT card you're the one
 
04:29:05.950 --> 04:29:05.960 align:start position:0%
who's making the charge to the grocery
 
04:29:08.149 --> 04:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
store and that's this the parents are
 
04:29:12.510 --> 04:29:12.520 align:start position:0%
using the card and making the payment to
 
04:29:16.950 --> 04:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
the school but it goes through the E the
 
04:29:20.429 --> 04:29:20.439 align:start position:0%
um electronic service provider there's a
 
04:29:22.550 --> 04:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
fee and whatever there you know just
 
04:29:24.109 --> 04:29:24.119 align:start position:0%
like when you use your credit card and
 
04:29:26.189 --> 04:29:26.199 align:start position:0%
the money gets moved around that's how
 
04:29:28.790 --> 04:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
it works I understand that represent
 
04:29:31.349 --> 04:29:31.359 align:start position:0%
Lakers thank you but what this says what
 
04:29:32.990 --> 04:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
this says is the money goes directly
 
04:29:35.990 --> 04:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
from the service Prov from the ESL from
 
04:29:38.950 --> 04:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
the state the service provider granted
 
04:29:41.710 --> 04:29:41.720 align:start position:0%
the parents said it's okay to the
 
04:29:43.510 --> 04:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
private school the religious school so
 
04:29:44.830 --> 04:29:44.840 align:start position:0%
the money is going directly there even
 
04:29:47.229 --> 04:29:47.239 align:start position:0%
though the parent okay it that's what it
 
04:29:51.309 --> 04:29:51.319 align:start position:0%
says thank you representative Tanner um
 
04:29:54.189 --> 04:29:54.199 align:start position:0%
thank you uh this was uh a question I
 
04:29:56.149 --> 04:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
think I asked the the people with the
 
04:29:58.910 --> 04:29:58.920 align:start position:0%
card uh before about uh
 
04:30:01.950 --> 04:30:01.960 align:start position:0%
pre-approval and also about competition
 
04:30:04.790 --> 04:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
to get the cheapest amount for I used an
 
04:30:08.750 --> 04:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
example I think of literary book but um
 
04:30:12.950 --> 04:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
again who makes the pre-approval of uh
 
04:30:15.309 --> 04:30:15.319 align:start position:0%
these expenses is it the scholarship
 
04:30:18.349 --> 04:30:18.359 align:start position:0%
organization the card company is there
 
04:30:20.990 --> 04:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
any conflict of interest Clause
 
04:30:23.229 --> 04:30:23.239 align:start position:0%
there those are some of the questions I
 
04:30:33.149 --> 04:30:33.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:39.670 --> 04:30:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:39.680 --> 04:30:41.910 align:start position:0%
 
preapproved

04:30:41.910 --> 04:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
preapproved
 
04:30:48.109 --> 04:30:48.119 align:start position:0%
the the um service providers are um
 
04:30:51.109 --> 04:30:51.119 align:start position:0%
entered into the system into in this
 
04:30:53.790 --> 04:30:53.800 align:start position:0%
case probably the class wallet system um
 
04:30:55.870 --> 04:30:55.880 align:start position:0%
by the uh scholarship
 
04:30:59.630 --> 04:30:59.640 align:start position:0%
organization um based on uh requests
 
04:31:02.830 --> 04:31:02.840 align:start position:0%
from the parent that uh um we're going
 
04:31:08.189 --> 04:31:08.199 align:start position:0%
to be sending a little Joey to the uh U
 
04:31:09.710 --> 04:31:09.720 align:start position:0%
well in this case not the Woodcock
 
04:31:12.389 --> 04:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
school but maybe the mafit school which
 
04:31:16.590 --> 04:31:16.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:20.109 --> 04:31:20.119 align:start position:0%
department probably a better choice I
 
04:31:22.030 --> 04:31:22.040 align:start position:0%
ask what I'm talking about is the
 
04:31:25.309 --> 04:31:25.319 align:start position:0%
pre-approval of the individ of the you
 
04:31:29.469 --> 04:31:29.479 align:start position:0%
know let's say um they go to the mfet
 
04:31:32.349 --> 04:31:32.359 align:start position:0%
school and uh they want to they want to
 
04:31:34.670 --> 04:31:34.680 align:start position:0%
purchase a a book to read for creative
 
04:31:36.109 --> 04:31:36.119 align:start position:0%
writing or something
 
04:31:39.229 --> 04:31:39.239 align:start position:0%
is the is the mafit school the people
 
04:31:42.229 --> 04:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
that pre-approve it is the scholarship
 
04:31:44.590 --> 04:31:44.600 align:start position:0%
company the one that that pre-approve it
 
04:31:46.790 --> 04:31:46.800 align:start position:0%
is the parent the one that pre-approves
 
04:31:49.469 --> 04:31:49.479 align:start position:0%
it and is there any conflict of interest
 
04:31:53.189 --> 04:31:53.199 align:start position:0%
Clause there I did ask about this
 
04:31:56.590 --> 04:31:56.600 align:start position:0%
because there was concern um parents
 
04:31:58.510 --> 04:31:58.520 align:start position:0%
very often homeschooled parents like to
 
04:32:00.590 --> 04:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
buy used books from other homeschool
 
04:32:03.550 --> 04:32:03.560 align:start position:0%
parents and I did call and ask was that
 
04:32:06.229 --> 04:32:06.239 align:start position:0%
something that would be allowed and they
 
04:32:08.790 --> 04:32:08.800 align:start position:0%
said that um what would happen is that
 
04:32:10.790 --> 04:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
the parent who wanted to sell The Used
 
04:32:14.670 --> 04:32:14.680 align:start position:0%
Books would just contact the uh

scholarship organization and the
 
04:32:19.990 --> 04:32:20.000 align:start position:0%

04:32:45.830 --> 04:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
happens in bookstores all the time no
 
04:32:46.790 --> 04:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
with the
 
04:32:49.870 --> 04:32:49.880 align:start position:0%
preapproval and and the fact that what
 
04:32:51.469 --> 04:32:51.479 align:start position:0%
they can buy and what they can't
 
04:32:53.149 --> 04:32:53.159 align:start position:0%
bookstores don't tell you what you can't
 
04:32:54.550 --> 04:32:54.560 align:start position:0%
buy and
 
04:32:58.070 --> 04:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
what uh all uh expenses are tracked in
 
04:33:01.070 --> 04:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
the system by a category uh category
 
04:33:04.789 --> 04:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
being uh the type of uh educational
 
04:33:07.070 --> 04:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
material that is being purchased or the
 
04:33:09.551 --> 04:33:09.561 align:start position:0%
service that's being purchased so you
 
04:33:11.429 --> 04:33:11.439 align:start position:0%
could uh you know if you want to find
 
04:33:13.789 --> 04:33:13.799 align:start position:0%
out how many number two pencils were
 
04:33:16.390 --> 04:33:16.400 align:start position:0%
purchased versus number three pencils uh
 
04:33:17.629 --> 04:33:17.639 align:start position:0%
you could do
 
04:33:17.639 --> 04:33:20.910 align:start position:0%
you could do
that

04:33:20.910 --> 04:33:20.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:24.629 --> 04:33:24.639 align:start position:0%
really from whom do you you find that
 
04:33:28.990 --> 04:33:29.000 align:start position:0%
out uh there are many reports standard
 
04:33:31.349 --> 04:33:31.359 align:start position:0%
within the system that will be available
 
04:33:34.470 --> 04:33:34.480 align:start position:0%
to uh both the scholarship organization
 
04:33:38.390 --> 04:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:41.029 --> 04:33:41.039 align:start position:0%
representa Le do you have a question uh
 
04:33:44.230 --> 04:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
actually I do thank you um so I'm just
 
04:33:45.910 --> 04:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
interested in just a couple of quick
 
04:33:47.510 --> 04:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
questions that just came up based on
 
04:33:50.150 --> 04:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
this so am I correct in understanding
 
04:33:51.949 --> 04:33:51.959 align:start position:0%
then that if we're using the class
 
04:33:57.709 --> 04:33:57.719 align:start position:0%
wallet system um the parent receives the
 
04:34:00.310 --> 04:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
money from the state via the scholarship
 
04:34:02.750 --> 04:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
organization okay so that's now in the
 
04:34:06.990 --> 04:34:07.000 align:start position:0%
EFA um 10% or up to 10% % can be um kept
 
04:34:09.830 --> 04:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
by the scholarship organization okay and
 
04:34:14.390 --> 04:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
now did I hear that the card company can
 
04:34:16.789 --> 04:34:16.799 align:start position:0%
also take some money off uh you know
 
04:34:19.109 --> 04:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
transaction fees is that is that true is
 
04:34:21.109 --> 04:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
that as well and that would come from
 
04:34:22.629 --> 04:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
the EFA as
 
04:34:26.789 --> 04:34:26.799 align:start position:0%
well I I believe that that's part of the
 
04:34:30.310 --> 04:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
um fees that would be charged uh from
 
04:34:32.910 --> 04:34:32.920 align:start position:0%
the class wallet system to the uh
 
04:34:34.750 --> 04:34:34.760 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization and come from
 
04:34:36.590 --> 04:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
their admin
 
04:34:38.269 --> 04:34:38.279 align:start position:0%
would be paid then by the scholarship
 
04:34:41.390 --> 04:34:41.400 align:start position:0%
organization I see okay um and and then
 
04:34:42.910 --> 04:34:42.920 align:start position:0%
just really quick on the second thing
 
04:34:45.470 --> 04:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
was there was something about um a um
 
04:34:47.189 --> 04:34:47.199 align:start position:0%
homeschooling parent who wants to sell
 
04:34:48.470 --> 04:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
their used books to another
 
04:34:51.510 --> 04:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
homeschooling parent and the first the
 
04:34:53.150 --> 04:34:53.160 align:start position:0%
one who wants to sell them needs to be
 
04:34:55.230 --> 04:34:55.240 align:start position:0%
approved um by the scholarship
 
04:34:57.750 --> 04:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
organization as you know legitimate um
 
04:34:58.869 --> 04:34:58.879 align:start position:0%
what if you want to buy your books from
 
04:35:03.789 --> 04:35:03.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:06.551 --> 04:35:06.561 align:start position:0%
approved uh yes they could be in the in
 
04:35:10.189 --> 04:35:10.199 align:start position:0%
the uh system as a service provider okay
 
04:35:11.750 --> 04:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you that's
 
04:35:15.029 --> 04:35:15.039 align:start position:0%
it represent Miler thank you Mr chair
 
04:35:16.990 --> 04:35:17.000 align:start position:0%
I've got two
 
04:35:19.150 --> 04:35:19.160 align:start position:0%
questions one of one of the concerns
 
04:35:21.150 --> 04:35:21.160 align:start position:0%
that we we have is
 
04:35:25.750 --> 04:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
that the experience of Florida
 
04:35:29.629 --> 04:35:29.639 align:start position:0%
Arizona Ohio Indiana
 
04:35:31.949 --> 04:35:31.959 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania these types of programs
 
04:35:33.830 --> 04:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
have been fraught with
 
04:35:37.869 --> 04:35:37.879 align:start position:0%
fraud and uh these states I'm assuming
 
04:35:41.750 --> 04:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
have uh learned from their
 
04:35:44.551 --> 04:35:44.561 align:start position:0%
mistakes uh with the fraudulent actions
 
04:35:45.949 --> 04:35:45.959 align:start position:0%
to taken place by some of the
 
04:35:48.470 --> 04:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
participants in these programs so my
 
04:35:51.949 --> 04:35:51.959 align:start position:0%
first question deals with are you
 
04:35:54.551 --> 04:35:54.561 align:start position:0%
convinced that the items that you have
 
04:35:56.629 --> 04:35:56.639 align:start position:0%
mentioned here in this particular
 
04:36:00.551 --> 04:36:00.561 align:start position:0%
section of the law would limit fraud
 
04:36:01.910 --> 04:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
from those
 
04:36:04.189 --> 04:36:04.199 align:start position:0%
participants I would take exception to
 
04:36:05.830 --> 04:36:05.840 align:start position:0%
your comments about about the
 
04:36:09.551 --> 04:36:09.561 align:start position:0%
substantial fraud in those locations um
 
04:36:13.150 --> 04:36:13.160 align:start position:0%
we did have testimony um about Arizona
 
04:36:16.150 --> 04:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
during the public hearing from um a
 
04:36:19.750 --> 04:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
fraudulent lobbyist um who did not uh
 
04:36:24.510 --> 04:36:24.520 align:start position:0%
give his uh full background um who
 
04:36:26.510 --> 04:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
mischaracterized uh things that had gone
 
04:36:32.750 --> 04:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
on in Arizona where um possibly uh 1% of
 
04:36:35.629 --> 04:36:35.639 align:start position:0%
the uh money was uh
 
04:36:38.789 --> 04:36:38.799 align:start position:0%
categorized as misused as per an audit
 
04:36:42.670 --> 04:36:42.680 align:start position:0%
and that is one reason why Arizona has
 
04:36:46.269 --> 04:36:46.279 align:start position:0%
um provided more administrative uh fees
 
04:36:49.029 --> 04:36:49.039 align:start position:0%
to their Department to run the operation
 
04:36:53.070 --> 04:36:53.080 align:start position:0%
and have uh uh begun implementing the
 
04:36:55.029 --> 04:36:55.039 align:start position:0%
class wallet system that we are talking
 
04:36:55.039 --> 04:36:56.150 align:start position:0%
class wallet system that we are talking
about

04:36:56.150 --> 04:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:36:58.789 --> 04:36:58.799 align:start position:0%
here well your your information my
 
04:37:00.470 --> 04:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
information differ because there has
 
04:37:03.150 --> 04:37:03.160 align:start position:0%
been in fact fraud and there's been laot
 
04:37:05.830 --> 04:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
there's been uh uh
 
04:37:07.869 --> 04:37:07.879 align:start position:0%
changes in the law as a result of that
 
04:37:09.590 --> 04:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
to protect that that's answer you
 
04:37:11.629 --> 04:37:11.639 align:start position:0%
answered my first question to me it
 
04:37:14.310 --> 04:37:14.320 align:start position:0%
still is a question second question is
 
04:37:17.789 --> 04:37:17.799 align:start position:0%
please uh outline for me what happens in
 
04:37:21.510 --> 04:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
paragraph three uh Roman numero 3 here
 
04:37:25.990 --> 04:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
that deals with a um special ed parent
 
04:37:29.709 --> 04:37:29.719 align:start position:0%
who wants to use uh an an EFA account
 
04:37:32.789 --> 04:37:32.799 align:start position:0%
and what happens to the rights the
 
04:37:35.990 --> 04:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
federal and state rights of a Disabled

Student a special education student Etc
 
04:37:42.750 --> 04:37:42.760 align:start position:0%
if I choose as a parent to come into the
 
04:37:42.760 --> 04:37:44.070 align:start position:0%
if I choose as a parent to come into the
EFA

04:37:44.070 --> 04:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
EFA
 
04:37:47.349 --> 04:37:47.359 align:start position:0%
program uh what happens to those rights
 
04:37:49.109 --> 04:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
from a state and federal standpoint that
 
04:37:53.629 --> 04:37:53.639 align:start position:0%
I have under a public education
 
04:37:57.470 --> 04:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
system we've heard many times um from
 
04:38:00.910 --> 04:38:00.920 align:start position:0%
people uh that I think wrongly U Mis
 
04:38:07.189 --> 04:38:07.199 align:start position:0%
misstate that um uh parents uh lose
 
04:38:11.230 --> 04:38:11.240 align:start position:0%
their idea Pro protections when they
 
04:38:13.869 --> 04:38:13.879 align:start position:0%
withdraw their child from a public
 
04:38:17.590 --> 04:38:17.600 align:start position:0%
school uh there are in fact
 
04:38:21.269 --> 04:38:21.279 align:start position:0%
idea uh Federal Regulations involved in
 
04:38:24.029 --> 04:38:24.039 align:start position:0%
placing a student in a private school
 
04:38:25.910 --> 04:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
it's parental placement in private
 
04:38:28.349 --> 04:38:28.359 align:start position:0%
school statutes and I'd be glad to
 
04:38:31.551 --> 04:38:31.561 align:start position:0%
provide you um copies of the law
 
04:38:37.150 --> 04:38:37.160 align:start position:0%
regarding that in which um the uh Lea
 
04:38:40.789 --> 04:38:40.799 align:start position:0%
the um the private school and the parent
 
04:38:42.869 --> 04:38:42.879 align:start position:0%
get together and come up with a service
 
04:38:47.429 --> 04:38:47.439 align:start position:0%
plan and that uh a
 
04:38:51.150 --> 04:38:51.160 align:start position:0%
percentage proportional uh percentage of
 
04:38:54.949 --> 04:38:54.959 align:start position:0%
the federal idea funds that go to that
 
04:38:54.959 --> 04:38:55.590 align:start position:0%
the federal idea funds that go to that
uh

04:38:55.590 --> 04:38:55.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:39:00.109 --> 04:39:00.119 align:start position:0%
Lea um would be provided to the uh uh
 
04:39:03.109 --> 04:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
private school for use in the service
 
04:39:06.869 --> 04:39:06.879 align:start position:0%
plan for that child that is developed so
 
04:39:11.709 --> 04:39:11.719 align:start position:0%
are you excuse me sorry that's okay um
 
04:39:16.551 --> 04:39:16.561 align:start position:0%
so for instance if there were uh 10
 
04:39:19.990 --> 04:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
students um in that Lea with
 
04:39:24.230 --> 04:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
disabilities one was placed by um a
 
04:39:28.150 --> 04:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
parent in a private school uh on10th of
 
04:39:31.470 --> 04:39:31.480 align:start position:0%
the federal monies that go to the um
 
04:39:35.990 --> 04:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
District um would be provided to the uh
 
04:39:38.350 --> 04:39:38.360 align:start position:0%
to pay for the service plan in that
 
04:39:38.360 --> 04:39:39.510 align:start position:0%
to pay for the service plan in that
private

04:39:39.510 --> 04:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
private
 
04:39:42.310 --> 04:39:42.320 align:start position:0%
school if if my child just a just a
 
04:39:45.430 --> 04:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
followup if my child had an
 
04:39:49.350 --> 04:39:49.360 align:start position:0%
IEP and chose to go to another school my
 
04:39:50.990 --> 04:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
presumption then and correct me if I'm
 
04:39:53.830 --> 04:39:53.840 align:start position:0%
wrong my presumption is is that the
 
04:39:57.350 --> 04:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
local school district then does not have
 
04:39:57.360 --> 04:39:58.868 align:start position:0%
local school district then does not have
a

04:39:58.868 --> 04:39:58.878 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:40:02.390 --> 04:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
responsibility of going and implementing
 
04:40:05.510 --> 04:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
the IEP that would be the new school
 
04:40:07.788 --> 04:40:07.798 align:start position:0%
uh unlike charter schools for example
 
04:40:09.708 --> 04:40:09.718 align:start position:0%
where the resident school district is
 
04:40:13.350 --> 04:40:13.360 align:start position:0%
responsible for that IEP in this
 
04:40:16.230 --> 04:40:16.240 align:start position:0%
instance the new school the new service
 
04:40:18.550 --> 04:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
provider if you may they would be
 
04:40:21.350 --> 04:40:21.360 align:start position:0%
responsible for whatever the parent and
 
04:40:23.948 --> 04:40:23.958 align:start position:0%
that service provider would uh develop
 
04:40:26.270 --> 04:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
for the uh special needs of that
 
04:40:28.590 --> 04:40:28.600 align:start position:0%
particular student is that
 
04:40:32.868 --> 04:40:32.878 align:start position:0%
correct the parent um as we heard in
 
04:40:35.510 --> 04:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
testimony from I think it was the lady
 
04:40:40.430 --> 04:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
in from Arizona um who has an Esa and uh
 
04:40:44.110 --> 04:40:44.120 align:start position:0%
a child with disabilities uh yes they U
 
04:40:47.350 --> 04:40:47.360 align:start position:0%
worked out with uh different service
 
04:40:50.788 --> 04:40:50.798 align:start position:0%
providers for the best uh Services uh
 
04:40:53.110 --> 04:40:53.120 align:start position:0%
they could find for their child with
 
04:40:55.390 --> 04:40:55.400 align:start position:0%
disabilities um and paid for it with
 
04:40:59.190 --> 04:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
their um Esa you know including uh any
 
04:41:02.708 --> 04:41:02.718 align:start position:0%
kind of therapies or special tutors Etc
 
04:41:05.470 --> 04:41:05.480 align:start position:0%
that the parent might feel appropriate
 
04:41:08.550 --> 04:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
so the so the answer is my question was
 
04:41:11.430 --> 04:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
the local school district does not have
 
04:41:14.510 --> 04:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
any responsibility for that
 
04:41:18.868 --> 04:41:18.878 align:start position:0%
child e the the IEP when they leave the
 
04:41:22.030 --> 04:41:22.040 align:start position:0%
school district with the EFA is that's
 
04:41:25.350 --> 04:41:25.360 align:start position:0%
correct right yes thank you that's what
 
04:41:26.628 --> 04:41:26.638 align:start position:0%
my question
 
04:41:30.230 --> 04:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
was I might add to represent Myer that
 
04:41:32.670 --> 04:41:32.680 align:start position:0%
in developing a service plan part of
 
04:41:35.670 --> 04:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
that idea money that's used for
 
04:41:38.390 --> 04:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
developing service plans and looking to
 
04:41:40.550 --> 04:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
help kids which are not in the regular
 
04:41:44.190 --> 04:41:44.200 align:start position:0%
school but have IEPs is reserved by the
 
04:41:46.948 --> 04:41:46.958 align:start position:0%
department it's not that much money but
 
04:41:49.670 --> 04:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
it is available to assist kids in uh
 
04:41:53.628 --> 04:41:53.638 align:start position:0%
attaining their IEPs through as we've
 
04:42:00.310 --> 04:42:00.320 align:start position:0%

page six but it was tied right in with
 
04:43:01.670 --> 04:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
this question we'll go to we'll go to
 
04:43:01.680 --> 04:43:03.470 align:start position:0%
this question we'll go to we'll go to
page

04:43:03.470 --> 04:43:03.480 align:start position:0%
page
 
04:43:03.480 --> 04:43:06.230 align:start position:0%
page
six

04:43:06.230 --> 04:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
six
 
04:43:09.868 --> 04:43:09.878 align:start position:0%
so so thank you very much Mr chair so so
 
04:43:11.750 --> 04:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
um sort of following on On
 
04:43:13.948 --> 04:43:13.958 align:start position:0%
representative Myer's question with
 
04:43:18.190 --> 04:43:18.200 align:start position:0%
regards to um to uh being able to detect
 
04:43:21.670 --> 04:43:21.680 align:start position:0%
substantial misuse of the funds I I was
 
04:43:24.350 --> 04:43:24.360 align:start position:0%
just wondering how adding um the
 
04:43:26.310 --> 04:43:26.320 align:start position:0%
requirement to prove that it was
 
04:43:28.708 --> 04:43:28.718 align:start position:0%
intentional how that um how that's
 
04:43:31.070 --> 04:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
proven and how that helps to uh far it
 
04:43:31.080 --> 04:43:33.470 align:start position:0%
proven and how that helps to uh far it
out

04:43:33.470 --> 04:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:33.480 --> 04:43:36.708 align:start position:0%
 
fraud

04:43:36.708 --> 04:43:36.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:39.310 --> 04:43:39.320 align:start position:0%
was intentional and substantial
 
04:43:42.948 --> 04:43:42.958 align:start position:0%
misuse are are you asking for what
 
04:43:45.788 --> 04:43:45.798 align:start position:0%
intentional means no I I know what
 
04:43:48.510 --> 04:43:48.520 align:start position:0%
intentional means but but um you know
 
04:43:51.430 --> 04:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
this is this is going to turn into a law
 
04:43:54.628 --> 04:43:54.638 align:start position:0%
so so obviously intentional is something
 
04:43:57.070 --> 04:43:57.080 align:start position:0%
that would have to be proven and so I'm
 
04:43:59.948 --> 04:43:59.958 align:start position:0%
referring to page six line7 and this is
 
04:44:02.150 --> 04:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
specifically as it results I mean as it
 
04:44:04.390 --> 04:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
relates to the misuse of funds which
 
04:44:05.550 --> 04:44:05.560 align:start position:0%
which I think is what representative
 
04:44:08.350 --> 04:44:08.360 align:start position:0%
Miler was talking about so so in this
 
04:44:10.550 --> 04:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
amendment the word in the words
 
04:44:14.510 --> 04:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
intentional and were were added as an
 
04:44:18.628 --> 04:44:18.638 align:start position:0%
additional um uh hurdle uh in in in
 
04:44:21.190 --> 04:44:21.200 align:start position:0%
determining or improving substantial
 
04:44:23.830 --> 04:44:23.840 align:start position:0%
misuse of funds so I was just wondering
 
04:44:26.150 --> 04:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
what what um what prompted that
 
04:44:28.390 --> 04:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
additional hurdle to make it a little
 
04:44:31.150 --> 04:44:31.160 align:start position:0%
bit harder or maybe a lot harder to uh
 
04:44:33.350 --> 04:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
to determine
 
04:44:33.360 --> 04:44:35.510 align:start position:0%
to determine
fraud

04:44:35.510 --> 04:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
fraud
 
04:44:35.520 --> 04:44:36.788 align:start position:0%
fraud
a

04:44:36.788 --> 04:44:36.798 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:44:42.470 --> 04:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh uh legal advice uh suggested uh the
 
04:44:42.480 --> 04:44:45.030 align:start position:0%
uh uh legal advice uh suggested uh the
word

04:44:45.030 --> 04:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:50.310 --> 04:44:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:54.590 --> 04:44:54.600 align:start position:0%
purpose for for what for what I'm sorry
 
04:44:59.310 --> 04:44:59.320 align:start position:0%
for what purpose uh uh basically that uh
 
04:45:00.868 --> 04:45:00.878 align:start position:0%
uh an
 
04:45:05.390 --> 04:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
unintentional uh charge of uh an exp
 
04:45:09.510 --> 04:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
um would not uh facilitate contacting
 
04:45:13.310 --> 04:45:13.320 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office um you
 
04:45:16.788 --> 04:45:16.798 align:start position:0%
we're looking for intentional uh misuse
 
04:45:21.190 --> 04:45:21.200 align:start position:0%
um just like with um a uh uh School
 
04:45:26.190 --> 04:45:26.200 align:start position:0%
District in uh my County um that uh
 
04:45:29.470 --> 04:45:29.480 align:start position:0%
mischarged uh the federal government for
 
04:45:34.110 --> 04:45:34.120 align:start position:0%
a lunch program for a number of years um
 
04:45:38.550 --> 04:45:38.560 align:start position:0%
uh was investigated but the uh um I'm
 
04:45:41.628 --> 04:45:41.638 align:start position:0%
not sure if it was deemed unintentional
 
04:45:45.270 --> 04:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
but uh was not fined uh by the uh
 
04:45:48.430 --> 04:45:48.440 align:start position:0%
federal government um so I think
 
04:45:53.270 --> 04:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
intentional is um a key um insertion
 
04:45:55.788 --> 04:45:55.798 align:start position:0%
here did your just a followup on that
 
04:45:58.948 --> 04:45:58.958 align:start position:0%
did your did your attorney give you a a
 
04:46:03.070 --> 04:46:03.080 align:start position:0%
um legal basis for proving
 
04:46:07.070 --> 04:46:07.080 align:start position:0%
intent uh they did not um but I'm sure
 
04:46:09.628 --> 04:46:09.638 align:start position:0%
you could um you know help us and find
 
04:46:11.030 --> 04:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
an attorney that would give us that
 
04:46:11.040 --> 04:46:14.628 align:start position:0%
an attorney that would give us that
legal

04:46:14.628 --> 04:46:14.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:23.708 --> 04:46:23.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:27.788 --> 04:46:27.798 align:start position:0%
Tanner thank you um is there any penalty
 
04:46:30.830 --> 04:46:30.840 align:start position:0%
other than they just don't get the
 
04:46:34.990 --> 04:46:35.000 align:start position:0%
EFA anymore for intentional and sub
 
04:46:38.470 --> 04:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
substantial uh misuse of funds is there
 
04:46:41.948 --> 04:46:41.958 align:start position:0%
any any penalty have to repay the
 
04:46:44.708 --> 04:46:44.718 align:start position:0%
fund there is a provision for referral
 
04:46:46.548 --> 04:46:46.558 align:start position:0%
to the department and to the Attorney
 
04:46:46.558 --> 04:46:48.230 align:start position:0%
to the department and to the Attorney
General's

04:46:48.230 --> 04:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
General's
 
04:46:50.190 --> 04:46:50.200 align:start position:0%
office and they would make the
 
04:46:53.310 --> 04:46:53.320 align:start position:0%
determination as to what the penalty was
 
04:46:55.910 --> 04:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
I mean in other pieces of legislation we
 
04:46:59.310 --> 04:46:59.320 align:start position:0%
have you know um that it's a felony for
 
04:47:02.310 --> 04:47:02.320 align:start position:0%
certain things or um you know we've
 
04:47:04.990 --> 04:47:05.000 align:start position:0%
actually put in fines
 
04:47:07.548 --> 04:47:07.558 align:start position:0%
um and all I see in here is that they
 
04:47:10.708 --> 04:47:10.718 align:start position:0%
lose their EFA I I think that they would
 
04:47:12.628 --> 04:47:12.638 align:start position:0%
be uh the Attorney General's office
 
04:47:15.470 --> 04:47:15.480 align:start position:0%
would be capable of determining what the
 
04:47:18.390 --> 04:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
uh charge and offense would
 
04:47:21.510 --> 04:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
be and I I believe that's alluded to on
 
04:47:24.590 --> 04:47:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:24.600 --> 04:47:28.868 align:start position:0%
 
27

04:47:28.868 --> 04:47:28.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:28.878 --> 04:47:31.270 align:start position:0%
 
who

04:47:31.270 --> 04:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
who
 
04:47:34.548 --> 04:47:34.558 align:start position:0%
process which is process but when you're
 
04:47:36.510 --> 04:47:36.520 align:start position:0%
talking about a fraudulent use once the
 
04:47:41.590 --> 04:47:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:45.430 --> 04:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
consequences uh next question from
 
04:47:49.350 --> 04:47:49.360 align:start position:0%
uh let's go back to representative
 
04:47:51.670 --> 04:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
Woodcock are you're next representative
 
04:47:53.470 --> 04:47:53.480 align:start position:0%
Le I haven't forgotten you out there no
 
04:47:53.480 --> 04:47:54.270 align:start position:0%
Le I haven't forgotten you out there no
that's

04:47:54.270 --> 04:47:54.280 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:47:58.270 --> 04:47:58.280 align:start position:0%
fine thank you um representative lad uh
 
04:48:00.948 --> 04:48:00.958 align:start position:0%
just two clarifications simply one on
 
04:48:04.830 --> 04:48:04.840 align:start position:0%
the intentional and substantial area uh
 
04:48:08.350 --> 04:48:08.360 align:start position:0%
if it was uh an unintentional error uh
 
04:48:09.510 --> 04:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
and I don't know what you determine
 
04:48:11.430 --> 04:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
substantial is but I make an
 
04:48:14.350 --> 04:48:14.360 align:start position:0%
unintentional error of of $750
 
04:48:18.150 --> 04:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
$1,000 and is there is there a way
 
04:48:20.310 --> 04:48:20.320 align:start position:0%
requirement that that be paid back I
 
04:48:21.990 --> 04:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
didn't do it intentionally but I don't
 
04:48:23.390 --> 04:48:23.400 align:start position:0%
want to get thrown out the program but I
 
04:48:25.430 --> 04:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
made it I made a purchase error of$
 
04:48:28.070 --> 04:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
thousand wrong is what's what's the
 
04:48:28.080 --> 04:48:32.110 align:start position:0%
thousand wrong is what's what's the
process

04:48:32.110 --> 04:48:32.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:35.190 --> 04:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
there I am uh
 
04:48:37.670 --> 04:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
sure that that would be adjusted through
 
04:48:40.948 --> 04:48:40.958 align:start position:0%
the class wallet system and that that's
 
04:48:46.628 --> 04:48:46.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:49.150 --> 04:48:49.160 align:start position:0%
it that that that's stated in this law I
 
04:48:52.310 --> 04:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
didn't see that that's why I
 
04:48:54.948 --> 04:48:54.958 align:start position:0%
asked representative Woodcock we've had
 
04:48:57.310 --> 04:48:57.320 align:start position:0%
a number of situations uh and the one
 
04:49:00.310 --> 04:49:00.320 align:start position:0%
that represent cordelli alluded to was
 
04:49:02.910 --> 04:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid in schools and how uh
 
04:49:04.788 --> 04:49:04.798 align:start position:0%
school districts were
 
04:49:07.350 --> 04:49:07.360 align:start position:0%
misinterpreting uh how to assess the
 
04:49:10.270 --> 04:49:10.280 align:start position:0%
need for this and they were billing and
 
04:49:13.070 --> 04:49:13.080 align:start position:0%
the billing had not been uh recommended
 
04:49:15.470 --> 04:49:15.480 align:start position:0%
by a person qualified to make that
 
04:49:17.948 --> 04:49:17.958 align:start position:0%
determination as you may recall I think
 
04:49:19.910 --> 04:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
all school districts were caught up in
 
04:49:23.190 --> 04:49:23.200 align:start position:0%
this and of course the the concern was
 
04:49:26.070 --> 04:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
primarily that of the department uh that
 
04:49:28.230 --> 04:49:28.240 align:start position:0%
if they allowed this to continue then we
 
04:49:31.030 --> 04:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
could lose other Federal grant monies uh
 
04:49:34.590 --> 04:49:34.600 align:start position:0%
so that it was corrected by uh rebaking
 
04:49:36.948 --> 04:49:36.958 align:start position:0%
the rules with working with health and
 
04:49:41.590 --> 04:49:41.600 align:start position:0%
human services and uh we're now on
 
04:49:43.270 --> 04:49:43.280 align:start position:0%
smooth territory that's been fixed
 
04:49:45.910 --> 04:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
nobody had to end up paying money we we
 
04:49:48.670 --> 04:49:48.680 align:start position:0%
continued forward so I I would hope that
 
04:49:50.948 --> 04:49:50.958 align:start position:0%
most of these activities would be
 
04:49:53.310 --> 04:49:53.320 align:start position:0%
rectified in a manner similar to what
 
04:49:55.110 --> 04:49:55.120 align:start position:0%
we've had experience in the public
 
04:49:57.910 --> 04:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
schools with okay and the last the last
 
04:49:59.350 --> 04:49:59.360 align:start position:0%
question on this page for me if I may Mr
 
04:50:02.548 --> 04:50:02.558 align:start position:0%
chairman on line 13 um when they're
 
04:50:05.628 --> 04:50:05.638 align:start position:0%
talking about the a minimum of minimum
 
04:50:09.430 --> 04:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
of random uh independent audits Rick do
 
04:50:12.070 --> 04:50:12.080 align:start position:0%
we know if random minimum is is like one
 
04:50:14.350 --> 04:50:14.360 align:start position:0%
annually or five what historically what
 
04:50:16.708 --> 04:50:16.718 align:start position:0%
do they do in the other the other areas
 
04:50:18.190 --> 04:50:18.200 align:start position:0%
what what is that number is a
 
04:50:21.030 --> 04:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
substantial number or it's just free
 
04:50:23.948 --> 04:50:23.958 align:start position:0%
floating it's an annual audit you'll see
 
04:50:27.110 --> 04:50:27.120 align:start position:0%
in the next line down on the number how
 
04:50:29.590 --> 04:50:29.600 align:start position:0%
many random audits that's the question
 
04:50:31.910 --> 04:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
what's the what does minimum mean one
 
04:50:34.110 --> 04:50:34.120 align:start position:0%
five 10 100 what does it mean who
 
04:50:36.470 --> 04:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
determines it who determines it thank
 
04:50:40.150 --> 04:50:40.160 align:start position:0%
you what what is it what's the
 
04:50:42.510 --> 04:50:42.520 align:start position:0%
number are you asking about random
 
04:50:42.520 --> 04:50:44.030 align:start position:0%
number are you asking about random
audits

04:50:44.030 --> 04:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
audits
 
04:50:46.910 --> 04:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
um I'm ask I'm asking a line 13
 
04:50:50.190 --> 04:50:50.200 align:start position:0%
represented page six when it says Min
 
04:50:52.948 --> 04:50:52.958 align:start position:0%
minimum number I'm just asking sh a
 
04:50:55.350 --> 04:50:55.360 align:start position:0%
minimum that's the minimum requirement
 
04:50:57.110 --> 04:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
not a minimum number it's a minimum
 
04:51:00.150 --> 04:51:00.160 align:start position:0%
requirement that they conduct random
 
04:51:01.910 --> 04:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
audits understand that minimum
 
04:51:04.230 --> 04:51:04.240 align:start position:0%
requirement they conduct random audits
 
04:51:07.430 --> 04:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
my question is how many random audits do
 
04:51:09.868 --> 04:51:09.878 align:start position:0%
they do at least one
 
04:51:09.878 --> 04:51:11.948 align:start position:0%
they do at least one
annually

04:51:11.948 --> 04:51:11.958 align:start position:0%
annually
 
04:51:15.628 --> 04:51:15.638 align:start position:0%
one one out of all these potential
 
04:51:17.070 --> 04:51:17.080 align:start position:0%
thousands of students that may take
 
04:51:21.030 --> 04:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
thisam an Ann an annual audit annually
 
04:51:23.070 --> 04:51:23.080 align:start position:0%
is the minimum
 
04:51:25.910 --> 04:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
requirement one out of thousands thank
 
04:51:28.270 --> 04:51:28.280 align:start position:0%
you one I'm not sure what you mean by
 
04:51:31.310 --> 04:51:31.320 align:start position:0%
one out of thousands um if I can address
 
04:51:32.910 --> 04:51:32.920 align:start position:0%
this from a data management point of
 
04:51:35.230 --> 04:51:35.240 align:start position:0%
view the minimum number would depend
 
04:51:36.948 --> 04:51:36.958 align:start position:0%
based upon the complexity this isn't
 
04:51:38.590 --> 04:51:38.600 align:start position:0%
something we can put in statute if
 
04:51:40.390 --> 04:51:40.400 align:start position:0%
there's a more complexity to it the
 
04:51:43.390 --> 04:51:43.400 align:start position:0%
minimum number to audit would be higher
 
04:51:45.070 --> 04:51:45.080 align:start position:0%
than if everything was very simple and
 
04:51:47.070 --> 04:51:47.080 align:start position:0%
straightforward this is going to depend
 
04:51:48.868 --> 04:51:48.878 align:start position:0%
upon the level of data and this isn't
 
04:51:50.948 --> 04:51:50.958 align:start position:0%
something we can foresee at this time
 
04:51:50.958 --> 04:51:53.150 align:start position:0%
something we can foresee at this time
thank

04:51:53.150 --> 04:51:53.160 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:51:57.270 --> 04:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
you uh ref Le thank you Mr chairman um
 
04:51:59.110 --> 04:51:59.120 align:start position:0%
just as a point I disagree with the
 
04:52:01.430 --> 04:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
prior statement the the law could easily
 
04:52:04.910 --> 04:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
State 20% of all EFA shall be audited on
 
04:52:07.270 --> 04:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
a randomized basis every year there's
 
04:52:08.868 --> 04:52:08.878 align:start position:0%
nothing to prevent that right now the
 
04:52:11.470 --> 04:52:11.480 align:start position:0%
way I read this and I again I'll follow
 
04:52:13.190 --> 04:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
on following on representative Woodcock
 
04:52:15.510 --> 04:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
shall at a minimum conduct random
 
04:52:18.190 --> 04:52:18.200 align:start position:0%
independent audits it does not State how
 
04:52:20.548 --> 04:52:20.558 align:start position:0%
many the scholarship or is it correct
 
04:52:22.390 --> 04:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
the scholarship organization could
 
04:52:24.628 --> 04:52:24.638 align:start position:0%
conclude that they meet that requirement
 
04:52:28.430 --> 04:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
by auditing one EFA per
 
04:52:30.830 --> 04:52:30.840 align:start position:0%
year we have the issue of garbage in
 
04:52:32.830 --> 04:52:32.840 align:start position:0%
garbage out if you mandate a minimum
 
04:52:32.840 --> 04:52:40.510 align:start position:0%
garbage out if you mandate a minimum
number

04:52:40.510 --> 04:52:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:43.868 --> 04:52:43.878 align:start position:0%
I um you have your hand uper my time to
 
04:52:46.788 --> 04:52:46.798 align:start position:0%
representative Leon represent up thank
 
04:52:49.030 --> 04:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
you go ahead thank you as as an
 
04:52:51.990 --> 04:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
economist and as a data analyst this is
 
04:52:53.830 --> 04:52:53.840 align:start position:0%
something that you could specify that
 
04:52:55.270 --> 04:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
but that does not mean that it is
 
04:52:58.110 --> 04:52:58.120 align:start position:0%
Meaningful or useful information this is
 
04:52:59.548 --> 04:52:59.558 align:start position:0%
something that would come through the
 
04:53:02.190 --> 04:53:02.200 align:start position:0%
general oversight of it in the RFP where
 
04:53:03.910 --> 04:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
they could look to this and spell it out
 
04:53:06.150 --> 04:53:06.160 align:start position:0%
based upon the actual data that they are
 
04:53:08.270 --> 04:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
that they are facing this is not
 
04:53:10.070 --> 04:53:10.080 align:start position:0%
something that can reasonably be
 
04:53:12.310 --> 04:53:12.320 align:start position:0%
mandated at this
 
04:53:15.910 --> 04:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
point I'm sorry I I missed all that I my
 
04:53:17.670 --> 04:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
internet just cut out all I heard was
 
04:53:19.750 --> 04:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
something mandated at this point what I
 
04:53:21.708 --> 04:53:21.718 align:start position:0%
said is that as an economist and as a
 
04:53:24.270 --> 04:53:24.280 align:start position:0%
data analyst I know that you can set a
 
04:53:26.868 --> 04:53:26.878 align:start position:0%
set a certain level prescriptively but
 
04:53:28.788 --> 04:53:28.798 align:start position:0%
that does not mean that it is useful
 
04:53:30.670 --> 04:53:30.680 align:start position:0%
information this is something that in
 
04:53:33.708 --> 04:53:33.718 align:start position:0%
the RFP process it can be better
 
04:53:36.110 --> 04:53:36.120 align:start position:0%
addressed than we can do here today I'm
 
04:53:38.948 --> 04:53:38.958 align:start position:0%
react to this if you if you look down on
 
04:53:42.788 --> 04:53:42.798 align:start position:0%
the top of page seven in regard to all
 
04:53:46.110 --> 04:53:46.120 align:start position:0%
this the board sh of Education shall
 
04:53:48.910 --> 04:53:48.920 align:start position:0%
adopt rules pursuant to RSA 541a
 
04:53:51.628 --> 04:53:51.638 align:start position:0%
relative to the EFA program the
 
04:53:54.270 --> 04:53:54.280 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization May adapt rules
 
04:53:56.390 --> 04:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
or procedures that are necessary for the
 
04:53:58.548 --> 04:53:58.558 align:start position:0%
administration of this chapter and this
 
04:54:02.470 --> 04:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
is a Roman numeral uh 16 in that chapter
 
04:54:04.150 --> 04:54:04.160 align:start position:0%
this may include guidel
 
04:54:06.628 --> 04:54:06.638 align:start position:0%
procedures so it looks like there's the
 
04:54:09.590 --> 04:54:09.600 align:start position:0%
ability to develop once we know for
 
04:54:12.350 --> 04:54:12.360 align:start position:0%
example that there's X number it's just
 
04:54:13.830 --> 04:54:13.840 align:start position:0%
like if we're going to do a survey of
 
04:54:16.628 --> 04:54:16.638 align:start position:0%
our faulty buildings in this state we're
 
04:54:17.830 --> 04:54:17.840 align:start position:0%
not going to put down we're going to
 
04:54:20.708 --> 04:54:20.718 align:start position:0%
have to do a random you know of of 10 or
 
04:54:22.470 --> 04:54:22.480 align:start position:0%
so we got to First find out how many are
 
04:54:25.390 --> 04:54:25.400 align:start position:0%
faulty and and then on you go before you
 
04:54:28.670 --> 04:54:28.680 align:start position:0%
go represent LE right I I I I understand
 
04:54:29.990 --> 04:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
what you're saying here but this is
 
04:54:33.070 --> 04:54:33.080 align:start position:0%
public money that is being utilized and
 
04:54:35.830 --> 04:54:35.840 align:start position:0%
as a taxpayer I want to know where the
 
04:54:38.270 --> 04:54:38.280 align:start position:0%
public money is going and if there is no
 
04:54:40.230 --> 04:54:40.240 align:start position:0%
requirement here and right now I do not
 
04:54:42.788 --> 04:54:42.798 align:start position:0%
see anything other than an absolutely
 
04:54:42.798 --> 04:54:45.030 align:start position:0%
see anything other than an absolutely
minimal

04:54:45.030 --> 04:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
minimal
 
04:54:48.390 --> 04:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
requirement for auditing any efas and by
 
04:54:49.948 --> 04:54:49.958 align:start position:0%
the way I also don't see any requirement
 
04:54:51.470 --> 04:54:51.480 align:start position:0%
for the auditing of the scholarship
 
04:54:55.190 --> 04:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
organization either um you're basically
 
04:54:57.548 --> 04:54:57.558 align:start position:0%
giving away potentially giving away
 
04:54:57.558 --> 04:54:58.590 align:start position:0%
giving away potentially giving away
public

04:54:58.590 --> 04:54:58.600 align:start position:0%
public
 
04:55:01.310 --> 04:55:01.320 align:start position:0%
monies well I think that in regard to
 
04:55:02.590 --> 04:55:02.600 align:start position:0%
for example what I've mentioned at
 
04:55:04.270 --> 04:55:04.280 align:start position:0%
several hearings already
 
04:55:06.868 --> 04:55:06.878 align:start position:0%
that there are many doe2 forms which are
 
04:55:10.628 --> 04:55:10.638 align:start position:0%
submitted that are audited but there's a
 
04:55:13.788 --> 04:55:13.798 align:start position:0%
number that aren't and I I I think if
 
04:55:15.070 --> 04:55:15.080 align:start position:0%
you were to ask folks over the
 
04:55:17.230 --> 04:55:17.240 align:start position:0%
Department of Education would it be wise
 
04:55:20.350 --> 04:55:20.360 align:start position:0%
for these all to be audited they say yes
 
04:55:22.430 --> 04:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
but right now there's a number of errors
 
04:55:24.990 --> 04:55:25.000 align:start position:0%
that can come in and perhaps we all have
 
04:55:26.310 --> 04:55:26.320 align:start position:0%
the same requirement that you're
 
04:55:29.110 --> 04:55:29.120 align:start position:0%
speaking to here for the public schools
 
04:55:30.628 --> 04:55:30.638 align:start position:0%
as well when they're submitting their
 
04:55:30.638 --> 04:55:32.390 align:start position:0%
as well when they're submitting their
annual

04:55:32.390 --> 04:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
annual
 
04:55:34.910 --> 04:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
reports they also are audited by the
 
04:55:37.110 --> 04:55:37.120 align:start position:0%
fact that they report to public bodies
 
04:55:39.788 --> 04:55:39.798 align:start position:0%
including their their school boards and
 
04:55:41.470 --> 04:55:41.480 align:start position:0%
the fact that they report to their
 
04:55:44.110 --> 04:55:44.120 align:start position:0%
voters as well whereas in this case
 
04:55:46.788 --> 04:55:46.798 align:start position:0%
there is no such reporting and wouldn't
 
04:55:49.030 --> 04:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
it be nice if they reported to parents
 
04:55:51.190 --> 04:55:51.200 align:start position:0%
as well parents are
 
04:55:53.230 --> 04:55:53.240 align:start position:0%
voters representa
 
04:55:56.548 --> 04:55:56.558 align:start position:0%
Tanner thank you um I guess I have uh
 
04:55:59.590 --> 04:55:59.600 align:start position:0%
two two questions on this one would be
 
04:56:02.150 --> 04:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
so what is best practice as far as
 
04:56:04.110 --> 04:56:04.120 align:start position:0%
setting up audits uh the number of
 
04:56:06.670 --> 04:56:06.680 align:start position:0%
random audits considering that we'll
 
04:56:10.350 --> 04:56:10.360 align:start position:0%
have uh we have an approximation of
 
04:56:13.510 --> 04:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
students that could possibly be um
 
04:56:15.670 --> 04:56:15.680 align:start position:0%
eligible for this number one and second
 
04:56:18.868 --> 04:56:18.878 align:start position:0%
of all who's going to write the new
 
04:56:26.868 --> 04:56:26.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:30.510 --> 04:56:30.520 align:start position:0%
organization what page is that
 
04:56:33.270 --> 04:56:33.280 align:start position:0%
on well it was mentioned by uh
 
04:56:36.070 --> 04:56:36.080 align:start position:0%
representative Lon that
 
04:56:39.310 --> 04:56:39.320 align:start position:0%
um the number of audits and and the
 
04:56:41.910 --> 04:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
procedure and you you spoke to the fact
 
04:56:44.150 --> 04:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
that the uh scholarship fund was going
 
04:56:45.750 --> 04:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
to set up rules and
 
04:56:48.750 --> 04:56:48.760 align:start position:0%
regulations um I'm and she mentioned
 
04:56:50.548 --> 04:56:50.558 align:start position:0%
that it would be in the RFP I'm just
 
04:56:53.670 --> 04:56:53.680 align:start position:0%
wondering who is in charge of making up
 
04:56:53.680 --> 04:56:54.590 align:start position:0%
wondering who is in charge of making up
the

04:56:54.590 --> 04:56:54.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:56:59.230 --> 04:56:59.240 align:start position:0%
RFP um and what would be the best
 
04:57:03.590 --> 04:57:03.600 align:start position:0%
practices uh from a risk management or
 
04:57:07.110 --> 04:57:07.120 align:start position:0%
data analyst point of view uh for audits
 
04:57:08.708 --> 04:57:08.718 align:start position:0%
the number of random
 
04:57:11.390 --> 04:57:11.400 align:start position:0%
audits um that is a question best about
 
04:57:13.750 --> 04:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
best practices I'm not sure how many
 
04:57:15.750 --> 04:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
statisticians we have on this committee
 
04:57:17.430 --> 04:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
but I believe that this is the sort of
 
04:57:19.350 --> 04:57:19.360 align:start position:0%
thing that should be handled through the
 
04:57:21.110 --> 04:57:21.120 align:start position:0%
guidelines that are already provided for
 
04:57:23.110 --> 04:57:23.120 align:start position:0%
in this bill because that falls better
 
04:57:29.310 --> 04:57:29.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:32.708 --> 04:57:32.718 align:start position:0%
Education okay next individual uh
 
04:57:32.718 --> 04:57:39.190 align:start position:0%
Education okay next individual uh
representative

04:57:39.190 --> 04:57:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:42.628 --> 04:57:42.638 align:start position:0%
Tanner she or represent Miler uh thank
 
04:57:44.868 --> 04:57:44.878 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman I just want to point a
 
04:57:47.548 --> 04:57:47.558 align:start position:0%
clarification before we go on in the
 
04:57:50.270 --> 04:57:50.280 align:start position:0%
meantime I've been doing some checking
 
04:57:52.230 --> 04:57:52.240 align:start position:0%
on the issue of special
 
04:57:55.270 --> 04:57:55.280 align:start position:0%
education and I have found that the
 
04:57:59.708 --> 04:57:59.718 align:start position:0%
federal idea money can only be used for
 
04:58:02.830 --> 04:58:02.840 align:start position:0%
students in public schools not in this
 
04:58:05.270 --> 04:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
program progam cannot leave Public
 
04:58:07.590 --> 04:58:07.600 align:start position:0%
Schools they have to if they want to
 
04:58:11.150 --> 04:58:11.160 align:start position:0%
take advantage of the I idea money it's
 
04:58:13.670 --> 04:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
only in public education Public Schools
 
04:58:13.680 --> 04:58:16.670 align:start position:0%
only in public education Public Schools
thank

04:58:16.670 --> 04:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:21.030 --> 04:58:21.040 align:start position:0%
you representative uh Lakers you got
 
04:58:24.948 --> 04:58:24.958 align:start position:0%
your hand up we go
 
04:58:30.430 --> 04:58:30.440 align:start position:0%
um yes but children right now get um
 
04:58:33.548 --> 04:58:33.558 align:start position:0%
Services Etc provided by private schools
 
04:58:35.230 --> 04:58:35.240 align:start position:0%
and so that would still be something a
 
04:58:37.868 --> 04:58:37.878 align:start position:0%
parent would negotiate but the other
 
04:58:42.150 --> 04:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
part I was going to comment on was that
 
04:58:47.430 --> 04:58:47.440 align:start position:0%
we we legislators pass laws all the time
 
04:58:50.390 --> 04:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
and they're generally open because we
 
04:58:52.430 --> 04:58:52.440 align:start position:0%
can't foresee all the things so we make
 
04:58:55.750 --> 04:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
them General and then whoever is
 
04:58:58.310 --> 04:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
enacting them makes the rules and the
 
04:59:01.990 --> 04:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
rules go before Jael car Etc and so in
 
04:59:04.910 --> 04:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
this case we the rules will come after
 
04:59:06.708 --> 04:59:06.718 align:start position:0%
this we're putting the policy the
 
04:59:09.510 --> 04:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
general guidelines and then the State
 
04:59:12.590 --> 04:59:12.600 align:start position:0%
Board of Education will adopt rules the
 
04:59:14.788 --> 04:59:14.798 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization May adopt
 
04:59:17.750 --> 04:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
guidelines or procedures but we're still
 
04:59:21.310 --> 04:59:21.320 align:start position:0%
having oversight of this by the um
 
04:59:23.910 --> 04:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Education which if you
 
04:59:23.920 --> 04:59:24.830 align:start position:0%
Department of Education which if you
think

04:59:24.830 --> 04:59:24.840 align:start position:0%
think
 
04:59:27.430 --> 04:59:27.440 align:start position:0%
about at least the commissioner is
 
04:59:29.990 --> 04:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
appointed by an elected official so it's
 
04:59:31.990 --> 04:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
still just like a superintendent is
 
04:59:36.510 --> 04:59:36.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:39.830 --> 04:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
official represent
 
04:59:44.390 --> 04:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
cordelli yes in terms of uh re Myer's
 
04:59:49.190 --> 04:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
question about um uh the use of funds
 
04:59:51.230 --> 04:59:51.240 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
04:59:54.788 --> 04:59:54.798 align:start position:0%
quoting um children enrolled in a
 
04:59:56.788 --> 04:59:56.798 align:start position:0%
private school by
 
04:59:59.390 --> 04:59:59.400 align:start position:0%
parents um let me see if I can find the
 
04:59:59.400 --> 05:00:00.670 align:start position:0%
parents um let me see if I can find the
right

05:00:00.670 --> 05:00:00.680 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:00:05.190 --> 05:00:05.200 align:start position:0%
section uh amounts to be expended for
 
05:00:06.830 --> 05:00:06.840 align:start position:0%
the provision of these
 
05:00:09.948 --> 05:00:09.958 align:start position:0%
services including Direct Services to a
 
05:00:12.430 --> 05:00:12.440 align:start position:0%
parentally placed private school
 
05:00:16.390 --> 05:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
children by the educational agency shall
 
05:00:18.310 --> 05:00:18.320 align:start position:0%
be equal to the proportionate amount of
 
05:00:20.548 --> 05:00:20.558 align:start position:0%
federal funds May available under this
 
05:00:23.788 --> 05:00:23.798 align:start position:0%
chapter in calculating a proportionate
 
05:00:25.990 --> 05:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
amount of federal funds the local
 
05:00:26.000 --> 05:00:27.310 align:start position:0%

Agency um shall go through a child fly
 
05:00:34.310 --> 05:00:34.320 align:start position:0%
process to make sure that they know how
 
05:00:37.190 --> 05:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
many uh children with disabilities are
 
05:00:42.910 --> 05:00:42.920 align:start position:0%
in the Lea and then uh divide the um
 
05:00:45.150 --> 05:00:45.160 align:start position:0%
number by the total amount of federal
 
05:00:48.510 --> 05:00:48.520 align:start position:0%
funds to uh come up with a per student
 
05:00:51.230 --> 05:00:51.240 align:start position:0%
basis and that's the amount of money
 
05:00:55.350 --> 05:00:55.360 align:start position:0%
that would go to the um to the uh
 
05:00:58.070 --> 05:00:58.080 align:start position:0%
provision of services in the private
 
05:01:01.150 --> 05:01:01.160 align:start position:0%
school um and I'll be glad to send you
 
05:01:04.830 --> 05:01:04.840 align:start position:0%
uh the statutes
 
05:01:10.510 --> 05:01:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:13.510 --> 05:01:13.520 align:start position:0%
Le sorry I had my hand up from before
 
05:01:16.110 --> 05:01:16.120 align:start position:0%
sorry I keep forgetting to do that I'm
 
05:01:19.708 --> 05:01:19.718 align:start position:0%
sorry okay we are now on on what page
 
05:01:24.070 --> 05:01:24.080 align:start position:0%
what seven seven yeah any further
 
05:01:28.030 --> 05:01:28.040 align:start position:0%
questions on page seven let's move on oh
 
05:01:32.230 --> 05:01:32.240 align:start position:0%
yes yes oh yes represent Miler yeah you
 
05:01:34.270 --> 05:01:34.280 align:start position:0%
have the whole issue of uh we've talked
 
05:01:37.910 --> 05:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
about this before and that's uh uh on
 
05:01:37.920 --> 05:01:39.628 align:start position:0%
about this before and that's uh uh on
line

05:01:39.628 --> 05:01:39.638 align:start position:0%
line
 
05:01:39.638 --> 05:01:41.150 align:start position:0%
line
15

05:01:41.150 --> 05:01:41.160 align:start position:0%
15
 
05:01:44.670 --> 05:01:44.680 align:start position:0%
um we talk about
 
05:01:47.670 --> 05:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
discrimination and um we have issues
 
05:01:49.670 --> 05:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
with that
 
05:01:52.910 --> 05:01:52.920 align:start position:0%
obviously we don't believe that public
 
05:01:55.910 --> 05:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
monies should be used for
 
05:01:58.390 --> 05:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
indiscriminating in
 
05:02:00.750 --> 05:02:00.760 align:start position:0%
institutions and that's a pro we we
 
05:02:03.070 --> 05:02:03.080 align:start position:0%
believe that's a problem I guess the
 
05:02:06.830 --> 05:02:06.840 align:start position:0%
makers of this uh proposal of this
 
05:02:08.910 --> 05:02:08.920 align:start position:0%
amendment don't feel that's that's a
 
05:02:11.670 --> 05:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
really un important thing we do we don't
 
05:02:14.270 --> 05:02:14.280 align:start position:0%
think any child should be discriminated
 
05:02:17.310 --> 05:02:17.320 align:start position:0%
against and I've used the example I
 
05:02:21.230 --> 05:02:21.240 align:start position:0%
think of the tri Tri State Tri State
 
05:02:21.240 --> 05:02:22.230 align:start position:0%
think of the tri Tri State Tri State
Christian

05:02:22.230 --> 05:02:22.240 align:start position:0%
Christian
 
05:02:25.350 --> 05:02:25.360 align:start position:0%
Academy that basically excluded a
 
05:02:27.310 --> 05:02:27.320 align:start position:0%
student after being in in their school
 
05:02:30.910 --> 05:02:30.920 align:start position:0%
for for 11 years became transgender and
 
05:02:32.350 --> 05:02:32.360 align:start position:0%
was basically eliminated from that
 
05:02:32.360 --> 05:02:33.868 align:start position:0%
was basically eliminated from that
school

05:02:33.868 --> 05:02:33.878 align:start position:0%
school
 
05:02:35.948 --> 05:02:35.958 align:start position:0%
now that's private money I understand
 
05:02:37.750 --> 05:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
that but if we're going to have public
 
05:02:40.990 --> 05:02:41.000 align:start position:0%
money being used for this then I and I
 
05:02:44.590 --> 05:02:44.600 align:start position:0%
have strongly strong concerns about
 
05:02:44.600 --> 05:02:45.868 align:start position:0%
have strongly strong concerns about
potential

05:02:45.868 --> 05:02:45.878 align:start position:0%
potential
 
05:02:48.150 --> 05:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
discrimination uh in this uh in this
 
05:02:51.708 --> 05:02:51.718 align:start position:0%
bill for students who may want to have a
 
05:02:53.990 --> 05:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
Christian EX in that example may have a
 
05:02:56.910 --> 05:02:56.920 align:start position:0%
Christian education but may be
 
05:03:00.070 --> 05:03:00.080 align:start position:0%
gay uh and I think that's unfortunate
 
05:03:03.190 --> 05:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
that this particular
 
05:03:05.470 --> 05:03:05.480 align:start position:0%
Bill allows that to happen to
 
05:03:09.070 --> 05:03:09.080 align:start position:0%
discriminate against students of that
 
05:03:11.230 --> 05:03:11.240 align:start position:0%
nature I'm sorry that was a statement I
 
05:03:12.750 --> 05:03:12.760 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have made a statement that was
 
05:03:16.510 --> 05:03:16.520 align:start position:0%
a not a question and if I may I would
 
05:03:18.150 --> 05:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
like to remind the committee about the
 
05:03:20.470 --> 05:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
gleon study that showed that there is a
 
05:03:22.628 --> 05:03:22.638 align:start position:0%
lower rate of bullying harassment and
 
05:03:24.868 --> 05:03:24.878 align:start position:0%
violence against gay and transgendered
 
05:03:27.030 --> 05:03:27.040 align:start position:0%
students in private schools including
 
05:03:29.110 --> 05:03:29.120 align:start position:0%
religious private schools than occurs in
 
05:03:31.310 --> 05:03:31.320 align:start position:0%
the public schools this is an issue
 
05:03:33.190 --> 05:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
where where within the those Christian
 
05:03:35.470 --> 05:03:35.480 align:start position:0%
World Views and those private schools a
 
05:03:37.230 --> 05:03:37.240 align:start position:0%
lot of these children are able to find a
 
05:03:38.990 --> 05:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
safe space that they did not have in
 
05:03:41.030 --> 05:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
their local public
 
05:03:43.110 --> 05:03:43.120 align:start position:0%
school if I could Mr chair thank you
 
05:03:45.150 --> 05:03:45.160 align:start position:0%
very much represent cordelli thank you
 
05:03:47.590 --> 05:03:47.600 align:start position:0%
um yes in that I checked a little bit
 
05:03:49.430 --> 05:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
into that situation that representative
 
05:03:52.390 --> 05:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
Miler U mentioned and it's my
 
05:03:54.510 --> 05:03:54.520 align:start position:0%
understanding that that was a a mutually
 
05:03:56.990 --> 05:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
agreeable decision that the child would
 
05:03:59.948 --> 05:03:59.958 align:start position:0%
leave that school and in terms of
 
05:04:02.190 --> 05:04:02.200 align:start position:0%
discrimination um I wish that public
 
05:04:04.750 --> 05:04:04.760 align:start position:0%
schools did not discriminate they
 
05:04:08.350 --> 05:04:08.360 align:start position:0%
discriminate against based on
 
05:04:13.110 --> 05:04:13.120 align:start position:0%
wealth uh uh I don't think that uh there
 
05:04:15.430 --> 05:04:15.440 align:start position:0%
are a lot of families in Manchester who
 
05:04:18.190 --> 05:04:18.200 align:start position:0%
could afford to move to Bedford to get a
 
05:04:20.750 --> 05:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
better education for their child uh they
 
05:04:23.510 --> 05:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
discriminate based on zip code I'm sure
 
05:04:26.150 --> 05:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
that there are children uh in tofen Boro
 
05:04:27.788 --> 05:04:27.798 align:start position:0%
that would like to go to the molten Boro
 
05:04:29.670 --> 05:04:29.680 align:start position:0%
Academy it might even be near near to
 
05:04:32.030 --> 05:04:32.040 align:start position:0%
their house but they can't because they
 
05:04:35.430 --> 05:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
are in their WR zip code and isn't it a
 
05:04:41.470 --> 05:04:41.480 align:start position:0%
shame that in America children who um
 
05:04:45.150 --> 05:04:45.160 align:start position:0%
are in a a poor uh school district and
 
05:04:48.590 --> 05:04:48.600 align:start position:0%
their parents um maybe use their parents
 
05:04:51.628 --> 05:04:51.638 align:start position:0%
add their grandparents address so that
 
05:04:54.788 --> 05:04:54.798 align:start position:0%
their kid can go into a better school
 
05:04:57.190 --> 05:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
have been sentenced to jail for trying
 
05:04:58.948 --> 05:04:58.958 align:start position:0%
to get a better education for their
 
05:05:01.510 --> 05:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
child I think that's unconscionable and
 
05:05:04.190 --> 05:05:04.200 align:start position:0%
the system has to change to allow
 
05:05:06.470 --> 05:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
parents to find the best education for
 
05:05:09.310 --> 05:05:09.320 align:start position:0%
their child uh the family that I've been
 
05:05:11.948 --> 05:05:11.958 align:start position:0%
working with based on
 
05:05:14.190 --> 05:05:14.200 align:start position:0%
bullying they were granted manifest
 
05:05:16.270 --> 05:05:16.280 align:start position:0%
education hardship and said go find
 
05:05:19.510 --> 05:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
another public school for your child two
 
05:05:22.190 --> 05:05:22.200 align:start position:0%
Public Schools turn down that child now
 
05:05:25.708 --> 05:05:25.718 align:start position:0%
is it because they had an IEP maybe but
 
05:05:27.788 --> 05:05:27.798 align:start position:0%
they would rejected from those Public
 
05:05:30.830 --> 05:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
Schools um so you know I don't want to
 
05:05:33.030 --> 05:05:33.040 align:start position:0%
hear that public school do not
 
05:05:35.270 --> 05:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
discriminate what about public schools
 
05:05:38.190 --> 05:05:38.200 align:start position:0%
that cannot accommodate a child Cal down
 
05:05:40.548 --> 05:05:40.558 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry this is important to me it is
 
05:05:42.830 --> 05:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
to me too yeah I know I'm not gonna
 
05:05:44.708 --> 05:05:44.718 align:start position:0%
start shouting at you I wish it was
 
05:05:48.030 --> 05:05:48.040 align:start position:0%
important to everybody calm down no we
 
05:05:51.470 --> 05:05:51.480 align:start position:0%
do have I apologize Mr chair
 
05:05:54.750 --> 05:05:54.760 align:start position:0%
for statement rather than a question uh
 
05:05:57.070 --> 05:05:57.080 align:start position:0%
I'll wait for my emotion when we get
 
05:05:58.788 --> 05:05:58.798 align:start position:0%
into the debate I
 
05:06:01.390 --> 05:06:01.400 align:start position:0%
apologize I do as well Mr
 
05:06:01.400 --> 05:06:02.990 align:start position:0%
apologize I do as well Mr
chairman

05:06:02.990 --> 05:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
05:06:05.628 --> 05:06:05.638 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much to both of you
 
05:06:08.110 --> 05:06:08.120 align:start position:0%
um let's get on with the business of
 
05:06:10.868 --> 05:06:10.878 align:start position:0%
trying to Wade through this uh represent
 
05:06:13.510 --> 05:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
Ellison uh thank you Mr chairman I I I
 
05:06:15.430 --> 05:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
just have one question and I I raised it
 
05:06:19.030 --> 05:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
earlier and I'm still a little unclear
 
05:06:20.750 --> 05:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
but it appears to me that there's a
 
05:06:23.548 --> 05:06:23.558 align:start position:0%
clear conflict between state and federal
 
05:06:28.868 --> 05:06:28.878 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination laws and section 194
 
05:06:31.990 --> 05:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
e417 which allows educational providers
 
05:06:34.868 --> 05:06:34.878 align:start position:0%
to discriminate based on religious-based
 
05:06:37.270 --> 05:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
policies seems to me those two things
 
05:06:41.788 --> 05:06:41.798 align:start position:0%
are in direct conflict and I if anybody
 
05:06:45.350 --> 05:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
has any further information on that
 
05:06:47.670 --> 05:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
conflict uh I I I would appreciate
 
05:06:47.680 --> 05:06:49.030 align:start position:0%
conflict uh I I I would appreciate
hearing

05:06:49.030 --> 05:06:49.040 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
05:06:50.830 --> 05:06:50.840 align:start position:0%
it thank
 
05:06:54.070 --> 05:06:54.080 align:start position:0%

page
 
05:07:09.590 --> 05:07:09.600 align:start position:0%

05:07:21.070 --> 05:07:21.080 align:start position:0%
up okay go for it thank you um the I
 
05:07:22.510 --> 05:07:22.520 align:start position:0%
understand from I couldn't tell which
 
05:07:23.788 --> 05:07:23.798 align:start position:0%
representative was speaking because
 
05:07:25.590 --> 05:07:25.600 align:start position:0%
they're not identified on the screen
 
05:07:27.788 --> 05:07:27.798 align:start position:0%
except for the ones we can see but the
 
05:07:29.390 --> 05:07:29.400 align:start position:0%
the question wasn't the the public
 
05:07:33.390 --> 05:07:33.400 align:start position:0%
schools and the pral schools
 
05:07:36.430 --> 05:07:36.440 align:start position:0%
um allowing bullying obviously they
 
05:07:40.110 --> 05:07:40.120 align:start position:0%
don't um it occurs we know that um nor
 
05:07:42.350 --> 05:07:42.360 align:start position:0%
where it is better the question
 
05:07:46.190 --> 05:07:46.200 align:start position:0%
regarding lines 14 through 18 is the
 
05:07:49.190 --> 05:07:49.200 align:start position:0%
ability for my youngster to access a
 
05:07:52.310 --> 05:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
school if they are knowingly gay or
 
05:07:55.590 --> 05:07:55.600 align:start position:0%
lesbian when they apply if in fact that
 
05:07:59.150 --> 05:07:59.160 align:start position:0%
school does not allow them to go there
 
05:08:01.270 --> 05:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
uh and we had the Christian Schools just
 
05:08:03.230 --> 05:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
the other day from pora say they would
 
05:08:07.470 --> 05:08:07.480 align:start position:0%
not allow them um in dialogue so it's
 
05:08:09.070 --> 05:08:09.080 align:start position:0%
which is fine I'm just saying but that's
 
05:08:11.230 --> 05:08:11.240 align:start position:0%
public money saying they can't go there
 
05:08:14.270 --> 05:08:14.280 align:start position:0%
that's discriminatory practice um and as
 
05:08:16.590 --> 05:08:16.600 align:start position:0%
we that's that's the issue of getting of
 
05:08:18.788 --> 05:08:18.798 align:start position:0%
the schools themselves not allowing
 
05:08:22.070 --> 05:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
youngsters in there and as regards the
 
05:08:24.590 --> 05:08:24.600 align:start position:0%
molor tubor Earl I would think
 
05:08:29.070 --> 05:08:29.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:33.190 --> 05:08:33.200 align:start position:0%
that thank you represent Tanner uh thank
 
05:08:37.310 --> 05:08:37.320 align:start position:0%
you um when it mentions in this uh about
 
05:08:39.590 --> 05:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
the scholarship organization shall not
 
05:08:42.470 --> 05:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
exclude discriminate um are we talking
 
05:08:45.708 --> 05:08:45.718 align:start position:0%
about um New Hampshire's discrimination
 
05:08:48.628 --> 05:08:48.638 align:start position:0%
laws or the federal discrimination laws
 
05:08:50.350 --> 05:08:50.360 align:start position:0%
because I think sometimes they get
 
05:08:53.030 --> 05:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
confused the federal discrimin
 
05:08:55.708 --> 05:08:55.718 align:start position:0%
discrimination laws are not as um
 
05:08:58.548 --> 05:08:58.558 align:start position:0%
detailed as the as the state
 
05:09:00.830 --> 05:09:00.840 align:start position:0%
discrimination laws are and I would like
 
05:09:04.788 --> 05:09:04.798 align:start position:0%
to know uh who abides by which
 
05:09:07.430 --> 05:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination laws in between the
 
05:09:07.440 --> 05:09:08.830 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination laws in between the
scholarship

05:09:08.830 --> 05:09:08.840 align:start position:0%
scholarship
 
05:09:12.190 --> 05:09:12.200 align:start position:0%
organization the um schools that are
 
05:09:15.830 --> 05:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
providing these Educational Services and
 
05:09:20.910 --> 05:09:20.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:23.628 --> 05:09:23.638 align:start position:0%
company anybody have an answer to
 
05:09:27.670 --> 05:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
that I would I would think that all all
 
05:09:31.110 --> 05:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
students in and they're taking uh uh
 
05:09:32.708 --> 05:09:32.718 align:start position:0%
having receiving an education
 
05:09:34.910 --> 05:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity in this state would be
 
05:09:37.548 --> 05:09:37.558 align:start position:0%
obligated to follow both federal and
 
05:09:40.750 --> 05:09:40.760 align:start position:0%
state legislation or
 
05:09:44.230 --> 05:09:44.240 align:start position:0%
statute I I would just indicate also um
 
05:09:47.830 --> 05:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
if I mind that um the religious
 
05:09:51.310 --> 05:09:51.320 align:start position:0%
character of an organization um is
 
05:09:55.150 --> 05:09:55.160 align:start position:0%
Central um to religious freedoms in the
 
05:10:00.350 --> 05:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:03.110 --> 05:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
Court and when we look certain statutes
 
05:10:05.190 --> 05:10:05.200 align:start position:0%
within uh State Statute there are
 
05:10:07.470 --> 05:10:07.480 align:start position:0%
exemptions for religious institutions in
 
05:10:10.110 --> 05:10:10.120 align:start position:0%
terms of housing preferential treatment
 
05:10:13.070 --> 05:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
there um as we we recall when we looked
 
05:10:15.430 --> 05:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
at some of this uh language last year
 
05:10:18.470 --> 05:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
when we were looking at um uh other
 
05:10:20.948 --> 05:10:20.958 align:start position:0%
changes needed to incorporate education
 
05:10:24.470 --> 05:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
as uh part of of of discrimination in
 
05:10:24.480 --> 05:10:27.350 align:start position:0%
as uh part of of of discrimination in
our

05:10:27.350 --> 05:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:30.230 --> 05:10:30.240 align:start position:0%
laws representative
 
05:10:34.750 --> 05:10:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:37.390 --> 05:10:37.400 align:start position:0%
there um yeah just a couple of things
 
05:10:38.670 --> 05:10:38.680 align:start position:0%
these are just back to the sort of
 
05:10:41.948 --> 05:10:41.958 align:start position:0%
financial pieces here um and I'm on page
 
05:10:44.230 --> 05:10:44.240 align:start position:0%
seven but again I'm looking at the uh
 
05:10:46.390 --> 05:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
morning's Amendment so my lines may be
 
05:10:50.150 --> 05:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
off by just a couple of lines um so uh
 
05:10:53.230 --> 05:10:53.240 align:start position:0%
we see on number uh 16 uh Roman numeral
 
05:10:55.190 --> 05:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
16 scholarship organization May adopt
 
05:10:57.830 --> 05:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
guidelines of procedures um these may
 
05:11:01.030 --> 05:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
include requiring a shity bond for
 
05:11:03.110 --> 05:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
education servic providers receiving
 
05:11:04.110 --> 05:11:04.120 align:start position:0%
more than a
 
05:11:04.120 --> 05:11:05.910 align:start position:0%
more than a
100,000

05:11:05.910 --> 05:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
100,000
 
05:11:08.310 --> 05:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
um would there be a reason not to
 
05:11:10.230 --> 05:11:10.240 align:start position:0%
require aurity Bond because assurity
 
05:11:12.910 --> 05:11:12.920 align:start position:0%
bond would I mean serve some very
 
05:11:15.910 --> 05:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
positive purposes I think um so would it
 
05:11:17.590 --> 05:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
not make more sense that over a certain
 
05:11:20.580 --> 05:11:20.590 align:start position:0%
threshold there must be a shity
 
05:11:20.590 --> 05:11:21.990 align:start position:0%
threshold there must be a shity
[Music]

05:11:21.990 --> 05:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:11:24.350 --> 05:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
bond excuse me what page were you on
 
05:11:26.310 --> 05:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
there represent page seven page seven
 
05:11:30.070 --> 05:11:30.080 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry page seven so Roman numeral 16
 
05:11:33.230 --> 05:11:33.240 align:start position:0%
I believe it is in page seven line
 
05:11:37.670 --> 05:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
12 12 oh line 12 okay yeah yeah sure
 
05:11:39.390 --> 05:11:39.400 align:start position:0%
yeah line 12 so it's about the shity
 
05:11:42.190 --> 05:11:42.200 align:start position:0%
bond and it just says for over a 100,000
 
05:11:44.628 --> 05:11:44.638 align:start position:0%
that they may require a shity bond and
 
05:11:46.948 --> 05:11:46.958 align:start position:0%
I'm just suggest I'm wondering why would
 
05:11:49.910 --> 05:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
we say may if we have a threshold um the
 
05:11:52.948 --> 05:11:52.958 align:start position:0%
shity bond ures certain things
 
05:11:55.310 --> 05:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
particularly for the um the student and
 
05:11:57.470 --> 05:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
the parent um that the contract is
 
05:12:00.030 --> 05:12:00.040 align:start position:0%
honored and if not that there means of
 
05:12:02.470 --> 05:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
recovery um Would we not would it not
 
05:12:04.310 --> 05:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
perhaps be better to require a shity
 
05:12:06.590 --> 05:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
bond rather than just simply
 
05:12:08.708 --> 05:12:08.718 align:start position:0%
maybe that's
 
05:12:11.868 --> 05:12:11.878 align:start position:0%
all um and I don't know if you need to
 
05:12:13.270 --> 05:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
answer that it's more a suggestion I
 
05:12:16.948 --> 05:12:16.958 align:start position:0%
suppose than anything else um a second
 
05:12:19.590 --> 05:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
uh point is on Roman numeral 14 just
 
05:12:21.990 --> 05:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
above that a little bit above that and
 
05:12:23.750 --> 05:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
I've I've addressed this before and I
 
05:12:26.150 --> 05:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
just wanted to again um the scholarship
 
05:12:28.310 --> 05:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
organization can receive and expend
 
05:12:30.230 --> 05:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
gifts grants and donations of any kind
 
05:12:31.948 --> 05:12:31.958 align:start position:0%
from any public or private entity to to
 
05:12:34.470 --> 05:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
carry out the purposes of this chapter
 
05:12:37.350 --> 05:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
so what would be the things that this
 
05:12:39.830 --> 05:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization could spend the
 
05:12:39.840 --> 05:12:41.390 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization could spend the
money

05:12:41.390 --> 05:12:41.400 align:start position:0%
money
 
05:12:44.350 --> 05:12:44.360 align:start position:0%
on could it include for example in some
 
05:12:47.788 --> 05:12:47.798 align:start position:0%
way Distributing these gifts grants Etc
 
05:12:54.390 --> 05:12:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:58.430 --> 05:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
program no um
 
05:13:03.548 --> 05:13:03.558 align:start position:0%
uh um individual contribution or uh
 
05:13:05.910 --> 05:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
deposits into the EFA account by the
 
05:13:09.110 --> 05:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
parent or or others um is prohibited in
 
05:13:09.120 --> 05:13:09.868 align:start position:0%
parent or or others um is prohibited in
the

05:13:09.868 --> 05:13:09.878 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:13:13.948 --> 05:13:13.958 align:start position:0%
statute so what would be of so I guess
 
05:13:15.548 --> 05:13:15.558 align:start position:0%
all I'm just trying to drive out here is
 
05:13:17.670 --> 05:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
if if the scholarship organization
 
05:13:19.110 --> 05:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
receives these gifts grants from
 
05:13:21.230 --> 05:13:21.240 align:start position:0%
whatever entities what would they expend
 
05:13:22.470 --> 05:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
the money on then what would they do
 
05:13:25.270 --> 05:13:25.280 align:start position:0%
with the funds then would it be to defay
 
05:13:28.430 --> 05:13:28.440 align:start position:0%
costs of the scholarship organization or
 
05:13:30.948 --> 05:13:30.958 align:start position:0%
represent exactly you you've got it
 
05:13:34.990 --> 05:13:35.000 align:start position:0%
right there that 10% might become 6% or
 
05:13:38.230 --> 05:13:38.240 align:start position:0%
3% or nothing if they get enough
 
05:13:40.430 --> 05:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
scholarship grants yes it also increase
 
05:13:44.628 --> 05:13:44.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:47.310 --> 05:13:47.320 align:start position:0%
organization yes the answer is of course
 
05:13:50.788 --> 05:13:50.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:00.670 --> 05:14:00.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:00.680 --> 05:14:05.350 align:start position:0%
 
seven

05:14:05.350 --> 05:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:05.360 --> 05:14:07.070 align:start position:0%

move move onight okay page

05:14:26.830 --> 05:14:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:29.430 --> 05:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
10 uh represent
 
05:14:32.990 --> 05:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
Tanner thank you on on page nine I I
 
05:14:35.788 --> 05:14:35.798 align:start position:0%
don't know if I have the exact uh
 
05:14:38.190 --> 05:14:38.200 align:start position:0%
amendment that we're on but at least in
 
05:14:41.590 --> 05:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
the original bill I believe um the legal
 
05:14:44.750 --> 05:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
proceedings down at the bottom and again
 
05:14:48.030 --> 05:14:48.040 align:start position:0%
uh there's a no liability Clause uh not
 
05:14:50.470 --> 05:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
limited but no liability clause for the
 
05:14:50.480 --> 05:14:51.830 align:start position:0%
limited but no liability clause for the
scholarship

05:14:51.830 --> 05:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
scholarship
 
05:14:56.470 --> 05:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
organization um and also uh saying that
 
05:15:00.670 --> 05:15:00.680 align:start position:0%
legal uh challenges are um restricted in
 
05:15:03.110 --> 05:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
certain ways in this particular uh
 
05:15:04.708 --> 05:15:04.718 align:start position:0%
section and I was just
 
05:15:08.270 --> 05:15:08.280 align:start position:0%
wondering um just as I was with the
 
05:15:12.030 --> 05:15:12.040 align:start position:0%
income question whether those will meet
 
05:15:15.030 --> 05:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
uh legal challenges and whether they in
 
05:15:18.708 --> 05:15:18.718 align:start position:0%
fact have been approved by a lawyer that
 
05:15:20.990 --> 05:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
they they actually are constitutional
 
05:15:23.548 --> 05:15:23.558 align:start position:0%
and legal to do
 
05:15:27.190 --> 05:15:27.200 align:start position:0%
that I if I mind I I believe that um
 
05:15:29.868 --> 05:15:29.878 align:start position:0%
that language has been reviewed um
 
05:15:31.948 --> 05:15:31.958 align:start position:0%
actually um I think we had testimon from
 
05:15:33.548 --> 05:15:33.558 align:start position:0%
The Institute from justice during the
 
05:15:35.270 --> 05:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
hearing and I believe that they have
 
05:15:37.190 --> 05:15:37.200 align:start position:0%
reviewed that
 
05:15:39.868 --> 05:15:39.878 align:start position:0%
language and and as a followup have
 
05:15:42.548 --> 05:15:42.558 align:start position:0%
there been any legal challenges or court
 
05:15:45.990 --> 05:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
cases to your knowledge uh since this is
 
05:15:49.350 --> 05:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
uh um legislation that's been across the
 
05:15:52.190 --> 05:15:52.200 align:start position:0%
country on these particular
 
05:15:54.590 --> 05:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
issues I'm not sure if this exact
 
05:15:58.628 --> 05:15:58.638 align:start position:0%
language has been uh um implemented
 
05:16:01.510 --> 05:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
Across the Nation but uh there are no
 
05:16:03.708 --> 05:16:03.718 align:start position:0%
legal challenges that I'm aware
 
05:16:06.190 --> 05:16:06.200 align:start position:0%
of thank you uh we're going to go back
 
05:16:08.910 --> 05:16:08.920 align:start position:0%

what that means without government
 
05:16:49.708 --> 05:16:49.718 align:start position:0%
control what does that sentence mean 33
 
05:16:49.718 --> 05:16:50.430 align:start position:0%
control what does that sentence mean 33
and

05:16:50.430 --> 05:16:50.440 align:start position:0%

version or are you on I'm on these I
 
05:17:00.270 --> 05:17:00.280 align:start position:0%
think the the one that came under your
 
05:17:02.190 --> 05:17:02.200 align:start position:0%
name uh represent not the one that came
 
05:17:06.910 --> 05:17:06.920 align:start position:0%
on my a little while ago so page eight
 
05:17:08.990 --> 05:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
lines 33 and
 
05:17:11.628 --> 05:17:11.638 align:start position:0%
34 on my version it talked about the
 
05:17:13.390 --> 05:17:13.400 align:start position:0%
provider getting free from government
 
05:17:15.230 --> 05:17:15.240 align:start position:0%
control I'm curious what that what that
 
05:17:18.230 --> 05:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
actually means definition Roman numeral
 
05:17:20.470 --> 05:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
2 I think is the okay you must be
 
05:17:24.030 --> 05:17:24.040 align:start position:0%
talking 31 down through you know part of
 
05:17:25.948 --> 05:17:25.958 align:start position:0%
that page down to
 
05:17:30.430 --> 05:17:30.440 align:start position:0%
35 or or even 37 I'm sorry I'm looking
 
05:17:31.390 --> 05:17:31.400 align:start position:0%
at the new one that came to South
 
05:17:33.030 --> 05:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
afternoon for you and represent of valid
 
05:17:36.830 --> 05:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
line 34 and 35 you're right
 
05:17:41.270 --> 05:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:43.750 --> 05:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
mean I mean I read it it basically says
 
05:17:45.948 --> 05:17:45.958 align:start position:0%
to me they can do anything they want but
 
05:17:47.548 --> 05:17:47.558 align:start position:0%
I don't know what that means legally or
 
05:18:00.310 --> 05:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:00.320 --> 05:18:02.030 align:start position:0%
 
mean

05:18:02.030 --> 05:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
mean
 
05:18:03.750 --> 05:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
do you have a response for that
 
05:18:03.760 --> 05:18:06.670 align:start position:0%
do you have a response for that
represent

05:18:06.670 --> 05:18:06.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:09.948 --> 05:18:09.958 align:start position:0%
cordelli I believe that the uh intent
 
05:18:13.510 --> 05:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
there is uh uh
 
05:18:15.548 --> 05:18:15.558 align:start position:0%
especially we anticipate there going to
 
05:18:18.750 --> 05:18:18.760 align:start position:0%
be a lot of small um independent uh
 
05:18:18.760 --> 05:18:19.990 align:start position:0%
be a lot of small um independent uh
service

05:18:19.990 --> 05:18:20.000 align:start position:0%

providers um we don't want to have to
 
05:18:59.350 --> 05:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
get into a waiver
 
05:19:02.548 --> 05:19:02.558 align:start position:0%
situation follow up Mr chair
 
05:19:05.990 --> 05:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you represent Kelly
 
05:19:07.670 --> 05:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
earlier in our dialogue you mentioned
 
05:19:10.150 --> 05:19:10.160 align:start position:0%
that esps had to be approved by the
 
05:19:12.190 --> 05:19:12.200 align:start position:0%
Department of Education we went through
 
05:19:14.270 --> 05:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
that long list of schools and providers
 
05:19:16.270 --> 05:19:16.280 align:start position:0%
so you telling me just now that a couple
 
05:19:18.350 --> 05:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
teachers could get together and that
 
05:19:21.070 --> 05:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:23.590 --> 05:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
count uh a couple of teachers can get
 
05:19:24.948 --> 05:19:24.958 align:start position:0%
together a couple of teachers can get
 
05:19:26.910 --> 05:19:26.920 align:start position:0%
together now in former Charter School
 
05:19:27.910 --> 05:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
well we're not talking about Charter
 
05:19:29.030 --> 05:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
School you already have that we're
 
05:19:30.750 --> 05:19:30.760 align:start position:0%
talking which working great talking
 
05:19:32.990 --> 05:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
about right now this bill that talks
 
05:19:34.948 --> 05:19:34.958 align:start position:0%
about you just said three or four
 
05:19:36.750 --> 05:19:36.760 align:start position:0%
teachers can get together and so they
 
05:19:37.948 --> 05:19:37.958 align:start position:0%
don't have the regulation I'm just
 
05:19:40.070 --> 05:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
asking a little while earlier you said
 
05:19:42.190 --> 05:19:42.200 align:start position:0%
that they had to be approved by the doe
 
05:19:43.948 --> 05:19:43.958 align:start position:0%
to be a service provider I'm just asking
 
05:19:48.270 --> 05:19:48.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:50.750 --> 05:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
one um I'm not sure I'm not sure what
 
05:19:53.868 --> 05:19:53.878 align:start position:0%
you're getting at with that question um
 
05:19:56.390 --> 05:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
service providers are added to the
 
05:19:58.548 --> 05:19:58.558 align:start position:0%
system by the scholarship
 
05:20:01.230 --> 05:20:01.240 align:start position:0%
organization um at the uh request of
 
05:20:05.150 --> 05:20:05.160 align:start position:0%
parents who want to uh uh have that uh
 
05:20:08.590 --> 05:20:08.600 align:start position:0%
provider um provide services to their
 
05:20:13.910 --> 05:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:16.868 --> 05:20:16.878 align:start position:0%
requirement I'm not sure what you're uh
 
05:20:19.948 --> 05:20:19.958 align:start position:0%
if I might I think what represent
 
05:20:21.750 --> 05:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
representative wock are you referencing
 
05:20:23.590 --> 05:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
the the statement earlier that private
 
05:20:25.990 --> 05:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
schools can have to be on an approved
 
05:20:28.070 --> 05:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
list that's a I was but when he just
 
05:20:29.750 --> 05:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
said three or four could get together as
 
05:20:31.670 --> 05:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
a group and work with a student students
 
05:20:32.910 --> 05:20:32.920 align:start position:0%
and they wouldn't have any control why
 
05:20:34.390 --> 05:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that be a group uh to be
 
05:20:36.070 --> 05:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
approved that's all I'm just just seems
 
05:20:38.110 --> 05:20:38.120 align:start position:0%
to be half six one half a dozen another
 
05:20:40.270 --> 05:20:40.280 align:start position:0%
that's all I see thank you thank you for
 
05:20:44.070 --> 05:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:46.670 --> 05:20:46.680 align:start position:0%
Le thank you represent lad thank you
 
05:20:50.670 --> 05:20:50.680 align:start position:0%
very much um I I'm more inclined to read
 
05:20:52.830 --> 05:20:52.840 align:start position:0%
that a little bit differently I would
 
05:20:56.628 --> 05:20:56.638 align:start position:0%
say that it in terms of private schools
 
05:20:59.628 --> 05:20:59.638 align:start position:0%
who do not receive Government funding or
 
05:21:03.110 --> 05:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
state funding they don't and they take a
 
05:21:05.788 --> 05:21:05.798 align:start position:0%
student that has an EFA they're not
 
05:21:08.430 --> 05:21:08.440 align:start position:0%
going to be bound by the Department of
 
05:21:11.070 --> 05:21:11.080 align:start position:0%
Education rulings or uh government
 
05:21:15.070 --> 05:21:15.080 align:start position:0%
rulings that are that uh are not really
 
05:21:17.270 --> 05:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
applicable to the private
 
05:21:19.910 --> 05:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
school um there's a certain degree of
 
05:21:22.628 --> 05:21:22.638 align:start position:0%
Independence in a private school and
 
05:21:25.548 --> 05:21:25.558 align:start position:0%
they remain not taking Federal money or
 
05:21:26.990 --> 05:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
state money simply because they're
 
05:21:29.708 --> 05:21:29.718 align:start position:0%
trying to maintain that
 
05:21:31.510 --> 05:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
Independence that that's that's how I
 
05:21:39.390 --> 05:21:39.400 align:start position:0%
read it thank would sorry um going on um
 
05:21:45.270 --> 05:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
to the page nine we had dis we had
 
05:21:48.270 --> 05:21:48.280 align:start position:0%
um discussed I I believe we went to page
 
05:21:51.070 --> 05:21:51.080 align:start position:0%
10 and did the stuff on the uh liability
 
05:21:54.190 --> 05:21:54.200 align:start position:0%
of the legal proceedings are there any
 
05:21:54.200 --> 05:21:55.310 align:start position:0%
of the legal proceedings are there any
questions

05:21:55.310 --> 05:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:21:59.070 --> 05:21:59.080 align:start position:0%
regarding uh anything on page nine Mr
 
05:22:01.510 --> 05:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
chair my hand is has been up I've been
 
05:22:04.510 --> 05:22:04.520 align:start position:0%
trying to flag you
 
05:22:08.070 --> 05:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
down okay hi go ahead represent Mullen
 
05:22:11.910 --> 05:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
thank you nice to see you again um so um
 
05:22:15.310 --> 05:22:15.320 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli I'm sure that um
 
05:22:17.990 --> 05:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
you are probably like me getting lots of
 
05:22:20.270 --> 05:22:20.280 align:start position:0%
correspondence from individuals in the
 
05:22:24.548 --> 05:22:24.558 align:start position:0%
state regarding this bill um it is not
 
05:22:27.868 --> 05:22:27.878 align:start position:0%
lost on me that in the past half hour or
 
05:22:30.750 --> 05:22:30.760 align:start position:0%
so we have talked about two places in
 
05:22:33.948 --> 05:22:33.958 align:start position:0%
the Bill where safeguards are put in
 
05:22:37.110 --> 05:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
place to protect the service providers
 
05:22:40.628 --> 05:22:40.638 align:start position:0%
from discriminatory behavior um one
 
05:22:44.030 --> 05:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
being the point that uh representative
 
05:22:46.030 --> 05:22:46.040 align:start position:0%
Ellison referenced and the other one
 
05:22:49.670 --> 05:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock I think um did
 
05:22:53.230 --> 05:22:53.240 align:start position:0%
you at any point in time think about
 
05:22:56.750 --> 05:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
putting any language into the bill that
 
05:22:59.750 --> 05:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
would offer some sort of protection to
 
05:23:02.070 --> 05:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
kids and Families
 
05:23:05.430 --> 05:23:05.440 align:start position:0%
I mean I know I I I I get your PO point
 
05:23:08.470 --> 05:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
on the fact that federal and state
 
05:23:11.030 --> 05:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination laws
 
05:23:13.830 --> 05:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
exist but clearly somebody thought it
 
05:23:15.910 --> 05:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
was important enough to protect the
 
05:23:19.548 --> 05:23:19.558 align:start position:0%
service providers that it's it happens
 
05:23:23.110 --> 05:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
twice in in the bill um I'm just
 
05:23:26.990 --> 05:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
wondering whether or not you in fact did
 
05:23:29.310 --> 05:23:29.320 align:start position:0%
think about putting something in or
 
05:23:33.070 --> 05:23:33.080 align:start position:0%
whether or not it was just deemed
 
05:23:35.390 --> 05:23:35.400 align:start position:0%
unnecessary uh I think I would go back
 
05:23:38.910 --> 05:23:38.920 align:start position:0%
to the uh uh title of the bill education
 
05:23:38.920 --> 05:23:40.548 align:start position:0%
to the uh uh title of the bill education
Freedom

05:23:40.548 --> 05:23:40.558 align:start position:0%
Freedom
 
05:23:43.470 --> 05:23:43.480 align:start position:0%
accounts that applies directly to
 
05:23:47.470 --> 05:23:47.480 align:start position:0%
parents um and that they have the uh
 
05:23:50.628 --> 05:23:50.638 align:start position:0%
ability through this bill to uh find the
 
05:23:52.548 --> 05:23:52.558 align:start position:0%
best education opportunities for their
 
05:23:55.868 --> 05:23:55.878 align:start position:0%
children um I'm not sure what
 
05:23:58.270 --> 05:23:58.280 align:start position:0%
protections um you're thinking that they
 
05:23:58.280 --> 05:23:59.350 align:start position:0%
protections um you're thinking that they
might

05:23:59.350 --> 05:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
might
 
05:24:01.310 --> 05:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
require um
 
05:24:04.030 --> 05:24:04.040 align:start position:0%
discriminatory protection I I I'm I'm
 
05:24:05.868 --> 05:24:05.878 align:start position:0%
referencing specifically the
 
05:24:13.470 --> 05:24:13.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:16.390 --> 05:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
providers in terms of the children being
 
05:24:18.990 --> 05:24:19.000 align:start position:0%
discriminated against is that yeah yeah
 
05:24:22.310 --> 05:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:25.590 --> 05:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
families I I I think that
 
05:24:29.430 --> 05:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
uh parents are going to look for the
 
05:24:32.110 --> 05:24:32.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate and best education
 
05:24:33.830 --> 05:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
opportunities for their child if that's
 
05:24:38.270 --> 05:24:38.280 align:start position:0%
in a school or some other um combination
 
05:24:40.390 --> 05:24:40.400 align:start position:0%
of services uh that's what they're going
 
05:24:43.310 --> 05:24:43.320 align:start position:0%
to look for um you
 
05:24:48.230 --> 05:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
know just with a a child who is uh being
 
05:24:49.830 --> 05:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
bullied in a private school they're
 
05:24:52.510 --> 05:24:52.520 align:start position:0%
going to ex be in a public school uh
 
05:24:55.270 --> 05:24:55.280 align:start position:0%
they're going to want to find uh the uh
 
05:25:01.548 --> 05:25:01.558 align:start position:0%
a better education uh service op oity
 
05:25:04.708 --> 05:25:04.718 align:start position:0%
for their child um and that's difficult
 
05:25:07.190 --> 05:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
for them at this
 
05:25:09.750 --> 05:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
point uh okay thank
 
05:25:14.110 --> 05:25:14.120 align:start position:0%
you further questions Mr chairman yes
 
05:25:15.948 --> 05:25:15.958 align:start position:0%
just to follow up to representative
 
05:25:20.070 --> 05:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
mullen's question repr Celli so is there
 
05:25:23.548 --> 05:25:23.558 align:start position:0%
embedded anywhere in this bill
 
05:25:29.670 --> 05:25:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:33.548 --> 05:25:33.558 align:start position:0%
youngsters protections for youngsters uh
 
05:25:36.270 --> 05:25:36.280 align:start position:0%
as we talk about discriminatory practice
 
05:25:38.230 --> 05:25:38.240 align:start position:0%
not Parents Choice not the provider the
 
05:25:40.030 --> 05:25:40.040 align:start position:0%
providers the organizations here the
 
05:25:41.948 --> 05:25:41.958 align:start position:0%
government organizations The Profit
 
05:25:44.510 --> 05:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
making businesses the nonprofits they're
 
05:25:46.150 --> 05:25:46.160 align:start position:0%
well covered they're they're they're
 
05:25:48.310 --> 05:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
legally free there's no liability I'm
 
05:25:50.510 --> 05:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
just talking about for students is there
 
05:25:52.590 --> 05:25:52.600 align:start position:0%
anything embedded in this bill that
 
05:25:55.470 --> 05:25:55.480 align:start position:0%
talks about protecting kids so so for
 
05:25:58.548 --> 05:25:58.558 align:start position:0%
instance the uh two girl school that
 
05:26:01.750 --> 05:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
representative mfet discussed during our
 
05:26:04.868 --> 05:26:04.878 align:start position:0%
uh public hearing um are you suggesting
 
05:26:09.868 --> 05:26:09.878 align:start position:0%
that you want uh protections um for a a
 
05:26:11.750 --> 05:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
young lad who might want to attend one
 
05:26:13.910 --> 05:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
of those schools well if you're talking
 
05:26:16.430 --> 05:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
about transgender child repr Cordell I'm
 
05:26:18.190 --> 05:26:18.200 align:start position:0%
not talking about that specifically I'm
 
05:26:20.110 --> 05:26:20.120 align:start position:0%
talking about any any youngster in the
 
05:26:23.548 --> 05:26:23.558 align:start position:0%
school has any safeguards I I see a bill
 
05:26:25.910 --> 05:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
that's that doesn't incorporate the key
 
05:26:27.708 --> 05:26:27.718 align:start position:0%
element which is youngsters there's no
 
05:26:29.830 --> 05:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
safeguards in here every all the
 
05:26:31.548 --> 05:26:31.558 align:start position:0%
protections for the businesses and the
 
05:26:33.510 --> 05:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
operations that's all I'm asking you if
 
05:26:35.390 --> 05:26:35.400 align:start position:0%
you put any in or you didn't I mean I'm
 
05:26:37.590 --> 05:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not really sure this is even your
 
05:26:39.070 --> 05:26:39.080 align:start position:0%
bill the way I read it you keep
 
05:26:41.110 --> 05:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
answering generalities I'm just asking
 
05:26:43.150 --> 05:26:43.160 align:start position:0%
is there anywhere in there about kids
 
05:26:44.948 --> 05:26:44.958 align:start position:0%
protecting kids that's all I don't see
 
05:26:47.150 --> 05:26:47.160 align:start position:0%
any just tell me line just tell me what
 
05:26:49.948 --> 05:26:49.958 align:start position:0%
line so I can see it I I don't think we
 
05:26:52.350 --> 05:26:52.360 align:start position:0%
have to put everything into a statute
 
05:26:56.030 --> 05:26:56.040 align:start position:0%
that's uh already in-law that the parent
 
05:26:58.350 --> 05:26:58.360 align:start position:0%
the guardian who has custody of the
 
05:27:01.470 --> 05:27:01.480 align:start position:0%
child has the right to bring uh forward
 
05:27:04.390 --> 05:27:04.400 align:start position:0%
any kind of issue and use our judicial
 
05:27:06.670 --> 05:27:06.680 align:start position:0%
system to get resolved that is always
 
05:27:09.470 --> 05:27:09.480 align:start position:0%
open and available thank you Mr
 
05:27:16.750 --> 05:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:20.948 --> 05:27:20.958 align:start position:0%
you was there anything that's left on
 
05:27:23.030 --> 05:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
um on page
 
05:27:27.390 --> 05:27:27.400 align:start position:0%
10 are we down to the the bottom right
 
05:27:31.590 --> 05:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
now okay oh your hands W represent Luna
 
05:27:34.628 --> 05:27:34.638 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair um on page
 
05:27:37.030 --> 05:27:37.040 align:start position:0%
10 I'm referring
 
05:27:41.750 --> 05:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
to let's see um lines um um six through
 
05:27:45.190 --> 05:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
nine and U and I guess my first question
 
05:27:48.590 --> 05:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
is does this mean an education savings
 
05:27:59.430 --> 05:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:59.440 --> 05:28:01.590 align:start position:0%
 
itself

05:28:01.590 --> 05:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
itself
 
05:28:03.910 --> 05:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
do you understand my question would you
 
05:28:05.670 --> 05:28:05.680 align:start position:0%
please explain it a little bit further
 
05:28:11.590 --> 05:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
sure so so it says on on on line eight a
 
05:28:13.990 --> 05:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
pupil enrolled in an education Freedom
 
05:28:17.390 --> 05:28:17.400 align:start position:0%
account program uh persuant to
 
05:28:20.628 --> 05:28:20.638 align:start position:0%
194e is therefore exempt from this
 
05:28:23.548 --> 05:28:23.558 align:start position:0%
requirement this requirement being 193
 
05:28:28.270 --> 05:28:28.280 align:start position:0%
colon one so my question is wa well
 
05:28:31.830 --> 05:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
little bit of context 193 one basically
 
05:28:34.390 --> 05:28:34.400 align:start position:0%
is the compulsory attendance requirement
 
05:28:36.070 --> 05:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
if you're not attending your local
 
05:28:39.150 --> 05:28:39.160 align:start position:0%
public school district you're
 
05:28:41.350 --> 05:28:41.360 align:start position:0%

05:29:18.310 --> 05:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
section three lines 18 through 21
 
05:29:20.670 --> 05:29:20.680 align:start position:0%
represent can you respond to that please
 
05:29:22.230 --> 05:29:22.240 align:start position:0%
H yes thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
05:29:24.628 --> 05:29:24.638 align:start position:0%
you representative luno this is the
 
05:29:26.548 --> 05:29:26.558 align:start position:0%
portion that creates the education
 
05:29:28.110 --> 05:29:28.120 align:start position:0%
Freedom account as a separate
 
05:29:30.270 --> 05:29:30.280 align:start position:0%
educational option from private public
 
05:29:33.510 --> 05:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
public or homeschooling this shows the
 
05:29:36.510 --> 05:29:36.520 align:start position:0%
fact that this is an educational out um
 
05:29:40.150 --> 05:29:40.160 align:start position:0%
educational educational Choice um where
 
05:29:41.910 --> 05:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
the funding comes from the public but it
 
05:29:44.030 --> 05:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
is directed according to this new law
 
05:29:46.070 --> 05:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
that is being created without this
 
05:29:49.190 --> 05:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
inclusion in 1931 this would be an
 
05:29:52.030 --> 05:29:52.040 align:start position:0%
educational program without a home and
 
05:29:54.948 --> 05:29:54.958 align:start position:0%
it would cause cause a lot of confusion
 
05:29:57.788 --> 05:29:57.798 align:start position:0%
this is this is simply an implementation
 
05:30:00.030 --> 05:30:00.040 align:start position:0%
that shows that this is one the fourth
 
05:30:02.708 --> 05:30:02.718 align:start position:0%
me method of attending school public
 
05:30:06.830 --> 05:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
private home or EFA so follow up on that
 
05:30:11.070 --> 05:30:11.080 align:start position:0%
yes but but isn't having an
 
05:30:15.948 --> 05:30:15.958 align:start position:0%
EFA used isn't that used to pay for
 
05:30:19.070 --> 05:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
attending public private
 
05:30:21.590 --> 05:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
homeschool um is isn't that what it's
 
05:30:24.670 --> 05:30:24.680 align:start position:0%
supposed to be used for so you know
 
05:30:26.150 --> 05:30:26.160 align:start position:0%
you're you're you're sort of being
 
05:30:30.270 --> 05:30:30.280 align:start position:0%
circular here that that that now it's
 
05:30:32.350 --> 05:30:32.360 align:start position:0%
how you pay for your
 
05:30:36.750 --> 05:30:36.760 align:start position:0%
education um satisfies your compulsory I
 
05:30:40.590 --> 05:30:40.600 align:start position:0%
I I don't understand how how how the the
 
05:30:43.030 --> 05:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
manner with which you pay for Education
 
05:30:46.110 --> 05:30:46.120 align:start position:0%
somehow satisfies uh a compulsory
 
05:30:48.910 --> 05:30:48.920 align:start position:0%
attendance requirement represent LE can
 
05:30:50.670 --> 05:30:50.680 align:start position:0%
you respond to that please yes thank you
 
05:30:54.230 --> 05:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
Mr chair this is spelled out as to how
 
05:30:55.788 --> 05:30:55.798 align:start position:0%
the education is delivered at the
 
05:30:57.510 --> 05:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
direction of the parent regardless of
 
05:30:59.110 --> 05:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
whether they purchase it from public
 
05:31:02.350 --> 05:31:02.360 align:start position:0%
private or all C options this is an
 
05:31:04.830 --> 05:31:04.840 align:start position:0%
education that falls upon the parent
 
05:31:06.430 --> 05:31:06.440 align:start position:0%
according to the agreement signed with
 
05:31:08.628 --> 05:31:08.638 align:start position:0%
the scholarship organization and while
 
05:31:10.830 --> 05:31:10.840 align:start position:0%
it may end up looking a lot like public
 
05:31:13.110 --> 05:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
school private school or homeschooling
 
05:31:16.190 --> 05:31:16.200 align:start position:0%
it is a separate way of educating a
 
05:31:18.708 --> 05:31:18.718 align:start position:0%
student so the freedom account is its
 
05:31:21.110 --> 05:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
own way of educating a student is what
 
05:31:24.030 --> 05:31:24.040 align:start position:0%
you're saying
 
05:31:26.590 --> 05:31:26.600 align:start position:0%
yes it's like a financial instrument to
 
05:31:28.070 --> 05:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
me yeah
 
05:31:31.190 --> 05:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
wow wow I guess
 
05:31:32.830 --> 05:31:32.840 align:start position:0%
I know all about financial instruments
 
05:31:34.628 --> 05:31:34.638 align:start position:0%
this is actually an educational one that
 
05:31:37.670 --> 05:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
allows the the choice of educational
 
05:31:40.670 --> 05:31:40.680 align:start position:0%
service providers which can include I
 
05:31:42.230 --> 05:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
know a great deal about financial
 
05:31:44.110 --> 05:31:44.120 align:start position:0%
implications or financial instruments
 
05:31:45.830 --> 05:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
that have social implications as well
 
05:31:47.390 --> 05:31:47.400 align:start position:0%
and this one do y I also have a
 
05:31:49.708 --> 05:31:49.718 align:start position:0%
concentration in course 14
 
05:31:51.990 --> 05:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
so very nice I didn't take the extra
 
05:31:53.830 --> 05:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
four classes to get a math double major
 
05:31:55.990 --> 05:31:56.000 align:start position:0%

down uh thank you Mr chair and um I your
 
05:32:13.868 --> 05:32:13.878 align:start position:0%
last statement about um you know parents
 
05:32:16.390 --> 05:32:16.400 align:start position:0%
uh having the ability through the courts
 
05:32:21.548 --> 05:32:21.558 align:start position:0%
Etc to uh have their oversight of this
 
05:32:23.750 --> 05:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
um particular
 
05:32:26.430 --> 05:32:26.440 align:start position:0%
program when you when you put a no
 
05:32:29.470 --> 05:32:29.480 align:start position:0%
liability clause in no liability shall
 
05:32:32.590 --> 05:32:32.600 align:start position:0%
arise from the scholarship or the state
 
05:32:35.030 --> 05:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
or public school or School District
 
05:32:37.628 --> 05:32:37.638 align:start position:0%
based on the award or use of an EFA
 
05:32:40.948 --> 05:32:40.958 align:start position:0%
doesn't that take away uh the ability of
 
05:32:44.230 --> 05:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
parents um and the ability of a citizen
 
05:32:47.230 --> 05:32:47.240 align:start position:0%
actually who feels that they need some
 
05:32:52.670 --> 05:32:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:56.788 --> 05:32:56.798 align:start position:0%
means I'm not not an attorney but I
 
05:32:58.310 --> 05:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
don't think you're
 
05:33:03.390 --> 05:33:03.400 align:start position:0%
ever free of something coming at you and
 
05:33:04.830 --> 05:33:04.840 align:start position:0%
I think if there's something where
 
05:33:07.750 --> 05:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
there's and not not an attorney but
 
05:33:10.948 --> 05:33:10.958 align:start position:0%
there's gross negligence or issues which
 
05:33:15.430 --> 05:33:15.440 align:start position:0%
are Beyond uh I think you're always open
 
05:33:19.628 --> 05:33:19.638 align:start position:0%
to answer to the law and and uh and to
 
05:33:27.110 --> 05:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:31.270 --> 05:33:31.280 align:start position:0%
that represent Tanner oh
 
05:33:31.280 --> 05:33:33.590 align:start position:0%
that represent Tanner oh
um

05:33:33.590 --> 05:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:33:38.150 --> 05:33:38.160 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I then then why is the non
 
05:33:41.510 --> 05:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
liability clause in there if it's not a
 
05:33:44.070 --> 05:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
form of legal protection for these for
 
05:33:48.390 --> 05:33:48.400 align:start position:0%
the state the EFA and the scholarship
 
05:33:51.030 --> 05:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
organization uh I I'm not a lawyer
 
05:33:54.350 --> 05:33:54.360 align:start position:0%
either and I never wanted to be one so
 
05:33:57.590 --> 05:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
um I'm just asking from a you know
 
05:34:00.750 --> 05:34:00.760 align:start position:0%
untrained point of view here this no
 
05:34:05.150 --> 05:34:05.160 align:start position:0%
liability uh clause or uh is specific to
 
05:34:08.948 --> 05:34:08.958 align:start position:0%
the awarding or the use of the
 
05:34:12.270 --> 05:34:12.280 align:start position:0%
EFA so it doesn't mean that the
 
05:34:22.270 --> 05:34:22.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:25.030 --> 05:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
purposes we represent Tanner do you have
 
05:34:25.040 --> 05:34:27.470 align:start position:0%
purposes we represent Tanner do you have
any

05:34:27.470 --> 05:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:31.230 --> 05:34:31.240 align:start position:0%
followup no I I get like I said uh we're
 
05:34:33.190 --> 05:34:33.200 align:start position:0%
both struggling I think with uh not
 
05:34:35.310 --> 05:34:35.320 align:start position:0%
being lawyers on this particular issue
 
05:34:37.628 --> 05:34:37.638 align:start position:0%
but it just seems
 
05:34:41.510 --> 05:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
um it's it it just kind of Bo limited
 
05:34:44.310 --> 05:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
liability and non-liability clauses kind

2425 uh looking at 25 specifically uh
 
05:35:11.230 --> 05:35:11.240 align:start position:0%
assuming this this uh bill passes
 
05:35:14.230 --> 05:35:14.240 align:start position:0%
through all the pieces of legislation
 
05:35:16.708 --> 05:35:16.718 align:start position:0%
that needs to go through what what is
 
05:35:19.628 --> 05:35:19.638 align:start position:0%
your expectation of the earliest
 
05:35:19.638 --> 05:35:20.830 align:start position:0%
your expectation of the earliest
starting

05:35:20.830 --> 05:35:20.840 align:start position:0%
starting
 
05:35:23.750 --> 05:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
date the earliest what what did you
 
05:35:26.350 --> 05:35:26.360 align:start position:0%
say could you could you I didn't catch
 
05:35:28.788 --> 05:35:28.798 align:start position:0%
the last part please I'm just ask a
 
05:35:33.310 --> 05:35:33.320 align:start position:0%
number I'm s lost on line 25 what what
 
05:35:35.868 --> 05:35:35.878 align:start position:0%
is the earliest you believe if this bill
 
05:35:38.510 --> 05:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
passes through all the steps what when
 
05:35:39.868 --> 05:35:39.878 align:start position:0%
do you believe this the earliest this
 
05:35:42.670 --> 05:35:42.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:45.548 --> 05:35:45.558 align:start position:0%
effect time why date
 
05:35:49.548 --> 05:35:49.558 align:start position:0%
wise it say uh I
 
05:35:53.150 --> 05:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
um I believe it's going to uh take some
 
05:35:59.390 --> 05:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
time to set up um I would hope that uh
 
05:36:03.628 --> 05:36:03.638 align:start position:0%
if the uh bill is passed and signed into
 
05:36:09.110 --> 05:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
uh law and good timing um there uh might
 
05:36:13.310 --> 05:36:13.320 align:start position:0%
be the opportunity to start um uh
 
05:36:18.670 --> 05:36:18.680 align:start position:0%
awarding uh accounts um in the fall or
 
05:36:25.230 --> 05:36:25.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:25.240 --> 05:36:27.510 align:start position:0%
 
possibly

05:36:27.510 --> 05:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
possibly
 
05:36:29.670 --> 05:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
followup Noe that's very clear thank you
 
05:36:32.390 --> 05:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
thank you thank
 
05:36:34.628 --> 05:36:34.638 align:start position:0%

05:36:37.230 --> 05:36:37.240 align:start position:0%
comments regarding the bill uh We've
 
05:36:38.948 --> 05:36:38.958 align:start position:0%
certainly gone now taken the time to
 
05:36:41.110 --> 05:36:41.120 align:start position:0%
walk through it and I appreciate some of
 
05:36:44.030 --> 05:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
the comments have been uh important for
 
05:36:46.788 --> 05:36:46.798 align:start position:0%
people to listen to and and perhaps even
 
05:36:50.948 --> 05:36:50.958 align:start position:0%
to look at you know um uh possibilities
 
05:36:53.628 --> 05:36:53.638 align:start position:0%
of maybe needed change I don't know but
 
05:36:55.510 --> 05:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh that's up open for discussion right
 
05:36:58.430 --> 05:36:58.440 align:start position:0%
now uh amongst the the writers of the
 
05:37:00.310 --> 05:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
bill um
 
05:37:04.590 --> 05:37:04.600 align:start position:0%
Mr chair yes I want to we appreciate the
 
05:37:06.990 --> 05:37:07.000 align:start position:0%
patience of the committee and looking at
 
05:37:09.190 --> 05:37:09.200 align:start position:0%
all these uh this is a critical bill
 
05:37:11.948 --> 05:37:11.958 align:start position:0%
that's facing the legislature and we've
 
05:37:14.310 --> 05:37:14.320 align:start position:0%
taken an appropriate amount of time to
 
05:37:16.910 --> 05:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
deal with this uh we've been at this for
 
05:37:19.510 --> 05:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
almost two and a half hours now uh would
 
05:37:22.350 --> 05:37:22.360 align:start position:0%
it be appropriate the we would like to
 
05:37:24.470 --> 05:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
caucus but I think it might be a good
 
05:37:26.070 --> 05:37:26.080 align:start position:0%
time to have a break before we actually
 
05:37:28.350 --> 05:37:28.360 align:start position:0%
start the debate on the bill we would
 
05:37:31.190 --> 05:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
like to take about a 20 minute caucus if
 
05:37:32.470 --> 05:37:32.480 align:start position:0%
you if we
 
05:37:35.830 --> 05:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
may yes and I I'm even looking possibly
 
05:37:38.030 --> 05:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
right now based upon what has been
 
05:37:41.948 --> 05:37:41.958 align:start position:0%
discussed here um and I know that there
 
05:37:45.070 --> 05:37:45.080 align:start position:0%
are some typo errors or errors in here
 
05:37:49.350 --> 05:37:49.360 align:start position:0%
that result from legislative Services
 
05:37:51.708 --> 05:37:51.718 align:start position:0%
I'm more inclined right now to take
 
05:37:54.750 --> 05:37:54.760 align:start position:0%
action on this thing first thing uh
 
05:37:54.760 --> 05:37:55.990 align:start position:0%
action on this thing first thing uh
tomorrow

05:37:55.990 --> 05:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
05:37:59.948 --> 05:37:59.958 align:start position:0%
morning fine and if that's your decis to
 
05:38:02.230 --> 05:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
wait and act on it tomorrow morning then
 
05:38:05.390 --> 05:38:05.400 align:start position:0%
we will Reserve our caucus for a later
 
05:38:07.990 --> 05:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
time yes and I think that you know given
 
05:38:09.830 --> 05:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
all that's been said I think it'd be
 
05:38:14.708 --> 05:38:14.718 align:start position:0%
wise uh um you know to to wait until
 
05:38:16.910 --> 05:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
tomorrow morning uh I know we're under
 
05:38:20.150 --> 05:38:20.160 align:start position:0%

05:50:03.430 --> 05:50:03.440 align:start position:0%
in front of us now is
 
05:50:06.868 --> 05:50:06.878 align:start position:0%
608 and uh I think you all have a
 
05:50:09.190 --> 05:50:09.200 align:start position:0%
Amendment for that plus you may have
 
05:50:13.030 --> 05:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
received also the uh an analysis of of
 
05:50:14.390 --> 05:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
05:50:18.390 --> 05:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
dollars that was sent out by
 
05:50:18.400 --> 05:50:20.310 align:start position:0%
dollars that was sent out by
ume

05:50:20.310 --> 05:50:20.320 align:start position:0%
ume
 
05:50:24.350 --> 05:50:24.360 align:start position:0%
um where where there there is a question
 
05:50:27.910 --> 05:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
in that one uh that I'm I'm I'm very
 
05:50:31.310 --> 05:50:31.320 align:start position:0%
concerned with the the uh how the money
 
05:50:33.070 --> 05:50:33.080 align:start position:0%
is allocated to some districts are
 
05:50:34.990 --> 05:50:35.000 align:start position:0%
losing huge amounts and that's all
 
05:50:37.548 --> 05:50:37.558 align:start position:0%
dating back to the stabilization issue
 
05:50:41.708 --> 05:50:41.718 align:start position:0%
which started in 2012 and has haunted us
 
05:50:43.708 --> 05:50:43.718 align:start position:0%
all these years in fact actually even
 
05:50:48.990 --> 05:50:49.000 align:start position:0%
started prior to 2012 yeah and to um
 
05:50:52.468 --> 05:50:52.478 align:start position:0%
make some of the districts whole um as
 
05:50:54.868 --> 05:50:54.878 align:start position:0%
they did that back in 2008 there was a
 
05:50:58.430 --> 05:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
small hold harmless I am very much
 
05:50:59.708 --> 05:50:59.718 align:start position:0%
thinking of putting a small hold
 
05:51:01.910 --> 05:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
harmless it would cost around $25
 
05:51:07.590 --> 05:51:07.600 align:start position:0%
million to hold harmless and to then uh
 
05:51:10.190 --> 05:51:10.200 align:start position:0%
Mak the bill a little bit more palatable
 
05:51:13.590 --> 05:51:13.600 align:start position:0%
my primary need our goal is to get a
 
05:51:15.270 --> 05:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
bill that can go
 
05:51:18.430 --> 05:51:18.440 align:start position:0%
onto uh house
 
05:51:21.390 --> 05:51:21.400 align:start position:0%
finance and be a working
 
05:51:26.190 --> 05:51:26.200 align:start position:0%
tool to um start moving us towards um
 
05:51:29.628 --> 05:51:29.638 align:start position:0%
some kind of a b any budget that's going
 
05:51:32.948 --> 05:51:32.958 align:start position:0%
to be reflective of of some of those
 
05:51:36.190 --> 05:51:36.200 align:start position:0%
goals we all have of trying to help the
 
05:51:38.590 --> 05:51:38.600 align:start position:0%
the districts that need the help and the
 
05:51:42.390 --> 05:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
children who need the help great wa so
 
05:51:44.390 --> 05:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
what are where I'm looking at right now
 
05:51:47.788 --> 05:51:47.798 align:start position:0%
is that I have received uh information
 
05:51:50.310 --> 05:51:50.320 align:start position:0%
from uh the folks over the Department of
 
05:51:52.670 --> 05:51:52.680 align:start position:0%
Education on that the analysis came in
 
05:51:54.670 --> 05:51:54.680 align:start position:0%
today for the first time I saw it and
 
05:51:57.590 --> 05:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not pleased what I'm looking at um
 
05:52:00.310 --> 05:52:00.320 align:start position:0%
I've also talk talked with them on the
 
05:52:03.190 --> 05:52:03.200 align:start position:0%
phone since and they are crafting uh
 
05:52:05.548 --> 05:52:05.558 align:start position:0%
some uh support to the language to build
 
05:52:08.868 --> 05:52:08.878 align:start position:0%
that might help us better um send a
 
05:52:11.310 --> 05:52:11.320 align:start position:0%
better Bill and regardless whether you
 
05:52:13.548 --> 05:52:13.558 align:start position:0%
support it or you don't support it I'd
 
05:52:15.270 --> 05:52:15.280 align:start position:0%
like to make sure we have the best
 
05:52:17.990 --> 05:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
possible product for the 608 moving
 
05:52:22.350 --> 05:52:22.360 align:start position:0%
forward um if if uh we can do that then
 
05:52:23.708 --> 05:52:23.718 align:start position:0%
what I'd like I'm going to do is I'm
 
05:52:26.510 --> 05:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
going to recess the hearing on 608 also
 
05:52:29.310 --> 05:52:29.320 align:start position:0%
to tomorrow morning uh the other bills
 
05:52:31.030 --> 05:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
which we have
 
05:52:34.628 --> 05:52:34.638 align:start position:0%
scheduled uh are not early bills those
 
05:52:37.030 --> 05:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
are not early bills so that allows us
 
05:52:39.070 --> 05:52:39.080 align:start position:0%
the morning to look at both of these
 
05:52:41.468 --> 05:52:41.478 align:start position:0%
bills and to try to make some decision
 
05:52:43.230 --> 05:52:43.240 align:start position:0%
one way or the
 
05:52:46.390 --> 05:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
other so um I don't think there's any
 
05:52:48.670 --> 05:52:48.680 align:start position:0%
need to get into much of a discussion on
 
05:52:51.430 --> 05:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
608 at this point in time seeing that we
 
05:52:54.990 --> 05:52:55.000 align:start position:0%
will be uh into that tomorrow
 
05:52:58.830 --> 05:52:58.840 align:start position:0%
morning comments Mr
 
05:53:01.910 --> 05:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
represent B what time do we have to have
 
05:53:04.548 --> 05:53:04.558 align:start position:0%
these bills done by tomorrow morning
 
05:53:07.310 --> 05:53:07.320 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to have them done by
 
05:53:11.948 --> 05:53:11.958 align:start position:0%
noon repan luno thank you Mr chair um uh
 
05:53:17.708 --> 05:53:17.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:19.468 --> 05:53:19.478 align:start position:0%
for I
 
05:53:22.830 --> 05:53:22.840 align:start position:0%
mean it was scheduled for being EXA
 
05:53:26.750 --> 05:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
right so um are are we going to be
 
05:53:28.990 --> 05:53:29.000 align:start position:0%
uh holding a
 
05:53:32.070 --> 05:53:32.080 align:start position:0%
hearing no we already had the hearing no
 
05:53:34.030 --> 05:53:34.040 align:start position:0%
we've already we've already had the
 
05:53:37.788 --> 05:53:37.798 align:start position:0%
hearing that's what I thought and and uh
 
05:53:41.350 --> 05:53:41.360 align:start position:0%
as we have done many times before with
 
05:53:43.430 --> 05:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
all sorts of bills especially some of
 
05:53:46.548 --> 05:53:46.558 align:start position:0%
the previous funding bills we have
 
05:53:48.910 --> 05:53:48.920 align:start position:0%
modified them you and I have modified
 
05:53:51.868 --> 05:53:51.878 align:start position:0%
them together when we gone over the LBA
 
05:53:54.310 --> 05:53:54.320 align:start position:0%
and looked at the calculator you know
 
05:53:58.350 --> 05:53:58.360 align:start position:0%
and and and uh made those uh subsequent
 
05:54:00.868 --> 05:54:00.878 align:start position:0%
changes uh this is what it's occurring
 
05:54:03.310 --> 05:54:03.320 align:start position:0%
right now and i' I'd like to have that
 
05:54:05.390 --> 05:54:05.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do it right yeah I I
 
05:54:08.230 --> 05:54:08.240 align:start position:0%
don't um uh Mr chair I don't have a
 
05:54:09.948 --> 05:54:09.958 align:start position:0%
problem with that I just I thought I
 
05:54:13.230 --> 05:54:13.240 align:start position:0%
heard you use the word hearing before I
 
05:54:15.430 --> 05:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
I'm so tired right now Dave you know
 
05:54:18.150 --> 05:54:18.160 align:start position:0%
it's just like I my having a hard time
 
05:54:20.030 --> 05:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
looking at the screen no that that
 
05:54:23.070 --> 05:54:23.080 align:start position:0%
that's fine and and you know I I I I do
 
05:54:25.548 --> 05:54:25.558 align:start position:0%
appreciate the fact that that that you
 
05:54:27.190 --> 05:54:27.200 align:start position:0%
sent over an amendment yesterday and
 
05:54:29.270 --> 05:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
then there was another amendment to 608
 
05:54:31.548 --> 05:54:31.558 align:start position:0%
this morning and that that other
 
05:54:34.510 --> 05:54:34.520 align:start position:0%
amendment that literally just minor
 
05:54:37.030 --> 05:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
changes do do you are you looking at
 
05:54:40.510 --> 05:54:40.520 align:start position:0%
Material changes to to the bill in a new
 
05:54:42.510 --> 05:54:42.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment or are you looking at updated
 
05:54:44.990 --> 05:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
Financial I'm looking Dave at
 
05:54:47.190 --> 05:54:47.200 align:start position:0%
representative luno just keep it proper
 
05:54:48.830 --> 05:54:48.840 align:start position:0%
I guess okay even though we know each
 
05:54:54.070 --> 05:54:54.080 align:start position:0%
other um I i' I've looked at uh the that
 
05:54:56.590 --> 05:54:56.600 align:start position:0%
uh analysis which is just a a quick
 
05:55:01.468 --> 05:55:01.478 align:start position:0%
analysis done by uh Matt over at the uh
 
05:55:04.750 --> 05:55:04.760 align:start position:0%
at at the the uh Department of Education
 
05:55:06.750 --> 05:55:06.760 align:start position:0%
by Mark right right by Mark excuse me
 
05:55:09.310 --> 05:55:09.320 align:start position:0%
Mark and and
 
05:55:11.788 --> 05:55:11.798 align:start position:0%
um I don't like some of the figures I'm
 
05:55:14.190 --> 05:55:14.200 align:start position:0%
seeing and then I I I looked at it and I
 
05:55:16.628 --> 05:55:16.638 align:start position:0%
and I I think we both probably would
 
05:55:18.230 --> 05:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
look at and say well a lot of this is
 
05:55:21.350 --> 05:55:21.360 align:start position:0%
resultant of where we've been on
 
05:55:24.628 --> 05:55:24.638 align:start position:0%
stabilization and uh I want to look back
 
05:55:27.468 --> 05:55:27.478 align:start position:0%
at 2020 not the year where we had the
 
05:55:31.830 --> 05:55:31.840 align:start position:0%
onetime money last year looking back at
 
05:55:35.670 --> 05:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
2020 and finding out what it has to in
 
05:55:37.750 --> 05:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
using that as a
 
05:55:40.548 --> 05:55:40.558 align:start position:0%
base um and and looking to see if
 
05:55:43.628 --> 05:55:43.638 align:start position:0%
there's a need for a hold harmless as
 
05:55:46.548 --> 05:55:46.558 align:start position:0%
they did with the joint um study back in
 
05:55:49.310 --> 05:55:49.320 align:start position:0%
2008 there was a a small hold harmless
 
05:55:51.070 --> 05:55:51.080 align:start position:0%
if you go back and look at that there as
 
05:55:55.548 --> 05:55:55.558 align:start position:0%
well um we're we're living with this
 
05:55:58.948 --> 05:55:58.958 align:start position:0%
this stabilization which is uh a part of
 
05:56:01.750 --> 05:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
our past and funding here in the state
 
05:56:04.468 --> 05:56:04.478 align:start position:0%
and uh it's it's going to be difficult
 
05:56:08.708 --> 05:56:08.718 align:start position:0%
to get out of that trench um so um I I
 
05:56:11.150 --> 05:56:11.160 align:start position:0%
think that there's a way to least get
 
05:56:14.430 --> 05:56:14.440 align:start position:0%
this forward I personally am a lot like
 
05:56:18.110 --> 05:56:18.120 align:start position:0%
um Representative Steve Smith I want to
 
05:56:20.390 --> 05:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
see something come through that we can
 
05:56:22.670 --> 05:56:22.680 align:start position:0%
basically afford as a state that's
 
05:56:24.510 --> 05:56:24.520 align:start position:0%
sustainable and it's going to meet the
 
05:56:26.590 --> 05:56:26.600 align:start position:0%
needs of the students that we've all
 
05:56:32.868 --> 05:56:32.878 align:start position:0%
discussed and right now um as 6 608
 
05:56:36.510 --> 05:56:36.520 align:start position:0%
stands we it needs more work and I'm
 
05:56:39.390 --> 05:56:39.400 align:start position:0%
hoping that we can get something done if
 
05:56:39.400 --> 05:56:40.910 align:start position:0%
hoping that we can get something done if
not

05:56:40.910 --> 05:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:56:43.468 --> 05:56:43.478 align:start position:0%
um then I I I see everything being done
 
05:56:45.030 --> 05:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
through hb1 and
 
05:56:49.468 --> 05:56:49.478 align:start position:0%
hb2 right and and so I i' I'd like us to
 
05:56:51.948 --> 05:56:51.958 align:start position:0%
be able to really uh send something over
 
05:56:56.788 --> 05:56:56.798 align:start position:0%
at least uh gives a a vehicle for for
 
05:57:00.430 --> 05:57:00.440 align:start position:0%
use so and that's it I I can't offer
 
05:57:04.270 --> 05:57:04.280 align:start position:0%
anything more on that this evening um I
 
05:57:06.468 --> 05:57:06.478 align:start position:0%
I look forward to discussion tomorrow
 
05:57:08.230 --> 05:57:08.240 align:start position:0%
although we're going to have to try
 
05:57:10.030 --> 05:57:10.040 align:start position:0%
we've had a very good discussion
 
05:57:12.750 --> 05:57:12.760 align:start position:0%
regarding hb20 this this afternoon a lot
 
05:57:15.468 --> 05:57:15.478 align:start position:0%
of good comments uh we've got to look at
 
05:57:18.990 --> 05:57:19.000 align:start position:0%
that um and uh I I've got to get some
 
05:57:22.270 --> 05:57:22.280 align:start position:0%
quick leg uh language out to legislative
 
05:57:24.628 --> 05:57:24.638 align:start position:0%
services this afternoon and they head
 
05:57:27.788 --> 05:57:27.798 align:start position:0%
out in about you know 35 minutes or so
 
05:57:31.030 --> 05:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
so 4:00 is when they close shop down so
 
05:57:33.310 --> 05:57:33.320 align:start position:0%
I I I've got to scoot and and really
 
05:57:36.868 --> 05:57:36.878 align:start position:0%
start doing some work with
 
05:57:39.670 --> 05:57:39.680 align:start position:0%
Caitlyn so with that is there anything
 
05:57:42.830 --> 05:57:42.840 align:start position:0%
else at this evening I would suspect
 
05:57:45.830 --> 05:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
that if we put with recessing this bill
 
05:57:49.468 --> 05:57:49.478 align:start position:0%
and recessing 20 um that we will not be
 
05:57:52.270 --> 05:57:52.280 align:start position:0%
able to get to all those bills um that
 
05:57:56.070 --> 05:57:56.080 align:start position:0%
are other bills on the Thursday docket
 
05:57:57.990 --> 05:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
uh we we'll get things done in the
 
05:58:00.070 --> 05:58:00.080 align:start position:0%
morning there's a possibility we could
 
05:58:03.230 --> 05:58:03.240 align:start position:0%
get to a few of those bills like um
 
05:58:05.910 --> 05:58:05.920 align:start position:0%
maybe the Civics testing uh that's the
 
05:58:07.868 --> 05:58:07.878 align:start position:0%
old immigration test we've all talked
 
05:58:11.270 --> 05:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
about at one time or other um we can be
 
05:58:13.350 --> 05:58:13.360 align:start position:0%
looking at you know I'm not going to
 
05:58:15.030 --> 05:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
look at anything that's really going to
 
05:58:18.548 --> 05:58:18.558 align:start position:0%
be um long and drawn out these are not
 
05:58:20.788 --> 05:58:20.798 align:start position:0%
early bills although I do want to let
 
05:58:23.788 --> 05:58:23.798 align:start position:0%
everybody know that by the 18th of March
 
05:58:26.670 --> 05:58:26.680 align:start position:0%
we need to have our bills out some of
 
05:58:28.350 --> 05:58:28.360 align:start position:0%
the bills we're not going to be able to
 
05:58:30.350 --> 05:58:30.360 align:start position:0%
get out we should probably just retain
 
05:58:33.390 --> 05:58:33.400 align:start position:0%
and work on them um and hold them for
 
05:58:37.030 --> 05:58:37.040 align:start position:0%
the second year of the of this banum but
 
05:58:39.030 --> 05:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
there are some good bills ahead of us
 
05:58:40.590 --> 05:58:40.600 align:start position:0%
and and some of them are curricular
 
05:58:42.910 --> 05:58:42.920 align:start position:0%
bills and directly relating to school
 
05:58:45.310 --> 05:58:45.320 align:start position:0%
students in schools we need to address
 
05:58:47.190 --> 05:58:47.200 align:start position:0%
all those even that the bill that's
 
05:58:49.350 --> 05:58:49.360 align:start position:0%
dealing with food service program I I I
 
05:58:51.190 --> 05:58:51.200 align:start position:0%
I think there's a lot of Merit to that I
 
05:58:53.708 --> 05:58:53.718 align:start position:0%
I was supportive of that last year of
 
05:58:55.590 --> 05:58:55.600 align:start position:0%
allowing surplus food to be used by
 
05:58:57.030 --> 05:58:57.040 align:start position:0%
those youngsters that really could
 
05:59:00.548 --> 05:59:00.558 align:start position:0%
benefit from that food out in Indiana so
 
05:59:02.030 --> 05:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
there are some there's some good stuff
 
05:59:04.150 --> 05:59:04.160 align:start position:0%
out in front of us uh we just got to
 
05:59:05.708 --> 05:59:05.718 align:start position:0%
look at it and try to tweak it and make
 
05:59:08.350 --> 05:59:08.360 align:start position:0%
it you know work and a answer those
 
05:59:10.190 --> 05:59:10.200 align:start position:0%
questions I would appreciate anybody
 
05:59:12.150 --> 05:59:12.160 align:start position:0%
that's involved with that bill to be
 
05:59:13.910 --> 05:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
looking at what we decided in the
 
05:59:15.990 --> 05:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
previous year and saying were there some
 
05:59:18.468 --> 05:59:18.478 align:start position:0%
issues that were brought up that we can
 
05:59:20.628 --> 05:59:20.638 align:start position:0%
try to get an amendment put together to
 
05:59:23.350 --> 05:59:23.360 align:start position:0%
perhaps help it uh and that applies all
 
05:59:25.150 --> 05:59:25.160 align:start position:0%
those bills I saw your hand up
 
05:59:27.628 --> 05:59:27.638 align:start position:0%
representative Le it's okay thank you
 
05:59:29.150 --> 05:59:29.160 align:start position:0%
you're good
 
05:59:32.510 --> 05:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
yep okay so I got to run because I have
 
05:59:34.670 --> 05:59:34.680 align:start position:0%
I got to I got to get legislative
 
05:59:37.990 --> 05:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
Services working legisl have has been
 
05:59:41.628 --> 05:59:41.638 align:start position:0%
working but it's it's the stuff we're
 
05:59:44.270 --> 05:59:44.280 align:start position:0%
getting back there's there errors and I
 
05:59:46.150 --> 05:59:46.160 align:start position:0%
think it's not because of folks it's
 
05:59:48.510 --> 05:59:48.520 align:start position:0%
because of the rush everybody's under
 
05:59:49.708 --> 05:59:49.718 align:start position:0%
and they're trying to get things done
 
05:59:53.070 --> 05:59:53.080 align:start position:0%
quickly haste makes waste right so
