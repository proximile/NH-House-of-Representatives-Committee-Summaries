Edwards could not be here
 
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 align:start position:0%
today just a few budgeting notes in
 
00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:29.879 align:start position:0%
general I just want to point out that
 
00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 align:start position:0%
what we do here in house finance
 
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
divisions is recommended to the full
 
00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
Finance so though we may take action or
 
00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
give uh motions and so forth ours are
 
00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:47.159 align:start position:0%
just recommendations to the full finance
 
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 align:start position:0%
committee as we go through the budget
 
00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:52.159 align:start position:0%
process we are obliged to have a
 
00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 align:start position:0%
balanced budget that is we cannot spend
 
00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 align:start position:0%
more than we take in and that can be
 
00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 align:start position:0%
located in RSA 99 colon 8 hyphen
 
00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:04.869 align:start position:0%
located in RSA 99 colon 8 hyphen
lowercase

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:04.879 align:start position:0%
lowercase
 
00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
b compatible with that is house rule 48
 
00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 align:start position:0%
which says that we work in close
 
00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 align:start position:0%
collaboration with the house Ways and
 
00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
Means Committee in order to know just
 
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 align:start position:0%
how much it is we can
 
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
spend for today's presentations uh we'll
 
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 align:start position:0%
make it very clear what page number
 
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 align:start position:0%
we're working off of what accounting
 
00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 align:start position:0%
unit we're working off of you'll notice
 
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 align:start position:0%
already in our packets I think we're
 
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
going to cover probably close to
 
00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:36.199 align:start position:0%
10 and what
 
00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
sections also want to make mention of
 
00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 align:start position:0%
the incredible resources that are found
 
00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:43.759 align:start position:0%
for this division all the divisions
 
00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
house finance and the entire budget
 
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
process both on the department of
 
00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 align:start position:0%
administrative services
 
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 align:start position:0%
website and through the general court
 
00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
website the LBA legislative budget
 
00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 align:start position:0%
assistant everything that we work off of
 
00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919 align:start position:0%
documents large large and small what you
 
00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 align:start position:0%
may think is relevant what you may think
 
00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 align:start position:0%
is not relevant can be found on those
 
00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:07.479 align:start position:0%
two pages incredible resources for
 
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
everything that we look at here in
 
00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 align:start position:0%
division three as well as the other
 
00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
divisions as we go forward today I'd
 
00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 align:start position:0%
like to uh have the presenters uh talk
 
00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:20.039 align:start position:0%
about prioritized needs naturally as
 
00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
best you can uh with this sort of notice
 
00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:25.759 align:start position:0%
so that is related to what DHHS wanted
 
00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
and what the governor perhaps funded in
 
00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:32.039 align:start position:0%
her proposals also vacancy rates if we
 
00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
could uh discuss that as we go along
 
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.350 align:start position:0%
could uh discuss that as we go along
presentation

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 align:start position:0%
wise I'll be taking no motions today but
 
00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 align:start position:0%
I do encourage the members to take notes
 
00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:44.600 align:start position:0%
clear notes in terms of uh things that
 
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
may catch your eye of what may be
 
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880 align:start position:0%
discussed or amended or proposed later
 
00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 align:start position:0%
sessions deadline just want to remind
 
00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
everybody for division 3 we're looking
 
00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
at a March 27th
 
00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong but a March 27th
 
00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.560 align:start position:0%
Target in terms of getting out our
 
00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:08.759 align:start position:0%
amendments to house bills one and two so
 
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
I've I've since learned that March 27th
 
00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:12.599 align:start position:0%
may be a possible session day so the
 
00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
other division the other analysts are
 
00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:16.199 align:start position:0%
telling their divisions March 26 so I
 
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
would assume that for the time being
 
00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:21.919 align:start position:0%
okay March 26th that's a little
 
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
better I think that's it for my
 
00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
introductory comments anything from the
 
00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:28.479 align:start position:0%
members of division three representative
 
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
tarki thank you than you so much
 
00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:31.909 align:start position:0%
tarki thank you than you so much
chairwoman

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 align:start position:0%
chairwoman
 
00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
Mooney um when we finished our last
 
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:36.840 align:start position:0%
meeting on
 
00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:40.479 align:start position:0%
Wednesday I was I had some questions
 
00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:43.759 align:start position:0%
about some Medicaid policy changes that
 
00:06:46.749 --> 00:06:46.759 align:start position:0%
the governor had alluded to um and we
 
00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:49.080 align:start position:0%
talked about my concerns about going
 
00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:51.160 align:start position:0%
into this informational session this
 
00:06:54.909 --> 00:06:54.919 align:start position:0%
afternoon um without any information on
 
00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
policy changes um since then I've had a
 
00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:01.160 align:start position:0%
number of conver ations and I've gone
 
00:07:03.309 --> 00:07:03.319 align:start position:0%
digging a little bit but what happened
 
00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:06.520 align:start position:0%
after that session closed well actually
 
00:07:08.189 --> 00:07:08.199 align:start position:0%
uh while the meeting was still going
 
00:07:10.589 --> 00:07:10.599 align:start position:0%
chairman Edwards said oh I have a
 
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
document it's really easy it's the five
 
00:07:15.189 --> 00:07:15.199 align:start position:0%
bullet point document which I had not
 
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:17.400 align:start position:0%
seen a number of people had not
 
00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
seen I received the document now it's
 
00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:23.080 align:start position:0%
unclear to me who wrote this document
 
00:07:25.749 --> 00:07:25.759 align:start position:0%
it's not an official letterhead um I
 
00:07:28.469 --> 00:07:28.479 align:start position:0%
don't know what it is or where it came
 
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
from um but I believe a number of us now
 
00:07:34.629 --> 00:07:34.639 align:start position:0%
have this document and I guess I just
 
00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:36.440 align:start position:0%
want to express my concerns because I
 
00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:41.960 align:start position:0%
dug into the RSA 9.9 colon
 
00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:44.800 align:start position:0%
2-a which revolves around transmission
 
00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:49.240 align:start position:0%
to the legislature of the budget and um
 
00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
this is the section that states that not
 
00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:55.080 align:start position:0%
later than February 15th I'll jump ahead
 
00:07:57.029 --> 00:07:57.039 align:start position:0%
a little bit the governor shall transmit
 
00:07:58.670 --> 00:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
to the legislature a document to be
 
00:08:00.589 --> 00:08:00.599 align:start position:0%
known as the trailer Bill containing any
 
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
changes to statutory law deemed
 
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
necessary for the ensuing bium we know
 
00:08:06.589 --> 00:08:06.599 align:start position:0%
it is House Bill
 
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
2 um it was recently um amended to then
 
00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:13.960 align:start position:0%
state that the electronic file needed to
 
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
be posted on the Das website on the date
 
00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:20.840 align:start position:0%
of transmitt and we have a copy of that
 
00:08:23.909 --> 00:08:23.919 align:start position:0%
um it's draft format and there's nothing
 
00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:26.599 align:start position:0%
in this document that actually has
 
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
policy changes to Medicaid
 
00:08:33.269 --> 00:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
that are reflected in the five bullet
 
00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:34.919 align:start position:0%
point document in
 
00:08:39.029 --> 00:08:39.039 align:start position:0%
question so number one I'm a little
 
00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
concerned about the lack of
 
00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:46.040 align:start position:0%
transparency of upcoming policy changes
 
00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:47.800 align:start position:0%
um that should have been transmitted to
 
00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:50.720 align:start position:0%
the legislature by February 15th that
 
00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:53.480 align:start position:0%
aren't there we also got an email saying
 
00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
from one of our members in full Finance
 
00:08:57.790 --> 00:08:57.800 align:start position:0%
saying we don't expect to see House Bill
 
00:09:02.069 --> 00:09:02.079 align:start position:0%
2 or the trailer bill until March 1st so
 
00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:04.680 align:start position:0%
again that's another I think that puts
 
00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:08.320 align:start position:0%
us as over a week from today so I am
 
00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.030 align:start position:0%
us as over a week from today so I am
really

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:10.040 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable that we are going to be
 
00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
discussing signif significant policy
 
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
changes that are going to affect tens of
 
00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:19.640 align:start position:0%
thousands of granite Staters and their
 
00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:23.240 align:start position:0%
health care coverage without official
 
00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:25.880 align:start position:0%
documentation on the changes that are
 
00:09:30.389 --> 00:09:30.399 align:start position:0%
coming so I guess I'll start there
 
00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
as a starting point for this session and
 
00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
I want to thank the people who have um
 
00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:36.920 align:start position:0%
answered my questions and concerns up to
 
00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
this point but you did just state that
 
00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:41.320 align:start position:0%
all the documents we're working on can
 
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
be found on the website and I don't
 
00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
believe that the document in question is
 
00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:48.680 align:start position:0%
on the website is that correct well I
 
00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
would um we can start there thank you
 
00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
for your comments that was a lot so I
 
00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
want to get to all of that we'll start
 
00:09:59.389 --> 00:09:59.399 align:start position:0%
with yes the document of the five point
 
00:10:02.069 --> 00:10:02.079 align:start position:0%
points I have the same copy as you
 
00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:03.680 align:start position:0%
including the
 
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
notations this will be discussed today I
 
00:10:09.949 --> 00:10:09.959 align:start position:0%
believe it originated with Mr Lipman
 
00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong and I was in
 
00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:15.800 align:start position:0%
discussions this morning quite early
 
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:18.720 align:start position:0%
with Mr Ripple and I insisted that this
 
00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
very document be on the website seeing
 
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
as though we will be looking at it today
 
00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
so Mr Ripple and I discussed that at
 
00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:30.120 align:start position:0%
length do you have a timeline Mr Ripple
 
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
as to when the document in question and
 
00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:35.680 align:start position:0%
uh I don't know really what to call it
 
00:10:37.829 --> 00:10:37.839 align:start position:0%
but it's Five Points as representative
 
00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
tarki described related to Medicaid
 
00:10:44.389 --> 00:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
discussion points has that been posted
 
00:10:46.629 --> 00:10:46.639 align:start position:0%
if not when it hasn't so I'm about to
 
00:10:49.269 --> 00:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
put that as well as today's presentation
 
00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
materials online so they'll be up within
 
00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
the next five minutes within the next 5
 
00:10:59.829 --> 00:10:59.839 align:start position:0%
minutes as for um House Bill two
 
00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
now I've not been here
 
00:11:04.629 --> 00:11:04.639 align:start position:0%
forever however it seems like a a
 
00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:07.720 align:start position:0%
reoccurring issue that it doesn't come
 
00:11:11.069 --> 00:11:11.079 align:start position:0%
out at simultaneous with the governor's
 
00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
budget presentation despite the RSA you
 
00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:19.000 align:start position:0%
quoted with a specified
 
00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:23.480 align:start position:0%
date so in terms of how to um go forward
 
00:11:25.389 --> 00:11:25.399 align:start position:0%
with that I think it's comparative to
 
00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:29.320 align:start position:0%
other years previous years and um my
 
00:11:30.629 --> 00:11:30.639 align:start position:0%
thought is we just have to wait that out
 
00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
now a correspondence did come through
 
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
today I don't know who it was from that
 
00:11:37.269 --> 00:11:37.279 align:start position:0%
OSS will be working on the finalized
 
00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:39.959 align:start position:0%
version next week so it sounds like
 
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
things are moving but as for completion
 
00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
I don't have an answer Mr Ripple do you
 
00:11:49.269 --> 00:11:49.279 align:start position:0%
have anything to add to that uh we've
 
00:11:51.629 --> 00:11:51.639 align:start position:0%
heard from OS that they plan to have the
 
00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:54.120 align:start position:0%
draft uh the the the bill ready for
 
00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:57.200 align:start position:0%
introduction by the end of next week and
 
00:11:59.590 --> 00:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
is it your understanding like mine that
 
00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
this has happened in previous cycles
 
00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
that house bill 2 is
 
00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:06.920 align:start position:0%
delayed yes there usually is a delay
 
00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:08.440 align:start position:0%
because they go through the document
 
00:12:09.949 --> 00:12:09.959 align:start position:0%
that the governor's office provided and
 
00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:11.160 align:start position:0%
they make sure that all the references
 
00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
are correct Etc and they put it into a
 
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:14.720 align:start position:0%
format that's consistent with other
 
00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
bills and because it's so long it
 
00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:18.160 align:start position:0%
typically does take a while so I think
 
00:12:20.829 --> 00:12:20.839 align:start position:0%
this turnaround time is pretty
 
00:12:23.389 --> 00:12:23.399 align:start position:0%
typical representative T sure thank you
 
00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
I just want to comment on that because
 
00:12:29.269 --> 00:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
we were able to receive this draft
 
00:12:30.829 --> 00:12:30.839 align:start position:0%
that is I have in my house bill two
 
00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
binder right here we got this draft that
 
00:12:35.629 --> 00:12:35.639 align:start position:0%
was posted last Friday evening and the
 
00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:38.920 align:start position:0%
fact that this information was available
 
00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:41.320 align:start position:0%
in a different format that this could
 
00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:44.240 align:start position:0%
not be included somehow in that draft I
 
00:12:48.189 --> 00:12:48.199 align:start position:0%
I just I find that extremely difficult
 
00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
uh to comprehend like it I'm really
 
00:12:52.509 --> 00:12:52.519 align:start position:0%
concerned about transparency here and I
 
00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:54.240 align:start position:0%
know there's nothing we can do and I
 
00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:55.720 align:start position:0%
know I've heard this is the way we've
 
00:12:59.189 --> 00:12:59.199 align:start position:0%
done it for years um I know that this
 
00:13:01.189 --> 00:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
section of rsay was amended July 1 of
 
00:13:04.189 --> 00:13:04.199 align:start position:0%
2023 where I think we attempted again to
 
00:13:08.189 --> 00:13:08.199 align:start position:0%
clarify what was required but I am just
 
00:13:10.269 --> 00:13:10.279 align:start position:0%
I apologize for taking so much time I
 
00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
expressing my frustration with this
 
00:13:13.829 --> 00:13:13.839 align:start position:0%
process and the fact that we are not
 
00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:16.360 align:start position:0%
prepared to have a deep dive into these
 
00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:18.440 align:start position:0%
extreme policy changes that are proposed
 
00:13:20.389 --> 00:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
so I won't take any more time and I
 
00:13:23.509 --> 00:13:23.519 align:start position:0%
thank you for letting me Express
 
00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:27.880 align:start position:0%
that okay I would uh just add to that
 
00:13:30.069 --> 00:13:30.079 align:start position:0%
just just a quick comment representative
 
00:13:32.269 --> 00:13:32.279 align:start position:0%
for for clarification purposes I I don't
 
00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
think I have a copy I don't think I have
 
00:13:37.389 --> 00:13:37.399 align:start position:0%
a copy of that five point but having
 
00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:39.160 align:start position:0%
said that the question is is we're
 
00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
talking about federal policy changes
 
00:13:45.189 --> 00:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
that no we're talking about State policy
 
00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
changes y okay there's a document that
 
00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:51.160 align:start position:0%
maybe was drafted and is what the
 
00:13:54.189 --> 00:13:54.199 align:start position:0%
governor wants to do it's unclear it is
 
00:13:57.189 --> 00:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
literally just type on a piece of white
 
00:13:59.550 --> 00:13:59.560 align:start position:0%
paper okay
 
00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
um are
 
00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:04.600 align:start position:0%
you are you all set representative yeah
 
00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:06.920 align:start position:0%
I think so okay uh well I just want
 
00:14:10.269 --> 00:14:10.279 align:start position:0%
again clarify um my response to the
 
00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:12.040 align:start position:0%
house bill two issue is not this is the
 
00:14:15.189 --> 00:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
way it's always been uh it's just my
 
00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
response is this is how it is so I just
 
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
want to make that distinction very clear
 
00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
um the document in question so the Five
 
00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:26.440 align:start position:0%
Points which will be up on the website
 
00:14:29.629 --> 00:14:29.639 align:start position:0%
within the hour which we will get to um
 
00:14:33.189 --> 00:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
I I consider a working document it has
 
00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
potential for amendments to House Bill
 
00:14:39.269 --> 00:14:39.279 align:start position:0%
two uh which we will spend spend plenty
 
00:14:43.389 --> 00:14:43.399 align:start position:0%
of time on as a division uh but that is
 
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
for all intensive purposes a working
 
00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
document that we will look at today
 
00:14:49.269 --> 00:14:49.279 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's going to be in the
 
00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
final version or you know the version
 
00:14:52.269 --> 00:14:52.279 align:start position:0%
that's going to be published that I
 
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
can't answer to I can just only manage
 
00:14:56.509 --> 00:14:56.519 align:start position:0%
uh today's work
 
00:14:59.509 --> 00:14:59.519 align:start position:0%
session okay anything further from
 
00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:01.160 align:start position:0%
division three members all right with
 
00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:04.040 align:start position:0%
that we're about to tread now on correct
 
00:15:06.189 --> 00:15:06.199 align:start position:0%
me if I'm wrong but this is the the
 
00:15:09.829 --> 00:15:09.839 align:start position:0%
largest uh accounting units in the
 
00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
entire state budget process and that is
 
00:15:14.749 --> 00:15:14.759 align:start position:0%
Medicaid services just to point out and
 
00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
highlight uh the enormity of our task
 
00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
and um and all that you do which reminds
 
00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:22.160 align:start position:0%
me I want to thank all of you uh for all
 
00:15:24.509 --> 00:15:24.519 align:start position:0%
of the work you put into this uh we all
 
00:15:27.269 --> 00:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
get caught up in details and figuring
 
00:15:28.749 --> 00:15:28.759 align:start position:0%
things out and the whole nine yards is
 
00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:31.880 align:start position:0%
out cers but but you uh have done so
 
00:15:34.509 --> 00:15:34.519 align:start position:0%
much work to prepare and to familiarize

presentation so with that I'll hand it
 
00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
over to the both of you on our work
 
00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
session Medicaid services excellent uh
 
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
good afternoon uh Nathan white Chief
 
00:15:52.509 --> 00:15:52.519 align:start position:0%
Financial Officer with the Department of
 
00:15:54.309 --> 00:15:54.319 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services and I'm here
 
00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
today joined by I'm Henry Litman the
 
00:15:59.550 --> 00:15:59.560 align:start position:0%
state's Medicaid director so
 
00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:01.880 align:start position:0%
just just to kick things off uh and
 
00:16:03.749 --> 00:16:03.759 align:start position:0%
address a little of the conversation
 
00:16:06.309 --> 00:16:06.319 align:start position:0%
that's transpired here this morning um
 
00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
we've we have before you uh a couple of
 
00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
uh different documents um the first is
 
00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
the PowerPoint presentation and we will
 
00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
be going through the policy changes that
 
00:16:21.269 --> 00:16:21.279 align:start position:0%
are described in the document that was
 
00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:23.720 align:start position:0%
being discussed before we've included
 
00:16:26.189 --> 00:16:26.199 align:start position:0%
some Financial details on the specific
 
00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:28.160 align:start position:0%
impacts as well as some of the federal
 
00:16:30.629 --> 00:16:30.639 align:start position:0%
regulations regarding those policy
 
00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
changes so that will be discussed in
 
00:16:34.949 --> 00:16:34.959 align:start position:0%
detail today I just I just want to make
 
00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
that clear I I would probably recommend
 
00:16:41.269 --> 00:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
using this as as the the document of of
 
00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
record and and maybe set aside that that
 
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
other uh PowerPoint or that other bullet
 
00:16:50.069 --> 00:16:50.079 align:start position:0%
document for the time being um in the
 
00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
governor's operating budget we will
 
00:16:55.309 --> 00:16:55.319 align:start position:0%
begin on page
 
00:16:58.230 --> 00:16:58.240 align:start position:0%
885 and we will be discussing the
 
00:16:59.670 --> 00:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
accounting unit
 
00:17:02.949 --> 00:17:02.959 align:start position:0%
that run through Page
 
00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:04.839 align:start position:0%
893 again that's the governor's
 
00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
operating budget 885 through 893 so
 
00:17:11.669 --> 00:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
while it is a large um budget area of
 
00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:13.640 align:start position:0%
the department and the state there's
 
00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:16.360 align:start position:0%
actually relatively a smaller number of
 
00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
accounting units um because of the
 
00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:19.880 align:start position:0%
nature of the funding and how it's
 
00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:23.839 align:start position:0%
accounted for and then finally in the uh
 
00:17:27.549 --> 00:17:27.559 align:start position:0%
DHHS budget briefing book um the the
 
00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
Medicaid begins on page one of that
 
00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:33.400 align:start position:0%
document and just as a quick reminder
 
00:17:34.669 --> 00:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
the only accounting units that are
 
00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:37.320 align:start position:0%
included in the budget briefing book are
 
00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:39.080 align:start position:0%
the account accounting units that are
 
00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:40.240 align:start position:0%
over $1
 
00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
million and so with that brief update
 
00:17:44.669 --> 00:17:44.679 align:start position:0%
and orientation I'm going to hand it
 
00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
over to Henry to start to go through the
 
00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:49.630 align:start position:0%
over to Henry to start to go through the
Medicaid

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:49.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:53.080 align:start position:0%
Program thank you um if you turn to uh
 
00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:55.630 align:start position:0%
Program thank you um if you turn to uh
slide

00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:55.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:59.470 --> 00:17:59.480 align:start position:0%
two so what we intend to cover uh this
 
00:18:02.669 --> 00:18:02.679 align:start position:0%
afternoon with you and certainly we'll
 
00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
take questions as you would like to um
 
00:18:06.789 --> 00:18:06.799 align:start position:0%
we try to anticipate what you might like
 
00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:09.200 align:start position:0%
to to learn about and but we're
 
00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
certainly open to hearing um to compare
 
00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:15.400 align:start position:0%
the agency and the governor uh budget uh
 
00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
just as a high level in this budget the
 
00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
difference between the agency budget and
 
00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
um the governor's budget is about $60
 
00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:27.640 align:start position:0%
million in reductions um that are in the
 
00:18:31.029 --> 00:18:31.039 align:start position:0%
budget as you know uh or may not know uh
 
00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:33.080 align:start position:0%
the granted Advantage Healthcare program
 
00:18:36.149 --> 00:18:36.159 align:start position:0%
is an off-budget item and there are $10
 
00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:39.880 align:start position:0%
million of reductions in that um and
 
00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
then we'll
 
00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
um uh try to speak a little bit to some
 
00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:47.640 align:start position:0%
of the issues that are um being
 
00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:49.720 align:start position:0%
discussed at a federal level that would
 
00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
impact this budget uh greatly
 
00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
potentially and then we have an appendix
 
00:18:58.390 --> 00:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
um some of which uh if you attended our
 
00:19:00.909 --> 00:19:00.919 align:start position:0%
medic 101 there's some that material
 
00:19:02.909 --> 00:19:02.919 align:start position:0%
there but we added some other materials
 
00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:04.600 align:start position:0%
that we think you might be interested in
 
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
if the time allows um and certainly if
 
00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:09.720 align:start position:0%
you need more time with us we'll make
 
00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:12.029 align:start position:0%
you need more time with us we'll make
ourselves

00:19:12.029 --> 00:19:12.039 align:start position:0%
ourselves
 
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
available um I'm now um going to um
 
00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
slide four oh Mr Litman we appear to all
 
00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
have a question already okay so that
 
00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:24.760 align:start position:0%
would be representative priest for a
 
00:19:27.909 --> 00:19:27.919 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chairman again
 
00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
um just as a clarification so we're
 
00:19:32.909 --> 00:19:32.919 align:start position:0%
talking about a $70
 
00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
million difference between the agency
 
00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:38.440 align:start position:0%
budget and the governor's budget over
 
00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
you representative Daniels for a
 
00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:49.960 align:start position:0%
question thank you I I I thought you
 
00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:57.789 --> 00:19:57.799 align:start position:0%
uh Advantage was off budget I stand
 
00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:01.360 align:start position:0%
correct you $70 million reduction in the
 
00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:04.120 align:start position:0%
budget okay 60 of which is within what
 
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
we're looking at in terms of and just as
 
00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:08.240 align:start position:0%
a followup is there a reason why that's
 
00:20:11.149 --> 00:20:11.159 align:start position:0%
off budget as opposed to the included
 
00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
when we're trying to look at the whole
 
00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
so the Department's agnostic about where
 
00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
it is it was a legislative decision okay
 
00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:20.470 align:start position:0%
it is it was a legislative decision okay
thank

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:22.549 --> 00:20:22.559 align:start position:0%
you representative Stringham for a
 
00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
question yeah um uh is the comparison
 
00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:28.280 align:start position:0%
based on the efficiency budget or a
 
00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:31.320 align:start position:0%
budget with prioritized needs and uh
 
00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
just quick follow up to that as
 
00:20:36.909 --> 00:20:36.919 align:start position:0%
well sure well I I I guess the question
 
00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:39.480 align:start position:0%
is how how would you like it compared
 
00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:41.310 align:start position:0%
is how how would you like it compared
because

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:41.320 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:45.200 align:start position:0%
um not to be difficult but so in the in
 
00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
the operating budget chapter 106 for the
 
00:20:51.029 --> 00:20:51.039 align:start position:0%
current bium um we have the budget but
 
00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
then there were dollars included uh in
 
00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid rates that were included in
 
00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
hb2 so we we can compare it you know
 
00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
just from the the governor's budget here
 
00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
in front of us but if you'd like us to
 
00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:05.400 align:start position:0%
look at it a different way we we can
 
00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:06.760 align:start position:0%
certainly do
 
00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:10.240 align:start position:0%
that um just I I guess the the question
 
00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
I I was just trying to uh determine what
 
00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:19.240 align:start position:0%
framework you were using um and uh I
 
00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:21.480 align:start position:0%
there's probably value in looking at it
 
00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:25.720 align:start position:0%
many different ways so
 
00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
um sure so I I I I would just need to
 
00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
confirm uh representative pri's um
 
00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
number there I just take one minute to
 
00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:40.240 align:start position:0%
to validate that go ahead continue so um
 
00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:44.600 align:start position:0%
slide four page four um the division of
 
00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:46.070 align:start position:0%
slide four page four um the division of
Medicaid

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
services provides what I think you would
 
00:21:50.269 --> 00:21:50.279 align:start position:0%
all understand to be like the health
 
00:21:54.029 --> 00:21:54.039 align:start position:0%
insurance program that people have
 
00:21:56.269 --> 00:21:56.279 align:start position:0%
Medicaid um there are other parts of the
 
00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
department um where my division helps
 
00:22:02.909 --> 00:22:02.919 align:start position:0%
with the financing of other areas like
 
00:22:05.909 --> 00:22:05.919 align:start position:0%
for example in long-term services and
 
00:22:08.029 --> 00:22:08.039 align:start position:0%
supports which is a budget you hear
 
00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:10.760 align:start position:0%
later this pictogram on the right hand
 
00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:13.720 align:start position:0%
side here is just to to sort of say that
 
00:22:17.149 --> 00:22:17.159 align:start position:0%
Medicaid has a division but we're also
 
00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:19.960 align:start position:0%
play a financing role in terms of we're
 
00:22:22.909 --> 00:22:22.919 align:start position:0%
as the Medicaid agency we're the sort of
 
00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
the direct uh connection to the federal
 
00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:29.080 align:start position:0%
government for Medicaid and um they look
 
00:22:31.029 --> 00:22:31.039 align:start position:0%
to our division with respect to the
 
00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:32.840 align:start position:0%
compliance of the program and and what
 
00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:36.200 align:start position:0%
have you um also on this page on the
 
00:22:38.789 --> 00:22:38.799 align:start position:0%
bottom right paragraph I would note that
 
00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
um in New Hampshire about one in seven
 
00:22:44.789 --> 00:22:44.799 align:start position:0%
individuals are enrolled in the Medicaid
 
00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:47.640 align:start position:0%
Program that compares nationally to one
 
00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:50.510 align:start position:0%
Program that compares nationally to one
in

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:53.320 align:start position:0%
five Slide
 
00:22:59.470 --> 00:22:59.480 align:start position:0%
Five um New Hampshire um sorry see
 
00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:01.720 align:start position:0%
yeah Madam chair I have a a quick
 
00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
question sure representative novano for
 
00:23:08.149 --> 00:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
a question yeah um thank you Mr
 
00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
lman um so the one in seven is based on
 
00:23:15.669 --> 00:23:15.679 align:start position:0%
expanded the expanded Medicaid coverage
 
00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:18.200 align:start position:0%
or the the entirety of the Medicaid
 
00:23:20.789 --> 00:23:20.799 align:start position:0%
Program that enrollment against the
 
00:23:20.799 --> 00:23:23.669 align:start position:0%
Program that enrollment against the
state

00:23:23.669 --> 00:23:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
population okay and the one in five is
 
00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
against the US population nationally
 
00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
00:23:34.549 --> 00:23:34.559 align:start position:0%
you representative tarki for a question
 
00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
so a quick followup that's that 180,000
 
00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
or 189,000 that we talk about yes thank
 
00:23:45.549 --> 00:23:45.559 align:start position:0%
you um and just another s on moving to
 
00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
slide five um we are the fourth smallest
 
00:23:52.789 --> 00:23:52.799 align:start position:0%
Medicaid program in the country in terms
 
00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
of as measured by
 
00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:57.430 align:start position:0%
of as measured by
enrollment

00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
enrollment
 
00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
um we you know in addition to the
 
00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
medical um program we offer um dental
 
00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
care which is you know hard to
 
00:24:08.269 --> 00:24:08.279 align:start position:0%
disconnect from the medical the mouth is
 
00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:11.720 align:start position:0%
part of the body and we um you know the
 
00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
legislature approved an adult program um
 
00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
in that started in April of 23 uh
 
00:24:21.789 --> 00:24:21.799 align:start position:0%
children in for for dental are up to age
 
00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:23.960 align:start position:0%
21 you're considered a child for
 
00:24:26.029 --> 00:24:26.039 align:start position:0%
purposes of dental care and that's
 
00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
through a FIFA Service as opposed to a
 
00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:32.200 align:start position:0%
Managed Care model um as I mentioned um
 
00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
the second bullet we're the interface
 
00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:37.320 align:start position:0%
with the federal government um centers
 
00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:39.640 align:start position:0%
for Medicaid Medicare services and we
 
00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:41.320 align:start position:0%
work with all the divisions in one way
 
00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:43.960 align:start position:0%
or the other in terms of um helping
 
00:24:45.789 --> 00:24:45.799 align:start position:0%
where there is federal funds available
 
00:24:48.029 --> 00:24:48.039 align:start position:0%
for support of services and where
 
00:24:50.029 --> 00:24:50.039 align:start position:0%
Medicaid coverage can come in and I'll
 
00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:51.880 align:start position:0%
Point some more of those out as we go
 
00:24:55.669 --> 00:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
along um and you know basically
 
00:24:59.110 --> 00:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
we're um leveraging um the general funds
 
00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
and other funds that are available in
 
00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
the state to deliver Services uh to uh
 
00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
many individuals um and includes also
 
00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
children in school who are um have IEP
 
00:25:17.549 --> 00:25:17.559 align:start position:0%
and 504 plans um we mention at the
 
00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
bottom there and I'll cover more of this
 
00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
as we go through um some some
 
00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:24.440 align:start position:0%
programming that uh has come through our
 
00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
11:15 waiver um an adult community
 
00:25:31.669 --> 00:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
re-entry what that is is for the first
 
00:25:36.389 --> 00:25:36.399 align:start position:0%
time um federally the the prohibition
 
00:25:40.549 --> 00:25:40.559 align:start position:0%
about um inmate in exclusion that
 
00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
they're allowing um states to be able to
 
00:25:45.789 --> 00:25:45.799 align:start position:0%
draw federal funds to help with the
 
00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
transitions of people leaving um the
 
00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:51.080 align:start position:0%
correction setting as you may or may not
 
00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
know that in New Hampshire the number
 
00:25:55.909 --> 00:25:55.919 align:start position:0%
one reason for people to have recidivism
 
00:25:59.950 --> 00:25:59.960 align:start position:0%
back to uh presid in our jail is that
 
00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:02.440 align:start position:0%
often times mental health and substance
 
00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
use disorder uh being untreated and so
 
00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
what this program tries to do is get
 
00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:10.600 align:start position:0%
people connected to those Services
 
00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
before they leave and to provide
 
00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
medications so there's less of a risk
 
00:26:17.269 --> 00:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
it's a very limited program but is
 
00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:21.720 align:start position:0%
designed to um help with um Health Care
 
00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
ultimately for the Medicaid Program but
 
00:26:25.669 --> 00:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
will also be helpful to the correction
 
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
system in our state in terms of the
 
00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:28.799 align:start position:0%
number of people that
 
00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:36.909 --> 00:26:36.919 align:start position:0%
um and then um briefly on page
 
00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:40.120 align:start position:0%
six um talk about some of our key few
 
00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
key accomplishments and um I won't
 
00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
belabor this uh today but um um youth
 
00:26:49.269 --> 00:26:49.279 align:start position:0%
re-entry is a federal requirement of all
 
00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
states that began in January it's
 
00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:54.440 align:start position:0%
somewhat similar to what I described as
 
00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
the adult community re-entry it's a
 
00:26:59.310 --> 00:26:59.320 align:start position:0%
little bit more tailored program
 
00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:01.880 align:start position:0%
um in the correction system there are
 
00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
people who um would be considered adults
 
00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
in that system but um in Medicaid
 
00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:10.640 align:start position:0%
they're still considered a child in fact
 
00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:13.360 align:start position:0%
um former foster care um are entitled to
 
00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:15.320 align:start position:0%
youth benefits until they're until they
 
00:27:19.789 --> 00:27:19.799 align:start position:0%
turn 26 and so what this uh program
 
00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
tries to do is make sure that those
 
00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:26.600 align:start position:0%
services that um Define what a child's
 
00:27:28.389 --> 00:27:28.399 align:start position:0%
needs are are identified before they
 
00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:31.000 align:start position:0%
leave that there's transitions set in
 
00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
place um so that when they come out um
 
00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:35.960 align:start position:0%
hopefully if they're eligible for
 
00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
Medicaid that that's already
 
00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
established and that uh they have extra
 
00:27:44.789 --> 00:27:44.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:47.549 --> 00:27:47.559 align:start position:0%
provided um one of the questions that we
 
00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:50.720 align:start position:0%
fielded was about the Medicaid unwind
 
00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
during the continuous coverage which
 
00:27:57.149 --> 00:27:57.159 align:start position:0%
went from March of 2020 to um March the
 
00:28:00.509 --> 00:28:00.519 align:start position:0%
end of March of 23 States had the first
 
00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:04.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity to um unwind from The
 
00:28:06.669 --> 00:28:06.679 align:start position:0%
Continuous coverage um federal
 
00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:08.480 align:start position:0%
government asked states to take at least
 
00:28:10.669 --> 00:28:10.679 align:start position:0%
nine months and in many instances they
 
00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:13.480 align:start position:0%
needed more um we were substantially
 
00:28:16.389 --> 00:28:16.399 align:start position:0%
completed in 9 months for the most uh
 
00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:18.440 align:start position:0%
vulnerable population Like Home and
 
00:28:20.149 --> 00:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
Community Based and nursing homes we
 
00:28:22.389 --> 00:28:22.399 align:start position:0%
took the longest to it's just relatively
 
00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
smaller population but we were we were
 
00:28:27.909 --> 00:28:27.919 align:start position:0%
accomplished pretty much from April 1st
 
00:28:30.269 --> 00:28:30.279 align:start position:0%
to at the end of the calendar year um we
 
00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
were largely complete um and we um had
 
00:28:38.909 --> 00:28:38.919 align:start position:0%
to catch up on over 200 in this case
 
00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:41.960 align:start position:0%
238,000 roughly redeterminations that
 
00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:45.200 align:start position:0%
weren't done during the the um Public
 
00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:47.640 align:start position:0%
Health Emergency because they people
 
00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:49.640 align:start position:0%
didn't have to what I would give the
 
00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
state credit for is we tried to work
 
00:28:54.269 --> 00:28:54.279 align:start position:0%
with people because you may or may not
 
00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
remember that at one point during the um
 
00:28:59.230 --> 00:28:59.240 align:start position:0%
Federal Public Health Emergency it was
 
00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
being renewed every 90 days and so we
 
00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:05.360 align:start position:0%
didn't want uh people to lose coverage
 
00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:07.240 align:start position:0%
because we didn't have the capacity to
 
00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:09.440 align:start position:0%
respond to them so we tried to work some
 
00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:11.720 align:start position:0%
of that down in advance with individuals
 
00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:13.320 align:start position:0%
and so we got about 30,000
 
00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
redeterminations done ahead of time
 
00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
which gave us a little bit more
 
00:29:19.269 --> 00:29:19.279 align:start position:0%
bandwidth to be responsive to the to our
 
00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:21.880 align:start position:0%
citizens and to the people in the
 
00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:25.880 align:start position:0%
program when we saw closures um sorry
 
00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:29.640 align:start position:0%
representative tarki for a question um I
 
00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
the fact that we're talking about the
 
00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
unwind is why I just want to stop
 
00:29:35.149 --> 00:29:35.159 align:start position:0%
briefly um the document the bullet
 
00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:38.440 align:start position:0%
document section one um when I read it
 
00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:40.120 align:start position:0%
which talks about return to regular
 
00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:42.760 align:start position:0%
eligibility redetermination when I first
 
00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
read it I sort of thought to myself well
 
00:29:46.909 --> 00:29:46.919 align:start position:0%
we've already done this can you please
 
00:29:48.669 --> 00:29:48.679 align:start position:0%
explain to me what section one on the
 
00:29:50.509 --> 00:29:50.519 align:start position:0%
document means and what this will
 
00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:56.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
um the during the the end of the public
 
00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
health emergency and the beginning of
 
00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:05.720 align:start position:0%
the unwind um there were Federal
 
00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:08.440 align:start position:0%
authorities that states could use
 
00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
because trying to catch up on
 
00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
238,000 um
 
00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:16.600 align:start position:0%
redeterminations you know wasn't just a
 
00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
problem for New Hampshire was a problem
 
00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
for the whole country um that um they
 
00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:24.760 align:start position:0%
gave us different flexibilities like we
 
00:30:27.029 --> 00:30:27.039 align:start position:0%
gave people a bit more time because they
 
00:30:29.029 --> 00:30:29.039 align:start position:0%
may some people who came on the program
 
00:30:31.509 --> 00:30:31.519 align:start position:0%
had never done a redetermination before
 
00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:34.600 align:start position:0%
um for for older people time it takes
 
00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:37.480 align:start position:0%
time to you know get documents and
 
00:30:40.669 --> 00:30:40.679 align:start position:0%
things and um we were able to use
 
00:30:43.149 --> 00:30:43.159 align:start position:0%
different authorities to to ease the
 
00:30:45.149 --> 00:30:45.159 align:start position:0%
burden if you will of getting back into
 
00:30:47.029 --> 00:30:47.039 align:start position:0%
the routine for some people it was four
 
00:30:49.549 --> 00:30:49.559 align:start position:0%
years since they had to go through um a
 
00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
redetermination and so those authorities
 
00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:54.640 align:start position:0%
are available to us until June of this
 
00:30:58.509 --> 00:30:58.519 align:start position:0%
year and so what um the statist IC
 
00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
that's on slide four there is what we're
 
00:31:03.509 --> 00:31:03.519 align:start position:0%
anticipating based on what we've seen
 
00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
and despite I think efforts that far
 
00:31:07.909 --> 00:31:07.919 align:start position:0%
exceed what many states did in terms of
 
00:31:10.149 --> 00:31:10.159 align:start position:0%
trying to get people to complete their
 
00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
work and um we went well above and
 
00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
beyond what was required there's still
 
00:31:18.269 --> 00:31:18.279 align:start position:0%
the PE there are a number of people who
 
00:31:20.149 --> 00:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
still don't do that work and if they
 
00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
don't do that work for redetermination
 
00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
we're at some point we have to close
 
00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:30.200 align:start position:0%
them and that is Factor ented into um
 
00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
that number one on the the piece of
 
00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:36.200 align:start position:0%
paper that uh chair money
 
00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:38.320 align:start position:0%
um and and you had brought to our
 
00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
attention so um that's I guess the what
 
00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:45.080 align:start position:0%
we modeled as being the financial impact
 
00:31:49.669 --> 00:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
of returning to regular pre-pandemic
 
00:31:56.669 --> 00:31:56.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:58.789 --> 00:31:58.799 align:start position:0%
redeterminations okay
 
00:32:02.789 --> 00:32:02.799 align:start position:0%
so do you have an estimate of how many
 
00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
people are going to be
 
00:32:06.909 --> 00:32:06.919 align:start position:0%
affected with this continued
 
00:32:08.549 --> 00:32:08.559 align:start position:0%
redetermination of
 
00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:11.960 align:start position:0%
Eligibility um I I do have that number I
 
00:32:23.149 --> 00:32:23.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:29.000 align:start position:0%
I yeah okay thanks um so um that's
 
00:32:32.629 --> 00:32:32.639 align:start position:0%
deputy director um for Medicaid Program
 
00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
David choury um so in terms of um one of
 
00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:39.880 align:start position:0%
the things that we did during the
 
00:32:42.909 --> 00:32:42.919 align:start position:0%
federal Public Health Emergency is um
 
00:32:45.909 --> 00:32:45.919 align:start position:0%
look to increase the level of expart
 
00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
renewals meaning um those that could be
 
00:32:51.549 --> 00:32:51.559 align:start position:0%
renewed based on if we already have the
 
00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:53.480 align:start position:0%
information through our sources we don't
 
00:32:55.149 --> 00:32:55.159 align:start position:0%
ask the person to provide information
 
00:32:58.230 --> 00:32:58.240 align:start position:0%
that we already have so the the part of
 
00:33:01.149 --> 00:33:01.159 align:start position:0%
the flexibilities around what we could
 
00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
use for information that's going to
 
00:33:05.789 --> 00:33:05.799 align:start position:0%
scale back so we're we're anticipating
 
00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
this to the EXP parte rate will come
 
00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:11.000 align:start position:0%
down about 2,000 individuals a month and
 
00:33:13.149 --> 00:33:13.159 align:start position:0%
we're expecting about half of those
 
00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
individuals uh you know our experience
 
00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:16.760 align:start position:0%
has been about
 
00:33:20.789 --> 00:33:20.799 align:start position:0%
51% um won't won't uh stay
 
00:33:23.389 --> 00:33:23.399 align:start position:0%
open now the thing to point out about
 
00:33:27.389 --> 00:33:27.399 align:start position:0%
Medicaid is that it's unlike um private
 
00:33:29.509 --> 00:33:29.519 align:start position:0%
insurance where there open enrollment
 
00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:32.840 align:start position:0%
periods Medicaid's continuously open so
 
00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:34.840 align:start position:0%
if someone does close and they do feel
 
00:33:37.669 --> 00:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
that they need it they can reapply and
 
00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
there's no waiting
 
00:33:42.549 --> 00:33:42.559 align:start position:0%
period okay thank
 
00:33:45.669 --> 00:33:45.679 align:start position:0%
you Mr White you wanted to add to that
 
00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:49.880 align:start position:0%
sure U from a budgetary perspective in
 
00:33:52.350 --> 00:33:52.360 align:start position:0%
state fiscal year 26 um we would
 
00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:53.960 align:start position:0%
anticipate this change would be about
 
00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
$5.7 million of General funds and
 
00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
equivalent amount of
 
00:34:01.789 --> 00:34:01.799 align:start position:0%
Federal and then in the budget it's also
 
00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:03.960 align:start position:0%
at in say fiscal year 27 at
 
00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
approximately 11.4 million doll of
 
00:34:09.349 --> 00:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
General funds and the corresponding the
 
00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:11.800 align:start position:0%
same amount of federal dollars for the
 
00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:18.470 align:start position:0%
same amount of federal dollars for the
second

00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
year okay okay sure okay representative
 
00:34:23.669 --> 00:34:23.679 align:start position:0%
Stringham for a question and I think
 
00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:26.800 align:start position:0%
that wraps up this I I round of
 
00:34:29.349 --> 00:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
questions I think pretty pretty much
 
00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
understand so you're saying you
 
00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:34.720 align:start position:0%
basically have a of the 8,000 or so that
 
00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh if you're looking at four over the
 
00:34:40.109 --> 00:34:40.119 align:start position:0%
next four months of doing um or is it
 
00:34:42.669 --> 00:34:42.679 align:start position:0%
2,000 a month going to continue into the
 
00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
next bium you're still going to be
 
00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:46.720 align:start position:0%
working people off and doing
 
00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
redeterminations that your initial
 
00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:51.320 align:start position:0%
budget did not include it's required to
 
00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
be done annually um and so we're
 
00:34:56.750 --> 00:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
expecting that there'll be a certain
 
00:34:58.790 --> 00:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
amount of churn people some people come
 
00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:00.440 align:start position:0%
back but then some people
 
00:35:03.349 --> 00:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
won't isn't that business as usual for
 
00:35:05.069 --> 00:35:05.079 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid Program yes and that's
 
00:35:08.069 --> 00:35:08.079 align:start position:0%
that's why we call it return to regular
 
00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:11.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
um representative priest for a question
 
00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:17.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman again for
 
00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
clarification um the 5.7 million that
 
00:35:25.870 --> 00:35:25.880 align:start position:0%
you are estimating for 2026 is that cost
 
00:35:31.069 --> 00:35:31.079 align:start position:0%
savings and 11 for 2027 yes so so that
 
00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:33.640 align:start position:0%
reduction that you just referred to
 
00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:35.400 align:start position:0%
that's reflected in the governor's
 
00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:37.000 align:start position:0%
operating budget that that you were
 
00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
looking at before you and again that's
 
00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:42.520 align:start position:0%
because you
 
00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:46.200 align:start position:0%
anticipate um a number of people will be
 
00:35:48.349 --> 00:35:48.359 align:start position:0%
redetermined and will
 
00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
be taken off of Medicaid actually it's
 
00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:55.480 align:start position:0%
that they won't that after noticing and
 
00:35:58.030 --> 00:35:58.040 align:start position:0%
the time allowed that they choose okay
 
00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:01.720 align:start position:0%
or aren't able to do it okay thank you
 
00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:04.680 align:start position:0%
um if I could add one more comment um
 
00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:06.760 align:start position:0%
one of the things that came out of the
 
00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:08.280 align:start position:0%
federal Public Health Emergency
 
00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:10.280 align:start position:0%
experience for us and the continuous
 
00:36:13.349 --> 00:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
enrollment is all during the federal
 
00:36:14.589 --> 00:36:14.599 align:start position:0%
Public Health Emergency and the
 
00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
continuous enrollment we actually
 
00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
reached out to individuals to see if
 
00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
they really wanted to stay on Medicaid
 
00:36:26.069 --> 00:36:26.079 align:start position:0%
and surprisingly there's you know
 
00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:28.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes if you don't ask that they
 
00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:30.520 align:start position:0%
need it anymore they don't do anything
 
00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
about it so we we found in the last 12
 
00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:35.720 align:start position:0%
months there were 11,000
 
00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
individuals who close based on Outreach
 
00:36:40.270 --> 00:36:40.280 align:start position:0%
now we also reach out to people who
 
00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:42.520 align:start position:0%
close to make sure that if they need
 
00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:47.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:49.720 align:start position:0%
redetermined and we'll get into this a
 
00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
little bit more later on but I'll just
 
00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
throughout this statistic today because
 
00:36:54.349 --> 00:36:54.359 align:start position:0%
I think we'll give you a little bit of
 
00:36:56.670 --> 00:36:56.680 align:start position:0%
feel like in the the granted Advantage
 
00:36:58.750 --> 00:36:58.760 align:start position:0%
Program the average tenure on the
 
00:37:01.829 --> 00:37:01.839 align:start position:0%
program is less than a year um and there
 
00:37:05.349 --> 00:37:05.359 align:start position:0%
are 87,000 people approximately in the
 
00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
last year that were on the program you
 
00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:09.400 align:start position:0%
know the today's enrollment is just
 
00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:10.349 align:start position:0%
know the today's enrollment is just
around

00:37:10.349 --> 00:37:10.359 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:37:13.309 --> 00:37:13.319 align:start position:0%
60,000 so there is a level of people
 
00:37:17.349 --> 00:37:17.359 align:start position:0%
coming on having their needs met or uh
 
00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
by either um leaving the program
 
00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
Medicaid all entirety or that they may
 
00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
be disabled or something and they're
 
00:37:25.069 --> 00:37:25.079 align:start position:0%
going to a different level of
 
00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and so I think that you know
 
00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:29.640 align:start position:0%
we're try trying to be responsible to
 
00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
make sure that people who are eligible
 
00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
and want to get there that we're doing I
 
00:37:37.390 --> 00:37:37.400 align:start position:0%
think extensive Outreach much more than
 
00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
was ever done um and those people that
 
00:37:42.430 --> 00:37:42.440 align:start position:0%
are letting us know that you know hey
 
00:37:44.069 --> 00:37:44.079 align:start position:0%
I've got other insurance now I don't
 
00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
really need it you can close me um in
 
00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:49.400 align:start position:0%
fact you know just anecdotally there was
 
00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:52.640 align:start position:0%
a period of time in the pandemic where
 
00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:53.589 align:start position:0%
a period of time in the pandemic where
um

00:37:53.589 --> 00:37:53.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
CMS um had had made a rule change and
 
00:37:59.589 --> 00:37:59.599 align:start position:0%
the courts said you can't do it that way
 
00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:02.440 align:start position:0%
and we had to reopen people had some
 
00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
anecdotally a few complaints from people
 
00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
saying I still didn't want Medicaid why
 
00:38:08.829 --> 00:38:08.839 align:start position:0%
did you reopen me and so you know we we
 
00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
do um I'm not saying that's the majority
 
00:38:13.390 --> 00:38:13.400 align:start position:0%
in anyway but I'm just saying there's
 
00:38:16.510 --> 00:38:16.520 align:start position:0%
there is an element of individuals who
 
00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
their needs change and and they no
 
00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
longer need it and there still is um
 
00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:23.480 align:start position:0%
particularly with children We call we
 
00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
still today call every family um we have
 
00:38:29.109 --> 00:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
the MOs make calls and we make calls to
 
00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
find out kind of where they're at um and
 
00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:34.520 align:start position:0%
uh you know it isn't all about closing
 
00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:36.280 align:start position:0%
people it's about making sure those that
 
00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
are eligible if we can reach them that
 
00:38:41.950 --> 00:38:41.960 align:start position:0%
and they need help in um completing it
 
00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
that we support them representative
 
00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:48.760 align:start position:0%
priest thank you madam chairman um out
 
00:38:51.589 --> 00:38:51.599 align:start position:0%
of the people that apply for Granite
 
00:38:51.599 --> 00:38:53.030 align:start position:0%
of the people that apply for Granite
State

00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
State
 
00:38:55.990 --> 00:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
Advantage uh how many are rejected
 
00:38:58.069 --> 00:38:58.079 align:start position:0%
because they just don't meet the crit
 
00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
criteria um the this the criteria for
 
00:39:03.870 --> 00:39:03.880 align:start position:0%
granted advantages uh is just an income
 
00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:06.440 align:start position:0%
only criteria I don't have that stat
 
00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
with me I don't know if my team does or
 
00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:12.520 align:start position:0%
not uh but U um we could get that
 
00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
statistic for you and that 11,000 that
 
00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:17.960 align:start position:0%
you talked about about people closing
 
00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
yes is that was that just a particular
 
00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:22.240 align:start position:0%
month or was it no that's for entire
 
00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:25.720 align:start position:0%
12month period for for 2024 uh would be
 
00:39:27.349 --> 00:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
from actually the period that we measur
 
00:39:30.309 --> 00:39:30.319 align:start position:0%
Meed that I'm speaking to is uh from
 
00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:32.440 align:start position:0%
February 1st of last year to through
 
00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:41.640 align:start position:0%
much um and the last bullet on that page
 
00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
was you know we re reoccured the entire
 
00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
um Medicaid Managed Care Program for
 
00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:51.240 align:start position:0%
another uh five years um and um we
 
00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
appreciate that the legislature uh
 
00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
reauthorized for seven years which
 
00:39:58.710 --> 00:39:58.720 align:start position:0%
helped I think us get a better contract
 
00:40:01.950 --> 00:40:01.960 align:start position:0%
and um and we you know used our
 
00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
experience over the number of years to
 
00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
make refinements in the program and I
 
00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
know today we're trying to focus on
 
00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:10.040 align:start position:0%
budget so I'm going to maybe come back
 
00:40:13.349 --> 00:40:13.359 align:start position:0%
to more of that later if there's time um
 
00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
on slide seven just provided some
 
00:40:18.910 --> 00:40:18.920 align:start position:0%
information that allows you to compare
 
00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:21.200 align:start position:0%
in different eligibility groups how New
 
00:40:22.829 --> 00:40:22.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire compares to the United States
 
00:40:22.839 --> 00:40:23.710 align:start position:0%
Hampshire compares to the United States
on

00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:23.720 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:40:26.349 --> 00:40:26.359 align:start position:0%
average and you know you can see the 1
 
00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:28.240 align:start position:0%
in seven and one in5 five repeated again
 
00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:30.520 align:start position:0%
at the top
 
00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
there on slide eight um oh we do have a
 
00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
question Mr Litman couple questions
 
00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:38.560 align:start position:0%
representative Daniels followed by
 
00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:40.760 align:start position:0%
representative walner thank you is there
 
00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
a difference between being on Medicaid
 
00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
and being in the uh a granted Advantage
 
00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
Program they're both Medicaid programs
 
00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
it's really the federal match that the
 
00:40:54.349 --> 00:40:54.359 align:start position:0%
benefits are exactly the same um you
 
00:40:56.990 --> 00:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
know an adult in Medicaid who's not on a
 
00:40:59.670 --> 00:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
w gets the same benefit as someone on
 
00:41:02.109 --> 00:41:02.119 align:start position:0%
granted Advantage okay I'm just trying
 
00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
to reconcile uh your comment that there
 
00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
were 50 thou about currently about
 
00:41:10.950 --> 00:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
50,000 in the granted Advantage but yet
 
00:41:13.470 --> 00:41:13.480 align:start position:0%
on page seven you're talking about
 
00:41:16.829 --> 00:41:16.839 align:start position:0%
185,000 that's that's the entire
 
00:41:19.230 --> 00:41:19.240 align:start position:0%
Medicaid population not just granted
 
00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:21.200 align:start position:0%
Advantage okay thank
 
00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:23.640 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:27.400 align:start position:0%
walner thank you when you did the rewind
 
00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
and you started having people leave the
 
00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
program do you have numbers as to how
 
00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
many children went off how many people
 
00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
in nursing homes went off how many
 
00:41:42.109 --> 00:41:42.119 align:start position:0%
people yes on granted Advantage so those
 
00:41:44.109 --> 00:41:44.119 align:start position:0%
would those be available to us in fact
 
00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:45.880 align:start position:0%
um later on the presentation I think
 
00:41:47.910 --> 00:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
we'll come across a table that has that
 
00:41:49.829 --> 00:41:49.839 align:start position:0%
information thank
 
00:41:54.030 --> 00:41:54.040 align:start position:0%
you proceed Mr Lipman thank you um I'm
 
00:41:55.630 --> 00:41:55.640 align:start position:0%
on slide
 
00:41:58.910 --> 00:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
eight and um I'm not going to spend time
 
00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:00.640 align:start position:0%
on this but I thought for interest based
 
00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:03.200 align:start position:0%
on the fact that your the House of
 
00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
Representative represents typically
 
00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
County boundaries largely but not it's
 
00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
just so you can see in terms of the
 
00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:12.760 align:start position:0%
standard Medicaid Program and granted
 
00:42:15.829 --> 00:42:15.839 align:start position:0%
advantage and in total what the
 
00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:19.160 align:start position:0%
enrollment is in your your communities
 
00:42:22.510 --> 00:42:22.520 align:start position:0%
that you serve and let me make this
 
00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
point too while I'm right here is that
 
00:42:27.549 --> 00:42:27.559 align:start position:0%
um when we run numbers of about
 
00:42:30.190 --> 00:42:30.200 align:start position:0%
enrollment there are different ways you
 
00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
you might see the numbers vary a bit um
 
00:42:36.910 --> 00:42:36.920 align:start position:0%
there's a we have open we do enrollment
 
00:42:38.670 --> 00:42:38.680 align:start position:0%
all during the month so sometimes we're
 
00:42:41.470 --> 00:42:41.480 align:start position:0%
reporting on the last day of the month
 
00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:43.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes we're reporting on who was
 
00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
covered during the month like when I
 
00:42:46.750 --> 00:42:46.760 align:start position:0%
said you know granted Advantage you know
 
00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
there are people who come off and on all
 
00:42:52.069 --> 00:42:52.079 align:start position:0%
the time so some some data runs were
 
00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
running um you know through the month
 
00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
and some are just end of the month
 
00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:58.990 align:start position:0%
and some are just end of the month
points

00:42:58.990 --> 00:42:59.000 align:start position:0%
points
 
00:43:00.589 --> 00:43:00.599 align:start position:0%
question representative tarki for a
 
00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:02.720 align:start position:0%
question thank you very much looking at
 
00:43:05.349 --> 00:43:05.359 align:start position:0%
this map or looking at slide eight there
 
00:43:09.870 --> 00:43:09.880 align:start position:0%
the middle map yes um I'm seeing that
 
00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
6055 persons so I'm assuming this is the
 
00:43:15.109 --> 00:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
ex Medicaid expansion granted Advantage
 
00:43:17.069 --> 00:43:17.079 align:start position:0%
yes so this is another topic that I'm
 
00:43:18.990 --> 00:43:19.000 align:start position:0%
sure we are going to talk a lot about
 
00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:20.720 align:start position:0%
but with New Hampshire having a trigger
 
00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
law that if there's any drop of federal
 
00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
funds below 90% our program of granted
 
00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
Advantage will expire so would I be
 
00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:32.920 align:start position:0%
correct in seeing this that 7.2% of the
 
00:43:34.589 --> 00:43:34.599 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire population would lose
 
00:43:36.270 --> 00:43:36.280 align:start position:0%
their Medicade
 
00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:38.030 align:start position:0%
their Medicade
coverage

00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
coverage
 
00:43:40.750 --> 00:43:40.760 align:start position:0%
um I think that that's what uh that
 
00:43:53.870 --> 00:43:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:58.230 --> 00:43:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
let me do a double check in my math on
 
00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:22.750 --> 00:44:22.760 align:start position:0%
7.2% yeah no it's not of this entire
 
00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
population right it's um CU 180 one 87
 
00:44:30.990 --> 00:44:31.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.589 align:start position:0%
 
in

00:44:34.589 --> 00:44:34.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:37.480 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm not correct on that number so
 
00:44:39.109 --> 00:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
let me have someone run the calculation
 
00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
but it it is uh if 185 is approximately
 
00:44:45.829 --> 00:44:45.839 align:start position:0%
one and one and seven right so it would
 
00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:48.760 align:start position:0%
be onethird of the one and seven would
 
00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:51.640 align:start position:0%
be the kind of math of that well as you
 
00:44:53.710 --> 00:44:53.720 align:start position:0%
can imagine I'm extremely concerned
 
00:44:56.030 --> 00:44:56.040 align:start position:0%
about the potential impact to Granite
 
00:44:57.910 --> 00:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
Staters so I'm sure we will dig into
 
00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:00.640 align:start position:0%
those numbers and your team can figure
 
00:45:03.829 --> 00:45:03.839 align:start position:0%
out the impact of that thanks and I I
 
00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
will have a comment that sort of
 
00:45:08.109 --> 00:45:08.119 align:start position:0%
addresses that very shortly in the slide
 
00:45:08.119 --> 00:45:09.829 align:start position:0%
addresses that very shortly in the slide
deck

00:45:09.829 --> 00:45:09.839 align:start position:0%
deck
 
00:45:14.430 --> 00:45:14.440 align:start position:0%
um again a couple facts here in terms of
 
00:45:18.030 --> 00:45:18.040 align:start position:0%
um uh the top left hand side of uh slide
 
00:45:21.630 --> 00:45:21.640 align:start position:0%
nine um you know New Hampshire 22% of
 
00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:24.720 align:start position:0%
our births are under Medicaid nationally
 
00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:25.750 align:start position:0%
our births are under Medicaid nationally
that's

00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
42% um
 
00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
in terms of the bottom um left hand side
 
00:45:35.829 --> 00:45:35.839 align:start position:0%
the chart we cover 15% of the women in
 
00:45:40.510 --> 00:45:40.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um who are in the 15 to 49
 
00:45:42.910 --> 00:45:42.920 align:start position:0%
versus 21%
 
00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
us um and the chart on the right just is
 
00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:49.480 align:start position:0%
um I think with the granite Advantage
 
00:45:51.549 --> 00:45:51.559 align:start position:0%
program and such you know our uninsured
 
00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:54.040 align:start position:0%
rate it's not the lowest in the region
 
00:45:57.470 --> 00:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
but is is is lower than many others
 
00:46:03.870 --> 00:46:03.880 align:start position:0%
um and on slide 10 um I get to the point
 
00:46:07.549 --> 00:46:07.559 align:start position:0%
I think that um you were trying to rate
 
00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:11.400 align:start position:0%
a moment ago representative um that the
 
00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
way New Hampshire is structured right
 
00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:14.720 align:start position:0%
now in terms of its Insurance Market we
 
00:46:17.069 --> 00:46:17.079 align:start position:0%
have of course the Medicaid
 
00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
Program um
 
00:46:24.190 --> 00:46:24.200 align:start position:0%
the the granted Advantage part in
 
00:46:27.549 --> 00:46:27.559 align:start position:0%
particular um if that were to to close
 
00:46:29.109 --> 00:46:29.119 align:start position:0%
if you kind of think about risk pools
 
00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
you've got the um private insurance
 
00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
through employers employer sponsored
 
00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
insurance you have um the
 
00:46:41.470 --> 00:46:41.480 align:start position:0%
ACA um coverage that's available to
 
00:46:45.589 --> 00:46:45.599 align:start position:0%
people and then you have um the Medicaid
 
00:46:48.430 --> 00:46:48.440 align:start position:0%
Program and and you may remember at one
 
00:46:50.190 --> 00:46:50.200 align:start position:0%
point when we started granted Advantage
 
00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
we began it in the um the ACA
 
00:46:56.470 --> 00:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
Marketplace effectively by buy buying
 
00:46:59.670 --> 00:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
private insurance and while our first uh
 
00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
year or two of experience was not bad it
 
00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:05.960 align:start position:0%
it actually saw it push up rates in the
 
00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:09.480 align:start position:0%
in the individual market and so what my
 
00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
point here on on the right hand side is
 
00:47:14.190 --> 00:47:14.200 align:start position:0%
even if you don't have Medicaid you
 
00:47:17.109 --> 00:47:17.119 align:start position:0%
should have an interest in the issue of
 
00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
of coverage because while we've achieved
 
00:47:22.069 --> 00:47:22.079 align:start position:0%
something as a state in terms of with I
 
00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
think having granted advantage and the
 
00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
1332 waiver in terms of bringing
 
00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
our rates of coverage outside of
 
00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
Medicaid down if this population is no
 
00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:34.640 align:start position:0%
longer covered in the Medicaid Program
 
00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
it probably will have I think a negative
 
00:47:39.549 --> 00:47:39.559 align:start position:0%
effect on everybody who's buying
 
00:47:42.990 --> 00:47:43.000 align:start position:0%
insurance on the individual Market or um
 
00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
in on ACA coverage um and so I think
 
00:47:49.950 --> 00:47:49.960 align:start position:0%
that there's a reason to care about
 
00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
Medicaid even if you're not on Medicaid
 
00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
because I think it has a positive effect
 
00:47:56.829 --> 00:47:56.839 align:start position:0%
on the overall market and you can see
 
00:48:00.430 --> 00:48:00.440 align:start position:0%
with a 1332 waiver and granted advantage
 
00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:02.200 align:start position:0%
on the left-and side that New
 
00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's premiums have come down and
 
00:48:06.870 --> 00:48:06.880 align:start position:0%
and today while they're still very
 
00:48:10.510 --> 00:48:10.520 align:start position:0%
expensive their our ACA coverage is
 
00:48:13.069 --> 00:48:13.079 align:start position:0%
either the lowest or second lowest
 
00:48:13.079 --> 00:48:16.069 align:start position:0%
either the lowest or second lowest
consistently

00:48:16.069 --> 00:48:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:19.640 align:start position:0%
now on the topic of waivers Mr Lipman is
 
00:48:22.390 --> 00:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
there a way to find a list of waivers or
 
00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
is that available yes um and I'm not
 
00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
sure if we have in the slide deck our
 
00:48:29.589 --> 00:48:29.599 align:start position:0%
waiver wheel but if not we have
 
00:48:32.190 --> 00:48:32.200 align:start position:0%
a we can get that information readily to
 
00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:34.240 align:start position:0%
you perfect representative Stringham for
 
00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
a question so uh you you indicated that
 
00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
um um eligibility and enrollment in
 
00:48:43.589 --> 00:48:43.599 align:start position:0%
Medicaid has a positive effect on
 
00:48:46.470 --> 00:48:46.480 align:start position:0%
reducing premiums for manage care and
 
00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:48.640 align:start position:0%
Commercial plans and those types of
 
00:48:50.870 --> 00:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
things that are often paid for by New
 
00:48:53.349 --> 00:48:53.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh employers did I understand
 
00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
that correctly what I was saying is the
 
00:49:00.190 --> 00:49:00.200 align:start position:0%
the granted advantage population is more
 
00:49:03.349 --> 00:49:03.359 align:start position:0%
expensive in the commercial Market than
 
00:49:05.230 --> 00:49:05.240 align:start position:0%
it would push up the rates based on
 
00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
their use use rates if you will compared
 
00:49:11.069 --> 00:49:11.079 align:start position:0%
to it not being there and if you may
 
00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:13.160 align:start position:0%
recall the insurance department actually
 
00:49:15.549 --> 00:49:15.559 align:start position:0%
did a study on what the impact was of
 
00:49:18.510 --> 00:49:18.520 align:start position:0%
moving from where it was back into the
 
00:49:21.589 --> 00:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program that there were Savings
 
00:49:24.789 --> 00:49:24.799 align:start position:0%
in the commercial market for that so so
 
00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
um as a followup would you be concerned
 
00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
that um a policy change on on the
 
00:49:35.349 --> 00:49:35.359 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program uh or or the granite
 
00:49:41.470 --> 00:49:41.480 align:start position:0%
Advantage Program May reduce um
 
00:49:45.230 --> 00:49:45.240 align:start position:0%
um the um the enrollment rate in the
 
00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program and then having kind of
 
00:49:50.349 --> 00:49:50.359 align:start position:0%
the the reverse reverse Boomerang back
 
00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
to to the manage care
 
00:49:56.109 --> 00:49:56.119 align:start position:0%
plants I believe I believe that is a
 
00:49:58.069 --> 00:49:58.079 align:start position:0%
possibility I can't say with certainty
 
00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
because I'm not an economist but that
 
00:50:02.109 --> 00:50:02.119 align:start position:0%
that's my assessment of what would
 
00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:04.720 align:start position:0%
happen based on what happened initially
 
00:50:08.069 --> 00:50:08.079 align:start position:0%
which is rates went up when we pulled
 
00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
the granted Advantage population back
 
00:50:12.069 --> 00:50:12.079 align:start position:0%
into the Medicare program and with the
 
00:50:14.309 --> 00:50:14.319 align:start position:0%
1332 waiver of the insurance department
 
00:50:17.309 --> 00:50:17.319 align:start position:0%
our rates got a lot better as a
 
00:50:19.710 --> 00:50:19.720 align:start position:0%
state representative priest for a
 
00:50:22.150 --> 00:50:22.160 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chairman back
 
00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:23.750 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chairman back
on

00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:50:27.390 --> 00:50:27.400 align:start position:0%
page eight um when you compare the
 
00:50:30.670 --> 00:50:30.680 align:start position:0%
various programs in New Hampshire on the
 
00:50:34.750 --> 00:50:34.760 align:start position:0%
standard Medicaid Program um what
 
00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:43.720 align:start position:0%
127,000 um are children below the age of
 
00:50:46.670 --> 00:50:46.680 align:start position:0%
18 below 18 I may not remember up the
 
00:50:47.829 --> 00:50:47.839 align:start position:0%
top of my head but I think what we
 
00:50:49.549 --> 00:50:49.559 align:start position:0%
Define as a child in Medicaid is just
 
00:50:49.559 --> 00:50:50.390 align:start position:0%
Define as a child in Medicaid is just
around

00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:50:54.309 --> 00:50:54.319 align:start position:0%
990,000 um 90,000 of that 127 yeah it
 
00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
may be 88 something but it's close to 9
 
00:50:58.589 --> 00:50:58.599 align:start position:0%
,000 when you consider all the different
 
00:51:04.870 --> 00:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:08.870 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
um slide um 11 if if we could is just
 
00:51:17.710 --> 00:51:17.720 align:start position:0%
the um organizational chart for the
 
00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:20.240 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program um sort of key leaders
 
00:51:24.349 --> 00:51:24.359 align:start position:0%
in their 10e um the division of Medicaid
 
00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
is is maybe smaller than might expect
 
00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
it's 33 individuals
 
00:51:34.950 --> 00:51:34.960 align:start position:0%
um um support the the this this division
 
00:51:40.230 --> 00:51:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:43.230 --> 00:51:43.240 align:start position:0%
12 um if we looked at this two years ago
 
00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
our our vacancy um which is the second
 
00:51:50.990 --> 00:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
column of this chart um we had a vacancy
 
00:51:53.349 --> 00:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
rate approaching I think about a third
 
00:51:57.030 --> 00:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
um we've been fortunate to um be able to
 
00:51:59.670 --> 00:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
bring that down again thanks in part to
 
00:52:01.829 --> 00:52:01.839 align:start position:0%
the work the legislature did in terms of
 
00:52:04.349 --> 00:52:04.359 align:start position:0%
making wages better but also I think
 
00:52:06.990 --> 00:52:07.000 align:start position:0%
that we've done a lot of good things um
 
00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
in terms of improving policies in
 
00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
Medicaid um that make it a more
 
00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
interesting place for people who want to
 
00:52:15.789 --> 00:52:15.799 align:start position:0%
contribute to that activity as a place
 
00:52:18.150 --> 00:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
to work so we're grateful for what has
 
00:52:20.549 --> 00:52:20.559 align:start position:0%
been done
 
00:52:24.870 --> 00:52:24.880 align:start position:0%
um and um so um in terms of our
 
00:52:29.230 --> 00:52:29.240 align:start position:0%
vacancies uh today we have three um we
 
00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
have um in the budget process we had
 
00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
three uh positions that were unfunded
 
00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
and two that were
 
00:52:41.510 --> 00:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
um um I'm not sure what the right term
 
00:52:45.270 --> 00:52:45.280 align:start position:0%
is eliminated that were um during the
 
00:52:46.870 --> 00:52:46.880 align:start position:0%
the re
 
00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
uh review of how people would be um
 
00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
compensated some people went from um
 
00:52:55.789 --> 00:52:55.799 align:start position:0%
classified position to unclassified the
 
00:52:58.270 --> 00:52:58.280 align:start position:0%
the UN um the classified positions were
 
00:53:00.270 --> 00:53:00.280 align:start position:0%
abolished um and they were clinical
 
00:53:01.789 --> 00:53:01.799 align:start position:0%
people where that's where there were a
 
00:53:05.589 --> 00:53:05.599 align:start position:0%
lot of wage pressures and um and so
 
00:53:07.309 --> 00:53:07.319 align:start position:0%
that's kind of I think what's happened
 
00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:10.240 align:start position:0%
there um I'm not sure if there anything
 
00:53:12.549 --> 00:53:12.559 align:start position:0%
else you would add there to what I just
 
00:53:12.559 --> 00:53:16.069 align:start position:0%
else you would add there to what I just
described

00:53:16.069 --> 00:53:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
no so um now getting into um uh starting
 
00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
on slide 14 we're gonna U sort of work
 
00:53:27.549 --> 00:53:27.559 align:start position:0%
through the
 
00:53:30.589 --> 00:53:30.599 align:start position:0%
um the budget briefing book is as um
 
00:53:35.390 --> 00:53:35.400 align:start position:0%
Nathan had um relayed earlier um I think
 
00:53:38.750 --> 00:53:38.760 align:start position:0%
um we've tried to in red put a couple of
 
00:53:41.829 --> 00:53:41.839 align:start position:0%
uh key takeaways but as we go through
 
00:53:45.349 --> 00:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
this I'm going to try to um give you
 
00:53:47.309 --> 00:53:47.319 align:start position:0%
some Concepts about what's going on in a
 
00:53:49.270 --> 00:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
particular area and then get into the
 
00:53:53.150 --> 00:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
numbers so um in
 
00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
1371 was the maternal opioid misuse
 
00:54:00.670 --> 00:54:00.680 align:start position:0%
model model this was a um a centers for
 
00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Medicare service demonstration
 
00:54:05.950 --> 00:54:05.960 align:start position:0%
model um that uh runs through um
 
00:54:09.069 --> 00:54:09.079 align:start position:0%
December of of this year uh it's been
 
00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
was originally intended to be a
 
00:54:12.549 --> 00:54:12.559 align:start position:0%
five-year model um it was allowed to go
 
00:54:15.470 --> 00:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
on for six years because of the pandemic
 
00:54:18.630 --> 00:54:18.640 align:start position:0%
um it was a a pilot project in the
 
00:54:21.589 --> 00:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
greater Manchester area to um try to
 
00:54:25.150 --> 00:54:25.160 align:start position:0%
help moms um and children when there was
 
00:54:29.829 --> 00:54:29.839 align:start position:0%
opioids um involvement to um to have a
 
00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:32.640 align:start position:0%
successful pregnancy and and successful
 
00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
aspect with their children um we're not
 
00:54:38.750 --> 00:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
asking for any funds in this one so this
 
00:54:41.109 --> 00:54:41.119 align:start position:0%
this I think is a fairly straightforward
 
00:54:41.119 --> 00:54:42.109 align:start position:0%
this I think is a fairly straightforward
um

00:54:42.109 --> 00:54:42.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:44.910 --> 00:54:44.920 align:start position:0%
area representative walner for question
 
00:54:47.190 --> 00:54:47.200 align:start position:0%
just a really simple question how many
 
00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
um mothers and children were involved in
 
00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
this program um it obviously there's
 
00:54:55.190 --> 00:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
turnover I think today we're running
 
00:54:59.710 --> 00:54:59.720 align:start position:0%
about 137 mothers in the program thank
 
00:55:03.589 --> 00:55:03.599 align:start position:0%
you representative priest for a
 
00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
question yes and how many mothers are
 
00:55:11.589 --> 00:55:11.599 align:start position:0%
there now that are out there that are
 
00:55:14.349 --> 00:55:14.359 align:start position:0%
needing a program like this and we have
 
00:55:14.359 --> 00:55:16.030 align:start position:0%
needing a program like this and we have
no

00:55:16.030 --> 00:55:16.040 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:55:18.109 --> 00:55:18.119 align:start position:0%
program um well the program is
 
00:55:19.829 --> 00:55:19.839 align:start position:0%
continuing to December we're we're
 
00:55:21.910 --> 00:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
working on part of these demonstrations
 
00:55:24.309 --> 00:55:24.319 align:start position:0%
are to there to learn and to then to
 
00:55:27.950 --> 00:55:27.960 align:start position:0%
look at how you would um change other
 
00:55:29.710 --> 00:55:29.720 align:start position:0%
things that we're doing and certainly
 
00:55:33.069 --> 00:55:33.079 align:start position:0%
within um the policies that have been um
 
00:55:34.829 --> 00:55:34.839 align:start position:0%
approved by the legislature for example
 
00:55:36.630 --> 00:55:36.640 align:start position:0%
when we got this grant there was not 12
 
00:55:39.109 --> 00:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
months of continuous coverage postpartum
 
00:55:41.990 --> 00:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
coverage there was not um you've
 
00:55:45.630 --> 00:55:45.640 align:start position:0%
approved duelas you've approved um don't
 
00:55:48.829 --> 00:55:48.839 align:start position:0%
lactation Services donor breast milk um
 
00:55:51.349 --> 00:55:51.359 align:start position:0%
there there there's continuous coverage
 
00:55:52.670 --> 00:55:52.680 align:start position:0%
for children so there are a lot of
 
00:55:56.069 --> 00:55:56.079 align:start position:0%
things that have come into play during
 
00:55:59.150 --> 00:55:59.160 align:start position:0%
this demonstration we're also you know
 
00:56:01.349 --> 00:56:01.359 align:start position:0%
um working on thinking through how we
 
00:56:03.829 --> 00:56:03.839 align:start position:0%
can take that demonstration experience
 
00:56:06.430 --> 00:56:06.440 align:start position:0%
and and I don't have the answer today of
 
00:56:08.109 --> 00:56:08.119 align:start position:0%
how we're going to U utilize it
 
00:56:09.710 --> 00:56:09.720 align:start position:0%
completely but you know we're trying to
 
00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
learn from the model to figure out how
 
00:56:14.150 --> 00:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
we can with with funding that is no
 
00:56:15.309 --> 00:56:15.319 align:start position:0%
longer coming from the federal
 
00:56:17.870 --> 00:56:17.880 align:start position:0%
government to to continue to advance
 
00:56:20.789 --> 00:56:20.799 align:start position:0%

00:56:20.799 --> 00:56:23.069 align:start position:0%
progress um for for women and their and
their

00:56:23.069 --> 00:56:23.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:27.109 --> 00:56:27.119 align:start position:0%
children thank you
 
00:56:31.589 --> 00:56:31.599 align:start position:0%
um the the next uh section still on uh
 
00:56:35.069 --> 00:56:35.079 align:start position:0%
page 14 but on the in the budget book is
 
00:56:38.589 --> 00:56:38.599 align:start position:0%
88 886 886 the governor's oper yep the
 
00:56:40.950 --> 00:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
governor's operating
 
00:56:45.109 --> 00:56:45.119 align:start position:0%
budget and here we're talking about um a
 
00:56:48.589 --> 00:56:48.599 align:start position:0%
grant that New Hampshire applied for
 
00:56:52.430 --> 00:56:52.440 align:start position:0%
Medicaid to schools is a program that I
 
00:56:54.029 --> 00:56:54.039 align:start position:0%
think sometimes gets conflated with
 
00:56:57.910 --> 00:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
other concerns um out there about what
 
00:56:59.349 --> 00:56:59.359 align:start position:0%
happens in schools but Medicaid to
 
00:57:02.549 --> 00:57:02.559 align:start position:0%
schools is really a targeted program um
 
00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:06.640 align:start position:0%
to help children who have either medical
 
00:57:09.190 --> 00:57:09.200 align:start position:0%
or disability conditions or both to be
 
00:57:11.069 --> 00:57:11.079 align:start position:0%
able to accomplish their learning in
 
00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
school and so for example someone who
 
00:57:16.829 --> 00:57:16.839 align:start position:0%
might a child that might need insulin uh
 
00:57:19.430 --> 00:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
shots or medication during the day that
 
00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
or they might need physical therapy or
 
00:57:25.109 --> 00:57:25.119 align:start position:0%
or or a rehab assistance to be able to
 
00:57:28.349 --> 00:57:28.359 align:start position:0%
to uh uh do learning that there's a way
 
00:57:31.670 --> 00:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
for the the state to uh obtain matching
 
00:57:34.670 --> 00:57:34.680 align:start position:0%
funds that actually 100% go to the
 
00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:35.589 align:start position:0%
funds that actually 100% go to the
school

00:57:35.589 --> 00:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:57:40.270 --> 00:57:40.280 align:start position:0%
districts so we New Hampshire has had a
 
00:57:44.430 --> 00:57:44.440 align:start position:0%
claiming methodology um which has been
 
00:57:46.670 --> 00:57:46.680 align:start position:0%
longstanding that is being phased out by
 
00:57:50.349 --> 00:57:50.359 align:start position:0%
the federal government by July 1 of 26
 
00:57:51.710 --> 00:57:51.720 align:start position:0%
we have to be on a new claiming
 
00:57:55.390 --> 00:57:55.400 align:start position:0%
methodology so we sought this grant um
 
00:57:58.750 --> 00:57:58.760 align:start position:0%
it uh it's a three-year Grant uh this
 
00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
represents the first period is in the
 
00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
budget but ultimately we hope to be able
 
00:58:08.829 --> 00:58:08.839 align:start position:0%
to draw $2.7 million at at the max um to
 
00:58:11.109 --> 00:58:11.119 align:start position:0%
be able to support school districts in
 
00:58:14.549 --> 00:58:14.559 align:start position:0%
transitioning to um a cost based
 
00:58:17.230 --> 00:58:17.240 align:start position:0%
methodology and the advantage of that
 
00:58:19.630 --> 00:58:19.640 align:start position:0%
for the school districts
 
00:58:22.349 --> 00:58:22.359 align:start position:0%
is for those of you who are familiar
 
00:58:25.069 --> 00:58:25.079 align:start position:0%
with what happens at the county level
 
00:58:28.950 --> 00:58:28.960 align:start position:0%
the the county nursing homes um are able
 
00:58:30.789 --> 00:58:30.799 align:start position:0%
to get additional reimbursement to fill
 
00:58:32.789 --> 00:58:32.799 align:start position:0%
in part of the gap between what Medicaid
 
00:58:34.670 --> 00:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
pays and and the cost in the nursing
 
00:58:38.829 --> 00:58:38.839 align:start position:0%
home um that those uncovered costs that
 
00:58:40.349 --> 00:58:40.359 align:start position:0%
are less than what Medicare would
 
00:58:43.150 --> 00:58:43.160 align:start position:0%
otherwise pay that we make a a payment
 
00:58:46.510 --> 00:58:46.520 align:start position:0%
to sort of fill part of that Gap similar
 
00:58:49.309 --> 00:58:49.319 align:start position:0%
schools can do something similar to that
 
00:58:52.390 --> 00:58:52.400 align:start position:0%
um where instead of getting the the
 
00:58:55.349 --> 00:58:55.359 align:start position:0%
contribution that the school is making
 
00:58:57.710 --> 00:58:57.720 align:start position:0%
towards the the cost which is
 
00:59:00.789 --> 00:59:00.799 align:start position:0%
50% we we we have historically
 
00:59:02.990 --> 00:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
administered that as half the fee
 
00:59:05.670 --> 00:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
schedule represents half the real cost
 
00:59:07.789 --> 00:59:07.799 align:start position:0%
and I suspect in many instances it's
 
00:59:10.670 --> 00:59:10.680 align:start position:0%
well below their real costs um and so
 
00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
this will put them on a on a um platform
 
00:59:17.150 --> 00:59:17.160 align:start position:0%
where they'll be able to claim half the
 
00:59:21.150 --> 00:59:21.160 align:start position:0%
cost and um that will I think provide
 
00:59:23.870 --> 00:59:23.880 align:start position:0%
more funding um and help school
 
00:59:25.630 --> 00:59:25.640 align:start position:0%
districts and property taxpayers with
 
00:59:28.069 --> 00:59:28.079 align:start position:0%
the cost of financing these services in
 
00:59:30.670 --> 00:59:30.680 align:start position:0%
the school environment I also do think
 
00:59:35.029 --> 00:59:35.039 align:start position:0%
that um it's worthy of some expl
 
00:59:40.549 --> 00:59:40.559 align:start position:0%
exploration in terms of uh the issue of
 
00:59:45.430 --> 00:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:48.670 --> 00:59:48.680 align:start position:0%
me the the the term here I'm looking for
 
00:59:50.270 --> 00:59:50.280 align:start position:0%
special education what the term I was
 
00:59:52.950 --> 00:59:52.960 align:start position:0%
looking for is where if you look at and
 
00:59:54.910 --> 00:59:54.920 align:start position:0%
we'll look at later on some of the the
 
00:59:57.470 --> 00:59:57.480 align:start position:0%
trends in the using this program have
 
01:00:00.069 --> 01:00:00.079 align:start position:0%
gone down quite a bit and you know are
 
01:00:01.710 --> 01:00:01.720 align:start position:0%
there opportunities to work better with
 
01:00:04.630 --> 01:00:04.640 align:start position:0%
the school districts and in getting um
 
01:00:07.589 --> 01:00:07.599 align:start position:0%
Medicaid participation instead of having
 
01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:10.200 align:start position:0%
to be 100% General funds or or what have
 
01:00:12.309 --> 01:00:12.319 align:start position:0%
you I'm not representing what that might
 
01:00:15.069 --> 01:00:15.079 align:start position:0%
be but that I do think that's worth uh
 
01:00:15.079 --> 01:00:16.829 align:start position:0%
be but that I do think that's worth uh
exploring

01:00:16.829 --> 01:00:16.839 align:start position:0%
exploring
 
01:00:20.309 --> 01:00:20.319 align:start position:0%
further and um basically this is to fund
 
01:00:22.630 --> 01:00:22.640 align:start position:0%
the technical support that we need to
 
01:00:26.349 --> 01:00:26.359 align:start position:0%
implement that program in 174
 
01:00:28.390 --> 01:00:28.400 align:start position:0%
different um local education
 
01:00:31.150 --> 01:00:31.160 align:start position:0%
administrative units in in the
 
01:00:34.870 --> 01:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
state representative priest for a
 
01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
question yes back on the Medica to
 
01:00:41.910 --> 01:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
schools Grant how many children are we
 
01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
um supporting now with the program and
 
01:00:46.990 --> 01:00:47.000 align:start position:0%
you said it's a three-year program
 
01:00:51.750 --> 01:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
starting this year so it will end in
 
01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
2028 uh Medicaid schools program is
 
01:00:57.630 --> 01:00:57.640 align:start position:0%
longstanding and will continue to
 
01:01:00.150 --> 01:01:00.160 align:start position:0%
what what we're doing is is getting our
 
01:01:01.829 --> 01:01:01.839 align:start position:0%
claiming methodology from the federal
 
01:01:03.990 --> 01:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
government in line with what it needs to
 
01:01:06.670 --> 01:01:06.680 align:start position:0%
be to continue to claim federal dollars
 
01:01:08.789 --> 01:01:08.799 align:start position:0%
I see okay and and the big thing that
 
01:01:10.710 --> 01:01:10.720 align:start position:0%
the federal government wants is they
 
01:01:12.549 --> 01:01:12.559 align:start position:0%
want to know what costs are and we've
 
01:01:14.910 --> 01:01:14.920 align:start position:0%
had to switch claiming methodologies in
 
01:01:16.750 --> 01:01:16.760 align:start position:0%
a number of different areas in in the
 
01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
state in terms of the Glen Cliff home
 
01:01:22.510 --> 01:01:22.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital um we we've in
 
01:01:24.789 --> 01:01:24.799 align:start position:0%
reforming the DD population payment
 
01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
system we've gone to a cost space system
 
01:01:28.990 --> 01:01:29.000 align:start position:0%
I think as legislators knowing what the
 
01:01:32.069 --> 01:01:32.079 align:start position:0%
cost of the services are and as a
 
01:01:34.270 --> 01:01:34.280 align:start position:0%
federal government it's in terms of
 
01:01:35.789 --> 01:01:35.799 align:start position:0%
looking at the adequacy of funding if
 
01:01:37.069 --> 01:01:37.079 align:start position:0%
you know what the true cost I think
 
01:01:38.750 --> 01:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
that's that's I think where the federal
 
01:01:40.549 --> 01:01:40.559 align:start position:0%
government's going with this but how
 
01:01:42.549 --> 01:01:42.559 align:start position:0%
many children are we uh providing
 
01:01:44.510 --> 01:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
services for so I think in our last
 
01:01:47.069 --> 01:01:47.079 align:start position:0%
report it was just under 9,000 children
 
01:01:49.950 --> 01:01:49.960 align:start position:0%
had um benefited from it and it has been
 
01:01:52.829 --> 01:01:52.839 align:start position:0%
a higher number in the past um I think
 
01:01:56.269 --> 01:01:56.279 align:start position:0%
at its peak we probably were closer to
 
01:01:57.589 --> 01:01:57.599 align:start position:0%
14 or
 
01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
15,000 um Medicaid's not an easy um
 
01:02:04.029 --> 01:02:04.039 align:start position:0%
thing to to master and I think um
 
01:02:05.549 --> 01:02:05.559 align:start position:0%
hopefully through this grant we'll be
 
01:02:08.589 --> 01:02:08.599 align:start position:0%
able to help um bring up the
 
01:02:12.230 --> 01:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
capabilities um in the state so that
 
01:02:13.910 --> 01:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
those dollars that the state's entitled
 
01:02:16.870 --> 01:02:16.880 align:start position:0%
to um in the school setting for those
 
01:02:19.269 --> 01:02:19.279 align:start position:0%
services that support learning um that
 
01:02:21.829 --> 01:02:21.839 align:start position:0%
will be able to access them and I think
 
01:02:25.470 --> 01:02:25.480 align:start position:0%
I see that number 9,000 on page 16 of
 
01:02:27.670 --> 01:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
the out is that the number you're
 
01:02:30.109 --> 01:02:30.119 align:start position:0%
referring to at the top there
 
01:02:32.990 --> 01:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
okay okay representative Neno for a
 
01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you uh Madam chair um
 
01:02:41.309 --> 01:02:41.319 align:start position:0%
so the change in claiming methodology so
 
01:02:45.990 --> 01:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
do you anticipate that that's a a net uh
 
01:02:50.309 --> 01:02:50.319 align:start position:0%
uh plus minus or no no change just
 
01:02:52.470 --> 01:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
attributable to methodology change is
 
01:02:55.349 --> 01:02:55.359 align:start position:0%
that you know likely to increase
 
01:02:58.829 --> 01:02:58.839 align:start position:0%
decrease costs or what's the net impact
 
01:03:01.390 --> 01:03:01.400 align:start position:0%
of that the net impact is favorable to
 
01:03:03.349 --> 01:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
the schools in terms of being able to
 
01:03:05.549 --> 01:03:05.559 align:start position:0%
get a higher level of match because I
 
01:03:08.390 --> 01:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
think their true costs are higher than
 
01:03:11.470 --> 01:03:11.480 align:start position:0%
what is recognized in our rates so for
 
01:03:15.230 --> 01:03:15.240 align:start position:0%
example if you're trying to to uh pay
 
01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
for a physical therapist who's in the
 
01:03:18.630 --> 01:03:18.640 align:start position:0%
school setting you might have to
 
01:03:21.309 --> 01:03:21.319 align:start position:0%
contract with them at $100 an hour or
 
01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
$100 per certain element and um we may
 
01:03:28.390 --> 01:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
not be paying enough to to pay someone
 
01:03:32.069 --> 01:03:32.079 align:start position:0%
at $100 per hour rate and so it will
 
01:03:34.269 --> 01:03:34.279 align:start position:0%
help close that
 
01:03:37.910 --> 01:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
Gap thank you okay Mr liman we are at
 
01:03:39.950 --> 01:03:39.960 align:start position:0%
the one hour point I want to make sure
 
01:03:41.470 --> 01:03:41.480 align:start position:0%
that uh everybody's comfortable here
 
01:03:43.349 --> 01:03:43.359 align:start position:0%
it's a very intense topic if you need a
 
01:03:45.670 --> 01:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
break or anything along that line we are
 
01:03:49.470 --> 01:03:49.480 align:start position:0%
on page what 16 or so of 70 so you lead
 
01:03:51.069 --> 01:03:51.079 align:start position:0%
the way Mr Litman but I want to make
 
01:03:53.309 --> 01:03:53.319 align:start position:0%
sure you're completely at ease here sure
 
01:03:56.349 --> 01:03:56.359 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm I'm I'm fine okay if you
 
01:03:57.789 --> 01:03:57.799 align:start position:0%
are and the way the flow of the
 
01:03:59.630 --> 01:03:59.640 align:start position:0%
questions are going that's okay with you
 
01:04:00.950 --> 01:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
yes real good and I appreciate the
 
01:04:02.269 --> 01:04:02.279 align:start position:0%
members being patient I don't have the
 
01:04:03.910 --> 01:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
benefit of a vice chair to tell me when
 
01:04:06.430 --> 01:04:06.440 align:start position:0%
a question is waiting so I appreciate
 
01:04:08.510 --> 01:04:08.520 align:start position:0%
everyone just being patient while I look
 
01:04:10.390 --> 01:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
around to see if there are questions
 
01:04:14.829 --> 01:04:14.839 align:start position:0%
thank you you may proceed so page 15 um
 
01:04:21.789 --> 01:04:21.799 align:start position:0%
and Page um it 887 of the governor's uh
 
01:04:25.950 --> 01:04:25.960 align:start position:0%
budget um is the adult dental program
 
01:04:29.870 --> 01:04:29.880 align:start position:0%
and what you're seeing here in this um
 
01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
page is the adult dental program from
 
01:04:35.349 --> 01:04:35.359 align:start position:0%
the standard program there there's also
 
01:04:37.549 --> 01:04:37.559 align:start position:0%
the adult dental program goes into
 
01:04:41.990 --> 01:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
granted Advantage um the the dollars to
 
01:04:45.910 --> 01:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
cover the adult dental program today um
 
01:04:49.309 --> 01:04:49.319 align:start position:0%
from 2023 through um we anticipate
 
01:04:52.230 --> 01:04:52.240 align:start position:0%
through this whole B Anum the state had
 
01:04:56.109 --> 01:04:56.119 align:start position:0%
a uh a settlement with one of the MCO
 
01:04:59.349 --> 01:04:59.359 align:start position:0%
companies um that is providing 100% of
 
01:05:02.870 --> 01:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
the the state share um you know for that
 
01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:04.029 align:start position:0%
the the state share um you know for that
time

01:05:04.029 --> 01:05:04.039 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:05:06.589 --> 01:05:06.599 align:start position:0%
period so the the dollars that are
 
01:05:08.750 --> 01:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
represented here are those coming from
 
01:05:11.150 --> 01:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
that settlement and a federal match if
 
01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
you'll notice it's also gone down um you
 
01:05:17.109 --> 01:05:17.119 align:start position:0%
know when we first scoped out the
 
01:05:20.029 --> 01:05:20.039 align:start position:0%
program we didn't know how many dentist
 
01:05:22.150 --> 01:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
would actually enroll in the
 
01:05:25.710 --> 01:05:25.720 align:start position:0%
program um we've we've grown up to over9
 
01:05:30.589 --> 01:05:30.599 align:start position:0%
0 dentists in the program um we've also
 
01:05:34.150 --> 01:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
um used mobile Dental Services fully
 
01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
equipped uh Dental uh uh oper operating
 
01:05:40.430 --> 01:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
environments which include a dentist and
 
01:05:44.190 --> 01:05:44.200 align:start position:0%
um staff that we actually even some uh
 
01:05:46.470 --> 01:05:46.480 align:start position:0%
many weekends were providing Dental
 
01:05:49.029 --> 01:05:49.039 align:start position:0%
access on Saturday and Sunday um at
 
01:05:50.750 --> 01:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
different locations throughout the state
 
01:05:53.269 --> 01:05:53.279 align:start position:0%
where we have a shortage of of dental
 
01:05:56.269 --> 01:05:56.279 align:start position:0%
providers uh but uh what reflect here is
 
01:05:58.150 --> 01:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
an expectation of where we think we are
 
01:06:00.430 --> 01:06:00.440 align:start position:0%
based on actual experience um Delta
 
01:06:02.029 --> 01:06:02.039 align:start position:0%
Dental has been an excellent partner in
 
01:06:03.750 --> 01:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
terms of working with us and trying to
 
01:06:05.829 --> 01:06:05.839 align:start position:0%
to grow the the dental network and we're
 
01:06:07.990 --> 01:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
hoping over time that we'll continue to
 
01:06:10.029 --> 01:06:10.039 align:start position:0%
see growth and be able to serve people
 
01:06:12.269 --> 01:06:12.279 align:start position:0%
but what's in here is what we reasonably
 
01:06:14.269 --> 01:06:14.279 align:start position:0%
expect based on where we are today
 
01:06:16.910 --> 01:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham for a question
 
01:06:19.309 --> 01:06:19.319 align:start position:0%
so according to uh the brief um the
 
01:06:21.829 --> 01:06:21.839 align:start position:0%
budget uh the actual
 
01:06:25.349 --> 01:06:25.359 align:start position:0%
expenditures uh in uh 2024 were about 11
 
01:06:28.789 --> 01:06:28.799 align:start position:0%
and half million and you're projecting
 
01:06:32.589 --> 01:06:32.599 align:start position:0%
7.2 million now and it would seem like
 
01:06:34.670 --> 01:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
there would have been more uh providers
 
01:06:37.510 --> 01:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
online was there just huge penup demand
 
01:06:40.390 --> 01:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
and or what is there any uh any
 
01:06:43.510 --> 01:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
explanation for you know 30 40% decrease
 
01:06:49.029 --> 01:06:49.039 align:start position:0%
in Services sure so I I I'm not I think
 
01:06:51.349 --> 01:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
I need to go back and look at why it's
 
01:06:53.630 --> 01:06:53.640 align:start position:0%
showing up as actual expense that year
 
01:06:55.549 --> 01:06:55.559 align:start position:0%
but when I'm looking at today's expense
 
01:06:57.630 --> 01:06:57.640 align:start position:0%
expenditures year to date we've seen
 
01:07:01.349 --> 01:07:01.359 align:start position:0%
about 22 million of expenditures year-to
 
01:07:03.430 --> 01:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
date in this state fiscal year which is
 
01:07:04.950 --> 01:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
much more consistent with the amounts
 
01:07:07.710 --> 01:07:07.720 align:start position:0%
that we've budgeted in subsequent years
 
01:07:11.390 --> 01:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
is that um is that all funds or or or
 
01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
just general funds that's total well
 
01:07:15.069 --> 01:07:15.079 align:start position:0%
there are no General funds in this
 
01:07:16.549 --> 01:07:16.559 align:start position:0%
accounting units is federal and the
 
01:07:18.670 --> 01:07:18.680 align:start position:0%
other funds from the centine
 
01:07:21.589 --> 01:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
settlement so um one of the things we
 
01:07:23.870 --> 01:07:23.880 align:start position:0%
did which I think was an excellent
 
01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
business practice is
 
01:07:28.990 --> 01:07:29.000 align:start position:0%
and um if you follow the news in some
 
01:07:32.069 --> 01:07:32.079 align:start position:0%
other states we actually put a minimum
 
01:07:35.109 --> 01:07:35.119 align:start position:0%
medical loss ratio or dental loss ratio
 
01:07:38.390 --> 01:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
to make sure that if they didn't spend a
 
01:07:41.269 --> 01:07:41.279 align:start position:0%
certain amount of money that anything um
 
01:07:44.069 --> 01:07:44.079 align:start position:0%
below above below excuse me below that
 
01:07:46.349 --> 01:07:46.359 align:start position:0%
ratio would come back to the state so I
 
01:07:48.349 --> 01:07:48.359 align:start position:0%
think what's not reflected in there yet
 
01:07:49.950 --> 01:07:49.960 align:start position:0%
in the actual experience is that we are
 
01:07:53.150 --> 01:07:53.160 align:start position:0%
going to get a refund on on
 
01:07:56.269 --> 01:07:56.279 align:start position:0%
that representative tarki for question
 
01:07:58.470 --> 01:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
thanks um I just sort of have an
 
01:08:01.510 --> 01:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
anecdotal um perspective of the adult
 
01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:04.799 align:start position:0%
dental program when I see constituents
 
01:08:06.670 --> 01:08:06.680 align:start position:0%
comment on like a local Facebook page
 
01:08:09.109 --> 01:08:09.119 align:start position:0%
saying I can't find a provider that
 
01:08:11.630 --> 01:08:11.640 align:start position:0%
takes the program now there's obviously
 
01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
a very large demand I do know the
 
01:08:15.870 --> 01:08:15.880 align:start position:0%
program has been successful where it can
 
01:08:18.269 --> 01:08:18.279 align:start position:0%
actually be utilized do you have any
 
01:08:21.309 --> 01:08:21.319 align:start position:0%
idea of what we actually need in terms
 
01:08:23.269 --> 01:08:23.279 align:start position:0%
of number of providers to provide the
 
01:08:26.189 --> 01:08:26.199 align:start position:0%
service that's actually needed
 
01:08:28.070 --> 01:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
um I can give you an answer but I'd
 
01:08:31.309 --> 01:08:31.319 align:start position:0%
rather consult with a dental director to
 
01:08:33.470 --> 01:08:33.480 align:start position:0%
to give you a more precise answer but I
 
01:08:35.630 --> 01:08:35.640 align:start position:0%
do think that
 
01:08:40.070 --> 01:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
um we we are seeing an increasing number
 
01:08:42.709 --> 01:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
of individuals and if someone is having
 
01:08:45.149 --> 01:08:45.159 align:start position:0%
a problem that you know of as a
 
01:08:49.110 --> 01:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
constituent please call me and we'll um
 
01:08:52.189 --> 01:08:52.199 align:start position:0%
you know we we have actually um when we
 
01:08:54.189 --> 01:08:54.199 align:start position:0%
do the mobile sites we have lists of
 
01:08:57.070 --> 01:08:57.080 align:start position:0%
people who we can call last minute like
 
01:08:59.630 --> 01:08:59.640 align:start position:0%
you see dental office sometimes do that
 
01:09:01.709 --> 01:09:01.719 align:start position:0%
um we're you know they're on standby if
 
01:09:03.390 --> 01:09:03.400 align:start position:0%
someone else doesn't show up that we can
 
01:09:06.189 --> 01:09:06.199 align:start position:0%
fill that space so um I think we're
 
01:09:09.950 --> 01:09:09.960 align:start position:0%
doing all all we can um to ex extend it
 
01:09:12.430 --> 01:09:12.440 align:start position:0%
and I think it's going to be with time
 
01:09:15.550 --> 01:09:15.560 align:start position:0%
that um you know other dentists will
 
01:09:17.550 --> 01:09:17.560 align:start position:0%
will hopefully join the program I think
 
01:09:19.829 --> 01:09:19.839 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's fortunate we now have
 
01:09:22.309 --> 01:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
the president of the Ada for the for the
 
01:09:25.789 --> 01:09:25.799 align:start position:0%
country is now a dentist from New
 
01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:29.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so I'm hoping that we can
 
01:09:31.470 --> 01:09:31.480 align:start position:0%
continue to build the network
 
01:09:34.269 --> 01:09:34.279 align:start position:0%
we I think that we'd like to see have
 
01:09:36.510 --> 01:09:36.520 align:start position:0%
seen it even better but i' say based on
 
01:09:38.349 --> 01:09:38.359 align:start position:0%
what we've done it's it's gone pretty
 
01:09:40.829 --> 01:09:40.839 align:start position:0%
well there's still room to grow and
 
01:09:43.229 --> 01:09:43.239 align:start position:0%
improve great thank you for that
 
01:09:45.110 --> 01:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
representative nil vano followed by
 
01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:46.390 align:start position:0%
representative nil vano followed by
representative

01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:09:49.149 --> 01:09:49.159 align:start position:0%
Stringham just a a quick question so
 
01:09:52.430 --> 01:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
this is uh preventative care as as
 
01:09:55.750 --> 01:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
preventative care as well as you know um
 
01:09:59.990 --> 01:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
I'll call emergency care or there's um
 
01:10:03.070 --> 01:10:03.080 align:start position:0%
we can provide you with what the the um
 
01:10:05.470 --> 01:10:05.480 align:start position:0%
coverages But it includes preventative
 
01:10:07.910 --> 01:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
care includes fillings it includes it
 
01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
does not include uh know like gum
 
01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
surgery per se but it what you would
 
01:10:17.310 --> 01:10:17.320 align:start position:0%
typically find in a commercial Dental uh
 
01:10:20.310 --> 01:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
benefit um you would see in this program
 
01:10:22.590 --> 01:10:22.600 align:start position:0%
but we actually in the legislation
 
01:10:25.310 --> 01:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
there's specific uh that adopted the
 
01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
program there's some exclusion of
 
01:10:29.990 --> 01:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
certain services but for example the um
 
01:10:32.030 --> 01:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
people in waiver people in nursing home
 
01:10:34.750 --> 01:10:34.760 align:start position:0%
have access to Dentures um as part of
 
01:10:37.870 --> 01:10:37.880 align:start position:0%
this program so you know the one of the
 
01:10:39.430 --> 01:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
things that can cause a person to
 
01:10:40.990 --> 01:10:41.000 align:start position:0%
deteriorate is not being able to eat
 
01:10:45.550 --> 01:10:45.560 align:start position:0%
right and so um again the um with the
 
01:10:47.390 --> 01:10:47.400 align:start position:0%
leadership from the legislature there
 
01:10:51.270 --> 01:10:51.280 align:start position:0%
was a a willingness to add um Dentures
 
01:10:53.870 --> 01:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
for certain populations um other
 
01:10:56.510 --> 01:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
populations were excluded
 
01:10:58.910 --> 01:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
just just very quick so that's the
 
01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
preventative care would be I think
 
01:11:04.430 --> 01:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
typically two two checkups a year y
 
01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:08.310 align:start position:0%
typically two two checkups a year y
cleanings

01:11:08.310 --> 01:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:12.030 --> 01:11:12.040 align:start position:0%
and it's I think it's a it's a program
 
01:11:14.709 --> 01:11:14.719 align:start position:0%
that many people worked hard on for many
 
01:11:17.470 --> 01:11:17.480 align:start position:0%
many years decades even to bring about
 
01:11:20.950 --> 01:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
and um I think we're we're fortunate uh
 
01:11:24.390 --> 01:11:24.400 align:start position:0%
what we're able to deliver here um the
 
01:11:27.790 --> 01:11:27.800 align:start position:0%
next uh representative Stringham uh just
 
01:11:30.830 --> 01:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
if you could share um not not today but
 
01:11:32.550 --> 01:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
if you have anything about the rates and
 
01:11:35.070 --> 01:11:35.080 align:start position:0%
whether there's been any feedback from
 
01:11:37.550 --> 01:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
providers who have signed up of whether
 
01:11:40.590 --> 01:11:40.600 align:start position:0%
the uh rates are adequate for them uh
 
01:11:42.910 --> 01:11:42.920 align:start position:0%
you know to to take the Medicaid
 
01:11:44.870 --> 01:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
patients over others that may come to
 
01:11:47.510 --> 01:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
their doors I'd appreciate it we can do
 
01:11:49.950 --> 01:11:49.960 align:start position:0%
that if I could comment though that when
 
01:11:53.910 --> 01:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
you did the the rate increases in HB 2
 
01:11:55.629 --> 01:11:55.639 align:start position:0%
of 2023
 
01:11:58.070 --> 01:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
um we were able to make our children's
 
01:12:01.110 --> 01:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
and adult Dental rates I think probably
 
01:12:02.830 --> 01:12:02.840 align:start position:0%
you know very competitive what other
 
01:12:06.870 --> 01:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
Medicaid programs um are able to pay um
 
01:12:08.350 --> 01:12:08.360 align:start position:0%
I think we're probably somewhere around
 
01:12:11.310 --> 01:12:11.320 align:start position:0%
72% on average of the the commercial
 
01:12:13.070 --> 01:12:13.080 align:start position:0%
market in terms of the rate for dental
 
01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:14.149 align:start position:0%
market in terms of the rate for dental
services

01:12:14.149 --> 01:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:12:17.629 --> 01:12:17.639 align:start position:0%
today and just on the all set just on
 
01:12:20.390 --> 01:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
the topic of the sentin settlement it
 
01:12:23.350 --> 01:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
would appear that that is uh a pilot
 
01:12:26.430 --> 01:12:26.440 align:start position:0%
program is that fair to say um well I
 
01:12:28.910 --> 01:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
think it I I don't think it would be
 
01:12:31.149 --> 01:12:31.159 align:start position:0%
fair to call a pilot it's a it's the
 
01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
funding that I think that was available
 
01:12:36.590 --> 01:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
to get this program over the Finish Line
 
01:12:37.870 --> 01:12:37.880 align:start position:0%
If you will
 
01:12:40.110 --> 01:12:40.120 align:start position:0%
legislatively it remains to be seen once
 
01:12:43.070 --> 01:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
that's run out whether you know it will
 
01:12:44.870 --> 01:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
continue but we're hoping it does well
 
01:12:46.629 --> 01:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
that leads to my next question uh it
 
01:12:48.550 --> 01:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
would seem in the circumstance that data
 
01:12:52.070 --> 01:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
is needed uh for future budgets and uh
 
01:12:54.350 --> 01:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
anything you could provide related to
 
01:12:58.510 --> 01:12:58.520 align:start position:0%
that would be helpful sure so at this
 
01:13:00.350 --> 01:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
point in time at the end of the bium
 
01:13:03.750 --> 01:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
we're we're projecting about a $960,000
 
01:13:07.669 --> 01:13:07.679 align:start position:0%
u balance of the centine funds so we we
 
01:13:10.110 --> 01:13:10.120 align:start position:0%
anticipate having sufficient other funds
 
01:13:12.870 --> 01:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
to support the program through this bium
 
01:13:16.189 --> 01:13:16.199 align:start position:0%
but um beginning in the next bium we
 
01:13:18.189 --> 01:13:18.199 align:start position:0%
will we will need to address that that
 
01:13:19.870 --> 01:13:19.880 align:start position:0%
question of how will this program be
 
01:13:21.070 --> 01:13:21.080 align:start position:0%
funded going
 
01:13:22.950 --> 01:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
forward thank you and that's where I
 
01:13:25.189 --> 01:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
think the data will be very helpful and
 
01:13:27.430 --> 01:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
terms of future budgeting for the
 
01:13:30.830 --> 01:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
continuation of said program we do make
 
01:13:32.270 --> 01:13:32.280 align:start position:0%
regular reports to Health and Human
 
01:13:34.510 --> 01:13:34.520 align:start position:0%
Service oversight that we can share that
 
01:13:36.709 --> 01:13:36.719 align:start position:0%
with this committee as well in terms of
 
01:13:37.910 --> 01:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
that type of
 
01:13:39.669 --> 01:13:39.679 align:start position:0%
information perfect thank you
 
01:13:41.510 --> 01:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
representative priest for a question
 
01:13:43.270 --> 01:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman again that
 
01:13:45.950 --> 01:13:45.960 align:start position:0%
number of unused funds going to be
 
01:13:47.470 --> 01:13:47.480 align:start position:0%
applied for
 
01:13:52.030 --> 01:13:52.040 align:start position:0%
this so so the we we're projecting for
 
01:13:55.110 --> 01:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
the end of State fiscal year 25 about
 
01:13:55.870 --> 01:13:55.880 align:start position:0%
about $
 
01:13:57.750 --> 01:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
11.5 U
 
01:13:59.629 --> 01:13:59.639 align:start position:0%
million and then at the end of the
 
01:14:03.790 --> 01:14:03.800 align:start position:0%
subsequent bium about $950,000
 
01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
but again that'll depend on
 
01:14:09.149 --> 01:14:09.159 align:start position:0%
utilization okay thank
 
01:14:13.629 --> 01:14:13.639 align:start position:0%
you go ahead Mr Litman thank you um
 
01:14:17.070 --> 01:14:17.080 align:start position:0%
bottom of page uh 15 is the children's
 
01:14:19.510 --> 01:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
health insurance program which uh oops
 
01:14:21.030 --> 01:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
of course
 
01:14:25.629 --> 01:14:25.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:28.510 --> 01:14:28.520 align:start position:0%
my computer is not
 
01:14:32.950 --> 01:14:32.960 align:start position:0%
responding that begins on um page eight
 
01:14:37.430 --> 01:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh 900 um towards the bottom goes on to
 
01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:38.629 align:start position:0%
uh 900 um towards the bottom goes on to
uh

01:14:38.629 --> 01:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:14:42.070 --> 01:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
901 um if you're a member of fiscal
 
01:14:44.590 --> 01:14:44.600 align:start position:0%
committee um you may have heard this
 
01:14:48.310 --> 01:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
morning that we had a transfer into this
 
01:14:53.550 --> 01:14:53.560 align:start position:0%
um account uh that we made we we began
 
01:14:56.149 --> 01:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
separately um accounting for the
 
01:14:57.750 --> 01:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
children's health insurance program
 
01:15:00.910 --> 01:15:00.920 align:start position:0%
where we get the enhanced Federal match
 
01:15:03.189 --> 01:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
separately the time we made the original
 
01:15:05.189 --> 01:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
projections and starting to do this we
 
01:15:06.870 --> 01:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
had a few things that came up that
 
01:15:08.470 --> 01:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
weren't anticipated like the federal
 
01:15:10.149 --> 01:15:10.159 align:start position:0%
Public Health Emergency and continuous
 
01:15:13.790 --> 01:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
enrollment we also had um a federal
 
01:15:15.350 --> 01:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
requirement to cover children for 12
 
01:15:19.149 --> 01:15:19.159 align:start position:0%
months continuously so I think based on
 
01:15:20.950 --> 01:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
going into this budget we have a better
 
01:15:24.229 --> 01:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
sense of of the experience and um we're
 
01:15:27.110 --> 01:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
also reflective in here I think is a
 
01:15:29.709 --> 01:15:29.719 align:start position:0%
point where
 
01:15:33.350 --> 01:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
um uh number two
 
01:15:36.870 --> 01:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
um comes into play uh that was on the
 
01:15:38.790 --> 01:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
the sheet earlier in terms of the the
 
01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
ultimate costs that will be incurred
 
01:15:43.709 --> 01:15:43.719 align:start position:0%
here you want to address that just for
 
01:15:46.390 --> 01:15:46.400 align:start position:0%
clarification here we are on page
 
01:15:49.470 --> 01:15:49.480 align:start position:0%
890 of the governor's budget at this
 
01:15:55.669 --> 01:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
point um 9901 is what I have uh 8
 
01:15:58.110 --> 01:15:58.120 align:start position:0%
yeah so so the the children's health
 
01:15:59.629 --> 01:15:59.639 align:start position:0%
insurance program accounting unit is
 
01:16:02.510 --> 01:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
7051 it begins on page
 
01:16:05.669 --> 01:16:05.679 align:start position:0%
887 and then it continues on to
 
01:16:09.110 --> 01:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
888 great sorry I gave you the PDF
 
01:16:12.750 --> 01:16:12.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:17.669 --> 01:16:17.679 align:start position:0%
okay okay proceed so I think what we're
 
01:16:20.229 --> 01:16:20.239 align:start position:0%
we're seeing here in part is what's
 
01:16:22.790 --> 01:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
factored into the governor's budget is
 
01:16:27.950 --> 01:16:27.960 align:start position:0%
um revenue from um premiums and we are
 
01:16:30.270 --> 01:16:30.280 align:start position:0%
um going to make a budget adjustment in
 
01:16:33.270 --> 01:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
terms of How It's in budget adjustment
 
01:16:36.590 --> 01:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
request what we feel is the the the
 
01:16:38.149 --> 01:16:38.159 align:start position:0%
revenue that's brought in from premiums
 
01:16:40.430 --> 01:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
should be shown as a revenue as opposed
 
01:16:43.350 --> 01:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
to netting it into the expenses but the
 
01:16:46.110 --> 01:16:46.120 align:start position:0%
effect is ultimately the the same um
 
01:16:48.430 --> 01:16:48.440 align:start position:0%
what we're anticipating
 
01:16:52.950 --> 01:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
in Revenue um or which is effectively
 
01:16:55.310 --> 01:16:55.320 align:start position:0%
expense reduction is about 3.3 3 million
 
01:16:58.110 --> 01:16:58.120 align:start position:0%
in the first year and about 11 million
 
01:17:01.229 --> 01:17:01.239 align:start position:0%
in the second year and the reason
 
01:17:02.510 --> 01:17:02.520 align:start position:0%
there's a difference between the two
 
01:17:03.990 --> 01:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
years it'll take a little time to
 
01:17:06.390 --> 01:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
implement and then there'll be we have
 
01:17:09.390 --> 01:17:09.400 align:start position:0%
to phase it in based on where people are
 
01:17:10.870 --> 01:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
on their coverage and their 12- month
 
01:17:14.950 --> 01:17:14.960 align:start position:0%
continuous coverage and the eligibility
 
01:17:18.910 --> 01:17:18.920 align:start position:0%
level um that's in here is so we go up
 
01:17:21.590 --> 01:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
to 323 per of of the federal poverty
 
01:17:24.950 --> 01:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
limit that's not changed in this what is
 
01:17:27.070 --> 01:17:27.080 align:start position:0%
has changed is that whereas we have no
 
01:17:30.310 --> 01:17:30.320 align:start position:0%
premiums today only cost sharing on
 
01:17:33.149 --> 01:17:33.159 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy that um there would be premium
 
01:17:35.030 --> 01:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
starting at
 
01:17:37.830 --> 01:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
25% of the poverty limit that not being
 
01:17:41.149 --> 01:17:41.159 align:start position:0%
the child but the family income um and
 
01:17:44.590 --> 01:17:44.600 align:start position:0%
um premiums by federal law are capped at
 
01:17:47.590 --> 01:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
5% of family income
 
01:17:52.390 --> 01:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
um and so um what Our intention is also
 
01:17:53.910 --> 01:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
from the standpoint if this is the
 
01:17:56.669 --> 01:17:56.679 align:start position:0%
policy that ultimately is
 
01:18:01.030 --> 01:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
enacted is to um since the maximum
 
01:18:03.550 --> 01:18:03.560 align:start position:0%
someone could be uh we have to keep
 
01:18:06.310 --> 01:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
track of what what they've incurred in
 
01:18:09.110 --> 01:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
claims if someone's paying premiums we
 
01:18:11.229 --> 01:18:11.239 align:start position:0%
won't have other cost sharing because
 
01:18:12.709 --> 01:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
otherwise we'd have to make an an
 
01:18:15.470 --> 01:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
investment in our it structure that that
 
01:18:17.950 --> 01:18:17.960 align:start position:0%
that we can avoid by keeping it simple
 
01:18:21.110 --> 01:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
and that's that's uh what we're talking
 
01:18:23.590 --> 01:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
about here um you know in terms of other
 
01:18:27.910 --> 01:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
states that you know nearby um uh
 
01:18:30.189 --> 01:18:30.199 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and and New York are two
 
01:18:33.790 --> 01:18:33.800 align:start position:0%
states that are um have premiums but you
 
01:18:35.830 --> 01:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
go across the country there are about 18
 
01:18:38.229 --> 01:18:38.239 align:start position:0%
states currently that have uh premiums
 
01:18:39.750 --> 01:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
with children at one point it was I
 
01:18:42.510 --> 01:18:42.520 align:start position:0%
think as high as 26 New Hampshire did
 
01:18:45.910 --> 01:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
have premiums back um when children's
 
01:18:48.229 --> 01:18:48.239 align:start position:0%
health insurance was provided to the
 
01:18:49.550 --> 01:18:49.560 align:start position:0%
health through the healthy kids
 
01:18:54.390 --> 01:18:54.400 align:start position:0%
Corporation um and the at that time the
 
01:18:59.390 --> 01:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
premum started at 186% of poverty um and
 
01:19:02.990 --> 01:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
also um that there was both cost sharing
 
01:19:05.510 --> 01:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
and and premiums I think we're trying to
 
01:19:08.030 --> 01:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
keep it simpler and less costly to to
 
01:19:10.470 --> 01:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
implement if that's what ends up being
 
01:19:13.709 --> 01:19:13.719 align:start position:0%
um enacted um and let me stop there
 
01:19:14.950 --> 01:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
because I see there are people who I
 
01:19:16.590 --> 01:19:16.600 align:start position:0%
think want to representative walner
 
01:19:18.510 --> 01:19:18.520 align:start position:0%
followed by representative tarki but it
 
01:19:19.910 --> 01:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
looks like Mr White just wants to
 
01:19:21.550 --> 01:19:21.560 align:start position:0%
interject here would you yield
 
01:19:24.229 --> 01:19:24.239 align:start position:0%
representative Walder sure I I I I just
 
01:19:26.550 --> 01:19:26.560 align:start position:0%
want to add up point of clarity so in in
 
01:19:28.750 --> 01:19:28.760 align:start position:0%
the governor's recommended budget there
 
01:19:32.030 --> 01:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
was a reduction of $3.3 million in state
 
01:19:35.070 --> 01:19:35.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 26 of General funds and
 
01:19:38.189 --> 01:19:38.199 align:start position:0%
reduction of $1 million of General funds
 
01:19:39.870 --> 01:19:39.880 align:start position:0%
in state fiscal year
 
01:19:42.830 --> 01:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
2027 if if it's the committee's desire
 
01:19:45.390 --> 01:19:45.400 align:start position:0%
to keep this policy um we would
 
01:19:47.470 --> 01:19:47.480 align:start position:0%
recommend a change re it's a technical
 
01:19:50.149 --> 01:19:50.159 align:start position:0%
change request to increase the other
 
01:19:52.830 --> 01:19:52.840 align:start position:0%
Revenue by the equivalent amounts as
 
01:19:54.870 --> 01:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
well as the expenditures there was just
 
01:19:57.709 --> 01:19:57.719 align:start position:0%
a technical issue um in the reduction
 
01:19:59.790 --> 01:19:59.800 align:start position:0%
where we reduced both the general funds
 
01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
and the expenditures but we didn't
 
01:20:03.709 --> 01:20:03.719 align:start position:0%
increase increase the other Revenue to
 
01:20:06.310 --> 01:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
recognize that so um I can provide the
 
01:20:08.430 --> 01:20:08.440 align:start position:0%
change request if the committee uh
 
01:20:10.310 --> 01:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
chooses to take this direction
 
01:20:13.709 --> 01:20:13.719 align:start position:0%
representive walner thank you could you
 
01:20:16.390 --> 01:20:16.400 align:start position:0%
go into a little bit more detail about
 
01:20:19.229 --> 01:20:19.239 align:start position:0%
how this premium would be collected I I
 
01:20:20.629 --> 01:20:20.639 align:start position:0%
actually served on the board of
 
01:20:23.870 --> 01:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
directors of healthy kids I was the
 
01:20:27.310 --> 01:20:27.320 align:start position:0%
legislative um appointment to that and I
 
01:20:29.229 --> 01:20:29.239 align:start position:0%
remember the board
 
01:20:31.870 --> 01:20:31.880 align:start position:0%
struggling in the situation of the
 
01:20:33.350 --> 01:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
collection of the
 
01:20:36.830 --> 01:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
premium and families that didn't have it
 
01:20:38.950 --> 01:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
we were we tried to do fundraising to
 
01:20:41.830 --> 01:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
help subsidize families that couldn't
 
01:20:43.830 --> 01:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
couldn't come up with a premium so would
 
01:20:46.189 --> 01:20:46.199 align:start position:0%
you kind of talk through and what
 
01:20:49.110 --> 01:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
happens when a family doesn't pay the
 
01:20:52.590 --> 01:20:52.600 align:start position:0%
premium or the check bounces or you know
 
01:20:54.390 --> 01:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
and how will they be able to come back
 
01:20:57.390 --> 01:20:57.400 align:start position:0%
on on at some point what's what what's
 
01:20:58.669 --> 01:20:58.679 align:start position:0%
going to happen here so your last
 
01:21:00.189 --> 01:21:00.199 align:start position:0%
question is the easiest one to answer
 
01:21:02.470 --> 01:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
which is as I mentioned earlier that
 
01:21:04.870 --> 01:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
Medicaid's continuously open so if
 
01:21:08.149 --> 01:21:08.159 align:start position:0%
someone does close um they can apply
 
01:21:14.390 --> 01:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
again um the um in terms of the the the
 
01:21:17.229 --> 01:21:17.239 align:start position:0%
method of collecting the premiums um we
 
01:21:19.310 --> 01:21:19.320 align:start position:0%
have some thoughts about that in terms
 
01:21:22.830 --> 01:21:22.840 align:start position:0%
of how we would sort of set that up we
 
01:21:24.270 --> 01:21:24.280 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to do in approaching
 
01:21:26.110 --> 01:21:26.120 align:start position:0%
that is has come up with a simple
 
01:21:28.149 --> 01:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
solution so it's the cost of
 
01:21:30.590 --> 01:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
implementing it is doesn't consume all
 
01:21:35.189 --> 01:21:35.199 align:start position:0%
of the the the potential Revenue um you
 
01:21:37.910 --> 01:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
know there there are
 
01:21:41.750 --> 01:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
ways that I think um potentially
 
01:21:43.390 --> 01:21:43.400 align:start position:0%
exploring some systems that the state
 
01:21:45.990 --> 01:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
already has or or or vendor where you
 
01:21:48.830 --> 01:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
would work for a percentage of um what
 
01:21:51.669 --> 01:21:51.679 align:start position:0%
you collected to provide a a
 
01:21:53.430 --> 01:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
infrastructure to be able to make
 
01:21:56.590 --> 01:21:56.600 align:start position:0%
payments or a is from a checking account
 
01:21:58.550 --> 01:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
I mean the issue of people who don't pay
 
01:22:01.229 --> 01:22:01.239 align:start position:0%
is some a policy Development Area that
 
01:22:07.270 --> 01:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
we need to work on um we haven't um um
 
01:22:09.709 --> 01:22:09.719 align:start position:0%
we haven't gotten that far to be um you
 
01:22:12.110 --> 01:22:12.120 align:start position:0%
know transparent about that but we know
 
01:22:13.510 --> 01:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
that we're going to have to develop
 
01:22:15.510 --> 01:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
policies around what happens if someone
 
01:22:19.270 --> 01:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't pay and um you know what I can
 
01:22:21.510 --> 01:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
say is that you know we'll have to look
 
01:22:25.310 --> 01:22:25.320 align:start position:0%
at what is um allowable and in terms of
 
01:22:27.189 --> 01:22:27.199 align:start position:0%
the federal law on those types of things
 
01:22:30.870 --> 01:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
and um we have factored into our
 
01:22:33.550 --> 01:22:33.560 align:start position:0%
estimate of dollars that it isn't
 
01:22:37.270 --> 01:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
collectible representative walner so how
 
01:22:43.390 --> 01:22:43.400 align:start position:0%
many families fall above that what was
 
01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:44.590 align:start position:0%
many families fall above that what was
it

01:22:44.590 --> 01:22:44.600 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:22:50.950 --> 01:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:52.990 --> 01:22:53.000 align:start position:0%
correct uh which is about
 
01:22:58.229 --> 01:22:58.239 align:start position:0%
8600 um8 600 8600 children families it
 
01:23:00.950 --> 01:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
might be more children yeah it's we're
 
01:23:03.950 --> 01:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
figuring about 10% of the the the the
 
01:23:05.750 --> 01:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
children that are in the program that
 
01:23:08.430 --> 01:23:08.440 align:start position:0%
would apply to okay you know this is
 
01:23:11.750 --> 01:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
just a question I have about all of this
 
01:23:15.390 --> 01:23:15.400 align:start position:0%
when a um 86,000 children someone can't
 
01:23:18.550 --> 01:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
pay the premium or they let it lapse or
 
01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:19.550 align:start position:0%
pay the premium or they let it lapse or
whatever

01:23:19.550 --> 01:23:19.560 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
01:23:23.229 --> 01:23:23.239 align:start position:0%
happens and they are in the midst of
 
01:23:24.990 --> 01:23:25.000 align:start position:0%
some medical
 
01:23:28.790 --> 01:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
really serious medical issue cancer or
 
01:23:31.870 --> 01:23:31.880 align:start position:0%
some other you know kind of thing what
 
01:23:34.070 --> 01:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
happens at that point they just are they
 
01:23:37.390 --> 01:23:37.400 align:start position:0%
lose it and then they have to go so I
 
01:23:39.470 --> 01:23:39.480 align:start position:0%
think we have some policy design choices
 
01:23:42.590 --> 01:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
about that um we encounter that today
 
01:23:44.270 --> 01:23:44.280 align:start position:0%
sometimes where someone may be so
 
01:23:45.629 --> 01:23:45.639 align:start position:0%
destitute that they can't get their
 
01:23:48.149 --> 01:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
medication um and so we do have some
 
01:23:50.229 --> 01:23:50.239 align:start position:0%
policies and that's what I was saying I
 
01:23:52.790 --> 01:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
think um you know this is fairly new to
 
01:23:54.669 --> 01:23:54.679 align:start position:0%
us as well in the department in terms of
 
01:23:57.629 --> 01:23:57.639 align:start position:0%
you know developing um the strategy but
 
01:23:59.229 --> 01:23:59.239 align:start position:0%
you know I think we'll be transparent
 
01:24:01.870 --> 01:24:01.880 align:start position:0%
about what it's going to look like um
 
01:24:04.750 --> 01:24:04.760 align:start position:0%
and um you know I I do think we have to
 
01:24:06.790 --> 01:24:06.800 align:start position:0%
take into consideration people under
 
01:24:08.910 --> 01:24:08.920 align:start position:0%
active treatment and you can't just drop
 
01:24:12.070 --> 01:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
them um so I think that's part of the
 
01:24:13.590 --> 01:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
when we were doing our estimation we
 
01:24:16.030 --> 01:24:16.040 align:start position:0%
didn't assume that 100% of the the
 
01:24:17.910 --> 01:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
premium potentially could be collected
 
01:24:21.910 --> 01:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
so um I'd rather not you know speculate
 
01:24:23.110 --> 01:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
on what that's going to be until we
 
01:24:25.430 --> 01:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
develop the policies
 
01:24:27.350 --> 01:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
and just one one last
 
01:24:32.110 --> 01:24:32.120 align:start position:0%
question 5% of a of a family income at
 
01:24:35.669 --> 01:24:35.679 align:start position:0%
that at the level of 255 per of poverty
 
01:24:39.590 --> 01:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
is really substantial I tried last night
 
01:24:42.590 --> 01:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
to do some math and I mean it you know
 
01:24:43.709 --> 01:24:43.719 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
01:24:47.390 --> 01:24:47.400 align:start position:0%
family's car payment it's their you know
 
01:24:50.430 --> 01:24:50.440 align:start position:0%
a portion of their rent it's their child
 
01:24:53.310 --> 01:24:53.320 align:start position:0%
care expense
 
01:24:56.709 --> 01:24:56.719 align:start position:0%
um do you see any other any other
 
01:24:58.669 --> 01:24:58.679 align:start position:0%
mechanisms for helping these families
 
01:25:01.070 --> 01:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
pay these these premiums I think that
 
01:25:02.550 --> 01:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
you're going to we're going to see a
 
01:25:03.910 --> 01:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
number of families that are just not
 
01:25:06.470 --> 01:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
going to be able to do it again I think
 
01:25:08.629 --> 01:25:08.639 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of issues to work
 
01:25:11.790 --> 01:25:11.800 align:start position:0%
through to implement this and you're
 
01:25:14.149 --> 01:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
identifying a number of them today I
 
01:25:16.109 --> 01:25:16.119 align:start position:0%
don't have all the answers today to be
 
01:25:17.950 --> 01:25:17.960 align:start position:0%
you know totally
 
01:25:20.550 --> 01:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
transparent thank you representative
 
01:25:22.070 --> 01:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
tarki followed by representative
 
01:25:23.709 --> 01:25:23.719 align:start position:0%
Stringham followed by representative
 
01:25:26.070 --> 01:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
nven go thank you thank you very much
 
01:25:28.189 --> 01:25:28.199 align:start position:0%
for taking my question well to follow up
 
01:25:29.550 --> 01:25:29.560 align:start position:0%
on what representative walner was
 
01:25:31.350 --> 01:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
getting at I did dig into some math a
 
01:25:34.109 --> 01:25:34.119 align:start position:0%
little bit on this and I used a
 
01:25:37.070 --> 01:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
hypothetical single mom with two kids
 
01:25:39.270 --> 01:25:39.280 align:start position:0%
who is at
 
01:25:42.590 --> 01:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
25% of the poverty level which means she
 
01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:47.830 align:start position:0%
25% of the poverty level which means she
makes

01:25:47.830 --> 01:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:54.590 --> 01:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:57.590 --> 01:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
cents a year and
 
01:26:02.430 --> 01:26:02.440 align:start position:0%
$283 15 a month so just although we
 
01:26:03.830 --> 01:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
don't have answers on how it's going to
 
01:26:05.950 --> 01:26:05.960 align:start position:0%
work let's assume that she has to pay a
 
01:26:07.189 --> 01:26:07.199 align:start position:0%
premium of
 
01:26:12.470 --> 01:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
$283 15 a month am I correct so
 
01:26:15.109 --> 01:26:15.119 align:start position:0%
far I know you can't answer I'm going to
 
01:26:16.830 --> 01:26:16.840 align:start position:0%
assume that that's accurate up to this
 
01:26:19.510 --> 01:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
point um
 
01:26:22.790 --> 01:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
so is it true though as representative
 
01:26:26.030 --> 01:26:26.040 align:start position:0%
walner stated that that's for many
 
01:26:29.030 --> 01:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
families a car payment um which would
 
01:26:30.510 --> 01:26:30.520 align:start position:0%
get her to work to be able to pay for
 
01:26:33.790 --> 01:26:33.800 align:start position:0%
this in the first place um that if she
 
01:26:37.390 --> 01:26:37.400 align:start position:0%
had to if she got dropped for whatever
 
01:26:41.310 --> 01:26:41.320 align:start position:0%
reason due to something uh catastrophic
 
01:26:43.870 --> 01:26:43.880 align:start position:0%
injury whatever she just didn't have the
 
01:26:48.830 --> 01:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
that money to pay her $283 a month um
 
01:26:53.229 --> 01:26:53.239 align:start position:0%
isn't it true that with an increase of
 
01:26:56.070 --> 01:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
care compensated care because she let's
 
01:26:57.430 --> 01:26:57.440 align:start position:0%
say is going to still need that
 
01:26:59.510 --> 01:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
emergency care treatment she has to
 
01:27:02.229 --> 01:27:02.239 align:start position:0%
bring her child who broke his arm to the
 
01:27:05.590 --> 01:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
ER and that child is no longer covered
 
01:27:08.990 --> 01:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
that in the end that raises the cost for
 
01:27:10.270 --> 01:27:10.280 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:27:13.669 --> 01:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
significantly and that this $1 million a
 
01:27:16.229 --> 01:27:16.239 align:start position:0%
year that we are quote saving is
 
01:27:19.149 --> 01:27:19.159 align:start position:0%
actually going to be significantly
 
01:27:22.629 --> 01:27:22.639 align:start position:0%
more I guess in terms of the the
 
01:27:23.830 --> 01:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
scenario that you talked about there was
 
01:27:27.109 --> 01:27:27.119 align:start position:0%
a of it I just want to clarify um I
 
01:27:28.430 --> 01:27:28.440 align:start position:0%
thought I heard and I may not have heard
 
01:27:31.270 --> 01:27:31.280 align:start position:0%
correctly that um where her income
 
01:27:34.270 --> 01:27:34.280 align:start position:0%
changed at some point were you making
 
01:27:37.189 --> 01:27:37.199 align:start position:0%
that no I I misheard then no she
 
01:27:39.910 --> 01:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
couldn't afford to pay the cost share of
 
01:27:43.030 --> 01:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
whatever the 5% if it's weekly monthly
 
01:27:44.510 --> 01:27:44.520 align:start position:0%
and so she got dropped which we don't
 
01:27:45.990 --> 01:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
know what that actually means what it
 
01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:46.910 align:start position:0%
know what that actually means what it
looks

01:27:46.910 --> 01:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
looks
 
01:27:49.990 --> 01:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
like so I think you know the number I
 
01:27:52.510 --> 01:27:52.520 align:start position:0%
had in my head in terms of was at at a
 
01:27:56.590 --> 01:27:56.600 align:start position:0%
single at one person which is you know
 
01:27:59.830 --> 01:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
your 283 calculation I can run the
 
01:28:01.189 --> 01:28:01.199 align:start position:0%
number for you well we're talking about
 
01:28:03.430 --> 01:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
chips so I did a mom with kids yeah yeah
 
01:28:04.990 --> 01:28:05.000 align:start position:0%
no I know I'm just saying in my head the
 
01:28:06.910 --> 01:28:06.920 align:start position:0%
number I had I'm just having some for
 
01:28:10.189 --> 01:28:10.199 align:start position:0%
the scenario you gave um you know I I do
 
01:28:12.510 --> 01:28:12.520 align:start position:0%
think that
 
01:28:15.350 --> 01:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
um you know in many I would say this
 
01:28:17.149 --> 01:28:17.159 align:start position:0%
about the state budget in many instances
 
01:28:21.350 --> 01:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
there are times when the state um may or
 
01:28:22.950 --> 01:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
may not cover something and that it's
 
01:28:24.830 --> 01:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
picked up in either e by the federal
 
01:28:26.629 --> 01:28:26.639 align:start position:0%
government or by the local government or
 
01:28:29.390 --> 01:28:29.400 align:start position:0%
by the individual and I think what what
 
01:28:32.950 --> 01:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
this policy does is is asking
 
01:28:34.910 --> 01:28:34.920 align:start position:0%
individuals of a certain income to to
 
01:28:39.070 --> 01:28:39.080 align:start position:0%
share in the cost of of it and um I
 
01:28:41.590 --> 01:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
think you know in terms of our estimate
 
01:28:43.910 --> 01:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
that's that's within the governor's
 
01:28:46.790 --> 01:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
budget it does not assume that 100% of
 
01:28:50.270 --> 01:28:50.280 align:start position:0%
that is going to be to be paid there are
 
01:28:52.830 --> 01:28:52.840 align:start position:0%
going to be circumstances like you arise
 
01:28:54.270 --> 01:28:54.280 align:start position:0%
there where we're going to have to to
 
01:28:56.910 --> 01:28:56.920 align:start position:0%
develop policies to to accommodate
 
01:29:00.149 --> 01:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
certain situations but some cost will be
 
01:29:01.709 --> 01:29:01.719 align:start position:0%
passed on to other areas I think that's
 
01:29:04.310 --> 01:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
a fair fair statement to make
 
01:29:07.990 --> 01:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
potentially um how much of that I can't
 
01:29:10.149 --> 01:29:10.159 align:start position:0%
can't represent today until we have some
 
01:29:13.030 --> 01:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
experience thank you representative
 
01:29:14.990 --> 01:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
Stringham followed by representative
 
01:29:17.109 --> 01:29:17.119 align:start position:0%
Neno well I guess we all use different
 
01:29:19.270 --> 01:29:19.280 align:start position:0%
numbers because I had a family of four
 
01:29:22.629 --> 01:29:22.639 align:start position:0%
but came out to 350 a month um but uh
 
01:29:24.750 --> 01:29:24.760 align:start position:0%
the question I just had I guess there
 
01:29:27.470 --> 01:29:27.480 align:start position:0%
are mechanisms for for handling uh
 
01:29:30.189 --> 01:29:30.199 align:start position:0%
patients without health insurance uh we
 
01:29:33.470 --> 01:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
have facilities that are required uh as
 
01:29:37.149 --> 01:29:37.159 align:start position:0%
part of their Charter hospitals and uh U
 
01:29:40.750 --> 01:29:40.760 align:start position:0%
federally qualified um uh centers uh
 
01:29:43.030 --> 01:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
that they they take patients in need
 
01:29:45.590 --> 01:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
regardless of their financial ability
 
01:29:50.030 --> 01:29:50.040 align:start position:0%
and somehow they have to get um uh money
 
01:29:52.910 --> 01:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
that they never are able to collect uh
 
01:29:54.470 --> 01:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
somehow they get paid in and I think
 
01:29:57.109 --> 01:29:57.119 align:start position:0%
part of that is through uh uncomp
 
01:30:00.109 --> 01:30:00.119 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care fund so I I would
 
01:30:03.669 --> 01:30:03.679 align:start position:0%
just ask you know um so um you know I
 
01:30:05.709 --> 01:30:05.719 align:start position:0%
think the savings that that we would
 
01:30:07.390 --> 01:30:07.400 align:start position:0%
have from collecting is going to be
 
01:30:10.270 --> 01:30:10.280 align:start position:0%
partially offset by those that don't get
 
01:30:13.390 --> 01:30:13.400 align:start position:0%
into the program and then uh become
 
01:30:16.390 --> 01:30:16.400 align:start position:0%
consumers in the uncompensated care fund
 
01:30:19.189 --> 01:30:19.199 align:start position:0%
so uh I know you you you said you're not
 
01:30:22.189 --> 01:30:22.199 align:start position:0%
an e economic modeling modeler but I I
 
01:30:25.550 --> 01:30:25.560 align:start position:0%
just wonder to what degree um um you
 
01:30:28.350 --> 01:30:28.360 align:start position:0%
know those you know secondary effects of
 
01:30:31.590 --> 01:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
this policy change have have been um
 
01:30:33.709 --> 01:30:33.719 align:start position:0%
thought through and and reduced in
 
01:30:36.550 --> 01:30:36.560 align:start position:0%
numbers and if not today they happy to
 
01:30:38.629 --> 01:30:38.639 align:start position:0%
if if if you have anything you can share
 
01:30:41.270 --> 01:30:41.280 align:start position:0%
it uh after this hearing well I think
 
01:30:43.669 --> 01:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
certainly we can talk to additional
 
01:30:45.550 --> 01:30:45.560 align:start position:0%
States about what their experience has
 
01:30:48.430 --> 01:30:48.440 align:start position:0%
been um I can say that they many states
 
01:30:50.470 --> 01:30:50.480 align:start position:0%
that have continued to have you know
 
01:30:54.270 --> 01:30:54.280 align:start position:0%
this Premium cost sharing um you know I
 
01:30:57.030 --> 01:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
think that you know other structures for
 
01:30:58.950 --> 01:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
for dealing with reducing the budget for
 
01:31:01.109 --> 01:31:01.119 align:start position:0%
example you could put it all in co-pays
 
01:31:02.910 --> 01:31:02.920 align:start position:0%
but then you have a problem with
 
01:31:05.030 --> 01:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
collections at the provider level which
 
01:31:08.550 --> 01:31:08.560 align:start position:0%
could create U access barriers so I
 
01:31:12.350 --> 01:31:12.360 align:start position:0%
think um you know to the extent that um
 
01:31:14.590 --> 01:31:14.600 align:start position:0%
the budget requires us to have
 
01:31:17.709 --> 01:31:17.719 align:start position:0%
participation of of individuals that
 
01:31:20.550 --> 01:31:20.560 align:start position:0%
there is some aspects of this that that
 
01:31:23.030 --> 01:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
are going to play out in certain ways
 
01:31:25.590 --> 01:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
and I guess you know we'll we'll U we'll
 
01:31:28.750 --> 01:31:28.760 align:start position:0%
do some more work on that thank
 
01:31:31.950 --> 01:31:31.960 align:start position:0%
you yeah I'm going to jump jump from the
 
01:31:35.550 --> 01:31:35.560 align:start position:0%
micro back to you know the macro
 
01:31:37.990 --> 01:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
so and correct me if I'm wrong on this
 
01:31:40.109 --> 01:31:40.119 align:start position:0%
but the demographics in New Hampshire
 
01:31:43.709 --> 01:31:43.719 align:start position:0%
we've seen it's an aging population and
 
01:31:46.149 --> 01:31:46.159 align:start position:0%
if I'm correct I think the birth rate is
 
01:31:48.310 --> 01:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
is dropping at least nationally is that
 
01:31:51.229 --> 01:31:51.239 align:start position:0%
the same for New Hampshire and then the
 
01:31:55.030 --> 01:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
question is how how that figures into
 
01:31:57.109 --> 01:31:57.119 align:start position:0%
the the budgeting process from the
 
01:31:59.149 --> 01:31:59.159 align:start position:0%
standpoint of not only the birth rate
 
01:32:00.990 --> 01:32:01.000 align:start position:0%
changing but probably
 
01:32:03.229 --> 01:32:03.239 align:start position:0%
demographically on where the births are
 
01:32:07.669 --> 01:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
falling in you know relative to the uh
 
01:32:10.590 --> 01:32:10.600 align:start position:0%
cutof rates on on
 
01:32:14.950 --> 01:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
income so so do we see you know we're
 
01:32:17.470 --> 01:32:17.480 align:start position:0%
certainly seeing a shifting to the
 
01:32:20.750 --> 01:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
elderly uh end of uh Medicaid and
 
01:32:23.310 --> 01:32:23.320 align:start position:0%
Medicare so are we seeing some kind of a
 
01:32:26.910 --> 01:32:26.920 align:start position:0%
shift in the other direction on the uh
 
01:32:29.950 --> 01:32:29.960 align:start position:0%
youth side of this so in terms of birth
 
01:32:32.910 --> 01:32:32.920 align:start position:0%
rate um the last report I saw on that
 
01:32:35.550 --> 01:32:35.560 align:start position:0%
was New Hampshire actually had
 
01:32:37.189 --> 01:32:37.199 align:start position:0%
stabilized and was one of the few states
 
01:32:38.950 --> 01:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
that hadn't declined now there may be
 
01:32:40.750 --> 01:32:40.760 align:start position:0%
another year of data that I have not
 
01:32:43.390 --> 01:32:43.400 align:start position:0%
observed yet but that was coming um out
 
01:32:46.550 --> 01:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
of the pandemic that um but you know our
 
01:32:48.590 --> 01:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
our births are been pretty consistent
 
01:32:52.149 --> 01:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
around 11 to 12,000 a year for quite a
 
01:32:54.470 --> 01:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
bit of time but you know
 
01:32:57.270 --> 01:32:57.280 align:start position:0%
when we look at some other information
 
01:33:00.510 --> 01:33:00.520 align:start position:0%
this in this uh slide deck compared to
 
01:33:02.590 --> 01:33:02.600 align:start position:0%
other states even our neighbors like
 
01:33:04.950 --> 01:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
Vermont and Maine New
 
01:33:07.390 --> 01:33:07.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire generally has a higher
 
01:33:10.310 --> 01:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
economic status that gets reflected in
 
01:33:11.950 --> 01:33:11.960 align:start position:0%
the federal share that those states are
 
01:33:15.669 --> 01:33:15.679 align:start position:0%
paid New Hampshire um standard Medicaid
 
01:33:17.070 --> 01:33:17.080 align:start position:0%
is reimbursed at
 
01:33:21.149 --> 01:33:21.159 align:start position:0%
50% other states are um like um M uh
 
01:33:24.310 --> 01:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
Maine and and Vermont are above that
 
01:33:27.109 --> 01:33:27.119 align:start position:0%
number um and I have a chart later on
 
01:33:29.990 --> 01:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
here that gives you an actual comparison
 
01:33:35.030 --> 01:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
look up the page number for um that uh
 
01:33:37.950 --> 01:33:37.960 align:start position:0%
we actually can demonstrate to you that
 
01:33:39.910 --> 01:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
I think that you know New
 
01:33:42.229 --> 01:33:42.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has been able to support the
 
01:33:45.030 --> 01:33:45.040 align:start position:0%
fifth highest eligibility level at 323
 
01:33:47.270 --> 01:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
per. the national average is
 
01:33:51.030 --> 01:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
255 um and so you know we probably do
 
01:33:55.030 --> 01:33:55.040 align:start position:0%
have more families that are um um I'll
 
01:34:01.189 --> 01:34:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:03.750 --> 01:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh representative n vano if you could
 
01:34:06.229 --> 01:34:06.239 align:start position:0%
just uh maybe move your microphone
 
01:34:08.109 --> 01:34:08.119 align:start position:0%
closer to you I just want to be sure
 
01:34:10.149 --> 01:34:10.159 align:start position:0%
that YouTube and everybody watching and
 
01:34:12.870 --> 01:34:12.880 align:start position:0%
all this and sees this in the future
 
01:34:16.229 --> 01:34:16.239 align:start position:0%
picks up what you say thank you
 
01:34:20.270 --> 01:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
um David help me find a page
 
01:34:22.910 --> 01:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
U uh actually that's not the one I was
 
01:34:24.669 --> 01:34:24.679 align:start position:0%
looking for I was looking for to the map
 
01:34:26.430 --> 01:34:26.440 align:start position:0%
that compares the different states in
 
01:34:28.870 --> 01:34:28.880 align:start position:0%
the region yeah
 
01:34:34.109 --> 01:34:34.119 align:start position:0%
yes yeah page page 50 uh of the slide
 
01:34:37.830 --> 01:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
deck you can see um there's a map on the
 
01:34:40.629 --> 01:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
Le hand side and then a comparison of
 
01:34:42.510 --> 01:34:42.520 align:start position:0%
different States Federal matching
 
01:34:45.550 --> 01:34:45.560 align:start position:0%
percentages you can see Maine um was
 
01:34:49.750 --> 01:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
over 60% and Veron is just under 60%
 
01:34:52.550 --> 01:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
which is you know when you count that
 
01:34:55.510 --> 01:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
times billions is a lot of money
 
01:34:58.470 --> 01:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
um we're we're in the same company as
 
01:35:00.669 --> 01:35:00.679 align:start position:0%
Connecticut and and Massachusetts in
 
01:35:02.830 --> 01:35:02.840 align:start position:0%
terms of our federal match even Rhode
 
01:35:05.550 --> 01:35:05.560 align:start position:0%
Island we're we're more well off than
 
01:35:08.149 --> 01:35:08.159 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island um with respect to how the
 
01:35:09.830 --> 01:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
federal match
 
01:35:09.840 --> 01:35:12.830 align:start position:0%
federal match
Works

01:35:12.830 --> 01:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
Works
 
01:35:17.350 --> 01:35:17.360 align:start position:0%
um so just just a quick call follow so
 
01:35:19.910 --> 01:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
the the poverty rate here is
 
01:35:22.030 --> 01:35:22.040 align:start position:0%
comparatively better than than some of
 
01:35:25.109 --> 01:35:25.119 align:start position:0%
the surrounding surrounding States but
 
01:35:27.109 --> 01:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
when you factor into you know I'm
 
01:35:29.310 --> 01:35:29.320 align:start position:0%
looking thinking about the demographics
 
01:35:31.990 --> 01:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
of where the child births are coming
 
01:35:35.910 --> 01:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
relative to the um income levels you
 
01:35:38.109 --> 01:35:38.119 align:start position:0%
know again trying to get at what the
 
01:35:41.709 --> 01:35:41.719 align:start position:0%
what the macro Trends look like in terms
 
01:35:44.270 --> 01:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
of this overall program looks you know
 
01:35:47.470 --> 01:35:47.480 align:start position:0%
is it having a a downward slope on it
 
01:35:50.030 --> 01:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
compared to when we look at Medicare and
 
01:35:51.790 --> 01:35:51.800 align:start position:0%
Medicaid on the elderly side of it we
 
01:35:53.950 --> 01:35:53.960 align:start position:0%
might be seeing an upward slope so so I
 
01:35:58.270 --> 01:35:58.280 align:start position:0%
think um in terms of macro Trend I think
 
01:36:00.669 --> 01:36:00.679 align:start position:0%
the the wealth the economic wealth of
 
01:36:02.910 --> 01:36:02.920 align:start position:0%
the state on a per capita basis has
 
01:36:06.189 --> 01:36:06.199 align:start position:0%
improved and we are seeing fewer kids as
 
01:36:09.149 --> 01:36:09.159 align:start position:0%
a percentage of the entire program just
 
01:36:12.270 --> 01:36:12.280 align:start position:0%
as you see fewer kids in school there
 
01:36:13.870 --> 01:36:13.880 align:start position:0%
there's there's a bit of a trend there
 
01:36:17.270 --> 01:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
but not not that discernable if you will
 
01:36:19.750 --> 01:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
um it definitely is not upward in terms
 
01:36:22.229 --> 01:36:22.239 align:start position:0%
of the number of children in the
 
01:36:24.629 --> 01:36:24.639 align:start position:0%
program thank you
 
01:36:27.669 --> 01:36:27.679 align:start position:0%
representative priest for question yes
 
01:36:31.229 --> 01:36:31.239 align:start position:0%
um by chance do you have any information
 
01:36:35.189 --> 01:36:35.199 align:start position:0%
any data of showing the children who are
 
01:36:38.990 --> 01:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
in the program versus those that would
 
01:36:42.310 --> 01:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
qualified but for some reason are not in
 
01:36:42.320 --> 01:36:44.950 align:start position:0%
qualified but for some reason are not in
the

01:36:44.950 --> 01:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:48.510 --> 01:36:48.520 align:start position:0%
program I I don't but I'm suspecting
 
01:36:50.109 --> 01:36:50.119 align:start position:0%
there may be some information out there
 
01:36:51.590 --> 01:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
that we could research that could help
 
01:36:54.189 --> 01:36:54.199 align:start position:0%
address that um I would really like that
 
01:36:59.390 --> 01:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:01.870 --> 01:37:01.880 align:start position:0%
that are folks okay if we move to the
 
01:37:04.590 --> 01:37:04.600 align:start position:0%
next yes we're now going to page we're
 
01:37:11.390 --> 01:37:11.400 align:start position:0%
going to page 16 of the deck and um 888
 
01:37:11.400 --> 01:37:13.390 align:start position:0%
going to page 16 of the deck and um 888
of

01:37:13.390 --> 01:37:13.400 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:37:16.669 --> 01:37:16.679 align:start position:0%
the the governor's operating
 
01:37:20.030 --> 01:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
budget and um in Medicaid schools we
 
01:37:22.270 --> 01:37:22.280 align:start position:0%
talked earlier about the grant here
 
01:37:24.470 --> 01:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
we're talking about um the actual
 
01:37:27.950 --> 01:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
program that exists and
 
01:37:32.430 --> 01:37:32.440 align:start position:0%
um as I mentioned before um I think this
 
01:37:36.109 --> 01:37:36.119 align:start position:0%
is a an area where um we have seen a
 
01:37:38.870 --> 01:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
shrinkage in the program um utilization
 
01:37:41.390 --> 01:37:41.400 align:start position:0%
I think for a couple of reasons I think
 
01:37:44.629 --> 01:37:44.639 align:start position:0%
the pandemic had a great effect on on
 
01:37:47.830 --> 01:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
schools uh but also you know to be
 
01:37:49.510 --> 01:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
compliantly participating in the
 
01:37:53.550 --> 01:37:53.560 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program that in 201819
 
01:37:55.310 --> 01:37:55.320 align:start position:0%
time frame
 
01:37:58.070 --> 01:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
um the if you will the rules that
 
01:38:00.109 --> 01:38:00.119 align:start position:0%
schools need to follow got a little bit
 
01:38:03.550 --> 01:38:03.560 align:start position:0%
more um complex for them to follow um
 
01:38:06.990 --> 01:38:07.000 align:start position:0%
and um I think some schools may not be
 
01:38:09.830 --> 01:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
um have the technical expertise to to
 
01:38:11.870 --> 01:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
master the program and so I think the
 
01:38:14.750 --> 01:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
grant could be helpful to to turning
 
01:38:17.229 --> 01:38:17.239 align:start position:0%
that tide sum and
 
01:38:21.390 --> 01:38:21.400 align:start position:0%
um um you know I think here we're we
 
01:38:24.990 --> 01:38:25.000 align:start position:0%
have uh budgeted for an increase I think
 
01:38:27.910 --> 01:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
that hb2 language in Prior sessions has
 
01:38:31.229 --> 01:38:31.239 align:start position:0%
allowed the the department to come back
 
01:38:34.270 --> 01:38:34.280 align:start position:0%
to request additional funds if need be
 
01:38:38.189 --> 01:38:38.199 align:start position:0%
they're 100% federal funds um I
 
01:38:40.109 --> 01:38:40.119 align:start position:0%
understood um the other day you
 
01:38:43.109 --> 01:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
discussed this point um about you know
 
01:38:45.430 --> 01:38:45.440 align:start position:0%
wanting to monitor what is happening in
 
01:38:48.790 --> 01:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
this program we we'd recommend I think
 
01:38:51.910 --> 01:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
reporting over um other means to sort of
 
01:38:53.750 --> 01:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
track what's going on we we you know we
 
01:38:55.550 --> 01:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
report once a year we certainly could
 
01:38:58.189 --> 01:38:58.199 align:start position:0%
report you know quarterly if that was a
 
01:39:00.830 --> 01:39:00.840 align:start position:0%
preference as opposed to having to enact
 
01:39:03.070 --> 01:39:03.080 align:start position:0%
legislation but you know we'll work with
 
01:39:09.270 --> 01:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:13.070 --> 01:39:13.080 align:start position:0%
with um any questions on this
 
01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:14.390 align:start position:0%
with um any questions on this
Representative

01:39:14.390 --> 01:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
Representative
 
01:39:18.030 --> 01:39:18.040 align:start position:0%
walner no I should know this how does
 
01:39:21.030 --> 01:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
how does the school districts
 
01:39:24.589 --> 01:39:24.599 align:start position:0%
um the school is are is paying a portion
 
01:39:27.510 --> 01:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
of these services and then a portion
 
01:39:29.709 --> 01:39:29.719 align:start position:0%
comes through Medicaid schools how do
 
01:39:33.109 --> 01:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
you account for that so so um it's
 
01:39:36.830 --> 01:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
actually quite simple today um good they
 
01:39:38.589 --> 01:39:38.599 align:start position:0%
they provide a service like a physical
 
01:39:41.790 --> 01:39:41.800 align:start position:0%
therapy treatment they they bill us like
 
01:39:44.629 --> 01:39:44.639 align:start position:0%
any other provider would bill us often
 
01:39:46.830 --> 01:39:46.840 align:start position:0%
schools are using a billing company to
 
01:39:49.629 --> 01:39:49.639 align:start position:0%
support them but they send in a claim we
 
01:39:52.629 --> 01:39:52.639 align:start position:0%
pay half the claim and the other half is
 
01:39:55.589 --> 01:39:55.599 align:start position:0%
assumed to be their contribution okay um
 
01:39:57.350 --> 01:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
for the federal match and that's what I
 
01:39:59.310 --> 01:39:59.320 align:start position:0%
was getting at earlier is I think our
 
01:40:01.430 --> 01:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
rate our rates may not really
 
01:40:04.350 --> 01:40:04.360 align:start position:0%
approximate half their costs and so I
 
01:40:05.950 --> 01:40:05.960 align:start position:0%
think other states that have converted
 
01:40:08.270 --> 01:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
to the methodology that will be required
 
01:40:10.870 --> 01:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
for us to be have seen a benefit to
 
01:40:12.229 --> 01:40:12.239 align:start position:0%
their schools in terms of what they're
 
01:40:15.470 --> 01:40:15.480 align:start position:0%
able to get in Medicaid funding okay
 
01:40:20.950 --> 01:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:23.109 --> 01:40:23.119 align:start position:0%
you would it be okay if I mve to the
 
01:40:23.119 --> 01:40:25.910 align:start position:0%
you would it be okay if I mve to the
next

01:40:25.910 --> 01:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:28.470 --> 01:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
so we're going to Medicaid
 
01:40:30.550 --> 01:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
Administration which is
 
01:40:35.589 --> 01:40:35.599 align:start position:0%
7937 and on 889 and this one is one
 
01:40:38.790 --> 01:40:38.800 align:start position:0%
where I'd really like to to uh give some
 
01:40:41.589 --> 01:40:41.599 align:start position:0%
Concepts here um the largest line item
 
01:40:45.669 --> 01:40:45.679 align:start position:0%
which is on um 049 transfer to other
 
01:40:48.589 --> 01:40:48.599 align:start position:0%
state agencies this is really not an
 
01:40:50.589 --> 01:40:50.599 align:start position:0%
administrative expense of of the
 
01:40:54.950 --> 01:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
Medicaid um division it represents the
 
01:40:58.030 --> 01:40:58.040 align:start position:0%
the federal claiming to pay um New
 
01:41:00.790 --> 01:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital and historically um
 
01:41:04.709 --> 01:41:04.719 align:start position:0%
Glen cliff and also Hamstead before it
 
01:41:07.030 --> 01:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
changes and the reason you see the
 
01:41:10.430 --> 01:41:10.440 align:start position:0%
reduction between um the current years
 
01:41:14.430 --> 01:41:14.440 align:start position:0%
and going into 26 and 27 is Hamstead
 
01:41:16.709 --> 01:41:16.719 align:start position:0%
will no longer be eligible for this type
 
01:41:19.589 --> 01:41:19.599 align:start position:0%
of funding but basically we're drawing a
 
01:41:23.510 --> 01:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
federal match for the uncompensated care
 
01:41:25.990 --> 01:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
disproportionate share funding and we
 
01:41:28.510 --> 01:41:28.520 align:start position:0%
transfer once we make the claim it goes
 
01:41:31.550 --> 01:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
so it's really if you will not we're not
 
01:41:32.910 --> 01:41:32.920 align:start position:0%
incurring an
 
01:41:36.070 --> 01:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
expense here um the other thing I'd like
 
01:41:38.589 --> 01:41:38.599 align:start position:0%
to say about this unit um and we'll have
 
01:41:39.990 --> 01:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
a little bit more detail on this later
 
01:41:42.350 --> 01:41:42.360 align:start position:0%
on is in terms of our contract lines
 
01:41:44.750 --> 01:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
we've made a 25%
 
01:41:48.990 --> 01:41:49.000 align:start position:0%
reduction um in our contract expenses uh
 
01:41:52.390 --> 01:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
for uh this upcoming bium in in the
 
01:41:54.149 --> 01:41:54.159 align:start position:0%
governor's budget
 
01:41:57.030 --> 01:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
and I'll also point out there are a
 
01:41:59.070 --> 01:41:59.080 align:start position:0%
couple of really important contracts
 
01:42:02.950 --> 01:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
that have rois of 15 times their cost
 
01:42:05.229 --> 01:42:05.239 align:start position:0%
and one of them one of the expenses in
 
01:42:07.589 --> 01:42:07.599 align:start position:0%
this line is our how we generate our
 
01:42:09.750 --> 01:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy rebate it's our vendor that we
 
01:42:12.390 --> 01:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
pay to generate Pharmacy rebate we pay a
 
01:42:13.589 --> 01:42:13.599 align:start position:0%
little under
 
01:42:15.830 --> 01:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
$200,000 and we're going to bring in you
 
01:42:18.669 --> 01:42:18.679 align:start position:0%
know 30 million roughly and rebates or
 
01:42:20.790 --> 01:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
maybe more
 
01:42:25.709 --> 01:42:25.719 align:start position:0%
um we have um a contractor who um checks
 
01:42:29.629 --> 01:42:29.639 align:start position:0%
the um the spending of the mco's uh
 
01:42:34.430 --> 01:42:34.440 align:start position:0%
medical loss ratio and we we um there we
 
01:42:37.510 --> 01:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
have a vendor that's I gave that I gave
 
01:42:39.830 --> 01:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
the example of was um we spend a little
 
01:42:42.270 --> 01:42:42.280 align:start position:0%
under $200,000 a year on that vendor and
 
01:42:45.229 --> 01:42:45.239 align:start position:0%
bring in um you know like $3 million in
 
01:42:48.669 --> 01:42:48.679 align:start position:0%
the the current year I meant previously
 
01:42:50.750 --> 01:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
to say in the pharmacy side we spend a
 
01:42:52.390 --> 01:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
little under two million and get 30
 
01:42:54.589 --> 01:42:54.599 align:start position:0%
million sorry I complained those two for
 
01:42:56.990 --> 01:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
a moment um but generally what we're
 
01:42:59.669 --> 01:42:59.679 align:start position:0%
seeing here is that the contracts that
 
01:43:01.950 --> 01:43:01.960 align:start position:0%
we're entering into are ones that are
 
01:43:04.430 --> 01:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
generating value to the state the other
 
01:43:08.030 --> 01:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
big item in this area is our actuary um
 
01:43:12.149 --> 01:43:12.159 align:start position:0%
to help us develop our rates and on both
 
01:43:15.270 --> 01:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
the the medical side and the dental side
 
01:43:17.030 --> 01:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
you know it's the largest contracts that
 
01:43:19.669 --> 01:43:19.679 align:start position:0%
the state enters into um you know a
 
01:43:22.510 --> 01:43:22.520 align:start position:0%
point or two of accuracy is real money
 
01:43:23.629 --> 01:43:23.639 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:43:25.950 --> 01:43:25.960 align:start position:0%
um that one I think the return on
 
01:43:28.030 --> 01:43:28.040 align:start position:0%
investment there is not as easy to
 
01:43:29.990 --> 01:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
calculate but I think you know we've
 
01:43:32.149 --> 01:43:32.159 align:start position:0%
been pretty consistent of being able to
 
01:43:34.709 --> 01:43:34.719 align:start position:0%
work within the means of of the Medicaid
 
01:43:37.270 --> 01:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
Program in this area and you know with a
 
01:43:40.629 --> 01:43:40.639 align:start position:0%
very very small margin um to to account
 
01:43:43.030 --> 01:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
for um a
 
01:43:45.750 --> 01:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
variance um I'll stop there and see if
 
01:43:47.030 --> 01:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
there are any
 
01:43:49.430 --> 01:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
questions representative Stringham for a
 
01:43:51.910 --> 01:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
question yeah just on on the contractual
 
01:43:53.750 --> 01:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
program services you find that there's
 
01:43:55.910 --> 01:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
any areas uh in there within those
 
01:43:58.149 --> 01:43:58.159 align:start position:0%
contracts where you could both improve
 
01:44:01.830 --> 01:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
quality and uh and increase efficiency
 
01:44:03.589 --> 01:44:03.599 align:start position:0%
by bringing some of the work inhouse
 
01:44:05.709 --> 01:44:05.719 align:start position:0%
rather than doing it through contracts
 
01:44:08.030 --> 01:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
and if so where would that be so the
 
01:44:11.030 --> 01:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
three major ones that I um gave as
 
01:44:14.390 --> 01:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
example the the pharmacy rebates no I
 
01:44:16.669 --> 01:44:16.679 align:start position:0%
think that's a A specialized technology
 
01:44:19.830 --> 01:44:19.840 align:start position:0%
area and the medical loss ratio no
 
01:44:21.790 --> 01:44:21.800 align:start position:0%
because I think the these companies do
 
01:44:24.270 --> 01:44:24.280 align:start position:0%
this every day and an actuary our
 
01:44:26.310 --> 01:44:26.320 align:start position:0%
actuary is the largest actuary in the
 
01:44:29.109 --> 01:44:29.119 align:start position:0%
Medicaid space in the country they do 30
 
01:44:32.030 --> 01:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
States and you know that I just don't
 
01:44:34.149 --> 01:44:34.159 align:start position:0%
think we would being operating alone
 
01:44:37.470 --> 01:44:37.480 align:start position:0%
would have that level of expertise um
 
01:44:40.030 --> 01:44:40.040 align:start position:0%
you know we we do I think a good amount
 
01:44:43.390 --> 01:44:43.400 align:start position:0%
of work with our our team um both in
 
01:44:46.830 --> 01:44:46.840 align:start position:0%
finance and um and and Medicaid that
 
01:44:50.589 --> 01:44:50.599 align:start position:0%
that we can do um but that there's very
 
01:44:53.470 --> 01:44:53.480 align:start position:0%
little dollars here that I think um
 
01:44:55.790 --> 01:44:55.800 align:start position:0%
would work in that
 
01:44:59.390 --> 01:44:59.400 align:start position:0%
fashion and and I I I think it's um also
 
01:45:01.189 --> 01:45:01.199 align:start position:0%
just to highlight this um because we
 
01:45:03.830 --> 01:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
were talking about hb2 earlier so in
 
01:45:07.870 --> 01:45:07.880 align:start position:0%
that in that 102 contract um there there
 
01:45:10.270 --> 01:45:10.280 align:start position:0%
is an impact of an hb2 provision that
 
01:45:12.990 --> 01:45:13.000 align:start position:0%
will be in the final hb2 that comes out
 
01:45:15.510 --> 01:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
and what what that's doing there is
 
01:45:17.669 --> 01:45:17.679 align:start position:0%
effectively over the bium reducing that
 
01:45:20.629 --> 01:45:20.639 align:start position:0%
line by a million dollars it's 500,000
 
01:45:23.990 --> 01:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
each year it's 5050 and and it's a
 
01:45:27.109 --> 01:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
directive to um reduce the the um the
 
01:45:30.070 --> 01:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
Actuarial contract um so that we only
 
01:45:33.470 --> 01:45:33.480 align:start position:0%
conduct One Rate adjustment each year uh
 
01:45:36.030 --> 01:45:36.040 align:start position:0%
typically we do two rate adjustments one
 
01:45:37.790 --> 01:45:37.800 align:start position:0%
at the end of the state fiscal year one
 
01:45:40.669 --> 01:45:40.679 align:start position:0%
around December time frame and so um
 
01:45:42.270 --> 01:45:42.280 align:start position:0%
there was about a million dollars total
 
01:45:44.790 --> 01:45:44.800 align:start position:0%
funds and cost savings generated by that
 
01:45:46.870 --> 01:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
hb2 provision and that's been reflected
 
01:45:50.229 --> 01:45:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:53.229 --> 01:45:53.239 align:start position:0%
line representative Neno thank you Madam
 
01:45:56.990 --> 01:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
chair so just just so I understand so to
 
01:46:00.790 --> 01:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
the extent that the you have the savings
 
01:46:03.229 --> 01:46:03.239 align:start position:0%
that is that showing up as a net number
 
01:46:05.550 --> 01:46:05.560 align:start position:0%
in the in the contract line or do the
 
01:46:08.189 --> 01:46:08.199 align:start position:0%
savings you know the refunds like I
 
01:46:10.070 --> 01:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
guess in particular so you cited a
 
01:46:13.990 --> 01:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
couple of vendors that result in um uh
 
01:46:17.030 --> 01:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
one was a refund on the I guess the
 
01:46:19.750 --> 01:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs and the the rebates
 
01:46:22.589 --> 01:46:22.599 align:start position:0%
show up in a a different spot uh the
 
01:46:25.830 --> 01:46:25.840 align:start position:0%
drug rebates um and and what about the
 
01:46:32.830 --> 01:46:32.840 align:start position:0%
other savings uh so on the um the uh the
 
01:46:35.390 --> 01:46:35.400 align:start position:0%
medical loss ratio in the dental program
 
01:46:37.950 --> 01:46:37.960 align:start position:0%
or the MCM program that would um come
 
01:46:40.470 --> 01:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
down to net the expenses and in those
 
01:46:43.270 --> 01:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
areas so one of them is already
 
01:46:45.669 --> 01:46:45.679 align:start position:0%
reflected in the the the numbers that
 
01:46:47.149 --> 01:46:47.159 align:start position:0%
you've got in there and the cost and the
 
01:46:50.589 --> 01:46:50.599 align:start position:0%
other one shows up somewhere else yeah
 
01:46:53.709 --> 01:46:53.719 align:start position:0%
so the the rebate savings in accounting
 
01:46:53.719 --> 01:46:54.870 align:start position:0%
so the the rebate savings in accounting
unit

01:46:54.870 --> 01:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
unit
 
01:47:00.709 --> 01:47:00.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:04.070 --> 01:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
07 what where would I find that in what
 
01:47:06.189 --> 01:47:06.199 align:start position:0%
page it's on page of the governor's
 
01:47:07.589 --> 01:47:07.599 align:start position:0%
operating budget
 
01:47:10.030 --> 01:47:10.040 align:start position:0%
891 um we we we will be going through
 
01:47:11.390 --> 01:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
that so we can certainly talk about that
 
01:47:12.990 --> 01:47:13.000 align:start position:0%
rebate Revenue when we get there though
 
01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.550 align:start position:0%
rebate Revenue when we get there though
that's

01:47:15.550 --> 01:47:15.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:18.510 --> 01:47:18.520 align:start position:0%
easier okay and 892 but we'll get to
 
01:47:19.790 --> 01:47:19.800 align:start position:0%
that as you
 
01:47:23.510 --> 01:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
say okay all set to proceed okay
 
01:47:27.990 --> 01:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
thank you so um going to 8 um the very
 
01:47:30.950 --> 01:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
bottom of 888 8889 to
 
01:47:36.310 --> 01:47:36.320 align:start position:0%
890 um state phase down um which is on
 
01:47:38.430 --> 01:47:38.440 align:start position:0%
the top of slide
 
01:47:38.440 --> 01:47:40.990 align:start position:0%
the top of slide
17

01:47:40.990 --> 01:47:41.000 align:start position:0%
17
 
01:47:45.510 --> 01:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
um so in the Medicaid Program there are
 
01:47:49.109 --> 01:47:49.119 align:start position:0%
certain seniors um who also have
 
01:47:51.910 --> 01:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
Medicare coverage um we call them duly
 
01:47:55.350 --> 01:47:55.360 align:start position:0%
eligible for Medicaid and Medicare
 
01:48:00.550 --> 01:48:00.560 align:start position:0%
um the state picks up uh some of their
 
01:48:04.709 --> 01:48:04.719 align:start position:0%
cost for prescription drugs um and that
 
01:48:08.030 --> 01:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
amount that has to be picked up is by
 
01:48:10.109 --> 01:48:10.119 align:start position:0%
each state for these people who are duly
 
01:48:12.669 --> 01:48:12.679 align:start position:0%
eligible is a number that we don't get
 
01:48:15.030 --> 01:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
to decide it's a it's a if you will like
 
01:48:20.430 --> 01:48:20.440 align:start position:0%
a premium we have to pay um and
 
01:48:23.390 --> 01:48:23.400 align:start position:0%
um we are paying um
 
01:48:25.589 --> 01:48:25.599 align:start position:0%
and the amount that we end up having to
 
01:48:28.189 --> 01:48:28.199 align:start position:0%
pay is unfortunately not in sync with
 
01:48:30.149 --> 01:48:30.159 align:start position:0%
the the budget so we make our best
 
01:48:33.030 --> 01:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
estimate the last increase I think was
 
01:48:35.629 --> 01:48:35.639 align:start position:0%
8% as you know prescription drugs if you
 
01:48:38.550 --> 01:48:38.560 align:start position:0%
have a Part D premium um they're not
 
01:48:43.030 --> 01:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
going down um and uh so in part we've
 
01:48:45.629 --> 01:48:45.639 align:start position:0%
made our best best case estimate if I'm
 
01:48:48.709 --> 01:48:48.719 align:start position:0%
remembering correctly we're paying about
 
01:48:52.470 --> 01:48:52.480 align:start position:0%
$273 today for on a on a monthly basis
 
01:48:56.629 --> 01:48:56.639 align:start position:0%
per person for that coverage for those
 
01:48:56.639 --> 01:48:58.790 align:start position:0%
per person for that coverage for those
individuals

01:48:58.790 --> 01:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
01:49:05.149 --> 01:49:05.159 align:start position:0%
yep just so um it is um it's it's one of
 
01:49:07.790 --> 01:49:07.800 align:start position:0%
those expenses that we
 
01:49:10.629 --> 01:49:10.639 align:start position:0%
really states do not have an ability to
 
01:49:12.550 --> 01:49:12.560 align:start position:0%
control other than through trying to
 
01:49:14.470 --> 01:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
keep their people healthy if you will
 
01:49:16.910 --> 01:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
and the amount of drugs that in number
 
01:49:18.830 --> 01:49:18.840 align:start position:0%
of people on the program representative
 
01:49:20.390 --> 01:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
priest for a question and then
 
01:49:22.709 --> 01:49:22.719 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham thank you madam
 
01:49:25.310 --> 01:49:25.320 align:start position:0%
chairman on page
 
01:49:32.350 --> 01:49:32.360 align:start position:0%
889 on item 049 transfer to other state
 
01:49:35.589 --> 01:49:35.599 align:start position:0%
agencies what is that um so earlier I
 
01:49:37.870 --> 01:49:37.880 align:start position:0%
was mentioning that the uncompensated
 
01:49:39.910 --> 01:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
care or disproportionate share funds
 
01:49:42.070 --> 01:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
that are paid to New Hampshire hospital
 
01:49:45.589 --> 01:49:45.599 align:start position:0%
Glen Cliffe um and formerly Hamstead
 
01:49:48.149 --> 01:49:48.159 align:start position:0%
that's where those transfers run through
 
01:49:49.830 --> 01:49:49.840 align:start position:0%
so it's really as I was saying it's not
 
01:49:52.350 --> 01:49:52.360 align:start position:0%
an an administrative expense per se it's
 
01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:53.430 align:start position:0%
an an administrative expense per se it's
just

01:49:53.430 --> 01:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:49:55.030 --> 01:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
the accounting of where the how the
 
01:49:57.229 --> 01:49:57.239 align:start position:0%
money comes in and then gets paid
 
01:50:00.030 --> 01:50:00.040 align:start position:0%
out and and when we get to New Hampshire
 
01:50:01.830 --> 01:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
hospital and glencliffe in a couple of
 
01:50:03.430 --> 01:50:03.440 align:start position:0%
weeks you will see the corresponding
 
01:50:06.629 --> 01:50:06.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:10.390 --> 01:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
item right you had reviewed that earlier
 
01:50:11.629 --> 01:50:11.639 align:start position:0%
um it's a
 
01:50:14.470 --> 01:50:14.480 align:start position:0%
little a little deceiving uh but thank
 
01:50:16.229 --> 01:50:16.239 align:start position:0%
you for that clarification okay
 
01:50:17.390 --> 01:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham followed by
 
01:50:19.750 --> 01:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
representative tarki in terms of the
 
01:50:22.709 --> 01:50:22.719 align:start position:0%
Medicaid um uh program in the far
 
01:50:26.149 --> 01:50:26.159 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy um do you have any flexibility
 
01:50:30.790 --> 01:50:30.800 align:start position:0%
uh on um uh what drugs are included uh
 
01:50:34.510 --> 01:50:34.520 align:start position:0%
what price you pay uh whether there's a
 
01:50:37.430 --> 01:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
a cap per patient uh you know how
 
01:50:39.669 --> 01:50:39.679 align:start position:0%
restrictive is the federal program and
 
01:50:41.709 --> 01:50:41.719 align:start position:0%
do you have to be in this program to be
 
01:50:44.589 --> 01:50:44.599 align:start position:0%
part of of Medicaid in
 
01:50:49.390 --> 01:50:49.400 align:start position:0%
general so I think going back to the the
 
01:50:51.510 --> 01:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
number three on that list sort of gets
 
01:50:55.189 --> 01:50:55.199 align:start position:0%
to a little bit to that that um under
 
01:50:57.149 --> 01:50:57.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law there's a a
 
01:50:59.310 --> 01:50:59.320 align:start position:0%
requirement to use generics first which
 
01:51:03.069 --> 01:51:03.079 align:start position:0%
I think generally would make sense um
 
01:51:06.310 --> 01:51:06.320 align:start position:0%
except in the world of Medicaid where um
 
01:51:10.870 --> 01:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
rebates are um are larger and so what
 
01:51:14.189 --> 01:51:14.199 align:start position:0%
we're asking for um in legislation I
 
01:51:17.709 --> 01:51:17.719 align:start position:0%
think Senate Bill 119 I believe is a
 
01:51:19.790 --> 01:51:19.800 align:start position:0%
version and the governor is asking in
 
01:51:22.629 --> 01:51:22.639 align:start position:0%
her budget is to include this and I
 
01:51:23.910 --> 01:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
think when I was watching representative
 
01:51:25.229 --> 01:51:25.239 align:start position:0%
Daniels you had a question does that
 
01:51:26.390 --> 01:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
increase the cost of the federal
 
01:51:28.990 --> 01:51:29.000 align:start position:0%
government actually lowers it um because
 
01:51:31.069 --> 01:51:31.079 align:start position:0%
they pay their Federal share so if
 
01:51:33.510 --> 01:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
there's less expense for the state the
 
01:51:35.310 --> 01:51:35.320 align:start position:0%
amount that the federal government would
 
01:51:38.270 --> 01:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
have to pay would be less as well so
 
01:51:40.510 --> 01:51:40.520 align:start position:0%
it's a I think a double win if you will
 
01:51:43.270 --> 01:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:51:46.910 --> 01:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
um so what that we're asking for it's
 
01:51:48.709 --> 01:51:48.719 align:start position:0%
not always the case that with rebate
 
01:51:50.229 --> 01:51:50.239 align:start position:0%
that we're asking to allow the
 
01:51:53.109 --> 01:51:53.119 align:start position:0%
department to where it is more favorable
 
01:51:55.390 --> 01:51:55.400 align:start position:0%
to the state and to overall healthare
 
01:51:58.669 --> 01:51:58.679 align:start position:0%
cost to be able to to to access a brand
 
01:52:01.750 --> 01:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
name drug so getting to your question um
 
01:52:03.709 --> 01:52:03.719 align:start position:0%
regarding there are in order to
 
01:52:05.189 --> 01:52:05.199 align:start position:0%
participate in the federal rebate
 
01:52:07.950 --> 01:52:07.960 align:start position:0%
program you do have to have on your
 
01:52:11.350 --> 01:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
formulary access to um FDA approved
 
01:52:14.229 --> 01:52:14.239 align:start position:0%
drugs that being said states can develop
 
01:52:17.709 --> 01:52:17.719 align:start position:0%
utilization criteria there's a a runway
 
01:52:20.750 --> 01:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
for States I think typically six months
 
01:52:23.229 --> 01:52:23.239 align:start position:0%
before they'd have to included in their
 
01:52:24.950 --> 01:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
formulary you can develop different
 
01:52:27.109 --> 01:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
criteria you know you're not forced to
 
01:52:31.109 --> 01:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
just hand out pills um it's it's can be
 
01:52:34.470 --> 01:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
based on you know appropriate U clinical
 
01:52:37.189 --> 01:52:37.199 align:start position:0%
um utilization criteria you know
 
01:52:40.030 --> 01:52:40.040 align:start position:0%
medicine in the Medicaid
 
01:52:42.589 --> 01:52:42.599 align:start position:0%
Program has grown since I've been in the
 
01:52:44.030 --> 01:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
Medicaid director a little over seven
 
01:52:46.149 --> 01:52:46.159 align:start position:0%
years when I first came in it was about
 
01:52:50.390 --> 01:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
18% of the medical spend today it's
 
01:52:53.109 --> 01:52:53.119 align:start position:0%
31% so it's an area in the and when we
 
01:52:54.589 --> 01:52:54.599 align:start position:0%
did the reprocurement that we
 
01:52:57.990 --> 01:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
restructured how um the state shares
 
01:53:01.350 --> 01:53:01.360 align:start position:0%
that risk with um the the
 
01:53:04.790 --> 01:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
mcos there's also um when I first
 
01:53:06.910 --> 01:53:06.920 align:start position:0%
started the program up until two or
 
01:53:08.910 --> 01:53:08.920 align:start position:0%
three years ago there'd be like one or
 
01:53:12.350 --> 01:53:12.360 align:start position:0%
two of these very expensive um Gene
 
01:53:14.830 --> 01:53:14.840 align:start position:0%
therapies or biological
 
01:53:17.550 --> 01:53:17.560 align:start position:0%
treatments um last year when we
 
01:53:21.270 --> 01:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
developed our budget uh or excuse me um
 
01:53:25.270 --> 01:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
in 20 24 Managed Care rates there were
 
01:53:28.669 --> 01:53:28.679 align:start position:0%
66 new therapies of over
 
01:53:32.270 --> 01:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
$100,000 and there the velocity of these
 
01:53:36.390 --> 01:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
coming at us are incredibly High um and
 
01:53:39.910 --> 01:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh you know we've fortunately um you
 
01:53:41.589 --> 01:53:41.599 align:start position:0%
know have not a lot of these are for
 
01:53:46.109 --> 01:53:46.119 align:start position:0%
rare conditions um but they're um all
 
01:53:49.270 --> 01:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
jenma as an example of it that acquiring
 
01:53:52.990 --> 01:53:53.000 align:start position:0%
that um that uh therapy before
 
01:53:56.270 --> 01:53:56.280 align:start position:0%
for rebate the cost of the therapy alone
 
01:53:59.350 --> 01:53:59.360 align:start position:0%
is $2.4 million for treatment now what
 
01:54:01.629 --> 01:54:01.639 align:start position:0%
that does is a child that has duan's
 
01:54:01.639 --> 01:54:02.709 align:start position:0%
that does is a child that has duan's
distrophy

01:54:02.709 --> 01:54:02.719 align:start position:0%
distrophy
 
01:54:05.589 --> 01:54:05.599 align:start position:0%
they won't have it and think about what
 
01:54:08.390 --> 01:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
the lifetime cost of caring for someone
 
01:54:12.629 --> 01:54:12.639 align:start position:0%
for 20 or more years um and you have to
 
01:54:14.709 --> 01:54:14.719 align:start position:0%
get it in a certain interval for it to
 
01:54:16.709 --> 01:54:16.719 align:start position:0%
be effective you have in that one
 
01:54:19.950 --> 01:54:19.960 align:start position:0%
particular one need it by five or after
 
01:54:22.950 --> 01:54:22.960 align:start position:0%
five it doesn't work so
 
01:54:25.470 --> 01:54:25.480 align:start position:0%
um they these are very important issues
 
01:54:27.990 --> 01:54:28.000 align:start position:0%
to to individuals who have these rare
 
01:54:30.390 --> 01:54:30.400 align:start position:0%
conditions and that's why we want to run
 
01:54:34.990 --> 01:54:35.000 align:start position:0%
the program um not just efficiently but
 
01:54:37.430 --> 01:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
effectively so that we can bring the
 
01:54:39.709 --> 01:54:39.719 align:start position:0%
therapies that would bring benefit to
 
01:54:42.990 --> 01:54:43.000 align:start position:0%
the public but also to you know manage
 
01:54:45.229 --> 01:54:45.239 align:start position:0%
our costs the best we can excuse me I
 
01:54:46.709 --> 01:54:46.719 align:start position:0%
think I'm e need some more
 
01:54:49.950 --> 01:54:49.960 align:start position:0%
water sure uh we do have questions in
 
01:54:52.709 --> 01:54:52.719 align:start position:0%
the queue representative tarki followed
 
01:54:57.109 --> 01:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
by Representative no Nelco um we're now
 
01:54:59.589 --> 01:54:59.599 align:start position:0%
at the 3:00 just about the 3:00 Mark I
 
01:55:01.950 --> 01:55:01.960 align:start position:0%
see we're on slide 17 just want to make
 
01:55:05.149 --> 01:55:05.159 align:start position:0%
sure you're running like you want to be
 
01:55:06.589 --> 01:55:06.599 align:start position:0%
running I I think we're getting through
 
01:55:10.229 --> 01:55:10.239 align:start position:0%
the important parts and and we're almost
 
01:55:13.669 --> 01:55:13.679 align:start position:0%
done through the governor's um budget a
 
01:55:15.870 --> 01:55:15.880 align:start position:0%
lot of the rest of the material can move
 
01:55:17.910 --> 01:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
a lot faster I think okay and let us
 
01:55:26.470 --> 01:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:28.270 --> 01:55:28.280 align:start position:0%
I'm talking too
 
01:55:31.189 --> 01:55:31.199 align:start position:0%
much as expected yeah okay
 
01:55:33.470 --> 01:55:33.480 align:start position:0%
representative tersi representative
 
01:55:36.149 --> 01:55:36.159 align:start position:0%
Neno you're onk you thank you I want to
 
01:55:38.669 --> 01:55:38.679 align:start position:0%
thank you again for the amount of time
 
01:55:40.350 --> 01:55:40.360 align:start position:0%
you're and information you're giving us
 
01:55:42.990 --> 01:55:43.000 align:start position:0%
this is not an easy task um I originally
 
01:55:45.589 --> 01:55:45.599 align:start position:0%
had raised my hand because I wanted to
 
01:55:47.910 --> 01:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
um continue to bring attention to the
 
01:55:49.629 --> 01:55:49.639 align:start position:0%
mystery document here cuz I thought we
 
01:55:51.910 --> 01:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
were hitting bullet three appears I was
 
01:55:51.920 --> 01:55:52.990 align:start position:0%
were hitting bullet three appears I was
correct

01:55:52.990 --> 01:55:53.000 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:55:56.069 --> 01:55:56.079 align:start position:0%
um can you just clarify though um that
 
01:55:59.350 --> 01:55:59.360 align:start position:0%
this section on the acquisition of um
 
01:56:02.149 --> 01:56:02.159 align:start position:0%
generic and name brand drugs is already
 
01:56:04.270 --> 01:56:04.280 align:start position:0%
included in the hb2 trailer Bill draft
 
01:56:07.030 --> 01:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
that we have seen yes it is okay thank
 
01:56:10.069 --> 01:56:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:12.950 --> 01:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
is representative Neno yeah I just want
 
01:56:15.310 --> 01:56:15.320 align:start position:0%
to take the opportunity to again thank
 
01:56:17.950 --> 01:56:17.960 align:start position:0%
you for the presentation materials it's
 
01:56:20.550 --> 01:56:20.560 align:start position:0%
uh uh difficult to follow this stuff
 
01:56:22.350 --> 01:56:22.360 align:start position:0%
jumping from one document to another but
 
01:56:24.870 --> 01:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
I think this uh presents it in a way
 
01:56:28.229 --> 01:56:28.239 align:start position:0%
that uh we can cross reference the the
 
01:56:32.750 --> 01:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
material to the various documents and uh
 
01:56:35.709 --> 01:56:35.719 align:start position:0%
my question is on
 
01:56:40.109 --> 01:56:40.119 align:start position:0%
890 uh and probably this is the same
 
01:56:42.069 --> 01:56:42.079 align:start position:0%
kind of a question and I you know just
 
01:56:43.790 --> 01:56:43.800 align:start position:0%
wasn't paying attention but I'll I'll
 
01:56:45.790 --> 01:56:45.800 align:start position:0%
ask it anyhow the the drop in the
 
01:56:48.910 --> 01:56:48.920 align:start position:0%
hospital uncompensated carepool is just
 
01:56:51.589 --> 01:56:51.599 align:start position:0%
a shift from one place to another is
 
01:56:51.599 --> 01:56:52.910 align:start position:0%
a shift from one place to another is
that

01:56:52.910 --> 01:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:56:54.870 --> 01:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
yes I think this is probably the most
 
01:56:56.470 --> 01:56:56.480 align:start position:0%
we're we're we're dealing now with the
 
01:56:59.270 --> 01:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care fund 7943 thank you
 
01:57:01.510 --> 01:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
very much yeah that's right line line
 
01:57:05.750 --> 01:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
515 on I guess 890 so so the concept
 
01:57:09.310 --> 01:57:09.320 align:start position:0%
here um and one of the I think questions
 
01:57:12.709 --> 01:57:12.719 align:start position:0%
that we received um from Committee
 
01:57:16.510 --> 01:57:16.520 align:start position:0%
Member um what you see playing out here
 
01:57:20.030 --> 01:57:20.040 align:start position:0%
is how The uncompensated CARE program is
 
01:57:23.830 --> 01:57:23.840 align:start position:0%
evolving um the
 
01:57:25.870 --> 01:57:25.880 align:start position:0%
um at one
 
01:57:28.990 --> 01:57:29.000 align:start position:0%
point um and for many for decades
 
01:57:33.310 --> 01:57:33.320 align:start position:0%
actually um at least two New Hampshire
 
01:57:37.589 --> 01:57:37.599 align:start position:0%
would um uh collect through the Dr the
 
01:57:39.510 --> 01:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
department of retive administration
 
01:57:41.350 --> 01:57:41.360 align:start position:0%
What's called the Medicaid enhancement
 
01:57:45.870 --> 01:57:45.880 align:start position:0%
tax um or assessment it's basically a
 
01:57:50.589 --> 01:57:50.599 align:start position:0%
5.4% um on on Hospital services and by
 
01:57:53.470 --> 01:57:53.480 align:start position:0%
Hospital services it's as defined in a
 
01:57:56.030 --> 01:57:56.040 align:start position:0%
Medicare cost report as Hospital
 
01:57:59.990 --> 01:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
Services um and that money um comes to
 
01:58:02.669 --> 01:58:02.679 align:start position:0%
the to this department Via de the
 
01:58:04.350 --> 01:58:04.360 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue
 
01:58:06.910 --> 01:58:06.920 align:start position:0%
Administration the state makes a federal
 
01:58:09.510 --> 01:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
claim on that at
 
01:58:12.470 --> 01:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
50% and then a portion of that
 
01:58:14.030 --> 01:58:14.040 align:start position:0%
historically has been
 
01:58:18.510 --> 01:58:18.520 align:start position:0%
91% would come back to hospitals not
 
01:58:20.589 --> 01:58:20.599 align:start position:0%
each one getting 91% of what they paid
 
01:58:22.870 --> 01:58:22.880 align:start position:0%
but based on the amount of uncompensated
 
01:58:25.790 --> 01:58:25.800 align:start position:0%
care they would tap into the
 
01:58:30.149 --> 01:58:30.159 align:start position:0%
pool um over time
 
01:58:33.910 --> 01:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
um uh rules around this have changed
 
01:58:39.430 --> 01:58:39.440 align:start position:0%
federally it's become advantageous to um
 
01:58:41.790 --> 01:58:41.800 align:start position:0%
what's not paid out to the to the
 
01:58:45.390 --> 01:58:45.400 align:start position:0%
hospitals helps support other providers
 
01:58:48.510 --> 01:58:48.520 align:start position:0%
um and and then that 7948 account and
 
01:58:48.520 --> 01:58:49.750 align:start position:0%
um and and then that 7948 account and
and

01:58:49.750 --> 01:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:58:52.550 --> 01:58:52.560 align:start position:0%
others and supports the Medicaid program
 
01:58:56.990 --> 01:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
so 9% of the of the amount equivalent
 
01:59:00.910 --> 01:59:00.920 align:start position:0%
amount is comes to the state as if you
 
01:59:03.629 --> 01:59:03.639 align:start position:0%
will an extra to the to the 50% match
 
01:59:03.639 --> 01:59:04.990 align:start position:0%
will an extra to the to the 50% match
they

01:59:04.990 --> 01:59:05.000 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:59:10.310 --> 01:59:10.320 align:start position:0%
had um that 16 RSA
 
01:59:13.470 --> 01:59:13.480 align:start position:0%
167 um I think 18 is where you find the
 
01:59:17.870 --> 01:59:17.880 align:start position:0%
the law that's um that sort of governs
 
01:59:17.880 --> 01:59:18.950 align:start position:0%
the law that's um that sort of governs
um

01:59:18.950 --> 01:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:22.629 --> 01:59:22.639 align:start position:0%
the how how this money is is handled
 
01:59:26.310 --> 01:59:26.320 align:start position:0%
and paid to the hospitals today it today
 
01:59:30.870 --> 01:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
the the the language and the law doesn't
 
01:59:34.510 --> 01:59:34.520 align:start position:0%
Define exactly it it defines about how
 
01:59:37.350 --> 01:59:37.360 align:start position:0%
the money comes in how it's protected um
 
01:59:39.950 --> 01:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
but the percentages that come out is
 
01:59:43.030 --> 01:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
something that has evolved there was a
 
01:59:45.589 --> 01:59:45.599 align:start position:0%
an agreement that was codified in um
 
01:59:48.629 --> 01:59:48.639 align:start position:0%
legislation in 2018 that legislation
 
01:59:50.629 --> 01:59:50.639 align:start position:0%
expired last session there was an
 
01:59:52.270 --> 01:59:52.280 align:start position:0%
attempt to come up with a new new
 
01:59:55.229 --> 01:59:55.239 align:start position:0%
agreement um there was not an agreement
 
01:59:57.510 --> 01:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
that and then the governor and
 
01:59:59.790 --> 01:59:59.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner have
 
02:00:02.550 --> 02:00:02.560 align:start position:0%
um the what we you might under have
 
02:00:05.669 --> 02:00:05.679 align:start position:0%
heard about an 80% of the federal match
 
02:00:08.669 --> 02:00:08.679 align:start position:0%
coming back to the to the uh hospitals
 
02:00:10.629 --> 02:00:10.639 align:start position:0%
as opposed to
 
02:00:13.270 --> 02:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
91% so getting back directly to your
 
02:00:14.470 --> 02:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
question and what you're seeing in the
 
02:00:16.990 --> 02:00:17.000 align:start position:0%
numbers here is that it's been
 
02:00:19.109 --> 02:00:19.119 align:start position:0%
advantageous not to
 
02:00:22.030 --> 02:00:22.040 align:start position:0%
pay to all the parties not to pay out
 
02:00:23.709 --> 02:00:23.719 align:start position:0%
the money through traditional
 
02:00:26.990 --> 02:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care um but to pay it
 
02:00:31.390 --> 02:00:31.400 align:start position:0%
through um related to Medicaid services
 
02:00:33.709 --> 02:00:33.719 align:start position:0%
and the uncomp uncompensated care
 
02:00:36.950 --> 02:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
associated with that and um people who
 
02:00:37.830 --> 02:00:37.840 align:start position:0%
have no
 
02:00:40.629 --> 02:00:40.639 align:start position:0%
insurance and and what we've done here
 
02:00:42.709 --> 02:00:42.719 align:start position:0%
is that we've increased for example on
 
02:00:45.189 --> 02:00:45.199 align:start position:0%
Hospital rates and patient
 
02:00:49.030 --> 02:00:49.040 align:start position:0%
rates um the the amount that um went
 
02:00:52.390 --> 02:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
from say the average um case have gone
 
02:00:55.830 --> 02:00:55.840 align:start position:0%
from like um 3500 today we're paying
 
02:00:58.350 --> 02:00:58.360 align:start position:0%
over 9,000 where that difference is
 
02:01:00.669 --> 02:01:00.679 align:start position:0%
coming is Shifting it from uncompensated
 
02:01:04.750 --> 02:01:04.760 align:start position:0%
care category here to um provider rates
 
02:01:04.760 --> 02:01:05.629 align:start position:0%
care category here to um provider rates
in

02:01:05.629 --> 02:01:05.639 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:01:08.870 --> 02:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
7948 what that allows us to draw is a
 
02:01:11.470 --> 02:01:11.480 align:start position:0%
higher Federal match on those on those
 
02:01:14.229 --> 02:01:14.239 align:start position:0%
dollars which makes more money available
 
02:01:17.550 --> 02:01:17.560 align:start position:0%
to support the Medicaid Program and more
 
02:01:18.910 --> 02:01:18.920 align:start position:0%
available to work out in The
 
02:01:21.629 --> 02:01:21.639 align:start position:0%
uncompensated CARE program in terms of
 
02:01:21.639 --> 02:01:22.990 align:start position:0%
uncompensated CARE program in terms of
the

02:01:22.990 --> 02:01:23.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:01:24.870 --> 02:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
the percentage that each party gets in
 
02:01:27.350 --> 02:01:27.360 align:start position:0%
that that's that I think is still
 
02:01:29.430 --> 02:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
subject to you know in the governor's
 
02:01:32.910 --> 02:01:32.920 align:start position:0%
budget it's it's 80% that's where um it
 
02:01:36.149 --> 02:01:36.159 align:start position:0%
stands today I'm expecting that um
 
02:01:38.149 --> 02:01:38.159 align:start position:0%
there'll be more conversations in the
 
02:01:40.589 --> 02:01:40.599 align:start position:0%
legislature and and with the governor
 
02:01:42.870 --> 02:01:42.880 align:start position:0%
and the hospitals about this topic but
 
02:01:45.350 --> 02:01:45.360 align:start position:0%
what's represented here today is the
 
02:01:48.109 --> 02:01:48.119 align:start position:0%
80% approach and what that means is some
 
02:01:50.510 --> 02:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
of the dollars that would appear as
 
02:01:53.669 --> 02:01:53.679 align:start position:0%
going out at that 50% % match are now in
 
02:01:57.870 --> 02:01:57.880 align:start position:0%
the other parts of the budget 7948 being
 
02:02:00.229 --> 02:02:00.239 align:start position:0%
the largest that where we're paying out
 
02:02:02.069 --> 02:02:02.079 align:start position:0%
higher rates as opposed to uncompensated
 
02:02:04.350 --> 02:02:04.360 align:start position:0%
care so instead of getting a 50% match
 
02:02:07.669 --> 02:02:07.679 align:start position:0%
we might get closer to a 60% match in
 
02:02:09.270 --> 02:02:09.280 align:start position:0%
the granted Advantage
 
02:02:13.229 --> 02:02:13.239 align:start position:0%
space um our match is 90% and paying out
 
02:02:17.830 --> 02:02:17.840 align:start position:0%
in rates um there um the match instead
 
02:02:21.350 --> 02:02:21.360 align:start position:0%
of being 50 is 90 and so some of what's
 
02:02:25.189 --> 02:02:25.199 align:start position:0%
formerly this account is now um in in
 
02:02:25.199 --> 02:02:26.589 align:start position:0%
formerly this account is now um in in
granted

02:02:26.589 --> 02:02:26.599 align:start position:0%
granted
 
02:02:29.149 --> 02:02:29.159 align:start position:0%
Advantage um which is to say this is
 
02:02:32.990 --> 02:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
hard to hard to follow um because one
 
02:02:37.430 --> 02:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
we're we're U moving dollars to the area
 
02:02:39.990 --> 02:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
where it's most advantageous in terms of
 
02:02:43.149 --> 02:02:43.159 align:start position:0%
the total pool of money and secondly
 
02:02:45.589 --> 02:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
that there there's a part of the money
 
02:02:49.709 --> 02:02:49.719 align:start position:0%
that is now part of granted Advantage um
 
02:02:53.589 --> 02:02:53.599 align:start position:0%
but that's all um we can all account for
 
02:02:55.830 --> 02:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
all of it and we can certainly
 
02:02:57.189 --> 02:02:57.199 align:start position:0%
demonstrate it but I just as you're
 
02:02:59.270 --> 02:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
looking at this say why are numbers
 
02:03:01.750 --> 02:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
changing so much it's because of that
 
02:03:04.870 --> 02:03:04.880 align:start position:0%
Dynamic that's playing out right now in
 
02:03:08.350 --> 02:03:08.360 align:start position:0%
2025 and and will play out in 26
 
02:03:11.390 --> 02:03:11.400 align:start position:0%
27 okay we have represent just a real
 
02:03:15.149 --> 02:03:15.159 align:start position:0%
quick so are you using an algorithm or
 
02:03:17.229 --> 02:03:17.239 align:start position:0%
something to optimize this looks like a
 
02:03:20.430 --> 02:03:20.440 align:start position:0%
some kind of a subprogram to to optimize
 
02:03:24.390 --> 02:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
the The Matrix there a you will
 
02:03:28.669 --> 02:03:28.679 align:start position:0%
well actually no but um it's sort of
 
02:03:32.709 --> 02:03:32.719 align:start position:0%
like uh solving simultaneous equations
 
02:03:35.069 --> 02:03:35.079 align:start position:0%
because give you an example if you're a
 
02:03:38.189 --> 02:03:38.199 align:start position:0%
border hospital and the uncompensated
 
02:03:41.390 --> 02:03:41.400 align:start position:0%
care is based only on Medicaid when you
 
02:03:43.830 --> 02:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
pay out pure uncompensated care you can
 
02:03:46.950 --> 02:03:46.960 align:start position:0%
I can pay we can pay a hospital for New
 
02:03:48.350 --> 02:03:48.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Medicaid patients
 
02:03:51.430 --> 02:03:51.440 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care and let's say Vermont
 
02:03:53.910 --> 02:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
or Massachusetts that we can draw a
 
02:03:55.310 --> 02:03:55.320 align:start position:0%
federal match on that when you pay it
 
02:03:57.030 --> 02:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
out in Rat you can only pay it for New
 
02:03:57.040 --> 02:03:57.950 align:start position:0%
out in Rat you can only pay it for New
Hampshire

02:03:57.950 --> 02:03:57.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:04:01.589 --> 02:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
patients in um the design of the the
 
02:04:03.790 --> 02:04:03.800 align:start position:0%
payment plan we've come up with other
 
02:04:05.910 --> 02:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
ways of adjusting for that we've worked
 
02:04:08.229 --> 02:04:08.239 align:start position:0%
with the hospital Association on
 
02:04:11.350 --> 02:04:11.360 align:start position:0%
modifiers for like border hospitals to
 
02:04:14.790 --> 02:04:14.800 align:start position:0%
account for some of that but in the end
 
02:04:16.030 --> 02:04:16.040 align:start position:0%
um you know from the hospitals
 
02:04:18.350 --> 02:04:18.360 align:start position:0%
perspective anyways that
 
02:04:21.030 --> 02:04:21.040 align:start position:0%
um certain hospitals it's better for
 
02:04:22.270 --> 02:04:22.280 align:start position:0%
them to get
 
02:04:23.990 --> 02:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
um some of their dollars in the the
 
02:04:27.149 --> 02:04:27.159 align:start position:0%
traditional way because it you can still
 
02:04:29.790 --> 02:04:29.800 align:start position:0%
pay the traditional way to all types of
 
02:04:32.910 --> 02:04:32.920 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care related to uninsured
 
02:04:35.310 --> 02:04:35.320 align:start position:0%
and and
 
02:04:37.430 --> 02:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
Medicaid um it's it's something we're
 
02:04:39.750 --> 02:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
spending have spent a lot of time on
 
02:04:41.589 --> 02:04:41.599 align:start position:0%
trying to optimize but it's not an
 
02:04:44.229 --> 02:04:44.239 align:start position:0%
algorithm it's more of um formul best
 
02:04:46.790 --> 02:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
fit if you will there's more art than
 
02:04:49.390 --> 02:04:49.400 align:start position:0%
science there Art and Science yes okay
 
02:04:50.870 --> 02:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to go representative Daniels
 
02:04:52.470 --> 02:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
then representative Stringham then
 
02:04:53.709 --> 02:04:53.719 align:start position:0%
representative walner then
 
02:04:56.790 --> 02:04:56.800 align:start position:0%
representative priest thank you uh you
 
02:04:58.589 --> 02:04:58.599 align:start position:0%
you may have answered the question I'm
 
02:05:01.109 --> 02:05:01.119 align:start position:0%
I'm not quite sure okay sure that I had
 
02:05:02.790 --> 02:05:02.800 align:start position:0%
uh but when when you talk about the
 
02:05:05.069 --> 02:05:05.079 align:start position:0%
uncompensated pay you're paying for the
 
02:05:07.910 --> 02:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
unpaid cost of care who is determining
 
02:05:10.709 --> 02:05:10.719 align:start position:0%
that cost is it the hospital that says
 
02:05:12.229 --> 02:05:12.239 align:start position:0%
this aspirin cost
 
02:05:15.870 --> 02:05:15.880 align:start position:0%
$43 or is it the uh Medicaid that says
 
02:05:19.510 --> 02:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
it's 29 cents and what happens with the
 
02:05:23.030 --> 02:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
uninsured so the the cost C is
 
02:05:25.750 --> 02:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
determined through a cost report that
 
02:05:28.149 --> 02:05:28.159 align:start position:0%
it's a a standard Report with standard
 
02:05:31.109 --> 02:05:31.119 align:start position:0%
rules um it's the same report that
 
02:05:33.109 --> 02:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
Medicare uses to determine what the
 
02:05:37.149 --> 02:05:37.159 align:start position:0%
actual cost is and then the costs and
 
02:05:39.629 --> 02:05:39.639 align:start position:0%
the uncompensated part is that the state
 
02:05:42.709 --> 02:05:42.719 align:start position:0%
also hires an auditor we're required to
 
02:05:44.830 --> 02:05:44.840 align:start position:0%
hire an auditor to audit what the
 
02:05:47.510 --> 02:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
hospitals are representing as their
 
02:05:50.109 --> 02:05:50.119 align:start position:0%
costs and the way that this program
 
02:05:52.790 --> 02:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
actually works is so that there's not a
 
02:05:55.549 --> 02:05:55.559 align:start position:0%
delay in compensating for uncompensated
 
02:05:57.669 --> 02:05:57.679 align:start position:0%
care we make an estimate of what
 
02:05:59.629 --> 02:05:59.639 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care is and then we
 
02:06:02.149 --> 02:06:02.159 align:start position:0%
reconcile it some period later because
 
02:06:04.790 --> 02:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
on compensation as you could expect
 
02:06:05.990 --> 02:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes it takes a while for that to
 
02:06:08.189 --> 02:06:08.199 align:start position:0%
play out someone may pay their bill over
 
02:06:11.830 --> 02:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
time um it may not um may not be
 
02:06:13.510 --> 02:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
apparent within a very short period of
 
02:06:16.549 --> 02:06:16.559 align:start position:0%
time what it is so there's it's a it's
 
02:06:19.069 --> 02:06:19.079 align:start position:0%
something that's fairly complex we have
 
02:06:21.270 --> 02:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
technical support on that on a weekly
 
02:06:25.229 --> 02:06:25.239 align:start position:0%
basis that we work with and and U it's a
 
02:06:28.149 --> 02:06:28.159 align:start position:0%
highly um sophisticated it's probably
 
02:06:30.270 --> 02:06:30.280 align:start position:0%
the most difficult part of the Medicaid
 
02:06:32.510 --> 02:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
Program to to comprehend and it takes a
 
02:06:34.669 --> 02:06:34.679 align:start position:0%
team of people to to work it but you
 
02:06:36.830 --> 02:06:36.840 align:start position:0%
know we are audited by the federal
 
02:06:39.310 --> 02:06:39.320 align:start position:0%
government as well on our Audits and
 
02:06:41.350 --> 02:06:41.360 align:start position:0%
there are there are rules on this and
 
02:06:43.030 --> 02:06:43.040 align:start position:0%
there's been litigation over time that
 
02:06:44.549 --> 02:06:44.559 align:start position:0%
have changed the
 
02:06:46.870 --> 02:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
rules but you know just in terms of
 
02:06:48.990 --> 02:06:49.000 align:start position:0%
today's conversation I think that the
 
02:06:50.910 --> 02:06:50.920 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care that we're providing
 
02:06:55.430 --> 02:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
is is is a standard definition and it is
 
02:06:57.470 --> 02:06:57.480 align:start position:0%
not only looked at by us but looked at
 
02:06:59.589 --> 02:06:59.599 align:start position:0%
by an outside auditor who's representing
 
02:07:01.109 --> 02:07:01.119 align:start position:0%
the federal government and how much
 
02:07:03.830 --> 02:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
they're paying ultimately it seems to be
 
02:07:06.069 --> 02:07:06.079 align:start position:0%
based on the Medicare fee schedule
 
02:07:09.470 --> 02:07:09.480 align:start position:0%
Medicare cost finding yes okay thank
 
02:07:13.549 --> 02:07:13.559 align:start position:0%
you yeah thank you um the 7948 is that
 
02:07:16.870 --> 02:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
impatient Hospital services or 7948
 
02:07:19.149 --> 02:07:19.159 align:start position:0%
covers the a lot of just the Managed
 
02:07:21.310 --> 02:07:21.320 align:start position:0%
Care Program um is the Lion Share of
 
02:07:24.870 --> 02:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
that which pays providers so the the
 
02:07:27.629 --> 02:07:27.639 align:start position:0%
kind of rates that that uh have I mean
 
02:07:30.310 --> 02:07:30.320 align:start position:0%
La two years ago when we we adjusted
 
02:07:32.830 --> 02:07:32.840 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rates we left hospitals
 
02:07:34.629 --> 02:07:34.639 align:start position:0%
untouched at
 
02:07:39.350 --> 02:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
0% um but uh uh now now it looks like
 
02:07:41.990 --> 02:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
we've we've done a shift from of 80
 
02:07:43.950 --> 02:07:43.960 align:start position:0%
million or so from the uncompensated
 
02:07:47.990 --> 02:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
care fund to additional Medicaid rates
 
02:07:50.229 --> 02:07:50.239 align:start position:0%
uh I guess through the Managed Care
 
02:07:54.270 --> 02:07:54.280 align:start position:0%
provision uh and um and how how how much
 
02:07:56.270 --> 02:07:56.280 align:start position:0%
did those rates go you said something
 
02:07:59.470 --> 02:07:59.480 align:start position:0%
about 3,000 to 9,000 or was that just a
 
02:08:02.270 --> 02:08:02.280 align:start position:0%
random uh a hypothetical example we we
 
02:08:04.950 --> 02:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
went if I know you're familiar with this
 
02:08:07.669 --> 02:08:07.679 align:start position:0%
for drg rate of one was around 3,000
 
02:08:10.669 --> 02:08:10.679 align:start position:0%
it's now what Med was at the time set at
 
02:08:13.430 --> 02:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
Medicare levels which is closer to 9,000
 
02:08:15.709 --> 02:08:15.719 align:start position:0%
something at the
 
02:08:19.109 --> 02:08:19.119 align:start position:0%
time and um uh same patient rates I was
 
02:08:21.990 --> 02:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
referring to yeah so uh
 
02:08:26.270 --> 02:08:26.280 align:start position:0%
um uh is is the combination of these two
 
02:08:29.390 --> 02:08:29.400 align:start position:0%
things uh in your view adequate to keep
 
02:08:33.310 --> 02:08:33.320 align:start position:0%
uh uh hospitals um uh solvent and and
 
02:08:36.189 --> 02:08:36.199 align:start position:0%
whole at this point or we still still
 
02:08:39.790 --> 02:08:39.800 align:start position:0%
kind of uh going through uh uh
 
02:08:42.270 --> 02:08:42.280 align:start position:0%
additional adjustments I can say that
 
02:08:44.709 --> 02:08:44.719 align:start position:0%
the hospitals have testified you know as
 
02:08:47.870 --> 02:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
recently as um earlier this week that
 
02:08:52.510 --> 02:08:52.520 align:start position:0%
they don't feel that the the 80% plan is
 
02:08:55.069 --> 02:08:55.079 align:start position:0%
sufficient and obviously they're doing
 
02:08:57.270 --> 02:08:57.280 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of advocacy work to try to
 
02:09:01.910 --> 02:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:05.069 --> 02:09:05.079 align:start position:0%
um so I do understand you know that that
 
02:09:07.109 --> 02:09:07.119 align:start position:0%
instead of getting a 50% match we're now
 
02:09:09.149 --> 02:09:09.159 align:start position:0%
getting a blended rate the granted
 
02:09:12.310 --> 02:09:12.320 align:start position:0%
Advantage 90% rate and the 50% rate for
 
02:09:14.589 --> 02:09:14.599 align:start position:0%
standard Medicaid managed care what what
 
02:09:19.310 --> 02:09:19.320 align:start position:0%
does that come out to be um it uh it's
 
02:09:22.390 --> 02:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
probably close to 60% and it it varies
 
02:09:25.149 --> 02:09:25.159 align:start position:0%
but there's one other feature here that
 
02:09:28.270 --> 02:09:28.280 align:start position:0%
in addition to higher rates um we've
 
02:09:31.109 --> 02:09:31.119 align:start position:0%
used another concept called directed
 
02:09:33.669 --> 02:09:33.679 align:start position:0%
payments which is effectively paying a
 
02:09:36.310 --> 02:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
higher rate as well but we're allowed
 
02:09:39.910 --> 02:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
particularly um we've converted to this
 
02:09:41.629 --> 02:09:41.639 align:start position:0%
with the critical access hospitals to be
 
02:09:44.549 --> 02:09:44.559 align:start position:0%
able to get them the most that is where
 
02:09:47.109 --> 02:09:47.119 align:start position:0%
we're able to pay them based on an
 
02:09:49.589 --> 02:09:49.599 align:start position:0%
average commercial rate ultimately it's
 
02:09:52.790 --> 02:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
capped at something like that and so um
 
02:09:54.950 --> 02:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
it can go even above Medicare in that
 
02:09:54.960 --> 02:09:56.750 align:start position:0%
it can go even above Medicare in that
instance

02:09:56.750 --> 02:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
instance
 
02:09:58.990 --> 02:09:59.000 align:start position:0%
um great thank
 
02:10:02.470 --> 02:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
02:10:05.390 --> 02:10:05.400 align:start position:0%
walner just because I couldn't
 
02:10:09.750 --> 02:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
follow where where all the uh funds were
 
02:10:14.629 --> 02:10:14.639 align:start position:0%
were going in those in the um 515
 
02:10:17.830 --> 02:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
line can you maybe do a little chart for
 
02:10:20.149 --> 02:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
us at some point that would show us that
 
02:10:22.030 --> 02:10:22.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to find some of these now
 
02:10:25.030 --> 02:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
over in you know adult and wherever
 
02:10:27.990 --> 02:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
wherever they've moved to yes yes we can
 
02:10:30.030 --> 02:10:30.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely do that I I I I think one of
 
02:10:32.149 --> 02:10:32.159 align:start position:0%
the easiest places to start is if you
 
02:10:36.310 --> 02:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
look at on page 890 in accounting unit
 
02:10:39.990 --> 02:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
7943 the5 private local funds so that
 
02:10:42.189 --> 02:10:42.199 align:start position:0%
that's the that's the Met Revenue that's
 
02:10:44.470 --> 02:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
coming in and you'll see you'll see that
 
02:10:47.549 --> 02:10:47.559 align:start position:0%
decrease from 25 adjusted authorized to
 
02:10:52.470 --> 02:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
26 on page 890 and accounting unit 794 3
 
02:10:53.950 --> 02:10:53.960 align:start position:0%
and then if you if you turn the page and
 
02:10:55.629 --> 02:10:55.639 align:start position:0%
you look at uh
 
02:10:58.629 --> 02:10:58.639 align:start position:0%
7948 you you'll see that that increase
 
02:11:01.830 --> 02:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
in met Revenue in the 005 line there
 
02:11:03.149 --> 02:11:03.159 align:start position:0%
where it goes up to
 
02:11:05.830 --> 02:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
283 so so basically I think that you
 
02:11:08.310 --> 02:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
know just quick math it's about 327
 
02:11:10.990 --> 02:11:11.000 align:start position:0%
million okay in in the uh first year of
 
02:11:13.549 --> 02:11:13.559 align:start position:0%
the next bium and we did incre we did
 
02:11:15.589 --> 02:11:15.599 align:start position:0%
include some increases based on the
 
02:11:18.549 --> 02:11:18.559 align:start position:0%
trends that that we've seen year to dat
 
02:11:21.390 --> 02:11:21.400 align:start position:0%
um over the past uh couple of years so
 
02:11:23.030 --> 02:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
great thank you of
 
02:11:26.109 --> 02:11:26.119 align:start position:0%
course representative priest for
 
02:11:30.109 --> 02:11:30.119 align:start position:0%
question yes just as a a again a
 
02:11:33.629 --> 02:11:33.639 align:start position:0%
clarification on uh again on page
 
02:11:37.310 --> 02:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
891 on the uncompensated care
 
02:11:40.149 --> 02:11:40.159 align:start position:0%
fund um you mentioned that there are
 
02:11:44.310 --> 02:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
transfers out of that fund into other
 
02:11:46.390 --> 02:11:46.400 align:start position:0%
line items or other
 
02:11:49.709 --> 02:11:49.719 align:start position:0%
departments but I don't see
 
02:11:53.069 --> 02:11:53.079 align:start position:0%
any transf ER of funds to other fund
 
02:11:57.270 --> 02:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
agencies that I've seen in other um
 
02:12:01.350 --> 02:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
programs like Medicaid at
 
02:12:03.350 --> 02:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
Administration and again I just would
 
02:12:05.350 --> 02:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
like to know where these funds are going
 
02:12:05.360 --> 02:12:08.189 align:start position:0%
like to know where these funds are going
to

02:12:08.189 --> 02:12:08.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:12:11.430 --> 02:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
02:12:15.750 --> 02:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
well I I think we can simply I think the
 
02:12:17.910 --> 02:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
suggestion of a chart we can we can give
 
02:12:20.109 --> 02:12:20.119 align:start position:0%
you a sort of a calculation of where
 
02:12:21.510 --> 02:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
what types of funds are being used and
 
02:12:23.229 --> 02:12:23.239 align:start position:0%
where they're where they're going that
 
02:12:24.910 --> 02:12:24.920 align:start position:0%
would probably rather than explaining it
 
02:12:26.310 --> 02:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
in words and pointing to this line and
 
02:12:28.990 --> 02:12:29.000 align:start position:0%
that line um I think the picture will
 
02:12:30.830 --> 02:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
worth a thousand words in this instance
 
02:12:32.310 --> 02:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
and and and just to clarify
 
02:12:34.069 --> 02:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
representative priest are you referring
 
02:12:38.109 --> 02:12:38.119 align:start position:0%
to accounting unit 7948 the 001 transfer
 
02:12:45.229 --> 02:12:45.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:49.910 --> 02:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
agencies um I'm referring to on page 889
 
02:12:49.920 --> 02:12:51.669 align:start position:0%
agencies um I'm referring to on page 889
item

02:12:51.669 --> 02:12:51.679 align:start position:0%
item
 
02:12:51.679 --> 02:12:53.830 align:start position:0%
item
um

02:12:53.830 --> 02:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:56.870 --> 02:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
049 that's the um trans and then on and
 
02:13:00.470 --> 02:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
then comparing that to the
 
02:13:02.709 --> 02:13:02.719 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care fund where you
 
02:13:05.390 --> 02:13:05.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned that the reason why there is
 
02:13:07.109 --> 02:13:07.119 align:start position:0%
such large
 
02:13:13.069 --> 02:13:13.079 align:start position:0%
differences of funds from 2024 2025 to
 
02:13:15.870 --> 02:13:15.880 align:start position:0%
2026 is because those funds are being
 
02:13:19.069 --> 02:13:19.079 align:start position:0%
transferred to other departments sure so
 
02:13:20.830 --> 02:13:20.840 align:start position:0%
I I I think I think what we can do is we
 
02:13:22.549 --> 02:13:22.559 align:start position:0%
can put put together a chart those are
 
02:13:25.310 --> 02:13:25.320 align:start position:0%
two separate issues though in one case
 
02:13:28.390 --> 02:13:28.400 align:start position:0%
it's just a TR so in one case um in the
 
02:13:30.870 --> 02:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
first instance where we have the money
 
02:13:32.790 --> 02:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
that's going to New Hampshire hospital
 
02:13:34.750 --> 02:13:34.760 align:start position:0%
that's just showing in the budget we're
 
02:13:36.790 --> 02:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
going to move that four or so million
 
02:13:38.470 --> 02:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
dollars in a New Hampshire hospital when
 
02:13:39.790 --> 02:13:39.800 align:start position:0%
we present on New Hampshire hospital
 
02:13:41.109 --> 02:13:41.119 align:start position:0%
you're going to see that Revenue coming
 
02:13:43.350 --> 02:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
into their budget and the corresponding
 
02:13:46.270 --> 02:13:46.280 align:start position:0%
expenses what we're talking about within
 
02:13:47.430 --> 02:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:13:54.030 --> 02:13:54.040 align:start position:0%
7948 and uh and the um 79 sorry 7943 and
 
02:13:56.430 --> 02:13:56.440 align:start position:0%
7948 what we're doing is we're actually
 
02:13:58.270 --> 02:13:58.280 align:start position:0%
changing the way that we're budgeting
 
02:14:01.589 --> 02:14:01.599 align:start position:0%
between year between Bania so in one in
 
02:14:03.790 --> 02:14:03.800 align:start position:0%
the first Bania you're going to see more
 
02:14:07.310 --> 02:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
of the Met revenue and um in in the
 
02:14:08.750 --> 02:14:08.760 align:start position:0%
first account and then you're going to
 
02:14:11.189 --> 02:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
see it in the first year and then you're
 
02:14:13.950 --> 02:14:13.960 align:start position:0%
going to see a much higher amount in
 
02:14:17.350 --> 02:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
7948 in the second year because the way
 
02:14:19.470 --> 02:14:19.480 align:start position:0%
we've crafted the budget is reporting
 
02:14:21.549 --> 02:14:21.559 align:start position:0%
more of those dollars into the Co
 
02:14:23.270 --> 02:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
payments and the directed and into the
 
02:14:25.390 --> 02:14:25.400 align:start position:0%
rates and directed payments and but we
 
02:14:26.950 --> 02:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
can we can provide a chart to help
 
02:14:28.229 --> 02:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
explain some of this because it's not
 
02:14:30.589 --> 02:14:30.599 align:start position:0%
easy to follow given this document
 
02:14:33.030 --> 02:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
because we're all over the place here so
 
02:14:35.830 --> 02:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
thank you so so I would add to what
 
02:14:38.069 --> 02:14:38.079 align:start position:0%
Nathan was saying what is on the line
 
02:14:41.310 --> 02:14:41.320 align:start position:0%
that you pointed out that those funds
 
02:14:43.270 --> 02:14:43.280 align:start position:0%
don't come from the Medicaid enhancement
 
02:14:43.280 --> 02:14:44.350 align:start position:0%
don't come from the Medicaid enhancement
tax

02:14:44.350 --> 02:14:44.360 align:start position:0%
tax
 
02:14:47.229 --> 02:14:47.239 align:start position:0%
match State facilities get their
 
02:14:50.030 --> 02:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
uncompensated Care on different basis
 
02:14:52.189 --> 02:14:52.199 align:start position:0%
and so it doesn't doesn't touch that at
 
02:14:54.750 --> 02:14:54.760 align:start position:0%
all okay thank you one one important
 
02:14:57.990 --> 02:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
point for the you know in addition to
 
02:15:00.589 --> 02:15:00.599 align:start position:0%
the kind of trying to get a better
 
02:15:02.350 --> 02:15:02.360 align:start position:0%
Federal match where it's available
 
02:15:06.510 --> 02:15:06.520 align:start position:0%
there's another big um macro issue I
 
02:15:09.510 --> 02:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
would point out going on here in
 
02:15:15.270 --> 02:15:15.280 align:start position:0%
2023 Congress um federally passed a law
 
02:15:19.430 --> 02:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
that um the amount the allocation to
 
02:15:22.589 --> 02:15:22.599 align:start position:0%
states of uncompensated care called dish
 
02:15:24.430 --> 02:15:24.440 align:start position:0%
were was going to be
 
02:15:27.870 --> 02:15:27.880 align:start position:0%
reduced and um we're all following
 
02:15:30.390 --> 02:15:30.400 align:start position:0%
what's going on now with Congress about
 
02:15:31.709 --> 02:15:31.719 align:start position:0%
the continuing
 
02:15:34.870 --> 02:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
resolution absent um addressing this
 
02:15:36.669 --> 02:15:36.679 align:start position:0%
issue in the continuing resolution New
 
02:15:36.679 --> 02:15:38.229 align:start position:0%
issue in the continuing resolution New
Hampshire's

02:15:38.229 --> 02:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's
 
02:15:41.350 --> 02:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
allocation for uncompensated care and by
 
02:15:43.549 --> 02:15:43.559 align:start position:0%
the way New Hampshire has of all the
 
02:15:45.750 --> 02:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
states in the country has used more of
 
02:15:48.390 --> 02:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
the dish program than any other state as
 
02:15:48.400 --> 02:15:49.430 align:start position:0%
the dish program than any other state as
a

02:15:49.430 --> 02:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:15:53.229 --> 02:15:53.239 align:start position:0%
percentage we would go from over $200
 
02:15:56.430 --> 02:15:56.440 align:start position:0%
million uh allowance for being able to
 
02:15:59.109 --> 02:15:59.119 align:start position:0%
draw to under 100 million so we would
 
02:16:01.990 --> 02:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
see a drop going from 200 and something
 
02:16:07.069 --> 02:16:07.079 align:start position:0%
million to I think 92 million total so
 
02:16:09.030 --> 02:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
part of the reason we're migrating out
 
02:16:12.109 --> 02:16:12.119 align:start position:0%
of the pure uncompensated care is
 
02:16:15.350 --> 02:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
because the program will be The uncomp
 
02:16:16.910 --> 02:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
CARE program the dish program is going
 
02:16:20.950 --> 02:16:20.960 align:start position:0%
to be eventually um by federal law is
 
02:16:23.629 --> 02:16:23.639 align:start position:0%
going to be shrunk in size and to to be
 
02:16:25.790 --> 02:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
able to support the level of funding we
 
02:16:30.310 --> 02:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
have is not just a exercise of trying to
 
02:16:32.309 --> 02:16:32.319 align:start position:0%
operate within the parameters of what
 
02:16:34.629 --> 02:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
the law is today but where it's going
 
02:16:36.230 --> 02:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
and I think the hospitals in the state
 
02:16:39.309 --> 02:16:39.319 align:start position:0%
are aligned to a to a large degree that
 
02:16:41.750 --> 02:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
we do need to make this migration
 
02:16:44.870 --> 02:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
because that aspect you know if it
 
02:16:46.750 --> 02:16:46.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen this year like other
 
02:16:48.629 --> 02:16:48.639 align:start position:0%
things sometimes Congress continues to
 
02:16:51.629 --> 02:16:51.639 align:start position:0%
delay but eventually um there's a big
 
02:16:53.030 --> 02:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
risk in terms of the amount of money
 
02:16:55.270 --> 02:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
that would be available uh drawing in
 
02:16:55.280 --> 02:16:59.429 align:start position:0%
that would be available uh drawing in
traditional

02:16:59.429 --> 02:16:59.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:01.830 --> 02:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
ways okay
 
02:17:05.629 --> 02:17:05.639 align:start position:0%
um ready for one more um
 
02:17:09.589 --> 02:17:09.599 align:start position:0%
7948 uh which is on page
 
02:17:09.599 --> 02:17:13.190 align:start position:0%
7948 uh which is on page
891

02:17:13.190 --> 02:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:15.629 --> 02:17:15.639 align:start position:0%
right right page
 
02:17:18.429 --> 02:17:18.439 align:start position:0%
891 Governor's
 
02:17:21.950 --> 02:17:21.960 align:start position:0%
budget so this is the biggest account
 
02:17:24.270 --> 02:17:24.280 align:start position:0%
Medicaid this is where we're paying our
 
02:17:29.509 --> 02:17:29.519 align:start position:0%
our manag care um uh rates which then
 
02:17:32.910 --> 02:17:32.920 align:start position:0%
you know um just so you know about a
 
02:17:35.709 --> 02:17:35.719 align:start position:0%
little over 90% of the rate that we pay
 
02:17:37.309 --> 02:17:37.319 align:start position:0%
to the managed care companies intended
 
02:17:40.349 --> 02:17:40.359 align:start position:0%
to pay providers so it's it's like n in
 
02:17:42.549 --> 02:17:42.559 align:start position:0%
the current Managed Care contract it's
 
02:17:42.559 --> 02:17:44.349 align:start position:0%
the current Managed Care contract it's
about

02:17:44.349 --> 02:17:44.359 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:17:47.709 --> 02:17:47.719 align:start position:0%
90.2% on a blended basis of the dollars
 
02:17:49.750 --> 02:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
that go to them as an insurance premium
 
02:17:52.910 --> 02:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
if you will capitation rate rate 90% is
 
02:17:56.110 --> 02:17:56.120 align:start position:0%
is uh the target amount to pay out to to
 
02:18:01.030 --> 02:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
to Providers and that's that 101 line um
 
02:18:04.709 --> 02:18:04.719 align:start position:0%
the 535 line and the 563
 
02:18:10.230 --> 02:18:10.240 align:start position:0%
line um represent um support to uh uh
 
02:18:13.270 --> 02:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
where Medicaid is allowed um and I call
 
02:18:15.270 --> 02:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
it braided funding I think that's what
 
02:18:16.790 --> 02:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
others would call it too where we're
 
02:18:20.309 --> 02:18:20.319 align:start position:0%
using a combination of um different
 
02:18:23.790 --> 02:18:23.800 align:start position:0%
types of Federal funding to support um
 
02:18:27.150 --> 02:18:27.160 align:start position:0%
DCF and other Justice involved children
 
02:18:29.509 --> 02:18:29.519 align:start position:0%
which which is a practice that's evolved
 
02:18:32.830 --> 02:18:32.840 align:start position:0%
over time to help um uh capture the
 
02:18:34.230 --> 02:18:34.240 align:start position:0%
federal dollars that the state is
 
02:18:37.230 --> 02:18:37.240 align:start position:0%
entitled to um programmatically to
 
02:18:41.389 --> 02:18:41.399 align:start position:0%
support um cases in and that either need
 
02:18:44.509 --> 02:18:44.519 align:start position:0%
to be placed you know um out of state or
 
02:18:46.990 --> 02:18:47.000 align:start position:0%
placed in the community it's it's
 
02:18:49.549 --> 02:18:49.559 align:start position:0%
combining the 4E funding typically and
 
02:18:53.349 --> 02:18:53.359 align:start position:0%
the the Medicare paid funding to to uh
 
02:18:55.910 --> 02:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
you know provide the services and reduce
 
02:18:59.709 --> 02:18:59.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:03.669 --> 02:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
taxpayers um you see a an increase there
 
02:19:05.990 --> 02:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
and a and a reduction um I don't know if
 
02:19:09.469 --> 02:19:09.479 align:start position:0%
you want to speak to that Nathan on the
 
02:19:12.950 --> 02:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
535 sure the the um the out of home
 
02:19:15.629 --> 02:19:15.639 align:start position:0%
placements line um you you will see a
 
02:19:17.750 --> 02:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
reduction there um what what we have
 
02:19:20.910 --> 02:19:20.920 align:start position:0%
seen in this bium is uh we we are
 
02:19:22.509 --> 02:19:22.519 align:start position:0%
addressing some of the rule changes at
 
02:19:24.709 --> 02:19:24.719 align:start position:0%
the federal level relative to Medicaid
 
02:19:27.389 --> 02:19:27.399 align:start position:0%
funds that we're able to claim um for
 
02:19:30.830 --> 02:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
certain facilities uh over 16 beds that
 
02:19:33.429 --> 02:19:33.439 align:start position:0%
provide um certain Services were no
 
02:19:35.790 --> 02:19:35.800 align:start position:0%
longer able to claim Medicaid dollars so
 
02:19:37.790 --> 02:19:37.800 align:start position:0%
you will see a reduction there the
 
02:19:39.830 --> 02:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
department did include a prioritized
 
02:19:42.270 --> 02:19:42.280 align:start position:0%
needs request to support the general
 
02:19:44.509 --> 02:19:44.519 align:start position:0%
fund portion based on the projections
 
02:19:45.950 --> 02:19:45.960 align:start position:0%
that we're seeing for the loss of
 
02:19:48.670 --> 02:19:48.680 align:start position:0%
Medicaid dollars um and and we're going
 
02:19:50.710 --> 02:19:50.720 align:start position:0%
to discuss that later at for the
 
02:19:51.990 --> 02:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
division for Behavioral Health as well
 
02:19:53.710 --> 02:19:53.720 align:start position:0%
as the division for children youth and
 
02:19:56.670 --> 02:19:56.680 align:start position:0%
families uh next week when Marine Nunan
 
02:19:57.950 --> 02:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
comes in we'll be talking about that
 
02:20:00.990 --> 02:20:01.000 align:start position:0%
prioritized need and this specific issue
 
02:20:03.190 --> 02:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
um but that program is actually funded
 
02:20:05.150 --> 02:20:05.160 align:start position:0%
out of three separate accounting units
 
02:20:06.950 --> 02:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
in Medicaid division for Behavior or
 
02:20:08.870 --> 02:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
that division for Behavioral Health and
 
02:20:11.389 --> 02:20:11.399 align:start position:0%
division for children for Youth and
 
02:20:13.110 --> 02:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
families and it's really depend one of
 
02:20:14.670 --> 02:20:14.680 align:start position:0%
the challenges there it's really
 
02:20:16.630 --> 02:20:16.640 align:start position:0%
dependent upon the specific needs and
 
02:20:19.030 --> 02:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
and what the individual child or youth
 
02:20:21.910 --> 02:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
qualifies for so as and Henry could was
 
02:20:24.190 --> 02:20:24.200 align:start position:0%
saying might be Medicaid it might be
 
02:20:27.710 --> 02:20:27.720 align:start position:0%
tanif it might be for um or it might be
 
02:20:30.510 --> 02:20:30.520 align:start position:0%
100% General funds it it it's difficult
 
02:20:33.710 --> 02:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
to predict but um that's that we entered
 
02:20:35.309 --> 02:20:35.319 align:start position:0%
into contracts for the first time about
 
02:20:38.750 --> 02:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
three or four years ago and uh this this
 
02:20:40.990 --> 02:20:41.000 align:start position:0%
change this downward uh reduction here
 
02:20:42.510 --> 02:20:42.520 align:start position:0%
is to account for some of the changes
 
02:20:44.710 --> 02:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
that we've seen so representative
 
02:20:47.870 --> 02:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
Stringham for a question uh just a
 
02:20:50.150 --> 02:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
clarification on the contracts are we at
 
02:20:54.070 --> 02:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
risk for services over um running AB
 
02:20:58.429 --> 02:20:58.439 align:start position:0%
above the um contracted amount uh and if
 
02:21:01.429 --> 02:21:01.439 align:start position:0%
it goes under are they Li is are the
 
02:21:03.349 --> 02:21:03.359 align:start position:0%
Managed Care contracts limited to a
 
02:21:06.670 --> 02:21:06.680 align:start position:0%
certain uh gross profit
 
02:21:09.590 --> 02:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
margin I guess the answer is yes and yes
 
02:21:13.830 --> 02:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
but let me explain um so we have um
 
02:21:16.389 --> 02:21:16.399 align:start position:0%
similar to The Dental contract we have a
 
02:21:18.590 --> 02:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
minimum medical loss ratio actually in
 
02:21:21.150 --> 02:21:21.160 align:start position:0%
statute it's uh 85%
 
02:21:23.309 --> 02:21:23.319 align:start position:0%
I think federally and and and we
 
02:21:25.590 --> 02:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
actually have a a tighter one than that
 
02:21:27.590 --> 02:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
we've through the pandemic there was a
 
02:21:31.309 --> 02:21:31.319 align:start position:0%
lot of expectation of how high costs
 
02:21:35.150 --> 02:21:35.160 align:start position:0%
would be or not and um so we had on top
 
02:21:36.790 --> 02:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
of that a risk
 
02:21:40.150 --> 02:21:40.160 align:start position:0%
hoor today the targeted medical loss
 
02:21:43.309 --> 02:21:43.319 align:start position:0%
ratio provides for a one and a
 
02:21:47.590 --> 02:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
half% um margin um the most it can be
 
02:21:50.349 --> 02:21:50.359 align:start position:0%
above that based on the current contract
 
02:21:52.910 --> 02:21:52.920 align:start position:0%
um and that can evolve over time as the
 
02:21:55.349 --> 02:21:55.359 align:start position:0%
risk becomes more stable but as as it's
 
02:21:57.830 --> 02:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
existed over the past few years and and
 
02:21:59.990 --> 02:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
in this current year
 
02:22:03.389 --> 02:22:03.399 align:start position:0%
um the uh the additional profit
 
02:22:05.349 --> 02:22:05.359 align:start position:0%
potential is up to another two and a
 
02:22:08.990 --> 02:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
half% so 4% would be the maximum that an
 
02:22:13.349 --> 02:22:13.359 align:start position:0%
MCO could earn um under this contract um
 
02:22:14.870 --> 02:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
02:22:17.710 --> 02:22:17.720 align:start position:0%
7.7% Administration
 
02:22:21.469 --> 02:22:21.479 align:start position:0%
allowance um both of those are are tight
 
02:22:24.309 --> 02:22:24.319 align:start position:0%
um to what you would find out there you
 
02:22:27.670 --> 02:22:27.680 align:start position:0%
know New Hampshire prices um you know
 
02:22:30.830 --> 02:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
pretty aggressively but solidly in you
 
02:22:32.790 --> 02:22:32.800 align:start position:0%
know when we've had the uh our
 
02:22:36.670 --> 02:22:36.680 align:start position:0%
consultants and looking at um you know
 
02:22:38.270 --> 02:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
for for all the times that we've had
 
02:22:41.630 --> 02:22:41.640 align:start position:0%
these risk cars the state at least three
 
02:22:43.750 --> 02:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
out of four times has benefited and has
 
02:22:46.110 --> 02:22:46.120 align:start position:0%
benefited more um there may be a period
 
02:22:48.950 --> 02:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
where we don't benefit but we there's a
 
02:22:50.750 --> 02:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
lot of unknowns and where there are
 
02:22:54.830 --> 02:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
known um we try to balance that risk um
 
02:22:58.270 --> 02:22:58.280 align:start position:0%
um between us um and we also follow you
 
02:23:01.990 --> 02:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
know we we talk to the federal actuaries
 
02:23:04.510 --> 02:23:04.520 align:start position:0%
because our actuaries do the work then
 
02:23:06.510 --> 02:23:06.520 align:start position:0%
the federal actuaries do their review
 
02:23:09.510 --> 02:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
over the their work so it's a highly
 
02:23:13.309 --> 02:23:13.319 align:start position:0%
scrutinized area um and uh you know I
 
02:23:16.110 --> 02:23:16.120 align:start position:0%
think that uh it's pretty it's pretty
 
02:23:19.190 --> 02:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
lean um we have uh we have a price
 
02:23:22.110 --> 02:23:22.120 align:start position:0%
limitation and and then a budget and
 
02:23:24.150 --> 02:23:24.160 align:start position:0%
we've in all periods we've been able to
 
02:23:26.469 --> 02:23:26.479 align:start position:0%
stay within our our budget but not with
 
02:23:29.510 --> 02:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
a very large margin
 
02:23:32.630 --> 02:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
forever representative Neno for a
 
02:23:39.150 --> 02:23:39.160 align:start position:0%
question yeah I just uh Wonder so the um
 
02:23:43.670 --> 02:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
shift to a different uh model uh I I
 
02:23:46.269 --> 02:23:46.279 align:start position:0%
wonder what you think the that's an
 
02:23:49.150 --> 02:23:49.160 align:start position:0%
ongoing process I assume so you're
 
02:23:52.150 --> 02:23:52.160 align:start position:0%
you're you know incrementally doing that
 
02:23:55.030 --> 02:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
as you go through the bium so I just
 
02:23:57.429 --> 02:23:57.439 align:start position:0%
wonder what your sense of what the
 
02:23:59.830 --> 02:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
additional upside
 
02:24:02.710 --> 02:24:02.720 align:start position:0%
potential uh exists
 
02:24:06.070 --> 02:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
for optimization if you
 
02:24:11.309 --> 02:24:11.319 align:start position:0%
will so I think we we we see for all the
 
02:24:12.870 --> 02:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
years that we've been doing this and and
 
02:24:14.790 --> 02:24:14.800 align:start position:0%
every year going forward I think there's
 
02:24:18.030 --> 02:24:18.040 align:start position:0%
always room to improve what we're doing
 
02:24:21.309 --> 02:24:21.319 align:start position:0%
um the the areas we're focusing on in
 
02:24:23.429 --> 02:24:23.439 align:start position:0%
this contract were the big the big
 
02:24:26.190 --> 02:24:26.200 align:start position:0%
movers we had the the prescription drugs
 
02:24:28.830 --> 02:24:28.840 align:start position:0%
and and the the gene therapies trying to
 
02:24:30.710 --> 02:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
deal with that differently but on top of
 
02:24:32.750 --> 02:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
that on top of trying to do better in
 
02:24:35.309 --> 02:24:35.319 align:start position:0%
rebates we're also trying to do more
 
02:24:38.670 --> 02:24:38.680 align:start position:0%
with what we call poly Pharmacy which is
 
02:24:42.230 --> 02:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
when someone's on a lot of drugs and you
 
02:24:44.070 --> 02:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
know if you've have family members or
 
02:24:46.469 --> 02:24:46.479 align:start position:0%
particularly older members that
 
02:24:48.550 --> 02:24:48.560 align:start position:0%
sometimes different doctors are
 
02:24:50.830 --> 02:24:50.840 align:start position:0%
prescribing um medications and one
 
02:24:52.389 --> 02:24:52.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't know what the other is and you
 
02:24:55.349 --> 02:24:55.359 align:start position:0%
can see someone on you know 30 drugs I'm
 
02:24:58.349 --> 02:24:58.359 align:start position:0%
not exaggerating in that point but that
 
02:24:59.630 --> 02:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
what we're what we're trying to do in
 
02:25:02.190 --> 02:25:02.200 align:start position:0%
this program is to strengthen the
 
02:25:04.710 --> 02:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
identification of those cases the review
 
02:25:08.670 --> 02:25:08.680 align:start position:0%
of those cases and using the the New
 
02:25:11.670 --> 02:25:11.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire doctors to be more involved in
 
02:25:14.349 --> 02:25:14.359 align:start position:0%
trying to make therapeutic changes where
 
02:25:16.790 --> 02:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
there may be um what we describe as
 
02:25:19.190 --> 02:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
iatrogenic disease caused by the by the
 
02:25:20.550 --> 02:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
care that you're delivering is to make
 
02:25:23.389 --> 02:25:23.399 align:start position:0%
sure that we're not doing that so that'
 
02:25:26.590 --> 02:25:26.600 align:start position:0%
be an area that um you know buying the
 
02:25:28.309 --> 02:25:28.319 align:start position:0%
drugs at the at a good price is one
 
02:25:30.790 --> 02:25:30.800 align:start position:0%
thing utilizing the drugs
 
02:25:32.950 --> 02:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
clinically appropriately is the other
 
02:25:34.830 --> 02:25:34.840 align:start position:0%
half of it and so we're working both
 
02:25:37.070 --> 02:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
sides of it and we're leveraging what
 
02:25:39.790 --> 02:25:39.800 align:start position:0%
the mcos can do and leveraging what our
 
02:25:42.790 --> 02:25:42.800 align:start position:0%
uh Physicians and providers can do and
 
02:25:46.550 --> 02:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
that's an area that we have retooled in
 
02:25:49.790 --> 02:25:49.800 align:start position:0%
this part of the um this most recent
 
02:25:49.800 --> 02:25:51.510 align:start position:0%
this part of the um this most recent
procurement

02:25:51.510 --> 02:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
procurement
 
02:25:54.710 --> 02:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
um so that that you know is is a very
 
02:25:56.670 --> 02:25:56.680 align:start position:0%
large percentage of our our budget as I
 
02:25:59.750 --> 02:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
said um you know it's 30 it's going to
 
02:26:01.510 --> 02:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
probably be by the end of next year
 
02:26:04.389 --> 02:26:04.399 align:start position:0%
probably a third of what we we spend
 
02:26:06.790 --> 02:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
then we've also focused on um
 
02:26:09.670 --> 02:26:09.680 align:start position:0%
preventative Services and strengthening
 
02:26:13.830 --> 02:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
the the funds that go to local doctors
 
02:26:16.750 --> 02:26:16.760 align:start position:0%
for doing more um in the care
 
02:26:18.710 --> 02:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
coordination and preventive Services
 
02:26:20.750 --> 02:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
because when you look at the L there are
 
02:26:24.230 --> 02:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
a lot of things that save money but the
 
02:26:26.190 --> 02:26:26.200 align:start position:0%
a lot of them are kind of ephimeral if
 
02:26:28.630 --> 02:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
you will and the ones that do seem to
 
02:26:30.070 --> 02:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
save the money of the preventative
 
02:26:32.269 --> 02:26:32.279 align:start position:0%
Services and so we're putting more
 
02:26:35.110 --> 02:26:35.120 align:start position:0%
emphasis on prevention and an authentic
 
02:26:37.429 --> 02:26:37.439 align:start position:0%
relationship between the patient and the
 
02:26:40.950 --> 02:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
provider we're we are
 
02:26:43.710 --> 02:26:43.720 align:start position:0%
um we don't want just a name on a piece
 
02:26:45.429 --> 02:26:45.439 align:start position:0%
of paper that that's your doc we want
 
02:26:48.469 --> 02:26:48.479 align:start position:0%
them to be actually being seen and
 
02:26:52.510 --> 02:26:52.520 align:start position:0%
evaluated um and um we'll be we've also
 
02:26:55.990 --> 02:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
in the 2.0 procurement and the 3.0
 
02:26:58.309 --> 02:26:58.319 align:start position:0%
procurement we've had
 
02:27:01.590 --> 02:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
um uh what we call remedies where there
 
02:27:03.349 --> 02:27:03.359 align:start position:0%
if there's a lack of performance we can
 
02:27:05.950 --> 02:27:05.960 align:start position:0%
apply Financial penalties um to make
 
02:27:07.830 --> 02:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
sure that we're getting the value out of
 
02:27:11.230 --> 02:27:11.240 align:start position:0%
it and you know that that that seems to
 
02:27:13.750 --> 02:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
be make the program stronger in terms of
 
02:27:16.269 --> 02:27:16.279 align:start position:0%
holding the insurance companies you know
 
02:27:18.349 --> 02:27:18.359 align:start position:0%
um to the standards that they've signed
 
02:27:21.190 --> 02:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
a contract for so we're continually
 
02:27:22.950 --> 02:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
working on different areas another area
 
02:27:25.710 --> 02:27:25.720 align:start position:0%
that um we're working on is
 
02:27:28.190 --> 02:27:28.200 align:start position:0%
strengthening uh third party liabilities
 
02:27:32.150 --> 02:27:32.160 align:start position:0%
coordination of benefits subreg uh Co um
 
02:27:33.750 --> 02:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
coordination benefits I said uh third
 
02:27:36.190 --> 02:27:36.200 align:start position:0%
party liability strengthening those
 
02:27:38.110 --> 02:27:38.120 align:start position:0%
where Medicaid shouldn't be the primary
 
02:27:40.230 --> 02:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
pay like if you think about workers comp
 
02:27:41.710 --> 02:27:41.720 align:start position:0%
you know sometimes it should be medical
 
02:27:43.469 --> 02:27:43.479 align:start position:0%
and sometimes it should be workers comp
 
02:27:45.550 --> 02:27:45.560 align:start position:0%
it's making sure when Medicaid is the
 
02:27:47.790 --> 02:27:47.800 align:start position:0%
payer it is the correct payer and the
 
02:27:49.750 --> 02:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
correct order of payer so those are
 
02:27:52.230 --> 02:27:52.240 align:start position:0%
things that we're doing um and we're
 
02:27:54.190 --> 02:27:54.200 align:start position:0%
trying to strengthen what the the
 
02:27:56.590 --> 02:27:56.600 align:start position:0%
department offers there and I could go
 
02:27:59.349 --> 02:27:59.359 align:start position:0%
on for more time than we want to talk
 
02:28:00.950 --> 02:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
about all the little areas that we're
 
02:28:03.670 --> 02:28:03.680 align:start position:0%
you know tweaking all the time but um
 
02:28:04.830 --> 02:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
you know the only way we're going to
 
02:28:07.070 --> 02:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
make it work in terms of the budget
 
02:28:09.550 --> 02:28:09.560 align:start position:0%
that's available to us is to is to
 
02:28:11.710 --> 02:28:11.720 align:start position:0%
continue to try to move the needle on
 
02:28:13.630 --> 02:28:13.640 align:start position:0%
number of things lead testing is another
 
02:28:15.349 --> 02:28:15.359 align:start position:0%
one you know there's been lead testing
 
02:28:17.790 --> 02:28:17.800 align:start position:0%
in the news we've now working with
 
02:28:20.670 --> 02:28:20.680 align:start position:0%
public health and with the m cosos and
 
02:28:23.870 --> 02:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
have Financial penalties and um rewards
 
02:28:26.269 --> 02:28:26.279 align:start position:0%
for getting to a better level of lead
 
02:28:29.750 --> 02:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
testing and you know Dr ballad um was
 
02:28:31.150 --> 02:28:31.160 align:start position:0%
our medical director was on the news
 
02:28:32.830 --> 02:28:32.840 align:start position:0%
talking about how our rates of testing
 
02:28:35.590 --> 02:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
have have started to recover after the
 
02:28:38.790 --> 02:28:38.800 align:start position:0%
pandemic um
 
02:28:43.550 --> 02:28:43.560 align:start position:0%
so if I may just a quick followup so I
 
02:28:45.750 --> 02:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
assume you're leaning a lot on it
 
02:28:49.429 --> 02:28:49.439 align:start position:0%
services to to manage some of these
 
02:28:54.190 --> 02:28:54.200 align:start position:0%
complex uh uh as you said uh this really
 
02:28:54.200 --> 02:28:55.230 align:start position:0%
complex uh uh as you said uh this really
M

02:28:55.230 --> 02:28:55.240 align:start position:0%
M
 
02:29:00.429 --> 02:29:00.439 align:start position:0%
multi uh Factor equations and one of the
 
02:29:02.389 --> 02:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
questions that I think chairman uh
 
02:29:05.070 --> 02:29:05.080 align:start position:0%
Edwards had asked in a previous session
 
02:29:09.269 --> 02:29:09.279 align:start position:0%
with the IT people was you know is there
 
02:29:13.790 --> 02:29:13.800 align:start position:0%
anything that U needs to be done to to
 
02:29:13.800 --> 02:29:14.710 align:start position:0%
anything that U needs to be done to to
kind

02:29:14.710 --> 02:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
kind
 
02:29:19.070 --> 02:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
of supplement the services or and then
 
02:29:22.230 --> 02:29:22.240 align:start position:0%
in turn get a on that investment in the
 
02:29:24.469 --> 02:29:24.479 align:start position:0%
whole area that you're talking about so
 
02:29:25.950 --> 02:29:25.960 align:start position:0%
third party liability that I was
 
02:29:28.269 --> 02:29:28.279 align:start position:0%
speaking to is one of those areas where
 
02:29:31.510 --> 02:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
we're taking a step in this budget um is
 
02:29:33.870 --> 02:29:33.880 align:start position:0%
included for us to do what we call data
 
02:29:36.230 --> 02:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
matching and then to take it further in
 
02:29:39.670 --> 02:29:39.680 align:start position:0%
a future Capital request um to to be
 
02:29:42.030 --> 02:29:42.040 align:start position:0%
able to do even more than what what the
 
02:29:44.190 --> 02:29:44.200 align:start position:0%
that level of uh service would allow us
 
02:29:46.710 --> 02:29:46.720 align:start position:0%
to do I mean it sounds to me like a an
 
02:29:49.510 --> 02:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
area where AI would would be a
 
02:29:51.870 --> 02:29:51.880 align:start position:0%
significant benefit in in pulling all
 
02:29:54.030 --> 02:29:54.040 align:start position:0%
that together but that's just an opinion
 
02:29:57.790 --> 02:29:57.800 align:start position:0%
yeah no I mean AI is being used more in
 
02:30:00.230 --> 02:30:00.240 align:start position:0%
and Technology one of the issues and the
 
02:30:02.630 --> 02:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
challenges in Medicaid for for vendors
 
02:30:04.670 --> 02:30:04.680 align:start position:0%
is when you've seen one Medicaid Program
 
02:30:06.870 --> 02:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
you've seen one Medicaid Program so you
 
02:30:10.030 --> 02:30:10.040 align:start position:0%
know it's not like taking um software
 
02:30:11.389 --> 02:30:11.399 align:start position:0%
off the shelf and saying I can use it in
 
02:30:13.990 --> 02:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
all 50 states and the six territories
 
02:30:16.269 --> 02:30:16.279 align:start position:0%
it's it's the customization to states
 
02:30:17.870 --> 02:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
that make some of this more expensive
 
02:30:19.790 --> 02:30:19.800 align:start position:0%
than you would hope but we do we do have
 
02:30:23.349 --> 02:30:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:27.389 --> 02:30:27.399 align:start position:0%
presentation okay you may proceed okay
 
02:30:31.190 --> 02:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
um I think um actually the last one is
 
02:30:37.110 --> 02:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
the is uh Medicaid information system we
 
02:30:42.429 --> 02:30:42.439 align:start position:0%
see here is on 892
 
02:30:44.590 --> 02:30:44.600 align:start position:0%
um one of the things I'll say
 
02:30:47.750 --> 02:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
conceptually about this area is that you
 
02:30:50.630 --> 02:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
know our Medicaid
 
02:30:55.389 --> 02:30:55.399 align:start position:0%
um and it's 8009 is the is the U account
 
02:30:57.670 --> 02:30:57.680 align:start position:0%
number Medicaid management information
 
02:30:59.990 --> 02:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
system we're actually talking you hear
 
02:31:01.990 --> 02:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
the term mmis which has been our
 
02:31:03.910 --> 02:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
historical term and then you'll also
 
02:31:07.110 --> 02:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
hear the term Medicaid enterprise system
 
02:31:11.750 --> 02:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
Mees and that reflects um sort of a a
 
02:31:14.230 --> 02:31:14.240 align:start position:0%
movement to rather than buying one
 
02:31:16.389 --> 02:31:16.399 align:start position:0%
system to address all your needs is to
 
02:31:19.150 --> 02:31:19.160 align:start position:0%
be able to have some modularity to be
 
02:31:20.630 --> 02:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
able to
 
02:31:22.750 --> 02:31:22.760 align:start position:0%
have more competition in terms of the
 
02:31:25.950 --> 02:31:25.960 align:start position:0%
the the applications that you have and
 
02:31:28.830 --> 02:31:28.840 align:start position:0%
um and that's you know the direction
 
02:31:30.790 --> 02:31:30.800 align:start position:0%
we're trying to move in an intelligent
 
02:31:34.830 --> 02:31:34.840 align:start position:0%
way um one of the um in terms of this
 
02:31:38.190 --> 02:31:38.200 align:start position:0%
budget I would say that we when you
 
02:31:41.190 --> 02:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
think about that um over probably close
 
02:31:43.590 --> 02:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
to two and a half billion dollars worth
 
02:31:43.600 --> 02:31:45.630 align:start position:0%
to two and a half billion dollars worth
of

02:31:45.630 --> 02:31:45.640 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:31:48.230 --> 02:31:48.240 align:start position:0%
claims uh in one way or another flow
 
02:31:50.710 --> 02:31:50.720 align:start position:0%
through our mismis system when you look
 
02:31:53.510 --> 02:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
at the general fund costs that are
 
02:31:55.750 --> 02:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
invested in this while it's a large
 
02:31:58.190 --> 02:31:58.200 align:start position:0%
number 11 million something it comes out
 
02:32:00.910 --> 02:32:00.920 align:start position:0%
to less than a half a percent of the
 
02:32:04.750 --> 02:32:04.760 align:start position:0%
claims paid um and when you look at our
 
02:32:07.070 --> 02:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
Administration um in the Medicaid
 
02:32:09.429 --> 02:32:09.439 align:start position:0%
Program the other part of it it's about
 
02:32:11.830 --> 02:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
a half a percent as well so I mean I
 
02:32:13.309 --> 02:32:13.319 align:start position:0%
think when you look at the pupil part
 
02:32:16.269 --> 02:32:16.279 align:start position:0%
and you look at the it part one could
 
02:32:18.910 --> 02:32:18.920 align:start position:0%
argue that maybe there's underinvestment
 
02:32:21.150 --> 02:32:21.160 align:start position:0%
there but I think I'm not I'm not
 
02:32:22.990 --> 02:32:23.000 align:start position:0%
representing that I'm saying you know
 
02:32:24.429 --> 02:32:24.439 align:start position:0%
we're we're trying to progressively
 
02:32:28.550 --> 02:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
improve and make make um get advances
 
02:32:31.830 --> 02:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
there to try to take advantage of other
 
02:32:33.750 --> 02:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
Technologies probably more where we're
 
02:32:36.990 --> 02:32:37.000 align:start position:0%
seeing AI is in the eligibility side
 
02:32:39.150 --> 02:32:39.160 align:start position:0%
which is not part of what's in the the
 
02:32:41.429 --> 02:32:41.439 align:start position:0%
division of Medicaid services I we have
 
02:32:44.389 --> 02:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
the the Medicaid information
 
02:32:46.990 --> 02:32:47.000 align:start position:0%
system um and the way that the federal
 
02:32:50.309 --> 02:32:50.319 align:start position:0%
match works there is typically on the
 
02:32:53.670 --> 02:32:53.680 align:start position:0%
capital side um which I know is not part
 
02:32:55.910 --> 02:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
of it's divided up differently in the
 
02:32:59.030 --> 02:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
house but the generally acquisition is
 
02:33:02.870 --> 02:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
approved at a 90% Federal match 10%
 
02:33:02.880 --> 02:33:03.750 align:start position:0%
approved at a 90% Federal match 10%
State

02:33:03.750 --> 02:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
State
 
02:33:08.269 --> 02:33:08.279 align:start position:0%
match um and then there's a um a part a
 
02:33:09.830 --> 02:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
time period of time in installation
 
02:33:12.349 --> 02:33:12.359 align:start position:0%
where it's 5050 and then when the system
 
02:33:14.349 --> 02:33:14.359 align:start position:0%
is certified you get to
 
02:33:16.670 --> 02:33:16.680 align:start position:0%
7525 part of what's in the Medicaid
 
02:33:18.030 --> 02:33:18.040 align:start position:0%
budget here is
 
02:33:21.110 --> 02:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
also um in this particular department is
 
02:33:23.469 --> 02:33:23.479 align:start position:0%
a is an entity called
 
02:33:27.750 --> 02:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
NT um which um because CMS is putting so
 
02:33:30.030 --> 02:33:30.040 align:start position:0%
much money to States they require you to
 
02:33:32.230 --> 02:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
have like a clerk of the works to make
 
02:33:35.349 --> 02:33:35.359 align:start position:0%
sure that the investment being made is
 
02:33:38.389 --> 02:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
sort of uh that the what's expected to
 
02:33:39.950 --> 02:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
be installed that they're looking to
 
02:33:42.230 --> 02:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
make sure that their investment is being
 
02:33:44.510 --> 02:33:44.520 align:start position:0%
protected but
 
02:33:49.230 --> 02:33:49.240 align:start position:0%
um what we see um um coming in on uh and
 
02:33:50.750 --> 02:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
we'll have I I think could exhibit later
 
02:33:54.269 --> 02:33:54.279 align:start position:0%
on here is um the migration to
 
02:33:57.389 --> 02:33:57.399 align:start position:0%
modularity begins with a system
 
02:34:00.030 --> 02:34:00.040 align:start position:0%
integrator um functionality that how
 
02:34:03.190 --> 02:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
you're going to um interface all the
 
02:34:06.790 --> 02:34:06.800 align:start position:0%
different um uh modules in a way that
 
02:34:09.110 --> 02:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
they can speak to each other so you know
 
02:34:13.469 --> 02:34:13.479 align:start position:0%
we've we've been working um to study the
 
02:34:15.550 --> 02:34:15.560 align:start position:0%
best way to do this looking at other
 
02:34:17.670 --> 02:34:17.680 align:start position:0%
states what we've found is other states
 
02:34:20.309 --> 02:34:20.319 align:start position:0%
that have begun with something other
 
02:34:22.990 --> 02:34:23.000 align:start position:0%
than the system integrator first have
 
02:34:26.150 --> 02:34:26.160 align:start position:0%
paid to regret that and so we're we're
 
02:34:27.550 --> 02:34:27.560 align:start position:0%
currently in the process of a
 
02:34:29.750 --> 02:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
procurement there and that I think
 
02:34:32.309 --> 02:34:32.319 align:start position:0%
begins our our effort to be able to
 
02:34:36.030 --> 02:34:36.040 align:start position:0%
create more um opportunities for uh
 
02:34:39.790 --> 02:34:39.800 align:start position:0%
better um uh pricing potentially than we
 
02:34:41.309 --> 02:34:41.319 align:start position:0%
otherwise would have and to be able to
 
02:34:43.389 --> 02:34:43.399 align:start position:0%
bring in new
 
02:34:46.990 --> 02:34:47.000 align:start position:0%
technology in terms of this this budget
 
02:34:50.750 --> 02:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
um as I said I think that uh what
 
02:34:55.750 --> 02:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
uh there's some some extension of our
 
02:35:00.550 --> 02:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
um event notification system the uh the
 
02:35:04.550 --> 02:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh evv system which is what uh allows us
 
02:35:07.590 --> 02:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
to see what services are provided that
 
02:35:10.309 --> 02:35:10.319 align:start position:0%
both has a benefit to us knowing that
 
02:35:12.710 --> 02:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
patients have received services but also
 
02:35:14.950 --> 02:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
is also a tool of fraud waste and abuse
 
02:35:18.150 --> 02:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
to look for that so I think in terms of
 
02:35:20.150 --> 02:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
um what you're seeing here is some
 
02:35:23.269 --> 02:35:23.279 align:start position:0%
an increase in costs um reflecting you
 
02:35:25.230 --> 02:35:25.240 align:start position:0%
know a stepping up on the modularity
 
02:35:28.269 --> 02:35:28.279 align:start position:0%
space and further deploying some of our
 
02:35:32.230 --> 02:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
technology that we already have um more
 
02:35:34.790 --> 02:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
wildly um I'll take any questions you
 
02:35:34.800 --> 02:35:37.230 align:start position:0%
wildly um I'll take any questions you
have

02:35:37.230 --> 02:35:37.240 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:35:40.830 --> 02:35:40.840 align:start position:0%
there real real quick one is if you saw
 
02:35:44.670 --> 02:35:44.680 align:start position:0%
uh reductions in uh number of Medicaid
 
02:35:48.469 --> 02:35:48.479 align:start position:0%
uh recipients um due to the some of the
 
02:35:50.910 --> 02:35:50.920 align:start position:0%
things that we're putting in hb2 would
 
02:35:52.670 --> 02:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
you see a reduction in these numbers
 
02:35:54.630 --> 02:35:54.640 align:start position:0%
because generally they'd be there'd be
 
02:35:56.670 --> 02:35:56.680 align:start position:0%
fewer people getting services and about
 
02:35:58.070 --> 02:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
the same as that were one place you
 
02:36:01.349 --> 02:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
might see a change in the budget
 
02:36:04.990 --> 02:36:05.000 align:start position:0%
um there's there's probably some small
 
02:36:11.150 --> 02:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
components like when we go to um um get
 
02:36:12.710 --> 02:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
data from an outside Source if we're
 
02:36:14.990 --> 02:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
doing that less frequently there's
 
02:36:17.469 --> 02:36:17.479 align:start position:0%
usually um you know a per click kind of
 
02:36:20.630 --> 02:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
cost in some components but the majority
 
02:36:22.710 --> 02:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
of the system is sort of like a sunk
 
02:36:26.510 --> 02:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
cost um you know we have U what we call
 
02:36:29.830 --> 02:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
a Fiscal Agent um that that interfaces
 
02:36:32.910 --> 02:36:32.920 align:start position:0%
with 35,000 providers or nearly that
 
02:36:35.710 --> 02:36:35.720 align:start position:0%
number that are enrolled in the Medicaid
 
02:36:38.309 --> 02:36:38.319 align:start position:0%
Program you know whether you have 34,000
 
02:36:38.319 --> 02:36:39.110 align:start position:0%
Program you know whether you have 34,000
or

02:36:39.110 --> 02:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:36:43.550 --> 02:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
35,000 providers or 185 or 200,000 it's
 
02:36:45.950 --> 02:36:45.960 align:start position:0%
not much you can do there in terms of
 
02:36:49.950 --> 02:36:49.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:53.110 --> 02:36:53.120 align:start position:0%
okay proceed Mr lman thank you I was
 
02:36:54.790 --> 02:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
going to suggest you know maybe five
 
02:36:57.110 --> 02:36:57.120 align:start position:0%
minute break uh especially for our
 
02:36:59.110 --> 02:36:59.120 align:start position:0%
speakers too but I know I have a hard
 
02:37:01.630 --> 02:37:01.640 align:start position:0%
stop at 10 o'clock tonight given the the
 
02:37:05.630 --> 02:37:05.640 align:start position:0%
rate that we're I'm kidding the but um
 
02:37:07.389 --> 02:37:07.399 align:start position:0%
okay are you okay with that five minute
 
02:37:10.429 --> 02:37:10.439 align:start position:0%
break I am keep whatever you want to do
 
02:37:11.950 --> 02:37:11.960 align:start position:0%
we'll be prepared to do it that sounds

02:46:20.630 --> 02:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
okay division three work session on
 
02:46:23.910 --> 02:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
February 21st is going to come back to
 
02:46:27.630 --> 02:46:27.640 align:start position:0%
order uh live on YouTube uh thank you Mr
 
02:46:30.630 --> 02:46:30.640 align:start position:0%
Lipman Mr White and also joined now at
 
02:46:34.030 --> 02:46:34.040 align:start position:0%
the table by David David shney uh the
 
02:46:36.269 --> 02:46:36.279 align:start position:0%
deputy Medicaid director yes U make
 
02:46:37.830 --> 02:46:37.840 align:start position:0%
yourself at home if you'd like to sit
 
02:46:39.670 --> 02:46:39.680 align:start position:0%
there or take one of the other seats up
 
02:46:42.670 --> 02:46:42.680 align:start position:0%
to you and we'll continue where we left
 
02:46:44.830 --> 02:46:44.840 align:start position:0%
off so I believe that was at
 
02:46:48.950 --> 02:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
page we go to 19 19 but if we could um
 
02:46:52.030 --> 02:46:52.040 align:start position:0%
Madam chair um in terms of finishing
 
02:46:54.910 --> 02:46:54.920 align:start position:0%
covering this before we go further okay
 
02:46:56.389 --> 02:46:56.399 align:start position:0%
um there are two items is that the
 
02:46:58.790 --> 02:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
document of five yes okay and we are
 
02:47:01.670 --> 02:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
going to return back to that too at the
 
02:47:03.309 --> 02:47:03.319 align:start position:0%
end as a wrap up but yes if you'd like
 
02:47:06.030 --> 02:47:06.040 align:start position:0%
to refer back to that which number just
 
02:47:10.070 --> 02:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
in terms of the um in
 
02:47:13.429 --> 02:47:13.439 align:start position:0%
79 let's see in would be
 
02:47:16.469 --> 02:47:16.479 align:start position:0%
890 the pages where oh in the governor's
 
02:47:19.429 --> 02:47:19.439 align:start position:0%
budget the governor's budget the the the
 
02:47:22.870 --> 02:47:22.880 align:start position:0%
chip is 79 this 7948 is standard
 
02:47:26.070 --> 02:47:26.080 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program and 70
 
02:47:31.070 --> 02:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
79 7051 7051 is the the Children's
 
02:47:35.830 --> 02:47:35.840 align:start position:0%
Program okay so in terms of the
 
02:47:37.950 --> 02:47:37.960 align:start position:0%
prescription which is number four the
 
02:47:43.550 --> 02:47:43.560 align:start position:0%
pharmacy cost sharing um So within the
 
02:47:47.389 --> 02:47:47.399 align:start position:0%
dollar amounts there is an estimate of
 
02:47:50.110 --> 02:47:50.120 align:start position:0%
um what we would be collected on
 
02:47:52.590 --> 02:47:52.600 align:start position:0%
prescription drug copays we do have
 
02:47:54.790 --> 02:47:54.800 align:start position:0%
copays in place today they've been a
 
02:47:55.830 --> 02:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
dollar or
 
02:47:59.070 --> 02:47:59.080 align:start position:0%
$2 for more than a decade and when you
 
02:48:02.030 --> 02:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
consider um inflation they're probably
 
02:48:04.389 --> 02:48:04.399 align:start position:0%
like a quarter and 50 cents today in
 
02:48:07.910 --> 02:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
terms of of uh and so um the allowable
 
02:48:14.790 --> 02:48:14.800 align:start position:0%
levels for um co-pays are $4 um for uh
 
02:48:18.469 --> 02:48:18.479 align:start position:0%
for preferred and non-preferred drugs is
 
02:48:21.870 --> 02:48:21.880 align:start position:0%
up to eight we Cho we chose here I think
 
02:48:25.309 --> 02:48:25.319 align:start position:0%
to look at um
 
02:48:28.950 --> 02:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
$4 uh for a couple of reasons one being
 
02:48:31.630 --> 02:48:31.640 align:start position:0%
that the concept of trying to use the
 
02:48:33.750 --> 02:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
lowest net cost it could get confusing
 
02:48:35.469 --> 02:48:35.479 align:start position:0%
over time which is preferred or not
 
02:48:37.150 --> 02:48:37.160 align:start position:0%
preferred so we'd rather have the
 
02:48:39.950 --> 02:48:39.960 align:start position:0%
preferred drug list um the other issue
 
02:48:43.030 --> 02:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
there too is that I mentioned earlier on
 
02:48:44.790 --> 02:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
the presentation we're trying to
 
02:48:47.750 --> 02:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
implement these issues if they're passed
 
02:48:49.510 --> 02:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
in the simplest way without having to
 
02:48:52.990 --> 02:48:53.000 align:start position:0%
incur major it costs to get them
 
02:48:56.550 --> 02:48:56.560 align:start position:0%
situated by having one um I think it be
 
02:48:59.510 --> 02:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
simp simpler to administer and to
 
02:49:02.230 --> 02:49:02.240 align:start position:0%
program and and
 
02:49:05.870 --> 02:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
two because of that 5% cap when you're
 
02:49:07.150 --> 02:49:07.160 align:start position:0%
talking about pre it's not just the
 
02:49:09.030 --> 02:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
premium it's any co-pays so what we're
 
02:49:11.429 --> 02:49:11.439 align:start position:0%
suggesting is that where we're charging
 
02:49:14.349 --> 02:49:14.359 align:start position:0%
a a premium not to have a co-pay on the
 
02:49:16.950 --> 02:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
medicines so we don't have to add system
 
02:49:19.349 --> 02:49:19.359 align:start position:0%
complexity and logic to to to track all
 
02:49:23.070 --> 02:49:23.080 align:start position:0%
these different um dollar amounts so um
 
02:49:25.349 --> 02:49:25.359 align:start position:0%
the $4 co-pay would apply to people who
 
02:49:28.389 --> 02:49:28.399 align:start position:0%
weren't paying premiums representative
 
02:49:30.790 --> 02:49:30.800 align:start position:0%
walner for a question that was my
 
02:49:32.990 --> 02:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
question would families who were paying
 
02:49:38.550 --> 02:49:38.560 align:start position:0%
the premium also be paying $4 now no and
 
02:49:41.429 --> 02:49:41.439 align:start position:0%
so they pay zero they would pay zero
 
02:49:43.269 --> 02:49:43.279 align:start position:0%
their premium would be their their cost
 
02:49:45.830 --> 02:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
sharing it's if we were to implement
 
02:49:47.750 --> 02:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
tracking it separately it would we
 
02:49:49.229 --> 02:49:49.239 align:start position:0%
wouldn't get it done
 
02:49:52.110 --> 02:49:52.120 align:start position:0%
very fast and it would be a lot of
 
02:49:54.070 --> 02:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
dollars to probably get it done because
 
02:49:58.790 --> 02:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
it' be a major major change right
 
02:50:01.510 --> 02:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
thank sorry representative tki for
 
02:50:03.630 --> 02:50:03.640 align:start position:0%
question thank you just to help me
 
02:50:06.990 --> 02:50:07.000 align:start position:0%
process this so the people who do not
 
02:50:08.830 --> 02:50:08.840 align:start position:0%
have a premium so the ones who fall
 
02:50:11.910 --> 02:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
below that the federal poverty
 
02:50:14.110 --> 02:50:14.120 align:start position:0%
threshold are going to be the ones that
 
02:50:15.229 --> 02:50:15.239 align:start position:0%
have to pay their
 
02:50:17.870 --> 02:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
$4 at the pharmacy pay it to the
 
02:50:21.710 --> 02:50:21.720 align:start position:0%
pharmacy pay it yes today today there's
 
02:50:24.670 --> 02:50:24.680 align:start position:0%
a dollar or $2 y um instead of a dollar
 
02:50:28.349 --> 02:50:28.359 align:start position:0%
or $2 it would be $4 except if you were
 
02:50:33.550 --> 02:50:33.560 align:start position:0%
a a participant that was um paying a
 
02:50:33.560 --> 02:50:37.030 align:start position:0%
a a participant that was um paying a
premium

02:50:37.030 --> 02:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:40.070 --> 02:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
okay so sorry one quick followup as I'm
 
02:50:43.630 --> 02:50:43.640 align:start position:0%
processing this so
 
02:50:47.110 --> 02:50:47.120 align:start position:0%
how would you would keep track of those
 
02:50:50.510 --> 02:50:50.520 align:start position:0%
co-pays on the
 
02:50:53.670 --> 02:50:53.680 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical to then get up to the 5%
 
02:50:55.790 --> 02:50:55.800 align:start position:0%
of income if necessary if they got to
 
02:50:59.269 --> 02:50:59.279 align:start position:0%
that level yeah it's very un we have to
 
02:51:01.870 --> 02:51:01.880 align:start position:0%
have a control in place to make sure but
 
02:51:05.590 --> 02:51:05.600 align:start position:0%
with with the one1 and2 we usually get
 
02:51:08.630 --> 02:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
nowhere near that and um I think the
 
02:51:11.389 --> 02:51:11.399 align:start position:0%
$4 it's not di Minimus to the individual
 
02:51:12.870 --> 02:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
that has to pay it but it's a it's
 
02:51:14.870 --> 02:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
fairly di Minimus in the scope of what
 
02:51:19.150 --> 02:51:19.160 align:start position:0%
the the costs are and one last question
 
02:51:22.670 --> 02:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
you talk often about these extremely
 
02:51:24.510 --> 02:51:24.520 align:start position:0%
expensive therapeutic
 
02:51:28.309 --> 02:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
drugs um how does that play into this in
 
02:51:28.319 --> 02:51:29.229 align:start position:0%
drugs um how does that play into this in
this

02:51:29.229 --> 02:51:29.239 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:51:31.670 --> 02:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
situation so a lot of those like the
 
02:51:34.630 --> 02:51:34.640 align:start position:0%
zenzer example which is the the most
 
02:51:37.030 --> 02:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
expensive one we've ever experienced um
 
02:51:39.550 --> 02:51:39.560 align:start position:0%
they come with hospitalization and
 
02:51:42.389 --> 02:51:42.399 align:start position:0%
so those instances the drugs are part of
 
02:51:44.150 --> 02:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
typically an inpatient admission or
 
02:51:46.150 --> 02:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
Hospital outpatient visit so they're not
 
02:51:48.670 --> 02:51:48.680 align:start position:0%
like what you would go to CVS or WR a or
 
02:51:52.510 --> 02:51:52.520 align:start position:0%
yep for Walgreens to pick up a script
 
02:51:54.309 --> 02:51:54.319 align:start position:0%
but even beyond that if you have someone
 
02:51:57.429 --> 02:51:57.439 align:start position:0%
who's on some kind of more expensive
 
02:51:59.590 --> 02:51:59.600 align:start position:0%
medication maybe something that's a
 
02:52:01.510 --> 02:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
couple hundred dollars a a month a
 
02:52:04.950 --> 02:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
script or whatever um it would be that
 
02:52:04.960 --> 02:52:10.710 align:start position:0%
script or whatever um it would be that
$4

02:52:10.710 --> 02:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:14.229 --> 02:52:14.239 align:start position:0%
correct and the number five um is the
 
02:52:19.190 --> 02:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
granted Advantage uh program um
 
02:52:22.150 --> 02:52:22.160 align:start position:0%
typically uh premiums are not allowed
 
02:52:24.110 --> 02:52:24.120 align:start position:0%
when you're paying under when the
 
02:52:28.309 --> 02:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
federal poverty limit is um uh below
 
02:52:28.319 --> 02:52:29.830 align:start position:0%
federal poverty limit is um uh below
150%

02:52:29.830 --> 02:52:29.840 align:start position:0%
150%
 
02:52:32.389 --> 02:52:32.399 align:start position:0%
um as I mentioned
 
02:52:34.670 --> 02:52:34.680 align:start position:0%
earlier the average tenure on the
 
02:52:39.070 --> 02:52:39.080 align:start position:0%
program is under a year uh it's like 302
 
02:52:41.269 --> 02:52:41.279 align:start position:0%
days I think currently is the average
 
02:52:42.710 --> 02:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
tenure on the
 
02:52:45.830 --> 02:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
program individuals who leave granted
 
02:52:48.830 --> 02:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
Advantage often are then their choice of
 
02:52:50.670 --> 02:52:50.680 align:start position:0%
coverage if they they're making more
 
02:52:54.750 --> 02:52:54.760 align:start position:0%
than 138% of FPL which is not hard to do
 
02:52:57.870 --> 02:52:57.880 align:start position:0%
in today's uh economy if you will in New
 
02:53:02.870 --> 02:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire employment space um they um
 
02:53:05.990 --> 02:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
often would migrate to an ACA product
 
02:53:08.150 --> 02:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
and there they're going to have co-pays
 
02:53:12.150 --> 02:53:12.160 align:start position:0%
and deductibles and I think in part
 
02:53:15.389 --> 02:53:15.399 align:start position:0%
um I think It prepares
 
02:53:19.070 --> 02:53:19.080 align:start position:0%
individuals um for the fact that that
 
02:53:21.990 --> 02:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
health care when you're outside of
 
02:53:26.510 --> 02:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
Medicaid does come with cost um and it
 
02:53:28.349 --> 02:53:28.359 align:start position:0%
would take a a waiver to get an
 
02:53:30.870 --> 02:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
exception from the the rule there to to
 
02:53:34.229 --> 02:53:34.239 align:start position:0%
do this so we have no um no expectation
 
02:53:38.389 --> 02:53:38.399 align:start position:0%
in 2026 that that would occur um that it
 
02:53:41.030 --> 02:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
would take us time to work through the
 
02:53:45.349 --> 02:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
federal process to get that um and again
 
02:53:47.469 --> 02:53:47.479 align:start position:0%
um there are a lot of details in terms
 
02:53:49.790 --> 02:53:49.800 align:start position:0%
of what I'm they don't pay or what if
 
02:53:51.030 --> 02:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
they're in the middle of treatment the
 
02:53:53.910 --> 02:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
same issues with the children um types
 
02:53:54.990 --> 02:53:55.000 align:start position:0%
of issues that we'll have to work
 
02:53:57.030 --> 02:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
through are are are things that we need
 
02:54:00.790 --> 02:54:00.800 align:start position:0%
to work through there um but I think
 
02:54:03.670 --> 02:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
that doing a premium is preferential to
 
02:54:05.630 --> 02:54:05.640 align:start position:0%
cost sharing because then it's at the
 
02:54:07.389 --> 02:54:07.399 align:start position:0%
provider level where I think you run
 
02:54:10.429 --> 02:54:10.439 align:start position:0%
into access issues you know if you're
 
02:54:14.229 --> 02:54:14.239 align:start position:0%
that that um you could argue the other
 
02:54:15.510 --> 02:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
way but I think in New Hampshire our
 
02:54:16.950 --> 02:54:16.960 align:start position:0%
experience has been that when you've
 
02:54:19.550 --> 02:54:19.560 align:start position:0%
tried to do co-pays and emergency for
 
02:54:21.349 --> 02:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
non-emergency care or other things it
 
02:54:25.110 --> 02:54:25.120 align:start position:0%
just just adds to the bad debt that the
 
02:54:27.910 --> 02:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
providers are having and they're less
 
02:54:30.110 --> 02:54:30.120 align:start position:0%
willing to maybe accept patients who are
 
02:54:33.870 --> 02:54:33.880 align:start position:0%
on Medicaid so I think um if there is it
 
02:54:36.670 --> 02:54:36.680 align:start position:0%
going to be a premium and cost sharing
 
02:54:38.990 --> 02:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
this is I think the the best way to
 
02:54:43.229 --> 02:54:43.239 align:start position:0%
preserve access from to the providers um
 
02:54:44.750 --> 02:54:44.760 align:start position:0%
and I know there probably differences of
 
02:54:46.349 --> 02:54:46.359 align:start position:0%
opinion as to whether a premium should
 
02:54:48.670 --> 02:54:48.680 align:start position:0%
be there at all but um if there is one I
 
02:54:51.590 --> 02:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
think this is the the best way to do the
 
02:54:51.600 --> 02:54:52.670 align:start position:0%
think this is the the best way to do the
cost

02:54:52.670 --> 02:54:52.680 align:start position:0%
cost
 
02:54:55.110 --> 02:54:55.120 align:start position:0%
sharing representative Stringham for a
 
02:54:59.229 --> 02:54:59.239 align:start position:0%
question yeah uh um how many uh total uh
 
02:55:01.469 --> 02:55:01.479 align:start position:0%
patients are in this block and then how
 
02:55:04.590 --> 02:55:04.600 align:start position:0%
many how many in the 100 do 135% right
 
02:55:06.110 --> 02:55:06.120 align:start position:0%
great question do we actually have a
 
02:55:09.309 --> 02:55:09.319 align:start position:0%
slide on that or okay but we do we
 
02:55:10.830 --> 02:55:10.840 align:start position:0%
actually when we did the 101 there is
 
02:55:14.469 --> 02:55:14.479 align:start position:0%
one um there's about 10,000 individuals
 
02:55:17.150 --> 02:55:17.160 align:start position:0%
who are in that 100 out of the 60,000
 
02:55:20.389 --> 02:55:20.399 align:start position:0%
that are in the 100 to 138 if I'm
 
02:55:23.950 --> 02:55:23.960 align:start position:0%
remembering correctly and um the ma the
 
02:55:27.590 --> 02:55:27.600 align:start position:0%
majority are below 100% um and so they
 
02:55:30.150 --> 02:55:30.160 align:start position:0%
would be only subject to the $4 co-pays
 
02:55:33.389 --> 02:55:33.399 align:start position:0%
for prescription drugs thank you if you
 
02:55:36.150 --> 02:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
give us a moment we can look that up you
 
02:55:36.160 --> 02:55:40.190 align:start position:0%
give us a moment we can look that up you
just

02:55:40.190 --> 02:55:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:44.070 --> 02:55:44.080 align:start position:0%
one yeah actually
 
02:55:49.389 --> 02:55:49.399 align:start position:0%
11, 167 11,167 when we ran the report
 
02:55:51.990 --> 02:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
um out of the almost
 
02:55:56.070 --> 02:55:56.080 align:start position:0%
60,000 so about 16 177% representative
 
02:55:57.389 --> 02:55:57.399 align:start position:0%
walner for
 
02:56:00.150 --> 02:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
question so the one thing about granted
 
02:56:03.190 --> 02:56:03.200 align:start position:0%
Advantage is that this is a program for
 
02:56:06.309 --> 02:56:06.319 align:start position:0%
very low very lowincome people who in
 
02:56:07.710 --> 02:56:07.720 align:start position:0%
the past could not
 
02:56:11.510 --> 02:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
afford Private health insurance and they
 
02:56:11.520 --> 02:56:13.349 align:start position:0%
afford Private health insurance and they
probably

02:56:13.349 --> 02:56:13.359 align:start position:0%
probably
 
02:56:15.670 --> 02:56:15.680 align:start position:0%
used they didn't have their own doctor
 
02:56:17.990 --> 02:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
they maybe used the emergency room more
 
02:56:21.030 --> 02:56:21.040 align:start position:0%
or or urgent care centers more that was
 
02:56:23.150 --> 02:56:23.160 align:start position:0%
where they they were able to get their
 
02:56:26.269 --> 02:56:26.279 align:start position:0%
care have you seen are you have you seen
 
02:56:28.710 --> 02:56:28.720 align:start position:0%
some studies that is showing that
 
02:56:30.830 --> 02:56:30.840 align:start position:0%
they're more likely now to be using
 
02:56:33.830 --> 02:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
their own physician getting preventive
 
02:56:37.110 --> 02:56:37.120 align:start position:0%
kinds of services are we saving money
 
02:56:39.750 --> 02:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
actually because they use it in a better
 
02:56:43.950 --> 02:56:43.960 align:start position:0%
way I I think that the studies suggest
 
02:56:47.870 --> 02:56:47.880 align:start position:0%
that um for an individual that to be
 
02:56:47.880 --> 02:56:48.790 align:start position:0%
that um for an individual that to be
access

02:56:48.790 --> 02:56:48.800 align:start position:0%
access
 
02:56:51.349 --> 02:56:51.359 align:start position:0%
Care at the appropriate setting is
 
02:56:53.349 --> 02:56:53.359 align:start position:0%
advantageous to the cost of the system
 
02:56:56.670 --> 02:56:56.680 align:start position:0%
and to get care right time right place
 
02:57:00.269 --> 02:57:00.279 align:start position:0%
um and um you know how we would set the
 
02:57:02.429 --> 02:57:02.439 align:start position:0%
premiums we try to be as sensitive as we
 
02:57:06.630 --> 02:57:06.640 align:start position:0%
can to not making it go to the wrong
 
02:57:08.750 --> 02:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
place the most expensive place I think
 
02:57:13.070 --> 02:57:13.080 align:start position:0%
that we don't want to defeat the defeat
 
02:57:16.309 --> 02:57:16.319 align:start position:0%
the if you will the the the value that
 
02:57:19.630 --> 02:57:19.640 align:start position:0%
comes from some cost sharing um to you
 
02:57:22.550 --> 02:57:22.560 align:start position:0%
know the budget that we're facing um so
 
02:57:25.070 --> 02:57:25.080 align:start position:0%
I I think we we try to be smart about
 
02:57:27.790 --> 02:57:27.800 align:start position:0%
you know there times other times that
 
02:57:30.469 --> 02:57:30.479 align:start position:0%
going way back where New Hampshire for
 
02:57:32.590 --> 02:57:32.600 align:start position:0%
example maybe you have recollection of
 
02:57:34.510 --> 02:57:34.520 align:start position:0%
this limited the number of prescriptions
 
02:57:37.590 --> 02:57:37.600 align:start position:0%
that um someone could get and there's
 
02:57:40.429 --> 02:57:40.439 align:start position:0%
actually a couple of uh National studies
 
02:57:41.870 --> 02:57:41.880 align:start position:0%
that New England Journal of Medicine
 
02:57:44.070 --> 02:57:44.080 align:start position:0%
that showed that wasn't such a good
 
02:57:46.469 --> 02:57:46.479 align:start position:0%
thing it and it led to more people being
 
02:57:48.710 --> 02:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
institutionalized so I think you got to
 
02:57:51.269 --> 02:57:51.279 align:start position:0%
be careful about how you set these
 
02:57:53.710 --> 02:57:53.720 align:start position:0%
things so they don't have a a boomerang
 
02:57:56.429 --> 02:57:56.439 align:start position:0%
effect that ends up costing more and
 
02:57:59.309 --> 02:57:59.319 align:start position:0%
leading to worse health so it's we're
 
02:58:02.469 --> 02:58:02.479 align:start position:0%
going to have to approach this with
 
02:58:05.269 --> 02:58:05.279 align:start position:0%
sensitivity just one other question how
 
02:58:07.990 --> 02:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
how much I mean you must have done some
 
02:58:11.590 --> 02:58:11.600 align:start position:0%
estimates how much do you think the
 
02:58:14.870 --> 02:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
state will be receiving from these folks
 
02:58:17.469 --> 02:58:17.479 align:start position:0%
for their their part of the premium yeah
 
02:58:21.389 --> 02:58:21.399 align:start position:0%
so it's factored into the budget um it's
 
02:58:25.750 --> 02:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh 12 million in um in the second year
 
02:58:26.590 --> 02:58:26.600 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:58:30.870 --> 02:58:30.880 align:start position:0%
bayum and again we did not assume 100%
 
02:58:30.880 --> 02:58:33.590 align:start position:0%
bayum and again we did not assume 100%
collection

02:58:33.590 --> 02:58:33.600 align:start position:0%
collection
 
02:58:37.870 --> 02:58:37.880 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you and there on an in if at
 
02:58:39.469 --> 02:58:39.479 align:start position:0%
current poverty levels just to give you
 
02:58:42.469 --> 02:58:42.479 align:start position:0%
some scaling of it it'd be about
 
02:58:47.469 --> 02:58:47.479 align:start position:0%
$750 at a 5% level and representative
 
02:58:47.479 --> 02:58:48.990 align:start position:0%
$750 at a 5% level and representative
tarki

02:58:48.990 --> 02:58:49.000 align:start position:0%
tarki
 
02:58:52.269 --> 02:58:52.279 align:start position:0%
question so you didn't assume 100%
 
02:58:54.309 --> 02:58:54.319 align:start position:0%
compliance what did you assume to get to
 
02:58:56.269 --> 02:58:56.279 align:start position:0%
that 12 million I'm just
 
02:58:59.670 --> 02:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
curious um I'm happy to answer the
 
02:59:01.070 --> 02:59:01.080 align:start position:0%
question but I also I'm a little bit
 
02:59:03.150 --> 02:59:03.160 align:start position:0%
concerned about putting out the
 
02:59:05.670 --> 02:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
percentage that people feel that they
 
02:59:09.229 --> 02:59:09.239 align:start position:0%
wouldn't but I suffice it to say that um
 
02:59:11.790 --> 02:59:11.800 align:start position:0%
there's a a reasonable percentage of
 
02:59:13.630 --> 02:59:13.640 align:start position:0%
what we expect to collect I don't want
 
02:59:17.229 --> 02:59:17.239 align:start position:0%
to put a number out there um because I
 
02:59:18.830 --> 02:59:18.840 align:start position:0%
don't want to be lower than it otherwise
 
02:59:21.870 --> 02:59:21.880 align:start position:0%
would be um if that's the policy that's
 
02:59:24.790 --> 02:59:24.800 align:start position:0%
implemented um but you know we'd expect
 
02:59:26.670 --> 02:59:26.680 align:start position:0%
that a a number of people are not going
 
02:59:29.590 --> 02:59:29.600 align:start position:0%
to be able to to pay it's not like 5%
 
02:59:33.309 --> 02:59:33.319 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's a much higher number than
 
02:59:33.319 --> 02:59:36.190 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's a much higher number than
five

02:59:36.190 --> 02:59:36.200 align:start position:0%
five
 
02:59:38.349 --> 02:59:38.359 align:start position:0%
yeah representative Stringham for a
 
02:59:40.429 --> 02:59:40.439 align:start position:0%
question I mean is your concern as if
 
02:59:43.349 --> 02:59:43.359 align:start position:0%
the number is 50% you just don't want to
 
02:59:45.910 --> 02:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
say on Zoom that 6,000 people are going
 
02:59:48.349 --> 02:59:48.359 align:start position:0%
to lose their health insurance no it's I
 
02:59:49.910 --> 02:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
think it's just more the collectibility
 
02:59:52.710 --> 02:59:52.720 align:start position:0%
what the you know I think if we're we're
 
02:59:57.190 --> 02:59:57.200 align:start position:0%
charging a premium in the program here I
 
02:59:59.790 --> 02:59:59.800 align:start position:0%
think that in good faith we want people
 
03:00:02.510 --> 03:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
to pay it if they can pay it and if they
 
03:00:04.190 --> 03:00:04.200 align:start position:0%
can't pay it then we're going to have
 
03:00:06.030 --> 03:00:06.040 align:start position:0%
policies to address that I think it's
 
03:00:08.269 --> 03:00:08.279 align:start position:0%
just don't want to set something up
 
03:00:09.389 --> 03:00:09.399 align:start position:0%
where we say we don't have an
 
03:00:12.990 --> 03:00:13.000 align:start position:0%
expectation to pay um and so I think
 
03:00:15.070 --> 03:00:15.080 align:start position:0%
again you know what representative
 
03:00:17.550 --> 03:00:17.560 align:start position:0%
walner raised in terms of sensitivities
 
03:00:19.710 --> 03:00:19.720 align:start position:0%
around people who are in in treatment
 
03:00:21.190 --> 03:00:21.200 align:start position:0%
that we don't want to do something
 
03:00:23.349 --> 03:00:23.359 align:start position:0%
that's foolish in terms of saying okay
 
03:00:25.070 --> 03:00:25.080 align:start position:0%
you're in the middle of chemotherapy
 
03:00:26.469 --> 03:00:26.479 align:start position:0%
we're not going we're going to cut you
 
03:00:28.870 --> 03:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
off we knock you off and a month later
 
03:00:31.630 --> 03:00:31.640 align:start position:0%
you're back on that doesn't make sense
 
03:00:35.229 --> 03:00:35.239 align:start position:0%
right so I think we we do um need to
 
03:00:37.990 --> 03:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
carefully um Design This and and
 
03:00:40.429 --> 03:00:40.439 align:start position:0%
evaluate it in terms of what's the best
 
03:00:44.150 --> 03:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
way to administer it so that the value
 
03:00:46.750 --> 03:00:46.760 align:start position:0%
that could be had from it um
 
03:00:48.510 --> 03:00:48.520 align:start position:0%
understanding some people feel like
 
03:00:50.670 --> 03:00:50.680 align:start position:0%
and I think some literature you know
 
03:00:53.269 --> 03:00:53.279 align:start position:0%
shows that it's not a favorable thing to
 
03:00:56.030 --> 03:00:56.040 align:start position:0%
have cost sharing but I'm I would say
 
03:00:59.070 --> 03:00:59.080 align:start position:0%
that there are states of both ends of
 
03:01:01.469 --> 03:01:01.479 align:start position:0%
the spectrum that do have premiums and
 
03:01:05.910 --> 03:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
have continued to have them um and uh so
 
03:01:09.070 --> 03:01:09.080 align:start position:0%
I think while it's a policy choice to
 
03:01:11.030 --> 03:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
still be worked through the legislature
 
03:01:13.190 --> 03:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
it isn't one that New Hampshire would be
 
03:01:15.710 --> 03:01:15.720 align:start position:0%
standing alone in and and it has been
 
03:01:17.990 --> 03:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
something we've done in the past just
 
03:01:20.590 --> 03:01:20.600 align:start position:0%
quick followup and the um the 5% is that
 
03:01:23.469 --> 03:01:23.479 align:start position:0%
a ramp or is it a cliff like if you hit
 
03:01:27.750 --> 03:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
100% you pay 5% of income or is it 1% at
 
03:01:30.190 --> 03:01:30.200 align:start position:0%
that level and unfortunately it is a it
 
03:01:33.710 --> 03:01:33.720 align:start position:0%
is a cliff Cliff the the premium though
 
03:01:39.030 --> 03:01:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:41.510 --> 03:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
138 so if I could just if I could just
 
03:01:43.469 --> 03:01:43.479 align:start position:0%
summarize what you said about you know
 
03:01:46.030 --> 03:01:46.040 align:start position:0%
the in that 12 million number what the
 
03:01:48.750 --> 03:01:48.760 align:start position:0%
Assumption was uh that what you're
 
03:01:50.950 --> 03:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
saying is that you're basing this on
 
03:01:53.190 --> 03:01:53.200 align:start position:0%
either PR experience and other programs
 
03:01:57.830 --> 03:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
or looking at other states um uh
 
03:02:00.550 --> 03:02:00.560 align:start position:0%
experience without disclosing what the
 
03:02:04.309 --> 03:02:04.319 align:start position:0%
what the number is right I think we do
 
03:02:06.429 --> 03:02:06.439 align:start position:0%
realize that there is going to be
 
03:02:08.630 --> 03:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
situations where it can't be paid and we
 
03:02:11.309 --> 03:02:11.319 align:start position:0%
want to design policies around that as
 
03:02:12.910 --> 03:02:12.920 align:start position:0%
opposed to just setting an expectation
 
03:02:16.469 --> 03:02:16.479 align:start position:0%
that it's not paid okay thank
 
03:02:19.269 --> 03:02:19.279 align:start position:0%
you okay ready to proceed we are
 
03:02:22.429 --> 03:02:22.439 align:start position:0%
entering Hour 4 so um I don't want to
 
03:02:23.830 --> 03:02:23.840 align:start position:0%
certainly rush I want you to be able to
 
03:02:25.870 --> 03:02:25.880 align:start position:0%
say whatever you want to but just uh
 
03:02:30.630 --> 03:02:30.640 align:start position:0%
keeping track of the time so on on page
 
03:02:35.710 --> 03:02:35.720 align:start position:0%
19 um and um on the break Uh Kevin
 
03:02:38.269 --> 03:02:38.279 align:start position:0%
Ripple asked us a question about uh a
 
03:02:39.429 --> 03:02:39.439 align:start position:0%
figure in
 
03:02:41.550 --> 03:02:41.560 align:start position:0%
7948 I don't know if you want to address
 
03:02:41.560 --> 03:02:46.110 align:start position:0%
7948 I don't know if you want to address
that

03:02:46.110 --> 03:02:46.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:49.150 --> 03:02:49.160 align:start position:0%
um so the question that Kevin had asked
 
03:02:53.590 --> 03:02:53.600 align:start position:0%
us uh it it relates to accounting unit
 
03:02:56.710 --> 03:02:56.720 align:start position:0%
7948 and the uh specifically the
 
03:02:59.030 --> 03:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
adjusted authorized amount and it's on
 
03:03:01.590 --> 03:03:01.600 align:start position:0%
page 892 of the governor's operating
 
03:03:05.910 --> 03:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
budget is where I apologize it's on page
 
03:03:10.510 --> 03:03:10.520 align:start position:0%
891 there we go um so on
 
03:03:14.030 --> 03:03:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:17.269 --> 03:03:17.279 align:start position:0%
minute yes so on page 891 uh in the
 
03:03:19.630 --> 03:03:19.640 align:start position:0%
estimated source of funds about 34 of
 
03:03:21.469 --> 03:03:21.479 align:start position:0%
the way down the page you'll see the
 
03:03:23.670 --> 03:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
general fund amount the actual expense
 
03:03:26.469 --> 03:03:26.479 align:start position:0%
in state fiscal year 24 being about $138
 
03:03:28.910 --> 03:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
million of General funds and then you'll
 
03:03:32.830 --> 03:03:32.840 align:start position:0%
see that increase there the 226 number
 
03:03:34.469 --> 03:03:34.479 align:start position:0%
and then you'll see it go back down for
 
03:03:36.429 --> 03:03:36.439 align:start position:0%
the Governor's recommended
 
03:03:38.990 --> 03:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
budget so the reason that you do see a
 
03:03:40.590 --> 03:03:40.600 align:start position:0%
large increase in the adjusted
 
03:03:43.190 --> 03:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
authorized is based on the existing
 
03:03:46.110 --> 03:03:46.120 align:start position:0%
state law that that is applicable and it
 
03:03:48.870 --> 03:03:48.880 align:start position:0%
has been for about 3 or four years years
 
03:03:51.590 --> 03:03:51.600 align:start position:0%
um the Medicaid Program is able to carry
 
03:03:54.150 --> 03:03:54.160 align:start position:0%
forward funds within that within the the
 
03:03:57.190 --> 03:03:57.200 align:start position:0%
101 class line as restricted revenue
 
03:04:00.309 --> 03:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
from one year to the next and so on page
 
03:04:03.229 --> 03:04:03.239 align:start position:0%
19 of the PowerPoint presentation that's
 
03:04:06.670 --> 03:04:06.680 align:start position:0%
before you the the net uh unencumbered
 
03:04:09.910 --> 03:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
General funds in 7948 is is
 
03:04:13.190 --> 03:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
approximately almost $29 million once we
 
03:04:15.190 --> 03:04:15.200 align:start position:0%
take into account the existing
 
03:04:17.910 --> 03:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
liabilities um and there and the the
 
03:04:20.910 --> 03:04:20.920 align:start position:0%
item that we did discuss that is in the
 
03:04:23.670 --> 03:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
hb2 uh document that we were looking at
 
03:04:26.710 --> 03:04:26.720 align:start position:0%
the other day continues that authority
 
03:04:29.349 --> 03:04:29.359 align:start position:0%
to carry forward funds from this bium to
 
03:04:31.630 --> 03:04:31.640 align:start position:0%
the next and part of the reason uh
 
03:04:33.910 --> 03:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
historical reason for doing that here
 
03:04:36.190 --> 03:04:36.200 align:start position:0%
and other states do this as well is
 
03:04:38.750 --> 03:04:38.760 align:start position:0%
because the Medicaid budget is in the
 
03:04:42.229 --> 03:04:42.239 align:start position:0%
billions of dollars so while the the um
 
03:04:44.269 --> 03:04:44.279 align:start position:0%
the unencumbered general fund amount is
 
03:04:48.070 --> 03:04:48.080 align:start position:0%
$28 million if we have a slight change
 
03:04:51.150 --> 03:04:51.160 align:start position:0%
in the economy or some other change or
 
03:04:53.389 --> 03:04:53.399 align:start position:0%
the projections differ a year out from
 
03:04:56.550 --> 03:04:56.560 align:start position:0%
where we started um that 28 million can
 
03:04:58.590 --> 03:04:58.600 align:start position:0%
get eaten up really quickly because as a
 
03:05:00.550 --> 03:05:00.560 align:start position:0%
percentage of of a couple billion
 
03:05:02.630 --> 03:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
dollars it's it's a relatively small
 
03:05:05.190 --> 03:05:05.200 align:start position:0%
amount I do recognize that it is larger
 
03:05:07.710 --> 03:05:07.720 align:start position:0%
than some other state agencies in
 
03:05:09.670 --> 03:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
totality but we're also talking about
 
03:05:11.070 --> 03:05:11.080 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid budget which is in the
 
03:05:13.750 --> 03:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
billions of dollars
 
03:05:19.389 --> 03:05:19.399 align:start position:0%
so and um I think slide 20 we we've um
 
03:05:22.670 --> 03:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
covered all of these um items in the
 
03:05:24.309 --> 03:05:24.319 align:start position:0%
discussion but if there's a question on
 
03:05:27.070 --> 03:05:27.080 align:start position:0%
it we're happy to take it we do have one
 
03:05:28.550 --> 03:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
if I
 
03:05:31.550 --> 03:05:31.560 align:start position:0%
may representative tki so what I'm a
 
03:05:33.950 --> 03:05:33.960 align:start position:0%
little confused by something okay so it
 
03:05:36.429 --> 03:05:36.439 align:start position:0%
appears that the issues that we
 
03:05:39.870 --> 03:05:39.880 align:start position:0%
discussed on the five bullet page
 
03:05:43.510 --> 03:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
document is included for the most part
 
03:05:45.389 --> 03:05:45.399 align:start position:0%
in the governor adjustments to the
 
03:05:48.150 --> 03:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
budget yes and not listed
 
03:05:51.790 --> 03:05:51.800 align:start position:0%
under the part that says hb2 items and
 
03:05:53.950 --> 03:05:53.960 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that we have a whole lot
 
03:05:56.630 --> 03:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
of big bucket of policy changes that are
 
03:05:59.790 --> 03:05:59.800 align:start position:0%
going to come with de specific details
 
03:06:02.429 --> 03:06:02.439 align:start position:0%
on things and I'm wondering where's that
 
03:06:03.429 --> 03:06:03.439 align:start position:0%
all going to
 
03:06:07.269 --> 03:06:07.279 align:start position:0%
land so I think in terms of um during
 
03:06:11.150 --> 03:06:11.160 align:start position:0%
the break U Kevin Ripple passed out this
 
03:06:16.150 --> 03:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
piece of paper um I think OS would would
 
03:06:19.110 --> 03:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
probably um work on these and they might
 
03:06:22.030 --> 03:06:22.040 align:start position:0%
have some suggestions um but I think
 
03:06:25.229 --> 03:06:25.239 align:start position:0%
this would represent you know it's it's
 
03:06:28.950 --> 03:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
basically four paragraphs of of uh each
 
03:06:30.990 --> 03:06:31.000 align:start position:0%
each of the items except for the granted
 
03:06:34.710 --> 03:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
Advantage one that um is here I
 
03:06:37.670 --> 03:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
think so to clarify what you just said
 
03:06:40.309 --> 03:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
so this paper that got lost on my desk
 
03:06:43.070 --> 03:06:43.080 align:start position:0%
no um that those this paper passed up
 
03:06:46.670 --> 03:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
the break yep yep so one two 3 four five
 
03:06:47.950 --> 03:06:47.960 align:start position:0%
different little paragraphs there you
 
03:06:50.309 --> 03:06:50.319 align:start position:0%
said this is probably the language it's
 
03:06:52.030 --> 03:06:52.040 align:start position:0%
going to be used but it's missing the
 
03:06:53.870 --> 03:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
granite Advantage sorry I stand
 
03:06:55.349 --> 03:06:55.359 align:start position:0%
corrected that's the third one granted
 
03:06:55.359 --> 03:06:58.030 align:start position:0%
corrected that's the third one granted
advantages

03:06:58.030 --> 03:06:58.040 align:start position:0%
advantages
 
03:07:02.750 --> 03:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:05.750 --> 03:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
five and this will be sorry and so just
 
03:07:10.349 --> 03:07:10.359 align:start position:0%
to clarify it will be the in an hb2 item
 
03:07:12.830 --> 03:07:12.840 align:start position:0%
even though the slide says it's not yes
 
03:07:14.950 --> 03:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
so so so this this is the language that
 
03:07:17.750 --> 03:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
we anticipate or some there may be some
 
03:07:21.229 --> 03:07:21.239 align:start position:0%
minor variations that will come out um
 
03:07:25.510 --> 03:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
in hb2 that OS will release the hb2
 
03:07:26.950 --> 03:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
document that we were looking at the
 
03:07:29.790 --> 03:07:29.800 align:start position:0%
other day did include the brand name
 
03:07:32.590 --> 03:07:32.600 align:start position:0%
versus generic drugs but these are the
 
03:07:35.550 --> 03:07:35.560 align:start position:0%
remaining five additional policy changes
 
03:07:38.710 --> 03:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
that have been um incorporated into the
 
03:07:40.389 --> 03:07:40.399 align:start position:0%
governor's operating budget so the
 
03:07:42.269 --> 03:07:42.279 align:start position:0%
dollars that you see reflect these
 
03:07:44.670 --> 03:07:44.680 align:start position:0%
Provisions can I be really simplistic
 
03:07:46.630 --> 03:07:46.640 align:start position:0%
and ask you to on each paragraph just
 
03:07:49.469 --> 03:07:49.479 align:start position:0%
tell me what responds to yes the policy
 
03:07:52.110 --> 03:07:52.120 align:start position:0%
matters on the other so the first one is
 
03:07:55.469 --> 03:07:55.479 align:start position:0%
the $4 copay which is item four on that
 
03:08:00.150 --> 03:08:00.160 align:start position:0%
sheet yeah um the the next one is
 
03:08:03.190 --> 03:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
basically a a an expense reduction in
 
03:08:05.910 --> 03:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
the administrative area it's saying that
 
03:08:08.630 --> 03:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
we're only going to do one rate filing a
 
03:08:13.710 --> 03:08:13.720 align:start position:0%
year um I'm not sure that that is that's
 
03:08:16.190 --> 03:08:16.200 align:start position:0%
just a I think an expense reduction but
 
03:08:21.950 --> 03:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
just um then the the next one is um the
 
03:08:24.070 --> 03:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
granted Advantage one which is number
 
03:08:24.080 --> 03:08:25.950 align:start position:0%
granted Advantage one which is number
five

03:08:25.950 --> 03:08:25.960 align:start position:0%
five
 
03:08:30.910 --> 03:08:30.920 align:start position:0%
y um the um the the fourth one on that
 
03:08:33.750 --> 03:08:33.760 align:start position:0%
page is the the children's that going
 
03:08:33.760 --> 03:08:35.070 align:start position:0%
page is the the children's that going
the

03:08:35.070 --> 03:08:35.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:08:38.630 --> 03:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
255 and that was number two that would
 
03:08:42.150 --> 03:08:42.160 align:start position:0%
be number two and number one is the last
 
03:08:45.389 --> 03:08:45.399 align:start position:0%
one which is restoring the back to the
 
03:08:50.830 --> 03:08:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:52.309 --> 03:08:52.319 align:start position:0%
so the last one we correspond with
 
03:08:52.319 --> 03:08:53.910 align:start position:0%
so the last one we correspond with
number

03:08:53.910 --> 03:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
number
 
03:09:00.429 --> 03:09:00.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:04.070 --> 03:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
welcome um if if it's okay um advancing
 
03:09:08.349 --> 03:09:08.359 align:start position:0%
to uh yes page 21 is basically provided
 
03:09:10.630 --> 03:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
you've heard a lot and lot thrown at you
 
03:09:13.190 --> 03:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
this summarizes basically all we went
 
03:09:15.830 --> 03:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
over in terms of the major changes um
 
03:09:18.950 --> 03:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
there is that one adjustment that Nathan
 
03:09:21.910 --> 03:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
made earlier about that that we need to
 
03:09:24.710 --> 03:09:24.720 align:start position:0%
to correct the The netting out of the
 
03:09:27.590 --> 03:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
um the expense and the and and
 
03:09:30.030 --> 03:09:30.040 align:start position:0%
disclosing the revenue um but other than
 
03:09:32.830 --> 03:09:32.840 align:start position:0%
that that this is faithful to what we
 
03:09:35.190 --> 03:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
went over as being the major points so
 
03:09:37.229 --> 03:09:37.239 align:start position:0%
this kind of gives you a a cheat sheet
 
03:09:39.670 --> 03:09:39.680 align:start position:0%
if you will to looking at all the other
 
03:09:47.150 --> 03:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
items um and then um moving to page 22
 
03:09:47.160 --> 03:09:48.269 align:start position:0%
items um and then um moving to page 22
um

03:09:48.269 --> 03:09:48.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:09:51.469 --> 03:09:51.479 align:start position:0%
these are the support the the
 
03:09:53.710 --> 03:09:53.720 align:start position:0%
calculations that are um in the
 
03:09:56.510 --> 03:09:56.520 align:start position:0%
governor's budget um regarding the
 
03:09:59.110 --> 03:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
return to normal eligibility which is
 
03:10:01.750 --> 03:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
number one on this sheet and number five
 
03:10:05.630 --> 03:10:05.640 align:start position:0%
on the other um and and lays out the the
 
03:10:09.830 --> 03:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
calculations there slide 23 is just a
 
03:10:13.269 --> 03:10:13.279 align:start position:0%
picture of enrollment um if you go to
 
03:10:16.389 --> 03:10:16.399 align:start position:0%
the bottom of that page the grand total
 
03:10:18.070 --> 03:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
um the 17
 
03:10:22.269 --> 03:10:22.279 align:start position:0%
7420 is where we began the where we had
 
03:10:26.389 --> 03:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
enrollment as of March of 2020 and the
 
03:10:26.399 --> 03:10:27.910 align:start position:0%
enrollment as of March of 2020 and the
185

03:10:27.910 --> 03:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
185
 
03:10:32.110 --> 03:10:32.120 align:start position:0%
448 um was as of February 3rd so you can
 
03:10:34.670 --> 03:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
see at if you go to the top that we're
 
03:10:38.469 --> 03:10:38.479 align:start position:0%
within 0 4% of on the standard program
 
03:10:41.110 --> 03:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
um where we were pre pandemic and with
 
03:10:44.990 --> 03:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
granted Advantage we're 8580 or
 
03:10:48.190 --> 03:10:48.200 align:start position:0%
16.7% above where we are keep in mind
 
03:10:50.670 --> 03:10:50.680 align:start position:0%
the policy changes of continuous
 
03:10:52.950 --> 03:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
enrollment for children um the
 
03:10:54.750 --> 03:10:54.760 align:start position:0%
postpartum coverage of 12 months
 
03:10:57.110 --> 03:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
continuous enrollment and I think that
 
03:11:00.389 --> 03:11:00.399 align:start position:0%
what we've observed which
 
03:11:03.030 --> 03:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
um will come up in a number I'll point
 
03:11:05.510 --> 03:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
it out when we get to it um that we see
 
03:11:07.670 --> 03:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
more people using granted Advantage as
 
03:11:08.870 --> 03:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
the entry point when they have
 
03:11:12.550 --> 03:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
disability or or postpartum situation or
 
03:11:14.710 --> 03:11:14.720 align:start position:0%
um single parent because it's the
 
03:11:16.870 --> 03:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
easiest one to to be able to get the
 
03:11:18.269 --> 03:11:18.279 align:start position:0%
health coverage while you're waiting for
 
03:11:24.190 --> 03:11:24.200 align:start position:0%
other things to play out um slide uh 24
 
03:11:26.630 --> 03:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
is it gives you a a more a longer trend
 
03:11:28.510 --> 03:11:28.520 align:start position:0%
line looking at each of the major
 
03:11:32.910 --> 03:11:32.920 align:start position:0%
eligibility groups um again um be happy
 
03:11:35.229 --> 03:11:35.239 align:start position:0%
to answer questions offline if you have
 
03:11:38.429 --> 03:11:38.439 align:start position:0%
any on this um in the interest of time
 
03:11:40.910 --> 03:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
um just gives you a longer look at it
 
03:11:43.790 --> 03:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
the the low point which was sort of the
 
03:11:46.190 --> 03:11:46.200 align:start position:0%
end of all of our unwind activity
 
03:11:49.349 --> 03:11:49.359 align:start position:0%
largely was November um you can see how
 
03:11:51.030 --> 03:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
enrollment has changed in each of the
 
03:11:53.269 --> 03:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
eligibility groups over
 
03:11:56.510 --> 03:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
time um slide
 
03:11:59.150 --> 03:11:59.160 align:start position:0%
25 is uh
 
03:12:02.710 --> 03:12:02.720 align:start position:0%
the gives you a sort of a u a recap of
 
03:12:04.990 --> 03:12:05.000 align:start position:0%
what's allowable for premium and cost
 
03:12:10.349 --> 03:12:10.359 align:start position:0%
sharing um and picking up on page uh
 
03:12:15.190 --> 03:12:15.200 align:start position:0%
26 um is the number two on this sheet
 
03:12:18.950 --> 03:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
that was handed out earlier and
 
03:12:23.670 --> 03:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
um number um four on the sheet that
 
03:12:26.070 --> 03:12:26.080 align:start position:0%
Kevin handed out sorry for that
 
03:12:30.630 --> 03:12:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:33.790 --> 03:12:33.800 align:start position:0%
that um the and then the farmacy cost
 
03:12:36.429 --> 03:12:36.439 align:start position:0%
sharings on the bottom of that which is
 
03:12:39.590 --> 03:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy cost sharing is number uh four
 
03:12:41.950 --> 03:12:41.960 align:start position:0%
on the original sheet that was handed
 
03:12:44.950 --> 03:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
out and the pharmacy cost sharing is
 
03:12:47.870 --> 03:12:47.880 align:start position:0%
number one number one on the
 
03:12:52.550 --> 03:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
hb2 sheet if you will um then the
 
03:12:55.510 --> 03:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
granted Advantage premiums are on page
 
03:13:00.870 --> 03:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
27 um and that is uh number three on the
 
03:13:05.070 --> 03:13:05.080 align:start position:0%
hb2 kind of potential ones and then on
 
03:13:07.630 --> 03:13:07.640 align:start position:0%
the original sheet that was handed out
 
03:13:10.750 --> 03:13:10.760 align:start position:0%
um number five and that's you see the 12
 
03:13:12.590 --> 03:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
million is and just a little bit more
 
03:13:12.600 --> 03:13:14.070 align:start position:0%
million is and just a little bit more
description

03:13:14.070 --> 03:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
description
 
03:13:17.630 --> 03:13:17.640 align:start position:0%
there moving to slide 28
 
03:13:22.550 --> 03:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
um in the AA um 7937 the administration
 
03:13:23.870 --> 03:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
when I mentioned early on the
 
03:13:27.790 --> 03:13:27.800 align:start position:0%
presentation the 25% cut um uh that's
 
03:13:29.910 --> 03:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
just laying that out there and as I
 
03:13:31.349 --> 03:13:31.359 align:start position:0%
mentioned the ones we highlighted in
 
03:13:33.349 --> 03:13:33.359 align:start position:0%
green are the ones that have a a great
 
03:13:35.670 --> 03:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
Roi for the state in terms of the the
 
03:13:37.510 --> 03:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
spending um in terms of whether it's
 
03:13:39.670 --> 03:13:39.680 align:start position:0%
drug rebates or making sure the state's
 
03:13:41.750 --> 03:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
getting what it's supposed to out of its
 
03:13:43.790 --> 03:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
um you know return on the Managed Care
 
03:13:43.800 --> 03:13:45.510 align:start position:0%
um you know return on the Managed Care
contracts

03:13:45.510 --> 03:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
contracts
 
03:13:51.510 --> 03:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
um and then um page 29 is the um the
 
03:13:56.630 --> 03:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
lowest net cost on the drugs which is um
 
03:13:58.710 --> 03:13:58.720 align:start position:0%
number three on the sheet that was
 
03:14:02.150 --> 03:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
passed out originally
 
03:14:06.349 --> 03:14:06.359 align:start position:0%
and that's already in hp2 um this one on
 
03:14:10.590 --> 03:14:10.600 align:start position:0%
page 29 is the one that is in hp2
 
03:14:13.190 --> 03:14:13.200 align:start position:0%
already and the reason that the dollar
 
03:14:16.670 --> 03:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
figure changes from year to year there's
 
03:14:18.870 --> 03:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
because people are already on drugs and
 
03:14:20.670 --> 03:14:20.680 align:start position:0%
things like that that it's going to take
 
03:14:22.870 --> 03:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
some time to migrate to get savings we
 
03:14:24.590 --> 03:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
actually think the savings will actually
 
03:14:27.910 --> 03:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
increase in 28 um because it takes some
 
03:14:30.190 --> 03:14:30.200 align:start position:0%
time to work through um you just don't
 
03:14:32.150 --> 03:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
want to tell someone you know change a
 
03:14:34.870 --> 03:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
drug that they're stable on so that's
 
03:14:38.469 --> 03:14:38.479 align:start position:0%
that's uh why we um and we also
 
03:14:40.110 --> 03:14:40.120 align:start position:0%
reference the Senate bill that addresses
 
03:14:40.120 --> 03:14:41.269 align:start position:0%
reference the Senate bill that addresses
this

03:14:41.269 --> 03:14:41.279 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:14:41.279 --> 03:14:42.950 align:start position:0%
this
too

03:14:42.950 --> 03:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
too
 
03:14:47.070 --> 03:14:47.080 align:start position:0%
um slide 30 it's just the trend in the
 
03:14:50.229 --> 03:14:50.239 align:start position:0%
Medicaid enhancement tax I think we
 
03:14:55.269 --> 03:14:55.279 align:start position:0%
um have seen um that uh grow at 348 was
 
03:14:57.590 --> 03:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
the number that was the preliminary
 
03:15:01.429 --> 03:15:01.439 align:start position:0%
estimate which um is increase from 319
 
03:15:07.429 --> 03:15:07.439 align:start position:0%
in in uh the prior year 24 um and you
 
03:15:09.630 --> 03:15:09.640 align:start position:0%
know we had a we've had mostly the
 
03:15:11.590 --> 03:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
preliminary estimate has been accurate
 
03:15:13.950 --> 03:15:13.960 align:start position:0%
except for the pandemic height of the
 
03:15:18.229 --> 03:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
pandemic um and then on page 31 a little
 
03:15:21.510 --> 03:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
bit explanation of the met and the
 
03:15:23.950 --> 03:15:23.960 align:start position:0%
directed payments and the uncompensated
 
03:15:26.150 --> 03:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
care payments and just an example at the
 
03:15:30.150 --> 03:15:30.160 align:start position:0%
bottom of how you know um $10 million
 
03:15:32.550 --> 03:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
can generate different levels based uh
 
03:15:34.710 --> 03:15:34.720 align:start position:0%
based on a straight match of 50/50
 
03:15:38.990 --> 03:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:43.070 --> 03:15:43.080 align:start position:0%
match um page
 
03:15:43.080 --> 03:15:45.189 align:start position:0%
match um page
uh

03:15:45.189 --> 03:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:15:50.469 --> 03:15:50.479 align:start position:0%
32 um is basically the the the current
 
03:15:55.550 --> 03:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
um way that uh the sort of the Met is
 
03:15:57.349 --> 03:15:57.359 align:start position:0%
deployed in
 
03:16:00.790 --> 03:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
the in the budget if you will um so
 
03:16:02.950 --> 03:16:02.960 align:start position:0%
there's you got the 25 year which is the
 
03:16:05.389 --> 03:16:05.399 align:start position:0%
current year that we're in under the 80%
 
03:16:09.830 --> 03:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
plan um then you get what 26 is based on
 
03:16:13.510 --> 03:16:13.520 align:start position:0%
estimates that were originally produced
 
03:16:16.910 --> 03:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
as we can see already in 25 that um the
 
03:16:18.070 --> 03:16:18.080 align:start position:0%
the 26 years has already been
 
03:16:21.349 --> 03:16:21.359 align:start position:0%
outperformed and um we're at
 
03:16:24.750 --> 03:16:24.760 align:start position:0%
348 and and the non-binding estimate so
 
03:16:26.750 --> 03:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
hopefully this helps a little bit with
 
03:16:28.750 --> 03:16:28.760 align:start position:0%
the reconciliation of where the dollars
 
03:16:28.760 --> 03:16:30.189 align:start position:0%
the reconciliation of where the dollars
are

03:16:30.189 --> 03:16:30.199 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:16:33.790 --> 03:16:33.800 align:start position:0%
moving um page 33 is an explanation of
 
03:16:37.070 --> 03:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
state phase down um that you can walk
 
03:16:37.080 --> 03:16:38.030 align:start position:0%
state phase down um that you can walk
away

03:16:38.030 --> 03:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
away
 
03:16:40.469 --> 03:16:40.479 align:start position:0%
with and then the number I quoted
 
03:16:43.030 --> 03:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
earlier 273 is currently what we're
 
03:16:43.040 --> 03:16:49.150 align:start position:0%
earlier 273 is currently what we're
paying

03:16:49.150 --> 03:16:49.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:52.030 --> 03:16:52.040 align:start position:0%
um page
 
03:16:56.150 --> 03:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
34 is um request that I think came from
 
03:16:56.160 --> 03:16:57.590 align:start position:0%
34 is um request that I think came from
the

03:16:57.590 --> 03:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:17:00.590 --> 03:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
chair to look at what has been added to
 
03:17:03.349 --> 03:17:03.359 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid Program in terms of
 
03:17:04.910 --> 03:17:04.920 align:start position:0%
services and
 
03:17:08.429 --> 03:17:08.439 align:start position:0%
eligibility we do have a handout that we
 
03:17:11.510 --> 03:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
can leave with you we there's a bit of
 
03:17:14.870 --> 03:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
work that has to be done to compile that
 
03:17:16.189 --> 03:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
I think we've got all the changes we
 
03:17:18.110 --> 03:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
haven't got all the dollar put together
 
03:17:20.830 --> 03:17:20.840 align:start position:0%
yet but we can leave that with you and
 
03:17:22.590 --> 03:17:22.600 align:start position:0%
answer any questions on that that would
 
03:17:24.070 --> 03:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
be great and then it can be posted to
 
03:17:27.070 --> 03:17:27.080 align:start position:0%
our website of information perfect y if
 
03:17:29.309 --> 03:17:29.319 align:start position:0%
we could just put it will be updated and
 
03:17:32.630 --> 03:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
we'd like to replace it when it's fully
 
03:17:34.309 --> 03:17:34.319 align:start position:0%
um but at least you can see all the
 
03:17:36.830 --> 03:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
changes sure and we also provide the
 
03:17:38.950 --> 03:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
statutory reference whether it's state
 
03:17:40.910 --> 03:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
or Fe or
 
03:17:46.189 --> 03:17:46.199 align:start position:0%
federal excellent thank you um page 35
 
03:17:50.030 --> 03:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
is the medic K schools program and sort
 
03:17:53.710 --> 03:17:53.720 align:start position:0%
of reviewing what it is um the issue of
 
03:17:55.150 --> 03:17:55.160 align:start position:0%
transitioning to a
 
03:17:58.429 --> 03:17:58.439 align:start position:0%
different um claiming methodology and
 
03:18:00.830 --> 03:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
what a um while we talk about schools
 
03:18:00.840 --> 03:18:01.790 align:start position:0%
what a um while we talk about schools
it's

03:18:01.790 --> 03:18:01.800 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:18:04.349 --> 03:18:04.359 align:start position:0%
really Medicaid's built on local
 
03:18:06.830 --> 03:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
Education Agency which can in a town
 
03:18:08.150 --> 03:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
that has multiple schools can be
 
03:18:10.309 --> 03:18:10.319 align:start position:0%
multiple schools can be like Manchester
 
03:18:12.710 --> 03:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
example versus another town may only
 
03:18:15.030 --> 03:18:15.040 align:start position:0%
have one school or two schools so
 
03:18:18.229 --> 03:18:18.239 align:start position:0%
they're all different sizes but the unit
 
03:18:22.790 --> 03:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
that gets paid the dollars is an Lea
 
03:18:27.070 --> 03:18:27.080 align:start position:0%
um and then lastly um um uh following
 
03:18:29.269 --> 03:18:29.279 align:start position:0%
that is on page
 
03:18:34.750 --> 03:18:34.760 align:start position:0%
36 is what uh the participation has
 
03:18:38.189 --> 03:18:38.199 align:start position:0%
been and how it's changed over the
 
03:18:41.389 --> 03:18:41.399 align:start position:0%
years um the the number ones that are to
 
03:18:42.950 --> 03:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
the right of some of the dollar figures
 
03:18:45.990 --> 03:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
there are the fact that there was also
 
03:18:47.870 --> 03:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
the Federal match the enhanced Federal
 
03:18:49.670 --> 03:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
match that was available at one point it
 
03:18:53.150 --> 03:18:53.160 align:start position:0%
was instead of 50% it was 56.2% that
 
03:18:54.469 --> 03:18:54.479 align:start position:0%
that was passed on directly to the
 
03:18:56.269 --> 03:18:56.279 align:start position:0%
school so these numbers don't include
 
03:18:59.110 --> 03:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
that additional amount but you can see
 
03:19:02.630 --> 03:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
the program has shrunk um over over time
 
03:19:04.950 --> 03:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
and I think there's a real opportunity
 
03:19:07.790 --> 03:19:07.800 align:start position:0%
to um changing this methodology and
 
03:19:10.830 --> 03:19:10.840 align:start position:0%
hopefully with the the grant to um
 
03:19:13.110 --> 03:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
provide more resources to schools and I
 
03:19:14.630 --> 03:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
think also we need to look at how
 
03:19:17.309 --> 03:19:17.319 align:start position:0%
special ed and and Medicaid schools
 
03:19:19.070 --> 03:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
connect in terms of dollars that are
 
03:19:22.469 --> 03:19:22.479 align:start position:0%
available federally versus um and but I
 
03:19:26.389 --> 03:19:26.399 align:start position:0%
know that isn't a a two-e
 
03:19:30.110 --> 03:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
exercise turning to um representative
 
03:19:33.910 --> 03:19:33.920 align:start position:0%
tarki for a question thank you before we
 
03:19:37.590 --> 03:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
if the next slide is the potential
 
03:19:39.269 --> 03:19:39.279 align:start position:0%
Federal implications which I think could
 
03:19:41.110 --> 03:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
probably give us another four hours on a
 
03:19:45.229 --> 03:19:45.239 align:start position:0%
different day but before we go there um
 
03:19:47.309 --> 03:19:47.319 align:start position:0%
page 893
 
03:19:49.830 --> 03:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
of the governor's budget which I think
 
03:19:54.110 --> 03:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
is the bottom line for Medicaid the 1.3
 
03:19:56.070 --> 03:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
billion the
 
03:20:01.150 --> 03:20:01.160 align:start position:0%
1.3 billion yes um when I look at the
 
03:20:03.950 --> 03:20:03.960 align:start position:0%
2025 adjusted
 
03:20:08.389 --> 03:20:08.399 align:start position:0%
authorized then go over to the 2026
 
03:20:11.150 --> 03:20:11.160 align:start position:0%
recommended I figured it's a difference
 
03:20:14.429 --> 03:20:14.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:17.309 --> 03:20:17.319 align:start position:0%
m696 64
 
03:20:19.110 --> 03:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
and I don't expect an answer to this
 
03:20:20.670 --> 03:20:20.680 align:start position:0%
question but I'm wondering if there
 
03:20:23.950 --> 03:20:23.960 align:start position:0%
could be some kind of graphic or chart
 
03:20:26.830 --> 03:20:26.840 align:start position:0%
that can be produced that tells
 
03:20:30.030 --> 03:20:30.040 align:start position:0%
us what is that what is going away with
 
03:20:31.429 --> 03:20:31.439 align:start position:0%
that $71
 
03:20:34.870 --> 03:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
million what's how did we get there in
 
03:20:36.950 --> 03:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
very sort of simple words if I'm going
 
03:20:39.710 --> 03:20:39.720 align:start position:0%
to have to explain it to my
 
03:20:43.150 --> 03:20:43.160 align:start position:0%
constituents so I I I think the first
 
03:20:44.910 --> 03:20:44.920 align:start position:0%
thing that's important to think about
 
03:20:47.110 --> 03:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
when looking at that is is you're not
 
03:20:49.269 --> 03:20:49.279 align:start position:0%
comparing the same numbers so you're
 
03:20:51.389 --> 03:20:51.399 align:start position:0%
comparing the adjusted authorized amount
 
03:20:53.910 --> 03:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
and not necessarily the budget amount
 
03:20:56.030 --> 03:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
and so the adjusted authorized amount
 
03:20:58.710 --> 03:20:58.720 align:start position:0%
includes that $94 million of carry
 
03:21:00.830 --> 03:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
forward that we were referring to
 
03:21:03.469 --> 03:21:03.479 align:start position:0%
earlier but one thing that we could do
 
03:21:05.269 --> 03:21:05.279 align:start position:0%
is we could look at what was
 
03:21:08.550 --> 03:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
appropriated by hb1 and the current bium
 
03:21:10.910 --> 03:21:10.920 align:start position:0%
we can add in the hb2 we can try to add
 
03:21:13.349 --> 03:21:13.359 align:start position:0%
in the hp2 and maybe the state fiscal
 
03:21:15.830 --> 03:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
year 24 legislation impacting that as
 
03:21:18.469 --> 03:21:18.479 align:start position:0%
well and then kind of crosswalk that and
 
03:21:20.550 --> 03:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
then there's a table I think it was back
 
03:21:22.910 --> 03:21:22.920 align:start position:0%
on page 21 that we could try to
 
03:21:24.710 --> 03:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
incorporate in there as well so you can
 
03:21:26.150 --> 03:21:26.160 align:start position:0%
you can kind of see what are the
 
03:21:28.150 --> 03:21:28.160 align:start position:0%
differences I think another really
 
03:21:30.630 --> 03:21:30.640 align:start position:0%
important um feature here is when we
 
03:21:32.790 --> 03:21:32.800 align:start position:0%
build our budget it's we we work with
 
03:21:35.269 --> 03:21:35.279 align:start position:0%
the actuaries to really look in look
 
03:21:37.590 --> 03:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
into the details to try to project as
 
03:21:39.750 --> 03:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
accurately as possible what the needs
 
03:21:41.630 --> 03:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
are what the capitation rate is going to
 
03:21:44.110 --> 03:21:44.120 align:start position:0%
be and what the total expenses uh will
 
03:21:46.630 --> 03:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
be as well so we can work on trying to
 
03:21:48.389 --> 03:21:48.399 align:start position:0%
crosswalk this and and get something
 
03:21:49.790 --> 03:21:49.800 align:start position:0%
that makes a little bit more sense
 
03:21:51.110 --> 03:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
because I don't think adjusted authorize
 
03:21:53.349 --> 03:21:53.359 align:start position:0%
is always the best sort of compar
 
03:21:56.030 --> 03:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
comparative point I thank you for that
 
03:21:58.110 --> 03:21:58.120 align:start position:0%
and I understand this is so super
 
03:21:59.870 --> 03:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
complicated which is why I'm trying to
 
03:22:01.870 --> 03:22:01.880 align:start position:0%
figure out how to actually be able to
 
03:22:03.510 --> 03:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
communicate it to someone who hasn't
 
03:22:05.950 --> 03:22:05.960 align:start position:0%
been sitting in this committee room um
 
03:22:07.429 --> 03:22:07.439 align:start position:0%
because I think what I'm hearing is
 
03:22:09.309 --> 03:22:09.319 align:start position:0%
people are really concerned and they're
 
03:22:11.429 --> 03:22:11.439 align:start position:0%
really concerned about what this budget
 
03:22:13.750 --> 03:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
potentially could mean um for their
 
03:22:15.429 --> 03:22:15.439 align:start position:0%
day-to-day lives and caring for their
 
03:22:18.429 --> 03:22:18.439 align:start position:0%
families we want to be supportive of
 
03:22:21.550 --> 03:22:21.560 align:start position:0%
making it clear as we can and so we will
 
03:22:23.790 --> 03:22:23.800 align:start position:0%
we will provide thank you support you in
 
03:22:23.800 --> 03:22:25.710 align:start position:0%
we will provide thank you support you in
that

03:22:25.710 --> 03:22:25.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:22:25.720 --> 03:22:27.830 align:start position:0%
that
regard

03:22:27.830 --> 03:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
regard
 
03:22:31.070 --> 03:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
um so on
 
03:22:37.030 --> 03:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
page 38 um we've identified some of
 
03:22:40.110 --> 03:22:40.120 align:start position:0%
the representative priest for a question
 
03:22:42.870 --> 03:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
thank you uh going along with um my
 
03:22:44.990 --> 03:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
fellow representative representative
 
03:22:45.000 --> 03:22:47.630 align:start position:0%
fellow representative representative
triski

03:22:47.630 --> 03:22:47.640 align:start position:0%
triski
 
03:22:51.950 --> 03:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
given the time and given
 
03:22:54.309 --> 03:22:54.319 align:start position:0%
the important
 
03:22:57.150 --> 03:22:57.160 align:start position:0%
nature of federal
 
03:23:00.110 --> 03:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
initiatives and potential budget in cuts
 
03:23:03.429 --> 03:23:03.439 align:start position:0%
and what's happening now in Washington I
 
03:23:06.990 --> 03:23:07.000 align:start position:0%
think we should dedicate a time just to
 
03:23:08.870 --> 03:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
talk this
 
03:23:11.229 --> 03:23:11.239 align:start position:0%
through because things could change
 
03:23:14.870 --> 03:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:19.870 --> 03:23:19.880 align:start position:0%
week okay uh my thought there is that we
 
03:23:22.790 --> 03:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
have bookings essentially for work
 
03:23:26.550 --> 03:23:26.560 align:start position:0%
sessions until March 11th is that right
 
03:23:28.990 --> 03:23:29.000 align:start position:0%
Mr Ripple is March 11th the last
 
03:23:30.990 --> 03:23:31.000 align:start position:0%
scheduled day it's the last scheduled
 
03:23:32.389 --> 03:23:32.399 align:start position:0%
work session I believe we're going to
 
03:23:33.910 --> 03:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
add the uh prescription drug
 
03:23:35.950 --> 03:23:35.960 align:start position:0%
affordability board to the 12th so there
 
03:23:37.590 --> 03:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
will be one more after
 
03:23:40.910 --> 03:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
that okay um let's see what we can do
 
03:23:43.630 --> 03:23:43.640 align:start position:0%
about adding we have nothing next Friday
 
03:23:46.429 --> 03:23:46.439 align:start position:0%
and I think if we have and we could
 
03:23:48.910 --> 03:23:48.920 align:start position:0%
posted in the next journal
 
03:23:51.990 --> 03:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
what um I mean that's just an an idea to
 
03:23:55.429 --> 03:23:55.439 align:start position:0%
throw out yes understood uh my thought
 
03:24:01.429 --> 03:24:01.439 align:start position:0%
is uh perhaps we add it to the final the
 
03:24:04.910 --> 03:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
prescription topic on what day is that
 
03:24:08.110 --> 03:24:08.120 align:start position:0%
Mr Ripple that'll be on March 12th
 
03:24:12.070 --> 03:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
possibly on March 12th possibly so let's
 
03:24:13.950 --> 03:24:13.960 align:start position:0%
uh keep that in
 
03:24:17.950 --> 03:24:17.960 align:start position:0%
mind okay yeah given the uh
 
03:24:20.550 --> 03:24:20.560 align:start position:0%
intensity of the subject matter today
 
03:24:22.670 --> 03:24:22.680 align:start position:0%
it's it's really amazing that you
 
03:24:26.750 --> 03:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
can continue for Four Stall it hours
 
03:24:28.630 --> 03:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
you've done a fantastic job you and your
 
03:24:30.710 --> 03:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
team uh and but again it just
 
03:24:34.429 --> 03:24:34.439 align:start position:0%
demonstrates just how detailed and um
 
03:24:38.269 --> 03:24:38.279 align:start position:0%
extensive this topic is okay so um
 
03:24:40.630 --> 03:24:40.640 align:start position:0%
without uh keeping in mind what was just
 
03:24:45.469 --> 03:24:45.479 align:start position:0%
discussed I think uh um on page um 38 I
 
03:24:47.510 --> 03:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
think those are all things if any of any
 
03:24:50.229 --> 03:24:50.239 align:start position:0%
one of those come into place um there's
 
03:24:52.950 --> 03:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
Major Impact on on budget and and
 
03:24:56.750 --> 03:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
coverages and so forth um the work
 
03:25:01.110 --> 03:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
requirement um is um a piece of
 
03:25:03.590 --> 03:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
legislation that uh the reason I bring
 
03:25:07.309 --> 03:25:07.319 align:start position:0%
it up here is if there's an active um
 
03:25:09.750 --> 03:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
bill in the Senate that has passed
 
03:25:13.030 --> 03:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
committee um it um directs the
 
03:25:15.269 --> 03:25:15.279 align:start position:0%
department to implement what was
 
03:25:18.309 --> 03:25:18.319 align:start position:0%
previously um
 
03:25:23.030 --> 03:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
um vacated by the court and um ended by
 
03:25:25.870 --> 03:25:25.880 align:start position:0%
um but I think part of the things that
 
03:25:28.790 --> 03:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
might happen as part U at the state
 
03:25:30.550 --> 03:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
level but also at the federal level
 
03:25:32.950 --> 03:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
there could be a change in policy there
 
03:25:35.630 --> 03:25:35.640 align:start position:0%
um and what I wanted to point out
 
03:25:38.910 --> 03:25:38.920 align:start position:0%
because it's a financial item is that um
 
03:25:41.469 --> 03:25:41.479 align:start position:0%
because it was the all the work that we
 
03:25:46.469 --> 03:25:46.479 align:start position:0%
did it wise um we we maintained it but
 
03:25:49.150 --> 03:25:49.160 align:start position:0%
if we were required to implement it
 
03:25:51.189 --> 03:25:51.199 align:start position:0%
exactly as it is today and it is in
 
03:25:52.550 --> 03:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
statute today
 
03:25:56.590 --> 03:25:56.600 align:start position:0%
already um there because it was ended
 
03:25:58.910 --> 03:25:58.920 align:start position:0%
and vacated we did not keep it in sync
 
03:26:00.590 --> 03:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
with everything else there would be a
 
03:26:03.269 --> 03:26:03.279 align:start position:0%
cost which we identify as about 1.7
 
03:26:05.870 --> 03:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
million in total funds to be able to get
 
03:26:07.710 --> 03:26:07.720 align:start position:0%
it back in sync with the
 
03:26:11.269 --> 03:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
system beyond that I think there's also
 
03:26:14.830 --> 03:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
a need to look at what Congress says
 
03:26:18.110 --> 03:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
about it they may create an easier path
 
03:26:20.150 --> 03:26:20.160 align:start position:0%
they may create uh the new
 
03:26:21.790 --> 03:26:21.800 align:start position:0%
Administration May create different
 
03:26:24.309 --> 03:26:24.319 align:start position:0%
standards than the previous
 
03:26:27.429 --> 03:26:27.439 align:start position:0%
administration so um what I'm trying to
 
03:26:30.389 --> 03:26:30.399 align:start position:0%
alert you to is just passing and saying
 
03:26:32.950 --> 03:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
us to do it again is not a free item
 
03:26:35.990 --> 03:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
that there there is going to be a cost
 
03:26:38.750 --> 03:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
associated with that um
 
03:26:42.150 --> 03:26:42.160 align:start position:0%
whether um what that would be is I'm
 
03:26:44.030 --> 03:26:44.040 align:start position:0%
just alerting to you to that it's not
 
03:26:46.550 --> 03:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
just resubmit and there's the and just
 
03:26:49.229 --> 03:26:49.239 align:start position:0%
start it up again they their it costs
 
03:26:51.710 --> 03:26:51.720 align:start position:0%
and then they also possibly possibly
 
03:26:55.389 --> 03:26:55.399 align:start position:0%
Staffing costs to administer it um so
 
03:26:58.429 --> 03:26:58.439 align:start position:0%
just to um add to what you're saying
 
03:27:02.070 --> 03:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
that Senate Bill 134 yes currently I see
 
03:27:04.950 --> 03:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
the docket right now and it looks as
 
03:27:07.710 --> 03:27:07.720 align:start position:0%
though it's in the Senate yes it has
 
03:27:09.630 --> 03:27:09.640 align:start position:0%
reported out of committee ought to pass
 
03:27:11.950 --> 03:27:11.960 align:start position:0%
with Amendment so I would encourage
 
03:27:14.790 --> 03:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
everyone to look at the amendment number
 
03:27:18.189 --> 03:27:18.199 align:start position:0%
0401 lower case s which essentially
 
03:27:21.030 --> 03:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
replaces the bill it came out of uh the
 
03:27:24.750 --> 03:27:24.760 align:start position:0%
senate committee 3-2 and it looks like
 
03:27:27.990 --> 03:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
it's to be determined on the house on
 
03:27:30.590 --> 03:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
the senate floor yes the the amendment
 
03:27:33.309 --> 03:27:33.319 align:start position:0%
effectively they had us having to submit
 
03:27:36.269 --> 03:27:36.279 align:start position:0%
it by July 1 which is pretty unrealistic
 
03:27:38.349 --> 03:27:38.359 align:start position:0%
if the legislative session goes to you
 
03:27:41.349 --> 03:27:41.359 align:start position:0%
know June and a budget year um and they
 
03:27:45.030 --> 03:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
changed the date to January 1st of uh 20
 
03:27:47.309 --> 03:27:47.319 align:start position:0%
um six would be the date that we'd have
 
03:27:49.229 --> 03:27:49.239 align:start position:0%
to submit it so that was the major
 
03:27:52.110 --> 03:27:52.120 align:start position:0%
change that I think is the
 
03:27:55.309 --> 03:27:55.319 align:start position:0%
amendment and okay um just identifying
 
03:27:58.269 --> 03:27:58.279 align:start position:0%
just on the side here I'm sure it's a
 
03:28:00.910 --> 03:28:00.920 align:start position:0%
bill that probably would need to an FN
 
03:28:04.269 --> 03:28:04.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:08.150 --> 03:28:08.160 align:start position:0%
ultimately um and then slide um just
 
03:28:10.870 --> 03:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
representative elano for question just a
 
03:28:13.030 --> 03:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
very quick question and because I
 
03:28:14.590 --> 03:28:14.600 align:start position:0%
haven't paid attention to this over the
 
03:28:16.630 --> 03:28:16.640 align:start position:0%
years I've lived here but didn't we have
 
03:28:20.110 --> 03:28:20.120 align:start position:0%
a work requirement at one other point in
 
03:28:22.830 --> 03:28:22.840 align:start position:0%
our history so in
 
03:28:25.030 --> 03:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
2018 um s SP
 
03:28:28.469 --> 03:28:28.479 align:start position:0%
313 um required us to apply for a waiver
 
03:28:30.990 --> 03:28:31.000 align:start position:0%
for work requirement we applied for it
 
03:28:33.950 --> 03:28:33.960 align:start position:0%
received it and started to implement it
 
03:28:36.750 --> 03:28:36.760 align:start position:0%
and then um the court um here in New
 
03:28:38.790 --> 03:28:38.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and if you look at the next
 
03:28:40.910 --> 03:28:40.920 align:start position:0%
page um there's a map in the United
 
03:28:44.429 --> 03:28:44.439 align:start position:0%
States uh colorcoded of which states had
 
03:28:48.110 --> 03:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
an approval and um and which states were
 
03:28:50.630 --> 03:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
denied um and then on the right hand
 
03:28:54.710 --> 03:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
side is a recap on Georgia currently
 
03:28:57.070 --> 03:28:57.080 align:start position:0%
um based on I think the district court
 
03:28:58.990 --> 03:28:59.000 align:start position:0%
in that area were able to implement
 
03:29:01.229 --> 03:29:01.239 align:start position:0%
something they're making some changes
 
03:29:03.429 --> 03:29:03.439 align:start position:0%
Arkansas which New Hampshire and
 
03:29:05.429 --> 03:29:05.439 align:start position:0%
Arkansas were approved around the same
 
03:29:08.349 --> 03:29:08.359 align:start position:0%
month I believe um Arkansas is is going
 
03:29:10.349 --> 03:29:10.359 align:start position:0%
back as well
 
03:29:12.910 --> 03:29:12.920 align:start position:0%
um we could certainly spend more time on
 
03:29:17.189 --> 03:29:17.199 align:start position:0%
this topic if uh if in fact it has
 
03:29:20.070 --> 03:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
um approval here and if there's Federal
 
03:29:24.550 --> 03:29:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:29.550 --> 03:29:29.560 align:start position:0%
41 and um is basically some statistics
 
03:29:33.429 --> 03:29:33.439 align:start position:0%
uh produced by the Kaiser Foundation um
 
03:29:35.870 --> 03:29:35.880 align:start position:0%
over a couple of year time frame that
 
03:29:37.870 --> 03:29:37.880 align:start position:0%
gives you some sense of what who's
 
03:29:40.750 --> 03:29:40.760 align:start position:0%
working that's in the Medicaid Program
 
03:29:43.070 --> 03:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
our work at the height of the pandemic
 
03:29:46.670 --> 03:29:46.680 align:start position:0%
when granted Advantage was like 97,000
 
03:29:48.790 --> 03:29:48.800 align:start position:0%
uh uh uh enrollment the number of people
 
03:29:52.510 --> 03:29:52.520 align:start position:0%
working was at 70% today it's uh it's
 
03:29:54.510 --> 03:29:54.520 align:start position:0%
less than that it's around the US
 
03:29:58.110 --> 03:29:58.120 align:start position:0%
average a little bit better um but this
 
03:30:00.950 --> 03:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
gives you some sense of in the you know
 
03:30:03.870 --> 03:30:03.880 align:start position:0%
from a a secondary source of what what
 
03:30:07.510 --> 03:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
it looks like in New Hampshire today um
 
03:30:10.630 --> 03:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
the next two slides um on page
 
03:30:15.790 --> 03:30:15.800 align:start position:0%
42 and 43 42 is an example of looking at
 
03:30:15.800 --> 03:30:17.110 align:start position:0%
42 and 43 42 is an example of looking at
the

03:30:17.110 --> 03:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:30:19.630 --> 03:30:19.640 align:start position:0%
the two populations by who was enrolled
 
03:30:21.870 --> 03:30:21.880 align:start position:0%
in a given month these these numbers a
 
03:30:22.950 --> 03:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
little bit higher than you've seen
 
03:30:25.349 --> 03:30:25.359 align:start position:0%
earlier because we're looking at anybody
 
03:30:28.469 --> 03:30:28.479 align:start position:0%
who is enrolled during the month um but
 
03:30:31.309 --> 03:30:31.319 align:start position:0%
that's just sort of the trend there um
 
03:30:33.910 --> 03:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
from for going all the way back to 2014
 
03:30:37.309 --> 03:30:37.319 align:start position:0%
to to fiscal year 25 just to give you a
 
03:30:39.830 --> 03:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
sense of what's been happening in the
 
03:30:39.840 --> 03:30:41.590 align:start position:0%
sense of what's been happening in the
program

03:30:41.590 --> 03:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
program
 
03:30:44.750 --> 03:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
um globally then on page 43 was a point
 
03:30:48.030 --> 03:30:48.040 align:start position:0%
I was trying to make earlier is that um
 
03:30:50.429 --> 03:30:50.439 align:start position:0%
you can see that people with adults with
 
03:30:53.030 --> 03:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
disabilities parent parenting adults and
 
03:30:56.269 --> 03:30:56.279 align:start position:0%
Pregnant postpartum women that there are
 
03:31:00.150 --> 03:31:00.160 align:start position:0%
uh fewer because we believe that they're
 
03:31:02.269 --> 03:31:02.279 align:start position:0%
taking advantage of the the opportunity
 
03:31:03.670 --> 03:31:03.680 align:start position:0%
to get health care sooner by going
 
03:31:06.389 --> 03:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
directly to granted Advantage if that
 
03:31:09.269 --> 03:31:09.279 align:start position:0%
were to the the issue here right for the
 
03:31:11.189 --> 03:31:11.199 align:start position:0%
state from a financial standpoint when
 
03:31:13.110 --> 03:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
they're in granted Advantage it's a 90%
 
03:31:15.189 --> 03:31:15.199 align:start position:0%
Federal match when they go back to a
 
03:31:18.309 --> 03:31:18.319 align:start position:0%
standard program we Dro to a 50% match
 
03:31:21.630 --> 03:31:21.640 align:start position:0%
and so you know there's a factor to
 
03:31:24.429 --> 03:31:24.439 align:start position:0%
consider in terms of what the net cost
 
03:31:28.670 --> 03:31:28.680 align:start position:0%
of ending um expansion would be in terms
 
03:31:32.150 --> 03:31:32.160 align:start position:0%
of um on the state directly as well as
 
03:31:34.469 --> 03:31:34.479 align:start position:0%
the insurance
 
03:31:36.830 --> 03:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
markets and
 
03:31:40.790 --> 03:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
um moving to page 45 uh this is sort of
 
03:31:42.990 --> 03:31:43.000 align:start position:0%
the appendix but we had one prioritized
 
03:31:45.349 --> 03:31:45.359 align:start position:0%
need that got approved which is uh
 
03:31:48.469 --> 03:31:48.479 align:start position:0%
project walk program which is a
 
03:31:51.990 --> 03:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
individuals who um have issues with
 
03:31:55.110 --> 03:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
Mobility where generally the medical
 
03:31:58.429 --> 03:31:58.439 align:start position:0%
rehab um wouldn't provide any further
 
03:32:01.990 --> 03:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
supports to help them um be able to be
 
03:32:04.150 --> 03:32:04.160 align:start position:0%
more mobile that this takes them a
 
03:32:08.309 --> 03:32:08.319 align:start position:0%
little bit further um it's uh something
 
03:32:10.990 --> 03:32:11.000 align:start position:0%
that uh was started in
 
03:32:16.590 --> 03:32:16.600 align:start position:0%
um I guess the end of 20 24 in um it's
 
03:32:19.189 --> 03:32:19.199 align:start position:0%
continued in in this uh in the
 
03:32:22.710 --> 03:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:27.670 --> 03:32:27.680 align:start position:0%
um um in page um 46 and
 
03:32:32.710 --> 03:32:32.720 align:start position:0%
47 46 is a a slide we've used to sort of
 
03:32:34.870 --> 03:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
um lay out all the things that we did in
 
03:32:38.790 --> 03:32:38.800 align:start position:0%
on one page to help with uh you know
 
03:32:40.950 --> 03:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
keeping keeping people covered who could
 
03:32:43.309 --> 03:32:43.319 align:start position:0%
who were eligible and and supporting
 
03:32:46.030 --> 03:32:46.040 align:start position:0%
those who weren't um but the the overall
 
03:32:48.469 --> 03:32:48.479 align:start position:0%
statistics of the unwind are what you
 
03:32:52.870 --> 03:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
find on page 47 um and the grand total
 
03:32:55.630 --> 03:32:55.640 align:start position:0%
of the sort of the flesh tone colored
 
03:32:57.830 --> 03:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
line is
 
03:33:01.910 --> 03:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
um people who um retain coverage was
 
03:33:03.269 --> 03:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
just under
 
03:33:07.790 --> 03:33:07.800 align:start position:0%
70% um in total but what we saw is that
 
03:33:09.790 --> 03:33:09.800 align:start position:0%
the people who were what we call the
 
03:33:12.030 --> 03:33:12.040 align:start position:0%
protected group those were people who
 
03:33:13.429 --> 03:33:13.439 align:start position:0%
protected in the sense that they had
 
03:33:15.349 --> 03:33:15.359 align:start position:0%
continuous coverage through that 4-year
 
03:33:15.359 --> 03:33:16.429 align:start position:0%
continuous coverage through that 4-year
period

03:33:16.429 --> 03:33:16.439 align:start position:0%
period
 
03:33:18.750 --> 03:33:18.760 align:start position:0%
um up to the 4-year period that they
 
03:33:22.990 --> 03:33:23.000 align:start position:0%
renewed at a much lower level than um
 
03:33:27.510 --> 03:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
the individuals who um were under the
 
03:33:31.150 --> 03:33:31.160 align:start position:0%
under had come on more recently and you
 
03:33:32.790 --> 03:33:32.800 align:start position:0%
know we're seeing there that they
 
03:33:35.830 --> 03:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
renewed at a rate of almost 84% if we
 
03:33:37.150 --> 03:33:37.160 align:start position:0%
were looking at some more current
 
03:33:40.030 --> 03:33:40.040 align:start position:0%
statistics we'd actually see with the
 
03:33:43.110 --> 03:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
expart renewal flexibilities that we're
 
03:33:45.429 --> 03:33:45.439 align:start position:0%
seeing a renewal rate approaching n over
 
03:33:49.870 --> 03:33:49.880 align:start position:0%
9 % but once once the the authorities
 
03:33:51.349 --> 03:33:51.359 align:start position:0%
for the flexibility go away we're
 
03:33:53.550 --> 03:33:53.560 align:start position:0%
expecting that to drop by about
 
03:33:56.790 --> 03:33:56.800 align:start position:0%
20% um and that's where some of those
 
03:33:59.550 --> 03:33:59.560 align:start position:0%
calculations of fewer people renewing
 
03:33:59.560 --> 03:34:01.510 align:start position:0%
calculations of fewer people renewing
come

03:34:01.510 --> 03:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
come
 
03:34:09.110 --> 03:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
from um page uh 48 is um just a summary
 
03:34:11.389 --> 03:34:11.399 align:start position:0%
of the you know sometimes people talk
 
03:34:15.550 --> 03:34:15.560 align:start position:0%
about um which uh programs that you
 
03:34:17.710 --> 03:34:17.720 align:start position:0%
should should offer or not and we
 
03:34:20.070 --> 03:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
highlighted the mandatory services and
 
03:34:22.750 --> 03:34:22.760 align:start position:0%
the the yellow items on the bottom of
 
03:34:24.630 --> 03:34:24.640 align:start position:0%
that chart there were the ones that are
 
03:34:26.710 --> 03:34:26.720 align:start position:0%
considered under the ACA essential
 
03:34:29.870 --> 03:34:29.880 align:start position:0%
health benefits and and you know things
 
03:34:31.830 --> 03:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
that we have covered in the Medicaid
 
03:34:34.070 --> 03:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
Program is you know you wouldn't think I
 
03:34:35.750 --> 03:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
think today to not cover prescription
 
03:34:37.389 --> 03:34:37.399 align:start position:0%
drugs and for children not to give them
 
03:34:41.150 --> 03:34:41.160 align:start position:0%
eyeglasses and who need it and um you
 
03:34:45.070 --> 03:34:45.080 align:start position:0%
know even uh mental health is considered
 
03:34:48.710 --> 03:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
an optional service um but it I think
 
03:34:50.429 --> 03:34:50.439 align:start position:0%
just provided this because this
 
03:34:51.830 --> 03:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes comes up when people talk
 
03:34:56.110 --> 03:34:56.120 align:start position:0%
about Medicaid um then page 49 gives you
 
03:34:59.189 --> 03:34:59.199 align:start position:0%
some um comparisons of New Hampshire's
 
03:35:01.389 --> 03:35:01.399 align:start position:0%
eligibility um criteria versus the
 
03:35:04.030 --> 03:35:04.040 align:start position:0%
nation I think as we emphasized earlier
 
03:35:06.110 --> 03:35:06.120 align:start position:0%
that with respect to Children New
 
03:35:08.110 --> 03:35:08.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has you know the fifth highest
 
03:35:10.550 --> 03:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
eligibility in the country when it comes
 
03:35:16.030 --> 03:35:16.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:20.429 --> 03:35:20.439 align:start position:0%
on uh slide 50 is the the federal match
 
03:35:22.590 --> 03:35:22.600 align:start position:0%
which we we brought that slide up
 
03:35:26.389 --> 03:35:26.399 align:start position:0%
earlier um 51 is just an explanation of
 
03:35:28.630 --> 03:35:28.640 align:start position:0%
how Federal match
 
03:35:33.269 --> 03:35:33.279 align:start position:0%
Works um and page 52 is a just a table
 
03:35:35.110 --> 03:35:35.120 align:start position:0%
of the different match rates and on the
 
03:35:42.030 --> 03:35:42.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:45.349 --> 03:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
$1,000 53 is uh guess with time I'm
 
03:35:47.189 --> 03:35:47.199 align:start position:0%
going to just this is the community
 
03:35:49.670 --> 03:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
re-entry program it's the 1115 waiver
 
03:35:51.790 --> 03:35:51.800 align:start position:0%
program it sort of summarizes that and
 
03:35:54.070 --> 03:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
on the bottom it summarizes the youth
 
03:35:56.030 --> 03:35:56.040 align:start position:0%
re-entry program kind of the key
 
03:35:58.910 --> 03:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
features of those programs again I think
 
03:36:00.469 --> 03:36:00.479 align:start position:0%
if you're really interested in this it
 
03:36:02.910 --> 03:36:02.920 align:start position:0%
deserves you know much longer time than
 
03:36:04.309 --> 03:36:04.319 align:start position:0%
than that but it just gives you at least
 
03:36:06.550 --> 03:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
a basic on that and again what you're
 
03:36:08.309 --> 03:36:08.319 align:start position:0%
taking us through is the appendix so
 
03:36:10.349 --> 03:36:10.359 align:start position:0%
you've provided all this as supplemental
 
03:36:11.590 --> 03:36:11.600 align:start position:0%
to your
 
03:36:15.750 --> 03:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
presentation um and then on 54 and 5 uh
 
03:36:17.710 --> 03:36:17.720 align:start position:0%
4 is so some highlights of the
 
03:36:20.910 --> 03:36:20.920 align:start position:0%
reprocurement of what we did in 3.0 to
 
03:36:24.070 --> 03:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
make the program better um and then 55
 
03:36:26.110 --> 03:36:26.120 align:start position:0%
gets into the things I talked about
 
03:36:28.830 --> 03:36:28.840 align:start position:0%
earlier on medication the two major
 
03:36:31.389 --> 03:36:31.399 align:start position:0%
initiatives there in terms of within the
 
03:36:32.950 --> 03:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
the more recent
 
03:36:32.960 --> 03:36:35.510 align:start position:0%
the more recent
procurement

03:36:35.510 --> 03:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
procurement
 
03:36:35.520 --> 03:36:37.670 align:start position:0%
procurement
um

03:36:37.670 --> 03:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:41.950 --> 03:36:41.960 align:start position:0%
56 um shows the distribution of the
 
03:36:44.510 --> 03:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
capitation rate where the money is spent
 
03:36:46.550 --> 03:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
you'll notice in the the sort of the
 
03:36:49.469 --> 03:36:49.479 align:start position:0%
lighter brown area that um the outside
 
03:36:52.670 --> 03:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
says 25.2% the inside says 31% the
 
03:36:55.030 --> 03:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
difference is the 31% is just of the
 
03:36:57.510 --> 03:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
medical spend not the administration or
 
03:37:00.389 --> 03:37:00.399 align:start position:0%
or profit component or the premium tax
 
03:37:02.630 --> 03:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
um when you look at the medical spend
 
03:37:08.150 --> 03:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
it's 31% of that um 50 page 57 are
 
03:37:11.870 --> 03:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
Trends on utilization um in both the the
 
03:37:13.550 --> 03:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
granted Advantage program and standard
 
03:37:15.070 --> 03:37:15.080 align:start position:0%
program that we've been following over
 
03:37:17.110 --> 03:37:17.120 align:start position:0%
time their utilization rates per
 
03:37:19.910 --> 03:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
thousand um I know that was an interest
 
03:37:22.110 --> 03:37:22.120 align:start position:0%
of at least one member of the committee
 
03:37:24.790 --> 03:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
to have some insights into that we can
 
03:37:26.510 --> 03:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
provide more but this is sort of a high
 
03:37:29.269 --> 03:37:29.279 align:start position:0%
level you know look that we do follow it
 
03:37:31.870 --> 03:37:31.880 align:start position:0%
and are some links to take you to
 
03:37:34.229 --> 03:37:34.239 align:start position:0%
different um places to look at more
 
03:37:41.790 --> 03:37:41.800 align:start position:0%
detail detail um on page uh 68 is
 
03:37:45.870 --> 03:37:45.880 align:start position:0%
um um the uh
 
03:37:47.750 --> 03:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
you know New Hampshire um this is
 
03:37:50.189 --> 03:37:50.199 align:start position:0%
something CMS tracks in terms of the
 
03:37:51.630 --> 03:37:51.640 align:start position:0%
number of measures that New Hampshire
 
03:37:53.630 --> 03:37:53.640 align:start position:0%
participates in we're one of the higher
 
03:37:57.910 --> 03:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
ones um and then on page uh
 
03:38:00.870 --> 03:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
69 is a summary of the the federal
 
03:38:04.469 --> 03:38:04.479 align:start position:0%
scorecard of of where we're not doing as
 
03:38:06.750 --> 03:38:06.760 align:start position:0%
well as we'd like to that we actually
 
03:38:08.309 --> 03:38:08.319 align:start position:0%
have metrics that we're already working
 
03:38:10.710 --> 03:38:10.720 align:start position:0%
on to get better in and then of the
 
03:38:12.429 --> 03:38:12.439 align:start position:0%
areas we're doing excellently we have
 
03:38:14.070 --> 03:38:14.080 align:start position:0%
nine out of 10 we have metrics that
 
03:38:16.950 --> 03:38:16.960 align:start position:0%
we're tracking we could do a lot more on
 
03:38:19.349 --> 03:38:19.359 align:start position:0%
quality if you're interested in that
 
03:38:21.790 --> 03:38:21.800 align:start position:0%
almost made
 
03:38:25.389 --> 03:38:25.399 align:start position:0%
4:30 okay thank you very much I see that
 
03:38:27.790 --> 03:38:27.800 align:start position:0%
in your formal presentation with the
 
03:38:27.800 --> 03:38:28.950 align:start position:0%
in your formal presentation with the
appendix

03:38:28.950 --> 03:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
appendix
 
03:38:31.870 --> 03:38:31.880 align:start position:0%
included so at this point I'll ask for
 
03:38:34.830 --> 03:38:34.840 align:start position:0%
any wrapup questions related to your
 
03:38:37.990 --> 03:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
presentation I would like to also see if
 
03:38:40.710 --> 03:38:40.720 align:start position:0%
anyone has any further remarks on this
 
03:38:43.389 --> 03:38:43.399 align:start position:0%
document of five that was passed out
 
03:38:46.469 --> 03:38:46.479 align:start position:0%
earlier and on the website
 
03:38:50.110 --> 03:38:50.120 align:start position:0%
any comments on preliminary House Bill
 
03:38:53.389 --> 03:38:53.399 align:start position:0%
two and then anybody from the public if
 
03:38:55.110 --> 03:38:55.120 align:start position:0%
they would like to comment so let's
 
03:38:57.469 --> 03:38:57.479 align:start position:0%
start with any wrapup questions to the
 
03:38:59.349 --> 03:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
overall presentation at this point
 
03:39:01.389 --> 03:39:01.399 align:start position:0%
representative Daniels for a question
 
03:39:03.429 --> 03:39:03.439 align:start position:0%
thank you on the
 
03:39:07.750 --> 03:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
255 uh% threshold yes uh who sets that
 
03:39:10.910 --> 03:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
and how long has it been in place so the
 
03:39:15.189 --> 03:39:15.199 align:start position:0%
255 is the national median um that's out
 
03:39:17.229 --> 03:39:17.239 align:start position:0%
there in terms of if you look at all
 
03:39:19.710 --> 03:39:19.720 align:start position:0%
states where they set their FPL federal
 
03:39:21.550 --> 03:39:21.560 align:start position:0%
poverty limit we're at
 
03:39:24.269 --> 03:39:24.279 align:start position:0%
323 you know there's some states below
 
03:39:26.750 --> 03:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
255 that's just the national median so
 
03:39:29.429 --> 03:39:29.439 align:start position:0%
we thought that in terms of a picking a
 
03:39:31.870 --> 03:39:31.880 align:start position:0%
point of which to start a premium you
 
03:39:34.910 --> 03:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
know it's higher than it was we work to
 
03:39:38.670 --> 03:39:38.680 align:start position:0%
cut it we work to cut it down that's it
 
03:39:39.870 --> 03:39:39.880 align:start position:0%
I think we all believe that's the
 
03:39:42.590 --> 03:39:42.600 align:start position:0%
condensed version be true the fivepoint
 
03:39:45.389 --> 03:39:45.399 align:start position:0%
document any further thoughts comments
 
03:39:47.630 --> 03:39:47.640 align:start position:0%
questions related to anybody around this
 
03:39:51.269 --> 03:39:51.279 align:start position:0%
table representative tarki thank you
 
03:39:53.830 --> 03:39:53.840 align:start position:0%
this has been CH full and I feel like
 
03:39:57.150 --> 03:39:57.160 align:start position:0%
we're just scratching the surface um you
 
03:40:01.510 --> 03:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
alluded to this but I see a lot of um
 
03:40:04.150 --> 03:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
Representatives out there who they
 
03:40:06.750 --> 03:40:06.760 align:start position:0%
represent providers and I think we
 
03:40:10.110 --> 03:40:10.120 align:start position:0%
haven't even touched the conversation on
 
03:40:12.309 --> 03:40:12.319 align:start position:0%
what this is actually going to mean for
 
03:40:16.189 --> 03:40:16.199 align:start position:0%
providers our hospitals um substance use
 
03:40:19.670 --> 03:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
disorder uh treatment um and how this is
 
03:40:22.630 --> 03:40:22.640 align:start position:0%
really going to affect patients in the
 
03:40:25.630 --> 03:40:25.640 align:start position:0%
exam room and in the doctor's office so
 
03:40:28.030 --> 03:40:28.040 align:start position:0%
at 20 minutes of 5 I'm a little
 
03:40:29.389 --> 03:40:29.399 align:start position:0%
concerned by just saying does anyone
 
03:40:31.429 --> 03:40:31.439 align:start position:0%
have a comment and I'm wondering if we
 
03:40:33.990 --> 03:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
would be able to schedule a time to
 
03:40:35.790 --> 03:40:35.800 align:start position:0%
actually give some dedicated
 
03:40:38.790 --> 03:40:38.800 align:start position:0%
conversation to the
 
03:40:41.510 --> 03:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
providers let me consult with the
 
03:40:43.710 --> 03:40:43.720 align:start position:0%
division chair but I'm sure that can be
 
03:40:46.870 --> 03:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
arranged thank you
 
03:40:46.880 --> 03:40:48.150 align:start position:0%
arranged thank you
representative

03:40:48.150 --> 03:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:40:51.070 --> 03:40:51.080 align:start position:0%
Stringham I know there there's some
 
03:40:53.269 --> 03:40:53.279 align:start position:0%
areas in there that I've inquired about
 
03:40:56.070 --> 03:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
but uh in particular I'm I'm concerned
 
03:40:59.030 --> 03:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
whether there's any areas uh in uh in
 
03:41:00.990 --> 03:41:01.000 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rates where we're
 
03:41:07.189 --> 03:41:07.199 align:start position:0%
seeing um uh access issues uh uh and and
 
03:41:09.269 --> 03:41:09.279 align:start position:0%
might be appropriate for targeted rate
 
03:41:12.309 --> 03:41:12.319 align:start position:0%
increases my understanding is there's no
 
03:41:15.750 --> 03:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
change in rates um uh built in
 
03:41:18.950 --> 03:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh to this budget despite uh you know 3
 
03:41:21.950 --> 03:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
to 4% inflation rates over uh each of
 
03:41:23.710 --> 03:41:23.720 align:start position:0%
the last two years so if you want to
 
03:41:25.710 --> 03:41:25.720 align:start position:0%
comment on that I'd appreciate
 
03:41:29.229 --> 03:41:29.239 align:start position:0%
it it's it's correct that this budget
 
03:41:32.550 --> 03:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
does not have rate increases in Medicaid
 
03:41:35.870 --> 03:41:35.880 align:start position:0%
rate Medicaid budget um this portion of
 
03:41:37.670 --> 03:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid budget I'm not sure what
 
03:41:39.469 --> 03:41:39.479 align:start position:0%
the other divisions if they have
 
03:41:41.630 --> 03:41:41.640 align:start position:0%
anything um
 
03:41:46.910 --> 03:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
um but um the uh Senate bill um I think
 
03:41:47.910 --> 03:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
it was
 
03:41:52.950 --> 03:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
243 had um I think $20 million per year
 
03:41:55.830 --> 03:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
but I think that was um the action at
 
03:41:59.189 --> 03:41:59.199 align:start position:0%
the end of last week that they cut that
 
03:42:03.469 --> 03:42:03.479 align:start position:0%
down um um so I think that that that's
 
03:42:05.830 --> 03:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
the only Bill then there's there may be
 
03:42:07.510 --> 03:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
some other bills out there that I'm not
 
03:42:11.269 --> 03:42:11.279 align:start position:0%
aware of that that are separate from hb1
 
03:42:14.269 --> 03:42:14.279 align:start position:0%
if you will um that have rates it's I
 
03:42:15.670 --> 03:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
mean I think the
 
03:42:19.429 --> 03:42:19.439 align:start position:0%
the targets um didn't allow for that um
 
03:42:21.269 --> 03:42:21.279 align:start position:0%
can you comment at all the on the
 
03:42:26.710 --> 03:42:26.720 align:start position:0%
maternity Services uh and and how how um
 
03:42:29.630 --> 03:42:29.640 align:start position:0%
uh that provider network has responded
 
03:42:31.389 --> 03:42:31.399 align:start position:0%
to the rate increases from the last few
 
03:42:34.790 --> 03:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
years well um in terms of as you know
 
03:42:40.710 --> 03:42:40.720 align:start position:0%
for hospitals um we provided a a 24%
 
03:42:43.389 --> 03:42:43.399 align:start position:0%
increase for the larger hospitals and a
 
03:42:47.950 --> 03:42:47.960 align:start position:0%
34% increase for the delivery of babies
 
03:42:49.630 --> 03:42:49.640 align:start position:0%
we um
 
03:42:53.229 --> 03:42:53.239 align:start position:0%
hb2 had um the increases the across the
 
03:42:55.149 --> 03:42:55.159 align:start position:0%
board increases that were given to
 
03:42:57.510 --> 03:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
providers for the providers and then for
 
03:43:00.269 --> 03:43:00.279 align:start position:0%
the birthing centers there were um there
 
03:43:03.590 --> 03:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
were two there was before HB uh 2 there
 
03:43:06.030 --> 03:43:06.040 align:start position:0%
was an increase and there was another
 
03:43:08.750 --> 03:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
increase a part of hb2 in 2023 there's
 
03:43:10.990 --> 03:43:11.000 align:start position:0%
also in that bill I was referencing um
 
03:43:12.189 --> 03:43:12.199 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
03:43:15.110 --> 03:43:15.120 align:start position:0%
$30,000 study as to what can be done
 
03:43:17.830 --> 03:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
more to support birthing centers um and
 
03:43:20.710 --> 03:43:20.720 align:start position:0%
that Senate bill that I was referring
 
03:43:25.229 --> 03:43:25.239 align:start position:0%
to so so are they prosperous and and
 
03:43:27.670 --> 03:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
thriving or are they uh flailing and
 
03:43:32.389 --> 03:43:32.399 align:start position:0%
failing so I think one of the um I to be
 
03:43:34.830 --> 03:43:34.840 align:start position:0%
frank I don't know directly but one of
 
03:43:36.830 --> 03:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
the major issues I do know that was
 
03:43:38.950 --> 03:43:38.960 align:start position:0%
driving them to ask for higher rates was
 
03:43:41.229 --> 03:43:41.239 align:start position:0%
the malpractice insurance Market had
 
03:43:44.670 --> 03:43:44.680 align:start position:0%
sort of seized for them um and part of
 
03:43:50.790 --> 03:43:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:53.710 --> 03:43:53.720 align:start position:0%
address okay anything further the
 
03:43:55.550 --> 03:43:55.560 align:start position:0%
document of
 
03:44:01.510 --> 03:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
five okay the preliminary House Bill two
 
03:44:04.710 --> 03:44:04.720 align:start position:0%
I call it preliminary because as we know
 
03:44:08.269 --> 03:44:08.279 align:start position:0%
as was raised earlier there's nothing in
 
03:44:12.030 --> 03:44:12.040 align:start position:0%
there any comment remark or question
 
03:44:12.040 --> 03:44:13.550 align:start position:0%
there any comment remark or question
about

03:44:13.550 --> 03:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:44:16.990 --> 03:44:17.000 align:start position:0%
anything in there now
 
03:44:19.349 --> 03:44:19.359 align:start position:0%
okay at this point I want to open it up
 
03:44:22.950 --> 03:44:22.960 align:start position:0%
to anyone in the audience who would like
 
03:44:25.189 --> 03:44:25.199 align:start position:0%

03:44:38.560 --> 03:44:42.469 align:start position:0%
 
audience

03:44:42.469 --> 03:44:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:45.550 --> 03:44:45.560 align:start position:0%
okay all right if you could just make
 
03:44:47.950 --> 03:44:47.960 align:start position:0%

is very clear and who you represent sure
 
03:44:53.510 --> 03:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
I'll be very very quick too my name is

advocacy and new Futures I really just
 
03:44:59.670 --> 03:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
want to underscore the comments made
 
03:45:01.710 --> 03:45:01.720 align:start position:0%
earlier that if we just could have more
 
03:45:04.950 --> 03:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
information with a a crosswalk and maybe
 
03:45:07.710 --> 03:45:07.720 align:start position:0%
another point in time that people can
 
03:45:10.510 --> 03:45:10.520 align:start position:0%
providers and those who may be impacted
 
03:45:13.030 --> 03:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
by these changes could um bring that
 
03:45:15.030 --> 03:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
information forward that'd be great
 
03:45:16.670 --> 03:45:16.680 align:start position:0%
because this is all new information and
 
03:45:19.189 --> 03:45:19.199 align:start position:0%
it's 4:30 and 4:45 and we're all very
 
03:45:21.309 --> 03:45:21.319 align:start position:0%
tired but I do want to thank the the
 
03:45:23.189 --> 03:45:23.199 align:start position:0%
committee and the department for the
 
03:45:25.030 --> 03:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
presentation thank you very much for
 
03:45:28.790 --> 03:45:28.800 align:start position:0%

is very clear good afternoon Don mckenny
 
03:45:38.630 --> 03:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Legal Assistant I agree
 
03:45:41.229 --> 03:45:41.239 align:start position:0%
with what was just said about a public
 
03:45:43.750 --> 03:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity for comment one specific
 
03:45:45.750 --> 03:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
suggestion and I apologize if I missed
 
03:45:47.590 --> 03:45:47.600 align:start position:0%
this already because I was in and out a
 
03:45:50.429 --> 03:45:50.439 align:start position:0%
lot trying to go cover a couple things
 
03:45:53.070 --> 03:45:53.080 align:start position:0%
um but I was hoping to get more
 
03:45:55.269 --> 03:45:55.279 align:start position:0%
information about the cost to implement
 
03:45:56.670 --> 03:45:56.680 align:start position:0%
some of the changes that are being
 
03:45:58.710 --> 03:45:58.720 align:start position:0%
suggested in terms of particularly
 
03:46:02.550 --> 03:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
premiums and co-pays um I didn't hear
 
03:46:05.550 --> 03:46:05.560 align:start position:0%
those implementation costs I I saw on
 
03:46:08.790 --> 03:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
page um 39 about the implementation cost
 
03:46:10.990 --> 03:46:11.000 align:start position:0%
for the work requirements for example I
 
03:46:12.389 --> 03:46:12.399 align:start position:0%
would think that there would be similar
 
03:46:14.710 --> 03:46:14.720 align:start position:0%
costs for those other changes as well
 
03:46:16.149 --> 03:46:16.159 align:start position:0%
and and I just didn't hear that so I
 
03:46:18.950 --> 03:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to note that for maybe if thank
 
03:46:21.349 --> 03:46:21.359 align:start position:0%
you you're referring to uh page 39 of
 
03:46:24.030 --> 03:46:24.040 align:start position:0%
the presentation today right okay that
 
03:46:26.830 --> 03:46:26.840 align:start position:0%
that specifically outlines the cost to
 
03:46:28.670 --> 03:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
for work requirements but I didn't see
 
03:46:30.550 --> 03:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
something similar around premiums and
 
03:46:32.710 --> 03:46:32.720 align:start position:0%
co-pays those have got to be
 
03:46:36.189 --> 03:46:36.199 align:start position:0%
significantly expensive to implement
 
03:46:38.750 --> 03:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
administratively and um just think that
 
03:46:41.510 --> 03:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
that should be factored into the based
 
03:46:43.110 --> 03:46:43.120 align:start position:0%
on the proposals that the working
 
03:46:44.910 --> 03:46:44.920 align:start position:0%
document that was circulated and posted
 
03:46:47.070 --> 03:46:47.080 align:start position:0%
online today very good thank you okay
 
03:46:49.870 --> 03:46:49.880 align:start position:0%

03:46:58.510 --> 03:46:58.520 align:start position:0%
