00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:28.910 align:start position:0%

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 align:start position:0%

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:28.830 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 align:start position:0%

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 align:start position:0%
I wonder if I could ask um just to make
 
00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 align:start position:0%
I think I know the answer to this but
 
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 align:start position:0%
other than the issue of the um the uh
 
00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 align:start position:0%
exemption for the part-time uh
 
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 align:start position:0%
um uh assistant director of SEC Safety
 
00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
and Security for the judicial branch my
 
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 align:start position:0%
understanding is that there's no changes
 
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 align:start position:0%
on any of the other things that the the
 
00:03:29.429 --> 00:03:29.439 align:start position:0%
house and Senator are can are fine on
 
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 align:start position:0%
all the other all the other Provisions
 
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 align:start position:0%
is that we're fine with the bill as we
 
00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
no no no I I understand I understand
 
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 align:start position:0%
we're good I think you all have the
 
00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
issues over there so what can we do to
 
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
help you right the issue is with regard
 
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 align:start position:0%
to the assistant uh director of Safety
 
00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 align:start position:0%
and Security for the judicial branch um
 
00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 align:start position:0%
and I I wonder before we get to the
 
00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 align:start position:0%
discussion if if I could just ask Mr uh
 
00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 align:start position:0%
Carin if he could just just give us a
 
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
brief overview of how the retirement
 
00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 align:start position:0%
system works with regard to the judicial
 
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
branch and I I had a couple of questions
 
00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
based on our our caucus discussion and I
 
00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 align:start position:0%
guess the first one is is the judicial
 
00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
branch oh yeah could you come to the mic
 
00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.479 align:start position:0%
sorry is is the judicial branch
 
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
participation in the retirement system
 
00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
for non-judge employees is that
 
00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
something that is is created by Statute
 
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 align:start position:0%
or was that something that's just or
 
00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 align:start position:0%
sort of historically existed it I as a
 
00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
as a branch of of government it's it's
 
00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 align:start position:0%
um it was it's they've always been
 
00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 align:start position:0%
included as far as my knowledge they
 
00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:44.479 align:start position:0%
weren't added later you know the
 
00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
non-judge uh courts judicial branch
 
00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 align:start position:0%
employees okay but I mean my question do
 
00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 align:start position:0%
you know is there a statute that
 
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 align:start position:0%
actually says that or is that just you
 
00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
know that's just sort of historical
 
00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
that's the way it always
 
00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
was I I would have to look in the Statue
 
00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 align:start position:0%
I believe that you know that they would
 
00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 align:start position:0%
fall under the state employee umbrella
 
00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:09.759 align:start position:0%
you know which state employee uh you
 
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
know is mandatory membership for
 
00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 align:start position:0%
full-time permanent position so I I
 
00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 align:start position:0%
don't think it was you know it's a
 
00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:16.759 align:start position:0%
different branch of government but nhrs
 
00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
is also even though we're not an
 
00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 align:start position:0%
executive branch agency we we fall under
 
00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:20.919 align:start position:0%
that state
 
00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
employee uh you know
 
00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 align:start position:0%
eligibility oh for enrollment okay all
 
00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
right um
 
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:32.440 align:start position:0%
and the other question I have and I'm
 
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 align:start position:0%
not I'm not sure M Carlin if you would
 
00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 align:start position:0%
be the person that would be would be
 
00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
able to answer this better or perhaps
 
00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
someone from the judicial branch would
 
00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
be able as I understand it um per DM
 
00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 align:start position:0%
court security officers
 
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
are exempt
 
00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 align:start position:0%
from uh for lack of a better term the
 
00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 align:start position:0%
provision that prohibits double dipping
 
00:05:59.309 --> 00:05:59.319 align:start position:0%
so that in other words a retired a
 
00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:01.600 align:start position:0%
police police officer could retire
 
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
collect the group two pension benefits
 
00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:07.880 align:start position:0%
and then become a pum court security
 
00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 align:start position:0%
officer is that yeah PDM court security
 
00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:13.720 align:start position:0%
officer and PDM BFF as well I'm not I'm
 
00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120 align:start position:0%
not sure what the distinction is in in
 
00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:18.280 align:start position:0%
in the judicial realm for those those
 
00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:20.440 align:start position:0%
position titles but either of those
 
00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
positions that that is correct those
 
00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:26.120 align:start position:0%
those two exceptions perm uh court
 
00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
security officers and BFFs um were um
 
00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:32.199 align:start position:0%
added when when the working after
 
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
retirement statutes were put in into
 
00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
Statute in 2011 in House Bill 2 um prior
 
00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
to that we referred to our
 
00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:41.199 align:start position:0%
administrative rule for the definition
 
00:06:43.309 --> 00:06:43.319 align:start position:0%
of full-time and anything less than that
 
00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:45.039 align:start position:0%
was part-time and there were no
 
00:06:46.749 --> 00:06:46.759 align:start position:0%
Provisions or limits on that as long as
 
00:06:48.589 --> 00:06:48.599 align:start position:0%
it wasn't a full-time permanent position
 
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
so when hp2 put the first statutory
 
00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
definition of part-time and what was
 
00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
allowed in the statute those positions
 
00:06:59.189 --> 00:06:59.199 align:start position:0%
were carved out I think it was during a
 
00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:02.440 align:start position:0%
committee of conference um on on that uh
 
00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
those aspects of the bill okay and and
 
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
so am I understanding correctly is if
 
00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.710 align:start position:0%
so am I understanding correctly is if
someone

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:09.720 align:start position:0%
someone
 
00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:16.360 align:start position:0%
is a um a perdm security security
 
00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:17.720 align:start position:0%
officer or
 
00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:21.280 align:start position:0%
bayth are are those persons allowed to
 
00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:24.080 align:start position:0%
work the equivalent of
 
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
full-time yes uh provided that they're
 
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
they're not doing it every week you know
 
00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:31.800 align:start position:0%
once once you know there's you know
 
00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
there's there is a a smell test if
 
00:07:34.869 --> 00:07:34.879 align:start position:0%
you're regularly scheduled to work
 
00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
full-time hours regardless of what
 
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
whether it's called PDM or not we would
 
00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
probably look at that and say that's a
 
00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:43.400 align:start position:0%
full-time job um you know but if it's
 
00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:45.560 align:start position:0%
truly Prem even if it's a couple or
 
00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
month of full weeks in a row but it's
 
00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:49.960 align:start position:0%
not a permanent position regularly
 
00:07:52.309 --> 00:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
scheduled to work that many hours they
 
00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:53.800 align:start position:0%
they're they're exempt from the hourly
 
00:07:56.869 --> 00:07:56.879 align:start position:0%
limits okay then I have just one other
 
00:07:58.510 --> 00:07:58.520 align:start position:0%
question and I throw it open to anybody
 
00:07:59.550 --> 00:07:59.560 align:start position:0%
anyone else who may have question
 
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
questions is um my understanding is that
 
00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:08.440 align:start position:0%
the the legislative branch has
 
00:08:12.309 --> 00:08:12.319 align:start position:0%
essentially Exempted um itself from
 
00:08:15.149 --> 00:08:15.159 align:start position:0%
having uh employees have to
 
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
participate full-time I I have to
 
00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:20.360 align:start position:0%
participate in the retirement system my
 
00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.830 align:start position:0%
participate in the retirement system my
question

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:25.800 align:start position:0%
is my understanding is and I'm asking
 
00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:27.400 align:start position:0%
really to know if this is correct is
 
00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
that the overwhelming majority of
 
00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.870 align:start position:0%
that the overwhelming majority of
legislative

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:31.880 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
employees do participate in the
 
00:08:35.469 --> 00:08:35.479 align:start position:0%
retirement system that and there was
 
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
with the ex as I understand it with the
 
00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:40.360 align:start position:0%
exception of a few people who might be
 
00:08:43.469 --> 00:08:43.479 align:start position:0%
characterized as really having sort of
 
00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:45.800 align:start position:0%
political positions that they're going
 
00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:48.040 align:start position:0%
to be there only as long as whoever
 
00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
their elected official boss is there
 
00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:52.360 align:start position:0%
those people might not participate might
 
00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
choose not to participate but most
 
00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
almost everybody else does is is that
 
00:08:57.949 --> 00:08:57.959 align:start position:0%
your understanding that that's my
 
00:08:59.509 --> 00:08:59.519 align:start position:0%
understanding I don't I don't have
 
00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
specific data to back that up but just
 
00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
anecdotally over the last 15 years you
 
00:09:05.829 --> 00:09:05.839 align:start position:0%
know the the career employees you know
 
00:09:08.829 --> 00:09:08.839 align:start position:0%
LBA legislative Services folks tend tend
 
00:09:11.389 --> 00:09:11.399 align:start position:0%
to be in the system you know um and it's
 
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:13.000 align:start position:0%
it's more you know governor's office
 
00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:15.320 align:start position:0%
policy positions in the majority offices
 
00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:17.320 align:start position:0%
in the House and Senate those folks who
 
00:09:19.949 --> 00:09:19.959 align:start position:0%
may not see the position as something
 
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
they're ever going to vest in so they
 
00:09:24.069 --> 00:09:24.079 align:start position:0%
choose not to to to join when they get
 
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
get appointed or hired to those jobs
 
00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:29.160 align:start position:0%
okay all right I I don't have any other
 
00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:31.000 align:start position:0%
question question anybody else have
 
00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr car I just want to
 
00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
clarify you mentioned up until now we've
 
00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:40.360 align:start position:0%
just been talking about judicial and um
 
00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:43.000 align:start position:0%
uh and legislative but you did include
 
00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:45.480 align:start position:0%
uh the governor's office employees is
 
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
that correct yeah yeah that yes that
 
00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
yeah that that that's also we we've
 
00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
interpreted that as is you know an
 
00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
executive branch office it's not a state
 
00:09:57.269 --> 00:09:57.279 align:start position:0%
agency per se so we we've allowed that
 
00:09:59.829 --> 00:09:59.839 align:start position:0%
optional membership uh for folks serving
 
00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:01.720 align:start position:0%
in the governor's office as well and
 
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
what about the Secretary of State um I
 
00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:08.720 align:start position:0%
think they that would fall under
 
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
optional membership as well um so I I'm
 
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
sure there's some some folks who are
 
00:10:15.069 --> 00:10:15.079 align:start position:0%
retired over there who um are working
 
00:10:16.509 --> 00:10:16.519 align:start position:0%
there and collecting a benefit because
 
00:10:18.269 --> 00:10:18.279 align:start position:0%
they chose not to join in HRS when they
 
00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:20.920 align:start position:0%
were appointed to those
 
00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:23.560 align:start position:0%
positions thank you so you know I'm
 
00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:25.880 align:start position:0%
sorry can I any other questions can I
 
00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:27.880 align:start position:0%
just ask one other question so in my
 
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
understanding from what you've just said
 
00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.509 align:start position:0%
understanding from what you've just said
is

00:10:31.509 --> 00:10:31.519 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:10:34.389 --> 00:10:34.399 align:start position:0%
that the bottom line so to speak is that
 
00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:36.160 align:start position:0%
the legislative
 
00:10:38.949 --> 00:10:38.959 align:start position:0%
branch has a
 
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
few people um who are who are not
 
00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:46.200 align:start position:0%
elected officials but you know provide
 
00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:48.920 align:start position:0%
services to elected officials who are
 
00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:52.720 align:start position:0%
able to double dip yeah the governor's
 
00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:54.920 align:start position:0%
office the executive branch at sort of
 
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
the height of the executive branch can
 
00:10:59.629 --> 00:10:59.639 align:start position:0%
do the same thing
 
00:11:02.269 --> 00:11:02.279 align:start position:0%
but the judicial branch as things now
 
00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:05.160 align:start position:0%
stand is the only branch that doesn't
 
00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:07.240 align:start position:0%
have the ability to do
 
00:11:09.829 --> 00:11:09.839 align:start position:0%
that the answer is yes but I I I'd like
 
00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:11.240 align:start position:0%
to condition that if I may
 
00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:13.240 align:start position:0%
representative Smith's question raised
 
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:16.240 align:start position:0%
another point it's not just whether a
 
00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
specific position is um not all
 
00:11:21.389 --> 00:11:21.399 align:start position:0%
positions may be optional like your
 
00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
example of the secretary of state that
 
00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
would fall under the official appointed
 
00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:27.279 align:start position:0%
for a fixed
 
00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
term uh position so like if you know
 
00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:33.880 align:start position:0%
anybody who was at a senior enough uh
 
00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:35.720 align:start position:0%
you know position or the position was
 
00:11:37.949 --> 00:11:37.959 align:start position:0%
defined as a fix term appointment that's
 
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
where the optional comes in as well as
 
00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:41.320 align:start position:0%
you know Rank and fr you know General
 
00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
Court employee so in in context of this
 
00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:47.240 align:start position:0%
assistant um director position that the
 
00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
bill um that's issue in this bill that
 
00:11:52.069 --> 00:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
the director position is not a fixed
 
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:53.720 align:start position:0%
term appointment so it would
 
00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
be POS potentially hard to make the the
 
00:11:58.750 --> 00:11:58.760 align:start position:0%
assistant a fix term appointment if the
 
00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:00.760 align:start position:0%
if they're B isn't but you know that
 
00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:02.440 align:start position:0%
that fixed term appointment piece is
 
00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:05.000 align:start position:0%
also allows optional membership you know
 
00:12:06.629 --> 00:12:06.639 align:start position:0%
under the
 
00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:10.040 align:start position:0%
law sorry in in my mind the phrase
 
00:12:12.389 --> 00:12:12.399 align:start position:0%
double dipping is a
 
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
pejorative um and for those of us who
 
00:12:18.069 --> 00:12:18.079 align:start position:0%
were continue over a long period of time
 
00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:20.360 align:start position:0%
to be concerned about the financial
 
00:12:22.829 --> 00:12:22.839 align:start position:0%
stability of the retirement system
 
00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
double dipping is definitely a
 
00:12:28.629 --> 00:12:28.639 align:start position:0%
pejorative but double dipping does not
 
00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:31.240 align:start position:0%
apply does it to all the positions we've
 
00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
talked about except those people who are
 
00:12:38.629 --> 00:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
uh from from the police or or fire yeah
 
00:12:45.629 --> 00:12:45.639 align:start position:0%
it's a term we don't tend to use at the
 
00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:48.440 align:start position:0%
retirement system you know you know in
 
00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
general because there are different
 
00:12:52.949 --> 00:12:52.959 align:start position:0%
opinions on what's defined as double
 
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
dipping you know some people would look
 
00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
and say anybody who's collecting a
 
00:12:58.790 --> 00:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
pension shouldn't be working for state
 
00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:00.920 align:start position:0%
government in or a governmental entity
 
00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and that's one position
 
00:13:05.069 --> 00:13:05.079 align:start position:0%
other people look at and say well these
 
00:13:06.509 --> 00:13:06.519 align:start position:0%
are positions you're allowed to under
 
00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
the law so you're not you you're not
 
00:13:10.189 --> 00:13:10.199 align:start position:0%
you're not doing anything wrong this
 
00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
you're you're entitled to do that so
 
00:13:14.509 --> 00:13:14.519 align:start position:0%
that you know that that to to your point
 
00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
yeah that's you know that's there's a
 
00:13:18.389 --> 00:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
definition definitional issue I think
 
00:13:20.509 --> 00:13:20.519 align:start position:0%
with some folks on what agreeing what it
 
00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
is Senator Carson thank you Mr chair
 
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
um what what this bill is is asking us
 
00:13:33.269 --> 00:13:33.279 align:start position:0%
to do is not atypical we get and I've
 
00:13:36.189 --> 00:13:36.199 align:start position:0%
worked with Mr car for a number of years
 
00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
um we do get these requests usually it
 
00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:41.560 align:start position:0%
revolves around security because it is
 
00:13:43.949 --> 00:13:43.959 align:start position:0%
difficult to get trained individuals to
 
00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
do this kind of work so everything is
 
00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
done on a Case by casee basis where a
 
00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation is filed it goes
 
00:13:53.829 --> 00:13:53.839 align:start position:0%
through the legislative process and we
 
00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
make the decision whether or not to
 
00:13:59.110 --> 00:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
exempt them and that includes um
 
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
individuals that might be um uh
 
00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
nominated and uh confirmed as uh a
 
00:14:08.829 --> 00:14:08.839 align:start position:0%
commissioner usually I think the last
 
00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:12.720 align:start position:0%
one was uh Mr Plumber who was retired
 
00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:14.920 align:start position:0%
and what he was asked to come back and
 
00:14:17.949 --> 00:14:17.959 align:start position:0%
be the director of Homeland Security and
 
00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
so we had to uh go through the
 
00:14:22.749 --> 00:14:22.759 align:start position:0%
legislative process for an exemption so
 
00:14:25.189 --> 00:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
what's happening in this bill is not
 
00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
atypical um this was a request of the
 
00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
court and and this is what um this is
 
00:14:33.829 --> 00:14:33.839 align:start position:0%
what they need so it's up to us to
 
00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
decide whether or not we want to give
 
00:14:37.949 --> 00:14:37.959 align:start position:0%
the exemption but I want to make the
 
00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
point that these kind of asks are not
 
00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
atypical um we do get them in Edna from
 
00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
time to time and they go through the
 
00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
legislative process and the legislature
 
00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:49.399 align:start position:0%
makes the decision whether or not to
 
00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:51.880 align:start position:0%
exempt and that's exactly what this bill
 
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
is trying to do representative goalie
 
00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
and then representative Smith thank you
 
00:14:59.150 --> 00:14:59.160 align:start position:0%
Mr chair Marty isn't the director of
 
00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security a group two position
 
00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:07.160 align:start position:0%
uh it it is yes yes it had been in group
 
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
one for a while and that was also a
 
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
change somewhere along the line so um
 
00:15:13.269 --> 00:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
you know Senator Carson's right there
 
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
there's been some some tweak with with
 
00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
that specific job but it is a full-time
 
00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:20.120 align:start position:0%
paying position into the is a fulltime
 
00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:21.720 align:start position:0%
unlike what this position it's a fixed
 
00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
term appointment so a future nominee
 
00:15:26.749 --> 00:15:26.759 align:start position:0%
could opt to not you know be in the
 
00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:28.160 align:start position:0%
system but it is a full-time permanent
 
00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:36.749 --> 00:15:36.759 align:start position:0%
and uh one of so you know can I just can
 
00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
I just make sure I just want to F can I
 
00:15:40.269 --> 00:15:40.279 align:start position:0%
just follow up for a minute so my
 
00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:44.440 align:start position:0%
understanding that the the although the
 
00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
current director of Homeland Security is
 
00:15:51.629 --> 00:15:51.639 align:start position:0%
is in group two am I understanding from
 
00:15:55.629 --> 00:15:55.639 align:start position:0%
what you just said that a a future
 
00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
person who might occupy this that
 
00:15:59.590 --> 00:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
position after the current occupant
 
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
leaves could elect could could be a
 
00:16:06.189 --> 00:16:06.199 align:start position:0%
retired police officer for example and
 
00:16:08.509 --> 00:16:08.519 align:start position:0%
elect not to participate in the
 
00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:11.480 align:start position:0%
retirement system yes because it's a fix
 
00:16:13.389 --> 00:16:13.399 align:start position:0%
term appointment you know you know that
 
00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
goes through the governor and Council so
 
00:16:16.509 --> 00:16:16.519 align:start position:0%
there there's a there's a you know fixed
 
00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:22.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:27.560 align:start position:0%
sorry is there any way and I understand
 
00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
probably not but that this position that
 
00:16:31.069 --> 00:16:31.079 align:start position:0%
they're looking
 
00:16:34.749 --> 00:16:34.759 align:start position:0%
for could be a group two position and
 
00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:36.360 align:start position:0%
just because of where they're located in
 
00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:37.829 align:start position:0%
just because of where they're located in
the

00:16:37.829 --> 00:16:37.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
courts um I think I think I think I
 
00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
think it's a part-time position intended
 
00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
to be so I mean it it would be kind of
 
00:16:48.069 --> 00:16:48.079 align:start position:0%
moot in that sense in terms of
 
00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
Eligibility if there were a full-time
 
00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
position you know there are definitions
 
00:16:53.749 --> 00:16:53.759 align:start position:0%
for a permanent police permanent fire
 
00:16:57.269 --> 00:16:57.279 align:start position:0%
and other um uh other definitions
 
00:16:59.069 --> 00:16:59.079 align:start position:0%
Correctional offic of certain probation
 
00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:01.160 align:start position:0%
officers things like that so
 
00:17:02.829 --> 00:17:02.839 align:start position:0%
definitionally you know certain
 
00:17:05.309 --> 00:17:05.319 align:start position:0%
positions have been added to group two
 
00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
uh sometimes I recall an instance where
 
00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:11.480 align:start position:0%
I think it was a forests and lands fire
 
00:17:13.189 --> 00:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
prevention Bureau or something where the
 
00:17:14.789 --> 00:17:14.799 align:start position:0%
the legislature added that you know if
 
00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
the person was if if someone was hired
 
00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:18.839 align:start position:0%
who was a group two employee they can
 
00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
stay in group two if they take that
 
00:17:22.429 --> 00:17:22.439 align:start position:0%
position so there's again it kind of
 
00:17:24.309 --> 00:17:24.319 align:start position:0%
gets back to Senator Senator Carson's
 
00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
points about that there have been sort
 
00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
of Creative Solutions to specific issues
 
00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
over the years some that have flown with
 
00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:34.120 align:start position:0%
both bodies and some that haven't so
 
00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
this can I yes of course so this
 
00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.230 align:start position:0%
this can I yes of course so this
position

00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:41.240 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:45.200 align:start position:0%
has if it be if it was a full-time
 
00:17:47.549 --> 00:17:47.559 align:start position:0%
position we could write into the statute
 
00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:50.280 align:start position:0%
a way of someone who is currently in
 
00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:53.720 align:start position:0%
group two working either as a state
 
00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:56.480 align:start position:0%
police or police officer
 
00:17:59.029 --> 00:17:59.039 align:start position:0%
somewhere to take this position as a
 
00:18:01.909 --> 00:18:01.919 align:start position:0%
group two position yeah and maintain the
 
00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
group two status yeah that could be done
 
00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
yes thank
 
00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:09.320 align:start position:0%
you represent Smith could I just ask a
 
00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
related question
 
00:18:19.789 --> 00:18:19.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
um it would also change Court
 
00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:27.080 align:start position:0%
bails that you know that we um a couple
 
00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
weeks ago we got a got a um a version of
 
00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
the amendment when it was going uh to to
 
00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:35.080 align:start position:0%
the Senate and looked at that and our
 
00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:38.240 align:start position:0%
legal folks um and I agree with them saw
 
00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
that comma placement you know in the
 
00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:43.400 align:start position:0%
break there as potentially turning all
 
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
Bays into they can work as many hours as
 
00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:47.640 align:start position:0%
they want regardless of retirement
 
00:18:52.029 --> 00:18:52.039 align:start position:0%
statute and our attorney uh apparently
 
00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:53.480 align:start position:0%
spoke to the attorney one of the
 
00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
attorneys at the judicial branch um that
 
00:18:58.110 --> 00:18:58.120 align:start position:0%
that was the request of the drafting
 
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
that was a that you know the the OS was
 
00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:04.200 align:start position:0%
pretty Wanted It That Way um what we
 
00:19:06.029 --> 00:19:06.039 align:start position:0%
would do with that and it's probably
 
00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:07.720 align:start position:0%
good that I'm you know saying this in a
 
00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:10.840 align:start position:0%
meeting uh you know our our legal staff
 
00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:14.240 align:start position:0%
has has told me that if if that we would
 
00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:16.280 align:start position:0%
prefer the and and then a comma for this
 
00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:18.280 align:start position:0%
one position but if it went through as
 
00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
as we would continue to interpret it the
 
00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:23.080 align:start position:0%
way it was um you know as as per DM
 
00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:25.880 align:start position:0%
court security and prum balas but
 
00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:29.640 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be more accurate um uh to
 
00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
use what I
 
00:19:34.669 --> 00:19:34.679 align:start position:0%
old-fashioned refer to as the Oxford
 
00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:38.840 align:start position:0%
comma and have the comma there to make
 
00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:44.360 align:start position:0%
clear what the intention is I we we and
 
00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:46.720 align:start position:0%
HRS would suggest that so would say
 
00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:49.480 align:start position:0%
perm Court bis and Security offices
 
00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:51.640 align:start position:0%
comma and the assistant director of and
 
00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:54.200 align:start position:0%
just keep keep that that thought you
 
00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
know to string together the perum with
 
00:19:59.230 --> 00:19:59.240 align:start position:0%
those two positions as it is now you
 
00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
know thank you very much and and I have
 
00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:06.200 align:start position:0%
just one other minor question um well no
 
00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:09.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:12.760 align:start position:0%
go I I'm thank you I'm looking at this
 
00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:16.559 align:start position:0%
and it says online 23 but accepting per
 
00:20:19.549 --> 00:20:19.559 align:start position:0%
DM court security officers comma crosses
 
00:20:22.669 --> 00:20:22.679 align:start position:0%
out and and then it says Port bayts
 
00:20:26.149 --> 00:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
comma and the assistant director so I
 
00:20:29.149 --> 00:20:29.159 align:start position:0%
think that that's correct you know what
 
00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
but you know no I think what I think
 
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
what what um he's saying is this if you
 
00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:37.480 align:start position:0%
if you leave the wording the way it is
 
00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:41.000 align:start position:0%
in the Senate Amendment it would
 
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.149 align:start position:0%
in the Senate Amendment it would
mean

00:20:43.149 --> 00:20:43.159 align:start position:0%
mean
 
00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:48.440 align:start position:0%
um uh could me could mean uh but
 
00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:49.950 align:start position:0%
um uh could me could mean uh but
accepting

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:49.960 align:start position:0%
accepting
 
00:20:53.149 --> 00:20:53.159 align:start position:0%
perdm court security
 
00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
officers and Court Bays I I'm sorry it
 
00:20:58.830 --> 00:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
could mean perd perdm Court court
 
00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
security officers as one
 
00:21:03.669 --> 00:21:03.679 align:start position:0%
category Court
 
00:21:06.669 --> 00:21:06.679 align:start position:0%
BFFs as another category and the
 
00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:09.080 align:start position:0%
assistant director and so that could
 
00:21:12.149 --> 00:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
mean that Court
 
00:21:14.549 --> 00:21:14.559 align:start position:0%
bfts could
 
00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:17.720 align:start position:0%
be categorically accepted even if they
 
00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:18.590 align:start position:0%
be categorically accepted even if they
were

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:22.480 align:start position:0%
full-time whereas if you left it to read
 
00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:25.000 align:start position:0%
but accepting per DM court security
 
00:21:28.149 --> 00:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
officers and Court Bays that would mean
 
00:21:31.029 --> 00:21:31.039 align:start position:0%
per M court security officers and per DM
 
00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:33.320 align:start position:0%
Court bailers that's what it effectively
 
00:21:35.549 --> 00:21:35.559 align:start position:0%
would mean so Mr chairman are you making
 
00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:39.240 align:start position:0%
the proposal that we um put back the
 
00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
word and and take out the comma and take
 
00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:43.960 align:start position:0%
out the comma yes that that I mean I
 
00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
think that would that would solve the
 
00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
problem that was the issue that we would
 
00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
that clear that up for you if we yes it
 
00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:52.120 align:start position:0%
would I I have I I don't think any would
 
00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
you guys agree with this then if we did
 
00:21:57.549 --> 00:21:57.559 align:start position:0%
that yeah well well agre to that that
 
00:21:59.630 --> 00:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
that that that c moves it in the right
 
00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:02.200 align:start position:0%
direction 20 minutes we be like boom
 
00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:04.480 align:start position:0%
boom you've got me for about five more
 
00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
minutes me too we've got another one so
 
00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
here's you know I
 
00:22:14.549 --> 00:22:14.559 align:start position:0%
guess the issue IO I think is this and I
 
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
and perhaps I'll let one of my
 
00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
colleagues can articulate it better
 
00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:19.480 align:start position:0%
because I I'm gonna just tell I'm GNA
 
00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
just be very up front with you
 
00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:24.520 align:start position:0%
I'm I understand my role here is to
 
00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:26.440 align:start position:0%
support the house position and in the
 
00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
end I will do that but I am very
 
00:22:30.909 --> 00:22:30.919 align:start position:0%
sympathetic to what the Senate has done
 
00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
here because I have to say
 
00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:38.440 align:start position:0%
honestly my concern is that we what you
 
00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:39.720 align:start position:0%
what the Senate has done makes sense to
 
00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:42.640 align:start position:0%
me because we have we have a system
 
00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
where for example as I understand it we
 
00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:49.000 align:start position:0%
just had the the the legislative branch
 
00:22:51.789 --> 00:22:51.799 align:start position:0%
just hired an assistant director of
 
00:22:54.789 --> 00:22:54.799 align:start position:0%
security who is retired is a retired
 
00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
state police captain and will be able to
 
00:22:59.789 --> 00:22:59.799 align:start position:0%
double dip
 
00:23:02.549 --> 00:23:02.559 align:start position:0%
and I'm not I don't mean any pejorative
 
00:23:04.789 --> 00:23:04.799 align:start position:0%
term on that at
 
00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:07.640 align:start position:0%
all I have a hard time understanding why
 
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch can't do the same
 
00:23:12.269 --> 00:23:12.279 align:start position:0%
thing well chief justice is here that's
 
00:23:14.549 --> 00:23:14.559 align:start position:0%
why I think the chief justice is here um
 
00:23:16.669 --> 00:23:16.679 align:start position:0%
no I'm because if and I don't mean to
 
00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
speak for the chair of Edna but this was
 
00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:22.360 align:start position:0%
a request that came in from the court to
 
00:23:25.789 --> 00:23:25.799 align:start position:0%
the Senate so that's why we included it
 
00:23:28.269 --> 00:23:28.279 align:start position:0%
so uh it makes perfect sense to us I
 
00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
think think the problem is you have one
 
00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
person who has served on Edna and the
 
00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
rest of you haven't where we all are and
 
00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
we understand this and especially me
 
00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:42.360 align:start position:0%
because as I said we've gotten requests
 
00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:45.440 align:start position:0%
like this and we've given the exemptions
 
00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
um they're very usually very extenuating
 
00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:51.400 align:start position:0%
circumstances so um the court is here
 
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
and I think perhaps Mr chairman it would
 
00:23:55.870 --> 00:23:55.880 align:start position:0%
be good to hear from them why they need
 
00:23:58.470 --> 00:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
this yeah yes but I do want to do I do
 
00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
you want to hear from but representative
 
00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:03.240 align:start position:0%
golden please thank you Mr chair and yes
 
00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:06.760 align:start position:0%
I have been around in with Edna for many
 
00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
years and you know I just got to I need
 
00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
to respond that we've
 
00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
had over the years I've been there we've
 
00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:16.120 align:start position:0%
actually reduced the number of hours
 
00:24:19.269 --> 00:24:19.279 align:start position:0%
that our retired Personnel can work
 
00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
we've had numerous times where Police
 
00:24:26.269 --> 00:24:26.279 align:start position:0%
and Fire Chiefs have come forward
 
00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
looking for us to increase ours because
 
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
of the help they've needed and we stood
 
00:24:33.389 --> 00:24:33.399 align:start position:0%
firm on that over the years um we may
 
00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:37.240 align:start position:0%
have had a few exceptions but I think
 
00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
one of the exceptions I look at when I
 
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
do it is
 
00:24:42.669 --> 00:24:42.679 align:start position:0%
we've both the house and the Senate as
 
00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:44.360 align:start position:0%
we look at it have taken firm positions
 
00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:46.440 align:start position:0%
on the number of hours you work after
 
00:24:48.269 --> 00:24:48.279 align:start position:0%
retirement whether it's a police chief
 
00:24:50.909 --> 00:24:50.919 align:start position:0%
or Fire Chief and I'm looking at the
 
00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
solution as we've done it with Homeland
 
00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:56.480 align:start position:0%
Security and all the other ones is
 
00:24:59.190 --> 00:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
allowing that individual become group
 
00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
two which we just heard Marty say it
 
00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
could be done making that a group two
 
00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:05.240 align:start position:0%
position where someone transfers over
 
00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:07.240 align:start position:0%
just like per plumber did over to where
 
00:25:09.909 --> 00:25:09.919 align:start position:0%
he did and allow that person to continue
 
00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:11.960 align:start position:0%
working and paying into the
 
00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
system going forward and it's a group
 
00:25:16.669 --> 00:25:16.679 align:start position:0%
two position from there on out and
 
00:25:18.909 --> 00:25:18.919 align:start position:0%
that's where my argument is where we
 
00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:21.080 align:start position:0%
should be going not exempting another
 
00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:22.840 align:start position:0%
employee and taking someone off when we
 
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
tell all these police departments and
 
00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
fire departments we won't allow you to
 
00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:26.600 align:start position:0%
do that with your Chiefs I don't think
 
00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:28.720 align:start position:0%
it's fair to them
 
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
and and if I could just add one thing
 
00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:34.840 align:start position:0%
Senator I understand your time um it is
 
00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
that although I haven't been on Edna I
 
00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:40.440 align:start position:0%
have been on finance and I know the
 
00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:43.000 align:start position:0%
incredible problems that we have with
 
00:25:45.269 --> 00:25:45.279 align:start position:0%
the retirement system because of the
 
00:25:47.549 --> 00:25:47.559 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability that we have been
 
00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:51.080 align:start position:0%
struggling to address and so from that
 
00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
point of view I have concerns um about
 
00:26:01.149 --> 00:26:01.159 align:start position:0%
opening up um a rabbit
 
00:26:04.669 --> 00:26:04.679 align:start position:0%
hole you know can I just add I wonder if
 
00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:06.320 align:start position:0%
uh chief justice McDonald I wonder if we
 
00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
could just if you could just give us a
 
00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:10.720 align:start position:0%
couple of minutes to just explain why
 
00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:13.000 align:start position:0%
you think this is so important to uh to
 
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.510 align:start position:0%
you think this is so important to uh to
do

00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
this thank you Mr chairman for the
 
00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
record my name is Gordon McDonald I'm
 
00:26:20.190 --> 00:26:20.200 align:start position:0%
the Chief Justice and I understand the
 
00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:22.760 align:start position:0%
Senators are under time constraint but
 
00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:23.640 align:start position:0%
I'll be
 
00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
blunt my number one priority is ensuring
 
00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:30.200 align:start position:0%
this Safety and Security of everyone who
 
00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
walks through our doors every day
 
00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
hundreds of people in more than 40
 
00:26:36.909 --> 00:26:36.919 align:start position:0%
locations around the
 
00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
state litigant the public members of the
 
00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
media our 800 staff and and
 
00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
judges the threat environment that we
 
00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:50.200 align:start position:0%
are facing is
 
00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
complex and it's
 
00:26:55.029 --> 00:26:55.039 align:start position:0%
immediate and everyone in the judicial
 
00:26:58.830 --> 00:26:58.840 align:start position:0%
branch felt deeply
 
00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
about the events at New Hampshire
 
00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:04.520 align:start position:0%
hospital we have a courtroom in that
 
00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:08.720 align:start position:0%
facility we mourn the loss of Chief hos
 
00:27:10.789 --> 00:27:10.799 align:start position:0%
but more directly to the state court
 
00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:13.960 align:start position:0%
community a state court judge in
 
00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:15.880 align:start position:0%
Maryland was
 
00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
assassinated in his driveway last
 
00:27:20.669 --> 00:27:20.679 align:start position:0%
October Judge Andrew
 
00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:23.480 align:start position:0%
Wilkinson the threats out there are
 
00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
numerous they are complex and we need to
 
00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
do all we can
 
00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
and literally what keeps me up at night
 
00:27:34.789 --> 00:27:34.799 align:start position:0%
is this that question are we doing all
 
00:27:34.799 --> 00:27:35.549 align:start position:0%
is this that question are we doing all
we

00:27:35.549 --> 00:27:35.559 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
can and that is why I'm here today that
 
00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
is why this is so important to to me and
 
00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:44.360 align:start position:0%
the leadership of the judicial
 
00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
branch we've started a number of
 
00:27:48.789 --> 00:27:48.799 align:start position:0%
initiatives with respect to training and
 
00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:51.480 align:start position:0%
equipping our court security officers to
 
00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:55.640 align:start position:0%
en fortifying our uh facilities but we
 
00:27:59.870 --> 00:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:02.389 --> 00:28:02.399 align:start position:0%
exactly what this exemption is asking
 
00:28:05.509 --> 00:28:05.519 align:start position:0%
for and that's Decades of experience
 
00:28:08.029 --> 00:28:08.039 align:start position:0%
from State Police that the state has
 
00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:11.640 align:start position:0%
invested in we want to leverage that so
 
00:28:14.269 --> 00:28:14.279 align:start position:0%
it's double dipping in a different sense
 
00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
it's leveraging that experience and what
 
00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:19.960 align:start position:0%
do we need it in threat
 
00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:23.320 align:start position:0%
assessment cooperation with State local
 
00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:25.720 align:start position:0%
County and federal law enforcement
 
00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
increasing our physical safety in
 
00:28:30.789 --> 00:28:30.799 align:start position:0%
enhancing our training retention and
 
00:28:33.149 --> 00:28:33.159 align:start position:0%
recruitment that is why we need this
 
00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
exception and to the chair's Point we've
 
00:28:37.509 --> 00:28:37.519 align:start position:0%
been working closely with the
 
00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
legislative leadership working in tandem
 
00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
we are asking for nothing more than what
 
00:28:46.149 --> 00:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
the legislature has done in appointing a
 
00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
full-time assistant director of Safety
 
00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:51.320 align:start position:0%
and Security with the kind of background
 
00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:53.720 align:start position:0%
that the legislature has uh found and
 
00:28:56.149 --> 00:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
kept in better and we found in our
 
00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
employee and I just think as a matter of
 
00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
comedy and respect for the judicial
 
00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
branch and what we think we need to do
 
00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
to keep people safe in our facilities I
 
00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:08.120 align:start position:0%
would respectfully request this
 
00:29:11.389 --> 00:29:11.399 align:start position:0%
committee to concur with the Senate
 
00:29:13.509 --> 00:29:13.519 align:start position:0%
Amendment Mr chair in the interest of
 
00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:15.080 align:start position:0%
time we are going to have to run here
 
00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
soon I I think I can speak for all of us
 
00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
saying we we're willing to make the
 
00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
technical change that you wanted to but
 
00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
I I think we're going to insist that
 
00:29:27.389 --> 00:29:27.399 align:start position:0%
this language stays in the bill we're I
 
00:29:29.149 --> 00:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
mean you kind of know where I'm standing
 
00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
but I'm I'm wondering where everybody
 
00:29:36.149 --> 00:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
else on the house side stands sure I as
 
00:29:39.029 --> 00:29:39.039 align:start position:0%
I said I I I I I want to emphasize I
 
00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:40.360 align:start position:0%
don't for a
 
00:29:43.909 --> 00:29:43.919 align:start position:0%
minute poo poo uh or or discount the
 
00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:46.120 align:start position:0%
concerns that uh representative goalie
 
00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:48.200 align:start position:0%
and representative Smith have have said
 
00:29:50.909 --> 00:29:50.919 align:start position:0%
I I understand and I understand that you
 
00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:52.840 align:start position:0%
know we're making an exception and I an
 
00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
argument can be made that every time you
 
00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:56.480 align:start position:0%
make an exception you know you make it
 
00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:00.200 align:start position:0%
harder to to uh enforce the rule I I do
 
00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:02.840 align:start position:0%
understand that but I think I mean I
 
00:30:05.310 --> 00:30:05.320 align:start position:0%
think that the chief on the other side
 
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
of this has a pretty good argument that
 
00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:11.960 align:start position:0%
you know we maybe it maybe hiso maybe
 
00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
you know in some at some point in the in
 
00:30:18.509 --> 00:30:18.519 align:start position:0%
the future we we ought to consider you
 
00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
know some kind of restructuring of the
 
00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:22.760 align:start position:0%
of the judicial branch so that they have
 
00:30:25.509 --> 00:30:25.519 align:start position:0%
exempt employees um or that kind of
 
00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
thing or per or uh people appointed for
 
00:30:31.509 --> 00:30:31.519 align:start position:0%
a specific term maybe that would make
 
00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
sense you know so that so that the
 
00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:38.320 align:start position:0%
exceptions uh that might might apply in
 
00:30:40.029 --> 00:30:40.039 align:start position:0%
that circumstance would be this would be
 
00:30:41.909 --> 00:30:41.919 align:start position:0%
analogous to what currently exists in
 
00:30:44.549 --> 00:30:44.559 align:start position:0%
the legislature but that's an to me
 
00:30:47.509 --> 00:30:47.519 align:start position:0%
that's an issue for another day I I tend
 
00:30:49.149 --> 00:30:49.159 align:start position:0%
to think that the chief has made a
 
00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
pretty compelling case of why we ought
 
00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
to do this now and could I ask
 
00:30:58.990 --> 00:30:59.000 align:start position:0%
course thank you so much for being here
 
00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chief justice um tell me what the
 
00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
problem is um with having
 
00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:10.240 align:start position:0%
um the gentleman you've identified come
 
00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:12.440 align:start position:0%
into this position which we all
 
00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:15.480 align:start position:0%
recognize as important as a full-time
 
00:31:18.549 --> 00:31:18.559 align:start position:0%
group 2 employee what's the problem with
 
00:31:20.669 --> 00:31:20.679 align:start position:0%
that I think there's a separation of
 
00:31:22.629 --> 00:31:22.639 align:start position:0%
powers problem to my knowledge we have
 
00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:25.320 align:start position:0%
no group two employees group two are
 
00:31:28.669 --> 00:31:28.679 align:start position:0%
executive group law enforcement is an
 
00:31:28.679 --> 00:31:30.070 align:start position:0%
executive group law enforcement is an
executive

00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
executive
 
00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:34.480 align:start position:0%
function we provide court security in
 
00:31:37.549 --> 00:31:37.559 align:start position:0%
the courtrooms that is a completely
 
00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
different function than what is
 
00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
discharged by group to employees which
 
00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:43.480 align:start position:0%
is generally law to my knowledge law
 
00:31:47.629 --> 00:31:47.639 align:start position:0%
enforcement fire protection safety our
 
00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
our our goal in establishing this
 
00:31:54.549 --> 00:31:54.559 align:start position:0%
position is to bring the expertise that
 
00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:56.840 align:start position:0%
former law enforcement has to the
 
00:31:58.509 --> 00:31:58.519 align:start position:0%
special and unique need needs that
 
00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:00.440 align:start position:0%
judicial branch has in providing Safety
 
00:32:02.629 --> 00:32:02.639 align:start position:0%
and Security so you want the training
 
00:32:05.149 --> 00:32:05.159 align:start position:0%
you want the experience you want the
 
00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:08.720 align:start position:0%
expertise um you just don't want him to
 
00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
have to comply with group TR two I I
 
00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
want parody with the legislative branch
 
00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:18.200 align:start position:0%
to be completely blunt and I think I
 
00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:20.840 align:start position:0%
think the judicial branch the judicial
 
00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
branch has identified this as a need and
 
00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:26.360 align:start position:0%
and the legislative branch has an
 
00:32:29.549 --> 00:32:29.559 align:start position:0%
exemption under 100
 
00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
A7 and this is the same need that we
 
00:32:35.470 --> 00:32:35.480 align:start position:0%
have as a separate branch of government
 
00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
and I I'm I just respectfully would urge
 
00:32:42.389 --> 00:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
the legislature to exceed to what the
 
00:32:45.509 --> 00:32:45.519 align:start position:0%
leg what the Judiciary is asking for
 
00:32:48.029 --> 00:32:48.039 align:start position:0%
here you know can I just make one other
 
00:32:49.909 --> 00:32:49.919 align:start position:0%
comment you know I had I have to say I
 
00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:52.200 align:start position:0%
had not even thought frankly until the
 
00:32:53.909 --> 00:32:53.919 align:start position:0%
chief just mentioned this about the
 
00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
about the the group the separation of
 
00:32:58.389 --> 00:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
powers issue but I think that is I mean
 
00:32:59.389 --> 00:32:59.399 align:start position:0%
we do
 
00:33:02.149 --> 00:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
we as I understand it correct me if I'm
 
00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:07.000 align:start position:0%
wrong Chief the the the court the court
 
00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
security even R even Line Court security
 
00:33:13.509 --> 00:33:13.519 align:start position:0%
officers are not group two employees
 
00:33:15.549 --> 00:33:15.559 align:start position:0%
because they're not Law Enforcement
 
00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:17.440 align:start position:0%
Officers that's correct they are not
 
00:33:18.789 --> 00:33:18.799 align:start position:0%
sworn law enforcement that's I mean
 
00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
that's another to say you know it's we
 
00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:23.720 align:start position:0%
we don't I think what the chief is
 
00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
saying and I think I agree with this
 
00:33:27.269 --> 00:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
completely we don't have the option of
 
00:33:27.279 --> 00:33:28.389 align:start position:0%
completely we don't have the option of
doing

00:33:28.389 --> 00:33:28.399 align:start position:0%
doing
 
00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
of of amending the statute in the way
 
00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:31.880 align:start position:0%
you suggested representative goalie
 
00:33:34.190 --> 00:33:34.200 align:start position:0%
because we would be making we'd be
 
00:33:37.909 --> 00:33:37.919 align:start position:0%
creating one law enforcement officer um
 
00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
in the judicial branch in a position
 
00:33:41.629 --> 00:33:41.639 align:start position:0%
that I think is
 
00:33:43.909 --> 00:33:43.919 align:start position:0%
inconsistent the judicial the judicial
 
00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:45.880 align:start position:0%
branch doesn't have Law Enforcement
 
00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
Officers presumably this law enforcement
 
00:33:50.509 --> 00:33:50.519 align:start position:0%
officer would be subject subject to the
 
00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
direction of the control of the chief
 
00:33:53.789 --> 00:33:53.799 align:start position:0%
justice so that makes no sense under our
 
00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
system of
 
00:33:57.389 --> 00:33:57.399 align:start position:0%
government Mr chair we're going to have
 
00:34:00.629 --> 00:34:00.639 align:start position:0%
to either recess this or come to an agre
 
00:34:03.389 --> 00:34:03.399 align:start position:0%
realt so let me ask you I mean let me
 
00:34:06.269 --> 00:34:06.279 align:start position:0%
ask my colleagues where where they
 
00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
are and I have no problem in recessing
 
00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
this if we need more time um but I'm
 
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
just wondering
 
00:34:16.909 --> 00:34:16.919 align:start position:0%
where think the of the
 
00:34:20.430 --> 00:34:20.440 align:start position:0%
situational threats there I've been
 
00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:24.200 align:start position:0%
moved support it with with the one
 
00:34:33.109 --> 00:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:33.119 --> 00:34:34.750 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:34.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:34:37.950 --> 00:34:37.960 align:start position:0%
let's so let's do the let's let's recess
 
00:34:42.869 --> 00:34:42.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:45.349 --> 00:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
what no no no I understand but I want to
 
00:34:46.669 --> 00:34:46.679 align:start position:0%
have I I think I want to have a
 
00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
conversation with the speaker before
 
00:34:50.829 --> 00:34:50.839 align:start position:0%

and I believe um uh I'll let everyone
 
02:01:51.270 --> 02:01:51.280 align:start position:0%
else speak if they have something to say
 
02:01:54.589 --> 02:01:54.599 align:start position:0%
I believe have come uh the house is uh
 
02:01:58.189 --> 02:01:58.199 align:start position:0%
in agreement now with the Senate version
 
02:02:00.750 --> 02:02:00.760 align:start position:0%
with the one change of the comma that we
 
02:02:05.510 --> 02:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
that we talked about um and so um I I
 
02:02:07.310 --> 02:02:07.320 align:start position:0%
called OS and told him I asked him if
 
02:02:08.350 --> 02:02:08.360 align:start position:0%
they could draft so they said they
 
02:02:09.709 --> 02:02:09.719 align:start position:0%
probably weren't going to have it ready
 
02:02:12.790 --> 02:02:12.800 align:start position:0%
by SE by 11:30 but um they they will
 
02:02:14.589 --> 02:02:14.599 align:start position:0%
draft something which will be the Senate
 
02:02:17.750 --> 02:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
version of the bill with the one change
 
02:02:20.229 --> 02:02:20.239 align:start position:0%
to removing the comma and putting the
 
02:02:24.270 --> 02:02:24.280 align:start position:0%
word and back in okay um is that um am I
 
02:02:26.030 --> 02:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
speaking correctly for everyone in the
 
02:02:29.950 --> 02:02:29.960 align:start position:0%

house version here and a senate version
 
03:30:10.590 --> 03:30:10.600 align:start position:0%
we'd like to go down
 
03:30:13.910 --> 03:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
and and try to either you know present
 
03:30:16.429 --> 03:30:16.439 align:start position:0%
where we are on our positions uh I'll

open up first to representa cordelli do
 
03:30:19.550 --> 03:30:19.560 align:start position:0%
you have an amendment that we're
 
03:30:22.950 --> 03:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:25.950 --> 03:30:25.960 align:start position:0%
ours uh yes I do and it uh is an
 
03:30:29.030 --> 03:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
amendment to the uh language that was
 
03:30:42.550 --> 03:30:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:46.870 --> 03:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
Senate basically the uh Senate added
 
03:30:49.510 --> 03:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
um what had been I believe it was Senate
 
03:30:49.520 --> 03:30:50.710 align:start position:0%
um what had been I believe it was Senate
Bill

03:30:50.710 --> 03:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
03:30:54.070 --> 03:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
219 um on to
 
03:30:58.710 --> 03:30:58.720 align:start position:0%
1265 and um we made it uh this amendment
 
03:31:01.750 --> 03:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
with a couple of changes to what was
 
03:31:07.070 --> 03:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
added um in the Senate um the first
 
03:31:10.189 --> 03:31:10.199 align:start position:0%
edition uh uh that you'll see on lines 3
 
03:31:13.910 --> 03:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
through five is related to the cost per
 
03:31:17.990 --> 03:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
pupil which is required to be uh
 
03:31:22.150 --> 03:31:22.160 align:start position:0%
displayed uh we made this change so that
 
03:31:25.990 --> 03:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
it's consistent with the Department of
 
03:31:27.910 --> 03:31:27.920 align:start position:0%
Education uh
 
03:31:31.070 --> 03:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
calculation uh strictly for consistency
 
03:31:33.590 --> 03:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
purposes um and in the
 
03:31:36.469 --> 03:31:36.479 align:start position:0%
calculation is added that the
 
03:31:39.630 --> 03:31:39.640 align:start position:0%
expenditures for tuition
 
03:31:42.670 --> 03:31:42.680 align:start position:0%
transportation and food operations not
 
03:31:47.070 --> 03:31:47.080 align:start position:0%
supported by public funds are excluded
 
03:31:49.750 --> 03:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
from the calculation of cost per
 
03:31:57.269 --> 03:31:57.279 align:start position:0%
pupil um still in the um in the language
 
03:32:00.030 --> 03:32:00.040 align:start position:0%
um will be uh
 
03:32:05.269 --> 03:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
options uh B and C um and that this is a
 
03:32:08.030 --> 03:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
a good faith effort uh by the district
 
03:32:12.630 --> 03:32:12.640 align:start position:0%
to arrive at the um cost per
 
03:32:14.790 --> 03:32:14.800 align:start position:0%
pupil okay before you jump on any
 
03:32:16.670 --> 03:32:16.680 align:start position:0%
further with your
 
03:32:18.790 --> 03:32:18.800 align:start position:0%
if we want to discuss why we did this
 
03:32:20.550 --> 03:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
that there are school districts you all
 
03:32:23.870 --> 03:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
have to report on your annual form the
 
03:32:26.349 --> 03:32:26.359 align:start position:0%
do25 form and they break out food
 
03:32:29.670 --> 03:32:29.680 align:start position:0%
service and transportation separately
 
03:32:31.510 --> 03:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
some districts when they look at this
 
03:32:33.870 --> 03:32:33.880 align:start position:0%
incorporate those costs in so we're
 
03:32:35.830 --> 03:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
trying to get a consistent figure across
 
03:32:38.030 --> 03:32:38.040 align:start position:0%
the board for all districts so District
 
03:32:40.429 --> 03:32:40.439 align:start position:0%
a right beside District B is reporting
 
03:32:43.990 --> 03:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
on the same data uh so that that's the
 
03:32:45.389 --> 03:32:45.399 align:start position:0%
premise behind what we're trying to do
 
03:32:45.399 --> 03:32:46.830 align:start position:0%
premise behind what we're trying to do
here

03:32:46.830 --> 03:32:46.840 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:32:50.429 --> 03:32:50.439 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Glen yeah um and as I
 
03:32:54.349 --> 03:32:54.359 align:start position:0%
said still are um uh points B and C and
 
03:32:57.429 --> 03:32:57.439 align:start position:0%
that this is a um reasonable and good
 
03:33:02.030 --> 03:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
faith estimate and uh the uh amount in
 
03:33:03.790 --> 03:33:03.800 align:start position:0%
good faith by the Department of
 
03:33:07.389 --> 03:33:07.399 align:start position:0%
Education um responds to uh to a which
 
03:33:09.030 --> 03:33:09.040 align:start position:0%
we just
 
03:33:12.790 --> 03:33:12.800 align:start position:0%
amended the um the other
 
03:33:16.630 --> 03:33:16.640 align:start position:0%
changes uh go down to um if you're
 
03:33:18.349 --> 03:33:18.359 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
03:33:23.110 --> 03:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
the um I'll try and look at the uh side
 
03:33:23.120 --> 03:33:24.870 align:start position:0%
the um I'll try and look at the uh side
by

03:33:24.870 --> 03:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
by
 
03:33:37.670 --> 03:33:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:41.710 --> 03:33:41.720 align:start position:0%
4 which is on um page
 
03:33:45.429 --> 03:33:45.439 align:start position:0%
four and what we changed here was we
 
03:33:45.439 --> 03:33:46.670 align:start position:0%
four and what we changed here was we
added

03:33:46.670 --> 03:33:46.680 align:start position:0%
added
 
03:33:49.429 --> 03:33:49.439 align:start position:0%
that uh some administrators employed by
 
03:33:52.469 --> 03:33:52.479 align:start position:0%
the district may be contract
 
03:33:54.710 --> 03:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
employees um that was a suggestion from
 
03:33:56.389 --> 03:33:56.399 align:start position:0%
the Department all these changes were
 
03:33:58.229 --> 03:33:58.239 align:start position:0%
worked on with the Department of
 
03:33:59.670 --> 03:33:59.680 align:start position:0%
Education the other
 
03:34:03.429 --> 03:34:03.439 align:start position:0%
day so um this would be salaries paid to
 
03:34:06.110 --> 03:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
administrators imp employed or
 
03:34:10.150 --> 03:34:10.160 align:start position:0%
contracted by the district and the same
 
03:34:14.189 --> 03:34:14.199 align:start position:0%
or contracted is added in Roman 5 in
 
03:34:17.070 --> 03:34:17.080 align:start position:0%
terms of the employees
 
03:34:20.950 --> 03:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh salaries the administrator
 
03:34:23.670 --> 03:34:23.680 align:start position:0%
salaries um one other change there
 
03:34:23.680 --> 03:34:25.030 align:start position:0%
salaries um one other change there
you'll

03:34:25.030 --> 03:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
you'll
 
03:34:28.429 --> 03:34:28.439 align:start position:0%
see in Roman
 
03:34:30.590 --> 03:34:30.600 align:start position:0%
4 um it
 
03:34:30.600 --> 03:34:32.229 align:start position:0%
4 um it
says

03:34:32.229 --> 03:34:32.239 align:start position:0%
says
 
03:34:35.030 --> 03:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
um employed by the district
 
03:34:37.710 --> 03:34:37.720 align:start position:0%
corresponding School administrators unit
 
03:34:42.349 --> 03:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
over the previous 10 years we added in a
 
03:34:46.189 --> 03:34:46.199 align:start position:0%
SE a sentence which reads on
 
03:34:48.670 --> 03:34:48.680 align:start position:0%
year Amendment administrators serving
 
03:34:50.670 --> 03:34:50.680 align:start position:0%
multiple districts may have an
 
03:34:53.510 --> 03:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
annotation showing how their salary is a
 
03:34:56.150 --> 03:34:56.160 align:start position:0%
portioned between multiple
 
03:35:00.790 --> 03:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
districts so if um you know working with
 
03:35:03.110 --> 03:35:03.120 align:start position:0%
the Department we felt that uh if it's a
 
03:35:05.830 --> 03:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
shared position um the district should
 
03:35:08.229 --> 03:35:08.239 align:start position:0%
show their share of the employees
 
03:35:11.910 --> 03:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
salaries so go ahead again so the idea
 
03:35:13.110 --> 03:35:13.120 align:start position:0%
being that if I have a principal at
 
03:35:15.429 --> 03:35:15.439 align:start position:0%
servicing two two schools in a different
 
03:35:17.309 --> 03:35:17.319 align:start position:0%
in different District they have 50% time
 
03:35:20.309 --> 03:35:20.319 align:start position:0%
in each you would annotate his salaries
 
03:35:22.710 --> 03:35:22.720 align:start position:0%
$100,000 $50,000 of this district and
 
03:35:24.389 --> 03:35:24.399 align:start position:0%
$50,000 of this district has an
 
03:35:26.389 --> 03:35:26.399 align:start position:0%
annotation on the report right thank you
 
03:35:28.710 --> 03:35:28.720 align:start position:0%
and that is common in some places in in
 
03:35:28.720 --> 03:35:31.229 align:start position:0%
and that is common in some places in in
our

03:35:31.229 --> 03:35:31.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:35.590 --> 03:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
saus um and the only other change to the
 
03:35:38.630 --> 03:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
Senate language was the uh effective
 
03:35:42.229 --> 03:35:42.239 align:start position:0%
date we changed it from January 1st to
 
03:35:46.110 --> 03:35:46.120 align:start position:0%
July 1st uh to better align align with
 
03:35:49.229 --> 03:35:49.239 align:start position:0%
the um uh Gathering of information from
 
03:35:53.630 --> 03:35:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:56.510 --> 03:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
fall and we do have mark
 
03:35:58.950 --> 03:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
from the Department here if you have any
 
03:36:02.110 --> 03:36:02.120 align:start position:0%
questions on this Mark Mone is was
 
03:36:03.630 --> 03:36:03.640 align:start position:0%
working with the LBA before he went over
 
03:36:07.710 --> 03:36:07.720 align:start position:0%
and decided to cross town right Mark do
 
03:36:09.790 --> 03:36:09.800 align:start position:0%
you have any
 
03:36:12.150 --> 03:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
questions I don't have any questions I I
 
03:36:14.110 --> 03:36:14.120 align:start position:0%
think that um several these changes make
 
03:36:15.910 --> 03:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
some good sense and I don't have that
 
03:36:19.590 --> 03:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
much objection to it all um Senator Lang
 
03:36:21.309 --> 03:36:21.319 align:start position:0%
you have any uh questions or concerns
 
03:36:24.550 --> 03:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
about the change to lines four and five
 
03:36:26.910 --> 03:36:26.920 align:start position:0%
so again so I think we're talking about
 
03:36:29.189 --> 03:36:29.199 align:start position:0%
the again going I one of the things I
 
03:36:30.910 --> 03:36:30.920 align:start position:0%
was get ready to defend was why we added
 
03:36:32.910 --> 03:36:32.920 align:start position:0%
this bill and talk about transparency
 
03:36:34.750 --> 03:36:34.760 align:start position:0%
fact that I went to go pull up just from
 
03:36:37.469 --> 03:36:37.479 align:start position:0%
wi my home district ms25 and try to find
 
03:36:38.750 --> 03:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
the administrative salaries versus
 
03:36:41.710 --> 03:36:41.720 align:start position:0%
anything else and it was not an easy
 
03:36:44.030 --> 03:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
task and I served on the school board um
 
03:36:48.030 --> 03:36:48.040 align:start position:0%
for for for six years so um so that was
 
03:36:50.070 --> 03:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill is to make it
 
03:36:51.750 --> 03:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
clear to the voter those kind of things
 
03:36:53.389 --> 03:36:53.399 align:start position:0%
that are extremely important to the
 
03:36:57.990 --> 03:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
voters um so and I understand again they
 
03:37:01.309 --> 03:37:01.319 align:start position:0%
do on that form specifically carve out
 
03:37:04.469 --> 03:37:04.479 align:start position:0%
those expenses separate and and so it
 
03:37:05.830 --> 03:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
makes sense to me that we're talking
 
03:37:08.790 --> 03:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
about the actual educational expense in
 
03:37:10.590 --> 03:37:10.600 align:start position:0%
terms of classroom expense not
 
03:37:12.189 --> 03:37:12.199 align:start position:0%
necessarily food and transportation
 
03:37:20.590 --> 03:37:20.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:23.750 --> 03:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
so um with these amendments it still has
 
03:37:25.990 --> 03:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
the district has to do a graph and post
 
03:37:28.790 --> 03:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
it yes all that's the same remains in it
 
03:37:30.630 --> 03:37:30.640 align:start position:0%
so that's assuming that districts have
 
03:37:33.269 --> 03:37:33.279 align:start position:0%
the capability of of doing those graphs
 
03:37:36.550 --> 03:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
and posting them in all these places and
 
03:37:38.269 --> 03:37:38.279 align:start position:0%
is it taking into account how much time
 
03:37:42.469 --> 03:37:42.479 align:start position:0%
that will take each district to
 
03:37:46.510 --> 03:37:46.520 align:start position:0%
do so we recognize that it's it's uh
 
03:37:49.309 --> 03:37:49.319 align:start position:0%
going to be uh an increased workload to
 
03:37:51.710 --> 03:37:51.720 align:start position:0%
some extent but again given this isn't
 
03:37:53.710 --> 03:37:53.720 align:start position:0%
somebody with an abacus and a piece of
 
03:37:55.670 --> 03:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
paper trying to Divi Define something
 
03:37:57.110 --> 03:37:57.120 align:start position:0%
again these are all digital graphs
 
03:37:59.710 --> 03:37:59.720 align:start position:0%
that'll come out of excel um with the
 
03:38:01.229 --> 03:38:01.239 align:start position:0%
input of the data and the data is All
 
03:38:03.750 --> 03:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
Digital to begin with so this isn't this
 
03:38:06.710 --> 03:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
isn't days and weeks of labor nowadays
 
03:38:09.630 --> 03:38:09.640 align:start position:0%
this is hours at most and again the
 
03:38:11.309 --> 03:38:11.319 align:start position:0%
question is weighing out those couple
 
03:38:13.309 --> 03:38:13.319 align:start position:0%
hours against the transparency needs of
 
03:38:15.590 --> 03:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
the voters to understand budgeting and
 
03:38:17.630 --> 03:38:17.640 align:start position:0%
budgeting is occurring I think it's a
 
03:38:21.870 --> 03:38:21.880 align:start position:0%
good use of of time to educate the the
 
03:38:24.349 --> 03:38:24.359 align:start position:0%
people who are paying the bill and
 
03:38:26.870 --> 03:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
followup yes and this is this isn't just
 
03:38:28.830 --> 03:38:28.840 align:start position:0%
easily findable on the Department of
 
03:38:31.750 --> 03:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
Education website it is not it is there
 
03:38:34.189 --> 03:38:34.199 align:start position:0%
it is not easily found I just spent I
 
03:38:36.070 --> 03:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
just spent the last 30 minutes trying to
 
03:38:37.830 --> 03:38:37.840 align:start position:0%
do my one school district to try to see
 
03:38:39.469 --> 03:38:39.479 align:start position:0%
if I could easily pull out the
 
03:38:41.150 --> 03:38:41.160 align:start position:0%
administrative cost and the things that
 
03:38:42.910 --> 03:38:42.920 align:start position:0%
were interesting I wrote notes on if I
 
03:38:47.070 --> 03:38:47.080 align:start position:0%
can find My Notes now um was you know
 
03:38:49.309 --> 03:38:49.319 align:start position:0%
they they group things in general into a
 
03:38:51.429 --> 03:38:51.439 align:start position:0%
single line says general Administration
 
03:38:52.870 --> 03:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
so you don't know what it is unless you
 
03:38:55.269 --> 03:38:55.279 align:start position:0%
then go get the the actual district
 
03:38:57.349 --> 03:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
report to that reports the salaries to
 
03:38:59.229 --> 03:38:59.239 align:start position:0%
figure out which falls under which
 
03:39:01.950 --> 03:39:01.960 align:start position:0%
category they they put things in codes
 
03:39:05.630 --> 03:39:05.640 align:start position:0%
100 1200 1300 1400 again unless you went
 
03:39:07.429 --> 03:39:07.439 align:start position:0%
back to refer to the original report to
 
03:39:09.150 --> 03:39:09.160 align:start position:0%
try to dig out thing that even the
 
03:39:11.550 --> 03:39:11.560 align:start position:0%
information on the doe websites not
 
03:39:13.830 --> 03:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
detailed so if someone went to doe to
 
03:39:16.070 --> 03:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
pull up the report would then have to go
 
03:39:17.469 --> 03:39:17.479 align:start position:0%
pull up the local district report to
 
03:39:19.429 --> 03:39:19.439 align:start position:0%
figure out where people fit you know
 
03:39:21.910 --> 03:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
they have a a a simple single line item
 
03:39:23.110 --> 03:39:23.120 align:start position:0%
that's School
 
03:39:25.469 --> 03:39:25.479 align:start position:0%
Administration in there doesn't detail
 
03:39:27.229 --> 03:39:27.239 align:start position:0%
any how many positions that references
 
03:39:29.309 --> 03:39:29.319 align:start position:0%
or anything else on the doe website you
 
03:39:30.710 --> 03:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
would have to then go back down and
 
03:39:32.790 --> 03:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
figure out which category by looking at
 
03:39:35.150 --> 03:39:35.160 align:start position:0%
the book I I think it's easy for us to
 
03:39:37.269 --> 03:39:37.279 align:start position:0%
lose sight of the fact that our voters
 
03:39:39.790 --> 03:39:39.800 align:start position:0%
are not CPAs and they're not policy
 
03:39:41.550 --> 03:39:41.560 align:start position:0%
people they don't necessarily serve on
 
03:39:43.630 --> 03:39:43.640 align:start position:0%
the budget committee right and and they
 
03:39:45.030 --> 03:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
just know what their tax bill looks like
 
03:39:46.229 --> 03:39:46.239 align:start position:0%
and they want to know where it's being
 
03:39:49.070 --> 03:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
spent and so the idea being this makes
 
03:39:50.670 --> 03:39:50.680 align:start position:0%
it more transparent and easier for them
 
03:39:52.590 --> 03:39:52.600 align:start position:0%
to see where money is being
 
03:39:57.110 --> 03:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
spent further comments from the
 
03:40:00.670 --> 03:40:00.680 align:start position:0%
committee represent courel and it still
 
03:40:06.070 --> 03:40:06.080 align:start position:0%
leaves in the um civil remedies so any
 
03:40:08.389 --> 03:40:08.399 align:start position:0%
taxpayer in the taxing district who is
 
03:40:10.790 --> 03:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
aggrieved by a violation of this Chapel
 
03:40:13.870 --> 03:40:13.880 align:start position:0%
May petition the court for
 
03:40:22.790 --> 03:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:25.910 --> 03:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
amendment so again in this instance
 
03:40:28.030 --> 03:40:28.040 align:start position:0%
under the Civil remedies there's no
 
03:40:29.950 --> 03:40:29.960 align:start position:0%
costs associated with the Civil remedy
 
03:40:31.670 --> 03:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
what it is is it the judge ordering the
 
03:40:33.790 --> 03:40:33.800 align:start position:0%
district to comply and the district
 
03:40:35.550 --> 03:40:35.560 align:start position:0%
would then have to
 
03:40:37.590 --> 03:40:37.600 align:start position:0%
comply and they be subject to any
 
03:40:39.110 --> 03:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
attorneys fees if they had to bring it
 
03:40:40.750 --> 03:40:40.760 align:start position:0%
this because the district refused to
 
03:40:43.670 --> 03:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
comply with the with the law um they
 
03:40:45.830 --> 03:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
would be able to recover their cost back
 
03:40:47.269 --> 03:40:47.279 align:start position:0%
for having the sue the district to force
 
03:40:49.349 --> 03:40:49.359 align:start position:0%
them to comply with the
 
03:40:53.750 --> 03:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
law we have uh debated many times uh
 
03:40:57.269 --> 03:40:57.279 align:start position:0%
about um the requirements to get uh
 
03:40:59.469 --> 03:40:59.479 align:start position:0%
whether it's a school district or other
 
03:41:02.469 --> 03:41:02.479 align:start position:0%
agency to comply with a a law that we
 
03:41:05.550 --> 03:41:05.560 align:start position:0%
passed and uh we've said that uh you
 
03:41:08.150 --> 03:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
know perhaps we need more teeth in some
 
03:41:11.189 --> 03:41:11.199 align:start position:0%
of these statutes um and this is a a
 
03:41:15.870 --> 03:41:15.880 align:start position:0%
mild step um uh in terms of remedies
 
03:41:19.269 --> 03:41:19.279 align:start position:0%
um it's often said that uh uh a law
 
03:41:22.990 --> 03:41:23.000 align:start position:0%
without teeth is a is a suggestion so uh
 
03:41:27.189 --> 03:41:27.199 align:start position:0%
I think this is something um that is uh
 
03:41:30.389 --> 03:41:30.399 align:start position:0%
really needed for transparency for not
 
03:41:32.910 --> 03:41:32.920 align:start position:0%
just the voters but in many cases uh
 
03:41:34.590 --> 03:41:34.600 align:start position:0%
Schoolboard members uh might be
 
03:41:36.429 --> 03:41:36.439 align:start position:0%
interested in this information also when
 
03:41:38.870 --> 03:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
they're contemplating the budget you
 
03:41:40.469 --> 03:41:40.479 align:start position:0%
know it's it's amazing how some
 
03:41:42.229 --> 03:41:42.239 align:start position:0%
districts are providing this in their
 
03:41:45.910 --> 03:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
annual reports others are not
 
03:41:48.630 --> 03:41:48.640 align:start position:0%
and and so the information has been
 
03:41:50.950 --> 03:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
available my concern is it even goes
 
03:41:54.469 --> 03:41:54.479 align:start position:0%
deeper than this is that um we've been
 
03:41:57.429 --> 03:41:57.439 align:start position:0%
asking for years specific data what are
 
03:41:59.510 --> 03:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
the actual costs of an adequate
 
03:42:01.670 --> 03:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
education and we always reference this
 
03:42:04.710 --> 03:42:04.720 align:start position:0%
do25 form which is loaded with all kinds
 
03:42:07.469 --> 03:42:07.479 align:start position:0%
of stuff internally and and when
 
03:42:08.950 --> 03:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
districts are dividing their enrollment
 
03:42:10.309 --> 03:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
into that and coming up here's the
 
03:42:11.990 --> 03:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
average cost well you might be dividing
 
03:42:14.269 --> 03:42:14.279 align:start position:0%
into the marching band which is not
 
03:42:14.279 --> 03:42:15.870 align:start position:0%
into the marching band which is not
inadequacy

03:42:15.870 --> 03:42:15.880 align:start position:0%
inadequacy
 
03:42:18.189 --> 03:42:18.199 align:start position:0%
requirement and I've been told over and
 
03:42:20.790 --> 03:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
over and I think this is occurring and I
 
03:42:24.070 --> 03:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
hope Mark you can say yay or nay that
 
03:42:26.110 --> 03:42:26.120 align:start position:0%
that Caitlyn's very much aware of that
 
03:42:28.030 --> 03:42:28.040 align:start position:0%
and we're working at trying to get a
 
03:42:31.229 --> 03:42:31.239 align:start position:0%
breakdown on how the adequacy items are
 
03:42:35.389 --> 03:42:35.399 align:start position:0%
related to that doe2 form and I know
 
03:42:37.870 --> 03:42:37.880 align:start position:0%
several years back we as a house put in
 
03:42:41.670 --> 03:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
monies for an an analyst to work with
 
03:42:45.229 --> 03:42:45.239 align:start position:0%
Nate over there $140 $160,000 that never
 
03:42:47.469 --> 03:42:47.479 align:start position:0%
made it and if you need staff to help
 
03:42:50.309 --> 03:42:50.319 align:start position:0%
out doing something let me know but I'm
 
03:42:52.269 --> 03:42:52.279 align:start position:0%
I'm real concerned that I want to go
 
03:42:54.630 --> 03:42:54.640 align:start position:0%
deeper than just this information about
 
03:42:56.149 --> 03:42:56.159 align:start position:0%
our instructional Personnel I want to
 
03:42:58.269 --> 03:42:58.279 align:start position:0%
know how dollars being
 
03:43:00.710 --> 03:43:00.720 align:start position:0%
used great could we take a two- minute
 
03:43:03.070 --> 03:43:03.080 align:start position:0%
recession so I can confir my colleague
 
03:43:05.590 --> 03:43:05.600 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah confir on that amend it yep
 
03:43:07.429 --> 03:43:07.439 align:start position:0%
that's we'll talk about okay good enough
 
03:43:10.030 --> 03:43:10.040 align:start position:0%
and we'll do the same thing okay um you
 
03:43:12.070 --> 03:43:12.080 align:start position:0%
can use one of the offices here and
 
03:43:14.189 --> 03:43:14.199 align:start position:0%
we're going to do the same thing we're
 
03:43:44.030 --> 03:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:44.040 --> 03:44:14.030 align:start position:0%
 
here

03:44:14.030 --> 03:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:14.040 --> 03:44:44.030 align:start position:0%

04:30:06.429 --> 04:30:06.439 align:start position:0%

04:30:14.790 --> 04:30:14.800 align:start position:0%
right um for whom is this pilot program
 
04:30:16.389 --> 04:30:16.399 align:start position:0%
going to
 
04:30:18.830 --> 04:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
serve to whom is going to receive these
 
04:30:22.710 --> 04:30:22.720 align:start position:0%
Grant monies um is it all people in HHS
 
04:30:24.870 --> 04:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
is it a select group
 
04:30:28.030 --> 04:30:28.040 align:start position:0%
within the receiving institutions
 
04:30:29.870 --> 04:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
whatever can you let me know sure
 
04:30:31.030 --> 04:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you for the question so
 
04:30:33.070 --> 04:30:33.080 align:start position:0%
I I draw your L your attention to the
 
04:30:37.070 --> 04:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
bill as amended uh line 25 which talks
 
04:30:39.189 --> 04:30:39.199 align:start position:0%
about the intent right the intent of
 
04:30:40.950 --> 04:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
this act is a proactively address
 
04:30:43.109 --> 04:30:43.119 align:start position:0%
vacancy rates FL situations experienced
 
04:30:45.790 --> 04:30:45.800 align:start position:0%
in census populations and Acuity care
 
04:30:48.710 --> 04:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
and Reliance of contracted staff at the
 
04:30:51.950 --> 04:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
current cunu Youth Services Center and
 
04:30:54.750 --> 04:30:54.760 align:start position:0%
at the secure treatment facility to repl
 
04:30:57.630 --> 04:30:57.640 align:start position:0%
uh to replace the um senu Center so
 
04:30:59.229 --> 04:30:59.239 align:start position:0%
again this is Hamad hospital it's
 
04:31:01.510 --> 04:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
dealing with staff there to act as a uh
 
04:31:03.510 --> 04:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
retention recruitment to keep people at
 
04:31:05.950 --> 04:31:05.960 align:start position:0%
those two youth youth facilities because
 
04:31:08.349 --> 04:31:08.359 align:start position:0%
we're struggling to have staff there so
 
04:31:10.269 --> 04:31:10.279 align:start position:0%
it's being used for those three two
 
04:31:13.630 --> 04:31:13.640 align:start position:0%
actually two two actually youth center
 
04:31:17.189 --> 04:31:17.199 align:start position:0%
and the Hamstead uh facility yep that's
 
04:31:19.030 --> 04:31:19.040 align:start position:0%
it so it's a retention program for those
 
04:31:22.510 --> 04:31:22.520 align:start position:0%
two youth programs um that retain staff
 
04:31:25.990 --> 04:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:28.349 --> 04:31:28.359 align:start position:0%
staff are there other
 
04:31:30.990 --> 04:31:31.000 align:start position:0%
questions uh does anyone know um the
 
04:31:32.950 --> 04:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
funding from this would that have to be
 
04:31:35.510 --> 04:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
approved by the fiscal Comm committee at
 
04:31:37.590 --> 04:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
this point that's correct it would be an
 
04:31:39.710 --> 04:31:39.720 align:start position:0%
off- budget request that would go in and
 
04:31:42.070 --> 04:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
they would have to uh request it up
 
04:31:42.080 --> 04:31:43.990 align:start position:0%
they would have to uh request it up
fiscal

04:31:43.990 --> 04:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
04:31:48.750 --> 04:31:48.760 align:start position:0%
right further questions yes represent
 
04:31:51.590 --> 04:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
Bon um I I didn't see on here what is
 
04:31:54.349 --> 04:31:54.359 align:start position:0%
the amount um that you're looking
 
04:31:56.349 --> 04:31:56.359 align:start position:0%
for you want second I'm going to have to
 
04:31:57.870 --> 04:31:57.880 align:start position:0%
go back to the original bill but I don't
 
04:31:59.750 --> 04:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
recall the amount I think if I remember
 
04:32:02.349 --> 04:32:02.359 align:start position:0%
right this was coming out of arpa funds
 
04:32:03.910 --> 04:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
um if I remember they were going to be
 
04:32:06.469 --> 04:32:06.479 align:start position:0%
dedicating some arpa funds what nope
 
04:32:08.349 --> 04:32:08.359 align:start position:0%
hold on we have AGS they they can answer
 
04:32:09.950 --> 04:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
the question how much it was I don't
 
04:32:15.950 --> 04:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:17.910 --> 04:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
welcome good afternoon members of the
 
04:32:19.189 --> 04:32:19.199 align:start position:0%
committee uh Nathan white Chief
 
04:32:20.389 --> 04:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
Financial Officer with the Department of
 
04:32:23.550 --> 04:32:23.560 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services um the purpose
 
04:32:25.870 --> 04:32:25.880 align:start position:0%
for this request is to continue the
 
04:32:27.950 --> 04:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and Retention program that
 
04:32:30.910 --> 04:32:30.920 align:start position:0%
currently exists today at syc um that
 
04:32:35.030 --> 04:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
statute is expiring uh June 30th 2023 um
 
04:32:36.950 --> 04:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
the provisions in this bill would
 
04:32:39.750 --> 04:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
continue that for a period of
 
04:32:42.429 --> 04:32:42.439 align:start position:0%
approximately 1.25 years
 
04:32:44.670 --> 04:32:44.680 align:start position:0%
um the purpose is that
 
04:32:48.149 --> 04:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
syc has uh struggled with vacancy rates
 
04:32:50.550 --> 04:32:50.560 align:start position:0%
relativ to the youth counselors we have
 
04:32:52.630 --> 04:32:52.640 align:start position:0%
had to pay out I'm projecting about $4
 
04:32:54.670 --> 04:32:54.680 align:start position:0%
million potentially in overtime this
 
04:32:58.070 --> 04:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
year as well as contracted staff there
 
04:33:00.030 --> 04:33:00.040 align:start position:0%
um they've offered a recruitment and
 
04:33:02.790 --> 04:33:02.800 align:start position:0%
retention program where if staff work
 
04:33:06.150 --> 04:33:06.160 align:start position:0%
three shifts in one twoe period um they
 
04:33:10.349 --> 04:33:10.359 align:start position:0%
receive a $300 um stipend um that has to
 
04:33:12.750 --> 04:33:12.760 align:start position:0%
date allowed us to avoid in recent
 
04:33:15.910 --> 04:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
months mandatory overtime uh which from
 
04:33:18.390 --> 04:33:18.400 align:start position:0%
a morale perspective is certainly not
 
04:33:21.789 --> 04:33:21.799 align:start position:0%
beneficial the funds for the syc portion
 
04:33:23.551 --> 04:33:23.561 align:start position:0%
um those are paid out of the existing
 
04:33:27.189 --> 04:33:27.199 align:start position:0%
syc budget um through vacancies or other
 
04:33:29.029 --> 04:33:29.039 align:start position:0%
transfers into that account which would
 
04:33:30.629 --> 04:33:30.639 align:start position:0%
be approved through the fiscal committee
 
04:33:32.670 --> 04:33:32.680 align:start position:0%
process and then for
 
04:33:35.990 --> 04:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
Hamstead the department recently went
 
04:33:39.269 --> 04:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
back out to bid um and we are entering
 
04:33:42.390 --> 04:33:42.400 align:start position:0%
into a contract with Dartmouth Health to
 
04:33:44.390 --> 04:33:44.400 align:start position:0%
take over the facility and there's a
 
04:33:46.910 --> 04:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
fairly substantial adjustment to how the
 
04:33:49.349 --> 04:33:49.359 align:start position:0%
operations are going to look we're well
 
04:33:52.470 --> 04:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
paath traditionally hired um
 
04:33:55.629 --> 04:33:55.639 align:start position:0%
approximately 170 staff in the state is
 
04:33:57.390 --> 04:33:57.400 align:start position:0%
has been engaging in a process to bring
 
04:34:00.869 --> 04:34:00.879 align:start position:0%
those staff on board and the department
 
04:34:03.910 --> 04:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
is in our intent is to ensure that we
 
04:34:05.510 --> 04:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
can continue to provide the Recruitment
 
04:34:08.070 --> 04:34:08.080 align:start position:0%
and Retention incentives that have
 
04:34:10.709 --> 04:34:10.719 align:start position:0%
existed to date to ensure that the that
 
04:34:13.629 --> 04:34:13.639 align:start position:0%
the facility um is not impacted in any
 
04:34:15.470 --> 04:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
sort of negative way and the the quality
 
04:34:19.109 --> 04:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:24.590 --> 04:34:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:27.470 --> 04:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
committee yes thank you Mr chairman and
 
04:34:29.510 --> 04:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
thank you um and so you're say I know
 
04:34:30.750 --> 04:34:30.760 align:start position:0%
that this had already gone through one
 
04:34:32.789 --> 04:34:32.799 align:start position:0%
another without this we wouldn't the
 
04:34:34.429 --> 04:34:34.439 align:start position:0%
state wouldn't have the flexibility that
 
04:34:36.670 --> 04:34:36.680 align:start position:0%
we need in order to keep the people have
 
04:34:40.390 --> 04:34:40.400 align:start position:0%
put on you know 10 15 17 19 years of
 
04:34:42.230 --> 04:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
service at Hamstead Hospital
 
04:34:43.949 --> 04:34:43.959 align:start position:0%
in order to make sure that we're able to
 
04:34:45.830 --> 04:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
keep them in the community providing for
 
04:34:49.470 --> 04:34:49.480 align:start position:0%
some of our most vulnerable kids um the
 
04:34:52.709 --> 04:34:52.719 align:start position:0%
provisions the hb1 1236 Provisions
 
04:34:54.910 --> 04:34:54.920 align:start position:0%
there's two Provisions in that this is
 
04:34:56.949 --> 04:34:56.959 align:start position:0%
one of them and then the second being
 
04:34:58.670 --> 04:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
the the language that you're referring
 
04:35:01.470 --> 04:35:01.480 align:start position:0%
to here that language is not included in
 
04:35:03.990 --> 04:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
1616 but the other language mirrors a
 
04:35:07.189 --> 04:35:07.199 align:start position:0%
recruitment retention but with without
 
04:35:09.510 --> 04:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
um that recruitment retention language
 
04:35:11.269 --> 04:35:11.279 align:start position:0%
um we would certainly be be concerned
 
04:35:13.551 --> 04:35:13.561 align:start position:0%
Rel relative to our ability to ensure
 
04:35:15.269 --> 04:35:15.279 align:start position:0%
that services are not diminished and we
 
04:35:18.629 --> 04:35:18.639 align:start position:0%
can um recruit and attract and retain
 
04:35:21.029 --> 04:35:21.039 align:start position:0%
staff appropriately thank you it's
 
04:35:21.039 --> 04:35:23.349 align:start position:0%
staff appropriately thank you it's
absolutely

04:35:23.349 --> 04:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
04:35:25.789 --> 04:35:25.799 align:start position:0%
vital any further questions from any of
 
04:35:28.189 --> 04:35:28.199 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
04:35:31.109 --> 04:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
members you need time nope if you're
 
04:35:32.429 --> 04:35:32.439 align:start position:0%
going toed to the Senate position I
 
04:35:34.551 --> 04:35:34.561 align:start position:0%
don't need any time we need time are we
 
04:35:44.629 --> 04:35:44.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:46.189 --> 04:35:46.199 align:start position:0%
I don't have an amendment there's no
 
04:35:47.709 --> 04:35:47.719 align:start position:0%
Amendment on it would be the Senate
 
04:35:51.150 --> 04:35:51.160 align:start position:0%
version that's on the side by side right
 
04:35:54.189 --> 04:35:54.199 align:start position:0%
now and
 
04:35:56.470 --> 04:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
I sign I have an issue with the
 
04:36:00.510 --> 04:36:00.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:04.189 --> 04:36:04.199 align:start position:0%
voting Mr chairman yes um it was my
 
04:36:05.990 --> 04:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
understanding that members of the the
 
04:36:07.789 --> 04:36:07.799 align:start position:0%
conference committee need to support the
 
04:36:10.390 --> 04:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
how the body's position so if there's a
 
04:36:12.189 --> 04:36:12.199 align:start position:0%
concern on the underlying understand how
 
04:36:13.551 --> 04:36:13.561 align:start position:0%
that works do you have a question
 
04:36:17.830 --> 04:36:17.840 align:start position:0%
regarding the bill though that is of
 
04:36:21.789 --> 04:36:21.799 align:start position:0%
concern um yes um of the original
 
04:36:24.429 --> 04:36:24.439 align:start position:0%
bill or of the
 
04:36:28.029 --> 04:36:28.039 align:start position:0%
amendment we're voting on the bill as
 
04:36:29.949 --> 04:36:29.959 align:start position:0%
amended it would
 
04:36:34.551 --> 04:36:34.561 align:start position:0%
be um so um my position on the original
 
04:36:39.429 --> 04:36:39.439 align:start position:0%
bill is that um I feel that uh parental
 
04:36:42.390 --> 04:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
consent is already provided and that
 
04:36:46.269 --> 04:36:46.279 align:start position:0%
this uh bill um will take away the
 
04:36:48.349 --> 04:36:48.359 align:start position:0%
flexibility that uh the federal
 
04:36:51.029 --> 04:36:51.039 align:start position:0%
government has already entitled school
 
04:36:53.510 --> 04:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
districts to have in terms of getting U
 
04:36:56.551 --> 04:36:56.561 align:start position:0%
Medicaid payments uh directly to the
 
04:36:59.709 --> 04:36:59.719 align:start position:0%
schools and that schools currently can
 
04:37:02.310 --> 04:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
be reimbursed for 50% of the eligible
 
04:37:05.230 --> 04:37:05.240 align:start position:0%
costs and without having that
 
04:37:08.789 --> 04:37:08.799 align:start position:0%
flexibility in the billing process uh it
 
04:37:10.310 --> 04:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
could actually be more of a burden on
 
04:37:12.230 --> 04:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
the local taxpayers in terms of getting
 
04:37:15.390 --> 04:37:15.400 align:start position:0%
that money reimbursed um and already
 
04:37:18.070 --> 04:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
within the system there are plenty of
 
04:37:20.230 --> 04:37:20.240 align:start position:0%
opportunities uh where the parent does
 
04:37:22.869 --> 04:37:22.879 align:start position:0%
have to sign consent the services cannot
 
04:37:25.990 --> 04:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
be given at all to the student until
 
04:37:28.709 --> 04:37:28.719 align:start position:0%
there is a parent parental consent form
 
04:37:31.510 --> 04:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
signed uh there is an original parental
 
04:37:34.830 --> 04:37:34.840 align:start position:0%
consent form to Bill Medicaid and it is
 
04:37:37.470 --> 04:37:37.480 align:start position:0%
uh reviewed annually and it can be
 
04:37:39.869 --> 04:37:39.879 align:start position:0%
withdrawn at any time so I feel that
 
04:37:41.670 --> 04:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
those Provisions are already taken care
 
04:37:45.269 --> 04:37:45.279 align:start position:0%
of and with that I will not be able to
 
04:37:45.279 --> 04:37:46.990 align:start position:0%
of and with that I will not be able to
support

04:37:46.990 --> 04:37:47.000 align:start position:0%
support
 
04:37:51.230 --> 04:37:51.240 align:start position:0%

representative just said but I have the
 
04:37:56.429 --> 04:37:56.439 align:start position:0%
same concern um particularly regarding
 
04:37:59.390 --> 04:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
lines 10 through 13 um so as long as
 
04:38:01.230 --> 04:38:01.240 align:start position:0%
that portion is still in the amended
 
04:38:03.590 --> 04:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
version um someone would have to replace
 
04:38:05.310 --> 04:38:05.320 align:start position:0%
me to sign off on the report I can't
 
04:38:13.590 --> 04:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:16.429 --> 04:38:16.439 align:start position:0%
any further
 
04:38:18.789 --> 04:38:18.799 align:start position:0%
comments okay is there a need to caucus
 
04:38:20.949 --> 04:38:20.959 align:start position:0%
on either
 
04:38:24.470 --> 04:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
side yeah so then the folks which are
 
04:38:27.230 --> 04:38:27.240 align:start position:0%
will be removed from the house side and
 
04:38:30.789 --> 04:38:30.799 align:start position:0%

Residence so I'd like to go ahead we
 
05:31:47.868 --> 05:31:47.878 align:start position:0%
have uh
 
05:31:50.750 --> 05:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
a a sheet which was passed out to us a
 
05:31:52.708 --> 05:31:52.718 align:start position:0%
side by side which shows the house
 
05:31:54.910 --> 05:31:54.920 align:start position:0%
version and the Senate version if we can
 
05:31:57.230 --> 05:31:57.240 align:start position:0%
let's try to work off of that uh so
 
05:32:00.270 --> 05:32:00.280 align:start position:0%
we're on the same page all of us so with
 
05:32:03.230 --> 05:32:03.240 align:start position:0%
that I will open up this conference for
 
05:32:06.110 --> 05:32:06.120 align:start position:0%
committee meeting for comments represent
 
05:32:06.120 --> 05:32:08.350 align:start position:0%
committee meeting for comments represent
cordelli

05:32:08.350 --> 05:32:08.360 align:start position:0%
cordelli
 
05:32:11.788 --> 05:32:11.798 align:start position:0%
thank you um I think that the house
 
05:32:16.670 --> 05:32:16.680 align:start position:0%
position is a strong uh position uh for
 
05:32:20.788 --> 05:32:20.798 align:start position:0%
a family income cap uh increased to 500%
 
05:32:23.510 --> 05:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
of federal poverty and I just like to
 
05:32:25.670 --> 05:32:25.680 align:start position:0%
read a couple of sentences from a recent
 
05:32:29.190 --> 05:32:29.200 align:start position:0%
article in the Josiah Bartlett um public
 
05:32:33.670 --> 05:32:33.680 align:start position:0%
policy um newsletter and part of it rain
 
05:32:36.190 --> 05:32:36.200 align:start position:0%
pertains to the recent uh Court ruling
 
05:32:39.788 --> 05:32:39.798 align:start position:0%
about um uh
 
05:32:41.750 --> 05:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination uh it says on
 
05:32:44.030 --> 05:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
Tuesday US District Court Judge Paul
 
05:32:48.910 --> 05:32:48.920 align:start position:0%
Barbaro ruled on constitutional 21 2021
 
05:32:50.990 --> 05:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
law legislators passed to prevent public
 
05:32:53.830 --> 05:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
schools from indoctrinating staff and
 
05:32:56.190 --> 05:32:56.200 align:start position:0%
students in ideological doctrines that
 
05:32:59.150 --> 05:32:59.160 align:start position:0%
classify groups of humans as Superior or
 
05:33:03.190 --> 05:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
inferior to others based on inherited
 
05:33:06.590 --> 05:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
characteristics um on the same day as
 
05:33:08.470 --> 05:33:08.480 align:start position:0%
that ruling
 
05:33:11.670 --> 05:33:11.680 align:start position:0%
um three of four Republican incumbents
 
05:33:16.030 --> 05:33:16.040 align:start position:0%
in the Texas house lost their runoff
 
05:33:19.868 --> 05:33:19.878 align:start position:0%
elections um they had been opponents of
 
05:33:23.350 --> 05:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
school choice in Texas last year so I
 
05:33:25.510 --> 05:33:25.520 align:start position:0%
think something like a total of
 
05:33:28.990 --> 05:33:29.000 align:start position:0%
14 anti-school Choice house members in
 
05:33:33.230 --> 05:33:33.240 align:start position:0%
Texas have been defeated um since uh
 
05:33:38.270 --> 05:33:38.280 align:start position:0%
last fall um then again on Thursday
 
05:33:41.310 --> 05:33:41.320 align:start position:0%
Louisiana passed a universal education
 
05:33:43.430 --> 05:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
savings account and I think that makes
 
05:33:48.070 --> 05:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
it the 12th state to adopt Universal
 
05:33:51.150 --> 05:33:51.160 align:start position:0%
esas and further from that article I
 
05:33:53.230 --> 05:33:53.240 align:start position:0%
point out that in New
 
05:33:57.750 --> 05:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire 66% of adults and
 
05:34:01.150 --> 05:34:01.160 align:start position:0%
74% of parents support
 
05:34:06.310 --> 05:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
esas so the article closes with this um
 
05:34:08.548 --> 05:34:08.558 align:start position:0%
judge Barbaro signal to parents this
 
05:34:10.868 --> 05:34:10.878 align:start position:0%
week that there is no recourse should
 
05:34:12.708 --> 05:34:12.718 align:start position:0%
the government use public schools to
 
05:34:15.670 --> 05:34:15.680 align:start position:0%
Advocate controversial doctrines
 
05:34:18.470 --> 05:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
Louisiana showed us that recourse would
 
05:34:22.030 --> 05:34:22.040 align:start position:0%
look like what it could look like Texas
 
05:34:24.510 --> 05:34:24.520 align:start position:0%
signal what happens when lawmakers
 
05:34:27.750 --> 05:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
failed to provide it so I think from
 
05:34:31.510 --> 05:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
around the country um Louisiana Texas
 
05:34:35.110 --> 05:34:35.120 align:start position:0%
Idaho uh where they had a host of uh
 
05:34:37.830 --> 05:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
anti-choice legislators uh defeated in
 
05:34:40.470 --> 05:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
the last election I think that we've
 
05:34:45.548 --> 05:34:45.558 align:start position:0%
seen um uh choice being a very strong
 
05:34:49.628 --> 05:34:49.638 align:start position:0%
position with uh parents uh and families
 
05:34:52.708 --> 05:34:52.718 align:start position:0%
and I think that um the house position
 
05:34:57.310 --> 05:34:57.320 align:start position:0%
of 500% of federal poverty uh is um a
 
05:35:00.390 --> 05:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
good position and uh is desired by the
 
05:35:02.628 --> 05:35:02.638 align:start position:0%
families of New Hampshire thank you are
 
05:35:05.910 --> 05:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
there further
 
05:35:08.310 --> 05:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
comments go ahead
 
05:35:10.230 --> 05:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
follow thank so the obviously the Senate
 
05:35:13.470 --> 05:35:13.480 align:start position:0%
position is 400% of poverty um the
 
05:35:17.070 --> 05:35:17.080 align:start position:0%
reason uh we're we're at that um is
 
05:35:19.750 --> 05:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
again the and the additions we made to
 
05:35:23.230 --> 05:35:23.240 align:start position:0%
the bill was 400% of poverty is equal to
 
05:35:25.750 --> 05:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh around 24
 
05:35:29.590 --> 05:35:29.600 align:start position:0%
$124,900 for a family of four which just
 
05:35:34.030 --> 05:35:34.040 align:start position:0%
happens to be um 400% of the FED federal
 
05:35:35.868 --> 05:35:35.878 align:start position:0%
poverty line so what it says is that
 
05:35:37.230 --> 05:35:37.240 align:start position:0%
again the median income for New
 
05:35:40.708 --> 05:35:40.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and Below would be subject to
 
05:35:44.070 --> 05:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
um all uh being available for Education
 
05:35:49.030 --> 05:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
trust fund dollars um we also agree that
 
05:35:51.548 --> 05:35:51.558 align:start position:0%
um Schools and
 
05:35:54.990 --> 05:35:55.000 align:start position:0%
Government doesn't turn on the dime um
 
05:35:57.548 --> 05:35:57.558 align:start position:0%
and that schools need time to adapt
 
05:35:59.548 --> 05:35:59.558 align:start position:0%
their budgets to any lost students that
 
05:36:01.708 --> 05:36:01.718 align:start position:0%
are in there and so because of that
 
05:36:05.190 --> 05:36:05.200 align:start position:0%
we've added um the uh phase the phase
 
05:36:07.788 --> 05:36:07.798 align:start position:0%
out grants uh into this to extend the
 
05:36:09.510 --> 05:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
phase out grants to allow school
 
05:36:12.110 --> 05:36:12.120 align:start position:0%
districts time to adapt to the red
 
05:36:12.120 --> 05:36:13.708 align:start position:0%
districts time to adapt to the red
reducing

05:36:13.708 --> 05:36:13.718 align:start position:0%
reducing
 
05:36:16.670 --> 05:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
um reducing populations acknowledging
 
05:36:19.070 --> 05:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
the fact that we we said even when we
 
05:36:21.390 --> 05:36:21.400 align:start position:0%
started phaseout grants that we were
 
05:36:24.830 --> 05:36:24.840 align:start position:0%
going to we recognized that issue and we
 
05:36:26.708 --> 05:36:26.718 align:start position:0%
um we created the phase out grants the
 
05:36:29.030 --> 05:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
reason we're extending this further is
 
05:36:30.670 --> 05:36:30.680 align:start position:0%
because again we acknowledge we're
 
05:36:33.788 --> 05:36:33.798 align:start position:0%
changing the conditions of efas and
 
05:36:35.990 --> 05:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
therefore and and making more students
 
05:36:38.590 --> 05:36:38.600 align:start position:0%
eligible for efas in doing that we need
 
05:36:41.270 --> 05:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
to allow again allow schools that time
 
05:36:43.990 --> 05:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
financially I don't see that as a um as
 
05:36:46.150 --> 05:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
an issue in spending and the reason
 
05:36:48.350 --> 05:36:48.360 align:start position:0%
being is that we currently pay phase out
 
05:36:51.230 --> 05:36:51.240 align:start position:0%
grants um the M vast majority and the
 
05:36:53.548 --> 05:36:53.558 align:start position:0%
last time we upgraded uh this in the
 
05:36:56.350 --> 05:36:56.360 align:start position:0%
300ish students took that and a portion
 
05:36:57.628 --> 05:36:57.638 align:start position:0%
of those students were public school
 
05:36:59.990 --> 05:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
students subject to phase out grants
 
05:37:01.590 --> 05:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
those students are coming on their third
 
05:37:03.110 --> 05:37:03.120 align:start position:0%
year and be dropping off phase out
 
05:37:04.708 --> 05:37:04.718 align:start position:0%
grants public we won't be spending that
 
05:37:06.110 --> 05:37:06.120 align:start position:0%
money at the state level for those
 
05:37:08.548 --> 05:37:08.558 align:start position:0%
students that no longer exist in schools
 
05:37:11.390 --> 05:37:11.400 align:start position:0%
but now we are changing the the the
 
05:37:14.070 --> 05:37:14.080 align:start position:0%
formula uh going to 400% there will be
 
05:37:15.310 --> 05:37:15.320 align:start position:0%
students we just want to be able to
 
05:37:16.990 --> 05:37:17.000 align:start position:0%
continue to provide the same safeguards
 
05:37:18.868 --> 05:37:18.878 align:start position:0%
we did for public schools in the
 
05:37:21.310 --> 05:37:21.320 align:start position:0%
original outline for these new students
 
05:37:23.150 --> 05:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
that are rolling in allow schools to
 
05:37:24.670 --> 05:37:24.680 align:start position:0%
have time because we know government
 
05:37:27.070 --> 05:37:27.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't turn on a dime um and they need
 
05:37:29.070 --> 05:37:29.080 align:start position:0%
time to adapt and adjust to the uh
 
05:37:30.910 --> 05:37:30.920 align:start position:0%
reducing enrollments for students that
 
05:37:35.708 --> 05:37:35.718 align:start position:0%
are eligible um so for and and and and
 
05:37:37.628 --> 05:37:37.638 align:start position:0%
paralleling that we added reporting
 
05:37:40.390 --> 05:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
mechanisms within this bill to make sure
 
05:37:42.110 --> 05:37:42.120 align:start position:0%
that we know where the money is going as
 
05:37:43.750 --> 05:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
it relates to those phase out grants
 
05:37:45.030 --> 05:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
what schools are getting them how much
 
05:37:46.990 --> 05:37:47.000 align:start position:0%
they're getting um what the costs of the
 
05:37:48.868 --> 05:37:48.878 align:start position:0%
districts are going to be so I I think
 
05:37:50.548 --> 05:37:50.558 align:start position:0%
again the Senate position is pretty
 
05:37:53.190 --> 05:37:53.200 align:start position:0%
straightforward I think uh it it governs
 
05:37:56.708 --> 05:37:56.718 align:start position:0%
of the uh again 50% our median income
 
05:37:59.030 --> 05:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
and Below um supports those families
 
05:38:00.628 --> 05:38:00.638 align:start position:0%
that need that money available to them
 
05:38:02.510 --> 05:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
and the choice so the Senate's going to
 
05:38:04.628 --> 05:38:04.638 align:start position:0%
support the
 
05:38:08.788 --> 05:38:08.798 align:start position:0%
100% okay uh further comments
 
05:38:10.910 --> 05:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
yes representative Cornell I I just
 
05:38:12.830 --> 05:38:12.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to point out that this is not a
 
05:38:15.310 --> 05:38:15.320 align:start position:0%
budget year and the fiscal note says
 
05:38:17.628 --> 05:38:17.638 align:start position:0%
that the that this cost would be
 
05:38:19.830 --> 05:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
indeterminable and that it could be
 
05:38:21.948 --> 05:38:21.958 align:start position:0%
approximately over $2
 
05:38:25.510 --> 05:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
million um and in a non-budget year I I
 
05:38:28.070 --> 05:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
don't think we should be
 
05:38:30.708 --> 05:38:30.718 align:start position:0%
um saying we're going to spend that
 
05:38:32.788 --> 05:38:32.798 align:start position:0%
possibly that much money um many other
 
05:38:34.590 --> 05:38:34.600 align:start position:0%
bills have come up that people have
 
05:38:37.150 --> 05:38:37.160 align:start position:0%
spoken against saying in a non-budget
 
05:38:39.430 --> 05:38:39.440 align:start position:0%
year we shouldn't be spending more funds
 
05:38:41.270 --> 05:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
and I agree with
 
05:38:43.708 --> 05:38:43.718 align:start position:0%
that further
 
05:38:46.628 --> 05:38:46.638 align:start position:0%
comments representa Bradley yeah let me
 
05:38:49.430 --> 05:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
just add that Senator Bradley yeah
 
05:38:51.788 --> 05:38:51.798 align:start position:0%
that's fine excuse me that's fine I
 
05:38:56.030 --> 05:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
answered to anything sepy being a Yankee
 
05:38:59.310 --> 05:38:59.320 align:start position:0%
fan um in terms of the last comment
 
05:39:01.788 --> 05:39:01.798 align:start position:0%
about spending money we've already spent
 
05:39:05.350 --> 05:39:05.360 align:start position:0%
$60 million for the YDC settlement in an
 
05:39:07.390 --> 05:39:07.400 align:start position:0%
off budget year it's on its way to the
 
05:39:10.030 --> 05:39:10.040 align:start position:0%
the governor we've already spent
 
05:39:13.390 --> 05:39:13.400 align:start position:0%
26.7 million for a group two retirement
 
05:39:15.150 --> 05:39:15.160 align:start position:0%
fix that's also on its way to the
 
05:39:19.030 --> 05:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
governor so um it happens I think we
 
05:39:21.788 --> 05:39:21.798 align:start position:0%
have to be somewhat cautious in seconde
 
05:39:23.868 --> 05:39:23.878 align:start position:0%
spending uh there are a lot of smaller
 
05:39:28.070 --> 05:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
bills I didn't bring that list but there
 
05:39:32.390 --> 05:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
we are generating some Surplus um we've
 
05:39:34.788 --> 05:39:34.798 align:start position:0%
utilized arpa money for some things for
 
05:39:38.670 --> 05:39:38.680 align:start position:0%
instance Hampton Harbor five 00,000 to
 
05:39:41.830 --> 05:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
start the dredging $2.5 million that
 
05:39:45.548 --> 05:39:45.558 align:start position:0%
actually you folks voted for for uh
 
05:39:47.910 --> 05:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
shelter in Manchester and some of the
 
05:39:49.868 --> 05:39:49.878 align:start position:0%
other shelters that's likely to be ARA
 
05:39:53.310 --> 05:39:53.320 align:start position:0%
money but it could be General funds so
 
05:39:57.030 --> 05:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
um anyway that's what we've done just
 
05:39:59.310 --> 05:39:59.320 align:start position:0%
this year
 
05:40:02.548 --> 05:40:02.558 align:start position:0%
alone Senator AER are you wanting to
 
05:40:06.310 --> 05:40:06.320 align:start position:0%
speak to got you read uh yes thank you
 
05:40:11.110 --> 05:40:11.120 align:start position:0%
um so as with regards to the seconde
 
05:40:14.468 --> 05:40:14.478 align:start position:0%
spending it's the Senate's position is
 
05:40:17.548 --> 05:40:17.558 align:start position:0%
400% of the poverty line is something
 
05:40:17.558 --> 05:40:19.070 align:start position:0%
400% of the poverty line is something
that

05:40:19.070 --> 05:40:19.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:40:21.270 --> 05:40:21.280 align:start position:0%
um we
 
05:40:24.310 --> 05:40:24.320 align:start position:0%
are not necessarily in the greatest
 
05:40:28.110 --> 05:40:28.120 align:start position:0%
position to absorb but are prepared to
 
05:40:30.430 --> 05:40:30.440 align:start position:0%
absorb and
 
05:40:33.948 --> 05:40:33.958 align:start position:0%
um perhaps you know there is some
 
05:40:37.670 --> 05:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
consideration from our colleague from
 
05:40:41.830 --> 05:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
Tuftonboro to factor in election year
 
05:40:44.468 --> 05:40:44.478 align:start position:0%
issues but that is that is not what is
 
05:40:47.230 --> 05:40:47.240 align:start position:0%
on the table right now um what we are
 
05:40:50.390 --> 05:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
talking about is keeping the 400% of
 
05:40:53.390 --> 05:40:53.400 align:start position:0%
federal poverty lines and and figuring
 
05:40:56.548 --> 05:40:56.558 align:start position:0%
out how we are going to um how we're
 
05:40:58.548 --> 05:40:58.558 align:start position:0%
going to pay for that in the first place
 
05:41:01.468 --> 05:41:01.478 align:start position:0%
and um what what is important that the
 
05:41:04.548 --> 05:41:04.558 align:start position:0%
Senate has put in its version is the new
 
05:41:06.430 --> 05:41:06.440 align:start position:0%
section that directs the Department of
 
05:41:08.670 --> 05:41:08.680 align:start position:0%
Education to submit a report so we have
 
05:41:12.750 --> 05:41:12.760 align:start position:0%
a little bit of an idea of how this um
 
05:41:16.190 --> 05:41:16.200 align:start position:0%
cost is being absorbed within the budget
 
05:41:19.948 --> 05:41:19.958 align:start position:0%
um we're we're we're not in a position
 
05:41:25.468 --> 05:41:25.478 align:start position:0%
to be throwing 500% poverty
 
05:41:28.430 --> 05:41:28.440 align:start position:0%
um okay into this bill at this point
 
05:41:30.270 --> 05:41:30.280 align:start position:0%
Thank you I'd like to chew into it a
 
05:41:31.990 --> 05:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
little bit more than Beyond just this
 
05:41:37.830 --> 05:41:37.840 align:start position:0%
400 500% uh issue uh on on page three
 
05:41:41.390 --> 05:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
it talks about a a a student who rece
 
05:41:45.390 --> 05:41:45.400 align:start position:0%
receives an EFA May attend grade 7
 
05:41:48.948 --> 05:41:48.958 align:start position:0%
through 12 and the school which they're
 
05:41:51.230 --> 05:41:51.240 align:start position:0%
attending would receive on behalf of
 
05:41:55.150 --> 05:41:55.160 align:start position:0%
that child or student a 0.15 pupil uh
 
05:41:59.990 --> 05:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
pupil teacher you know uh dollar sign so
 
05:42:04.070 --> 05:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
um that we do for homeschooling where
 
05:42:07.910 --> 05:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
they do not receive the the any kind of
 
05:42:09.910 --> 05:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
support financially for Education
 
05:42:12.590 --> 05:42:12.600 align:start position:0%
they're clear of at all so we do
 
05:42:14.868 --> 05:42:14.878 align:start position:0%
reimburse the high schools for that and
 
05:42:16.548 --> 05:42:16.558 align:start position:0%
it's now we've extended it to grade
 
05:42:19.510 --> 05:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
seventh and eight um is it appropriate
 
05:42:24.948 --> 05:42:24.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:27.990 --> 05:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
question I think representative lad the
 
05:42:30.830 --> 05:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
Senate thought it was a good idea um I
 
05:42:33.390 --> 05:42:33.400 align:start position:0%
think we are far more committed to
 
05:42:35.430 --> 05:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
making sure that we have the phase out
 
05:42:38.788 --> 05:42:38.798 align:start position:0%
grants um we thought
 
05:42:43.190 --> 05:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
that some EFA folks are potentially
 
05:42:45.310 --> 05:42:45.320 align:start position:0%
taking advantage of this and it would be
 
05:42:48.190 --> 05:42:48.200 align:start position:0%
a help to the school districts that's
 
05:42:52.510 --> 05:42:52.520 align:start position:0%
how we saw it that by giving that what
 
05:42:54.990 --> 05:42:55.000 align:start position:0%
would it be about $600
 
05:42:59.628 --> 05:42:59.638 align:start position:0%
$650 0.15% of adequacy would just
 
05:43:01.868 --> 05:43:01.878 align:start position:0%
similar to the phase out grants it would
 
05:43:04.110 --> 05:43:04.120 align:start position:0%
help the school districts if somebody
 
05:43:08.430 --> 05:43:08.440 align:start position:0%
took advantage of it so that's why
 
05:43:09.990 --> 05:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
is the Senate really attached to that
 
05:43:13.628 --> 05:43:13.638 align:start position:0%
item uh it's seen by some on the house
 
05:43:15.750 --> 05:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
side quite a few in fact even the
 
05:43:19.390 --> 05:43:19.400 align:start position:0%
members here in the committee that the
 
05:43:21.628 --> 05:43:21.638 align:start position:0%
dollars that they're going to receive
 
05:43:24.390 --> 05:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
are on top of the dollars the students
 
05:43:26.990 --> 05:43:27.000 align:start position:0%
receiving for the EFA the $5,200 or
 
05:43:29.868 --> 05:43:29.878 align:start position:0%
whatever it may be uh is that close or
 
05:43:32.990 --> 05:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
nearing double dipping so again you know
 
05:43:34.910 --> 05:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
we can talk about that we can go to a
 
05:43:36.868 --> 05:43:36.878 align:start position:0%
committee and and caucus and talk about
 
05:43:38.910 --> 05:43:38.920 align:start position:0%
that on the sense side but again the
 
05:43:42.030 --> 05:43:42.040 align:start position:0%
idea was was if you were to spend that
 
05:43:44.548 --> 05:43:44.558 align:start position:0%
money at the public school side that is
 
05:43:46.190 --> 05:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
that much more money available for the
 
05:43:47.910 --> 05:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
parents of an EFA to be able to provide
 
05:43:49.750 --> 05:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
education on the other five subjects
 
05:43:51.708 --> 05:43:51.718 align:start position:0%
that classroom subjects that a student
 
05:43:54.150 --> 05:43:54.160 align:start position:0%
would be eligible for um and potentially
 
05:43:56.110 --> 05:43:56.120 align:start position:0%
get better Education Services because
 
05:43:57.910 --> 05:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
they're not paying a tuition to the
 
05:44:00.750 --> 05:44:00.760 align:start position:0%
school instead um but we can talk about
 
05:44:02.430 --> 05:44:02.440 align:start position:0%
that on the Senate side and see where we
 
05:44:03.990 --> 05:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
think we want to go with that we were
 
05:44:07.190 --> 05:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
nodding to the school recognizing that
 
05:44:09.468 --> 05:44:09.478 align:start position:0%
knowledging that Nea course say high I'm
 
05:44:11.628 --> 05:44:11.638 align:start position:0%
going to use high school physics might
 
05:44:13.548 --> 05:44:13.558 align:start position:0%
be really tough for a parent to teach at
 
05:44:15.830 --> 05:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
home um and so they want to send their
 
05:44:17.868 --> 05:44:17.878 align:start position:0%
kid to the school the school needs to
 
05:44:19.750 --> 05:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
provide services for that classroom so
 
05:44:21.070 --> 05:44:21.080 align:start position:0%
it can either be done through a tuition
 
05:44:23.390 --> 05:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
or we can just have them qualify with an
 
05:44:27.150 --> 05:44:27.160 align:start position:0%
extra one 15% of a of a FTE position for
 
05:44:29.830 --> 05:44:29.840 align:start position:0%
a student um and have that uh money be
 
05:44:31.670 --> 05:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
reimbursed through the normal education
 
05:44:33.868 --> 05:44:33.878 align:start position:0%
trust fund we we were trying to support
 
05:44:35.510 --> 05:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
both the parents and the school but
 
05:44:37.190 --> 05:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
we'll be open to have a conversation
 
05:44:39.270 --> 05:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
about it and see how committed we are to
 
05:44:42.190 --> 05:44:42.200 align:start position:0%
it actually uh we thought you folks
 
05:44:44.270 --> 05:44:44.280 align:start position:0%
would like it right exactly right
 
05:44:46.390 --> 05:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
exactly right we had discussed it and we
 
05:44:48.230 --> 05:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
took it out because it's not for a
 
05:44:50.670 --> 05:44:50.680 align:start position:0%
course it's for each course they take
 
05:44:53.628 --> 05:44:53.638 align:start position:0%
yeah no I so it could compound I think
 
05:44:56.350 --> 05:44:56.360 align:start position:0%
that if we can come to resolution on
 
05:44:58.030 --> 05:44:58.040 align:start position:0%
some of the other pieces of the bill we
 
05:45:00.510 --> 05:45:00.520 align:start position:0%
can come to resolution on
 
05:45:04.628 --> 05:45:04.638 align:start position:0%
that represent cordelli yes um leading
 
05:45:07.030 --> 05:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
up to this meeting I talked to some of
 
05:45:09.350 --> 05:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
the other members of our education
 
05:45:11.868 --> 05:45:11.878 align:start position:0%
committee on on our side of the aisle
 
05:45:14.510 --> 05:45:14.520 align:start position:0%
and I think um well besides the uh
 
05:45:17.030 --> 05:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
family income cap I think the U main
 
05:45:20.708 --> 05:45:20.718 align:start position:0%
item of concern uh to them was the phase
 
05:45:21.868 --> 05:45:21.878 align:start position:0%
out grant
 
05:45:25.070 --> 05:45:25.080 align:start position:0%
extension um and I heard it
 
05:45:28.230 --> 05:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
expressed uh that um we shouldn't be
 
05:45:31.708 --> 05:45:31.718 align:start position:0%
paying for ghost students students who
 
05:45:34.990 --> 05:45:35.000 align:start position:0%
are no longer in in the public school um
 
05:45:38.070 --> 05:45:38.080 align:start position:0%
so I I think that that is sticking Point
 
05:45:42.750 --> 05:45:42.760 align:start position:0%
um a couple that I uh talked to um was
 
05:45:45.990 --> 05:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
you know willing to um
 
05:45:49.150 --> 05:45:49.160 align:start position:0%
negotiate or willing to bend a little on
 
05:45:52.990 --> 05:45:53.000 align:start position:0%
the um uh family income cap if there was
 
05:45:56.430 --> 05:45:56.440 align:start position:0%
to be a phase out Grant uh for instance
 
05:45:59.310 --> 05:45:59.320 align:start position:0%
um if it was 450 plus the phase out
 
05:46:01.948 --> 05:46:01.958 align:start position:0%
Grant um I I know a couple of them that
 
05:46:04.270 --> 05:46:04.280 align:start position:0%
I talked to would be willing to to go
 
05:46:08.150 --> 05:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
along um with that um but there were
 
05:46:11.948 --> 05:46:11.958 align:start position:0%
others who would um not be willing to go
 
05:46:13.868 --> 05:46:13.878 align:start position:0%
along with uh the
 
05:46:16.990 --> 05:46:17.000 align:start position:0%
400% plus the phase out grants the that
 
05:46:19.948 --> 05:46:19.958 align:start position:0%
was really a a sticking point um for a
 
05:46:21.270 --> 05:46:21.280 align:start position:0%
number of
 
05:46:23.948 --> 05:46:23.958 align:start position:0%
people so again we we'll talk about that
 
05:46:25.590 --> 05:46:25.600 align:start position:0%
um we'll bring it back into in a senate
 
05:46:27.230 --> 05:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
caucus but I just remind the house
 
05:46:29.390 --> 05:46:29.400 align:start position:0%
members that's exactly what you voted
 
05:46:31.990 --> 05:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
voted for when you created the um
 
05:46:34.270 --> 05:46:34.280 align:start position:0%
program was to allow a phase out to
 
05:46:36.468 --> 05:46:36.478 align:start position:0%
allow students as they move out and
 
05:46:38.310 --> 05:46:38.320 align:start position:0%
again I I think ultimately it's going to
 
05:46:40.150 --> 05:46:40.160 align:start position:0%
be a revenue neutral position because
 
05:46:41.990 --> 05:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
we're in our third year of efas which
 
05:46:44.070 --> 05:46:44.080 align:start position:0%
means those students who were eligible
 
05:46:45.990 --> 05:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
for the phase out grants in in our first
 
05:46:47.670 --> 05:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
iteration of this program are now
 
05:46:49.590 --> 05:46:49.600 align:start position:0%
phasing out and not spending any of that
 
05:46:52.070 --> 05:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
money um and so it's a it's a revenue
 
05:46:54.910 --> 05:46:54.920 align:start position:0%
neutral position as we change from 300
 
05:46:56.670 --> 05:46:56.680 align:start position:0%
to 350 now to
 
05:46:58.910 --> 05:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
400% um we're going to introduce new
 
05:47:01.548 --> 05:47:01.558 align:start position:0%
students into this mix and allowing for
 
05:47:03.150 --> 05:47:03.160 align:start position:0%
those same students to have the same
 
05:47:05.548 --> 05:47:05.558 align:start position:0%
eligibility as the first on 300% I think
 
05:47:07.510 --> 05:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
is pretty important to everybody
 
05:47:11.150 --> 05:47:11.160 align:start position:0%
but we'll take it back and consider it U
 
05:47:14.830 --> 05:47:14.840 align:start position:0%
speaking of um taking to caucus and
 
05:47:18.868 --> 05:47:18.878 align:start position:0%
compromising um I did uh prepare an
 
05:47:21.110 --> 05:47:21.120 align:start position:0%
amendment um that I think had the
 
05:47:24.430 --> 05:47:24.440 align:start position:0%
support of um number of Republicans on
 
05:47:28.868 --> 05:47:28.878 align:start position:0%
our committee um that would be for the
 
05:47:31.590 --> 05:47:31.600 align:start position:0%
400% but removing the phas out Grant it
 
05:47:32.788 --> 05:47:32.798 align:start position:0%
would be the
 
05:47:36.548 --> 05:47:36.558 align:start position:0%
400% plus the reduced administrative fee
 
05:47:37.548 --> 05:47:37.558 align:start position:0%
to to
 
05:47:41.788 --> 05:47:41.798 align:start position:0%
8% um but just those two components were
 
05:47:42.708 --> 05:47:42.718 align:start position:0%
in the
 
05:47:45.788 --> 05:47:45.798 align:start position:0%
amendment take a recess yeah we can
 
05:47:49.910 --> 05:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
recess but I would just say that um one
 
05:47:53.628 --> 05:47:53.638 align:start position:0%
of the things that a lot of senators
 
05:47:56.070 --> 05:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
have told me
 
05:48:00.468 --> 05:48:00.478 align:start position:0%
um that has really been precluded by the
 
05:48:03.628 --> 05:48:03.638 align:start position:0%
indefinite po postponement motion is
 
05:48:05.868 --> 05:48:05.878 align:start position:0%
income verification and I think for a
 
05:48:08.868 --> 05:48:08.878 align:start position:0%
number the Senators
 
05:48:12.548 --> 05:48:12.558 align:start position:0%
um as the income threshold goes up and
 
05:48:15.548 --> 05:48:15.558 align:start position:0%
we went from 300 to 350 where we're at
 
05:48:18.030 --> 05:48:18.040 align:start position:0%
now it becomes more and more important
 
05:48:21.548 --> 05:48:21.558 align:start position:0%
for income verification so we're forced
 
05:48:24.548 --> 05:48:24.558 align:start position:0%
to accept that is off the
 
05:48:28.310 --> 05:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
table um so that's why I think senators
 
05:48:33.830 --> 05:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
are like really kind of dug in on U Bas
 
05:48:33.840 --> 05:48:34.788 align:start position:0%
are like really kind of dug in on U Bas
out

05:48:34.788 --> 05:48:34.798 align:start position:0%
out
 
05:48:37.708 --> 05:48:37.718 align:start position:0%
grants it's too bad that they are dug in
 
05:48:40.948 --> 05:48:40.958 align:start position:0%
so entrenched um I can remember another
 
05:48:42.990 --> 05:48:43.000 align:start position:0%
type of program which we entrenched
 
05:48:45.948 --> 05:48:45.958 align:start position:0%
ourselves back in 2011
 
05:48:48.270 --> 05:48:48.280 align:start position:0%
stabilization it took us over 10 years
 
05:48:51.948 --> 05:48:51.958 align:start position:0%
to dump it uh and you know so it's hold
 
05:48:54.948 --> 05:48:54.958 align:start position:0%
harmless stabilization is supposed to be
 
05:48:59.030 --> 05:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
a step ratcheting down um I get it and I
 
05:49:00.948 --> 05:49:00.958 align:start position:0%
understand you're also Senator Bradley
 
05:49:03.430 --> 05:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
your your perspective and where you are
 
05:49:07.150 --> 05:49:07.160 align:start position:0%
so if we can work on trying to get into
 
05:49:09.910 --> 05:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
caucus here and and try to come back
 
05:49:12.868 --> 05:49:12.878 align:start position:0%
with some ideas it would be appreciated
 
05:49:15.230 --> 05:49:15.240 align:start position:0%
is is there any further dis your red
 
05:49:16.590 --> 05:49:16.600 align:start position:0%
lights on again
 
05:49:19.628 --> 05:49:19.638 align:start position:0%
there recommendation just go okay so
 
05:49:21.150 --> 05:49:21.160 align:start position:0%
we're going to go caucus right now we
 
05:49:22.948 --> 05:49:22.958 align:start position:0%
have two officers right outside where we
 
05:49:24.830 --> 05:49:24.840 align:start position:0%
can go Cox and just grab one and we'll
 
05:49:35.628 --> 05:49:35.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:35.638 --> 05:50:05.628 align:start position:0%
 
opposite

05:50:05.628 --> 05:50:05.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:05.638 --> 05:50:35.628 align:start position:0%

06:02:02.510 --> 06:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:03.670 --> 06:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
okay we're ready to go ahead and
 
06:02:05.990 --> 06:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
continue at 1665
 
06:02:09.230 --> 06:02:09.240 align:start position:0%
um I'll come back and I'll offer the the
 
06:02:11.270 --> 06:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
senate members uh where we
 
06:02:14.990 --> 06:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
are um if we're going to deal with the
 
06:02:17.190 --> 06:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
phase out we'd like to see a phase out
 
06:02:20.390 --> 06:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
for two years not three years and with
 
06:02:20.400 --> 06:02:21.430 align:start position:0%
for two years not three years and with
the

06:02:21.430 --> 06:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:02:24.868 --> 06:02:24.878 align:start position:0%
400% we'd like to see
 
06:02:29.990 --> 06:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
425 and the 0.15 taken
 
06:02:33.310 --> 06:02:33.320 align:start position:0%
out so Mr chair what the Senate's
 
06:02:36.230 --> 06:02:36.240 align:start position:0%
position would be is to leave section 1
 
06:02:40.350 --> 06:02:40.360 align:start position:0%
2 3 and four uh as they are written um
 
06:02:43.150 --> 06:02:43.160 align:start position:0%
and strike section five which is a 15%
 
06:02:45.948 --> 06:02:45.958 align:start position:0%
and reum six to five uh that would be
 
06:02:47.910 --> 06:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
the Senate position and you'd have yes
 
06:02:50.510 --> 06:02:50.520 align:start position:0%
votes right now on that I said if we
 
06:02:52.190 --> 06:02:52.200 align:start position:0%
want if you want anything else I think
 
06:02:55.310 --> 06:02:55.320 align:start position:0%
we would uh ask that we recess and
 
06:02:55.320 --> 06:02:56.548 align:start position:0%
we would uh ask that we recess and
reconvene

06:02:56.548 --> 06:02:56.558 align:start position:0%
reconvene
 
06:02:58.670 --> 06:02:58.680 align:start position:0%
tomorrow okay we're going to CAU us for
 
06:03:07.830 --> 06:03:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:11.110 --> 06:03:11.120 align:start position:0%
you just like Committees of conference
 
06:03:14.628 --> 06:03:14.638 align:start position:0%
I got his education in
 
06:03:34.708 --> 06:03:34.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:34.718 --> 06:04:04.708 align:start position:0%
 
off

06:04:04.708 --> 06:04:04.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:04.718 --> 06:04:34.628 align:start position:0%
 
e

06:04:34.628 --> 06:04:34.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:34.638 --> 06:05:04.628 align:start position:0%
 
e

06:05:04.628 --> 06:05:04.638 align:start position:0%

e

06:05:34.628 --> 06:05:34.638 align:start position:0%
