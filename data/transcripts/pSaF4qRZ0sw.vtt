00:34:58.150 --> 00:34:58.160 align:start position:0%
without any demonstrated need that this
 
00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:00.640 align:start position:0%
bill would extend the opportunity beyond
 
00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:03.040 align:start position:0%

procedures already in law are adequate
 
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
enough to address any concerns would i

their schools
 
00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
and if i know that this bill simply
 
00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
honors this right and requires
 
00:35:48.069 --> 00:35:48.079 align:start position:0%
curriculum materials to be made

all of the research on this issue
 
00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
supports those conclusions
 
00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:12.640 align:start position:0%
the committee heard comments during the

hearing on this bill that if students
 
00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
came to school hungry is the fault of
 
00:39:19.109 --> 00:39:19.119 align:start position:0%
the parents
 
00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
this perspective does not reflect the
 
00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
reality of some students lives some of
 
00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:25.760 align:start position:0%

family situations
 
00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
and it is not fair to blame the actions
 
00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
or in this case
 
00:39:35.109 --> 00:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
the inactions of parents on their
 
00:39:35.119 --> 00:39:37.030 align:start position:0%
the inactions of parents on their
children

00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
feeding our children should be one of
 
00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:41.200 align:start position:0%
the highest priorities of our schools in
 
00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
this case the 30 school districts that
 
00:39:45.109 --> 00:39:45.119 align:start position:0%
do not currently provide breakfast to
 
00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:46.640 align:start position:0%
their students
 
00:39:49.109 --> 00:39:49.119 align:start position:0%
and finally it's a sad commentary on our
 
00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
priorities when we need legislation in
 
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
order to feed children
 
00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
but that's where we are now
 
00:39:58.390 --> 00:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
00:40:00.069 --> 00:40:00.079 align:start position:0%
i recognize the representative hobson to
 
00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker in the education
 
00:40:08.829 --> 00:40:08.839 align:start position:0%
hearings we learned that of
 
00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
466 schools taking advantage of the
 
00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
school lunch program
 
00:40:15.349 --> 00:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
only 30 were not already providing
 
00:40:18.069 --> 00:40:18.079 align:start position:0%
breakfast if this if this measure were
 
00:40:20.069 --> 00:40:20.079 align:start position:0%
to pass schools would need to expand
 
00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
offerings to comply with the provisions
 
00:40:25.589 --> 00:40:25.599 align:start position:0%
of this bill likely increasing costs at
 
00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
an amount indeterminable
 
00:40:29.829 --> 00:40:29.839 align:start position:0%
some of the costs to the department of
 
00:40:31.589 --> 00:40:31.599 align:start position:0%
education are startup
 
00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
costs to start up the program and
 
00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
personnel to oversee and run the program
 
00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:38.560 align:start position:0%
these functions are currently not funded
 
00:40:40.309 --> 00:40:40.319 align:start position:0%
and as a result would violate the new
 
00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire constitution article 28a as an
 
00:40:46.309 --> 00:40:46.319 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate with only 30 schools in
 
00:40:48.309 --> 00:40:48.319 align:start position:0%
new hampshire not participating in the
 
00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
program it would seem to be a matter of
 
00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
choice over costs for these reasons i
 
00:40:56.069 --> 00:40:56.079 align:start position:0%
would request you support the itl motion
 
00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
the question before us is the itl motion
 
00:41:07.829 --> 00:41:07.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:10.309 --> 00:41:10.319 align:start position:0%
are you ready for the question
 
00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
a division has been requested members
 
00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
will take their seats this will be a
 
00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:04.710 align:start position:0%
 
clear

00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
the motion before us
 
00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:08.240 align:start position:0%
is the majority report of any speed to
 
00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:10.960 align:start position:0%
legislate on house bill 1564.
 
00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
this is a division vote the chair
 
00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative woodcock for
 
00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
if i know that new hampshire currently
 
00:42:29.589 --> 00:42:29.599 align:start position:0%
ranks 47th out of the 50 states
 
00:42:30.790 --> 00:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
in our nation's school lunch
 
00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:32.309 align:start position:0%
in our nation's school lunch
participation

00:42:32.309 --> 00:42:32.319 align:start position:0%
participation
 
00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
and each day new hampshire misses
 
00:42:36.190 --> 00:42:36.200 align:start position:0%
serving 7
 
00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:39.200 align:start position:0%
869 students school breakfast
 
00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
and annually leaves on the floor of the
 
00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
table 1.5 million dollars of food
 
00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
federal funding money
 
00:42:48.309 --> 00:42:48.319 align:start position:0%
and if i know research supports that
 
00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
student from food insecure and mildly
 
00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
secure households get more of their food
 
00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
nutrients from school middle school
 
00:42:58.710 --> 00:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
meals than any other student and if i
 
00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
know the research data that supports
 
00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:02.560 align:start position:0%
students who have more nutritious diets
 
00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
tend to perform better and pay more
 
00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:06.640 align:start position:0%
attention in school
 
00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
and finally if i know this bill was
 
00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
wisely sponsored and co-sponsored by
 
00:43:13.349 --> 00:43:13.359 align:start position:0%
several republican representatives then
 
00:43:15.430 --> 00:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
we should file their lead and vote no on
 
00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:18.400 align:start position:0%
the itl so a more food-filled option can
 
00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative ford for
 
00:43:30.150 --> 00:43:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:35.200 align:start position:0%
if i know that this bill changes school
 
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
requirements from providing students one
 
00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
meal a day
 
00:43:41.829 --> 00:43:41.839 align:start position:0%
to mandating that they provide both
 
00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
breakfast and lunch
 
00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
and if i know that this would apply only
 
00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:48.640 align:start position:0%
to the 30 districts that do not
 
00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
currently provide breakfast
 
00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
and if i know this is a 28a issue that
 
00:43:57.030 --> 00:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
will cost thousands of dollars for those
 
00:43:58.790 --> 00:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
30 districts
 
00:44:02.550 --> 00:44:02.560 align:start position:0%
would i now itl this unfunded mandate by
 
00:44:06.309 --> 00:44:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:08.480 align:start position:0%

prohibition against teaching
 
00:47:33.589 --> 00:47:33.599 align:start position:0%
discrimination in public workspaces is
 
00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
about censoring public employers and
 
00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
programs from sharing historical
 
00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:41.280 align:start position:0%

and if i know that our country was
 
00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:46.480 align:start position:0%
founded on the principle that speaking
 
00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
without fear of reprisal is essential
 
00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
and guaranteed
 
00:47:52.510 --> 00:47:52.520 align:start position:0%

00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
workplaces and education now if i also
 
00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:15.680 align:start position:0%

01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
targeted responses that guide them in
 
01:06:39.430 --> 01:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
knowing what individual communities need
 
01:06:41.910 --> 01:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
and to a person they talked about the
 
01:06:45.109 --> 01:06:45.119 align:start position:0%
potentially devastating impact of not
 
01:06:47.430 --> 01:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
being able to survey the minimum number
 
01:06:51.109 --> 01:06:51.119 align:start position:0%
of students required for the data to be
 
01:06:53.349 --> 01:06:53.359 align:start position:0%
considered representative
 
01:06:55.349 --> 01:06:55.359 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
01:06:57.109 --> 01:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
and unbiased
 
01:07:00.230 --> 01:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
their programs and services are at risk
 
01:07:02.950 --> 01:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
of elimination
 
01:07:05.270 --> 01:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
you may hear testimony today the kids
 
01:07:08.309 --> 01:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
don't take this survey seriously
 
01:07:11.670 --> 01:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
and that may be true for a few
 
01:07:13.589 --> 01:07:13.599 align:start position:0%
you may hear that the
 
01:07:16.470 --> 01:07:16.480 align:start position:0%
is considered a joke by some
 
01:07:19.109 --> 01:07:19.119 align:start position:0%
again possible
 
01:07:21.270 --> 01:07:21.280 align:start position:0%
but what about the kids that do take it
 
01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:23.029 align:start position:0%
but what about the kids that do take it
seriously

01:07:23.029 --> 01:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
seriously
 
01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
how many kids have we helped maybe even
 
01:07:29.910 --> 01:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
saved because we listened to them
 
01:07:32.950 --> 01:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
instruments like the yrbs have metrics
 
01:07:35.670 --> 01:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
built into them to account for the
 
01:07:39.750 --> 01:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
responses that are obviously untrue
 
01:07:42.470 --> 01:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
the outliers get tossed so that the
 
01:07:46.470 --> 01:07:46.480 align:start position:0%
results are reliable and not skewed
 
01:07:48.630 --> 01:07:48.640 align:start position:0%
there is nothing funny about drug and
 
01:07:51.670 --> 01:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
alcohol abuse or suicide
 
01:07:54.470 --> 01:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
there's no joke in sexual violence
 
01:07:56.789 --> 01:07:56.799 align:start position:0%
anxiety and depression or being the
 
01:07:59.430 --> 01:07:59.440 align:start position:0%
victim of bullying
 
01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
there are tough issues addressed in the
 
01:08:03.990 --> 01:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
youth risk behavior survey without a
 
01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
doubt because these are the real issues
 
01:08:08.829 --> 01:08:08.839 align:start position:0%
that are challenging our
 
01:08:12.549 --> 01:08:12.559 align:start position:0%
kids we heard testimony from experts in
 
01:08:15.029 --> 01:08:15.039 align:start position:0%
the field that when participation moves
 
01:08:17.829 --> 01:08:17.839 align:start position:0%
from opt-out to opt-in
 
01:08:21.030 --> 01:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
data and requirements are affected
 
01:08:24.950 --> 01:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
and programs are eliminated
 
01:08:26.950 --> 01:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
questions remain
 
01:08:30.149 --> 01:08:30.159 align:start position:0%
if not the tried and true yrbs how will
 
01:08:32.309 --> 01:08:32.319 align:start position:0%
we go about gathering the data to know
 
01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
what we should be doing
 
01:08:35.749 --> 01:08:35.759 align:start position:0%
do we guess
 
01:08:37.990 --> 01:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
are we going to be required to shift the
 
01:08:40.870 --> 01:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
expenses for current programs onto our
 
01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:42.550 align:start position:0%
expenses for current programs onto our
constituents

01:08:42.550 --> 01:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
01:08:44.789 --> 01:08:44.799 align:start position:0%
what kind of messages are we delivering
 
01:08:47.349 --> 01:08:47.359 align:start position:0%
to our youth when we silence their
 
01:08:50.470 --> 01:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
voices because the topics are too tough
 
01:08:52.709 --> 01:08:52.719 align:start position:0%
to talk about
 
01:08:55.030 --> 01:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
for these reasons i ask that you press
 
01:08:57.510 --> 01:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
the red button against the ought to pass
 
01:08:59.749 --> 01:08:59.759 align:start position:0%
as amended recommendation so that
 
01:09:02.630 --> 01:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
another motion may be made
 
01:09:03.990 --> 01:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:09:06.149 --> 01:09:06.159 align:start position:0%
we're down to the last speaker
 
01:09:07.829 --> 01:09:07.839 align:start position:0%
representative mullen has requested a
 
01:09:08.950 --> 01:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
roll call
 
01:09:11.189 --> 01:09:11.199 align:start position:0%
is that sufficiently seconded
 
01:09:13.590 --> 01:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
it is officially seconded this is going
 
01:09:16.309 --> 01:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
to be a roll call vote members take your
 
01:09:16.319 --> 01:09:21.829 align:start position:0%
to be a roll call vote members take your
seats

01:09:21.829 --> 01:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:28.149 --> 01:09:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:30.870 --> 01:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
01:09:32.709 --> 01:09:32.719 align:start position:0%
some years ago i introduced a bill to
 
01:09:35.510 --> 01:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
put a rein in on non-academic surveys
 
01:09:37.510 --> 01:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
parents had to be notified and questions
 
01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:39.030 align:start position:0%
parents had to be notified and questions
provided

01:09:39.030 --> 01:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
provided
 
01:09:41.349 --> 01:09:41.359 align:start position:0%
bill finally passed and is now law even
 
01:09:43.189 --> 01:09:43.199 align:start position:0%
though there have been multiple tries to
 
01:09:44.789 --> 01:09:44.799 align:start position:0%
change it
 
01:09:46.630 --> 01:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
everything was opt
 
01:09:50.149 --> 01:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
out except for the youth risk
 
01:09:52.870 --> 01:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
behavior survey
 
01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:54.550 align:start position:0%
behavior survey
however

01:09:54.550 --> 01:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:09:57.030 --> 01:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
this survey is taken as a joke by most
 
01:09:59.189 --> 01:09:59.199 align:start position:0%
high school students when i was on the
 
01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
school board this was given in our high
 
01:10:03.030 --> 01:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
school i heard from students that they
 
01:10:05.430 --> 01:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
were taking this as a class project to
 
01:10:08.070 --> 01:10:08.080 align:start position:0%
see how bad they can make it
 
01:10:11.189 --> 01:10:11.199 align:start position:0%
how many times do we get drunk
 
01:10:13.669 --> 01:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
do you take drugs and then they asked
 
01:10:15.590 --> 01:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
answered on how to do it
 
01:10:17.590 --> 01:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
some weeks later our principal came to
 
01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
our high school school board meeting
 
01:10:22.630 --> 01:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
with the disastrous results
 
01:10:24.709 --> 01:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
i then informed them how the survey was
 
01:10:24.719 --> 01:10:25.750 align:start position:0%
i then informed them how the survey was
taken

01:10:25.750 --> 01:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
taken
 
01:10:28.830 --> 01:10:28.840 align:start position:0%
our student school board member verified
 
01:10:31.990 --> 01:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
this other schools have the same issues
 
01:10:34.070 --> 01:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
when they know the survey is being taken
 
01:10:36.229 --> 01:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
social media goes rampant
 
01:10:37.910 --> 01:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
but entries on how to answer the
 
01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:38.950 align:start position:0%
but entries on how to answer the
questions

01:10:38.950 --> 01:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:10:41.590 --> 01:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
we had testimony with this as testimony
 
01:10:42.830 --> 01:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
at our
 
01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
hearing also parents need to know what
 
01:10:48.390 --> 01:10:48.400 align:start position:0%
their children are being asked
 
01:10:51.510 --> 01:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
parental rights all questions on any
 
01:10:53.830 --> 01:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
survey must be given to parents so they
 
01:10:55.590 --> 01:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
can make the decision to allow their
 
01:10:58.070 --> 01:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
children to take the survey over the
 
01:10:59.990 --> 01:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
years we've heard arguments that parents
 
01:11:02.070 --> 01:11:02.080 align:start position:0%
do not get the permission slip for the
 
01:11:05.590 --> 01:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
survey so they do not opt in interesting
 
01:11:07.910 --> 01:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
parents have to opt in for field trips
 
01:11:10.310 --> 01:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
they seem to be returned
 
01:11:12.229 --> 01:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
parents don't opt in because they do not
 
01:11:14.790 --> 01:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
want the child to take it and nowadays
 
01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
this is also being done electronically
 
01:11:19.830 --> 01:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
emails etc to parents so it's not hidden
 
01:11:21.830 --> 01:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
in the school bag
 
01:11:23.910 --> 01:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
some now some may testify that the
 
01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
survey and others are all academic it is
 
01:11:29.189 --> 01:11:29.199 align:start position:0%
a school's responsibility to teach not
 
01:11:30.950 --> 01:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
be social workers
 
01:11:33.350 --> 01:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
these only these surveys only interfere
 
01:11:35.669 --> 01:11:35.679 align:start position:0%
with the student learning activities for
 
01:11:38.470 --> 01:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
example in the cte committee that i'm on
 
01:11:40.229 --> 01:11:40.239 align:start position:0%
it came out that some career tech
 
01:11:42.550 --> 01:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
education students may miss their
 
01:11:44.950 --> 01:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
courses because the surveys be taken at
 
01:11:46.790 --> 01:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
their resident school
 
01:11:49.350 --> 01:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
and it's been proven time after time
 
01:11:52.149 --> 01:11:52.159 align:start position:0%
that no survey is anonymous
 
01:11:54.550 --> 01:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
the first seven questions on this survey
 
01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
one can easily determine who is
 
01:11:59.830 --> 01:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
answering the questions age grades grade
 
01:12:03.350 --> 01:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
sex race height weight etc
 
01:12:05.350 --> 01:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
then there are questions on using drugs
 
01:12:07.430 --> 01:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
anyone guess who will answer correctly
 
01:12:09.510 --> 01:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
if they are
 
01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
and questions on drugs drinking sex
 
01:12:15.990 --> 01:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
suicide can also serve as training aids
 
01:12:17.669 --> 01:12:17.679 align:start position:0%
we've seen this in the past with some
 
01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:19.679 align:start position:0%
drug programs and why they have been
 
01:12:19.679 --> 01:12:20.870 align:start position:0%
drug programs and why they have been
stopped

01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
stopped
 
01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
parents need to know again what
 
01:12:23.830 --> 01:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
questions are being asked for their
 
01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:25.430 align:start position:0%
questions are being asked for their
children

01:12:25.430 --> 01:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:12:27.270 --> 01:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
if their parents are specifically asked
 
01:12:29.510 --> 01:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
to opt in then they will take the
 
01:12:31.990 --> 01:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to check the questions and
 
01:12:33.830 --> 01:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
at what percentage point does it make
 
01:12:36.390 --> 01:12:36.400 align:start position:0%
the seri the survey immaterial
 
01:12:39.270 --> 01:12:39.280 align:start position:0%
if only some are answering correctly
 
01:12:41.669 --> 01:12:41.679 align:start position:0%
remember this survey is done by the cdc
 
01:12:43.590 --> 01:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
and depending on what administration is
 
01:12:46.870 --> 01:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
in power questions do become political
 
01:12:48.709 --> 01:12:48.719 align:start position:0%
in the past there are questions on guns
 
01:12:49.669 --> 01:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
at home
 
01:12:51.030 --> 01:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
now i bet this year there'll be
 
01:12:53.110 --> 01:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
questions and vaccinations
 
01:12:54.550 --> 01:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
another argument
 
01:12:56.470 --> 01:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
is that they need the entire school to
 
01:12:58.950 --> 01:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
take the survey to get the full results
 
01:12:59.990 --> 01:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
what's the
 
01:13:02.550 --> 01:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
difference students answering as a joke
 
01:13:04.390 --> 01:13:04.400 align:start position:0%
or not answering at all
 
01:13:06.709 --> 01:13:06.719 align:start position:0%
so please press the green button thank
 
01:13:06.719 --> 01:13:11.430 align:start position:0%
so please press the green button thank
you

01:13:11.430 --> 01:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:13.830 --> 01:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
the motion before us
 
01:13:15.669 --> 01:13:15.679 align:start position:0%
is the majority report of what to pass

thank you mr speaker
 
01:14:20.709 --> 01:14:20.719 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know that i have no idea
 
01:14:22.310 --> 01:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
how to counter the amount of
 
01:14:25.110 --> 01:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
misinformation you have just been given
 
01:14:29.510 --> 01:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:32.470 --> 01:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
and if i know that numerous stakeholders
 
01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
testified that they relied on the data
 
01:14:37.430 --> 01:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
collected by the youth behavior survey
 
01:14:40.390 --> 01:14:40.400 align:start position:0%

and more
 
01:14:47.270 --> 01:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
and if i know that surveys and tests
 
01:14:50.229 --> 01:14:50.239 align:start position:0%
have built-in metrics to account for the
 
01:14:53.189 --> 01:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
very small number of students that may
 
01:14:56.470 --> 01:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
not take it seriously and if i know that
 
01:14:58.790 --> 01:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
i was in a school when students were
 
01:15:01.910 --> 01:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
taking this risk survey and i don't know
 
01:15:04.229 --> 01:15:04.239 align:start position:0%
of very many at all that said oh i'm
 
01:15:06.390 --> 01:15:06.400 align:start position:0%
just going to make a joke out of this
 
01:15:08.950 --> 01:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
and if i know that after spending 36
 
01:15:10.550 --> 01:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
years in education
 
01:15:13.590 --> 01:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
that opt-in does not work
 
01:15:16.470 --> 01:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
even for a great field trip because kids
 
01:15:19.590 --> 01:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
are forgetful and if i know that i spent
 
01:15:22.390 --> 01:15:22.400 align:start position:0%
hours in the morning before a field trip
 
01:15:25.030 --> 01:15:25.040 align:start position:0%

01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:27.840 align:start position:0%

try
 
01:15:54.630 --> 01:15:54.640 align:start position:0%
and observe in this chamber that we do
 
01:15:56.470 --> 01:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
not try
 
01:15:58.070 --> 01:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
and put
 
01:16:00.790 --> 01:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
blame or suggest that somebody else has
 
01:16:03.110 --> 01:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
a bad motive or of anything of that
 
01:16:05.189 --> 01:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
nature so please
 
01:16:08.229 --> 01:16:08.239 align:start position:0%

01:16:22.790 --> 01:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
for what reason does a member rise
 
01:16:25.110 --> 01:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
for an inquiry of the chair
 
01:16:27.590 --> 01:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
you may inquire
 
01:16:31.350 --> 01:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
mr speaker isn't there a difference
 
01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:32.550 align:start position:0%
mr speaker isn't there a difference
between

01:16:32.550 --> 01:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:16:36.390 --> 01:16:36.400 align:start position:0%
maligning and questioning motive
 
01:16:38.550 --> 01:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
and what i heard
 
01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
which was a concern
 
01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:42.550 align:start position:0%
which was a concern
about

01:16:42.550 --> 01:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:46.630 align:start position:0%
about
facts

01:16:46.630 --> 01:16:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:50.149 --> 01:16:50.159 align:start position:0%
the member in my opinion suggested that
 
01:16:53.270 --> 01:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:54.950 align:start position:0%
 
now

01:16:54.950 --> 01:16:54.960 align:start position:0%

01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:00.550 align:start position:0%
am addressing both sides of the aisle
here

01:17:00.550 --> 01:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:17:03.110 --> 01:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
we've had it before we've had it
 
01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:04.390 align:start position:0%
we've had it before we've had it
yesterday

01:17:04.390 --> 01:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
01:17:07.110 --> 01:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
and it's already started today
 
01:17:09.910 --> 01:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
and i'm asking all the members
 
01:17:12.950 --> 01:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
to refrain from making any type of an
 
01:17:19.110 --> 01:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:22.070 --> 01:17:22.080 align:start position:0%

with it entirely
 
01:17:31.590 --> 01:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
my concern is that there is a difference
 
01:17:33.310 --> 01:17:33.320 align:start position:0%
between the word
 
01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:35.110 align:start position:0%
between the word

01:17:35.110 --> 01:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
misinformation
 
01:17:37.950 --> 01:17:37.960 align:start position:0%

01:17:40.709 --> 01:17:40.719 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker if i know
 
01:18:30.149 --> 01:18:30.159 align:start position:0%
that false information
 
01:18:33.030 --> 01:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
can lead to false results and we're
 
01:18:35.270 --> 01:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
based in
 
01:18:37.910 --> 01:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
and then we would be basing actions on
 
01:18:39.510 --> 01:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
false results
 
01:18:41.510 --> 01:18:41.520 align:start position:0%

01:18:54.470 --> 01:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
are so large and so complicated then

even if notification is given on the
 
01:19:00.310 --> 01:19:00.320 align:start position:0%

it was retained in committee for further

work
 
01:54:54.229 --> 01:54:54.239 align:start position:0%
but the senate rushed ahead anyway
 
01:54:57.030 --> 01:54:57.040 align:start position:0%

version of in hb2
 
01:55:03.750 --> 01:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
we have been told that bills attempting
 
01:55:06.229 --> 01:55:06.239 align:start position:0%
to fix this myriad of ills and we've
 
01:55:09.910 --> 01:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
heard many of them today this week
 
01:55:11.830 --> 01:55:11.840 align:start position:0%
are a cruel attempt
 
01:55:15.109 --> 01:55:15.119 align:start position:0%
at death by a thousand cuts
 
01:55:18.149 --> 01:55:18.159 align:start position:0%
and that those proposing such bills were
 
01:55:21.750 --> 01:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
members of the education establishment
 
01:55:23.990 --> 01:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
cared nothing for the poor
 
01:55:26.870 --> 01:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
or the harm done for children
 
01:55:30.229 --> 01:55:30.239 align:start position:0%
despite the fact that most of us
 
01:55:33.109 --> 01:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
have spent our entire working career
 
01:55:35.990 --> 01:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
it's 40 years for me
 
01:55:40.229 --> 01:55:40.239 align:start position:0%
i have working lives loving and teaching
 
01:55:40.239 --> 01:55:42.629 align:start position:0%
i have working lives loving and teaching
them

01:55:45.430 --> 01:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
so this is what we have
 
01:55:49.669 --> 01:55:49.679 align:start position:0%
a program that is wildly unpopular with
 
01:55:51.910 --> 01:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
the general public
 
01:55:55.669 --> 01:55:55.679 align:start position:0%
a program that lacks accountability
 
01:55:58.709 --> 01:55:58.719 align:start position:0%
administered by an out-of-state company
 
01:56:00.470 --> 01:56:00.480 align:start position:0%
which gets to decide
 
01:56:03.669 --> 01:56:03.679 align:start position:0%
who is approved who gets funded and what
 
01:56:07.270 --> 01:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
qualifies as an educational expense
 
01:56:09.830 --> 01:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
with lacks rules passed over the
 
01:56:12.310 --> 01:56:12.320 align:start position:0%
objections of the professionals
 
01:56:15.030 --> 01:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
responsible for advising us
 
01:56:17.270 --> 01:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
on rulemaking
 
01:56:19.750 --> 01:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
a program that allows organizations
 
01:56:22.870 --> 01:56:22.880 align:start position:0%
receiving public funds to discriminate
 
01:56:25.669 --> 01:56:25.679 align:start position:0%
against those they don't approve of
 
01:56:28.229 --> 01:56:28.239 align:start position:0%
a program that may leave students and
 
01:56:32.790 --> 01:56:32.800 align:start position:0%
taxpayers susceptible to fraud and abuse
 
01:56:35.750 --> 01:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
a program that could leave the state dry
 
01:56:38.470 --> 01:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
financially because there are no budget
 
01:56:38.480 --> 01:56:39.750 align:start position:0%
financially because there are no budget
caps

01:56:39.750 --> 01:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
caps
 
01:56:43.109 --> 01:56:43.119 align:start position:0%
no limits on how much can be spent
 
01:56:45.669 --> 01:56:45.679 align:start position:0%
in just the first few months
 
01:56:47.910 --> 01:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
it's already nearly nine million dollars
 
01:56:49.270 --> 01:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
over budget
 
01:56:51.109 --> 01:56:51.119 align:start position:0%
and growing
 
01:56:53.910 --> 01:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
the lba has warned us
 
01:56:56.629 --> 01:56:56.639 align:start position:0%
that if all eligible students not
 
01:56:59.270 --> 01:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
currently enrolled in public schools not
 
01:57:01.990 --> 01:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
enrolled in public schools
 
01:57:05.030 --> 01:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
took advantage of the program the cost
 
01:57:08.790 --> 01:57:08.800 align:start position:0%
to the state could be 70 million dollars
 
01:57:11.750 --> 01:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
a year i'm going to say that again these
 
01:57:13.189 --> 01:57:13.199 align:start position:0%
are for all the kids out there that are
 
01:57:15.430 --> 01:57:15.440 align:start position:0%
eligible for this program now
 
01:57:18.629 --> 01:57:18.639 align:start position:0%
if they all applied next year that's the
 
01:57:22.070 --> 01:57:22.080 align:start position:0%
figure lba is estimating
 
01:57:24.149 --> 01:57:24.159 align:start position:0%
todd and this is new spending this isn't
 
01:57:25.990 --> 01:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
much money we're spending on education
 
01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:26.870 align:start position:0%
much money we're spending on education
now

01:57:26.870 --> 01:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:57:29.030 --> 01:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
talk about a thousand cuts
 
01:57:31.430 --> 01:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
that's a hemorrhage
 
01:57:34.070 --> 01:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
we have tried to fix it
 
01:57:37.510 --> 01:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
you heard us try to fix it
 
01:57:40.149 --> 01:57:40.159 align:start position:0%
the only option available now is to
 
01:57:41.669 --> 01:57:41.679 align:start position:0%
repeal it
 
01:57:44.550 --> 01:57:44.560 align:start position:0%
please let common sense and your sense
 
01:57:47.270 --> 01:57:47.280 align:start position:0%

01:57:49.910 --> 01:57:49.920 align:start position:0%

01:57:54.149 --> 01:57:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:56.709 --> 01:57:56.719 align:start position:0%
representative luno has requested a roll
 
01:57:58.390 --> 01:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
call we're coming down to the final
 
01:58:00.629 --> 01:58:00.639 align:start position:0%
speaker is that sufficiently second it
 
01:58:02.709 --> 01:58:02.719 align:start position:0%
is sufficiently seconded this is going
 
01:58:04.629 --> 01:58:04.639 align:start position:0%
to be a roll call vote
 
01:58:06.550 --> 01:58:06.560 align:start position:0%
we're down to the final speaker so
 
01:58:08.310 --> 01:58:08.320 align:start position:0%
members take their seats
 
01:58:13.270 --> 01:58:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:15.589 --> 01:58:15.599 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
01:58:18.229 --> 01:58:18.239 align:start position:0%
the voucher plan is nothing less than an
 
01:58:20.629 --> 01:58:20.639 align:start position:0%
attempt to dismantle our public schools
 
01:58:23.910 --> 01:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
and replace them with private schools
 
01:58:25.910 --> 01:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
we've heard that argument about the new
 
01:58:28.550 --> 01:58:28.560 align:start position:0%
education freedom account program
 
01:58:32.470 --> 01:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
but we first heard it back in 2011
 
01:58:34.229 --> 01:58:34.239 align:start position:0%
with the debate about the tax credit
 
01:58:36.149 --> 01:58:36.159 align:start position:0%
scholarship program
 
01:58:40.390 --> 01:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
the same old proven false argument
 
01:58:40.400 --> 01:58:41.189 align:start position:0%
the same old proven false argument
and

01:58:41.189 --> 01:58:41.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:58:43.990 --> 01:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
since we're on the topic of education
 
01:58:47.589 --> 01:58:47.599 align:start position:0%
we don't have a voucher plan the state's
 
01:58:49.990 --> 01:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
are all have voucher plans
 
01:58:52.070 --> 01:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
opponents can't get that right maybe we
 
01:58:54.470 --> 01:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
need a lunch and learn program about uh
 
01:58:56.870 --> 01:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
education freedom
 
01:59:00.470 --> 01:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
and why are why are opponents so scared
 
01:59:03.030 --> 01:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
of the education freedom programs
 
01:59:06.149 --> 01:59:06.159 align:start position:0%
i remind am reminded of a quote
 
01:59:08.709 --> 01:59:08.719 align:start position:0%
competition is always a good thing
 
01:59:11.189 --> 01:59:11.199 align:start position:0%
it forces us to do our best
 
01:59:14.470 --> 01:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
a monopoly renders people complacent and
 
01:59:17.430 --> 01:59:17.440 align:start position:0%
satisfied with mediocrity
 
01:59:21.109 --> 01:59:21.119 align:start position:0%
in a 2019 analysis of studies of the
 
01:59:25.510 --> 01:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
impact on academics of choice programs
 
01:59:27.510 --> 01:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
on public schools
 
01:59:29.430 --> 01:59:29.440 align:start position:0%
24 studies
 
01:59:31.589 --> 01:59:31.599 align:start position:0%
showed a positive effect of school
 
01:59:34.229 --> 01:59:34.239 align:start position:0%
choice on the public schools
 
01:59:36.950 --> 01:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
one neutral and one negative
 
01:59:39.510 --> 01:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
so why are people scared
 
01:59:41.189 --> 01:59:41.199 align:start position:0%
over eighteen hundred students are
 
01:59:43.430 --> 01:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
enrolled in the program and remember
 
01:59:45.750 --> 01:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
these are low-income students due to a
 
01:59:48.149 --> 01:59:48.159 align:start position:0%
family income cap of 300 percent of
 
01:59:50.149 --> 01:59:50.159 align:start position:0%
federal poverty
 
01:59:52.950 --> 01:59:52.960 align:start position:0%
but hb 1683
 
01:59:55.510 --> 01:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
would repeal and throw those kids out of
 
01:59:56.870 --> 01:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
the program
 
01:59:58.470 --> 01:59:58.480 align:start position:0%
what about them
 
02:00:00.790 --> 02:00:00.800 align:start position:0%
are they just collateral damage yet
 
02:00:04.550 --> 02:00:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:06.790 --> 02:00:06.800 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about funding
 
02:00:09.430 --> 02:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
and point out this is the only
 
02:00:12.950 --> 02:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
program of its kind that has a phase out
 
02:00:15.669 --> 02:00:15.679 align:start position:0%
of funding for students leaving a public
 
02:00:15.679 --> 02:00:16.870 align:start position:0%
of funding for students leaving a public
school

02:00:16.870 --> 02:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:00:19.350 --> 02:00:19.360 align:start position:0%
the first year after they leave
 
02:00:21.910 --> 02:00:21.920 align:start position:0%
the school gets a hundred percent of
 
02:00:24.870 --> 02:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
state funding plus all local funding
 
02:00:26.470 --> 02:00:26.480 align:start position:0%
the second year
 
02:00:28.390 --> 02:00:28.400 align:start position:0%
they get 50 percent
 
02:00:31.109 --> 02:00:31.119 align:start position:0%
of state funding and all local funding
 
02:00:34.229 --> 02:00:34.239 align:start position:0%
and the third year they get 25 percent
 
02:00:37.350 --> 02:00:37.360 align:start position:0%
of state funding and local funding
 
02:00:39.350 --> 02:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
the year after that they get all local
 
02:00:43.109 --> 02:00:43.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:45.750 --> 02:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
the minority report says that it is the
 
02:00:48.470 --> 02:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
responsible thing to do
 
02:00:52.149 --> 02:00:52.159 align:start position:0%
to repeal this program responsible
 
02:00:55.510 --> 02:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
ask parents how responsible it is
 
02:00:56.950 --> 02:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
yes again
 
02:00:59.669 --> 02:00:59.679 align:start position:0%
opponents are scared scared because this
 
02:01:01.589 --> 02:01:01.599 align:start position:0%
program is successful
 
02:01:04.229 --> 02:01:04.239 align:start position:0%
yes more students selected efas than
 
02:01:04.239 --> 02:01:06.830 align:start position:0%
yes more students selected efas than
originally

02:01:06.830 --> 02:01:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:09.750 --> 02:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
estimated and why is that
 
02:01:12.070 --> 02:01:12.080 align:start position:0%
why is it above enrollment estimates
 
02:01:14.229 --> 02:01:14.239 align:start position:0%
well the pandemic opened a window into
 
02:01:16.550 --> 02:01:16.560 align:start position:0%
education and the parents have taken
 
02:01:19.669 --> 02:01:19.679 align:start position:0%
notice a parents are standing up against
 
02:01:21.350 --> 02:01:21.360 align:start position:0%
those who say they should not have a
 
02:01:23.589 --> 02:01:23.599 align:start position:0%
role in their children's education
 
02:01:25.910 --> 02:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
parents are standing up for education
 
02:01:25.920 --> 02:01:27.270 align:start position:0%
parents are standing up for education
options

02:01:27.270 --> 02:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
options
 
02:01:29.830 --> 02:01:29.840 align:start position:0%
parents are standing up and so should we
 
02:01:31.270 --> 02:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
and we will
 
02:01:33.430 --> 02:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
we will stand up for families and
 
02:01:36.070 --> 02:01:36.080 align:start position:0%
children we will stand up for education
 
02:01:38.310 --> 02:01:38.320 align:start position:0%
opportunities for new hampshire children
 
02:01:40.790 --> 02:01:40.800 align:start position:0%
we will stand against this repeal
 
02:01:43.830 --> 02:01:43.840 align:start position:0%
we will out itl this outrageous attempt
 
02:01:46.550 --> 02:01:46.560 align:start position:0%
to destroy this program if children are
 
02:01:49.270 --> 02:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
our future we must must provide them
 
02:01:51.109 --> 02:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
with educational opportunities to be
 
02:01:51.119 --> 02:01:52.790 align:start position:0%
with educational opportunities to be
successful

02:01:52.790 --> 02:01:52.800 align:start position:0%
successful
 
02:01:55.109 --> 02:01:55.119 align:start position:0%
we will not fail these students and we
 
02:01:59.430 --> 02:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:06.149 --> 02:02:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:10.709 --> 02:02:10.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:30.310 --> 02:02:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:30.320 --> 02:02:43.589 align:start position:0%
 
this

02:02:43.589 --> 02:02:43.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:45.830 --> 02:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is a majority
 
02:02:47.669 --> 02:02:47.679 align:start position:0%
report of inexpedia to legislate on
 
02:02:50.950 --> 02:02:50.960 align:start position:0%
house bill 1683 this is a roll call vote
 
02:02:52.629 --> 02:02:52.639 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative luno for
 
02:03:00.149 --> 02:03:00.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:02.550 --> 02:03:02.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr speaker
 
02:03:05.750 --> 02:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
if i know new hampshire's 160 000 public
 
02:03:07.910 --> 02:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
school kids perform among the best in
 
02:03:10.950 --> 02:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
the country and that's what parents want
 
02:03:12.629 --> 02:03:12.639 align:start position:0%
and if i know the state's voucher
 
02:03:12.639 --> 02:03:13.669 align:start position:0%
and if i know the state's voucher
program

02:03:13.669 --> 02:03:13.679 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:03:15.990 --> 02:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
is the most expansive
 
02:03:18.390 --> 02:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
voucher program in the country and is
 
02:03:20.310 --> 02:03:20.320 align:start position:0%
riddled with flaws
 
02:03:21.910 --> 02:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
and if i know
 
02:03:23.750 --> 02:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
that the voucher program
 
02:03:26.470 --> 02:03:26.480 align:start position:0%
is clearly not as successful as some
 
02:03:28.390 --> 02:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
proponents may suggest
 
02:03:30.790 --> 02:03:30.800 align:start position:0%
given that the vast majority of the
 
02:03:32.790 --> 02:03:32.800 align:start position:0%
voucher students
 
02:03:36.709 --> 02:03:36.719 align:start position:0%
maybe around 200 um i'm sorry vast
 
02:03:39.109 --> 02:03:39.119 align:start position:0%
majority of students maybe maybe around
 
02:03:41.750 --> 02:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
1600 were already
 
02:03:44.070 --> 02:03:44.080 align:start position:0%
attending private schools
 
02:03:46.229 --> 02:03:46.239 align:start position:0%
and homeschooling situations
 
02:03:48.870 --> 02:03:48.880 align:start position:0%
and if i know that this bill is the only
 
02:03:50.310 --> 02:03:50.320 align:start position:0%
option left
 
02:03:52.390 --> 02:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
since every other bill to improve the
 
02:03:54.830 --> 02:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
financial responsibility
 
02:03:57.750 --> 02:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
accountability and to prevent fraud has
 
02:03:59.430 --> 02:03:59.440 align:start position:0%
been defeated
 
02:04:01.589 --> 02:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
and if i know this bill will repeal a
 
02:04:04.310 --> 02:04:04.320 align:start position:0%
program that steals from taxpayers and
 
02:04:06.709 --> 02:04:06.719 align:start position:0%
is ripe for fraud and misuse
 
02:04:08.629 --> 02:04:08.639 align:start position:0%
then would i press the red button to
 
02:04:10.870 --> 02:04:10.880 align:start position:0%
overturn the itil motion so another
 
02:04:15.510 --> 02:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:17.270 --> 02:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
i recognize representative osborne for
 
02:04:20.390 --> 02:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:22.790 --> 02:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
02:04:25.589 --> 02:04:25.599 align:start position:0%
so if i believe that
 
02:04:27.990 --> 02:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
every child is entitled to an adequate
 
02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:29.189 align:start position:0%
every child is entitled to an adequate
education

02:04:29.189 --> 02:04:29.199 align:start position:0%
education
 
02:04:31.910 --> 02:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
but i know that a one-size-fits-all
 
02:04:35.030 --> 02:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
program system cannot possibly provide
 
02:04:37.430 --> 02:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
it to every child
 
02:04:39.510 --> 02:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
and i know that this legislation before
 
02:04:39.520 --> 02:04:40.790 align:start position:0%
and i know that this legislation before
us

02:04:40.790 --> 02:04:40.800 align:start position:0%
us
 
02:04:43.990 --> 02:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
would tear almost 2 000 children away
 
02:04:46.470 --> 02:04:46.480 align:start position:0%
from their chosen environment and return
 
02:04:49.030 --> 02:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
them to the inadequate educational
 
02:04:51.030 --> 02:04:51.040 align:start position:0%
environment from once they came
 
02:04:53.510 --> 02:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
would i now press the green button
 
02:04:56.950 --> 02:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:03.669 --> 02:05:03.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:05.830 --> 02:05:05.840 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the majority
 
02:05:08.069 --> 02:05:08.079 align:start position:0%
report of in expediting to legislate on
 
02:05:11.589 --> 02:05:11.599 align:start position:0%
house bill 1683 this is a roll call vote

02:17:18.870 --> 02:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
first it completely guts and replaces
 
02:17:20.309 --> 02:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
02:17:22.469 --> 02:17:22.479 align:start position:0%
secondly i believe that the underlying
 
02:17:25.030 --> 02:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
bill would actually pass with by with a
 
02:17:27.030 --> 02:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
bipartisan majority as the underlying
 
02:17:29.270 --> 02:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
bill was actually sponsored
 
02:17:31.509 --> 02:17:31.519 align:start position:0%
by the majority whip and the member from
 
02:17:33.270 --> 02:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
londonderry who currently serves as the
 
02:17:34.870 --> 02:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
chair of state and federal relations and
 
02:17:38.150 --> 02:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
veterans affairs back in 2015.
 
02:17:40.790 --> 02:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
it was also sponsored by the members
 
02:17:43.190 --> 02:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
by other members back in 2019 most
 
02:17:45.030 --> 02:17:45.040 align:start position:0%
notably the member from goffstown who
 
02:17:46.389 --> 02:17:46.399 align:start position:0%
currently serves as the chair of the new
 
02:17:48.230 --> 02:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire young republicans
 
02:17:50.389 --> 02:17:50.399 align:start position:0%
the underlying cacr is also supported by
 
02:17:51.910 --> 02:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire legislative youth
 
02:17:53.830 --> 02:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
advisory council while the amendment is
 
02:17:55.429 --> 02:17:55.439 align:start position:0%
opposed by the council
 
02:17:57.190 --> 02:17:57.200 align:start position:0%
that is why i ask all of you to vote
 
02:17:58.629 --> 02:17:58.639 align:start position:0%
down this amendment so that we can
 
02:18:00.230 --> 02:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
debate the substance of the underlying
 
02:18:02.150 --> 02:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment and pass it
 
02:18:07.030 --> 02:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:08.709 --> 02:18:08.719 align:start position:0%
geo recognizer representative barbara
 
02:18:08.719 --> 02:18:11.830 align:start position:0%
geo recognizer representative barbara
griffin

02:18:11.830 --> 02:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:17.110 --> 02:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:19.030 --> 02:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
and thank you to the representative for
 
02:18:21.190 --> 02:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
bringing the issue before the body
 
02:18:24.070 --> 02:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
because it is always
 
02:18:26.389 --> 02:18:26.399 align:start position:0%
great to learn something new about
 
02:18:28.469 --> 02:18:28.479 align:start position:0%
processes in the house
 
02:18:31.429 --> 02:18:31.439 align:start position:0%
because once a bill goes to a committee
 
02:18:33.509 --> 02:18:33.519 align:start position:0%
it is the committees
 
02:18:35.190 --> 02:18:35.200 align:start position:0%
and we know that in all of our
 
02:18:37.110 --> 02:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
committees that we
 
02:18:40.230 --> 02:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
as committee members then control
 
02:18:43.910 --> 02:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
what goes forward in a bill
 
02:18:45.750 --> 02:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
whether it is related to the original
 
02:18:45.760 --> 02:18:46.950 align:start position:0%
whether it is related to the original
subject

02:18:46.950 --> 02:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
subject
 
02:18:48.230 --> 02:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
or not
 
02:18:50.309 --> 02:18:50.319 align:start position:0%
after a hearing on what amendments might
 
02:18:52.230 --> 02:18:52.240 align:start position:0%
be non-germane
 
02:18:55.270 --> 02:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
and that is indeed as you just heard
 
02:18:58.870 --> 02:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
what happened in this amendment
 
02:19:01.830 --> 02:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
this representative from goffstown
 
02:19:03.669 --> 02:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
didn't think that the underlying bill
 
02:19:05.669 --> 02:19:05.679 align:start position:0%
had much chance of success before the
 
02:19:05.679 --> 02:19:07.270 align:start position:0%
had much chance of success before the
house

02:19:07.270 --> 02:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
house
 
02:19:10.469 --> 02:19:10.479 align:start position:0%
and this representative from goffstown
 
02:19:12.709 --> 02:19:12.719 align:start position:0%
often disagrees with other
 
02:19:14.629 --> 02:19:14.639 align:start position:0%
representatives from goffstown and that
 
02:19:17.270 --> 02:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
is the point of this debate
 
02:19:18.709 --> 02:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
of this hall
 
02:19:21.990 --> 02:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:23.830 --> 02:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
so the amendment that's brought before
 
02:19:23.840 --> 02:19:24.790 align:start position:0%
so the amendment that's brought before
you

02:19:24.790 --> 02:19:24.800 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:19:26.709 --> 02:19:26.719 align:start position:0%
is to raise an issue for your
 
02:19:30.230 --> 02:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
consideration indeed about elections
 
02:19:31.669 --> 02:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
about voting
 
02:19:34.469 --> 02:19:34.479 align:start position:0%
and who should be voting in them
 
02:19:36.150 --> 02:19:36.160 align:start position:0%
i actually disagreed that it was
 
02:19:36.160 --> 02:19:37.910 align:start position:0%
i actually disagreed that it was
non-germane

02:19:37.910 --> 02:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
non-germane
 
02:19:40.389 --> 02:19:40.399 align:start position:0%
but we followed the process and that is
 
02:19:43.030 --> 02:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
the bill that is before you today
 
02:19:45.750 --> 02:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
and i ask that you support the amendment
 
02:19:47.990 --> 02:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
so that we can have a debate on the
 
02:19:50.790 --> 02:19:50.800 align:start position:0%
underlying issue that is before you now
 
02:19:53.270 --> 02:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
by the majority vote of the committee
 
02:19:56.710 --> 02:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:58.630 --> 02:19:58.640 align:start position:0%
the motion before us
 
02:20:01.429 --> 02:20:01.439 align:start position:0%
is the committee amendment
 
02:20:04.389 --> 02:20:04.399 align:start position:0%

are you ready for the question
 
02:20:06.960 --> 02:20:07.990 align:start position:0%
are you ready for the question
although

02:20:07.990 --> 02:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
although
 
02:20:10.950 --> 02:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
a division has been requested
 
02:20:28.389 --> 02:20:28.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:38.950 --> 02:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:40.950 --> 02:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
who's requesting a roll call
 
02:20:42.950 --> 02:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
senator barry requests the roll calls
 
02:20:44.790 --> 02:20:44.800 align:start position:0%
officially it is sufficiently seconded
 
02:21:24.790 --> 02:21:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:24.800 --> 02:21:30.070 align:start position:0%
 
we're

02:21:30.070 --> 02:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:32.950 --> 02:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the
 
02:21:35.630 --> 02:21:35.640 align:start position:0%

02:21:35.640 --> 02:21:37.190 align:start position:0%

02:21:41.110 --> 02:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
this is the vote on the amendment
 
02:21:43.030 --> 02:21:43.040 align:start position:0%

02:22:51.349 --> 02:22:51.359 align:start position:0%
the motion before us now was ought to
 
02:22:53.670 --> 02:22:53.680 align:start position:0%
pass as amended chair recognizes
 
02:22:58.469 --> 02:22:58.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:11.190 --> 02:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:13.110 --> 02:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
02:23:15.670 --> 02:23:15.680 align:start position:0%
the majority stated purpose in the
 
02:23:18.469 --> 02:23:18.479 align:start position:0%
committee of this see this amendment
 
02:23:20.710 --> 02:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
as amended the cacr
 
02:23:22.710 --> 02:23:22.720 align:start position:0%
is to place the current statutory
 
02:23:24.870 --> 02:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
definitions of resident
 
02:23:27.270 --> 02:23:27.280 align:start position:0%
residency and domicile into the
 
02:23:29.830 --> 02:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
constitution so that it will be harder
 
02:23:32.389 --> 02:23:32.399 align:start position:0%
to change them in the future the
 
02:23:35.349 --> 02:23:35.359 align:start position:0%
minority feels that the cacr is
 
02:23:35.359 --> 02:23:37.590 align:start position:0%
minority feels that the cacr is
unnecessarily

02:23:37.590 --> 02:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily
 
02:23:40.070 --> 02:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
precisely because these definitions are
 
02:23:42.389 --> 02:23:42.399 align:start position:0%
already in the statutes
 
02:23:44.950 --> 02:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
but more importantly if we are going to
 
02:23:47.830 --> 02:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
amend and put these
 
02:23:50.230 --> 02:23:50.240 align:start position:0%
definitions into the constitution then
 
02:23:52.070 --> 02:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
let's do it right
 
02:23:53.590 --> 02:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
the language should be drafted
 
02:23:56.230 --> 02:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
thoughtfully and carefully
 
02:23:59.190 --> 02:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
so it's not to create more confusion
 
02:24:01.750 --> 02:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
about an issue that this body has argued
 
02:24:03.510 --> 02:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
about for years
 
02:24:05.349 --> 02:24:05.359 align:start position:0%
and in court
 
02:24:07.349 --> 02:24:07.359 align:start position:0%
if passed there will be five
 
02:24:07.359 --> 02:24:08.870 align:start position:0%
if passed there will be five
qualifications

02:24:08.870 --> 02:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
qualifications
 
02:24:11.270 --> 02:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
to vote in new hampshire
 
02:24:13.270 --> 02:24:13.280 align:start position:0%
you must be a citizen of the united
 
02:24:13.280 --> 02:24:14.630 align:start position:0%
you must be a citizen of the united
states

02:24:14.630 --> 02:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
states
 
02:24:17.830 --> 02:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
you must be a citizen of new hampshire
 
02:24:20.790 --> 02:24:20.800 align:start position:0%
you must be domiciled in new hampshire
 
02:24:23.349 --> 02:24:23.359 align:start position:0%
new hampshire must be your primary
 
02:24:23.359 --> 02:24:24.550 align:start position:0%
new hampshire must be your primary
residency

02:24:24.550 --> 02:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
residency
 
02:24:26.790 --> 02:24:26.800 align:start position:0%
and you can only vote where you are
 
02:24:26.800 --> 02:24:28.630 align:start position:0%
and you can only vote where you are
domiciled

02:24:28.630 --> 02:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
domiciled
 
02:24:30.389 --> 02:24:30.399 align:start position:0%
so let's look at the second and the
 
02:24:32.070 --> 02:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
fourth requirements
 
02:24:35.110 --> 02:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
both of which introduce undefined terms
 
02:24:37.590 --> 02:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
into the qualifications to vote in new
 
02:24:37.600 --> 02:24:39.190 align:start position:0%
into the qualifications to vote in new
hampshire

02:24:39.190 --> 02:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:24:42.469 --> 02:24:42.479 align:start position:0%
nowhere are the terms primary residency
 
02:24:45.830 --> 02:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
or citizen of new hampshire defined not
 
02:24:47.590 --> 02:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
in the cacr
 
02:24:49.670 --> 02:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
and not in the statutes
 
02:24:52.870 --> 02:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
the term primary residency implies that
 
02:24:55.429 --> 02:24:55.439 align:start position:0%
there might be a secondary residency or
 
02:24:58.150 --> 02:24:58.160 align:start position:0%
other types of residency
 
02:24:59.990 --> 02:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
and what does it mean to be a citizen of
 
02:25:01.349 --> 02:25:01.359 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
02:25:03.190 --> 02:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
how is it different from being a citizen
 
02:25:05.030 --> 02:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
of the united states
 
02:25:06.790 --> 02:25:06.800 align:start position:0%
must you be a citizen of the united
 
02:25:09.750 --> 02:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
states to be a citizen of new hampshire
 
02:25:11.750 --> 02:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
is new hampshire going to start issuing
 
02:25:14.630 --> 02:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
passports as one who testified on the
 
02:25:17.830 --> 02:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
c-a-c-r inquired
 
02:25:21.349 --> 02:25:21.359 align:start position:0%
this cacr creates creates unnecessary
 
02:25:24.309 --> 02:25:24.319 align:start position:0%
confusion and will actually prolong the
 
02:25:27.349 --> 02:25:27.359 align:start position:0%
debate over the definitions of domicile
 
02:25:29.270 --> 02:25:29.280 align:start position:0%
and residency
 
02:25:32.710 --> 02:25:32.720 align:start position:0%
and if passed in its current form
 
02:25:35.110 --> 02:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
no not only will be it more difficult to
 
02:25:36.870 --> 02:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
amend the bill
 
02:25:39.349 --> 02:25:39.359 align:start position:0%
but it will insert even more uncertainty
 
02:25:42.070 --> 02:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
into the already protracted debate
 
02:25:44.630 --> 02:25:44.640 align:start position:0%

02:26:15.760 --> 02:26:17.349 align:start position:0%

two-thirds
 
02:26:18.710 --> 02:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
mr speaker
 
02:26:21.030 --> 02:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
the election law committee is attempting
 
02:26:24.150 --> 02:26:24.160 align:start position:0%
to put to bed the endless debate in new
 
02:26:26.950 --> 02:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire over who should vote in a new
 
02:26:28.550 --> 02:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire election
 
02:26:33.349 --> 02:26:33.359 align:start position:0%
the old domicile residency state of mind
 
02:26:36.389 --> 02:26:36.399 align:start position:0%
we're trying to put that to bed
 
02:26:39.429 --> 02:26:39.439 align:start position:0%
mr speaker we are saying that if new
 
02:26:42.790 --> 02:26:42.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire is your primary residency
 
02:26:44.710 --> 02:26:44.720 align:start position:0%
you get to vote here
 
02:26:45.990 --> 02:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
we asked
 
02:26:47.830 --> 02:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
people testifying about this bill how
 
02:26:50.309 --> 02:26:50.319 align:start position:0%
many people do you think this will stop
 
02:26:51.910 --> 02:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
from voting in new hampshire election
 
02:26:54.710 --> 02:26:54.720 align:start position:0%
they said well realistically none
 
02:26:56.790 --> 02:26:56.800 align:start position:0%
why because you should already be a
 
02:26:59.270 --> 02:26:59.280 align:start position:0%
resident if you are voting here voting
 
02:27:01.110 --> 02:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
is an act of residency
 
02:27:02.630 --> 02:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
so mr speaker
 
02:27:05.750 --> 02:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
this is a common sense reform
 
02:27:08.630 --> 02:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
and the question before us is who should
 
02:27:11.670 --> 02:27:11.680 align:start position:0%
vote in a new hampshire election
 
02:27:13.990 --> 02:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
residents of new hampshire
 
02:27:15.349 --> 02:27:15.359 align:start position:0%
or residents
 
02:27:17.910 --> 02:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
and non-residents of new hampshire so mr
 
02:27:19.750 --> 02:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
speaker if you believe
 
02:27:21.990 --> 02:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
that non-residents should be voting in
 
02:27:23.750 --> 02:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire elections
 
02:27:25.429 --> 02:27:25.439 align:start position:0%
oppose this
 
02:27:28.070 --> 02:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if you believe that only
 
02:27:29.990 --> 02:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
residents of new hampshire should be
 
02:27:31.590 --> 02:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
voting in new hampshire
 
02:27:36.710 --> 02:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:39.750 --> 02:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the ought the
 
02:27:42.830 --> 02:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
majority ought to pass as amended on
 
02:27:42.840 --> 02:27:44.389 align:start position:0%
majority ought to pass as amended on

02:27:44.389 --> 02:27:44.399 align:start position:0%

members be in your seats
 
02:27:51.670 --> 02:27:51.680 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative

thank you mr speaker
 
02:28:03.590 --> 02:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
if i knew
 
02:28:06.710 --> 02:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
that cacr 15
 
02:28:08.230 --> 02:28:08.240 align:start position:0%
would not resolve
 
02:28:08.240 --> 02:28:10.070 align:start position:0%
would not resolve
ambiguities

02:28:10.070 --> 02:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
ambiguities
 
02:28:11.349 --> 02:28:11.359 align:start position:0%
could the representative just suspend
 
02:28:20.150 --> 02:28:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:21.590 --> 02:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
good to go
 
02:28:24.150 --> 02:28:24.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker if i knew that cacr
 
02:28:26.150 --> 02:28:26.160 align:start position:0%
15 would not resolve ambiguities but
 
02:28:27.590 --> 02:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
would actually
 
02:28:30.150 --> 02:28:30.160 align:start position:0%
introduce new ambiguities
 
02:28:32.070 --> 02:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
into the venerable new hampshire
 
02:28:34.950 --> 02:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
constitution of 1783
 
02:28:38.469 --> 02:28:38.479 align:start position:0%
and if i believed that cacr 15
 
02:28:40.710 --> 02:28:40.720 align:start position:0%
might impede ballot access
 
02:28:42.790 --> 02:28:42.800 align:start position:0%
for voters who move frequently
 
02:28:45.030 --> 02:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
because their housing is insecure would
 
02:28:46.950 --> 02:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
i press the red button so a new motion

thank you mr speaker
 
02:28:58.230 --> 02:28:58.240 align:start position:0%
if i know that this legislative body in
 
02:29:00.309 --> 02:29:00.319 align:start position:0%
multiple prior sessions has considered
 
02:29:03.830 --> 02:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
bills for statutes which can be changed
 
02:29:05.510 --> 02:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
by this body addressing the
 
02:29:08.070 --> 02:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
qualification of voters and if i know
 
02:29:09.910 --> 02:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
that the new hampshire constitution
 
02:29:12.790 --> 02:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
provides for a domicile qualification
 
02:29:15.190 --> 02:29:15.200 align:start position:0%
while in statute at this time domicile
 
02:29:17.910 --> 02:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
and residency have been defined and made
 
02:29:21.110 --> 02:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
equivalent and mr speaker if i agree
 
02:29:22.550 --> 02:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
that having these terms in our
 
02:29:25.270 --> 02:29:25.280 align:start position:0%
constitution is important today and in
 
02:29:27.270 --> 02:29:27.280 align:start position:0%
the future to make sure that only
 
02:29:29.110 --> 02:29:29.120 align:start position:0%

02:34:27.670 --> 02:34:27.680 align:start position:0%
if i knew
 
02:34:29.590 --> 02:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
that current law
 
02:34:32.309 --> 02:34:32.319 align:start position:0%
already does what this cacr
 
02:34:34.550 --> 02:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
proposes to do
 
02:34:36.389 --> 02:34:36.399 align:start position:0%

be conducted using paper ballots
 
02:34:43.590 --> 02:34:43.600 align:start position:0%
and if i knew that in public hearings
 
02:34:46.710 --> 02:34:46.720 align:start position:0%
before the election law committee
 
02:34:48.389 --> 02:34:48.399 align:start position:0%
the committee learned of no one who's
 
02:34:51.510 --> 02:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
suggesting that current law
 
02:34:55.349 --> 02:34:55.359 align:start position:0%
in this respect be changed in any way
 
02:34:58.630 --> 02:34:58.640 align:start position:0%
and if i believed that this cacr
 
02:35:00.870 --> 02:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
in practice would function
 
02:35:02.309 --> 02:35:02.319 align:start position:0%
to validate
 
02:35:04.389 --> 02:35:04.399 align:start position:0%
unfounded fears
 
02:35:06.469 --> 02:35:06.479 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire elections lack
 
02:35:06.479 --> 02:35:08.150 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire elections lack
integrity

02:35:08.150 --> 02:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
integrity
 
02:35:09.830 --> 02:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
02:35:12.790 --> 02:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
functioning to solve real problems
 
02:35:15.110 --> 02:35:15.120 align:start position:0%
would i press the red button
 
02:35:18.870 --> 02:35:18.880 align:start position:0%
so a new motion could be made thank you
 
02:35:20.630 --> 02:35:20.640 align:start position:0%

are vital in any election

02:35:43.830 --> 02:35:43.840 align:start position:0%
if i further know that a paper trail
 
02:35:45.510 --> 02:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
left behind from a paper ballot can
 
02:35:48.550 --> 02:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
survive long after a memory card
 
02:35:50.870 --> 02:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
has been wiped clean
 
02:35:53.590 --> 02:35:53.600 align:start position:0%

02:38:39.830 --> 02:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
an act requiring the date a person

the same report the same with the

recommendation that the bill ought to
 
02:38:49.429 --> 02:38:49.439 align:start position:0%

02:38:51.349 --> 02:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
02:38:53.190 --> 02:38:53.200 align:start position:0%
minority of the committee having
 
02:38:54.950 --> 02:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
considered the same and being unable to
 
02:38:56.389 --> 02:38:56.399 align:start position:0%
agree with the majority report with the
 
02:38:57.990 --> 02:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
following resolution result that is
 
02:39:00.230 --> 02:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate senator paul

02:39:12.550 --> 02:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
02:39:13.550 --> 02:39:13.560 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
02:39:16.469 --> 02:39:16.479 align:start position:0%
1009 would require that the data person
 
02:39:19.110 --> 02:39:19.120 align:start position:0%
registers to vote be included with other
 
02:39:22.070 --> 02:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
voter information in election net
 
02:39:24.230 --> 02:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
that's being done now and it's been done
 
02:39:26.070 --> 02:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
since 2006
 
02:39:27.670 --> 02:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
when the state launched the statewide
 
02:39:29.750 --> 02:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
voter registration database which was
 
02:39:31.590 --> 02:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
required under the federal help america
 
02:39:32.950 --> 02:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
vote act
 
02:39:34.950 --> 02:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
there's a field titled date of voter
 
02:39:37.510 --> 02:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
information which is the date of voter
 
02:39:37.520 --> 02:39:39.510 align:start position:0%
information which is the date of voter
registration

02:39:39.510 --> 02:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
registration
 
02:39:41.190 --> 02:39:41.200 align:start position:0%
right now the date of registration is
 
02:39:41.200 --> 02:39:42.550 align:start position:0%
right now the date of registration is
confidential

02:39:42.550 --> 02:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
confidential
 
02:39:44.389 --> 02:39:44.399 align:start position:0%
if the bill passes the date of
 
02:39:47.510 --> 02:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
registration will still be confidential
 
02:39:49.190 --> 02:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
the data fields that are printed on a
 
02:39:51.830 --> 02:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
checklist under state law now name
 
02:39:54.309 --> 02:39:54.319 align:start position:0%
domicile mailing address
 
02:39:56.389 --> 02:39:56.399 align:start position:0%
if different from domicile and party
 
02:39:56.399 --> 02:39:57.990 align:start position:0%
if different from domicile and party
affiliation

02:39:57.990 --> 02:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
affiliation
 
02:39:59.990 --> 02:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
the bill does not require that the date
 
02:40:01.590 --> 02:40:01.600 align:start position:0%
of registration be printed on the
 
02:40:01.600 --> 02:40:02.710 align:start position:0%
of registration be printed on the
checklist

02:40:02.710 --> 02:40:02.720 align:start position:0%
checklist
 
02:40:04.630 --> 02:40:04.640 align:start position:0%
so what will this bill do
 
02:40:07.030 --> 02:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
and here's the problem prior to the
 
02:40:08.870 --> 02:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
launch of election net
 
02:40:10.630 --> 02:40:10.640 align:start position:0%
towns and cities maintain their own
 
02:40:13.110 --> 02:40:13.120 align:start position:0%
voter registration databases
 
02:40:15.030 --> 02:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
whose primary purpose was to generate
 
02:40:16.630 --> 02:40:16.640 align:start position:0%
the checklist that would be used at the
 
02:40:16.640 --> 02:40:17.990 align:start position:0%
the checklist that would be used at the
polls

02:40:17.990 --> 02:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
polls
 
02:40:20.710 --> 02:40:20.720 align:start position:0%
since the date voters registered to vote
 
02:40:23.030 --> 02:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
wasn't needed to print a checklist that
 
02:40:24.870 --> 02:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
information wasn't contained in the
 
02:40:24.880 --> 02:40:26.710 align:start position:0%
information wasn't contained in the
database

02:40:26.710 --> 02:40:26.720 align:start position:0%
database
 
02:40:28.710 --> 02:40:28.720 align:start position:0%
so the bill creates an unfunded mandate
 
02:40:30.950 --> 02:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
there's no grandfather clause here
 
02:40:33.830 --> 02:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
in 2006 our towns and cities migrated
 
02:40:35.590 --> 02:40:35.600 align:start position:0%
approximately eight hundred and twenty
 
02:40:37.990 --> 02:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
five thousand voter records into
 
02:40:39.590 --> 02:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
election net
 
02:40:41.030 --> 02:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
most did not include the voters
 
02:40:42.950 --> 02:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
registration date
 
02:40:45.510 --> 02:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
since there's no grandfather clause
 
02:40:47.590 --> 02:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
the bill require that communities scour
 
02:40:51.110 --> 02:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
their databases identify the pre-2006
 
02:40:53.110 --> 02:40:53.120 align:start position:0%
voter records in an election that do not
 
02:40:55.190 --> 02:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
have a date of voter registration pull
 
02:40:57.750 --> 02:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
the paper record and then key in the
 
02:41:00.870 --> 02:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
updated voter registration information
 
02:41:03.190 --> 02:41:03.200 align:start position:0%
article 28a of the constitution
 
02:41:05.269 --> 02:41:05.279 align:start position:0%
prohibits the state from mandating any
 
02:41:08.070 --> 02:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
new expanded or modified programs or
 
02:41:10.309 --> 02:41:10.319 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to any political
 
02:41:12.469 --> 02:41:12.479 align:start position:0%
subdivision in such a way as to
 
02:41:14.309 --> 02:41:14.319 align:start position:0%
necessitate additional local
 
02:41:14.319 --> 02:41:16.389 align:start position:0%
necessitate additional local
expenditures

02:41:16.389 --> 02:41:16.399 align:start position:0%
expenditures
 
02:41:18.710 --> 02:41:18.720 align:start position:0%
house bill 1009 would require that
 
02:41:20.389 --> 02:41:20.399 align:start position:0%
election officials bear the cost of
 
02:41:24.230 --> 02:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
keying and data for the pre-2006 records
 
02:41:26.070 --> 02:41:26.080 align:start position:0%
without providing a means to reimburse
 
02:41:28.230 --> 02:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
the communities for their costs in doing
 
02:41:28.240 --> 02:41:29.349 align:start position:0%
the communities for their costs in doing
so

02:41:29.349 --> 02:41:29.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:41:31.429 --> 02:41:31.439 align:start position:0%
please press the no red button
 
02:41:33.190 --> 02:41:33.200 align:start position:0%
to overturn the committee recommendation
 
02:41:35.429 --> 02:41:35.439 align:start position:0%

the checklist available to the public

knowing when people register to vote and
 
02:42:02.070 --> 02:42:02.080 align:start position:0%

02:42:04.070 --> 02:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
empower granite staters to have a clear

thank you mr speaker
 
02:47:38.630 --> 02:47:38.640 align:start position:0%

circulation costs
 
02:48:14.230 --> 02:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
it costs money
 
02:48:15.750 --> 02:48:15.760 align:start position:0%

02:48:17.830 --> 02:48:17.840 align:start position:0%

and it actually summarizes quite well
 
02:48:37.670 --> 02:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
the point that i'm trying to make

standing here at the podium today
 
02:48:43.190 --> 02:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
it refers to house bill 1082 and it says
 
02:48:45.030 --> 02:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
this bill limits political speech by
 
02:48:46.870 --> 02:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
prohibiting candidates for secretary of
 
02:48:49.030 --> 02:48:49.040 align:start position:0%

soliciting contributions for such
organizations

02:48:58.230 --> 02:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
02:49:00.630 --> 02:49:00.640 align:start position:0%
it continues part one article 22 of the
 
02:49:02.950 --> 02:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire constitution states
 
02:49:04.710 --> 02:49:04.720 align:start position:0%
free speech and liberty the press are
 
02:49:06.389 --> 02:49:06.399 align:start position:0%
essential to the security of freedom in
 
02:49:07.429 --> 02:49:07.439 align:start position:0%
the state
 
02:49:09.349 --> 02:49:09.359 align:start position:0%
they ought therefore to be inviolably
 
02:49:11.429 --> 02:49:11.439 align:start position:0%
preserved and quote
 
02:49:14.230 --> 02:49:14.240 align:start position:0%
and it finals it ends with its position
 
02:49:15.830 --> 02:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
limits on all speech and particularly
 
02:49:17.910 --> 02:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
political speech may be a tempting
 
02:49:20.150 --> 02:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
solution to a perceived problem but it
 
02:49:23.670 --> 02:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
is not a proper solution
 
02:49:25.190 --> 02:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
during the public hearing on this bill
 
02:49:28.230 --> 02:49:28.240 align:start position:0%
in in the majority report
 
02:49:30.389 --> 02:49:30.399 align:start position:0%
the sponsor cited the quote nonpartisan
 
02:49:32.630 --> 02:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
nature of these two offices as just as
 
02:49:32.640 --> 02:49:34.630 align:start position:0%
nature of these two offices as just as
justification

02:49:34.630 --> 02:49:34.640 align:start position:0%
justification
 
02:49:36.950 --> 02:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
for these fundraising restrictions
 
02:49:38.710 --> 02:49:38.720 align:start position:0%
i don't think i need to remind you that
 
02:49:40.230 --> 02:49:40.240 align:start position:0%
all our town and city elections are
 
02:49:43.030 --> 02:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
non-partisan in nature too
 
02:49:45.349 --> 02:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
i hate to open the door to think that we
 
02:49:46.790 --> 02:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to have pacs in our
 
02:49:49.030 --> 02:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
names if we were running for election or
 
02:49:49.040 --> 02:49:51.190 align:start position:0%

re-election

re-election
 
02:49:52.710 --> 02:49:52.720 align:start position:0%
finally this bill would have a severe
 
02:49:54.389 --> 02:49:54.399 align:start position:0%
impact on the ability of candidates for
 
02:49:56.710 --> 02:49:56.720 align:start position:0%
secretary of state and state treasurer
 
02:49:59.349 --> 02:49:59.359 align:start position:0%
to gather the financial resources needed
 
02:50:01.110 --> 02:50:01.120 align:start position:0%
to effectively communicate with those
 
02:50:03.510 --> 02:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
who will cast votes in those elections
 
02:50:05.510 --> 02:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
and would pose in restrictions
 
02:50:07.750 --> 02:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
restrictions that our state and our
 
02:50:11.269 --> 02:50:11.279 align:start position:0%
federal constitutions cannot tolerate
 
02:50:13.030 --> 02:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
please press the red no button to
 
02:50:15.349 --> 02:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
overturn the committee recommendation so
 
02:50:17.910 --> 02:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
that another motion may be made and mr
 
02:50:20.150 --> 02:50:20.160 align:start position:0%

02:50:38.469 --> 02:50:38.479 align:start position:0%
technical question that i'm i'm hoping

you can
 
02:50:42.230 --> 02:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
sort of enlighten me on
 
02:50:45.030 --> 02:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
as most of us are probably all aware in
 
02:50:47.349 --> 02:50:47.359 align:start position:0%
new hampshire we we define
 
02:50:51.190 --> 02:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
pac and candidate committee separately
 
02:50:53.670 --> 02:50:53.680 align:start position:0%
and um i can't find an answer if this
 
02:50:53.680 --> 02:50:54.630 align:start position:0%
and um i can't find an answer if this
bill

02:50:54.630 --> 02:50:54.640 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:50:57.030 --> 02:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
includes candidate committees in
 
02:51:00.870 --> 02:51:00.880 align:start position:0%
addition to a regular pac or if it's
 
02:51:07.110 --> 02:51:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:09.269 --> 02:51:09.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:51:11.190 --> 02:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
based on my limited knowledge of
 
02:51:14.070 --> 02:51:14.080 align:start position:0%
campaign finance laws i consider a pac
 
02:51:16.309 --> 02:51:16.319 align:start position:0%
and a candidate committee the same thing
 
02:51:18.230 --> 02:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
in terms of filing reports with the
 
02:51:20.469 --> 02:51:20.479 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office
 
02:51:21.910 --> 02:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
does remember yield a further question
 
02:51:23.510 --> 02:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
no further questions
 
02:51:26.469 --> 02:51:26.479 align:start position:0%
member does not yield
 
02:51:27.990 --> 02:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative rayne
 
02:51:34.469 --> 02:51:34.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:37.429 --> 02:51:37.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
02:51:39.990 --> 02:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
this legislature and its wisdom
 
02:51:41.750 --> 02:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
made the office of secretary of state
 
02:51:45.269 --> 02:51:45.279 align:start position:0%
and state treasurer nonpartisan in 1997
 
02:51:49.670 --> 02:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
when it amended rsa14 colon 2-b
 
02:51:51.349 --> 02:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
while i didn't have the honor of being a
 
02:51:53.750 --> 02:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
member of this body back then
 
02:51:56.150 --> 02:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
i said i understand that at least part
 
02:51:58.469 --> 02:51:58.479 align:start position:0%
of the reason for having done so
 
02:52:00.309 --> 02:52:00.319 align:start position:0%
was because these offices are not
 
02:52:02.710 --> 02:52:02.720 align:start position:0%
partisan in nature and really should not
 
02:52:04.870 --> 02:52:04.880 align:start position:0%
be political in nature
 
02:52:06.790 --> 02:52:06.800 align:start position:0%
the political aspect of new hampshire
 
02:52:08.790 --> 02:52:08.800 align:start position:0%
elections is handled by our two great
 
02:52:11.269 --> 02:52:11.279 align:start position:0%
political parties and should not in any
 
02:52:14.389 --> 02:52:14.399 align:start position:0%
way be found in the department of state
 
02:52:16.950 --> 02:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
along that same line the administration
 
02:52:18.710 --> 02:52:18.720 align:start position:0%
of state finances should not be a
 
02:52:21.110 --> 02:52:21.120 align:start position:0%
political matter but a sensible
 
02:52:25.110 --> 02:52:25.120 align:start position:0%
professional and straightforward one
 
02:52:26.550 --> 02:52:26.560 align:start position:0%
i understand the contention that
 
02:52:29.190 --> 02:52:29.200 align:start position:0%
municipal candidates all over the state
 
02:52:31.190 --> 02:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
are also nonpartisan
 
02:52:33.349 --> 02:52:33.359 align:start position:0%
and can and would still be able to farm
 
02:52:35.990 --> 02:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
packs even if this bill were passed
 
02:52:36.000 --> 02:52:37.190 align:start position:0%
packs even if this bill were passed
however

02:52:37.190 --> 02:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
however
 
02:52:39.190 --> 02:52:39.200 align:start position:0%
they are seeking the votes of thousands
 
02:52:42.710 --> 02:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
of people in a popularly elected
 
02:52:44.870 --> 02:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
while we may call our decisions on
 
02:52:47.510 --> 02:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
secretary of state and state treasurer
 
02:52:48.950 --> 02:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
and election
 
02:52:51.429 --> 02:52:51.439 align:start position:0%
what they really amount to are
 
02:52:53.830 --> 02:52:53.840 align:start position:0%
appointments by a government body
 
02:52:55.830 --> 02:52:55.840 align:start position:0%
candidates for these constitutional
 
02:52:58.630 --> 02:52:58.640 align:start position:0%
offices are seeking the support of only
 
02:53:00.550 --> 02:53:00.560 align:start position:0%
a few hundred
 
02:53:02.790 --> 02:53:02.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is one of three states in
 
02:53:04.630 --> 02:53:04.640 align:start position:0%
which these officials are elected by the
 
02:53:07.269 --> 02:53:07.279 align:start position:0%
state legislature and not by the general
 
02:53:07.279 --> 02:53:08.630 align:start position:0%
state legislature and not by the general
electorate

02:53:08.630 --> 02:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
electorate
 
02:53:11.190 --> 02:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
in maine one of the other two states
 
02:53:13.750 --> 02:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
forming pacs is prohibited by those who
 
02:53:16.550 --> 02:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
would seek and serve in these offices
 
02:53:19.750 --> 02:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
in tennessee the third state the concept
 
02:53:21.830 --> 02:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
is viewed as so inappropriate that no
 
02:53:23.429 --> 02:53:23.439 align:start position:0%
one does it
 
02:53:25.429 --> 02:53:25.439 align:start position:0%
on an occasion in recent years when such
 
02:53:27.670 --> 02:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
a pac was formed in new hampshire
 
02:53:29.269 --> 02:53:29.279 align:start position:0%
it was similarly received with
 
02:53:29.279 --> 02:53:31.110 align:start position:0%
it was similarly received with
disapproval

02:53:31.110 --> 02:53:31.120 align:start position:0%
disapproval
 
02:53:33.590 --> 02:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
the best example of the need to maintain
 
02:53:35.670 --> 02:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
the integrity and non-political
 
02:53:37.750 --> 02:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan nature of the secretary of
 
02:53:39.830 --> 02:53:39.840 align:start position:0%
state's office in particular
 
02:53:41.830 --> 02:53:41.840 align:start position:0%
is the legacy of former secretary
 
02:53:43.590 --> 02:53:43.600 align:start position:0%
william gardner
 
02:53:46.389 --> 02:53:46.399 align:start position:0%
secretary gardner a lifelong democrat
 
02:53:48.550 --> 02:53:48.560 align:start position:0%
served this state well for four and a
 
02:53:50.070 --> 02:53:50.080 align:start position:0%
half decades
 
02:53:52.070 --> 02:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
and was elected repeatedly by both
 
02:53:54.309 --> 02:53:54.319 align:start position:0%
republican and democrat majorities in
 
02:53:56.230 --> 02:53:56.240 align:start position:0%
this legislature
 
02:53:58.950 --> 02:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
he was so elected and re-elected because
 
02:54:00.870 --> 02:54:00.880 align:start position:0%
of his effective
 
02:54:03.830 --> 02:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
fair even-handed management of new
 
02:54:06.950 --> 02:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire's elections
 
02:54:08.870 --> 02:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
allowing candidates for secretary of
 
02:54:10.870 --> 02:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
state and state treasurer
 
02:54:12.550 --> 02:54:12.560 align:start position:0%
to form political action committees
 
02:54:14.950 --> 02:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
would dangerously and unnecessarily
 
02:54:17.429 --> 02:54:17.439 align:start position:0%
inject politics and possible conflicts
 
02:54:20.550 --> 02:54:20.560 align:start position:0%
of interest into these important offices
 
02:54:22.469 --> 02:54:22.479 align:start position:0%
and do so to the disservice of new
 
02:54:24.309 --> 02:54:24.319 align:start position:0%
hampshire's citizens
 
02:54:25.990 --> 02:54:26.000 align:start position:0%

02:54:28.469 --> 02:54:28.479 align:start position:0%

02:55:54.550 --> 02:55:54.560 align:start position:0%
if i knew that this bill would make it
 
02:55:56.550 --> 02:55:56.560 align:start position:0%
impossible for persons who were
 
02:55:58.469 --> 02:55:58.479 align:start position:0%
interested in serving
 
02:56:00.710 --> 02:56:00.720 align:start position:0%
as the secretary of state
 
02:56:02.790 --> 02:56:02.800 align:start position:0%
or the state treasurer to make their
 
02:56:04.150 --> 02:56:04.160 align:start position:0%

the state and if i knew
 
02:56:12.870 --> 02:56:12.880 align:start position:0%
that public ignorance
 
02:56:14.950 --> 02:56:14.960 align:start position:0%
of those persons who are interested in
 
02:56:16.550 --> 02:56:16.560 align:start position:0%

treasurer
 
02:56:21.190 --> 02:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
would undermine or diminish democratic
 
02:56:23.110 --> 02:56:23.120 align:start position:0%
accountability and
 
02:56:25.030 --> 02:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
and might empower
 
02:56:25.040 --> 02:56:26.550 align:start position:0%

that in maine
 
02:56:53.990 --> 02:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
a nearly identical bill to this was
 
02:56:56.790 --> 02:56:56.800 align:start position:0%
passed after that state suffered from
 
02:56:56.800 --> 02:56:58.070 align:start position:0%
passed after that state suffered from
corruption

02:56:58.070 --> 02:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
corruption
 
02:56:59.670 --> 02:56:59.680 align:start position:0%
of their treasurer

thank you mr speaker
 
03:04:58.950 --> 03:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
this bill proposes to amend rsa 657
 
03:05:02.389 --> 03:05:02.399 align:start position:0%
colon 12 relative to absentee voting
 
03:05:04.870 --> 03:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
the statute currently states that quote
 
03:05:07.670 --> 03:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
upon receipt of a properly executed
 
03:05:10.469 --> 03:05:10.479 align:start position:0%
application for an absentee ballot a
 
03:05:12.309 --> 03:05:12.319 align:start position:0%
town or clerk shall ascertain if the
 
03:05:14.630 --> 03:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
applicant is on the checklist and if so
 
03:05:16.550 --> 03:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
the clerk shall send the materials end
 
03:05:16.560 --> 03:05:17.750 align:start position:0%
the clerk shall send the materials end
quote

03:05:17.750 --> 03:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
quote
 
03:05:19.670 --> 03:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
this bill proposes adding the following
 
03:05:22.070 --> 03:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
sentence to that statute quote under no
 
03:05:24.230 --> 03:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
circumstances shall a town or city clerk
 
03:05:26.150 --> 03:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
mail an absentee ballot
 
03:05:28.150 --> 03:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
unless and until such person has
 
03:05:30.870 --> 03:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
submitted a absentee ballot application
 
03:05:32.790 --> 03:05:32.800 align:start position:0%
the town of clerk has approved the
 
03:05:35.110 --> 03:05:35.120 align:start position:0%
application end quote
 
03:05:37.349 --> 03:05:37.359 align:start position:0%
in short the bill says the same thing
 
03:05:40.710 --> 03:05:40.720 align:start position:0%
that the statute already says
 
03:05:42.309 --> 03:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
no substance is being added to the
 
03:05:44.950 --> 03:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
statute that isn't already there
 
03:05:46.550 --> 03:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
among the principles of good legal
 
03:05:48.550 --> 03:05:48.560 align:start position:0%
writing unnecessary or extra words
 
03:05:50.469 --> 03:05:50.479 align:start position:0%
should be removed redundancy should be
 
03:05:52.710 --> 03:05:52.720 align:start position:0%
avoided and different words should not
 
03:05:55.110 --> 03:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
be used to say the same thing
 
03:05:57.910 --> 03:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
house bill 1153 is poorly crafted adds
 
03:05:59.590 --> 03:05:59.600 align:start position:0%
nothing to existing law and is totally
 
03:05:59.600 --> 03:06:01.269 align:start position:0%
nothing to existing law and is totally
unnecessary

03:06:01.269 --> 03:06:01.279 align:start position:0%
unnecessary
 
03:06:03.030 --> 03:06:03.040 align:start position:0%

ballot application has been received and
 
03:06:49.670 --> 03:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
approved by the town or city clerk
 
03:06:51.990 --> 03:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
the necessity for this clarification was
 
03:06:54.150 --> 03:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
demonstrated by testimony before the
 
03:06:56.790 --> 03:06:56.800 align:start position:0%
election law committee which revealed
 
03:06:59.670 --> 03:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
that some clerks include the actual
 
03:07:02.389 --> 03:07:02.399 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot when responding by mail
 
03:07:04.630 --> 03:07:04.640 align:start position:0%
to request for voter registration forms
 
03:07:07.590 --> 03:07:07.600 align:start position:0%
and absentee ballot applications
 
03:07:09.670 --> 03:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
the result is that some unregistered
 
03:07:09.680 --> 03:07:10.790 align:start position:0%
the result is that some unregistered
applicants

03:07:10.790 --> 03:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
applicants
 
03:07:13.670 --> 03:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
receive absentee ballots before becoming
 
03:07:15.190 --> 03:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
a registered voter
 
03:07:17.110 --> 03:07:17.120 align:start position:0%
and before their absentee ballot
 
03:07:18.630 --> 03:07:18.640 align:start position:0%
applications have been properly
 
03:07:18.640 --> 03:07:20.630 align:start position:0%
applications have been properly
certified

03:07:20.630 --> 03:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
certified
 
03:07:23.030 --> 03:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
members appreciate that as clarified by
 
03:07:24.469 --> 03:07:24.479 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
03:07:26.550 --> 03:07:26.560 align:start position:0%
clerks will have to perform two mailings
 
03:07:28.469 --> 03:07:28.479 align:start position:0%
one to send the application forms and
 
03:07:30.950 --> 03:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
one to send the absentee ballot
 
03:07:32.710 --> 03:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
however the majority of the election law
 
03:07:34.469 --> 03:07:34.479 align:start position:0%
committee believes that the requirement
 
03:07:36.070 --> 03:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
is worthwhile
 
03:07:37.990 --> 03:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
to ensure that registrations are
 
03:07:40.150 --> 03:07:40.160 align:start position:0%
processed before a registrant is
 
03:07:42.550 --> 03:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
provided an absentee ballot
 
03:07:45.910 --> 03:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
this will enhance election integrity
 
03:07:47.830 --> 03:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
by preventing official absentee ballots
 
03:07:50.389 --> 03:07:50.399 align:start position:0%
from going to unregistered voters
 
03:07:52.469 --> 03:07:52.479 align:start position:0%
who that may not have the right to vote
 
03:07:54.309 --> 03:07:54.319 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
03:07:56.950 --> 03:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
i therefore respectfully request
 
03:07:59.110 --> 03:07:59.120 align:start position:0%
that you press the green button to vote
 
03:08:01.349 --> 03:08:01.359 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker
 
03:09:16.309 --> 03:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
if i know that nothing is being added to
 
03:09:18.710 --> 03:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
the statute that isn't already there
 
03:09:20.550 --> 03:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
and if i know that the absentee voter
 
03:09:22.710 --> 03:09:22.720 align:start position:0%
registration and absentee balloting
 
03:09:24.229 --> 03:09:24.239 align:start position:0%

speaker appears in a different statute
 
03:09:30.150 --> 03:09:30.160 align:start position:0%
if i know that house bill 1153 is poorly
 
03:09:31.750 --> 03:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
crafted redundant and totally
 
03:09:34.469 --> 03:09:34.479 align:start position:0%
unnecessary but i then press the red no
 
03:09:36.630 --> 03:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
button so the subsequent motion may be
 
03:09:39.269 --> 03:09:39.279 align:start position:0%

representative bergeron to speak against
 
03:12:43.590 --> 03:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:45.670 --> 03:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
03:12:47.990 --> 03:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
this bill is amended revises statutes
 
03:12:49.590 --> 03:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
that were amended by senate bill 3
 
03:12:52.389 --> 03:12:52.399 align:start position:0%
during the 2017 session
 
03:12:53.910 --> 03:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
those provisions were subsequently
 
03:12:55.429 --> 03:12:55.439 align:start position:0%
struck down by the new hampshire supreme
 
03:12:57.349 --> 03:12:57.359 align:start position:0%
court which found that they imposed
 
03:12:59.030 --> 03:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
unreasonable burdens on the right to
 
03:13:01.830 --> 03:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
vote the minority agrees that there's a
 
03:13:03.670 --> 03:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
need to clean up the statutes affected
 
03:13:06.309 --> 03:13:06.319 align:start position:0%
by senate bill 3 in light of that ruling
 
03:13:08.070 --> 03:13:08.080 align:start position:0%
but this last minute amendment does not
 
03:13:09.590 --> 03:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
accomplish that
 
03:13:11.590 --> 03:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
the bill retains a two-tiered voter
 
03:13:13.269 --> 03:13:13.279 align:start position:0%
registration system which the court
 
03:13:15.510 --> 03:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
found was unnecessary
 
03:13:17.590 --> 03:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
and it introduces new confusions that
 
03:13:20.070 --> 03:13:20.080 align:start position:0%
will invite new litigation
 
03:13:21.349 --> 03:13:21.359 align:start position:0%
for example
 
03:13:23.670 --> 03:13:23.680 align:start position:0%
a person who registers to vote 30 days
 
03:13:25.429 --> 03:13:25.439 align:start position:0%
or less before an election
 
03:13:27.510 --> 03:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
and who doesn't have proof of residency
 
03:13:30.070 --> 03:13:30.080 align:start position:0%
can sign an affidavit if he acknowledges
 
03:13:33.190 --> 03:13:33.200 align:start position:0%
that his domicile may be verified
 
03:13:35.269 --> 03:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
a person who registers more than 30 days
 
03:13:37.349 --> 03:13:37.359 align:start position:0%
before an election does not have that
 
03:13:39.910 --> 03:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
option they cannot sign that residency
 
03:13:42.389 --> 03:13:42.399 align:start position:0%
affidavit instead they sign one in which
 
03:13:44.630 --> 03:13:44.640 align:start position:0%
they're swearing that quote they will
 
03:13:46.950 --> 03:13:46.960 align:start position:0%
not ever be able to possess any
 
03:13:49.910 --> 03:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
qualifying documents of domicile
 
03:13:51.190 --> 03:13:51.200 align:start position:0%
end quote
 
03:13:52.710 --> 03:13:52.720 align:start position:0%
if i were homeless i sure wouldn't want
 
03:13:54.309 --> 03:13:54.319 align:start position:0%
to swear under penalty of fines that i
 
03:13:56.630 --> 03:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
would be forever homeless but here's
 
03:13:59.510 --> 03:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
another example and this is a true story
 
03:14:01.030 --> 03:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
and it's the kind of situation that
 
03:14:03.110 --> 03:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
often occurs with new new residents to
 
03:14:05.269 --> 03:14:05.279 align:start position:0%
our communities
 
03:14:07.269 --> 03:14:07.279 align:start position:0%
just before i retired as city clerk in
 
03:14:10.630 --> 03:14:10.640 align:start position:0%
nashua came a woman came into our office
 
03:14:12.630 --> 03:14:12.640 align:start position:0%
she happened to
 
03:14:14.070 --> 03:14:14.080 align:start position:0%
i happen to be the one assisting her at
 
03:14:15.349 --> 03:14:15.359 align:start position:0%
the counter
 
03:14:16.550 --> 03:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
she and
 
03:14:17.830 --> 03:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
she had just gotten married a couple of
 
03:14:19.269 --> 03:14:19.279 align:start position:0%
weeks prior
 
03:14:21.030 --> 03:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
she and her husband had come in for the
 
03:14:23.110 --> 03:14:23.120 align:start position:0%

03:14:26.150 --> 03:14:26.160 align:start position:0%

03:14:27.750 --> 03:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
her husband lived in nashua he was
 
03:14:29.830 --> 03:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
renting a condo in nashua
 
03:14:31.750 --> 03:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
so after they were married she moved in
 
03:14:32.870 --> 03:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
with them
 
03:14:34.550 --> 03:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
the lease was in his name all the
 
03:14:36.550 --> 03:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
utilities were in his name
 
03:14:38.150 --> 03:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
and she wanted and needed to get a new
 
03:14:39.750 --> 03:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire driver's license because she
 
03:14:41.349 --> 03:14:41.359 align:start position:0%
needed to do that within two months of
 
03:14:43.429 --> 03:14:43.439 align:start position:0%
moving to new hampshire
 
03:14:45.030 --> 03:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
she brought her marriage certificate
 
03:14:46.710 --> 03:14:46.720 align:start position:0%
along with the copy of her husband's
 
03:14:48.790 --> 03:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
lease and her husband's utility bill
 
03:14:50.150 --> 03:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
because nothing had been changed over
 
03:14:50.160 --> 03:14:51.429 align:start position:0%
because nothing had been changed over
yet

03:14:51.429 --> 03:14:51.439 align:start position:0%
yet
 
03:14:52.950 --> 03:14:52.960 align:start position:0%
both of which had her husband's name on
 
03:14:54.150 --> 03:14:54.160 align:start position:0%
them and when she tried to get a
 
03:14:56.630 --> 03:14:56.640 align:start position:0%
driver's license she was refused
 
03:14:59.429 --> 03:14:59.439 align:start position:0%
the person at dmv actually told her that
 
03:15:01.190 --> 03:15:01.200 align:start position:0%
the marriage certificate didn't prove
 
03:15:02.630 --> 03:15:02.640 align:start position:0%
that she lived with her husband at that
 
03:15:02.640 --> 03:15:04.790 align:start position:0%
that she lived with her husband at that
address

03:15:04.790 --> 03:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
address
 
03:15:06.309 --> 03:15:06.319 align:start position:0%
so she wanted to register to vote to
 
03:15:08.710 --> 03:15:08.720 align:start position:0%
have proof of where she lived
 
03:15:10.710 --> 03:15:10.720 align:start position:0%
now i knew that they had come in they
 
03:15:12.630 --> 03:15:12.640 align:start position:0%
had got the license i knew her where her
 
03:15:14.070 --> 03:15:14.080 align:start position:0%
husband lived i had no problems
 
03:15:16.389 --> 03:15:16.399 align:start position:0%
whatsoever of registering that person to
 
03:15:16.399 --> 03:15:17.910 align:start position:0%
whatsoever of registering that person to
vote

03:15:17.910 --> 03:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
vote
 
03:15:19.750 --> 03:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
of course i can't do it if this couldn't
 
03:15:22.229 --> 03:15:22.239 align:start position:0%
have done it if this bill was in effect
 
03:15:23.910 --> 03:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
because she had no physical evidence of
 
03:15:26.309 --> 03:15:26.319 align:start position:0%
domicile and could not swear that she
 
03:15:28.389 --> 03:15:28.399 align:start position:0%
would quote not ever be able to possess
 
03:15:29.830 --> 03:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
any qualifying
 
03:15:32.229 --> 03:15:32.239 align:start position:0%
documents at domicile she was not would
 
03:15:34.229 --> 03:15:34.239 align:start position:0%
not be eligible to register to vote
 
03:15:37.110 --> 03:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
under this law as it's written
 
03:15:39.030 --> 03:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
another litigation concern
 
03:15:41.110 --> 03:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
the voter registration form for citizens
 
03:15:43.190 --> 03:15:43.200 align:start position:0%
registering to vote 30 days prior to an
 
03:15:43.200 --> 03:15:44.710 align:start position:0%
registering to vote 30 days prior to an
election

03:15:44.710 --> 03:15:44.720 align:start position:0%
election
 
03:15:48.469 --> 03:15:48.479 align:start position:0%
states that the applicant has to swear
 
03:15:50.229 --> 03:15:50.239 align:start position:0%
that to make that he has to make the
 
03:15:52.630 --> 03:15:52.640 align:start position:0%
address i have entered above my domicile
 
03:15:55.190 --> 03:15:55.200 align:start position:0%
for voting i must have an intent to make
 
03:15:57.110 --> 03:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
this the one place from which i
 
03:15:58.710 --> 03:15:58.720 align:start position:0%
participate in democratic
 
03:16:01.429 --> 03:16:01.439 align:start position:0%
self-government and must have acted to
 
03:16:03.990 --> 03:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
carry out that intent
 
03:16:06.309 --> 03:16:06.319 align:start position:0%
i have no idea what must have acted to
 
03:16:08.309 --> 03:16:08.319 align:start position:0%
carry out that intent means the
 
03:16:11.910 --> 03:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
expression is undefined unexplained
 
03:16:13.429 --> 03:16:13.439 align:start position:0%
the minority is concerned that the bill
 
03:16:15.269 --> 03:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
will make ballot access more confusing
 
03:16:16.950 --> 03:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
and difficult for some citizens to
 
03:16:19.110 --> 03:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
register to vote and the courts will end
 
03:16:21.190 --> 03:16:21.200 align:start position:0%
up having to weigh in again because we
 
03:16:23.429 --> 03:16:23.439 align:start position:0%
rush through this amended bill it needs
 
03:16:24.870 --> 03:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
more work
 
03:16:26.550 --> 03:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
please press the red no button to
 
03:16:28.630 --> 03:16:28.640 align:start position:0%
overturn the committee recommendation so
 
03:16:30.630 --> 03:16:30.640 align:start position:0%
that another motion may be made and mr
 
03:16:34.710 --> 03:16:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:36.630 --> 03:16:36.640 align:start position:0%
eric and as representative groan speak
 
03:16:39.750 --> 03:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:42.550 --> 03:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
03:16:45.110 --> 03:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
hb 1203 was introduced to remove
 
03:16:47.670 --> 03:16:47.680 align:start position:0%
language from the rsa that is no longer
 
03:16:50.070 --> 03:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
used because of a supreme court decision
 
03:16:51.670 --> 03:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
and to restore
 
03:16:53.750 --> 03:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
some necessary language that existed in
 
03:16:56.550 --> 03:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
the rsa prior to that decision however
 
03:17:00.229 --> 03:17:00.239 align:start position:0%
hb 1203 as introduced as introduced
 
03:17:02.309 --> 03:17:02.319 align:start position:0%
would have weakened the domicile
 
03:17:04.309 --> 03:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
residency requirements for voting in new
 
03:17:08.070 --> 03:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire for example 654 colon one
 
03:17:10.070 --> 03:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
the section that deals with the person's
 
03:17:13.269 --> 03:17:13.279 align:start position:0%
claim of domicile was amended to add a
 
03:17:15.910 --> 03:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
person's claim of domicile for voting
 
03:17:18.550 --> 03:17:18.560 align:start position:0%
purposes shall not be conclusive of the
 
03:17:22.389 --> 03:17:22.399 align:start position:0%
person's residence for any other purpose
 
03:17:22.399 --> 03:17:23.550 align:start position:0%
person's residence for any other purpose
amendment

03:17:23.550 --> 03:17:23.560 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:17:27.670 --> 03:17:27.680 align:start position:0%
962-h amends hb 1203 to replace all
 
03:17:29.670 --> 03:17:29.680 align:start position:0%
after the enacting clause
 
03:17:32.870 --> 03:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
as amended hb 1203 removes the language
 
03:17:34.309 --> 03:17:34.319 align:start position:0%
regarding voter
 
03:17:37.190 --> 03:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
registration forms and voter affidavits
 
03:17:38.950 --> 03:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
that is no longer used because of the
 
03:17:40.630 --> 03:17:40.640 align:start position:0%
court decision
 
03:17:42.950 --> 03:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
and it restores some language as i
 
03:17:45.030 --> 03:17:45.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned that existed in the rsa prior
 
03:17:47.990 --> 03:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
to the court decision
 
03:17:48.000 --> 03:17:48.870 align:start position:0%
to the court decision
this

03:17:48.870 --> 03:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:17:48.880 --> 03:17:49.990 align:start position:0%
this
language

03:17:49.990 --> 03:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
language
 
03:17:52.550 --> 03:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
is supported by the secretary of state's
 
03:17:56.229 --> 03:17:56.239 align:start position:0%
office i also added it this bill also
 
03:17:58.550 --> 03:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
adds language to strengthen and clarify
 
03:18:01.190 --> 03:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
the forms and processes used for
 
03:18:04.309 --> 03:18:04.319 align:start position:0%
registration prior to 30 days before an
 
03:18:06.630 --> 03:18:06.640 align:start position:0%
election and the forms and processes
 
03:18:09.670 --> 03:18:09.680 align:start position:0%
used for voting within or registering
 
03:18:11.510 --> 03:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
within 30 days
 
03:18:14.389 --> 03:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
of election or on election day
 
03:18:17.590 --> 03:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
the intent of this language is to ensure
 
03:18:19.830 --> 03:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
that every qualified new hampshire voter
 
03:18:22.790 --> 03:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
has a right to register and vote
 
03:18:26.309 --> 03:18:26.319 align:start position:0%
it is also to assure to the best we can
 
03:18:28.389 --> 03:18:28.399 align:start position:0%
that persons who are not qualified to
 
03:18:30.309 --> 03:18:30.319 align:start position:0%
vote in new hampshire should not be
 
03:18:32.309 --> 03:18:32.319 align:start position:0%
allowed to vote in new hampshire and
 
03:18:34.950 --> 03:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
thereby dilute the vote of those who are
 
03:18:37.670 --> 03:18:37.680 align:start position:0%
qualified to vote in new hampshire i
 
03:18:39.670 --> 03:18:39.680 align:start position:0%
urge you to support the election law
 
03:18:41.910 --> 03:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
committee's recommendation of ought to
 
03:18:49.349 --> 03:18:49.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:51.110 --> 03:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
a division has been requested this will
 
03:18:52.710 --> 03:18:52.720 align:start position:0%
be a division vote members take your
 
03:18:52.720 --> 03:19:15.750 align:start position:0%
be a division vote members take your
seats

03:19:15.750 --> 03:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:15.760 --> 03:19:30.150 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:19:30.150 --> 03:19:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:32.150 --> 03:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the majority
 
03:19:33.590 --> 03:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
committee report of what a passes
 
03:19:36.150 --> 03:19:36.160 align:start position:0%
amended on house bill 1203
 
03:19:37.910 --> 03:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative horrigan
 
03:19:45.990 --> 03:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:48.070 --> 03:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr speaker um before
 
03:19:49.590 --> 03:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
i start the p.i i have a very quick
 
03:19:50.870 --> 03:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
question was
 
03:19:52.070 --> 03:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
i was under the impression we were going
 
03:19:53.910 --> 03:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
to have a floor fight over the amendment
 
03:19:53.920 --> 03:19:54.870 align:start position:0%
to have a floor fight over the amendment
which

03:19:54.870 --> 03:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
which
 
03:19:56.229 --> 03:19:56.239 align:start position:0%
you're recognized for parliamentary
 
03:19:58.229 --> 03:19:58.239 align:start position:0%
inquiry okay so
 
03:20:00.150 --> 03:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
the real parliamentary in korea is
 
03:20:01.510 --> 03:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
trying to make us out of order that's
 
03:20:01.520 --> 03:20:02.950 align:start position:0%
trying to make us out of order that's
fine

03:20:02.950 --> 03:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
fine
 
03:20:05.590 --> 03:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you mr speaker
 
03:20:09.110 --> 03:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
if i know that the hp 1203 as amended is
 
03:20:11.030 --> 03:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
so poorly drafted it's hard to tell
 
03:20:13.110 --> 03:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
exactly what it does even after i reread
 
03:20:15.510 --> 03:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
it several times
 
03:20:17.349 --> 03:20:17.359 align:start position:0%
but if i was able to discern that this
 
03:20:19.110 --> 03:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
amendment does not protect the right to
 
03:20:20.870 --> 03:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
vote and does not simplify the voter
 
03:20:23.190 --> 03:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
registration process and the general
 
03:20:24.950 --> 03:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
does pretty much the exact opposite of
 
03:20:24.960 --> 03:20:25.910 align:start position:0%
does pretty much the exact opposite of
what

03:20:25.910 --> 03:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
what
 
03:20:27.510 --> 03:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
myself the prime sponsor of this bill
 
03:20:30.550 --> 03:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
and the co-sponsors intended
 
03:20:31.990 --> 03:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:20:34.469 --> 03:20:34.479 align:start position:0%
so find out so
 
03:20:36.150 --> 03:20:36.160 align:start position:0%
representative you're recognized for
 
03:20:39.269 --> 03:20:39.279 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry yes i
 
03:20:41.510 --> 03:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
i thought i was thought i was giving one
 
03:20:43.110 --> 03:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
so if i know
 
03:20:45.269 --> 03:20:45.279 align:start position:0%
that this amendment um does not do what
 
03:20:47.429 --> 03:20:47.439 align:start position:0%
the sponsor is intended
 
03:20:49.990 --> 03:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
when i then press the red button
 
03:20:52.870 --> 03:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
so that an alternative motion can be
 
03:20:55.990 --> 03:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
can be considered thank you mr speaker
 
03:20:57.510 --> 03:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
geo recognizer of senator barbara
 
03:21:02.070 --> 03:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:04.070 --> 03:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
03:21:06.469 --> 03:21:06.479 align:start position:0%
if i know that this bill has amended

practice is
 
03:21:14.950 --> 03:21:14.960 align:start position:0%

03:25:05.910 --> 03:25:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:14.870 --> 03:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:18.469 --> 03:25:18.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:20.309 --> 03:25:20.319 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know
 
03:25:23.429 --> 03:25:23.439 align:start position:0%
house bill 1247 would require that in
 
03:25:25.670 --> 03:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
any political subdivision that uses
 
03:25:31.030 --> 03:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:34.150 --> 03:25:34.160 align:start position:0%
any ballot that has been folded by
 
03:25:36.870 --> 03:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
any ballot that has unfolded uh be held
 
03:25:39.510 --> 03:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
for counting after the polls close
 
03:25:41.510 --> 03:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
and if i know the wyndham audit
 
03:25:43.910 --> 03:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
found that some folded ballots were not
 
03:25:45.349 --> 03:25:45.359 align:start position:0%
read properly
 
03:25:47.590 --> 03:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
by ballot counting machines due to a
 
03:25:47.600 --> 03:25:48.870 align:start position:0%
by ballot counting machines due to a
shadow

03:25:48.870 --> 03:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
shadow
 
03:25:51.269 --> 03:25:51.279 align:start position:0%
created by the fold running the scanner
 
03:25:54.229 --> 03:25:54.239 align:start position:0%
unable to accurately score the results
 
03:25:56.389 --> 03:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
mr speaker i further know
 
03:25:57.910 --> 03:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
that we would never have
 
03:26:00.550 --> 03:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
known the real intent of those voters
 
03:26:04.070 --> 03:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
if an audit had not been performed
 
03:26:05.429 --> 03:26:05.439 align:start position:0%
if i believe there's reason to think
 
03:26:06.790 --> 03:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
this can happen under other
 
03:26:06.800 --> 03:26:08.229 align:start position:0%
this can happen under other
circumstances

03:26:08.229 --> 03:26:08.239 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
03:26:10.229 --> 03:26:10.239 align:start position:0%
and if i know towns already hand count
 
03:26:11.750 --> 03:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
ballots when there's a write-in
 
03:26:14.070 --> 03:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
candidate on the ballot and that works
 
03:26:16.469 --> 03:26:16.479 align:start position:0%
just fine
 
03:26:17.990 --> 03:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
and finally if i know that this
 
03:26:18.000 --> 03:26:20.870 align:start position:0%
and finally if i know that this
legislation

03:26:20.870 --> 03:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:22.389 --> 03:26:22.399 align:start position:0%
would add an additional measure of
 
03:26:24.550 --> 03:26:24.560 align:start position:0%
security by requiring all folder ballots
 
03:26:27.269 --> 03:26:27.279 align:start position:0%
to be hand counted
 
03:26:29.429 --> 03:26:29.439 align:start position:0%
but i now press the red button
 
03:26:31.830 --> 03:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
to overturn the ital motion to ensure
 
03:26:33.990 --> 03:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
that every vote counts in return
 
03:26:35.910 --> 03:26:35.920 align:start position:0%
confidence to voters that the new
 
03:26:38.150 --> 03:26:38.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire legislature
 
03:26:39.830 --> 03:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
takes seriously the responsibility to
 
03:26:41.910 --> 03:26:41.920 align:start position:0%
safeguard the election process red
 
03:26:46.150 --> 03:26:46.160 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker
 
03:26:58.070 --> 03:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
if i know that hand counting ballots
 
03:27:01.510 --> 03:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
after the polls close we'll add another
 
03:27:04.710 --> 03:27:04.720 align:start position:0%
four to five hours to the 14-hour day
 
03:27:06.150 --> 03:27:06.160 align:start position:0%

03:27:09.590 --> 03:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
by our overworked election workers
 
03:27:11.590 --> 03:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
and if i know that one-third of the
 
03:27:14.710 --> 03:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
ballots cast in the 2020 general
 
03:27:18.550 --> 03:27:18.560 align:start position:0%
election were folded ballots
 
03:27:20.630 --> 03:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
and if i know that the committee's
 
03:27:23.110 --> 03:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
bipartisan majority
 
03:27:25.590 --> 03:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
knows that the local moderators already
 
03:27:27.990 --> 03:27:28.000 align:start position:0%

03:27:30.150 --> 03:27:30.160 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot
 
03:27:33.830 --> 03:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
be tallied by hand and the decision
 
03:27:37.190 --> 03:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
be should be left up to the discretion
 
03:27:39.830 --> 03:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
of the local election officials
 
03:27:43.269 --> 03:27:43.279 align:start position:0%

that even if passed this bill would have

followed for a community to opt in
 
03:36:10.870 --> 03:36:10.880 align:start position:0%

contributions
 
03:40:27.670 --> 03:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
this bill is the solution that was
 
03:40:30.950 --> 03:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
proposed by judge mcauliffe in his 1999
 
03:40:34.550 --> 03:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
opinion when he declared the broadband
 
03:40:36.229 --> 03:40:36.239 align:start position:0%
on all corporate
 
03:40:39.910 --> 03:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
contributions unconstitutional
 
03:40:41.670 --> 03:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
he recommended that business
 
03:40:44.469 --> 03:40:44.479 align:start position:0%
organizations be limited to usually
 
03:40:48.150 --> 03:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
using only specifically segregated funds
 
03:40:49.910 --> 03:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
rather than those from the company's
 
03:40:51.510 --> 03:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
general treasurer
 
03:40:54.229 --> 03:40:54.239 align:start position:0%
instead this body changed the law so
 
03:40:56.309 --> 03:40:56.319 align:start position:0%
that corporations have no restrictions
 
03:40:58.150 --> 03:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
on where their campaign contributions
 
03:41:00.630 --> 03:41:00.640 align:start position:0%
come come from creating an unfair
 
03:41:03.030 --> 03:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
advantage for corporations over labor
 
03:41:03.040 --> 03:41:04.309 align:start position:0%
advantage for corporations over labor
unions

unions
 
03:41:06.870 --> 03:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
it does not adversely affect the first
 
03:41:09.750 --> 03:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
amendment of business organizations just
 
03:41:12.550 --> 03:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
as it does not adversely affect those of
 
03:41:15.910 --> 03:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
labor unions all the bill does is apply
 
03:41:18.309 --> 03:41:18.319 align:start position:0%

to agree with the majority report the
 
03:46:09.429 --> 03:46:09.439 align:start position:0%
recommendation that the bill ought to
 
03:46:11.110 --> 03:46:11.120 align:start position:0%
pass senator connie lane for the
 
03:46:12.790 --> 03:46:12.800 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker
 
03:46:25.750 --> 03:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
this bill clarifies that individual
 
03:46:28.389 --> 03:46:28.399 align:start position:0%
members of a limited liability company
 
03:46:30.550 --> 03:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
are subject to the same political
 
03:46:32.950 --> 03:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
campaign contribution limits
 
03:46:35.510 --> 03:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
as our individuals such as us and
 
03:46:35.520 --> 03:46:37.110 align:start position:0%
as our individuals such as us and
corporations

03:46:37.110 --> 03:46:37.120 align:start position:0%
corporations
 
03:46:40.630 --> 03:46:40.640 align:start position:0%
presently each llc is treated separately
 
03:46:42.389 --> 03:46:42.399 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of direct campaign
 
03:46:45.510 --> 03:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
contributions regardless of who controls
 
03:46:48.070 --> 03:46:48.080 align:start position:0%
it or who belongs to it
 
03:46:49.750 --> 03:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
candidates can receive multiple
 
03:46:52.790 --> 03:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
contributions from separate llcs
 
03:46:54.710 --> 03:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
which are often created at the same
 
03:46:56.950 --> 03:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
address and controlled by the same
 
03:47:00.469 --> 03:47:00.479 align:start position:0%
person corporation or group of people
 
03:47:03.750 --> 03:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
these members of the members of the llcs
 
03:47:05.990 --> 03:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
whether individuals or corporations are
 
03:47:08.550 --> 03:47:08.560 align:start position:0%
allowed to spend over the statutory
 
03:47:11.590 --> 03:47:11.600 align:start position:0%
campaign limits set for them by using
 
03:47:14.070 --> 03:47:14.080 align:start position:0%
this loophole which has become known as
 
03:47:16.950 --> 03:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
the llc lupo
 
03:47:18.950 --> 03:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
this bill would close that
 
03:47:21.269 --> 03:47:21.279 align:start position:0%
making the existing contribution limits
 
03:47:23.189 --> 03:47:23.199 align:start position:0%
meaning meaningful
 
03:47:25.510 --> 03:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
because without them they're meaningless
 
03:47:27.830 --> 03:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
without it individuals and corporations
 
03:47:30.150 --> 03:47:30.160 align:start position:0%
can form numerous llc's to get around
 
03:47:31.750 --> 03:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
the caps
 
03:47:34.150 --> 03:47:34.160 align:start position:0%
this bill is not in violation of
 
03:47:36.469 --> 03:47:36.479 align:start position:0%
anyone's first amendment rights as some
 
03:47:37.830 --> 03:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
have claimed
 
03:47:40.630 --> 03:47:40.640 align:start position:0%
just as campaign limits for individuals
 
03:47:43.429 --> 03:47:43.439 align:start position:0%
and corporations are not violations of
 
03:47:46.070 --> 03:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
their first amendment rights all this
 
03:47:49.189 --> 03:47:49.199 align:start position:0%
does is close the loophole available now
 
03:47:51.269 --> 03:47:51.279 align:start position:0%
only to llcs
 
03:47:54.309 --> 03:47:54.319 align:start position:0%
this bill is a campaign financing bill
 
03:47:56.950 --> 03:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
that increases transparency and
 
03:47:56.960 --> 03:47:58.389 align:start position:0%
that increases transparency and
accountability

03:47:58.389 --> 03:47:58.399 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
03:48:00.389 --> 03:48:00.399 align:start position:0%
and the fact that we did campaign
 
03:48:03.030 --> 03:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
financing last year doesn't mean we can
 
03:48:05.910 --> 03:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
continue to clean up campaign financing
 
03:48:07.030 --> 03:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
this year
 
03:48:08.950 --> 03:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker and i would ask for

1394
 
03:48:39.750 --> 03:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
is a bill that simply cannot and should
 
03:48:42.309 --> 03:48:42.319 align:start position:0%
not work for new hampshire this proposed
 
03:48:44.070 --> 03:48:44.080 align:start position:0%
legislation will require political
 
03:48:46.950 --> 03:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
contributions made by an llc to be
 
03:48:49.510 --> 03:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
attributed to the member of the llc and
 
03:48:51.510 --> 03:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
counted against their contribution limit
 
03:48:51.520 --> 03:48:52.790 align:start position:0%
counted against their contribution limit
however

03:48:52.790 --> 03:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
however
 
03:48:55.189 --> 03:48:55.199 align:start position:0%
we don't track memberships of llcs in
 
03:48:56.469 --> 03:48:56.479 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire you could
 
03:48:59.750 --> 03:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
have a one-member llc or a 50-member llc
 
03:49:01.590 --> 03:49:01.600 align:start position:0%
and no existing state statute or
 
03:49:03.590 --> 03:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
proposed state statute by this
 
03:49:06.070 --> 03:49:06.080 align:start position:0%
legislation would report to the public
 
03:49:08.469 --> 03:49:08.479 align:start position:0%
or to any state agency the membership of
 
03:49:11.830 --> 03:49:11.840 align:start position:0%
that llc a contribution from an llc is
 
03:49:13.830 --> 03:49:13.840 align:start position:0%
viewed the same as a contribution from
 
03:49:16.469 --> 03:49:16.479 align:start position:0%
an individual in state law and in court
 
03:49:18.150 --> 03:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
findings and we should not upend that
 
03:49:18.160 --> 03:49:19.269 align:start position:0%
findings and we should not upend that
process

03:49:19.269 --> 03:49:19.279 align:start position:0%
process

thank you mr speaker
 
03:54:38.870 --> 03:54:38.880 align:start position:0%

the federal standard from five percent
 
03:54:44.550 --> 03:54:44.560 align:start position:0%
lowers the federal standard
 
03:54:46.229 --> 03:54:46.239 align:start position:0%
from five percent to 3
 
03:54:48.469 --> 03:54:48.479 align:start position:0%
without any rationale
 
03:54:50.950 --> 03:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
or population data to support a stricter
 
03:54:52.870 --> 03:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
new hampshire standard
 
03:54:55.910 --> 03:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
which even at 3 percent does not apply
 
03:54:58.790 --> 03:54:58.800 align:start position:0%
anywhere in the state
 
03:55:00.389 --> 03:55:00.399 align:start position:0%
and mr speaker
 
03:55:02.070 --> 03:55:02.080 align:start position:0%
if i know that this requirement
 
03:55:04.710 --> 03:55:04.720 align:start position:0%
especially the third language
 
03:55:07.030 --> 03:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
could be inordinately expensive and in
 
03:55:08.389 --> 03:55:08.399 align:start position:0%
some cases
 
03:55:10.790 --> 03:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
a legally defensible translation may not
 
03:55:12.309 --> 03:55:12.319 align:start position:0%
be possible
 
03:55:15.110 --> 03:55:15.120 align:start position:0%
and finally mr speaker if at some future
 
03:55:16.630 --> 03:55:16.640 align:start position:0%
point the new hampshire population
 
03:55:20.790 --> 03:55:20.800 align:start position:0%
demographics do change sufficiently
 
03:55:23.910 --> 03:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
to warrant a multi-language ballot
 
03:55:25.990 --> 03:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
we should start with a blank sheet of
 
03:55:26.000 --> 03:55:26.950 align:start position:0%
we should start with a blank sheet of
paper

03:55:26.950 --> 03:55:26.960 align:start position:0%

04:11:23.830 --> 04:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
i want to begin by saying that the
 
04:11:25.990 --> 04:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
minority recommendation printed in the
 
04:11:29.189 --> 04:11:29.199 align:start position:0%

04:11:30.710 --> 04:11:30.720 align:start position:0%
to pass
 
04:11:32.790 --> 04:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
the full committee supports an audit of
 
04:11:34.950 --> 04:11:34.960 align:start position:0%
the education freedom accounts
 
04:11:38.070 --> 04:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
not one person spoke against it we just

04:11:41.590 --> 04:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
place
 
04:11:44.870 --> 04:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
the amendment delays it by one year
 
04:11:47.990 --> 04:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
this program gives parents four thousand
 
04:11:50.870 --> 04:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
to eight thousand dollars per child
 
04:11:53.030 --> 04:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
which can be spent
 
04:11:55.510 --> 04:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
or it can be kept on account to be used
 
04:11:58.070 --> 04:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
in future years by the parents
 
04:12:00.229 --> 04:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
the state will give an outside

contractor more than eight million
 
04:12:05.429 --> 04:12:05.439 align:start position:0%

dollars or more next year
 
04:12:10.309 --> 04:12:10.319 align:start position:0%
it is our responsibility as state
 
04:12:12.950 --> 04:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
representatives to ensure
 
04:12:16.070 --> 04:12:16.080 align:start position:0%

the income eligibility determined
 
04:12:36.149 --> 04:12:36.159 align:start position:0%
this can be complicated
 
04:12:38.630 --> 04:12:38.640 align:start position:0%
for married pare unmarried parents or
 
04:12:41.189 --> 04:12:41.199 align:start position:0%

since the main focus of this audit is
 
04:13:38.870 --> 04:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
accountability for state money and not

and give an opportunity to fix those

and we can make any needed legislative
 
04:14:31.189 --> 04:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:33.189 --> 04:14:33.199 align:start position:0%

i strongly support auditing the various
 
04:14:46.070 --> 04:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
departments and programs in the

executive branch having those audits
 
04:14:50.149 --> 04:14:50.159 align:start position:0%
done reviewing them and then following
 
04:14:52.710 --> 04:14:52.720 align:start position:0%
up to make sure good recommendations for
 
04:14:54.389 --> 04:14:54.399 align:start position:0%
change are implemented is an important
 
04:14:57.110 --> 04:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
part of the job for this legislature
 
04:14:57.120 --> 04:14:58.309 align:start position:0%
part of the job for this legislature
however

04:14:58.309 --> 04:14:58.319 align:start position:0%
however
 
04:14:59.910 --> 04:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
for an audit to provide useful
 
04:15:01.670 --> 04:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
information a program has to have been
 
04:15:04.790 --> 04:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
in place with stable rules for a minimum
 
04:15:07.349 --> 04:15:07.359 align:start position:0%
of one year and preferably several years
 
04:15:09.030 --> 04:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
that is the recommendation the committee
 
04:15:11.269 --> 04:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
received from the director of the audit
 
04:15:12.950 --> 04:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
division of the legislative budget
 
04:15:12.960 --> 04:15:14.309 align:start position:0%
division of the legislative budget
assistant

04:15:14.309 --> 04:15:14.319 align:start position:0%
assistant
 
04:15:15.830 --> 04:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
the problem is that the rules for the
 
04:15:18.149 --> 04:15:18.159 align:start position:0%
education freedom account program were
 
04:15:19.990 --> 04:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
just approved by the joint legislative
 
04:15:22.149 --> 04:15:22.159 align:start position:0%
committee on administrative rules and
 
04:15:24.950 --> 04:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
the final rules do differ significantly
 
04:15:26.710 --> 04:15:26.720 align:start position:0%
from the interim rules that it started
 
04:15:26.720 --> 04:15:27.830 align:start position:0%
from the interim rules that it started
with

04:15:27.830 --> 04:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:15:29.750 --> 04:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
also as we have seen
 
04:15:31.349 --> 04:15:31.359 align:start position:0%
there are many bills before the house
 
04:15:32.950 --> 04:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
that could affect this program and there
 
04:15:34.309 --> 04:15:34.319 align:start position:0%
are more bills
 
04:15:35.990 --> 04:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
before the other body if any of those
 
04:15:38.229 --> 04:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
bills passed they would also affect the
 
04:15:40.309 --> 04:15:40.319 align:start position:0%
operation of the program
 
04:15:42.229 --> 04:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
if the state is to spend the resources
 
04:15:44.469 --> 04:15:44.479 align:start position:0%
of the audit division to do the audit
 
04:15:46.070 --> 04:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
and at the department of education to
 
04:15:48.550 --> 04:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
provide information for that audit it
 
04:15:50.389 --> 04:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
should be done in a time frame which
 
04:15:53.189 --> 04:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
will provide useful information
 
04:15:55.030 --> 04:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
if done too soon it won't be an audit of
 
04:15:57.269 --> 04:15:57.279 align:start position:0%
the actual program as it operates and
 
04:15:59.510 --> 04:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
would operate into the future that could
 
04:16:01.990 --> 04:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
result in inconclusive and inaccurate
 
04:16:04.309 --> 04:16:04.319 align:start position:0%
results from the audit the amendment to
 
04:16:06.070 --> 04:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
this bill moves the effective date from
 
04:16:09.510 --> 04:16:09.520 align:start position:0%
july of this year to july of 2023
 
04:16:11.349 --> 04:16:11.359 align:start position:0%
doing so will ensure that there is at
 
04:16:14.070 --> 04:16:14.080 align:start position:0%
least one full school year and fiscal
 
04:16:16.790 --> 04:16:16.800 align:start position:0%

we heard in committee
 
04:30:30.389 --> 04:30:30.399 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons not to pass this bill
 
04:30:32.070 --> 04:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
was because if a person has an allergic
 
04:30:34.550 --> 04:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
reaction or skin condition a

a cosmetologist or an aesthetician is
 
04:30:43.349 --> 04:30:43.359 align:start position:0%
not a doctor nor dermatologist both
 
04:30:44.630 --> 04:30:44.640 align:start position:0%

they are not allowed to diagnose or
 
04:30:47.830 --> 04:30:47.840 align:start position:0%

04:30:50.229 --> 04:30:50.239 align:start position:0%
allergic reactions
 
04:30:52.710 --> 04:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
an example of someone that may choose to
 
04:30:54.070 --> 04:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
own or operate one of these
 
04:30:55.750 --> 04:30:55.760 align:start position:0%

not now
 
04:31:03.830 --> 04:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
possibly a person that holds
 
04:31:06.469 --> 04:31:06.479 align:start position:0%
certification and makeup application
 
04:31:08.309 --> 04:31:08.319 align:start position:0%
another example is a person that has a
 
04:31:10.550 --> 04:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
natural-born talent that they have honed
 
04:31:12.389 --> 04:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
in over the years and decides to open a
 
04:31:14.550 --> 04:31:14.560 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker
 
04:37:33.830 --> 04:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
i rise today in opposition to the
 
04:37:36.869 --> 04:37:36.879 align:start position:0%
majority amendment 0399-h to house bill

04:37:39.029 --> 04:37:39.039 align:start position:0%
1330.
 
04:37:41.910 --> 04:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
the majority amendment repeals the board
 
04:37:44.310 --> 04:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
of medical technicians and ends the
 
04:37:47.029 --> 04:37:47.039 align:start position:0%
registration of individuals who work in
 
04:37:49.750 --> 04:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
medical fields and both have contact
 
04:37:50.949 --> 04:37:50.959 align:start position:0%
with the public
 
04:37:54.551 --> 04:37:54.561 align:start position:0%
and opportunity to divert opioid drugs
 
04:37:56.789 --> 04:37:56.799 align:start position:0%
we would revert to the private sector to
 
04:37:59.269 --> 04:37:59.279 align:start position:0%
prevent drug diversion and there is good
 
04:38:02.629 --> 04:38:02.639 align:start position:0%
evidence that that has been ineffective
 
04:38:05.910 --> 04:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
this board was established in 2016 in
 
04:38:08.551 --> 04:38:08.561 align:start position:0%
response to the hepatitis c outbreak at
 
04:38:11.910 --> 04:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
exeter hospital briefly a traveling
 
04:38:13.750 --> 04:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
technician in the cardiac
 
04:38:16.629 --> 04:38:16.639 align:start position:0%
catheterization lab was diverting
 
04:38:18.949 --> 04:38:18.959 align:start position:0%
fentanyl for personal use
 
04:38:21.349 --> 04:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
refilling drug vials with saline using
 
04:38:23.910 --> 04:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
dirty needles and thereby contaminating
 
04:38:27.510 --> 04:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
them with his own hepatitis c
 
04:38:30.789 --> 04:38:30.799 align:start position:0%
public health tested 1074 patients who
 
04:38:32.470 --> 04:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
had procedures
 
04:38:35.029 --> 04:38:35.039 align:start position:0%
32 patients were identified with active
 
04:38:36.551 --> 04:38:36.561 align:start position:0%
hepatitis c
 
04:38:39.510 --> 04:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
identical to the technician's virus and
 
04:38:41.910 --> 04:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
27 additional patients had evidence of
 
04:38:44.470 --> 04:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
past hepatitis c infection but their
 
04:38:47.910 --> 04:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
virus could not be tested
 
04:38:50.709 --> 04:38:50.719 align:start position:0%
the individual involved was eventually
 
04:38:54.390 --> 04:38:54.400 align:start position:0%
sentenced to 39 years in federal prison
 
04:38:58.070 --> 04:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
for infecting 46 people in four states
 
04:39:00.470 --> 04:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
with this deadly disease
 
04:39:03.189 --> 04:39:03.199 align:start position:0%
he told his story to newsweek
 
04:39:06.310 --> 04:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
and it was published as the cover story
 
04:39:09.830 --> 04:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
confessions of a night shift junkie
 
04:39:12.709 --> 04:39:12.719 align:start position:0%
in june 2015.
 
04:39:14.551 --> 04:39:14.561 align:start position:0%
the u.s attorney for new hampshire
 
04:39:18.629 --> 04:39:18.639 align:start position:0%
described him as a serial infector
 
04:39:20.629 --> 04:39:20.639 align:start position:0%
newsweek quoted this technician as
 
04:39:20.639 --> 04:39:21.750 align:start position:0%
newsweek quoted this technician as
saying

04:39:21.750 --> 04:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
saying
 
04:39:24.470 --> 04:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
somebody has to tell how it's done
 
04:39:27.349 --> 04:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
how easy it is and how the structure of
 
04:39:31.990 --> 04:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
the hospitals isn't any good to stop it
 
04:39:34.551 --> 04:39:34.561 align:start position:0%
he told how he hid his drug use
 
04:39:37.350 --> 04:39:37.360 align:start position:0%
how he manipulated staffing agencies to
 
04:39:39.830 --> 04:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
continue to get new hospital jobs and
 
04:39:42.070 --> 04:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
how he was ultimately caught when the
 
04:39:44.868 --> 04:39:44.878 align:start position:0%
hepatitis c outbreak occurred at exeter
 
04:39:48.310 --> 04:39:48.320 align:start position:0%
hospital the last of the 19 hospitals in
 
04:39:51.590 --> 04:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
eight states where he had worked
 
04:39:53.670 --> 04:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
clearly the private sector was totally
 
04:39:57.030 --> 04:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
ineffective in protecting the public
 
04:39:59.750 --> 04:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
as a hospital trustee i know that i have
 
04:40:02.310 --> 04:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
learned to suspect applications from
 
04:40:04.948 --> 04:40:04.958 align:start position:0%
people who have moved from jurisdiction
 
04:40:07.110 --> 04:40:07.120 align:start position:0%
to jurisdiction
 
04:40:09.590 --> 04:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
and yet despite the testimony of the new
 
04:40:11.910 --> 04:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital association and
 
04:40:14.390 --> 04:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
others the majority wants us to remove
 
04:40:17.030 --> 04:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
this registration process that deters
 
04:40:19.990 --> 04:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
serial infectors from applying for jobs
 
04:40:22.310 --> 04:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
04:40:23.990 --> 04:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire was the first state to
 
04:40:26.550 --> 04:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
require registration of such technicians
 
04:40:28.628 --> 04:40:28.638 align:start position:0%
and there have been no similar outbreaks
 
04:40:30.948 --> 04:40:30.958 align:start position:0%
in the state subsequently
 
04:40:33.910 --> 04:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
just by requiring registration we deter
 
04:40:36.390 --> 04:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
most of these people who skip from state
 
04:40:38.868 --> 04:40:38.878 align:start position:0%
to state one step ahead of the law from
 
04:40:41.750 --> 04:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
applying to positions in new hampshire
 
04:40:43.910 --> 04:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
according to the association of surgical
 
04:40:46.708 --> 04:40:46.718 align:start position:0%
technologists as of now 12 states
 
04:40:48.470 --> 04:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
require certification of surgical
 
04:40:50.948 --> 04:40:50.958 align:start position:0%
technologists and three more besides new
 
04:40:54.150 --> 04:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire require registration
 
04:40:56.708 --> 04:40:56.718 align:start position:0%
i urge you all to defeat this amendment
 
04:40:58.310 --> 04:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
so the minority amendment which would
 
04:41:00.708 --> 04:41:00.718 align:start position:0%
continue to protect your constituents
 
04:41:03.430 --> 04:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
and the public can be brought forward i
 
04:41:06.550 --> 04:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:08.550 --> 04:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
the member from hooksett
 
04:41:10.310 --> 04:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
representative yakubovic is recognized
 
04:41:11.750 --> 04:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
to speak in support of the committee
 
04:41:11.760 --> 04:41:17.190 align:start position:0%
to speak in support of the committee
amendment

04:41:17.190 --> 04:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:22.948 --> 04:41:22.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:24.310 --> 04:41:24.320 align:start position:0%
so the registration of medical
 
04:41:27.110 --> 04:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
technicians is extremely rare in the us
 
04:41:27.120 --> 04:41:27.990 align:start position:0%
technicians is extremely rare in the us
and

04:41:27.990 --> 04:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:41:29.590 --> 04:41:29.600 align:start position:0%
in the existing structure we're already
 
04:41:31.110 --> 04:41:31.120 align:start position:0%
talking about layers and layers of
 
04:41:33.510 --> 04:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
institutions that oversee and work with
 
04:41:35.430 --> 04:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
the technicians because technicians work
 
04:41:40.150 --> 04:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
inside a hospital or inside a lab
 
04:41:41.990 --> 04:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
i i want to we want to pass this
 
04:41:43.430 --> 04:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
amendment the majority of the committee
 
04:41:45.110 --> 04:41:45.120 align:start position:0%
because shifting of responsibility is
 
04:41:47.030 --> 04:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
very dangerous faceless bureaucracy is
 
04:41:48.628 --> 04:41:48.638 align:start position:0%
not going to help
 
04:41:50.390 --> 04:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
much when when
 
04:41:52.390 --> 04:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
there are already layers of people that
 
04:41:53.830 --> 04:41:53.840 align:start position:0%
are responsible like the hospital
 
04:41:56.550 --> 04:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
trustees the insurance corporation for
 
04:41:59.350 --> 04:41:59.360 align:start position:0%
the hospital the hospital administrators
 
04:42:02.070 --> 04:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
the doctors the nurses the staff should
 
04:42:02.080 --> 04:42:02.868 align:start position:0%
the doctors the nurses the staff should
see

04:42:02.868 --> 04:42:02.878 align:start position:0%
see
 
04:42:04.550 --> 04:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
who they hire and what they do to
 
04:42:07.110 --> 04:42:07.120 align:start position:0%
patients they've promised not to do harm
 
04:42:09.670 --> 04:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
and they'll and they fall back on the
 
04:42:11.670 --> 04:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy to protect
 
04:42:14.708 --> 04:42:14.718 align:start position:0%
uh their business
 
04:42:16.310 --> 04:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
there's a break in the chain of command
 
04:42:18.310 --> 04:42:18.320 align:start position:0%
and they should be responsible on what
 
04:42:20.550 --> 04:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
happens to the patients that's why we're
 
04:42:22.550 --> 04:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
repealing this unnecessary
 
04:42:27.350 --> 04:42:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:28.868 --> 04:42:28.878 align:start position:0%
it's holding us back from providing
 
04:42:30.868 --> 04:42:30.878 align:start position:0%
better services the health care
 
04:42:32.868 --> 04:42:32.878 align:start position:0%
facilities already struggling to hire
 
04:42:32.878 --> 04:42:34.550 align:start position:0%
facilities already struggling to hire
workers

04:42:34.550 --> 04:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
workers
 
04:42:37.030 --> 04:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
and if we remove this barrier
 
04:42:37.040 --> 04:42:38.470 align:start position:0%
and if we remove this barrier
uh

04:42:38.470 --> 04:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:42:41.510 --> 04:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
by eliminating registration in the field
 
04:42:43.030 --> 04:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
we provide better service to the public
 
04:42:44.230 --> 04:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
so please vote for the committee
 
04:42:48.150 --> 04:42:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:49.830 --> 04:42:49.840 align:start position:0%

mr speaker
 
04:44:32.550 --> 04:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
if i know night shift junkies have been
 
04:44:34.628 --> 04:44:34.638 align:start position:0%
discouraged from plaguing new hampshire
 
04:44:37.590 --> 04:44:37.600 align:start position:0%
by the existing registration process
 
04:44:39.270 --> 04:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
and if i know both hospitals and
 
04:44:41.270 --> 04:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
confessed night shift junkies have said
 
04:44:43.750 --> 04:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
the hospital vetting process is totally
 
04:44:45.990 --> 04:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
inadequate to protect the public
 
04:44:48.150 --> 04:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
and if i don't want another massive and
 
04:44:50.390 --> 04:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
expensive outbreak of disease spread by
 
04:44:52.788 --> 04:44:52.798 align:start position:0%
the dirty needles of night shift junkies
 
04:44:55.510 --> 04:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
to affect my friends and neighbors would
 
04:44:57.670 --> 04:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
i not press the red button and defeat
 
04:45:01.590 --> 04:45:01.600 align:start position:0%

that you made a mistake which is
 
04:56:48.788 --> 04:56:48.798 align:start position:0%
completely understandable my question
 
04:56:49.750 --> 04:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
would be
 
04:56:52.948 --> 04:56:52.958 align:start position:0%
that if somebody if before the issue had
 
04:56:55.670 --> 04:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
placed the issue as you had if somebody
 
04:56:58.230 --> 04:56:58.240 align:start position:0%
had said i don't want to have a debate
 
04:57:00.470 --> 04:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
let's just go vote would you have
 
04:57:03.430 --> 04:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
allowed them to do that
 
04:57:05.910 --> 04:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
all parties would have to agree
 
04:57:08.868 --> 04:57:08.878 align:start position:0%
so doesn't that suggest to the body that
 
04:57:11.030 --> 04:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
the request that was
 
04:57:13.510 --> 04:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
was made by the by the speaker should be
 
04:57:15.750 --> 04:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
granted that we should allow this to be
 
04:57:15.760 --> 04:57:19.110 align:start position:0%
granted that we should allow this to be
redone

04:57:19.110 --> 04:57:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:20.708 --> 04:57:20.718 align:start position:0%
i i appreciate you backing me up that's
 
04:57:22.628 --> 04:57:22.638 align:start position:0%
not a real parliamentary inquiry though
 
04:57:22.638 --> 04:57:34.310 align:start position:0%
not a real parliamentary inquiry though
thanks

04:57:34.310 --> 04:57:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:36.470 --> 04:57:36.480 align:start position:0%

i said the house will be in order we're
 
05:03:15.110 --> 05:03:15.120 align:start position:0%
finally getting to a debate that was
 
05:03:16.868 --> 05:03:16.878 align:start position:0%
delayed by
 
05:03:19.270 --> 05:03:19.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of stuff
 
05:03:24.550 --> 05:03:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:27.190 --> 05:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
the member from rye representative grota
 
05:03:28.788 --> 05:03:28.798 align:start position:0%
is recognized to speak against the
 
05:03:30.708 --> 05:03:30.718 align:start position:0%
committee report
 
05:03:38.310 --> 05:03:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:41.910 --> 05:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:44.150 --> 05:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
in edna we hold hearings on bills
 
05:03:44.160 --> 05:03:45.910 align:start position:0%
in edna we hold hearings on bills
regarding

05:03:45.910 --> 05:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
05:03:48.628 --> 05:03:48.638 align:start position:0%
honoring specific events and causes on
 
05:03:52.390 --> 05:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
first glance house bill 1537 appears to
 
05:03:54.868 --> 05:03:54.878 align:start position:0%
be such a bill
 
05:03:57.750 --> 05:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
and as you know those bills that come to
 
05:04:00.628 --> 05:04:00.638 align:start position:0%
this house from the edna committee
 
05:04:03.670 --> 05:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
often come with an itl
 
05:04:06.150 --> 05:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
motion because among it is an agreement
 
05:04:08.550 --> 05:04:08.560 align:start position:0%
among the members of the committee that
 
05:04:10.310 --> 05:04:10.320 align:start position:0%
there are more productive options for
 
05:04:12.390 --> 05:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
these requests
 
05:04:13.868 --> 05:04:13.878 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
05:04:17.190 --> 05:04:17.200 align:start position:0%
513-57 on land acknowledgement
 
05:04:18.948 --> 05:04:18.958 align:start position:0%
asks for no
 
05:04:21.510 --> 05:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
commemoration or fanfare
 
05:04:25.030 --> 05:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
and this is not a simple bill
 
05:04:27.510 --> 05:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
the subject diver deserves much more
 
05:04:29.670 --> 05:04:29.680 align:start position:0%
than a quick look
 
05:04:31.750 --> 05:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
05:04:33.670 --> 05:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
recognizes that before there was new
 
05:04:33.680 --> 05:04:35.190 align:start position:0%

05:04:38.390 --> 05:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
there was a land called andakana
 
05:04:41.110 --> 05:04:41.120 align:start position:0%
and that the abernathy penacook and

this land had the same mountains rivers
 
05:04:54.390 --> 05:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
streams and forests
 
05:04:57.350 --> 05:04:57.360 align:start position:0%

many people
 
05:05:08.550 --> 05:05:08.560 align:start position:0%
and its history is important
 
05:05:10.470 --> 05:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
regardless of who lived here or who
 
05:05:13.030 --> 05:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
lives here today the natural beauty of
 
05:05:15.910 --> 05:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
our state remains and is and is
 
05:05:18.390 --> 05:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
protected and is protected
 
05:05:21.110 --> 05:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
and is why many of us are here in this
 
05:05:21.120 --> 05:05:22.470 align:start position:0%
and is why many of us are here in this
house

05:05:22.470 --> 05:05:22.480 align:start position:0%
house
 
05:05:25.270 --> 05:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
i ask you to join me in overturning the
 
05:05:28.948 --> 05:05:28.958 align:start position:0%
itl motion by voting red so that another
 
05:05:34.310 --> 05:05:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:35.830 --> 05:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
the member from hudson representative
 
05:05:37.750 --> 05:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
tony lakers is recognized to speak for
 
05:05:51.670 --> 05:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:53.990 --> 05:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:05:58.628 --> 05:05:58.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:01.350 --> 05:06:01.360 align:start position:0%
so this bill would amend rsa1 concerning
 
05:06:02.470 --> 05:06:02.480 align:start position:0%
the boundaries of the state of new
 
05:06:04.628 --> 05:06:04.638 align:start position:0%
hampshire to acknowledge that there were
 
05:06:07.430 --> 05:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
people here before us which is
 
05:06:09.350 --> 05:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
not disputable
 
05:06:09.360 --> 05:06:11.590 align:start position:0%
not disputable
um

05:06:11.590 --> 05:06:11.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:13.190 --> 05:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
and while we're sure the sponsors of the
 
05:06:15.110 --> 05:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
bill intended it just be a respectful
 
05:06:16.390 --> 05:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement of the people who are
 
05:06:17.750 --> 05:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
here before us
 
05:06:19.190 --> 05:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
and to keep the people in new hampshire
 
05:06:20.948 --> 05:06:20.958 align:start position:0%
aware of that history
 
05:06:22.550 --> 05:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
there is concern about how that
 
05:06:23.990 --> 05:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement might be construed in
 
05:06:26.150 --> 05:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
the future while we understand the
 
05:06:28.150 --> 05:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
sponsors and most of the supporters do
 
05:06:30.230 --> 05:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
not intend this acknowledgement to
 
05:06:32.550 --> 05:06:32.560 align:start position:0%
support possible land claims
 
05:06:34.150 --> 05:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
we must always be aware of possible
 
05:06:37.350 --> 05:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences of legislation
 
05:06:38.868 --> 05:06:38.878 align:start position:0%
the statute created by the current
 
05:06:40.868 --> 05:06:40.878 align:start position:0%
legislation will likely persist for many
 
05:06:43.430 --> 05:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
years i mean it's rsa one which defines
 
05:06:45.990 --> 05:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
the boundaries of this state
 
05:06:49.270 --> 05:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
and even during our
 
05:06:50.788 --> 05:06:50.798 align:start position:0%
committee hearing
 
05:06:53.190 --> 05:06:53.200 align:start position:0%
we had at least one person who testified
 
05:06:54.550 --> 05:06:54.560 align:start position:0%
and and uh
 
05:06:56.628 --> 05:06:56.638 align:start position:0%
talked about restorative justice in the
 
05:06:59.190 --> 05:06:59.200 align:start position:0%
context of this bill which was
 
05:06:59.200 --> 05:07:00.948 align:start position:0%
context of this bill which was
concerning

05:07:00.948 --> 05:07:00.958 align:start position:0%
concerning
 
05:07:03.910 --> 05:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
and the other thing is we got uh

thank you mr speaker

mr speaker i'd first like to commend the
 
05:21:28.070 --> 05:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
collaborative work with the attorney
 
05:21:29.990 --> 05:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
general the victim's attorney and
 
05:21:32.868 --> 05:21:32.878 align:start position:0%
especially the finance committee
 
05:21:34.948 --> 05:21:34.958 align:start position:0%
i was quite impressed on the
 
05:21:34.958 --> 05:21:36.150 align:start position:0%
i was quite impressed on the
collaborative

05:21:36.150 --> 05:21:36.160 align:start position:0%
collaborative
 
05:21:38.548 --> 05:21:38.558 align:start position:0%
work that they had done uh
 
05:21:41.030 --> 05:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
towards us this bill
 
05:21:44.628 --> 05:21:44.638 align:start position:0%
this amendment adds emotional abuse i
 
05:21:46.150 --> 05:21:46.160 align:start position:0%
i believe new hampshire has an
 
05:21:47.350 --> 05:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity in addressing all
 
05:21:49.830 --> 05:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
victimization done at the hands of our
 
05:21:52.230 --> 05:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
facilities especially at minimum through
 
05:21:55.190 --> 05:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
house bill 1677's process
 
05:21:57.350 --> 05:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
all victims retain their right to choose
 
05:21:59.830 --> 05:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
the court process however this process
 
05:22:02.070 --> 05:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
ought to be available to all victims who
 
05:22:03.750 --> 05:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
choose so
 
05:22:05.990 --> 05:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
although the appropriation is an
 
05:22:09.510 --> 05:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
extremely large allocation
 
05:22:11.510 --> 05:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
i'm reminded of the tax dollars that
 
05:22:14.310 --> 05:22:14.320 align:start position:0%
went towards perpetration of these acts
 
05:22:17.270 --> 05:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
so i ask that you support
 
05:22:19.350 --> 05:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
the victims
 
05:22:20.868 --> 05:22:20.878 align:start position:0%
the victims of
 
05:22:23.990 --> 05:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
in in this situation and we add all
 
05:22:24.000 --> 05:22:25.110 align:start position:0%
in in this situation and we add all
victims

05:22:25.110 --> 05:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
victims
 
05:22:27.110 --> 05:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to go through this
 
05:22:27.120 --> 05:22:28.310 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to go through this
process

05:22:28.310 --> 05:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
process
 
05:22:33.270 --> 05:22:33.280 align:start position:0%

i
 
05:22:41.270 --> 05:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
i'd like you to understand just a little
 
05:22:44.708 --> 05:22:44.718 align:start position:0%
bit of the process that got us here the
 
05:22:47.270 --> 05:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
for the first time in decades the state
 
05:22:49.110 --> 05:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire has stood up to the
 
05:22:50.548 --> 05:22:50.558 align:start position:0%
plate and said
 
05:22:52.948 --> 05:22:52.958 align:start position:0%
we are responsible and we are going to
 
05:22:55.590 --> 05:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
be accountable for righting the wrongs
 
05:22:58.628 --> 05:22:58.638 align:start position:0%
of many many decades where
 
05:23:01.030 --> 05:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
kids that have been incarcerated in the
 
05:23:03.430 --> 05:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
youth development centers
 
05:23:04.470 --> 05:23:04.480 align:start position:0%
have been
 
05:23:07.990 --> 05:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
warehoused to in a way in which
 
05:23:10.708 --> 05:23:10.718 align:start position:0%
physical and sexual abuse seems to have
 
05:23:10.718 --> 05:23:11.590 align:start position:0%
physical and sexual abuse seems to have
been

05:23:11.590 --> 05:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
been
 
05:23:13.830 --> 05:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
fairly cur common
 
05:23:15.670 --> 05:23:15.680 align:start position:0%
and and too much of a part of the
 
05:23:17.030 --> 05:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
culture that's what i'm hearing
 
05:23:19.590 --> 05:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
anecdotally don't admit that into court
 
05:23:21.990 --> 05:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
but that's what i understand
 
05:23:23.110 --> 05:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
and so
 
05:23:25.430 --> 05:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
what the a.g has done is
 
05:23:28.070 --> 05:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
he and his office have set up
 
05:23:30.708 --> 05:23:30.718 align:start position:0%
a settlement fund so that we can
 
05:23:33.350 --> 05:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
efficiently process
 
05:23:35.830 --> 05:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
hundreds of claims
 
05:23:35.840 --> 05:23:36.788 align:start position:0%
hundreds of claims
and

05:23:36.788 --> 05:23:36.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:23:40.868 --> 05:23:40.878 align:start position:0%
the key claims that we must address are
 
05:23:42.310 --> 05:23:42.320 align:start position:0%
the sexual
 
05:23:45.030 --> 05:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
and physical abuse
 
05:23:47.910 --> 05:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
like any project this is a this is a new
 
05:23:47.920 --> 05:23:49.510 align:start position:0%
like any project this is a this is a new
project

05:23:49.510 --> 05:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
project
 
05:23:51.110 --> 05:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
the biggest thing you need to worry
 
05:23:53.910 --> 05:23:53.920 align:start position:0%
about is scope creep if you make the
 
05:23:55.590 --> 05:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
scope too big
 
05:23:57.830 --> 05:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
your project's going to fail
 
05:24:00.150 --> 05:24:00.160 align:start position:0%
and so with a lot of thought
 
05:24:03.030 --> 05:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
we and and debate we
 
05:24:04.708 --> 05:24:04.718 align:start position:0%
are not
 
05:24:06.788 --> 05:24:06.798 align:start position:0%
we don't want the emotional abuse
 
05:24:09.350 --> 05:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
included in this bill which is what this
 
05:24:10.948 --> 05:24:10.958 align:start position:0%
amendment does
 
05:24:13.030 --> 05:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
because first of all emotional abuse is
 
05:24:16.070 --> 05:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
very tough i think to adjudicate i think
 
05:24:17.430 --> 05:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
just the mere fact that you're
 
05:24:17.440 --> 05:24:19.270 align:start position:0%
just the mere fact that you're
incarcerated

05:24:19.270 --> 05:24:19.280 align:start position:0%
incarcerated
 
05:24:22.070 --> 05:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
legitimately would
 
05:24:24.150 --> 05:24:24.160 align:start position:0%
feel like emotional abuse
 
05:24:26.868 --> 05:24:26.878 align:start position:0%
and because it's it's it's messy and it
 
05:24:28.230 --> 05:24:28.240 align:start position:0%
would open up
 
05:24:31.190 --> 05:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
uh the settlement fund to
 
05:24:32.390 --> 05:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
a a
 
05:24:34.390 --> 05:24:34.400 align:start position:0%
scope creep that is
 
05:24:37.670 --> 05:24:37.680 align:start position:0%
beyond what we're ready to do initially
 
05:24:40.070 --> 05:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
and we may never get to that but
 
05:24:41.430 --> 05:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
don't think
 
05:24:42.708 --> 05:24:42.718 align:start position:0%
for a moment
 
05:24:44.708 --> 05:24:44.718 align:start position:0%
that those kids who thought that they
 
05:24:47.030 --> 05:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
were emotionally abused don't have
 
05:24:50.150 --> 05:24:50.160 align:start position:0%
recourse there's always been a method
 
05:24:53.110 --> 05:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
for them to file a complaint with the ag
 
05:24:55.510 --> 05:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
and to have it adjudicated and that's
 
05:24:58.628 --> 05:24:58.638 align:start position:0%
that avenue remains open to them what
 
05:25:00.628 --> 05:25:00.638 align:start position:0%
we've done is we've set up a settlement
 
05:25:04.948 --> 05:25:04.958 align:start position:0%
fund to officially process a large large
 
05:25:07.990 --> 05:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
number of cases and i'd ask you to vote
 
05:25:10.788 --> 05:25:10.798 align:start position:0%
against this amendment so that we can
 
05:25:13.510 --> 05:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
allow the attorney general to focus on
 
05:25:15.350 --> 05:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
the most egregious
 
05:25:15.360 --> 05:25:16.390 align:start position:0%
the most egregious
claims

05:25:16.390 --> 05:25:16.400 align:start position:0%
claims
 
05:25:19.430 --> 05:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
and get them handled as expeditiously as
 
05:25:21.670 --> 05:25:21.680 align:start position:0%
possible thank you is the member yield
 
05:25:25.030 --> 05:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:28.788 --> 05:25:28.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:30.830 --> 05:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
i i
 
05:25:32.548 --> 05:25:32.558 align:start position:0%
represent i respect the representative
 
05:25:34.628 --> 05:25:34.638 align:start position:0%
i'll take her question
 
05:25:36.150 --> 05:25:36.160 align:start position:0%
member may inquire
 
05:25:39.990 --> 05:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:41.350 --> 05:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
thank you so much representative for
 
05:25:43.910 --> 05:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question are you saying that
 
05:25:47.030 --> 05:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
um watching a child
 
05:25:48.948 --> 05:25:48.958 align:start position:0%
get raped by
 
05:25:52.948 --> 05:25:52.958 align:start position:0%
a facilitator that facilitates this is
 
05:25:55.670 --> 05:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
is less important and and should get
 
05:25:58.390 --> 05:25:58.400 align:start position:0%
less rewards of damages than the one
 
05:25:59.990 --> 05:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
that's actually doing the raping and is
 
05:26:02.390 --> 05:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
getting threatened to
 
05:26:04.868 --> 05:26:04.878 align:start position:0%
then be raped if they tell anybody
 
05:26:07.750 --> 05:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
so i thank you for the question and i i
 
05:26:09.910 --> 05:26:09.920 align:start position:0%
understand your concern to be
 
05:26:12.070 --> 05:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
whether or not rape would be included
 
05:26:14.470 --> 05:26:14.480 align:start position:0%
i'd say rape is part of the sexual
 
05:26:17.590 --> 05:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
assault and that and that's clearly the
 
05:26:20.230 --> 05:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
major reason we're doing this is to
 
05:26:20.240 --> 05:26:21.430 align:start position:0%
major reason we're doing this is to
um

05:26:21.430 --> 05:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:24.788 --> 05:26:24.798 align:start position:0%
adjudicate and and pay out and try to uh

with the rape

05:26:35.910 --> 05:26:35.920 align:start position:0%
question and i think we're done

house bill 1677 is amended is a great
 
05:32:20.480 --> 05:32:23.910 align:start position:0%
house bill 1677 is amended is a great
start

05:32:23.910 --> 05:32:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:23.920 --> 05:32:25.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:32:25.110 --> 05:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:32:25.120 --> 05:32:26.070 align:start position:0%
okay
but

05:32:26.070 --> 05:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:32:28.310 --> 05:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
we can act now to make it an even more
 
05:32:29.910 --> 05:32:29.920 align:start position:0%
effective response to a critical
 
05:32:29.920 --> 05:32:31.350 align:start position:0%
effective response to a critical
situation

05:32:31.350 --> 05:32:31.360 align:start position:0%
situation
 
05:32:34.948 --> 05:32:34.958 align:start position:0%
amendment 1022h will help to do that
 
05:32:36.548 --> 05:32:36.558 align:start position:0%
according to the department of children
 
05:32:39.670 --> 05:32:39.680 align:start position:0%
and family services director from 1990
 
05:32:40.948 --> 05:32:40.958 align:start position:0%
to the present
 
05:32:43.110 --> 05:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
four thousand seven hundred and seventy
 
05:32:45.670 --> 05:32:45.680 align:start position:0%
six children were housed at the sununu
 
05:32:48.470 --> 05:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
youth center and its predecessor
 
05:32:49.750 --> 05:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
they've already there have already been
 
05:32:52.708 --> 05:32:52.718 align:start position:0%
close to 500 cases of abuse filed in the
 
05:32:52.718 --> 05:32:53.670 align:start position:0%
close to 500 cases of abuse filed in the
courts

05:32:53.670 --> 05:32:53.680 align:start position:0%
courts
 
05:32:55.990 --> 05:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
and that number could increase
 
05:32:57.990 --> 05:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
as a former county attorney this
 
05:33:01.430 --> 05:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
situation resonates with me it's clear
 
05:33:03.110 --> 05:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
based on the number of cases filed
 
05:33:05.670 --> 05:33:05.680 align:start position:0%
against the state that the financial cap
 
05:33:07.910 --> 05:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
on settlements in this bill is
 
05:33:11.510 --> 05:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
artificially low at 1.5 million it
 
05:33:14.868 --> 05:33:14.878 align:start position:0%
should be increased to 4.5 million
 
05:33:17.190 --> 05:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
this is a significant increase but
 
05:33:18.948 --> 05:33:18.958 align:start position:0%
there's a cause to do this from a legal
 
05:33:18.958 --> 05:33:20.230 align:start position:0%
there's a cause to do this from a legal
standpoint

05:33:20.230 --> 05:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
standpoint
 
05:33:23.110 --> 05:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
the state by taking complete custody and
 
05:33:25.110 --> 05:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
control of these children had a
 
05:33:28.230 --> 05:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
fiduciary duty to them we promised to
 
05:33:31.190 --> 05:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
provide the highest standard of care
 
05:33:33.750 --> 05:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
if this case goes to civil court
 
05:33:36.150 --> 05:33:36.160 align:start position:0%
all the plaintiffs have to prove by a
 
05:33:38.670 --> 05:33:38.680 align:start position:0%
preponderance of the evidence which is
 
05:33:41.510 --> 05:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
50.1 percent likelihood
 
05:33:43.670 --> 05:33:43.680 align:start position:0%
is that the abuse happened
 
05:33:46.150 --> 05:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
as lawmakers we must be prepared to
 
05:33:48.310 --> 05:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
respond to several judgments against the
 
05:33:50.070 --> 05:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
05:33:51.510 --> 05:33:51.520 align:start position:0%
keep in mind
 
05:33:54.628 --> 05:33:54.638 align:start position:0%
the state has already indicted 12 former
 
05:33:57.990 --> 05:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
employees and promises to indict more
 
05:34:00.150 --> 05:34:00.160 align:start position:0%
these employees account for the abuse of
 
05:34:03.190 --> 05:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
close to one half of the child victims
 
05:34:05.270 --> 05:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
and the state believes it can prove the
 
05:34:07.510 --> 05:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
defendants abuse these kids
 
05:34:10.788 --> 05:34:10.798 align:start position:0%
beyond a reasonable doubt a 98 percent
 
05:34:10.798 --> 05:34:14.150 align:start position:0%
beyond a reasonable doubt a 98 percent
likelihood

05:34:14.150 --> 05:34:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:16.948 --> 05:34:16.958 align:start position:0%
for our purposes this means these cases
 
05:34:19.350 --> 05:34:19.360 align:start position:0%
will either be settled and receive a
 
05:34:21.830 --> 05:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
financial award from this fund that we
 
05:34:25.350 --> 05:34:25.360 align:start position:0%
are creating or the cases go to trial
 
05:34:27.430 --> 05:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
the plaintiffs have several lawyers
 
05:34:29.590 --> 05:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
already committed to working these cases
 
05:34:31.990 --> 05:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the child victims so far
 
05:34:34.948 --> 05:34:34.958 align:start position:0%
the attorney general has won
 
05:34:37.030 --> 05:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
it's entirely possible that if any of
 
05:34:39.270 --> 05:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
these cases or several of these cases go
 
05:34:41.430 --> 05:34:41.440 align:start position:0%
to trial that when jurors hear what
 
05:34:43.350 --> 05:34:43.360 align:start position:0%
happened to these children
 
05:34:45.830 --> 05:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
multi-million dollar verdicts in single
 
05:34:48.150 --> 05:34:48.160 align:start position:0%
cases will result
 
05:34:50.310 --> 05:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
it's critical to note some of the cases
 
05:34:52.628 --> 05:34:52.638 align:start position:0%
in federal court in recent years
 
05:34:55.110 --> 05:34:55.120 align:start position:0%
exceeded 20 million dollars even for
 
05:34:58.948 --> 05:34:58.958 align:start position:0%
incidences less brutal than child rape
 
05:35:01.430 --> 05:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
the federal court draws from a similar
 
05:35:03.990 --> 05:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
jury pool as our state superior court in
 
05:35:05.830 --> 05:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
merrimack county where these cases would
 
05:35:07.110 --> 05:35:07.120 align:start position:0%
be heard
 
05:35:09.590 --> 05:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
you have to anticipate the same jury
 
05:35:12.470 --> 05:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
pool will yield similar outcomes
 
05:35:14.390 --> 05:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
it's in the state's best financial
 
05:35:16.788 --> 05:35:16.798 align:start position:0%
interest to agree to a process that will
 
05:35:19.990 --> 05:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
resolve all or almost all of these child

possible
 
05:35:25.590 --> 05:35:25.600 align:start position:0%
with as little additional trauma to the

victims as possible
 
05:35:30.310 --> 05:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
after all it's the right thing to do
 
05:35:33.110 --> 05:35:33.120 align:start position:0%
amendment 1022h expands the cap on
 
05:35:35.910 --> 05:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
settlements to 4.5 million a more
 
05:35:38.470 --> 05:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
realistic cap on settlement amounts
 
05:35:40.708 --> 05:35:40.718 align:start position:0%
if we want the plaintiffs to come to the
 
05:35:42.948 --> 05:35:42.958 align:start position:0%
table with their claims and avoid going
 
05:35:45.590 --> 05:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
to civil court where 10 million or
 
05:35:47.830 --> 05:35:47.840 align:start position:0%
higher dollar claims could result we
 
05:35:50.310 --> 05:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
must be realistic about the logical and
 
05:35:52.310 --> 05:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
likely financial risks
 
05:35:54.310 --> 05:35:54.320 align:start position:0%
we should increase the cap the state is
 
05:35:56.310 --> 05:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
willing to award in this process
 
05:35:58.230 --> 05:35:58.240 align:start position:0%
i ask that you join me
 
05:36:00.310 --> 05:36:00.320 align:start position:0%

these caps were set
 
05:36:51.430 --> 05:36:51.440 align:start position:0%
as a result of the ag
 
05:36:54.150 --> 05:36:54.160 align:start position:0%
looking out across the country
 
05:36:54.160 --> 05:36:55.190 align:start position:0%
looking out across the country
for

05:36:55.190 --> 05:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:36:58.390 --> 05:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
what settlements were out there
 
05:36:58.400 --> 05:37:00.150 align:start position:0%
what settlements were out there
for

05:37:00.150 --> 05:37:00.160 align:start position:0%

sexual abuse
 
05:37:05.270 --> 05:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
and physical abuse
 
05:37:07.510 --> 05:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
and that was the number
 
05:37:07.520 --> 05:37:10.310 align:start position:0%
and that was the number
that

05:37:10.310 --> 05:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:11.670 --> 05:37:11.680 align:start position:0%
the dollars
 
05:37:16.070 --> 05:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
that the ag came to us with as what was
 
05:37:16.080 --> 05:37:16.868 align:start position:0%
that the ag came to us with as what was
the

05:37:16.868 --> 05:37:16.878 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:37:18.628 --> 05:37:18.638 align:start position:0%
i don't want to call it the average
 
05:37:22.070 --> 05:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
settlement because it wasn't necessarily
 
05:37:24.470 --> 05:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
adding up the figures and coming up with
 
05:37:27.670 --> 05:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
a number it was looking at all of the
 
05:37:30.948 --> 05:37:30.958 align:start position:0%
cases that were out there
 
05:37:30.958 --> 05:37:32.868 align:start position:0%
cases that were out there
now

05:37:32.868 --> 05:37:32.878 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:37:36.788 --> 05:37:36.798 align:start position:0%
as the representative from concord said
 
05:37:40.070 --> 05:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
you don't have to choose the process
 
05:37:41.910 --> 05:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
that we've put together
 
05:37:45.548 --> 05:37:45.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:45.558 --> 05:37:47.270 align:start position:0%
 
1677

05:37:47.270 --> 05:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
1677
 
05:37:51.430 --> 05:37:51.440 align:start position:0%
is designed as a
 
05:37:51.440 --> 05:37:52.788 align:start position:0%
is designed as a
trauma

05:37:52.788 --> 05:37:52.798 align:start position:0%
trauma
 
05:37:55.750 --> 05:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
and victim-centered
 
05:37:55.760 --> 05:37:57.030 align:start position:0%
and victim-centered
process

05:37:57.030 --> 05:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
process
 
05:38:00.310 --> 05:38:00.320 align:start position:0%
as opposed to going to court
 
05:38:04.150 --> 05:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
which is not necessarily
 
05:38:06.868 --> 05:38:06.878 align:start position:0%
a victim or trauma
 
05:38:08.948 --> 05:38:08.958 align:start position:0%
centered thing
 
05:38:08.958 --> 05:38:09.830 align:start position:0%
centered thing
but

05:38:09.830 --> 05:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:38:09.840 --> 05:38:11.270 align:start position:0%
but
this

05:38:11.270 --> 05:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:38:14.628 --> 05:38:14.638 align:start position:0%
the cap that we have put in the bill
 
05:38:17.350 --> 05:38:17.360 align:start position:0%
i believe will actually
 
05:38:17.360 --> 05:38:18.390 align:start position:0%
i believe will actually
solve

05:38:18.390 --> 05:38:18.400 align:start position:0%
solve
 
05:38:20.150 --> 05:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
all of the problems
 
05:38:20.160 --> 05:38:21.270 align:start position:0%
all of the problems
that

05:38:21.270 --> 05:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:38:24.470 --> 05:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
were caused and i would agree
 
05:38:27.510 --> 05:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
that these are absolutely horrible
 
05:38:28.788 --> 05:38:28.798 align:start position:0%
to think
 
05:38:30.868 --> 05:38:30.878 align:start position:0%
that this was going on
 
05:38:32.788 --> 05:38:32.798 align:start position:0%
in our youth centers
 
05:38:35.590 --> 05:38:35.600 align:start position:0%
over a long period of time
 
05:38:35.600 --> 05:38:37.190 align:start position:0%
over a long period of time
and

05:38:37.190 --> 05:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:38:39.270 --> 05:38:39.280 align:start position:0%
it was only recently
 
05:38:41.350 --> 05:38:41.360 align:start position:0%
that the ag
 
05:38:43.190 --> 05:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
in his
 
05:38:46.948 --> 05:38:46.958 align:start position:0%
work discovered the horrific nature of
 
05:38:48.628 --> 05:38:48.638 align:start position:0%
what was going on
 
05:38:52.070 --> 05:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
so i ask that you vote red
 
05:38:55.470 --> 05:38:55.480 align:start position:0%
and keep the caps that are currently in
 
05:38:59.190 --> 05:38:59.200 align:start position:0%
1677 of 1.5 million
 
05:39:03.030 --> 05:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
for sexual abuse and 150 000
 
05:39:07.350 --> 05:39:07.360 align:start position:0%
for fiscal abuse thank you mr speaker
 
05:39:10.070 --> 05:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
the motion before us
 
05:39:13.750 --> 05:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
is on floor amendment 1036 h
 
05:39:15.830 --> 05:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
this is going to be a division vote
 
05:39:39.190 --> 05:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:39.200 --> 05:39:59.030 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:39:59.030 --> 05:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:01.030 --> 05:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
the motion before us
 
05:40:03.990 --> 05:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
is floor amendment 1036-h
 
05:40:06.628 --> 05:40:06.638 align:start position:0%
this is a division vote chair recognizes
 
05:40:08.310 --> 05:40:08.320 align:start position:0%
representative walner for parliamentary
 
05:40:08.320 --> 05:40:13.430 align:start position:0%
representative walner for parliamentary
inquiry

05:40:13.430 --> 05:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:17.190 --> 05:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:19.990 --> 05:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know this amendment will
 
05:40:24.310 --> 05:40:24.320 align:start position:0%
also strengthen this very important bill
 
05:40:26.830 --> 05:40:26.840 align:start position:0%
and if i know the intent of this
 
05:40:29.990 --> 05:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
legislation is to provide an alternative
 
05:40:32.868 --> 05:40:32.878 align:start position:0%
for claimants to settle their cases
 
05:40:35.350 --> 05:40:35.360 align:start position:0%
through the settlement fund process
 
05:40:37.510 --> 05:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
as opposed to taking
 
05:40:40.390 --> 05:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
cases to court which is a must much more
 
05:40:40.400 --> 05:40:42.390 align:start position:0%
cases to court which is a must much more
costly

05:40:42.390 --> 05:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
costly
 
05:40:45.350 --> 05:40:45.360 align:start position:0%
set process for the state and for the
 
05:40:45.360 --> 05:40:46.868 align:start position:0%
set process for the state and for the
victim

05:40:46.868 --> 05:40:46.878 align:start position:0%
victim
 
05:40:48.868 --> 05:40:48.878 align:start position:0%
and if i know
 
05:40:52.150 --> 05:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
that the cap on settlement is too
 
05:40:53.910 --> 05:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
if it is too low
 
05:40:56.548 --> 05:40:56.558 align:start position:0%
claimants will choose court over going
 
05:40:59.030 --> 05:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
through the settlement fund process
 
05:41:01.110 --> 05:41:01.120 align:start position:0%
and if i know this amendment raises the
 
05:41:01.120 --> 05:41:01.990 align:start position:0%
and if i know this amendment raises the
cap

05:41:01.990 --> 05:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
cap
 
05:41:04.310 --> 05:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
to a more realistic level which will
 
05:41:06.628 --> 05:41:06.638 align:start position:0%
encourage claimants to use the
 
05:41:08.390 --> 05:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
settlement process
 
05:41:13.510 --> 05:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:15.350 --> 05:41:15.360 align:start position:0%

05:41:21.670 --> 05:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:23.270 --> 05:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
05:41:24.628 --> 05:41:24.638 align:start position:0%
mr speaker
 
05:41:25.830 --> 05:41:25.840 align:start position:0%
if i know
 
05:41:27.110 --> 05:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
that the attorney general made a
 
05:41:29.510 --> 05:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
thorough study of rewards for sexual
 
05:41:32.628 --> 05:41:32.638 align:start position:0%
abuse attacks on children by authorities
 
05:41:35.830 --> 05:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
and that study led to a proposal
 
05:41:37.910 --> 05:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
to create a settlement fund of 100
 
05:41:40.548 --> 05:41:40.558 align:start position:0%
million dollars to use in a new system
 
05:41:42.708 --> 05:41:42.718 align:start position:0%
to avoid going to court
 
05:41:45.350 --> 05:41:45.360 align:start position:0%
if the damaged parties accepted it and
 
05:41:47.590 --> 05:41:47.600 align:start position:0%
if i further know that the attorney for
 
05:41:50.390 --> 05:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
the approximate 500 litigants kept
 
05:41:52.628 --> 05:41:52.638 align:start position:0%
trying to increase the caps on the
 
05:41:54.548 --> 05:41:54.558 align:start position:0%
settlements offered and if i know that
 
05:41:56.390 --> 05:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
increasing the caps or the allowed
 
05:41:59.350 --> 05:41:59.360 align:start position:0%
damages will make even that huge sum be
 
05:42:01.990 --> 05:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
insufficient would i now press the red
 
05:42:03.910 --> 05:42:03.920 align:start position:0%

05:42:07.350 --> 05:42:07.360 align:start position:0%
unworkable thank you mr speaker

sugar hill mr speaker that's okay it's a
 
05:51:01.510 --> 05:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
long day thank you mr speaker
 
05:51:03.350 --> 05:51:03.360 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know that the best way
 
05:51:05.190 --> 05:51:05.200 align:start position:0%
to protect new hampshire's precious
 
05:51:07.270 --> 05:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
lobster stock especially female
 
05:51:09.670 --> 05:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
egg-bearing lobsters and support
 
05:51:11.190 --> 05:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
economically important lobstering
 
05:51:13.430 --> 05:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
industry in new hampshire is the only
 
05:51:16.548 --> 05:51:16.558 align:start position:0%
way by highly using highly professional
 
05:51:18.390 --> 05:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
career seasoned and easily regulated
 
05:51:19.910 --> 05:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
lobstermen to catch these valuable
 
05:51:22.628 --> 05:51:22.638 align:start position:0%
creatures and if i believe that personal
 
05:51:24.628 --> 05:51:24.638 align:start position:0%
hand catching of lobsters by individual
 
05:51:26.868 --> 05:51:26.878 align:start position:0%
scuba divers with limited experience
 
05:51:28.868 --> 05:51:28.878 align:start position:0%
will complicate the monitoring and
 
05:51:31.110 --> 05:51:31.120 align:start position:0%
regulation process of the already
 
05:51:33.750 --> 05:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
overburdened marine patrol officers of
 
05:51:35.910 --> 05:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
our deer fish and game department and
 
05:51:38.310 --> 05:51:38.320 align:start position:0%
furthermore if i believe that the safety
 
05:51:40.390 --> 05:51:40.400 align:start position:0%
of divers will be diminished as their
 
05:51:42.708 --> 05:51:42.718 align:start position:0%
ability to handcut lobsters will most
 
05:51:44.948 --> 05:51:44.958 align:start position:0%
likely take place where lobster stocks
 
05:51:48.230 --> 05:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
reside therefore creating risk to divers
 
05:51:50.708 --> 05:51:50.718 align:start position:0%
entangling themselves in the nets trap
 
05:51:53.350 --> 05:51:53.360 align:start position:0%
lines and other dangerous gear that our
 
05:51:55.670 --> 05:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
lobster industry uses would i now vote
 
05:51:59.030 --> 05:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
no on house bill one two nine seven so
 
05:52:01.190 --> 05:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
the better motion could be made thank
 
05:52:04.470 --> 05:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:05.910 --> 05:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
do you recognize the representative reid
 
05:52:08.150 --> 05:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
for parliamentary inquiry thank you mr
 
05:52:10.548 --> 05:52:10.558 align:start position:0%
speaker mr speaker if i know that the
 
05:52:13.590 --> 05:52:13.600 align:start position:0%
state directly to our south does allow
 
05:52:15.910 --> 05:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
scuba and free divers to harvest small
 
05:52:18.070 --> 05:52:18.080 align:start position:0%
amounts of lobster for personal use and
 
05:52:20.310 --> 05:52:20.320 align:start position:0%
they have had zero issues with
 
05:52:22.948 --> 05:52:22.958 align:start position:0%
enforcement zero issues with safety and
 
05:52:25.190 --> 05:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
zero issues with conflicts between
 
05:52:28.548 --> 05:52:28.558 align:start position:0%
divers and lobstermen and if i know that
 
05:52:31.190 --> 05:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
none of the usual pro-conservation
 
05:52:33.430 --> 05:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
pro-animal groups opposed this bill at
 
05:52:35.750 --> 05:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
all but in fact the main opposition in
 
05:52:37.830 --> 05:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
committee was a long line of people
 
05:52:39.670 --> 05:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
representing the professional lobster
 
05:52:41.350 --> 05:52:41.360 align:start position:0%
industry who stand to lose the high
 
05:52:43.030 --> 05:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
dollar demand on their product if
 
05:52:45.030 --> 05:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
individuals have access to sustainably
 
05:52:47.190 --> 05:52:47.200 align:start position:0%
harvesting small amounts for personal
 
05:52:50.708 --> 05:52:50.718 align:start position:0%
use as they do with fish and if i know
 
05:52:52.628 --> 05:52:52.638 align:start position:0%
that one of the most preeminent wildlife
 
05:52:54.548 --> 05:52:54.558 align:start position:0%
biologists in the state who almost
 
05:52:56.708 --> 05:52:56.718 align:start position:0%
always is in committee supporting
 
05:52:59.350 --> 05:52:59.360 align:start position:0%
data-based restrictions on take was
 
05:53:01.910 --> 05:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
passionately supportive of this bill and
 
05:53:04.788 --> 05:53:04.798 align:start position:0%

06:07:44.788 --> 06:07:44.798 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
06:07:46.708 --> 06:07:46.718 align:start position:0%
permitting a pharmacist to dispense a
 
06:07:49.110 --> 06:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
medication by a standing order requires
 
06:07:52.150 --> 06:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
a well-evaluated protocol established
 
06:07:54.070 --> 06:07:54.080 align:start position:0%
through a broad consensus of providers
 
06:07:56.548 --> 06:07:56.558 align:start position:0%
and pharmacists using the best available
 
06:07:59.350 --> 06:07:59.360 align:start position:0%
data but a broad consensus supporting
 
06:08:01.670 --> 06:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
the use of ivermectin and covet 19 does
 
06:08:03.030 --> 06:08:03.040 align:start position:0%
not exist
 
06:08:04.390 --> 06:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
the majority report claims that
 
06:08:06.150 --> 06:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
ivermectin has been shown to be helpful
 
06:08:08.548 --> 06:08:08.558 align:start position:0%
in reducing the severity and duration of
 
06:08:11.830 --> 06:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
covet 19. but this is not true
 
06:08:13.190 --> 06:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
there have been numerous studies
 
06:08:15.430 --> 06:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
regarding ivermectin and cobot 19 which
 
06:08:17.590 --> 06:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
sound compelling
 
06:08:19.910 --> 06:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
but upon analysis have design flaws i
 
06:08:21.510 --> 06:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
have personally reviewed many of these
 
06:08:21.520 --> 06:08:22.470 align:start position:0%
have personally reviewed many of these
studies

06:08:22.470 --> 06:08:22.480 align:start position:0%
studies
 
06:08:25.910 --> 06:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
most studies so far are limited by
 
06:08:27.910 --> 06:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
primarily by non-blinding or no
 
06:08:30.070 --> 06:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
randomization but also by two small
 
06:08:32.548 --> 06:08:32.558 align:start position:0%
sample sizes the use of concomitant
 
06:08:35.270 --> 06:08:35.280 align:start position:0%
medications that confound the assessment
 
06:08:36.948 --> 06:08:36.958 align:start position:0%
or poorly defined study groups and
 
06:08:38.390 --> 06:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
outcome measures
 
06:08:41.430 --> 06:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
and even the well-designed studies
 
06:08:43.350 --> 06:08:43.360 align:start position:0%
still have significant limitations such
 
06:08:45.910 --> 06:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
that definitive conclusions regarding
 
06:08:47.990 --> 06:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
the clinical efficacy of ivermectin in
 
06:08:50.628 --> 06:08:50.638 align:start position:0%
the treatment of cova 19 cannot yet be
 
06:08:50.638 --> 06:08:51.910 align:start position:0%
the treatment of cova 19 cannot yet be
reached

06:08:51.910 --> 06:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
reached
 
06:08:53.670 --> 06:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
this is not
 
06:08:55.750 --> 06:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
an issue of censorship
 
06:08:57.670 --> 06:08:57.680 align:start position:0%
it is simply subjecting these studies to
 
06:09:00.070 --> 06:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
the same robust analysis which must be
 
06:09:02.070 --> 06:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
given to any study
 
06:09:04.470 --> 06:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
internationally recognized independent
 
06:09:06.230 --> 06:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
groups with decades of experience
 
06:09:08.628 --> 06:09:08.638 align:start position:0%
analyzing studies such as the cochrane
 
06:09:10.310 --> 06:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
group have determined that the few
 
06:09:13.510 --> 06:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
studies of high quality which do exist
 
06:09:15.510 --> 06:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
do not support the use of ivermectin for
 
06:09:17.510 --> 06:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
treatment or prevention of covet 19
 
06:09:17.520 --> 06:09:18.868 align:start position:0%
treatment or prevention of covet 19
except

06:09:18.868 --> 06:09:18.878 align:start position:0%
except
 
06:09:23.430 --> 06:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
in ongoing well-designed clinical trials
 
06:09:25.350 --> 06:09:25.360 align:start position:0%
this is not to say that ivermectin is
 
06:09:26.788 --> 06:09:26.798 align:start position:0%
not a good drug
 
06:09:28.708 --> 06:09:28.718 align:start position:0%
it is excellent for the treatment of
 
06:09:30.708 --> 06:09:30.718 align:start position:0%
parasitic worms and has been around for
 
06:09:32.470 --> 06:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
a long time and used well for that
 
06:09:32.480 --> 06:09:33.750 align:start position:0%
a long time and used well for that
purpose

06:09:33.750 --> 06:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
06:09:35.990 --> 06:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
the minority already worked with the
 
06:09:38.390 --> 06:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
majority to allow off-label use of
 
06:09:41.030 --> 06:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
ivermectin so that it can be obtained if
 
06:09:41.040 --> 06:09:42.230 align:start position:0%
ivermectin so that it can be obtained if
desired

06:09:42.230 --> 06:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
desired
 
06:09:44.230 --> 06:09:44.240 align:start position:0%
standing orders with pharmacists should
 
06:09:46.788 --> 06:09:46.798 align:start position:0%
not be used to dispense medications for
 
06:09:48.628 --> 06:09:48.638 align:start position:0%
indications which are not clearly
 
06:09:51.510 --> 06:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
supported by the best available medical
 
06:09:51.520 --> 06:09:52.390 align:start position:0%
supported by the best available medical
evidence

06:09:52.390 --> 06:09:52.400 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
06:09:55.270 --> 06:09:55.280 align:start position:0%
ivory mechton unfortunately at least as
 
06:09:57.750 --> 06:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
of now does not yet reach this level of
 
06:09:59.910 --> 06:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
evidence so please press the red button
 
06:10:02.230 --> 06:10:02.240 align:start position:0%
to vote no so that another motion can be
 
06:10:08.548 --> 06:10:08.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:14.708 --> 06:10:14.718 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker
 
06:10:37.030 --> 06:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
mr speaker this bill is amended would
 
06:10:39.830 --> 06:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
ensure granite staters have access to an

profile better than tylenol
 
06:10:47.510 --> 06:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
a standing order is a prescriptive
 
06:10:49.670 --> 06:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
protocol written by a physician or nurse
 
06:10:52.070 --> 06:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
practitioner that allows a pharmacist to
 
06:10:53.990 --> 06:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
dispense a medication without an
 
06:10:55.910 --> 06:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
individual prescription
 
06:10:58.150 --> 06:10:58.160 align:start position:0%
the prescriber writes a protocol that
 
06:10:59.910 --> 06:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
includes dosage and screening for
 
06:11:02.548 --> 06:11:02.558 align:start position:0%
contraindication the patient receives an
 
06:11:04.310 --> 06:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
information sheet
 
06:11:06.628 --> 06:11:06.638 align:start position:0%
that informs them of adverse effects
 
06:11:09.670 --> 06:11:09.680 align:start position:0%
indications and referral information
 
06:11:11.670 --> 06:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
currently in new hampshire one can go to
 
06:11:13.990 --> 06:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
a pharmacy and ask for hormonal
 
06:11:16.470 --> 06:11:16.480 align:start position:0%
contraceptives and narcan via a standing
 
06:11:16.480 --> 06:11:18.070 align:start position:0%
contraceptives and narcan via a standing
order

06:11:18.070 --> 06:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
order
 
06:11:20.310 --> 06:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
these drugs both carry substantially
 
06:11:22.548 --> 06:11:22.558 align:start position:0%
more risk than ivermectin
 
06:11:24.628 --> 06:11:24.638 align:start position:0%
ivermectin has been used in humans for
 
06:11:28.310 --> 06:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
parasitic infections for over 30 years
 
06:11:32.230 --> 06:11:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:33.910 --> 06:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
effective in reducing severity of
 
06:11:36.070 --> 06:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
symptoms of covid19 and other viral
 
06:11:37.910 --> 06:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
illnesses is one reason people are
 
06:11:40.310 --> 06:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
willing to go to great lengths to obtain
 
06:11:40.320 --> 06:11:41.510 align:start position:0%
willing to go to great lengths to obtain
it

06:11:41.510 --> 06:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:11:43.510 --> 06:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
from purchasing abroad to purchasing
 
06:11:46.230 --> 06:11:46.240 align:start position:0%
ivermectin formulated for animals people
 
06:11:47.990 --> 06:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
will do what they need to do to get
 
06:11:49.990 --> 06:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
their hands on this drug
 
06:11:52.230 --> 06:11:52.240 align:start position:0%
when they are their loved ones are sick
 
06:11:54.390 --> 06:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
they'll do what they have to
 
06:11:56.548 --> 06:11:56.558 align:start position:0%
another reason is that unfortunately
 
06:11:58.230 --> 06:11:58.240 align:start position:0%
medicine is becoming increasingly
 
06:11:58.240 --> 06:11:59.590 align:start position:0%
medicine is becoming increasingly
politicized

06:11:59.590 --> 06:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
politicized
 
06:12:03.190 --> 06:12:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:05.350 --> 06:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
consensus on the best protocol for
 
06:12:07.830 --> 06:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
ivermectin but we do have many

because of this politicization doctors

are afraid to prescribe and pharmacies

are afraid to dispense
 
06:12:23.670 --> 06:12:23.680 align:start position:0%

claim it's because it could save lives
 
06:13:01.990 --> 06:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
ivermectin has had over 30 years of
 
06:13:04.548 --> 06:13:04.558 align:start position:0%
study showing that it is safe
 
06:13:06.470 --> 06:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
and more and more evidence is surfacing
 
06:13:09.030 --> 06:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
that it is effective permitting it to be
 
06:13:11.430 --> 06:13:11.440 align:start position:0%

06:14:18.868 --> 06:14:18.878 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker if i know that
 
06:14:20.628 --> 06:14:20.638 align:start position:0%
permitting a pharmacist to dispense a
 
06:14:22.788 --> 06:14:22.798 align:start position:0%
medication by a standing order requires
 
06:14:24.948 --> 06:14:24.958 align:start position:0%
a well-evaluated protocol
 
06:14:26.788 --> 06:14:26.798 align:start position:0%
established through a broad consensus of
 
06:14:28.628 --> 06:14:28.638 align:start position:0%
providers and pharmacists using the best
 
06:14:31.030 --> 06:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
available data and that the lack of that
 
06:14:33.190 --> 06:14:33.200 align:start position:0%
consensus is not a political issue but
 
06:14:35.990 --> 06:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
because of data which is insufficient in
 
06:14:37.190 --> 06:14:37.200 align:start position:0%
the studies
 
06:14:39.350 --> 06:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
and that only a few have are actually
 
06:14:41.190 --> 06:14:41.200 align:start position:0%
being done at this point a few standing
 
06:14:44.070 --> 06:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
orders and if i know that the fda fda
 
06:14:46.708 --> 06:14:46.718 align:start position:0%
approval is for its indication of
 
06:14:48.708 --> 06:14:48.718 align:start position:0%

06:14:50.868 --> 06:14:50.878 align:start position:0%
not covet 19
 
06:14:52.948 --> 06:14:52.958 align:start position:0%
and if i know that a broad consensus
 
06:14:54.548 --> 06:14:54.558 align:start position:0%
supporting the use of ivermectin and
 
06:14:57.350 --> 06:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
cova 19 does not exist
 
06:14:59.590 --> 06:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
and that ivermectin can be obtained off
 
06:15:01.590 --> 06:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
label once we've finished getting that
 
06:15:03.030 --> 06:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
other bill through
 
06:15:04.868 --> 06:15:04.878 align:start position:0%
would i then press the red button to
 
06:15:06.390 --> 06:15:06.400 align:start position:0%
vote no
 
06:15:08.390 --> 06:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
so that another motion could be brought
 
06:15:11.270 --> 06:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
forward thank you mr speaker
 
06:15:12.788 --> 06:15:12.798 align:start position:0%
do you recognize the remnant mark

thank you mr speaker
 
06:15:22.230 --> 06:15:22.240 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know that ivor mecton is
 
06:15:24.708 --> 06:15:24.718 align:start position:0%
already available over the counter in
 
06:15:26.390 --> 06:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
many countries
 
06:15:29.670 --> 06:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
and if i know that ivermectin is safe
 
06:15:32.150 --> 06:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
safer than some of the over-the-counter
 
06:15:34.548 --> 06:15:34.558 align:start position:0%
medicines we can presently buy here in
 
06:15:36.230 --> 06:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
06:15:38.310 --> 06:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
and if i know that some people unable to
 
06:15:41.430 --> 06:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
get ivermectin over the counter here
 
06:15:43.430 --> 06:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
have been resorting to going to farm
 
06:15:45.590 --> 06:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
stores and getting it as it is
 
06:15:47.990 --> 06:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
formulated for livestock and not for
 
06:15:48.000 --> 06:15:49.190 align:start position:0%
formulated for livestock and not for
people

06:15:49.190 --> 06:15:49.200 align:start position:0%
people
 
06:15:51.270 --> 06:15:51.280 align:start position:0%
and finally if i know that the choice
 
06:15:53.830 --> 06:15:53.840 align:start position:0%
for ever so many people is not the
 
06:15:58.150 --> 06:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
choice of ivermectin or vaccines
 
06:16:00.788 --> 06:16:00.798 align:start position:0%
but ivormectin versus
 
06:16:00.798 --> 06:16:02.310 align:start position:0%
but ivormectin versus
nothing

06:16:02.310 --> 06:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
06:16:04.948 --> 06:16:04.958 align:start position:0%
and while it might not cure you
 
06:16:06.948 --> 06:16:06.958 align:start position:0%
it's not going to hurt you
 
06:16:09.830 --> 06:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
would i now press the green button to
 
06:16:11.990 --> 06:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
give new hampshire people this freedom
 
06:16:16.070 --> 06:16:16.080 align:start position:0%

minority of the committee

the chair recognizes
 
06:18:43.190 --> 06:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:45.510 --> 06:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker i rise in support
 
06:18:49.110 --> 06:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
of house bill 1044 and in opposition
 
06:18:52.468 --> 06:18:52.478 align:start position:0%
to the committee recommendation of itl
 
06:18:54.548 --> 06:18:54.558 align:start position:0%
house bill 1044
 
06:18:57.590 --> 06:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
would make a small but meaningful change
 
06:18:59.430 --> 06:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
in our state statute governing the
 
06:19:03.030 --> 06:19:03.040 align:start position:0%
licensure of health care facilities
 
06:19:06.070 --> 06:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
in 2016 this legislature added a
 
06:19:08.310 --> 06:19:08.320 align:start position:0%
provision to that statute
 
06:19:09.910 --> 06:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
requiring that licensed health care
 
06:19:12.948 --> 06:19:12.958 align:start position:0%
facilities must serve all patients
 
06:19:18.548 --> 06:19:18.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:21.030 --> 06:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
house bill 1044 would exempt certain
 
06:19:24.548 --> 06:19:24.558 align:start position:0%
facilities from that provision
 
06:19:26.310 --> 06:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
specifically it would exempt
 
06:19:28.310 --> 06:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
organizations that operate on a
 
06:19:30.708 --> 06:19:30.718 align:start position:0%
membership-based business model
 
06:19:33.030 --> 06:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
or a direct payment business model
 
06:19:34.310 --> 06:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
meaning that
 
06:19:38.070 --> 06:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:40.070 --> 06:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
the key concern raised in the majority
 
06:19:42.390 --> 06:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
committee report
 
06:19:44.868 --> 06:19:44.878 align:start position:0%
is that this bill would have an adverse
 
06:19:48.948 --> 06:19:48.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:51.030 --> 06:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
in fact the provisions in question were
 
06:19:54.230 --> 06:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
added to statute in 2016.
 
06:19:56.310 --> 06:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
we had critical care hospitals before
 
06:19:56.320 --> 06:19:57.430 align:start position:0%
we had critical care hospitals before
that

06:19:57.430 --> 06:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:19:59.590 --> 06:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
and if this bill passes there's no
 
06:20:00.948 --> 06:20:00.958 align:start position:0%
reason to believe we will not have
 
06:20:04.948 --> 06:20:04.958 align:start position:0%
critical care hospitals after that
 
06:20:07.270 --> 06:20:07.280 align:start position:0%
furthermore critical care hospitals are
 
06:20:10.390 --> 06:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
already protected by a 15-mile exclusion
 
06:20:10.400 --> 06:20:12.070 align:start position:0%

06:20:15.110 --> 06:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
preventing the opening of new
 
06:20:19.670 --> 06:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:22.230 --> 06:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
they also receive favorable medicare and
 
06:20:25.190 --> 06:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
medicaid reimbursement rates based on
 
06:20:25.200 --> 06:20:26.548 align:start position:0%

06:20:39.110 --> 06:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
never leads to efficiency
 
06:20:40.230 --> 06:20:40.240 align:start position:0%
it never
 
06:20:40.240 --> 06:20:41.190 align:start position:0%
it never
leads

06:20:41.190 --> 06:20:41.200 align:start position:0%
leads
 
06:20:43.590 --> 06:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
to cost savings
 
06:20:47.270 --> 06:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
and it never spurs innovation
 
06:20:51.110 --> 06:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
free markets do
 
06:20:52.468 --> 06:20:52.478 align:start position:0%
many of you may be old enough to
 
06:20:54.150 --> 06:20:54.160 align:start position:0%
remember when
 
06:20:56.628 --> 06:20:56.638 align:start position:0%
making a long distance phone call
 
06:20:58.788 --> 06:20:58.798 align:start position:0%
was a little bit expensive
 
06:21:00.548 --> 06:21:00.558 align:start position:0%
talking to family members in other
 
06:21:02.150 --> 06:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
states often
 
06:21:04.070 --> 06:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
involved keeping one eye on the clock
 
06:21:07.990 --> 06:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
making sure you weren't talking too long
 
06:21:09.750 --> 06:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
deregulation did wonders for the
 
06:21:13.270 --> 06:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
telecommunications industry
 
06:21:15.110 --> 06:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
it led to better service
 
06:21:16.548 --> 06:21:16.558 align:start position:0%
lower prices
 
06:21:18.948 --> 06:21:18.958 align:start position:0%
more options for consumers
 
06:21:21.670 --> 06:21:21.680 align:start position:0%
and more innovation
 
06:21:24.390 --> 06:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
widespread use of technology embracing
 
06:21:29.430 --> 06:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:31.350 --> 06:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
free market innovation should be allowed
 
06:21:34.868 --> 06:21:34.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:37.190 --> 06:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
this bill would open a modest window of
 
06:21:37.200 --> 06:21:38.468 align:start position:0%
this bill would open a modest window of
opportunity

06:21:38.468 --> 06:21:38.478 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
06:21:40.070 --> 06:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
that will lead
 
06:21:41.910 --> 06:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
to better services
 
06:21:44.948 --> 06:21:44.958 align:start position:0%
lower costs and innovation in our health
 
06:21:46.548 --> 06:21:46.558 align:start position:0%
care system
 
06:21:49.030 --> 06:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
i ask you to please join me in opposing
 
06:21:50.788 --> 06:21:50.798 align:start position:0%
the committee recommendations so that an
 
06:21:52.948 --> 06:21:52.958 align:start position:0%
alternate motion can be brought
 
06:21:58.070 --> 06:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:59.830 --> 06:21:59.840 align:start position:0%

06:22:01.990 --> 06:22:02.000 align:start position:0%

06:22:03.830 --> 06:22:03.840 align:start position:0%

kanerg

06:22:12.628 --> 06:22:12.638 align:start position:0%
kanerg
 
06:22:14.628 --> 06:22:14.638 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
06:22:16.230 --> 06:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
yes currently licensed healthcare
 
06:22:17.990 --> 06:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
facilities are required to provide
 
06:22:20.230 --> 06:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
services to all persons regardless of
 
06:22:21.910 --> 06:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
the source of payment that requirement
 
06:22:25.270 --> 06:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
was added in 2016 by the legislature to
 
06:22:27.990 --> 06:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
ensure access to services for low-income
 
06:22:29.590 --> 06:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
individuals and those covered by
 
06:22:29.600 --> 06:22:31.430 align:start position:0%
individuals and those covered by
medicaid

06:22:31.430 --> 06:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
06:22:33.510 --> 06:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
hb 104 would exempt health care
 
06:22:35.830 --> 06:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
facilities which exclusively provide
 
06:22:39.270 --> 06:22:39.280 align:start position:0%
services on the basis of direct payment
 
06:22:41.030 --> 06:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
from this
 
06:22:43.430 --> 06:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh from this requirement and that's
 
06:22:45.270 --> 06:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
without any reimbursement from a third
 
06:22:45.280 --> 06:22:46.230 align:start position:0%
without any reimbursement from a third
party

06:22:46.230 --> 06:22:46.240 align:start position:0%
party
 
06:22:48.310 --> 06:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
or any insurance and so it actually it's
 
06:22:49.430 --> 06:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
been billed as something to help you
 
06:22:51.830 --> 06:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
with your high deductible but it really
 
06:22:53.750 --> 06:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
won't because that bill has to be sent
 
06:22:55.510 --> 06:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
through the insurance company in order
 
06:22:58.390 --> 06:22:58.400 align:start position:0%
to be credited to your deductible
 
06:23:00.150 --> 06:23:00.160 align:start position:0%
now such a change would allow a small
 
06:23:01.990 --> 06:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
number of for-profit institutions
 
06:23:03.830 --> 06:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
offering urgent care
 
06:23:05.590 --> 06:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
birthing services
 
06:23:08.628 --> 06:23:08.638 align:start position:0%
ambulatory surgery or other services
 
06:23:11.510 --> 06:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
to skim off the high paying patients who
 
06:23:14.070 --> 06:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
can pay the full cash price
 
06:23:15.750 --> 06:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
and that changes the payer mix for
 
06:23:17.590 --> 06:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
remaining hospitals
 
06:23:19.510 --> 06:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
and that 15 mile exclusion doesn't make
 
06:23:22.070 --> 06:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
much difference i live 15 miles from any
 
06:23:25.030 --> 06:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
health care facility maintaining the
 
06:23:27.030 --> 06:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
payer mix is important for those
 
06:23:28.868 --> 06:23:28.878 align:start position:0%
remaining hospitals
 
06:23:31.350 --> 06:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
our critical access hospitals run on
 
06:23:33.350 --> 06:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
razor thin margins
 
06:23:35.750 --> 06:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
and they lose money on services such as
 
06:23:38.070 --> 06:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
the full-service 24-hour per day
 
06:23:41.510 --> 06:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
emergency room and obstetrical services
 
06:23:44.150 --> 06:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
which serve many people on medicaid or
 
06:23:46.628 --> 06:23:46.638 align:start position:0%
with no insurance
 
06:23:49.110 --> 06:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
those services which are critical to
 
06:23:52.070 --> 06:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
have in rural areas are subsidized by
 
06:23:53.990 --> 06:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
the higher paying services
 
06:23:56.390 --> 06:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
and the higher paying insurances
 
06:23:58.070 --> 06:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
skimming off the higher paying patients
 
06:23:59.430 --> 06:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
would have a significant negative
 
06:24:01.350 --> 06:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
economic effect on our critical access
 
06:24:01.360 --> 06:24:02.548 align:start position:0%
economic effect on our critical access
hospitals

06:24:02.548 --> 06:24:02.558 align:start position:0%
hospitals
 
06:24:04.230 --> 06:24:04.240 align:start position:0%
there will be a substantial risk of
 
06:24:06.948 --> 06:24:06.958 align:start position:0%
hospital closure or the need to drop
 
06:24:09.910 --> 06:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
clinical critical clinical services such
 
06:24:13.110 --> 06:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
as maternity and we've seen that happen
 
06:24:14.948 --> 06:24:14.958 align:start position:0%
leaving large numbers of individuals
 
06:24:18.150 --> 06:24:18.160 align:start position:0%
especially in rural areas with no access
 
06:24:20.788 --> 06:24:20.798 align:start position:0%
for timely medical care for emergencies
 
06:24:23.510 --> 06:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
or for child birth
 
06:24:25.030 --> 06:24:25.040 align:start position:0%
and the losses sustained by those
 
06:24:26.628 --> 06:24:26.638 align:start position:0%
facilities will be shifted to those who
 
06:24:27.990 --> 06:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
have insurance
 
06:24:30.628 --> 06:24:30.638 align:start position:0%
driving up the cost for everyone else
 
06:24:33.270 --> 06:24:33.280 align:start position:0%
and not changing that total
 
06:24:35.430 --> 06:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
health care costs
 
06:24:37.430 --> 06:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
the hospitals recognize the threat of
 
06:24:39.110 --> 06:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
this bill to the existence of our
 
06:24:39.120 --> 06:24:40.310 align:start position:0%
this bill to the existence of our
hospitals

06:24:40.310 --> 06:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
hospitals
 
06:24:43.030 --> 06:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
and the need of all the hospitals to
 
06:24:45.430 --> 06:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
share the burdens equally
 
06:24:47.110 --> 06:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire hospital association
 
06:24:49.430 --> 06:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
testified against this bill stating that
 
06:24:52.948 --> 06:24:52.958 align:start position:0%
it will not benefit patients access nor
 
06:24:55.510 --> 06:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
will it improve competition
 
06:24:58.150 --> 06:24:58.160 align:start position:0%
the majority believes that this bill
 
06:25:00.708 --> 06:25:00.718 align:start position:0%
will decrease access to health care and
 
06:25:03.430 --> 06:25:03.440 align:start position:0%
will not drive down the overall cost of
 
06:25:05.270 --> 06:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
health care
 
06:25:06.548 --> 06:25:06.558 align:start position:0%
i also find it interesting that the
 
06:25:08.868 --> 06:25:08.878 align:start position:0%
minority has said that this
 
06:25:10.310 --> 06:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
helps the free market but it's
 
06:25:12.548 --> 06:25:12.558 align:start position:0%
interesting because it only makes this
 
06:25:12.558 --> 06:25:13.910 align:start position:0%
interesting because it only makes this
exemption

06:25:13.910 --> 06:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
06:25:16.390 --> 06:25:16.400 align:start position:0%
for certain business models that's not
 
06:25:17.910 --> 06:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
the free market the free market would
 
06:25:18.948 --> 06:25:18.958 align:start position:0%
not say
 
06:25:20.868 --> 06:25:20.878 align:start position:0%
this group is exempted from this
 
06:25:23.110 --> 06:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
requirement but this group has not
 
06:25:25.510 --> 06:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
that isn't the free market
 
06:25:27.030 --> 06:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
so i would like you to please press the
 
06:25:28.548 --> 06:25:28.558 align:start position:0%
green button to support the committee
 
06:25:30.868 --> 06:25:30.878 align:start position:0%

06:26:25.670 --> 06:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
06:26:27.910 --> 06:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know that our current
 
06:26:29.990 --> 06:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
medical system is broken
 
06:26:31.910 --> 06:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
and patient satisfaction is at an
 
06:26:33.430 --> 06:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
all-time low
 
06:26:35.830 --> 06:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
and if i know that we need alternative
 
06:26:37.990 --> 06:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
options for consumers and health care
 
06:26:38.000 --> 06:26:39.350 align:start position:0%
options for consumers and health care
workers

06:26:39.350 --> 06:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
workers
 
06:26:41.830 --> 06:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
and further if i know that competition
 
06:26:43.750 --> 06:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
and open markets promote the best
 
06:26:46.788 --> 06:26:46.798 align:start position:0%
service at the best prices would i now
 
06:26:49.030 --> 06:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
please press the red button so another
 
06:26:52.070 --> 06:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:53.270 --> 06:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
gee i recognize the representative
 
06:26:55.590 --> 06:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
connerk for parliamentary inquiry thank
 
06:26:57.110 --> 06:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
you mr speaker so if i know that our
 
06:26:59.030 --> 06:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
critical access hospitals run on razor
 
06:27:00.948 --> 06:27:00.958 align:start position:0%
thin margins and they require a payer
 
06:27:02.788 --> 06:27:02.798 align:start position:0%
mix that includes private pay in order
 
06:27:06.310 --> 06:27:06.320 align:start position:0%
to maintain the revenue losing services
 
06:27:09.030 --> 06:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
such as 24-hour full-service
 
06:27:10.628 --> 06:27:10.638 align:start position:0%
emergency rooms and obstructionable
 
06:27:12.628 --> 06:27:12.638 align:start position:0%
services which are critical particularly
 
06:27:14.468 --> 06:27:14.478 align:start position:0%
in our rural areas
 
06:27:16.150 --> 06:27:16.160 align:start position:0%
and if i know that skimming off those
 
06:27:17.590 --> 06:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
higher paying patients would have a
 
06:27:20.150 --> 06:27:20.160 align:start position:0%
significant negative economic impact on
 
06:27:22.868 --> 06:27:22.878 align:start position:0%
our critical access hospitals leading to
 
06:27:22.878 --> 06:27:24.070 align:start position:0%
our critical access hospitals leading to
closures

06:27:24.070 --> 06:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
closures
 
06:27:26.070 --> 06:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
of obstetrical services
 
06:27:29.030 --> 06:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
and of critical access hospitals which
 
06:27:30.948 --> 06:27:30.958 align:start position:0%
are needed to provide timely care in our
 
06:27:32.948 --> 06:27:32.958 align:start position:0%
rural areas
 
06:27:34.310 --> 06:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
and if i know that this bill will
 
06:27:36.708 --> 06:27:36.718 align:start position:0%
decrease access to health care and will
 
06:27:39.670 --> 06:27:39.680 align:start position:0%
not drive down the cost of health care
 
06:27:41.670 --> 06:27:41.680 align:start position:0%
and if i know that this bill
 
06:27:44.548 --> 06:27:44.558 align:start position:0%
is actually thinly veiled protectionism
 
06:27:46.628 --> 06:27:46.638 align:start position:0%
for facilities that use just one
 
06:27:48.230 --> 06:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
business model
 
06:27:49.910 --> 06:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
would i then press the green button to
 
06:27:52.548 --> 06:27:52.558 align:start position:0%
vote yes to support the 14-7 committee
 
06:28:01.830 --> 06:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:03.990 --> 06:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the majority
 
06:28:05.590 --> 06:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
report have been expedient to legislator
 
06:28:07.670 --> 06:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
and house bill 1044
 
06:28:09.910 --> 06:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
this is a roll call vote if you're in
 
06:28:11.350 --> 06:28:11.360 align:start position:0%
favor you'll press the green button if
 
06:28:12.708 --> 06:28:12.718 align:start position:0%
your opposed should press the red button
 
06:28:39.110 --> 06:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:39.120 --> 06:28:46.310 align:start position:0%
 
so

06:28:46.310 --> 06:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:46.320 --> 06:28:54.310 align:start position:0%

06:28:55.510 --> 06:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
do you want to change the outcome of
 
06:28:55.520 --> 06:29:32.230 align:start position:0%
do you want to change the outcome of
this

06:29:32.230 --> 06:29:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:34.390 --> 06:29:34.400 align:start position:0%
how's that
 
06:29:35.750 --> 06:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
if all members president had an
 
06:29:38.548 --> 06:29:38.558 align:start position:0%

06:29:40.390 --> 06:29:40.400 align:start position:0%

06:30:00.548 --> 06:30:00.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:03.510 --> 06:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
the motion fails
 
06:30:05.430 --> 06:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
for what reason did the member rise i
 
06:30:09.590 --> 06:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
move out to pass on hp 1044
 
06:30:19.910 --> 06:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:22.468 --> 06:30:22.478 align:start position:0%
yes sorry with the minority amendment
 
06:30:24.390 --> 06:30:24.400 align:start position:0%

06:30:46.948 --> 06:30:46.958 align:start position:0%
for what reason did this member rise
 
06:30:49.990 --> 06:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
for a motion mr speaker
 
06:30:52.310 --> 06:30:52.320 align:start position:0%

that is a higher motion
 
06:31:00.708 --> 06:31:00.718 align:start position:0%
the motion
 
06:31:03.910 --> 06:31:03.920 align:start position:0%

somebody

06:31:13.270 --> 06:31:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:15.430 --> 06:31:15.440 align:start position:0%
representative blasic requested a roll
 
06:31:17.510 --> 06:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
call that is sufficiently seconded this
 
06:32:08.628 --> 06:32:08.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:10.868 --> 06:32:10.878 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the table house
 
06:32:12.788 --> 06:32:12.798 align:start position:0%
bill 1044
 
06:32:14.948 --> 06:32:14.958 align:start position:0%
this is a roll call vote
 
06:32:16.868 --> 06:32:16.878 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
06:32:22.230 --> 06:32:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:23.910 --> 06:32:23.920 align:start position:0%
mr speaker
 
06:32:25.590 --> 06:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
if i know what i've already said about
 
06:32:27.030 --> 06:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
the fact that this is going to be
 
06:32:30.070 --> 06:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
harmful to our critical access hospitals
 
06:32:32.548 --> 06:32:32.558 align:start position:0%
and while it is true that they
 
06:32:34.948 --> 06:32:34.958 align:start position:0%
did survive prior to this
 
06:32:34.958 --> 06:32:35.750 align:start position:0%
did survive prior to this
uh

06:32:35.750 --> 06:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:32:38.310 --> 06:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
requirement 2016 it's important to know
 
06:32:39.590 --> 06:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
if any of you have been dealing with
 
06:32:41.190 --> 06:32:41.200 align:start position:0%
your hospitals you know
 
06:32:43.190 --> 06:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
that their survival is rather tenuous
 
06:32:45.910 --> 06:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
and a lot of hospitals have closed
 
06:32:47.430 --> 06:32:47.440 align:start position:0%
and if i know that skipping off these
 
06:32:50.390 --> 06:32:50.400 align:start position:0%
higher pay patients would be a problem
 
06:32:51.750 --> 06:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
and that this bill again is a
 
06:32:54.150 --> 06:32:54.160 align:start position:0%
protectionist bill for a small
 
06:32:55.830 --> 06:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
business model
 
06:32:57.430 --> 06:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
and will harm others because they're not
 
06:33:00.548 --> 06:33:00.558 align:start position:0%
subjected to the same
 
06:33:02.868 --> 06:33:02.878 align:start position:0%
suspension then i would would i then
 
06:33:05.510 --> 06:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
vote yes to table this and not go any
 
06:33:05.520 --> 06:33:10.548 align:start position:0%
vote yes to table this and not go any
further

06:33:10.548 --> 06:33:10.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:12.628 --> 06:33:12.638 align:start position:0%
do i recognize representative leon for a
 
06:33:14.868 --> 06:33:14.878 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry
 
06:33:17.190 --> 06:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
06:33:19.030 --> 06:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
if i believe it's wrong to hold some
 
06:33:21.350 --> 06:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
patients captive just so that we can
 
06:33:23.990 --> 06:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
have a certain patient mix
 
06:33:26.548 --> 06:33:26.558 align:start position:0%
and if i believe some patients want more
 
06:33:28.150 --> 06:33:28.160 align:start position:0%
than the allotted time from the
 
06:33:29.750 --> 06:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
insurance companies so that they can
 
06:33:31.670 --> 06:33:31.680 align:start position:0%
more thoroughly discuss their treatment
 
06:33:33.270 --> 06:33:33.280 align:start position:0%
options with their patient with their
 
06:33:33.280 --> 06:33:34.310 align:start position:0%
options with their patient with their
doctor

06:33:34.310 --> 06:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
doctor
 
06:33:37.030 --> 06:33:37.040 align:start position:0%
and come to a decision where they are as
 
06:33:39.270 --> 06:33:39.280 align:start position:0%
the payer are the one in charge
 
06:33:41.350 --> 06:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
would i then press the red button so we

06:45:42.548 --> 06:45:42.558 align:start position:0%
what this bill does
 
06:45:45.430 --> 06:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
is it protects those who do not want to
 
06:45:47.868 --> 06:45:47.878 align:start position:0%
participate in abortions or
 
06:45:50.310 --> 06:45:50.320 align:start position:0%

06:45:55.270 --> 06:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
from any discrimination in the workplace
 
06:45:58.230 --> 06:45:58.240 align:start position:0%
based on that decision
 
06:46:00.948 --> 06:46:00.958 align:start position:0%
it's titled the rights of conscience for
 
06:46:04.070 --> 06:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
medical professionals
 
06:46:04.080 --> 06:46:05.830 align:start position:0%
medical professionals
now

06:46:05.830 --> 06:46:05.840 align:start position:0%
now
 
06:46:07.750 --> 06:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
i believe the rights of conscience
 
06:46:12.070 --> 06:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:12.080 --> 06:46:13.350 align:start position:0%
 
first

06:46:13.350 --> 06:46:13.360 align:start position:0%
first
 
06:46:15.270 --> 06:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
in this case
 
06:46:18.150 --> 06:46:18.160 align:start position:0%
doctors and nurse practitioners already
 
06:46:20.150 --> 06:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
have protection of the
 
06:46:23.030 --> 06:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
ama code of methodologics
 
06:46:26.150 --> 06:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
and most employers
 
06:46:29.670 --> 06:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
make accommodation for those who object
 
06:46:34.868 --> 06:46:34.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:34.878 --> 06:46:37.670 align:start position:0%
 
secondly

06:46:37.670 --> 06:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:39.350 --> 06:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
which means that for those medical
 
06:46:43.110 --> 06:46:43.120 align:start position:0%
professionals the bill is not needed
 
06:46:45.190 --> 06:46:45.200 align:start position:0%
secondly let's look at the terms of the
 
06:46:45.200 --> 06:46:47.590 align:start position:0%
secondly let's look at the terms of the
bill

06:46:47.590 --> 06:46:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:50.230 --> 06:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
the definition of medical professional
 
06:46:52.548 --> 06:46:52.558 align:start position:0%
is so broad
 
06:46:54.948 --> 06:46:54.958 align:start position:0%
that it includes those
 
06:46:54.958 --> 06:46:55.910 align:start position:0%
that it includes those
who

06:46:55.910 --> 06:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
who
 
06:46:55.920 --> 06:46:57.350 align:start position:0%
who
are

06:46:57.350 --> 06:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
are
 
06:46:59.670 --> 06:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
manning the reception desk
 
06:47:01.670 --> 06:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
and those who clean the floor of a
 
06:47:03.430 --> 06:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
surgical suite
 
06:47:07.270 --> 06:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
it's basically everyone who works in any
 
06:47:13.750 --> 06:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:16.628 --> 06:47:16.638 align:start position:0%
the definition is so broad that someone
 
06:47:19.990 --> 06:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
who wanted to act maliciously
 
06:47:22.468 --> 06:47:22.478 align:start position:0%
could seek employment
 
06:47:25.750 --> 06:47:25.760 align:start position:0%
at a reproductive health care center
 
06:47:27.670 --> 06:47:27.680 align:start position:0%
and then
 
06:47:30.230 --> 06:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
be hired and then assert their right of
 
06:47:30.240 --> 06:47:32.230 align:start position:0%
be hired and then assert their right of
conscience

06:47:32.230 --> 06:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
conscience
 
06:47:34.708 --> 06:47:34.718 align:start position:0%
and what would happen then
 
06:47:37.990 --> 06:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
well despite not doing the job for which
 
06:47:39.590 --> 06:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
they were hired
 
06:47:42.230 --> 06:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
they could not be terminated
 
06:47:45.510 --> 06:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
because the bill says that termination
 
06:47:49.190 --> 06:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
constitutes discrimination
 
06:47:51.930 --> 06:47:51.940 align:start position:0%
and what happens if you discriminate
 
06:47:51.940 --> 06:47:53.430 align:start position:0%
and what happens if you discriminate

if
 
06:48:13.190 --> 06:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
the employee
 
06:48:15.510 --> 06:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
was perhaps

asserting the privilege
wrongly

06:48:21.990 --> 06:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:23.830 --> 06:48:23.840 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of burden
 
06:48:29.030 --> 06:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:31.270 --> 06:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
but here's the part that i particularly
 
06:48:34.468 --> 06:48:34.478 align:start position:0%
object to in this bill
 
06:48:37.430 --> 06:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
all persons should have
 
06:48:40.230 --> 06:48:40.240 align:start position:0%
a right to act in accordance with their
 
06:48:40.240 --> 06:48:41.590 align:start position:0%
a right to act in accordance with their
conscience

06:48:41.590 --> 06:48:41.600 align:start position:0%
conscience
 
06:48:44.948 --> 06:48:44.958 align:start position:0%
and sometimes that's difficult
 
06:48:48.390 --> 06:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
people have lost their jobs over it
 
06:48:56.150 --> 06:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:00.628 --> 06:49:00.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:04.310 --> 06:49:04.320 align:start position:0%
and in this case what we are doing is on
 
06:49:07.190 --> 06:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
the one hand we are affording
 
06:49:11.670 --> 06:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
an absolute guaranteed clear
 
06:49:13.990 --> 06:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
easy way
 
06:49:16.468 --> 06:49:16.478 align:start position:0%
for people who believe
 
06:49:16.478 --> 06:49:17.270 align:start position:0%
for people who believe
in

06:49:17.270 --> 06:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:49:19.510 --> 06:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
one course of action
 
06:49:21.190 --> 06:49:21.200 align:start position:0%
to act in accordance with their
 
06:49:21.200 --> 06:49:22.868 align:start position:0%
to act in accordance with their
conscience

06:49:22.868 --> 06:49:22.878 align:start position:0%
conscience
 
06:49:25.590 --> 06:49:25.600 align:start position:0%
they're protected
 
06:49:28.150 --> 06:49:28.160 align:start position:0%
people who believe
 
06:49:31.350 --> 06:49:31.360 align:start position:0%
that as a medical professional as an
 
06:49:33.510 --> 06:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
active conscience
 
06:49:35.830 --> 06:49:35.840 align:start position:0%
they must help
 
06:49:37.670 --> 06:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
a woman who is
 
06:49:39.990 --> 06:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
past 24 weeks
 
06:49:42.468 --> 06:49:42.478 align:start position:0%
of a problem pregnancy
 
06:49:44.868 --> 06:49:44.878 align:start position:0%
who is making the most difficult
 
06:49:48.070 --> 06:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
decision she will ever make in her life
 
06:49:49.750 --> 06:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
with the help of her family and her
 
06:49:52.230 --> 06:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
medical professionals
 
06:49:54.948 --> 06:49:54.958 align:start position:0%
those medical professionals are
 
06:49:58.230 --> 06:49:58.240 align:start position:0%
currently legally forbidden
 
06:50:01.190 --> 06:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
for acting in accordance with their
 
06:50:01.200 --> 06:50:04.150 align:start position:0%
for acting in accordance with their
conscience

06:50:04.150 --> 06:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:04.160 --> 06:50:05.270 align:start position:0%
 
so

06:50:05.270 --> 06:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:50:07.750 --> 06:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
on the one hand we have people whose
 
06:50:10.548 --> 06:50:10.558 align:start position:0%
consciences are protected
 
06:50:13.350 --> 06:50:13.360 align:start position:0%
and on the other hand we have people
 
06:50:15.350 --> 06:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
whose consciences
 
06:50:17.910 --> 06:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
have a legal barrier
 
06:50:19.350 --> 06:50:19.360 align:start position:0%
that is
 
06:50:19.360 --> 06:50:20.948 align:start position:0%
that is
just

06:50:20.948 --> 06:50:20.958 align:start position:0%
just
 
06:50:20.958 --> 06:50:23.990 align:start position:0%
just
wrong

06:50:23.990 --> 06:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:27.190 --> 06:50:27.200 align:start position:0%

06:51:05.190 --> 06:51:05.200 align:start position:0%
conscience is a precious thing
 
06:51:07.030 --> 06:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
i think most of us have seen the
 
06:51:09.830 --> 06:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
documentaries about the unspeakable
 
06:51:12.150 --> 06:51:12.160 align:start position:0%
things that doctors and their staffs
 
06:51:16.628 --> 06:51:16.638 align:start position:0%
were forced forced to do in nazi germany
 
06:51:18.548 --> 06:51:18.558 align:start position:0%
and yet one hears that in numbers of
 
06:51:20.788 --> 06:51:20.798 align:start position:0%
states medical people are forced to
 
06:51:23.750 --> 06:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
participate in a procedure that is they
 
06:51:25.670 --> 06:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
and i understand it
 
06:51:29.590 --> 06:51:29.600 align:start position:0%
is the taking of an innocent human life
 
06:51:31.750 --> 06:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
there are numerous places where abortion
 
06:51:34.310 --> 06:51:34.320 align:start position:0%
is practiced but as a small portion of
 
06:51:36.230 --> 06:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
what is being done
 
06:51:37.990 --> 06:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
this bill would allow persons of
 
06:51:40.788 --> 06:51:40.798 align:start position:0%
conscience in this matter to keep their
 
06:51:44.070 --> 06:51:44.080 align:start position:0%
jobs there not disrupting the facility
 
06:51:45.830 --> 06:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
while allowing the member will suspend
 
06:51:45.840 --> 06:51:49.910 align:start position:0%
while allowing the member will suspend
it

06:51:49.910 --> 06:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:55.030 --> 06:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:56.548 --> 06:51:56.558 align:start position:0%
member may continue
 
06:51:58.468 --> 06:51:58.478 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker this bill would
 
06:52:00.708 --> 06:52:00.718 align:start position:0%
allow persons of conscience in this
 
06:52:00.718 --> 06:52:01.590 align:start position:0%
allow persons of conscience in this
matter

06:52:01.590 --> 06:52:01.600 align:start position:0%
matter
 
06:52:03.350 --> 06:52:03.360 align:start position:0%
to keep their jobs
 
06:52:05.430 --> 06:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
while allowing others to stand in for
 
06:52:08.788 --> 06:52:08.798 align:start position:0%
them in those procedures only
 
06:52:11.350 --> 06:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
i've heard several objections to this
 
06:52:11.360 --> 06:52:12.708 align:start position:0%
i've heard several objections to this
bill

06:52:12.708 --> 06:52:12.718 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:52:15.510 --> 06:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
first these protections are already
 
06:52:17.830 --> 06:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
there in law
 
06:52:19.350 --> 06:52:19.360 align:start position:0%
if that's the case then no one has
 
06:52:21.110 --> 06:52:21.120 align:start position:0%
anything to fear for
 
06:52:23.910 --> 06:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
us making it a bit more explicit do they
 
06:52:25.830 --> 06:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
we're not adding anything we're just
 
06:52:28.310 --> 06:52:28.320 align:start position:0%
making these protections that we're told
 
06:52:30.628 --> 06:52:30.638 align:start position:0%
are already there in the law just a
 
06:52:32.708 --> 06:52:32.718 align:start position:0%
little bit more explicit
 
06:52:34.948 --> 06:52:34.958 align:start position:0%
it's an abundance of caution a phrase
 
06:52:37.190 --> 06:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
we've all been using
 
06:52:39.270 --> 06:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
second we've been told no medical
 
06:52:41.510 --> 06:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
professional in new hampshire has ever
 
06:52:44.868 --> 06:52:44.878 align:start position:0%
been put in job risk for that
 
06:52:48.628 --> 06:52:48.638 align:start position:0%
you have not spoken to the people i have
 
06:52:50.548 --> 06:52:50.558 align:start position:0%
next during the hearing
 
06:52:53.350 --> 06:52:53.360 align:start position:0%
i was asked as prime sponsor of this
 
06:52:56.390 --> 06:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
bill would i be willing to include other
 
06:52:59.150 --> 06:52:59.160 align:start position:0%
medical procedures and other kinds of
 
06:52:59.160 --> 06:53:00.868 align:start position:0%
medical procedures and other kinds of
professions

06:53:00.868 --> 06:53:00.878 align:start position:0%
professions
 
06:53:02.868 --> 06:53:02.878 align:start position:0%
thank you to my colleagues across the
 
06:53:05.670 --> 06:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
aisle for bringing that up my response
 
06:53:07.990 --> 06:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
is over the summer i should be happy to
 
06:53:10.788 --> 06:53:10.798 align:start position:0%
work with my colleagues in my committee
 
06:53:13.590 --> 06:53:13.600 align:start position:0%
who pose these questions so we can file
 
06:53:16.548 --> 06:53:16.558 align:start position:0%
some bipartisan lsrs
 
06:53:16.558 --> 06:53:18.390 align:start position:0%
some bipartisan lsrs
fourth

06:53:18.390 --> 06:53:18.400 align:start position:0%
fourth
 
06:53:20.628 --> 06:53:20.638 align:start position:0%
this bill is signed into law the
 
06:53:20.638 --> 06:53:22.230 align:start position:0%
this bill is signed into law the
objections

06:53:22.230 --> 06:53:22.240 align:start position:0%
objections
 
06:53:22.240 --> 06:53:23.830 align:start position:0%
objections
say

06:53:23.830 --> 06:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
say
 
06:53:25.910 --> 06:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
would lead to a reduction in the number
 
06:53:29.110 --> 06:53:29.120 align:start position:0%
of capable medical people coming to work
 
06:53:31.430 --> 06:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire and thus our
 
06:53:34.230 --> 06:53:34.240 align:start position:0%
quality of care would suffer
 
06:53:37.270 --> 06:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
we should discount such fear-mongering
 
06:53:39.990 --> 06:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
the fact is for many years massachusetts
 
06:53:42.468 --> 06:53:42.478 align:start position:0%
had a bill just like this actually with
 
06:53:45.670 --> 06:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
tougher penalties and yet continued to
 
06:53:48.708 --> 06:53:48.718 align:start position:0%
draw good people to practice medicine
 
06:53:51.590 --> 06:53:51.600 align:start position:0%
and was consistently rated as having one
 
06:53:54.070 --> 06:53:54.080 align:start position:0%
of high quality
 
06:53:56.390 --> 06:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
i discovered that states with laws like
 
06:53:58.468 --> 06:53:58.478 align:start position:0%
the one proposed here
 
06:54:01.030 --> 06:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
have drawn many quite capable pro-life
 
06:54:04.150 --> 06:54:04.160 align:start position:0%
medical staff maybe even we would get
 
06:54:04.160 --> 06:54:05.110 align:start position:0%
medical staff maybe even we would get
better

06:54:05.110 --> 06:54:05.120 align:start position:0%
better
 
06:54:09.190 --> 06:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
for allowing such conscience here
 
06:54:11.350 --> 06:54:11.360 align:start position:0%
and finally it was suggested that an
 
06:54:13.830 --> 06:54:13.840 align:start position:0%
individual might join the staff of a
 
06:54:16.548 --> 06:54:16.558 align:start position:0%
facility where abortion is the main
 
06:54:19.510 --> 06:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
procedure performed and then once their
 
06:54:23.350 --> 06:54:23.360 align:start position:0%
start asserting rights of conscience
 
06:54:25.910 --> 06:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
it does not take much mental acuity to
 
06:54:27.910 --> 06:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
know that no pro-life person would
 
06:54:31.670 --> 06:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
choose to work at such a place
 
06:54:33.750 --> 06:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
i close with a quote
 
06:54:36.230 --> 06:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
about nazi germany
 
06:54:38.310 --> 06:54:38.320 align:start position:0%
made by martin niemoller a german
 
06:54:41.190 --> 06:54:41.200 align:start position:0%

06:58:10.628 --> 06:58:10.638 align:start position:0%
if they're asked to violate their

07:07:12.628 --> 07:07:12.638 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker when this amendment
 
07:07:15.350 --> 07:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
was first crafted it represented
 
07:07:15.360 --> 07:07:16.708 align:start position:0%
was first crafted it represented
knowledge

07:07:16.708 --> 07:07:16.718 align:start position:0%
knowledge
 
07:07:18.548 --> 07:07:18.558 align:start position:0%
that we had
 
07:07:22.230 --> 07:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
having spoken to correctional officials
 
07:07:24.628 --> 07:07:24.638 align:start position:0%
and since then however we have learned
 
07:07:26.788 --> 07:07:26.798 align:start position:0%
that in a few places around the country
 
07:07:29.270 --> 07:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
certain laws have been put in place and
 
07:07:30.708 --> 07:07:30.718 align:start position:0%
with that has come the kind of problems
 
07:07:32.868 --> 07:07:32.878 align:start position:0%
that occur when fixed laws replace
 
07:07:35.590 --> 07:07:35.600 align:start position:0%
flexible policies we want to preserve
 
07:07:37.030 --> 07:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
what we have now in new hampshire with
 
07:07:39.030 --> 07:07:39.040 align:start position:0%
our flexibility because one size does
 
07:07:40.548 --> 07:07:40.558 align:start position:0%
not fit all
 
07:07:43.750 --> 07:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
inadvertently the amendment will weaken
 
07:07:47.110 --> 07:07:47.120 align:start position:0%
this we've just discovered this and so i
 
07:07:50.390 --> 07:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
am strongly suggesting we vote no on
 
07:07:53.510 --> 07:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:55.430 --> 07:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
sam gould has requested roll calls
 
07:08:00.310 --> 07:08:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:04.868 --> 07:08:04.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:07.030 --> 07:08:07.040 align:start position:0%
this will be a division vote
 
07:08:17.830 --> 07:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:17.840 --> 07:08:33.270 align:start position:0%
 
so

07:08:33.270 --> 07:08:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:33.280 --> 07:08:59.590 align:start position:0%
 
so

07:08:59.590 --> 07:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:02.628 --> 07:09:02.638 align:start position:0%
the question before us is the adoption
 
07:09:06.868 --> 07:09:06.878 align:start position:0%
of the amendment zero nine five nine h
 
07:09:08.948 --> 07:09:08.958 align:start position:0%
this is a division vote
 
07:09:11.030 --> 07:09:11.040 align:start position:0%

07:09:29.750 --> 07:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker and pardon me for
 
07:09:32.390 --> 07:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
the confusion once again
 
07:09:35.670 --> 07:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
my pi is if i know
 
07:09:38.628 --> 07:09:38.638 align:start position:0%
that the amendment when we first put it
 
07:09:40.230 --> 07:09:40.240 align:start position:0%
together was brilliant
 
07:09:42.948 --> 07:09:42.958 align:start position:0%
and if i know subsequent knowledge that
 
07:09:45.110 --> 07:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
has come to us have said that this could
 
07:09:46.788 --> 07:09:46.798 align:start position:0%
be counterproductive
 
07:09:48.070 --> 07:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
i would
 
07:09:51.030 --> 07:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
would i not press the red button against
 
07:09:54.788 --> 07:09:54.798 align:start position:0%
the amendment thank you mr speaker
 
07:09:57.110 --> 07:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
the jail recognizes representative gay
 
07:10:00.230 --> 07:10:00.240 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker
 
07:10:05.590 --> 07:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
if i know the goal of this amendment is
 
07:10:08.628 --> 07:10:08.638 align:start position:0%
to protect women's sports
 
07:10:11.030 --> 07:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
and if i know this bill without the
 
07:10:13.750 --> 07:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
amendment could allow carding
 
07:10:16.310 --> 07:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
or blocking trans people from public
 
07:10:16.320 --> 07:10:18.230 align:start position:0%
or blocking trans people from public

bathrooms
 
07:10:20.548 --> 07:10:20.558 align:start position:0%
and if i know this bill without the
 
07:10:23.510 --> 07:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
amendment could also complicate the job
 
07:10:25.990 --> 07:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire corrections
 
07:10:28.310 --> 07:10:28.320 align:start position:0%

are priya as they call it
 
07:10:44.390 --> 07:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
and if i know that women and girls
 
07:10:47.830 --> 07:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
participating in sports with trans women
 
07:10:49.670 --> 07:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
teens and adults
 
07:10:52.628 --> 07:10:52.638 align:start position:0%
deserve to compete against people whose
 
07:10:56.150 --> 07:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
in transition started before they
 
07:10:59.750 --> 07:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
reached male strength as advocated by
 
07:11:01.990 --> 07:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
caitlyn jenner
 
07:11:04.948 --> 07:11:04.958 align:start position:0%

you thought you were through with me
 
07:13:49.830 --> 07:13:49.840 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr speaker
 
07:13:52.230 --> 07:13:52.240 align:start position:0%
i guess they're coming for me
 
07:13:54.708 --> 07:13:54.718 align:start position:0%
so this bill is all about discrimination
 
07:13:56.468 --> 07:13:56.478 align:start position:0%
plain and simple
 
07:13:59.350 --> 07:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
the few transgender children who
 
07:14:01.430 --> 07:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
participate in sports
 
07:14:04.390 --> 07:14:04.400 align:start position:0%
vary in athletic ability size shape and
 
07:14:07.110 --> 07:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
as much as other youth do
 
07:14:07.120 --> 07:14:08.230 align:start position:0%
as much as other youth do
some

07:14:08.230 --> 07:14:08.240 align:start position:0%
some
 
07:14:11.190 --> 07:14:11.200 align:start position:0%
youth have outstanding athletic ability
 
07:14:14.070 --> 07:14:14.080 align:start position:0%
some not so much
 
07:14:16.548 --> 07:14:16.558 align:start position:0%
gender identity shouldn't play a role in
 
07:14:19.190 --> 07:14:19.200 align:start position:0%
the opportunities that we give students
 
07:14:21.350 --> 07:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
in all activities and courses we offer
 
07:14:22.468 --> 07:14:22.478 align:start position:0%
in school
 
07:14:25.510 --> 07:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
including sports
 
07:14:27.590 --> 07:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
there are governing bodies at all level
 
07:14:29.830 --> 07:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
of sports competition that regulates
 
07:14:31.830 --> 07:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
seasons rules
 
07:14:35.590 --> 07:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
and eligibility to participate in sports
 
07:14:37.190 --> 07:14:37.200 align:start position:0%
at our high school level in new
 
07:14:37.200 --> 07:14:38.468 align:start position:0%
at our high school level in new
hampshire

interscholastic athletic association
 
07:14:46.468 --> 07:14:46.478 align:start position:0%
this association that oversees all high

school competition in the state
 
07:14:50.708 --> 07:14:50.718 align:start position:0%
has concluded that it would be
 
07:14:53.270 --> 07:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
fundamentally unjust
 
07:14:55.990 --> 07:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
and contrary to applicable state and
 
07:14:57.670 --> 07:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
federal laws
 
07:15:01.270 --> 07:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
to preclude a student from participation
 
07:15:04.708 --> 07:15:04.718 align:start position:0%
on a gender specific sports team
 
07:15:06.948 --> 07:15:06.958 align:start position:0%
that is consistent with the public
 
07:15:10.468 --> 07:15:10.478 align:start position:0%
gender identity of that student in his
 
07:15:12.548 --> 07:15:12.558 align:start position:0%
his or her school

07:15:18.628 --> 07:15:18.638 align:start position:0%
local schools are charged with verifying
 
07:15:20.468 --> 07:15:20.478 align:start position:0%
that the school district has determined
 
07:15:22.150 --> 07:15:22.160 align:start position:0%
that the expression of the student's
 
07:15:22.160 --> 07:15:23.510 align:start position:0%
that the expression of the student's
gender

07:15:23.510 --> 07:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
gender
 
07:15:26.390 --> 07:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
identity is bona fide and not for the
 
07:15:28.548 --> 07:15:28.558 align:start position:0%
purpose of gaining an unfair advantage
 
07:15:30.948 --> 07:15:30.958 align:start position:0%
in competitive sports
 
07:15:33.670 --> 07:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
if you think a high school boy
 
07:15:35.670 --> 07:15:35.680 align:start position:0%
would put on suddenly put on a skirt and
 
07:15:38.390 --> 07:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
try out for a girls team
 
07:15:40.230 --> 07:15:40.240 align:start position:0%
it doesn't just doesn't happen in high
 
07:15:42.150 --> 07:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
school i taught in high school for 30
 
07:15:42.160 --> 07:15:44.070 align:start position:0%
school i taught in high school for 30
years

07:15:44.070 --> 07:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
years
 
07:15:46.468 --> 07:15:46.478 align:start position:0%
school sports at all levels
 
07:15:48.548 --> 07:15:48.558 align:start position:0%
should be centered on inclusion
 
07:15:51.430 --> 07:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
education and participation
 
07:15:53.110 --> 07:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
there's ample evidence that an
 
07:15:54.708 --> 07:15:54.718 align:start position:0%
opportunity for adolescents to
 
07:15:56.548 --> 07:15:56.558 align:start position:0%
participate in sports
 
07:15:58.708 --> 07:15:58.718 align:start position:0%
results in positive outcomes such as
 
07:16:00.070 --> 07:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
better grades
 
07:16:01.910 --> 07:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
better work in class
 
07:16:01.920 --> 07:16:03.430 align:start position:0%
better work in class
self-discipline

07:16:03.430 --> 07:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
self-discipline
 
07:16:05.750 --> 07:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
higher educational and occupational
 
07:16:09.990 --> 07:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
aspirations and improved self-esteem
 
07:16:12.230 --> 07:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
youth learn a lot of lessons in sports i
 
07:16:14.150 --> 07:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
coached for many years
 
07:16:15.990 --> 07:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
they learned to get better to have a
 
07:16:17.670 --> 07:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
role on a team they learned
 
07:16:20.070 --> 07:16:20.080 align:start position:0%
sportsmanship leadership
 
07:16:21.270 --> 07:16:21.280 align:start position:0%
hard work
 
07:16:24.390 --> 07:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
and they learn to be gracious in winning
 
07:16:26.788 --> 07:16:26.798 align:start position:0%
and to be resilient in the face of
 
07:16:29.110 --> 07:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
defeat which some of us could take a
 
07:16:30.708 --> 07:16:30.718 align:start position:0%
little lesson on
 
07:16:33.270 --> 07:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
um this is all discrimination
 
07:16:37.270 --> 07:16:37.280 align:start position:0%
okay it's not about safety issue
 
07:16:39.350 --> 07:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
i taught for a long time co-ed high
 
07:16:41.270 --> 07:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
school physical education
 
07:16:44.070 --> 07:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
and for over 30 years i had no concerns
 
07:16:45.510 --> 07:16:45.520 align:start position:0%
with safety
 
07:16:48.468 --> 07:16:48.478 align:start position:0%
it's not about co-ed competition
 
07:16:51.030 --> 07:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
we had co-ed competition in in
 
07:16:52.788 --> 07:16:52.798 align:start position:0%
classes and
 
07:16:54.788 --> 07:16:54.798 align:start position:0%
there were as many girls that did well
 
07:16:56.388 --> 07:16:56.398 align:start position:0%
as boys
 
07:16:58.628 --> 07:16:58.638 align:start position:0%
it's not about fairness which is an
 
07:17:00.230 --> 07:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
elusive term when your tallest
 
07:17:01.830 --> 07:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
basketball player
 
07:17:03.910 --> 07:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
on my team was five four and the other
 
07:17:06.468 --> 07:17:06.478 align:start position:0%
team had a six foot center
 
07:17:08.230 --> 07:17:08.240 align:start position:0%
because there will be differences and
 
07:17:10.388 --> 07:17:10.398 align:start position:0%
not related to gender
 
07:17:12.548 --> 07:17:12.558 align:start position:0%
identity it's not about winning and
 
07:17:12.558 --> 07:17:13.830 align:start position:0%
identity it's not about winning and
losing

07:17:13.830 --> 07:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
losing
 
07:17:16.230 --> 07:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
because eventually you meet some team or
 
07:17:18.230 --> 07:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
person who will be better than you
 
07:17:22.788 --> 07:17:22.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:25.430 --> 07:17:25.440 align:start position:0%
ncaa and the olympic committee where
 
07:17:27.830 --> 07:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
competition is a little bit higher
 
07:17:30.868 --> 07:17:30.878 align:start position:0%
have other rules and regulations but
 
07:17:33.110 --> 07:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
they also let transgender
 
07:17:33.120 --> 07:17:33.990 align:start position:0%
they also let transgender
people

07:17:33.990 --> 07:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
people
 
07:17:37.750 --> 07:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
identify and play in sports
 
07:17:40.548 --> 07:17:40.558 align:start position:0%
as it so this bill is giving permission
 
07:17:43.030 --> 07:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
to schools and governmental agencies
 
07:17:45.830 --> 07:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
this bill to deny a young person the
 
07:17:48.388 --> 07:17:48.398 align:start position:0%
ability to participate based on their
 
07:17:51.590 --> 07:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
gender identity their authentic self
 
07:17:53.350 --> 07:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
who they think they are
 
07:17:54.868 --> 07:17:54.878 align:start position:0%
how they feel
 
07:17:57.430 --> 07:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
and that is wrong to deny that
 
07:18:00.070 --> 07:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
as a country as new hampshire we have
 
07:18:00.080 --> 07:18:00.868 align:start position:0%
as a country as new hampshire we have
made

07:18:00.868 --> 07:18:00.878 align:start position:0%
made
 
07:18:00.878 --> 07:18:02.110 align:start position:0%
made
our

07:18:02.110 --> 07:18:02.120 align:start position:0%
our
 
07:18:04.468 --> 07:18:04.478 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination laws
 
07:18:05.750 --> 07:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
a statement
 
07:18:06.948 --> 07:18:06.958 align:start position:0%
that how
 
07:18:09.510 --> 07:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire treats people in protected
 
07:18:12.548 --> 07:18:12.558 align:start position:0%
classes and transgender people are in a
 
07:18:14.468 --> 07:18:14.478 align:start position:0%
protected class
 
07:18:17.270 --> 07:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
i believe that discrimination is wrong
 
07:18:19.190 --> 07:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
and that everybody should have the
 
07:18:21.590 --> 07:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
ability to succeed in our public schools
 
07:18:22.788 --> 07:18:22.798 align:start position:0%
and life
 
07:18:25.350 --> 07:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
everybody don't come for them
 
07:18:28.868 --> 07:18:28.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:36.230 --> 07:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:38.310 --> 07:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
07:18:39.990 --> 07:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
we had an amendment that took away
 
07:18:42.788 --> 07:18:42.798 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of a very bad bill
 
07:18:45.190 --> 07:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
but that failed so i'll tell you about
 
07:18:47.270 --> 07:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
the two-thirds of the very bad bill that
 
07:18:47.280 --> 07:18:50.070 align:start position:0%
the two-thirds of the very bad bill that
remain

07:18:50.070 --> 07:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:52.628 --> 07:18:52.638 align:start position:0%
one of the things that
 
07:18:55.110 --> 07:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
one of the areas that
 
07:18:57.190 --> 07:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
people would be allowed to assign people
 
07:18:59.430 --> 07:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
only to their biological sex if they
 
07:19:01.030 --> 07:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
chose to do that
 
07:19:03.590 --> 07:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
is in the prison system
 
07:19:06.708 --> 07:19:06.718 align:start position:0%
and the rationale for that was
 
07:19:06.718 --> 07:19:07.590 align:start position:0%
and the rationale for that was
uh

07:19:07.590 --> 07:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:19:07.600 --> 07:19:09.990 align:start position:0%
uh
transgender

07:19:09.990 --> 07:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
transgender
 
07:19:12.150 --> 07:19:12.160 align:start position:0%
women who had not completed their
 
07:19:15.990 --> 07:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
transition being in prison with females
 
07:19:19.190 --> 07:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
so here's the problem
 
07:19:22.230 --> 07:19:22.240 align:start position:0%
what we should be doing for our prison
 
07:19:24.628 --> 07:19:24.638 align:start position:0%
population is making sure that
 
07:19:28.388 --> 07:19:28.398 align:start position:0%
absolutely everyone is safe
 
07:19:31.510 --> 07:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
every single prisoner
 
07:19:34.310 --> 07:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
we know that because we just had the
 
07:19:36.548 --> 07:19:36.558 align:start position:0%
bill about the youth development center
 
07:19:39.350 --> 07:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
we need to keep everybody safe
 
07:19:42.070 --> 07:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
and the way of doing that is not
 
07:19:44.548 --> 07:19:44.558 align:start position:0%
assigning somebody who is part way
 
07:19:47.110 --> 07:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
through a transition from male to female
 
07:19:49.830 --> 07:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
back to a male prison
 
07:19:53.670 --> 07:19:53.680 align:start position:0%
that's not safe the other thing is that
 
07:19:57.430 --> 07:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
it is not fair to put all the burden of
 
07:19:57.440 --> 07:19:59.110 align:start position:0%
it is not fair to put all the burden of
safety

07:19:59.110 --> 07:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
safety
 
07:20:01.750 --> 07:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
on transgender people
 
07:20:04.788 --> 07:20:04.798 align:start position:0%
what we ought to be doing in the prisons
 
07:20:08.310 --> 07:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
is to ensure the safety of all the
 
07:20:08.320 --> 07:20:09.750 align:start position:0%
is to ensure the safety of all the
prisoners

07:20:09.750 --> 07:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
prisoners
 
07:20:12.548 --> 07:20:12.558 align:start position:0%
and that is being worked on with prison
 
07:20:12.558 --> 07:20:14.070 align:start position:0%
and that is being worked on with prison
policies

07:20:14.070 --> 07:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
policies
 
07:20:14.080 --> 07:20:16.070 align:start position:0%
policies
and

07:20:16.070 --> 07:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:20:19.830 --> 07:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
their policies of how people are housed
 
07:20:23.750 --> 07:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
which takes into account and recognizes
 
07:20:26.788 --> 07:20:26.798 align:start position:0%
their gender identity without forcing
 
07:20:26.798 --> 07:20:27.750 align:start position:0%
their gender identity without forcing
them

07:20:27.750 --> 07:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
them
 
07:20:30.788 --> 07:20:30.798 align:start position:0%
to relinquish it
 
07:20:34.708 --> 07:20:34.718 align:start position:0%
so that's we we had very strong language
 
07:20:37.910 --> 07:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
from uh both i believe
 
07:20:39.510 --> 07:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
somebody who is a superintendent of
 
07:20:41.190 --> 07:20:41.200 align:start position:0%
corrections in one of the counties and
 
07:20:43.030 --> 07:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
also from the department of corrections
 
07:20:44.468 --> 07:20:44.478 align:start position:0%
at the state level
 
07:20:46.468 --> 07:20:46.478 align:start position:0%
that this the provisions of this bill
 
07:20:48.310 --> 07:20:48.320 align:start position:0%
are going to make their lives infinitely
 
07:20:50.388 --> 07:20:50.398 align:start position:0%
more difficult
 
07:20:53.030 --> 07:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
so that's one thing the other section
 
07:20:55.750 --> 07:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
that's still in the bill
 
07:20:58.628 --> 07:20:58.638 align:start position:0%
is the inclusion of what was called
 
07:21:03.350 --> 07:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:04.868 --> 07:21:04.878 align:start position:0%
you know what that sounds like to me
 
07:21:08.230 --> 07:21:08.240 align:start position:0%
that sounds like a bathroom bill
 
07:21:10.468 --> 07:21:10.478 align:start position:0%
do you remember what happened in north
 
07:21:12.948 --> 07:21:12.958 align:start position:0%
carolina when north carolina passed a
 
07:21:14.708 --> 07:21:14.718 align:start position:0%
bathroom bill
 
07:21:16.788 --> 07:21:16.798 align:start position:0%
it wasn't pretty
 
07:21:18.628 --> 07:21:18.638 align:start position:0%
people actually
 
07:21:21.350 --> 07:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
pulled out athletic competitions and all
 
07:21:23.990 --> 07:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
kinds of other things because they
 
07:21:26.230 --> 07:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
had gone down that road
 
07:21:28.150 --> 07:21:28.160 align:start position:0%
and i know that people are going to tell
 
07:21:31.990 --> 07:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
me well this just permits people to do
 
07:21:34.948 --> 07:21:34.958 align:start position:0%
it it doesn't require
 
07:21:37.670 --> 07:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
but here's the rub with that
 
07:21:41.750 --> 07:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
if you permit people to discriminate
 
07:21:44.948 --> 07:21:44.958 align:start position:0%
in all three of these areas sports
 
07:21:49.030 --> 07:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
prisons and places of intimate privacy
 
07:21:49.040 --> 07:21:50.468 align:start position:0%
prisons and places of intimate privacy
then

07:21:50.468 --> 07:21:50.478 align:start position:0%
then
 
07:21:54.310 --> 07:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
a transgender person who is assigned
 
07:21:54.320 --> 07:21:56.548 align:start position:0%
a transgender person who is assigned
unfairly

07:21:56.548 --> 07:21:56.558 align:start position:0%
unfairly
 
07:21:58.548 --> 07:21:58.558 align:start position:0%
to a place
 
07:22:01.350 --> 07:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
for their biological sex
 
07:22:05.110 --> 07:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
will no longer have the protections
 
07:22:07.750 --> 07:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
against discrimination
 
07:22:10.388 --> 07:22:10.398 align:start position:0%
that they now have because we just
 
07:22:13.110 --> 07:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
removed them in this bill
 
07:22:16.788 --> 07:22:16.798 align:start position:0%
and there will be no recourse for them
 
07:22:18.948 --> 07:22:18.958 align:start position:0%
so for those reasons
 
07:22:21.430 --> 07:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
because this bill is now back to its
 
07:22:25.430 --> 07:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
original and exceedingly flawed form
 
07:22:27.110 --> 07:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
i ask you
 
07:22:30.708 --> 07:22:30.718 align:start position:0%
to press the red button and it'll so
 
07:22:32.628 --> 07:22:32.638 align:start position:0%
that another motion can be made thank
 
07:22:36.788 --> 07:22:36.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:40.468 --> 07:22:40.478 align:start position:0%
no remember it does not yield
 
07:22:50.230 --> 07:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:02.468 --> 07:23:02.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:05.030 --> 07:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
so what is our purpose here
 
07:23:07.430 --> 07:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
are we putting in legislation
 
07:23:09.750 --> 07:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
to control a very small portion of our
 
07:23:09.760 --> 07:23:13.590 align:start position:0%
to control a very small portion of our
population

07:23:13.590 --> 07:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:16.948 --> 07:23:16.958 align:start position:0%
our transgender population for everyone
 
07:23:21.430 --> 07:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
is about one-third of one percent
 
07:23:24.548 --> 07:23:24.558 align:start position:0%
of our entire population
 
07:23:25.670 --> 07:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
of that
 
07:23:28.628 --> 07:23:28.638 align:start position:0%
only about 500
 
07:23:31.590 --> 07:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
members are students
 
07:23:33.270 --> 07:23:33.280 align:start position:0%
most of those students
 
07:23:36.788 --> 07:23:36.798 align:start position:0%
are there to get an education very few
 
07:23:38.868 --> 07:23:38.878 align:start position:0%
of them are there to participate in
 
07:23:38.878 --> 07:23:41.030 align:start position:0%
of them are there to participate in
sports

07:23:41.030 --> 07:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
sports
 
07:23:43.430 --> 07:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
and it's very rare when one of those
 
07:23:43.440 --> 07:23:45.030 align:start position:0%
and it's very rare when one of those
students

07:23:45.030 --> 07:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
students
 
07:23:48.830 --> 07:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:53.030 --> 07:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
superstar i understand we have a need
 
07:23:55.670 --> 07:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
to make sports fair between
 
07:23:57.990 --> 07:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
transgender girls
 
07:24:05.030 --> 07:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:08.150 --> 07:24:08.160 align:start position:0%
our schools are aware of this
 
07:24:10.310 --> 07:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
the agencies the the athletic
 
07:24:12.868 --> 07:24:12.878 align:start position:0%
associations are aware of this
 
07:24:17.430 --> 07:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
the ioc and the ncaa are aware of this
 
07:24:19.590 --> 07:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
and they've been putting in
 
07:24:22.070 --> 07:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
place policies
 
07:24:25.990 --> 07:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
to help both the transgender
 
07:24:28.628 --> 07:24:28.638 align:start position:0%
girls and the trent and the straight
 
07:24:39.990 --> 07:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:43.750 --> 07:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:43.760 --> 07:24:44.830 align:start position:0%
 
they've

07:24:44.830 --> 07:24:44.840 align:start position:0%
they've
 
07:24:48.150 --> 07:24:48.160 align:start position:0%
identified medication that allows

most of these girls
 
07:25:24.948 --> 07:25:24.958 align:start position:0%
won't start

there are a number of organizations

keep track of

a few of the organizations that are

this bill that's been introduced
 
07:28:59.510 --> 07:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
is on the the bleeding edge
 
07:29:02.548 --> 07:29:02.558 align:start position:0%
or the leading edge of what is already
 
07:29:06.548 --> 07:29:06.558 align:start position:0%
happening in in other places and it's
 
07:29:09.910 --> 07:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
if we implement this bill
 
07:29:11.590 --> 07:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
it's ignoring
 
07:29:14.070 --> 07:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
that this work is already being done in
 
07:29:15.510 --> 07:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
other areas
 
07:29:17.510 --> 07:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
and it may be more appropriate to be
 
07:29:20.388 --> 07:29:20.398 align:start position:0%
done by other associations organizations
 
07:29:22.628 --> 07:29:22.638 align:start position:0%
that are working with transgender people
 
07:29:24.468 --> 07:29:24.478 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker mr speaker if i
 
07:42:21.350 --> 07:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
know that there is nothing in statute
 
07:42:23.350 --> 07:42:23.360 align:start position:0%
that currently prevents anything that
 
07:42:25.750 --> 07:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
this bill seeks to codify
 
07:42:27.590 --> 07:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
and if i know that we should not waste
 
07:42:30.070 --> 07:42:30.080 align:start position:0%
our time on unnecessary legislation that
 
07:42:32.310 --> 07:42:32.320 align:start position:0%
does nothing more than add new laws to
 
07:42:34.468 --> 07:42:34.478 align:start position:0%
the books with no purpose
 
07:42:36.468 --> 07:42:36.478 align:start position:0%
and if i know that performing arts
 
07:42:38.230 --> 07:42:38.240 align:start position:0%
venues have been setting their own
 
07:42:40.868 --> 07:42:40.878 align:start position:0%
coveted policies this entire time i
 
07:42:44.628 --> 07:42:44.638 align:start position:0%
would now vote green to table this bill
 
07:42:46.230 --> 07:42:46.240 align:start position:0%
g i recognize the representative kenner
 
07:42:49.030 --> 07:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
for parliamentary inquiry
 
07:42:51.990 --> 07:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker if i know that
 
07:42:54.868 --> 07:42:54.878 align:start position:0%
it is true that facilities of venues can
 
07:42:56.788 --> 07:42:56.798 align:start position:0%
do this but they have been challenged
 
07:42:58.708 --> 07:42:58.718 align:start position:0%
with people saying that you do not have
 
07:43:01.430 --> 07:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
the right to set your own protocols
 
07:43:03.350 --> 07:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
and them setting their own safety
 
07:43:05.830 --> 07:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
protocols for the safety of their
 
07:43:08.548 --> 07:43:08.558 align:start position:0%
patrons and for their employees
 
07:43:10.708 --> 07:43:10.718 align:start position:0%
is a business decision which they should
 
07:43:13.990 --> 07:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
be allowed to make on their own
 
07:43:15.830 --> 07:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
and if i know that if they do not honor
 
07:43:17.830 --> 07:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
the requests of the artist that artist
 
07:43:20.230 --> 07:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
can take their business to another venue
 
07:43:22.150 --> 07:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
perhaps across the border to a southern
 
07:43:23.910 --> 07:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
state state just bordering us to the
 
07:43:27.190 --> 07:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
south and we lose that business
 
07:43:28.948 --> 07:43:28.958 align:start position:0%
and if i know that many patrons will
 
07:43:31.110 --> 07:43:31.120 align:start position:0%
feel much more comfortable to go into a
 
07:43:33.110 --> 07:43:33.120 align:start position:0%
setting if they do know that their
 
07:43:36.230 --> 07:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
safety is being respected
 
07:43:38.150 --> 07:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
and therefore it can be a marketing move
 
07:43:39.750 --> 07:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
in addition to their own independent
 
07:43:41.430 --> 07:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
business decision
 
07:43:43.190 --> 07:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
and if i know that what this bill does
 
07:43:46.070 --> 07:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
then is affirms
 
07:43:48.788 --> 07:43:48.798 align:start position:0%
the firms the fact that they do have the
 
07:43:51.430 --> 07:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
authority to set their own business
 
07:43:55.350 --> 07:43:55.360 align:start position:0%
policies with regard to various
 
07:43:56.948 --> 07:43:56.958 align:start position:0%
protocols for protection for
 
07:43:58.788 --> 07:43:58.798 align:start position:0%
communicable diseases
 
07:44:02.150 --> 07:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
would i then vote against this tabling
 
07:44:05.270 --> 07:44:05.280 align:start position:0%

authority of the commissioner of dhhs
 
07:52:57.510 --> 07:52:57.520 align:start position:0%

necessary to be done
 
07:53:06.150 --> 07:53:06.160 align:start position:0%

07:58:01.030 --> 07:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
07:58:03.030 --> 07:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
if we earlier today discussed how
 
07:58:05.110 --> 07:58:05.120 align:start position:0%
vulnerable children are when they're
 
07:58:07.110 --> 07:58:07.120 align:start position:0%
sitting in a therapist's office and we
 
07:58:09.910 --> 07:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
respected that vulnerability
 
07:58:11.750 --> 07:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
and if i know
 
07:58:13.910 --> 07:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
that parents should be involved in the
 
07:58:15.590 --> 07:58:15.600 align:start position:0%
therapy of their children and to at
 
07:58:17.270 --> 07:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
least know if their child is seeing a
 
07:58:17.280 --> 07:58:18.788 align:start position:0%
least know if their child is seeing a
therapist

07:58:18.788 --> 07:58:18.798 align:start position:0%
therapist
 
07:58:20.708 --> 07:58:20.718 align:start position:0%
and if i believe that this interferes
 
07:58:22.628 --> 07:58:22.638 align:start position:0%
with not only parental rights but family
 
07:58:25.190 --> 07:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
relationships would i piss the press the
 
07:58:28.868 --> 07:58:28.878 align:start position:0%
green button to table this bill
 
07:58:30.548 --> 07:58:30.558 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative weber
 
07:58:32.708 --> 07:58:32.718 align:start position:0%
for a parliamentary inquiry
 
07:58:34.788 --> 07:58:34.798 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
07:58:36.708 --> 07:58:36.718 align:start position:0%
if i agree that parents should be
 
07:58:38.708 --> 07:58:38.718 align:start position:0%
involved but i know that there are many
 
07:58:41.270 --> 07:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
parents who are either disengaged or
 
07:58:44.230 --> 07:58:44.240 align:start position:0%
unable to engage and do not look after
 
07:58:45.910 --> 07:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
their children
 
07:58:48.948 --> 07:58:48.958 align:start position:0%
and if i know that by age 16 a child a
 
07:58:52.230 --> 07:58:52.240 align:start position:0%
minor can consent to sexual activity
 
07:58:54.468 --> 07:58:54.478 align:start position:0%
much as we wish they wouldn't
 
07:58:56.468 --> 07:58:56.478 align:start position:0%
and to
 
07:58:58.788 --> 07:58:58.798 align:start position:0%
be treated for a sexually transmitted
 
07:59:01.910 --> 07:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
disease and tr and treated for drug
 
07:59:04.948 --> 07:59:04.958 align:start position:0%
abuse and substance abuse
 
07:59:07.990 --> 07:59:08.000 align:start position:0%
and if i know it makes no sense
 
07:59:11.590 --> 07:59:11.600 align:start position:0%
to wait till a minor is addicted before
 
07:59:13.510 --> 07:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
we give them help
 
07:59:15.830 --> 07:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
so it would be better to allow them
 
07:59:18.070 --> 07:59:18.080 align:start position:0%
mental health treatment where a
 
07:59:20.708 --> 07:59:20.718 align:start position:0%
counselor might help them connect with
 
07:59:23.830 --> 07:59:23.840 align:start position:0%
their family and repair the damage to
 
07:59:25.990 --> 07:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
the family structure
 
07:59:28.948 --> 07:59:28.958 align:start position:0%

07:59:31.190 --> 07:59:31.200 align:start position:0%

08:06:14.388 --> 08:06:14.398 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
08:06:16.230 --> 08:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
we all agree
 
08:06:18.948 --> 08:06:18.958 align:start position:0%
and we heard heart-rending stories and
 
08:06:22.070 --> 08:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
all of us have life experiences that
 
08:06:24.230 --> 08:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
lead us to the conclusion
 
08:06:24.240 --> 08:06:28.868 align:start position:0%
lead us to the conclusion
that

08:06:28.868 --> 08:06:28.878 align:start position:0%
 
08:06:32.310 --> 08:06:32.320 align:start position:0%
everyone who is in hospital deserves the
 
08:06:34.628 --> 08:06:34.638 align:start position:0%
support and care
 
08:06:37.270 --> 08:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
of their loved ones
 
08:06:39.510 --> 08:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
and we worked very hard on this bill and
 
08:06:41.830 --> 08:06:41.840 align:start position:0%
we worked collaboratively on this bill
 
08:06:41.840 --> 08:06:43.590 align:start position:0%
we worked collaboratively on this bill
and

08:06:43.590 --> 08:06:43.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
08:06:46.548 --> 08:06:46.558 align:start position:0%
we came together on a lot of things so
 
08:06:46.558 --> 08:06:47.350 align:start position:0%
we came together on a lot of things so
i'm

08:06:47.350 --> 08:06:47.360 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
08:06:48.548 --> 08:06:48.558 align:start position:0%
i thank
 
08:06:52.468 --> 08:06:52.478 align:start position:0%
 
08:06:54.788 --> 08:06:54.798 align:start position:0%
the problem is that
 
08:06:57.990 --> 08:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
what we didn't agree on first of all we
 
08:06:59.430 --> 08:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
we agreed
 
08:07:01.830 --> 08:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
that a policy should be in the patient's
 
08:07:03.590 --> 08:07:03.600 align:start position:0%
bill of rights
 
08:07:05.350 --> 08:07:05.360 align:start position:0%
that it should be the right of the
 
08:07:05.360 --> 08:07:07.030 align:start position:0%
that it should be the right of the
patient

08:07:07.030 --> 08:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
patient
 
08:07:09.830 --> 08:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
to have their loved ones with them when
 
08:07:12.310 --> 08:07:12.320 align:start position:0%
they're in a facility
 
08:07:12.320 --> 08:07:13.190 align:start position:0%
they're in a facility
and

08:07:13.190 --> 08:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
08:07:15.590 --> 08:07:15.600 align:start position:0%
we agreed that we would keep the
 
08:07:18.708 --> 08:07:18.718 align:start position:0%
language from the original bill
 
08:07:21.590 --> 08:07:21.600 align:start position:0%
that balances the rights
 
08:07:23.990 --> 08:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
of one patient
 
08:07:25.910 --> 08:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
to have the support and care of their
 
08:07:28.868 --> 08:07:28.878 align:start position:0%
family or loved ones with the rights of
 
08:07:31.670 --> 08:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
every other patient to also have
 
08:07:33.510 --> 08:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate care
 
08:07:36.150 --> 08:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate infection control
 
08:07:39.190 --> 08:07:39.200 align:start position:0%
and appropriate support that they need
 
08:07:39.200 --> 08:07:40.548 align:start position:0%
and appropriate support that they need
so

08:07:40.548 --> 08:07:40.558 align:start position:0%
so
 
08:07:44.310 --> 08:07:44.320 align:start position:0%
the bill contains a set of balances
 
08:07:44.320 --> 08:07:45.350 align:start position:0%
the bill contains a set of balances
that

08:07:45.350 --> 08:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
08:07:48.150 --> 08:07:48.160 align:start position:0%
the presence of visitors
 
08:07:51.590 --> 08:07:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
08:07:55.030 --> 08:07:55.040 align:start position:0%
medically and therapeutically
 
08:07:55.040 --> 08:07:56.948 align:start position:0%
medically and therapeutically
indicated

08:07:56.948 --> 08:07:56.958 align:start position:0%
indicated
 
08:07:59.510 --> 08:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
that the presence of visitors
 
08:08:01.750 --> 08:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
will not interfere with the care of
 
08:08:01.760 --> 08:08:03.270 align:start position:0%
will not interfere with the care of
others

08:08:03.270 --> 08:08:03.280 align:start position:0%
others
 
08:08:05.350 --> 08:08:05.360 align:start position:0%
that visitors engaging disruptive and
 
08:08:07.590 --> 08:08:07.600 align:start position:0%
threatening or violent behavior can be
 
08:08:07.600 --> 08:08:08.868 align:start position:0%
threatening or violent behavior can be
excluded

08:08:08.868 --> 08:08:08.878 align:start position:0%
excluded
 
08:08:11.190 --> 08:08:11.200 align:start position:0%
and visitors non-compliant with hospital
 
08:08:12.628 --> 08:08:12.638 align:start position:0%
policy can be
 
08:08:15.430 --> 08:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
included that's in both bills
 
08:08:18.468 --> 08:08:18.478 align:start position:0%
that's the balancing that is important
 
08:08:20.230 --> 08:08:20.240 align:start position:0%
here's where the bills
 
08:08:22.628 --> 08:08:22.638 align:start position:0%
the amendments differ
 
08:08:25.110 --> 08:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
in my amendment
 
08:08:27.430 --> 08:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
those considerations are put just in the
 
08:08:30.788 --> 08:08:30.798 align:start position:0%
patient's bill of rights
 
08:08:33.830 --> 08:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
in the amendment you just passed
 
08:08:36.628 --> 08:08:36.638 align:start position:0%
they are also put into the hospital
 
08:08:40.788 --> 08:08:40.798 align:start position:0%
licensing the facility licensing statute
 
08:08:40.798 --> 08:08:41.670 align:start position:0%
licensing the facility licensing statute
so

08:08:41.670 --> 08:08:41.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
08:08:41.680 --> 08:08:44.468 align:start position:0%
so
when

08:08:44.468 --> 08:08:44.478 align:start position:0%
 
08:08:48.070 --> 08:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
in the course of a terrible pandemic or
 
08:08:48.080 --> 08:08:48.948 align:start position:0%
in the course of a terrible pandemic or
other

08:08:48.948 --> 08:08:48.958 align:start position:0%
other
 
08:08:51.430 --> 08:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
horrible emergency
 
08:08:55.510 --> 08:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
the hospital has to balance these rights
 
08:08:58.150 --> 08:08:58.160 align:start position:0%
and the amendment we just passed also
 
08:08:58.160 --> 08:08:59.510 align:start position:0%
and the amendment we just passed also
requires

08:08:59.510 --> 08:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
requires
 
08:09:02.388 --> 08:09:02.398 align:start position:0%
that whenever a visitor is denied access
 
08:09:04.468 --> 08:09:04.478 align:start position:0%
it must be carefully charted into the
 
08:09:06.628 --> 08:09:06.638 align:start position:0%
medical records
 
08:09:10.948 --> 08:09:10.958 align:start position:0%
so at a time when resources are scarce
 
08:09:10.958 --> 08:09:11.830 align:start position:0%
so at a time when resources are scarce
and

08:09:11.830 --> 08:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
08:09:14.548 --> 08:09:14.558 align:start position:0%
risks are high
 
08:09:18.310 --> 08:09:18.320 align:start position:0%
we are using valuable medical time to
 
08:09:20.628 --> 08:09:20.638 align:start position:0%
deal with charting
 
08:09:23.270 --> 08:09:23.280 align:start position:0%
instead of caring for patients
 
08:09:25.750 --> 08:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
and at a time when hospitals are having
 
08:09:27.510 --> 08:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
to make the most difficult of
 
08:09:29.910 --> 08:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
dyscritical decisions
 
08:09:32.310 --> 08:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
we are putting their license on the line
 
08:09:36.388 --> 08:09:36.398 align:start position:0%
if they get it wrong so i believe
 
08:09:39.190 --> 08:09:39.200 align:start position:0%
that the appropriate thing is to give
 
08:09:40.788 --> 08:09:40.798 align:start position:0%
the rights to the patient in the
 
08:09:42.708 --> 08:09:42.718 align:start position:0%
patient's bill of rights
 
08:09:45.990 --> 08:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
protecting the rights of all patients
 
08:09:48.388 --> 08:09:48.398 align:start position:0%
and simply leave it there
 
08:09:50.868 --> 08:09:50.878 align:start position:0%
and adopt the minority amendment by
 
08:09:55.830 --> 08:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
08:09:59.350 --> 08:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative leon
 
08:10:00.830 --> 08:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr
 
08:10:03.350 --> 08:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
speaker my colleague from walpole is
 
08:10:05.190 --> 08:10:05.200 align:start position:0%
right that it is good to be able to have
 
08:10:07.430 --> 08:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
patients have visitors it is good for
 
08:10:08.548 --> 08:10:08.558 align:start position:0%
their health that is good for their
 
08:10:10.310 --> 08:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
outcome and it is good for their family
 
08:10:12.310 --> 08:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
members that don't know if they'll ever
 
08:10:13.910 --> 08:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
see them again
 
08:10:16.548 --> 08:10:16.558 align:start position:0%
in committee we heard people here in new
 
08:10:16.558 --> 08:10:17.590 align:start position:0%
in committee we heard people here in new
hampshire

08:10:17.590 --> 08:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
08:10:19.270 --> 08:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
they were unable to see their daughters
 
08:10:21.190 --> 08:10:21.200 align:start position:0%
that were my age
 
08:10:23.350 --> 08:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
and those daughters died of covet in the
 
08:10:23.360 --> 08:10:25.750 align:start position:0%
and those daughters died of covet in the
hospital

08:10:25.750 --> 08:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
08:10:27.110 --> 08:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
it was worse
 
08:10:30.310 --> 08:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
that nobody knew what to expect
 
08:10:32.230 --> 08:10:32.240 align:start position:0%
you didn't know what the visitation
 
08:10:33.670 --> 08:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
policies were
 
08:10:36.230 --> 08:10:36.240 align:start position:0%
you couldn't find them you didn't know
 
08:10:37.750 --> 08:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
what was going on
 
08:10:39.750 --> 08:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
why you would be denied
 
08:10:41.910 --> 08:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
and what was happening with your loved
 
08:10:41.920 --> 08:10:43.590 align:start position:0%
and what was happening with your loved
one

08:10:43.590 --> 08:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
one
 
08:10:45.830 --> 08:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
the two differences we have are we put
 
08:10:47.590 --> 08:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
it in the licensing statute with the
 
08:10:49.030 --> 08:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
majority amendment that we've already
 
08:10:49.040 --> 08:10:50.628 align:start position:0%
majority amendment that we've already
adopted

08:10:50.628 --> 08:10:50.638 align:start position:0%
adopted
 
08:10:52.548 --> 08:10:52.558 align:start position:0%
and we make it so that there'll be a
 
08:10:54.388 --> 08:10:54.398 align:start position:0%
documentation so that we know why it's
 
08:10:55.510 --> 08:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
been denied
 
08:10:57.350 --> 08:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
it's easy enough to when you're saying
 
08:10:59.750 --> 08:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
that the patient coded say the patient
 
08:11:02.230 --> 08:11:02.240 align:start position:0%
coded and we asked the family to leave
 
08:11:03.910 --> 08:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
it's a small change if you have a
 
08:11:06.468 --> 08:11:06.478 align:start position:0%
significant medical event you're already
 
08:11:08.868 --> 08:11:08.878 align:start position:0%
documenting it in the paperwork and this
 
08:11:10.310 --> 08:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
protects both the patients and their
 
08:11:12.708 --> 08:11:12.718 align:start position:0%
access to their family members and the
 
08:11:14.948 --> 08:11:14.958 align:start position:0%
hospitals if somebody's aggrieved and
 
08:11:17.750 --> 08:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
let's be honest these times are trying
 
08:11:19.750 --> 08:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
we've all been trying to survive these
 
08:11:22.230 --> 08:11:22.240 align:start position:0%
last two years with as little harm as
 
08:11:22.240 --> 08:11:25.350 align:start position:0%
last two years with as little harm as
possible

08:11:25.350 --> 08:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
08:11:27.670 --> 08:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
if we stay if we defeat this amendment
 
08:11:29.510 --> 08:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
and stay with the majority amendment
 
08:11:31.350 --> 08:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
that we've already adopted
 
08:11:32.948 --> 08:11:32.958 align:start position:0%
this they will have to have their
 
08:11:35.910 --> 08:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
policies online and on the wall of every
 
08:11:37.190 --> 08:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
patient room
 
08:11:39.350 --> 08:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
so that when the patient is upset or a
 
08:11:41.590 --> 08:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
visitor is upset if they have to leave
 
08:11:43.670 --> 08:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
the provider can say right here i'm
 
08:11:43.680 --> 08:11:44.708 align:start position:0%
the provider can say right here i'm
sorry

08:11:44.708 --> 08:11:44.718 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
08:11:46.708 --> 08:11:46.718 align:start position:0%
but this is a risk to another patient's
 
08:11:47.990 --> 08:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
rights and so we need to ask you to
 
08:11:48.000 --> 08:11:49.590 align:start position:0%
rights and so we need to ask you to
leave

08:11:49.590 --> 08:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
leave
 
08:11:51.430 --> 08:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
we'll have transparency we'll have
 
08:11:51.440 --> 08:11:52.548 align:start position:0%
we'll have transparency we'll have
clarity

08:11:52.548 --> 08:11:52.558 align:start position:0%
clarity
 
08:11:54.150 --> 08:11:54.160 align:start position:0%
and we can move on with the business of
 
08:11:54.160 --> 08:11:55.430 align:start position:0%
and we can move on with the business of
healing

08:11:55.430 --> 08:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
healing
 
08:11:57.350 --> 08:11:57.360 align:start position:0%

people should be excluded
 
08:14:42.310 --> 08:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
from supporting their loved ones and if
 
08:14:44.070 --> 08:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
i know that the terms of these two
 
08:14:46.548 --> 08:14:46.558 align:start position:0%
amendments are basically
 
08:14:48.070 --> 08:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
the same
 
08:14:52.708 --> 08:14:52.718 align:start position:0%
except for the extra burdens put on
 
08:14:54.868 --> 08:14:54.878 align:start position:0%
a health care facility

extra burdens
 
08:15:07.910 --> 08:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
will result
 
08:15:10.868 --> 08:15:10.878 align:start position:0%
in bad health outcomes to some of the
 
08:15:10.878 --> 08:15:12.150 align:start position:0%

speaker
 
08:15:26.388 --> 08:15:26.398 align:start position:0%
if i know that the patient's bill of
 
08:15:28.468 --> 08:15:28.478 align:start position:0%
rights already protects the right to
 
08:15:29.750 --> 08:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
have a visitor
 
08:15:32.070 --> 08:15:32.080 align:start position:0%
when death is imminent but that was not
 
08:15:33.830 --> 08:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
always granted
 
08:15:36.468 --> 08:15:36.478 align:start position:0%
and if i know that a law without teeth
 
08:15:38.548 --> 08:15:38.558 align:start position:0%
is only a suggestion
 
08:15:40.230 --> 08:15:40.240 align:start position:0%
and if i know
 
08:15:42.070 --> 08:15:42.080 align:start position:0%
that while a large step putting this in

at the hearing a conflict caused by this

08:19:40.548 --> 08:19:40.558 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
08:19:43.910 --> 08:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
are in compliance with federal mandates
 
08:19:45.990 --> 08:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
as part of the accreditation process of
 
08:19:48.708 --> 08:19:48.718 align:start position:0%
a health care facility
 
08:19:50.548 --> 08:19:50.558 align:start position:0%
and this includes compliance with the
 
08:19:53.190 --> 08:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
cms mandate requiring covet 19
 
08:19:56.230 --> 08:19:56.240 align:start position:0%
vaccination of health care workers
 
08:19:59.270 --> 08:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
so prohibiting dhhs from doing their
 
08:20:01.190 --> 08:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
duty of accrediting health care
 
08:20:01.200 --> 08:20:02.868 align:start position:0%
duty of accrediting health care
facilities

08:20:02.868 --> 08:20:02.878 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
08:20:05.430 --> 08:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
that'll have impacts it'll lead to a
 
08:20:08.548 --> 08:20:08.558 align:start position:0%
loss of accreditation of facilities
 
08:20:10.468 --> 08:20:10.478 align:start position:0%
that leads to a loss of reimbursement
 
08:20:13.270 --> 08:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
from cms for medicaid
 
08:20:16.150 --> 08:20:16.160 align:start position:0%
and for medicare patients and ultimately
 
08:20:18.388 --> 08:20:18.398 align:start position:0%
for termination from medicare
 
08:20:20.868 --> 08:20:20.878 align:start position:0%
and medicaid programs and remember
 
08:20:22.868 --> 08:20:22.878 align:start position:0%
medicaid provides the majority of
 
08:20:26.948 --> 08:20:26.958 align:start position:0%
funding for our nursing homes
 
08:20:28.788 --> 08:20:28.798 align:start position:0%
it will also lead to payment loss of
 
08:20:31.750 --> 08:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
payment from private insurers
 
08:20:32.948 --> 08:20:32.958 align:start position:0%
the reason is
 
08:20:36.388 --> 08:20:36.398 align:start position:0%
they don't pay unaccredited facilities
 
08:20:38.308 --> 08:20:38.318 align:start position:0%
the loss of reimbursements will require
 
08:20:40.308 --> 08:20:40.318 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire
 
08:20:42.468 --> 08:20:42.478 align:start position:0%
or our counties or both
 
08:20:45.190 --> 08:20:45.200 align:start position:0%
to backfill hundreds of millions of
 
08:20:48.308 --> 08:20:48.318 align:start position:0%
dollars in funding to keep our hospitals
 
08:20:51.030 --> 08:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
and nursing homes open
 
08:20:53.510 --> 08:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
now in january 13 the u.s supreme court
 
08:20:55.110 --> 08:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
upheld the cms mandate for the
 
08:20:57.270 --> 08:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
vaccination of health care workers
 
08:20:59.350 --> 08:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
they stayed the lower court injunction
 
08:21:00.708 --> 08:21:00.718 align:start position:0%
and if you read the text of their
 
08:21:02.548 --> 08:21:02.558 align:start position:0%
decision they make it really really
 
08:21:02.558 --> 08:21:03.430 align:start position:0%
decision they make it really really
clear

08:21:03.430 --> 08:21:03.440 align:start position:0%
clear
 
08:21:05.510 --> 08:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
that they support the cms vaccine
 
08:21:05.520 --> 08:21:06.868 align:start position:0%
that they support the cms vaccine
mandate

08:21:06.868 --> 08:21:06.878 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
08:21:08.150 --> 08:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
if it makes it through some appeal
 
08:21:10.230 --> 08:21:10.240 align:start position:0%
process and comes to them they will
 
08:21:12.468 --> 08:21:12.478 align:start position:0%
still support it but furthermore there
 
08:21:14.070 --> 08:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
have been no appeals to that supreme
 
08:21:15.670 --> 08:21:15.680 align:start position:0%
court decision in the two months that
 
08:21:17.830 --> 08:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
have elapsed since that time
 
08:21:19.990 --> 08:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
so it stands
 
08:21:21.670 --> 08:21:21.680 align:start position:0%
i do not think that the state of new
 
08:21:21.680 --> 08:21:22.788 align:start position:0%
i do not think that the state of new
hampshire

08:21:22.788 --> 08:21:22.798 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
08:21:24.628 --> 08:21:24.638 align:start position:0%
should place itself
 
08:21:27.270 --> 08:21:27.280 align:start position:0%
and our counties in the position of
 
08:21:29.590 --> 08:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
needing to backfill hundreds of millions
 
08:21:32.150 --> 08:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
of dollars of funding to keep our
 
08:21:34.788 --> 08:21:34.798 align:start position:0%
hospitals and nursing homes open
 
08:21:36.388 --> 08:21:36.398 align:start position:0%
so i would encourage you to press the
 
08:21:38.788 --> 08:21:38.798 align:start position:0%
red button to vote no
 
08:21:41.350 --> 08:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
on hb1455
 
08:21:43.990 --> 08:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
so another motion can be brought forth
 
08:21:46.308 --> 08:21:46.318 align:start position:0%
and i would request a division vote and
 
08:21:47.670 --> 08:21:47.680 align:start position:0%
perhaps also
 
08:21:47.680 --> 08:21:48.708 align:start position:0%
perhaps also
your

08:21:48.708 --> 08:21:48.718 align:start position:0%
your
 
08:21:48.718 --> 08:21:58.308 align:start position:0%
your
forgiveness

08:21:58.308 --> 08:21:58.318 align:start position:0%
 
08:22:00.548 --> 08:22:00.558 align:start position:0%
we are down to the last speaker
 
08:22:02.388 --> 08:22:02.398 align:start position:0%
representative blazik has requested a
 
08:22:06.468 --> 08:22:06.478 align:start position:0%
 
08:22:08.308 --> 08:22:08.318 align:start position:0%
it is sufficiently seconded this will be
 
08:22:13.110 --> 08:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
08:22:14.708 --> 08:22:14.718 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative mark
 
08:22:14.718 --> 08:22:17.190 align:start position:0%

pearson
 
08:22:19.910 --> 08:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker and might i add
 
08:22:21.990 --> 08:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
08:22:24.708 --> 08:22:24.718 align:start position:0%
the balance of power and responsibility
 
08:22:26.948 --> 08:22:26.958 align:start position:0%
between the federal government and the
 
08:22:26.958 --> 08:22:28.230 align:start position:0%
between the federal government and the
states

08:22:28.230 --> 08:22:28.240 align:start position:0%
states
 
08:22:31.270 --> 08:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
has often tilted against that wonderful
 
08:22:34.868 --> 08:22:34.878 align:start position:0%
balance enshrined in the 10th amendment
 
08:22:37.990 --> 08:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
in the 19th century some northern states
 
08:22:41.190 --> 08:22:41.200 align:start position:0%
passed personal liberty laws which made
 
08:22:42.868 --> 08:22:42.878 align:start position:0%
it illegal
 
08:22:44.868 --> 08:22:44.878 align:start position:0%
for citizens of their states to help
 
08:22:44.878 --> 08:22:46.070 align:start position:0%
for citizens of their states to help
enforce

08:22:46.070 --> 08:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
enforce
 
08:22:49.670 --> 08:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
the federal fugitive slave act
 
08:22:52.548 --> 08:22:52.558 align:start position:0%
and in our day some states perhaps
 
08:22:55.110 --> 08:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
different from us in their political
 
08:22:55.120 --> 08:22:56.308 align:start position:0%
different from us in their political
beliefs

08:22:56.308 --> 08:22:56.318 align:start position:0%
beliefs
 
08:22:58.468 --> 08:22:58.478 align:start position:0%
have claimed the right to be
 
08:23:00.308 --> 08:23:00.318 align:start position:0%
sanctuary states
 
08:23:02.628 --> 08:23:02.638 align:start position:0%
and thus banned cooperation with federal
 
08:23:05.990 --> 08:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
authorities regarding illegal immigrants
 
08:23:09.430 --> 08:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
i've heard this commended yesterday by
 
08:23:12.150 --> 08:23:12.160 align:start position:0%
members of the party across the aisle
 
08:23:15.110 --> 08:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
if we agree with them and such states
 
08:23:17.430 --> 08:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
then and now not so much
 
08:23:20.548 --> 08:23:20.558 align:start position:0%
exactly on the specific topic but on the
 
08:23:23.110 --> 08:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
idea of saying no
 
08:23:25.510 --> 08:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
then the legitimacy of a mandated lack
 
08:23:28.308 --> 08:23:28.318 align:start position:0%
of cooperation we should understand is
 
08:23:31.350 --> 08:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
the motivation behind this bill
 
08:23:33.430 --> 08:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
i know that some other states have
 
08:23:35.750 --> 08:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
similarly asserted rights on this very
 
08:23:38.070 --> 08:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
subject matter contained in this
 
08:23:40.230 --> 08:23:40.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely wonderful brilliantly
 
08:23:45.590 --> 08:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
08:23:47.190 --> 08:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
and they've not lost federal
 
08:23:51.270 --> 08:23:51.280 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for medicare or medicaid
 
08:23:53.270 --> 08:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
and in terms of what the supreme court
 
08:23:54.548 --> 08:23:54.558 align:start position:0%
might do
 
08:23:58.150 --> 08:23:58.160 align:start position:0%
in 1997 the supreme court ruled in
 
08:24:00.548 --> 08:24:00.558 align:start position:0%
prince versus the united states that
 
08:24:02.868 --> 08:24:02.878 align:start position:0%
congress cannot make the states enforce
 
08:24:05.510 --> 08:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
the federal brady gun control law which
 
08:24:08.708 --> 08:24:08.718 align:start position:0%
attempted to require local sheriffs or
 
08:24:11.590 --> 08:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
police to carry out background checks
 
08:24:15.190 --> 08:24:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
08:24:17.750 --> 08:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
i recommend we pass this bill and stand
 
08:24:19.910 --> 08:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
with other states progressive
 
08:24:22.948 --> 08:24:22.958 align:start position:0%
conservative and in between so that the
 
08:24:26.230 --> 08:24:26.240 align:start position:0%
movement to reset the balance between
 
08:24:27.830 --> 08:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
the federal government and the
 
08:24:31.350 --> 08:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
individual states can continue to grow
 
08:24:33.350 --> 08:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
i think we should stand together with
 
08:24:35.110 --> 08:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
all these other states that are saying
 
08:24:37.110 --> 08:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
to the federal government
 
08:24:40.070 --> 08:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
we are proudly american
 
08:24:43.110 --> 08:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
08:24:46.308 --> 08:24:46.318 align:start position:0%
 
08:24:48.308 --> 08:24:48.318 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the majority
 
08:24:50.868 --> 08:24:50.878 align:start position:0%
report of ought to pass house bill
 
08:24:50.878 --> 08:24:53.350 align:start position:0%
report of ought to pass house bill
1455.

08:24:53.350 --> 08:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
1455.
 
08:24:55.350 --> 08:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
this is going to be a roll call vote
 
08:25:29.750 --> 08:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
08:25:31.510 --> 08:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the majority
 
08:25:34.948 --> 08:25:34.958 align:start position:0%

08:25:42.388 --> 08:25:42.398 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker mr speaker if i
 
08:25:44.548 --> 08:25:44.558 align:start position:0%
know that this bill will prohibit the
 
08:25:46.308 --> 08:25:46.318 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
08:25:47.990 --> 08:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
from accrediting our health care
 
08:25:48.000 --> 08:25:49.510 align:start position:0%
from accrediting our health care
facilities

08:25:49.510 --> 08:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
08:25:50.788 --> 08:25:50.798 align:start position:0%
and if i know that that loss of
 
08:25:52.948 --> 08:25:52.958 align:start position:0%
accreditation will place in jeopardy the
 
08:25:55.510 --> 08:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
facility revenues from medicare medicaid
 
08:25:58.150 --> 08:25:58.160 align:start position:0%
and private insurers
 
08:25:59.750 --> 08:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
and if i know that the loss of revenue
 
08:26:02.308 --> 08:26:02.318 align:start position:0%
will require the state and the counties
 
08:26:04.388 --> 08:26:04.398 align:start position:0%
to backfill a couple of hundred million
 
08:26:06.388 --> 08:26:06.398 align:start position:0%
dollars annually just to keep our
 
08:26:08.948 --> 08:26:08.958 align:start position:0%
hospitals and nursing homes open
 
08:26:10.628 --> 08:26:10.638 align:start position:0%
and if i know that it might be a bit of
 
08:26:11.910 --> 08:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
a stretch
 
08:26:14.948 --> 08:26:14.958 align:start position:0%

delegated by the constitution

fugitive slaves to immigration policy to

immediately
 
08:36:50.230 --> 08:36:50.240 align:start position:0%
when we started listening to this we ran
 
08:36:52.788 --> 08:36:52.798 align:start position:0%
up to the usual problem
 
08:36:55.830 --> 08:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
one of the things that the state might
 
08:36:57.750 --> 08:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
be doing is
 
08:37:00.788 --> 08:37:00.798 align:start position:0%

homes

08:37:04.070 --> 08:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
and they are
 
08:37:06.468 --> 08:37:06.478 align:start position:0%
contracted with the federal government
 
08:37:09.030 --> 08:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
to enforce certain federal mandates
 
08:37:11.350 --> 08:37:11.360 align:start position:0%
because of the centers for medicare and
 
08:37:11.360 --> 08:37:13.110 align:start position:0%
because of the centers for medicare and
medicaid

08:37:13.110 --> 08:37:13.120 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
08:37:15.670 --> 08:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
and the majority amendment actually
 
08:37:18.468 --> 08:37:18.478 align:start position:0%
recognizes this might be a problem and
 
08:37:20.948 --> 08:37:20.958 align:start position:0%
carved that out as an exception to their
 
08:37:20.958 --> 08:37:22.230 align:start position:0%
carved that out as an exception to their
amendment

08:37:22.230 --> 08:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
08:37:25.830 --> 08:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
so that was a plus with the amendment
 
08:37:28.788 --> 08:37:28.798 align:start position:0%
on the other hand the amendment also
 
08:37:31.990 --> 08:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
broadened the state's
 
08:37:34.868 --> 08:37:34.878 align:start position:0%
prohibition from enforcing any mandate
 
08:37:34.878 --> 08:37:35.830 align:start position:0%
prohibition from enforcing any mandate
or

08:37:35.830 --> 08:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
or
 
08:37:38.230 --> 08:37:38.240 align:start position:0%
seeing any documentation
 
08:37:41.030 --> 08:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
on any business at all in the state of
 
08:37:43.030 --> 08:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
08:37:45.910 --> 08:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
the concern that i have with that
 
08:37:48.388 --> 08:37:48.398 align:start position:0%
is that we already knew
 
08:37:50.948 --> 08:37:50.958 align:start position:0%
there was a problem in one health care
 
08:37:53.350 --> 08:37:53.360 align:start position:0%
area with that
 
08:37:53.360 --> 08:37:54.308 align:start position:0%
area with that
and

08:37:54.308 --> 08:37:54.318 align:start position:0%
and
 
08:37:56.308 --> 08:37:56.318 align:start position:0%
we on the health and human services
 
08:37:58.708 --> 08:37:58.718 align:start position:0%
committee do not know what other
 
08:37:58.718 --> 08:38:00.708 align:start position:0%
committee do not know what other
conflicts

08:38:00.708 --> 08:38:00.718 align:start position:0%
conflicts
 
08:38:04.548 --> 08:38:04.558 align:start position:0%
we are creating with the breadth of this
 
08:38:07.030 --> 08:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
bill as it was amended
 
08:38:09.110 --> 08:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
or what is going to come to bite us in
 
08:38:11.030 --> 08:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
the future
 
08:38:11.040 --> 08:38:12.628 align:start position:0%
the future
so

08:38:12.628 --> 08:38:12.638 align:start position:0%
so
 
08:38:16.388 --> 08:38:16.398 align:start position:0%
i ask that you press the red button
 
08:38:16.398 --> 08:38:18.388 align:start position:0%
i ask that you press the red button
to

08:38:18.388 --> 08:38:18.398 align:start position:0%
to
 
08:38:20.948 --> 08:38:20.958 align:start position:0%
defeat the ought to pass with amendment
 
08:38:23.590 --> 08:38:23.600 align:start position:0%
get us out of what might be
 
08:38:26.070 --> 08:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of unintended consequences so
 
08:38:31.110 --> 08:38:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
08:38:33.830 --> 08:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
we are down to the last speaker
 
08:38:35.910 --> 08:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
representative blazik has requested a
 
08:38:39.510 --> 08:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
roll call is that sufficiently seconded
 
08:38:42.230 --> 08:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
this it is sufficiently seconded this is
 
08:38:44.388 --> 08:38:44.398 align:start position:0%
going to be a roll call vote members
 
08:38:48.070 --> 08:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
08:38:51.990 --> 08:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
08:38:54.070 --> 08:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
08:38:56.468 --> 08:38:56.478 align:start position:0%
i think we all know that last fall a lot
 
08:38:58.388 --> 08:38:58.398 align:start position:0%
of bills were filed because we weren't
 
08:39:01.350 --> 08:39:01.360 align:start position:0%
sure what this year would bring
 
08:39:04.230 --> 08:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
this amendment distills down
 
08:39:05.830 --> 08:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
a bill that was filed to some of the
 
08:39:07.910 --> 08:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
very core ideas
 
08:39:10.110 --> 08:39:10.120 align:start position:0%
the fact that the state should not be
 
08:39:13.030 --> 08:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
requiring businesses to act as their
 
08:39:14.948 --> 08:39:14.958 align:start position:0%
enforcement arm
 
08:39:16.708 --> 08:39:16.718 align:start position:0%
this doesn't prohibit businesses from
 
08:39:18.308 --> 08:39:18.318 align:start position:0%
making their own choice
 
08:39:20.150 --> 08:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
and those businesses that have different
 
08:39:22.468 --> 08:39:22.478 align:start position:0%
roles or regulations upon them
 
08:39:24.868 --> 08:39:24.878 align:start position:0%
probably have a reason to check on their
 
08:39:27.750 --> 08:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
own so that they can comply with
 
08:39:29.270 --> 08:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
whatever they believe is in their best
 
08:39:29.280 --> 08:39:31.430 align:start position:0%
whatever they believe is in their best
interest

08:39:31.430 --> 08:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
interest
 
08:39:33.110 --> 08:39:33.120 align:start position:0%
what this bill amendment this bill is
 
08:39:35.030 --> 08:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
amendment does
 
08:39:37.030 --> 08:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
is it says that the state
 
08:39:39.830 --> 08:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
and any subdivision can't require a
 
08:39:42.150 --> 08:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
business to check for vaccination
 
08:39:44.150 --> 08:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
except for the childhood immunization
 
08:39:44.160 --> 08:39:45.110 align:start position:0%
except for the childhood immunization
rules

08:39:45.110 --> 08:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
rules
 
08:39:46.948 --> 08:39:46.958 align:start position:0%
because if we ban that we'd get rid of
 
08:39:50.070 --> 08:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
child care and we don't want to do that
 
08:39:52.150 --> 08:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
it also says that we can't ask a
 
08:39:54.230 --> 08:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
business to check for documentation a
 
08:39:56.070 --> 08:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
vaccination status
 
08:39:59.190 --> 08:39:59.200 align:start position:0%
so we don't end up in the situation
 
08:40:01.510 --> 08:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
where in new york city mcdonald's was
 
08:40:03.830 --> 08:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
turning away customers from eating
 
08:40:05.590 --> 08:40:05.600 align:start position:0%
inside the building
 
08:40:10.788 --> 08:40:10.798 align:start position:0%
 
08:40:13.430 --> 08:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
and we have a curve out here
 
08:40:14.948 --> 08:40:14.958 align:start position:0%
we do have a carve out that says that
 
08:40:17.110 --> 08:40:17.120 align:start position:0%
this shall not apply to state agencies
 
08:40:20.468 --> 08:40:20.478 align:start position:0%
certifying a medical facility or private
 
08:40:23.670 --> 08:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
or provider which is subject to a valid
 
08:40:26.468 --> 08:40:26.478 align:start position:0%
and enforceable medicaid or medicare
 
08:40:29.110 --> 08:40:29.120 align:start position:0%
condition of participation that imposes
 
08:40:31.830 --> 08:40:31.840 align:start position:0%
a vaccination requirement
 
08:40:33.430 --> 08:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
this bill is simple
 
08:40:35.670 --> 08:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
it makes it so that businesses won't be
 
08:40:38.150 --> 08:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
the enforcement arm of the state
 
08:40:40.070 --> 08:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
so i ask that you pass this bill by
 
08:40:43.670 --> 08:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
08:40:45.590 --> 08:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
motion before us
 
08:40:47.750 --> 08:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
is to ought to pass as amended on house
 
08:40:50.150 --> 08:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
bill 1445.
 
08:40:52.868 --> 08:40:52.878 align:start position:0%
this is a roll call vote members take
 
08:41:06.868 --> 08:41:06.878 align:start position:0%
 
08:41:27.030 --> 08:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
08:41:29.030 --> 08:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the majority
 
08:41:32.948 --> 08:41:32.958 align:start position:0%
report of auto passes amended on 1445
 
08:41:35.110 --> 08:41:35.120 align:start position:0%
this is a roll call vote the chair
 
08:41:36.788 --> 08:41:36.798 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative webber for a
 
08:41:39.590 --> 08:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry
 
08:41:41.830 --> 08:41:41.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
08:41:44.070 --> 08:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know that this bill is
 
08:41:48.788 --> 08:41:48.798 align:start position:0%
 
08:41:52.548 --> 08:41:52.558 align:start position:0%
folks with government contracts
 
08:41:53.750 --> 08:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
and that
 
08:41:53.760 --> 08:41:54.628 align:start position:0%
and that
the

08:41:54.628 --> 08:41:54.638 align:start position:0%
the
 
08:41:57.910 --> 08:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
amendment broadened it to include any
 
08:42:00.308 --> 08:42:00.318 align:start position:0%
business in the state
 
08:42:02.150 --> 08:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
and if i know that
 
08:42:04.548 --> 08:42:04.558 align:start position:0%
we already found one problem that was
 
08:42:06.548 --> 08:42:06.558 align:start position:0%
fixed in amendment
 
08:42:08.308 --> 08:42:08.318 align:start position:0%
but we don't know what other problems
 
08:42:10.070 --> 08:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
lurk out there because people didn't
 
08:42:11.990 --> 08:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
have notice to come and tell us about
 
08:42:12.000 --> 08:42:12.868 align:start position:0%
have notice to come and tell us about
them

08:42:12.868 --> 08:42:12.878 align:start position:0%
them
 
08:42:15.270 --> 08:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
would i now press the red button so
 
08:42:17.190 --> 08:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
another motion could be made
 
08:42:19.030 --> 08:42:19.040 align:start position:0%

with being state enforcement agencies
 
08:42:33.430 --> 08:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
and that a state mandated banning of
 
08:42:35.910 --> 08:42:35.920 align:start position:0%

reproductive justice meaning that all

08:47:08.230 --> 08:47:08.240 align:start position:0%
the resources and support to do so and
 
08:47:10.628 --> 08:47:10.638 align:start position:0%
if i know that that the vermont house

proposed in hb 1014
 
08:51:25.750 --> 08:51:25.760 align:start position:0%

the predominant way of conducting the

idea among granite staters and if i
 
08:52:28.628 --> 08:52:28.638 align:start position:0%
further know that this bill protects
 
08:52:30.388 --> 08:52:30.398 align:start position:0%
local control by simply providing
 
08:52:32.628 --> 08:52:32.638 align:start position:0%

housing crisis
 
09:01:31.510 --> 09:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
if i know that we need to be encouraging
 
09:01:33.510 --> 09:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
more landlords to enter into the market
 
09:01:35.190 --> 09:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
and not placing new burdens that would
 
09:01:36.948 --> 09:01:36.958 align:start position:0%
push them out of the market
 
09:01:39.030 --> 09:01:39.040 align:start position:0%
and if i know that hb 1291 would
 
09:01:41.030 --> 09:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
forcefully drive all landlords into

they unwillingly enter into contracts
 
09:01:51.750 --> 09:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
that they had no say in and if i believe
 
09:01:53.110 --> 09:01:53.120 align:start position:0%
that that would actually reduce the

recommendation of itl on hb 1477.
 
09:10:22.470 --> 09:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that would ban abortion
 
09:10:24.790 --> 09:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
after the detection of a fetal heartbeat
 
09:10:27.990 --> 09:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
as defined as cardiac activity or the
 
09:10:30.630 --> 09:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
steady repetitive rhythmic contraction
 
09:10:33.748 --> 09:10:33.758 align:start position:0%
 
09:10:36.388 --> 09:10:36.398 align:start position:0%
one of the things that the roe versus
 
09:10:38.790 --> 09:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
wade decision sought to explore
 
09:10:41.990 --> 09:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
was where life begins and they went and
 
09:10:43.588 --> 09:10:43.598 align:start position:0%
they looked at the many religious
 
09:10:45.748 --> 09:10:45.758 align:start position:0%
beliefs practiced throughout the country
 
09:10:47.588 --> 09:10:47.598 align:start position:0%
and what they found was there was no
 
09:10:49.428 --> 09:10:49.438 align:start position:0%
consistency there was a great amount of
 
09:10:51.268 --> 09:10:51.278 align:start position:0%
disagreement within those beliefs and so
 
09:10:53.588 --> 09:10:53.598 align:start position:0%
you couldn't just settle in on one faith
 
09:10:55.748 --> 09:10:55.758 align:start position:0%
so putting religion aside
 
09:10:57.428 --> 09:10:57.438 align:start position:0%
they also went and they found that
 
09:11:01.510 --> 09:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
doctors had many varying views as well
 
09:11:04.068 --> 09:11:04.078 align:start position:0%
but one area of agreement however was
 
09:11:07.030 --> 09:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
that most doctors tended to believe that
 
09:11:09.510 --> 09:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
life began at some time
 
09:11:09.520 --> 09:11:10.470 align:start position:0%
life began at some time
before

09:11:10.470 --> 09:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
before
 
09:11:10.480 --> 09:11:11.510 align:start position:0%
before
birth

09:11:11.510 --> 09:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
birth
 
09:11:13.428 --> 09:11:13.438 align:start position:0%
and it's for that reason that the royal
 
09:11:15.268 --> 09:11:15.278 align:start position:0%
court held
 
09:11:17.112 --> 09:11:17.122 align:start position:0%
that the right to abortion was not
 
09:11:17.122 --> 09:11:18.310 align:start position:0%
that the right to abortion was not
absolute

09:11:18.310 --> 09:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
absolute
 
09:11:20.068 --> 09:11:20.078 align:start position:0%
and it tried to balance a woman's right
 
09:11:22.630 --> 09:11:22.640 align:start position:0%
to privacy and the fetus's right to
 
09:11:22.640 --> 09:11:24.150 align:start position:0%
to privacy and the fetus's right to
exist

09:11:24.150 --> 09:11:24.160 align:start position:0%
exist
 
09:11:27.190 --> 09:11:27.200 align:start position:0%
hb 1477 simply looks at all the
 
09:11:27.200 --> 09:11:28.388 align:start position:0%
hb 1477 simply looks at all the
scientific

09:11:28.388 --> 09:11:28.398 align:start position:0%
scientific
 
09:11:30.868 --> 09:11:30.878 align:start position:0%
information that was not available to
 
09:11:33.350 --> 09:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
the royal court 50 years ago and it
 
09:11:34.708 --> 09:11:34.718 align:start position:0%
asked the question
 
09:11:37.030 --> 09:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
does life begin earlier than the row
 
09:11:40.150 --> 09:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
court thought and does that enhance the
 
09:11:43.190 --> 09:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
right of the fetus to maintain his or
 
09:11:45.670 --> 09:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
her life
 
09:11:47.030 --> 09:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
we now know a lot more about the
 
09:11:48.868 --> 09:11:48.878 align:start position:0%
complexities of fetal development than
 
09:11:51.510 --> 09:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
the royal court could ever imagine
 
09:11:53.190 --> 09:11:53.200 align:start position:0%
and in light of that expanded knowledge
 
09:11:55.190 --> 09:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
the minority felt that while the rights
 
09:11:57.990 --> 09:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
of the mother are undiminished
 
09:12:00.228 --> 09:12:00.238 align:start position:0%
the rights of the fetus are elevated to
 
09:12:02.708 --> 09:12:02.718 align:start position:0%
a point where its status must be
 
09:12:02.718 --> 09:12:04.470 align:start position:0%
a point where its status must be
reconsidered

09:12:04.470 --> 09:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
reconsidered
 
09:12:06.228 --> 09:12:06.238 align:start position:0%
at the stage of life defined in this
 
09:12:08.228 --> 09:12:08.238 align:start position:0%
bill where a fetal heartbeat has been
 
09:12:10.548 --> 09:12:10.558 align:start position:0%
detected the minority felt that the
 
09:12:12.548 --> 09:12:12.558 align:start position:0%
development had advanced to the point
 
09:12:14.310 --> 09:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
where the fetus's status as an
 
09:12:16.790 --> 09:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
individual human entity has been
 
09:12:18.708 --> 09:12:18.718 align:start position:0%

09:13:18.950 --> 09:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
bill to pass it would essentially
 
09:13:21.428 --> 09:13:21.438 align:start position:0%
end access to abortion in new hampshire
 
09:13:24.150 --> 09:13:24.160 align:start position:0%
as it is being on abortion at around six
 
09:13:24.160 --> 09:13:25.670 align:start position:0%
as it is being on abortion at around six
weeks

09:13:25.670 --> 09:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
09:13:27.830 --> 09:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
only two weeks after a woman's first
 
09:13:29.428 --> 09:13:29.438 align:start position:0%
missed menses
 
09:13:32.310 --> 09:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
a time when many women have not even do
 
09:13:35.350 --> 09:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
not even know that she's pregnant to put
 
09:13:36.950 --> 09:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
it in another way
 
09:13:38.630 --> 09:13:38.640 align:start position:0%
this bill could take away a woman's
 
09:13:41.190 --> 09:13:41.200 align:start position:0%
right to make her own medical decision
 
09:13:43.350 --> 09:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
before she even knows that she has a
 
09:13:45.350 --> 09:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
decision to make
 
09:13:47.908 --> 09:13:47.918 align:start position:0%
house bill 1477
 
09:13:49.990 --> 09:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
is wildly out of step with the granite
 
09:13:51.428 --> 09:13:51.438 align:start position:0%
state values
 
09:13:54.630 --> 09:13:54.640 align:start position:0%
abortion bans are deeply held
 
09:13:57.190 --> 09:13:57.200 align:start position:0%
popular view in new hampshire
 
09:14:00.548 --> 09:14:00.558 align:start position:0%
instead we've had a lot we've had a long
 
09:14:02.630 --> 09:14:02.640 align:start position:0%
bipartisan tradition of supporting
 
09:14:04.470 --> 09:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
reproductive freedom
 
09:14:07.190 --> 09:14:07.200 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of granite staters
 
09:14:08.950 --> 09:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
believe that personal
 
09:14:11.350 --> 09:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
private medical decisions should be
 
09:14:13.908 --> 09:14:13.918 align:start position:0%
between the individual and the doctor
 
09:14:17.510 --> 09:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
not the individual and politicians
 
09:14:19.112 --> 09:14:19.122 align:start position:0%
we can all agree
 
09:14:21.588 --> 09:14:21.598 align:start position:0%
grant staters deserve access to the best
 
09:14:23.510 --> 09:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
medical care available
 
09:14:26.950 --> 09:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
without shame or government interference
 
09:14:29.190 --> 09:14:29.200 align:start position:0%
if this bill were to pass that would no
 
09:14:31.670 --> 09:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
longer be the case for a woman seeking
 
09:14:33.350 --> 09:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
abortion care
 
09:14:35.268 --> 09:14:35.278 align:start position:0%
passage of this bill
 
09:14:37.670 --> 09:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
would force a woman who cannot who can
 
09:14:40.068 --> 09:14:40.078 align:start position:0%
afford an abortion to leave and go out
 
09:14:41.112 --> 09:14:41.122 align:start position:0%
of state
 
09:14:43.112 --> 09:14:43.122 align:start position:0%
for those women who could not travel out
 
09:14:46.068 --> 09:14:46.078 align:start position:0%
of state due to lack of finances or
 
09:14:46.078 --> 09:14:47.588 align:start position:0%
of state due to lack of finances or
transportation

09:14:47.588 --> 09:14:47.598 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
09:14:49.428 --> 09:14:49.438 align:start position:0%
she would be forced to remain pregnant
 
09:14:51.670 --> 09:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
against her will
 
09:14:54.868 --> 09:14:54.878 align:start position:0%
further this would rob her of the trust
 
09:14:56.950 --> 09:14:56.960 align:start position:0%
the guidance and the expertise of the
 
09:14:59.428 --> 09:14:59.438 align:start position:0%
competent medical professional she had
 
09:14:59.438 --> 09:15:00.790 align:start position:0%
competent medical professional she had
selected

09:15:00.790 --> 09:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
selected
 
09:15:03.268 --> 09:15:03.278 align:start position:0%
when making with her partner if she cho
 
09:15:06.310 --> 09:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
so chooses one of the most intimate and
 
09:15:09.830 --> 09:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
personal of life's decisions
 
09:15:11.830 --> 09:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
instead instead the decision would
 
09:15:14.228 --> 09:15:14.238 align:start position:0%
follow a predetermined path that had
 
09:15:19.990 --> 09:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
09:15:20.000 --> 09:15:20.950 align:start position:0%
 
finally

09:15:20.950 --> 09:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
finally
 
09:15:23.030 --> 09:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
we don't have to imagine the impact of
 
09:15:25.670 --> 09:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
this abortion bill we can simply look to
 
09:15:28.310 --> 09:15:28.320 align:start position:0%

as we contemplate creating another
 
09:23:09.030 --> 09:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
category of a protected class
 
09:23:10.630 --> 09:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
it's worth considering the other
 
09:23:12.950 --> 09:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
enumerated classes already protected
 
09:23:14.550 --> 09:23:14.560 align:start position:0%
against discrimination to which
 
09:23:16.830 --> 09:23:16.840 align:start position:0%
vaccination status would be
 
09:23:19.030 --> 09:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
added existing law prohibits
 
09:23:20.950 --> 09:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
discrimination and public accommodations
 
09:23:23.586 --> 09:23:23.596 align:start position:0%
based on categories such as age
 
09:23:23.596 --> 09:23:24.870 align:start position:0%
based on categories such as age
sex

09:23:24.870 --> 09:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
sex
 
09:23:27.266 --> 09:23:27.276 align:start position:0%
gender identity or race
 
09:23:28.950 --> 09:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
these are protected because
 
09:23:31.350 --> 09:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
unfortunately they have faced a long
 
09:23:33.906 --> 09:23:33.916 align:start position:0%
history of discrimination in exercising
 
09:23:35.670 --> 09:23:35.680 align:start position:0%
the civil rights
 
09:23:38.550 --> 09:23:38.560 align:start position:0%
in this light adding vaccination status
 
09:23:41.830 --> 09:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
as a protected class seems a historical
 
09:23:43.906 --> 09:23:43.916 align:start position:0%
and misplaced
 
09:23:45.426 --> 09:23:45.436 align:start position:0%
but beyond that it's worth thinking
 
09:23:47.670 --> 09:23:47.680 align:start position:0%
about the purpose and context of the
 
09:23:50.470 --> 09:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
state's anti-discrimination statute
 
09:23:53.906 --> 09:23:53.916 align:start position:0%
rsa 354-a where this bill would rest if
 
09:23:55.426 --> 09:23:55.436 align:start position:0%
it became law
 
09:23:57.190 --> 09:23:57.200 align:start position:0%
was enacted under the state's police
 
09:23:59.190 --> 09:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
powers to protect the welfare and health
 
09:24:00.550 --> 09:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
of our citizens
 
09:24:02.870 --> 09:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
yet this bill if enacted
 
09:24:04.710 --> 09:24:04.720 align:start position:0%
would threaten public health rather than
 
09:24:06.390 --> 09:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
protect it
 
09:24:07.670 --> 09:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
for example this bill would be
 
09:24:09.110 --> 09:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
enforceable against health care
 
09:24:11.830 --> 09:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
providers creating a scenario whereby
 
09:24:13.426 --> 09:24:13.436 align:start position:0%
these providers could not require
 
09:24:13.436 --> 09:24:14.630 align:start position:0%
these providers could not require
vaccines

09:24:14.630 --> 09:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
vaccines
 
09:24:16.630 --> 09:24:16.640 align:start position:0%
or even masks perhaps
 
09:24:19.350 --> 09:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
thus potentially exposing employees and
 
09:24:21.190 --> 09:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
patients to lethal
 
09:24:23.110 --> 09:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
but preventable diseases such as covet
 
09:24:23.120 --> 09:24:24.710 align:start position:0%
but preventable diseases such as covet
19.

09:24:24.710 --> 09:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
19.
 
09:24:26.830 --> 09:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
indeed at committee healthcare providers
 
09:24:29.190 --> 09:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
testified that the threat that this bill
 
09:24:31.190 --> 09:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
represents to their ability to
 
09:24:32.790 --> 09:24:32.800 align:start position:0%
effectively protect
 
09:24:34.950 --> 09:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
their employees and patients health and
 
09:24:34.960 --> 09:24:36.150 align:start position:0%
their employees and patients health and
safety

09:24:36.150 --> 09:24:36.160 align:start position:0%
safety
 
09:24:38.150 --> 09:24:38.160 align:start position:0%
surely such a result is at cross
 
09:24:40.790 --> 09:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
purposes with the legislative intent of
 
09:24:43.990 --> 09:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
rsa rsa354a to protect
 
09:24:45.586 --> 09:24:45.596 align:start position:0%
the public safety and welfare of our
 
09:24:45.596 --> 09:24:47.110 align:start position:0%
the public safety and welfare of our
citizens

09:24:47.110 --> 09:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
09:24:48.710 --> 09:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
and finally this bill suffers from
 
09:24:51.426 --> 09:24:51.436 align:start position:0%
significant definitional shortcomings
 
09:24:53.426 --> 09:24:53.436 align:start position:0%
both vaccination status
 
09:24:55.510 --> 09:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
and medical devices the operative terms
 
09:24:57.830 --> 09:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
of the bill are undefined
 
09:24:59.746 --> 09:24:59.756 align:start position:0%
the department of justice noted that
 
09:25:01.830 --> 09:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
this vagueness would lead to an increase
 
09:25:04.390 --> 09:25:04.400 align:start position:0%
in complaints under the law
 
09:25:06.710 --> 09:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
diverting scarce resources to resolving
 
09:25:08.470 --> 09:25:08.480 align:start position:0%
the meaning and application of these
 
09:25:08.480 --> 09:25:09.350 align:start position:0%
the meaning and application of these
terms

09:25:09.350 --> 09:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
terms
 
09:25:11.030 --> 09:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
i urge you to oppose the committee's
 
09:25:15.990 --> 09:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
09:25:25.830 --> 09:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
09:25:27.510 --> 09:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
09:25:29.030 --> 09:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if there's anything we've
 
09:25:30.790 --> 09:25:30.800 align:start position:0%
heard about
 
09:25:33.990 --> 09:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
today and for the last couple of years
 
09:25:39.030 --> 09:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
09:25:41.586 --> 09:25:41.596 align:start position:0%
and can i be forced to get it
 
09:25:45.670 --> 09:25:45.680 align:start position:0%
in masks and do i have to wear them
 
09:25:52.070 --> 09:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
09:25:54.550 --> 09:25:54.560 align:start position:0%
mr speaker we looked at this
 
09:25:58.790 --> 09:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
09:26:04.830 --> 09:26:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
09:26:07.350 --> 09:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
might go ahead get any other advice or
 
09:26:12.070 --> 09:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
09:26:13.746 --> 09:26:13.756 align:start position:0%
we had other bills that dealt with the
 
09:26:13.756 --> 09:26:14.710 align:start position:0%
we had other bills that dealt with the
same

09:26:14.710 --> 09:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
same
 
09:26:16.230 --> 09:26:16.240 align:start position:0%
topic and you've heard a lot about it
 
09:26:17.990 --> 09:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
today about rights about to be
 
09:26:19.906 --> 09:26:19.916 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and conscious rights and all
 
09:26:21.746 --> 09:26:21.756 align:start position:0%
of that
 
09:26:21.756 --> 09:26:23.426 align:start position:0%
of that
we

09:26:23.426 --> 09:26:23.436 align:start position:0%
we
 
09:26:23.436 --> 09:26:24.870 align:start position:0%
we
chose

09:26:24.870 --> 09:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
chose
 
09:26:27.670 --> 09:26:27.680 align:start position:0%
to bring this one bill forward
 
09:26:29.510 --> 09:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
dealing narrowly with public
 
09:26:29.520 --> 09:26:31.426 align:start position:0%
dealing narrowly with public
accommodation

09:26:31.426 --> 09:26:31.436 align:start position:0%
accommodation
 
09:26:34.470 --> 09:26:34.480 align:start position:0%
because we hear a testimony mr speaker
 
09:26:36.070 --> 09:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
of people who couldn't go buy their
 
09:26:36.080 --> 09:26:37.670 align:start position:0%
of people who couldn't go buy their
groceries

09:26:37.670 --> 09:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
groceries
 
09:26:39.906 --> 09:26:39.916 align:start position:0%
because they couldn't wear masks for
 
09:26:42.790 --> 09:26:42.800 align:start position:0%
medical reasons the medical device i
 
09:26:43.906 --> 09:26:43.916 align:start position:0%
spent quite a bit of time trying to
 
09:26:45.510 --> 09:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
figure out what kind of medical devices
 
09:26:46.830 --> 09:26:46.840 align:start position:0%
could apply
 
09:26:49.426 --> 09:26:49.436 align:start position:0%
to and the mask was the only one i could
 
09:26:50.550 --> 09:26:50.560 align:start position:0%
come up with
 
09:26:58.230 --> 09:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
09:27:00.470 --> 09:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
you can have it all right so so it
 
09:27:01.906 --> 09:27:01.916 align:start position:0%
applies to mass and applies to
 
09:27:03.746 --> 09:27:03.756 align:start position:0%
vaccination status
 
09:27:05.670 --> 09:27:05.680 align:start position:0%
and we just believe that vaccination
 
09:27:07.190 --> 09:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
status is
 
09:27:09.266 --> 09:27:09.276 align:start position:0%
a part of your personal privacy a part
 
09:27:11.110 --> 09:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
of your medical privacy and you should
 
09:27:13.190 --> 09:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
not have to disclose that
 
09:27:15.030 --> 09:27:15.040 align:start position:0%
to use public accommodations whether
 
09:27:17.830 --> 09:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
it's a bus
 
09:27:19.586 --> 09:27:19.596 align:start position:0%
or anything else
 
09:27:21.350 --> 09:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
so for that reason mr speaker i
 
09:27:23.426 --> 09:27:23.436 align:start position:0%
recommend we pass house bill
 
09:27:23.436 --> 09:27:30.870 align:start position:0%
recommend we pass house bill
1490.

09:27:30.870 --> 09:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
09:27:32.390 --> 09:27:32.400 align:start position:0%
roll call has been requested by
 
09:27:33.670 --> 09:27:33.680 align:start position:0%
representative silber is that
 
09:27:36.630 --> 09:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
sufficiently seconded it is sufficiently
 
09:27:38.550 --> 09:27:38.560 align:start position:0%
seconded this will be a roll call vote
 
09:27:49.266 --> 09:27:49.276 align:start position:0%
 
09:27:49.276 --> 09:28:07.990 align:start position:0%
 
so

09:28:07.990 --> 09:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
09:28:08.000 --> 09:28:34.870 align:start position:0%
 
so

09:28:34.870 --> 09:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
09:28:36.870 --> 09:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
members take your seats this is a roll
 
09:29:00.390 --> 09:29:00.400 align:start position:0%

guys

09:29:08.630 --> 09:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
09:29:10.550 --> 09:29:10.560 align:start position:0%

thank you thank you mr speaker
 
09:29:33.266 --> 09:29:33.276 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know adding vaccination
 
09:29:35.990 --> 09:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
status to new hampshire law recognizing
 
09:29:39.030 --> 09:29:39.040 align:start position:0%
vaccine status as a protected class
 
09:29:41.110 --> 09:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
is an overreach and a questionable
 
09:29:44.150 --> 09:29:44.160 align:start position:0%
precedent and if i also know defining
 
09:29:46.790 --> 09:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
vaccine status as a protected class
 
09:29:49.350 --> 09:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
under the civil rights act would make it
 
09:29:51.830 --> 09:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
impossible for health officials
 
09:29:54.710 --> 09:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
to monitor disease outbreaks and finally
 
09:29:56.630 --> 09:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know
 
09:29:59.230 --> 09:29:59.240 align:start position:0%
adding vaccination status to
 
09:30:01.670 --> 09:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination legislation would
 
09:30:03.830 --> 09:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
limit the tools
 
09:30:06.070 --> 09:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
and data available to the state's public

people should be poking around

agree with the majority report the
 
09:36:17.110 --> 09:36:17.120 align:start position:0%
recommendation that the bill ought to
 
09:36:18.790 --> 09:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
pass representative mark mclean from the

thank you mr speaker
 
09:36:36.550 --> 09:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
mr speaker
 
09:36:38.390 --> 09:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
the minority of the house judiciary
 
09:36:41.350 --> 09:36:41.360 align:start position:0%
committee felt that hb 1625
 
09:36:43.746 --> 09:36:43.756 align:start position:0%
a bill repealing the new hampshire law
 
09:36:45.670 --> 09:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
prohibiting people from being present on
 
09:36:48.710 --> 09:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
a public way adjacent to a reproductive
 
09:36:52.230 --> 09:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
health facility is long overdue
 
09:36:54.710 --> 09:36:54.720 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire buffer zone law was
 
09:36:57.510 --> 09:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
enacted in 2014
 
09:36:59.990 --> 09:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
and it's modeled after and largely
 
09:37:01.510 --> 09:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
similar to
 
09:37:04.390 --> 09:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
a massachusetts law that the u.s supreme
 
09:37:07.746 --> 09:37:07.756 align:start position:0%
court struck down in june of that year
 
09:37:10.870 --> 09:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
now the supreme court
 
09:37:13.426 --> 09:37:13.436 align:start position:0%
was unanimous in its ruling that
 
09:37:15.190 --> 09:37:15.200 align:start position:0%
extending a buffer zone from clinic
 
09:37:17.990 --> 09:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
entrances was a violation of the first
 
09:37:20.390 --> 09:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
amendment rights of those that sought to
 
09:37:23.426 --> 09:37:23.436 align:start position:0%
protest or offer counseling outside
 
09:37:23.436 --> 09:37:25.510 align:start position:0%
protest or offer counseling outside
facilities

09:37:25.510 --> 09:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
09:37:28.950 --> 09:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
chief justice roberts in his opinion
 
09:37:32.150 --> 09:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
stated that authorities have many less
 
09:37:34.310 --> 09:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
intrusive ways to deal with problems
 
09:37:36.070 --> 09:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
outside the clinics
 
09:37:37.586 --> 09:37:37.596 align:start position:0%
and the committee heard testimony that
 
09:37:40.550 --> 09:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
existing criminal threatening laws are
 
09:37:42.870 --> 09:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
more than adequate to deal with most
 
09:37:45.190 --> 09:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
problems that arise
 
09:37:48.310 --> 09:37:48.320 align:start position:0%
given the constitutional issues plaguing
 
09:37:49.510 --> 09:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
this law
 
09:37:51.906 --> 09:37:51.916 align:start position:0%
one might ask the question
 
09:37:53.990 --> 09:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
why hasn't it been struck down like the
 
09:37:55.906 --> 09:37:55.916 align:start position:0%
massachusetts law was struck down and
 
09:37:57.746 --> 09:37:57.756 align:start position:0%
the reason is simple
 
09:38:00.950 --> 09:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
after more than seven years no abortion
 
09:38:03.266 --> 09:38:03.276 align:start position:0%
clinic or reproductive health facility
 
09:38:06.150 --> 09:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire has ever
 
09:38:09.670 --> 09:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
implemented its provisions ever
 
09:38:10.950 --> 09:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
as a result
 
09:38:13.586 --> 09:38:13.596 align:start position:0%
no one has ever had standing to take it
 
09:38:15.906 --> 09:38:15.916 align:start position:0%
to court so let that sink in for a
 
09:38:17.586 --> 09:38:17.596 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
09:38:19.906 --> 09:38:19.916 align:start position:0%
supporters of the bill repeatedly
 
09:38:23.670 --> 09:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
stressed its urgent need as a tool to
 
09:38:25.670 --> 09:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
keep clinics safe
 
09:38:27.110 --> 09:38:27.120 align:start position:0%
and yet
 
09:38:28.790 --> 09:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
having won the day
 
09:38:31.746 --> 09:38:31.756 align:start position:0%
they never implemented the law that they
 
09:38:34.230 --> 09:38:34.240 align:start position:0%
had fought so hard for
 
09:38:35.510 --> 09:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
every effort
 
09:38:36.710 --> 09:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
at appeal
 
09:38:38.870 --> 09:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
has led to a great outcry that women and
 
09:38:40.390 --> 09:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
clinic staff
 
09:38:43.110 --> 09:38:43.120 align:start position:0%
would be subjected to increased danger
 
09:38:45.190 --> 09:38:45.200 align:start position:0%
if a repeal were successful well guess
 
09:38:45.200 --> 09:38:46.310 align:start position:0%
if a repeal were successful well guess
what

09:38:46.310 --> 09:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
what
 
09:38:49.426 --> 09:38:49.436 align:start position:0%
the repeals were never successful they
 
09:38:52.870 --> 09:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
were always unsuccessful and still
 
09:38:55.266 --> 09:38:55.276 align:start position:0%
the provisions of the law were never
 
09:38:58.150 --> 09:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
implemented so let me ask you this
 
09:39:00.550 --> 09:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
how can removing something that has
 
09:39:03.586 --> 09:39:03.596 align:start position:0%
never been implemented after seven years
 
09:39:08.310 --> 09:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
09:39:11.350 --> 09:39:11.360 align:start position:0%
in this legislature we should not seek
 
09:39:13.230 --> 09:39:13.240 align:start position:0%
to burden the state with an
 
09:39:15.510 --> 09:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional law that looks to
 
09:39:17.350 --> 09:39:17.360 align:start position:0%
inhibit the rights of our people to
 
09:39:17.360 --> 09:39:18.630 align:start position:0%
inhibit the rights of our people to
peacefully

09:39:18.630 --> 09:39:18.640 align:start position:0%
peacefully
 
09:39:20.870 --> 09:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
and prayerfully express themselves
 
09:39:23.190 --> 09:39:23.200 align:start position:0%
this is especially the case
 
09:39:26.710 --> 09:39:26.720 align:start position:0%
when the law in question by its ongoing
 
09:39:30.070 --> 09:39:30.080 align:start position:0%
inaction turns a blind eye to the very
 
09:39:33.266 --> 09:39:33.276 align:start position:0%
people it purports to serve
 
09:39:36.150 --> 09:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
it's time for repeal and i hope you will
 
09:39:38.230 --> 09:39:38.240 align:start position:0%
join with me in overturning the itl
 
09:39:40.470 --> 09:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
motion on this bill so the motion of
 
09:39:42.550 --> 09:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
ought to pass can be brought forward
 
09:39:45.670 --> 09:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
09:39:47.586 --> 09:39:47.596 align:start position:0%
representative notter has requested a
 
09:39:49.426 --> 09:39:49.436 align:start position:0%
roll call we're down to the last speaker
 
09:39:52.470 --> 09:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
is that sufficiently seconded
 
09:39:54.230 --> 09:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
it is sufficiently seconded this is
 
09:39:56.150 --> 09:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
going to be a roll call vote members
 
09:40:03.586 --> 09:40:03.596 align:start position:0%
 
09:40:08.710 --> 09:40:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
09:40:13.266 --> 09:40:13.276 align:start position:0%
 
09:40:15.990 --> 09:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
i rise today to speak in favor
 
09:40:17.586 --> 09:40:17.596 align:start position:0%
of the bipartisan majority
 
09:40:20.746 --> 09:40:20.756 align:start position:0%
recommendation of the judiciary that hb
 
09:40:24.630 --> 09:40:24.640 align:start position:0%
1625 is inexpedient to legislate
 
09:40:27.190 --> 09:40:27.200 align:start position:0%
as we've heard hb 1625 would repeal the
 
09:40:30.230 --> 09:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
state's current patient safety zone law
 
09:40:32.150 --> 09:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
which provides for a safety zone around
 
09:40:34.870 --> 09:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
reproductive health care facilities
 
09:40:36.950 --> 09:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
the bill is premised on the notion that
 
09:40:39.426 --> 09:40:39.436 align:start position:0%
our current law is unconstitutional
 
09:40:41.266 --> 09:40:41.276 align:start position:0%
because the u.s supreme court struck
 
09:40:44.230 --> 09:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
down a restrictive massachusetts law
 
09:40:45.906 --> 09:40:45.916 align:start position:0%
there are a few preliminary points to
 
09:40:48.230 --> 09:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
keep in mind that on their own make this
 
09:40:51.266 --> 09:40:51.276 align:start position:0%
bill an expedient to legislate to begin
 
09:40:51.276 --> 09:40:52.150 align:start position:0%
bill an expedient to legislate to begin
with

09:40:52.150 --> 09:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
with
 
09:40:54.790 --> 09:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
the question of constitutionality of our
 
09:40:57.426 --> 09:40:57.436 align:start position:0%
current law is one for the courts not
 
09:40:59.990 --> 09:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
this legislature to resolve
 
09:41:01.426 --> 09:41:01.436 align:start position:0%
in addition
 
09:41:03.510 --> 09:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
it is important to note that placing
 
09:41:05.266 --> 09:41:05.276 align:start position:0%
reasonable restrictions on first
 
09:41:07.350 --> 09:41:07.360 align:start position:0%
amendment rights in public spaces is
 
09:41:09.110 --> 09:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
nothing new in this state and many
 
09:41:09.120 --> 09:41:10.230 align:start position:0%
nothing new in this state and many
others

09:41:10.230 --> 09:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
others
 
09:41:13.030 --> 09:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
for example we have similar protective
 
09:41:14.830 --> 09:41:14.840 align:start position:0%
zones around entrances and polling
 
09:41:17.426 --> 09:41:17.436 align:start position:0%
places that permit voters to enter the
 
09:41:19.830 --> 09:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
voting booth without interference
 
09:41:22.230 --> 09:41:22.240 align:start position:0%
while also successfully preserving
 
09:41:24.950 --> 09:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
others first amendment rights
 
09:41:26.790 --> 09:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
but the fatal flaw in this bill is its
 
09:41:28.710 --> 09:41:28.720 align:start position:0%
reliance on the erroneous premise that
 
09:41:30.550 --> 09:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
because the u.s supreme court struck
 
09:41:33.030 --> 09:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
down massachusetts buffer zone law in a
 
09:41:35.790 --> 09:41:35.800 align:start position:0%
case known as mccullen our law is also
 
09:41:35.800 --> 09:41:37.350 align:start position:0%
case known as mccullen our law is also
unconstitutional

09:41:37.350 --> 09:41:37.360 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional
 
09:41:39.586 --> 09:41:39.596 align:start position:0%
but this misreads mccullen the
 
09:41:41.830 --> 09:41:41.840 align:start position:0%
massachusetts case as dictating that new
 
09:41:45.190 --> 09:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire must also repeal its law
 
09:41:46.790 --> 09:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
the real lesson from the mccullen
 
09:41:48.950 --> 09:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
massachusetts case is that there is no
 
09:41:51.030 --> 09:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
bright line supreme court
 
09:41:53.670 --> 09:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
test applicable to every state safety
 
09:41:55.030 --> 09:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
zone law
 
09:41:57.746 --> 09:41:57.756 align:start position:0%
each state statute must be evaluated on
 
09:41:58.950 --> 09:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
its own
 
09:42:01.190 --> 09:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
and different facts lead to different
 
09:42:01.200 --> 09:42:02.470 align:start position:0%
and different facts lead to different
outcomes

09:42:02.470 --> 09:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
outcomes
 
09:42:04.630 --> 09:42:04.640 align:start position:0%
for example the supreme court has upheld
 
09:42:07.110 --> 09:42:07.120 align:start position:0%
a colorado safety zone law and in
 
09:42:08.950 --> 09:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
january of 2021
 
09:42:11.030 --> 09:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
the court declined to hear a challenge
 
09:42:13.350 --> 09:42:13.360 align:start position:0%
to a pittsburgh ordinance providing a
 
09:42:16.230 --> 09:42:16.240 align:start position:0%
15-foot safety zone around reproductive
 
09:42:20.310 --> 09:42:20.320 align:start position:0%
facilities letting that ordinance stand
 
09:42:22.470 --> 09:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
but importantly the bipartisan
 
09:42:25.266 --> 09:42:25.276 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors of our current new hampshire
 
09:42:27.350 --> 09:42:27.360 align:start position:0%
patient safety zone law carefully
 
09:42:29.030 --> 09:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
crafted our law
 
09:42:31.350 --> 09:42:31.360 align:start position:0%
with attention to the issues raised in
 
09:42:33.190 --> 09:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
mccullen to which they had the benefit
 
09:42:35.030 --> 09:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
of hindsight review
 
09:42:37.906 --> 09:42:37.916 align:start position:0%
as a result new hampshire's current law
 
09:42:40.630 --> 09:42:40.640 align:start position:0%
which this bill would repeal does not
 
09:42:43.746 --> 09:42:43.756 align:start position:0%
create a mccullen problem but rather
 
09:42:45.830 --> 09:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
avoids one
 
09:42:47.670 --> 09:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
mccullen the supreme court found
 
09:42:49.586 --> 09:42:49.596 align:start position:0%
massachusetts approach too rigid and
 
09:42:49.596 --> 09:42:51.190 align:start position:0%
massachusetts approach too rigid and
extreme

09:42:51.190 --> 09:42:51.200 align:start position:0%
extreme
 
09:42:53.670 --> 09:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
that law mandated a 35-foot zone at
 
09:42:55.906 --> 09:42:55.916 align:start position:0%
every facility across that state
 
09:42:57.830 --> 09:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
and imposed both civil and criminal
 
09:43:00.870 --> 09:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
penalties including a jail term
 
09:43:02.950 --> 09:43:02.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire intentionally did not
 
09:43:04.710 --> 09:43:04.720 align:start position:0%
follow the massachusetts path when it
 
09:43:07.110 --> 09:43:07.120 align:start position:0%
enacted our current safety zone law to
 
09:43:09.906 --> 09:43:09.916 align:start position:0%
avoid any constitutional problems
 
09:43:11.990 --> 09:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
unlike the massachusetts statute our
 
09:43:14.150 --> 09:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
current law does not mandate that every
 
09:43:16.150 --> 09:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
reproductive health care facility
 
09:43:18.230 --> 09:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
establish a safety zone
 
09:43:20.150 --> 09:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
instead it enables
 
09:43:22.470 --> 09:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
their creation depending on the unique
 
09:43:24.630 --> 09:43:24.640 align:start position:0%
location and circumstances
 
09:43:26.710 --> 09:43:26.720 align:start position:0%
our current law does not require a fixed
 
09:43:29.266 --> 09:43:29.276 align:start position:0%
specified zone at every state it permits
 
09:43:32.390 --> 09:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
establishment of one up to 25 feet
 
09:43:35.426 --> 09:43:35.436 align:start position:0%
and unlike massachusetts our law imposes
 
09:43:38.390 --> 09:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
only civil penalties not criminal
 
09:43:40.630 --> 09:43:40.640 align:start position:0%
in some our law embeds the elasticity
 
09:43:42.470 --> 09:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
that the supreme court found lacking in
 
09:43:44.710 --> 09:43:44.720 align:start position:0%
massachusetts law
 
09:43:46.310 --> 09:43:46.320 align:start position:0%
in 2016 our attorney general
 
09:43:48.230 --> 09:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
successfully defended our patient safety
 
09:43:50.390 --> 09:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
zone law in ready versus foster where
 
09:43:51.426 --> 09:43:51.436 align:start position:0%
the federal district court of new
 
09:43:52.790 --> 09:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire concluded that the
 
09:43:54.790 --> 09:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
constitutionality of our law could only
 
09:43:56.470 --> 09:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
be rendered on the facts at the time of
 
09:43:58.630 --> 09:43:58.640 align:start position:0%
implementation when and if a health
 
09:44:01.190 --> 09:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
facility uses a safety zone
 
09:44:03.670 --> 09:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
put another way not only it is is it not
 
09:44:05.510 --> 09:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate for this branch to determine
 
09:44:07.746 --> 09:44:07.756 align:start position:0%
the constitutionality of our current law
 
09:44:10.790 --> 09:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
but it's also premature to do so
 
09:44:14.150 --> 09:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
finally it's not clear what problem this
 
09:44:15.670 --> 09:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
bill would fix
 
09:44:17.990 --> 09:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
indeed we heard committee testimony of
 
09:44:20.310 --> 09:44:20.320 align:start position:0%
people successfully engaging
 
09:44:21.830 --> 09:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
with women entering reproductive
 
09:44:23.990 --> 09:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
facilities suggesting that the current
 
09:44:26.390 --> 09:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
statutory framework strikes the right
 
09:44:28.870 --> 09:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
balance between competing rights and
 
09:44:30.630 --> 09:44:30.640 align:start position:0%
should not be disturbed
 
09:44:32.230 --> 09:44:32.240 align:start position:0%
i respectfully ask that you uphold the
 
09:44:33.586 --> 09:44:33.596 align:start position:0%
bipartisan recommendation of the
 
09:44:43.350 --> 09:44:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
09:44:47.266 --> 09:44:47.276 align:start position:0%
for what reason does the member rise
 
09:44:49.990 --> 09:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
i rise to make a motion mr speaker state
 
09:44:51.670 --> 09:44:51.680 align:start position:0%
your motion
 
09:44:56.790 --> 09:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
i would move to table house bill 16
 
09:44:56.800 --> 09:44:59.670 align:start position:0%
i would move to table house bill 16
25.

09:44:59.670 --> 09:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
25.
 
09:45:01.990 --> 09:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
that is a proper motion
 
09:45:04.390 --> 09:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is to table house
 
09:45:13.266 --> 09:45:13.276 align:start position:0%
 
09:45:15.670 --> 09:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
we don't have a we don't have any
 
09:45:21.190 --> 09:45:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
09:45:22.870 --> 09:45:22.880 align:start position:0%
representative nader has requested a
 
09:45:26.390 --> 09:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
roll call is that sufficiently seconded
 
09:45:28.310 --> 09:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
it is sufficiently seconded this will be
 
09:45:51.830 --> 09:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
09:46:00.710 --> 09:46:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
09:46:00.720 --> 09:46:12.230 align:start position:0%
 
so

09:46:12.230 --> 09:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
09:46:14.310 --> 09:46:14.320 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the table house
 
09:46:16.630 --> 09:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
bill 1625.
 
09:46:18.550 --> 09:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
this is a roll call vote chair
 
09:46:20.550 --> 09:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative marjorie smith
 
09:46:27.510 --> 09:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
09:46:29.746 --> 09:46:29.756 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker i'm honored to go
 
09:46:32.950 --> 09:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
first i expect always to follow
 
09:46:35.510 --> 09:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
um mr speaker
 
09:46:37.670 --> 09:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
if i know that consistency is the
 
09:46:42.310 --> 09:46:42.320 align:start position:0%
bugaboo of small minds but nevertheless
 
09:46:44.630 --> 09:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
believe that the same argument that i
 
09:46:48.310 --> 09:46:48.320 align:start position:0%
made 35 minutes ago is even more true
 
09:46:48.320 --> 09:46:49.510 align:start position:0%
made 35 minutes ago is even more true
now

09:46:49.510 --> 09:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
now
 
09:46:53.266 --> 09:46:53.276 align:start position:0%
in that this issue is so important to so
 
09:46:54.790 --> 09:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
many people
 
09:46:57.266 --> 09:46:57.276 align:start position:0%
that we should not be voting on it at
 
09:47:00.870 --> 09:47:00.880 align:start position:0%
905 in the evening but perhaps at say 9
 
09:47:02.630 --> 09:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
30 in the morning
 
09:47:06.790 --> 09:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
would i now vote yes to table
 
09:47:09.110 --> 09:47:09.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
09:47:10.310 --> 09:47:10.320 align:start position:0%

09:47:15.190 --> 09:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
09:47:17.266 --> 09:47:17.276 align:start position:0%
if i know that our buffer zone law is
 
09:47:19.830 --> 09:47:19.840 align:start position:0%
transparently unconstitutional and has
 
09:47:21.426 --> 09:47:21.436 align:start position:0%
never been enforced
 
09:47:23.350 --> 09:47:23.360 align:start position:0%
and if i also know that it serves no
 
09:47:26.150 --> 09:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
purpose except to chill and deter lawful
 
09:47:28.070 --> 09:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
speech that supporters of the law find
 
09:47:28.080 --> 09:47:29.510 align:start position:0%
speech that supporters of the law find
defensive

09:47:29.510 --> 09:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
defensive
 
09:47:31.426 --> 09:47:31.436 align:start position:0%
and mr speaker if i know that the new
 
09:47:33.426 --> 09:47:33.436 align:start position:0%
hampshire constitution says that free
 
09:47:35.990 --> 09:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
speech is essential to the security of
 
09:47:36.000 --> 09:47:37.350 align:start position:0%
speech is essential to the security of
freedom

09:47:37.350 --> 09:47:37.360 align:start position:0%
freedom
 
09:47:39.110 --> 09:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
would i then preserve the freedom of
 
09:47:41.266 --> 09:47:41.276 align:start position:0%
speech and press the red button to

09:56:13.266 --> 09:56:13.276 align:start position:0%
i know it's been a very long day
 
09:56:15.830 --> 09:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
and this is a topic that um
 
09:56:18.070 --> 09:56:18.080 align:start position:0%
garners a lot of attention
 
09:56:20.470 --> 09:56:20.480 align:start position:0%
and uh is difficult in a lot of ways for
 
09:56:22.470 --> 09:56:22.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of people so i'll try to keep my
 
09:56:24.230 --> 09:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
comments brief this evening as brief as
 
09:56:24.240 --> 09:56:25.350 align:start position:0%
comments brief this evening as brief as
possible

09:56:25.350 --> 09:56:25.360 align:start position:0%
possible
 
09:56:26.710 --> 09:56:26.720 align:start position:0%
and there are a lot of things that i
 
09:56:27.990 --> 09:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
would really like to speak about this
 
09:56:29.510 --> 09:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
evening but what i would like to do
 
09:56:31.830 --> 09:56:31.840 align:start position:0%
primarily is just remind us of what the
 
09:56:34.150 --> 09:56:34.160 align:start position:0%
fetal life protection act does
 
09:56:35.510 --> 09:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
and what this amendment does to the
 
09:56:38.310 --> 09:56:38.320 align:start position:0%
fetal life protection act
 
09:56:40.550 --> 09:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
the fetal life protection act
 
09:56:40.560 --> 09:56:42.310 align:start position:0%
the fetal life protection act
outlaws

09:56:42.310 --> 09:56:42.320 align:start position:0%
outlaws
 
09:56:44.950 --> 09:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
the killing of a child after six months
 
09:56:47.350 --> 09:56:47.360 align:start position:0%
gestation to nine months gestation in
 
09:56:50.310 --> 09:56:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
09:56:51.746 --> 09:56:51.756 align:start position:0%
for the first time in the state of new
 
09:56:53.190 --> 09:56:53.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire's history
 
09:56:55.190 --> 09:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
it gives equal protection
 
09:56:58.550 --> 09:56:58.560 align:start position:0%
under the law to those people
 
09:57:00.230 --> 09:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
so for the first time in history people
 
09:57:02.790 --> 09:57:02.800 align:start position:0%
who are that old
 
09:57:04.950 --> 09:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
can cannot be killed any more than any
 
09:57:09.510 --> 09:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
09:57:10.870 --> 09:57:10.880 align:start position:0%
and that puts us in a very unique
 
09:57:14.150 --> 09:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
09:57:15.426 --> 09:57:15.436 align:start position:0%
because for the first time in the state
 
09:57:18.070 --> 09:57:18.080 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire's history this body has
 
09:57:20.470 --> 09:57:20.480 align:start position:0%
the power to remove equal protection
 
09:57:22.870 --> 09:57:22.880 align:start position:0%
under the law from some of our citizens
 
09:57:34.630 --> 09:57:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
09:57:37.190 --> 09:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
so the next time
 
09:57:38.870 --> 09:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
the next time that
 
09:57:40.710 --> 09:57:40.720 align:start position:0%
an abortionist
 
09:57:42.870 --> 09:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
legally approaches
 
09:57:44.710 --> 09:57:44.720 align:start position:0%
a child between the gestational age of
 
09:57:48.150 --> 09:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
09:57:51.830 --> 09:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
and stabs that child through the heart
 
09:57:55.830 --> 09:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
and inserts poison into its veins
 
09:57:59.426 --> 09:57:59.436 align:start position:0%
 
09:58:02.390 --> 09:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
until the heart seizes up
 
09:58:04.950 --> 09:58:04.960 align:start position:0%
when we can't hear its silent scream of
 
09:58:04.960 --> 09:58:07.190 align:start position:0%
when we can't hear its silent scream of
agony

09:58:07.190 --> 09:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
agony
 
09:58:11.266 --> 09:58:11.276 align:start position:0%
 
09:58:13.190 --> 09:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
we approved it not only did we approve
 
09:58:17.266 --> 09:58:17.276 align:start position:0%
 
09:58:26.070 --> 09:58:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
09:58:27.670 --> 09:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
this amendment basically guts any
 
09:58:27.680 --> 09:58:29.110 align:start position:0%
this amendment basically guts any
protection

09:58:29.110 --> 09:58:29.120 align:start position:0%
protection
 
09:58:31.990 --> 09:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
that any child in this age range will
 
09:58:34.150 --> 09:58:34.160 align:start position:0%
will have
 
09:58:36.230 --> 09:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
it doesn't protect any of them
 
09:58:38.150 --> 09:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
it kind of dresses it up with some
 
09:58:38.160 --> 09:58:39.586 align:start position:0%
it kind of dresses it up with some

fetal anomalies not compatible with life
 
09:58:46.550 --> 09:58:46.560 align:start position:0%

it strips all of the criminal and civil

it strips all of the criminal and civil
penalties

09:58:49.586 --> 09:58:49.596 align:start position:0%
penalties
 
09:58:51.670 --> 09:58:51.680 align:start position:0%
out of the bill essentially rendering it
 
09:59:07.510 --> 09:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
09:59:08.790 --> 09:59:08.800 align:start position:0%
i've had a lot of conversations with
 
09:59:10.470 --> 09:59:10.480 align:start position:0%
people around this chamber and the
 
09:59:12.470 --> 09:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
number one thing that i've heard
 
09:59:14.230 --> 09:59:14.240 align:start position:0%
is that we don't believe that children
 
09:59:18.150 --> 09:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
09:59:19.190 --> 09:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
and there's something that i would like
 
09:59:20.550 --> 09:59:20.560 align:start position:0%
to straighten out about this particular
 
09:59:22.950 --> 09:59:22.960 align:start position:0%
point in pregnancy
 
09:59:25.586 --> 09:59:25.596 align:start position:0%
i'd like to to make it understood that
 
09:59:28.550 --> 09:59:28.560 align:start position:0%
every abortion at this point the child
 
09:59:32.790 --> 09:59:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
09:59:35.510 --> 09:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
the child will have to be born
 
09:59:38.550 --> 09:59:38.560 align:start position:0%
and when that process
 
09:59:40.310 --> 09:59:40.320 align:start position:0%
of abortion is completed when that child
 
09:59:42.550 --> 09:59:42.560 align:start position:0%
is killed
 
09:59:44.310 --> 09:59:44.320 align:start position:0%
and the mother is induced and the child
 
09:59:46.470 --> 09:59:46.480 align:start position:0%
is delivered and that child
 
09:59:49.830 --> 09:59:49.840 align:start position:0%
is held in the hands of the abortionist
 
09:59:51.510 --> 09:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
that child is no longer in the mother's
 
09:59:51.520 --> 09:59:53.426 align:start position:0%
that child is no longer in the mother's
womb

09:59:53.426 --> 09:59:53.436 align:start position:0%
womb
 
09:59:56.630 --> 09:59:56.640 align:start position:0%
is a complete human being
 
09:59:58.710 --> 09:59:58.720 align:start position:0%
and it's a dead human being
 
10:00:03.426 --> 10:00:03.436 align:start position:0%
 
10:00:05.586 --> 10:00:05.596 align:start position:0%
it has a hole in the heart
 
10:00:05.596 --> 10:00:06.470 align:start position:0%
it has a hole in the heart
its

10:00:06.470 --> 10:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
its
 
10:00:08.390 --> 10:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
veins are full of poison
 
10:00:09.990 --> 10:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
under any other circumstances we would
 
10:00:11.586 --> 10:00:11.596 align:start position:0%
call that murder
 
10:00:14.470 --> 10:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
but for some reason we have this
 
10:00:17.266 --> 10:00:17.276 align:start position:0%
complete unscientific notion that the
 
10:00:19.670 --> 10:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
child who is in the womb two minutes
 
10:00:19.680 --> 10:00:21.190 align:start position:0%
child who is in the womb two minutes
before

10:00:21.190 --> 10:00:21.200 align:start position:0%
before
 
10:00:22.870 --> 10:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
and the child who's outside the woman
 
10:00:24.870 --> 10:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
after are completely different and if i
 
10:00:26.310 --> 10:00:26.320 align:start position:0%
could just if somebody could get up here
 
10:00:28.070 --> 10:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
and explain that to me i'd be
 
10:00:32.230 --> 10:00:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
10:00:34.390 --> 10:00:34.400 align:start position:0%
because otherwise what we're saying is
 
10:00:34.400 --> 10:00:35.190 align:start position:0%
because otherwise what we're saying is
that

10:00:35.190 --> 10:00:35.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
10:00:36.710 --> 10:00:36.720 align:start position:0%
we believe that it's completely
 
10:00:36.720 --> 10:00:39.190 align:start position:0%
we believe that it's completely
acceptable

10:00:39.190 --> 10:00:39.200 align:start position:0%
acceptable
 
10:00:40.230 --> 10:00:40.240 align:start position:0%
to either
 
10:00:42.950 --> 10:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
kill the child have it born dead or even
 
10:00:44.870 --> 10:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
worse in some cases completely
 
10:00:44.880 --> 10:00:46.630 align:start position:0%
worse in some cases completely
dismembered

10:00:46.630 --> 10:00:46.640 align:start position:0%
dismembered
 
10:00:49.266 --> 10:00:49.276 align:start position:0%
body part by body part this is this is
 
10:00:50.870 --> 10:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
this is what the fetal life protection
 
10:00:52.870 --> 10:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
act outlaws
 
10:00:55.350 --> 10:00:55.360 align:start position:0%
leg detached head detached body
 
10:00:57.190 --> 10:00:57.200 align:start position:0%
completely torn apart and when we're
 
10:01:00.230 --> 10:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
done there's a pile of human body parts
 
10:01:01.990 --> 10:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
on the table
 
10:01:06.070 --> 10:01:06.080 align:start position:0%
i i would question the member on his
 
10:01:06.080 --> 10:01:07.426 align:start position:0%
i i would question the member on his
language

10:01:07.426 --> 10:01:07.436 align:start position:0%
language
 
10:01:09.426 --> 10:01:09.436 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry i didn't realize i'm sorry
 
10:01:11.110 --> 10:01:11.120 align:start position:0%
i'm new at this
 
10:01:12.390 --> 10:01:12.400 align:start position:0%
ladies and gentlemen of the general
 
10:01:12.400 --> 10:01:14.790 align:start position:0%
ladies and gentlemen of the general
court

10:01:14.790 --> 10:01:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
10:01:17.190 --> 10:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
i urge you
 
10:01:18.790 --> 10:01:18.800 align:start position:0%
i urge you
 
10:01:20.470 --> 10:01:20.480 align:start position:0%
to turn down the committee amendment on
 
10:01:22.790 --> 10:01:22.800 align:start position:0%
this bill so the better
 
10:01:29.510 --> 10:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
10:01:38.630 --> 10:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
10:01:40.710 --> 10:01:40.720 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes
 
10:01:50.470 --> 10:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
10:01:56.550 --> 10:01:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
10:01:56.560 --> 10:01:59.350 align:start position:0%
 
truth

10:01:59.350 --> 10:01:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
10:02:02.950 --> 10:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
does still carry
 
10:02:05.426 --> 10:02:05.436 align:start position:0%
some weight
 
10:02:17.110 --> 10:02:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
10:02:22.150 --> 10:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
10:02:22.160 --> 10:02:24.070 align:start position:0%
 
is

10:02:24.070 --> 10:02:24.080 align:start position:0%
is
 
10:02:27.110 --> 10:02:27.120 align:start position:0%
a coming together
 
10:02:31.110 --> 10:02:31.120 align:start position:0%
of disparate views
 
10:02:33.746 --> 10:02:33.756 align:start position:0%
how did we get into this situation in
 
10:02:36.870 --> 10:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
10:02:39.906 --> 10:02:39.916 align:start position:0%
we got into this situation because
 
10:02:43.670 --> 10:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
although every one of us knows
 
10:02:46.630 --> 10:02:46.640 align:start position:0%
that the finance committee
 
10:02:46.640 --> 10:02:47.830 align:start position:0%
that the finance committee
never

10:02:47.830 --> 10:02:47.840 align:start position:0%
never
 
10:02:50.630 --> 10:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
never gets involved in policy
 
10:02:54.390 --> 10:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
and only deals with budget matters you
 
10:02:56.790 --> 10:02:56.800 align:start position:0%
all do know that
 
10:02:58.870 --> 10:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
i know it from my years as chair of
 
10:03:01.426 --> 10:03:01.436 align:start position:0%
finance committee never did we get
 
10:03:04.070 --> 10:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
involved with anything that would be
 
10:03:04.080 --> 10:03:05.670 align:start position:0%
involved with anything that would be
policy

10:03:05.670 --> 10:03:05.680 align:start position:0%
policy
 
10:03:08.630 --> 10:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
except when we wanted to
 
10:03:10.870 --> 10:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
we all know
 
10:03:15.266 --> 10:03:15.276 align:start position:0%
because it has been stated publicly
 
10:03:18.790 --> 10:03:18.800 align:start position:0%
by people who were making the decisions
 
10:03:21.110 --> 10:03:21.120 align:start position:0%
that the reason
 
10:03:24.470 --> 10:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
that certain sections were put in house
 
10:03:26.630 --> 10:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
bill 2
 
10:03:28.630 --> 10:03:28.640 align:start position:0%
that's the budget trailer bill that is
 
10:03:32.230 --> 10:03:32.240 align:start position:0%
supposed to support things relating to
 
10:03:32.240 --> 10:03:33.990 align:start position:0%
supposed to support things relating to
money

10:03:33.990 --> 10:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
money
 
10:03:36.630 --> 10:03:36.640 align:start position:0%
the things that were irrelevant to money
 
10:03:39.266 --> 10:03:39.276 align:start position:0%
because there's no public dollar that
 
10:03:41.030 --> 10:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
goes into
 
10:03:44.710 --> 10:03:44.720 align:start position:0%
there's no public dollar that goes into
 
10:03:47.670 --> 10:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
funding abortions in this state
 
10:03:47.680 --> 10:03:51.350 align:start position:0%
funding abortions in this state
nonetheless

10:03:51.350 --> 10:03:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
10:03:54.630 --> 10:03:54.640 align:start position:0%
decisions were made to include language
 
10:03:58.310 --> 10:03:58.320 align:start position:0%
having to do with state policy
 
10:03:58.320 --> 10:03:59.830 align:start position:0%
having to do with state policy
affecting

10:03:59.830 --> 10:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
affecting
 
10:04:03.906 --> 10:04:03.916 align:start position:0%
 
10:04:03.916 --> 10:04:05.350 align:start position:0%
 
okay

10:04:05.350 --> 10:04:05.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
10:04:07.426 --> 10:04:07.436 align:start position:0%
that was done by the finance committee
 
10:04:09.110 --> 10:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
because it never gets involved with
 
10:04:11.746 --> 10:04:11.756 align:start position:0%
policy and this body
 
10:04:14.950 --> 10:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
in order to pass the budget
 
10:04:14.960 --> 10:04:16.550 align:start position:0%
in order to pass the budget
agreed

10:04:16.550 --> 10:04:16.560 align:start position:0%
agreed
 
10:04:18.230 --> 10:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
and the governor
 
10:04:20.950 --> 10:04:20.960 align:start position:0%
who stated as clearly as he possibly
 
10:04:24.070 --> 10:04:24.080 align:start position:0%
could that he didn't like some of the
 
10:04:24.080 --> 10:04:25.350 align:start position:0%
could that he didn't like some of the
language

10:04:25.350 --> 10:04:25.360 align:start position:0%
language
 
10:04:27.510 --> 10:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
but nonetheless because it was in the
 
10:04:29.746 --> 10:04:29.756 align:start position:0%
budget he had to sign it
 
10:04:31.190 --> 10:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
signed it
 
10:04:35.030 --> 10:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
fine that's what happens in a democratic
 
10:04:38.630 --> 10:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
small d democratic form of government
 
10:04:41.830 --> 10:04:41.840 align:start position:0%
where we have republicans and democrats
 
10:04:43.906 --> 10:04:43.916 align:start position:0%
and independents we have people with
 
10:04:45.670 --> 10:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
different views
 
10:04:48.550 --> 10:04:48.560 align:start position:0%
on different subjects and we accommodate
 
10:04:50.710 --> 10:04:50.720 align:start position:0%
as much as we can
 
10:04:52.550 --> 10:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
that being the case
 
10:04:53.670 --> 10:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
we then
 
10:04:56.870 --> 10:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
looked at what the language was and what
 
10:04:59.746 --> 10:04:59.756 align:start position:0%
the language accomplished and didn't
 
10:04:59.756 --> 10:05:01.670 align:start position:0%
the language accomplished and didn't
accomplish

10:05:01.670 --> 10:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
accomplish
 
10:05:02.830 --> 10:05:02.840 align:start position:0%
as a
 
10:05:06.070 --> 10:05:06.080 align:start position:0%
result and after a lot of discussion
 
10:05:09.990 --> 10:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
10:05:13.510 --> 10:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
the judiciary committee came up with an
 
10:05:16.710 --> 10:05:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
10:05:16.720 --> 10:05:20.470 align:start position:0%

10:05:53.916 --> 10:05:55.670 align:start position:0%
 
for

10:05:55.670 --> 10:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
for
 
10:05:58.230 --> 10:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
what he views as fetal protection we
 
10:06:01.426 --> 10:06:01.436 align:start position:0%
took language exact language that he
 
10:06:02.790 --> 10:06:02.800 align:start position:0%
came up with
 
10:06:04.870 --> 10:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
and it's language that you can see in
 
10:06:08.070 --> 10:06:08.080 align:start position:0%
both the majority amendment and the
 
10:06:10.630 --> 10:06:10.640 align:start position:0%
minority amendment
 
10:06:10.640 --> 10:06:11.426 align:start position:0%
minority amendment
that

10:06:11.426 --> 10:06:11.436 align:start position:0%
that
 
10:06:14.710 --> 10:06:14.720 align:start position:0%
the judiciary committee came up with we
 
10:06:17.030 --> 10:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
took language
 
10:06:19.190 --> 10:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
that acknowledged
 
10:06:21.190 --> 10:06:21.200 align:start position:0%
the 24
 
10:06:21.200 --> 10:06:24.390 align:start position:0%
the 24
week

10:06:24.390 --> 10:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
10:06:26.710 --> 10:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
limit on
 
10:06:29.906 --> 10:06:29.916 align:start position:0%
in which under ordinary circumstances
 
10:06:32.070 --> 10:06:32.080 align:start position:0%
abortions could be performed in the
 
10:06:32.080 --> 10:06:33.350 align:start position:0%
abortions could be performed in the
state

10:06:33.350 --> 10:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
state
 
10:06:34.870 --> 10:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
we also
 
10:06:37.906 --> 10:06:37.916 align:start position:0%
took the language that was
 
10:06:39.906 --> 10:06:39.916 align:start position:0%
somewhat unclear
 
10:06:42.470 --> 10:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
having to do
 
10:06:42.480 --> 10:06:44.950 align:start position:0%
having to do
with

10:06:44.950 --> 10:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
10:06:49.350 --> 10:06:49.360 align:start position:0%
with certain tests about
 
10:06:50.870 --> 10:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
to which a pregnant woman would be
 
10:06:50.880 --> 10:06:52.150 align:start position:0%
to which a pregnant woman would be
subjected

10:06:52.150 --> 10:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
subjected
 
10:06:55.190 --> 10:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
and we said that would only happen not
 
10:06:57.190 --> 10:06:57.200 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of a pregnancy but if
 
10:06:59.266 --> 10:06:59.276 align:start position:0%
there was some question as to whether we
 
10:07:01.190 --> 10:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
were at the 24
 
10:07:04.230 --> 10:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
week deadline or not this was a minority
 
10:07:06.710 --> 10:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
amendment and the majority amendment it
 
10:07:10.070 --> 10:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
is exactly the same language
 
10:07:15.266 --> 10:07:15.276 align:start position:0%
 
10:07:17.586 --> 10:07:17.596 align:start position:0%
we said
 
10:07:20.070 --> 10:07:20.080 align:start position:0%
and you can read about it in in the
 
10:07:23.266 --> 10:07:23.276 align:start position:0%
report in the calendar
 
10:07:25.030 --> 10:07:25.040 align:start position:0%
we said
 
10:07:27.190 --> 10:07:27.200 align:start position:0%
okay first
 
10:07:30.870 --> 10:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
that the gestational age of 24 weeks as
 
10:07:35.670 --> 10:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
i said was we would accept as a limit
 
10:07:36.830 --> 10:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
we said
 
10:07:36.840 --> 10:07:38.630 align:start position:0%
we said
except

10:07:38.630 --> 10:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
except
 
10:07:42.070 --> 10:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
in cases where there are fetal anomalies
 
10:07:46.070 --> 10:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
that are inconsistent with life
 
10:07:48.230 --> 10:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
not field anomalies that might be
 
10:07:50.470 --> 10:07:50.480 align:start position:0%
anomalies but are not going to interfere
 
10:07:53.030 --> 10:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
with life only those that were
 
10:07:55.746 --> 10:07:55.756 align:start position:0%
consistent with life
 
10:07:58.390 --> 10:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
and we said talked about the ultrasound
 
10:07:58.400 --> 10:07:59.830 align:start position:0%
and we said talked about the ultrasound
test

10:07:59.830 --> 10:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
test
 
10:08:02.390 --> 10:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
we then eliminated
 
10:08:05.670 --> 10:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
the criminal and civil penalties
 
10:08:07.830 --> 10:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
that were in
 
10:08:10.070 --> 10:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
the fetal protection act
 
10:08:13.746 --> 10:08:13.756 align:start position:0%
in this state medical care
 
10:08:13.756 --> 10:08:14.630 align:start position:0%
in this state medical care
in

10:08:14.630 --> 10:08:14.640 align:start position:0%
in
 
10:08:16.630 --> 10:08:16.640 align:start position:0%
most states but certainly in this state
 
10:08:18.710 --> 10:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
medical care in the reproductive health
 
10:08:21.266 --> 10:08:21.276 align:start position:0%
or gynecology field
 
10:08:23.510 --> 10:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
including abortion
 
10:08:26.630 --> 10:08:26.640 align:start position:0%
is provided by medical professionals who
 
10:08:29.510 --> 10:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
despite what some people might say are
 
10:08:32.070 --> 10:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
licensed by the new hampshire board of
 
10:08:34.310 --> 10:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
medicine and the new hampshire board of
 
10:08:34.320 --> 10:08:35.350 align:start position:0%
medicine and the new hampshire board of
nursing

10:08:35.350 --> 10:08:35.360 align:start position:0%
nursing
 
10:08:37.830 --> 10:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
these boards oversee the education
 
10:08:41.190 --> 10:08:41.200 align:start position:0%
background training of every doctor
 
10:08:43.906 --> 10:08:43.916 align:start position:0%
nurse and practitioner and physician
 
10:08:46.070 --> 10:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
assistant in new hampshire
 
10:08:47.830 --> 10:08:47.840 align:start position:0%
and in addition to the state
 
10:08:52.470 --> 10:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
requirements um we also know that
 
10:08:55.670 --> 10:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
these providers are insured and the
 
10:08:59.830 --> 10:08:59.840 align:start position:0%
insurers maintain certain standards
 
10:09:02.870 --> 10:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
we eliminated the civil and criminal
 
10:09:05.586 --> 10:09:05.596 align:start position:0%
penalties here because if in fact
 
10:09:07.830 --> 10:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
someone were to act
 
10:09:10.390 --> 10:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
in violation of the law
 
10:09:12.630 --> 10:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
they would be held accountable by the
 
10:09:12.640 --> 10:09:14.070 align:start position:0%
they would be held accountable by the
appropriate

10:09:14.070 --> 10:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
10:09:14.080 --> 10:09:15.190 align:start position:0%
appropriate
bodies

10:09:15.190 --> 10:09:15.200 align:start position:0%
bodies
 
10:09:19.510 --> 10:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
to have this language free-floating
 
10:09:19.520 --> 10:09:20.550 align:start position:0%
to have this language free-floating
meant

10:09:20.550 --> 10:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
meant
 
10:09:23.110 --> 10:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
that we that there were many people who
 
10:09:24.870 --> 10:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
would say
 
10:09:27.030 --> 10:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
we're not going to come to new hampshire
 
10:09:29.030 --> 10:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
to practice medicine we're not going to
 
10:09:30.790 --> 10:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
take the chance
 
10:09:33.746 --> 10:09:33.756 align:start position:0%
that some idle
 
10:09:39.746 --> 10:09:39.756 align:start position:0%
 
10:09:43.426 --> 10:09:43.436 align:start position:0%
 
10:09:47.670 --> 10:09:47.680 align:start position:0%
okay so we did a change in credentialing
 
10:09:49.830 --> 10:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
we did a change
 
10:09:51.586 --> 10:09:51.596 align:start position:0%
in um
 
10:09:54.870 --> 10:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
ultrasound and we acknowledged
 
10:09:57.110 --> 10:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
the you know that
 
10:09:59.906 --> 10:09:59.916 align:start position:0%
fetal anomalies and the health of
 
10:10:01.266 --> 10:10:01.276 align:start position:0%
life and health of the mother are
 
10:10:01.276 --> 10:10:02.310 align:start position:0%
life and health of the mother are
important

10:10:02.310 --> 10:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
important
 
10:10:04.230 --> 10:10:04.240 align:start position:0%
there were other things we didn't change
 
10:10:05.830 --> 10:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
for example we didn't address the
 
10:10:08.310 --> 10:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
language of rape and incest there were
 
10:10:11.110 --> 10:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
other changes that we didn't make why
 
10:10:13.350 --> 10:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
because in the house judiciary committee
 
10:10:16.390 --> 10:10:16.400 align:start position:0%
we work together we try to find common
 
10:10:19.426 --> 10:10:19.436 align:start position:0%
ground we try to balance the competing
 
10:10:22.870 --> 10:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
demands of disparate views and we did a
 
10:10:26.310 --> 10:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
good job
 
10:10:26.320 --> 10:10:27.586 align:start position:0%
good job
now

10:10:27.586 --> 10:10:27.596 align:start position:0%
now
 
10:10:30.950 --> 10:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
at this time now it's 9 30
 
10:10:30.960 --> 10:10:31.830 align:start position:0%
at this time now it's 9 30
and

10:10:31.830 --> 10:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
10:10:34.310 --> 10:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
people continue to leave
 
10:10:36.630 --> 10:10:36.640 align:start position:0%
mr speaker i'm going to stop for a
 
10:10:38.710 --> 10:10:38.720 align:start position:0%
moment only because my mother told me
 
10:10:40.310 --> 10:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
never to speak while others were
 
10:10:40.320 --> 10:10:55.350 align:start position:0%
never to speak while others were
speaking

10:10:55.350 --> 10:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
10:11:01.990 --> 10:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
10:11:03.670 --> 10:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
i don't know thank you i don't know how
 
10:11:06.070 --> 10:11:06.080 align:start position:0%
many times i've asked today
 
10:11:07.746 --> 10:11:07.756 align:start position:0%
for the chamber
 
10:11:09.510 --> 10:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
to be quiet
 
10:11:14.070 --> 10:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
and i'm addressing both sides again
 
10:11:14.080 --> 10:11:14.870 align:start position:0%
and i'm addressing both sides again
that

10:11:14.870 --> 10:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
10:11:17.030 --> 10:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
neither side
 
10:11:20.230 --> 10:11:20.240 align:start position:0%
is complying with the simple request to
 
10:11:25.510 --> 10:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
10:11:27.266 --> 10:11:27.276 align:start position:0%
so hopefully this will be my last
 
10:11:29.030 --> 10:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
request for the day
 
10:11:31.190 --> 10:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
let the members speak if you need to
 
10:11:33.350 --> 10:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
have a conversation take it out into the
 
10:11:36.310 --> 10:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
annie room
 
10:11:38.710 --> 10:11:38.720 align:start position:0%
thank you may continue
 
10:11:41.510 --> 10:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker i'm tired and i
 
10:11:45.190 --> 10:11:45.200 align:start position:0%
assume everyone here is tired
 
10:11:47.990 --> 10:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
i made a suggestion a while ago
 
10:11:50.790 --> 10:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
that we put off this discussion
 
10:11:53.906 --> 10:11:53.916 align:start position:0%
until tomorrow
 
10:11:56.070 --> 10:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
that did not seem to be
 
10:11:57.426 --> 10:11:57.436 align:start position:0%
the will
 
10:12:01.746 --> 10:12:01.756 align:start position:0%
of the body and so we're proceeding now
 
10:12:04.950 --> 10:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
but there is no
 
10:12:07.906 --> 10:12:07.916 align:start position:0%
earthly reason
 
10:12:11.746 --> 10:12:11.756 align:start position:0%
why a majority of this body would not
 
10:12:11.756 --> 10:12:13.670 align:start position:0%
why a majority of this body would not
recognize

10:12:13.670 --> 10:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
recognize
 
10:12:13.680 --> 10:12:14.710 align:start position:0%
recognize
that

10:12:14.710 --> 10:12:14.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
10:12:17.906 --> 10:12:17.916 align:start position:0%
this bill as amended by a majority of
 
10:12:20.790 --> 10:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
10:12:24.390 --> 10:12:24.400 align:start position:0%
honors and reflects the feelings of
 
10:12:26.790 --> 10:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
those with disparate views
 
10:12:29.830 --> 10:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
but nonetheless continues the long
 
10:12:32.470 --> 10:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
tradition we have had in this state
 
10:12:32.480 --> 10:12:33.350 align:start position:0%
tradition we have had in this state
of

10:12:33.350 --> 10:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
of
 
10:12:36.950 --> 10:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
of respecting women's privacy and the
 
10:12:39.190 --> 10:12:39.200 align:start position:0%
right for a woman
 
10:12:42.070 --> 10:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
to make a decision having to do
 
10:12:43.830 --> 10:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
with her body
 
10:12:47.110 --> 10:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
without 400 members of the legislature
 
10:12:49.426 --> 10:12:49.436 align:start position:0%
trying to find their way
 
10:12:53.906 --> 10:12:53.916 align:start position:0%
into the doctor's office i ask you to
 
10:12:55.510 --> 10:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
think about it
 
10:12:57.830 --> 10:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
and to think about the implications to
 
10:13:03.190 --> 10:13:03.200 align:start position:0%
remember that not one public dollar
 
10:13:06.310 --> 10:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
in this state actually in any state not
 
10:13:09.586 --> 10:13:09.596 align:start position:0%
one public dollar goes to
 
10:13:11.110 --> 10:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
pay for
 
10:13:14.630 --> 10:13:14.640 align:start position:0%
abortion in those cases when abortion is
 
10:13:14.640 --> 10:13:17.350 align:start position:0%
abortion in those cases when abortion is
legal

10:13:17.350 --> 10:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
10:13:17.360 --> 10:13:18.710 align:start position:0%
 
that

10:13:18.710 --> 10:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
10:13:20.710 --> 10:13:20.720 align:start position:0%
to interfere
 
10:13:23.110 --> 10:13:23.120 align:start position:0%
with our long tradition is not going to
 
10:13:26.230 --> 10:13:26.240 align:start position:0%
cause abortion to disappear
 
10:13:29.030 --> 10:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
we have always had abortion
 
10:13:31.906 --> 10:13:31.916 align:start position:0%
what will happen if we
 
10:13:35.426 --> 10:13:35.436 align:start position:0%
do not pass this legislation in this way
 
10:13:37.190 --> 10:13:37.200 align:start position:0%
is the possibility
 
10:13:38.870 --> 10:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
the member will suspend
 
10:13:44.790 --> 10:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
10:13:46.870 --> 10:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
mr speaker i believe that
 
10:13:48.630 --> 10:13:48.640 align:start position:0%
the representative is wandering off
 
10:13:51.266 --> 10:13:51.276 align:start position:0%
subject quite a bit and my understanding
 
10:13:59.030 --> 10:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
10:13:59.040 --> 10:14:00.150 align:start position:0%
 
we're

10:14:00.150 --> 10:14:00.160 align:start position:0%
we're
 
10:14:01.906 --> 10:14:01.916 align:start position:0%
discussing the amendment to the bill
 
10:14:09.110 --> 10:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
10:14:10.870 --> 10:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
member may continue
 
10:14:14.070 --> 10:14:14.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker and i respect the
 
10:14:16.230 --> 10:14:16.240 align:start position:0%
concerns of the members i hope they're
 
10:14:18.390 --> 10:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
paying attention to realize that i have
 
10:14:20.630 --> 10:14:20.640 align:start position:0%
in fact been addressing
 
10:14:22.790 --> 10:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
the three major changes that the
 
10:14:25.510 --> 10:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
amendment to the bill
 
10:14:27.110 --> 10:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
brings into play
 
10:14:30.870 --> 10:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
and recognize that with this amendment
 
10:14:32.630 --> 10:14:32.640 align:start position:0%
and this bill
 
10:14:35.426 --> 10:14:35.436 align:start position:0%
we will have a logical
 
10:14:35.436 --> 10:14:36.830 align:start position:0%
we will have a logical
careful

10:14:36.830 --> 10:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
careful
 
10:14:39.190 --> 10:14:39.200 align:start position:0%

and that we will make sure
 
10:14:48.470 --> 10:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
that we are not going to do here what
 
10:14:50.950 --> 10:14:50.960 align:start position:0%
has happened in other states

this is a roll call vote the chair

parliamentary inquiry
 
10:17:40.870 --> 10:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker if i know that this
 
10:17:43.190 --> 10:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
amendment makes a mockery of the fetal
 
10:17:45.510 --> 10:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
life protection act by removing all
 
10:17:47.746 --> 10:17:47.756 align:start position:0%
penalties for late term abortions
 
10:17:49.586 --> 10:17:49.596 align:start position:0%
because there is no way to hold any

violator accountable
 
10:17:53.190 --> 10:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
and if i know that this majority
 
10:17:56.230 --> 10:17:56.240 align:start position:0%
amendment adds on an open-ended
 
10:17:58.470 --> 10:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
exception that makes the law a
 
10:18:01.030 --> 10:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
meaningless joke
 
10:18:02.950 --> 10:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
and mr speaker if i know that my

10:18:08.310 --> 10:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
should look the people of new hampshire
 
10:18:10.230 --> 10:18:10.240 align:start position:0%
in the eye and be honest about what they
 
10:18:11.990 --> 10:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
are doing instead of concealing their
 
10:18:14.310 --> 10:18:14.320 align:start position:0%
actions with an underhanded gutting bill
 
10:18:16.150 --> 10:18:16.160 align:start position:0%

enacted abortion law
 
10:19:04.870 --> 10:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
is being felt right now most
 
10:19:08.150 --> 10:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
significantly by families in extremely
 
10:19:10.790 --> 10:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
complex circumstances
 
10:19:12.710 --> 10:19:12.720 align:start position:0%

their own conscience

and if i know that the original
 
10:19:34.870 --> 10:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
ultrasound provision in law is unclear
 
10:19:37.266 --> 10:19:37.276 align:start position:0%
and we need to clarify it
 
10:19:39.670 --> 10:19:39.680 align:start position:0%
would i now press the green button to

term
 
10:21:39.030 --> 10:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
it addresses the lack of clarity in the
 
10:21:41.030 --> 10:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
ultrasound requirement that led
 
10:21:42.870 --> 10:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
providers to believe that they had to
 
10:21:45.426 --> 10:21:45.436 align:start position:0%
perform ultrasounds uh
 
10:21:47.030 --> 10:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
all the way up at the beginning of

pregnancy with transvaginal ultrasounds
 
10:21:50.150 --> 10:21:50.160 align:start position:0%
that's where that whole conflict came
 
10:21:52.390 --> 10:21:52.400 align:start position:0%
from that was never the intention
 
10:21:52.400 --> 10:21:53.266 align:start position:0%
from that was never the intention
of

10:21:53.266 --> 10:21:53.276 align:start position:0%
of
 
10:21:55.030 --> 10:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
the writers of the bill
 
10:21:56.550 --> 10:21:56.560 align:start position:0%
and this
 
10:21:58.550 --> 10:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
amendment clarifies that i would just
 
10:21:59.990 --> 10:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
like to point out that
 
10:22:02.230 --> 10:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
both sides really do agree on the need
 
10:22:04.470 --> 10:22:04.480 align:start position:0%

10:22:07.510 --> 10:22:07.520 align:start position:0%

one of our bills to be sent over to the
 
10:22:13.190 --> 10:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
other body so i'd really urge everybody
 
10:22:14.710 --> 10:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
to adopt this amendment at this point so
 
10:22:16.070 --> 10:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
that we can send it to the other house
