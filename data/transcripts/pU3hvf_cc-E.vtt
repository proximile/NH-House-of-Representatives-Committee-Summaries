bills that we will be holding an

executive session on after lunch so
 
00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
we're going to start with
 
00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:28.199 align:start position:0%
hr5 because we have that amendment in
 
00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:31.479 align:start position:0%
hand and while the committee discusses
 
00:06:34.189 --> 00:06:34.199 align:start position:0%
that amendment I will track down the
 
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:37.560 align:start position:0%
Amendments for three other bills so that
 
00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
we can discuss those as
 
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
well so let's start by talking about
 
00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.469 align:start position:0%
well so let's start by talking about
amendment

00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:45.479 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:47.150 align:start position:0%
amendment
number

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:50.120 align:start position:0%
0679 H to
 
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
hr15 and I will ask representative McGee
 
00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
to discuss this amendment with us thank
 
00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair yes um I had the dubious
 
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
honor of making a comment that perhaps
 
00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
we should have a few whereases at the
 
00:07:05.629 --> 00:07:05.639 align:start position:0%
front of the bill to help let our
 
00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:08.120 align:start position:0%
Congressional folks understand the
 
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
motivation for us asking them to
 
00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:11.960 align:start position:0%
intercede with the Federal Energy
 
00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
Regulatory Commission and so I was
 
00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
tasked with coming up with what those
 
00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
wear asses would contain so starting on
 
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.110 align:start position:0%
wear asses would contain so starting on
um

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
line three uh it says whereas it is
 
00:07:27.869 --> 00:07:27.879 align:start position:0%
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
 
00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:29.800 align:start position:0%
practice to accept new and upgrad graded
 
00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:32.360 align:start position:0%
transmission costs via a presumption of
 
00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:34.840 align:start position:0%
prudence without a detailed revenue of
 
00:07:38.589 --> 00:07:38.599 align:start position:0%
individual project costs and whereas
 
00:07:40.469 --> 00:07:40.479 align:start position:0%
consumer utility costs are increasingly
 
00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:43.240 align:start position:0%
burdensome and warrant detailed scrutiny
 
00:07:44.869 --> 00:07:44.879 align:start position:0%
of large-scale Utility Systems
 
00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:47.800 align:start position:0%
Investments to protect consumers and and
 
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
then it goes on to the language that was
 
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
uh in the bill to begin with the other
 
00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:56.120 align:start position:0%
two things we did was we made the edit
 
00:07:58.230 --> 00:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
um in the sections of the bill that had
 
00:08:00.629 --> 00:08:00.639 align:start position:0%
the word Justified and cut them back to
 
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
say just and reasonable which was the
 
00:08:09.629 --> 00:08:09.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:13.029 --> 00:08:13.039 align:start position:0%
it very good representative anyone have
 
00:08:18.029 --> 00:08:18.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
amendment representative
 
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:23.360 align:start position:0%
Harrington yeah first I want to thank uh
 
00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:25.000 align:start position:0%
represent McGee for doing this it's it's
 
00:08:26.869 --> 00:08:26.879 align:start position:0%
an definitely an improvement over what I
 
00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:28.720 align:start position:0%
had had out there so I appreciate your
 
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
work I think it's very good but guess
 
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:33.240 align:start position:0%
the only com I had re run done a uh
 
00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
Amendment too which I'm going to try to
 
00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:36.440 align:start position:0%
cancel now if I can figure out I can
 
00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:37.919 align:start position:0%
know how to send demand how to cancel
 
00:08:39.829 --> 00:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
that's a different story with o s but
 
00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:41.560 align:start position:0%
anyways the only thing I would see in
 
00:08:43.709 --> 00:08:43.719 align:start position:0%
this that may be of the minor minor
 
00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:46.760 align:start position:0%
issue is at the beginning of it in sence
 
00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:48.360 align:start position:0%
three where you say whereas it is the
 
00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:50.440 align:start position:0%
federal regulatory Energy Regulatory
 
00:08:52.509 --> 00:08:52.519 align:start position:0%
Commission practice and
 
00:08:55.829 --> 00:08:55.839 align:start position:0%
then you wait until we okay well you do
 
00:08:57.389 --> 00:08:57.399 align:start position:0%
put it in another spot where you
 
00:08:58.910 --> 00:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
abbreviate the firk I didn't see it in
 
00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:01.160 align:start position:0%
the other spot okay so forget that it's
 
00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
okay you just didn't do it in the first
 
00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
one you did it on line 13 you put it so
 
00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
that's as long as it's people understand
 
00:09:11.829 --> 00:09:11.839 align:start position:0%
that FK is is is the FC so this looks
 
00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:15.320 align:start position:0%
fine any other comments representative
 
00:09:19.509 --> 00:09:19.519 align:start position:0%
Thomas Wendy Thomas yes thank you um
 
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:21.160 align:start position:0%
I've just never seen it before so could
 
00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:23.240 align:start position:0%
somebody explain to me why the New
 
00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State librarian is included in
 
00:09:31.069 --> 00:09:31.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:33.829 --> 00:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
yes that's essentially for archival
 
00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:37.480 align:start position:0%
purposes virtually everything that H
 
00:09:39.509 --> 00:09:39.519 align:start position:0%
goes through the legislature ends up in
 
00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:41.560 align:start position:0%
the State library or the state archives
 
00:09:43.389 --> 00:09:43.399 align:start position:0%
one or the other but doesn't it end up
 
00:09:43.399 --> 00:09:44.190 align:start position:0%
one or the other but doesn't it end up
there

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:44.200 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
automatically I mean
 
00:09:51.509 --> 00:09:51.519 align:start position:0%
why don't they archive all legal
 
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
documents I suspect that they do but
 
00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:58.240 align:start position:0%
this is added to the legislation just uh
 
00:09:59.910 --> 00:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
as an assurance
 
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
that it happens okay I me I don't
 
00:10:04.509 --> 00:10:04.519 align:start position:0%
necessarily have a problem with it I
 
00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:06.760 align:start position:0%
just have never seen it before pretty
 
00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:10.200 align:start position:0%
standard boiler plate for this kind of
 
00:10:14.509 --> 00:10:14.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.829 align:start position:0%
 
hr15

00:10:20.829 --> 00:10:20.839 align:start position:0%
hr15
 
00:10:25.829 --> 00:10:25.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
on I will now pass out an amendment for
 
00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.949 align:start position:0%
on I will now pass out an amendment for
HB

00:10:33.949 --> 00:10:33.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
221 and we will discuss
 
00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:43.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:45.629 --> 00:10:45.639 align:start position:0%
221 this is a work
 
00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:49.000 align:start position:0%
session relative to assessment of cost
 
00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:51.720 align:start position:0%
eff cost effectiveness of the system
 
00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.069 align:start position:0%
eff cost effectiveness of the system
benefits

00:10:54.069 --> 00:10:54.079 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:38.310 align:start position:0%
 
do

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:40.069 --> 00:11:40.079 align:start position:0%
do you guys have enough that
 
00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:43.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:46.160 align:start position:0%
okay all right does everybody have a
 
00:11:49.389 --> 00:11:49.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:49.399 --> 00:11:51.190 align:start position:0%
 
amendment

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:11:56.629 --> 00:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
the the amendment replaces the bill
 
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
bill and the first part of the amendment
 
00:12:08.069 --> 00:12:08.079 align:start position:0%
starting on line8 going all the way down
 
00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:19.000 align:start position:0%
Bill the amendment adds a new section
 
00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:21.240 align:start position:0%
starting on line
 
00:12:23.949 --> 00:12:23.959 align:start position:0%
26 that runs
 
00:12:23.959 --> 00:12:27.710 align:start position:0%
26 that runs
through

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:27.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:31.560 align:start position:0%
um line 15 on page
 
00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:35.480 align:start position:0%
two and then the amendment also adds the
 
00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:40.680 align:start position:0%
text on line 16 and 17 on page
 
00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:44.120 align:start position:0%
two and the reason for this amendment
 
00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
starting on page one at line 26 is that
 
00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:52.040 align:start position:0%
most of this text is now
 
00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
Obsolete and so it has been struck from
 
00:13:01.949 --> 00:13:01.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
and then at the very end
 
00:13:09.829 --> 00:13:09.839 align:start position:0%
of the paragraph on page three after the
 
00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:13.160 align:start position:0%
strikeout on lines 14 and
 
00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
15 the word rate payer is replaced with
 
00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:17.720 align:start position:0%
the word
 
00:13:21.189 --> 00:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
customer uh in that sentence so it reads
 
00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
rate it used to read rate payer savings
 
00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
savings and so that's what the amendment
 
00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:35.320 align:start position:0%
does and I'm open to questions and
 
00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
amendment representative Wendy Thomas
 
00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:47.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um I'm intrigued um
 
00:13:50.389 --> 00:13:50.399 align:start position:0%
about replacing rape hair with customer
 
00:13:51.949 --> 00:13:51.959 align:start position:0%
what what do you see as the difference
 
00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:01.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:05.480 align:start position:0%
okay that was a suggestion made by the
 
00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:10.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:12.680 align:start position:0%
Commission there was a typo corrected
 
00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
tour in that sentence also on line 14
 
00:14:19.269 --> 00:14:19.279 align:start position:0%
where the word asure is been in placed
 
00:14:22.189 --> 00:14:22.199 align:start position:0%
replaced by the word
 
00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:25.160 align:start position:0%
insure did they give you any I I can't
 
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
remember I can look through my notes did
 
00:14:28.629 --> 00:14:28.639 align:start position:0%
they give you any justification for
 
00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:32.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
customer I don't recall from their from
 
00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:37.880 align:start position:0%
their text I don't have it right in
 
00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
front of me what their reason for
 
00:14:42.829 --> 00:14:42.839 align:start position:0%
replacing rate paay with customer was to
 
00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:47.320 align:start position:0%
be honest with you okay excuse me chair
 
00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
yes rep representative CL yes uh could
 
00:14:53.389 --> 00:14:53.399 align:start position:0%
it have to do with line first page line
 
00:15:12.269 --> 00:15:12.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:22.749 --> 00:15:22.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:26.360 align:start position:0%
suggestion so uh representative McGee
 
00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:29.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um so I I kind of
 
00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:31.240 align:start position:0%
like to take us back to the purpose of
 
00:15:34.309 --> 00:15:34.319 align:start position:0%
the bill um it it appears that the major
 
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill is to allow the
 
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission to
 
00:15:44.189 --> 00:15:44.199 align:start position:0%
have uh latitude to move away from using
 
00:15:46.269 --> 00:15:46.279 align:start position:0%
the granite state test and the
 
00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
identified testing metrics metrics that
 
00:15:53.749 --> 00:15:53.759 align:start position:0%
we um kind of painstakingly put in place
 
00:15:58.350 --> 00:15:58.360 align:start position:0%
as a state um and uh you know to give
 
00:16:01.389 --> 00:16:01.399 align:start position:0%
them latit basically to come to maybe
 
00:16:03.069 --> 00:16:03.079 align:start position:0%
different results than what the granite
 
00:16:05.629 --> 00:16:05.639 align:start position:0%
state test um and the the current mode
 
00:16:05.639 --> 00:16:06.550 align:start position:0%
state test um and the the current mode
of

00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:16:09.749 --> 00:16:09.759 align:start position:0%
reviewing um the New Hampshire saves
 
00:16:13.509 --> 00:16:13.519 align:start position:0%
trienal plans uh was designed to do so
 
00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:15.560 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering whether we should be
 
00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
discussing at all uh whether those
 
00:16:23.749 --> 00:16:23.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
needed because the the cost
 
00:16:28.189 --> 00:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness piece is what led us to
 
00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:35.720 align:start position:0%
state so who who is saying that it isn't
 
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
adequate representative Harrington filed
 
00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:40.680 align:start position:0%
this bill okay uh
 
00:16:43.189 --> 00:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
representative sure I uh I work with the
 
00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh pu on this they felt as though that
 
00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
there's nothing specifically wrong with
 
00:16:48.749 --> 00:16:48.759 align:start position:0%
the granted state test but it's getting
 
00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:52.240 align:start position:0%
old it was developed some time ago and
 
00:16:54.509 --> 00:16:54.519 align:start position:0%
there we shouldn't hold people's to
 
00:16:56.629 --> 00:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
something that old and instead allowing
 
00:16:58.430 --> 00:16:58.440 align:start position:0%
them to come up with a different method
 
00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
if it's seemed to be a better method and
 
00:17:02.189 --> 00:17:02.199 align:start position:0%
as it says additional tests developed
 
00:17:04.549 --> 00:17:04.559 align:start position:0%
through an adjudicative process and
 
00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
approve them by order prior to
 
00:17:08.909 --> 00:17:08.919 align:start position:0%
commencement of any trienal udit or
 
00:17:11.189 --> 00:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
period beginning with the program year
 
00:17:14.429 --> 00:17:14.439 align:start position:0%
2027 so that if there was going to be a
 
00:17:15.949 --> 00:17:15.959 align:start position:0%
change this would have to be an
 
00:17:18.429 --> 00:17:18.439 align:start position:0%
adjudicated process in front of the Pu
 
00:17:19.789 --> 00:17:19.799 align:start position:0%
where everybody would get to come in and
 
00:17:21.870 --> 00:17:21.880 align:start position:0%
put their two cents worth in as to why
 
00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:23.079 align:start position:0%
you should make the change why you
 
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
shouldn't make the change why you should
 
00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
make this additional change and then
 
00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
that would be adjudicated uh it's it's
 
00:17:30.909 --> 00:17:30.919 align:start position:0%
just a matter of allowing flexibility to
 
00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:33.400 align:start position:0%
improve the process and who would make
 
00:17:35.909 --> 00:17:35.919 align:start position:0%
the decision if that the adjudicated
 
00:17:37.549 --> 00:17:37.559 align:start position:0%
process is in the control of the Public
 
00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission is that correct
 
00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
correct okay so it's it's of by and for
 
00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:45.240 align:start position:0%
the Pu but I I guess there would there
 
00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
was never really I in the hearings I
 
00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:48.990 align:start position:0%
was never really I in the hearings I
didn't

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
hear an adequate argument that the you
 
00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:55.000 align:start position:0%
know many of us are old right we're not
 
00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
obsolete we get better with age so it
 
00:17:58.310 --> 00:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean just because something's
 
00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:01.000 align:start position:0%
been around for a while doesn't mean it
 
00:18:04.669 --> 00:18:04.679 align:start position:0%
uh it requires renovation what what I
 
00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
didn't hear was what they were trying to
 
00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:10.360 align:start position:0%
solve for in terms of identifying cost
 
00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness right that's the goal is
 
00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the plans that are
 
00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:16.600 align:start position:0%
presented are cost effective but there's
 
00:18:18.789 --> 00:18:18.799 align:start position:0%
no delineation of what cost effective is
 
00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:21.080 align:start position:0%
is it is it three times return four
 
00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:23.480 align:start position:0%
times return 10 times return who who
 
00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:26.240 align:start position:0%
decides that if you pass this bill what
 
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
you do is you put it back in the hands
 
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
of the public utilities commission who
 
00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:33.080 align:start position:0%
all of us had to override when they
 
00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:35.720 align:start position:0%
found a trienal plan that didn't work
 
00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
brought in front of them that everyone
 
00:18:39.549 --> 00:18:39.559 align:start position:0%
else uh that was involved in development
 
00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:41.960 align:start position:0%
of that plan agreed was good for the
 
00:18:43.909 --> 00:18:43.919 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire so I'm just
 
00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:45.400 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out whether we're
 
00:18:48.149 --> 00:18:48.159 align:start position:0%
making things worse by passing this bill
 
00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:50.200 align:start position:0%
that was requested by the Public
 
00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:51.720 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission so that the Public
 
00:18:54.149 --> 00:18:54.159 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission has
 
00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
more uh ability to upend future plans
 
00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:02.720 align:start position:0%
so one of the uh reasons for this
 
00:19:05.669 --> 00:19:05.679 align:start position:0%
amendment and this bill in general is
 
00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:08.720 align:start position:0%
that when we did pass HB
 
00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
541 back in 2000 I think it
 
00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:14.149 align:start position:0%
541 back in 2000 I think it
was

00:19:14.149 --> 00:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:18.760 align:start position:0%
2022 when we did pass that bill um there
 
00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
was an extensive amendment that went
 
00:19:23.149 --> 00:19:23.159 align:start position:0%
with it
 
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
that put into statute the procedure that
 
00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:29.640 align:start position:0%
we wanted the you Public Utilities
 
00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
Commission to follow in order to deal
 
00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:36.440 align:start position:0%
with Energy Efficiency and the system
 
00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:39.080 align:start position:0%
benefits charge going
 
00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
forward and that fairly large and
 
00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:45.720 align:start position:0%
complex administrative change Amendment
 
00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
change I should say included language
 
00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
that restricted the Public Utilities
 
00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
Commission to only looking at and
 
00:19:59.510 --> 00:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
evaluating changes to the program
 
00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:03.240 align:start position:0%
from one trianium to the next rather
 
00:20:06.149 --> 00:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
than being able to evaluate the
 
00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
entire three-year trianium plan so this
 
00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:13.480 align:start position:0%
amendment is designed
 
00:20:16.789 --> 00:20:16.799 align:start position:0%
to address that
 
00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:19.960 align:start position:0%
oversight that was put into statute I
 
00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:21.430 align:start position:0%
oversight that was put into statute I
believe

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
believe
 
00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:25.000 align:start position:0%
unintentionally back in 2022 I know I
 
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
worked on that Amendment and I was
 
00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:29.720 align:start position:0%
unaware that that restriction had been
 
00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
added to the legislation and it was not
 
00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:34.200 align:start position:0%
something that I would have approved at
 
00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:36.760 align:start position:0%
the time had I realized it Mr chairman
 
00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:39.880 align:start position:0%
is that is that related to the 97%
 
00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:42.760 align:start position:0%
versus 3% that they've brought up yes is
 
00:20:44.909 --> 00:20:44.919 align:start position:0%
that what you're talking about yes okay
 
00:20:46.669 --> 00:20:46.679 align:start position:0%
and and I think that's a feature not a
 
00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
bug and that that's why I'm that's why
 
00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
I'm bringing it up here because I think
 
00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:56.200 align:start position:0%
I think that 549 actually did what you
 
00:20:58.270 --> 00:20:58.280 align:start position:0%
and others you know what we intended
 
00:20:59.710 --> 00:20:59.720 align:start position:0%
which was
 
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
to further Define the Contours of the
 
00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
program so that there wouldn't be an
 
00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:10.240 align:start position:0%
attempt to U overspend in terms of
 
00:21:12.549 --> 00:21:12.559 align:start position:0%
taking advantage of the rate payers so
 
00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:14.720 align:start position:0%
it put Contours around it and said this
 
00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
is how it will go forward this is how it
 
00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:19.320 align:start position:0%
will grow so it was it was very
 
00:21:24.149 --> 00:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
deliberate um and the whole idea was to
 
00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
maintain stability in that program for
 
00:21:27.669 --> 00:21:27.679 align:start position:0%
all of the stakeholders that are
 
00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
involved including small weatherization
 
00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:32.440 align:start position:0%
businesses I mean we were both there for
 
00:21:37.909 --> 00:21:37.919 align:start position:0%
that um so I guess what I'm asking is is
 
00:21:41.269 --> 00:21:41.279 align:start position:0%
the granite state test still
 
00:21:44.029 --> 00:21:44.039 align:start position:0%
supports um what was originally
 
00:21:46.149 --> 00:21:46.159 align:start position:0%
envisioned for a review by the Public
 
00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission and it almost seems
 
00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
as though the Public Utilities
 
00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
Commission is trying to figure out some
 
00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:52.950 align:start position:0%
Commission is trying to figure out some
way

00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
to um have a way to
 
00:21:59.070 --> 00:21:59.080 align:start position:0%
say that changes to the program are
 
00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:01.640 align:start position:0%
unwarranted it you know it just it
 
00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem like it's based on uh
 
00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
finding something that's wrong with the
 
00:22:08.549 --> 00:22:08.559 align:start position:0%
granite state test that needs to be
 
00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:10.480 align:start position:0%
fixed we didn't get any specifics on
 
00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:13.240 align:start position:0%
that we just got please give us the
 
00:22:16.029 --> 00:22:16.039 align:start position:0%
ability to do something else if we if we
 
00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
feel that that's appropriate and um they
 
00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:19.960 align:start position:0%
didn't really give us anything
 
00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:22.120 align:start position:0%
compelling about what they thought they
 
00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
would need to do so I I'm inclined not
 
00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
to support it because I don't think they
 
00:22:28.029 --> 00:22:28.039 align:start position:0%
ever said what was wrong with the
 
00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
granite state test the granite state
 
00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
test they testified
 
00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
here didn't take certain costs into uh
 
00:22:37.789 --> 00:22:37.799 align:start position:0%
account but it also didn't take certain
 
00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
benefits into account and it was
 
00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
specifically designed that way to be an
 
00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
adequate test that would give them uh a
 
00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:48.520 align:start position:0%
cost benefit evaluation that was
 
00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
reasonable and so what we didn't get was
 
00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
what are you pointing to that needs to
 
00:22:57.710 --> 00:22:57.720 align:start position:0%
be fixed and what are you pointing to
 
00:23:00.669 --> 00:23:00.679 align:start position:0%
that you think would be better in terms
 
00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
of getting us to a place where we can
 
00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
assign reasonable or do you just want to
 
00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:05.960 align:start position:0%
be able to say what's reasonable and
 
00:23:07.669 --> 00:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
what isn't and I I think it's too
 
00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:09.640 align:start position:0%
arbitrary I think they should do more
 
00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:12.760 align:start position:0%
work if they want us to change the
 
00:23:16.149 --> 00:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
law so the not of the issue here is that
 
00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
if we're going to spend 70 to 80 million
 
00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
doar of rate payer money on a yearly
 
00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:25.880 align:start position:0%
basis to implement Energy Efficiency
 
00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
programs how do we know that we're
 
00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:31.640 align:start position:0%
getting the best value for that every
 
00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
dollar of that 70 to8
 
00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:36.510 align:start position:0%
dollar of that 70 to8
million

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:36.520 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:38.720 align:start position:0%
expense and the Public Utilities
 
00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:42.360 align:start position:0%
Commission has told us that based on the
 
00:23:45.269 --> 00:23:45.279 align:start position:0%
way the legislation is written
 
00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:49.400 align:start position:0%
today they have no ability to
 
00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:52.760 align:start position:0%
determine if all those millions of
 
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
dollars are being spent in the best
 
00:23:58.549 --> 00:23:58.559 align:start position:0%
manner possible so that rate payers can
 
00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:02.120 align:start position:0%
get a maximum return for their
 
00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
investment these changes are designed to
 
00:24:08.149 --> 00:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
allow the Public Utilities Commission to
 
00:24:10.909 --> 00:24:10.919 align:start position:0%
do a full and thorough analysis and
 
00:24:14.029 --> 00:24:14.039 align:start position:0%
oversight of these programs every three
 
00:24:17.909 --> 00:24:17.919 align:start position:0%
years which I think is what we intended
 
00:24:21.789 --> 00:24:21.799 align:start position:0%
when we created the legislation back in
 
00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
2022 thank you I have one more thing I'd
 
00:24:28.549 --> 00:24:28.559 align:start position:0%
say on that just if you go ahead that um
 
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
when I first started paying attention uh
 
00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:35.240 align:start position:0%
to the trianal plans it was the
 
00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
utilities that were providing us with um
 
00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:42.440 align:start position:0%
an a report on the return on investment
 
00:24:45.669 --> 00:24:45.679 align:start position:0%
um specifically related to the return on
 
00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:48.200 align:start position:0%
investment for a specific prior
 
00:24:51.549 --> 00:24:51.559 align:start position:0%
three-year plan and so the information
 
00:24:55.029 --> 00:24:55.039 align:start position:0%
is available whether people believe it
 
00:24:59.870 --> 00:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
or like it um that it was not a question
 
00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:03.240 align:start position:0%
of us not having anything to assess and
 
00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:06.760 align:start position:0%
so um it's not a black box the the
 
00:25:08.789 --> 00:25:08.799 align:start position:0%
program was extremely well-run it was
 
00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
award-winning it still is I guess I
 
00:25:14.549 --> 00:25:14.559 align:start position:0%
don't know but I know that I've I
 
00:25:17.389 --> 00:25:17.399 align:start position:0%
certainly have still at home three-year
 
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
um reports from eversource and um the
 
00:25:23.029 --> 00:25:23.039 align:start position:0%
other utilities who used to contribute
 
00:25:27.549 --> 00:25:27.559 align:start position:0%
via the easy board um I we have reports
 
00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
because they were required statutorily
 
00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:31.640 align:start position:0%
to provide those reports that let us
 
00:25:34.549 --> 00:25:34.559 align:start position:0%
know the cost benefit analysis the last
 
00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
one I reviewed was $3.8 for every dollar
 
00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:41.240 align:start position:0%
spent so it was a three plus return on
 
00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:43.919 align:start position:0%
investment and again I don't know what
 
00:25:46.669 --> 00:25:46.679 align:start position:0%
the state thinks is sufficient but once
 
00:25:49.389 --> 00:25:49.399 align:start position:0%
you spend money to save energy on a
 
00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:51.720 align:start position:0%
building then you're lowering demand
 
00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
which lowers the cost of the system for
 
00:25:55.549 --> 00:25:55.559 align:start position:0%
everyone which is the reason that we're
 
00:25:58.950 --> 00:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
doing demand side investment so I I
 
00:26:00.909 --> 00:26:00.919 align:start position:0%
still don't understand how this bill
 
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
advances anything except allows more of
 
00:26:06.789 --> 00:26:06.799 align:start position:0%
a fishing Expedition right so there's
 
00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:10.600 align:start position:0%
97% that isn't up for review you're just
 
00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:12.200 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
00:26:16.789 --> 00:26:16.799 align:start position:0%
changes um and the Pu is saying no we
 
00:26:18.909 --> 00:26:18.919 align:start position:0%
want to throw all of it up in the air
 
00:26:21.149 --> 00:26:21.159 align:start position:0%
and we have to figure out do we want
 
00:26:23.789 --> 00:26:23.799 align:start position:0%
them to throw it up in the air because I
 
00:26:25.549 --> 00:26:25.559 align:start position:0%
don't I don't think that that's a good
 
00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
use of anyone's time I there's never
 
00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:29.640 align:start position:0%
been a question that the utilities were
 
00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:31.480 align:start position:0%
running the New Hampshire saves program
 
00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:33.720 align:start position:0%
well and every constituent that I've
 
00:26:35.029 --> 00:26:35.039 align:start position:0%
ever talked to in my community
 
00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
Republican and Democrat has said they
 
00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
they really like that program and uh
 
00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:47.480 align:start position:0%
hurt well we all know that we have great
 
00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:50.360 align:start position:0%
Utilities in this in this state well-run
 
00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
utilities that serve us
 
00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:56.480 align:start position:0%
well but the perennial question that the
 
00:26:58.710 --> 00:26:58.720 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission is forced to
 
00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
ask is do we just trust the
 
00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
utilities do we just let them do what
 
00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
they want because they assure us that
 
00:27:09.669 --> 00:27:09.679 align:start position:0%
what they're
 
00:27:14.029 --> 00:27:14.039 align:start position:0%
doing meets their own cost benefit test
 
00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:16.600 align:start position:0%
or should we take a look at what they're
 
00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:19.880 align:start position:0%
doing and make try to make a judgment
 
00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:24.520 align:start position:0%
about whether they in fact are doing the
 
00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
best that they can for the rate payer
 
00:27:29.789 --> 00:27:29.799 align:start position:0%
and the dollars that are being invested
 
00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:34.440 align:start position:0%
on his or her behalf so I think that's
 
00:27:36.549 --> 00:27:36.559 align:start position:0%
what we're saying here if we're going to
 
00:27:36.559 --> 00:27:37.350 align:start position:0%
what we're saying here if we're going to
look

00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
look
 
00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
at utility rates on a regular basis with
 
00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
a skeptical uh eye or a critical eye
 
00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we look at everything
 
00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
utilities do with a skeptical or
 
00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:52.760 align:start position:0%
critical eye and that's what this bill
 
00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
and this amendment seeks to do with
 
00:27:59.110 --> 00:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
regard to the Energy Efficiency programs
 
00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:02.190 align:start position:0%
regard to the Energy Efficiency programs
representative

00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:02.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:05.549 --> 00:28:05.559 align:start position:0%
rainolds thank you Mr chairman
 
00:28:07.389 --> 00:28:07.399 align:start position:0%
um I
 
00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:11.240 align:start position:0%
share uh my ranking members concern if
 
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:14.320 align:start position:0%
not objection to the basically to the
 
00:28:19.509 --> 00:28:19.519 align:start position:0%
premise of this bill uh I wasn't of
 
00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
course part of you know what went on
 
00:28:24.269 --> 00:28:24.279 align:start position:0%
back in
 
00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:28.120 align:start position:0%
2022 but I've heard plenty about it
 
00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
heard it
 
00:28:33.669 --> 00:28:33.679 align:start position:0%
discussed uh but I was uh this very this
 
00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:36.320 align:start position:0%
very subject matter uh
 
00:28:39.789 --> 00:28:39.799 align:start position:0%
was about the first 10 years of my
 
00:28:42.149 --> 00:28:42.159 align:start position:0%

00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
contracted on behalf of all the
 
00:29:01.269 --> 00:29:01.279 align:start position:0%
utilities in New England to design uh
 
00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
consistent programs design programs uh
 
00:29:07.909 --> 00:29:07.919 align:start position:0%
so that all of that program
 
00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
design um planning and coordinate could
 
00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:13.640 align:start position:0%
be done efficiently across States so
 
00:29:15.789 --> 00:29:15.799 align:start position:0%
that every state didn't have to every
 
00:29:17.269 --> 00:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
utility in every state didn't have to
 
00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:19.000 align:start position:0%
invent their own programs and Implement
 
00:29:20.269 --> 00:29:20.279 align:start position:0%
their own programs and do all the
 
00:29:24.029 --> 00:29:24.039 align:start position:0%
science and Analysis behind it anyway um
 
00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:25.640 align:start position:0%
all of that stuff is pretty well
 
00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:27.480 align:start position:0%
established you know Energy Efficiency
 
00:29:29.789 --> 00:29:29.799 align:start position:0%
programs run by utilities across the
 
00:29:31.549 --> 00:29:31.559 align:start position:0%
country have been in place for you know
 
00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:36.440 align:start position:0%
30 years um and so you know energy
 
00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
conservation measures and payback
 
00:29:42.549 --> 00:29:42.559 align:start position:0%
analysis uh it's kind of a it's kind of
 
00:29:46.269 --> 00:29:46.279 align:start position:0%
a science and expertise and it doesn't
 
00:29:50.149 --> 00:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
change you know year to year every three
 
00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:52.600 align:start position:0%
years uh
 
00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:55.470 align:start position:0%
years uh
but

00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:55.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:29:58.830 --> 00:29:58.840 align:start position:0%
um the testimony that we heard yesterday
 
00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
in this room from the consumer
 
00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:03.269 align:start position:0%
in this room from the consumer
Advocate

00:30:03.269 --> 00:30:03.279 align:start position:0%
Advocate
 
00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:08.360 align:start position:0%
about you know the um anyway that whole
 
00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
the testimony from from Don cre
 
00:30:13.549 --> 00:30:13.559 align:start position:0%
yesterday uh that concerned partly the
 
00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:17.200 align:start position:0%
dynamic between the Pu and the our own
 
00:30:21.389 --> 00:30:21.399 align:start position:0%
Department of energy uh the Pu refusing
 
00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:26.600 align:start position:0%
to stay in its Lane as no longer the
 
00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
policy making
 
00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:32.720 align:start position:0%
executive branch uh
 
00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:35.430 align:start position:0%
executive branch uh
entity

00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:35.440 align:start position:0%
entity
 
00:30:38.789 --> 00:30:38.799 align:start position:0%
uh um and the lack of deference that the
 
00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:42.760 align:start position:0%
Pu has showed to parties who bring a
 
00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:45.320 align:start position:0%
settlement agreement to the Pu for
 
00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:48.200 align:start position:0%
approval which of course was the whole
 
00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:49.640 align:start position:0%
controversy three years ago with the
 
00:30:51.669 --> 00:30:51.679 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency programs they were
 
00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:53.960 align:start position:0%
brought you know by the utilities by the
 
00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:56.120 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate by the
 
00:30:58.310 --> 00:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
interveners another set of here's the
 
00:31:00.669 --> 00:31:00.679 align:start position:0%
next three-year
 
00:31:04.269 --> 00:31:04.279 align:start position:0%
um set of of Energy Efficiency programs
 
00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
and the Pu suddenly decided it had bet
 
00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:09.320 align:start position:0%
knew more
 
00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
and and and just blew it
 
00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
up you know
 
00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
and that should all that what we heard
 
00:31:19.029 --> 00:31:19.039 align:start position:0%
yesterday should be ringing in our ears
 
00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
when we're thinking about this because I
 
00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
see this bill as the Public Utilities
 
00:31:26.629 --> 00:31:26.639 align:start position:0%
Commission trying to again get get out
 
00:31:30.389 --> 00:31:30.399 align:start position:0%
of its Lane and assert itself and say oh
 
00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:33.080 align:start position:0%
well we suddenly have all we with our
 
00:31:36.269 --> 00:31:36.279 align:start position:0%
whatever we are third remaining 13 or 15
 
00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:38.440 align:start position:0%
staff suddenly have all kinds of
 
00:31:40.149 --> 00:31:40.159 align:start position:0%
expertise where we're going to dig into
 
00:31:42.389 --> 00:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:45.320 align:start position:0%
uh analysis that has long undergirded
 
00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
these programs and as representative
 
00:31:50.909 --> 00:31:50.919 align:start position:0%
McGee cited they've been shown to have a
 
00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
3.8 3.7 to1 doll return uh for every
 
00:31:58.470 --> 00:31:58.480 align:start position:0%
dollar spent in the programs that is
 
00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
rate payers customers who take advantage
 
00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
of the programs experience $3.8 in in uh
 
00:32:07.509 --> 00:32:07.519 align:start position:0%
Energy savings over over certain
 
00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
durations you know and the to the
 
00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
economy uh but that but with the the
 
00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:15.480 align:start position:0%
lifetime of the measures is is so
 
00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:17.480 align:start position:0%
there's like if you don't it's really
 
00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:21.240 align:start position:0%
Arcane stuff but um you know every
 
00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:23.320 align:start position:0%
energy conservation measure has a
 
00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
duration over what time period should
 
00:32:27.549 --> 00:32:27.559 align:start position:0%
the should the savings be counted and I
 
00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
see that that basically um what's a foot
 
00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:34.600 align:start position:0%
here is is POL people differing on
 
00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
policy who want to get into it in the
 
00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:40.240 align:start position:0%
name of we have more expertise and
 
00:32:42.509 --> 00:32:42.519 align:start position:0%
suddenly we're going to decide that you
 
00:32:44.110 --> 00:32:44.120 align:start position:0%
know those savings don't last so long
 
00:32:45.669 --> 00:32:45.679 align:start position:0%
we're going to make a pol policy
 
00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
decision to to not count that as
 
00:32:50.669 --> 00:32:50.679 align:start position:0%
savings um and and we're going to we're
 
00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
going to change this up and it it's not
 
00:32:58.389 --> 00:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
necessary and it's not um
 
00:33:01.269 --> 00:33:01.279 align:start position:0%
it's not valid uh there's a lot of
 
00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
experience history and uh proven coste
 
00:33:07.549 --> 00:33:07.559 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness that that are in these
 
00:33:09.389 --> 00:33:09.399 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency programs that our
 
00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
utilities run and that utilities across
 
00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:14.360 align:start position:0%
New England across the country run uh
 
00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:15.880 align:start position:0%
and it's not necessary to every three
 
00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:17.960 align:start position:0%
years give our puuc the ability to start
 
00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:20.840 align:start position:0%
tinkering in there and again going to
 
00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:23.240 align:start position:0%
the stability of these programs that
 
00:33:25.269 --> 00:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
customers not just residential
 
00:33:27.389 --> 00:33:27.399 align:start position:0%
businesses Industries count on being
 
00:33:27.399 --> 00:33:28.669 align:start position:0%
businesses Industries count on being
available

00:33:28.669 --> 00:33:28.679 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
and that the businesses who are part of
 
00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
that uh little part of our economy
 
00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
insulation weatherization providers
 
00:33:38.029 --> 00:33:38.039 align:start position:0%
which we were talking about yesterday
 
00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
weatherization uh those are small
 
00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
businesses and medium-sized businesses
 
00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
that are involved in in the supply of
 
00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency Services and measures
 
00:33:52.029 --> 00:33:52.039 align:start position:0%
and you can't just have this make it
 
00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
into law that well every three years we
 
00:33:56.190 --> 00:33:56.200 align:start position:0%
might pull the rug out from under this
 
00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
because we don't we just we we've
 
00:34:00.789 --> 00:34:00.799 align:start position:0%
decided suddenly among our little staff
 
00:34:04.629 --> 00:34:04.639 align:start position:0%
that um you know we know better so I I
 
00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:07.280 align:start position:0%
don't like this bill at
 
00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:10.040 align:start position:0%
all yeah I kind of got that
 
00:34:12.589 --> 00:34:12.599 align:start position:0%
impression although I am I will say I am
 
00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:15.800 align:start position:0%
kind of astounded that you feel that uh
 
00:34:18.109 --> 00:34:18.119 align:start position:0%
a program as huge as this one doesn't
 
00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:21.720 align:start position:0%
require any oversight that that kind of
 
00:34:23.869 --> 00:34:23.879 align:start position:0%
baffles that is not that is not what I'm
 
00:34:28.109 --> 00:34:28.119 align:start position:0%
saying ber plenty of oversight
 
00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:30.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so I I look at the
 
00:34:33.109 --> 00:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
language in this bill and it still says
 
00:34:36.990 --> 00:34:37.000 align:start position:0%
the grand state test is the primary test
 
00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
with the addition of the Total Resource
 
00:34:42.430 --> 00:34:42.440 align:start position:0%
test as a secondary It also says that
 
00:34:46.149 --> 00:34:46.159 align:start position:0%
they the appy may consider some
 
00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
modifications in the adjudicative
 
00:34:50.829 --> 00:34:50.839 align:start position:0%
process it doesn't say they're going to
 
00:34:53.589 --> 00:34:53.599 align:start position:0%
throw the whole thing out and we're
 
00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:55.720 align:start position:0%
going to start with a new bathtub and
 
00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:02.720 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that is the intent nor
 
00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
is that going to be the the process that
 
00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:07.400 align:start position:0%
will be follow please wait till you're
 
00:35:11.829 --> 00:35:11.839 align:start position:0%
recognized to speak so uh I I do not
 
00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
find this a unacceptable bill I think
 
00:35:18.829 --> 00:35:18.839 align:start position:0%
it's a a good opportunity to allow the
 
00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
commission to use new
 
00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
analysis as it may be
 
00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate representative Harrington
 
00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
yeah a couple of quick things one thing
 
00:35:32.069 --> 00:35:32.079 align:start position:0%
that was said earlier which which I
 
00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:33.240 align:start position:0%
totally don't agree with because I don't
 
00:35:34.750 --> 00:35:34.760 align:start position:0%
think it's correct is that every
 
00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:37.160 align:start position:0%
megawatt we save saves money for
 
00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
everybody if you look at the demand
 
00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:41.560 align:start position:0%
curve it's basically pretty flat only
 
00:35:43.349 --> 00:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
during peak times you can cut a
 
00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:45.640 align:start position:0%
substantial number of uh megawatts from
 
00:35:47.470 --> 00:35:47.480 align:start position:0%
demand and it has no effect at lowering
 
00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
rates because that curve is very very
 
00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
flat until it gets to the peak times
 
00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:53.720 align:start position:0%
when it then every megawatt really
 
00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:56.240 align:start position:0%
really makes a difference uh the second
 
00:35:58.710 --> 00:35:58.720 align:start position:0%
thing I want to make and this concept
 
00:36:01.349 --> 00:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
somehow that because a small business is
 
00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
getting subsidies through rate payers to
 
00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
install whe whatever they were
 
00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
installing weather stripping uh
 
00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
insulation whatever that sometime that
 
00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
gives them a permanent rate right to
 
00:36:13.150 --> 00:36:13.160 align:start position:0%
collect that money forever just isn't
 
00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
correct they're getting money because of
 
00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:16.520 align:start position:0%
a government edict the government
 
00:36:18.109 --> 00:36:18.119 align:start position:0%
obviously has the ability to take that
 
00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
away at any time they they don't grant
 
00:36:22.589 --> 00:36:22.599 align:start position:0%
them any right when they get that and in
 
00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
third this they're talking about the Pu
 
00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:28.520 align:start position:0%
as if they have nothing to do with this
 
00:36:31.589 --> 00:36:31.599 align:start position:0%
this is part of setting rates the Pu is
 
00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:32.920 align:start position:0%
the one who sets the rates they
 
00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
determine what the utility is going to
 
00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
get uh for a rate and the effectiveness
 
00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:40.440 align:start position:0%
of these programs is part of that rate
 
00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:42.040 align:start position:0%
so obviously they're the person who
 
00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
should be involved in doing it and again
 
00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:46.440 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in here that says they
 
00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
have to change anything it simply gives
 
00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:50.680 align:start position:0%
them the flexibility to open an
 
00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
adjudicative proceeding and to look at
 
00:36:54.430 --> 00:36:54.440 align:start position:0%
something that at this case is going to
 
00:36:57.150 --> 00:36:57.160 align:start position:0%
be five six seven years old and see if
 
00:36:59.430 --> 00:36:59.440 align:start position:0%
things changed maybe the way we're
 
00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:03.480 align:start position:0%
producing energy in 2028 or 2030 might
 
00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:06.520 align:start position:0%
be different such that these uh Energy
 
00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
Efficiency methods need to change I
 
00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:11.000 align:start position:0%
don't know but I don't want to lock the
 
00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:13.800 align:start position:0%
uh the hands of the Pu to even consider
 
00:37:16.309 --> 00:37:16.319 align:start position:0%
that and again this is part of rates
 
00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
because the rate payers are paying for
 
00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
the Energy Efficiency cost so setting
 
00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:23.440 align:start position:0%
that how those works is part of setting
 
00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
rates and that's the purview of the Pu
 
00:37:30.430 --> 00:37:30.440 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has a comment
 
00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:32.069 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has a comment
thank

00:37:32.069 --> 00:37:32.079 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:37:32.079 --> 00:37:33.870 align:start position:0%
thank
you

00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:33.880 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
um so um chairman Vose asked
 
00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:42.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner chatt chatab I gu I have
 
00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
trouble saying it um asked him
 
00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
uh that the the granted state test
 
00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't capture all the costs the Total
 
00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
Resource test doesn't capture all the
 
00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
benefits together do they capture all
 
00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
the cost and benefits and the answer was
 
00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:58.390 align:start position:0%
the cost and benefits and the answer was
no

00:37:58.390 --> 00:37:58.400 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:38:01.829 --> 00:38:01.839 align:start position:0%
um and and the commissioner said that
 
00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:03.240 align:start position:0%
the bill would be a step in the right
 
00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:05.720 align:start position:0%
direction then I asked all right if we
 
00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
need a new test who creates the test and
 
00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
the commissioner's answer would was that
 
00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
it would be part of a pu
 
00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:17.720 align:start position:0%
docket so one possible way to go here
 
00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:22.640 align:start position:0%
would be to have the Pu open a docket
 
00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
and look for a new test but that the
 
00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
legislature would have to approve this
 
00:38:30.430 --> 00:38:30.440 align:start position:0%
new test just like the legislature
 
00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
approved the granite state test give the
 
00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
Pu the flexibility if you really want to
 
00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:38.720 align:start position:0%
try to come up with a new test go for it
 
00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:40.760 align:start position:0%
but you don't get to actually use it
 
00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:49.109 --> 00:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
it interesting idea further comments on
 
00:38:49.119 --> 00:38:50.910 align:start position:0%
it interesting idea further comments on
this

00:38:50.910 --> 00:38:50.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:38:53.790 --> 00:38:53.800 align:start position:0%
amendment uh representative
 
00:38:56.510 --> 00:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
Kaplan yeah I mean I think that that's a
 
00:38:58.470 --> 00:38:58.480 align:start position:0%
a possible solution what representative
 
00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:00.520 align:start position:0%
Corman just mentioned I just fear that
 
00:39:03.069 --> 00:39:03.079 align:start position:0%
we we've we went through a similar
 
00:39:06.069 --> 00:39:06.079 align:start position:0%
docket not too long ago and at the end
 
00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
of the day who's going to pay for that
 
00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:10.440 align:start position:0%
docket you know that that's just money
 
00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
what all this is about is money and
 
00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to be spending money to
 
00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:16.640 align:start position:0%
develop a new
 
00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
test you know and as as we heard here
 
00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
just recently I mean the grand state
 
00:39:23.589 --> 00:39:23.599 align:start position:0%
test is an adequate test it considers
 
00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:24.760 align:start position:0%
some of the costs and some of the
 
00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:26.440 align:start position:0%
benefits it doesn't provide a total
 
00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:29.680 align:start position:0%
picture so opening up that can of worms
 
00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:32.200 align:start position:0%
again that's a debate that can go on
 
00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
forever you know so I mean we have an
 
00:39:38.589 --> 00:39:38.599 align:start position:0%
adequate test as it is and do we want to
 
00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
just go down that road again I'm not
 
00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:46.309 --> 00:39:46.319 align:start position:0%
spending okay any further comment
 
00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
representative McGee thank you Mr chair
 
00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
yeah I'd just like to draw attention to
 
00:39:52.069 --> 00:39:52.079 align:start position:0%
the fact that we have a couple of people
 
00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
in the audience who are actually
 
00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
responsible for these uh the New
 
00:39:57.990 --> 00:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire saves program for their
 
00:39:59.710 --> 00:39:59.720 align:start position:0%
organizations and people who were
 
00:40:01.589 --> 00:40:01.599 align:start position:0%
formerly on the Energy Efficiency and
 
00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
sustainable energy board the easy board
 
00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:06.760 align:start position:0%
um these are the folks that go uh in
 
00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
front of the Public Utilities Commission
 
00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:12.640 align:start position:0%
with those plans and justify them and
 
00:40:15.589 --> 00:40:15.599 align:start position:0%
help put together reports um basically
 
00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
you know they're required to
 
00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:20.680 align:start position:0%
justify uh the plans so it's not like
 
00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
the Pu doesn't already have oversight
 
00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
and information from people who have
 
00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
subject matter expertise
 
00:40:29.870 --> 00:40:29.880 align:start position:0%
the that's what they are that's their
 
00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:31.960 align:start position:0%
job their job is Energy Efficiency
 
00:40:34.069 --> 00:40:34.079 align:start position:0%
programs in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
and making sure that the Public
 
00:40:37.870 --> 00:40:37.880 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission has what it needs
 
00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
in order to okay those plans so it it's
 
00:40:42.910 --> 00:40:42.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of times when we talk about bills
 
00:40:44.589 --> 00:40:44.599 align:start position:0%
where people don't have
 
00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
any uh firsthand knowledge everyone just
 
00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
gets in their head what how they think
 
00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:53.480 align:start position:0%
this thing occurs um there isn't
 
00:40:56.349 --> 00:40:56.359 align:start position:0%
actually U that I'm aware of a problem
 
00:40:58.190 --> 00:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
here that is in need of solving in terms
 
00:40:59.910 --> 00:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
of the stakeholders but it sounds like
 
00:41:02.069 --> 00:41:02.079 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission is
 
00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
looking for some kind of definition that
 
00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:08.680 align:start position:0%
um as representative Kaplan said the
 
00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
debate could go on a very long time as
 
00:41:12.349 --> 00:41:12.359 align:start position:0%
to what is the correct thing to be
 
00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
looking at um it took a really long time
 
00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
to get everyone to agree that the
 
00:41:21.589 --> 00:41:21.599 align:start position:0%
granite state test was an adequate test
 
00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:25.880 align:start position:0%
so so why why are we circling um I would
 
00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:28.720 align:start position:0%
not be in of this bill because what it
 
00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
does is it gives an open-ended process
 
00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
to a group of um you know appointed
 
00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
folks who do not have subject matter
 
00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:40.040 align:start position:0%
expertise in this particular thing I
 
00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:43.000 align:start position:0%
mean I know that the most vocal person
 
00:41:45.150 --> 00:41:45.160 align:start position:0%
on the Public Utilities Commission I
 
00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
listened to his appointment in front of
 
00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
the executive councel he had no energy
 
00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:52.200 align:start position:0%
experience at all when he was hired to
 
00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:54.160 align:start position:0%
that job and that can happen you can be
 
00:41:55.829 --> 00:41:55.839 align:start position:0%
appointed for other other things that
 
00:41:57.670 --> 00:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
you're good at and finance is one of the
 
00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
things he was good at um
 
00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:06.200 align:start position:0%
but to be acquiescing as a legislature
 
00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
to a bill that is vague from someone who
 
00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
does not have subject matter expertise
 
00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
who is telling us give me the ability to
 
00:42:15.109 --> 00:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
question the people who do know what
 
00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
they're doing because I don't know if
 
00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:18.680 align:start position:0%
they know what they're doing I think
 
00:42:21.069 --> 00:42:21.079 align:start position:0%
we're we're creating a problem if we put
 
00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
if we put this bill forward and I do I
 
00:42:27.589 --> 00:42:27.599 align:start position:0%
am um verbose
 
00:42:31.109 --> 00:42:31.119 align:start position:0%
I am a chatty Kathy but I don't normally
 
00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:34.400 align:start position:0%
proze like this and this is a small Bill
 
00:42:37.150 --> 00:42:37.160 align:start position:0%
really but I really don't think it's a
 
00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
good bill and um and I I hope that
 
00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:42.640 align:start position:0%
you'll consider the fact that what it
 
00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:45.839 align:start position:0%
does is it opens a door to give the
 
00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission the ability
 
00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:51.200 align:start position:0%
to say yes or no to anything that comes
 
00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
before them and to open an adjudicative
 
00:42:56.430 --> 00:42:56.440 align:start position:0%
proceeding where they are the end all of
 
00:42:58.270 --> 00:42:58.280 align:start position:0%
the decision
 
00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:01.240 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't it hasn't provided us
 
00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
with any more information about what
 
00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:05.680 align:start position:0%
we're enabling so it isn't it just isn't
 
00:43:08.549 --> 00:43:08.559 align:start position:0%
a good bill from that standpoint and I
 
00:43:13.630 --> 00:43:13.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:16.150 --> 00:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
idea okay we have two other bills we
 
00:43:19.870 --> 00:43:19.880 align:start position:0%
need to discuss representative Swanson
 
00:43:22.589 --> 00:43:22.599 align:start position:0%
thank you so in summary of the things
 
00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:25.480 align:start position:0%
that I've heard do we get close enough
 
00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:29.240 align:start position:0%
to good enough With The Changes suggest
 
00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:30.680 align:start position:0%
with a change suggested by
 
00:43:33.109 --> 00:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
representative Corman I mean is that in
 
00:43:37.710 --> 00:43:37.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:39.720 align:start position:0%
feasibility I guess that would be a
 
00:43:42.309 --> 00:43:42.319 align:start position:0%
discussion that uh individual caucuses
 
00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
would have but that's not what's on the
 
00:43:48.829 --> 00:43:48.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:51.109 --> 00:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
moment all right let's talk about a
 
00:43:55.069 --> 00:43:55.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:57.390 --> 00:43:57.400 align:start position:0%
here so the next bill we want want to
 
00:43:57.400 --> 00:43:59.270 align:start position:0%
here so the next bill we want want to
discuss

00:43:59.270 --> 00:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
discuss
 
00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
is House Bill
 
00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:04.230 align:start position:0%
is House Bill
672

00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
672
 
00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
FN that's a bill that is designed to
 
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
allow for off-grid electricity providers
 
00:44:12.870 --> 00:44:12.880 align:start position:0%
in New
 
00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:14.910 align:start position:0%
in New
Hampshire

00:44:14.910 --> 00:44:14.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:44:18.750 --> 00:44:18.760 align:start position:0%
and I have a relatively small Amendment
 
00:44:21.589 --> 00:44:21.599 align:start position:0%
here that basically just cleans up a
 
00:44:24.030 --> 00:44:24.040 align:start position:0%
couple of ambiguities in the
 
00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
original legislation so let's pass that
 
00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:28.790 align:start position:0%
original legislation so let's pass that
out

00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
changes while that's happening I'll
 
00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:40.240 align:start position:0%
remind everybody that this is enabling
 
00:44:44.589 --> 00:44:44.599 align:start position:0%
legislation and all it does is Define
 
00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:48.400 align:start position:0%
what an off-grid electricity provider is
 
00:44:50.349 --> 00:44:50.359 align:start position:0%
and in a moment we'll discover what it
 
00:44:51.230 --> 00:44:51.240 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:53.190 align:start position:0%
it is
not

00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:53.200 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:44:57.710 --> 00:44:57.720 align:start position:0%
and also defines that or or state
 
00:44:59.910 --> 00:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
that such an off-grid electricity
 
00:45:02.829 --> 00:45:02.839 align:start position:0%
provider would essentially be
 
00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
unregulated not subject to uh regulation
 
00:45:10.069 --> 00:45:10.079 align:start position:0%
but there will be a few minor exceptions
 
00:45:10.079 --> 00:45:13.109 align:start position:0%
but there will be a few minor exceptions
to

00:45:13.109 --> 00:45:13.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:15.630 --> 00:45:15.640 align:start position:0%
that so does everyone have a copy of the
 
00:45:18.150 --> 00:45:18.160 align:start position:0%
amendment at this
 
00:45:22.390 --> 00:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
point okay so here are the changes
 
00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:25.349 align:start position:0%
point okay so here are the changes
online

00:45:25.349 --> 00:45:25.359 align:start position:0%
online
 
00:45:28.670 --> 00:45:28.680 align:start position:0%
nine after the word boundaries there is
 
00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
a new sentence added off-grid
 
00:45:37.069 --> 00:45:37.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:39.200 align:start position:0%
Utilities that would probably seem
 
00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:42.990 align:start position:0%
Utilities that would probably seem
obvious

00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:43.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:46.720 align:start position:0%
but it was suggested to me that stating
 
00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
that explicitly in the legislation is a
 
00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:51.390 align:start position:0%
that explicitly in the legislation is a
good

00:45:51.390 --> 00:45:51.400 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:45:57.230 --> 00:45:57.240 align:start position:0%
idea the next change is down on line 14
 
00:46:03.309 --> 00:46:03.319 align:start position:0%
where it says um shall be exempt from
 
00:46:04.829 --> 00:46:04.839 align:start position:0%
previously that
 
00:46:10.510 --> 00:46:10.520 align:start position:0%
said from this title and it was
 
00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:12.280 align:start position:0%
suggested that we might want to spell
 
00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:14.720 align:start position:0%
out what this title is so it now says
 
00:46:17.309 --> 00:46:17.319 align:start position:0%
RSA title
 
00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
34 which is the title in our r rsas that
 
00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:23.990 align:start position:0%
34 which is the title in our r rsas that
encompasses

00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
encompasses
 
00:46:28.150 --> 00:46:28.160 align:start position:0%
all energy regulation
 
00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:31.240 align:start position:0%
the next change is on line
 
00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
15 after the word regulations I added a
 
00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:37.240 align:start position:0%
comma and
 
00:46:40.870 --> 00:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
the phrase such as Municipal and state
 
00:46:45.190 --> 00:46:45.200 align:start position:0%
highway safety regulations and another
 
00:46:50.309 --> 00:46:50.319 align:start position:0%
comma that was to indicate that while
 
00:46:52.390 --> 00:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
these facilities would be basically
 
00:46:56.109 --> 00:46:56.119 align:start position:0%
unregulated by energy law they're not
 
00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
exempt from um other laws that apply
 
00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
particularly health and safety
 
00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:05.880 align:start position:0%
laws and then the final change is on
 
00:47:09.670 --> 00:47:09.680 align:start position:0%
line 20 and once again it just
 
00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:11.270 align:start position:0%
line 20 and once again it just
changes

00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
changes
 
00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:13.270 align:start position:0%
changes
U

00:47:13.270 --> 00:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
U
 
00:47:18.109 --> 00:47:18.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:21.950 --> 00:47:21.960 align:start position:0%
read provisions of this title to read
 
00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
provisions of RSA title
 
00:47:28.390 --> 00:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
34 so those are the changes to the that
 
00:47:31.109 --> 00:47:31.119 align:start position:0%
the amendment makes
 
00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
and I'd appreciate any comments
 
00:47:35.870 --> 00:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
representative rolds thank you Mr
 
00:47:39.230 --> 00:47:39.240 align:start position:0%
chairman um I think appreciate the
 
00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
changes I think they're good changes
 
00:47:45.950 --> 00:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
um my just just just a question dealing
 
00:47:48.670 --> 00:47:48.680 align:start position:0%
with uh the last one that you
 
00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned um it seems to me that I mean
 
00:47:54.589 --> 00:47:54.599 align:start position:0%
because you called out specifically
 
00:47:56.309 --> 00:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
Municipal and state highway safety
 
00:47:56.319 --> 00:47:57.910 align:start position:0%
Municipal and state highway safety
regulations

00:47:57.910 --> 00:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
um and you do say they shall remain
 
00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:03.240 align:start position:0%
subject to all other applicable laws and
 
00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:06.160 align:start position:0%
regulations so I guess things like fire
 
00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:09.680 align:start position:0%
codes uh electrical codes all that I
 
00:48:12.109 --> 00:48:12.119 align:start position:0%
guess would fall under that it seems uh
 
00:48:14.910 --> 00:48:14.920 align:start position:0%
enormously significant if if a town had
 
00:48:18.549 --> 00:48:18.559 align:start position:0%
you know giant uh electricity generator
 
00:48:18.559 --> 00:48:19.790 align:start position:0%
you know giant uh electricity generator
and

00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:48:23.150 --> 00:48:23.160 align:start position:0%
Battery that um towns would be very
 
00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:24.750 align:start position:0%
Battery that um towns would be very
concerned

00:48:24.750 --> 00:48:24.760 align:start position:0%
concerned
 
00:48:27.829 --> 00:48:27.839 align:start position:0%
um so I guess it's it's in there all
 
00:48:29.390 --> 00:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
other applicable laws and regulations
 
00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:34.240 align:start position:0%
maybe it's NE codes to mention codes um
 
00:48:36.190 --> 00:48:36.200 align:start position:0%
maybe it's
 
00:48:40.589 --> 00:48:40.599 align:start position:0%
assumed okay thanks you're welcome rep
 
00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
uh representative Harrington yeah I just
 
00:48:44.549 --> 00:48:44.559 align:start position:0%
had a question because I'm looking back
 
00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
up my notes from this
 
00:48:49.710 --> 00:48:49.720 align:start position:0%
and on line nine when it says does not
 
00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
cross state boundaries I'm not even sure
 
00:48:54.030 --> 00:48:54.040 align:start position:0%
what that means do it mean State
 
00:48:56.309 --> 00:48:56.319 align:start position:0%
boundaries like the boundary between New
 
00:48:58.950 --> 00:48:58.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in Vermont or is it the
 
00:49:01.710 --> 00:49:01.720 align:start position:0%
boundary between property that's not
 
00:49:03.589 --> 00:49:03.599 align:start position:0%
owned by the state and property that is
 
00:49:05.910 --> 00:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
owned by the state so that to me is not
 
00:49:08.069 --> 00:49:08.079 align:start position:0%
really clear and I have a note here
 
00:49:10.750 --> 00:49:10.760 align:start position:0%
about no Crossing government land or
 
00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:13.160 align:start position:0%
roads and I'm trying to think back if
 
00:49:16.589 --> 00:49:16.599 align:start position:0%
any particular regulations kick in uh if
 
00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
you putting like a transmission line
 
00:49:22.789 --> 00:49:22.799 align:start position:0%
across a um a government-owned road or
 
00:49:25.470 --> 00:49:25.480 align:start position:0%
highway I think that automatically kicks
 
00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
into some additional regulation it may
 
00:49:29.109 --> 00:49:29.119 align:start position:0%
even get the site evaluation Committee
 
00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
involved and I just wonder if we have to
 
00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:33.480 align:start position:0%
address that in this
 
00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
bill the amendment actually addresses
 
00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:40.640 align:start position:0%
that first off the original bill and the
 
00:49:44.589 --> 00:49:44.599 align:start position:0%
amendment specifically mentions RSA 162
 
00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:46.640 align:start position:0%
which is the site evaluation or the
 
00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
sighting Bill the sighting
 
00:49:53.589 --> 00:49:53.599 align:start position:0%
statute and the phrase that I added such
 
00:49:56.030 --> 00:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
as Municipal and state highway safety
 
00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:57.470 align:start position:0%
as Municipal and state highway safety
regulations

00:49:57.470 --> 00:49:57.480 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
would cover the issue that you just
 
00:50:02.430 --> 00:50:02.440 align:start position:0%
raised about a transmission line
 
00:50:05.630 --> 00:50:05.640 align:start position:0%
crossing a highway either a municipal or
 
00:50:07.349 --> 00:50:07.359 align:start position:0%
State Highway they would have
 
00:50:10.030 --> 00:50:10.040 align:start position:0%
to abide by any
 
00:50:13.190 --> 00:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
regulations regarding that
 
00:50:15.870 --> 00:50:15.880 align:start position:0%
Crossing and with regard to cross state
 
00:50:19.390 --> 00:50:19.400 align:start position:0%
boundaries I think that that's fairly
 
00:50:23.430 --> 00:50:23.440 align:start position:0%
standard um terminology to
 
00:50:26.829 --> 00:50:26.839 align:start position:0%
indicate the demarcation between one
 
00:50:29.069 --> 00:50:29.079 align:start position:0%
State and another state so yes we're
 
00:50:31.870 --> 00:50:31.880 align:start position:0%
talking about the the state line between
 
00:50:34.710 --> 00:50:34.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and
 
00:50:37.109 --> 00:50:37.119 align:start position:0%
Vermont further discussion
 
00:50:37.119 --> 00:50:39.230 align:start position:0%
Vermont further discussion
representative

00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:39.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:50:42.670 --> 00:50:42.680 align:start position:0%
McGee thank you Mr chair yeah I I just
 
00:50:44.829 --> 00:50:44.839 align:start position:0%
went in to look at
 
00:50:49.390 --> 00:50:49.400 align:start position:0%
34 um RSA 34 in terms of what we're
 
00:50:53.630 --> 00:50:53.640 align:start position:0%
exempting um these generators from and I
 
00:50:55.789 --> 00:50:55.799 align:start position:0%
I don't understand honestly I don't
 
00:50:57.069 --> 00:50:57.079 align:start position:0%
understand how it would work I
 
00:50:59.230 --> 00:50:59.240 align:start position:0%
understand it's intended to be enabling
 
00:51:02.109 --> 00:51:02.119 align:start position:0%
legislation but it's saying that these
 
00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:04.720 align:start position:0%
these folks can transmit and
 
00:51:07.829 --> 00:51:07.839 align:start position:0%
distribute um and sell electricity at
 
00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
retail prices to Consumers if they're
 
00:51:15.150 --> 00:51:15.160 align:start position:0%
not connected but all of the rules that
 
00:51:19.950 --> 00:51:19.960 align:start position:0%
are under um RSA 34 Public Utilities
 
00:51:21.710 --> 00:51:21.720 align:start position:0%
they're not considered public utilities
 
00:51:25.230 --> 00:51:25.240 align:start position:0%
but these are basically all the rules um
 
00:51:28.030 --> 00:51:28.040 align:start position:0%
in terms of what happens if there's a
 
00:51:30.630 --> 00:51:30.640 align:start position:0%
violation um you know uh if there are
 
00:51:33.789 --> 00:51:33.799 align:start position:0%
false entries if there's negligence so
 
00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:36.880 align:start position:0%
we're exempting folks that they can just
 
00:51:38.750 --> 00:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
go do whatever they want to do and there
 
00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
isn't anybody who has oversight for them
 
00:51:45.349 --> 00:51:45.359 align:start position:0%
and it it says other rules apply but why
 
00:51:47.829 --> 00:51:47.839 align:start position:0%
wouldn't these rules apply even though
 
00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:50.240 align:start position:0%
they were designed originally for
 
00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:52.440 align:start position:0%
utilities that's because only utilities
 
00:51:55.349 --> 00:51:55.359 align:start position:0%
were running gas operations and electric
 
00:51:55.359 --> 00:51:56.870 align:start position:0%
were running gas operations and electric
distribution

00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
distribution
 
00:52:03.150 --> 00:52:03.160 align:start position:0%
um why would we exempt folks from all of
 
00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:05.480 align:start position:0%
these there's no reporting there's no
 
00:52:08.230 --> 00:52:08.240 align:start position:0%
oversight there's no there's no way to
 
00:52:09.630 --> 00:52:09.640 align:start position:0%
Corral somebody even if they're doing
 
00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:18.630 --> 00:52:18.640 align:start position:0%
illegal so this is a bill designed to
 
00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:20.309 align:start position:0%
illegal so this is a bill designed to
unleash

00:52:20.309 --> 00:52:20.319 align:start position:0%
unleash
 
00:52:22.670 --> 00:52:22.680 align:start position:0%
Innovation and it it was originally
 
00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:23.950 align:start position:0%
Innovation and it it was originally
called

00:52:23.950 --> 00:52:23.960 align:start position:0%
called
 
00:52:27.589 --> 00:52:27.599 align:start position:0%
customer regulated
 
00:52:30.549 --> 00:52:30.559 align:start position:0%
energy and the reason it was called
 
00:52:33.150 --> 00:52:33.160 align:start position:0%
customer regulated is because
 
00:52:35.150 --> 00:52:35.160 align:start position:0%
essentially there would have to be a
 
00:52:37.510 --> 00:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
contract between the provider of the
 
00:52:40.030 --> 00:52:40.040 align:start position:0%
electricity and the buyer of the
 
00:52:44.789 --> 00:52:44.799 align:start position:0%
electricity so the contract would be
 
00:52:51.069 --> 00:52:51.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:53.549 --> 00:52:53.559 align:start position:0%
um I'm drawing a blank on the right word
 
00:52:56.270 --> 00:52:56.280 align:start position:0%
here but the contract would be the the
 
00:52:59.470 --> 00:52:59.480 align:start position:0%
the thing that that controls or that
 
00:53:01.990 --> 00:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
governs the relationship between the the
 
00:53:05.430 --> 00:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
buyer and the seller and it would have
 
00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:06.710 align:start position:0%
buyer and the seller and it would have
within

00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:06.720 align:start position:0%
within
 
00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
it all of the legal requirements that
 
00:53:13.549 --> 00:53:13.559 align:start position:0%
one party would want to impose on the
 
00:53:17.589 --> 00:53:17.599 align:start position:0%
other uh and vice versa they obviously a
 
00:53:21.470 --> 00:53:21.480 align:start position:0%
contract is a negotiated document
 
00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:25.960 align:start position:0%
so that's the kind of Regulation that
 
00:53:28.069 --> 00:53:28.079 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:53:29.870 --> 00:53:29.880 align:start position:0%
that would happen here it would be
 
00:53:32.910 --> 00:53:32.920 align:start position:0%
strictly regulated by the buyer and the
 
00:53:36.230 --> 00:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
seller as long as it didn't interfere
 
00:53:38.470 --> 00:53:38.480 align:start position:0%
with Municipal and state highway safety
 
00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
regulations as stated in the bill and as
 
00:53:45.309 --> 00:53:45.319 align:start position:0%
long as it conformed to the precepts of
 
00:53:49.109 --> 00:53:49.119 align:start position:0%
our sighting statute so there is no
 
00:53:54.270 --> 00:53:54.280 align:start position:0%
other NE uh regulation required here and
 
00:53:57.109 --> 00:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
the reason the bill exists
 
00:54:01.270 --> 00:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
is to establish that no other regulation
 
00:54:04.870 --> 00:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
is required to govern this relationship
 
00:54:10.549 --> 00:54:10.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:13.470 --> 00:54:13.480 align:start position:0%
seller representative Wendy Thomas thank
 
00:54:15.990 --> 00:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um in my notes from the
 
00:54:20.670 --> 00:54:20.680 align:start position:0%
hearing I have um I I I took note of
 
00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
off-grid pricing um and specifically
 
00:54:27.270 --> 00:54:27.280 align:start position:0%
that Texas rates were raised during
 
00:54:30.109 --> 00:54:30.119 align:start position:0%
severe weather events um and I also
 
00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
wrote that this creates a situation
 
00:54:34.589 --> 00:54:34.599 align:start position:0%
where customers are held
 
00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
hostage um I have con I have great
 
00:54:40.990 --> 00:54:41.000 align:start position:0%
concerns um about setting up these
 
00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:42.589 align:start position:0%
concerns um about setting up these
independent

00:54:42.589 --> 00:54:42.599 align:start position:0%
independent
 
00:54:42.599 --> 00:54:45.430 align:start position:0%
independent
energy

00:54:45.430 --> 00:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
energy
 
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
generators well once again that would be
 
00:54:50.109 --> 00:54:50.119 align:start position:0%
covered by the contract between the
 
00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
two I know somebody um that I spoke with
 
00:54:56.390 --> 00:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
about this bill raised the situation of
 
00:54:57.990 --> 00:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
well what happens when
 
00:55:00.990 --> 00:55:01.000 align:start position:0%
the off-grid electric electricity
 
00:55:04.910 --> 00:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
provider has to shut down or maintenance
 
00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:08.240 align:start position:0%
or or maybe even they have an unexpected
 
00:55:11.109 --> 00:55:11.119 align:start position:0%
shutdown like a an an equipment
 
00:55:13.789 --> 00:55:13.799 align:start position:0%
malfunction or something what happens
 
00:55:17.670 --> 00:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
then well it's up to the contract
 
00:55:21.549 --> 00:55:21.559 align:start position:0%
between the generator and the buyer to
 
00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:24.160 align:start position:0%
specify in that contract what happens in
 
00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:25.309 align:start position:0%
specify in that contract what happens in
that

00:55:25.309 --> 00:55:25.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
situation it's not up to uh regulation
 
00:55:32.349 --> 00:55:32.359 align:start position:0%
to specify what happens there it's up to
 
00:55:35.390 --> 00:55:35.400 align:start position:0%
the relationship between the buyer and
 
00:55:37.349 --> 00:55:37.359 align:start position:0%
the seller but who oversees these
 
00:55:39.670 --> 00:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
contracts I mean I assume they're legal
 
00:55:42.710 --> 00:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
contracts and there is some oversight
 
00:55:44.230 --> 00:55:44.240 align:start position:0%
where is
 
00:55:46.549 --> 00:55:46.559 align:start position:0%
that well the only oversight that a
 
00:55:49.029 --> 00:55:49.039 align:start position:0%
legal contract would be subject to would
 
00:55:52.150 --> 00:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
be the oversight of the courts so if a
 
00:55:55.349 --> 00:55:55.359 align:start position:0%
legal contract is challenged by one
 
00:55:57.470 --> 00:55:57.480 align:start position:0%
party or the other
 
00:55:59.549 --> 00:55:59.559 align:start position:0%
it could end up in
 
00:56:02.109 --> 00:56:02.119 align:start position:0%
court but other than that there is no
 
00:56:06.750 --> 00:56:06.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:09.950 --> 00:56:09.960 align:start position:0%
contract representative Harrington yeah
 
00:56:12.910 --> 00:56:12.920 align:start position:0%
as far as the um uh part of what happens
 
00:56:15.750 --> 00:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
if the um generator goes down either
 
00:56:17.870 --> 00:56:17.880 align:start position:0%
because of a planned outage or a
 
00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
inadvertent outage due to equipment
 
00:56:21.430 --> 00:56:21.440 align:start position:0%
failures I mean this would be clearly
 
00:56:23.069 --> 00:56:23.079 align:start position:0%
spelled out in the contract it could be
 
00:56:25.190 --> 00:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
a situation where in order to get a
 
00:56:27.109 --> 00:56:27.119 align:start position:0%
better rate the person buying the
 
00:56:29.789 --> 00:56:29.799 align:start position:0%
electricity makes a deal and says okay
 
00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:32.720 align:start position:0%
if you if you go down with uh if your
 
00:56:35.910 --> 00:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
capacity Factor remains at 90% or better
 
00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
we'll pay this rate but if it drops
 
00:56:39.829 --> 00:56:39.839 align:start position:0%
below 80% we're going to pay a lower
 
00:56:41.710 --> 00:56:41.720 align:start position:0%
rate as an incentive to get them to do
 
00:56:44.069 --> 00:56:44.079 align:start position:0%
that now obviously since no one
 
00:56:45.710 --> 00:56:45.720 align:start position:0%
generator is going to run unless they
 
00:56:48.109 --> 00:56:48.119 align:start position:0%
had multiple sources that were
 
00:56:50.270 --> 00:56:50.280 align:start position:0%
independent it's not going to be 100% of
 
00:56:53.349 --> 00:56:53.359 align:start position:0%
the time so then the entity consuming
 
00:56:55.589 --> 00:56:55.599 align:start position:0%
the power would probably go onto the
 
00:56:57.789 --> 00:56:57.799 align:start position:0%
grid and in that case they would have to
 
00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
have a separate transmission system or
 
00:57:02.190 --> 00:57:02.200 align:start position:0%
distribution system bringing the power
 
00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
into them and they'd be subject on the
 
00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:06.640 align:start position:0%
purchase of that power to the
 
00:57:10.029 --> 00:57:10.039 align:start position:0%
regulations of the Pu and the uh utility
 
00:57:11.510 --> 00:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
and one of which would more than likely
 
00:57:14.670 --> 00:57:14.680 align:start position:0%
be a demand charge because if 90% of the
 
00:57:16.670 --> 00:57:16.680 align:start position:0%
time you're consuming no electricity and
 
00:57:18.470 --> 00:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
then 10% of the time you want to flip a
 
00:57:21.349 --> 00:57:21.359 align:start position:0%
switch and get I don't know 2 megawatts
 
00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
per hour the electric company's going to
 
00:57:25.470 --> 00:57:25.480 align:start position:0%
want you to pay for that privilege and
 
00:57:27.270 --> 00:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
rightly should because that's something
 
00:57:28.710 --> 00:57:28.720 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to plan on so
 
00:57:29.950 --> 00:57:29.960 align:start position:0%
those are two separate things that
 
00:57:32.510 --> 00:57:32.520 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be put together this this is a
 
00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
contract just like someone hires a
 
00:57:37.870 --> 00:57:37.880 align:start position:0%
contract for um building a house or or
 
00:57:40.710 --> 00:57:40.720 align:start position:0%
whatever the regulations that that apply
 
00:57:42.829 --> 00:57:42.839 align:start position:0%
would be environmental regulations as
 
00:57:44.230 --> 00:57:44.240 align:start position:0%
stated here that would apply to
 
00:57:46.470 --> 00:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
everybody but there's nothing specific
 
00:57:49.589 --> 00:57:49.599 align:start position:0%
to the contract between the generator
 
00:57:53.109 --> 00:57:53.119 align:start position:0%
and the consumer as to who's how they're
 
00:57:54.430 --> 00:57:54.440 align:start position:0%
going to buy the electricity what
 
00:57:55.950 --> 00:57:55.960 align:start position:0%
they're going to pay for it that that's
 
00:57:57.910 --> 00:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
just like every other contract it's
 
00:57:59.390 --> 00:57:59.400 align:start position:0%
decided between the two individuals
 
00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:01.670 align:start position:0%
decided between the two individuals
signing

00:58:01.670 --> 00:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
signing
 
00:58:04.710 --> 00:58:04.720 align:start position:0%
it representative Wendy Thomas thank you
 
00:58:07.390 --> 00:58:07.400 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um as the prime sponsor of this
 
00:58:09.470 --> 00:58:09.480 align:start position:0%
bill um do you envision we've had a lot
 
00:58:11.510 --> 00:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
of bills about nuclear power do you
 
00:58:13.789 --> 00:58:13.799 align:start position:0%
envision nuclear power uh falling under
 
00:58:13.799 --> 00:58:14.990 align:start position:0%
envision nuclear power uh falling under
this

00:58:14.990 --> 00:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:58:19.789 --> 00:58:19.799 align:start position:0%
agreement well it certainly could um the
 
00:58:22.390 --> 00:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
idea of this bill came from as I
 
00:58:25.150 --> 00:58:25.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned in my testimony on the bill
 
00:58:28.029 --> 00:58:28.039 align:start position:0%
from Texas and in Texas there is a
 
00:58:34.190 --> 00:58:34.200 align:start position:0%
movement to create some big AI data
 
00:58:38.230 --> 00:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
centers and at least one or two of those
 
00:58:41.950 --> 00:58:41.960 align:start position:0%
locations are envisioned to uh be
 
00:58:44.029 --> 00:58:44.039 align:start position:0%
powered by a nuclear power plant I think
 
00:58:48.029 --> 00:58:48.039 align:start position:0%
a company called Kos has contracted with
 
00:58:52.710 --> 00:58:52.720 align:start position:0%
Amazon to build 235 megawatt nuclear
 
00:58:57.510 --> 00:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
small Mo molten salt reactor uh nuclear
 
00:59:00.549 --> 00:59:00.559 align:start position:0%
power plants to power some AI D data
 
00:59:03.230 --> 00:59:03.240 align:start position:0%
centers down in Texas could that happen
 
00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:04.750 align:start position:0%
centers down in Texas could that happen
here

00:59:04.750 --> 00:59:04.760 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:59:07.349 --> 00:59:07.359 align:start position:0%
maybe and maybe it would be an economic
 
00:59:11.670 --> 00:59:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:14.230 --> 00:59:14.240 align:start position:0%
did representative Harrington yeah just
 
00:59:16.150 --> 00:59:16.160 align:start position:0%
just to be sure so there's no confusion
 
00:59:18.510 --> 00:59:18.520 align:start position:0%
here this bill have nothing to do with
 
00:59:20.430 --> 00:59:20.440 align:start position:0%
the regulation of any nuclear power
 
00:59:22.589 --> 00:59:22.599 align:start position:0%
plant that would remain regulated by the
 
00:59:25.390 --> 00:59:25.400 align:start position:0%
NRC it's not unregulated they would
 
00:59:27.549 --> 00:59:27.559 align:start position:0%
still have to be subject to let's say
 
00:59:29.910 --> 00:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
Dees in New Hampshire and the EPA if
 
00:59:31.829 --> 00:59:31.839 align:start position:0%
they had a water discharge permit or an
 
00:59:34.069 --> 00:59:34.079 align:start position:0%
air discharge permit uh if they were
 
00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
digging holes in the ground they'd be
 
00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
subject to Dees regulations on that
 
00:59:39.470 --> 00:59:39.480 align:start position:0%
they're not exempt from any of this
 
00:59:41.309 --> 00:59:41.319 align:start position:0%
they're just exempt from the regulations
 
00:59:44.950 --> 00:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
that apply only to a public utility
 
00:59:48.190 --> 00:59:48.200 align:start position:0%
that's in a generator that's over using
 
00:59:50.270 --> 00:59:50.280 align:start position:0%
transmission lines there's no they not
 
00:59:52.630 --> 00:59:52.640 align:start position:0%
going to be deregulated the NRC will
 
00:59:54.549 --> 00:59:54.559 align:start position:0%
definitely be there Dees will definitely
 
00:59:56.829 --> 00:59:56.839 align:start position:0%
be there and all the acquired permits
 
00:59:59.029 --> 00:59:59.039 align:start position:0%
will have to be had and
 
01:00:01.549 --> 01:00:01.559 align:start position:0%
maintained that is correct this bill
 
01:00:04.470 --> 01:00:04.480 align:start position:0%
only exempts these uh off-grid
 
01:00:06.829 --> 01:00:06.839 align:start position:0%
electricity providers from State
 
01:00:09.589 --> 01:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
regulation not Federal Regulation and
 
01:00:11.829 --> 01:00:11.839 align:start position:0%
not all state regulation though it's
 
01:00:13.950 --> 01:00:13.960 align:start position:0%
just the regulation pertaining to a
 
01:00:15.270 --> 01:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
generator and the utility and
 
01:00:16.710 --> 01:00:16.720 align:start position:0%
transmission because they're still going
 
01:00:18.190 --> 01:00:18.200 align:start position:0%
to be under the guise of like for
 
01:00:20.230 --> 01:00:20.240 align:start position:0%
example Dees they're going to need water
 
01:00:23.109 --> 01:00:23.119 align:start position:0%
permits air discharge permits from EPA
 
01:00:25.470 --> 01:00:25.480 align:start position:0%
uh ground disturbance permits from Dees
 
01:00:28.470 --> 01:00:28.480 align:start position:0%
as well digging holes as is specified in
 
01:00:32.309 --> 01:00:32.319 align:start position:0%
the bill on line 16 representative
 
01:00:34.309 --> 01:00:34.319 align:start position:0%
Corman thank
 
01:00:37.990 --> 01:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
you I counted how many chapters are in
 
01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
title uh 34 and there are 38 chapters
 
01:00:44.710 --> 01:00:44.720 align:start position:0%
and it just seems like that's exempting
 
01:00:48.390 --> 01:00:48.400 align:start position:0%
from a lot of law um I'm I'm I'm a bit
 
01:00:51.109 --> 01:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable with that I'm also just
 
01:00:54.390 --> 01:00:54.400 align:start position:0%
concerned about safety in
 
01:00:58.750 --> 01:00:58.760 align:start position:0%
general uh when when Mr Lata testified
 
01:01:02.510 --> 01:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
he talked about the concern about uh
 
01:01:04.470 --> 01:01:04.480 align:start position:0%
wires Crossing
 
01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
roadways and and I asked about that and
 
01:01:09.029 --> 01:01:09.039 align:start position:0%
he said well you know what you do on
 
01:01:10.950 --> 01:01:10.960 align:start position:0%
private property is your concern so if
 
01:01:12.510 --> 01:01:12.520 align:start position:0%
it doesn't cross a roadway they're not
 
01:01:14.670 --> 01:01:14.680 align:start position:0%
concerned but you know my concern is you
 
01:01:17.910 --> 01:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
know maybe a fire is generated at one of
 
01:01:20.549 --> 01:01:20.559 align:start position:0%
these facilities and fires have a way of
 
01:01:23.309 --> 01:01:23.319 align:start position:0%
not caring about property lines and
 
01:01:25.990 --> 01:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
Roads uh so I'm I'm just generally
 
01:01:27.829 --> 01:01:27.839 align:start position:0%
concerned about safety here somebody
 
01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
just operating a power plant unregulated
 
01:01:33.750 --> 01:01:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:35.829 --> 01:01:35.839 align:start position:0%
happens further
 
01:01:38.430 --> 01:01:38.440 align:start position:0%
comment representative McGee yeah my
 
01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
comment was similar in that I I've just
 
01:01:44.430 --> 01:01:44.440 align:start position:0%
my my mind is you know that this bill is
 
01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:46.160 align:start position:0%
the what could go wrong bill because
 
01:01:47.430 --> 01:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
we're not
 
01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:49.029 align:start position:0%
we're not
envisioning

01:01:49.029 --> 01:01:49.039 align:start position:0%
envisioning
 
01:01:51.829 --> 01:01:51.839 align:start position:0%
um we're not we're not
 
01:01:56.549 --> 01:01:56.559 align:start position:0%
specifying how these extra regulatory
 
01:01:58.029 --> 01:01:58.039 align:start position:0%
uh generation
 
01:02:01.870 --> 01:02:01.880 align:start position:0%
facilities would need to have um
 
01:02:05.829 --> 01:02:05.839 align:start position:0%
some boundaries around them for for
 
01:02:09.309 --> 01:02:09.319 align:start position:0%
Public Safety so the details of what
 
01:02:11.390 --> 01:02:11.400 align:start position:0%
goes into the contract between the
 
01:02:14.029 --> 01:02:14.039 align:start position:0%
generator and the person who's you know
 
01:02:16.309 --> 01:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
hiring them to provide their uh energy
 
01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
for most of the time um that part I'm
 
01:02:22.349 --> 01:02:22.359 align:start position:0%
not as concerned about except that I
 
01:02:24.510 --> 01:02:24.520 align:start position:0%
don't think that everyone that's
 
01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
entering into that contract might know
 
01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
all the things that they would need to
 
01:02:30.789 --> 01:02:30.799 align:start position:0%
put in because we kind of assume that
 
01:02:32.430 --> 01:02:32.440 align:start position:0%
when someone's providing electricity to
 
01:02:35.150 --> 01:02:35.160 align:start position:0%
us that there are regulatory imperatives
 
01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
about safety and phasing the electricity
 
01:02:40.670 --> 01:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
onto the system and you know that the
 
01:02:42.230 --> 01:02:42.240 align:start position:0%
wires are appropriate that that
 
01:02:43.990 --> 01:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
everything is being done in a way that
 
01:02:46.470 --> 01:02:46.480 align:start position:0%
is standardized and is safe to your
 
01:02:49.710 --> 01:02:49.720 align:start position:0%
point and none of that applies here
 
01:02:51.990 --> 01:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
right so somebody can put together
 
01:02:54.430 --> 01:02:54.440 align:start position:0%
whatever they're they think is probably
 
01:02:56.789 --> 01:02:56.799 align:start position:0%
the easiest way for them to get
 
01:02:58.829 --> 01:02:58.839 align:start position:0%
uh to the
 
01:03:01.630 --> 01:03:01.640 align:start position:0%
contract and not necessarily take some
 
01:03:03.910 --> 01:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
of the safety aspects into consideration
 
01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
that regulations require of other people
 
01:03:08.029 --> 01:03:08.039 align:start position:0%
that are providing electricity that
 
01:03:11.109 --> 01:03:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:13.470 --> 01:03:13.480 align:start position:0%
concern so I can imagine that if I'm
 
01:03:16.589 --> 01:03:16.599 align:start position:0%
going to buy electricity
 
01:03:18.870 --> 01:03:18.880 align:start position:0%
from one of these
 
01:03:21.069 --> 01:03:21.079 align:start position:0%
generators that in the contract I'm
 
01:03:24.349 --> 01:03:24.359 align:start position:0%
going to make sure that I cover my own
 
01:03:26.269 --> 01:03:26.279 align:start position:0%
business's safety
 
01:03:29.150 --> 01:03:29.160 align:start position:0%
issues in the contract I'm not going to
 
01:03:31.829 --> 01:03:31.839 align:start position:0%
just ignore safety for my my business
 
01:03:35.950 --> 01:03:35.960 align:start position:0%
that would be economic suicide so the
 
01:03:38.910 --> 01:03:38.920 align:start position:0%
contract is likely to be the document
 
01:03:41.589 --> 01:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
that deals with a lot of these issues
 
01:03:44.589 --> 01:03:44.599 align:start position:0%
that all of you have legitimately raised
 
01:03:51.870 --> 01:03:51.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:54.589 --> 01:03:54.599 align:start position:0%
nevertheless the key to this legislation
 
01:03:57.990 --> 01:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
is that it is enabling legislation it
 
01:04:00.549 --> 01:04:00.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't attempt to solve all the
 
01:04:03.150 --> 01:04:03.160 align:start position:0%
problems that might occur from the
 
01:04:06.630 --> 01:04:06.640 align:start position:0%
development of these facilities
 
01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:08.470 align:start position:0%
development of these facilities
and

01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:08.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:04:12.190 --> 01:04:12.200 align:start position:0%
uh it leaves this the solving of those
 
01:04:14.670 --> 01:04:14.680 align:start position:0%
problems to
 
01:04:17.789 --> 01:04:17.799 align:start position:0%
innovators to come up with unique
 
01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
solutions that probably that maybe none
 
01:04:23.390 --> 01:04:23.400 align:start position:0%
of us have even thought about or
 
01:04:25.390 --> 01:04:25.400 align:start position:0%
envisioned so that's what the purpose
 
01:04:28.549 --> 01:04:28.559 align:start position:0%
here is is representative
 
01:04:31.069 --> 01:04:31.079 align:start position:0%
Summers thank you Mr chairman I happen
 
01:04:34.150 --> 01:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
to be looking at RSA title 34 and uh
 
01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
what I noticed is is although there's a
 
01:04:38.349 --> 01:04:38.359 align:start position:0%
lot of chapters here predominantly it's
 
01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
about how the state collects money and
 
01:04:44.029 --> 01:04:44.039 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if this is being viewed
 
01:04:47.789 --> 01:04:47.799 align:start position:0%
or argued because by eliminating title
 
01:04:51.069 --> 01:04:51.079 align:start position:0%
34 that they're just some folks believe
 
01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
that the state's losing the a uh um
 
01:04:57.470 --> 01:04:57.480 align:start position:0%
Revenue Foundation from it so it it
 
01:05:00.710 --> 01:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
authorizes non- Capal Reserve funds it
 
01:05:03.269 --> 01:05:03.279 align:start position:0%
requires payments into the fund it
 
01:05:05.430 --> 01:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
requires investment policies for trust
 
01:05:07.870 --> 01:05:07.880 align:start position:0%
funds it defines the trustees of the
 
01:05:11.670 --> 01:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
funds it requires payments from Surplus
 
01:05:13.109 --> 01:05:13.119 align:start position:0%
so what I'm thinking is I don't know if
 
01:05:16.190 --> 01:05:16.200 align:start position:0%
the argument for eliminating title 34 is
 
01:05:18.950 --> 01:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
whether it's a safety or safety
 
01:05:21.150 --> 01:05:21.160 align:start position:0%
regulation or is it more about the
 
01:05:23.190 --> 01:05:23.200 align:start position:0%
collections of money from folks so they
 
01:05:28.990 --> 01:05:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:32.190 --> 01:05:32.200 align:start position:0%
okay further comment representative
 
01:05:36.789 --> 01:05:36.799 align:start position:0%
blog thank you chair just so I
 
01:05:38.029 --> 01:05:38.039 align:start position:0%
understand this
 
01:05:42.309 --> 01:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
better we got two facilities one's
 
01:05:42.319 --> 01:05:44.309 align:start position:0%
better we got two facilities one's
generating

01:05:44.309 --> 01:05:44.319 align:start position:0%
generating
 
01:05:47.870 --> 01:05:47.880 align:start position:0%
power going to be built on a piece of
 
01:05:51.470 --> 01:05:51.480 align:start position:0%
property and probably nearby another
 
01:05:56.230 --> 01:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
facility is going to use that power to
 
01:05:57.789 --> 01:05:57.799 align:start position:0%
uh make
 
01:06:01.470 --> 01:06:01.480 align:start position:0%
something we got two empty lots of land
 
01:06:05.430 --> 01:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
to put the generator and the user has to
 
01:06:07.870 --> 01:06:07.880 align:start position:0%
go through all the requirements of the
 
01:06:10.950 --> 01:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
state safety as you said environmental
 
01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:11.630 align:start position:0%
state safety as you said environmental
and

01:06:11.630 --> 01:06:11.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:14.480 align:start position:0%
everything now it's built and all so
 
01:06:17.230 --> 01:06:17.240 align:start position:0%
this bill I'm getting to the question
 
01:06:19.670 --> 01:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
only in my
 
01:06:23.990 --> 01:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:26.750 --> 01:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
regulates allows
 
01:06:30.230 --> 01:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
one the generator to
 
01:06:33.109 --> 01:06:33.119 align:start position:0%
transmit that energy to the next
 
01:06:36.349 --> 01:06:36.359 align:start position:0%
property by contract of how when and
 
01:06:36.359 --> 01:06:37.309 align:start position:0%
property by contract of how when and
what

01:06:37.309 --> 01:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:06:40.150 --> 01:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
have a the safety should be taken care
 
01:06:46.390 --> 01:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:48.910 --> 01:06:48.920 align:start position:0%
analogy to to my mind you didn't miss
 
01:06:51.349 --> 01:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
anything that's exactly what this does
 
01:06:54.029 --> 01:06:54.039 align:start position:0%
yeah all right let's move on because we
 
01:06:56.950 --> 01:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
have one more Bill to discuss
 
01:06:59.269 --> 01:06:59.279 align:start position:0%
uh representative Harrington I'll be
 
01:07:00.349 --> 01:07:00.359 align:start position:0%
quick just the other thing we really
 
01:07:01.710 --> 01:07:01.720 align:start position:0%
haven't mentioned either is you're still
 
01:07:03.750 --> 01:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
dealing with local building codes and
 
01:07:05.269 --> 01:07:05.279 align:start position:0%
building inspectors if you're putting up
 
01:07:07.630 --> 01:07:07.640 align:start position:0%
a building to put a generator in it's
 
01:07:09.589 --> 01:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
going to have it get a building permit
 
01:07:10.870 --> 01:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
and they going to be inspections
 
01:07:12.910 --> 01:07:12.920 align:start position:0%
involved in that and if the transmission
 
01:07:14.549 --> 01:07:14.559 align:start position:0%
line or whatever you want to call it
 
01:07:17.029 --> 01:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
distribution line goes across a third
 
01:07:19.109 --> 01:07:19.119 align:start position:0%
party's property then they're going to
 
01:07:21.069 --> 01:07:21.079 align:start position:0%
say you want to build that line across
 
01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:22.799 align:start position:0%
my property you're going to have to get
 
01:07:24.470 --> 01:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
a building permit make sure it meets all
 
01:07:25.910 --> 01:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
the all the requirements for running
 
01:07:28.190 --> 01:07:28.200 align:start position:0%
electrical lines across my property and
 
01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
you're going to pay me for the privilege
 
01:07:31.470 --> 01:07:31.480 align:start position:0%
by the way and the same thing when it
 
01:07:32.910 --> 01:07:32.920 align:start position:0%
gets to the person who's getting the
 
01:07:35.190 --> 01:07:35.200 align:start position:0%
electricity in hooking that up again is
 
01:07:37.789 --> 01:07:37.799 align:start position:0%
going to be required under the U you get
 
01:07:38.829 --> 01:07:38.839 align:start position:0%
a building code it's going to be
 
01:07:41.630 --> 01:07:41.640 align:start position:0%
inspected by the local uh people as well
 
01:07:44.069 --> 01:07:44.079 align:start position:0%
so it's not it doesn't exempt them from
 
01:07:46.029 --> 01:07:46.039 align:start position:0%
all sorts of rules it just says it
 
01:07:50.230 --> 01:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:54.670 --> 01:07:54.680 align:start position:0%
utility that is correct okay so there's
 
01:07:56.870 --> 01:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
another amendment that we want to
 
01:07:59.589 --> 01:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
consider and that's for House Bill 710 I
 
01:08:01.710 --> 01:08:01.720 align:start position:0%
just handed that out does everybody have
 
01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:03.670 align:start position:0%
just handed that out does everybody have
a

01:08:03.670 --> 01:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:08:08.670 --> 01:08:08.680 align:start position:0%
copy all right so you'll recall that in
 
01:08:11.589 --> 01:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
the original Bill House Bill
 
01:08:16.470 --> 01:08:16.480 align:start position:0%
710 after um defining what an advanced
 
01:08:21.630 --> 01:08:21.640 align:start position:0%
nuclear resource is that bill set
 
01:08:29.309 --> 01:08:29.319 align:start position:0%
up a a series of changes to RSA 374
 
01:08:33.309 --> 01:08:33.319 align:start position:0%
DG to allow utilities to invest in or
 
01:08:37.110 --> 01:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
even own an advanced nuclear resource
 
01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
similar to the way that a utility today
 
01:08:44.990 --> 01:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
can invest in or own a re distributed
 
01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.669 align:start position:0%
can invest in or own a re distributed
generation

01:08:47.669 --> 01:08:47.679 align:start position:0%
generation
 
01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
resource and many of you had issues with
 
01:08:53.070 --> 01:08:53.080 align:start position:0%
the idea that a utility could invest in
 
01:08:56.510 --> 01:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
or own a nuclear power plant PL because
 
01:08:57.990 --> 01:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
they're pretty
 
01:09:01.229 --> 01:09:01.239 align:start position:0%
expensive so this amendment completely
 
01:09:06.829 --> 01:09:06.839 align:start position:0%
removes that uh provision from the
 
01:09:12.789 --> 01:09:12.799 align:start position:0%
bill that is no longer part of HB
 
01:09:12.799 --> 01:09:14.910 align:start position:0%
bill that is no longer part of HB
710

01:09:14.910 --> 01:09:14.920 align:start position:0%
710
 
01:09:17.789 --> 01:09:17.799 align:start position:0%
instead what the bill does is it makes
 
01:09:22.110 --> 01:09:22.120 align:start position:0%
it possible for utilities to sign
 
01:09:24.910 --> 01:09:24.920 align:start position:0%
purchase power agreements with Advanced
 
01:09:27.870 --> 01:09:27.880 align:start position:0%
nuclear resources and it uses the
 
01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
language of RSA 374 colon
 
01:09:36.229 --> 01:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
11 which was added to law two years ago
 
01:09:39.149 --> 01:09:39.159 align:start position:0%
by Senate Bill 54 those of you who were
 
01:09:42.030 --> 01:09:42.040 align:start position:0%
here at the time will remember that
 
01:09:45.910 --> 01:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 54 was designed to allow
 
01:09:48.749 --> 01:09:48.759 align:start position:0%
utilities to purchase up to 20% of their
 
01:09:53.470 --> 01:09:53.480 align:start position:0%
load in a PPA from a
 
01:09:56.630 --> 01:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
new utility
 
01:10:00.229 --> 01:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
resource and it was technology neutral
 
01:10:02.229 --> 01:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
it didn't care what kind of resource it
 
01:10:07.350 --> 01:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
was it just had to be a newly developed
 
01:10:09.790 --> 01:10:09.800 align:start position:0%
resource so what I've done here is I've
 
01:10:14.669 --> 01:10:14.679 align:start position:0%
I've modified that language to allow
 
01:10:18.030 --> 01:10:18.040 align:start position:0%
for nuclear resources to
 
01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:20.070 align:start position:0%
for nuclear resources to
be

01:10:20.070 --> 01:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:10:23.750 --> 01:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh for utilities to enter into ppas with
 
01:10:27.910 --> 01:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
nuclear resources the way Senate Bill 54
 
01:10:29.590 --> 01:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
was originally
 
01:10:32.830 --> 01:10:32.840 align:start position:0%
written basically there was a a drop
 
01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
dead date of
 
01:10:40.149 --> 01:10:40.159 align:start position:0%
2026 for proposals for these new ppas to
 
01:10:44.350 --> 01:10:44.360 align:start position:0%
be uh signed so what I've done here is
 
01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:45.790 align:start position:0%
be uh signed so what I've done here is
I've

01:10:45.790 --> 01:10:45.800 align:start position:0%
I've
 
01:10:48.669 --> 01:10:48.679 align:start position:0%
for advanced nuclear resources I've made
 
01:10:52.910 --> 01:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
an ex an exception that allows them to
 
01:10:56.390 --> 01:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
be developed proposals to be developed
 
01:10:59.110 --> 01:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
for these ppas up until
 
01:11:03.390 --> 01:11:03.400 align:start position:0%
2035 so it extends by 10 years basically
 
01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
the provisions of Senate Bill 54 with
 
01:11:11.390 --> 01:11:11.400 align:start position:0%
regard to Advanced nuclear
 
01:11:13.750 --> 01:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
resources so that's the major change
 
01:11:16.669 --> 01:11:16.679 align:start position:0%
here the other minor change is on lines
 
01:11:19.790 --> 01:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
5 through nine I expanded the definition
 
01:11:23.790 --> 01:11:23.800 align:start position:0%
of advanced nuclear resource just to
 
01:11:26.990 --> 01:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
include many of
 
01:11:30.669 --> 01:11:30.679 align:start position:0%
the the technologies that are used to
 
01:11:34.430 --> 01:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
create these reactors and I also changed
 
01:11:37.830 --> 01:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
the the original Bill stated that they
 
01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
had a generation capacity of between 1
 
01:11:43.790 --> 01:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
and 90 megawatts I've now changed that
 
01:11:47.550 --> 01:11:47.560 align:start position:0%
to Z and 300 megawatts which is more in
 
01:11:50.990 --> 01:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
line with the industry definition for
 
01:11:53.830 --> 01:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
advanced nuclear resources so those are
 
01:11:55.750 --> 01:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
the changes that I've made to
 
01:11:57.669 --> 01:11:57.679 align:start position:0%
House Bill 17 I think this is a much
 
01:12:01.189 --> 01:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
cleaner way to go about allowing
 
01:12:03.709 --> 01:12:03.719 align:start position:0%
utilities if they're interested to
 
01:12:07.910 --> 01:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
acquire some um some of their load from
 
01:12:10.510 --> 01:12:10.520 align:start position:0%
nuclear resources and I'd be interested
 
01:12:13.870 --> 01:12:13.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:17.229 --> 01:12:17.239 align:start position:0%
reactions representative McGee thank you
 
01:12:19.510 --> 01:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
I thought I saw other people first all
 
01:12:23.870 --> 01:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
thank you um my question is about the
 
01:12:27.189 --> 01:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
language that starts on line 12 on page
 
01:12:29.430 --> 01:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
one it says investor own electric
 
01:12:31.149 --> 01:12:31.159 align:start position:0%
distribution utilities may elect to
 
01:12:34.750 --> 01:12:34.760 align:start position:0%
develop and no later than June 30th of
 
01:12:37.669 --> 01:12:37.679 align:start position:0%
2025 issue a requests for proposals for
 
01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:40.199 align:start position:0%
multi-year agreements for energy in
 
01:12:43.990 --> 01:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
conjunction with or independent of any
 
01:12:46.030 --> 01:12:46.040 align:start position:0%
attendant environmental attributes from
 
01:12:47.830 --> 01:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
electric energy sources and then the
 
01:12:51.189 --> 01:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
bolded language is what includes uh
 
01:12:52.830 --> 01:12:52.840 align:start position:0%
nuclear resour Advanced nuclear
 
01:12:55.550 --> 01:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
resources up to you know 10 years hence
 
01:12:58.790 --> 01:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
so June 30th of 2035 but I don't
 
01:13:01.070 --> 01:13:01.080 align:start position:0%
understand why the first
 
01:13:04.510 --> 01:13:04.520 align:start position:0%
line uh limits any
 
01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:06.430 align:start position:0%
line uh limits any
other

01:13:06.430 --> 01:13:06.440 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh any other investor
 
01:13:13.790 --> 01:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
owned uh Investments or PPA
 
01:13:16.189 --> 01:13:16.199 align:start position:0%
agreements that have to be done before
 
01:13:18.310 --> 01:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
June of this year so
 
01:13:21.629 --> 01:13:21.639 align:start position:0%
I you'll have to go back and look at the
 
01:13:25.390 --> 01:13:25.400 align:start position:0%
um the debate over Senate Bill 54 that's
 
01:13:27.510 --> 01:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
language directly that was added to
 
01:13:29.229 --> 01:13:29.239 align:start position:0%
statute directly as a result of Senate
 
01:13:30.870 --> 01:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
Bill 54 well I guess I would just
 
01:13:32.149 --> 01:13:32.159 align:start position:0%
acknowledge it here in this working
 
01:13:34.110 --> 01:13:34.120 align:start position:0%
meeting as maybe not great language
 
01:13:36.750 --> 01:13:36.760 align:start position:0%
because it is saying that that anything
 
01:13:39.430 --> 01:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
that isn't nuclear they can't enter into
 
01:13:41.629 --> 01:13:41.639 align:start position:0%
it right it's it's it sounds like a
 
01:13:44.669 --> 01:13:44.679 align:start position:0%
Prohibition after that date is that
 
01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
right I'm just was a Prohibition before
 
01:13:49.310 --> 01:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
I wrote this amendment and it's still a
 
01:13:51.709 --> 01:13:51.719 align:start position:0%
Prohibition I didn't change it right and
 
01:13:54.350 --> 01:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
I and I think I don't know if we have
 
01:13:56.149 --> 01:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
ever asked the utilities about that but
 
01:13:59.310 --> 01:13:59.320 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if if we're writing uh an
 
01:14:04.669 --> 01:14:04.679 align:start position:0%
amendment now that um extends a window
 
01:14:06.110 --> 01:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
because obviously there would be quite a
 
01:14:07.629 --> 01:14:07.639 align:start position:0%
bit of time needed in order to get
 
01:14:11.070 --> 01:14:11.080 align:start position:0%
Advanced nuclear up and running um for a
 
01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
PPA on one form of energy why would we
 
01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
in the same paragraph be limiting their
 
01:14:21.229 --> 01:14:21.239 align:start position:0%
ability to entertain ppas long-term ppas
 
01:14:22.830 --> 01:14:22.840 align:start position:0%
on any other type of
 
01:14:26.149 --> 01:14:26.159 align:start position:0%
energy I mean I think we should consider
 
01:14:28.070 --> 01:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
changing that language or eliminating
 
01:14:29.990 --> 01:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
that language because it does seem
 
01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.910 align:start position:0%
that language because it does seem
unusually

01:14:32.910 --> 01:14:32.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:34.910 --> 01:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
restrictive I'll be honest with you I
 
01:14:37.790 --> 01:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
don't remember during the debate over
 
01:14:41.950 --> 01:14:41.960 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 54 why we why we restricted
 
01:14:44.270 --> 01:14:44.280 align:start position:0%
it maybe commissioner Elms from the
 
01:14:50.110 --> 01:14:50.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:52.790 --> 01:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
remember no pressure
 
01:14:55.310 --> 01:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
though War the record uh Deputy
 
01:14:56.270 --> 01:14:56.280 align:start position:0%
Commissioner Chris Elms from the
 
01:14:57.510 --> 01:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
Department of energy and I'm going to
 
01:14:59.350 --> 01:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
admit I was sending a text while we were
 
01:15:00.590 --> 01:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
discussing there so I have no idea what
 
01:15:02.709 --> 01:15:02.719 align:start position:0%
we're talking about but I'm happy to
 
01:15:02.719 --> 01:15:03.750 align:start position:0%
we're talking about but I'm happy to
answer

01:15:03.750 --> 01:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
answer
 
01:15:06.350 --> 01:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
questions so Senate Bill 54 language was
 
01:15:08.830 --> 01:15:08.840 align:start position:0%
what I gleaned but um yeah so Senate
 
01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:09.750 align:start position:0%
what I gleaned but um yeah so Senate
Bill

01:15:09.750 --> 01:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
01:15:12.590 --> 01:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
54 said that investor-owned electric
 
01:15:16.149 --> 01:15:16.159 align:start position:0%
distribution utilities can develop and
 
01:15:19.990 --> 01:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
no later than June 30th of 2025 issue a
 
01:15:24.430 --> 01:15:24.440 align:start position:0%
request for proposals why June 30th 2025
 
01:15:27.510 --> 01:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
sure so uh Senate Bill 54 was a pretty
 
01:15:31.510 --> 01:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
major change in uh in the state's view
 
01:15:34.149 --> 01:15:34.159 align:start position:0%
on energy procurement and specifically
 
01:15:37.470 --> 01:15:37.480 align:start position:0%
authorized these uh the potential for
 
01:15:40.149 --> 01:15:40.159 align:start position:0%
power purchase agreements um if we
 
01:15:42.669 --> 01:15:42.679 align:start position:0%
remember back to to the time which I I
 
01:15:45.950 --> 01:15:45.960 align:start position:0%
think was two years ago uh you know we
 
01:15:48.830 --> 01:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
we had experienced the the price shock
 
01:15:50.030 --> 01:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
that was due in large part to the
 
01:15:52.110 --> 01:15:52.120 align:start position:0%
invasion in Ukraine and I think there
 
01:15:54.229 --> 01:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
was a desire from from the legislature
 
01:15:55.990 --> 01:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
from the Governor from from stakeholders
 
01:16:00.590 --> 01:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
to to do something to perhaps uh work on
 
01:16:02.870 --> 01:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh looking at some you know essentially
 
01:16:04.750 --> 01:16:04.760 align:start position:0%
Financial Hedges to what we were seeing
 
01:16:06.390 --> 01:16:06.400 align:start position:0%
there and so the idea of a power
 
01:16:09.950 --> 01:16:09.960 align:start position:0%
purchase agreement uh you know became
 
01:16:11.709 --> 01:16:11.719 align:start position:0%
attractive to folks it was something
 
01:16:14.229 --> 01:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
that the department at the time had uh
 
01:16:16.950 --> 01:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
significant concerns uh related to
 
01:16:19.709 --> 01:16:19.719 align:start position:0%
rapair impact so as we were talking
 
01:16:21.629 --> 01:16:21.639 align:start position:0%
about what that bill would look like and
 
01:16:23.669 --> 01:16:23.679 align:start position:0%
and uh you know the bill did recognize
 
01:16:25.590 --> 01:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire new England has a
 
01:16:29.350 --> 01:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
building things problem to an extent uh
 
01:16:31.870 --> 01:16:31.880 align:start position:0%
but but because this was sort of a novel
 
01:16:33.390 --> 01:16:33.400 align:start position:0%
idea that we were looking at the idea
 
01:16:35.629 --> 01:16:35.639 align:start position:0%
was that this is uh in response to a
 
01:16:37.950 --> 01:16:37.960 align:start position:0%
problem that's happening now we want to
 
01:16:39.629 --> 01:16:39.639 align:start position:0%
keep this limited we don't want this to
 
01:16:41.590 --> 01:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
be an authority that we're just throwing
 
01:16:44.709 --> 01:16:44.719 align:start position:0%
the door open to that we wanted to uh
 
01:16:47.390 --> 01:16:47.400 align:start position:0%
keep it limited see what came out of it
 
01:16:49.270 --> 01:16:49.280 align:start position:0%
uh as you might I don't know if it's
 
01:16:50.470 --> 01:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
reflected in the amendment I'm sorry I
 
01:16:52.310 --> 01:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
haven't seen it there's also some other
 
01:16:53.590 --> 01:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
restrictions such as a 2 million
 
01:16:56.550 --> 01:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
megawatt hour cap on what was allowed
 
01:16:58.790 --> 01:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
which represents about I think it's 17
 
01:17:02.790 --> 01:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
18% of New Hampshire's load and
 
01:17:05.350 --> 01:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
uh you know the idea was let's see what
 
01:17:07.629 --> 01:17:07.639 align:start position:0%
comes of this uh what we haven't seen
 
01:17:10.870 --> 01:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
anything come of it uh thus far so sorry
 
01:17:13.110 --> 01:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
that was if that was off the cuff uh
 
01:17:15.270 --> 01:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
hopefully it was helpful so does that
 
01:17:18.510 --> 01:17:18.520 align:start position:0%
representative McGee does that help you
 
01:17:21.629 --> 01:17:21.639 align:start position:0%
um understand why there's a restriction
 
01:17:24.149 --> 01:17:24.159 align:start position:0%
here um yeah I understand the history on
 
01:17:26.910 --> 01:17:26.920 align:start position:0%
it I'm just wondering whether it seems
 
01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
because because it basically says no
 
01:17:32.750 --> 01:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
later than does that mean that we we
 
01:17:36.390 --> 01:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
intended to take away the ability for
 
01:17:38.510 --> 01:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
them to enter into those power purchase
 
01:17:39.950 --> 01:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
agreements if they make sense I mean
 
01:17:40.950 --> 01:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't they still have to go in front
 
01:17:42.830 --> 01:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
of the Pu and everything and and
 
01:17:43.870 --> 01:17:43.880 align:start position:0%
obviously it's the legislative
 
01:17:45.270 --> 01:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
prerogative but I if I remember
 
01:17:47.910 --> 01:17:47.920 align:start position:0%
correctly there was a a uh up until
 
01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
whatever the date is June 30th 2025 uh
 
01:17:53.590 --> 01:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
the utilities could put out the RFP and
 
01:17:55.590 --> 01:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
then they had uh year to bring that
 
01:17:56.950 --> 01:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
forward to the commission so I think
 
01:17:59.390 --> 01:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
there was another date of whatever
 
01:18:03.510 --> 01:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
2026 um I I I'm not commenting on on
 
01:18:04.950 --> 01:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
that other than to say at the time it
 
01:18:07.950 --> 01:18:07.960 align:start position:0%
was intended to be a limited
 
01:18:09.870 --> 01:18:09.880 align:start position:0%
Authority thank you commissioner
 
01:18:12.910 --> 01:18:12.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate those that clarification for
 
01:18:15.350 --> 01:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
us I'd also like to point out that this
 
01:18:20.189 --> 01:18:20.199 align:start position:0%
amendment does not change the uh 2
 
01:18:23.950 --> 01:18:23.960 align:start position:0%
million megawatt hour or 20% load
 
01:18:26.910 --> 01:18:26.920 align:start position:0%
restriction that it's already in statute
 
01:18:29.950 --> 01:18:29.960 align:start position:0%
as a result of centerel 54 so those
 
01:18:33.470 --> 01:18:33.480 align:start position:0%
limits would still apply even to the
 
01:18:36.709 --> 01:18:36.719 align:start position:0%
advanced nuclear resources that are
 
01:18:38.550 --> 01:18:38.560 align:start position:0%
allowed under this legislation
 
01:18:41.270 --> 01:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
representative Corman thank you Mr
 
01:18:44.510 --> 01:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
chairman uh I like this a whole lot
 
01:18:46.910 --> 01:18:46.920 align:start position:0%
better than the original Bill much much
 
01:18:49.510 --> 01:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
better I thank you for being open to
 
01:18:53.590 --> 01:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
changing it uh there is a typo on line
 
01:18:57.270 --> 01:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
10 where it says RSA 374 G11 that should
 
01:19:01.430 --> 01:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
be 374 f11 there is no 374
 
01:19:04.189 --> 01:19:04.199 align:start position:0%
G11 and and this text is
 
01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:15.510 --> 01:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:18.310 --> 01:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
okay did you find another
 
01:19:20.750 --> 01:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
typo uh it's a question of whether it's
 
01:19:24.070 --> 01:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
a typo or not so um the first date is
 
01:19:28.470 --> 01:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
June 30 2025 to to request an RFP and
 
01:19:31.830 --> 01:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
then an agreement can be made in June 30
 
01:19:34.830 --> 01:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
2026 so one year later but then there's
 
01:19:38.629 --> 01:19:38.639 align:start position:0%
no agreement with the June 30th 2035
 
01:19:41.030 --> 01:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
shouldn't the in line 24 shouldn't that
 
01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
be June 30th
 
01:19:51.110 --> 01:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:56.629 --> 01:19:56.639 align:start position:0%
RFP good question there you go
 
01:19:58.669 --> 01:19:58.679 align:start position:0%
I'm going to circle
 
01:20:03.229 --> 01:20:03.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:06.229 --> 01:20:06.239 align:start position:0%
there so how would you feel about uh
 
01:20:09.030 --> 01:20:09.040 align:start position:0%
adopting this amendment and this
 
01:20:11.110 --> 01:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
legislation and then doing a floor
 
01:20:15.030 --> 01:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:17.350 --> 01:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
typos representative
 
01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
reels thank you Mr chairman still um I
 
01:20:23.790 --> 01:20:23.800 align:start position:0%
I'd be good with it I think U but I had
 
01:20:27.709 --> 01:20:27.719 align:start position:0%
another substantive question really um
 
01:20:31.430 --> 01:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
line 21 a new
 
01:20:35.189 --> 01:20:35.199 align:start position:0%
Clause um the department shall be
 
01:20:37.750 --> 01:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
authorized to issue requests for
 
01:20:39.990 --> 01:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
proposals I assume that's our department
 
01:20:44.669 --> 01:20:44.679 align:start position:0%
of energy and I'm Just Fur my brow at
 
01:20:47.590 --> 01:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
that because is that it seems like I
 
01:20:50.350 --> 01:20:50.360 align:start position:0%
have is that a new role for the State
 
01:20:52.470 --> 01:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
Department of energy to be issuing an
 
01:20:55.270 --> 01:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
RFP on be was that on behalf of of the
 
01:20:57.790 --> 01:20:57.800 align:start position:0%
state's utilities could you
 
01:21:00.030 --> 01:21:00.040 align:start position:0%
elaborate yes when I had a discussion
 
01:21:02.149 --> 01:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
with the Department about this amendment
 
01:21:04.910 --> 01:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
they requested that I add that language
 
01:21:09.550 --> 01:21:09.560 align:start position:0%
and I don't really remember exactly why
 
01:21:17.310 --> 01:21:17.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:19.430 --> 01:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
that if I could you know is that
 
01:21:22.110 --> 01:21:22.120 align:start position:0%
something that's happened before in New
 
01:21:24.149 --> 01:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire seems like a big new thing
 
01:21:25.950 --> 01:21:25.960 align:start position:0%
we'll find in just a
 
01:21:28.709 --> 01:21:28.719 align:start position:0%
second commissioner thank you Mr
 
01:21:30.870 --> 01:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
chairman uh I'm joined by David shulock
 
01:21:32.910 --> 01:21:32.920 align:start position:0%
our general counsel um and and I would
 
01:21:34.510 --> 01:21:34.520 align:start position:0%
say you know when we we discussed with
 
01:21:36.629 --> 01:21:36.639 align:start position:0%
representative V we did we did discuss
 
01:21:37.870 --> 01:21:37.880 align:start position:0%
that it might be something you want to
 
01:21:39.350 --> 01:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
do it's it it really is up to the
 
01:21:40.709 --> 01:21:40.719 align:start position:0%
legislature whether or not you want to
 
01:21:42.550 --> 01:21:42.560 align:start position:0%
include it the reason the department was
 
01:21:45.590 --> 01:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
not included as uh sort of the issuer of
 
01:21:47.990 --> 01:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
the rfps and Senate Bill 54 was due in
 
01:21:50.830 --> 01:21:50.840 align:start position:0%
large part to sort of the uh the time
 
01:21:52.870 --> 01:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
sensitive nature as as I alluded to
 
01:21:54.110 --> 01:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
before that folks wanted to move
 
01:21:56.669 --> 01:21:56.679 align:start position:0%
something forward quickly and that at
 
01:21:58.189 --> 01:21:58.199 align:start position:0%
the time the department did not
 
01:22:02.350 --> 01:22:02.360 align:start position:0%
necessarily have the um expertise or or
 
01:22:04.030 --> 01:22:04.040 align:start position:0%
necess you know the time to go through
 
01:22:06.030 --> 01:22:06.040 align:start position:0%
whatever Contracting process we would
 
01:22:08.510 --> 01:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
have to do to get the expertise on board
 
01:22:10.030 --> 01:22:10.040 align:start position:0%
in the time frame that I think folks
 
01:22:13.030 --> 01:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
were imagining uh it wasn't it wasn't
 
01:22:14.870 --> 01:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
because the department might not be an
 
01:22:18.110 --> 01:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate uh entity to put out an RFP
 
01:22:19.229 --> 01:22:19.239 align:start position:0%
uh especially on something like this
 
01:22:20.830 --> 01:22:20.840 align:start position:0%
where we really have a state public
 
01:22:23.270 --> 01:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
policy goal that this that legislature
 
01:22:25.950 --> 01:22:25.960 align:start position:0%
would be putting into uh effect um I
 
01:22:27.870 --> 01:22:27.880 align:start position:0%
think given the longer time frame that
 
01:22:30.070 --> 01:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
was contemplated here I think out to
 
01:22:32.910 --> 01:22:32.920 align:start position:0%
2035 that is something that it you know
 
01:22:35.070 --> 01:22:35.080 align:start position:0%
if we were to participate to put out an
 
01:22:38.790 --> 01:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
RFP we would be able to um get the next
 
01:22:41.430 --> 01:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
the necessary expertise on board so it's
 
01:22:42.870 --> 01:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
whether or not you want the department
 
01:22:46.669 --> 01:22:46.679 align:start position:0%
to do it uh there are arguments um in in
 
01:22:49.470 --> 01:22:49.480 align:start position:0%
favor and and and maybe against but uh
 
01:22:52.229 --> 01:22:52.239 align:start position:0%
we are comfortable with that Authority
 
01:22:54.510 --> 01:22:54.520 align:start position:0%
so this language would authorize the
 
01:22:57.030 --> 01:22:57.040 align:start position:0%
Department to issue rfps but would not
 
01:23:00.470 --> 01:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
require the department to is issue rfps
 
01:23:02.750 --> 01:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
correct I'll let David weigh and I'm
 
01:23:05.110 --> 01:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
sorry I still haven't seen the amendment
 
01:23:06.990 --> 01:23:07.000 align:start position:0%
I think that's correct but you might
 
01:23:09.990 --> 01:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
want to add in the statute that we are
 
01:23:12.390 --> 01:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
issuing the RFP on behalf of the
 
01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:14.510 align:start position:0%
issuing the RFP on behalf of the
utilities

01:23:14.510 --> 01:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
utilities
 
01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:16.430 align:start position:0%
utilities
yeah

01:23:16.430 --> 01:23:16.440 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:23:19.790 --> 01:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
okay may representative rolds thank you
 
01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:21.070 align:start position:0%
okay may representative rolds thank you
Mr

01:23:21.070 --> 01:23:21.080 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
01:23:25.550 --> 01:23:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:28.270 --> 01:23:28.280 align:start position:0%
articulate some of the
 
01:23:31.790 --> 01:23:31.800 align:start position:0%
potential benefits of having the state
 
01:23:35.390 --> 01:23:35.400 align:start position:0%
act in this way on behalf of the state's
 
01:23:38.590 --> 01:23:38.600 align:start position:0%
utilities as opposed to having the
 
01:23:41.390 --> 01:23:41.400 align:start position:0%
utilities do it for themselves one or
 
01:23:43.350 --> 01:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
more absolutely it's a good question I
 
01:23:44.669 --> 01:23:44.679 align:start position:0%
think and it's one I want to just be
 
01:23:47.510 --> 01:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
careful I'm not um in in no way
 
01:23:49.629 --> 01:23:49.639 align:start position:0%
disparaging the utilities I think you
 
01:23:51.110 --> 01:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
know they would do it fabulously I think
 
01:23:53.070 --> 01:23:53.080 align:start position:0%
there's you could make an argument that
 
01:23:55.030 --> 01:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
this the department as a new neutral
 
01:23:57.430 --> 01:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
sort of uh party here would not
 
01:24:01.270 --> 01:24:01.280 align:start position:0%
necessarily have any conflict uh towards
 
01:24:06.709 --> 01:24:06.719 align:start position:0%
a particular resource um or or you know
 
01:24:07.950 --> 01:24:07.960 align:start position:0%
uh we would we would be able to
 
01:24:10.149 --> 01:24:10.159 align:start position:0%
recognize that the Pol this was a policy
 
01:24:12.470 --> 01:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
direction from the legislature you know
 
01:24:14.750 --> 01:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
you could say that perhaps a utility
 
01:24:15.910 --> 01:24:15.920 align:start position:0%
might say the juice isn't worth the
 
01:24:17.510 --> 01:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
squeeze for them if they're not if
 
01:24:19.270 --> 01:24:19.280 align:start position:0%
they're not necessarily going to benefit
 
01:24:21.110 --> 01:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
from it why would they go through the
 
01:24:23.629 --> 01:24:23.639 align:start position:0%
process of putting out an RFP the the
 
01:24:25.709 --> 01:24:25.719 align:start position:0%
department might more inclined to do
 
01:24:29.070 --> 01:24:29.080 align:start position:0%
that um you know recognizing the
 
01:24:30.750 --> 01:24:30.760 align:start position:0%
direction from the legislature I don't
 
01:24:32.189 --> 01:24:32.199 align:start position:0%
know if David has anything to add to
 
01:24:35.110 --> 01:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
that I think that summarizes
 
01:24:39.550 --> 01:24:39.560 align:start position:0%
it okay representative Harrington has a
 
01:24:41.550 --> 01:24:41.560 align:start position:0%
question first I want to thank
 
01:24:42.750 --> 01:24:42.760 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds for pointing
 
01:24:44.510 --> 01:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
this part out I had missed it and I just
 
01:24:46.750 --> 01:24:46.760 align:start position:0%
trying to read this over to me this is a
 
01:24:51.189 --> 01:24:51.199 align:start position:0%
major major change in policy uh where
 
01:24:52.830 --> 01:24:52.840 align:start position:0%
smells like Massachusetts in the room
 
01:24:54.709 --> 01:24:54.719 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden
 
01:24:56.470 --> 01:24:56.480 align:start position:0%
the department is authorized to issue
 
01:24:58.470 --> 01:24:58.480 align:start position:0%
requests for proposals I I don't even
 
01:24:59.990 --> 01:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
know what that means so the Department's
 
01:25:02.109 --> 01:25:02.119 align:start position:0%
going to go out and say we want you to
 
01:25:05.470 --> 01:25:05.480 align:start position:0%
supply us uh 500 megawatt or 200
 
01:25:07.070 --> 01:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
megawatts of something and then we're
 
01:25:08.510 --> 01:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
going to turn around to the utilities
 
01:25:10.910 --> 01:25:10.920 align:start position:0%
and say you must buy this I mean if you
 
01:25:12.950 --> 01:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
don't have the authority to enforce the
 
01:25:15.510 --> 01:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
contract on the utility then who's going
 
01:25:17.669 --> 01:25:17.679 align:start position:0%
to submit something to you because you
 
01:25:19.270 --> 01:25:19.280 align:start position:0%
be no different than if I went out and
 
01:25:22.270 --> 01:25:22.280 align:start position:0%
said you must Supply utility uh money I
 
01:25:24.470 --> 01:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
I think this is a huge policy change
 
01:25:26.550 --> 01:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
should not be addressed in an amendment
 
01:25:29.350 --> 01:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
like this and I really don't want the
 
01:25:31.350 --> 01:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
department going out and issuing
 
01:25:33.629 --> 01:25:33.639 align:start position:0%
requests for proposals because the only
 
01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
reason that would mean anything is if
 
01:25:37.390 --> 01:25:37.400 align:start position:0%
then going to turn around to the utility
 
01:25:39.790 --> 01:25:39.800 align:start position:0%
and say now we've got a proposal you're
 
01:25:42.310 --> 01:25:42.320 align:start position:0%
buying it and that sets up a huge
 
01:25:44.149 --> 01:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
conflict then because that could go to
 
01:25:46.470 --> 01:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
the Pu and the Pu could turn around and
 
01:25:48.390 --> 01:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
say we're not approving the contract
 
01:25:49.830 --> 01:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
because it's not in the best interest of
 
01:25:51.430 --> 01:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
the rate payers it's too expensive
 
01:25:53.709 --> 01:25:53.719 align:start position:0%
whatever so this is a real rabbit hole
 
01:25:55.669 --> 01:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
with crawling down on this one sentence
 
01:25:58.870 --> 01:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
there so I I can't go along with this Mr
 
01:26:01.030 --> 01:26:01.040 align:start position:0%
chairman do you mind if I just give some
 
01:26:03.910 --> 01:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
thoughts on that um you know uh from our
 
01:26:05.669 --> 01:26:05.679 align:start position:0%
perspective it is up to the legislature
 
01:26:07.030 --> 01:26:07.040 align:start position:0%
whether or not you want to do this you
 
01:26:09.709 --> 01:26:09.719 align:start position:0%
know Senate Bill 54 was an expansion of
 
01:26:12.510 --> 01:26:12.520 align:start position:0%
power purchase agreement Authority uh
 
01:26:13.870 --> 01:26:13.880 align:start position:0%
that was something legislature undertook
 
01:26:15.629 --> 01:26:15.639 align:start position:0%
so if the legislature wants to continue
 
01:26:18.070 --> 01:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
that that's within your purview we will
 
01:26:20.750 --> 01:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
do what we are directed to do by the
 
01:26:22.669 --> 01:26:22.679 align:start position:0%
legislature I'll I'll let David talk a
 
01:26:25.310 --> 01:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
little bit about um what might be
 
01:26:27.149 --> 01:26:27.159 align:start position:0%
necessary if you wanted to pursue this
 
01:26:29.030 --> 01:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
for us to make sure that those contracts
 
01:26:31.790 --> 01:26:31.800 align:start position:0%
are uh
 
01:26:35.510 --> 01:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
enforced so under under this Paradigm uh
 
01:26:37.070 --> 01:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
all of those contracts would go to the
 
01:26:38.990 --> 01:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission for review
 
01:26:41.750 --> 01:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
that's part of that original statute so
 
01:26:44.189 --> 01:26:44.199 align:start position:0%
uh the department would only be issuing
 
01:26:48.750 --> 01:26:48.760 align:start position:0%
the RFP to move things along right um it
 
01:26:50.510 --> 01:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
might be useful to have some additional
 
01:26:52.390 --> 01:26:52.400 align:start position:0%
language and statute about utility
 
01:26:54.830 --> 01:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
responsibility to purchase
 
01:26:57.790 --> 01:26:57.800 align:start position:0%
I can't make that language up here as
 
01:27:00.550 --> 01:27:00.560 align:start position:0%
we're speaking right uh but that that
 
01:27:04.750 --> 01:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
might be useful um you know that there
 
01:27:08.750 --> 01:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
is nothing at this point um and this
 
01:27:10.390 --> 01:27:10.400 align:start position:0%
language would would get us a little
 
01:27:12.870 --> 01:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
closer to it for anr for the Department
 
01:27:17.149 --> 01:27:17.159 align:start position:0%
to do things like issue um requests for
 
01:27:20.109 --> 01:27:20.119 align:start position:0%
information rather than requests for
 
01:27:20.119 --> 01:27:21.629 align:start position:0%
information rather than requests for
proposals

01:27:21.629 --> 01:27:21.639 align:start position:0%
proposals
 
01:27:25.590 --> 01:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
so what would it take who is interested
 
01:27:28.990 --> 01:27:29.000 align:start position:0%
in building anr in New Hampshire for us
 
01:27:31.790 --> 01:27:31.800 align:start position:0%
to purchase right so so that we could
 
01:27:34.390 --> 01:27:34.400 align:start position:0%
start looking at what that market looks
 
01:27:37.990 --> 01:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
like for New Hampshire and um find out
 
01:27:39.669 --> 01:27:39.679 align:start position:0%
if there are companies interested in
 
01:27:42.590 --> 01:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
coming here to to do things like that um
 
01:27:44.790 --> 01:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
that's not I don't think that's required
 
01:27:47.270 --> 01:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
in the language for us to do it uh but
 
01:27:50.109 --> 01:27:50.119 align:start position:0%
this would get us a step closer to
 
01:27:53.590 --> 01:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
it so to that to that point should the
 
01:27:55.830 --> 01:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
language say the department shall be
 
01:27:57.109 --> 01:27:57.119 align:start position:0%
authorized to
 
01:28:00.270 --> 01:28:00.280 align:start position:0%
issue requests for
 
01:28:04.310 --> 01:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:06.470 --> 01:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
proposals you could I don't think it's
 
01:28:09.149 --> 01:28:09.159 align:start position:0%
necessary but you could okay
 
01:28:09.159 --> 01:28:10.470 align:start position:0%
necessary but you could okay
representative

01:28:10.470 --> 01:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:28:12.830 --> 01:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
Harrington I still have a major concern
 
01:28:14.669 --> 01:28:14.679 align:start position:0%
because what it doesn't address is the
 
01:28:17.470 --> 01:28:17.480 align:start position:0%
utility it says the department shall be
 
01:28:18.709 --> 01:28:18.719 align:start position:0%
authorized to Issue request for
 
01:28:21.709 --> 01:28:21.719 align:start position:0%
proposals now so they get the proposal
 
01:28:24.510 --> 01:28:24.520 align:start position:0%
and they then authorized to go go to the
 
01:28:26.950 --> 01:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
utilities and say you will accept this
 
01:28:29.590 --> 01:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
proposal and you will sign a PPA and and
 
01:28:32.510 --> 01:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
then you'll submit that whatever that uh
 
01:28:34.550 --> 01:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
contract is to the Pu or can the
 
01:28:36.550 --> 01:28:36.560 align:start position:0%
utilities just simply say we would have
 
01:28:37.950 --> 01:28:37.960 align:start position:0%
signed that if we thought it was a good
 
01:28:40.270 --> 01:28:40.280 align:start position:0%
idea we don't need you to tell us how to
 
01:28:42.430 --> 01:28:42.440 align:start position:0%
go out and negotiate contracts for
 
01:28:43.910 --> 01:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
electric supply because we've been doing
 
01:28:46.830 --> 01:28:46.840 align:start position:0%
that for the last uh 15 years whatever
 
01:28:48.750 --> 01:28:48.760 align:start position:0%
and we have a lot of experts at that
 
01:28:50.950 --> 01:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
we're not going to do it so I don't know
 
01:28:52.990 --> 01:28:53.000 align:start position:0%
where this leaves us it's like it's like
 
01:28:56.790 --> 01:28:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:00.590 --> 01:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
stopping so I I think you have
 
01:29:04.310 --> 01:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
exposed a Hole uh in in that Paradigm if
 
01:29:06.750 --> 01:29:06.760 align:start position:0%
if we're going to be doing the RFP and
 
01:29:08.750 --> 01:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
it would be useful to have additional
 
01:29:11.109 --> 01:29:11.119 align:start position:0%
language along those lines when I said
 
01:29:14.270 --> 01:29:14.280 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the utilities um that got
 
01:29:16.950 --> 01:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
us part of the way there and you know if
 
01:29:18.750 --> 01:29:18.760 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at we're we're probably not
 
01:29:20.270 --> 01:29:20.280 align:start position:0%
going to do that for renewable since the
 
01:29:24.109 --> 01:29:24.119 align:start position:0%
DAT is passed but for anr you know we
 
01:29:26.189 --> 01:29:26.199 align:start position:0%
would still have 10 years to to work on
 
01:29:29.709 --> 01:29:29.719 align:start position:0%
that process
 
01:29:32.470 --> 01:29:32.480 align:start position:0%
so representative
 
01:29:34.510 --> 01:29:34.520 align:start position:0%
Kaplan yeah I I don't really want to
 
01:29:36.350 --> 01:29:36.360 align:start position:0%
address the debate over whether the
 
01:29:37.910 --> 01:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
department should be the one issuing the
 
01:29:39.070 --> 01:29:39.080 align:start position:0%
rfps or not I think that's an
 
01:29:41.030 --> 01:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
interesting discussion we already you I
 
01:29:43.109 --> 01:29:43.119 align:start position:0%
will just add that we already have state
 
01:29:45.830 --> 01:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
mandated procurement of energy uh in one
 
01:29:48.510 --> 01:29:48.520 align:start position:0%
form or another um but what I do want to
 
01:29:52.109 --> 01:29:52.119 align:start position:0%
address is the the uh the date issue
 
01:29:54.350 --> 01:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
about the you know the original language
 
01:29:57.350 --> 01:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
of Senate bill whatever it was 54 um I
 
01:29:59.950 --> 01:29:59.960 align:start position:0%
think that we ought to be expanding this
 
01:30:02.709 --> 01:30:02.719 align:start position:0%
uh this new program to all forms of
 
01:30:04.510 --> 01:30:04.520 align:start position:0%
energy because right now it's anr and
 
01:30:06.350 --> 01:30:06.360 align:start position:0%
that's you know that's trendy and we
 
01:30:07.910 --> 01:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
like it but 10 years from now it could
 
01:30:09.270 --> 01:30:09.280 align:start position:0%
be something else so why are we just
 
01:30:10.990 --> 01:30:11.000 align:start position:0%
limiting it to anr we should be opening
 
01:30:13.109 --> 01:30:13.119 align:start position:0%
it up again by removing that original
 
01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
language about June 30th 2025 I think
 
01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:17.430 align:start position:0%
language about June 30th 2025 I think
that's

01:30:17.430 --> 01:30:17.440 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:30:20.950 --> 01:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
silly would the department object to
 
01:30:27.430 --> 01:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:31.590 --> 01:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
we would probably have concerns with a
 
01:30:33.950 --> 01:30:33.960 align:start position:0%
full expansion of power purchase
 
01:30:37.709 --> 01:30:37.719 align:start position:0%
agreements um you know we we would have
 
01:30:40.430 --> 01:30:40.440 align:start position:0%
to talk about it there was a bill uh
 
01:30:44.070 --> 01:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
that was introduced uh in the Senate and
 
01:30:46.030 --> 01:30:46.040 align:start position:0%
that that is looks like it's coming over
 
01:30:48.990 --> 01:30:49.000 align:start position:0%
Senate bill I think 112 um that that
 
01:30:50.590 --> 01:30:50.600 align:start position:0%
talked about power purchase agreements
 
01:30:53.510 --> 01:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
you know we did have concerns related to
 
01:30:57.070 --> 01:30:57.080 align:start position:0%
um to rapair impacts and administrative
 
01:31:00.990 --> 01:31:01.000 align:start position:0%
uh impacts uh I'm not prepared to talk
 
01:31:03.830 --> 01:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh to give you a full position on on
 
01:31:05.470 --> 01:31:05.480 align:start position:0%
expanding the date the date was an
 
01:31:08.070 --> 01:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
important guard rail that we had um
 
01:31:10.910 --> 01:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
worked on a couple years ago and to this
 
01:31:12.229 --> 01:31:12.239 align:start position:0%
to this time still still want to
 
01:31:12.239 --> 01:31:13.310 align:start position:0%
to this time still still want to
maintain

01:31:13.310 --> 01:31:13.320 align:start position:0%
maintain
 
01:31:15.470 --> 01:31:15.480 align:start position:0%
that all right let's Reserve that
 
01:31:17.790 --> 01:31:17.800 align:start position:0%
discussion for Senate Bill 112 when it
 
01:31:17.800 --> 01:31:18.790 align:start position:0%
discussion for Senate Bill 112 when it
gets

01:31:18.790 --> 01:31:18.800 align:start position:0%
gets
 
01:31:21.830 --> 01:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
here all right let's representative
 
01:31:24.470 --> 01:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
Corman so uh it's too bad the Patriots
 
01:31:27.030 --> 01:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
are not playing this week because I find
 
01:31:29.310 --> 01:31:29.320 align:start position:0%
myself agreeing with representative
 
01:31:31.430 --> 01:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
Harrington uh for all the reasons he
 
01:31:34.270 --> 01:31:34.280 align:start position:0%
stated and and also I just feel like I
 
01:31:36.310 --> 01:31:36.320 align:start position:0%
think the utilities are very capable of
 
01:31:39.070 --> 01:31:39.080 align:start position:0%
putting out their own
 
01:31:42.830 --> 01:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
rfps all right representative F and
 
01:31:45.149 --> 01:31:45.159 align:start position:0%
thank you chair um since you're we're
 
01:31:51.030 --> 01:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
rewriting it on line five page one you
 
01:31:53.950 --> 01:31:53.960 align:start position:0%
said you took this from another source I
 
01:31:56.510 --> 01:31:56.520 align:start position:0%
didn't write down where but on line six
 
01:32:00.189 --> 01:32:00.199 align:start position:0%
I noticed a dash for describing sodium
 
01:32:02.790 --> 01:32:02.800 align:start position:0%
cold is missing that might or might not
 
01:32:08.149 --> 01:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:11.750 --> 01:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
quotes sorry what are you referring to
 
01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:15.629 align:start position:0%
quotes sorry what are you referring to
specifically

01:32:15.629 --> 01:32:15.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:18.750 --> 01:32:18.760 align:start position:0%
hyphen if you want get
 
01:32:22.070 --> 01:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
that oh sodium cool you think should be
 
01:32:24.550 --> 01:32:24.560 align:start position:0%
hyphen Ed is that what you're saying
 
01:32:26.189 --> 01:32:26.199 align:start position:0%
you all the other ones are and you said
 
01:32:28.350 --> 01:32:28.360 align:start position:0%
you took that from another um just
 
01:32:30.390 --> 01:32:30.400 align:start position:0%
wonder if the quote is
 
01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:32.550 align:start position:0%
wonder if the quote is
exact

01:32:32.550 --> 01:32:32.560 align:start position:0%
exact
 
01:32:36.709 --> 01:32:36.719 align:start position:0%
okay yeah I get it I get it okay well
 
01:32:38.149 --> 01:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
I'm looks like I'm going to walk over
 
01:32:40.270 --> 01:32:40.280 align:start position:0%
and and ask for an amendment anyway
 
01:32:44.590 --> 01:32:44.600 align:start position:0%
another an amendment change so um I can
 
01:32:47.510 --> 01:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
I can do that all right let's uh let's
 
01:32:50.950 --> 01:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
move on because it's getting late
 
01:32:53.990 --> 01:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
um I think we're going to have to defer
 
01:32:56.270 --> 01:32:56.280 align:start position:0%
since there is no Amendment a discussion
 
01:33:00.910 --> 01:33:00.920 align:start position:0%
of HB 535 until the executive
 
01:33:03.350 --> 01:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
session so we've discussed all the
 
01:33:05.550 --> 01:33:05.560 align:start position:0%
Amendments that we're going to have in
 
01:33:08.109 --> 01:33:08.119 align:start position:0%
the executive session so why don't we
 
01:33:13.070 --> 01:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
break now for lunch and return here at
 
01:33:17.310 --> 01:33:17.320 align:start position:0%
1:15 to begin the executive session so I

HB 599 wasn't on my original Mr chair um
 
02:50:51.950 --> 02:50:51.960 align:start position:0%

02:50:56.550 --> 02:50:56.560 align:start position:0%
resolution technically that is that is
 
02:50:56.560 --> 02:50:57.710 align:start position:0%
resolution technically that is that is
correct

02:50:57.710 --> 02:50:57.720 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:51:00.349 --> 02:51:00.359 align:start position:0%
yeah so anyway that's what we're doing
 
02:51:02.150 --> 02:51:02.160 align:start position:0%

charge and I recognize representative
 
02:51:17.190 --> 02:51:17.200 align:start position:0%

discussion on this this morning I I
 
02:51:47.190 --> 02:51:47.200 align:start position:0%
still think it gives the uh ability for
 
02:51:50.110 --> 02:51:50.120 align:start position:0%
the Pu to go back after a period of time
 
02:51:52.790 --> 02:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
to look at um if there would need to be
 
02:51:54.389 --> 02:51:54.399 align:start position:0%
any changes to the way the system
 
02:51:57.429 --> 02:51:57.439 align:start position:0%
benefits are measured and it only does
 
02:52:00.910 --> 02:52:00.920 align:start position:0%
so with a complete adjudicative process
 
02:52:03.150 --> 02:52:03.160 align:start position:0%
and they have to have that open so all
 
02:52:05.670 --> 02:52:05.680 align:start position:0%
parties would be uh present
 
02:52:08.550 --> 02:52:08.560 align:start position:0%
in yesterday was
 
02:52:12.950 --> 02:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
Monday yeah yeah yes I need them by 7
 
02:52:16.070 --> 02:52:16.080 align:start position:0%

to have them turned in by noon tomorrow
 
02:52:22.150 --> 02:52:22.160 align:start position:0%
okay okay okay thank
 
02:52:26.469 --> 02:52:26.479 align:start position:0%
you all right so we have closed the
 
02:52:30.070 --> 02:52:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:32.790 --> 02:52:32.800 align:start position:0%

02:53:04.190 --> 02:53:04.200 align:start position:0%
second moved and seconded that we adopt
 
02:53:07.950 --> 02:53:07.960 align:start position:0%

02:53:07.960 --> 02:53:09.590 align:start position:0%
a motion of octop pass as amended

by
 
02:53:09.600 --> 02:53:11.910 align:start position:0%

0627
 
02:53:14.950 --> 02:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
H we had an extensive discussion about
 
02:53:17.469 --> 02:53:17.479 align:start position:0%
this bill this morning we went over the
 
02:53:20.830 --> 02:53:20.840 align:start position:0%
changes that the amendment makes to the
 
02:53:24.110 --> 02:53:24.120 align:start position:0%
bill and I think everyone has a thorough
 
02:53:26.229 --> 02:53:26.239 align:start position:0%
understanding of the bill at this point
 
02:53:30.590 --> 02:53:30.600 align:start position:0%
in time so I would look for your support
 
02:53:33.990 --> 02:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
for passing this amendment and this bill
 
02:53:34.000 --> 02:53:38.229 align:start position:0%
for passing this amendment and this bill
further

02:53:38.229 --> 02:53:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:41.429 --> 02:53:41.439 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Corman thank
 
02:53:42.389 --> 02:53:42.399 align:start position:0%
you Mr
 
02:53:44.870 --> 02:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
chairman I feel a little awkward here
 
02:53:46.790 --> 02:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
because I actually co-sponsored the bill
 
02:53:48.469 --> 02:53:48.479 align:start position:0%
but I'm going to be voting against it
 
02:53:51.150 --> 02:53:51.160 align:start position:0%
because from what I learned in testimony
 
02:53:53.790 --> 02:53:53.800 align:start position:0%
and and and what I've come to realize in
 
02:53:56.070 --> 02:53:56.080 align:start position:0%
in my own thoughts and discussion is
 
02:53:57.790 --> 02:53:57.800 align:start position:0%
that I'm I'm I'm concerned here about
 
02:54:00.550 --> 02:54:00.560 align:start position:0%
safety I'm concerned about someone
 
02:54:02.750 --> 02:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
really just unregulated running their
 
02:54:06.269 --> 02:54:06.279 align:start position:0%
own power plant um and just all the
 
02:54:09.229 --> 02:54:09.239 align:start position:0%
Mayhem that may ensue
 
02:54:12.510 --> 02:54:12.520 align:start position:0%
so just as I've learned about it and
 
02:54:14.630 --> 02:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
thought about it I decided to vote
 
02:54:16.349 --> 02:54:16.359 align:start position:0%
against it even though I was a
 
02:54:16.359 --> 02:54:18.510 align:start position:0%
against it even though I was a
co-sponsor

02:54:18.510 --> 02:54:18.520 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor
 
02:54:21.030 --> 02:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
02:54:23.870 --> 02:54:23.880 align:start position:0%
Summers thank you Mr chairman um after
 
02:54:25.510 --> 02:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
looking at it and discussing the the
 
02:54:26.670 --> 02:54:26.680 align:start position:0%
bill here with especially with the
 
02:54:29.070 --> 02:54:29.080 align:start position:0%
amendment where it makes them exempt
 
02:54:32.229 --> 02:54:32.239 align:start position:0%
from RSA title 34 and then looking to
 
02:54:36.190 --> 02:54:36.200 align:start position:0%
find that RSA 34 is just basically how
 
02:54:38.269 --> 02:54:38.279 align:start position:0%
the state and the bureaucracy grabs
 
02:54:40.990 --> 02:54:41.000 align:start position:0%
revenue from the electrical companies
 
02:54:43.670 --> 02:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
therefore the reason why they'd want RSA
 
02:54:46.070 --> 02:54:46.080 align:start position:0%
34 in place so they can get their hands
 
02:54:48.590 --> 02:54:48.600 align:start position:0%
on the money for it um I am voting for
 
02:54:48.600 --> 02:54:49.670 align:start position:0%
on the money for it um I am voting for
this

02:54:49.670 --> 02:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:54:51.590 --> 02:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
bill further
 
02:54:54.950 --> 02:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Thomas um
 
02:54:57.670 --> 02:54:57.680 align:start position:0%
Wendy Thomas thank you Mr chair um it
 
02:55:00.590 --> 02:55:00.600 align:start position:0%
was stated that this bill um leaves the
 
02:55:04.110 --> 02:55:04.120 align:start position:0%
solving of problems to innovators um my
 
02:55:06.269 --> 02:55:06.279 align:start position:0%
concern about that is that it also open
 
02:55:08.309 --> 02:55:08.319 align:start position:0%
opens up a situation of the Wild Wild
 
02:55:10.710 --> 02:55:10.720 align:start position:0%
West in New Hampshire so I will also be
 
02:55:12.750 --> 02:55:12.760 align:start position:0%
voting against this
 
02:55:15.790 --> 02:55:15.800 align:start position:0%
bill further
 
02:55:19.750 --> 02:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
discussion see uh representative Swanson
 
02:55:22.429 --> 02:55:22.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I believe that uh
 
02:55:25.269 --> 02:55:25.279 align:start position:0%
there are this this bill opens up too
 
02:55:29.070 --> 02:55:29.080 align:start position:0%
many opportunities for unintended
 
02:55:31.870 --> 02:55:31.880 align:start position:0%
consequences and is not thoroughly
 
02:55:35.110 --> 02:55:35.120 align:start position:0%
vetted as far as what they might be so
 
02:55:39.309 --> 02:55:39.319 align:start position:0%
I'm against this further
 
02:55:42.630 --> 02:55:42.640 align:start position:0%
discussion representative parshall thank
 
02:55:46.110 --> 02:55:46.120 align:start position:0%
you chair um my concern U is that we are
 
02:55:49.790 --> 02:55:49.800 align:start position:0%
putting our thumb on on uh small nuclear
 
02:55:52.950 --> 02:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
reactors which could be a very viable
 
02:55:54.670 --> 02:55:54.680 align:start position:0%
solution but I think that they we need
 
02:55:57.150 --> 02:55:57.160 align:start position:0%
to let the market play out on this so
 
02:55:58.550 --> 02:55:58.560 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm going to keep probably going to
 
02:56:03.590 --> 02:56:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:05.389 --> 02:56:05.399 align:start position:0%

672 we are still waiting for an
 
02:59:34.269 --> 02:59:34.279 align:start position:0%
amendment on House Bill
 
02:59:38.269 --> 02:59:38.279 align:start position:0%
710 just to fill everybody in so I check
 
02:59:42.190 --> 02:59:42.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:45.950 --> 02:59:45.960 align:start position:0%
yet doesn't appear to be here yet just
 
02:59:48.790 --> 02:59:48.800 align:start position:0%
to uh let everybody know I corrected
 
02:59:50.030 --> 02:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
those three
 
02:59:53.950 --> 02:59:53.960 align:start position:0%
typos and eliminated the sentence that
 
02:59:57.910 --> 02:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
allows the department of energy to
 
03:00:00.510 --> 03:00:00.520 align:start position:0%
submit requests for proposals that
 
03:00:03.190 --> 03:00:03.200 align:start position:0%
seemed to be a fairly significant policy
 
03:00:05.710 --> 03:00:05.720 align:start position:0%
change that wasn't made clear to me when
 
03:00:08.030 --> 03:00:08.040 align:start position:0%
I I made the produced the original
 
03:00:10.830 --> 03:00:10.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment so the new Amendment deletes
 
03:00:12.710 --> 03:00:12.720 align:start position:0%
that sentence
 
03:00:15.349 --> 03:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
altogether and we'll have that at some
 
03:00:18.389 --> 03:00:18.399 align:start position:0%
point I don't don't know exactly when so
 
03:00:30.950 --> 03:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:34.830 --> 03:00:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:38.070 --> 03:00:38.080 align:start position:0%
hr15 I'll open an exec session on that
 
03:00:40.190 --> 03:00:40.200 align:start position:0%
and I'll can on representative
 
03:00:45.309 --> 03:00:45.319 align:start position:0%
Harrington for a motion on the bill and
 
03:00:47.590 --> 03:00:47.600 align:start position:0%
an amendment oops I don't have the
 
03:00:50.389 --> 03:00:50.399 align:start position:0%
amendment number in front of me
 
03:00:53.429 --> 03:00:53.439 align:start position:0%

Amendment
 
03:01:03.110 --> 03:01:03.120 align:start position:0%
0679 which basically replaces the uh
 
03:01:05.590 --> 03:01:05.600 align:start position:0%
first part of the bill and then I move
 
03:01:07.830 --> 03:01:07.840 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on the
 
03:01:10.790 --> 03:01:10.800 align:start position:0%

representative Matson I second it moved

03:01:37.750 --> 03:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
0679 H representative
 
03:01:39.590 --> 03:01:39.600 align:start position:0%
Harrington well I don't think we need
 
03:01:41.190 --> 03:01:41.200 align:start position:0%
too much more discussion on this it
 
03:01:44.349 --> 03:01:44.359 align:start position:0%
basically says that in a nutshell the uh
 
03:01:46.429 --> 03:01:46.439 align:start position:0%
utility projects that are done for
 
03:01:48.469 --> 03:01:48.479 align:start position:0%
Distribution Systems in New hampsh sure
 
03:01:50.510 --> 03:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
are scrutinized by the Pu and the
 
03:01:52.309 --> 03:01:52.319 align:start position:0%
utility has the obligation of proving
 
03:01:54.070 --> 03:01:54.080 align:start position:0%
their costs just and reasonable in order
 
03:01:57.389 --> 03:01:57.399 align:start position:0%
to collect them on the other hand on the
 
03:01:59.630 --> 03:01:59.640 align:start position:0%
federal level if a transmission project
 
03:02:03.469 --> 03:02:03.479 align:start position:0%
which could be 10 20 50 times more
 
03:02:05.990 --> 03:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
expensive uh FK has a policy of
 
03:02:08.190 --> 03:02:08.200 align:start position:0%
presumption of prudency which they say
 
03:02:10.110 --> 03:02:10.120 align:start position:0%
whatever cost is submitted by the
 
03:02:12.389 --> 03:02:12.399 align:start position:0%
transmission company are assumed to be
 
03:02:14.070 --> 03:02:14.080 align:start position:0%
just and reasonable unless someone else
 
03:02:16.429 --> 03:02:16.439 align:start position:0%
proves otherwise this would ask uh
 
03:02:18.469 --> 03:02:18.479 align:start position:0%
Congressional members down
 
03:02:20.710 --> 03:02:20.720 align:start position:0%
uh obviously in Washington to do
 
03:02:24.710 --> 03:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
whatever they could to change this firk
 
03:02:28.389 --> 03:02:28.399 align:start position:0%
policy okay thank you I think the U
 
03:02:31.950 --> 03:02:31.960 align:start position:0%
language on lines three through five
 
03:02:33.510 --> 03:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
that spells
 
03:02:37.309 --> 03:02:37.319 align:start position:0%
out that current FK policy is to accept
 
03:02:39.910 --> 03:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
new and upgraded transmission
 
03:02:43.269 --> 03:02:43.279 align:start position:0%
costs via a presumption of prudence
 
03:02:45.590 --> 03:02:45.600 align:start position:0%
without a detailed review of individ
 
03:02:49.550 --> 03:02:49.560 align:start position:0%
individual project cost is a a good
 
03:02:51.710 --> 03:02:51.720 align:start position:0%
addition to this amendment I think that
 
03:02:54.710 --> 03:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
spells out exactly why we are concerned
 
03:02:56.870 --> 03:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
about this issue so thank you
 
03:03:01.229 --> 03:03:01.239 align:start position:0%
representative McGee for um putting that
 
03:03:04.269 --> 03:03:04.279 align:start position:0%
together any further
 
03:03:07.590 --> 03:03:07.600 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Thomas Wendy
 
03:03:10.469 --> 03:03:10.479 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you Mr chair um this is
 
03:03:12.150 --> 03:03:12.160 align:start position:0%
going to come as a shock to everyone I
 
03:03:15.110 --> 03:03:15.120 align:start position:0%
think but um I agree with this um
 
03:03:19.110 --> 03:03:19.120 align:start position:0%
resolution with the except of the final
 
03:03:21.349 --> 03:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
line with the state librarian I just
 
03:03:23.349 --> 03:03:23.359 align:start position:0%
think it's redundant but it's not enough
 
03:03:25.349 --> 03:03:25.359 align:start position:0%
for me to vote against
 
03:03:28.229 --> 03:03:28.239 align:start position:0%

03:06:04.590 --> 03:06:04.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:06:10.469 --> 03:06:10.479 align:start position:0%
Swanson yes chairman Vose yes 17 z i a
 
03:06:13.990 --> 03:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
vote of 17 to zero the committee adopts
 
03:06:16.630 --> 03:06:16.640 align:start position:0%
hr15 representative Harrington will
 
03:06:18.710 --> 03:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
write the committee
 
03:06:22.670 --> 03:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
report but the bill will not go on the
 
03:06:26.150 --> 03:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
consent calendar so
 
03:06:29.630 --> 03:06:29.640 align:start position:0%
that representative Harrington if he can
 
03:06:32.229 --> 03:06:32.239 align:start position:0%
persuade the speaker and the clerk can
 
03:06:35.070 --> 03:06:35.080 align:start position:0%
speak on the bill on the
 
03:06:37.550 --> 03:06:37.560 align:start position:0%
floor so with that we'll close the
 
03:06:43.790 --> 03:06:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:47.229 --> 03:06:47.239 align:start position:0%
15 representative parshall yes I'm sorry
 
03:06:50.429 --> 03:06:50.439 align:start position:0%
Dr the flow here but um how do you keep
 
03:06:52.710 --> 03:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
a bill I mean this is informative to me
 
03:06:54.910 --> 03:06:54.920 align:start position:0%
I've never seen a bill pass that should
 
03:06:56.710 --> 03:06:56.720 align:start position:0%
be on consent that is purposely not
 
03:06:58.910 --> 03:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
going to be on consent would it help if
 
03:07:03.990 --> 03:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
we had 10 people to pull it off consent
 
03:07:06.670 --> 03:07:06.680 align:start position:0%
no okay okay you can just say please
 
03:07:09.229 --> 03:07:09.239 align:start position:0%
don't put on consent that's good enough
 
03:07:11.830 --> 03:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
y it's our decision whether to put it on
 
03:07:13.990 --> 03:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
consent or not not the clerk's decision
 
03:07:16.469 --> 03:07:16.479 align:start position:0%
it's our decision so if we say no
 
03:07:18.630 --> 03:07:18.640 align:start position:0%
consent then it doesn't go on consent
 
03:07:19.750 --> 03:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
that's good to know I never do that
 
03:07:19.760 --> 03:07:21.269 align:start position:0%
that's good to know I never do that
thank

03:07:21.269 --> 03:07:21.279 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:07:24.910 --> 03:07:24.920 align:start position:0%
you yes representative n so another
 
03:07:26.550 --> 03:07:26.560 align:start position:0%
example of something not going on
 
03:07:28.950 --> 03:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
consent would be like um a bill to name
 
03:07:31.550 --> 03:07:31.560 align:start position:0%
a bridge in a town after someone that
 
03:07:33.269 --> 03:07:33.279 align:start position:0%
would the whole committee votes for it
 
03:07:34.870 --> 03:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
and it's not on consent because they
 
03:07:36.870 --> 03:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
want to talk about it I've seen that
 
03:07:39.429 --> 03:07:39.439 align:start position:0%
before thank you so much you're
 
03:07:41.990 --> 03:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
welcome right you'll recall that on
 
03:07:44.950 --> 03:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
occasion there's someone in the gallery
 
03:07:47.910 --> 03:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
that's affected by a bill and so uh even
 
03:07:49.590 --> 03:07:49.600 align:start position:0%
though it might be unanimous that the
 
03:07:52.349 --> 03:07:52.359 align:start position:0%
house adopts the bill you still want to
 
03:07:53.910 --> 03:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
talk about it so you can recognize the
 
03:07:56.550 --> 03:07:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:00.070 --> 03:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
gallery all right so moving along we
 
03:08:02.229 --> 03:08:02.239 align:start position:0%
still don't have the amendment for House
 
03:08:05.990 --> 03:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
Bill 710 yet that last
 
03:08:09.110 --> 03:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
check so we will now move
 
03:08:12.150 --> 03:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
to House Bill
 
03:08:14.910 --> 03:08:14.920 align:start position:0%
535 relative to defining the role of the
 
03:08:17.590 --> 03:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission and I will
 
03:08:20.429 --> 03:08:20.439 align:start position:0%
recognize representative
 
03:08:24.510 --> 03:08:24.520 align:start position:0%
Bernardi move itl chair recognizes
 
03:08:27.429 --> 03:08:27.439 align:start position:0%
representative schneller second moved
 
03:08:29.750 --> 03:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
and seconded that we adopt the motion of
 
03:08:32.469 --> 03:08:32.479 align:start position:0%
itl on House Bill
 
03:08:35.670 --> 03:08:35.680 align:start position:0%
535 chair recognizes representative
 
03:08:38.389 --> 03:08:38.399 align:start position:0%
Bernardi so the the predominant reason
 
03:08:42.950 --> 03:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
for iing this is because uh it
 
03:08:48.469 --> 03:08:48.479 align:start position:0%
requires uh any um agreement that is
 
03:08:53.030 --> 03:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
reached between the parties cannot be
 
03:08:55.389 --> 03:08:55.399 align:start position:0%
reviewed or would not be reviewed by the
 
03:08:58.870 --> 03:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
Pu so essentially takes the Pu out of
 
03:09:01.590 --> 03:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
the out of the function of that that is
 
03:09:04.349 --> 03:09:04.359 align:start position:0%
their job to review the review these
 
03:09:10.710 --> 03:09:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:12.590 --> 03:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate further comment
 
03:09:15.990 --> 03:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
representative Corman thank you Mr
 
03:09:18.670 --> 03:09:18.680 align:start position:0%
chairman the testimony we heard
 
03:09:22.510 --> 03:09:22.520 align:start position:0%
yesterday from the Pu said
 
03:09:27.110 --> 03:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
that they can only base on the evidence
 
03:09:29.269 --> 03:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
that they're presented at hearings
 
03:09:31.150 --> 03:09:31.160 align:start position:0%
that's why they wanted to make sure that
 
03:09:33.150 --> 03:09:33.160 align:start position:0%
the doe was at at
 
03:09:33.160 --> 03:09:35.190 align:start position:0%
the doe was at at
hearings

03:09:35.190 --> 03:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
03:09:39.630 --> 03:09:39.640 align:start position:0%
and given that it seems that if all the
 
03:09:40.870 --> 03:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
evidence they're
 
03:09:44.870 --> 03:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
getting from the parties agrees about a
 
03:09:46.550 --> 03:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
settlement they're not going to get any
 
03:09:48.469 --> 03:09:48.479 align:start position:0%
other evidence so they're going to end
 
03:09:52.269 --> 03:09:52.279 align:start position:0%
up concluding that anyway so I don't see
 
03:09:54.910 --> 03:09:54.920 align:start position:0%
why there's a problem with this if all
 
03:09:57.229 --> 03:09:57.239 align:start position:0%
the parties agree and all the evidence
 
03:10:00.349 --> 03:10:00.359 align:start position:0%
presented to the puc says we're we're in
 
03:10:03.030 --> 03:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
agreement on this what would the Pu have
 
03:10:06.469 --> 03:10:06.479 align:start position:0%
to go on that was presented to the
 
03:10:08.469 --> 03:10:08.479 align:start position:0%
contrary other than what the bill says
 
03:10:09.990 --> 03:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
would be which is if something is
 
03:10:12.670 --> 03:10:12.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:15.190 --> 03:10:15.200 align:start position:0%
law well to answer your question it
 
03:10:18.030 --> 03:10:18.040 align:start position:0%
could allow one of the regulated
 
03:10:21.790 --> 03:10:21.800 align:start position:0%
utilities to bypass pu review if they
 
03:10:23.710 --> 03:10:23.720 align:start position:0%
just agree to a
 
03:10:27.070 --> 03:10:27.080 align:start position:0%
settlement then whatever they have
 
03:10:29.190 --> 03:10:29.200 align:start position:0%
proposed or whatever is proposed in the
 
03:10:29.200 --> 03:10:30.190 align:start position:0%
proposed or whatever is proposed in the
settlement

03:10:30.190 --> 03:10:30.200 align:start position:0%
settlement
 
03:10:32.349 --> 03:10:32.359 align:start position:0%
agreement according to this stat
 
03:10:34.870 --> 03:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
according to this bill would have to be
 
03:10:37.150 --> 03:10:37.160 align:start position:0%
adopted by the Pu so it would allow the
 
03:10:40.269 --> 03:10:40.279 align:start position:0%
utilities to bypass pu review in that
 
03:10:44.190 --> 03:10:44.200 align:start position:0%
case and they could cleverly manipulate
 
03:10:46.590 --> 03:10:46.600 align:start position:0%
the settlement process to create
 
03:10:49.750 --> 03:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
settlements that favor them without
 
03:10:51.870 --> 03:10:51.880 align:start position:0%
having any review by the Pu so I think
 
03:10:54.389 --> 03:10:54.399 align:start position:0%
this is a very dangerous piece of
 
03:10:57.349 --> 03:10:57.359 align:start position:0%
legislation to pass uh in its current
 
03:11:00.030 --> 03:11:00.040 align:start position:0%
form uh nobody wanted this piece of
 
03:11:02.150 --> 03:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
legislation nobody testified in favor of
 
03:11:06.309 --> 03:11:06.319 align:start position:0%
it except the consumer Advocate and I I
 
03:11:08.190 --> 03:11:08.200 align:start position:0%
just think this is a
 
03:11:10.870 --> 03:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
dangerous um piece of legislation there
 
03:11:14.790 --> 03:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
is there's no confusion or uncertainty
 
03:11:17.710 --> 03:11:17.720 align:start position:0%
about the respective roles of the Pu and
 
03:11:24.269 --> 03:11:24.279 align:start position:0%
doe in this regard and uh so I I just I
 
03:11:26.269 --> 03:11:26.279 align:start position:0%
I agree with representative Bernardi
 
03:11:28.550 --> 03:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
that this is a dangerous bill and we
 
03:11:30.150 --> 03:11:30.160 align:start position:0%
shouldn't go forward with
 
03:11:35.990 --> 03:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
it representative Corbin thank you
 
03:11:38.990 --> 03:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
um well for one thing we heard nothing
 
03:11:42.110 --> 03:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
but Discord yesterday between doe and
 
03:11:44.429 --> 03:11:44.439 align:start position:0%
pu uh so I I don't think they're on the
 
03:11:47.710 --> 03:11:47.720 align:start position:0%
same page about about who has what what
 
03:11:51.950 --> 03:11:51.960 align:start position:0%
power uh and with regard to the
 
03:11:54.110 --> 03:11:54.120 align:start position:0%
utilities being able to do things
 
03:11:57.550 --> 03:11:57.560 align:start position:0%
unchecked I I would point out that in uh
 
03:12:01.990 --> 03:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
page two section five um starting on
 
03:12:05.269 --> 03:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
line 23 it says in any contested case
 
03:12:06.790 --> 03:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
before the commission to which the
 
03:12:08.710 --> 03:12:08.720 align:start position:0%
department of energy and the office of
 
03:12:12.510 --> 03:12:12.520 align:start position:0%
the consumer Advocate are parties so
 
03:12:14.150 --> 03:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
it's not just the utilities that would
 
03:12:16.790 --> 03:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
be presenting something the the doe and
 
03:12:18.590 --> 03:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
the consumer Advocate would have to
 
03:12:21.150 --> 03:12:21.160 align:start position:0%
agree and you know the consumer Advocate
 
03:12:22.990 --> 03:12:23.000 align:start position:0%
is not really noted for just going along
 
03:12:27.269 --> 03:12:27.279 align:start position:0%
with the utilities so I I don't see a a
 
03:12:30.070 --> 03:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
problem here about the utilities um
 
03:12:32.389 --> 03:12:32.399 align:start position:0%
running a muck or anything like that I I
 
03:12:35.269 --> 03:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
I think that uh you know we we have the
 
03:12:38.750 --> 03:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
right checks here to make sure that we
 
03:12:42.229 --> 03:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
have the right parties in the
 
03:12:44.150 --> 03:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
agreement further discussion
 
03:12:44.160 --> 03:12:45.429 align:start position:0%
agreement further discussion
representative

03:12:45.429 --> 03:12:45.439 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:12:47.950 --> 03:12:47.960 align:start position:0%
bernardy I just think the right checks
 
03:12:50.110 --> 03:12:50.120 align:start position:0%
are in the adjudicative process that
 
03:12:54.870 --> 03:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
occurs in front of the Pu so uh if
 
03:12:57.349 --> 03:12:57.359 align:start position:0%
parties have largely agreed on an
 
03:12:59.910 --> 03:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
approach they can present that approach
 
03:13:04.110 --> 03:13:04.120 align:start position:0%
but the Pu gets to ask questions about
 
03:13:06.349 --> 03:13:06.359 align:start position:0%
the data that's presented to them to
 
03:13:09.349 --> 03:13:09.359 align:start position:0%
tease out if there's any underlying
 
03:13:12.190 --> 03:13:12.200 align:start position:0%
issues and and if they just have to
 
03:13:15.309 --> 03:13:15.319 align:start position:0%
accept an agreement as written that
 
03:13:18.229 --> 03:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
opportunity is foreclosed
 
03:13:20.790 --> 03:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative McGee
 
03:13:25.070 --> 03:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um okay I I I'm
 
03:13:26.670 --> 03:13:26.680 align:start position:0%
rereading the bill because I think it's
 
03:13:28.190 --> 03:13:28.200 align:start position:0%
really important to see what it actually
 
03:13:30.070 --> 03:13:30.080 align:start position:0%
says rather than just what we all think
 
03:13:33.870 --> 03:13:33.880 align:start position:0%
it says and it it does seem to be a good
 
03:13:37.070 --> 03:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
faith effort to try and
 
03:13:41.229 --> 03:13:41.239 align:start position:0%
um try and Define areas where there has
 
03:13:45.790 --> 03:13:45.800 align:start position:0%
been some difficulty uh or some question
 
03:13:48.590 --> 03:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
as to who plays which role role so it it
 
03:13:53.309 --> 03:13:53.319 align:start position:0%
makes an effort to parse those uh roles
 
03:13:56.910 --> 03:13:56.920 align:start position:0%
but to representative Bernard's
 
03:14:01.469 --> 03:14:01.479 align:start position:0%
Point part two line five page two says
 
03:14:03.070 --> 03:14:03.080 align:start position:0%
the authority of the commission shall
 
03:14:04.910 --> 03:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
consist of conducting contested
 
03:14:06.469 --> 03:14:06.479 align:start position:0%
adjudicative proceedings within the
 
03:14:11.150 --> 03:14:11.160 align:start position:0%
meaning of RSA 541 D a31 on matters
 
03:14:13.110 --> 03:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
concerning the rates charges tariffs and
 
03:14:14.590 --> 03:14:14.600 align:start position:0%
services provided by the public
 
03:14:18.870 --> 03:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
utilities um as defined in RSA 362 colon
 
03:14:22.349 --> 03:14:22.359 align:start position:0%
2 and others as specifically authorized
 
03:14:24.510 --> 03:14:24.520 align:start position:0%
under this title and to adopt
 
03:14:26.870 --> 03:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
administrative rules consistent with its
 
03:14:29.670 --> 03:14:29.680 align:start position:0%
Authority as provided in this title they
 
03:14:33.870 --> 03:14:33.880 align:start position:0%
are authorized to conduct adjudicative
 
03:14:36.349 --> 03:14:36.359 align:start position:0%
proceedings which means asking questions
 
03:14:39.110 --> 03:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
requiring evidence calling the utilities
 
03:14:41.510 --> 03:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
and other stakeholders on the carpet to
 
03:14:43.790 --> 03:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
answer the questions that they have so
 
03:14:47.349 --> 03:14:47.359 align:start position:0%
this doesn't limit or eliminate any of
 
03:14:49.630 --> 03:14:49.640 align:start position:0%
the authority of the Pu it merely tries
 
03:14:52.389 --> 03:14:52.399 align:start position:0%
to clarify the places where there seems
 
03:14:54.790 --> 03:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
to be difficulty in the process that has
 
03:14:57.229 --> 03:14:57.239 align:start position:0%
been observed by the people who are over
 
03:14:59.349 --> 03:14:59.359 align:start position:0%
there watching how things are operating
 
03:15:03.150 --> 03:15:03.160 align:start position:0%
at this point um and the other bolded
 
03:15:06.469 --> 03:15:06.479 align:start position:0%
sections I mean this is a a wholesale
 
03:15:08.550 --> 03:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
rewriting right this is a I don't know
 
03:15:10.950 --> 03:15:10.960 align:start position:0%
is this a new section the whole
 
03:15:14.510 --> 03:15:14.520 align:start position:0%
thing looking to see where it starts
 
03:15:19.510 --> 03:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:21.309 --> 03:15:21.319 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't see what it's replacing
 
03:15:23.990 --> 03:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
actually at the it's just adding a
 
03:15:29.189 --> 03:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
paragraph to um to 3631 a section yeah
 
03:15:29.199 --> 03:15:30.830 align:start position:0%
paragraph to um to 3631 a section yeah
yeah

03:15:30.830 --> 03:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:15:34.429 --> 03:15:34.439 align:start position:0%
um so so the other bolded section on
 
03:15:36.309 --> 03:15:36.319 align:start position:0%
page three line
 
03:15:39.070 --> 03:15:39.080 align:start position:0%
two it shall further be the duty of the
 
03:15:40.670 --> 03:15:40.680 align:start position:0%
Department of energy to petition the
 
03:15:42.990 --> 03:15:43.000 align:start position:0%
commission for appropriate relief
 
03:15:49.670 --> 03:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
through RSA 36541 to 44 RSA 374 col 41
 
03:15:51.389 --> 03:15:51.399 align:start position:0%
or other appropriate action when the
 
03:15:53.229 --> 03:15:53.239 align:start position:0%
department reasonably believes that a
 
03:15:55.510 --> 03:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
public utility is failing to discharge
 
03:15:58.510 --> 03:15:58.520 align:start position:0%
its obligation pursuant to this title I
 
03:16:00.590 --> 03:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
thought the explanation in reference to
 
03:16:03.830 --> 03:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
this bill yesterday was that when there
 
03:16:05.790 --> 03:16:05.800 align:start position:0%
is an adjudicative proceeding where the
 
03:16:09.670 --> 03:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
parties have all come to agreement in
 
03:16:12.590 --> 03:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
front of um the Public Utilities
 
03:16:15.670 --> 03:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
Commission that they should make a good
 
03:16:17.110 --> 03:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
faith effort to let that go through true
 
03:16:20.349 --> 03:16:20.359 align:start position:0%
unless they have some specific reason
 
03:16:22.110 --> 03:16:22.120 align:start position:0%
you know because it is costly for
 
03:16:23.670 --> 03:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
everyone to continue to convene and
 
03:16:25.469 --> 03:16:25.479 align:start position:0%
convene and convene in front of a body
 
03:16:27.870 --> 03:16:27.880 align:start position:0%
that isn't coming to a conclusion on
 
03:16:30.309 --> 03:16:30.319 align:start position:0%
something where everyone else that's
 
03:16:34.269 --> 03:16:34.279 align:start position:0%
involved is already um at a settlement
 
03:16:36.550 --> 03:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
because they they usually are um on
 
03:16:36.560 --> 03:16:37.630 align:start position:0%
because they they usually are um on
opposing

03:16:37.630 --> 03:16:37.640 align:start position:0%
opposing
 
03:16:40.429 --> 03:16:40.439 align:start position:0%
sides representative
 
03:16:44.030 --> 03:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
Bernardi so the key word that you read I
 
03:16:46.189 --> 03:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
think was the third or fourth word in in
 
03:16:49.590 --> 03:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
your initial reading was
 
03:16:52.389 --> 03:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
contested the issue here is if there's
 
03:16:54.229 --> 03:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
an agreement that's been signed and
 
03:16:57.070 --> 03:16:57.080 align:start position:0%
everybody signs off on it it isn't
 
03:16:59.189 --> 03:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
contested and therefore all those
 
03:17:02.030 --> 03:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
proceedings are not on the table what
 
03:17:06.349 --> 03:17:06.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:08.670 --> 03:17:08.680 align:start position:0%
proceeding ask
 
03:17:11.990 --> 03:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
questions no it doesn't say uh that you
 
03:17:14.309 --> 03:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
read the word contested if it is
 
03:17:16.309 --> 03:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
contested then you can do all those
 
03:17:19.550 --> 03:17:19.560 align:start position:0%
things the the the point of this bill
 
03:17:22.910 --> 03:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
was it opens up the opportunity for
 
03:17:25.750 --> 03:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
behind this the
 
03:17:32.590 --> 03:17:32.600 align:start position:0%
puc's purview agreeing on a uh a a an
 
03:17:35.590 --> 03:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
approach and there's no contest
 
03:17:40.269 --> 03:17:40.279 align:start position:0%
therefore just rubber stamp it and move
 
03:17:42.790 --> 03:17:42.800 align:start position:0%
on okay further discussion
 
03:17:42.800 --> 03:17:44.469 align:start position:0%
on okay further discussion
representative

03:17:44.469 --> 03:17:44.479 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:17:47.189 --> 03:17:47.199 align:start position:0%
Harrington yeah my major problem with
 
03:17:48.830 --> 03:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
this is first of all I'm not even quite
 
03:17:51.910 --> 03:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
sure if it's legal um what you're having
 
03:17:55.349 --> 03:17:55.359 align:start position:0%
here is a a group of parties presenting
 
03:17:59.150 --> 03:17:59.160 align:start position:0%
something to the adjudicative body
 
03:18:02.269 --> 03:18:02.279 align:start position:0%
saying that excuse me that we all agree
 
03:18:04.110 --> 03:18:04.120 align:start position:0%
this is the way this uh issue should be
 
03:18:05.710 --> 03:18:05.720 align:start position:0%
resolved and you're saying the
 
03:18:09.229 --> 03:18:09.239 align:start position:0%
adjudicative body has no um ability to
 
03:18:11.590 --> 03:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
do anything other than to say well
 
03:18:14.870 --> 03:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
that's a legal um solution so therefore
 
03:18:17.110 --> 03:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
we must approve it it would be sort of
 
03:18:20.110 --> 03:18:20.120 align:start position:0%
like to put an analogy the uh in the
 
03:18:22.590 --> 03:18:22.600 align:start position:0%
courts where the district attorney and
 
03:18:24.349 --> 03:18:24.359 align:start position:0%
the defense attorney reach some kind of
 
03:18:26.510 --> 03:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
an agreement on a plea bargain and they
 
03:18:29.349 --> 03:18:29.359 align:start position:0%
go to the judge and the judge says you
 
03:18:30.750 --> 03:18:30.760 align:start position:0%
want to let this person out he's
 
03:18:32.910 --> 03:18:32.920 align:start position:0%
murdered two people with only five years
 
03:18:34.990 --> 03:18:35.000 align:start position:0%
no I'm not approving the plea bargain if
 
03:18:36.710 --> 03:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
we put this into effect the judge would
 
03:18:38.790 --> 03:18:38.800 align:start position:0%
have absolutely no authority to do it
 
03:18:40.030 --> 03:18:40.040 align:start position:0%
he'd have to say well whatever you guys
 
03:18:42.349 --> 03:18:42.359 align:start position:0%
agree to it's not illegal so you can let
 
03:18:44.630 --> 03:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
the guy get out with one day in jail if
 
03:18:46.150 --> 03:18:46.160 align:start position:0%
you want to but I don't have no
 
03:18:48.189 --> 03:18:48.199 align:start position:0%
authority to overturn it you you don't
 
03:18:50.670 --> 03:18:50.680 align:start position:0%
take that Authority away from the Pu and
 
03:18:52.189 --> 03:18:52.199 align:start position:0%
I can tell you as a former pu
 
03:18:54.870 --> 03:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner if someone brought me a a
 
03:18:57.229 --> 03:18:57.239 align:start position:0%
deal like that and said here it is we've
 
03:18:59.189 --> 03:18:59.199 align:start position:0%
all agreed with it I would want to
 
03:19:01.150 --> 03:19:01.160 align:start position:0%
review the deal I want to ask questions
 
03:19:02.870 --> 03:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
about the deal and if I didn't think it
 
03:19:04.550 --> 03:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
was the right thing to do I wouldn't
 
03:19:06.510 --> 03:19:06.520 align:start position:0%
sign it regardless of the law you could
 
03:19:08.229 --> 03:19:08.239 align:start position:0%
take kick me off the commission but I'm
 
03:19:10.189 --> 03:19:10.199 align:start position:0%
not signing a deal that I think is wrong
 
03:19:11.870 --> 03:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
and I don't think it's right to impose
 
03:19:14.469 --> 03:19:14.479 align:start position:0%
that on any pu commissioner they should
 
03:19:16.870 --> 03:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
have the ability to adjudicate something
 
03:19:18.750 --> 03:19:18.760 align:start position:0%
in front of them obviously take a strong
 
03:19:20.710 --> 03:19:20.720 align:start position:0%
recommendation if all parties are
 
03:19:22.910 --> 03:19:22.920 align:start position:0%
involved but all parties involved don't
 
03:19:24.269 --> 03:19:24.279 align:start position:0%
have the authority and the
 
03:19:27.630 --> 03:19:27.640 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the Pu to set
 
03:19:30.830 --> 03:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
policy further comment representative
 
03:19:33.950 --> 03:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
rolds thank you Mr chairman well I don't
 
03:19:35.389 --> 03:19:35.399 align:start position:0%
I don't agree with the
 
03:19:37.710 --> 03:19:37.720 align:start position:0%
interpretation uh
 
03:19:40.510 --> 03:19:40.520 align:start position:0%
that this language would
 
03:19:43.990 --> 03:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
be tying the hands of the Pu so
 
03:19:47.830 --> 03:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
strictly uh as representative her just
 
03:19:50.469 --> 03:19:50.479 align:start position:0%
described rather what I I what I feel is
 
03:19:52.630 --> 03:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
that in light of the testimony we heard
 
03:19:55.910 --> 03:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
yesterday that passing this bill would
 
03:19:59.429 --> 03:19:59.439 align:start position:0%
be sending a an important
 
03:20:01.590 --> 03:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
message well it would be making an
 
03:20:03.630 --> 03:20:03.640 align:start position:0%
important law which would be carrying an
 
03:20:06.269 --> 03:20:06.279 align:start position:0%
important message and making a statement
 
03:20:09.910 --> 03:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
that the legislature wants the Pu to
 
03:20:11.950 --> 03:20:11.960 align:start position:0%
abide by the division of
 
03:20:14.670 --> 03:20:14.680 align:start position:0%
responsibilities that were put in place
 
03:20:17.269 --> 03:20:17.279 align:start position:0%
several years ago between
 
03:20:19.550 --> 03:20:19.560 align:start position:0%
an administrative
 
03:20:22.349 --> 03:20:22.359 align:start position:0%
body and the policymaking body of the
 
03:20:24.309 --> 03:20:24.319 align:start position:0%
Department of energy we've heard and
 
03:20:27.830 --> 03:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
we've seen that the Pu is continually
 
03:20:30.349 --> 03:20:30.359 align:start position:0%
straying out of its Lane and attempting
 
03:20:34.510 --> 03:20:34.520 align:start position:0%
to insert itself re reinsert itself uh
 
03:20:38.910 --> 03:20:38.920 align:start position:0%
into the policymaking decisions by you
 
03:20:42.150 --> 03:20:42.160 align:start position:0%
know refusing to approve settlements I
 
03:20:44.550 --> 03:20:44.560 align:start position:0%
mean the consumer Advocates said the
 
03:20:47.590 --> 03:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
ratemaking process is broken
 
03:20:49.550 --> 03:20:49.560 align:start position:0%
that's pretty strong
 
03:20:53.269 --> 03:20:53.279 align:start position:0%
stuff um so I I think that this is an
 
03:20:57.110 --> 03:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
essential statement by the
 
03:20:59.590 --> 03:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
legislature it was a strong statement by
 
03:21:02.110 --> 03:21:02.120 align:start position:0%
the OCA but it wasn't necessarily a
 
03:21:02.120 --> 03:21:04.670 align:start position:0%
the OCA but it wasn't necessarily a
correct

03:21:04.670 --> 03:21:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:07.189 --> 03:21:07.199 align:start position:0%
statement further discussion
 
03:21:07.199 --> 03:21:08.710 align:start position:0%
statement further discussion
representative

03:21:08.710 --> 03:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:21:11.150 --> 03:21:11.160 align:start position:0%
Swanson thank you Mr chair I believe
 
03:21:13.550 --> 03:21:13.560 align:start position:0%
that there is evidence of existing
 
03:21:16.630 --> 03:21:16.640 align:start position:0%
friction uh with the doe and the Pu and
 
03:21:20.349 --> 03:21:20.359 align:start position:0%
and I do believe that this does make a
 
03:21:23.790 --> 03:21:23.800 align:start position:0%
step toward improving clarification or
 
03:21:27.030 --> 03:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
definition of the processes and roles
 
03:21:30.070 --> 03:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
and responsibilities and does not open
 
03:21:31.990 --> 03:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
the door for
 
03:21:33.790 --> 03:21:33.800 align:start position:0%
abuse thank
 
03:21:37.229 --> 03:21:37.239 align:start position:0%
you why take that chance further
 
03:21:39.630 --> 03:21:39.640 align:start position:0%
discussion representative McGee thank
 
03:21:43.030 --> 03:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair so um again looking to the
 
03:21:45.269 --> 03:21:45.279 align:start position:0%
bill and on a number of different lines
 
03:21:49.269 --> 03:21:49.279 align:start position:0%
I noticed that under various sections of
 
03:21:52.070 --> 03:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
365 the section on inspections on
 
03:21:56.030 --> 03:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
authority to inspect um under
 
03:21:59.750 --> 03:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
the I guess the extent of power to amend
 
03:22:02.630 --> 03:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
the there were a number of places I read
 
03:22:05.349 --> 03:22:05.359 align:start position:0%
the original 80 pages that constituted
 
03:22:06.870 --> 03:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
the department of energy when we didn't
 
03:22:09.030 --> 03:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
have a department of energy for several
 
03:22:12.469 --> 03:22:12.479 align:start position:0%
years and it struck me at the time
 
03:22:13.910 --> 03:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
because I had done organizational
 
03:22:16.670 --> 03:22:16.680 align:start position:0%
development in my career that there was
 
03:22:18.910 --> 03:22:18.920 align:start position:0%
a real lack of clarity about who was
 
03:22:21.150 --> 03:22:21.160 align:start position:0%
doing what and that it could cause
 
03:22:22.630 --> 03:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
problems in the future and I actually
 
03:22:24.189 --> 03:22:24.199 align:start position:0%
mentioned it I remember at the time to
 
03:22:26.590 --> 03:22:26.600 align:start position:0%
the consumer Advocate who was you know
 
03:22:27.950 --> 03:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
going along and saying this is going to
 
03:22:29.630 --> 03:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
be great and I'm like yeah but I don't I
 
03:22:31.950 --> 03:22:31.960 align:start position:0%
think this is really blurry this bill
 
03:22:34.910 --> 03:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
attempts to actually clarify what the
 
03:22:39.269 --> 03:22:39.279 align:start position:0%
doe should be um responding to and
 
03:22:41.990 --> 03:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
answering so it actually goes you know
 
03:22:44.429 --> 03:22:44.439 align:start position:0%
to the place of trying to
 
03:22:46.990 --> 03:22:47.000 align:start position:0%
say uh
 
03:22:49.910 --> 03:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
this is how it actually works in in in
 
03:22:52.830 --> 03:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
operation um between the two now that we
 
03:22:55.429 --> 03:22:55.439 align:start position:0%
have two functioning uh departments to
 
03:22:57.469 --> 03:22:57.479 align:start position:0%
look to look at in terms of how they're
 
03:23:00.790 --> 03:23:00.800 align:start position:0%
operating so it it goes to
 
03:23:04.630 --> 03:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
the uh lengths of trying to eliminate
 
03:23:06.349 --> 03:23:06.359 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission in
 
03:23:08.110 --> 03:23:08.120 align:start position:0%
places where it says Department of
 
03:23:09.830 --> 03:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
energy and Public Utilities Commission
 
03:23:12.790 --> 03:23:12.800 align:start position:0%
so it it confuses the fact of who's
 
03:23:15.710 --> 03:23:15.720 align:start position:0%
doing what and that is perhaps why the
 
03:23:18.150 --> 03:23:18.160 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission is concerned
 
03:23:20.070 --> 03:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
that it needs to do some of the things
 
03:23:21.630 --> 03:23:21.640 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't need to do anymore
 
03:23:22.710 --> 03:23:22.720 align:start position:0%
because we now have a department of
 
03:23:24.990 --> 03:23:25.000 align:start position:0%
energy which we didn't have for several
 
03:23:26.389 --> 03:23:26.399 align:start position:0%
years before
 
03:23:28.670 --> 03:23:28.680 align:start position:0%
then so I think it's I think it's
 
03:23:30.750 --> 03:23:30.760 align:start position:0%
actually a good clarification and I
 
03:23:35.389 --> 03:23:35.399 align:start position:0%
don't see any danger here um in the Pu
 
03:23:36.950 --> 03:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
not being able
 
03:23:39.389 --> 03:23:39.399 align:start position:0%
to perform all of the things that they
 
03:23:42.150 --> 03:23:42.160 align:start position:0%
do currently as an adjudicator of these
 
03:23:44.870 --> 03:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
cases I I do take the point that if if
 
03:23:47.309 --> 03:23:47.319 align:start position:0%
it's an uncontested case
 
03:23:50.030 --> 03:23:50.040 align:start position:0%
um you know the concern is well if
 
03:23:51.590 --> 03:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
everybody here agrees what if I don't
 
03:23:53.870 --> 03:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
agree and it I think that the Public
 
03:23:56.990 --> 03:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission is not a party to
 
03:23:58.429 --> 03:23:58.439 align:start position:0%
the agreement right they are the
 
03:24:00.189 --> 03:24:00.199 align:start position:0%
adjudicator to see is it a reasonable
 
03:24:02.830 --> 03:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
thing so they still get to get all of
 
03:24:05.469 --> 03:24:05.479 align:start position:0%
what they need answered but if they're
 
03:24:07.150 --> 03:24:07.160 align:start position:0%
coming to a different conclusion than
 
03:24:09.750 --> 03:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
everyone whose party I would question
 
03:24:12.229 --> 03:24:12.239 align:start position:0%
how that how that
 
03:24:15.510 --> 03:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
occurs what are they what are they
 
03:24:18.189 --> 03:24:18.199 align:start position:0%
receiving for information that isn't um
 
03:24:20.189 --> 03:24:20.199 align:start position:0%
part of the
 
03:24:22.070 --> 03:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
adjudication well you have to remember
 
03:24:25.429 --> 03:24:25.439 align:start position:0%
the puc has about six or seven lawyers
 
03:24:27.309 --> 03:24:27.319 align:start position:0%
on their staff and they
 
03:24:30.349 --> 03:24:30.359 align:start position:0%
constantly pour through and comb through
 
03:24:30.359 --> 03:24:31.349 align:start position:0%
constantly pour through and comb through
the

03:24:31.349 --> 03:24:31.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:24:34.910 --> 03:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
rsas to make sure that every decision
 
03:24:37.630 --> 03:24:37.640 align:start position:0%
they make conforms with state
 
03:24:41.150 --> 03:24:41.160 align:start position:0%
law representative Corman thank you so
 
03:24:42.870 --> 03:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
far all the objections I've heard I
 
03:24:46.990 --> 03:24:47.000 align:start position:0%
think are to section five of the bill
 
03:24:48.750 --> 03:24:48.760 align:start position:0%
are there objections to parts of the
 
03:24:56.070 --> 03:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:59.229 --> 03:24:59.239 align:start position:0%
five I personally object the entire bill
 
03:25:01.389 --> 03:25:01.399 align:start position:0%
because nobody asked for it except the
 
03:25:03.630 --> 03:25:03.640 align:start position:0%
OCA there's
 
03:25:07.550 --> 03:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
no you know demonstrated reason why we
 
03:25:11.150 --> 03:25:11.160 align:start position:0%
need this bill that's that's my main
 
03:25:13.590 --> 03:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
issue with this bill especially given
 
03:25:16.309 --> 03:25:16.319 align:start position:0%
the fact that it gives it ties to people
 
03:25:19.229 --> 03:25:19.239 align:start position:0%
pu's hands with regards to settlement
 
03:25:21.189 --> 03:25:21.199 align:start position:0%
agreements I just don't think that's a
 
03:25:23.550 --> 03:25:23.560 align:start position:0%
good idea and I don't think we should
 
03:25:25.790 --> 03:25:25.800 align:start position:0%
move forward with the bill it seems to
 
03:25:27.630 --> 03:25:27.640 align:start position:0%
me that what we heard yesterday morning
 
03:25:30.750 --> 03:25:30.760 align:start position:0%
was good evidence that we need this bill
 
03:25:32.950 --> 03:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
there's this turf war between doe and
 
03:25:37.790 --> 03:25:37.800 align:start position:0%
the Pu and this bill tries to
 
03:25:40.910 --> 03:25:40.920 align:start position:0%
clarify the divisions between the Pu and
 
03:25:40.920 --> 03:25:42.870 align:start position:0%
clarify the divisions between the Pu and
the

03:25:42.870 --> 03:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:25:45.510 --> 03:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
doe and the reason I asked about any
 
03:25:47.429 --> 03:25:47.439 align:start position:0%
objections other than section five I
 
03:25:49.950 --> 03:25:49.960 align:start position:0%
mean I would consider an amendment that
 
03:25:52.670 --> 03:25:52.680 align:start position:0%
removes that section and the supporting
 
03:25:55.349 --> 03:25:55.359 align:start position:0%
text and the findings just if for no
 
03:25:57.990 --> 03:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
other reason than to clarify the
 
03:26:01.750 --> 03:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:05.469 --> 03:26:05.479 align:start position:0%
pu seems to me that statute already def
 
03:26:07.910 --> 03:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
defines the difference between the
 
03:26:11.750 --> 03:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
two any further discussion seeing none
 
03:26:13.349 --> 03:26:13.359 align:start position:0%
I'd ask the clerk to call the role in
 
03:26:18.469 --> 03:26:18.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:23.429 --> 03:26:23.439 align:start position:0%

Report by 7 am tomorrow
 
03:27:28.790 --> 03:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
morning all right so we're done with
 
03:27:31.309 --> 03:27:31.319 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
03:27:31.319 --> 03:27:32.870 align:start position:0%
House Bill
535

03:27:32.870 --> 03:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
535
 
03:27:35.630 --> 03:27:35.640 align:start position:0%
and I am still tracking down the
 
03:27:39.269 --> 03:27:39.279 align:start position:0%
amendment Amendment on House
 
03:27:55.189 --> 03:27:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:59.110 --> 03:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
so while we continue to wait for this
 
03:28:01.510 --> 03:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
bill to this amendment to show up we'll
 
03:28:04.710 --> 03:28:04.720 align:start position:0%
open a public I mean an executive
 
03:28:07.990 --> 03:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill
 
03:28:11.070 --> 03:28:11.080 align:start position:0%
599 establishing a committee to examine
 
03:28:14.349 --> 03:28:14.359 align:start position:0%
weatherization initiatives for homes in
 
03:28:16.710 --> 03:28:16.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I will make a motion
 
03:28:19.469 --> 03:28:19.479 align:start position:0%
of itl for this bill and recognize
 
03:28:23.269 --> 03:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
representative Vice chair Thomas second
 
03:28:27.269 --> 03:28:27.279 align:start position:0%
moved in seconded that we itl this bill
 
03:28:29.389 --> 03:28:29.399 align:start position:0%
the reason I make this motion is because
 
03:28:33.309 --> 03:28:33.319 align:start position:0%
weatherization is a well understood
 
03:28:35.309 --> 03:28:35.319 align:start position:0%
topic we
 
03:28:37.990 --> 03:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
have in the 11 years I've been in the
 
03:28:40.110 --> 03:28:40.120 align:start position:0%
legislature we've seen probably six or
 
03:28:43.670 --> 03:28:43.680 align:start position:0%
seven bills similar to this one and they
 
03:28:46.469 --> 03:28:46.479 align:start position:0%
never go anywhere because the Department
 
03:28:49.189 --> 03:28:49.199 align:start position:0%
of energy has good command of the
 
03:28:51.469 --> 03:28:51.479 align:start position:0%
weatherization programs that exist in
 
03:28:54.790 --> 03:28:54.800 align:start position:0%
the state as to the utilities with New
 
03:28:57.750 --> 03:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire saves and I don't see anything
 
03:29:02.110 --> 03:29:02.120 align:start position:0%
to be gained by doing another study
 
03:29:04.590 --> 03:29:04.600 align:start position:0%
committee report on a topic that's
 
03:29:07.670 --> 03:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
already well understood so for that
 
03:29:10.309 --> 03:29:10.319 align:start position:0%
reason I think we should just itl this
 
03:29:13.550 --> 03:29:13.560 align:start position:0%
bill further comments representative
 
03:29:15.670 --> 03:29:15.680 align:start position:0%
Harrington yeah a couple of quick things
 
03:29:17.630 --> 03:29:17.640 align:start position:0%
I mean one thing is sort of like what I
 
03:29:19.429 --> 03:29:19.439 align:start position:0%
consider almost a silly line in the Bill
 
03:29:21.469 --> 03:29:21.479 align:start position:0%
about the someone's supposed to be able
 
03:29:24.429 --> 03:29:24.439 align:start position:0%
to get assess the uh status of every
 
03:29:26.189 --> 03:29:26.199 align:start position:0%
house in New Hampshire as far as how
 
03:29:28.269 --> 03:29:28.279 align:start position:0%
well it's insulated I mean I don't know
 
03:29:29.389 --> 03:29:29.399 align:start position:0%
who's going to do that or how that's
 
03:29:30.950 --> 03:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
going to be done certainly anyone on
 
03:29:33.309 --> 03:29:33.319 align:start position:0%
this commission better spend on and
 
03:29:36.070 --> 03:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
spend 247 working on it because it'll
 
03:29:37.469 --> 03:29:37.479 align:start position:0%
take them that long for months in order
 
03:29:39.630 --> 03:29:39.640 align:start position:0%
to come up with that but secondly this
 
03:29:41.309 --> 03:29:41.319 align:start position:0%
isn't necessary I mean just think about
 
03:29:42.590 --> 03:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
it every month you get your electric
 
03:29:44.110 --> 03:29:44.120 align:start position:0%
bill you open it up what do you get in
 
03:29:46.269 --> 03:29:46.279 align:start position:0%
there New Hampshire saves go here here's
 
03:29:48.389 --> 03:29:48.399 align:start position:0%
the website you want a free energy audit
 
03:29:50.189 --> 03:29:50.199 align:start position:0%
here's where you go we've got a good
 
03:29:51.590 --> 03:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
program it's working we don't need
 
03:29:53.590 --> 03:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
another study committee to conclude that
 
03:29:56.630 --> 03:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
we've got a good program and it's
 
03:29:59.229 --> 03:29:59.239 align:start position:0%
working representative
 
03:30:01.870 --> 03:30:01.880 align:start position:0%
Kaplan yeah I will be uh opposing the
 
03:30:05.469 --> 03:30:05.479 align:start position:0%
itl motion um I agree the New Hampshire
 
03:30:08.429 --> 03:30:08.439 align:start position:0%
saves is an excellent program um but we
 
03:30:10.670 --> 03:30:10.680 align:start position:0%
really do not have an understanding of
 
03:30:12.670 --> 03:30:12.680 align:start position:0%
the housing stock overall in the state
 
03:30:15.510 --> 03:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
and we really need to assess the Need
 
03:30:18.070 --> 03:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
For What ization on an overall basis and
 
03:30:19.830 --> 03:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
not wait for people to approach New
 
03:30:21.950 --> 03:30:21.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire saves on an individual level
 
03:30:23.830 --> 03:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
to try to get what help they deserve we
 
03:30:26.030 --> 03:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
have a housing crisis in this state and
 
03:30:27.870 --> 03:30:27.880 align:start position:0%
and especially an affordability crisis
 
03:30:30.030 --> 03:30:30.040 align:start position:0%
and that's been acknowledged by all all
 
03:30:32.389 --> 03:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
parties including our governor and uh
 
03:30:34.110 --> 03:30:34.120 align:start position:0%
it's a bottleneck on our state's
 
03:30:35.870 --> 03:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
Economic Development we can't attract
 
03:30:37.510 --> 03:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
young Working Families because we don't
 
03:30:38.950 --> 03:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
have enough houses and the houses that
 
03:30:40.950 --> 03:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
we do have are unaffordable part of the
 
03:30:42.429 --> 03:30:42.439 align:start position:0%
reason they're unaffordable is because
 
03:30:44.269 --> 03:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
they're not weatherized we don't have an
 
03:30:46.790 --> 03:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
overall picture of the housing stock and
 
03:30:49.030 --> 03:30:49.040 align:start position:0%
the need for such programs in our state
 
03:30:51.189 --> 03:30:51.199 align:start position:0%
so I think it's strategic it's Forward
 
03:30:53.830 --> 03:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
Thinking and it's uh it's an economic
 
03:30:55.590 --> 03:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
necessity for us to have that
 
03:30:57.790 --> 03:30:57.800 align:start position:0%
information so that we can craft
 
03:31:00.670 --> 03:31:00.680 align:start position:0%
programs and improve uh the reach of
 
03:31:02.910 --> 03:31:02.920 align:start position:0%
weatherization yes it's well understood
 
03:31:04.750 --> 03:31:04.760 align:start position:0%
the benefits are very well understood
 
03:31:06.710 --> 03:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
but what we don't understand is the need
 
03:31:09.670 --> 03:31:09.680 align:start position:0%
for such programs in our state so that's
 
03:31:13.469 --> 03:31:13.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:17.750 --> 03:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
forward representative um yeah Thomas
 
03:31:21.510 --> 03:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
Wendy Thomas thank you um
 
03:31:24.150 --> 03:31:24.160 align:start position:0%
uh I agree with with everything
 
03:31:26.750 --> 03:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan just said the best
 
03:31:29.510 --> 03:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
way that we can help our constituents
 
03:31:33.630 --> 03:31:33.640 align:start position:0%
save energy money is through um adequate
 
03:31:35.990 --> 03:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
insulation um and one of the things I
 
03:31:38.309 --> 03:31:38.319 align:start position:0%
asked the prime sponsor about was um
 
03:31:41.790 --> 03:31:41.800 align:start position:0%
would this include education and that is
 
03:31:44.670 --> 03:31:44.680 align:start position:0%
the key thing um because it's not just
 
03:31:46.349 --> 03:31:46.359 align:start position:0%
the people that get El
 
03:31:52.150 --> 03:31:52.160 align:start position:0%
oh I beg your pardon um I it is not the
 
03:31:54.990 --> 03:31:55.000 align:start position:0%
people that that get the bills it's it's
 
03:31:56.950 --> 03:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
it's everyone and they need to
 
03:31:58.229 --> 03:31:58.239 align:start position:0%
understand the importance of
 
03:32:01.510 --> 03:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
weatherization and how it can help them
 
03:32:06.269 --> 03:32:06.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:10.469 --> 03:32:10.479 align:start position:0%
money okay representative McGee thank
 
03:32:13.189 --> 03:32:13.199 align:start position:0%
you Mr current chairman you can't get
 
03:32:14.349 --> 03:32:14.359 align:start position:0%
away from me I know you were hoping I
 
03:32:16.550 --> 03:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't put my hand up but I
 
03:32:18.429 --> 03:32:18.439 align:start position:0%
so when we were having the hearing on
 
03:32:21.710 --> 03:32:21.720 align:start position:0%
this bill um I mentioned to
 
03:32:26.030 --> 03:32:26.040 align:start position:0%
representative Howard that um there is a
 
03:32:28.510 --> 03:32:28.520 align:start position:0%
group that uh used to participate in the
 
03:32:30.269 --> 03:32:30.279 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency and sustainable energy
 
03:32:31.670 --> 03:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
board called
 
03:32:34.950 --> 03:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
GDs um one of their principles Matt cisa
 
03:32:37.590 --> 03:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
had reached out to me on this bill HB
 
03:32:40.670 --> 03:32:40.680 align:start position:0%
599 and he said are you aware that we
 
03:32:44.269 --> 03:32:44.279 align:start position:0%
have a monthly meeting that includes all
 
03:32:46.510 --> 03:32:46.520 align:start position:0%
the stakeholders around weatherization
 
03:32:48.429 --> 03:32:48.439 align:start position:0%
including contractors you know small
 
03:32:53.349 --> 03:32:53.359 align:start position:0%
business owners um agencies and the
 
03:32:56.990 --> 03:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
utilities and he said that the topics
 
03:33:00.070 --> 03:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
that they are covering including what
 
03:33:01.790 --> 03:33:01.800 align:start position:0%
kind of Workforce do we have to do
 
03:33:04.150 --> 03:33:04.160 align:start position:0%
weatherization work in New Hampshire you
 
03:33:07.070 --> 03:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
know the the the very things that this
 
03:33:09.349 --> 03:33:09.359 align:start position:0%
bill contemplates he was he said you
 
03:33:11.110 --> 03:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
know we could be a resource to these
 
03:33:13.510 --> 03:33:13.520 align:start position:0%
folks if you constitute a committee on
 
03:33:16.349 --> 03:33:16.359 align:start position:0%
this and so I don't think I you know
 
03:33:18.790 --> 03:33:18.800 align:start position:0%
said a lot about it in the hearing or
 
03:33:20.750 --> 03:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
you know made a very good case for it
 
03:33:23.550 --> 03:33:23.560 align:start position:0%
but basically their interest was we
 
03:33:25.510 --> 03:33:25.520 align:start position:0%
would love it if the legislature would
 
03:33:26.950 --> 03:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
actually take a look at the housing
 
03:33:29.070 --> 03:33:29.080 align:start position:0%
stock in New Hampshire we have a lot
 
03:33:31.469 --> 03:33:31.479 align:start position:0%
that we could offer in terms of making
 
03:33:33.950 --> 03:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
them understand better where we're at in
 
03:33:36.389 --> 03:33:36.399 align:start position:0%
terms of penetration for making the
 
03:33:39.790 --> 03:33:39.800 align:start position:0%
housing stock more um More Energy
 
03:33:42.469 --> 03:33:42.479 align:start position:0%
Efficiency and again that lowers that
 
03:33:44.429 --> 03:33:44.439 align:start position:0%
that creates negawatts that's what
 
03:33:46.269 --> 03:33:46.279 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency does Nega what is the
 
03:33:49.349 --> 03:33:49.359 align:start position:0%
energy you no longer use and the more of
 
03:33:51.630 --> 03:33:51.640 align:start position:0%
that that we can build up the better A
 
03:33:54.910 --> 03:33:54.920 align:start position:0%
system that we have in terms of
 
03:33:57.710 --> 03:33:57.720 align:start position:0%
Independence representative
 
03:34:01.469 --> 03:34:01.479 align:start position:0%
Bernardi thank you Mr chairman so uh
 
03:34:03.590 --> 03:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
this argument about establishing a
 
03:34:05.269 --> 03:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
committee is
 
03:34:08.550 --> 03:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
another argument for a government
 
03:34:12.950 --> 03:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
oversight of a industry that is
 
03:34:12.960 --> 03:34:14.469 align:start position:0%
oversight of a industry that is
functioning

03:34:14.469 --> 03:34:14.479 align:start position:0%
functioning
 
03:34:17.790 --> 03:34:17.800 align:start position:0%
and to to me this is antithetical to the
 
03:34:22.349 --> 03:34:22.359 align:start position:0%
entire concept of free enterprise if
 
03:34:25.429 --> 03:34:25.439 align:start position:0%
there is a need and then there may be a
 
03:34:28.950 --> 03:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
need for insulation weatherization
 
03:34:33.189 --> 03:34:33.199 align:start position:0%
whatever that need is known by those who
 
03:34:35.750 --> 03:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
experience it and they will use their
 
03:34:39.670 --> 03:34:39.680 align:start position:0%
resources if they have them in advancing
 
03:34:41.950 --> 03:34:41.960 align:start position:0%
dealing with that need we don't need a
 
03:34:45.070 --> 03:34:45.080 align:start position:0%
government program to Define people's
 
03:34:45.080 --> 03:34:48.269 align:start position:0%
government program to Define people's
needs

03:34:48.269 --> 03:34:48.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:48.279 --> 03:34:49.910 align:start position:0%
 
further

03:34:49.910 --> 03:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
further
 
03:34:53.269 --> 03:34:53.279 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
03:34:55.990 --> 03:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
parial um at first I was in agreement
 
03:34:58.389 --> 03:34:58.399 align:start position:0%
that we don't need another committee but
 
03:35:00.110 --> 03:35:00.120 align:start position:0%
upon hearing some of the espe in
 
03:35:02.990 --> 03:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
particular um what representative uh Mia
 
03:35:05.229 --> 03:35:05.239 align:start position:0%
has to say about resources that are
 
03:35:07.670 --> 03:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
available in the community I think if we
 
03:35:09.229 --> 03:35:09.239 align:start position:0%
want to improve our housing stock which
 
03:35:11.469 --> 03:35:11.479 align:start position:0%
we IND desperate need of improving maybe
 
03:35:13.590 --> 03:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
a fresh set of eyes maybe an order in a
 
03:35:16.510 --> 03:35:16.520 align:start position:0%
case like this I will be voting for
 
03:35:19.349 --> 03:35:19.359 align:start position:0%
Bill further discussion representative
 
03:35:22.590 --> 03:35:22.600 align:start position:0%
reels thank you Mr chairman um while I
 
03:35:25.910 --> 03:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
while I do agree with uh some of the
 
03:35:28.309 --> 03:35:28.319 align:start position:0%
sentiments expressed
 
03:35:30.910 --> 03:35:30.920 align:start position:0%
uh against the bill
 
03:35:30.920 --> 03:35:33.030 align:start position:0%
uh against the bill
um

03:35:33.030 --> 03:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:36.229 --> 03:35:36.239 align:start position:0%
I think that the what is what is asked
 
03:35:37.830 --> 03:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
for by this bill what would happen under
 
03:35:41.630 --> 03:35:41.640 align:start position:0%
this bill is a really small effort uh
 
03:35:43.469 --> 03:35:43.479 align:start position:0%
with as near as I can tell the cost of
 
03:35:45.630 --> 03:35:45.640 align:start position:0%
four people getting mileage
 
03:35:47.510 --> 03:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
reimbursement to meet a few
 
03:35:50.670 --> 03:35:50.680 align:start position:0%
times uh I think that the government
 
03:35:52.550 --> 03:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
could play an important you know
 
03:35:55.990 --> 03:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
convening role here
 
03:36:00.070 --> 03:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
um and information gathering role more
 
03:36:03.229 --> 03:36:03.239 align:start position:0%
than any anything
 
03:36:06.990 --> 03:36:07.000 align:start position:0%
um yes about the existing resources
 
03:36:09.790 --> 03:36:09.800 align:start position:0%
existing programs at our doe and our New
 
03:36:12.030 --> 03:36:12.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire saves but you know the New
 
03:36:14.349 --> 03:36:14.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire financing Authority has other
 
03:36:16.910 --> 03:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
things uh it just could be an import a
 
03:36:19.070 --> 03:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
valuable convening of
 
03:36:23.550 --> 03:36:23.560 align:start position:0%
Minds um sort of assessing uh you know
 
03:36:26.150 --> 03:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
the current reach current effectiveness
 
03:36:29.030 --> 03:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
of of weatherization efforts and
 
03:36:31.910 --> 03:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
identifying maybe some gaps and some
 
03:36:35.030 --> 03:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
ways that things might be improved uh
 
03:36:38.110 --> 03:36:38.120 align:start position:0%
improved uh use of those existing
 
03:36:40.870 --> 03:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
resources so I think it's a small ask
 
03:36:43.550 --> 03:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
and I would ask my my colleagues all of
 
03:36:45.790 --> 03:36:45.800 align:start position:0%
us to to just uh I don't think there's a
 
03:36:47.030 --> 03:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
lot of harm in supporting it and some
 
03:36:49.550 --> 03:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
good things could come out of it thanks
 
03:36:52.070 --> 03:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
okay Vice chair Thomas thank you Mr
 
03:36:55.950 --> 03:36:55.960 align:start position:0%
chair um I you know weatherization as uh
 
03:36:57.309 --> 03:36:57.319 align:start position:0%
some of my previous colleagues have
 
03:37:00.429 --> 03:37:00.439 align:start position:0%
stated is a a well-known phenomenon it's
 
03:37:02.670 --> 03:37:02.680 align:start position:0%
been studied over and over again I see
 
03:37:07.110 --> 03:37:07.120 align:start position:0%
no read to to spend uh money and time uh
 
03:37:10.630 --> 03:37:10.640 align:start position:0%
to study it again uh information is out
 
03:37:13.510 --> 03:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
there uh this would be no more effective
 
03:37:16.070 --> 03:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
in study than if we uh want to do a
 
03:37:18.710 --> 03:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
study of why uh people shouldn't smoke
 
03:37:22.110 --> 03:37:22.120 align:start position:0%
in restaurants I mean we all know what's
 
03:37:24.910 --> 03:37:24.920 align:start position:0%
uh what's out there and the education
 
03:37:27.550 --> 03:37:27.560 align:start position:0%
issue again it's on your electric bill
 
03:37:29.510 --> 03:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
people know about it and if you're not
 
03:37:31.830 --> 03:37:31.840 align:start position:0%
getting an electric bill you're not
 
03:37:35.469 --> 03:37:35.479 align:start position:0%
paying for your power um and so I this
 
03:37:41.030 --> 03:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
is just to me uh a good intention by uh
 
03:37:44.070 --> 03:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
a person that was well intended but U
 
03:37:47.269 --> 03:37:47.279 align:start position:0%
we've done it and so there for I will be
 
03:37:49.030 --> 03:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
supporting the it
 
03:37:51.790 --> 03:37:51.800 align:start position:0%
motion okay so seeing no further
 
03:37:53.469 --> 03:37:53.479 align:start position:0%
comments I'd ask the clerk to call the
 
03:37:55.110 --> 03:37:55.120 align:start position:0%
role on the question of the motion of
 
03:37:59.630 --> 03:37:59.640 align:start position:0%

03:39:06.630 --> 03:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
a.m. tomorrow okay with that we'll close
 
03:39:09.070 --> 03:39:09.080 align:start position:0%
the exact session on House Bill
 
03:39:12.389 --> 03:39:12.399 align:start position:0%
599 and now we're down to the last bill
 
03:39:12.399 --> 03:39:13.950 align:start position:0%
599 and now we're down to the last bill
which

03:39:13.950 --> 03:39:13.960 align:start position:0%
which
 
03:39:19.110 --> 03:39:19.120 align:start position:0%
is house bill 710 exec session I move
 
03:39:19.120 --> 03:39:19.830 align:start position:0%
is house bill 710 exec session I move
the

03:39:19.830 --> 03:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:39:22.189 --> 03:39:22.199 align:start position:0%
adoption of House Bill
 
03:39:24.070 --> 03:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
710 with
 
03:39:27.670 --> 03:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
Amendment 2025
 
03:39:27.680 --> 03:39:29.229 align:start position:0%
Amendment 2025
0716

03:39:29.229 --> 03:39:29.239 align:start position:0%
0716
 
03:39:33.189 --> 03:39:33.199 align:start position:0%
H and I recognize Vice chair Thomas
 
03:39:35.870 --> 03:39:35.880 align:start position:0%
second moved and seconded that
 
03:39:40.189 --> 03:39:40.199 align:start position:0%
we adopt House Bill 710 as amended by
 
03:39:40.199 --> 03:39:41.950 align:start position:0%
we adopt House Bill 710 as amended by
Amendment

03:39:41.950 --> 03:39:41.960 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
03:39:41.960 --> 03:39:43.950 align:start position:0%
Amendment
0716

03:39:43.950 --> 03:39:43.960 align:start position:0%
0716
 
03:39:49.269 --> 03:39:49.279 align:start position:0%
H so there are four changes that this in
 
03:39:53.229 --> 03:39:53.239 align:start position:0%
Amendment introduced three of them
 
03:39:58.510 --> 03:39:58.520 align:start position:0%
are Corrections or or typos in line six
 
03:40:02.870 --> 03:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
sodium cooled is now sodium Dash
 
03:40:04.910 --> 03:40:04.920 align:start position:0%
cooled that's a
 
03:40:08.429 --> 03:40:08.439 align:start position:0%
biggie and in
 
03:40:08.439 --> 03:40:12.950 align:start position:0%
biggie and in
line

03:40:12.950 --> 03:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:17.910 --> 03:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:24.269 --> 03:40:24.279 align:start position:0%
it's line 10 right the the uh RSA 374 G
 
03:40:27.870 --> 03:40:27.880 align:start position:0%
was changed to F that was just a
 
03:40:33.269 --> 03:40:33.279 align:start position:0%
typo and then on line 21 the date June
 
03:40:38.070 --> 03:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
30th of 2035 was changed to
 
03:40:40.990 --> 03:40:41.000 align:start position:0%
2036 and then the fourth change is the
 
03:40:43.550 --> 03:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
line that was in the amendment that we
 
03:40:45.389 --> 03:40:45.399 align:start position:0%
were looking at this morning that
 
03:40:49.630 --> 03:40:49.640 align:start position:0%
allowed the department of energy to
 
03:40:52.870 --> 03:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
authorize rfps that line has been
 
03:40:55.469 --> 03:40:55.479 align:start position:0%
removed entirely since that was a
 
03:40:59.389 --> 03:40:59.399 align:start position:0%
significant policy change that
 
03:41:03.750 --> 03:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
um was probably outside the purview
 
03:41:06.349 --> 03:41:06.359 align:start position:0%
of of
 
03:41:10.030 --> 03:41:10.040 align:start position:0%
this piece of legislation so I remove
 
03:41:13.590 --> 03:41:13.600 align:start position:0%
that and other than that the this
 
03:41:15.510 --> 03:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
amendment is identical to the one we
 
03:41:18.189 --> 03:41:18.199 align:start position:0%
just discussed this morning so I hope
 
03:41:20.110 --> 03:41:20.120 align:start position:0%
you'll support this amendment I think
 
03:41:24.189 --> 03:41:24.199 align:start position:0%
this is a good way to signal to the rest
 
03:41:26.469 --> 03:41:26.479 align:start position:0%
of the country that New Hampshire is
 
03:41:27.990 --> 03:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
open for business when it comes to
 
03:41:31.630 --> 03:41:31.640 align:start position:0%
Advanced nuclear resources and
 
03:41:34.229 --> 03:41:34.239 align:start position:0%
that while this there's no
 
03:41:37.550 --> 03:41:37.560 align:start position:0%
guarantee that utilities will acquire
 
03:41:40.110 --> 03:41:40.120 align:start position:0%
any power from Advanced nuclear
 
03:41:42.469 --> 03:41:42.479 align:start position:0%
resources based on this bill at least
 
03:41:45.630 --> 03:41:45.640 align:start position:0%
there's an opportunity to do so so this
 
03:41:49.149 --> 03:41:49.159 align:start position:0%
is an enabling piece of legislation and
 
03:41:51.510 --> 03:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
it uses an existing piece of legislation
 
03:41:53.229 --> 03:41:53.239 align:start position:0%
which is well
 
03:41:56.630 --> 03:41:56.640 align:start position:0%
understood hasn't been used so we heard
 
03:41:59.149 --> 03:41:59.159 align:start position:0%
this morning from the doe but it could
 
03:42:02.229 --> 03:42:02.239 align:start position:0%
be used and so I think it's a a good
 
03:42:07.550 --> 03:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity for us as a state to signal
 
03:42:11.070 --> 03:42:11.080 align:start position:0%
that the source of future electricity is
 
03:42:12.710 --> 03:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
probably going to be nuclear in this
 
03:42:16.110 --> 03:42:16.120 align:start position:0%
country the major source and I think New
 
03:42:18.710 --> 03:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire needs to be at the Forefront
 
03:42:21.269 --> 03:42:21.279 align:start position:0%
of of States getting ready to adopt
 
03:42:24.469 --> 03:42:24.479 align:start position:0%
nuclear energy so I hope you'll support
 
03:42:28.110 --> 03:42:28.120 align:start position:0%
this amendment and this bill and I'll
 
03:42:30.349 --> 03:42:30.359 align:start position:0%
entertain comments representative
 
03:42:34.590 --> 03:42:34.600 align:start position:0%
reels thank you Mr chairman uh yes I I
 
03:42:37.469 --> 03:42:37.479 align:start position:0%
appreciate your um changes to the to the
 
03:42:40.510 --> 03:42:40.520 align:start position:0%
bill and I think it's a a good bill I
 
03:42:42.309 --> 03:42:42.319 align:start position:0%
agree with what you said I I think a
 
03:42:44.189 --> 03:42:44.199 align:start position:0%
good way for us to describe what we're
 
03:42:45.630 --> 03:42:45.640 align:start position:0%
doing here is we're
 
03:42:48.590 --> 03:42:48.600 align:start position:0%
essentially authorizing our New
 
03:42:51.830 --> 03:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire distribution utilities to be
 
03:42:55.269 --> 03:42:55.279 align:start position:0%
uh to be the anchor tenant if you will
 
03:42:58.670 --> 03:42:58.680 align:start position:0%
uh for a uh Advanced nuclear reactor to
 
03:43:00.110 --> 03:43:00.120 align:start position:0%
be to be built here in the state and I
 
03:43:03.149 --> 03:43:03.159 align:start position:0%
think it's uh it's very forward-looking
 
03:43:05.189 --> 03:43:05.199 align:start position:0%
so Vice chair
 
03:43:08.030 --> 03:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you Mr chair um Mr chair
 
03:43:10.070 --> 03:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
along with this bill and the few others
 
03:43:11.790 --> 03:43:11.800 align:start position:0%
that we passed through this committee
 
03:43:14.550 --> 03:43:14.560 align:start position:0%
all involving uh the message that New
 
03:43:14.560 --> 03:43:15.710 align:start position:0%
all involving uh the message that New
Hampshire

03:43:15.710 --> 03:43:15.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:43:19.110 --> 03:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
uh is open to nuclear technology uh I
 
03:43:22.309 --> 03:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
think this um uh I think along with this
 
03:43:24.590 --> 03:43:24.600 align:start position:0%
bill I think people will see that New
 
03:43:27.990 --> 03:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is finally changing and wants
 
03:43:30.790 --> 03:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
to look at the prospects of possible
 
03:43:32.990 --> 03:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
nuclear energy in the state particularly
 
03:43:36.469 --> 03:43:36.479 align:start position:0%
small scale so I applaud this amendment
 
03:43:39.149 --> 03:43:39.159 align:start position:0%
I think this bill should be passed and I
 
03:43:40.870 --> 03:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
think this kind of puts the crowning
 
03:43:42.990 --> 03:43:43.000 align:start position:0%
achievement on the several bills that
 
03:43:45.710 --> 03:43:45.720 align:start position:0%
we've heard this year that all address
 
03:43:47.469 --> 03:43:47.479 align:start position:0%
the very same issue so I intend of
 
03:43:50.790 --> 03:43:50.800 align:start position:0%
course to support it representative
 
03:43:53.110 --> 03:43:53.120 align:start position:0%
Summers thank you Mr chairman and just
 
03:43:56.229 --> 03:43:56.239 align:start position:0%
to uh kind of like um steal a line from
 
03:43:59.950 --> 03:43:59.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:02.590 --> 03:44:02.600 align:start position:0%
it representative
 
03:44:05.110 --> 03:44:05.120 align:start position:0%
Harrington yeah thank you Mr chairman
 
03:44:06.469 --> 03:44:06.479 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure many of you already know
 
03:44:08.269 --> 03:44:08.279 align:start position:0%
this because you probably read nuclear
 
03:44:10.510 --> 03:44:10.520 align:start position:0%
news and nuclear News Daily like I do
 
03:44:14.349 --> 03:44:14.359 align:start position:0%
but um the um the battle is on across
 
03:44:15.630 --> 03:44:15.640 align:start position:0%
the country to
 
03:44:18.429 --> 03:44:18.439 align:start position:0%
for um uh different states so Texas is
 
03:44:22.030 --> 03:44:22.040 align:start position:0%
going all in 100% on attracting nuclear
 
03:44:24.269 --> 03:44:24.279 align:start position:0%
U the Ohio's done something there's
 
03:44:25.750 --> 03:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
there's six or seven other states that
 
03:44:27.910 --> 03:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
have either reversed their policy saying
 
03:44:29.269 --> 03:44:29.279 align:start position:0%
that there's no they didn't want any
 
03:44:30.950 --> 03:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
nuclear plants built and are now
 
03:44:33.389 --> 03:44:33.399 align:start position:0%
actively encouraging them to be built so
 
03:44:35.070 --> 03:44:35.080 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm not sure this is going to put
 
03:44:36.790 --> 03:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
us in first in first place but if we
 
03:44:38.149 --> 03:44:38.159 align:start position:0%
don't have something like this we'll be
 
03:44:39.790 --> 03:44:39.800 align:start position:0%
totally out of the running so I think we
 
03:44:43.070 --> 03:44:43.080 align:start position:0%
we need a bill like this representative
 
03:44:45.269 --> 03:44:45.279 align:start position:0%
Corman thank you Mr chairman I'm just
 
03:44:47.030 --> 03:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
going to repeat two things I've said
 
03:44:49.389 --> 03:44:49.399 align:start position:0%
earlier uh something I said two three
 
03:44:52.110 --> 03:44:52.120 align:start position:0%
weeks ago which is my late wife would be
 
03:44:54.510 --> 03:44:54.520 align:start position:0%
shocked that I'm voting for nuclear but
 
03:44:56.510 --> 03:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
I am voting for nuclear here and
 
03:44:57.790 --> 03:44:57.800 align:start position:0%
something I said this morning which was
 
03:44:59.990 --> 03:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
thanking you Mr chairman for being open
 
03:45:01.950 --> 03:45:01.960 align:start position:0%
to suggestions as to how to make this
 
03:45:01.960 --> 03:45:02.910 align:start position:0%
to suggestions as to how to make this
bill

03:45:02.910 --> 03:45:02.920 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:45:06.110 --> 03:45:06.120 align:start position:0%
better you're welcome representative
 
03:45:08.590 --> 03:45:08.600 align:start position:0%
Kaplan yeah I'm I I'm afraid I'm going
 
03:45:10.349 --> 03:45:10.359 align:start position:0%
to be the cloud on the nuclear parade
 
03:45:11.710 --> 03:45:11.720 align:start position:0%
here I'm going to be voting against this
 
03:45:14.510 --> 03:45:14.520 align:start position:0%
bill because I believe that the existing
 
03:45:16.389 --> 03:45:16.399 align:start position:0%
legisl should have been amended along
 
03:45:18.189 --> 03:45:18.199 align:start position:0%
with the Amendments that you that you
 
03:45:20.870 --> 03:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
wisely did offer Mr chair and that is
 
03:45:23.229 --> 03:45:23.239 align:start position:0%
that uh the date of you know the Sunset
 
03:45:24.950 --> 03:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
date on the original Power purchase
 
03:45:26.750 --> 03:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
agreement amendments should really be
 
03:45:28.269 --> 03:45:28.279 align:start position:0%
extended because yes right now we're
 
03:45:29.990 --> 03:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
looking at nuclear and then nuclear is
 
03:45:31.269 --> 03:45:31.279 align:start position:0%
is something that we're going to welcome
 
03:45:32.750 --> 03:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
into our state but 10 years from now it
 
03:45:34.389 --> 03:45:34.399 align:start position:0%
could be geothermal it could be offshore
 
03:45:35.510 --> 03:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
wind it could be a lot of different
 
03:45:38.309 --> 03:45:38.319 align:start position:0%
things and I think you know we shouldn't
 
03:45:40.510 --> 03:45:40.520 align:start position:0%
be limiting it to just
 
03:45:43.030 --> 03:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
nuclear sounds like an opportunity for a
 
03:45:46.349 --> 03:45:46.359 align:start position:0%
bill next year representative
 
03:45:49.189 --> 03:45:49.199 align:start position:0%
parshall thank you I I don't think that
 
03:45:51.229 --> 03:45:51.239 align:start position:0%
uh representative Corman will be alone I
 
03:45:53.590 --> 03:45:53.600 align:start position:0%
will be voting against this bill as well
 
03:45:55.630 --> 03:45:55.640 align:start position:0%
and a new concern of mine this is really
 
03:45:58.110 --> 03:45:58.120 align:start position:0%
this considering this by allowing our
 
03:46:01.110 --> 03:46:01.120 align:start position:0%
utilities to become involved with this
 
03:46:04.269 --> 03:46:04.279 align:start position:0%
are are which we which is a monopoly
 
03:46:07.030 --> 03:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
that this legislature has oversight over
 
03:46:09.429 --> 03:46:09.439 align:start position:0%
and the state has oversight we're really
 
03:46:12.229 --> 03:46:12.239 align:start position:0%
setting ourselves up to uh work against
 
03:46:15.269 --> 03:46:15.279 align:start position:0%
the free market and have a government
 
03:46:17.670 --> 03:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
intrusion into the free market uh it
 
03:46:20.189 --> 03:46:20.199 align:start position:0%
does put the finger on the scale and I
 
03:46:22.590 --> 03:46:22.600 align:start position:0%
am still very hesitant about
 
03:46:26.149 --> 03:46:26.159 align:start position:0%
that representative McGee thank you Mr
 
03:46:29.750 --> 03:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
chairman um I I actually am in favor of
 
03:46:33.070 --> 03:46:33.080 align:start position:0%
the bill um I I don't think it solves
 
03:46:35.070 --> 03:46:35.080 align:start position:0%
all of the things that we maybe want to
 
03:46:38.429 --> 03:46:38.439 align:start position:0%
address in terms of the language around
 
03:46:40.790 --> 03:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
uh you know sunsetting the original uh
 
03:46:42.950 --> 03:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
concept on distributed utilities
 
03:46:45.469 --> 03:46:45.479 align:start position:0%
entering into PPA with other forms of
 
03:46:48.710 --> 03:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
energy but what it does do is it removes
 
03:46:51.870 --> 03:46:51.880 align:start position:0%
that rate payer risk that we were
 
03:46:54.309 --> 03:46:54.319 align:start position:0%
concerned about when when the language
 
03:46:57.469 --> 03:46:57.479 align:start position:0%
included owning and operating because if
 
03:47:02.070 --> 03:47:02.080 align:start position:0%
we if we insist that our utilities buy
 
03:47:05.149 --> 03:47:05.159 align:start position:0%
or operate then that puts the risk all
 
03:47:06.950 --> 03:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
on the rate payer and those are those
 
03:47:11.389 --> 03:47:11.399 align:start position:0%
are extremely expensive but this bill um
 
03:47:14.030 --> 03:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
I think allows them to enter into a
 
03:47:15.910 --> 03:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
power purchase agre greement with
 
03:47:18.750 --> 03:47:18.760 align:start position:0%
someone which might incentivize them to
 
03:47:22.110 --> 03:47:22.120 align:start position:0%
come and build uh that small scale uh
 
03:47:25.870 --> 03:47:25.880 align:start position:0%
plant here and so I I think it it sends
 
03:47:28.309 --> 03:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
the right signals but it um and I don't
 
03:47:30.110 --> 03:47:30.120 align:start position:0%
think we're all agreed you know on this
 
03:47:32.630 --> 03:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
but I think it sends the right signals
 
03:47:34.910 --> 03:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
without being overly heavy-handed
 
03:47:36.710 --> 03:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
because all it's doing is allowing them
 
03:47:39.070 --> 03:47:39.080 align:start position:0%
to enter into those agreements it's not
 
03:47:42.269 --> 03:47:42.279 align:start position:0%
insisting that it happens um so I I
 
03:47:43.710 --> 03:47:43.720 align:start position:0%
actually appreciate the changes that
 
03:47:45.429 --> 03:47:45.439 align:start position:0%
have been made to bring it to this point
 
03:47:46.750 --> 03:47:46.760 align:start position:0%
and I think it's an example of us
 
03:47:50.349 --> 03:47:50.359 align:start position:0%
working as a as a
 
03:47:52.990 --> 03:47:53.000 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
03:47:56.469 --> 03:47:56.479 align:start position:0%
bernardy thank you Mr chair so uh I am
 
03:47:59.269 --> 03:47:59.279 align:start position:0%
not a marketer by trade I worked in the
 
03:48:01.030 --> 03:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical industry doing drug
 
03:48:03.910 --> 03:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
development for 40 years but the one
 
03:48:07.389 --> 03:48:07.399 align:start position:0%
thing the marketers did teach me is if
 
03:48:11.070 --> 03:48:11.080 align:start position:0%
you're going to start a business the
 
03:48:13.630 --> 03:48:13.640 align:start position:0%
first thing you need is not a product
 
03:48:19.309 --> 03:48:19.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:21.870 --> 03:48:21.880 align:start position:0%
customers representative
 
03:48:25.070 --> 03:48:25.080 align:start position:0%
Swanson thank you Mr chair having lived
 
03:48:28.469 --> 03:48:28.479 align:start position:0%
in Nevada for a few years and the fights
 
03:48:31.670 --> 03:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
dealt with the fights over what to do or
 
03:48:34.189 --> 03:48:34.199 align:start position:0%
how to dispose of nuclear waste I do
 
03:48:36.910 --> 03:48:36.920 align:start position:0%
have some reservations about this on the
 
03:48:40.469 --> 03:48:40.479 align:start position:0%
other hand I believe that we can we will
 
03:48:42.630 --> 03:48:42.640 align:start position:0%
have the Technologies and the ability to
 
03:48:45.590 --> 03:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
deal with that when this becomes mature
 
03:48:48.269 --> 03:48:48.279 align:start position:0%
so I am in favor of
 
03:48:52.269 --> 03:48:52.279 align:start position:0%
this representative Thomas Wendy Thomas
 
03:48:54.870 --> 03:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um during the
 
03:48:56.550 --> 03:48:56.560 align:start position:0%
testimony for this bill we heard that
 
03:48:58.870 --> 03:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
there was a great risk for cost
 
03:49:03.389 --> 03:49:03.399 align:start position:0%
overruns um and that there was um a very
 
03:49:06.110 --> 03:49:06.120 align:start position:0%
high risk of stranded costs um which
 
03:49:08.389 --> 03:49:08.399 align:start position:0%
would leave our rate payers on the hook
 
03:49:11.469 --> 03:49:11.479 align:start position:0%
to pay potentially for these projects
 
03:49:13.710 --> 03:49:13.720 align:start position:0%
just wanted to remind people of that
 
03:49:16.550 --> 03:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
one this is uh Amendment completely
 
03:49:18.269 --> 03:49:18.279 align:start position:0%
eliminates all
 
03:49:21.710 --> 03:49:21.720 align:start position:0%
that representative schneller thank you
 
03:49:26.269 --> 03:49:26.279 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um to address something that
 
03:49:27.830 --> 03:49:27.840 align:start position:0%
representative schneller has the floor
 
03:49:29.830 --> 03:49:29.840 align:start position:0%
please to address something
 
03:49:31.830 --> 03:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
representative Herrington mention that
 
03:49:33.630 --> 03:49:33.640 align:start position:0%
there are other states we are not
 
03:49:35.670 --> 03:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
without competition I would say that if
 
03:49:38.349 --> 03:49:38.359 align:start position:0%
no competition no market and there is
 
03:49:42.110 --> 03:49:42.120 align:start position:0%
clearly a market for small modular
 
03:49:45.269 --> 03:49:45.279 align:start position:0%
reactors uh to power data centers and an
 
03:49:47.630 --> 03:49:47.640 align:start position:0%
entire nuclear industry and tech
 
03:49:50.149 --> 03:49:50.159 align:start position:0%
industry surrounding that so this
 
03:49:52.950 --> 03:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
legislation in conjunction with some of
 
03:49:54.670 --> 03:49:54.680 align:start position:0%
the other bills that this committee has
 
03:49:57.429 --> 03:49:57.439 align:start position:0%
passed uh to Vice chairman Thomas's
 
03:50:00.510 --> 03:50:00.520 align:start position:0%
comments I think uh really puts together
 
03:50:03.630 --> 03:50:03.640 align:start position:0%
a fairly healthy portfolio to send a
 
03:50:05.750 --> 03:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
message to the market that we are indeed
 
03:50:09.070 --> 03:50:09.080 align:start position:0%
in business for both nuclear power and
 
03:50:11.550 --> 03:50:11.560 align:start position:0%
as a means to power incremental
 
03:50:11.560 --> 03:50:12.750 align:start position:0%
as a means to power incremental
technology

03:50:12.750 --> 03:50:12.760 align:start position:0%
technology
 
03:50:15.790 --> 03:50:15.800 align:start position:0%
businesses um so I will be supporting
 
03:50:19.309 --> 03:50:19.319 align:start position:0%
this Bill thank you to your point and to
 
03:50:21.469 --> 03:50:21.479 align:start position:0%
representative Bernard's point the
 
03:50:24.990 --> 03:50:25.000 align:start position:0%
faster the market grows the more
 
03:50:28.030 --> 03:50:28.040 align:start position:0%
quickly companies will evolve to satisfy
 
03:50:29.910 --> 03:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
that market
 
03:50:33.030 --> 03:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
need any further discussion
 
03:50:36.750 --> 03:50:36.760 align:start position:0%
needed seeing none I'd ask the clerk to

710 and I will thank you all for your
 
03:53:18.030 --> 03:53:18.040 align:start position:0%
hard and significant work here today we
 
03:53:19.630 --> 03:53:19.640 align:start position:0%
uh accomplished quite a
 
03:53:23.469 --> 03:53:23.479 align:start position:0%
bit but we're not done so next Monday
 
03:53:23.479 --> 03:53:24.670 align:start position:0%
bit but we're not done so next Monday
March

03:53:24.670 --> 03:53:24.680 align:start position:0%
March
 
03:53:28.790 --> 03:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
10th we will have in the morning a full
 
03:53:33.510 --> 03:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:36.750 --> 03:53:36.760 align:start position:0%
on 11 bills I believe the number is that
 
03:53:39.110 --> 03:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
we still have outstanding and then in
 
03:53:41.149 --> 03:53:41.159 align:start position:0%
the afternoon we will have an executive
 
03:53:45.510 --> 03:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
session on those same 11
 
03:53:48.189 --> 03:53:48.199 align:start position:0%
bills we have to do this all on one day
 
03:53:50.750 --> 03:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
next week because Tuesday is town
 
03:53:53.750 --> 03:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
meeting day and the speaker's office has
 
03:53:57.630 --> 03:53:57.640 align:start position:0%
asked us not to schedule any meetings on
 
03:54:00.030 --> 03:54:00.040 align:start position:0%
Tuesday and since we only have this room
 
03:54:03.070 --> 03:54:03.080 align:start position:0%
for either Monday or Tuesday that pretty
 
03:54:06.429 --> 03:54:06.439 align:start position:0%
much seals Our Fate to having to do all
 
03:54:09.870 --> 03:54:09.880 align:start position:0%
this work on Monday of next week so come
 
03:54:14.429 --> 03:54:14.439 align:start position:0%
prepared study uh the existing bills and
 
03:54:17.950 --> 03:54:17.960 align:start position:0%
and um have your comments ready have any
 
03:54:20.149 --> 03:54:20.159 align:start position:0%
amendments you want to make ready and
 
03:54:23.309 --> 03:54:23.319 align:start position:0%
we'll go from there Vice chair Thomas uh
 
03:54:26.189 --> 03:54:26.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh just a note on on
 
03:54:29.750 --> 03:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh next Tuesday um there there may be
 
03:54:32.389 --> 03:54:32.399 align:start position:0%
some committies elsewhere that may
 
03:54:35.189 --> 03:54:35.199 align:start position:0%
conduct business it's not disallowed so
 
03:54:37.229 --> 03:54:37.239 align:start position:0%
if you are speaking on another bill
 
03:54:40.349 --> 03:54:40.359 align:start position:0%
perhaps be uh be aware of any committee
 
03:54:42.830 --> 03:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
that might be meeting on Tuesday just in
 
03:54:44.790 --> 03:54:44.800 align:start position:0%
case they are
 
03:54:47.070 --> 03:54:47.080 align:start position:0%
we won't
 
03:54:49.429 --> 03:54:49.439 align:start position:0%
be so the speaker is going to allow
 
03:54:53.110 --> 03:54:53.120 align:start position:0%
other committees to meet dis
 
03:54:55.950 --> 03:54:55.960 align:start position:0%
discouraged disc but not disallowed oh
 
03:54:57.990 --> 03:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
it's discouraged but not disallowed sort
 
03:55:00.070 --> 03:55:00.080 align:start position:0%
of like geoengineering I
 
03:55:03.510 --> 03:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
guess okay we have to notify the federal
 
03:55:03.520 --> 03:55:09.550 align:start position:0%
guess okay we have to notify the federal
authorities

03:55:09.550 --> 03:55:09.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:12.149 --> 03:55:12.159 align:start position:0%
J all right anybody else have anything
 
03:55:14.790 --> 03:55:14.800 align:start position:0%
before we call it a day
 
03:55:16.189 --> 03:55:16.199 align:start position:0%
okay we're done thank you everyone I
 
03:55:18.070 --> 03:55:18.080 align:start position:0%
would ask everybody to clear this room
 
03:55:20.389 --> 03:55:20.399 align:start position:0%
because Republicans need to
 
03:55:23.830 --> 03:55:23.840 align:start position:0%
caucus so thank you everybody see you
