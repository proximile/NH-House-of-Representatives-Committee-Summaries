00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:51.509 --> 00:08:51.519 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair the amendment
 
00:08:51.519 --> 00:08:56.550 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair the amendment
covers

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:58.790 --> 00:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
and adds a little bit of clarification
 
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:00.640 align:start position:0%
that's technically unnecessary but i
 
00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
think it was done based on the
 
00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
response i saw during the public meeting
 
00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
addresses a concern that
 
00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
is growing throughout the state of new
 
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.630 align:start position:0%
is growing throughout the state of new
hampshire

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:22.389 --> 00:09:22.399 align:start position:0%
rockingham county
 
00:09:22.399 --> 00:09:23.829 align:start position:0%
rockingham county
but

00:09:23.829 --> 00:09:23.839 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
throughout other parts of the state as
 
00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:34.160 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we have situations where
 
00:09:37.509 --> 00:09:37.519 align:start position:0%
folks who are elected by the people into
 
00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
various positions are
 
00:09:41.269 --> 00:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
being ghosted
 
00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
due to purely political reasons
 
00:09:48.389 --> 00:09:48.399 align:start position:0%
and this bill addresses
 
00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
that that's not okay
 
00:09:52.949 --> 00:09:52.959 align:start position:0%
i want to be clear that because some of
 
00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
the concerns that were raised during the
 
00:09:56.389 --> 00:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
public hearing that folks would have
 
00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
access to things
 
00:09:59.829 --> 00:09:59.839 align:start position:0%
that they shouldn't have access to is
 
00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
completely unfounded this bill does not
 
00:10:04.069 --> 00:10:04.079 align:start position:0%
eliminate any other statute it doesn't
 
00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
overwrite any other statute so if
 
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
something is currently prohibited under
 
00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
state or federal law it remains
 
00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.630 align:start position:0%
state or federal law it remains
prohibited

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:10.640 align:start position:0%
prohibited
 
00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
this doesn't change that in any way
 
00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
so there's no concern that folks would
 
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
have access to personal student records
 
00:10:19.829 --> 00:10:19.839 align:start position:0%
iep records
 
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
confidential faculty records none of
 
00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
those those are all protected by law as
 
00:10:24.389 --> 00:10:24.399 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
and this bill does not change that in
 
00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:28.240 align:start position:0%
any way but what it does do is it says
 
00:10:30.389 --> 00:10:30.399 align:start position:0%
if you're elected to a budget committee
 
00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:32.240 align:start position:0%
you cannot have a superintendent deny
 
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
you the budgetary documents you need to
 
00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:35.750 align:start position:0%
you the budgetary documents you need to
function

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
function
 
00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:38.720 align:start position:0%
if you are elected to a school board
 
00:10:41.509 --> 00:10:41.519 align:start position:0%
you cannot simply be
 
00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
kept from school property from school
 
00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.350 align:start position:0%
kept from school property from school
events

00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
events
 
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
because that's your job as an elected
 
00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.190 align:start position:0%
because that's your job as an elected
official

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
official
 
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
i'll point out specifically in case
 
00:10:54.389 --> 00:10:54.399 align:start position:0%
those are asking on line 17 the the
 
00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
addressing of rsa 91 a5 sections three
 
00:10:59.430 --> 00:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
five and seven those are law they'll
 
00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
continue to be law of the whole
 
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
section's law but i added that just for
 
00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:04.710 align:start position:0%
section's law but i added that just for
clarification

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:04.720 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:06.640 align:start position:0%
i was asked why number six is not
 
00:11:08.949 --> 00:11:08.959 align:start position:0%
included number six addresses school
 
00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:10.640 align:start position:0%
preparedness in the event of an
 
00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
emergency and i think school board
 
00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
members should absolutely be
 
00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:16.160 align:start position:0%
an integral part of that the law doesn't
 
00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:21.670 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:21.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:23.200 align:start position:0%
rsa and this was in the original bill
 
00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
rsa 189 13 a that is the listing of
 
00:11:28.949 --> 00:11:28.959 align:start position:0%
prohibitions to be a teacher if so if
 
00:11:31.509 --> 00:11:31.519 align:start position:0%
you're certainly not qualified to be a
 
00:11:31.519 --> 00:11:32.550 align:start position:0%
you're certainly not qualified to be a
teacher

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
teacher
 
00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
in the sense of you've been convicted of
 
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
certain things then you are
 
00:11:38.389 --> 00:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
rightfully prohibited
 
00:11:38.399 --> 00:11:41.430 align:start position:0%
rightfully prohibited
from

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
being on
 
00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
school property
 
00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:46.160 align:start position:0%
that would prevent a say a registered
 
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
sex offender from being elected to a
 
00:11:49.269 --> 00:11:49.279 align:start position:0%
school board
 
00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:52.240 align:start position:0%
and having access
 
00:11:53.829 --> 00:11:53.839 align:start position:0%
and that is what the uh the bill and the
 
00:11:58.230 --> 00:11:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:59.910 --> 00:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
does any any members wish to speak to
 
00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.750 align:start position:0%
does any any members wish to speak to
the

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
representative bourdain
 
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
thank you chair um
 
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
as much as i dislike this bill
 
00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
this amendment is an improvement on it
 
00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
and if if the committee is
 
00:12:19.269 --> 00:12:19.279 align:start position:0%
determined to pass this bill
 
00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
i want this amendment included so i will
 
00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
support it thank you
 
00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:34.160 align:start position:0%
yes my concern as a former
 
00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
school board member
 
00:12:38.629 --> 00:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
is that there's no time constraints on
 
00:12:41.269 --> 00:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
this so if an elected
 
00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
school board official were to go into a
 
00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:46.240 align:start position:0%
high school in elementary school while
 
00:12:48.069 --> 00:12:48.079 align:start position:0%
classes are going on
 
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know what their intent would be
 
00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:53.200 align:start position:0%
to go into a class that's not and and
 
00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
make a visit that's not pre-arranged i
 
00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
don't have any problem if it's
 
00:12:59.110 --> 00:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
pre-arranged with the teacher the
 
00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
principal to go in and observe a class
 
00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
whatever but just to go in i think is
 
00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
disruptive given
 
00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:08.240 align:start position:0%
the amount of curriculum all the
 
00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:10.240 align:start position:0%
teachers have to cover
 
00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
representative calmly
 
00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i
 
00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
don't know why this bill was before us i
 
00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
don't know why this
 
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
i guess i know why the amendment's
 
00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
before us because it fixes problems with
 
00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
the original bill we have not heard a
 
00:13:27.269 --> 00:13:27.279 align:start position:0%
single reason why this
 
00:13:29.269 --> 00:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
needs to happen
 
00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:31.200 align:start position:0%
we've heard some anecdotes
 
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
from maybe one place
 
00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:35.750 align:start position:0%
from maybe one place
um

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:37.829 --> 00:13:37.839 align:start position:0%
if there's personality disputes solve
 
00:13:37.839 --> 00:13:39.030 align:start position:0%
if there's personality disputes solve
them

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:13:41.189 --> 00:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
we don't need to legislate what someone
 
00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
must do
 
00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
and we don't typically do that
 
00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
anywhere in our statute that i'm aware
 
00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:48.629 align:start position:0%
anywhere in our statute that i'm aware
of

00:13:48.629 --> 00:13:48.639 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
and we certainly don't make it a crime
 
00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:52.470 align:start position:0%
and we certainly don't make it a crime
so

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:54.160 align:start position:0%
unless someone has a reason a compelling
 
00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
reason to do this i'll be voting against
 
00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
representative ray newman
 
00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:05.509 align:start position:0%
representative ray newman
yeah

00:14:05.509 --> 00:14:05.519 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
like uh representative borden a i would
 
00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:10.160 align:start position:0%
probably vote for this amendment because
 
00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
it improves the bill but i still object
 
00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
to the bill
 
00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
and line 11 um it just says
 
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
it says budget committee is that i
 
00:14:23.189 --> 00:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
assume that that means because it says
 
00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
school district position after that
 
00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
i assume that means the school budget
 
00:14:28.629 --> 00:14:28.639 align:start position:0%
committee so we're talking about
 
00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
somebody that has to be on a school
 
00:14:32.949 --> 00:14:32.959 align:start position:0%
board has to be on a budget committee
 
00:14:34.949 --> 00:14:34.959 align:start position:0%
i guess that's the limitation that we
 
00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
tried to get here
 
00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
and the other question i have is
 
00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
it says all school facilities it just
 
00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:43.269 align:start position:0%
it says all school facilities it just
says

00:14:43.269 --> 00:14:43.279 align:start position:0%
says
 
00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
in the bill itself it says and it's not
 
00:14:47.269 --> 00:14:47.279 align:start position:0%
amended by the amendment
 
00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
it says that that they shall have access
 
00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
to all school facilities
 
00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:54.629 align:start position:0%
to all school facilities
and

00:14:54.629 --> 00:14:54.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering if there are any the
 
00:14:59.110 --> 00:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
school is a public building
 
00:15:02.069 --> 00:15:02.079 align:start position:0%
but obviously i think there are spaces
 
00:15:02.079 --> 00:15:04.710 align:start position:0%
but obviously i think there are spaces
in

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
any of the buildings
 
00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:08.720 align:start position:0%
that are not open to the public and i
 
00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
don't know why the school board member
 
00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
needs to have
 
00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
a have unfettered
 
00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:17.030 align:start position:0%
a have unfettered
access

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
access
 
00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
to those spaces and i don't see that
 
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
improved by the amendment so that's my
 
00:15:27.829 --> 00:15:27.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:27.839 --> 00:15:30.230 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:30.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:34.720 align:start position:0%
i think i've had about 42 years in
 
00:15:36.949 --> 00:15:36.959 align:start position:0%
education i was an assistant
 
00:15:36.959 --> 00:15:38.230 align:start position:0%
education i was an assistant
superintendent

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:38.240 align:start position:0%
superintendent
 
00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:40.480 align:start position:0%
deputy commissioner
 
00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:44.069 align:start position:0%
this bill
is

00:15:44.069 --> 00:15:44.079 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
far beyond what i would ever have
 
00:15:48.629 --> 00:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
imagined would be in place
 
00:15:51.269 --> 00:15:51.279 align:start position:0%
i mean the right to know laws cover
 
00:15:52.949 --> 00:15:52.959 align:start position:0%
much of what
 
00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
this is asking for
 
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
areas since covid
 
00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
there are
 
00:16:09.749 --> 00:16:09.759 align:start position:0%
just a variety of different tensions
 
00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
that that are occurring
 
00:16:13.829 --> 00:16:13.839 align:start position:0%
from fragments within our current
 
00:16:13.839 --> 00:16:14.949 align:start position:0%
from fragments within our current
society

00:16:14.949 --> 00:16:14.959 align:start position:0%
society
 
00:16:18.069 --> 00:16:18.079 align:start position:0%
to put a bill like this in on top of
 
00:16:19.749 --> 00:16:19.759 align:start position:0%
everything else i just think is
 
00:16:21.749 --> 00:16:21.759 align:start position:0%
unconscionable i definitely will be
 
00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:28.069 --> 00:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
representative roy
 
00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
as a current member of a municipal
 
00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
budget committee
 
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
i can see the need for this bill because
 
00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:40.240 align:start position:0%
you know when when people are saying
 
00:16:42.069 --> 00:16:42.079 align:start position:0%
well it gives them access to all parts
 
00:16:44.069 --> 00:16:44.079 align:start position:0%
of the school well the school is asking
 
00:16:45.509 --> 00:16:45.519 align:start position:0%
for money and they're asking money for
 
00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:48.320 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers for for certain things
 
00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
and the school board and the budget
 
00:16:51.509 --> 00:16:51.519 align:start position:0%
committees are the representatives of
 
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers the taxpayers certainly
 
00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:54.230 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers the taxpayers certainly
can't

00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
can't
 
00:16:56.069 --> 00:16:56.079 align:start position:0%
go through the school and look at
 
00:16:58.150 --> 00:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
everything and and see why it's
 
00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
necessary and not necessary those are
 
00:17:01.749 --> 00:17:01.759 align:start position:0%
judgment calls that they elect people to
 
00:17:04.549 --> 00:17:04.559 align:start position:0%
make and to bar the people who are
 
00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
responsible for setting the taxes on
 
00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
people from seeing what their money is
 
00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
going towards is in my mind
 
00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
unconscionable it's taxation without
 
00:17:15.669 --> 00:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
representation they can't go in and see
 
00:17:17.189 --> 00:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
what their money is being spent on its
 
00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:18.959 align:start position:0%
secret where they're not allowed it's a
 
00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
special place
 
00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
we have these
 
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
few elected officials
 
00:17:25.909 --> 00:17:25.919 align:start position:0%
that should be able to see
 
00:17:28.789 --> 00:17:28.799 align:start position:0%
why the school needs money what it's for
 
00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
and what's going on so i will be
 
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:37.909 --> 00:17:37.919 align:start position:0%
representative conley
 
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i know we don't
 
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
typically debate and i'm not intending
 
00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
that but something the representative
 
00:17:46.549 --> 00:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
just mentioned this bill goes a lot
 
00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
further in the amendment
 
00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
than just making facilities open
 
00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:52.390 align:start position:0%
than just making facilities open
um

00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:54.720 align:start position:0%
it says essentially they can enter the
 
00:17:56.549 --> 00:17:56.559 align:start position:0%
school and do whatever they want in said
 
00:17:59.029 --> 00:17:59.039 align:start position:0%
building whenever they desire it that's
 
00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
it's not limited
 
00:18:01.669 --> 00:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
to what
 
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
the member just said
 
00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:04.720 align:start position:0%
that kind of
 
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
what he describes i think we all agree
 
00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:10.160 align:start position:0%
reasonable in most circumstances but
 
00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
that those kind of limits are not
 
00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
so the way the way the amendment's
 
00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
written line 12 it says shall
 
00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
be so basically it says any other
 
00:18:26.789 --> 00:18:26.799 align:start position:0%
elected school district position shall
 
00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:28.640 align:start position:0%
be denied access to any school facility
 
00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
documents or school activities by the
 
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.830 align:start position:0%
documents or school activities by the
superintendent

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
superintendent
 
00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:34.640 align:start position:0%
that does that's not saying that
 
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
a member of the budget committee or the
 
00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
school board can just you know have
 
00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:40.640 align:start position:0%
universal access to public schools at
 
00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
any time in the middle of the night
 
00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
that's not what it says
 
00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
it's that they can't be denied access
 
00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
so if a school had a role that you need
 
00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
to sign in and to schedule a time i
 
00:18:51.029 --> 00:18:51.039 align:start position:0%
don't believe that that would be a
 
00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:54.710 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
bill is written before us right now
 
00:18:59.029 --> 00:18:59.039 align:start position:0%
is if that there is no exception and
 
00:19:00.789 --> 00:19:00.799 align:start position:0%
they just simply deny the person access
 
00:19:01.909 --> 00:19:01.919 align:start position:0%
all together
 
00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:03.440 align:start position:0%
and i don't i don't understand why it's
 
00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
unreasonable if a member if if a school
 
00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:07.270 align:start position:0%
unreasonable if a member if if a school
is

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:19:10.549 --> 00:19:10.559 align:start position:0%
you know advocating for you know a new
 
00:19:11.909 --> 00:19:11.919 align:start position:0%
gym facility
 
00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
or whatnot that members of the budget
 
00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
committee would want to see the
 
00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
existing facility
 
00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
to be denied access i i'm curious why
 
00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
people are opposed to allowing access to
 
00:19:25.029 --> 00:19:25.039 align:start position:0%
information so people can make informed
 
00:19:26.549 --> 00:19:26.559 align:start position:0%
decisions i haven't heard any reason why
 
00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:28.640 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't be about access to this
 
00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:29.430 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't be about access to this
it's

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
may i respond and the fact that it's i
 
00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
hear that it's not happening i know in
 
00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
in my district it's not happening but
 
00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:36.400 align:start position:0%
it's i hear it's happening in other
 
00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
other districts and members of this
 
00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
committee it's happened in
 
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
in their districts so i'm just
 
00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
i'm curious why that we would not want
 
00:19:45.669 --> 00:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
to allow access
 
00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
to the facility
 
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
mr chairman if i might respond that
 
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
limitation that everyone seems to think
 
00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
exists doesn't exist it says shall not
 
00:19:54.789 --> 00:19:54.799 align:start position:0%
or shall
 
00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
you know no elected member of school
 
00:19:58.390 --> 00:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
board budget committee etc shall be
 
00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
denied access to any school facilities
 
00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
it doesn't stipulate any kind of limits
 
00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
as we heard from the member from nashua
 
00:20:08.149 --> 00:20:08.159 align:start position:0%
there's not any kind of limit
 
00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
that i think would be reasonable it's
 
00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:12.070 align:start position:0%
that i think would be reasonable it's
that

00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
those you know three to four words are
 
00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
the problem with this bill and this
 
00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:17.909 align:start position:0%
the problem with this bill and this
amendment

00:20:17.909 --> 00:20:17.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
so you believe that if someone attempted
 
00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
a member of the budget committee tried
 
00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
to access the public school at three
 
00:20:24.549 --> 00:20:24.559 align:start position:0%
o'clock in the morning that they would
 
00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
be violent that would be a violation of
 
00:20:27.669 --> 00:20:27.679 align:start position:0%
this law
 
00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:28.799 align:start position:0%
as written
 
00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
i think one could make that argument and
 
00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:33.669 align:start position:0%
i think one could make that argument and
again

00:20:33.669 --> 00:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
we haven't heard from a single member of
 
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
the public
 
00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
or any budget committee member who has
 
00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
said i tried to get these documents
 
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
i tried to get into this facility and i
 
00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
was denied we heard any one single
 
00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:46.470 align:start position:0%
was denied we heard any one single
anecdote

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
anecdote
 
00:20:47.909 --> 00:20:47.919 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure why we're legislating
 
00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
representative pearson thank you sir
 
00:20:56.149 --> 00:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
a couple things
 
00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
based on what i've heard um
 
00:20:59.830 --> 00:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
you know we use the term space is not
 
00:21:01.909 --> 00:21:01.919 align:start position:0%
open to the public recently here elected
 
00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
school board members and school budget
 
00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
committee members they're not public
 
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
they're elected officials and they're
 
00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
elected officials that are over and
 
00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
above a superintendent i think that's
 
00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
where part of the problem here is is
 
00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
that we've turned superintendents into
 
00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
kings of their domain when in fact they
 
00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:17.440 align:start position:0%
report they are subservient to the
 
00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
school board and that's where we're
 
00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
having problems here the second thing
 
00:21:23.029 --> 00:21:23.039 align:start position:0%
under the right to no law an elected
 
00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
school official should never ever have
 
00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
to file a 91a request to get documents
 
00:21:30.549 --> 00:21:30.559 align:start position:0%
to do their jobs ever
 
00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
and the idea that that would be a remedy
 
00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
and a
 
00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
concept that would be used for these
 
00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
people to have to perform their elected
 
00:21:39.909 --> 00:21:39.919 align:start position:0%
duty isn't is just frankly
 
00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
why this this is being written because
 
00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
we're having you mentioned reasonable
 
00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:46.470 align:start position:0%
we're having you mentioned reasonable
okay

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:47.669 align:start position:0%
okay
reasonable

00:21:47.669 --> 00:21:47.679 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
00:21:48.789 --> 00:21:48.799 align:start position:0%
sure there's a lot of things that people
 
00:21:50.549 --> 00:21:50.559 align:start position:0%
would think would be reasonable but
 
00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
that's not what's occurring and if you
 
00:21:53.669 --> 00:21:53.679 align:start position:0%
want examples we have a budget committee
 
00:21:55.029 --> 00:21:55.039 align:start position:0%
member in the north country that reached
 
00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
out to me that was told shut up and
 
00:21:58.470 --> 00:21:58.480 align:start position:0%
write the checks you don't get to see
 
00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
any of the documents to verify
 
00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
in my county rockingham county alone we
 
00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
had a superintendent bar a school board
 
00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
member from school property because he
 
00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:09.200 align:start position:0%
questioned something in a budget this is
 
00:22:10.789 --> 00:22:10.799 align:start position:0%
occurring it's happening it's
 
00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
politically motivated and again we've
 
00:22:14.789 --> 00:22:14.799 align:start position:0%
turned this on our heads this wasn't
 
00:22:16.149 --> 00:22:16.159 align:start position:0%
done in the dark this was done with the
 
00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner of education and vetted by
 
00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:27.029 --> 00:22:27.039 align:start position:0%
represented muse yes i i don't agree
 
00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
with the member that this is politically
 
00:22:30.549 --> 00:22:30.559 align:start position:0%
motivated but i think it's politically
 
00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:32.720 align:start position:0%
motivated in a different way
 
00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:33.590 align:start position:0%
motivated in a different way
um

00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
this continues a pattern that we've seen
 
00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
throughout this legislature
 
00:22:39.909 --> 00:22:39.919 align:start position:0%
and throughout this legislative session
 
00:22:39.919 --> 00:22:41.350 align:start position:0%
and throughout this legislative session
of

00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
making school officials
 
00:22:45.669 --> 00:22:45.679 align:start position:0%
and making administrators
 
00:22:45.679 --> 00:22:47.510 align:start position:0%
and making administrators
adversaries

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
adversaries
 
00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
traditionally in new hampshire elected
 
00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
school officials and school
 
00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
administrators have been partners in the
 
00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:56.240 align:start position:0%
same cause that's the way it's worked
 
00:22:58.630 --> 00:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
here for years
 
00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
now we're starting to see laws uh like
 
00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:02.230 align:start position:0%
now we're starting to see laws uh like
this

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:02.240 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
and we're talking about who's
 
00:23:05.669 --> 00:23:05.679 align:start position:0%
subservient to who
 
00:23:08.549 --> 00:23:08.559 align:start position:0%
um i think we need to kind of get a get
 
00:23:10.149 --> 00:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
a grip on
 
00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
on on reality and and get a grip on the
 
00:23:15.029 --> 00:23:15.039 align:start position:0%
kind of situation that we want to have
 
00:23:17.669 --> 00:23:17.679 align:start position:0%
uh going forward and uh as
 
00:23:19.669 --> 00:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
representative conley said there are
 
00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
serious problems with this amendment
 
00:23:22.789 --> 00:23:22.799 align:start position:0%
there are serious problems with this
 
00:23:22.799 --> 00:23:24.230 align:start position:0%
there are serious problems with this
bill

00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:26.720 align:start position:0%
the the original testimony
 
00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:27.590 align:start position:0%
the the original testimony
of

00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
of the of the representative who came
 
00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
before us
 
00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
and related uh one anecdote
 
00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.350 align:start position:0%
and related uh one anecdote
frankly

00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
frankly
 
00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure it actually helped to make
 
00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
the point at all uh i mean what it
 
00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
basically what it basically showed was
 
00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
that the the person in question uh was
 
00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
over the top uh with his rhetoric uh
 
00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
talked about um uh you know even talked
 
00:23:54.789 --> 00:23:54.799 align:start position:0%
about doing things like uh
 
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
you know i'll quote you from what what
 
00:23:59.190 --> 00:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
it was said what he said he said
 
00:24:00.789 --> 00:24:00.799 align:start position:0%
if uh
 
00:24:00.799 --> 00:24:01.909 align:start position:0%
if uh
uh

00:24:01.909 --> 00:24:01.919 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:24:03.669 --> 00:24:03.679 align:start position:0%
the member said i was trained as a
 
00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
sniper if i want to harm children it
 
00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
would be while they were on the
 
00:24:09.669 --> 00:24:09.679 align:start position:0%
playground this is a person that we want
 
00:24:11.909 --> 00:24:11.919 align:start position:0%
to uh we just want to give a free pass
 
00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
to school grounds
 
00:24:18.549 --> 00:24:18.559 align:start position:0%
i think part part of this is um part of
 
00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:20.240 align:start position:0%
this is just sort of symptomatic of what
 
00:24:22.789 --> 00:24:22.799 align:start position:0%
we've been seeing this entire session
 
00:24:24.789 --> 00:24:24.799 align:start position:0%
with attacks on public schools attacks
 
00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
on public school officials
 
00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
and i'm not going to put my name on
 
00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
anything that gives
 
00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:35.200 align:start position:0%
essentially gives people
 
00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
the ability to divide us even more than
 
00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
we already are so i'll be voting against
 
00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:40.640 align:start position:0%
the amendment and i'll be voting against
 
00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:47.200 align:start position:0%
represent representatives if i may just
 
00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
inquire and
 
00:24:51.269 --> 00:24:51.279 align:start position:0%
how have you how do you expect a member
 
00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
of the budget committee to make an
 
00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
informed decision
 
00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
on a light item
 
00:24:57.269 --> 00:24:57.279 align:start position:0%
if they ask or inquire with the school
 
00:24:58.950 --> 00:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
for information and they denied access
 
00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
to that information
 
00:25:02.549 --> 00:25:02.559 align:start position:0%
i don't think we've actually heard that
 
00:25:05.669 --> 00:25:05.679 align:start position:0%
anybody of that situation i mean the the
 
00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
situation that we heard in testimony was
 
00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
the one that i just told you
 
00:25:10.549 --> 00:25:10.559 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
i don't know the way it works in your
 
00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
cities in town but i mean if
 
00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
if a school board member was to ask
 
00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:17.360 align:start position:0%
somebody for information about the
 
00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
budget or more information they make it
 
00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
a point to get them to get them that
 
00:25:23.029 --> 00:25:23.039 align:start position:0%
information and
 
00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes they can't get it to them
 
00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
right away they have to do some research
 
00:25:28.789 --> 00:25:28.799 align:start position:0%
they have to look things up they also
 
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
have to look at things like
 
00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
confidentiality when it comes to eips
 
00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
and things like that
 
00:25:35.269 --> 00:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
but i mean
 
00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
this literally is a non-existent problem
 
00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
made up in people's head and it doesn't
 
00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
representative roy
 
00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i i wanted to just
 
00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
address quickly um
 
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
the concern about this being
 
00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
unrestricted access if we just look at
 
00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
this from a commonsensical standpoint it
 
00:25:58.549 --> 00:25:58.559 align:start position:0%
says they shall not be denied
 
00:26:00.789 --> 00:26:00.799 align:start position:0%
so if i call as a member of the budget
 
00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:03.200 align:start position:0%
committee and ask the superintendent i'd
 
00:26:05.669 --> 00:26:05.679 align:start position:0%
like to come into the school and
 
00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
look at a b or c
 
00:26:09.909 --> 00:26:09.919 align:start position:0%
and he says fine next tuesday at one
 
00:26:11.909 --> 00:26:11.919 align:start position:0%
o'clock he may do so
 
00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
i go make a complaint to the court or to
 
00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
the police and say i've been denied
 
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.110 align:start position:0%
the police and say i've been denied
access

00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
access
 
00:26:19.269 --> 00:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
i wasn't denied access i was told when i
 
00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
could do it
 
00:26:22.549 --> 00:26:22.559 align:start position:0%
denied access means you were denied it
 
00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that you were allowed and
 
00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
there was certain restrictions to it
 
00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
just means you were denied so this bill
 
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
does not give unfettered access as long
 
00:26:33.909 --> 00:26:33.919 align:start position:0%
as the person is not flat denied this
 
00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
statute would not be violated
 
00:26:39.909 --> 00:26:39.919 align:start position:0%
so um the the this conception that
 
00:26:41.669 --> 00:26:41.679 align:start position:0%
school board members would just be able
 
00:26:43.029 --> 00:26:43.039 align:start position:0%
to walk through the school when they
 
00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
want and look at whatever they want is
 
00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
not true it clearly says that they have
 
00:26:49.269 --> 00:26:49.279 align:start position:0%
to be denied it doesn't mean that they
 
00:26:51.029 --> 00:26:51.039 align:start position:0%
were allowed but there were certain
 
00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:01.029 --> 00:27:01.039 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:27:03.029 --> 00:27:03.039 align:start position:0%
and i'm the one that talked about public
 
00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
spaces i i don't
 
00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
want to think that a school board member
 
00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
has to go through
 
00:27:11.669 --> 00:27:11.679 align:start position:0%
to get a public or make a request to get
 
00:27:11.679 --> 00:27:13.510 align:start position:0%
to get a public or make a request to get
information

00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
but i think this is a this is a bill
 
00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
that's looking for a problem and there
 
00:27:19.029 --> 00:27:19.039 align:start position:0%
have been problems where people go in
 
00:27:20.789 --> 00:27:20.799 align:start position:0%
and are denied for some reason by the
 
00:27:20.799 --> 00:27:22.310 align:start position:0%
and are denied for some reason by the
superintendent

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
superintendent
 
00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
in my understanding based on the
 
00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
testimony i heard by the observation of
 
00:27:27.269 --> 00:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
my wife who was a school board member
 
00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
for eight years by
 
00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
talks with other people that are school
 
00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
board members i think that if i were a
 
00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
school board member and i was denied
 
00:27:39.269 --> 00:27:39.279 align:start position:0%
access to information that i needed
 
00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
and i went and asked for it and maybe
 
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
the superintendent didn't like the way i
 
00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
asked for it and said you are now barred
 
00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
from the school
 
00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
i believe that school boards act as
 
00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
units a lot of them have protocol like
 
00:27:54.789 --> 00:27:54.799 align:start position:0%
they do in nashua that says the sq
 
00:27:54.799 --> 00:27:55.830 align:start position:0%
they do in nashua that says the sq
that

00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
that prohibit
 
00:27:59.830 --> 00:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
school board members from going in
 
00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
individually and dealing with employees
 
00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
because school boards act as a unit so
 
00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
if i were that person who couldn't get
 
00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
that information i would go back to the
 
00:28:13.269 --> 00:28:13.279 align:start position:0%
school board if i was not the president
 
00:28:15.029 --> 00:28:15.039 align:start position:0%
i would complain to the president of the
 
00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
school board and that unit as a school
 
00:28:20.149 --> 00:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
board should take action against that
 
00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
superintendent for doing whatever it is
 
00:28:24.149 --> 00:28:24.159 align:start position:0%
they did
 
00:28:26.149 --> 00:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
and get the information that the school
 
00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
board needs
 
00:28:29.269 --> 00:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
so that's how i would handle that
 
00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:35.909 --> 00:28:35.919 align:start position:0%

i do i would um reiterate what i said in
 
00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
my previous statement that um this
 
00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
this committee has passed several
 
00:35:58.150 --> 00:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
cannabis bills on to the full house for
 
00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
consideration by the body we have
 
00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
one allowing unfettered access to
 
00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
marijuana and another one that would set
 
00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
up a system of sales controlled by the
 
00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:09.349 align:start position:0%
up a system of sales controlled by the
state

00:36:09.349 --> 00:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
for the body to consider
 
00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
having those two pieces of legislation
 
00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
currently before the body this would be
 
00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and therefore a move that we
 
00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
representative conley thank you quickly
 
00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
this also you know regardless of how one
 
00:36:27.829 --> 00:36:27.839 align:start position:0%
feels about legalization and the other
 
00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:29.200 align:start position:0%
bills that have moved before this
 
00:36:31.589 --> 00:36:31.599 align:start position:0%
committee this one would allow 18 year
 
00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
olds to possess and use this substance
 
00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
which is not aligned with other bills
 
00:36:39.109 --> 00:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
which have set it at 21 so that's
 
00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
well said the biggest problem with
 
00:36:47.349 --> 00:36:47.359 align:start position:0%
this committee we had
 
00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
i want to say nine cannabis bills
 
00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
they they conflict and a lot of them are
 
00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:56.240 align:start position:0%
amending or changing the same rsa so
 
00:36:57.990 --> 00:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
even if you support a recreational
 
00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.270 align:start position:0%
even if you support a recreational
policy

00:36:59.270 --> 00:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
policy
 
00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
these all can't go over the finish line
 
00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
because one would supersede the next so
 
00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:04.240 align:start position:0%
there is something to say about picking
 
00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:05.270 align:start position:0%
there is something to say about picking
one

00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:37:07.589 --> 00:37:07.599 align:start position:0%
we apparently picked two
 
00:37:07.599 --> 00:37:08.950 align:start position:0%
we apparently picked two
but

00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:11.680 align:start position:0%
picking a third i just don't i don't see
 
00:37:13.349 --> 00:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
we're just passing it to pass it and
 
00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
trying to make a point but i think
 
00:37:17.349 --> 00:37:17.359 align:start position:0%
we put out two different policies and
 
00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
maybe we just see what those the fate of
 
00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
those policies are representative newman
 
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
i just have a parliamentary inquiry
 
00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:26.240 align:start position:0%
you're so recognized
 
00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
thank you let's say out of this plethora
 
00:37:31.109 --> 00:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
of bills that we have
 
00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
several of them were passed
 
00:37:36.069 --> 00:37:36.079 align:start position:0%
and then they went to the uh for to the
 
00:37:36.079 --> 00:37:37.109 align:start position:0%
and then they went to the uh for to the
session

00:37:37.109 --> 00:37:37.119 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:39.280 align:start position:0%
and they were all passed
 
00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
what would be the result of that
 
00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:44.069 align:start position:0%
what would be the result of that
situation

00:37:44.069 --> 00:37:44.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:46.240 align:start position:0%
depending on which bill some of them are
 
00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
second committee bills so some of those
 
00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
would be assigned to another committee
 
00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:52.720 align:start position:0%
uh the ones who are not would go on
 
00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
would advance to the
 
00:37:56.310 --> 00:37:56.320 align:start position:0%
other body the one that we are not
 
00:37:58.630 --> 00:37:58.640 align:start position:0%
allowed to say the name of
 
00:37:59.910 --> 00:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
i'm in support of changing the house
 
00:38:01.589 --> 00:38:01.599 align:start position:0%
rule so we can just say their name but
 
00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
that's just me anyway if they were all
 
00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:05.510 align:start position:0%
that's just me anyway if they were all
pass

00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
pass
 
00:38:07.349 --> 00:38:07.359 align:start position:0%
in the other body without it being
 
00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
amended so they wouldn't come back to
 
00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
the house
 
00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
they would then move on to uh
 
00:38:13.829 --> 00:38:13.839 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:16.720 align:start position:0%
corner office for potential signature
 
00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
which it could be a red signature blue
 
00:38:21.349 --> 00:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
signature or not signed at all
 
00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
but if two or three of them were to
 
00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:24.720 align:start position:0%
become law
 
00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:26.560 align:start position:0%
the last one to become law would
 
00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:28.640 align:start position:0%
supersede the two ones that would have
 
00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
become law before it
 
00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:33.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
this time we'll now move the question uh
 
00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:37.040 align:start position:0%

1127 is there any amendment or any
 
00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
anything being done with that
 
00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
mr chairman that's been a vexing
 
00:40:58.230 --> 00:40:58.240 align:start position:0%
uh endeavor i think for multiple members
 
00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
of this committee of how to
 
00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
get this to a place that we i think we
 
00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
all want to be
 
00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:05.990 align:start position:0%
all want to be
there

00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
is a prohibition in the house of turning
 
00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
a bill into a resolution
 
00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
which has been described by ols and the
 
00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
clerk as
 
00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
probably what we want to do but we can't
 
00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:18.880 align:start position:0%
do it
 
00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
so the short answer is uh
 
00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
we don't have anything coming on that
 
00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:26.710 align:start position:0%
we don't have anything coming on that
bill

00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:28.309 --> 00:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:41:30.069 --> 00:41:30.079 align:start position:0%
at this time we'll now open the
 
00:41:59.349 --> 00:41:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
this time the chair recognizes
 
00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
i would like to make a motion of being
 
00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate
 
00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
that motion was seconded by
 
00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:11.750 align:start position:0%
that motion was seconded by
representative

00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:21.349 align:start position:0%
representative
wallace

00:42:21.349 --> 00:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
this bill was very well intended
 
00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
annulments of convictions for
 
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
people who've passed away and although
 
00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:39.680 align:start position:0%
extremely well intended the optics of
 
00:42:40.950 --> 00:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
that could be rather difficult
 
00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:42.069 align:start position:0%
that could be rather difficult
especially

00:42:42.069 --> 00:42:42.079 align:start position:0%
especially
 
00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
if we're dealing with the conviction
 
00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
it's over 100 years old
 
00:42:48.069 --> 00:42:48.079 align:start position:0%
you need to have standing to file the
 
00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
paperwork for an annulment however
 
00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
justified the
 
00:42:54.790 --> 00:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
request may be
 
00:42:56.790 --> 00:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
for example could i just walk into a
 
00:42:58.470 --> 00:42:58.480 align:start position:0%
courthouse and file
 
00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
a petition for an annulment for someone
 
00:43:03.109 --> 00:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
i'm not related to i'm not
 
00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not the next of kin i'm not i'm not
 
00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:06.640 align:start position:0%
appointed by the court as the minister
 
00:43:07.829 --> 00:43:07.839 align:start position:0%
of the estate
 
00:43:09.829 --> 00:43:09.839 align:start position:0%
that can get that can get complicated in
 
00:43:09.839 --> 00:43:10.829 align:start position:0%
that can get that can get complicated in
of

00:43:10.829 --> 00:43:10.839 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:43:13.349 --> 00:43:13.359 align:start position:0%
itself i i think what we wanted to do
 
00:43:15.829 --> 00:43:15.839 align:start position:0%
here is that it involves what
 
00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
i think we
 
00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
based on the committee's discussion
 
00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
appeared to be an unjust conviction for
 
00:43:23.349 --> 00:43:23.359 align:start position:0%
someone that was involved uh
 
00:43:25.349 --> 00:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
convicted of witchcraft
 
00:43:25.359 --> 00:43:26.790 align:start position:0%
convicted of witchcraft
so

00:43:26.790 --> 00:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:43:29.349 --> 00:43:29.359 align:start position:0%
we agreed in modern time that that was
 
00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
not appropriate and that was unjustified
 
00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:33.670 align:start position:0%
not appropriate and that was unjustified
however

00:43:33.670 --> 00:43:33.680 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:43:35.430 --> 00:43:35.440 align:start position:0%
for the is it appropriate for the
 
00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
legislator to
 
00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
either vacate that conviction or grant
 
00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:40.960 align:start position:0%
an annulment of that conviction through
 
00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
an act of legislation what we could do
 
00:43:45.109 --> 00:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
is allow for an annulment and then
 
00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
someone would have to go into the court
 
00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
to do it
 
00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
how do you how does that happen for
 
00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
someone who's uh
 
00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:52.640 align:start position:0%
who's already passed away
 
00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
if if the person wants to go in right
 
00:43:58.069 --> 00:43:58.079 align:start position:0%
now if you have a conviction we passed
 
00:44:00.069 --> 00:44:00.079 align:start position:0%
a nullman bill's last term relating to
 
00:44:01.829 --> 00:44:01.839 align:start position:0%
possession of cannabis under three
 
00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
quarters an ounce or less
 
00:44:06.550 --> 00:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
any person can go into the court and
 
00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
they can imply to from the annulment
 
00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
that's how it would work
 
00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
what do you do if it's 200 years old i
 
00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
don't i don't know i couldn't figure out
 
00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
an answer to that
 
00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh we were
 
00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
we tried in good faith to at least
 
00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
amend this to a proclamation and uh we
 
00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the rules do not print us
 
00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
to do that so
 
00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
we're saying it here right now
 
00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
and that's the best we can that's the
 
00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
best we can do and thanks for no one
 
00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
making a point of order from me doing
 
00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:33.990 align:start position:0%
making a point of order from me doing
that

00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
representative roy i would i would agree
 
00:44:38.309 --> 00:44:38.319 align:start position:0%
with with the chair and i would also
 
00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
point out that the governor has the
 
00:44:43.589 --> 00:44:43.599 align:start position:0%
preliminary power to grant pardons um
 
00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:47.200 align:start position:0%
posthumously if so necessary um so if if
 
00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:48.720 align:start position:0%
there were a case to be made to have
 
00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:49.670 align:start position:0%
there were a case to be made to have
someone

00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
someone
 
00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
have their conviction pardoned or
 
00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
reversed or nulled the governor does
 
00:44:54.309 --> 00:44:54.319 align:start position:0%
have that power
 
00:44:56.550 --> 00:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
um so the legislation and that's
 
00:44:59.030 --> 00:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
exclusive to the executive for a reason
 
00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:00.400 align:start position:0%
so i don't think it's appropriate for
 
00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
the legislature to be reaching in and
 
00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
interfering in um previous judicial
 
00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
rulings where that power and the
 
00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
constitution was specifically allocated
 
00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
to the chief executive thank you
 
00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:13.030 align:start position:0%
to the chief executive thank you
and

00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
just to clarify what the bill did it
 
00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
identified a specific individual who
 
00:45:20.069 --> 00:45:20.079 align:start position:0%
would be whose conviction would would uh
 
00:45:21.589 --> 00:45:21.599 align:start position:0%
be annulled which that was the other
 
00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
problem is that it's one
 
00:45:25.109 --> 00:45:25.119 align:start position:0%
thing to have a blanket annulment a
 
00:45:26.710 --> 00:45:26.720 align:start position:0%
policy for anyone convicted of said
 
00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
offense but to identify an individual
 
00:45:31.589 --> 00:45:31.599 align:start position:0%
on you know by name
 
00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
we're not we weren't clear that that was
 
00:45:35.109 --> 00:45:35.119 align:start position:0%
something within the
 
00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
authority of the legislator
 
00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
representative boarding
 
00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:42.309 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
uh

00:45:42.309 --> 00:45:42.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
though it is clear that this bill has
 
00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:45.750 align:start position:0%
though it is clear that this bill has
some

00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:46.870 align:start position:0%
some
issues

00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:48.470 align:start position:0%
issues
and

00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:49.510 align:start position:0%
and
but

00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
we just heard two other bills that we
 
00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
put on interim study and i think that
 
00:45:56.710 --> 00:45:56.720 align:start position:0%
that would probably be a more
 
00:45:58.630 --> 00:45:58.640 align:start position:0%
appropriate motion
 
00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
for this bill because putting an as a
 
00:46:04.790 --> 00:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
in expedient legislate
 
00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
basically says that we don't value there
 
00:46:10.870 --> 00:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
is anything important in this bill at
 
00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:11.750 align:start position:0%
is anything important in this bill at
all

00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
so i will have to vote against the itl
 
00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
and prefer another motion come forward
 
00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
representative boarding if i may inquire
 
00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
hypothetically if the motion of index
 
00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
being to legislate was withdrawn
 
00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
would you would the member be inclined
 
00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
to make a motion for an interim study
 
00:46:44.950 --> 00:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:47.109 --> 00:46:47.119 align:start position:0%
representative rory
 
00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
um i i agree with representative
 
00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
bourdain that the topic itself is
 
00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
is a worthy topic for discussion and
 
00:46:56.950 --> 00:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
um so i will withdraw my bill in
 
00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
consideration of a pending uh motion for
 
00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:02.240 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
00:47:03.829 --> 00:47:03.839 align:start position:0%
second withdrawn as well
 
00:47:03.839 --> 00:47:06.950 align:start position:0%
second withdrawn as well
yes

00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
representative bourdain you wish to be
 
00:47:10.069 --> 00:47:10.079 align:start position:0%
recognized to make a motion of interim
 
00:47:10.079 --> 00:47:11.270 align:start position:0%
recognized to make a motion of interim
study

00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
study
 
00:47:14.069 --> 00:47:14.079 align:start position:0%
yes mr chair i do make a promotion to
 
00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
interim study bill uh
 
00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:18.790 align:start position:0%
interim study bill uh
1127.

00:47:18.790 --> 00:47:18.800 align:start position:0%
1127.
 
00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
00:47:22.549 --> 00:47:22.559 align:start position:0%
it's been seconded by representative
 
00:47:27.589 --> 00:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
i would like to point out that this is
 
00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:36.640 align:start position:0%
the second legislative session where
 
00:47:38.790 --> 00:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
we've considered this bill
 
00:47:42.069 --> 00:47:42.079 align:start position:0%
we actually voted on an identical bill
 
00:47:46.150 --> 00:47:46.160 align:start position:0%
uh in 2020 uh hb 1127 which passed this
 
00:47:48.069 --> 00:47:48.079 align:start position:0%
committee unanimously and went to
 
00:47:48.079 --> 00:47:49.270 align:start position:0%
committee unanimously and went to
consent

00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
consent
 
00:47:51.829 --> 00:47:51.839 align:start position:0%
and then was killed by covet
 
00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
we've had plenty of time to consider
 
00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:54.710 align:start position:0%
we've had plenty of time to consider
this

00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:47:56.710 --> 00:47:56.720 align:start position:0%
what this bill does
 
00:47:58.390 --> 00:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
isn't just grant annulments to two
 
00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
individuals but it sets up a legislative
 
00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:02.790 align:start position:0%
individuals but it sets up a legislative
process

00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:02.800 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
the legislature has in its power in to
 
00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
grant an element um
 
00:48:12.150 --> 00:48:12.160 align:start position:0%
uh and we know that because uh in 2021
 
00:48:13.589 --> 00:48:13.599 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we did was we
 
00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:16.240 align:start position:0%
annulled uh all of the convictions of
 
00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:17.190 align:start position:0%
annulled uh all of the convictions of
people

00:48:17.190 --> 00:48:17.200 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:48:20.309 --> 00:48:20.319 align:start position:0%
uh who uh were penalized for violating
 
00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
the governor's coveted executive orders
 
00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
so this is something we definitely have
 
00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
the power to do
 
00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
and in the case of these two individuals
 
00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
what we'd be doing is we'd be cr we'd
 
00:48:34.069 --> 00:48:34.079 align:start position:0%
basically be correcting a real injustice
 
00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
so we can't go back to the nineteen
 
00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
fifties we can't go back two hundred
 
00:48:40.470 --> 00:48:40.480 align:start position:0%
years and change the things that happen
 
00:48:42.790 --> 00:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
to those people but what we do have the
 
00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:45.200 align:start position:0%
power to do is to change how those
 
00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
people are remembered in history and how
 
00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
they're remembered on our books that's
 
00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
really what this bill does
 
00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
it also establishes a process that can
 
00:48:57.349 --> 00:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
be used if there are other people
 
00:48:59.910 --> 00:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
that this legislation might apply to and
 
00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
my guess is
 
00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
as with these two cases
 
00:49:06.309 --> 00:49:06.319 align:start position:0%
it would be applied extremely rarely
 
00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
it's not easy to get a bill through to
 
00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
do something like this but i'll give you
 
00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
one example of another person who might
 
00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
come under this
 
00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:16.720 align:start position:0%
is ruth blay from portsmouth
 
00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
ruth blay
 
00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:20.150 align:start position:0%
ruth blay
either

00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
either
 
00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
miscarried a child
 
00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:26.240 align:start position:0%
or delivered a child who was stillborn
 
00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:28.960 align:start position:0%
she didn't report it to the authorities
 
00:49:31.510 --> 00:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
at the time that was a capital crime and
 
00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
she was actually hung in south street
 
00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
cemetery um about uh about a half a mile
 
00:49:38.950 --> 00:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
from where i live right now
 
00:49:40.549 --> 00:49:40.559 align:start position:0%
so i mean we we have things like this
 
00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
that are scattered throughout our
 
00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:42.870 align:start position:0%
that are scattered throughout our
history

00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
history
 
00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
um and and i think part of our role kind
 
00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
of looking back on these things
 
00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:49.280 align:start position:0%
sometimes in modern times
 
00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:51.200 align:start position:0%
is to say is to acknowledge the fact
 
00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:51.990 align:start position:0%
is to say is to acknowledge the fact
that

00:49:51.990 --> 00:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
you know there have been times in our
 
00:49:55.510 --> 00:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
past when we've made mistakes and while
 
00:49:57.750 --> 00:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
we don't have an opportunity to correct
 
00:49:59.750 --> 00:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
the mistakes themselves we do have an
 
00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:01.109 align:start position:0%
the mistakes themselves we do have an
opportunity

00:50:01.109 --> 00:50:01.119 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
00:50:02.950 --> 00:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
to to correct the ledger and that's
 
00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:05.200 align:start position:0%
really what this bill does in a very
 
00:50:07.829 --> 00:50:07.839 align:start position:0%
articulate and effective way
 
00:50:11.589 --> 00:50:11.599 align:start position:0%
i can't support the interim study
 
00:50:13.990 --> 00:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
i would like to
 
00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:15.510 align:start position:0%
i would like to
hopefully

00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
hopefully
 
00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
if we can defeat the interim study
 
00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:18.470 align:start position:0%
if we can defeat the interim study
motion

00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
recommend this bill ought to pass thank
 
00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:26.150 align:start position:0%
recommend this bill ought to pass thank
you

00:50:26.150 --> 00:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
i am now very confused about the
 
00:50:35.430 --> 00:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
authority of the legislature to
 
00:50:38.069 --> 00:50:38.079 align:start position:0%
grant annulments
 
00:50:39.829 --> 00:50:39.839 align:start position:0%
in my confusion
 
00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
arises because it seems as though
 
00:50:45.109 --> 00:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
if we have already
 
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
heard testimony that said we've already
 
00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
passed annulments
 
00:50:52.109 --> 00:50:52.119 align:start position:0%
it seems that this
 
00:50:55.589 --> 00:50:55.599 align:start position:0%
legislature can can pass a bill that
 
00:50:57.910 --> 00:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
grants an annulment when they like it
 
00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
and not pass the
 
00:51:02.549 --> 00:51:02.559 align:start position:0%
a bill when they
 
00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:06.720 align:start position:0%
don't have a really keen interest in it
 
00:51:08.790 --> 00:51:08.800 align:start position:0%
that may be incorrect but that is the
 
00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
impression i've gotten from the
 
00:51:13.030 --> 00:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:15.270 --> 00:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
just to clarify an annulment
 
00:51:17.589 --> 00:51:17.599 align:start position:0%
is granted by the court the legislator
 
00:51:17.599 --> 00:51:18.470 align:start position:0%
is granted by the court the legislator
can

00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:51:20.790 --> 00:51:20.800 align:start position:0%
impose a procedure or process for one to
 
00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
be eligible or to obtain the annulment
 
00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
in respect to the bill we had last year
 
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
the difference with that
 
00:51:30.549 --> 00:51:30.559 align:start position:0%
the difference with that is that that
 
00:51:32.790 --> 00:51:32.800 align:start position:0%
was a penalty that was not was
 
00:51:34.950 --> 00:51:34.960 align:start position:0%
established through an executive order
 
00:51:36.790 --> 00:51:36.800 align:start position:0%
for violating an executive order but so
 
00:51:38.150 --> 00:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
was the penalty
 
00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:40.640 align:start position:0%
it wasn't something that was in
 
00:51:43.270 --> 00:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
uh in law
 
00:51:45.349 --> 00:51:45.359 align:start position:0%
existing law that that's where that that
 
00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
that's the difference between the two
 
00:51:48.069 --> 00:51:48.079 align:start position:0%
thank you and there was some ques there
 
00:51:49.589 --> 00:51:49.599 align:start position:0%
was a constitutional question to that as
 
00:51:54.950 --> 00:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:56.630 --> 00:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
representative roy
 
00:51:58.710 --> 00:51:58.720 align:start position:0%
thank you i would just like to address
 
00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:52:03.190 --> 00:52:03.200 align:start position:0%
the issue of uh correcting the ledger
 
00:52:04.870 --> 00:52:04.880 align:start position:0%
as was stated
 
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
um i think that it's not necessarily the
 
00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
job of the legislature to go back and
 
00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
rewrite history i think there's value in
 
00:52:16.549 --> 00:52:16.559 align:start position:0%
knowing the wrongs that were done and
 
00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
seeing them and letting them stand as an
 
00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
example to future generations
 
00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
to see and learn from
 
00:52:27.349 --> 00:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
um someone convicted of witchcraft or or
 
00:52:28.870 --> 00:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
someone who was hung
 
00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
for for something as the member stated
 
00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:33.190 align:start position:0%
for for something as the member stated
um

00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:35.990 --> 00:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
while at the time um in in currently
 
00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
that's wrong and horrific
 
00:52:39.829 --> 00:52:39.839 align:start position:0%
we can learn from that and by going back
 
00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
and erasing our mistakes
 
00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:44.640 align:start position:0%
i feel like that's that's uh it's not
 
00:52:46.390 --> 00:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
it's doing a disservice to the children
 
00:52:48.309 --> 00:52:48.319 align:start position:0%
of the future
 
00:52:51.589 --> 00:52:51.599 align:start position:0%
i believe that history is what it is um
 
00:52:52.950 --> 00:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
good bad
 
00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:53.910 align:start position:0%
good bad
ugly

00:52:53.910 --> 00:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
ugly
 
00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
and we should learn from it not try to
 
00:52:59.349 --> 00:52:59.359 align:start position:0%
erase it and change it thank you
 
00:53:01.349 --> 00:53:01.359 align:start position:0%
representative boardney
 
00:53:03.109 --> 00:53:03.119 align:start position:0%

i was one of the people that voted all
 
00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
to pass
 
00:53:12.390 --> 00:53:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:16.390 --> 00:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
but i have found every time that i come
 
00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
here have a a bill that's heard before
 
00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
the public
 
00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
sometimes information comes forward that
 
00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
makes you change your mind on what you
 
00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
had initially uh
 
00:53:32.069 --> 00:53:32.079 align:start position:0%
thought was the right thing to do
 
00:53:32.079 --> 00:53:32.870 align:start position:0%
thought was the right thing to do
and

00:53:32.870 --> 00:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:53:37.270 --> 00:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
in the testimony on this bill we heard
 
00:53:39.510 --> 00:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
there were issues with
 
00:53:40.870 --> 00:53:40.880 align:start position:0%
the what
 
00:53:42.870 --> 00:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
what we were trying to do
 
00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:50.309 --> 00:53:50.319 align:start position:0%
forget about what we did in the past
 
00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
because we have new information
 
00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:54.069 align:start position:0%
because we have new information
and

00:53:54.069 --> 00:53:54.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:53:54.079 --> 00:53:54.950 align:start position:0%
and
uh

00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:53:57.190 --> 00:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
put this as interim study
 
00:54:01.910 --> 00:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:03.589 --> 00:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
and this time we'll now move the
 
00:54:05.349 --> 00:54:05.359 align:start position:0%
question if you're in support of the
 
00:54:07.750 --> 00:54:07.760 align:start position:0%

representative roy you wish to speak to
 
01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
the motion
 
01:01:39.670 --> 01:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
i do um
 
01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
what what the the amendment does is it
 
01:01:44.710 --> 01:01:44.720 align:start position:0%
the original bill um there were concerns
 
01:01:47.190 --> 01:01:47.200 align:start position:0%
about making someone stay in a situation
 
01:01:48.789 --> 01:01:48.799 align:start position:0%
that was potentially
 
01:01:48.799 --> 01:01:50.950 align:start position:0%
that was potentially
potentially

01:01:50.950 --> 01:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
01:01:53.349 --> 01:01:53.359 align:start position:0%
dangerous um with
 
01:01:54.870 --> 01:01:54.880 align:start position:0%
heated emotions
 
01:01:57.750 --> 01:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
especially if it's a juvenile or a woman
 
01:01:59.270 --> 01:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
walking her dog that ends up biting
 
01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:00.230 align:start position:0%
walking her dog that ends up biting
somebody

01:02:00.230 --> 01:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
01:02:02.950 --> 01:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
um making her stay there in other words
 
01:02:04.870 --> 01:02:04.880 align:start position:0%
if someone approaches a woman jogging
 
01:02:06.470 --> 01:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
with her dog and the dog bites the
 
01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
person who tried to approach the woman
 
01:02:10.789 --> 01:02:10.799 align:start position:0%
the bill would have made the woman have
 
01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
to stay there and actually give him her
 
01:02:14.069 --> 01:02:14.079 align:start position:0%
phone number that some seemed a little
 
01:02:16.150 --> 01:02:16.160 align:start position:0%
bit counter-intuitive so what the the
 
01:02:18.309 --> 01:02:18.319 align:start position:0%
bill would do is would it just require
 
01:02:19.829 --> 01:02:19.839 align:start position:0%
that a person make themselves known to
 
01:02:21.349 --> 01:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
the police and give their information to
 
01:02:24.789 --> 01:02:24.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
that their dog had bit someone so that
 
01:02:28.710 --> 01:02:28.720 align:start position:0%
the police know who it was and who owned
 
01:02:30.230 --> 01:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
the dog and then they can verify their
 
01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
rabies information and such
 
01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
so that's what the amendment does it
 
01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
just gives them an opportunity to to get
 
01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
out of that that scene and go to the
 
01:02:40.710 --> 01:02:40.720 align:start position:0%
police and make a report versus having
 
01:02:42.390 --> 01:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
to give the person who was involved
 
01:02:46.390 --> 01:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
representative marston
 
01:02:50.309 --> 01:02:50.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:02:53.109 --> 01:02:53.119 align:start position:0%
i i basically have a question
 
01:02:56.309 --> 01:02:56.319 align:start position:0%
to what representative roy just said
 
01:02:58.870 --> 01:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
what would prevent anybody from leaving
 
01:03:05.270 --> 01:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
representative roy you wish to answer
 
01:03:10.069 --> 01:03:10.079 align:start position:0%
that or respond to that question um
 
01:03:11.670 --> 01:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
the law
 
01:03:14.390 --> 01:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
that's what the law is designed to do
 
01:03:15.510 --> 01:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
they can leave the scene without
 
01:03:16.870 --> 01:03:16.880 align:start position:0%
reporting but they have to go to the
 
01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
police department and make the report if
 
01:03:21.349 --> 01:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
they do not make themselves known or go
 
01:03:23.270 --> 01:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
to the police with the information they
 
01:03:27.349 --> 01:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:29.190 --> 01:03:29.200 align:start position:0%
representative conley
 
01:03:31.029 --> 01:03:31.039 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:03:33.589 --> 01:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
this this bill is makes sense i guess
 
01:03:34.789 --> 01:03:34.799 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if there's like a piece
 
01:03:37.109 --> 01:03:37.119 align:start position:0%
that we're not considering is if i'm in
 
01:03:39.670 --> 01:03:39.680 align:start position:0%
an incident with a stranger
 
01:03:41.270 --> 01:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
then there's some sort of dog bite that
 
01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:42.470 align:start position:0%
then there's some sort of dog bite that
occurs

01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
occurs
 
01:03:45.750 --> 01:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
and i or the owner of the dog departs
 
01:03:47.910 --> 01:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
the scene without sharing information
 
01:03:50.230 --> 01:03:50.240 align:start position:0%
how are police gonna find
 
01:03:52.549 --> 01:03:52.559 align:start position:0%
this pr i don't is that stipulated here
 
01:03:54.069 --> 01:03:54.079 align:start position:0%
i don't know if i see that but how would
 
01:03:55.910 --> 01:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
one know how to find that person if no
 
01:03:57.829 --> 01:03:57.839 align:start position:0%
one's giving information and the dog
 
01:03:59.910 --> 01:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
bite doesn't result in any sort of
 
01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:02.230 align:start position:0%
bite doesn't result in any sort of
public

01:04:02.230 --> 01:04:02.240 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:06.390 align:start position:0%
public
disposition

01:04:06.390 --> 01:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:08.150 --> 01:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
it's the police my understanding is that
 
01:04:09.829 --> 01:04:09.839 align:start position:0%
if because this would be a crime that
 
01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
they would investigate
 
01:04:13.829 --> 01:04:13.839 align:start position:0%
that i mean if someone is at a dog park
 
01:04:15.510 --> 01:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
and they get in their car
 
01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
if the dog can be it could be a dog
 
01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:19.190 align:start position:0%
if the dog can be it could be a dog
that's

01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:04:21.510 --> 01:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
recognized in the neighborhood
 
01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:22.309 align:start position:0%
recognized in the neighborhood
so

01:04:22.309 --> 01:04:22.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:04:23.349 --> 01:04:23.359 align:start position:0%
you might
 
01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
quite often when there's animal attacks
 
01:04:27.270 --> 01:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
the the person who is injured by the
 
01:04:30.309 --> 01:04:30.319 align:start position:0%
animal may know the dog's owner already
 
01:04:31.829 --> 01:04:31.839 align:start position:0%
the big thing here is trying to get the
 
01:04:33.270 --> 01:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
information be
 
01:04:35.270 --> 01:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
about the animal if someone is attacked
 
01:04:36.549 --> 01:04:36.559 align:start position:0%
by an animal
 
01:04:38.950 --> 01:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
the medical recommendation is is to
 
01:04:41.349 --> 01:04:41.359 align:start position:0%
confirm what that animal has updated on
 
01:04:44.549 --> 01:04:44.559 align:start position:0%
their rabies shots and if they're not
 
01:04:48.309 --> 01:04:48.319 align:start position:0%
the recommendation is to go get
 
01:04:50.390 --> 01:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
the i don't know if it's a vac what you
 
01:04:51.589 --> 01:04:51.599 align:start position:0%
want to call it but the rabies shot
 
01:04:54.150 --> 01:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
we'll call it to avoid the transmission
 
01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:54.950 align:start position:0%
we'll call it to avoid the transmission
now

01:04:54.950 --> 01:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:04:57.029 --> 01:04:57.039 align:start position:0%
i i hear that that is a very painful
 
01:04:59.430 --> 01:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
procedure and it can all be avoided
 
01:05:01.750 --> 01:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
if you're able to verify the status of
 
01:05:03.670 --> 01:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
the animal
 
01:05:06.470 --> 01:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
so i don't think that's asking too much
 
01:05:08.069 --> 01:05:08.079 align:start position:0%
in addition to saving the medical
 
01:05:09.829 --> 01:05:09.839 align:start position:0%
expense of having to go to the emergency
 
01:05:12.309 --> 01:05:12.319 align:start position:0%
room for a painful procedure
 
01:05:14.309 --> 01:05:14.319 align:start position:0%
i i don't think that's asking much
 
01:05:16.230 --> 01:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
uh it's your people are responsible for
 
01:05:17.109 --> 01:05:17.119 align:start position:0%
what their
 
01:05:18.549 --> 01:05:18.559 align:start position:0%
animals do
 
01:05:20.309 --> 01:05:20.319 align:start position:0%
for better or worse so i think this is a
 
01:05:20.319 --> 01:05:21.109 align:start position:0%
for better or worse so i think this is a
good

01:05:21.109 --> 01:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
good
 
01:05:23.589 --> 01:05:23.599 align:start position:0%
policy it's not limited to just dogs it
 
01:05:24.870 --> 01:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply whether the dog's on the
 
01:05:27.190 --> 01:05:27.200 align:start position:0%
leash off the leash it it really offers
 
01:05:28.710 --> 01:05:28.720 align:start position:0%
protection to the person the receiving
 
01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:29.670 align:start position:0%
protection to the person the receiving
end

01:05:29.670 --> 01:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
end
 
01:05:31.829 --> 01:05:31.839 align:start position:0%
and i think that this is a good a good
 
01:05:31.839 --> 01:05:34.870 align:start position:0%
and i think that this is a good a good
policy

01:05:34.870 --> 01:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:37.109 --> 01:05:37.119 align:start position:0%
representative roy i i just wanted to
 
01:05:39.109 --> 01:05:39.119 align:start position:0%
make a point that it's the same kind of
 
01:05:40.630 --> 01:05:40.640 align:start position:0%
thing with leaving the scene of an
 
01:05:43.029 --> 01:05:43.039 align:start position:0%
accident i mean if you get an accident
 
01:05:44.789 --> 01:05:44.799 align:start position:0%
and you get your car and take off how
 
01:05:46.230 --> 01:05:46.240 align:start position:0%
would the police if they didn't get the
 
01:05:48.710 --> 01:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
plate no well that's i guess that's your
 
01:05:50.150 --> 01:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
job they could investigate and figure it
 
01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:51.109 align:start position:0%
job they could investigate and figure it
out

01:05:51.109 --> 01:05:51.119 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:05:52.390 --> 01:05:52.400 align:start position:0%
so it's really
 
01:05:54.150 --> 01:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
in my mind it's the same situation of
 
01:05:55.990 --> 01:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
leaving the scene of an accident leaving
 
01:05:57.510 --> 01:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
the scene of a dog bite i mean if your
 
01:05:59.349 --> 01:05:59.359 align:start position:0%
dog bites somebody and you take off and
 
01:06:00.789 --> 01:06:00.799 align:start position:0%
don't don't make your name known to the
 
01:06:02.390 --> 01:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
police or to the person who was bitten
 
01:06:05.029 --> 01:06:05.039 align:start position:0%
you'd be guilty of this violation
 
01:06:06.789 --> 01:06:06.799 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:06:08.549 --> 01:06:08.559 align:start position:0%
representative burt
 
01:06:11.829 --> 01:06:11.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:13.510 --> 01:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
i'm going to vote against this and the
 
01:06:15.750 --> 01:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
reason is because the dog groups do not
 
01:06:17.430 --> 01:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
support this
 
01:06:20.150 --> 01:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
and they listed all the issues that
 
01:06:22.230 --> 01:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
could come from this
 
01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:23.589 align:start position:0%
could come from this
um

01:06:23.589 --> 01:06:23.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:24.870 --> 01:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
and also
 
01:06:26.309 --> 01:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
if you could you know if somebody could
 
01:06:28.309 --> 01:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
answer the question you know even though
 
01:06:29.910 --> 01:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
i'm voting against it i was just looking
 
01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:33.200 align:start position:0%
here i don't see a time frame
 
01:06:35.109 --> 01:06:35.119 align:start position:0%
so let's say somebody's dog bites
 
01:06:37.190 --> 01:06:37.200 align:start position:0%
somebody is there a time frame where
 
01:06:39.109 --> 01:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
they have to
 
01:06:41.589 --> 01:06:41.599 align:start position:0%
tell the police or can they come in six
 
01:06:43.430 --> 01:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
months and tell the police you know i
 
01:06:45.430 --> 01:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
just don't see a time frame
 
01:06:47.990 --> 01:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:51.510 --> 01:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
the the amendment as proposed on line 13
 
01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:52.230 align:start position:0%
the the amendment as proposed on line 13
says

01:06:52.230 --> 01:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
says
 
01:06:53.589 --> 01:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
they must report to the police
 
01:06:53.599 --> 01:06:55.109 align:start position:0%
they must report to the police
immediately

01:06:55.109 --> 01:06:55.119 align:start position:0%
immediately
 
01:06:55.119 --> 01:06:58.950 align:start position:0%
immediately
so

01:06:58.950 --> 01:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:00.470 --> 01:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
representative muse
 
01:07:05.510 --> 01:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:07.109 --> 01:07:07.119 align:start position:0%
one of the things i wanted to say is i'm
 
01:07:09.029 --> 01:07:09.039 align:start position:0%
i'm sympathetic with the intent of this
 
01:07:12.069 --> 01:07:12.079 align:start position:0%
bill um i'm a dog owner and a lot of
 
01:07:14.390 --> 01:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
times in the woods you run into people
 
01:07:15.829 --> 01:07:15.839 align:start position:0%
who just simply don't have their dogs
 
01:07:18.950 --> 01:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
under control so i mean this is not a
 
01:07:21.109 --> 01:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
an uncommon an uncommon issue but where
 
01:07:23.190 --> 01:07:23.200 align:start position:0%
i'm a little stuck with this bill
 
01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:24.069 align:start position:0%
i'm a little stuck with this bill
is

01:07:24.069 --> 01:07:24.079 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
whether it's actually doing anything
 
01:07:28.789 --> 01:07:28.799 align:start position:0%
that improves on the current situation
 
01:07:31.029 --> 01:07:31.039 align:start position:0%
so in a situation like that you know
 
01:07:32.630 --> 01:07:32.640 align:start position:0%
like this currently
 
01:07:35.910 --> 01:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
um the vast majority of dog owners
 
01:07:37.349 --> 01:07:37.359 align:start position:0%
are going to stop
 
01:07:37.359 --> 01:07:38.789 align:start position:0%
are going to stop
um

01:07:38.789 --> 01:07:38.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:41.109 --> 01:07:41.119 align:start position:0%
if they're if there's injury or damage
 
01:07:42.789 --> 01:07:42.799 align:start position:0%
to property
 
01:07:45.589 --> 01:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
they will exchange information what i'm
 
01:07:48.710 --> 01:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
what i'm not sure of is is exactly
 
01:07:50.789 --> 01:07:50.799 align:start position:0%
how this actually gets us to a point
 
01:07:50.799 --> 01:07:52.309 align:start position:0%
how this actually gets us to a point
where

01:07:52.309 --> 01:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:07:53.910 --> 01:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:07:56.390 --> 01:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
police intervening successfully in more
 
01:07:58.950 --> 01:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
reportable interactions
 
01:08:01.029 --> 01:08:01.039 align:start position:0%
so what i
 
01:08:03.109 --> 01:08:03.119 align:start position:0%
you know a big missing thing is
 
01:08:03.119 --> 01:08:04.069 align:start position:0%
you know a big missing thing is
where

01:08:04.069 --> 01:08:04.079 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:08:09.430 --> 01:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:13.589 --> 01:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what incentive there is for
 
01:08:15.670 --> 01:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
somebody who has um
 
01:08:17.749 --> 01:08:17.759 align:start position:0%
a dog that attacks somebody else or that
 
01:08:20.070 --> 01:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
damages property uh to kind of
 
01:08:21.990 --> 01:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
proactively turn themselves into the
 
01:08:24.709 --> 01:08:24.719 align:start position:0%
police i know i know we we spent a long
 
01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
time um
 
01:08:28.709 --> 01:08:28.719 align:start position:0%
last week debating the purple paint bill
 
01:08:28.719 --> 01:08:29.749 align:start position:0%
last week debating the purple paint bill
um

01:08:29.749 --> 01:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:32.070 --> 01:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
and enforceability was one of the main
 
01:08:33.829 --> 01:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
reasons why
 
01:08:33.839 --> 01:08:34.630 align:start position:0%
reasons why
um

01:08:34.630 --> 01:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:37.430 --> 01:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
why the committee as a whole
 
01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:38.870 align:start position:0%
why the committee as a whole
turned

01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
turned
 
01:08:41.030 --> 01:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
thumbs down on that one and i just don't
 
01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:42.550 align:start position:0%
thumbs down on that one and i just don't
see

01:08:42.550 --> 01:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
see
 
01:08:43.910 --> 01:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
how this
 
01:08:46.470 --> 01:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
is really enforceable and you know
 
01:08:48.709 --> 01:08:48.719 align:start position:0%
number one and and also
 
01:08:50.470 --> 01:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
how it actually
 
01:08:53.110 --> 01:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
measurably improves the the current
 
01:08:55.910 --> 01:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
situation over over what we have now so
 
01:08:57.990 --> 01:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm a little stuck when it comes to
 
01:09:02.149 --> 01:09:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:04.229 --> 01:09:04.239 align:start position:0%
under existing law today
 
01:09:05.749 --> 01:09:05.759 align:start position:0%
and i know representatives you would
 
01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
never do this but if your dog
 
01:09:10.709 --> 01:09:10.719 align:start position:0%
bit me and i didn't know who you were
 
01:09:12.709 --> 01:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
you're under no legal obligation to
 
01:09:14.309 --> 01:09:14.319 align:start position:0%
share your information
 
01:09:15.749 --> 01:09:15.759 align:start position:0%
about yourself or the dog for that
 
01:09:18.550 --> 01:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
matter and that actually did occur
 
01:09:20.550 --> 01:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
and that's what that was the inspiration
 
01:09:22.630 --> 01:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
for at least the underlying bill
 
01:09:24.070 --> 01:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
i believe the amendment whether you
 
01:09:25.910 --> 01:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
support the underlying bill or even the
 
01:09:27.510 --> 01:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
amendment i believe is a better version
 
01:09:28.630 --> 01:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
of what the
 
01:09:30.390 --> 01:09:30.400 align:start position:0%
it is an improvement i
 
01:09:31.590 --> 01:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
so i would
 
01:09:32.950 --> 01:09:32.960 align:start position:0%
encourage support supporting the
 
01:09:35.110 --> 01:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
amendment but district the idea is of
 
01:09:36.950 --> 01:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
having a penalty is to deter the
 
01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:38.229 align:start position:0%
having a penalty is to deter the
behavior

01:09:38.229 --> 01:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
behavior
 
01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
01:09:42.309 --> 01:09:42.319 align:start position:0%
if there is no penalty for it
 
01:09:43.669 --> 01:09:43.679 align:start position:0%
we have different we have felonies we
 
01:09:45.669 --> 01:09:45.679 align:start position:0%
have misdemeanors we have fines or
 
01:09:49.110 --> 01:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
violations the idea is to deter conduct
 
01:09:51.510 --> 01:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
and there's only so much we can do
 
01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:52.630 align:start position:0%
and there's only so much we can do
but

01:09:52.630 --> 01:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:09:54.470 --> 01:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
in some situations i believe people will
 
01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
comply with the law knowing that it's a
 
01:09:57.830 --> 01:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
law especially in the sich that
 
01:09:59.750 --> 01:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
situation that happened and where from
 
01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
what i understand the police were
 
01:10:02.390 --> 01:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
present but they could still could not
 
01:10:03.990 --> 01:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
get that person to
 
01:10:05.750 --> 01:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
identify themselves
 
01:10:07.510 --> 01:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
because there was no law so in that
 
01:10:09.270 --> 01:10:09.280 align:start position:0%
place enforce in that situation
 
01:10:11.830 --> 01:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
enforceability well if there was a
 
01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor offense
 
01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:14.709 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor offense
they

01:10:14.709 --> 01:10:14.719 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:10:15.590 --> 01:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
i don't want to speak for what the
 
01:10:16.870 --> 01:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
police would have done but i can imagine
 
01:10:19.189 --> 01:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
they would have at least raised this
 
01:10:21.189 --> 01:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
mention this to that person and gave
 
01:10:23.350 --> 01:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
them the option to perhaps reconsider
 
01:10:24.709 --> 01:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
their conduct
 
01:10:26.950 --> 01:10:26.960 align:start position:0%
so there is is it going to they're going
 
01:10:28.709 --> 01:10:28.719 align:start position:0%
to be situations where someone gets away
 
01:10:31.350 --> 01:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
with an offense
 
01:10:32.709 --> 01:10:32.719 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that happens with a lot of
 
01:10:34.470 --> 01:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
offenses including
 
01:10:37.189 --> 01:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
perhaps this one as well so
 
01:10:39.590 --> 01:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
so i i didn't say i was unsympathetic to
 
01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
the goal of the bill i'm very
 
01:10:43.189 --> 01:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
sympathetic to the goal of the bill my
 
01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
issue is just on the process itself
 
01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:46.709 align:start position:0%
issue is just on the process itself
um

01:10:46.709 --> 01:10:46.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:49.510 --> 01:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
i i'm just not sure that this is
 
01:10:51.030 --> 01:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
in and
 
01:10:52.870 --> 01:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
i i think i'm agreeing with uh with
 
01:10:54.310 --> 01:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
representative byrd
 
01:10:56.070 --> 01:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
um there were a lot of issues that were
 
01:10:58.709 --> 01:10:58.719 align:start position:0%
pointed out that weren't um
 
01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
that weren't i know
 
01:11:02.390 --> 01:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
nobody stopped clutching your chest
 
01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:05.910 align:start position:0%
nobody stopped clutching your chest
everybody

01:11:05.910 --> 01:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:08.470 --> 01:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
but there are um but but i do think that
 
01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of there are a lot of
 
01:11:12.070 --> 01:11:12.080 align:start position:0%
issues and a lot of steps a lot of eyes
 
01:11:14.229 --> 01:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
and tees that weren't dotted and crossed
 
01:11:15.910 --> 01:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
in this particular amendment or bill
 
01:11:18.229 --> 01:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
that really need to be addressed before
 
01:11:21.030 --> 01:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
this is ready for prime time
 
01:11:23.270 --> 01:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
so as much as i would love to pass a
 
01:11:25.189 --> 01:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
bill like this
 
01:11:26.790 --> 01:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
i just don't think this is the bill to
 
01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:27.750 align:start position:0%
i just don't think this is the bill to
pass

01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
pass
 
01:11:28.790 --> 01:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:11:32.950 --> 01:11:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:34.950 --> 01:11:34.960 align:start position:0%
i've read the sentence that i think
 
01:11:37.270 --> 01:11:37.280 align:start position:0%
begins on line 10 and goes on for
 
01:11:38.709 --> 01:11:38.719 align:start position:0%
several lines
 
01:11:40.950 --> 01:11:40.960 align:start position:0%
several times and i'm having a hard time
 
01:11:43.430 --> 01:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out what that requires
 
01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
certain people to do and report to the
 
01:11:48.310 --> 01:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
police it's just to me
 
01:11:51.030 --> 01:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
the amendment may be better but i i
 
01:11:53.189 --> 01:11:53.199 align:start position:0%
and i may vote for the amendment but i
 
01:11:55.350 --> 01:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
don't think i think i'm going to agree
 
01:11:58.149 --> 01:11:58.159 align:start position:0%
with representative muse and bert
 
01:12:03.030 --> 01:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:04.950 --> 01:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
representative bourdain
 
01:12:06.830 --> 01:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
second mr chairman
 
01:12:11.350 --> 01:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
um i remember that angela ferrari
 
01:12:14.470 --> 01:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
presented us with a list of issues with
 
01:12:18.630 --> 01:12:18.640 align:start position:0%
uh this particular bill from dog owners
 
01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:19.510 align:start position:0%
uh this particular bill from dog owners
um

01:12:19.510 --> 01:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
and since i just got this amendment
 
01:12:26.630 --> 01:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
today i've not had a chance to uh go
 
01:12:30.310 --> 01:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
back and see if all her her concerns
 
01:12:32.790 --> 01:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
were addressed in the amendment
 
01:12:35.910 --> 01:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
so i'm having problems i understand the
 
01:12:39.430 --> 01:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill and the amendment but
 
01:12:43.270 --> 01:12:43.280 align:start position:0%
not sure we're there yet
 
01:12:45.270 --> 01:12:45.280 align:start position:0%
if we would like to
 
01:12:47.910 --> 01:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
recess this executive
 
01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:48.790 align:start position:0%
recess this executive
session

01:12:48.790 --> 01:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:12:51.189 --> 01:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
and come back at a later time when we
 
01:12:54.149 --> 01:12:54.159 align:start position:0%
can assure ourselves that all the
 
01:12:56.470 --> 01:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
concerns have been addressed i'd be
 
01:12:59.030 --> 01:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
willing to to go that way
 
01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:01.910 align:start position:0%
willing to to go that way
thanks

01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:03.750 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:13:03.750 --> 01:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:13:06.149 --> 01:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
the concerns not with that have just
 
01:13:09.350 --> 01:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
been articulated notwithstanding i don't
 
01:13:11.510 --> 01:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
like that we don't make clear that this
 
01:13:15.030 --> 01:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
should not be a jailable offense so
 
01:13:15.990 --> 01:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:13:17.350 --> 01:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
if we're gonna go down the route of
 
01:13:19.990 --> 01:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
maybe pausing this for a bit
 
01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
making clear that this is a class b
 
01:13:24.470 --> 01:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor no jail time
 
01:13:27.189 --> 01:13:27.199 align:start position:0%
especially because if we talk about what
 
01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
we learned again with the purple paint
 
01:13:29.910 --> 01:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
bill as people might not know this
 
01:13:33.590 --> 01:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
change has taken effect for many years
 
01:13:35.590 --> 01:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
making someone subject to
 
01:13:37.990 --> 01:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
however unlikely jail time for this
 
01:13:41.270 --> 01:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:42.390 --> 01:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
so representative calling if i
 
01:13:44.790 --> 01:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
understand you correctly if when when it
 
01:13:47.270 --> 01:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
just says misdemeanor which my
 
01:13:49.430 --> 01:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
understanding would give the
 
01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:50.470 align:start position:0%
understanding would give the
the

01:13:50.470 --> 01:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:13:52.630 --> 01:13:52.640 align:start position:0%
prosecutor the discretion to prosecute
 
01:13:55.110 --> 01:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
as a class a or class b if it
 
01:13:57.110 --> 01:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
expressly stated class b misdemeanor you
 
01:13:58.830 --> 01:13:58.840 align:start position:0%
would be in support
 
01:14:01.910 --> 01:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
of the the amendment
 
01:14:03.910 --> 01:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
mr chairman certainly more palatable but
 
01:14:05.350 --> 01:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
i we would have to wait and see what the
 
01:14:07.430 --> 01:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
amendment looked like
 
01:14:10.630 --> 01:14:10.640 align:start position:0%
if that was the only change
 
01:14:13.030 --> 01:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
it's just word for word identical all it
 
01:14:16.149 --> 01:14:16.159 align:start position:0%
says is class b misdemeanor would that
 
01:14:17.910 --> 01:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
would you support that amendment that
 
01:14:21.669 --> 01:14:21.679 align:start position:0%
would assuage many of my concerns yes
 
01:14:27.030 --> 01:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:29.270 --> 01:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
would you vote yay or nay
 
01:14:30.709 --> 01:14:30.719 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
01:14:38.709 --> 01:14:38.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:40.870 --> 01:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
representative true
 
01:14:43.350 --> 01:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:14:45.990 --> 01:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
from my notes uh when we heard uh
 
01:14:49.030 --> 01:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
testimony on this
 
01:14:51.350 --> 01:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that came about because
 
01:14:52.390 --> 01:14:52.400 align:start position:0%
of a
 
01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
singular incident
 
01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:57.189 align:start position:0%
singular incident
and

01:14:57.189 --> 01:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:14:59.430 --> 01:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
i think we have problems
 
01:15:01.669 --> 01:15:01.679 align:start position:0%
when we try to address a singular
 
01:15:07.110 --> 01:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:09.590 --> 01:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
on my notes
 
01:15:11.510 --> 01:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
the police were called in this
 
01:15:13.830 --> 01:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
particular situation
 
01:15:15.990 --> 01:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
and the information was gathered and
 
01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:20.709 align:start position:0%
and the information was gathered and
exchanged

01:15:20.709 --> 01:15:20.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:21.990 --> 01:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
i guess that's the way it should be
 
01:15:25.270 --> 01:15:25.280 align:start position:0%
handled if people have a problem with
 
01:15:26.470 --> 01:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
some dog
 
01:15:29.030 --> 01:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
viciously attacking them or or their
 
01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:30.070 align:start position:0%
viciously attacking them or or their
property

01:15:30.070 --> 01:15:30.080 align:start position:0%
property
 
01:15:32.470 --> 01:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
then you call the police
 
01:15:35.990 --> 01:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:38.550 --> 01:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
i don't see any value to to passing this
 
01:15:48.550 --> 01:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:50.149 --> 01:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
we'll see we'll see how this goes and we
 
01:15:52.070 --> 01:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
may we may have to
 
01:15:54.470 --> 01:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
make some accommodations
 
01:15:56.149 --> 01:15:56.159 align:start position:0%

01:21:33.590 --> 01:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
this time we'll now close the executive
 
01:22:21.430 --> 01:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:23.830 --> 01:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
just for a point of clarification hb
 
01:22:26.870 --> 01:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
1539 was noticed for a
 
01:22:30.070 --> 01:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:31.830 --> 01:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
i'm fairly confident that i probably
 
01:22:33.669 --> 01:22:33.679 align:start position:0%
advise the
 
01:22:33.679 --> 01:22:34.950 align:start position:0%
advise the
committee

01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:22:37.110 --> 01:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
assistant to help schedule that however
 
01:22:39.910 --> 01:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
we already exact that bill
 
01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:42.149 align:start position:0%
we already exact that bill
so

01:22:42.149 --> 01:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:22:45.350 --> 01:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
hp 1539 okay
 
01:22:47.590 --> 01:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
that we did that back in january so i
 
01:22:49.510 --> 01:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
apologize for to the public for that
 
01:22:51.030 --> 01:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
confusion but
 
01:22:52.629 --> 01:22:52.639 align:start position:0%
i'm going to simply open the executive
 
01:22:55.030 --> 01:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
session then reclose it if just a as a
 
01:22:56.149 --> 01:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
sake of
 
01:22:58.149 --> 01:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
procedural representative boarding you
 
01:23:00.790 --> 01:23:00.800 align:start position:0%
recognized him ah thank you i
 
01:23:03.030 --> 01:23:03.040 align:start position:0%
agree that we have executive bill
 
01:23:05.350 --> 01:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
however if we look at the docket for the
 
01:23:08.470 --> 01:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
bill it is not
 
01:23:10.550 --> 01:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
recorded that we executed the bill in
 
01:23:11.910 --> 01:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
fact it's
 
01:23:13.830 --> 01:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
recorded that we are
 
01:23:15.590 --> 01:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
executing it today
 
01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:18.470 align:start position:0%
executing it today
so

01:23:18.470 --> 01:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:20.950 --> 01:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
somehow that information was misplaced
 
01:23:23.189 --> 01:23:23.199 align:start position:0%
or never got to the clerk
 
01:23:26.070 --> 01:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
so so when a bill once we
 
01:23:29.030 --> 01:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
have a vote on in an executive session
 
01:23:36.629 --> 01:23:36.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:37.990 --> 01:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
bear with me one moment
 
01:23:38.000 --> 01:24:03.189 align:start position:0%
bear with me one moment
certainly

01:24:03.189 --> 01:24:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:04.870 --> 01:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
so once an executive session is
 
01:24:08.390 --> 01:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:09.590 --> 01:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
the clerk
 
01:24:11.189 --> 01:24:11.199 align:start position:0%
of the committee will hold on to the
 
01:24:11.199 --> 01:24:12.390 align:start position:0%
of the committee will hold on to the
bill

01:24:12.390 --> 01:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:24:15.030 --> 01:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
once it's delivered to the house clerk
 
01:24:16.790 --> 01:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
that's when the bill officially leaves
 
01:24:18.870 --> 01:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
the committee but once the bill until
 
01:24:21.590 --> 01:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
the bill officially leaves the committee
 
01:24:23.750 --> 01:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
the committee is free to
 
01:24:26.229 --> 01:24:26.239 align:start position:0%
reopen the executive session and
 
01:24:28.830 --> 01:24:28.840 align:start position:0%
reconsider any anything that was done
 
01:24:33.510 --> 01:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:34.870 --> 01:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
i'm going to open it and just merely
 
01:24:36.790 --> 01:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
close it
 
01:24:38.149 --> 01:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
because we've already voted on it and
 
01:24:40.229 --> 01:24:40.239 align:start position:0%
i'm not inclined to recognize anyone for
 
01:24:42.310 --> 01:24:42.320 align:start position:0%
reconsideration but it is scheduled for
 
01:24:45.030 --> 01:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
today so for the sake of
 
01:24:46.390 --> 01:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
calendar purposes i think it'd be
 
01:24:47.830 --> 01:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate to
 
01:24:50.149 --> 01:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
open and then close
 
01:24:53.830 --> 01:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:20.229 --> 01:25:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:26.229 --> 01:25:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:28.629 --> 01:25:28.639 align:start position:0%
i guess it's a procedural question
 
01:25:31.030 --> 01:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
so why are we opening it we've already
 
01:25:32.870 --> 01:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
done it
 
01:25:34.950 --> 01:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
it's been notified
 
01:25:38.070 --> 01:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
i'll be honest i'm going to open it
 
01:25:39.990 --> 01:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
the executive session for about two
 
01:25:42.470 --> 01:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
seconds and then close it i just wanted
 
01:25:44.629 --> 01:25:44.639 align:start position:0%
it is notice for a hearing today so i
 
01:25:46.310 --> 01:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
feel it's appropriate to just
 
01:25:47.750 --> 01:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
open and close it so it's not kind of
 
01:25:49.590 --> 01:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
hanging in the wind because technically
 
01:25:50.870 --> 01:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
if let's say
 
01:25:52.790 --> 01:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
some people left the room i could reopen
 
01:25:54.950 --> 01:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
it then we could actually
 
01:25:56.790 --> 01:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
reconsider it if
 
01:25:58.070 --> 01:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
suppose i was one of the seven that
 
01:25:59.430 --> 01:25:59.440 align:start position:0%
didn't want it
 
01:26:01.270 --> 01:26:01.280 align:start position:0%
in explain to legislate so i think it's
 
01:26:03.030 --> 01:26:03.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the members present and
 
01:26:05.189 --> 01:26:05.199 align:start position:0%
for the public here to
 
01:26:05.199 --> 01:26:06.950 align:start position:0%
for the public here to
just

01:26:06.950 --> 01:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:26:09.030 --> 01:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
get clean up clean up the notice here
 
01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:09.750 align:start position:0%
get clean up clean up the notice here
and

01:26:09.750 --> 01:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:26:13.189 --> 01:26:13.199 align:start position:0%
cancel each one out one by one so
 
01:26:14.790 --> 01:26:14.800 align:start position:0%
that's i'm not sure i'm required to do
 
01:26:16.310 --> 01:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
that but i think it's in the it's just
 
01:26:17.990 --> 01:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
for transparency purposes let's just do
 
01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:19.830 align:start position:0%
for transparency purposes let's just do
it

01:26:19.830 --> 01:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:26:21.430 --> 01:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
representative newman
 
01:26:23.669 --> 01:26:23.679 align:start position:0%
just for the information of the chair
 
01:26:25.669 --> 01:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
i wrote the um
 
01:26:27.510 --> 01:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
minority report for this bill there was
 
01:26:29.350 --> 01:26:29.360 align:start position:0%
mention of an amendment there is no
 
01:26:32.310 --> 01:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
amendment forthcoming and so i agree
 
01:26:34.830 --> 01:26:34.840 align:start position:0%
with the what the chair is attempting to
 
01:26:36.790 --> 01:26:36.800 align:start position:0%
do so
 
01:26:38.310 --> 01:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
at this time we will now open the
 
01:26:41.590 --> 01:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
executive session house bill 1539
 
01:26:42.950 --> 01:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
relative to the removal of certain
 
01:26:44.229 --> 01:26:44.239 align:start position:0%
information from the new hampshire state
 
01:26:45.830 --> 01:26:45.840 align:start position:0%

and this time we'll now
 
01:26:49.669 --> 01:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
close the executive session house bill
 
01:26:49.679 --> 01:27:07.350 align:start position:0%
close the executive session house bill

01:27:10.070 --> 01:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
question for the chair
 
01:27:11.750 --> 01:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
representative marston you're recognized
 
01:27:13.990 --> 01:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
thank you why was the
 
01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:14.910 align:start position:0%
thank you why was the
bill

01:27:14.910 --> 01:27:14.920 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:27:18.070 --> 01:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
1539 held by the i'm assuming the
 
01:27:21.430 --> 01:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
secretary in the office
 
01:27:23.350 --> 01:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
was it an oversight or was it for a
 
01:27:27.669 --> 01:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:29.030 --> 01:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
it wasn't held
 
01:27:30.950 --> 01:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
i'm going to be honest i didn't inquire
 
01:27:33.110 --> 01:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
i i'm pretty sure i
 
01:27:36.149 --> 01:27:36.159 align:start position:0%
gave a list of everything to notice and
 
01:27:38.870 --> 01:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
perhaps through my own oversight
 
01:27:40.709 --> 01:27:40.719 align:start position:0%
trying not to throw myself under the bus
 
01:27:45.030 --> 01:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:46.790 --> 01:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
no problem you're forgiven
 
01:27:49.270 --> 01:27:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:50.470 --> 01:27:50.480 align:start position:0%
and this time we'll now open the
 
01:27:52.229 --> 01:27:52.239 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
01:27:52.239 --> 01:27:53.590 align:start position:0%
executive session
on

01:27:53.590 --> 01:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:27:55.270 --> 01:27:55.280 align:start position:0%
house bill 1215 relative to the
 
01:27:56.790 --> 01:27:56.800 align:start position:0%
definition of residual amount in the
 
01:28:03.990 --> 01:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:08.149 --> 01:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:09.669 --> 01:28:09.679 align:start position:0%
representative roy you you're so
 
01:28:09.679 --> 01:28:11.830 align:start position:0%
representative roy you you're so
recognized

01:28:11.830 --> 01:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
01:28:14.229 --> 01:28:14.239 align:start position:0%
thank you um i'd like to make a motion
 
01:28:20.950 --> 01:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:22.310 --> 01:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
that's been seconded by representative
 
01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:26.470 align:start position:0%
that's been seconded by representative
wallace

01:28:26.470 --> 01:28:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:27.669 --> 01:28:27.679 align:start position:0%
representative roy you recognize to
 
01:28:29.830 --> 01:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
speak on your motion thank you
 
01:28:31.830 --> 01:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
um i understand what the sponsor was
 
01:28:34.790 --> 01:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
trying to do but the this this bill as
 
01:28:37.430 --> 01:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
written um even with an amendment that
 
01:28:38.950 --> 01:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
was proposed
 
01:28:42.229 --> 01:28:42.239 align:start position:0%
would um it has far-reaching effects the
 
01:28:44.149 --> 01:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
original bill as written would have made
 
01:28:49.030 --> 01:28:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:50.790 --> 01:28:50.800 align:start position:0%
it would have made it a uh
 
01:28:53.110 --> 01:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
what is an infraction
 
01:28:55.030 --> 01:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
a residual amount
 
01:28:57.990 --> 01:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
so a gram of fentanyl could kill
 
01:29:00.629 --> 01:29:00.639 align:start position:0%
everybody in this room several times
 
01:29:03.110 --> 01:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
um so we we certainly don't want to be
 
01:29:04.629 --> 01:29:04.639 align:start position:0%
in the business of
 
01:29:06.950 --> 01:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
making that a residual amount
 
01:29:08.629 --> 01:29:08.639 align:start position:0%
furthermore even if you took the
 
01:29:10.709 --> 01:29:10.719 align:start position:0%
fentanyl out of it
 
01:29:12.310 --> 01:29:12.320 align:start position:0%
the effect it would have on the existing
 
01:29:14.950 --> 01:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
statutory scheme where we have
 
01:29:16.950 --> 01:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
certain penalties for certain amounts of
 
01:29:20.310 --> 01:29:20.320 align:start position:0%
certain classes of controlled substances
 
01:29:21.990 --> 01:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
it would throw that into chaos for
 
01:29:24.629 --> 01:29:24.639 align:start position:0%
example cocaine has a certain amount of
 
01:29:24.639 --> 01:29:26.070 align:start position:0%
example cocaine has a certain amount of
um

01:29:26.070 --> 01:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:27.910 --> 01:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
for for a gram of cocaine you could get
 
01:29:30.629 --> 01:29:30.639 align:start position:0%
up to i believe it was 15 years
 
01:29:32.310 --> 01:29:32.320 align:start position:0%
this could turn it into a residual
 
01:29:34.790 --> 01:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
amount so it would affect all the entire
 
01:29:37.110 --> 01:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
statutory scheme that's currently in
 
01:29:38.950 --> 01:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
place with regard to controlled
 
01:29:40.790 --> 01:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
substances and amounts
 
01:29:43.189 --> 01:29:43.199 align:start position:0%
um if those need adjusting then that's
 
01:29:45.830 --> 01:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
worthy of debate but a one piece bill
 
01:29:47.910 --> 01:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
that says all these things are suddenly
 
01:29:50.149 --> 01:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
residual amounts would throw our current
 
01:29:52.390 --> 01:29:52.400 align:start position:0%
uh statutory scheme in the chaos
 
01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:53.350 align:start position:0%
uh statutory scheme in the chaos
um

01:29:53.350 --> 01:29:53.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:55.270 --> 01:29:55.280 align:start position:0%
so this this bill the intention is great
 
01:29:58.229 --> 01:29:58.239 align:start position:0%
but it's it's not nearly ready for us to
 
01:30:07.590 --> 01:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:09.830 --> 01:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
representative conley thank you
 
01:30:11.669 --> 01:30:11.679 align:start position:0%
representative roy does
 
01:30:13.110 --> 01:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
specifically with the fentanyl make a
 
01:30:15.270 --> 01:30:15.280 align:start position:0%
good point however this committee and i
 
01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:16.310 align:start position:0%
good point however this committee and i
believe

01:30:16.310 --> 01:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
believe
 
01:30:19.430 --> 01:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
this committee in past terms has really
 
01:30:21.590 --> 01:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
struggled with how to
 
01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:23.350 align:start position:0%
struggled with how to
address

01:30:23.350 --> 01:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
address
 
01:30:25.590 --> 01:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
small quantities of drugs and the
 
01:30:27.669 --> 01:30:27.679 align:start position:0%
punishment for that we've we passed a
 
01:30:29.590 --> 01:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
bill last year
 
01:30:31.590 --> 01:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
that would have done that that ran into
 
01:30:33.189 --> 01:30:33.199 align:start position:0%
challenges in the other body but the way
 
01:30:34.709 --> 01:30:34.719 align:start position:0%
the current statue is written it's like
 
01:30:37.189 --> 01:30:37.199 align:start position:0%
a frankenstein monster of so trying to
 
01:30:37.199 --> 01:30:38.629 align:start position:0%
a frankenstein monster of so trying to
decouple

01:30:38.629 --> 01:30:38.639 align:start position:0%
decouple
 
01:30:41.110 --> 01:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
the quantities and punishments uh
 
01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:42.470 align:start position:0%
the quantities and punishments uh
without

01:30:42.470 --> 01:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
without
 
01:30:45.350 --> 01:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
allowing drug dealers to get off as well
 
01:30:46.830 --> 01:30:46.840 align:start position:0%
is hard to do and
 
01:30:49.590 --> 01:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
this addresses that and i wonder if it
 
01:30:49.600 --> 01:30:50.950 align:start position:0%
this addresses that and i wonder if it
could

01:30:50.950 --> 01:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:30:53.910 --> 01:30:53.920 align:start position:0%
by fixing the fentanyl point maybe
 
01:30:55.110 --> 01:30:55.120 align:start position:0%
maybe get through and it's also worth
 
01:30:56.950 --> 01:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
noting this was proposed
 
01:30:58.950 --> 01:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
and supported not by
 
01:31:02.790 --> 01:31:02.800 align:start position:0%
or by a county attorney who uh asked for
 
01:31:03.910 --> 01:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
this so
 
01:31:05.830 --> 01:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
i do think there's merit here
 
01:31:12.470 --> 01:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:14.229 --> 01:31:14.239 align:start position:0%
representative rory
 
01:31:17.750 --> 01:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
i i agree um but the cocaine point is
 
01:31:19.910 --> 01:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
also a question i mean it says a gram of
 
01:31:21.669 --> 01:31:21.679 align:start position:0%
cocaine or less would be a residual
 
01:31:23.830 --> 01:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
amount but the other statute has
 
01:31:25.990 --> 01:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
significant jail time for it
 
01:31:28.070 --> 01:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
so we would we would set up conflicts in
 
01:31:29.990 --> 01:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
all the statutes if we're going to do
 
01:31:31.990 --> 01:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
this we need to do a right and address
 
01:31:34.070 --> 01:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
each and every statute i just don't
 
01:31:35.910 --> 01:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
think we can do it with one bill that
 
01:31:38.149 --> 01:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
would just cause conflicts across it i i
 
01:31:40.870 --> 01:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
agree with my my friend
 
01:31:42.709 --> 01:31:42.719 align:start position:0%
but i just don't think this piece of
 
01:31:44.470 --> 01:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
legislation is is
 
01:31:48.470 --> 01:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:50.390 --> 01:31:50.400 align:start position:0%
i think the clear for clarification is
 
01:31:53.030 --> 01:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
that one gram of a substance depending
 
01:31:55.030 --> 01:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
on the substance is very different
 
01:31:56.629 --> 01:31:56.639 align:start position:0%
so perhaps
 
01:31:59.830 --> 01:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
going by a measurement or weight is not
 
01:32:01.590 --> 01:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
not necessarily
 
01:32:04.070 --> 01:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
how this should be approached
 
01:32:04.080 --> 01:32:05.189 align:start position:0%
how this should be approached
and

01:32:05.189 --> 01:32:05.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:32:06.709 --> 01:32:06.719 align:start position:0%
we can we can do
 
01:32:08.629 --> 01:32:08.639 align:start position:0%
comparisons all day on
 
01:32:10.149 --> 01:32:10.159 align:start position:0%
on that subject but
 
01:32:12.070 --> 01:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
one gram of fentanyl is elite can be a
 
01:32:13.430 --> 01:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
lethal amount so why would that be
 
01:32:16.709 --> 01:32:16.719 align:start position:0%
considered a residual amount
 
01:32:18.470 --> 01:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
so i think what we're trying to do here
 
01:32:18.480 --> 01:32:19.750 align:start position:0%
so i think what we're trying to do here
is

01:32:19.750 --> 01:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:32:21.910 --> 01:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
and not forget about the opioid issue
 
01:32:23.750 --> 01:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
that's going on in the state so
 
01:32:26.310 --> 01:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
if anyone has any comments
 
01:32:28.310 --> 01:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
at this time we can
 
01:32:30.310 --> 01:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
representative marston
 
01:32:31.990 --> 01:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:32:34.950 --> 01:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
if if i'm not mistaken
 
01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:35.750 align:start position:0%
if if i'm not mistaken
the

01:32:35.750 --> 01:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:32:38.229 --> 01:32:38.239 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of this bill did not show
 
01:32:41.510 --> 01:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
up for the hearing and at some point he
 
01:32:43.189 --> 01:32:43.199 align:start position:0%
kind of gave an indication that he
 
01:32:45.189 --> 01:32:45.199 align:start position:0%
wanted to withdraw it which couldn't
 
01:32:47.750 --> 01:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
happen but
 
01:32:49.350 --> 01:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't believe that was that
 
01:32:51.110 --> 01:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
was this this bill
 
01:32:53.030 --> 01:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:32:56.950 --> 01:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
that may have been hb1025
 
01:33:00.950 --> 01:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:02.390 --> 01:33:02.400 align:start position:0%
and this time
 
01:33:04.149 --> 01:33:04.159 align:start position:0%
you can now move the question if you're
 
01:33:06.229 --> 01:33:06.239 align:start position:0%
in support of the motion of the nxp
 
01:33:10.070 --> 01:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
legislative hospital 1215 please say yay
 
01:33:12.070 --> 01:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
if you are opposed
 
01:33:13.830 --> 01:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
please say nay the clerk would not call
 
01:33:14.709 --> 01:33:14.719 align:start position:0%
the role
 
01:33:16.229 --> 01:33:16.239 align:start position:0%
vice chairman roy
 
01:33:16.239 --> 01:33:17.110 align:start position:0%

that's scheduled on friday
 
01:36:40.149 --> 01:36:40.159 align:start position:0%
uh it was supposed to be last friday but
 
01:36:41.350 --> 01:36:41.360 align:start position:0%
i feel like every time we schedule a
 
01:36:43.350 --> 01:36:43.360 align:start position:0%
subcommittee we get
 
01:36:47.030 --> 01:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
a snowstorm over a foot of snow so
 
01:36:48.790 --> 01:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
would that
 
01:36:50.470 --> 01:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not the one scheduling but
 
01:36:54.550 --> 01:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:56.550 --> 01:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
there is there is two different
 
01:36:58.390 --> 01:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
amendments that have been
 
01:36:58.400 --> 01:36:59.510 align:start position:0%
amendments that have been
prepared

01:36:59.510 --> 01:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
prepared
 
01:37:01.750 --> 01:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
representative welch has reviewed them
 
01:37:02.950 --> 01:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
and they are
 
01:37:07.590 --> 01:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:09.990 --> 01:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
is there any work that the subcommittee
 
01:37:12.709 --> 01:37:12.719 align:start position:0%
needs wishes to
 
01:37:15.590 --> 01:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
accomplish or discuss or do
 
01:37:16.629 --> 01:37:16.639 align:start position:0%
do you believe that that amendment's
 
01:37:18.550 --> 01:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
ready to be
 
01:37:21.830 --> 01:37:21.840 align:start position:0%

01:37:49.510 --> 01:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
so what we'll do is we'll make sure
 
01:37:51.510 --> 01:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
everyone on that subcommittee has a copy
 
01:37:53.030 --> 01:37:53.040 align:start position:0%

01:48:19.430 --> 01:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
if the members of the committee can take
 
01:48:35.830 --> 01:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:37.910 --> 01:48:37.920 align:start position:0%

what this bill does
 
01:49:22.149 --> 01:49:22.159 align:start position:0%
this bill prohibits
 
01:49:22.159 --> 01:49:23.270 align:start position:0%
this bill prohibits
any

01:49:23.270 --> 01:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:49:25.109 --> 01:49:25.119 align:start position:0%
the state or any subdivision of the
 
01:49:27.750 --> 01:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
state for making a law or policy
 
01:49:29.510 --> 01:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
that would prohibit
 
01:49:33.270 --> 01:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
law enforcement from cooperating with
 
01:49:35.350 --> 01:49:35.360 align:start position:0%
the immigration enforcement
 
01:49:37.270 --> 01:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
of the federal government for a person
 
01:49:39.430 --> 01:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
who is already in custody for a
 
01:49:42.310 --> 01:49:42.320 align:start position:0%
violation of state law
 
01:49:44.070 --> 01:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
that means
 
01:49:46.149 --> 01:49:46.159 align:start position:0%
if someone is arrested
 
01:49:47.350 --> 01:49:47.360 align:start position:0%
on any
 
01:49:49.669 --> 01:49:49.679 align:start position:0%
state law violation be it oui domestic
 
01:49:52.149 --> 01:49:52.159 align:start position:0%
violence what what have you
 
01:49:54.229 --> 01:49:54.239 align:start position:0%
and they book that person
 
01:49:56.070 --> 01:49:56.080 align:start position:0%
and it pops up there's an ice detainer
 
01:49:58.629 --> 01:49:58.639 align:start position:0%
on that person
 
01:50:01.030 --> 01:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
the police are not
 
01:50:01.040 --> 01:50:02.310 align:start position:0%
the police are not
prohibited

01:50:02.310 --> 01:50:02.320 align:start position:0%
prohibited
 
01:50:05.910 --> 01:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
from cooperating and notifying ice
 
01:50:07.510 --> 01:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
this does not mandate that police
 
01:50:09.669 --> 01:50:09.679 align:start position:0%
cooperate and contact ice this just says
 
01:50:11.430 --> 01:50:11.440 align:start position:0%
that the town or municipality or the
 
01:50:13.350 --> 01:50:13.360 align:start position:0%
department cannot have a policy that
 
01:50:17.270 --> 01:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:17.280 --> 01:50:19.030 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:50:19.030 --> 01:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:20.709 --> 01:50:20.719 align:start position:0%
and i think that that basically it's
 
01:50:23.589 --> 01:50:23.599 align:start position:0%
it's all it does is prevent
 
01:50:23.599 --> 01:50:25.430 align:start position:0%
it's all it does is prevent
any

01:50:25.430 --> 01:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:50:27.830 --> 01:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
policy that says that we're not going to
 
01:50:30.310 --> 01:50:30.320 align:start position:0%
cooperate with immigration
 
01:50:31.750 --> 01:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
it leaves it where it belongs in the
 
01:50:33.510 --> 01:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
hands of the police department
 
01:50:37.030 --> 01:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
and only again i repeat only
 
01:50:39.270 --> 01:50:39.280 align:start position:0%
affects someone who's been arrested for
 
01:50:41.589 --> 01:50:41.599 align:start position:0%
a violation of state law this does not
 
01:50:43.830 --> 01:50:43.840 align:start position:0%
allow new hampshire law enforcement to
 
01:50:45.589 --> 01:50:45.599 align:start position:0%
go around enforcing or questioning
 
01:50:48.149 --> 01:50:48.159 align:start position:0%
people's immigration status or harass
 
01:50:48.159 --> 01:50:49.189 align:start position:0%
people's immigration status or harass
anybody

01:50:49.189 --> 01:50:49.199 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
01:50:51.109 --> 01:50:51.119 align:start position:0%
all it means is if someone gets arrested
 
01:50:53.030 --> 01:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
on something else and during the booking
 
01:50:53.040 --> 01:50:54.310 align:start position:0%
on something else and during the booking
process

01:50:54.310 --> 01:50:54.320 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:50:56.629 --> 01:50:56.639 align:start position:0%
ice detainer pops up in the system
 
01:50:58.950 --> 01:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
they are able to cooperate and contact
 
01:50:58.960 --> 01:51:00.310 align:start position:0%
they are able to cooperate and contact
immigration

01:51:00.310 --> 01:51:00.320 align:start position:0%
immigration
 
01:51:06.629 --> 01:51:06.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:08.470 --> 01:51:08.480 align:start position:0%

01:51:14.239 --> 01:51:15.109 align:start position:0%

uh political order
 
01:51:29.430 --> 01:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
law enforcement ready has the right to
 
01:51:31.270 --> 01:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
do whatever they want as far as

01:51:41.750 --> 01:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:51:45.030 --> 01:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
for example county officials
 
01:51:47.910 --> 01:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
did not want the sheriff's department to
 
01:51:47.920 --> 01:51:48.950 align:start position:0%
did not want the sheriff's department to
enforce

01:51:48.950 --> 01:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
enforce
 
01:51:51.430 --> 01:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
our detainment of people
 
01:51:54.070 --> 01:51:54.080 align:start position:0%
because they felt that
 
01:51:56.470 --> 01:51:56.480 align:start position:0%
it would
 
01:51:56.480 --> 01:51:57.430 align:start position:0%
it would
affect

01:51:57.430 --> 01:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
affect
 
01:51:57.440 --> 01:51:58.390 align:start position:0%
affect
the

01:51:58.390 --> 01:51:58.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:52:02.629 --> 01:52:02.639 align:start position:0%
ability of law enforcement to
 
01:52:02.639 --> 01:52:04.310 align:start position:0%
ability of law enforcement to
enter

01:52:04.310 --> 01:52:04.320 align:start position:0%
enter
 
01:52:05.990 --> 01:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
areas that
 
01:52:09.830 --> 01:52:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:09.840 --> 01:52:10.790 align:start position:0%
 
with

01:52:10.790 --> 01:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:52:13.270 --> 01:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
people that were had immigrated from
 
01:52:15.830 --> 01:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
other countries whether
 
01:52:17.589 --> 01:52:17.599 align:start position:0%
legally or not
 
01:52:17.599 --> 01:52:18.870 align:start position:0%
legally or not
and

01:52:18.870 --> 01:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:52:18.880 --> 01:52:19.910 align:start position:0%
and
if

01:52:19.910 --> 01:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:52:22.390 --> 01:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
for example law enforcement
 
01:52:24.870 --> 01:52:24.880 align:start position:0%
was not welcome in that area
 
01:52:24.880 --> 01:52:26.229 align:start position:0%
was not welcome in that area
then

01:52:26.229 --> 01:52:26.239 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:52:28.790 --> 01:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
that might be a problem with
 
01:52:31.910 --> 01:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
becoming a crime center because
 
01:52:34.390 --> 01:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
crime could proliferate where law
 
01:52:37.189 --> 01:52:37.199 align:start position:0%
enforcement is not allowed
 
01:52:38.390 --> 01:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
so i'm
 
01:52:40.629 --> 01:52:40.639 align:start position:0%
even though i really think that the
 
01:52:42.790 --> 01:52:42.800 align:start position:0%
amendment is an improvement i really
 
01:52:45.430 --> 01:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
think that the bill needs to be itl
 
01:52:49.510 --> 01:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:52.229 --> 01:52:52.239 align:start position:0%
representative conley
 
01:52:53.910 --> 01:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:52:55.750 --> 01:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate the effort that the vice
 
01:52:57.910 --> 01:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
chair put into this amendment he and i
 
01:52:59.510 --> 01:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
have discussed this
 
01:53:01.830 --> 01:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
several times and i think had
 
01:53:01.840 --> 01:53:03.270 align:start position:0%
several times and i think had
fruitful

01:53:03.270 --> 01:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
fruitful
 
01:53:05.350 --> 01:53:05.360 align:start position:0%
discussions um
 
01:53:07.030 --> 01:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
a couple things come to mind though one
 
01:53:08.550 --> 01:53:08.560 align:start position:0%
there's no penalty
 
01:53:11.510 --> 01:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
so if somebody were to violate this
 
01:53:12.870 --> 01:53:12.880 align:start position:0%
i don't know what happens i guess
 
01:53:12.880 --> 01:53:17.189 align:start position:0%
i don't know what happens i guess
nothing

01:53:17.189 --> 01:53:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:17.199 --> 01:53:19.270 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:53:19.270 --> 01:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:53:21.589 --> 01:53:21.599 align:start position:0%
for folks who would likely be affected
 
01:53:23.350 --> 01:53:23.360 align:start position:0%
by this
 
01:53:27.270 --> 01:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
although it's limited to being arrested
 
01:53:30.709 --> 01:53:30.719 align:start position:0%
the primary way undocumented folks
 
01:53:32.149 --> 01:53:32.159 align:start position:0%
encounter law enforcement is through a
 
01:53:33.830 --> 01:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle infraction
 
01:53:36.790 --> 01:53:36.800 align:start position:0%
things like an uninspected vehicle
 
01:53:38.870 --> 01:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
driving without a license so forth those
 
01:53:43.109 --> 01:53:43.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:44.950 --> 01:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
typically dealt with immediately they're
 
01:53:46.709 --> 01:53:46.719 align:start position:0%
not necessarily brought to the station
 
01:53:48.229 --> 01:53:48.239 align:start position:0%
those are arrests
 
01:53:51.510 --> 01:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
and finally just going back to what
 
01:53:53.189 --> 01:53:53.199 align:start position:0%
we heard in a different debate around
 
01:53:56.870 --> 01:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
firearms in the state when the committee
 
01:53:59.669 --> 01:53:59.679 align:start position:0%
voted to do exactly the opposite of what
 
01:54:02.390 --> 01:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
the broader intent of this bill would do
 
01:54:02.400 --> 01:54:03.189 align:start position:0%
the broader intent of this bill would do
is

01:54:03.189 --> 01:54:03.199 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:54:04.950 --> 01:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
again quoting alan rice one of the more
 
01:54:07.270 --> 01:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
conservative people in our state
 
01:54:09.830 --> 01:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
state police enforce state laws
 
01:54:13.109 --> 01:54:13.119 align:start position:0%
federal police enforce federal laws
 
01:54:14.629 --> 01:54:14.639 align:start position:0%
if it's good enough for one part of the
 
01:54:15.830 --> 01:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
law it should be good enough for the
 
01:54:22.390 --> 01:54:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:22.400 --> 01:54:23.589 align:start position:0%
 
rory

01:54:23.589 --> 01:54:23.599 align:start position:0%
rory
 
01:54:26.149 --> 01:54:26.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and i i thank the
 
01:54:28.390 --> 01:54:28.400 align:start position:0%
um the gentleman for his uh kind of
 
01:54:30.310 --> 01:54:30.320 align:start position:0%
remarks on regarding our cooperation on
 
01:54:30.320 --> 01:54:31.109 align:start position:0%
remarks on regarding our cooperation on
the

01:54:31.109 --> 01:54:31.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:54:33.350 --> 01:54:33.360 align:start position:0%
uh spirit of the bill i i would simply
 
01:54:35.350 --> 01:54:35.360 align:start position:0%
point out that
 
01:54:36.950 --> 01:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
this does not
 
01:54:36.960 --> 01:54:38.390 align:start position:0%
this does not
authorize

01:54:38.390 --> 01:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
authorize
 
01:54:40.310 --> 01:54:40.320 align:start position:0%
state or local law enforcement to quote
 
01:54:43.189 --> 01:54:43.199 align:start position:0%
unquote enforce federal law
 
01:54:45.189 --> 01:54:45.199 align:start position:0%
all it does again
 
01:54:47.589 --> 01:54:47.599 align:start position:0%
this is after they've been arrested and
 
01:54:48.870 --> 01:54:48.880 align:start position:0%
they've been brought to the police
 
01:54:51.030 --> 01:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
station and they are being booked
 
01:54:52.709 --> 01:54:52.719 align:start position:0%
and their information is entered into
 
01:54:54.149 --> 01:54:54.159 align:start position:0%
the leap system
 
01:54:57.830 --> 01:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
and a detainer pops up from ice
 
01:54:59.350 --> 01:54:59.360 align:start position:0%
they are not
 
01:55:03.350 --> 01:55:03.360 align:start position:0%
prohibited from contacting ice by a
 
01:55:03.360 --> 01:55:05.189 align:start position:0%
prohibited from contacting ice by a
local

01:55:05.189 --> 01:55:05.199 align:start position:0%
local
 
01:55:07.030 --> 01:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
subdivision of the state
 
01:55:08.870 --> 01:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
for example if a town
 
01:55:11.109 --> 01:55:11.119 align:start position:0%
says we are a sanctuary city for
 
01:55:13.270 --> 01:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
undocumented immigrants
 
01:55:14.709 --> 01:55:14.719 align:start position:0%
they cannot prohibit the police
 
01:55:16.310 --> 01:55:16.320 align:start position:0%
department if someone's under arrest
 
01:55:18.070 --> 01:55:18.080 align:start position:0%
from honoring the ice detainer they're
 
01:55:20.310 --> 01:55:20.320 align:start position:0%
not enforcing the law all they're saying
 
01:55:22.550 --> 01:55:22.560 align:start position:0%
is okay we will contact ice and hold
 
01:55:24.390 --> 01:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
them until they come and get them
 
01:55:26.310 --> 01:55:26.320 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mandate that they do that it
 
01:55:28.070 --> 01:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
just says they cannot be prohibited from
 
01:55:33.750 --> 01:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
doing that by a a political body um
 
01:55:36.470 --> 01:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
there's a distinct difference between
 
01:55:39.270 --> 01:55:39.280 align:start position:0%
the firearms issue where we said
 
01:55:40.950 --> 01:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
we didn't want
 
01:55:42.950 --> 01:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
local and state law enforcement from
 
01:55:46.070 --> 01:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
going out and enforcing federal law i.e
 
01:55:47.750 --> 01:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
arresting people for violations of
 
01:55:48.950 --> 01:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
01:55:50.550 --> 01:55:50.560 align:start position:0%
versus someone who's already been
 
01:55:50.560 --> 01:55:51.990 align:start position:0%
versus someone who's already been
arrested

01:55:51.990 --> 01:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
arrested
 
01:55:53.910 --> 01:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
and there's
 
01:55:56.950 --> 01:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
a warrant if you will a detainer
 
01:55:59.030 --> 01:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
saying that the federal government would
 
01:56:00.709 --> 01:56:00.719 align:start position:0%
like to see these people and speak to
 
01:56:02.390 --> 01:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
them because they missed a court date or
 
01:56:03.669 --> 01:56:03.679 align:start position:0%
what have you
 
01:56:06.470 --> 01:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
um so they're they're apples and oranges
 
01:56:09.510 --> 01:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
um and again with regard to the penalty
 
01:56:11.270 --> 01:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
it's difficult to assign a criminal
 
01:56:13.910 --> 01:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
penalty to a municipality
 
01:56:15.750 --> 01:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
the fact that the law says you shall not
 
01:56:17.510 --> 01:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
do it um
 
01:56:19.350 --> 01:56:19.360 align:start position:0%
in and of itself i mean we are a nation
 
01:56:20.470 --> 01:56:20.480 align:start position:0%
of laws
 
01:56:20.480 --> 01:56:21.669 align:start position:0%
of laws
and

01:56:21.669 --> 01:56:21.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:56:23.910 --> 01:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
to to to have someone or a municipality
 
01:56:26.229 --> 01:56:26.239 align:start position:0%
just flout the law if they do that then
 
01:56:27.830 --> 01:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
we may have to readdress it but at this
 
01:56:29.430 --> 01:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
point i think just saying that you can't
 
01:56:32.470 --> 01:56:32.480 align:start position:0%
do it should be enough
 
01:56:35.430 --> 01:56:35.440 align:start position:0%
that government agencies
 
01:56:37.510 --> 01:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
not consciously violate the law thank
 
01:56:37.520 --> 01:56:38.870 align:start position:0%
not consciously violate the law thank
you

01:56:38.870 --> 01:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:56:42.950 --> 01:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:47.430 --> 01:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:49.350 --> 01:56:49.360 align:start position:0%
according to the way that i look at this
 
01:56:51.350 --> 01:56:51.360 align:start position:0%
bill and read the words that are on the
 
01:56:51.360 --> 01:56:53.990 align:start position:0%
bill and read the words that are on the
paper

01:56:53.990 --> 01:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:55.990 --> 01:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
it says the law shall not adopt or
 
01:56:59.189 --> 01:56:59.199 align:start position:0%
enforce any law or policy
 
01:57:00.870 --> 01:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
and then it gives a bunch of qualifiers
 
01:57:04.629 --> 01:57:04.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:08.390 --> 01:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
from cooperating that prohibits
 
01:57:10.470 --> 01:57:10.480 align:start position:0%
those people from cooperating
 
01:57:11.990 --> 01:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
with the enforcement of the federal
 
01:57:14.629 --> 01:57:14.639 align:start position:0%
immigration laws
 
01:57:16.470 --> 01:57:16.480 align:start position:0%
and we're saying that that doesn't that
 
01:57:19.589 --> 01:57:19.599 align:start position:0%
doesn't make them have to do that
 
01:57:20.709 --> 01:57:20.719 align:start position:0%
but when
 
01:57:22.709 --> 01:57:22.719 align:start position:0%
a police department or anybody who is
 
01:57:25.990 --> 01:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
enforcing laws as i understand it
 
01:57:29.350 --> 01:57:29.360 align:start position:0%
they don't enforce laws all the time
 
01:57:29.360 --> 01:57:31.750 align:start position:0%
they don't enforce laws all the time
so

01:57:31.750 --> 01:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:33.510 --> 01:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
what i'm seeing here is they can't even
 
01:57:35.910 --> 01:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
write a policy so if they determine that
 
01:57:39.990 --> 01:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:41.990 --> 01:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
was the appropriate thing because they
 
01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:42.790 align:start position:0%
was the appropriate thing because they
were

01:57:42.790 --> 01:57:42.800 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:57:45.350 --> 01:57:45.360 align:start position:0%
putting their resources to to enforcing
 
01:57:47.270 --> 01:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
other laws
 
01:57:49.990 --> 01:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
they could not write a policy that would
 
01:57:52.470 --> 01:57:52.480 align:start position:0%
tell the people who enforce the laws
 
01:57:52.480 --> 01:57:53.669 align:start position:0%
tell the people who enforce the laws
that

01:57:53.669 --> 01:57:53.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:57:55.030 --> 01:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
there are certain laws that shouldn't be
 
01:57:56.390 --> 01:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
enforced like the speed limit there are
 
01:57:58.550 --> 01:57:58.560 align:start position:0%
policies i assume they know 50 miles
 
01:58:00.070 --> 01:58:00.080 align:start position:0%
over or whatever
 
01:58:01.750 --> 01:58:01.760 align:start position:0%
they could have that policy anymore so
 
01:58:02.870 --> 01:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
then what
 
01:58:07.510 --> 01:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:15.750 --> 01:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:17.589 --> 01:58:17.599 align:start position:0%
representative harry garth
 
01:58:21.270 --> 01:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um when i read this
 
01:58:23.510 --> 01:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
at first i thought this was a
 
01:58:26.149 --> 01:58:26.159 align:start position:0%
good amendment um but the more i look
 
01:58:27.350 --> 01:58:27.360 align:start position:0%
into it
 
01:58:29.270 --> 01:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
um it's really not doing anything
 
01:58:30.870 --> 01:58:30.880 align:start position:0%
because if you remember the original
 
01:58:30.880 --> 01:58:31.830 align:start position:0%
because if you remember the original
bill

01:58:31.830 --> 01:58:31.840 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:58:35.430 --> 01:58:35.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to enforce us to to to respond
 
01:58:37.669 --> 01:58:37.679 align:start position:0%
okay to federal laws
 
01:58:39.910 --> 01:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
all right so now this one says you have
 
01:58:42.629 --> 01:58:42.639 align:start position:0%
a choice they have a choice today
 
01:58:45.270 --> 01:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
in every city and every town
 
01:58:46.950 --> 01:58:46.960 align:start position:0%
that we have here
 
01:58:49.669 --> 01:58:49.679 align:start position:0%
so for me um
 
01:58:52.070 --> 01:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
it's not necessary to have this
 
01:58:55.030 --> 01:58:55.040 align:start position:0%
we should be itl in that original bill
 
01:58:57.350 --> 01:58:57.360 align:start position:0%
that was horrible we had we heard a lot
 
01:58:59.350 --> 01:58:59.360 align:start position:0%
of testimony that day
 
01:59:00.830 --> 01:59:00.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of
 
01:59:04.470 --> 01:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
testimony and i feel that for us to try
 
01:59:06.790 --> 01:59:06.800 align:start position:0%
to i don't know i don't even i really
 
01:59:09.669 --> 01:59:09.679 align:start position:0%
don't understand what this is doing
 
01:59:12.310 --> 01:59:12.320 align:start position:0%
but there's already policies in place
 
01:59:12.320 --> 01:59:13.109 align:start position:0%
but there's already policies in place
that

01:59:13.109 --> 01:59:13.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:59:15.109 --> 01:59:15.119 align:start position:0%
law enforcement has to do when it comes
 
01:59:15.119 --> 01:59:16.550 align:start position:0%
law enforcement has to do when it comes
to

01:59:16.550 --> 01:59:16.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:59:19.750 --> 01:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
those that are on the list
 
01:59:21.510 --> 01:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
or have a detainer
 
01:59:23.189 --> 01:59:23.199 align:start position:0%
that's already in place so what are we
 
01:59:24.470 --> 01:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
doing here
 
01:59:31.510 --> 01:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:33.589 --> 01:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
representative representative muse you
 
01:59:36.310 --> 01:59:36.320 align:start position:0%
recognized there's a couple points um
 
01:59:39.109 --> 01:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
one is that uh this bill is yet another
 
01:59:41.669 --> 01:59:41.679 align:start position:0%
attack on local control uh in new
 
01:59:41.679 --> 01:59:42.870 align:start position:0%
attack on local control uh in new
hampshire

01:59:42.870 --> 01:59:42.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:59:44.870 --> 01:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
they're not every community has large
 
01:59:47.589 --> 01:59:47.599 align:start position:0%
minority populations but mine does and
 
01:59:49.669 --> 01:59:49.679 align:start position:0%
uh nashua does and
 
01:59:52.470 --> 01:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
manchester does um
 
01:59:53.990 --> 01:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
another thing that i i just like to
 
01:59:55.589 --> 01:59:55.599 align:start position:0%
remind people and this was actually
 
01:59:57.430 --> 01:59:57.440 align:start position:0%
pointed out in the written testimony of
 
02:00:00.470 --> 02:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
the american civil liberties union not
 
02:00:01.990 --> 02:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
sure if it was actually pointed out in
 
02:00:04.790 --> 02:00:04.800 align:start position:0%
the in the oral testimony
 
02:00:06.629 --> 02:00:06.639 align:start position:0%
but i'll read it to you
 
02:00:08.149 --> 02:00:08.159 align:start position:0%
unlike criminal warrants which are
 
02:00:10.310 --> 02:00:10.320 align:start position:0%
supported by a judicial determination of
 
02:00:13.030 --> 02:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
probable cause ice detainers are issued
 
02:00:15.430 --> 02:00:15.440 align:start position:0%
by ice enforcement agents themselves
 
02:00:17.669 --> 02:00:17.679 align:start position:0%
without any authorization or oversight
 
02:00:19.990 --> 02:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
by a judge or other neutral decision
 
02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.310 align:start position:0%
by a judge or other neutral decision
maker

02:00:22.310 --> 02:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
maker
 
02:00:24.950 --> 02:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
it's well settled in law that a person's
 
02:00:26.550 --> 02:00:26.560 align:start position:0%
presence in the united states in
 
02:00:29.030 --> 02:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
violation of immigration laws standing
 
02:00:32.709 --> 02:00:32.719 align:start position:0%
alone is not a crime
 
02:00:34.950 --> 02:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
so you know what we're what we're not
 
02:00:37.589 --> 02:00:37.599 align:start position:0%
doing here is we're not
 
02:00:37.599 --> 02:00:38.390 align:start position:0%
doing here is we're not
uh

02:00:38.390 --> 02:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:00:40.870 --> 02:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
we're basically not making it impossible
 
02:00:43.589 --> 02:00:43.599 align:start position:0%
for federal agents to enforce enforce
 
02:00:45.430 --> 02:00:45.440 align:start position:0%
the law
 
02:00:47.270 --> 02:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
basically because an immigration
 
02:00:49.350 --> 02:00:49.360 align:start position:0%
detainer according to the way that i
 
02:00:51.669 --> 02:00:51.679 align:start position:0%
read this is a civil issue and not a
 
02:00:54.950 --> 02:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
matter of criminal law
 
02:00:57.589 --> 02:00:57.599 align:start position:0%
so with that in mind
 
02:00:59.750 --> 02:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
i'm going to vote against the amendment
 
02:01:02.550 --> 02:01:02.560 align:start position:0%
and vote against the bill thank you
 
02:01:04.149 --> 02:01:04.159 align:start position:0%
representative roy
 
02:01:06.070 --> 02:01:06.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:01:08.229 --> 02:01:08.239 align:start position:0%
it is well said a law that the first
 
02:01:10.310 --> 02:01:10.320 align:start position:0%
time you went to the united states
 
02:01:12.390 --> 02:01:12.400 align:start position:0%
illegally it is not a criminal offense
 
02:01:14.310 --> 02:01:14.320 align:start position:0%
however the second time in subsequent
 
02:01:16.310 --> 02:01:16.320 align:start position:0%
times are criminal offenses
 
02:01:18.870 --> 02:01:18.880 align:start position:0%
also failing to appear in court after
 
02:01:21.589 --> 02:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
being released after being detained upon
 
02:01:23.830 --> 02:01:23.840 align:start position:0%
entry is also a crime but that
 
02:01:26.070 --> 02:01:26.080 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding we're not asking anyone
 
02:01:28.629 --> 02:01:28.639 align:start position:0%
to allocate resources we're not asking
 
02:01:31.270 --> 02:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
anyone to to go out of their way
 
02:01:32.870 --> 02:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
all we're saying is if someone has
 
02:01:35.030 --> 02:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
already been arrested and is in a
 
02:01:38.070 --> 02:01:38.080 align:start position:0%
holding cell in our state and there's a
 
02:01:39.830 --> 02:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
detainer from ice
 
02:01:41.750 --> 02:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
that they not be prohibited from
 
02:01:43.430 --> 02:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
contacting ice we're not even mandating
 
02:01:44.550 --> 02:01:44.560 align:start position:0%
they do it
 
02:01:45.990 --> 02:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
with regard to the question of why are
 
02:01:47.189 --> 02:01:47.199 align:start position:0%
we doing this there are several
 
02:01:48.790 --> 02:01:48.800 align:start position:0%
municipalities within the state that
 
02:01:50.709 --> 02:01:50.719 align:start position:0%
have passed policies
 
02:01:52.870 --> 02:01:52.880 align:start position:0%
political bodies not law enforcement
 
02:01:55.109 --> 02:01:55.119 align:start position:0%
political parties that have said
 
02:01:57.510 --> 02:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
they do not want to cooperate with
 
02:01:57.520 --> 02:01:59.030 align:start position:0%
they do not want to cooperate with
immigration

02:01:59.030 --> 02:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
immigration
 
02:02:01.510 --> 02:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
so that's the reason we're doing this
 
02:02:03.189 --> 02:02:03.199 align:start position:0%
and as far as the question of whether or
 
02:02:04.950 --> 02:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
not you know ice can issue these on the
 
02:02:07.350 --> 02:02:07.360 align:start position:0%
zone that authority was delegated to
 
02:02:10.310 --> 02:02:10.320 align:start position:0%
them by the united states congress
 
02:02:10.320 --> 02:02:11.109 align:start position:0%
them by the united states congress
through

02:02:11.109 --> 02:02:11.119 align:start position:0%
through
 
02:02:12.709 --> 02:02:12.719 align:start position:0%
law they didn't just make it up on their
 
02:02:15.510 --> 02:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
own so for us to sit here and laugh at
 
02:02:17.669 --> 02:02:17.679 align:start position:0%
it and flout it and say well you know it
 
02:02:19.030 --> 02:02:19.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter and they can do this on
 
02:02:22.070 --> 02:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
their own this is this is law in this
 
02:02:24.550 --> 02:02:24.560 align:start position:0%
body specifically this body
 
02:02:27.750 --> 02:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
is to look at criminal law and public
 
02:02:27.760 --> 02:02:28.709 align:start position:0%
is to look at criminal law and public
safety

02:02:28.709 --> 02:02:28.719 align:start position:0%
safety
 
02:02:31.030 --> 02:02:31.040 align:start position:0%
and it is a violation of law
 
02:02:33.589 --> 02:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
to just ignore federal law
 
02:02:35.189 --> 02:02:35.199 align:start position:0%
and to just release people into the
 
02:02:37.750 --> 02:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
public who have
 
02:02:39.990 --> 02:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
been requested to be held by immigration
 
02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:41.270 align:start position:0%
been requested to be held by immigration
enforcement

02:02:41.270 --> 02:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
02:02:44.470 --> 02:02:44.480 align:start position:0%
and just ignore it um so in response to
 
02:02:46.310 --> 02:02:46.320 align:start position:0%
all of those things that those those
 
02:02:49.109 --> 02:02:49.119 align:start position:0%
arguments are are without merit and
 
02:02:52.229 --> 02:02:52.239 align:start position:0%
again this does not mandate or allocate
 
02:02:53.990 --> 02:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
resources it's only if someone's been
 
02:02:57.189 --> 02:02:57.199 align:start position:0%
arrested already for violating our laws
 
02:03:02.310 --> 02:03:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:03.990 --> 02:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
just for a point of
 
02:03:05.910 --> 02:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
clarification here
 
02:03:07.669 --> 02:03:07.679 align:start position:0%
a lot of the testimony we heard was
 
02:03:07.679 --> 02:03:09.430 align:start position:0%
a lot of the testimony we heard was
about

02:03:09.430 --> 02:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:03:11.030 --> 02:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
allowing police officers and law
 
02:03:12.870 --> 02:03:12.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement divisions to exercise their
 
02:03:17.830 --> 02:03:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:19.589 --> 02:03:19.599 align:start position:0%
i believe the amendment
 
02:03:21.669 --> 02:03:21.679 align:start position:0%
took that into consideration
 
02:03:24.229 --> 02:03:24.239 align:start position:0%
it allows on a case-by-case basis for a
 
02:03:26.950 --> 02:03:26.960 align:start position:0%
law enforcement agency to decide
 
02:03:28.550 --> 02:03:28.560 align:start position:0%
what they want to do in that particular
 
02:03:30.390 --> 02:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
circumstance it's not mandating they do
 
02:03:30.400 --> 02:03:31.430 align:start position:0%
circumstance it's not mandating they do
one

02:03:31.430 --> 02:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:03:34.790 --> 02:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
take one action or another and
 
02:03:36.550 --> 02:03:36.560 align:start position:0%
how that discretion is exercised for
 
02:03:38.870 --> 02:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
better or worse is would
 
02:03:40.390 --> 02:03:40.400 align:start position:0%
would be something that the that law
 
02:03:42.390 --> 02:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency would have to answer
 
02:03:45.910 --> 02:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:49.510 --> 02:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
on to to universally prohibit um
 
02:03:51.430 --> 02:03:51.440 align:start position:0%
any type of discretion to be used on
 
02:03:52.870 --> 02:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
whether or not to
 
02:03:52.880 --> 02:03:53.669 align:start position:0%
whether or not to
um

02:03:53.669 --> 02:03:53.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:55.189 --> 02:03:55.199 align:start position:0%
assist or cooperate with the detainer
 
02:03:57.109 --> 02:03:57.119 align:start position:0%
request in respect to someone who's
 
02:03:58.950 --> 02:03:58.960 align:start position:0%
already in the custody of law
 
02:04:00.470 --> 02:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement this is not authorizing
 
02:04:02.069 --> 02:04:02.079 align:start position:0%
police to go out
 
02:04:02.079 --> 02:04:02.870 align:start position:0%
police to go out
in

02:04:02.870 --> 02:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:04:04.870 --> 02:04:04.880 align:start position:0%
and take people into custody
 
02:04:07.030 --> 02:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
because there's a detainer request this
 
02:04:08.790 --> 02:04:08.800 align:start position:0%
is someone who's already in the custody
 
02:04:11.030 --> 02:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
of the state
 
02:04:12.870 --> 02:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
county or the
 
02:04:14.790 --> 02:04:14.800 align:start position:0%
county sheriff's department or local law
 
02:04:16.629 --> 02:04:16.639 align:start position:0%
enforcement that's what this would do
 
02:04:18.149 --> 02:04:18.159 align:start position:0%
and it gives them gives that the law
 
02:04:18.159 --> 02:04:19.669 align:start position:0%
and it gives them gives that the law
enforcement

02:04:19.669 --> 02:04:19.679 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
02:04:22.069 --> 02:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to exercise said
 
02:04:22.079 --> 02:04:23.189 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to exercise said
discretion

02:04:23.189 --> 02:04:23.199 align:start position:0%
discretion
 
02:04:24.870 --> 02:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
that's the that's what this does it's
 
02:04:27.910 --> 02:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
not forcing one one way or the other
 
02:04:30.390 --> 02:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
so i i think this is a
 
02:04:32.950 --> 02:04:32.960 align:start position:0%
fair compromise on the subject
 
02:04:34.550 --> 02:04:34.560 align:start position:0%
and uh allows the police to use their
 
02:04:36.310 --> 02:04:36.320 align:start position:0%
discretion so that's i'll be supporting
 
02:04:37.589 --> 02:04:37.599 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
02:04:39.350 --> 02:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
representative bourdain
 
02:04:41.270 --> 02:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:04:43.430 --> 02:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
i will point out at least one of the
 
02:04:45.910 --> 02:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
communities that were identified
 
02:04:49.350 --> 02:04:49.360 align:start position:0%
that nazi enforced immigration laws
 
02:04:53.189 --> 02:04:53.199 align:start position:0%
was done at a town meeting
 
02:04:53.199 --> 02:04:54.149 align:start position:0%
was done at a town meeting
at

02:04:54.149 --> 02:04:54.159 align:start position:0%
at
 
02:04:55.750 --> 02:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
town meeting day
 
02:04:58.069 --> 02:04:58.079 align:start position:0%
they directed their
 
02:05:00.709 --> 02:05:00.719 align:start position:0%
law enforcement not to
 
02:05:02.950 --> 02:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
enforce immigration laws
 
02:05:02.960 --> 02:05:03.910 align:start position:0%
enforce immigration laws
so

02:05:03.910 --> 02:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:05:06.390 --> 02:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
that is the will of the people
 
02:05:07.510 --> 02:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
in that
 
02:05:07.520 --> 02:05:08.709 align:start position:0%
in that
area

02:05:08.709 --> 02:05:08.719 align:start position:0%
area
 
02:05:08.719 --> 02:05:10.870 align:start position:0%
area
now

02:05:10.870 --> 02:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:05:12.310 --> 02:05:12.320 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:05:13.830 --> 02:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
as amended
 
02:05:15.189 --> 02:05:15.199 align:start position:0%
would say
 
02:05:17.669 --> 02:05:17.679 align:start position:0%
we don't care
 
02:05:20.149 --> 02:05:20.159 align:start position:0%
you don't care that the people of this
 
02:05:20.159 --> 02:05:21.030 align:start position:0%
you don't care that the people of this
town

02:05:21.030 --> 02:05:21.040 align:start position:0%
town
 
02:05:23.510 --> 02:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
do not want this to happen
 
02:05:25.270 --> 02:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
you cannot make
 
02:05:27.270 --> 02:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
a ordinance saying
 
02:05:27.280 --> 02:05:29.430 align:start position:0%
a ordinance saying
that

02:05:29.430 --> 02:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:05:32.069 --> 02:05:32.079 align:start position:0%
law enforcement will not act in this way
 
02:05:32.079 --> 02:05:33.430 align:start position:0%
law enforcement will not act in this way
against

02:05:33.430 --> 02:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
against
 
02:05:36.870 --> 02:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
their own wishes
 
02:05:38.950 --> 02:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
and since they pay for law enforcement
 
02:05:40.950 --> 02:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
in their community you would think that
 
02:05:43.030 --> 02:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
they would follow the directions that
 
02:05:44.550 --> 02:05:44.560 align:start position:0%
the people wanted
 
02:05:46.629 --> 02:05:46.639 align:start position:0%
so i think
 
02:05:49.990 --> 02:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
even one exception to
 
02:05:51.910 --> 02:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
the statewide
 
02:05:51.920 --> 02:05:53.189 align:start position:0%
the statewide
law

02:05:53.189 --> 02:05:53.199 align:start position:0%
law
 
02:05:55.990 --> 02:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
is enough to disqualify the need for the
 
02:06:01.189 --> 02:06:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:02.790 --> 02:06:02.800 align:start position:0%
representative muse
 
02:06:04.550 --> 02:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
yeah i would just like to echo uh
 
02:06:07.510 --> 02:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
representative bourdain's comments um
 
02:06:09.910 --> 02:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
my community decided to do this a few
 
02:06:11.189 --> 02:06:11.199 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
02:06:13.350 --> 02:06:13.360 align:start position:0%
it was widely supported
 
02:06:13.360 --> 02:06:15.430 align:start position:0%
it was widely supported
um

02:06:15.430 --> 02:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:17.669 --> 02:06:17.679 align:start position:0%
i think one of the things we need to be
 
02:06:19.669 --> 02:06:19.679 align:start position:0%
very careful of is remembering that our
 
02:06:23.030 --> 02:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
job isn't to uh override
 
02:06:25.430 --> 02:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh other elected bodies especially local
 
02:06:27.350 --> 02:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
elected bodies whenever we happen to
 
02:06:29.830 --> 02:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
disagree with them
 
02:06:32.149 --> 02:06:32.159 align:start position:0%
this is an area where the people have
 
02:06:35.589 --> 02:06:35.599 align:start position:0%
made their their feelings known
 
02:06:38.470 --> 02:06:38.480 align:start position:0%
some of us may or may not like it
 
02:06:38.480 --> 02:06:39.430 align:start position:0%
some of us may or may not like it
but

02:06:39.430 --> 02:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:06:42.149 --> 02:06:42.159 align:start position:0%
but i don't think it's our job to try to
 
02:06:44.550 --> 02:06:44.560 align:start position:0%
reverse policies like this and and
 
02:06:46.470 --> 02:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
frankly one of the things that i haven't
 
02:06:48.310 --> 02:06:48.320 align:start position:0%
heard come up yet but this this is
 
02:06:50.390 --> 02:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
common what's commonly referred to as an
 
02:06:53.270 --> 02:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
anti-sanctuary cities bill so let's just
 
02:06:55.350 --> 02:06:55.360 align:start position:0%
say the words and get it out of the way
 
02:06:57.589 --> 02:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what this thing is and
 
02:07:00.149 --> 02:07:00.159 align:start position:0%
what it does is it takes the control out
 
02:07:02.709 --> 02:07:02.719 align:start position:0%
of the hands of public officials in in
 
02:07:04.709 --> 02:07:04.719 align:start position:0%
local communities to make these
 
02:07:04.719 --> 02:07:17.510 align:start position:0%
local communities to make these
decisions

02:07:17.510 --> 02:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:21.030 --> 02:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
do any members wish to speak on the
 
02:07:22.229 --> 02:07:22.239 align:start position:0%
question that's before the committee who
 
02:07:27.030 --> 02:07:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:29.109 --> 02:07:29.119 align:start position:0%
at this
 
02:07:32.629 --> 02:07:32.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:33.669 --> 02:07:33.679 align:start position:0%
we're going to we're going to move the
 
02:07:35.430 --> 02:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
question because the goal was to break
 
02:07:39.030 --> 02:07:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:40.870 --> 02:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
at this time we'll now move the question
 
02:07:42.870 --> 02:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
the question is whether to adopt
 
02:07:47.589 --> 02:07:47.599 align:start position:0%

2022-08748

03:22:17.190 --> 03:22:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:18.950 --> 03:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
and like i was saying earlier what this
 
03:22:21.269 --> 03:22:21.279 align:start position:0%

03:22:25.750 --> 03:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
the concerns that was brought up during

the hearing
 
03:22:27.520 --> 03:22:28.790 align:start position:0%
the hearing
and

03:22:28.790 --> 03:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:22:30.309 --> 03:22:30.319 align:start position:0%
you know to make sure that you know
 
03:22:34.389 --> 03:22:34.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:34.399 --> 03:22:36.550 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:22:36.550 --> 03:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:37.910 --> 03:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
you know i remember
 
03:22:40.469 --> 03:22:40.479 align:start position:0%
mr mcgrath you know he spoke on this how
 
03:22:42.309 --> 03:22:42.319 align:start position:0%
it's needed
 
03:22:44.790 --> 03:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
and you know we've passed similar bills
 
03:22:46.469 --> 03:22:46.479 align:start position:0%
like this but this one's just going to
 
03:22:48.550 --> 03:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
clean up a lot of language on the
 
03:22:48.560 --> 03:22:49.750 align:start position:0%
clean up a lot of language on the
forfeiture

03:22:49.750 --> 03:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
forfeiture
 
03:22:52.229 --> 03:22:52.239 align:start position:0%
in connections with a drug
 
03:22:55.590 --> 03:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
offense so then that way the police
 
03:22:58.950 --> 03:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:01.030 --> 03:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
and like myself i do carry cash
 
03:23:01.040 --> 03:23:02.710 align:start position:0%
and like myself i do carry cash
occasionally

03:23:02.710 --> 03:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
occasionally
 
03:23:05.670 --> 03:23:05.680 align:start position:0%
you know they can confiscate that but
 
03:23:08.550 --> 03:23:08.560 align:start position:0%
and at that point i would have to prove
 
03:23:11.269 --> 03:23:11.279 align:start position:0%
that this money was not being used for
 
03:23:14.790 --> 03:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
drug related activities where this puts
 
03:23:17.269 --> 03:23:17.279 align:start position:0%
the work back to the state like it
 
03:23:20.630 --> 03:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
should be to prove you are guilty
 
03:23:22.630 --> 03:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
of something and that's why they have
 
03:23:23.750 --> 03:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
your money
 
03:23:25.670 --> 03:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
and that's pretty much what it does
 
03:23:30.070 --> 03:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:32.150 --> 03:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
representative bourdain
 
03:23:34.150 --> 03:23:34.160 align:start position:0%
mr chairman um
 
03:23:37.269 --> 03:23:37.279 align:start position:0%
this is uh like a 11 page
 
03:23:37.279 --> 03:23:38.550 align:start position:0%
this is uh like a 11 page
amendment

03:23:38.550 --> 03:23:38.560 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:23:40.630 --> 03:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
to another
 
03:23:43.269 --> 03:23:43.279 align:start position:0%

03:24:42.469 --> 03:24:42.479 align:start position:0%
so i wouldn't be i wouldn't be able to
 
03:24:43.510 --> 03:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
answer that if there's any member of the
 
03:24:44.469 --> 03:24:44.479 align:start position:0%
committee that could respond to
 
03:24:47.030 --> 03:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
representative bourdain
 
03:25:09.110 --> 03:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:12.150 --> 03:25:12.160 align:start position:0%
no one no members raised their hands to
 
03:25:14.229 --> 03:25:14.239 align:start position:0%
answer the question so i do apologize
 
03:25:14.239 --> 03:25:15.190 align:start position:0%
answer the question so i do apologize
so

03:25:15.190 --> 03:25:15.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:25:18.229 --> 03:25:18.239 align:start position:0%
how are we supposed to process a 11-page
 
03:25:20.389 --> 03:25:20.399 align:start position:0%
amendment when we just were handed it we
 
03:25:22.389 --> 03:25:22.399 align:start position:0%
can't even read it that fast to see what
 
03:25:25.269 --> 03:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
the changes were and
 
03:25:38.309 --> 03:25:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:41.030 --> 03:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
let's let's just try to
 
03:25:42.550 --> 03:25:42.560 align:start position:0%
only speak one at a time if we don't
 
03:25:42.560 --> 03:25:44.710 align:start position:0%
only speak one at a time if we don't
mind

03:25:44.710 --> 03:25:44.720 align:start position:0%
mind
 
03:25:47.590 --> 03:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
are you raising a point of order
 
03:25:48.950 --> 03:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
it appears so
 
03:25:51.910 --> 03:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:54.389 --> 03:25:54.399 align:start position:0%
and please state your point of order the
 
03:25:56.710 --> 03:25:56.720 align:start position:0%
point of order is that we have been
 
03:25:56.720 --> 03:25:57.590 align:start position:0%
point of order is that we have been
given

03:25:57.590 --> 03:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
given
 
03:26:02.550 --> 03:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
a 11 page amendment with no notification
 
03:26:05.670 --> 03:26:05.680 align:start position:0%
and no clarification what those changes
 
03:26:05.680 --> 03:26:06.550 align:start position:0%
and no clarification what those changes
were

03:26:06.550 --> 03:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
were
 
03:26:09.510 --> 03:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
and are expected to vote on without
 
03:26:13.190 --> 03:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:14.469 --> 03:26:14.479 align:start position:0%
so i
 
03:26:17.030 --> 03:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
is there a house rule or anywhere in the
 
03:26:18.950 --> 03:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
mason's manual that you would suggest
 
03:26:20.710 --> 03:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
that there's a rule that has been
 
03:26:20.720 --> 03:26:22.229 align:start position:0%
that there's a rule that has been
adopted

03:26:22.229 --> 03:26:22.239 align:start position:0%
adopted
 
03:26:24.469 --> 03:26:24.479 align:start position:0%
by the house that is not being followed
 
03:26:26.710 --> 03:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
i understand that perhaps the discretion
 
03:26:28.630 --> 03:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
being utilized may not be
 
03:26:30.229 --> 03:26:30.239 align:start position:0%
something that is
 
03:26:33.510 --> 03:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
a popular decision but
 
03:26:36.309 --> 03:26:36.319 align:start position:0%
discretionary decision aside is there an
 
03:26:38.309 --> 03:26:38.319 align:start position:0%
actual rule not being followed
 
03:26:40.070 --> 03:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
that you can reference
 
03:26:42.469 --> 03:26:42.479 align:start position:0%
perhaps i misstated mr chairman
 
03:26:45.910 --> 03:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
that uh porn order may not be the uh
 
03:26:45.920 --> 03:26:47.030 align:start position:0%
that uh porn order may not be the uh
correct

03:26:47.030 --> 03:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:26:47.040 --> 03:26:47.830 align:start position:0%
correct
uh

03:26:47.830 --> 03:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:26:49.910 --> 03:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
question it may be
 
03:26:54.870 --> 03:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:57.590 --> 03:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
what is the other one
 
03:26:59.990 --> 03:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
so if i understand you're withdrawing
 
03:27:03.269 --> 03:27:03.279 align:start position:0%
your point of order but you you're
 
03:27:05.429 --> 03:27:05.439 align:start position:0%
not inclined to support
 
03:27:07.110 --> 03:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
the adoption this amendment given the
 
03:27:08.790 --> 03:27:08.800 align:start position:0%
time frame you would have to review it
 
03:27:11.990 --> 03:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
in respect to its contents
 
03:27:15.269 --> 03:27:15.279 align:start position:0%
and is that yes yes sir i i'm not sure
 
03:27:17.510 --> 03:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
what to do with this yet whether we
 
03:27:20.070 --> 03:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
should come back at another time but i
 
03:27:22.229 --> 03:27:22.239 align:start position:0%
think that to adopt this amendment
 
03:27:24.229 --> 03:27:24.239 align:start position:0%
without knowing what's in it
 
03:27:27.349 --> 03:27:27.359 align:start position:0%
is a regular
 
03:27:28.870 --> 03:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
03:27:30.870 --> 03:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
and representative burke in in fairness
 
03:27:32.710 --> 03:27:32.720 align:start position:0%
to the point being raised by uh
 
03:27:35.030 --> 03:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
representative bourdain
 
03:27:37.190 --> 03:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
there was a prior we had a public
 
03:27:37.200 --> 03:27:38.229 align:start position:0%
there was a prior we had a public
hearing

03:27:38.229 --> 03:27:38.239 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
03:27:40.469 --> 03:27:40.479 align:start position:0%
uh because this was this was ruled not
 
03:27:42.070 --> 03:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
this amendment but it was a non-german
 
03:27:42.080 --> 03:27:46.550 align:start position:0%
this amendment but it was a non-german
amendment

03:27:46.550 --> 03:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:49.349 --> 03:27:49.359 align:start position:0%
yes it was a non-german amendment uh so
 
03:27:50.950 --> 03:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
i don't have that amendment i thought i
 
03:27:52.389 --> 03:27:52.399 align:start position:0%
did and i don't
 
03:27:52.399 --> 03:27:53.510 align:start position:0%
did and i don't
um

03:27:53.510 --> 03:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:27:56.309 --> 03:27:56.319 align:start position:0%
and that's not before us can
 
03:27:57.670 --> 03:27:57.680 align:start position:0%
now i'm going to ask a parliamentary
 
03:27:59.429 --> 03:27:59.439 align:start position:0%
inquiry of the committee
 
03:28:01.429 --> 03:28:01.439 align:start position:0%
because this is not the exact draft of
 
03:28:03.750 --> 03:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
the non-germain amendment
 
03:28:05.910 --> 03:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
it's similar but it's not we permitted
 
03:28:05.920 --> 03:28:07.349 align:start position:0%
it's similar but it's not we permitted
to

03:28:07.349 --> 03:28:07.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:28:09.349 --> 03:28:09.359 align:start position:0%
would we be required to have another
 
03:28:13.910 --> 03:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:16.550 --> 03:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that any member can
 
03:28:18.389 --> 03:28:18.399 align:start position:0%
bring an amendment
 
03:28:20.550 --> 03:28:20.560 align:start position:0%
during an exec session and we don't have
 
03:28:24.070 --> 03:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
to have a hearing on this
 
03:28:25.750 --> 03:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
yes it but it would have to if it's a
 
03:28:27.510 --> 03:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
non-german amendment you still would
 
03:28:29.750 --> 03:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
have to have a hearing on it so what i'm
 
03:28:32.790 --> 03:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
saying is we had a public hearing on a
 
03:28:34.630 --> 03:28:34.640 align:start position:0%
non-german amendment this
 
03:28:37.030 --> 03:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
is although similar to that
 
03:28:39.190 --> 03:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
it's not word for word identical so i'm
 
03:28:42.550 --> 03:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:43.910 --> 03:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
parliamentary question that i have for
 
03:28:46.229 --> 03:28:46.239 align:start position:0%
the rest of the committee
 
03:28:49.830 --> 03:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:52.309 --> 03:28:52.319 align:start position:0%
mr chair you do have a resource option
 
03:28:55.590 --> 03:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
with the house clerk's office
 
03:28:58.150 --> 03:28:58.160 align:start position:0%
if if you choose to exercise that as the
 
03:28:59.990 --> 03:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
chair and representative pearson would
 
03:29:01.670 --> 03:29:01.680 align:start position:0%
you mind
 
03:29:03.670 --> 03:29:03.680 align:start position:0%
communicating that question to the house
 
03:29:03.680 --> 03:29:04.950 align:start position:0%
communicating that question to the house
clerk

03:29:04.950 --> 03:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
clerk
 
03:29:07.030 --> 03:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
i can communicate the question that
 
03:29:17.269 --> 03:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:19.429 --> 03:29:19.439 align:start position:0%
so let me let me do this that's for
 
03:29:19.439 --> 03:29:21.110 align:start position:0%
so let me let me do this that's for
clarification

03:29:21.110 --> 03:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
03:29:23.429 --> 03:29:23.439 align:start position:0%
let me inquire because i i just want to
 
03:29:25.190 --> 03:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
make sure we're following the procedure
 
03:29:29.990 --> 03:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:32.710 --> 03:29:32.720 align:start position:0%
the original bill had 11 lines
 
03:29:34.710 --> 03:29:34.720 align:start position:0%
this is considerably more
 
03:29:37.190 --> 03:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
language than the original bill and i
 
03:29:38.950 --> 03:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
think it'll take a little time to figure
 
03:29:40.469 --> 03:29:40.479 align:start position:0%
out what it is unless somebody can
 
03:29:41.990 --> 03:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
explain it
 
03:29:44.150 --> 03:29:44.160 align:start position:0%
i understood but we had it we had a
 
03:29:45.670 --> 03:29:45.680 align:start position:0%
public hearing on the non-german
 
03:29:47.269 --> 03:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
amendment already
 
03:29:48.469 --> 03:29:48.479 align:start position:0%
we're really just trying to figure out
 
03:29:49.830 --> 03:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
because this isn't word for that
 
03:29:49.840 --> 03:29:51.750 align:start position:0%
because this isn't word for that
amendment

03:29:51.750 --> 03:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:29:51.760 --> 03:29:52.710 align:start position:0%
amendment
well

03:29:52.710 --> 03:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:29:53.910 --> 03:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
without being able to explain what's
 
03:29:57.269 --> 03:29:57.279 align:start position:0%
different if i'm i'm assuming that even
 
03:29:59.349 --> 03:29:59.359 align:start position:0%
this amendment would also be non-germane
 
03:30:00.550 --> 03:30:00.560 align:start position:0%
but i want to make sure we're not
 
03:30:03.269 --> 03:30:03.279 align:start position:0%
violating the house rule if not we can
 
03:30:05.670 --> 03:30:05.680 align:start position:0%
so what i'm inclined to do is maybe look
 
03:30:08.070 --> 03:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
into that a little further
 
03:30:09.750 --> 03:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
and representative board
 
03:30:10.630 --> 03:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
well that may not have been your
 
03:30:12.389 --> 03:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
intention you've inspired that
 
03:30:15.190 --> 03:30:15.200 align:start position:0%
thought so let me do this
 
03:30:18.389 --> 03:30:18.399 align:start position:0%
i think mr chairman
 
03:30:24.630 --> 03:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:26.469 --> 03:30:26.479 align:start position:0%
on a cell phone
 
03:30:29.510 --> 03:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:31.910 --> 03:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
i think you uh requested him to talk to
 
03:31:02.630 --> 03:31:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:04.309 --> 03:31:04.319 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
03:31:06.870 --> 03:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
in consultation with the house clerk
 
03:31:08.389 --> 03:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
because you had a public hearing on the
 
03:31:09.910 --> 03:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
non-germain amendment if you choose to
 
03:31:11.750 --> 03:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
amend that you do not have to hold
 
03:31:13.190 --> 03:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
another public hearing and it is
 
03:31:14.870 --> 03:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
permissible to amend it since there was
 
03:31:18.790 --> 03:31:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:20.150 --> 03:31:20.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:31:29.110 --> 03:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:31.910 --> 03:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
and representative are you able to
 
03:31:33.990 --> 03:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
provide any insight on the difference
 
03:31:34.000 --> 03:31:37.110 align:start position:0%
provide any insight on the difference
between

03:31:37.110 --> 03:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:40.630 --> 03:31:40.640 align:start position:0%
amendments 0 8 7 four h and represent
 
03:31:43.030 --> 03:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
born the other amendment was
 
03:31:43.040 --> 03:31:46.950 align:start position:0%
born the other amendment was
numbered

03:31:46.950 --> 03:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:48.469 --> 03:31:48.479 align:start position:0%
i don't have the other amendment in
 
03:31:49.990 --> 03:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
front of me and and
 
03:31:52.950 --> 03:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
to be honest once that amendment was
 
03:31:56.150 --> 03:31:56.160 align:start position:0%
deemed non-germane i just moved on and
 
03:31:56.160 --> 03:31:58.150 align:start position:0%
deemed non-germane i just moved on and

member you know from the questions that

came out of that here and
 
03:32:12.790 --> 03:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
uh came up with this amendment
 
03:32:20.150 --> 03:32:20.160 align:start position:0%

03:32:23.269 --> 03:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
chair
 
03:32:25.510 --> 03:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
all right in that case since we don't
 
03:32:27.030 --> 03:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
know what's in this amendment and what
 
03:32:28.469 --> 03:32:28.479 align:start position:0%
the differences are
 
03:32:30.790 --> 03:32:30.800 align:start position:0%
i'm going to oppose the adoption of the
 
03:32:30.800 --> 03:32:39.190 align:start position:0%
i'm going to oppose the adoption of the
amendment

03:32:39.190 --> 03:32:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:41.670 --> 03:32:41.680 align:start position:0%
and the other members wish to speak to
 
03:32:43.510 --> 03:32:43.520 align:start position:0%
representative muse

representative muse
yes

03:32:44.630 --> 03:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:32:47.190 --> 03:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
03:32:48.229 --> 03:32:48.239 align:start position:0%
i mean just
 
03:32:49.590 --> 03:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
looking at this and i haven't had the
 
03:32:53.349 --> 03:32:53.359 align:start position:0%
time to uh to soak it all in either
 
03:32:56.950 --> 03:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
but you know we're talking about a
 
03:32:59.590 --> 03:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
an 11-page or 12-page amendment that
 
03:32:59.600 --> 03:33:00.630 align:start position:0%
an 11-page or 12-page amendment that
actually

03:33:00.630 --> 03:33:00.640 align:start position:0%
actually
 
03:33:05.110 --> 03:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
replaces a half-page original bill
 
03:33:07.269 --> 03:33:07.279 align:start position:0%
this is what we used to call a trojan
 
03:33:07.279 --> 03:33:09.349 align:start position:0%
this is what we used to call a trojan
horse

03:33:09.349 --> 03:33:09.359 align:start position:0%
horse
 
03:33:10.870 --> 03:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
this is a
 
03:33:13.429 --> 03:33:13.439 align:start position:0%
it's very hard very difficult to tell
 
03:33:16.070 --> 03:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
how close to the original build this was
 
03:33:17.830 --> 03:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
how close it is to the non-germain
 
03:33:19.670 --> 03:33:19.680 align:start position:0%
amendment um picking through a few
 
03:33:19.680 --> 03:33:20.710 align:start position:0%
amendment um picking through a few
things

03:33:20.710 --> 03:33:20.720 align:start position:0%
things
 
03:33:20.720 --> 03:33:21.510 align:start position:0%
things
uh

03:33:21.510 --> 03:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:33:26.070 --> 03:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
i was able to see uh that i know uh
 
03:33:27.670 --> 03:33:27.680 align:start position:0%
richard head from the judicial system
 
03:33:29.750 --> 03:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
when he testified in front of us had a
 
03:33:31.429 --> 03:33:31.439 align:start position:0%
lot of concerns
 
03:33:31.439 --> 03:33:32.389 align:start position:0%
lot of concerns
about

03:33:32.389 --> 03:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:33:35.030 --> 03:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
the additional number of hearings that
 
03:33:36.630 --> 03:33:36.640 align:start position:0%
this bill would require around
 
03:33:36.640 --> 03:33:38.070 align:start position:0%
this bill would require around
forfeiture

03:33:38.070 --> 03:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
forfeiture
 
03:33:40.309 --> 03:33:40.319 align:start position:0%
and whether or not at a time when our
 
03:33:43.349 --> 03:33:43.359 align:start position:0%
court system is already overburdened
 
03:33:45.030 --> 03:33:45.040 align:start position:0%
that's something that we can handle
 
03:33:48.469 --> 03:33:48.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:48.479 --> 03:33:49.349 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:33:49.349 --> 03:33:49.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:33:52.150 --> 03:33:52.160 align:start position:0%
that issue as i read the bill very very
 
03:33:52.160 --> 03:33:53.110 align:start position:0%
that issue as i read the bill very very
quickly

03:33:53.110 --> 03:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
03:33:55.830 --> 03:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
does not appear to have been addressed
 
03:33:56.950 --> 03:33:56.960 align:start position:0%
if somebody
 
03:33:59.190 --> 03:33:59.200 align:start position:0%
disagrees with that
 
03:34:00.790 --> 03:34:00.800 align:start position:0%
please jump in
 
03:34:00.800 --> 03:34:01.830 align:start position:0%
please jump in
um

03:34:01.830 --> 03:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:03.510 --> 03:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
but um
 
03:34:05.590 --> 03:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
to me that was one of the main things
 
03:34:07.830 --> 03:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
that gave me pause about a bill that in
 
03:34:10.469 --> 03:34:10.479 align:start position:0%
a lot of ways i i think i agree with the
 
03:34:12.389 --> 03:34:12.399 align:start position:0%
intent of it civil
 
03:34:14.469 --> 03:34:14.479 align:start position:0%
civil asset forfeiture
 
03:34:17.190 --> 03:34:17.200 align:start position:0%
is uh is not a happy thing
 
03:34:19.990 --> 03:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
for a lot of people in this state um
 
03:34:21.429 --> 03:34:21.439 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:34:22.630 --> 03:34:22.640 align:start position:0%
and i do think that there are some
 
03:34:24.950 --> 03:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
things that we need to do to to restrict
 
03:34:26.469 --> 03:34:26.479 align:start position:0%
it but again
 
03:34:28.389 --> 03:34:28.399 align:start position:0%
the devil is in the details and we have
 
03:34:30.790 --> 03:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
11 pages more of details and i'm not
 
03:34:30.800 --> 03:34:31.670 align:start position:0%
11 pages more of details and i'm not
sure

03:34:31.670 --> 03:34:31.680 align:start position:0%
sure
 
03:34:33.670 --> 03:34:33.680 align:start position:0%
to what extent they're solving the
 
03:34:37.269 --> 03:34:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:38.790 --> 03:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
i may be able to provide some insight
 
03:34:40.550 --> 03:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
and representative burt you can thank me
 
03:34:42.550 --> 03:34:42.560 align:start position:0%
thank you later
 
03:34:42.560 --> 03:34:43.429 align:start position:0%
thank you later
so

03:34:43.429 --> 03:34:43.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:34:45.510 --> 03:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
i do have a
 
03:34:48.309 --> 03:34:48.319 align:start position:0%
what has been reported is this this
 
03:34:51.950 --> 03:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:54.550 --> 03:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
0874-h compared to the initial
 
03:34:57.030 --> 03:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
non-germain amendment there are four
 
03:34:57.040 --> 03:34:58.389 align:start position:0%
non-germain amendment there are four
changes

03:34:58.389 --> 03:34:58.399 align:start position:0%
changes
 
03:35:02.630 --> 03:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:05.830 --> 03:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:09.030 --> 03:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
one's on page two line thirty five
 
03:35:14.550 --> 03:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:19.510 --> 03:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:22.070 --> 03:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
so there's only four
 
03:35:24.950 --> 03:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
changes now i
 
03:35:27.110 --> 03:35:27.120 align:start position:0%
compared to the non-initial non-german
 
03:35:28.229 --> 03:35:28.239 align:start position:0%
amendment and what we have before the
 
03:35:35.349 --> 03:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:36.950 --> 03:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
because when i when i read this i didn't
 
03:35:38.469 --> 03:35:38.479 align:start position:0%
find it to be
 
03:35:40.870 --> 03:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
much of a difference but that's just
 
03:35:42.389 --> 03:35:42.399 align:start position:0%
representative connolly
 
03:35:46.630 --> 03:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:50.070 --> 03:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
sort of echoing what representative muse
 
03:35:52.790 --> 03:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
just articulated pretty well i i sort of
 
03:35:53.830 --> 03:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
agree with those points but one of the
 
03:35:55.269 --> 03:35:55.279 align:start position:0%
things that's standing out on this and
 
03:35:58.070 --> 03:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
this came up during testimony for the
 
03:35:59.590 --> 03:35:59.600 align:start position:0%
non-germain amendment
 
03:36:01.670 --> 03:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
so we're essentially taking
 
03:36:04.309 --> 03:36:04.319 align:start position:0%
a sort of swath of
 
03:36:06.070 --> 03:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
property that could be subject to
 
03:36:07.910 --> 03:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
forfeiture and saying it's off limits to
 
03:36:10.710 --> 03:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
forfeiture regardless of whether or not
 
03:36:14.309 --> 03:36:14.319 align:start position:0%
said property is subject or is is fruit
 
03:36:15.670 --> 03:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
of a crime
 
03:36:17.349 --> 03:36:17.359 align:start position:0%
so although it might seem like a small
 
03:36:19.510 --> 03:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
amount currency totaling 200 or less a
 
03:36:19.520 --> 03:36:20.710 align:start position:0%
amount currency totaling 200 or less a
vehicle

03:36:20.710 --> 03:36:20.720 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
03:36:23.110 --> 03:36:23.120 align:start position:0%
worth less than two thousand dollars
 
03:36:23.120 --> 03:36:23.830 align:start position:0%
worth less than two thousand dollars
well

03:36:23.830 --> 03:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:36:23.840 --> 03:36:24.710 align:start position:0%
well
although

03:36:24.710 --> 03:36:24.720 align:start position:0%
although
 
03:36:26.309 --> 03:36:26.319 align:start position:0%
we like to think of forfeiture as
 
03:36:28.070 --> 03:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
targeting kingpins
 
03:36:29.910 --> 03:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
we know in new hampshire that the vast
 
03:36:31.349 --> 03:36:31.359 align:start position:0%
majority and we heard this from
 
03:36:33.670 --> 03:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
testimony the vast majority of
 
03:36:35.349 --> 03:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
properties subject to forfeiture is
 
03:36:39.750 --> 03:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:41.510 --> 03:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
they you can have problems with
 
03:36:43.590 --> 03:36:43.600 align:start position:0%
forfeiture and want to address them
 
03:36:45.269 --> 03:36:45.279 align:start position:0%
but we also don't want to make it so bad
 
03:36:46.550 --> 03:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
actors get to keep their ill-gotten
 
03:36:48.710 --> 03:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
gains and i think that that's possible
 
03:36:54.630 --> 03:36:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:57.030 --> 03:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
representative true
 
03:36:59.190 --> 03:36:59.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and i i i did try to
 
03:37:00.710 --> 03:37:00.720 align:start position:0%
could you write down
 
03:37:04.469 --> 03:37:04.479 align:start position:0%
run by those changes in the pages again
 
03:37:06.309 --> 03:37:06.319 align:start position:0%
a little slower
 
03:37:11.429 --> 03:37:11.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:18.790 --> 03:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:25.269 --> 03:37:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:30.389 --> 03:37:30.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:33.670 --> 03:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
and in page 4 line 32
 
03:37:37.910 --> 03:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:40.790 --> 03:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
charging instrument has been changed to
 
03:37:42.830 --> 03:37:42.840 align:start position:0%
indictment or
 
03:37:45.830 --> 03:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
information and that same
 
03:37:47.429 --> 03:37:47.439 align:start position:0%
grammatical change was actually changed
 
03:37:49.349 --> 03:37:49.359 align:start position:0%
again on page five line
 
03:37:52.550 --> 03:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
eight and page five line fourteen
 
03:37:54.550 --> 03:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
so that's the same
 
03:37:54.560 --> 03:37:56.389 align:start position:0%
so that's the same
uh

03:37:56.389 --> 03:37:56.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:37:57.349 --> 03:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
wording change that was multiple
 
03:38:02.950 --> 03:38:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:05.830 --> 03:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
it and in respect to the non-germain
 
03:38:07.190 --> 03:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
amendment the idea
 
03:38:09.429 --> 03:38:09.439 align:start position:0%
at least the
 
03:38:12.229 --> 03:38:12.239 align:start position:0%
goal was to have a situation where when
 
03:38:13.750 --> 03:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
you have these asset forfeiture hearings
 
03:38:16.150 --> 03:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
it's a several civil case
 
03:38:17.990 --> 03:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
and there was some thought that it may
 
03:38:20.710 --> 03:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
save the court time and save
 
03:38:22.550 --> 03:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of the interested party's time if
 
03:38:22.560 --> 03:38:23.269 align:start position:0%
a lot of the interested party's time if
you

03:38:23.269 --> 03:38:23.279 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:38:25.030 --> 03:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
at the end of a criminal
 
03:38:26.389 --> 03:38:26.399 align:start position:0%
prosecution if
 
03:38:28.950 --> 03:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
whether convict if they're convicted
 
03:38:30.950 --> 03:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
perhaps just have that civil
 
03:38:32.469 --> 03:38:32.479 align:start position:0%
instead of having a separate civil case
 
03:38:34.870 --> 03:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
you can you have a lot of the court the
 
03:38:37.030 --> 03:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
judge the fact the lawyers everyone's
 
03:38:38.630 --> 03:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
familiar with with the facts of what
 
03:38:41.910 --> 03:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
just happened it might have saved
 
03:38:44.309 --> 03:38:44.319 align:start position:0%
all the interested parties time
 
03:38:45.990 --> 03:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
legal expenses everything to just have
 
03:38:46.000 --> 03:38:46.870 align:start position:0%
legal expenses everything to just have
that

03:38:46.870 --> 03:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:38:50.070 --> 03:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
hearing done right then and there
 
03:38:52.389 --> 03:38:52.399 align:start position:0%
so the the intent of this is actually i
 
03:38:54.790 --> 03:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
believe in the right place whether this
 
03:38:55.990 --> 03:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
accomplishes that's really what i'm
 
03:38:58.070 --> 03:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
hoping we can
 
03:38:59.910 --> 03:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
discuss amongst ourselves today and make
 
03:39:01.349 --> 03:39:01.359 align:start position:0%
a decision on
 
03:39:03.189 --> 03:39:03.199 align:start position:0%
but having to pay
 
03:39:05.510 --> 03:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
a lawyer to represent you in a separate
 
03:39:08.229 --> 03:39:08.239 align:start position:0%
civil case involving asset forfeiture
 
03:39:10.229 --> 03:39:10.239 align:start position:0%
when you don't the
 
03:39:10.239 --> 03:39:11.510 align:start position:0%
when you don't the
court

03:39:11.510 --> 03:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
court
 
03:39:12.950 --> 03:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
may not always you may have a different
 
03:39:14.070 --> 03:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
judge who's not as familiar with the
 
03:39:16.309 --> 03:39:16.319 align:start position:0%
facts of the case literally at the end
 
03:39:17.910 --> 03:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
of the trial
 
03:39:19.910 --> 03:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
i assume it's fresh in everyone's mind i
 
03:39:22.229 --> 03:39:22.239 align:start position:0%
don't i don't see the the harm in having
 
03:39:23.990 --> 03:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
that hearing
 
03:39:26.630 --> 03:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
right then however
 
03:39:30.150 --> 03:39:30.160 align:start position:0%
i just oversimplified the issue
 
03:39:32.550 --> 03:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
so whether this accomplishes that
 
03:39:34.710 --> 03:39:34.720 align:start position:0%
both procedurally and
 
03:39:36.790 --> 03:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
fundamentally is what i would hope we
 
03:39:38.389 --> 03:39:38.399 align:start position:0%
can decide on today
 
03:39:40.150 --> 03:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
represent a board name
 
03:39:41.990 --> 03:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
03:39:44.469 --> 03:39:44.479 align:start position:0%
and i do not think that you miss a
 
03:39:46.550 --> 03:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
representative of the facts
 
03:39:49.750 --> 03:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
but where did you get the information on
 
03:39:56.469 --> 03:39:56.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:58.150 --> 03:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
is that relevant
 
03:40:01.349 --> 03:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
uh yes because did you examine yourself
 
03:40:03.269 --> 03:40:03.279 align:start position:0%
or did someone tell you well i already
 
03:40:06.389 --> 03:40:06.399 align:start position:0%
told you that i don't have the actual
 
03:40:09.510 --> 03:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
an initial original
 
03:40:12.550 --> 03:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
non-germain amendment however
 
03:40:14.229 --> 03:40:14.239 align:start position:0%
the sponsor the bill did for it
 
03:40:16.309 --> 03:40:16.319 align:start position:0%
forwarded me that information
 
03:40:18.309 --> 03:40:18.319 align:start position:0%
so to the extent that it is accurate or
 
03:40:18.319 --> 03:40:21.030 align:start position:0%
so to the extent that it is accurate or
inaccurate

03:40:21.030 --> 03:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:23.189 --> 03:40:23.199 align:start position:0%
i have no reason to not not believe that
 
03:40:25.510 --> 03:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
that would be accurate
 
03:40:27.830 --> 03:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
just trying to figure out whether we're
 
03:40:29.670 --> 03:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
looking at something accurate or not i
 
03:40:30.950 --> 03:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
will say if that email came from
 
03:40:32.229 --> 03:40:32.239 align:start position:0%
representative board now i also would
 
03:40:34.389 --> 03:40:34.399 align:start position:0%
take the email and
 
03:40:35.990 --> 03:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
give it the same
 
03:40:37.990 --> 03:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
same credibility one way or another so
 
03:40:39.750 --> 03:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
if it turns out there's more
 
03:40:45.030 --> 03:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:46.710 --> 03:40:46.720 align:start position:0%

i think we spoke enough on this it just
 
03:42:53.830 --> 03:42:53.840 align:start position:0%
you know bottom line this this bill
 
03:42:56.550 --> 03:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
will put
 
03:42:59.030 --> 03:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
the burden on to the state
 
03:42:59.040 --> 03:43:01.510 align:start position:0%
the burden on to the state
to

03:43:01.510 --> 03:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:02.790 --> 03:43:02.800 align:start position:0%
say if
 
03:43:07.030 --> 03:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
any money seized is for drug purposes
 
03:43:07.040 --> 03:43:08.070 align:start position:0%
any money seized is for drug purposes
um

03:43:08.070 --> 03:43:08.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:10.469 --> 03:43:10.479 align:start position:0%
and i think it's a good amen uh good
 
03:43:16.790 --> 03:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:18.229 --> 03:43:18.239 align:start position:0%
question of the chair representative
 
03:43:20.469 --> 03:43:20.479 align:start position:0%
calling thank you can you remind me and
 
03:43:21.990 --> 03:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
the committee because we've heard
 
03:43:23.189 --> 03:43:23.199 align:start position:0%
there's so many amendments and there's
 
03:43:25.590 --> 03:43:25.600 align:start position:0%
an undermay amendment hearing is this
 
03:43:28.309 --> 03:43:28.319 align:start position:0%
the bill that would flip it from you
 
03:43:30.389 --> 03:43:30.399 align:start position:0%
know the burden of proof being
 
03:43:30.399 --> 03:43:32.229 align:start position:0%
know the burden of proof being
50.1

03:43:32.229 --> 03:43:32.239 align:start position:0%
50.1
 
03:43:34.070 --> 03:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
for the plaintiff versus the state to
 
03:43:36.309 --> 03:43:36.319 align:start position:0%
now the state has that burden of proof
 
03:43:38.070 --> 03:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
is that is that this bill or is that one
 
03:43:40.150 --> 03:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
of the different asset forfeiture bills
 
03:43:45.349 --> 03:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:46.550 --> 03:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
i think representative
 
03:43:47.830 --> 03:43:47.840 align:start position:0%
you can represent
 
03:43:51.110 --> 03:43:51.120 align:start position:0%
gather you can address that question
 
03:43:54.790 --> 03:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:01.030 --> 03:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:04.229 --> 03:44:04.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:06.790 --> 03:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
and one uh one final reminder without
 
03:44:08.790 --> 03:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
hearing again from the judicial system
 
03:44:08.800 --> 03:44:09.670 align:start position:0%
hearing again from the judicial system
um

03:44:09.670 --> 03:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:11.510 --> 03:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
to see whether this amendment actually
 
03:44:13.110 --> 03:44:13.120 align:start position:0%
does anything to solve the problem that
 
03:44:15.269 --> 03:44:15.279 align:start position:0%
they raised during the public hearing
 
03:44:19.510 --> 03:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:19.520 --> 03:44:20.950 align:start position:0%
 
pass

03:44:20.950 --> 03:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
pass
 
03:44:23.429 --> 03:44:23.439 align:start position:0%
what looks to be a very complicated
 
03:44:23.439 --> 03:44:24.870 align:start position:0%
what looks to be a very complicated
procedure

03:44:24.870 --> 03:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
03:44:26.710 --> 03:44:26.720 align:start position:0%
that will require a fair amount of
 
03:44:26.720 --> 03:44:28.870 align:start position:0%
that will require a fair amount of
training

03:44:28.870 --> 03:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
training
 
03:44:31.590 --> 03:44:31.600 align:start position:0%
throughout the court system um you know
 
03:44:35.269 --> 03:44:35.279 align:start position:0%
in order to implement um
 
03:44:35.279 --> 03:44:36.309 align:start position:0%

uh
 
03:44:38.630 --> 03:44:38.640 align:start position:0%
regardless of the fact that the bill is
 
03:44:40.229 --> 03:44:40.239 align:start position:0%
you know it's obviously well intended
 
03:44:41.830 --> 03:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
and it does take care of an issue i
 
03:44:41.840 --> 03:44:42.710 align:start position:0%
and it does take care of an issue i
think

03:44:42.710 --> 03:44:42.720 align:start position:0%
think
 
03:44:43.990 --> 03:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
part of the challenge for us as
 
03:44:46.389 --> 03:44:46.399 align:start position:0%

um this bill was brought to us
 
03:50:27.910 --> 03:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
with the intention of fixing what um i
 
03:50:32.309 --> 03:50:32.319 align:start position:0%
see as a grievous grievous um
 
03:50:34.550 --> 03:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
situation where whereby
 
03:50:36.790 --> 03:50:36.800 align:start position:0%
an inmate can take
 
03:50:39.030 --> 03:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
and utilize
 
03:50:43.110 --> 03:50:43.120 align:start position:0%
short video courses um taken on an ipad
 
03:50:44.710 --> 03:50:44.720 align:start position:0%
to shave months and months and months
 
03:50:46.070 --> 03:50:46.080 align:start position:0%
off their sentence
 
03:50:49.750 --> 03:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
as kind of a catch-all versus um having
 
03:50:52.710 --> 03:50:52.720 align:start position:0%
to take a legitimate and and vetted
 
03:50:52.720 --> 03:50:53.750 align:start position:0%
to take a legitimate and and vetted
course

03:50:53.750 --> 03:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
course
 
03:50:55.670 --> 03:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
that that invested more of their time
 
03:50:58.710 --> 03:50:58.720 align:start position:0%
and energy um and this the way it was
 
03:51:01.110 --> 03:51:01.120 align:start position:0%
set up and the way it's run right now
 
03:51:01.120 --> 03:51:01.830 align:start position:0%
set up and the way it's run right now
is

03:51:01.830 --> 03:51:01.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:51:03.990 --> 03:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
ripe for abuse i think that the
 
03:51:04.000 --> 03:51:05.830 align:start position:0%
ripe for abuse i think that the
commissioner

03:51:05.830 --> 03:51:05.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
03:51:07.910 --> 03:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
we have currently is is
 
03:51:09.990 --> 03:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
excellent but we have to look at this
 
03:51:12.630 --> 03:51:12.640 align:start position:0%
from a perspective of of the future
 
03:51:15.189 --> 03:51:15.199 align:start position:0%
and where by all the other
 
03:51:15.199 --> 03:51:16.469 align:start position:0%
and where by all the other
mechanisms

03:51:16.469 --> 03:51:16.479 align:start position:0%
mechanisms
 
03:51:18.150 --> 03:51:18.160 align:start position:0%
to get earn time credit they're only
 
03:51:20.229 --> 03:51:20.239 align:start position:0%
allowed to use once
 
03:51:22.790 --> 03:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
this specific
 
03:51:24.870 --> 03:51:24.880 align:start position:0%
program allows them to use it multiple
 
03:51:24.880 --> 03:51:25.990 align:start position:0%
program allows them to use it multiple
times

03:51:25.990 --> 03:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
times
 
03:51:29.030 --> 03:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
so they can get time off their sentence
 
03:51:31.110 --> 03:51:31.120 align:start position:0%
by simply laying in their bunk and
 
03:51:33.830 --> 03:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
watching a video on an ipad i just don't
 
03:51:36.229 --> 03:51:36.239 align:start position:0%
think that was the intent of this
 
03:51:36.239 --> 03:51:42.469 align:start position:0%
think that was the intent of this
program

03:51:42.469 --> 03:51:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:44.229 --> 03:51:44.239 align:start position:0%

03:52:50.960 --> 03:52:52.830 align:start position:0%
what else oh and
the

03:52:52.830 --> 03:52:52.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:52:56.229 --> 03:52:56.239 align:start position:0%
ex-chair of the parole board
 
03:52:56.239 --> 03:52:57.030 align:start position:0%
ex-chair of the parole board
said

03:52:57.030 --> 03:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
said
 
03:53:00.710 --> 03:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
in her evaluation of the tablet program
 
03:53:02.950 --> 03:53:02.960 align:start position:0%
that she did not think it was good
 
03:53:06.229 --> 03:53:06.239 align:start position:0%
enough for earned time off but she had
 
03:53:09.750 --> 03:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
never had access to the tablet program
 
03:53:11.189 --> 03:53:11.199 align:start position:0%
so she doesn't know what she was
 
03:53:11.199 --> 03:53:12.630 align:start position:0%
so she doesn't know what she was
evaluating

03:53:12.630 --> 03:53:12.640 align:start position:0%
evaluating
 
03:53:12.640 --> 03:53:14.229 align:start position:0%
evaluating
so

03:53:14.229 --> 03:53:14.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:53:15.990 --> 03:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
based on the character of the
 
03:53:17.990 --> 03:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner of corrections
 
03:53:19.670 --> 03:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
and her
 
03:53:22.550 --> 03:53:22.560 align:start position:0%
desire to have good results
 
03:53:25.269 --> 03:53:25.279 align:start position:0%
and i have to trust that she is doing
 
03:53:27.670 --> 03:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
her job adequately
 
03:53:30.150 --> 03:53:30.160 align:start position:0%
and i put my trust in her
 
03:53:33.189 --> 03:53:33.199 align:start position:0%
then i would not
 
03:53:39.590 --> 03:53:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:41.030 --> 03:53:41.040 align:start position:0%

is a one-time

that's that's as it's written

says one-time reduction i keep going
 
03:54:55.670 --> 03:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
down the list
 
03:54:56.950 --> 03:54:56.960 align:start position:0%
the only one that doesn't have the

one-time
 
03:55:01.830 --> 03:55:01.840 align:start position:0%
reduction here
 
03:55:03.670 --> 03:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
is um
 
03:55:05.349 --> 03:55:05.359 align:start position:0%
section f which is really more of a
 
03:55:05.359 --> 03:55:06.950 align:start position:0%
section f which is really more of a
catch-all

03:55:06.950 --> 03:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
catch-all
 
03:55:06.960 --> 03:55:08.550 align:start position:0%
catch-all
and

03:55:08.550 --> 03:55:08.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:55:11.030 --> 03:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
there's nothing suggesting that that
 
03:55:12.790 --> 03:55:12.800 align:start position:0%
the discretion that is permitted under
 
03:55:16.950 --> 03:55:16.960 align:start position:0%
section f is being misused or abused
 
03:55:18.630 --> 03:55:18.640 align:start position:0%
but there isn't much of a criteria other
 
03:55:20.630 --> 03:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
than simply whether it's approved by the
 
03:55:20.640 --> 03:55:21.990 align:start position:0%
than simply whether it's approved by the
commissioner

03:55:21.990 --> 03:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
03:55:23.670 --> 03:55:23.680 align:start position:0%
or not
 
03:55:25.429 --> 03:55:25.439 align:start position:0%
in the difference between this section
 
03:55:27.830 --> 03:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
and the other sections is is that any
 
03:55:29.990 --> 03:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
inmate can take
 
03:55:32.309 --> 03:55:32.319 align:start position:0%
any of the programs from a through e
 
03:55:34.550 --> 03:55:34.560 align:start position:0%
and it would apply equally where under
 
03:55:36.309 --> 03:55:36.319 align:start position:0%
section f
 
03:55:38.469 --> 03:55:38.479 align:start position:0%
one inmate can complete a program
 
03:55:39.750 --> 03:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
and another inmate can do that same
 
03:55:41.429 --> 03:55:41.439 align:start position:0%
program and not necessarily get the earn
 
03:55:42.870 --> 03:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
time credit
 
03:55:45.349 --> 03:55:45.359 align:start position:0%
now there may be a reason for that and
 
03:55:47.750 --> 03:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
part has to do is would that
 
03:55:49.030 --> 03:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
tablet program
 
03:55:49.040 --> 03:55:50.070 align:start position:0%
tablet program
actually

03:55:50.070 --> 03:55:50.080 align:start position:0%
actually
 
03:55:53.110 --> 03:55:53.120 align:start position:0%
do anything or maybe assist that i mean
 
03:55:55.429 --> 03:55:55.439 align:start position:0%
inmate in rehabilitation
 
03:55:56.309 --> 03:55:56.319 align:start position:0%
i think that's something that the
 
03:55:58.550 --> 03:55:58.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner would would need to
 
03:55:58.560 --> 03:55:59.830 align:start position:0%
commissioner would would need to
decide

03:55:59.830 --> 03:55:59.840 align:start position:0%
decide
 
03:56:02.389 --> 03:56:02.399 align:start position:0%
i my concern is is that this seems to be
 
03:56:04.790 --> 03:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
a catch-all but also
 
03:56:06.790 --> 03:56:06.800 align:start position:0%
in theory someone could
 
03:56:07.990 --> 03:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
complete this
 
03:56:09.269 --> 03:56:09.279 align:start position:0%
ten and a half times and they would
 
03:56:11.349 --> 03:56:11.359 align:start position:0%
reach the 21 month
 
03:56:11.359 --> 03:56:13.269 align:start position:0%
reach the 21 month
threshold

03:56:13.269 --> 03:56:13.279 align:start position:0%
threshold
 
03:56:15.590 --> 03:56:15.600 align:start position:0%
i feel that if someone wanted to try to
 
03:56:16.950 --> 03:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
reduce their time they have the other
 
03:56:19.110 --> 03:56:19.120 align:start position:0%
sections this expressly excludes the
 
03:56:21.030 --> 03:56:21.040 align:start position:0%
other sections as well so
 
03:56:24.389 --> 03:56:24.399 align:start position:0%
an inmate would still be able to
 
03:56:26.469 --> 03:56:26.479 align:start position:0%
work towards getting the 21 months
 
03:56:28.229 --> 03:56:28.239 align:start position:0%
earned times credit it's just they
 
03:56:30.309 --> 03:56:30.319 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be limited on the catch-all
 
03:56:30.319 --> 03:56:31.269 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be limited on the catch-all
provision

03:56:31.269 --> 03:56:31.279 align:start position:0%
provision
 
03:56:32.870 --> 03:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
what i would be supportive of too is
 
03:56:35.269 --> 03:56:35.279 align:start position:0%
expanding well a through e if there are
 
03:56:37.189 --> 03:56:37.199 align:start position:0%
other sections even added to that one of
 
03:56:38.790 --> 03:56:38.800 align:start position:0%
them potentially could be getting a
 
03:56:40.389 --> 03:56:40.399 align:start position:0%
professional license
 
03:56:43.030 --> 03:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
uh some sometimes with a criminal record
 
03:56:44.790 --> 03:56:44.800 align:start position:0%
a person could be excluded
 
03:56:46.630 --> 03:56:46.640 align:start position:0%
from being eligible for those licenses
 
03:56:48.630 --> 03:56:48.640 align:start position:0%
but we could always exclude those
 
03:56:48.640 --> 03:56:49.670 align:start position:0%
but we could always exclude those
include

03:56:49.670 --> 03:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
include
 
03:56:52.870 --> 03:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
excuse me expand those those
 
03:56:52.880 --> 03:56:53.990 align:start position:0%
excuse me expand those those
sections

03:56:53.990 --> 03:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
sections
 
03:56:55.590 --> 03:56:55.600 align:start position:0%
so that's also an option but having a
 
03:56:57.910 --> 03:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
catch-all that can be basically used
 
03:56:59.590 --> 03:56:59.600 align:start position:0%
exclusively to
 
03:57:01.110 --> 03:57:01.120 align:start position:0%
maximize earn time credit i don't think
 
03:57:03.510 --> 03:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
that that's the intent of the
 
03:57:03.520 --> 03:57:04.630 align:start position:0%
that that's the intent of the
program

03:57:04.630 --> 03:57:04.640 align:start position:0%
program
 
03:57:06.150 --> 03:57:06.160 align:start position:0%
in my opinion that can even take away
 
03:57:07.590 --> 03:57:07.600 align:start position:0%
from some of the other
 
03:57:10.950 --> 03:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
programs in the mental health
 
03:57:12.469 --> 03:57:12.479 align:start position:0%
section the
 
03:57:14.229 --> 03:57:14.239 align:start position:0%
educational section
 
03:57:16.870 --> 03:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
if a person is simply able to just
 
03:57:18.070 --> 03:57:18.080 align:start position:0%
do a
 
03:57:19.590 --> 03:57:19.600 align:start position:0%
listen to a lecture that's an hour long
 
03:57:20.710 --> 03:57:20.720 align:start position:0%
on a tablet
 
03:57:24.309 --> 03:57:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:26.070 --> 03:57:26.080 align:start position:0%
that i i just feel it's too open-ended
 
03:57:27.830 --> 03:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
and i'm i
 
03:57:31.110 --> 03:57:31.120 align:start position:0%
think we can do something to perhaps
 
03:57:33.030 --> 03:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
solve this problem but i see as written
 
03:57:36.790 --> 03:57:36.800 align:start position:0%
now it it is ripe to be taken advantage
 
03:57:36.800 --> 03:57:37.670 align:start position:0%
now it it is ripe to be taken advantage
of

03:57:37.670 --> 03:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:57:39.510 --> 03:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
that's just my my opinion and i'm not
 
03:57:41.830 --> 03:57:41.840 align:start position:0%
saying that that's happening now
 
03:57:41.840 --> 03:57:42.630 align:start position:0%
saying that that's happening now
so

03:57:42.630 --> 03:57:42.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:57:44.150 --> 03:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
that's the point of this bill if anyone
 
03:57:46.950 --> 03:57:46.960 align:start position:0%
has any suggestions i'm
 
03:57:49.590 --> 03:57:49.600 align:start position:0%
representative boyd name
 
03:57:50.790 --> 03:57:50.800 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman i don't have a
 
03:57:50.800 --> 03:57:52.389 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman i don't have a
suggestion

03:57:52.389 --> 03:57:52.399 align:start position:0%
suggestion
 
03:57:52.399 --> 03:57:53.510 align:start position:0%
suggestion
but

03:57:53.510 --> 03:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:57:56.550 --> 03:57:56.560 align:start position:0%
i will note that each of these earned
 
03:57:59.590 --> 03:57:59.600 align:start position:0%
time credit reductions
 
03:57:59.600 --> 03:58:00.469 align:start position:0%
time credit reductions
are

03:58:00.469 --> 03:58:00.479 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:58:02.309 --> 03:58:02.319 align:start position:0%
approved has to be approved by the
 
03:58:04.870 --> 03:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner so
 
03:58:06.790 --> 03:58:06.800 align:start position:0%
for you to get credit for your high
 
03:58:08.309 --> 03:58:08.319 align:start position:0%
school diploma
 
03:58:09.670 --> 03:58:09.680 align:start position:0%
that has to be approved by the
 
03:58:09.680 --> 03:58:11.990 align:start position:0%
that has to be approved by the
commissioner

03:58:11.990 --> 03:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
03:58:12.000 --> 03:58:12.950 align:start position:0%
commissioner
so

03:58:12.950 --> 03:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:58:15.590 --> 03:58:15.600 align:start position:0%
if the commissioner is approving all
 
03:58:17.510 --> 03:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
earned time credit
 
03:58:17.520 --> 03:58:18.550 align:start position:0%
earned time credit
then

03:58:18.550 --> 03:58:18.560 align:start position:0%
then
 
03:58:20.070 --> 03:58:20.080 align:start position:0%
they she
 
03:58:21.990 --> 03:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
the commissioner knows
 
03:58:24.950 --> 03:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
what they are getting for their value
 
03:58:26.950 --> 03:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
what value they're getting for
 
03:58:28.550 --> 03:58:28.560 align:start position:0%
the program
 
03:58:31.590 --> 03:58:31.600 align:start position:0%
so i will still have to say if the
 
03:58:33.590 --> 03:58:33.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner thinks
 
03:58:35.750 --> 03:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
that a repeated
 
03:58:35.760 --> 03:58:37.590 align:start position:0%
that a repeated
r

03:58:37.590 --> 03:58:37.600 align:start position:0%
r
 
03:58:39.830 --> 03:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
use of f
 
03:58:42.309 --> 03:58:42.319 align:start position:0%
other programs
 
03:58:44.469 --> 03:58:44.479 align:start position:0%
is warranted then
 
03:58:46.950 --> 03:58:46.960 align:start position:0%
let's go for it
 
03:58:53.269 --> 03:58:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:55.189 --> 03:58:55.199 align:start position:0%
representative uh representative ray
 
03:58:55.199 --> 03:58:57.269 align:start position:0%
representative uh representative ray
newman

03:58:57.269 --> 03:58:57.279 align:start position:0%
newman
 
03:59:00.229 --> 03:59:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:03.590 --> 03:59:03.600 align:start position:0%
i know in the testimony we heard
 
03:59:05.349 --> 03:59:05.359 align:start position:0%
we constantly heard about the prisoners
 
03:59:07.110 --> 03:59:07.120 align:start position:0%
lying on their beds getting an hour time
 
03:59:09.110 --> 03:59:09.120 align:start position:0%
and knocking off and getting an
 
03:59:11.750 --> 03:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
additional amount of credit
 
03:59:14.790 --> 03:59:14.800 align:start position:0%
through the year in time credits
 
03:59:16.229 --> 03:59:16.239 align:start position:0%
i also
 
03:59:18.229 --> 03:59:18.239 align:start position:0%
as best my recollection
 
03:59:18.239 --> 03:59:19.910 align:start position:0%
as best my recollection
that

03:59:19.910 --> 03:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:59:21.269 --> 03:59:21.279 align:start position:0%
i don't know that we heard from the
 
03:59:23.110 --> 03:59:23.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner that that
 
03:59:24.870 --> 03:59:24.880 align:start position:0%
how that happened to where that where
 
03:59:27.429 --> 03:59:27.439 align:start position:0%
that information comes from
 
03:59:29.590 --> 03:59:29.600 align:start position:0%
and i know that she did testify that she
 
03:59:30.870 --> 03:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to
 
03:59:33.990 --> 03:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
improve the way that the these the
 
03:59:36.389 --> 03:59:36.399 align:start position:0%
tablets that they now have
 
03:59:37.990 --> 03:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
in the prison
 
03:59:38.830 --> 03:59:38.840 align:start position:0%
could be
 
03:59:41.269 --> 03:59:41.279 align:start position:0%
used and there
 
03:59:43.189 --> 03:59:43.199 align:start position:0%
and she wanted to make sure that the
 
03:59:45.269 --> 03:59:45.279 align:start position:0%
programs that she did that
 
03:59:47.349 --> 03:59:47.359 align:start position:0%
that she approved were ones that would
 
03:59:49.269 --> 03:59:49.279 align:start position:0%
be of value to the people who were
 
03:59:51.429 --> 03:59:51.439 align:start position:0%
taking the programs
 
03:59:53.750 --> 03:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
and i just think this is again something
 
03:59:55.510 --> 03:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
where we hear an anecdotal one-time
 
03:59:56.630 --> 03:59:56.640 align:start position:0%
thing happened and it was in the
 
03:59:57.990 --> 03:59:58.000 align:start position:0%
pandemic and
 
03:59:59.750 --> 03:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
that may have happened
 
04:00:02.389 --> 04:00:02.399 align:start position:0%
but i think that this door might there
 
04:00:04.550 --> 04:00:04.560 align:start position:0%
might be a really good reason why people
 
04:00:06.469 --> 04:00:06.479 align:start position:0%
should get maybe maybe they could have
 
04:00:08.710 --> 04:00:08.720 align:start position:0%
two of these courses and we have the
 
04:00:11.670 --> 04:00:11.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner who who understands
 
04:00:13.429 --> 04:00:13.439 align:start position:0%
the value of it and is trying to improve
 
04:00:16.550 --> 04:00:16.560 align:start position:0%
it and i'm afraid that this will
 
04:00:19.269 --> 04:00:19.279 align:start position:0%
close the door on multiple use of this
 
04:00:22.150 --> 04:00:22.160 align:start position:0%
and multiple use of the tablets and
 
04:00:25.349 --> 04:00:25.359 align:start position:0%
therefore i can't support this bill
 
04:00:28.150 --> 04:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
if i may inquire with with a question
 
04:00:31.269 --> 04:00:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:33.189 --> 04:00:33.199 align:start position:0%
if i say the word amendment is i'm going
 
04:00:35.750 --> 04:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
to say a point of order
 
04:00:37.189 --> 04:00:37.199 align:start position:0%
are you asking me about it
 
04:00:38.870 --> 04:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
if there was an amendment
 
04:00:40.150 --> 04:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
per se
 
04:00:42.469 --> 04:00:42.479 align:start position:0%
an improvement to the bill not
 
04:00:44.630 --> 04:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
that allowed it to be taken
 
04:00:45.910 --> 04:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
two times
 
04:00:47.349 --> 04:00:47.359 align:start position:0%
under section
 
04:00:47.359 --> 04:00:48.550 align:start position:0%
under section
f

04:00:48.550 --> 04:00:48.560 align:start position:0%
f
 
04:00:53.590 --> 04:00:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:55.990 --> 04:00:56.000 align:start position:0%
i would be supportive of a policy i
 
04:00:57.510 --> 04:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
don't know that we know what the number
 
04:00:59.510 --> 04:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
is that is the correct limitation that
 
04:01:01.269 --> 04:01:01.279 align:start position:0%
the commissioner believes ought to be
 
04:01:03.590 --> 04:01:03.600 align:start position:0%
allowed in order to
 
04:01:05.990 --> 04:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
make accurate use of this program which
 
04:01:07.670 --> 04:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
is on the tablet and the tablet's a new
 
04:01:09.750 --> 04:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
thing to the prisons
 
04:01:11.269 --> 04:01:11.279 align:start position:0%
right now the numbers that we're closing
 
04:01:13.030 --> 04:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
the door what right now the number would
 
04:01:14.710 --> 04:01:14.720 align:start position:0%
be 11 that's how you would get to 21
 
04:01:14.720 --> 04:01:16.070 align:start position:0%
be 11 that's how you would get to 21
months

04:01:16.070 --> 04:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
months
 
04:01:16.080 --> 04:01:17.750 align:start position:0%
months
so

04:01:17.750 --> 04:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:01:18.950 --> 04:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
that might not be the right number
 
04:01:20.469 --> 04:01:20.479 align:start position:0%
either i'm just saying i'm afraid that
 
04:01:22.950 --> 04:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
this slams the door on the opportunity
 
04:01:24.630 --> 04:01:24.640 align:start position:0%
that we have for prisoners to get
 
04:01:27.269 --> 04:01:27.279 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation in an adequate way and
 
04:01:29.269 --> 04:01:29.279 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned about that and therefore i
 
04:01:32.550 --> 04:01:32.560 align:start position:0%
will not support this bill
 
04:01:35.110 --> 04:01:35.120 align:start position:0%
representative harrygath right
 
04:01:36.630 --> 04:01:36.640 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i remember from
 
04:01:36.640 --> 04:01:37.750 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i remember from
that

04:01:37.750 --> 04:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:01:40.309 --> 04:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
that day is that the commissioner stated
 
04:01:43.030 --> 04:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
because it was said that people were
 
04:01:45.189 --> 04:01:45.199 align:start position:0%
finishing the course within 15 30
 
04:01:47.030 --> 04:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
minutes and things of that nature and
 
04:01:49.110 --> 04:01:49.120 align:start position:0%
what she said was that she was looking
 
04:01:51.110 --> 04:01:51.120 align:start position:0%
into that because
 
04:01:54.150 --> 04:01:54.160 align:start position:0%
that she felt there was an issue with
 
04:01:56.630 --> 04:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
whatever gives that information so it
 
04:01:59.269 --> 04:01:59.279 align:start position:0%
wasn't enough data or true data to
 
04:02:01.910 --> 04:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
actually determine if in fact that was
 
04:02:01.920 --> 04:02:04.150 align:start position:0%
actually determine if in fact that was
happening

04:02:04.150 --> 04:02:04.160 align:start position:0%
happening
 
04:02:06.070 --> 04:02:06.080 align:start position:0%
so again
 
04:02:07.830 --> 04:02:07.840 align:start position:0%
i'm like the rest of the team pretty
 
04:02:09.349 --> 04:02:09.359 align:start position:0%
much um
 
04:02:11.349 --> 04:02:11.359 align:start position:0%
a lot of respect for the commissioner
 
04:02:12.870 --> 04:02:12.880 align:start position:0%
she does a great job
 
04:02:15.189 --> 04:02:15.199 align:start position:0%
i feel that this takes that away from
 
04:02:18.070 --> 04:02:18.080 align:start position:0%
her from doing her job
 
04:02:19.670 --> 04:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
and i feel as though that she should be
 
04:02:21.670 --> 04:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
the one to make that decision she knows
 
04:02:23.189 --> 04:02:23.199 align:start position:0%
the prisoners better than you me or
 
04:02:25.910 --> 04:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
anybody else around this table
 
04:02:30.150 --> 04:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:32.469 --> 04:02:32.479 align:start position:0%
representative muse
 
04:02:34.469 --> 04:02:34.479 align:start position:0%
i think one one of the positive uh
 
04:02:36.309 --> 04:02:36.319 align:start position:0%
things about having this hearing and
 
04:02:38.710 --> 04:02:38.720 align:start position:0%
this discussion is
 
04:02:41.110 --> 04:02:41.120 align:start position:0%
that a lot of us know a lot more now
 
04:02:42.790 --> 04:02:42.800 align:start position:0%
about earned time credits than maybe we
 
04:02:44.550 --> 04:02:44.560 align:start position:0%
ever wanted to know or ever thought we
 
04:02:47.349 --> 04:02:47.359 align:start position:0%
were going to need to know
 
04:02:51.269 --> 04:02:51.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:52.870 --> 04:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
but one of the things
 
04:02:55.110 --> 04:02:55.120 align:start position:0%
i i think we we really do need to keep
 
04:02:57.429 --> 04:02:57.439 align:start position:0%
in mind is
 
04:03:00.309 --> 04:03:00.319 align:start position:0%
we put people like commissioner hanks in
 
04:03:02.550 --> 04:03:02.560 align:start position:0%
a position of authority for a reason we
 
04:03:03.750 --> 04:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
allow them
 
04:03:03.760 --> 04:03:04.630 align:start position:0%
allow them
to

04:03:04.630 --> 04:03:04.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:03:06.150 --> 04:03:06.160 align:start position:0%
to shape
 
04:03:08.790 --> 04:03:08.800 align:start position:0%
their programs in a particular way
 
04:03:08.800 --> 04:03:09.830 align:start position:0%
their programs in a particular way
because

04:03:09.830 --> 04:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:03:11.510 --> 04:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
frankly they have
 
04:03:13.830 --> 04:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
people like commissioner hanks have
 
04:03:16.229 --> 04:03:16.239 align:start position:0%
just domain knowledge that we do not
 
04:03:16.239 --> 04:03:17.910 align:start position:0%
just domain knowledge that we do not
have

04:03:17.910 --> 04:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:03:20.710 --> 04:03:20.720 align:start position:0%
she's interacting with inmates
 
04:03:22.630 --> 04:03:22.640 align:start position:0%
virtually every day she's interacting
 
04:03:24.950 --> 04:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
with their own victim services people
 
04:03:27.189 --> 04:03:27.199 align:start position:0%
every day
 
04:03:28.950 --> 04:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
there's no one who's more on top of this
 
04:03:31.750 --> 04:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
situation in my opinion
 
04:03:34.950 --> 04:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
than than than she is and
 
04:03:36.309 --> 04:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
i feel like
 
04:03:39.510 --> 04:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
when we when we pass bills like this
 
04:03:42.790 --> 04:03:42.800 align:start position:0%
as as well-intentioned as we may be
 
04:03:44.229 --> 04:03:44.239 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we're doing is
 
04:03:44.239 --> 04:03:45.110 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we're doing is
we're

04:03:45.110 --> 04:03:45.120 align:start position:0%
we're
 
04:03:45.120 --> 04:03:46.550 align:start position:0%
we're
interjecting

04:03:46.550 --> 04:03:46.560 align:start position:0%
interjecting
 
04:03:48.469 --> 04:03:48.479 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
04:03:51.349 --> 04:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
into yet another issue where
 
04:03:51.359 --> 04:03:52.870 align:start position:0%
into yet another issue where
we

04:03:52.870 --> 04:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:03:55.110 --> 04:03:55.120 align:start position:0%
with all good intentions try to
 
04:03:56.950 --> 04:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
micromanage an issue
 
04:03:56.960 --> 04:03:57.990 align:start position:0%
micromanage an issue
that

04:03:57.990 --> 04:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:04:01.349 --> 04:04:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:03.269 --> 04:04:03.279 align:start position:0%
maybe a few hours really trying to pick
 
04:04:07.910 --> 04:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:11.030 --> 04:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
my tendency here is
 
04:04:13.110 --> 04:04:13.120 align:start position:0%
essentially is
 
04:04:13.120 --> 04:04:14.550 align:start position:0%
essentially is
without

04:04:14.550 --> 04:04:14.560 align:start position:0%
without
 
04:04:17.189 --> 04:04:17.199 align:start position:0%
without knowing uh you know more about
 
04:04:19.110 --> 04:04:19.120 align:start position:0%
this system without knowing more about
 
04:04:20.710 --> 04:04:20.720 align:start position:0%
these programs without knowing a lot
 
04:04:23.830 --> 04:04:23.840 align:start position:0%
more about their impact on prisoners
 
04:04:25.830 --> 04:04:25.840 align:start position:0%
this just strikes me as just a very
 
04:04:25.840 --> 04:04:27.189 align:start position:0%
this just strikes me as just a very
precise

04:04:27.189 --> 04:04:27.199 align:start position:0%
precise
 
04:04:29.349 --> 04:04:29.359 align:start position:0%
technical way to just
 
04:04:30.870 --> 04:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
put a handicap
 
04:04:32.150 --> 04:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
in front of the ability of the
 
04:04:32.160 --> 04:04:33.670 align:start position:0%
in front of the ability of the
commissioner

04:04:33.670 --> 04:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
04:04:36.389 --> 04:04:36.399 align:start position:0%
to rehabilitate um the people under her
 
04:04:36.399 --> 04:04:37.750 align:start position:0%
to rehabilitate um the people under her
charge

04:04:37.750 --> 04:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
charge
 
04:04:39.349 --> 04:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
and and i think it's something we really
 
04:04:42.229 --> 04:04:42.239 align:start position:0%
all need to think twice about before we
 
04:04:44.710 --> 04:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
do i mean one of the goals i know
 
04:04:47.030 --> 04:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
that we're you know that
 
04:04:48.550 --> 04:04:48.560 align:start position:0%
one of the things i think most of us
 
04:04:50.389 --> 04:04:50.399 align:start position:0%
have been able to agree on
 
04:04:52.790 --> 04:04:52.800 align:start position:0%
uh in this in this legislative session
 
04:04:52.800 --> 04:04:53.590 align:start position:0%
uh in this in this legislative session
is

04:04:53.590 --> 04:04:53.600 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:04:55.510 --> 04:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
having people in
 
04:04:58.309 --> 04:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
in prison um you know with no hope of
 
04:05:00.389 --> 04:05:00.399 align:start position:0%
getting out and with little hope of
 
04:05:02.630 --> 04:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation is not a good thing for
 
04:05:04.950 --> 04:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
them it's not a good thing it's not a
 
04:05:06.710 --> 04:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
good thing for the state
 
04:05:10.150 --> 04:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
so the idea is to get people out
 
04:05:12.309 --> 04:05:12.319 align:start position:0%
you know who just don't agree that this
 
04:05:16.389 --> 04:05:16.399 align:start position:0%
is the right way to come at the problem
 
04:05:17.590 --> 04:05:17.600 align:start position:0%
so one
 
04:05:20.150 --> 04:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
one one positive from all of our healthy
 
04:05:22.309 --> 04:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
discussions here is
 
04:05:25.189 --> 04:05:25.199 align:start position:0%
this is section f is a is a new
 
04:05:27.910 --> 04:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
new policy and from what i understand
 
04:05:30.950 --> 04:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
it was kind of put in as
 
04:05:33.670 --> 04:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
part of an ominous bill and at least
 
04:05:36.070 --> 04:05:36.080 align:start position:0%
before the house in this committee
 
04:05:38.550 --> 04:05:38.560 align:start position:0%
the policy that is section f was not
 
04:05:39.910 --> 04:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
something we discussed as a committee
 
04:05:41.349 --> 04:05:41.359 align:start position:0%
last term
 
04:05:42.830 --> 04:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
whether the ought to
 
04:05:45.750 --> 04:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
pass passes or if it's
 
04:05:47.830 --> 04:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
whatever happens thereafter
 
04:05:49.510 --> 04:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
at the very least
 
04:05:51.269 --> 04:05:51.279 align:start position:0%
this committee had had the discussion
 
04:05:53.429 --> 04:05:53.439 align:start position:0%
we've had the hearings in this room
 
04:05:55.349 --> 04:05:55.359 align:start position:0%
so if we don't pass this we at least did
 
04:05:57.269 --> 04:05:57.279 align:start position:0%
our due diligence by
 
04:06:00.229 --> 04:06:00.239 align:start position:0%
not compromising it on and voting one
 
04:06:01.510 --> 04:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
way or another as part of an ominous
 
04:06:03.349 --> 04:06:03.359 align:start position:0%
bill it's really it's now had its
 
04:06:05.750 --> 04:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
hearing before this committee
 
04:06:07.429 --> 04:06:07.439 align:start position:0%
and we'll see how it goes so i think we
 
04:06:09.030 --> 04:06:09.040 align:start position:0%
at least did that and we earned a lot
 
04:06:10.469 --> 04:06:10.479 align:start position:0%
about earntime credits and i will tell
 
04:06:12.229 --> 04:06:12.239 align:start position:0%
you this representative muse if there is
 
04:06:13.670 --> 04:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
a bill to
 
04:06:15.189 --> 04:06:15.199 align:start position:0%
add a section about professional
 
04:06:17.030 --> 04:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
licenses i hope you asked me to
 
04:06:20.070 --> 04:06:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:22.790 --> 04:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
representative true
 
04:06:24.469 --> 04:06:24.479 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
04:06:26.309 --> 04:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
i know uh when the commissioner was here
 
04:06:26.319 --> 04:06:27.429 align:start position:0%
i know uh when the commissioner was here
she

04:06:27.429 --> 04:06:27.439 align:start position:0%
she
 
04:06:29.349 --> 04:06:29.359 align:start position:0%
she told us she was not in favor of the
 
04:06:29.359 --> 04:06:33.830 align:start position:0%
she told us she was not in favor of the
bill

04:06:33.830 --> 04:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:33.840 --> 04:06:34.630 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:06:34.630 --> 04:06:34.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:06:36.710 --> 04:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
i think some of the problems that some
 
04:06:38.710 --> 04:06:38.720 align:start position:0%
people might be looking at
 
04:06:40.950 --> 04:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
with the end time credit program is the
 
04:06:43.349 --> 04:06:43.359 align:start position:0%
uh is the tablets that's that's a that's
 
04:06:45.670 --> 04:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
a new program
 
04:06:49.429 --> 04:06:49.439 align:start position:0%
uh but the commission did say that um
 
04:06:50.870 --> 04:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
there are
 
04:06:53.349 --> 04:06:53.359 align:start position:0%
classes that are set up
 
04:06:53.359 --> 04:06:55.590 align:start position:0%
classes that are set up
because

04:06:55.590 --> 04:06:55.600 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:06:57.750 --> 04:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
the a large
 
04:06:59.990 --> 04:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
section of the prison population is
 
04:07:02.229 --> 04:07:02.239 align:start position:0%
poorly educated
 
04:07:04.229 --> 04:07:04.239 align:start position:0%
so they're probably not going to get a
 
04:07:06.630 --> 04:07:06.640 align:start position:0%
master's degree
 
04:07:09.510 --> 04:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
a business degree or even a high school
 
04:07:09.520 --> 04:07:11.110 align:start position:0%
a business degree or even a high school
diploma

04:07:11.110 --> 04:07:11.120 align:start position:0%
diploma
 
04:07:11.120 --> 04:07:12.309 align:start position:0%
diploma
um

04:07:12.309 --> 04:07:12.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:15.189 --> 04:07:15.199 align:start position:0%
and and i think the uh the tablet was a
 
04:07:17.189 --> 04:07:17.199 align:start position:0%
way to maybe reach out
 
04:07:19.030 --> 04:07:19.040 align:start position:0%
to the uh
 
04:07:22.070 --> 04:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
less educated to get them involved with
 
04:07:26.790 --> 04:07:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:29.830 --> 04:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
if if somebody is able to go on a tablet
 
04:07:29.840 --> 04:07:30.870 align:start position:0%
if if somebody is able to go on a tablet
program

04:07:30.870 --> 04:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:07:32.070 --> 04:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
and do
 
04:07:33.590 --> 04:07:33.600 align:start position:0%
11 programs to
 
04:07:33.600 --> 04:07:35.429 align:start position:0%
11 programs to
[Music]

04:07:35.429 --> 04:07:35.439 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:07:37.750 --> 04:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
theoretically earned 21 months off of
 
04:07:39.830 --> 04:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
their sentence
 
04:07:41.670 --> 04:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
i would say that's abuse
 
04:07:43.750 --> 04:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
and i believe the commissioner said it's
 
04:07:46.070 --> 04:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
up to the commissioner to monitor for
 
04:07:47.830 --> 04:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
any abuse
 
04:07:49.750 --> 04:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
so that somebody could do
 
04:07:51.990 --> 04:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
11 tablet programs
 
04:07:54.870 --> 04:07:54.880 align:start position:0%
that would have been worth 21 months and
 
04:07:56.870 --> 04:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
the commissioner could rule that it's
 
04:07:56.880 --> 04:07:58.149 align:start position:0%
the commissioner could rule that it's
worth

04:07:58.149 --> 04:07:58.159 align:start position:0%
worth
 
04:08:00.870 --> 04:08:00.880 align:start position:0%
120 days
 
04:08:02.229 --> 04:08:02.239 align:start position:0%
and that's all you're going to get for
 
04:08:02.239 --> 04:08:06.229 align:start position:0%
and that's all you're going to get for
it

04:08:06.229 --> 04:08:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:08.389 --> 04:08:08.399 align:start position:0%
knowing as little as i do about end time
 
04:08:08.399 --> 04:08:09.269 align:start position:0%
knowing as little as i do about end time
credit

04:08:09.269 --> 04:08:09.279 align:start position:0%
credit
 
04:08:11.910 --> 04:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
i would have to uh favor going along
 
04:08:13.349 --> 04:08:13.359 align:start position:0%
with the recommendations of the
 
04:08:13.359 --> 04:08:14.710 align:start position:0%
with the recommendations of the
commissioner

04:08:14.710 --> 04:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
04:08:17.110 --> 04:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
and and not favor the bill
 
04:08:22.070 --> 04:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:23.990 --> 04:08:24.000 align:start position:0%

representative welch
 
04:13:58.950 --> 04:13:58.960 align:start position:0%
there was some inquiry about h.b 11
 
04:14:01.590 --> 04:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
excuse me 1335 that was relative to the
 
04:14:03.510 --> 04:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
parole board and the procedure for
 
04:14:05.830 --> 04:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
medical parole of prisoners
 
04:14:07.269 --> 04:14:07.279 align:start position:0%
i know there was

i know there was
two

04:14:08.710 --> 04:14:08.720 align:start position:0%
two
 
04:14:10.950 --> 04:14:10.960 align:start position:0%
word-for-word identical

yes uh the
 
04:14:19.830 --> 04:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
the reason there's two amendments is
 
04:14:23.429 --> 04:14:23.439 align:start position:0%
because the the folks
 
04:14:26.229 --> 04:14:26.239 align:start position:0%
from the parole board had sent it out to
 
04:14:29.110 --> 04:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
representative murphy and they also sent
 
04:14:32.229 --> 04:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
it out to me and a couple of others
 
04:14:35.110 --> 04:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
i put mine in first
 
04:14:37.349 --> 04:14:37.359 align:start position:0%
and representative murphy put his in
 
04:14:40.149 --> 04:14:40.159 align:start position:0%

04:14:49.189 --> 04:14:49.199 align:start position:0%

amends section three of the original
 
04:18:05.920 --> 04:18:19.269 align:start position:0%
amends section three of the original
bill

04:18:19.269 --> 04:18:19.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:21.030 --> 04:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
and what it does
 
04:18:23.910 --> 04:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
it clarifies
 
04:18:25.429 --> 04:18:25.439 align:start position:0%
the the
 
04:18:27.030 --> 04:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
quantifies the practice that they're
 
04:18:31.750 --> 04:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:35.030 --> 04:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
the change
 
04:18:38.389 --> 04:18:38.399 align:start position:0%
on the amendment on line 11.
 
04:18:40.710 --> 04:18:40.720 align:start position:0%
it says the medical parole
 
04:18:40.720 --> 04:18:41.910 align:start position:0%
it says the medical parole
request

04:18:41.910 --> 04:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
request
 
04:18:41.920 --> 04:18:43.030 align:start position:0%
request
shall

04:18:43.030 --> 04:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
shall
 
04:18:44.870 --> 04:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
cite one of the following medical
 
04:18:46.710 --> 04:18:46.720 align:start position:0%
categories and then the amendment that
 
04:18:48.870 --> 04:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
was forwarded to me there was
 
04:18:50.790 --> 04:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
it said should
 
04:18:52.550 --> 04:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
shell is the operative word and that's
 
04:18:53.990 --> 04:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
what we use
 
04:18:56.070 --> 04:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
and they were okay with that i
 
04:18:59.429 --> 04:18:59.439 align:start position:0%
showed the amendment down there to the
 
04:19:01.990 --> 04:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
representative from the department of
 
04:19:04.070 --> 04:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
from the parole board
 
04:19:06.950 --> 04:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
and everything is
 
04:19:09.110 --> 04:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
the way they wanted it
 
04:19:10.710 --> 04:19:10.720 align:start position:0%
the one exception
 
04:19:10.720 --> 04:19:13.269 align:start position:0%
the one exception
is

04:19:13.269 --> 04:19:13.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:15.830 --> 04:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
in in the statutes they talk about
 
04:19:18.229 --> 04:19:18.239 align:start position:0%
prisoners and in this
 
04:19:21.110 --> 04:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
amendment we talk about residents
 
04:19:23.670 --> 04:19:23.680 align:start position:0%
and i guess the appropriate modern term
 
04:19:27.189 --> 04:19:27.199 align:start position:0%
is resident not prisoners
 
04:19:40.790 --> 04:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:40.800 --> 04:19:45.189 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:19:45.189 --> 04:19:45.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:46.870 --> 04:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm going to support this because
 
04:19:48.550 --> 04:19:48.560 align:start position:0%
basically what it does is it does put
 
04:19:50.950 --> 04:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
some good guardrails around this process
 
04:19:53.830 --> 04:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
um and i think it really clarifies uh
 
04:19:56.550 --> 04:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
and helps people better understand uh
 
04:19:56.560 --> 04:19:57.349 align:start position:0%
and helps people better understand uh
when

04:19:57.349 --> 04:19:57.359 align:start position:0%
when
 
04:20:00.309 --> 04:20:00.319 align:start position:0%
uh residents are eligible for this and
 
04:20:02.790 --> 04:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
and when they're not
 
04:20:04.550 --> 04:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
i also think that
 
04:20:07.910 --> 04:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
some of these criteria criteria also
 
04:20:10.469 --> 04:20:10.479 align:start position:0%
reduce the risk of something i think
 
04:20:12.229 --> 04:20:12.239 align:start position:0%
that some people were concerned about
 
04:20:13.349 --> 04:20:13.359 align:start position:0%
during the hearing which is the
 
04:20:16.070 --> 04:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
possibility of a person receiving
 
04:20:18.070 --> 04:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
medical parole
 
04:20:20.229 --> 04:20:20.239 align:start position:0%
who then just gets better and all of a
 
04:20:22.309 --> 04:20:22.319 align:start position:0%
sudden you know there they are out of
 
04:20:24.389 --> 04:20:24.399 align:start position:0%
prison with no supervision
 
04:20:27.429 --> 04:20:27.439 align:start position:0%
so um it it tightens the criteria it
 
04:20:29.189 --> 04:20:29.199 align:start position:0%
makes things more specific it puts
 
04:20:31.429 --> 04:20:31.439 align:start position:0%
guardrails around the process
 
04:20:31.439 --> 04:20:32.309 align:start position:0%
guardrails around the process
um

04:20:32.309 --> 04:20:32.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:34.870 --> 04:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
and uh and the language uh meets with
 
04:20:37.429 --> 04:20:37.439 align:start position:0%
the uh approved the exacting
 
04:20:38.790 --> 04:20:38.800 align:start position:0%
requirements of the department of
 
04:20:38.800 --> 04:20:40.309 align:start position:0%
requirements of the department of
corrections

04:20:40.309 --> 04:20:40.319 align:start position:0%
corrections
 
04:20:49.110 --> 04:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:52.710 --> 04:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
do any member representative true
 
04:20:54.149 --> 04:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman it may be a
 
04:20:55.830 --> 04:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
question of uh
 
04:20:57.990 --> 04:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
of the chair and he can refer to whoever
 
04:20:59.030 --> 04:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
you wish
 
04:21:01.349 --> 04:21:01.359 align:start position:0%
uh department of corrections originally
 
04:21:02.950 --> 04:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
was opposed
 
04:21:04.950 --> 04:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
to the uh to the bill
 
04:21:06.630 --> 04:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
uh but department of corrections now
 
04:21:10.389 --> 04:21:10.399 align:start position:0%
says there they they agree with the bill
 
04:21:14.229 --> 04:21:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:16.149 --> 04:21:16.159 align:start position:0%
representative welch was to address that
 
04:21:18.550 --> 04:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
i believe what had happened is that the
 
04:21:20.469 --> 04:21:20.479 align:start position:0%
parole board and the commissioner of
 
04:21:21.990 --> 04:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
corrections got together and they
 
04:21:24.229 --> 04:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
produced this amendment
 
04:21:27.110 --> 04:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
and uh it was emailed out to us
 
04:21:29.750 --> 04:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
and has been copied into
 
04:21:31.910 --> 04:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
the amendment you see before you and
 
04:21:33.189 --> 04:21:33.199 align:start position:0%
i've shown
 
04:21:35.349 --> 04:21:35.359 align:start position:0%
i took the amendment down and
 
04:21:37.670 --> 04:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
we got the knot of approval from the
 
04:21:38.950 --> 04:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
parole board
 
04:21:43.910 --> 04:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:46.870 --> 04:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
representative boarding
 
04:21:48.309 --> 04:21:48.319 align:start position:0%
actually i
 
04:21:50.950 --> 04:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
checked my notes the commissioner was in
 
04:21:53.349 --> 04:21:53.359 align:start position:0%
favor of the bill but stated it needed
 
04:21:55.030 --> 04:21:55.040 align:start position:0%

you recognize to speak to the amendment
 
04:49:45.030 --> 04:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:45.040 --> 04:49:45.830 align:start position:0%
 
on

04:49:45.830 --> 04:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:49:47.350 --> 04:49:47.360 align:start position:0%
line 10
 
04:49:49.270 --> 04:49:49.280 align:start position:0%
11 and 12
 
04:49:52.550 --> 04:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
is referring to the fact that
 
04:49:55.270 --> 04:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
the the offender
 
04:49:55.280 --> 04:49:56.230 align:start position:0%
the the offender
must

04:49:56.230 --> 04:49:56.240 align:start position:0%
must
 
04:49:58.550 --> 04:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
have interlocked devices put in all
 
04:50:00.550 --> 04:50:00.560 align:start position:0%
vehicles that are registered under his
 
04:50:00.560 --> 04:50:03.110 align:start position:0%
vehicles that are registered under his
name

04:50:03.110 --> 04:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:05.990 --> 04:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
given a scenario that uh
 
04:50:07.830 --> 04:50:07.840 align:start position:0%
he has four cars
 
04:50:09.910 --> 04:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
one for his son one for his daughter one
 
04:50:11.350 --> 04:50:11.360 align:start position:0%
for his wife and they're all under his
 
04:50:11.360 --> 04:50:13.430 align:start position:0%
for his wife and they're all under his
name

04:50:13.430 --> 04:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
name
 
04:50:15.350 --> 04:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
it is my opinion that that is an
 
04:50:18.550 --> 04:50:18.560 align:start position:0%
excessive penalty financially
 
04:50:20.470 --> 04:50:20.480 align:start position:0%
to the family
 
04:50:23.670 --> 04:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:25.510 --> 04:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
an israelite device costing anywhere
 
04:50:27.590 --> 04:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
between one and two thousand dollars per
 
04:50:27.600 --> 04:50:28.868 align:start position:0%
between one and two thousand dollars per
vehicle

04:50:28.868 --> 04:50:28.878 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
04:50:30.550 --> 04:50:30.560 align:start position:0%
eight thousand dollars
 
04:50:31.750 --> 04:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
04:50:34.230 --> 04:50:34.240 align:start position:0%
to qualify
 
04:50:36.310 --> 04:50:36.320 align:start position:0%
under the original bill
 
04:50:39.910 --> 04:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
what my bill does it removes the
 
04:50:41.990 --> 04:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
the stipulation that all vehicles
 
04:50:42.000 --> 04:50:43.270 align:start position:0%
the stipulation that all vehicles
registered

04:50:43.270 --> 04:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
registered
 
04:50:44.948 --> 04:50:44.958 align:start position:0%
under his name
 
04:50:47.190 --> 04:50:47.200 align:start position:0%
must have the interlock device
 
04:50:49.350 --> 04:50:49.360 align:start position:0%
and it changes that to
 
04:50:51.430 --> 04:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
the vehicle being driven
 
04:50:53.830 --> 04:50:53.840 align:start position:0%
by the offender must have an interlock
 
04:50:58.628 --> 04:50:58.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:00.230 --> 04:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
and i offer that amendment just because
 
04:51:03.030 --> 04:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
i feel that the original bill
 
04:51:05.110 --> 04:51:05.120 align:start position:0%
granted original law
 
04:51:07.830 --> 04:51:07.840 align:start position:0%
already in law was too excessive
 
04:51:10.788 --> 04:51:10.798 align:start position:0%
it was excessive to the family
 
04:51:12.788 --> 04:51:12.798 align:start position:0%
that did nothing wrong
 
04:51:14.708 --> 04:51:14.718 align:start position:0%
and the idea is to
 
04:51:18.550 --> 04:51:18.560 align:start position:0%
to uh qualify the offender to drive only
 
04:51:20.708 --> 04:51:20.718 align:start position:0%
a vehicle that has interlocked devices
 
04:51:22.070 --> 04:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
and that's what i feel the amendment
 
04:51:22.080 --> 04:51:24.788 align:start position:0%
and that's what i feel the amendment
does

04:51:24.788 --> 04:51:24.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:26.230 --> 04:51:26.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
04:51:29.430 --> 04:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to this is gonna be very
 
04:51:31.830 --> 04:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
straightforward we had a bill last that
 
04:51:36.310 --> 04:51:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:36.320 --> 04:51:37.910 align:start position:0%
 
hb

04:51:37.910 --> 04:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
hb
 
04:51:42.070 --> 04:51:42.080 align:start position:0%
1085. and we discussed this exact issue
 
04:51:44.230 --> 04:51:44.240 align:start position:0%
for a very long time i want to say about
 
04:51:46.230 --> 04:51:46.240 align:start position:0%
45 minutes
 
04:51:47.910 --> 04:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
give or take
 
04:51:50.708 --> 04:51:50.718 align:start position:0%
on the issue of interlocking devices on
 
04:51:52.150 --> 04:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
any vehicle that's registered to the
 
04:51:55.110 --> 04:51:55.120 align:start position:0%
individual and we
 
04:52:00.628 --> 04:52:00.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:02.788 --> 04:52:02.798 align:start position:0%
so now we're hearing the same
 
04:52:05.430 --> 04:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
it's now on a different bill
 
04:52:05.440 --> 04:52:06.470 align:start position:0%
it's now on a different bill
the

04:52:06.470 --> 04:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:52:08.708 --> 04:52:08.718 align:start position:0%
the amendment would basically say all
 
04:52:10.230 --> 04:52:10.240 align:start position:0%
right it's registering your name but if
 
04:52:11.510 --> 04:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
you don't drive the vehicle on a regular
 
04:52:12.470 --> 04:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
basis you don't have to put the
 
04:52:14.310 --> 04:52:14.320 align:start position:0%
interlocking device in the vehicle
 
04:52:17.350 --> 04:52:17.360 align:start position:0%
the idea is
 
04:52:20.868 --> 04:52:20.878 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say that no it does not say
 
04:52:22.550 --> 04:52:22.560 align:start position:0%
what it says is
 
04:52:25.910 --> 04:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
if you uh under this law
 
04:52:27.270 --> 04:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
and you are required to have an
 
04:52:29.750 --> 04:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
interlock device in the vehicle that you
 
04:52:32.868 --> 04:52:32.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:34.788 --> 04:52:34.798 align:start position:0%
that's the whole purpose of the law in
 
04:52:36.230 --> 04:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
the first place
 
04:52:36.240 --> 04:52:37.590 align:start position:0%
the first place
yes

04:52:37.590 --> 04:52:37.600 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:52:39.670 --> 04:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
not that you're driving occasionally or
 
04:52:41.030 --> 04:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
anything like that
 
04:52:43.190 --> 04:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
because the car you're driving if you
 
04:52:45.190 --> 04:52:45.200 align:start position:0%
are stopped the car you are driving has
 
04:52:47.590 --> 04:52:47.600 align:start position:0%
an interlock device in it
 
04:52:49.350 --> 04:52:49.360 align:start position:0%
i understand and what the point that i'm
 
04:52:51.750 --> 04:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
going to make is that if a person were
 
04:52:53.910 --> 04:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
to violate said law
 
04:52:55.910 --> 04:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
and therefore drive a vehicle that does
 
04:52:58.070 --> 04:52:58.080 align:start position:0%
not have the interlock device in there
 
04:53:00.150 --> 04:53:00.160 align:start position:0%
the system in and of itself has already
 
04:53:00.160 --> 04:53:01.750 align:start position:0%
the system in and of itself has already
failed

04:53:01.750 --> 04:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
failed
 
04:53:03.110 --> 04:53:03.120 align:start position:0%
the idea is that they don't drive any
 
04:53:05.510 --> 04:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
vehicle period without this i understand
 
04:53:07.590 --> 04:53:07.600 align:start position:0%
the way it's written but it is not an
 
04:53:09.830 --> 04:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
unreasonable to presume that if a
 
04:53:11.910 --> 04:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
vehicle is registered in someone's name
 
04:53:14.150 --> 04:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
that they will operate that vehicle
 
04:53:15.830 --> 04:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
and the easiest way to avoid having the
 
04:53:18.390 --> 04:53:18.400 align:start position:0%
interlocking device in your vehicle
 
04:53:20.150 --> 04:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
is to not commit an aggravated offense
 
04:53:23.030 --> 04:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
where you either get in an accident
 
04:53:24.708 --> 04:53:24.718 align:start position:0%
while impaired or
 
04:53:27.270 --> 04:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
you're double the legal limit and then
 
04:53:28.868 --> 04:53:28.878 align:start position:0%
also convicted of
 
04:53:30.628 --> 04:53:30.638 align:start position:0%
or it's a subsequent offense so it's a
 
04:53:33.030 --> 04:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
second third offense or higher
 
04:53:37.190 --> 04:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
i think we create a relatively low
 
04:53:39.110 --> 04:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
standard to avoid having this
 
04:53:41.430 --> 04:53:41.440 align:start position:0%
interlocking device problem
 
04:53:42.708 --> 04:53:42.718 align:start position:0%
come up
 
04:53:42.718 --> 04:53:43.590 align:start position:0%
come up
so

04:53:43.590 --> 04:53:43.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:53:45.670 --> 04:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to support the amendment
 
04:53:47.670 --> 04:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
the what the underlying
 
04:53:49.590 --> 04:53:49.600 align:start position:0%
but the amendment still does do and what
 
04:53:51.190 --> 04:53:51.200 align:start position:0%
the bill would do is it has to do where
 
04:53:53.270 --> 04:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
it takes the consideration
 
04:53:55.830 --> 04:53:55.840 align:start position:0%
offenses and other jurisdictions
 
04:53:58.070 --> 04:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
someone could move here
 
04:54:00.470 --> 04:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
if they were to move here
 
04:54:02.788 --> 04:54:02.798 align:start position:0%
well they would again be getting around
 
04:54:04.310 --> 04:54:04.320 align:start position:0%
the requirement of the interlocking
 
04:54:04.320 --> 04:54:05.670 align:start position:0%
the requirement of the interlocking
device

04:54:05.670 --> 04:54:05.680 align:start position:0%
device
 
04:54:05.680 --> 04:54:06.470 align:start position:0%
device
the

04:54:06.470 --> 04:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:54:08.070 --> 04:54:08.080 align:start position:0%
this was supposed to prevent that from
 
04:54:09.270 --> 04:54:09.280 align:start position:0%
happening where someone can just say oh
 
04:54:10.470 --> 04:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
well yeah it's not working out for me
 
04:54:13.910 --> 04:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:13.920 --> 04:54:14.788 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:54:14.788 --> 04:54:14.798 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:54:18.550 --> 04:54:18.560 align:start position:0%
this is trying to avoid that now again
 
04:54:20.070 --> 04:54:20.080 align:start position:0%
if you have all these vehicles register
 
04:54:21.910 --> 04:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
your name
 
04:54:23.830 --> 04:54:23.840 align:start position:0%
i think it's fair to say that you it's a
 
04:54:25.030 --> 04:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
strong likelihood that you're going to
 
04:54:27.030 --> 04:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
drive that vehicle
 
04:54:27.040 --> 04:54:28.150 align:start position:0%
drive that vehicle
and

04:54:28.150 --> 04:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:54:29.430 --> 04:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to support this amendment
 
04:54:31.510 --> 04:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
i think this this what this does is
 
04:54:34.550 --> 04:54:34.560 align:start position:0%
defeats the purpose of the underlying
 
04:54:36.310 --> 04:54:36.320 align:start position:0%
law and we rejected the same
 
04:54:40.150 --> 04:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
suggested change in policy last week
 
04:54:41.670 --> 04:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
representative roy you're recognized
 
04:54:43.990 --> 04:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:54:46.390 --> 04:54:46.400 align:start position:0%
i'll start off by saying i agree with my
 
04:54:48.948 --> 04:54:48.958 align:start position:0%
good friend representative true that
 
04:54:50.150 --> 04:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
this is a
 
04:54:52.788 --> 04:54:52.798 align:start position:0%
a costly uh burden on an operator in
 
04:54:54.150 --> 04:54:54.160 align:start position:0%
this family
 
04:54:57.510 --> 04:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
and i would pose the hypothetical
 
04:54:59.030 --> 04:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
let's say we just did away with this
 
04:55:01.110 --> 04:55:01.120 align:start position:0%
section of law entirely regarding
 
04:55:02.628 --> 04:55:02.638 align:start position:0%
interlocked devices where would that
 
04:55:03.990 --> 04:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
leave us that would leave us with these
 
04:55:05.670 --> 04:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
people would not be able to drive at all
 
04:55:07.590 --> 04:55:07.600 align:start position:0%
their licenses would be revoked and they
 
04:55:09.590 --> 04:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
would not be able to drive at all
 
04:55:10.830 --> 04:55:10.840 align:start position:0%
so in
 
04:55:13.350 --> 04:55:13.360 align:start position:0%
consideration of them
 
04:55:13.360 --> 04:55:13.990 align:start position:0%
consideration of them
and

04:55:13.990 --> 04:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:55:15.590 --> 04:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
their family allowing them an
 
04:55:18.150 --> 04:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity one more time after they've
 
04:55:20.948 --> 04:55:20.958 align:start position:0%
been convicted twice to be able to drive
 
04:55:24.310 --> 04:55:24.320 align:start position:0%
and go out and earn a living
 
04:55:27.590 --> 04:55:27.600 align:start position:0%
we are allowing them to have access to
 
04:55:30.310 --> 04:55:30.320 align:start position:0%
vehicles with interlocking devices and
 
04:55:32.150 --> 04:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
the reason is because what this is is
 
04:55:33.990 --> 04:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
this is a physical or a mechanical
 
04:55:34.000 --> 04:55:35.190 align:start position:0%
this is a physical or a mechanical
barrier

04:55:35.190 --> 04:55:35.200 align:start position:0%
barrier
 
04:55:36.788 --> 04:55:36.798 align:start position:0%
we've already tried the law they've
 
04:55:38.868 --> 04:55:38.878 align:start position:0%
ignored that several times
 
04:55:40.948 --> 04:55:40.958 align:start position:0%
well now we need a physical barrier to
 
04:55:43.190 --> 04:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
stop them because they just can't seem
 
04:55:44.550 --> 04:55:44.560 align:start position:0%
to understand that you should not drink
 
04:55:46.150 --> 04:55:46.160 align:start position:0%
and drive
 
04:55:48.708 --> 04:55:48.718 align:start position:0%
so while this is costly there is no
 
04:55:51.910 --> 04:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
doubt um driving as i said previously on
 
04:55:54.070 --> 04:55:54.080 align:start position:0%
the other bill is a privilege it is not
 
04:55:55.190 --> 04:55:55.200 align:start position:0%
a right
 
04:55:57.190 --> 04:55:57.200 align:start position:0%
and where we did just strike this entire
 
04:55:59.590 --> 04:55:59.600 align:start position:0%
portion of laura they would be left with
 
04:56:01.270 --> 04:56:01.280 align:start position:0%
a suspended license and have no
 
04:56:02.948 --> 04:56:02.958 align:start position:0%
opportunity to drive and provide for
 
04:56:06.230 --> 04:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
their family so i i feel that
 
04:56:06.240 --> 04:56:07.030 align:start position:0%
their family so i i feel that
by

04:56:07.030 --> 04:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
by
 
04:56:08.708 --> 04:56:08.718 align:start position:0%
requiring them to have an interlock
 
04:56:11.030 --> 04:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
device in all of their vehicles
 
04:56:13.270 --> 04:56:13.280 align:start position:0%
the point is is it provides a physical
 
04:56:15.350 --> 04:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
barrier because they obviously cannot
 
04:56:18.070 --> 04:56:18.080 align:start position:0%
understand the law that says you can't
 
04:56:19.270 --> 04:56:19.280 align:start position:0%
drink and drive so now we're going to
 
04:56:21.510 --> 04:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
say okay we'll give you one more try but
 
04:56:23.430 --> 04:56:23.440 align:start position:0%
now we're going to make it really
 
04:56:23.440 --> 04:56:24.390 align:start position:0%
now we're going to make it really
difficult

04:56:24.390 --> 04:56:24.400 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
04:56:25.510 --> 04:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
for you to drink and drive you're going
 
04:56:26.788 --> 04:56:26.798 align:start position:0%
to have to take a breathalyzer every
 
04:56:29.190 --> 04:56:29.200 align:start position:0%
time behind you get behind the wheel
 
04:56:30.550 --> 04:56:30.560 align:start position:0%
no one's forced them to do that they
 
04:56:31.830 --> 04:56:31.840 align:start position:0%
could turn that down they could say you
 
04:56:33.510 --> 04:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
know what i don't want that i don't want
 
04:56:35.030 --> 04:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
these interlock devices i don't want
 
04:56:36.470 --> 04:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
them at all well
 
04:56:39.510 --> 04:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
that's your right too you don't drive
 
04:56:41.990 --> 04:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
so i feel like again
 
04:56:43.990 --> 04:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
while i understand this is a costly
 
04:56:45.830 --> 04:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
burden but it's not one that's forced on
 
04:56:49.030 --> 04:56:49.040 align:start position:0%
anyone it's one they choose to accept
 
04:56:50.230 --> 04:56:50.240 align:start position:0%
they can say i don't want to drive
 
04:56:52.390 --> 04:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
anymore and i want to pay that
 
04:56:53.590 --> 04:56:53.600 align:start position:0%
that's fine
 
04:56:55.830 --> 04:56:55.840 align:start position:0%
but in order to earn that privilege
 
04:56:57.430 --> 04:56:57.440 align:start position:0%
after having been convicted multiple
 
04:56:59.670 --> 04:56:59.680 align:start position:0%
times for drinking and driving
 
04:57:01.910 --> 04:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
um i feel like this is
 
04:57:03.590 --> 04:57:03.600 align:start position:0%
i think the the state bending over
 
04:57:05.670 --> 04:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
backwards to let them have a chance to
 
04:57:13.030 --> 04:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:14.628 --> 04:57:14.638 align:start position:0%
representative wallace
 
04:57:16.470 --> 04:57:16.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thanks for taking
 
04:57:18.390 --> 04:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
my question representative um in your
 
04:57:20.230 --> 04:57:20.240 align:start position:0%
situation or if this would have become
 
04:57:20.240 --> 04:57:21.190 align:start position:0%
situation or if this would have become
law

04:57:21.190 --> 04:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
law
 
04:57:23.190 --> 04:57:23.200 align:start position:0%
what is going to stop that individual
 
04:57:24.230 --> 04:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
who's been
 
04:57:27.030 --> 04:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
convicted of aggravated oui or
 
04:57:29.110 --> 04:57:29.120 align:start position:0%
subsequent offenses who has this
 
04:57:31.270 --> 04:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
interlock device in their motor vehicle
 
04:57:33.030 --> 04:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
but only in
 
04:57:34.788 --> 04:57:34.798 align:start position:0%
the father's motor vehicle in your
 
04:57:37.910 --> 04:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
hypothetical what is to prevent him from
 
04:57:39.750 --> 04:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
using his son's car
 
04:57:41.830 --> 04:57:41.840 align:start position:0%
while the son is at school uh because
 
04:57:43.190 --> 04:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
he's going to run down to the store to
 
04:57:44.708 --> 04:57:44.718 align:start position:0%
get something after he's been working in
 
04:57:46.470 --> 04:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
the yard drinking beer mowing his lawn
 
04:57:47.430 --> 04:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
what's going to prevent him from
 
04:57:50.628 --> 04:57:50.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:52.150 --> 04:57:52.160 align:start position:0%
the only thing that would prevent him
 
04:57:54.390 --> 04:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
from operating that vehicle is if he was
 
04:57:56.550 --> 04:57:56.560 align:start position:0%
stopped while driving
 
04:57:58.390 --> 04:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
then this law would
 
04:58:01.350 --> 04:58:01.360 align:start position:0%
take full force against him via not
 
04:58:03.110 --> 04:58:03.120 align:start position:0%
being in compliance
 
04:58:05.510 --> 04:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
if he had all four of his cars
 
04:58:07.270 --> 04:58:07.280 align:start position:0%
registered in his name with the
 
04:58:09.430 --> 04:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
interlock device what's going to stop
 
04:58:11.990 --> 04:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
him from borrowing his neighbor's car
 
04:58:13.350 --> 04:58:13.360 align:start position:0%
should we have the neighbors should he
 
04:58:15.830 --> 04:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
pay for his neighbor to have interlock
 
04:58:17.670 --> 04:58:17.680 align:start position:0%
you can't if a guy is going to break a
 
04:58:19.430 --> 04:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
law he's going to break a law
 
04:58:21.430 --> 04:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
the law says
 
04:58:23.190 --> 04:58:23.200 align:start position:0%
in with the amendment or even without
 
04:58:25.670 --> 04:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
the amendment um
 
04:58:27.430 --> 04:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
here's your chance the car you're
 
04:58:29.270 --> 04:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
driving must have an interlock device in
 
04:58:29.280 --> 04:58:30.788 align:start position:0%
driving must have an interlock device in
it

04:58:30.788 --> 04:58:30.798 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:58:32.390 --> 04:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
do you know if you drive without an
 
04:58:33.670 --> 04:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
interlock device then you're in
 
04:58:33.680 --> 04:58:36.150 align:start position:0%
interlock device then you're in
violation

04:58:36.150 --> 04:58:36.160 align:start position:0%
violation
 
04:58:38.070 --> 04:58:38.080 align:start position:0%
so what would stop him from borrowing
 
04:58:39.590 --> 04:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
his friend's car
 
04:58:41.270 --> 04:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
would be the police stop
 
04:58:42.390 --> 04:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
that's what would stop him from
 
04:58:44.310 --> 04:58:44.320 align:start position:0%
borrowing the friend's car because then
 
04:58:47.510 --> 04:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
he has to answer to the court for that
 
04:58:47.520 --> 04:58:48.390 align:start position:0%
he has to answer to the court for that
well

04:58:48.390 --> 04:58:48.400 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:58:50.390 --> 04:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
just to understand the neighbor the
 
04:58:50.400 --> 04:58:52.708 align:start position:0%
just to understand the neighbor the
friend

04:58:52.708 --> 04:58:52.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:54.788 --> 04:58:54.798 align:start position:0%
they're not you can't the court can't
 
04:58:57.110 --> 04:58:57.120 align:start position:0%
order an interlock device to go in the
 
04:58:58.550 --> 04:58:58.560 align:start position:0%
neighbor's vehicle
 
04:58:59.670 --> 04:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
they have nothing to do with the
 
04:59:01.110 --> 04:59:01.120 align:start position:0%
underlying realize that there's nothing
 
04:59:03.190 --> 04:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
to stop him from borrowing somebody's
 
04:59:03.200 --> 04:59:04.150 align:start position:0%
to stop him from borrowing somebody's
car

04:59:04.150 --> 04:59:04.160 align:start position:0%
car
 
04:59:07.510 --> 04:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
exactly but the idea of this this entire
 
04:59:09.910 --> 04:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
policy is to try to prevent the person
 
04:59:11.510 --> 04:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
from operating a motor vehicle as much
 
04:59:13.030 --> 04:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
as we can
 
04:59:14.788 --> 04:59:14.798 align:start position:0%
by requiring them to to have an
 
04:59:16.390 --> 04:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
interlocking device any vehicles that
 
04:59:18.788 --> 04:59:18.798 align:start position:0%
they either are driving or there's a
 
04:59:21.030 --> 04:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
strong likelihood that they will operate
 
04:59:23.270 --> 04:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
which again a car registered in their
 
04:59:26.230 --> 04:59:26.240 align:start position:0%
name that is a fair presumption to make
 
04:59:27.430 --> 04:59:27.440 align:start position:0%
there's no reason to think that that
 
04:59:29.030 --> 04:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
would not happen
 
04:59:29.040 --> 04:59:30.550 align:start position:0%
would not happen
so

04:59:30.550 --> 04:59:30.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:59:32.070 --> 04:59:32.080 align:start position:0%
again i'm just going to remind you when
 
04:59:34.150 --> 04:59:34.160 align:start position:0%
we completely rejected this policy last
 
04:59:34.160 --> 04:59:35.190 align:start position:0%
we completely rejected this policy last
week

04:59:35.190 --> 04:59:35.200 align:start position:0%
week
 
04:59:37.990 --> 04:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
if someone's
 
04:59:39.670 --> 04:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
was discussed for about 45 minutes i
 
04:59:42.628 --> 04:59:42.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:44.230 --> 04:59:44.240 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
04:59:46.150 --> 04:59:46.160 align:start position:0%
collectively did
 
04:59:47.750 --> 04:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
the majority of the committee thank you
 
04:59:47.760 --> 04:59:53.910 align:start position:0%
the majority of the committee thank you
representative

04:59:53.910 --> 04:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:57.110 --> 04:59:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:59.510 --> 04:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
04:59:59.520 --> 05:00:02.230 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
um

05:00:02.230 --> 05:00:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:03.910 --> 05:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to
 
05:00:06.230 --> 05:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill
 
05:00:07.910 --> 05:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
in fact i'm going to
 
05:00:10.470 --> 05:00:10.480 align:start position:0%
ask the question you know
 
05:00:11.670 --> 05:00:11.680 align:start position:0%
part of
 
05:00:13.510 --> 05:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
part of the issue and probably the
 
05:00:15.910 --> 05:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
biggest part of the issue is
 
05:00:15.920 --> 05:00:16.948 align:start position:0%
biggest part of the issue is
that

05:00:16.948 --> 05:00:16.958 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:00:18.830 --> 05:00:18.840 align:start position:0%
this country as well as the
 
05:00:23.270 --> 05:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
state has a real difficulty with alcohol
 
05:00:25.350 --> 05:00:25.360 align:start position:0%
and alcoholism
 
05:00:25.360 --> 05:00:27.990 align:start position:0%
and alcoholism
and

05:00:27.990 --> 05:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:31.590 --> 05:00:31.600 align:start position:0%
while the interlock devices
 
05:00:31.600 --> 05:00:32.390 align:start position:0%
while the interlock devices
can

05:00:32.390 --> 05:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
can
 
05:00:36.390 --> 05:00:36.400 align:start position:0%
do work some of the of the issue
 
05:00:38.470 --> 05:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
we actually need to
 
05:00:40.310 --> 05:00:40.320 align:start position:0%
figure out
 
05:00:41.670 --> 05:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
some way
 
05:00:44.470 --> 05:00:44.480 align:start position:0%
to address the alcohol issue
 
05:00:44.480 --> 05:00:46.070 align:start position:0%
to address the alcohol issue
and

05:00:46.070 --> 05:00:46.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:00:47.750 --> 05:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
these workarounds
 
05:00:50.948 --> 05:00:50.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:55.350 --> 05:00:55.360 align:start position:0%
they don't really address the real cause
 
05:00:59.830 --> 05:00:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:59.840 --> 05:01:01.350 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:01:01.350 --> 05:01:01.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:01:03.190 --> 05:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
05:01:03.200 --> 05:01:03.990 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
um

05:01:03.990 --> 05:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:05.670 --> 05:01:05.680 align:start position:0%
is there anything that would prevent
 
05:01:07.990 --> 05:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
someone who owned for who had four
 
05:01:10.550 --> 05:01:10.560 align:start position:0%
registered cars from transferring three
 
05:01:12.470 --> 05:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
of those registrations to somebody else
 
05:01:15.190 --> 05:01:15.200 align:start position:0%
and thereby avoiding having to have
 
05:01:17.670 --> 05:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
interlocked devices in every car that he
 
05:01:21.750 --> 05:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:23.270 --> 05:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
it's america people are generally free
 
05:01:25.430 --> 05:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
to transfer their property
 
05:01:27.510 --> 05:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
freely and willingly
 
05:01:30.868 --> 05:01:30.878 align:start position:0%
and as they see fit so no i'm not aware
 
05:01:32.868 --> 05:01:32.878 align:start position:0%
of any law that would restrict that
 
05:01:34.550 --> 05:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
person from
 
05:01:36.948 --> 05:01:36.958 align:start position:0%
transferring the vehicles
 
05:01:38.070 --> 05:01:38.080 align:start position:0%
or taking their name off the
 
05:01:38.080 --> 05:01:47.430 align:start position:0%
or taking their name off the
registration

05:01:47.430 --> 05:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:49.270 --> 05:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
any members wish to speak that have not
 
05:01:50.948 --> 05:01:50.958 align:start position:0%
spoke already
 
05:01:53.350 --> 05:01:53.360 align:start position:0%
the question is to adopt the amendment
 
05:01:55.750 --> 05:01:55.760 align:start position:0%
and i'll just repeat i would support not
 
05:01:57.430 --> 05:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
to pass but i'm not i would not support
 
05:01:58.470 --> 05:01:58.480 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
05:01:59.350 --> 05:01:59.360 align:start position:0%
this is
 
05:02:01.590 --> 05:02:01.600 align:start position:0%
where i stand representative ray newman
 
05:02:03.830 --> 05:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
you wish to speak
 
05:02:04.868 --> 05:02:04.878 align:start position:0%
yeah i
 
05:02:06.948 --> 05:02:06.958 align:start position:0%
having had experience with some
 
05:02:08.708 --> 05:02:08.718 align:start position:0%
relatives that had to use interlock
 
05:02:10.708 --> 05:02:10.718 align:start position:0%
devices and understanding the the
 
05:02:13.110 --> 05:02:13.120 align:start position:0%
problem with having the other members of
 
05:02:15.670 --> 05:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
the family might be using the the all
 
05:02:17.670 --> 05:02:17.680 align:start position:0%
the vehicles that are registered to the
 
05:02:17.680 --> 05:02:18.788 align:start position:0%
the vehicles that are registered to the
person

05:02:18.788 --> 05:02:18.798 align:start position:0%
person
 
05:02:21.430 --> 05:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
and we all talked and we had testimony
 
05:02:22.708 --> 05:02:22.718 align:start position:0%
that was about
 
05:02:24.868 --> 05:02:24.878 align:start position:0%
how difficult it is for another person
 
05:02:26.628 --> 05:02:26.638 align:start position:0%
to be able to drive a car like that and
 
05:02:27.990 --> 05:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
go through the thing with the flashing
 
05:02:29.190 --> 05:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
lights and having to pull over and do
 
05:02:31.030 --> 05:02:31.040 align:start position:0%
all that kind of stuff
 
05:02:33.510 --> 05:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
so i'm just thinking that this license
 
05:02:35.590 --> 05:02:35.600 align:start position:0%
and requirement is just an
 
05:02:35.600 --> 05:02:37.510 align:start position:0%
and requirement is just an
initial

05:02:37.510 --> 05:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
initial
 
05:02:39.350 --> 05:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
just an initial expense to those
 
05:02:41.270 --> 05:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
families some families that would have
 
05:02:43.270 --> 05:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
the benefit of maybe a
 
05:02:44.868 --> 05:02:44.878 align:start position:0%
wage earner
 
05:02:47.590 --> 05:02:47.600 align:start position:0%
not having to drive a car
 
05:02:49.430 --> 05:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
with an interlock device on it because
 
05:02:50.948 --> 05:02:50.958 align:start position:0%
someone in the family is required to
 
05:02:54.390 --> 05:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
have one and why you have to
 
05:02:56.390 --> 05:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
if you i don't think you solved your
 
05:02:57.830 --> 05:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
problem that you're apparently
 
05:02:59.910 --> 05:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
attempting to do
 
05:03:01.990 --> 05:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
by having them having to register all
 
05:03:03.990 --> 05:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
their vehicles no matter how many there
 
05:03:04.000 --> 05:03:05.030 align:start position:0%
their vehicles no matter how many there
are

05:03:05.030 --> 05:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:03:07.590 --> 05:03:07.600 align:start position:0%
i mean we should have if somebody has a
 
05:03:10.150 --> 05:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
court order to to not drive a car
 
05:03:12.390 --> 05:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
without an interlock device
 
05:03:13.830 --> 05:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
then they should be held fully
 
05:03:15.270 --> 05:03:15.280 align:start position:0%
accountable when they drive a car
 
05:03:17.350 --> 05:03:17.360 align:start position:0%
without an interlock device
 
05:03:19.350 --> 05:03:19.360 align:start position:0%
and but putting that extra burden on
 
05:03:21.110 --> 05:03:21.120 align:start position:0%
families again we're kind of doing
 
05:03:22.550 --> 05:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
around the corner
 
05:03:25.670 --> 05:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
try to fix it and and i don't think that
 
05:03:28.230 --> 05:03:28.240 align:start position:0%
it reaches whatever we're trying to get
 
05:03:29.830 --> 05:03:29.840 align:start position:0%
here thank you
 
05:03:32.390 --> 05:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
if if i may respond to what is there any
 
05:03:35.510 --> 05:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
concern about the burden
 
05:03:37.190 --> 05:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
towards other families when this is an
 
05:03:38.868 --> 05:03:38.878 align:start position:0%
aggravated situation where someone is
 
05:03:40.230 --> 05:03:40.240 align:start position:0%
involved in an accident because they're
 
05:03:40.240 --> 05:03:41.350 align:start position:0%
involved in an accident because they're
impaired

05:03:41.350 --> 05:03:41.360 align:start position:0%
impaired
 
05:03:43.030 --> 05:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
or we're now dealing with someone who's
 
05:03:45.430 --> 05:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
been convicted for the second or third
 
05:03:47.190 --> 05:03:47.200 align:start position:0%
or fourth time
 
05:03:49.510 --> 05:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
so we're dealing with a repeat offender
 
05:03:51.190 --> 05:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
and we're trying to prevent that conduct
 
05:03:53.270 --> 05:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
from continuing to happen that every
 
05:03:55.590 --> 05:03:55.600 align:start position:0%
time it happens puts it poses a threat
 
05:03:57.430 --> 05:03:57.440 align:start position:0%
to public safety we're trying to
 
05:03:59.510 --> 05:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
mitigate it as much as we can i mean
 
05:04:01.190 --> 05:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
we're not going to stop at 100 percent
 
05:04:02.470 --> 05:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
we can't do that
 
05:04:04.948 --> 05:04:04.958 align:start position:0%
may i respond so all i'm suggesting is
 
05:04:04.958 --> 05:04:07.190 align:start position:0%
may i respond so all i'm suggesting is
by

05:04:07.190 --> 05:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
by
 
05:04:09.350 --> 05:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
we're worried about the financial burden
 
05:04:11.190 --> 05:04:11.200 align:start position:0%
on the person who continues to violate
 
05:04:13.430 --> 05:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
the law repeatedly and endanger public
 
05:04:13.440 --> 05:04:14.390 align:start position:0%
the law repeatedly and endanger public
safety

05:04:14.390 --> 05:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
safety
 
05:04:15.670 --> 05:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
and i can certainly appreciate it
 
05:04:16.788 --> 05:04:16.798 align:start position:0%
because it can
 
05:04:18.868 --> 05:04:18.878 align:start position:0%
it still can become exciting it can
 
05:04:21.110 --> 05:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
become excessive i agree but in this
 
05:04:21.120 --> 05:04:22.550 align:start position:0%
become excessive i agree but in this
circumstance

05:04:22.550 --> 05:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
circumstance
 
05:04:24.550 --> 05:04:24.560 align:start position:0%
we're talking about aggravated offenses
 
05:04:28.310 --> 05:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
and repeat offenses that put everyone
 
05:04:30.868 --> 05:04:30.878 align:start position:0%
and every member of the public at risk
 
05:04:32.708 --> 05:04:32.718 align:start position:0%
without exception so
 
05:04:34.708 --> 05:04:34.718 align:start position:0%
it's just a matter of being fortunate
 
05:04:36.310 --> 05:04:36.320 align:start position:0%
that no one's harmed and that's that's a
 
05:04:38.230 --> 05:04:38.240 align:start position:0%
best case scenario that no one got
 
05:04:41.030 --> 05:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
injured so i i'm concerned why
 
05:04:42.868 --> 05:04:42.878 align:start position:0%
uh everyone's sympathizing for the
 
05:04:44.470 --> 05:04:44.480 align:start position:0%
person who has to use the interlocking
 
05:04:46.390 --> 05:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
device but we're forgetting how that
 
05:04:48.550 --> 05:04:48.560 align:start position:0%
what that person did in order to be at
 
05:04:50.948 --> 05:04:50.958 align:start position:0%
the point where they are now required to
 
05:04:52.628 --> 05:04:52.638 align:start position:0%
have an interlocking device in their
 
05:04:55.110 --> 05:04:55.120 align:start position:0%
vehicle in the first place
 
05:04:56.708 --> 05:04:56.718 align:start position:0%
may i respond you may respond
 
05:04:59.830 --> 05:04:59.840 align:start position:0%

read them before but don't remember now
 
05:05:12.470 --> 05:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
does this only applies to aggravated
 
05:05:14.470 --> 05:05:14.480 align:start position:0%
offense situations
 
05:05:16.708 --> 05:05:16.718 align:start position:0%
in what second or third i couldn't find
 
05:05:19.910 --> 05:05:19.920 align:start position:0%

05:08:31.190 --> 05:08:31.200 align:start position:0%
i don't have the bill in front of me
 
05:08:32.470 --> 05:08:32.480 align:start position:0%
and i got
 
05:08:48.470 --> 05:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:50.070 --> 05:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
and just correct correct me if i'm wrong
 
05:08:51.750 --> 05:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
what this really would do is it really
 
05:08:53.110 --> 05:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
just allows you to take into
 
05:08:55.030 --> 05:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
consideration out of state conviction so
 
05:08:57.190 --> 05:08:57.200 align:start position:0%
if someone were to move here or i
 
05:08:59.030 --> 05:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
suppose if you live here and we're
 
05:09:01.750 --> 05:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
driving another state
 
05:09:02.948 --> 05:09:02.958 align:start position:0%
it would be able to take that in
 
05:09:05.110 --> 05:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
consideration when it comes to
 
05:09:06.550 --> 05:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
the interlocking device so if you were
 
05:09:08.868 --> 05:09:08.878 align:start position:0%
to commit uh
 
05:09:10.948 --> 05:09:10.958 align:start position:0%

device in your vehicle
 
05:09:18.310 --> 05:09:18.320 align:start position:0%

05:09:20.948 --> 05:09:20.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:24.868 --> 05:09:24.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:26.788 --> 05:09:26.798 align:start position:0%

us with this amendment represents a real
 
05:12:47.760 --> 05:12:49.270 align:start position:0%
us with this amendment represents a real
compromise

05:12:49.270 --> 05:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
compromise
 
05:12:51.110 --> 05:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
uh from the original bill that takes
 
05:12:53.270 --> 05:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
into account concerns raised by this
 
05:12:53.280 --> 05:12:54.868 align:start position:0%
into account concerns raised by this
committee

05:12:54.868 --> 05:12:54.878 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:12:57.350 --> 05:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
around the initial proposal so
 
05:12:57.360 --> 05:12:58.390 align:start position:0%
around the initial proposal so
uh

05:12:58.390 --> 05:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:12:59.670 --> 05:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
what this bill would or what the
 
05:13:01.110 --> 05:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
amendment would do
 
05:13:03.750 --> 05:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
is reduce the amount of time somebody
 
05:13:05.430 --> 05:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
could be held
 
05:13:08.230 --> 05:13:08.240 align:start position:0%
uh pending coming before a judge
 
05:13:09.750 --> 05:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
and it would create it would change the
 
05:13:09.760 --> 05:13:10.868 align:start position:0%
and it would create it would change the
standard

05:13:10.868 --> 05:13:10.878 align:start position:0%
standard
 
05:13:12.628 --> 05:13:12.638 align:start position:0%
by which somebody would need to come
 
05:13:16.708 --> 05:13:16.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:18.390 --> 05:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
under the current so essentially it
 
05:13:21.350 --> 05:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
retains the intent and tenants of the
 
05:13:24.470 --> 05:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
bail reform proposal that passed uh
 
05:13:28.070 --> 05:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
three or four years ago for all first uh
 
05:13:30.390 --> 05:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
for all first arrests
 
05:13:33.030 --> 05:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
for somebody arrested a second time
 
05:13:35.110 --> 05:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
for a charge that exceeds a class b
 
05:13:38.708 --> 05:13:38.718 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor that person would be subject
 
05:13:40.470 --> 05:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
to seeing a judge before their bail
 
05:13:42.070 --> 05:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
could be determined and the judge would
 
05:13:43.990 --> 05:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
make that decision
 
05:13:46.230 --> 05:13:46.240 align:start position:0%
for somebody who is charged with only
 
05:13:48.230 --> 05:13:48.240 align:start position:0%
class b misdemeanor something that does
 
05:13:48.240 --> 05:13:49.190 align:start position:0%
class b misdemeanor something that does
not

05:13:49.190 --> 05:13:49.200 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:13:51.030 --> 05:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
require jail time
 
05:13:53.910 --> 05:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
it would require a third arrest so an
 
05:13:56.550 --> 05:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
initial arrest and two more arrests
 
05:13:58.708 --> 05:13:58.718 align:start position:0%
before that person would be held for no
 
05:14:00.868 --> 05:14:00.878 align:start position:0%
more than 36 hours before coming before
 
05:14:02.230 --> 05:14:02.240 align:start position:0%
a judge
 
05:14:04.550 --> 05:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
and again this is a compromise
 
05:14:07.030 --> 05:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
this is not sb 92 that this committee
 
05:14:09.830 --> 05:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
saw last year and this is not
 
05:14:13.110 --> 05:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
sb 294 which we will see later this year
 
05:14:14.948 --> 05:14:14.958 align:start position:0%
both of those far exceeded the
 
05:14:17.110 --> 05:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
provisions in this
 
05:14:18.708 --> 05:14:18.718 align:start position:0%
and i won't say any more because the the
 
05:14:20.390 --> 05:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
person who drafted this happens to be in
 
05:14:23.110 --> 05:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
the room but i support this and and will
 
05:14:28.310 --> 05:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:28.320 --> 05:14:29.430 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:14:29.430 --> 05:14:29.440 align:start position:0%

substitutes speaking is not always
 
05:14:40.070 --> 05:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
seen with uh
 
05:14:42.708 --> 05:14:42.718 align:start position:0%
it's not it's always smiled upon but um
 
05:14:43.990 --> 05:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
you know i've been here all day i
 
05:14:46.390 --> 05:14:46.400 align:start position:0%
haven't opined on anything else you guys
 
05:14:46.400 --> 05:14:47.110 align:start position:0%
haven't opined on anything else you guys
know

05:14:47.110 --> 05:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:14:47.120 --> 05:14:48.470 align:start position:0%
know
what

05:14:48.470 --> 05:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
what
 
05:14:50.628 --> 05:14:50.638 align:start position:0%
bail reform means to
 
05:14:53.030 --> 05:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
the communities that i represent um
 
05:14:56.150 --> 05:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
there are this is a bipartisan bill
 
05:14:56.160 --> 05:14:57.350 align:start position:0%
there are this is a bipartisan bill
um

05:14:57.350 --> 05:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:58.948 --> 05:14:58.958 align:start position:0%
if there are for those who do not know
 
05:15:01.510 --> 05:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
the history i am not um the largest fan
 
05:15:03.670 --> 05:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
of manchester's mayor
 
05:15:06.470 --> 05:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
but she agrees with this bill and her
 
05:15:08.150 --> 05:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
and i don't often agree
 
05:15:10.628 --> 05:15:10.638 align:start position:0%
so uh if that alone should give you an
 
05:15:12.310 --> 05:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
idea that there's um
 
05:15:12.320 --> 05:15:13.910 align:start position:0%
idea that there's um
there's

05:15:13.910 --> 05:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
there's
 
05:15:16.230 --> 05:15:16.240 align:start position:0%
near universal appeal for this we're not
 
05:15:17.830 --> 05:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
05:15:20.150 --> 05:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about changing
 
05:15:21.510 --> 05:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
the original
 
05:15:23.510 --> 05:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
pr bail statute when you're arrested the
 
05:15:25.990 --> 05:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
first time this bill doesn't touch you
 
05:15:27.910 --> 05:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
we are talking about people who are
 
05:15:31.430 --> 05:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
already out on bail and are arrested
 
05:15:34.708 --> 05:15:34.718 align:start position:0%
again for serious crimes with this
 
05:15:34.718 --> 05:15:35.750 align:start position:0%
again for serious crimes with this
amendment

05:15:35.750 --> 05:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:15:38.150 --> 05:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
we're now we're now dealing with serious
 
05:15:39.910 --> 05:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
crimes the
 
05:15:42.390 --> 05:15:42.400 align:start position:0%
class b misdemeanors was brought in to
 
05:15:44.788 --> 05:15:44.798 align:start position:0%
address concerns because we have been
 
05:15:47.350 --> 05:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
working with all parties in this from
 
05:15:49.910 --> 05:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
the beginning the concern was raised hey
 
05:15:51.190 --> 05:15:51.200 align:start position:0%
are you going to hold somebody over the
 
05:15:54.070 --> 05:15:54.080 align:start position:0%
weekend for a j for a crime that doesn't
 
05:15:56.708 --> 05:15:56.718 align:start position:0%
hold jail time we said well let's fix
 
05:15:58.470 --> 05:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
that so that's what this amendment does
 
05:16:00.628 --> 05:16:00.638 align:start position:0%
it also addresses another concern of a
 
05:16:03.110 --> 05:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
72-hour hold so we are cutting it in
 
05:16:05.190 --> 05:16:05.200 align:start position:0%
half to 36 hours
 
05:16:07.750 --> 05:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
we have compromised again and again and
 
05:16:07.760 --> 05:16:08.868 align:start position:0%
we have compromised again and again and
again

05:16:08.868 --> 05:16:08.878 align:start position:0%
again
 
05:16:11.990 --> 05:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
and i'm asking you to put your
 
05:16:15.110 --> 05:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
preconceived notions about this behind
 
05:16:16.550 --> 05:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
behind you
 
05:16:18.550 --> 05:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
and look at what we are talking about on
 
05:16:20.868 --> 05:16:20.878 align:start position:0%
the underlying bill we're talking about
 
05:16:23.750 --> 05:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
people who are already out on bail they
 
05:16:26.470 --> 05:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
have already been arrested once and now
 
05:16:28.708 --> 05:16:28.718 align:start position:0%
they've been arrested for a class a
 
05:16:32.150 --> 05:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor or hire while out on bail
 
05:16:33.990 --> 05:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
and all we're saying
 
05:16:37.270 --> 05:16:37.280 align:start position:0%
is this person should go before a judge
 
05:16:38.550 --> 05:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
don't put them in front of a bail
 
05:16:41.030 --> 05:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner they need to go in front of
 
05:16:43.830 --> 05:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
a judge if you've been arrested to or in
 
05:16:45.910 --> 05:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
this case now three times
 
05:16:49.030 --> 05:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
something is going on in your life
 
05:16:51.750 --> 05:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
that requires someone other than a bail
 
05:16:54.390 --> 05:16:54.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner to adjudicate you
 
05:16:56.390 --> 05:16:56.400 align:start position:0%
maybe you are mentally ill
 
05:16:58.708 --> 05:16:58.718 align:start position:0%
maybe you are experiencing homelessness
 
05:17:01.270 --> 05:17:01.280 align:start position:0%
maybe there is something else going on
 
05:17:04.070 --> 05:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
in your world that has caused you
 
05:17:07.110 --> 05:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
to be arrested repeatedly these are the
 
05:17:09.430 --> 05:17:09.440 align:start position:0%
people we are talking about they need
 
05:17:09.440 --> 05:17:10.390 align:start position:0%
people we are talking about they need
help

05:17:10.390 --> 05:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
help
 
05:17:12.788 --> 05:17:12.798 align:start position:0%
not all of them are bad people
 
05:17:15.590 --> 05:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
they need help i view this as a bill
 
05:17:17.190 --> 05:17:17.200 align:start position:0%
that helps them
 
05:17:18.948 --> 05:17:18.958 align:start position:0%
get them in front of someone then that
 
05:17:20.470 --> 05:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
can that can help them a bail
 
05:17:22.788 --> 05:17:22.798 align:start position:0%
commissioner cannot help them a judge
 
05:17:24.948 --> 05:17:24.958 align:start position:0%
can help them so i urge this committee
 
05:17:26.708 --> 05:17:26.718 align:start position:0%
ought to pass submitted we have
 
05:17:28.550 --> 05:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
compromised again and again and in fact
 
05:17:30.310 --> 05:17:30.320 align:start position:0%
when this amendment was brought forward
 
05:17:32.150 --> 05:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
one of the complaints was are you
 
05:17:34.708 --> 05:17:34.718 align:start position:0%
watering it down too much and i said we
 
05:17:37.510 --> 05:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
need to pass something we need to
 
05:17:39.270 --> 05:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
address it so i urge the committee
 
05:17:48.948 --> 05:17:48.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:48.958 --> 05:17:50.390 align:start position:0%
 
any

05:17:50.390 --> 05:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
any
 
05:17:50.400 --> 05:17:52.150 align:start position:0%
any
silence

05:17:52.150 --> 05:17:52.160 align:start position:0%
silence
 
05:17:58.070 --> 05:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:00.550 --> 05:18:00.560 align:start position:0%
representative sue newman yes
 
05:18:04.390 --> 05:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:07.110 --> 05:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
may i ask that representative a question
 
05:18:08.788 --> 05:18:08.798 align:start position:0%
yes and representative you may respond
 
05:18:10.550 --> 05:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
to the question if you are able to
 
05:18:12.150 --> 05:18:12.160 align:start position:0%
answer it thank you
 
05:18:15.830 --> 05:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
for for my benefit could you please
 
05:18:15.840 --> 05:18:17.590 align:start position:0%
for for my benefit could you please
explain

05:18:17.590 --> 05:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
explain
 
05:18:20.150 --> 05:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
your opinion on the difference between a
 
05:18:22.310 --> 05:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
person seeing a judge
 
05:18:26.070 --> 05:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
versus a bail commissioner
 
05:18:30.230 --> 05:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
so so yes um the the issue
 
05:18:33.190 --> 05:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
the issue of a bail
 
05:18:35.030 --> 05:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
and i spoke this in my in my testimony
 
05:18:37.430 --> 05:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
when i when i introduced the bill
 
05:18:39.830 --> 05:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
there the entire issue
 
05:18:43.030 --> 05:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
of pr bail and how we're handling repeat
 
05:18:45.110 --> 05:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
offenders is not being managed well in
 
05:18:47.510 --> 05:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
my opinion
 
05:18:49.190 --> 05:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
people who are arrested again and again
 
05:18:50.708 --> 05:18:50.718 align:start position:0%
and again there's something going on
 
05:18:51.830 --> 05:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
with them
 
05:18:53.990 --> 05:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
and i
 
05:18:56.150 --> 05:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
in the very first year i introduced a
 
05:18:57.910 --> 05:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
bill to try to address the bail
 
05:18:59.270 --> 05:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
commissioners because when i spoke with
 
05:19:00.868 --> 05:19:00.878 align:start position:0%
stakeholders including members of law
 
05:19:02.628 --> 05:19:02.638 align:start position:0%
enforcement virtually everyone pointed
 
05:19:05.270 --> 05:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
to the bail commissioners
 
05:19:06.788 --> 05:19:06.798 align:start position:0%
that that happened
 
05:19:09.750 --> 05:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
so i introduced a bill to adjust
 
05:19:12.550 --> 05:19:12.560 align:start position:0%
excuse me how the bail commissioners
 
05:19:14.470 --> 05:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
were basically who they reported to how
 
05:19:16.310 --> 05:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
often they would be
 
05:19:18.150 --> 05:19:18.160 align:start position:0%
renewed and those sort of things
 
05:19:20.310 --> 05:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
and the legislator had zero interest in
 
05:19:22.470 --> 05:19:22.480 align:start position:0%
it and they basically the bail
 
05:19:24.550 --> 05:19:24.560 align:start position:0%
commissioners blame the judges
 
05:19:26.948 --> 05:19:26.958 align:start position:0%
when something in bail doesn't go right
 
05:19:28.150 --> 05:19:28.160 align:start position:0%
because they say well we report to the
 
05:19:29.670 --> 05:19:29.680 align:start position:0%
judges we're following the judge's
 
05:19:29.680 --> 05:19:30.628 align:start position:0%
judges we're following the judge's
orders

05:19:30.628 --> 05:19:30.638 align:start position:0%
orders
 
05:19:32.628 --> 05:19:32.638 align:start position:0%
so by putting these people in front of
 
05:19:35.910 --> 05:19:35.920 align:start position:0%
the judge we're putting them in front of
 
05:19:37.270 --> 05:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
the person that is supposed to be
 
05:19:39.270 --> 05:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
overseeing the bail commissioner and my
 
05:19:41.510 --> 05:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
hope is that the judges will
 
05:19:43.590 --> 05:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
do a better job which i believe they
 
05:19:45.590 --> 05:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
will i i'm not trying to say bail
 
05:19:46.868 --> 05:19:46.878 align:start position:0%
commissioners aren't good people they're
 
05:19:48.708 --> 05:19:48.718 align:start position:0%
not smart but i think a judge will do a
 
05:19:49.830 --> 05:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
better job
 
05:19:51.670 --> 05:19:51.680 align:start position:0%
um in getting them the appropriate bail
 
05:19:54.470 --> 05:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
or help or you know preliminary you know
 
05:19:56.550 --> 05:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
adjudication that they need because
 
05:19:58.628 --> 05:19:58.638 align:start position:0%
clearly the system is failing them and
 
05:19:59.830 --> 05:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
that doesn't necessarily mean that the
 
05:20:01.670 --> 05:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner in that in exact
 
05:20:03.670 --> 05:20:03.680 align:start position:0%
instance failed him but we need to kind
 
05:20:05.350 --> 05:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
of kick that person up the chain a
 
05:20:06.310 --> 05:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
05:20:08.150 --> 05:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
because clearly the system is failing
 
05:20:09.670 --> 05:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
them if you've been arrested three times
 
05:20:11.430 --> 05:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
while you're already out on bail the
 
05:20:19.910 --> 05:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:22.230 --> 05:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
representative marston
 
05:20:24.628 --> 05:20:24.638 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
05:20:26.390 --> 05:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
as i understand it
 
05:20:28.708 --> 05:20:28.718 align:start position:0%
just simply stated a bail commissioner
 
05:20:31.350 --> 05:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
cannot ask or put somebody
 
05:20:33.110 --> 05:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
into a situation where they would have
 
05:20:35.030 --> 05:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
to be evaluated
 
05:20:36.628 --> 05:20:36.638 align:start position:0%
where a judge can
 
05:20:38.470 --> 05:20:38.480 align:start position:0%
and that's the difference
 
05:20:40.070 --> 05:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
that's why we want
 
05:20:42.548 --> 05:20:42.558 align:start position:0%
the judge to get involved maybe
 
05:20:45.190 --> 05:20:45.200 align:start position:0%
that second or third time depending on
 
05:20:47.110 --> 05:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
the violation
 
05:20:49.670 --> 05:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
because a judge has a lot more latitude
 
05:20:52.470 --> 05:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
he can inquire as to what the background
 
05:20:54.708 --> 05:20:54.718 align:start position:0%
of this person is and so on
 
05:20:56.868 --> 05:20:56.878 align:start position:0%
and he can maybe put this person in a
 
05:20:59.510 --> 05:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
mental institution and that was a
 
05:21:01.750 --> 05:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
problem in manchester a while back where
 
05:21:03.830 --> 05:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
somebody should have been in that
 
05:21:06.548 --> 05:21:06.558 align:start position:0%
category and didn't and really hurt a
 
05:21:09.110 --> 05:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
young lady so the judges have more
 
05:21:11.750 --> 05:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
leniency more
 
05:21:14.788 --> 05:21:14.798 align:start position:0%
more way with all
 
05:21:18.470 --> 05:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:23.750 --> 05:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:26.070 --> 05:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
while i'm extremely sympathetic with
 
05:21:27.830 --> 05:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
what manchester and some of the other
 
05:21:30.230 --> 05:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
larger cities in the state are are going
 
05:21:30.240 --> 05:21:31.110 align:start position:0%
larger cities in the state are are going
through

05:21:31.110 --> 05:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
through
 
05:21:32.390 --> 05:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we need to keep
 
05:21:33.990 --> 05:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
in mind is that the additional hearings
 
05:21:36.070 --> 05:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
will have a very real impact
 
05:21:36.080 --> 05:21:37.030 align:start position:0%
will have a very real impact
again

05:21:37.030 --> 05:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
again
 
05:21:39.110 --> 05:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
on a circuit court that's already
 
05:21:39.120 --> 05:21:41.110 align:start position:0%
on a circuit court that's already
overburdened

05:21:41.110 --> 05:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
overburdened
 
05:21:43.190 --> 05:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
there is no fiscal note it's an
 
05:21:46.628 --> 05:21:46.638 align:start position:0%
indeterminate fiscal note with this bill
 
05:21:48.548 --> 05:21:48.558 align:start position:0%
no one during testimony was actually
 
05:21:50.868 --> 05:21:50.878 align:start position:0%
able to quantify
 
05:21:52.628 --> 05:21:52.638 align:start position:0%
how many cases we're talking about we
 
05:21:53.670 --> 05:21:53.680 align:start position:0%
did hear
 
05:21:55.990 --> 05:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of troubling anecdotes but we
 
05:21:57.190 --> 05:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
didn't hear
 
05:21:58.868 --> 05:21:58.878 align:start position:0%
much in the way of quantification of
 
05:22:00.310 --> 05:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
these cases
 
05:22:00.320 --> 05:22:01.270 align:start position:0%
these cases
which

05:22:01.270 --> 05:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
which
 
05:22:03.110 --> 05:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
basically sort of puts us in a position
 
05:22:05.190 --> 05:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
if we pass this of kind of passing a
 
05:22:06.310 --> 05:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
wild card
 
05:22:07.590 --> 05:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
we really have
 
05:22:10.070 --> 05:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
no idea how much this is going to cost
 
05:22:11.830 --> 05:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
we have no idea what the impact is going
 
05:22:12.868 --> 05:22:12.878 align:start position:0%
to be
 
05:22:14.868 --> 05:22:14.878 align:start position:0%
again on a judicial system that's
 
05:22:18.070 --> 05:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
already overburdened and
 
05:22:20.708 --> 05:22:20.718 align:start position:0%
i i know we've heard and seen
 
05:22:23.910 --> 05:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
lots of stories in the news about where
 
05:22:25.270 --> 05:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
this particular
 
05:22:27.750 --> 05:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
you know where there are our breakdowns
 
05:22:29.190 --> 05:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
in the system
 
05:22:30.470 --> 05:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we haven't heard
 
05:22:32.708 --> 05:22:32.718 align:start position:0%
a ton about yet are breakdowns in our
 
05:22:35.110 --> 05:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
judicial system but if if we keep
 
05:22:37.510 --> 05:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
passing things like this without funding
 
05:22:37.520 --> 05:22:38.470 align:start position:0%
passing things like this without funding
them

05:22:38.470 --> 05:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
them
 
05:22:40.150 --> 05:22:40.160 align:start position:0%
and without even thinking about things
 
05:22:42.470 --> 05:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
things like that
 
05:22:45.350 --> 05:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
you know we're putting enormous pressure
 
05:22:47.590 --> 05:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
on a system that's already extremely
 
05:22:47.600 --> 05:22:48.948 align:start position:0%
on a system that's already extremely
overburdened

05:22:48.948 --> 05:22:48.958 align:start position:0%
overburdened
 
05:22:51.430 --> 05:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
and when it comes to the existing bill
 
05:22:53.350 --> 05:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
reform law
 
05:22:55.030 --> 05:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
one of the things that the existing law
 
05:22:57.670 --> 05:22:57.680 align:start position:0%
does is it does give it does provide a
 
05:22:57.680 --> 05:22:58.788 align:start position:0%
does is it does give it does provide a
mechanism

05:22:58.788 --> 05:22:58.798 align:start position:0%
mechanism
 
05:23:02.390 --> 05:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
to keep dangerous people off the street
 
05:23:04.948 --> 05:23:04.958 align:start position:0%
so i so again i i think it's one of
 
05:23:06.868 --> 05:23:06.878 align:start position:0%
these things where all of us sort of
 
05:23:08.230 --> 05:23:08.240 align:start position:0%
need to
 
05:23:10.788 --> 05:23:10.798 align:start position:0%
kind of weigh and balance the
 
05:23:13.270 --> 05:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
the pluses and the minuses but this is
 
05:23:13.280 --> 05:23:14.470 align:start position:0%
the pluses and the minuses but this is
definitely

05:23:14.470 --> 05:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
definitely
 
05:23:14.480 --> 05:23:15.430 align:start position:0%
definitely
not

05:23:15.430 --> 05:23:15.440 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:23:17.910 --> 05:23:17.920 align:start position:0%
all sunshine and roses um
 
05:23:19.670 --> 05:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
there are some very real considerations
 
05:23:21.670 --> 05:23:21.680 align:start position:0%
that come along with this bill that we
 
05:23:23.350 --> 05:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
should be keeping in mind as we vote for
 
05:23:23.360 --> 05:23:24.150 align:start position:0%
should be keeping in mind as we vote for
it

05:23:24.150 --> 05:23:24.160 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:23:26.070 --> 05:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:23:27.110 --> 05:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
i just want to
 
05:23:30.310 --> 05:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
clarify that this is the existing law
 
05:23:32.150 --> 05:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
so any person charged with an offense
 
05:23:33.590 --> 05:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
who is
 
05:23:35.510 --> 05:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
or was at the time of the offense was
 
05:23:37.990 --> 05:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
committed on released
 
05:23:40.470 --> 05:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
pending trial
 
05:23:42.868 --> 05:23:42.878 align:start position:0%
for a felony or misdemeanor all right so
 
05:23:44.708 --> 05:23:44.718 align:start position:0%
it can even be a class b misdemeanor if
 
05:23:47.510 --> 05:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
they get arrested for any offense
 
05:23:49.510 --> 05:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
including a class b misdemeanor which is
 
05:23:51.510 --> 05:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
an offense you can't go to you
 
05:23:54.230 --> 05:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
the penalty is not to be incarcerated
 
05:23:55.990 --> 05:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
under the existing law
 
05:23:57.190 --> 05:23:57.200 align:start position:0%
that person
 
05:23:59.110 --> 05:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
according to
 
05:24:00.948 --> 05:24:00.958 align:start position:0%
the existing law can be held for up to
 
05:24:03.430 --> 05:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
72 hours excluding the weekends and
 
05:24:03.440 --> 05:24:04.788 align:start position:0%
72 hours excluding the weekends and
holidays

05:24:04.788 --> 05:24:04.798 align:start position:0%
holidays
 
05:24:07.270 --> 05:24:07.280 align:start position:0%
what this does is it actually reduces it
 
05:24:09.350 --> 05:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
to 36 hours
 
05:24:09.360 --> 05:24:10.310 align:start position:0%
to 36 hours
it

05:24:10.310 --> 05:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:24:12.230 --> 05:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
it's excluding the weekends and holidays
 
05:24:13.910 --> 05:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
but there's not much we can do to
 
05:24:18.310 --> 05:24:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:20.830 --> 05:24:20.840 align:start position:0%
it's also excluding class b
 
05:24:22.948 --> 05:24:22.958 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors which again is an offense
 
05:24:25.190 --> 05:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
you can't be
 
05:24:27.670 --> 05:24:27.680 align:start position:0%
can't go to jail for so the idea is why
 
05:24:28.948 --> 05:24:28.958 align:start position:0%
would a person
 
05:24:31.270 --> 05:24:31.280 align:start position:0%
now be held or have their bill
 
05:24:32.628 --> 05:24:32.638 align:start position:0%
you know be be held for an extended
 
05:24:33.830 --> 05:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
period of time for an offense they can't
 
05:24:37.030 --> 05:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
serve jail time for in exchange for that
 
05:24:39.190 --> 05:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
what this is doing is rather than just
 
05:24:40.788 --> 05:24:40.798 align:start position:0%
go in front of a bail commissioner that
 
05:24:42.548 --> 05:24:42.558 align:start position:0%
person will be held
 
05:24:45.510 --> 05:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
and brought before a judge
 
05:24:45.520 --> 05:24:46.230 align:start position:0%
and brought before a judge
so

05:24:46.230 --> 05:24:46.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:24:47.270 --> 05:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
this is
 
05:24:48.708 --> 05:24:48.718 align:start position:0%
there are some provisions of this that
 
05:24:48.718 --> 05:24:50.230 align:start position:0%
there are some provisions of this that
are

05:24:50.230 --> 05:24:50.240 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:24:51.510 --> 05:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
i think are
 
05:24:53.030 --> 05:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
i would say much more favorable to
 
05:24:54.948 --> 05:24:54.958 align:start position:0%
someone who's going through the criminal
 
05:24:56.708 --> 05:24:56.718 align:start position:0%
justice system
 
05:24:59.430 --> 05:24:59.440 align:start position:0%
it's it's not necessarily a rollback
 
05:25:01.510 --> 05:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
or repeal of the bail reform that was
 
05:25:05.270 --> 05:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
passed a few years ago but if someone's
 
05:25:06.948 --> 05:25:06.958 align:start position:0%
being arrested several times on bail
 
05:25:08.868 --> 05:25:08.878 align:start position:0%
it's trying to bring going before a bail
 
05:25:08.878 --> 05:25:09.990 align:start position:0%
it's trying to bring going before a bail
commissioner

05:25:09.990 --> 05:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
05:25:11.270 --> 05:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
it doesn't now they're going to be
 
05:25:12.788 --> 05:25:12.798 align:start position:0%
brought in front of a judge
 
05:25:14.788 --> 05:25:14.798 align:start position:0%
that's what this would do
 
05:25:17.270 --> 05:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
so i believe it's a fair compromise
 
05:25:18.788 --> 05:25:18.798 align:start position:0%
i don't this isn't i don't believe this
 
05:25:20.230 --> 05:25:20.240 align:start position:0%
is an egregious
 
05:25:21.910 --> 05:25:21.920 align:start position:0%
uh change in the law
 
05:25:24.788 --> 05:25:24.798 align:start position:0%
and it is the hope is to avoid some of
 
05:25:26.150 --> 05:25:26.160 align:start position:0%
the more egregious situations that have
 
05:25:26.160 --> 05:25:30.230 align:start position:0%
the more egregious situations that have
happened

05:25:30.230 --> 05:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:33.750 --> 05:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
okay and of the chair just to clarify
 
05:25:35.430 --> 05:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
what you just read
 
05:25:37.910 --> 05:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
does it say shall or may in the current
 
05:25:37.920 --> 05:25:39.350 align:start position:0%
does it say shall or may in the current
law

05:25:39.350 --> 05:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
law
 
05:25:42.548 --> 05:25:42.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:45.270 --> 05:25:45.280 align:start position:0%
it's uh the current law is is may and
 
05:25:47.030 --> 05:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
the reason why is that if the court that
 
05:25:48.628 --> 05:25:48.638 align:start position:0%
makes the determination they don't want
 
05:25:49.910 --> 05:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
to have
 
05:25:51.670 --> 05:25:51.680 align:start position:0%
the person brought before the court then
 
05:25:52.948 --> 05:25:52.958 align:start position:0%
they would still be able to go to a bail
 
05:25:54.310 --> 05:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
committee then they would be brought
 
05:25:56.070 --> 05:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
before a bail commissioner this is
 
05:25:57.270 --> 05:25:57.280 align:start position:0%
making the requirement that they're
 
05:25:58.628 --> 05:25:58.638 align:start position:0%
brought before the bill commissioner so
 
05:26:00.150 --> 05:26:00.160 align:start position:0%
it's necessary to change the word from
 
05:26:01.590 --> 05:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
may to shell
 
05:26:03.750 --> 05:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
but it by making that requirement more
 
05:26:05.510 --> 05:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
strict there are some
 
05:26:07.990 --> 05:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh other parts of this amendment that is
 
05:26:09.750 --> 05:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
actually much i would say more lenient
 
05:26:12.788 --> 05:26:12.798 align:start position:0%
to someone and particularly the 72-hour
 
05:26:14.628 --> 05:26:14.638 align:start position:0%
provision you in theory you can be a
 
05:26:16.788 --> 05:26:16.798 align:start position:0%
person be arrested friday night
 
05:26:19.910 --> 05:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
and held to the to thursday if if monday
 
05:26:21.350 --> 05:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
was a holiday
 
05:26:24.150 --> 05:26:24.160 align:start position:0%
i resp ask another question
 
05:26:26.150 --> 05:26:26.160 align:start position:0%
but this eliminates bail commissioners
 
05:26:26.160 --> 05:26:29.110 align:start position:0%
but this eliminates bail commissioners
that's

05:26:29.110 --> 05:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
that's
 
05:26:30.390 --> 05:26:30.400 align:start position:0%
no it does not eliminate bail
 
05:26:31.990 --> 05:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
commissioners altogether
 
05:26:33.990 --> 05:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
in this particular situation where the
 
05:26:35.830 --> 05:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
person has been arrested now multiple
 
05:26:38.230 --> 05:26:38.240 align:start position:0%
times while already out on bill
 
05:26:40.628 --> 05:26:40.638 align:start position:0%
in that scenario and is it the third
 
05:26:40.638 --> 05:26:44.230 align:start position:0%
in that scenario and is it the third
time

05:26:44.230 --> 05:26:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:46.390 --> 05:26:46.400 align:start position:0%
it's now it's it's now like the third
 
05:26:49.350 --> 05:26:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:51.350 --> 05:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
they've been
 
05:26:53.190 --> 05:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
arrested at that point they wouldn't
 
05:26:54.708 --> 05:26:54.718 align:start position:0%
they would go in front of a judge not a
 
05:26:56.708 --> 05:26:56.718 align:start position:0%
bill commissioner the right to go in
 
05:26:57.990 --> 05:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
front of the bail commission that that
 
05:26:59.590 --> 05:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
procedure is not going to be afforded to
 
05:27:01.670 --> 05:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
that individual can i ask another
 
05:27:03.430 --> 05:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
another question just to clarify what
 
05:27:05.270 --> 05:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
was said about what this actually says
 
05:27:06.868 --> 05:27:06.878 align:start position:0%
in the law
 
05:27:06.878 --> 05:27:08.470 align:start position:0%
in the law
and

05:27:08.470 --> 05:27:08.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:27:11.430 --> 05:27:11.440 align:start position:0%
i mean i i i just from what i see that's
 
05:27:13.990 --> 05:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
been changed i don't see that
 
05:27:16.390 --> 05:27:16.400 align:start position:0%
i mean it says um
 
05:27:18.310 --> 05:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
or a person charged with a class b
 
05:27:18.320 --> 05:27:20.548 align:start position:0%
or a person charged with a class b
misdemeanor

05:27:20.548 --> 05:27:20.558 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor
 
05:27:23.510 --> 05:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
so uh but so to me it would mean that or
 
05:27:25.350 --> 05:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
a person charged with a class b minor
 
05:27:29.270 --> 05:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
can then shall be determined am i am i
 
05:27:32.230 --> 05:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:35.350 --> 05:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
no it says that they they shall they
 
05:27:37.430 --> 05:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
it basically says
 
05:27:40.310 --> 05:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
um that they that they shall go and they
 
05:27:42.948 --> 05:27:42.958 align:start position:0%
shall be put in front of a judge so
 
05:27:44.390 --> 05:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
they'll be detained until they see a
 
05:27:44.400 --> 05:27:45.270 align:start position:0%
they'll be detained until they see a
judge

05:27:45.270 --> 05:27:45.280 align:start position:0%
judge
 
05:27:45.280 --> 05:27:46.150 align:start position:0%
judge
um

05:27:46.150 --> 05:27:46.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:27:47.590 --> 05:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
because that's that's been raised before
 
05:27:49.750 --> 05:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
about is this creating mandatory minimum
 
05:27:49.760 --> 05:27:50.788 align:start position:0%
about is this creating mandatory minimum
holds

05:27:50.788 --> 05:27:50.798 align:start position:0%
holds
 
05:27:53.430 --> 05:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
um and the reality is is
 
05:27:55.190 --> 05:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
if the judge is available right then and
 
05:27:55.200 --> 05:27:56.150 align:start position:0%
if the judge is available right then and
there

05:27:56.150 --> 05:27:56.160 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:27:56.160 --> 05:27:57.110 align:start position:0%
there
there's

05:27:57.110 --> 05:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
there's
 
05:27:59.510 --> 05:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
they may not even go inside of a cell
 
05:28:01.030 --> 05:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
it's literally how quickly can you get
 
05:28:02.548 --> 05:28:02.558 align:start position:0%
him in front of a judge
 
05:28:04.070 --> 05:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
it's just about getting them in front of
 
05:28:08.390 --> 05:28:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:08.400 --> 05:28:11.430 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:28:11.430 --> 05:28:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:13.430 --> 05:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
05:28:16.150 --> 05:28:16.160 align:start position:0%
letting me speak i know i'm just a sub
 
05:28:18.788 --> 05:28:18.798 align:start position:0%
but i just want to i'm from manchester
 
05:28:20.868 --> 05:28:20.878 align:start position:0%
um and aldermen as well as the state
 
05:28:20.878 --> 05:28:22.070 align:start position:0%
um and aldermen as well as the state
representative

05:28:22.070 --> 05:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:28:25.030 --> 05:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
and i completely support this bill
 
05:28:27.030 --> 05:28:27.040 align:start position:0%
i support it because in manchester we
 
05:28:30.708 --> 05:28:30.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:34.628 --> 05:28:34.638 align:start position:0%
week after week i i see and i hear
 
05:28:37.750 --> 05:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
about the repeat offenders i see them
 
05:28:39.670 --> 05:28:39.680 align:start position:0%
in our parks
 
05:28:41.590 --> 05:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
we have an issue we have a serious
 
05:28:41.600 --> 05:28:42.548 align:start position:0%
we have an issue we have a serious
problem

05:28:42.548 --> 05:28:42.558 align:start position:0%
problem
 
05:28:45.430 --> 05:28:45.440 align:start position:0%
and do i think this is the panacea no
 
05:28:48.230 --> 05:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
but you know what it's a beginning going
 
05:28:50.628 --> 05:28:50.638 align:start position:0%
in front of a judge begins to spark the
 
05:28:53.350 --> 05:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
fact that what we need is a series of
 
05:28:56.230 --> 05:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
services for these folks because they
 
05:28:58.628 --> 05:28:58.638 align:start position:0%
probably need mental health they need
 
05:29:00.230 --> 05:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
they need work
 
05:29:02.628 --> 05:29:02.638 align:start position:0%
they need different services
 
05:29:04.310 --> 05:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
but we don't have those in place right
 
05:29:06.868 --> 05:29:06.878 align:start position:0%
now so in light of that
 
05:29:10.548 --> 05:29:10.558 align:start position:0%
i plan to vote yes on this bill today
 
05:29:13.350 --> 05:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
because my city needs this bill thank
 
05:29:16.708 --> 05:29:16.718 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
05:29:18.470 --> 05:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
representative rory
 
05:29:20.868 --> 05:29:20.878 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i just want to um
 
05:29:22.788 --> 05:29:22.798 align:start position:0%
briefly address the concerns regarding
 
05:29:24.708 --> 05:29:24.718 align:start position:0%
the the fiscal notes and the
 
05:29:27.510 --> 05:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
and and while i'm very pleased to hear
 
05:29:29.350 --> 05:29:29.360 align:start position:0%
my friend from portsmouth's concern over
 
05:29:32.788 --> 05:29:32.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:35.510 --> 05:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
this is solely within the the ability of
 
05:29:37.990 --> 05:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
the court to manage the cost of this
 
05:29:39.670 --> 05:29:39.680 align:start position:0%
the court
 
05:29:41.590 --> 05:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
as we've heard controls the bail
 
05:29:41.600 --> 05:29:42.868 align:start position:0%
as we've heard controls the bail
commissioners

05:29:42.868 --> 05:29:42.878 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
05:29:44.150 --> 05:29:44.160 align:start position:0%
the court instructs the bill
 
05:29:45.510 --> 05:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
commissioners and how they should be
 
05:29:47.190 --> 05:29:47.200 align:start position:0%
issuing bail and not
 
05:29:47.200 --> 05:29:48.230 align:start position:0%
issuing bail and not
so

05:29:48.230 --> 05:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:29:49.910 --> 05:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
with regard to whether or not someone's
 
05:29:51.510 --> 05:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
released or not that's up to the courts
 
05:29:53.590 --> 05:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
to instruct the bail commissioners
 
05:29:57.910 --> 05:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
the courts are free to um conduct phone
 
05:29:59.990 --> 05:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
bail hearings um they we already know
 
05:30:01.990 --> 05:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
that we have judges on call 24 hours a
 
05:30:03.750 --> 05:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
day for domestic violence issues over
 
05:30:05.750 --> 05:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
the weekend the same judge could also
 
05:30:07.670 --> 05:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
hear uh bail issues
 
05:30:09.030 --> 05:30:09.040 align:start position:0%
um there's a there's a lot of room in
 
05:30:12.310 --> 05:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
there for them to to um to move do they
 
05:30:14.230 --> 05:30:14.240 align:start position:0%
need more judges perhaps and and we can
 
05:30:16.548 --> 05:30:16.558 align:start position:0%
hear that in the next
 
05:30:18.390 --> 05:30:18.400 align:start position:0%
next time it's time for a budget but but
 
05:30:20.548 --> 05:30:20.558 align:start position:0%
currently we as the good representative
 
05:30:23.030 --> 05:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
just said we have a serious public
 
05:30:25.510 --> 05:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
safety issue that has to be dealt with
 
05:30:27.110 --> 05:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
and i do not see
 
05:30:29.670 --> 05:30:29.680 align:start position:0%
a bail hearing for someone who's been
 
05:30:32.868 --> 05:30:32.878 align:start position:0%
out on their second or third bail
 
05:30:34.628 --> 05:30:34.638 align:start position:0%
being a lengthy hearing that's going to
 
05:30:36.708 --> 05:30:36.718 align:start position:0%
tie up the court perhaps 10 minutes at
 
05:30:36.718 --> 05:30:37.750 align:start position:0%
tie up the court perhaps 10 minutes at
most

05:30:37.750 --> 05:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
most
 
05:30:39.750 --> 05:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
and as i said it can be done over the
 
05:30:41.510 --> 05:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
phone if they allocate the resources
 
05:30:43.430 --> 05:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
that they already are using um over the
 
05:30:45.590 --> 05:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
weekends and holidays so it's potential
 
05:30:47.750 --> 05:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
if they so said it all we're asking is
 
05:30:48.628 --> 05:30:48.638 align:start position:0%
that they
 
05:30:49.990 --> 05:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
they handle it
 
05:30:52.708 --> 05:30:52.718 align:start position:0%
um where it already is so i don't see
 
05:30:54.948 --> 05:30:54.958 align:start position:0%
the additional expense
 
05:30:56.310 --> 05:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
regardless of
 
05:30:57.350 --> 05:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
what we've
 
05:30:59.270 --> 05:30:59.280 align:start position:0%
heard could possibly be or might
 
05:31:01.350 --> 05:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
possibly be we know that there's judges
 
05:31:06.708 --> 05:31:06.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:10.070 --> 05:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
representative conley thank you
 
05:31:11.910 --> 05:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
one of the things we hear with this bill
 
05:31:13.430 --> 05:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
is that this is a manchester bill
 
05:31:15.830 --> 05:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
solving a manchester problem and
 
05:31:17.990 --> 05:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
it's not a manchester only problem my
 
05:31:21.110 --> 05:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
city of dover is a small city in a small
 
05:31:24.310 --> 05:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
state and this problem is affecting us
 
05:31:25.910 --> 05:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
it's affecting our neighbors in summer's
 
05:31:27.510 --> 05:31:27.520 align:start position:0%
worth it's affecting our neighbors to
 
05:31:29.670 --> 05:31:29.680 align:start position:0%
the north in rochester every city in
 
05:31:31.750 --> 05:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
this state and every town of any size is
 
05:31:33.910 --> 05:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
dealing with uh situations that would be
 
05:31:35.590 --> 05:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
addressed by this bill
 
05:31:35.600 --> 05:31:36.470 align:start position:0%
addressed by this bill
so

05:31:36.470 --> 05:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:31:39.030 --> 05:31:39.040 align:start position:0%
it's a statewide issue and this fix is
 
05:31:39.040 --> 05:31:44.390 align:start position:0%
it's a statewide issue and this fix is
needed

05:31:44.390 --> 05:31:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:46.788 --> 05:31:46.798 align:start position:0%
representative harry catherine
 
05:31:50.150 --> 05:31:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:52.788 --> 05:31:52.798 align:start position:0%
well i um i sympathize with manchester
 
05:31:54.948 --> 05:31:54.958 align:start position:0%
as well and all the other towns that
 
05:31:56.230 --> 05:31:56.240 align:start position:0%
we're mentioning
 
05:31:56.240 --> 05:31:57.190 align:start position:0%
we're mentioning
um

05:31:57.190 --> 05:31:57.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:31:59.510 --> 05:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
i like to say that
 
05:32:01.110 --> 05:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
we receive data
 
05:32:03.590 --> 05:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
that talks about the crime rate
 
05:32:05.750 --> 05:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
in all the different cities particularly
 
05:32:07.590 --> 05:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
the largest cities and manchester is one
 
05:32:08.548 --> 05:32:08.558 align:start position:0%
of them
 
05:32:10.150 --> 05:32:10.160 align:start position:0%
and what i have
 
05:32:13.430 --> 05:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
is that the crime rate is down
 
05:32:15.430 --> 05:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
for three years
 
05:32:17.030 --> 05:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
each year
 
05:32:17.040 --> 05:32:18.548 align:start position:0%
each year
down

05:32:18.548 --> 05:32:18.558 align:start position:0%
down
 
05:32:20.868 --> 05:32:20.878 align:start position:0%
you can't hear me
 
05:32:20.878 --> 05:32:25.430 align:start position:0%
you can't hear me
sorry

05:32:25.430 --> 05:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:27.110 --> 05:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
what i'm saying is that the total crime
 
05:32:30.628 --> 05:32:30.638 align:start position:0%
rate is down 2018 2019-2020 i'm assuming
 
05:32:33.110 --> 05:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
that you guys are referring to 2021
 
05:32:35.110 --> 05:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
which i don't have the data on
 
05:32:37.510 --> 05:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
also i see that the arrest rate is down
 
05:32:40.310 --> 05:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
continuously going down in that city
 
05:32:42.230 --> 05:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
manchester by itself
 
05:32:44.470 --> 05:32:44.480 align:start position:0%
so what i'm saying is that we we have a
 
05:32:47.030 --> 05:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
social issue and i don't think that it's
 
05:32:48.948 --> 05:32:48.958 align:start position:0%
right to address a social issue by
 
05:32:51.510 --> 05:32:51.520 align:start position:0%
locking people up
 
05:32:53.270 --> 05:32:53.280 align:start position:0%
you don't know what that situation is
 
05:32:55.110 --> 05:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
and no you don't have to necessarily i
 
05:32:58.310 --> 05:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
know that we for example in nashua a
 
05:33:00.070 --> 05:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
police officer can call one of the
 
05:33:02.150 --> 05:33:02.160 align:start position:0%
social agencies to get
 
05:33:03.270 --> 05:33:03.280 align:start position:0%
a person
 
05:33:04.390 --> 05:33:04.400 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:33:06.070 --> 05:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
that person doesn't have to wait to go
 
05:33:08.708 --> 05:33:08.718 align:start position:0%
to a court for a judge to say you need
 
05:33:08.718 --> 05:33:10.628 align:start position:0%
to a court for a judge to say you need
help

05:33:10.628 --> 05:33:10.638 align:start position:0%
help
 
05:33:13.430 --> 05:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
they can automatically take a person to
 
05:33:14.868 --> 05:33:14.878 align:start position:0%
saint joe's or one of the other
 
05:33:16.788 --> 05:33:16.798 align:start position:0%
facilities so i'm not sure what
 
05:33:18.390 --> 05:33:18.400 align:start position:0%
manchester's doing with the social
 
05:33:20.548 --> 05:33:20.558 align:start position:0%
issues but i don't know maybe it's
 
05:33:23.190 --> 05:33:23.200 align:start position:0%
something a conversation between mayors
 
05:33:24.788 --> 05:33:24.798 align:start position:0%
that could help with that type of
 
05:33:27.430 --> 05:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
situation but to say lock them up
 
05:33:29.590 --> 05:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
i have a problem with that
 
05:33:31.830 --> 05:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
and most of the people that are that are
 
05:33:34.310 --> 05:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
doing or recommitting those crimes are
 
05:33:36.310 --> 05:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
people that are homeless
 
05:33:38.230 --> 05:33:38.240 align:start position:0%
so if you're homeless let me put you in
 
05:33:39.110 --> 05:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
jail and
 
05:33:41.510 --> 05:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
give you a home in jail
 
05:33:44.708 --> 05:33:44.718 align:start position:0%
i have a problem with that
 
05:33:46.470 --> 05:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
and this isn't new
 
05:33:48.310 --> 05:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
and manchester's known they've had a
 
05:33:50.390 --> 05:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
problem for a serious time like all the
 
05:33:51.910 --> 05:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
other titles that have problems and
 
05:33:53.350 --> 05:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
that's the way they're addressing it as
 
05:33:55.830 --> 05:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
social issues not as a means to lock
 
05:34:03.910 --> 05:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:07.190 --> 05:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
representative pearson thank you uh
 
05:34:08.868 --> 05:34:08.878 align:start position:0%
i can i'll give a little insight here
 
05:34:10.390 --> 05:34:10.400 align:start position:0%
i've been a
 
05:34:11.750 --> 05:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
firefighter in the city of manchester
 
05:34:13.910 --> 05:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
for 18 years and i assure you that the
 
05:34:16.310 --> 05:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
social aspect of what has occurred that
 
05:34:18.948 --> 05:34:18.958 align:start position:0%
is going on and that you reference is in
 
05:34:20.628 --> 05:34:20.638 align:start position:0%
fact being addressed
 
05:34:21.990 --> 05:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
in manchester
 
05:34:23.910 --> 05:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
but that only works to a point and it
 
05:34:25.350 --> 05:34:25.360 align:start position:0%
only goes so far
 
05:34:26.948 --> 05:34:26.958 align:start position:0%
and i think that we've the fire
 
05:34:29.030 --> 05:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
department especially in in conjunction
 
05:34:30.868 --> 05:34:30.878 align:start position:0%
with the manchester mental health has
 
05:34:32.868 --> 05:34:32.878 align:start position:0%
made substantial
 
05:34:35.190 --> 05:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
substantial efforts in this avenue
 
05:34:38.708 --> 05:34:38.718 align:start position:0%
but again that only goes so far
 
05:34:41.830 --> 05:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
and we have a clear problem
 
05:34:43.350 --> 05:34:43.360 align:start position:0%
that needs to be addressed it is not
 
05:34:45.830 --> 05:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
unique to manchester my constituents and
 
05:34:47.350 --> 05:34:47.360 align:start position:0%
dairy deal with it in a little bit of a
 
05:34:48.628 --> 05:34:48.638 align:start position:0%
different way
 
05:34:48.638 --> 05:34:49.590 align:start position:0%
different way
but

05:34:49.590 --> 05:34:49.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:34:53.030 --> 05:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
i i don't i don't want to see this
 
05:34:54.628 --> 05:34:54.638 align:start position:0%
turned into
 
05:34:56.948 --> 05:34:56.958 align:start position:0%
um you know us throwing darts at a map
 
05:34:59.510 --> 05:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
here into who's got problems where and
 
05:35:01.830 --> 05:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
this isn't this is an overreach this is
 
05:35:04.628 --> 05:35:04.638 align:start position:0%
a much wider issue than just what the
 
05:35:07.510 --> 05:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
queen city is dealing with so
 
05:35:09.110 --> 05:35:09.120 align:start position:0%
i i know we can get on a tangent here
 
05:35:10.548 --> 05:35:10.558 align:start position:0%
about specifics because manchester gets
 
05:35:12.390 --> 05:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
a lot of tv cameras and a lot of press
 
05:35:14.310 --> 05:35:14.320 align:start position:0%
and a lot of highlights but let's not
 
05:35:15.830 --> 05:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
forget that the rest of the communities
 
05:35:16.708 --> 05:35:16.718 align:start position:0%
that have to deal with this don't
 
05:35:18.310 --> 05:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
necessarily just get the press but it
 
05:35:20.230 --> 05:35:20.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean it's not they're not
 
05:35:26.948 --> 05:35:26.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:29.190 --> 05:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
have any members
 
05:35:30.628 --> 05:35:30.638 align:start position:0%
wish to speak they have not spoke
 
05:35:30.638 --> 05:35:34.310 align:start position:0%
wish to speak they have not spoke
already

05:35:34.310 --> 05:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:36.948 --> 05:35:36.958 align:start position:0%
representative board name
 
05:35:41.030 --> 05:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:42.708 --> 05:35:42.718 align:start position:0%
i'm really hesitant to talk about this
 
05:35:44.230 --> 05:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
but i i will
 
05:35:46.150 --> 05:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
speak one i can
 
05:35:48.788 --> 05:35:48.798 align:start position:0%
uh interesting enough
 
05:35:50.548 --> 05:35:50.558 align:start position:0%
in new york state
 
05:35:51.750 --> 05:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
they passed
 
05:35:55.430 --> 05:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
bell reform as well and now they're
 
05:35:57.270 --> 05:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
looking at repealing
 
05:35:59.670 --> 05:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
parts of bail reform
 
05:36:01.430 --> 05:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
but one thing about
 
05:36:03.430 --> 05:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
new york state is
 
05:36:06.390 --> 05:36:06.400 align:start position:0%
they actually have data
 
05:36:08.070 --> 05:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
and the data says
 
05:36:10.150 --> 05:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
that they have
 
05:36:12.150 --> 05:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
uh a two percent
 
05:36:12.160 --> 05:36:13.670 align:start position:0%
uh a two percent
uh

05:36:13.670 --> 05:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:36:16.628 --> 05:36:16.638 align:start position:0%
offense rate so if
 
05:36:19.590 --> 05:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
someone's released on bell
 
05:36:22.470 --> 05:36:22.480 align:start position:0%
two percent come back
 
05:36:26.150 --> 05:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
now i can assume that this is really
 
05:36:28.868 --> 05:36:28.878 align:start position:0%
basically the same statistics that we're
 
05:36:32.230 --> 05:36:32.240 align:start position:0%
going to be looking at in the state
 
05:36:34.948 --> 05:36:34.958 align:start position:0%
so that seems to be a minor problem
 
05:36:36.788 --> 05:36:36.798 align:start position:0%
however we do know
 
05:36:38.390 --> 05:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
that there are
 
05:36:40.708 --> 05:36:40.718 align:start position:0%
issues in our cities
 
05:36:40.718 --> 05:36:42.150 align:start position:0%
issues in our cities
about

05:36:42.150 --> 05:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:36:44.628 --> 05:36:44.638 align:start position:0%
people that have mental illnesses
 
05:36:47.590 --> 05:36:47.600 align:start position:0%
and people that are homeless
 
05:36:47.600 --> 05:36:48.948 align:start position:0%
and people that are homeless
and

05:36:48.948 --> 05:36:48.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:36:50.868 --> 05:36:50.878 align:start position:0%
it seems to me
 
05:36:54.788 --> 05:36:54.798 align:start position:0%
that and we have on a talk to the chief
 
05:36:57.430 --> 05:36:57.440 align:start position:0%
ellenberg from manchester he says he
 
05:36:59.830 --> 05:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
does prefer people to the
 
05:37:01.110 --> 05:37:01.120 align:start position:0%
closed door
 
05:37:05.030 --> 05:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
or open door or whatever whatever it is
 
05:37:06.868 --> 05:37:06.878 align:start position:0%
open doors
 
05:37:06.878 --> 05:37:07.910 align:start position:0%
open doors
project

05:37:07.910 --> 05:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
project
 
05:37:07.920 --> 05:37:09.030 align:start position:0%
project
which

05:37:09.030 --> 05:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
which
 
05:37:11.430 --> 05:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
helps some but it doesn't take care of
 
05:37:12.948 --> 05:37:12.958 align:start position:0%
all the problems
 
05:37:15.030 --> 05:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
and he identifies that some of the
 
05:37:16.788 --> 05:37:16.798 align:start position:0%
issues our people
 
05:37:20.310 --> 05:37:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:20.320 --> 05:37:21.510 align:start position:0%
 
and

05:37:21.510 --> 05:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:37:25.110 --> 05:37:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:26.948 --> 05:37:26.958 align:start position:0%
make it unpleasant enough that the
 
05:37:29.910 --> 05:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
manager askes and asks them to leave
 
05:37:32.548 --> 05:37:32.558 align:start position:0%
they don't leave the police come take
 
05:37:35.190 --> 05:37:35.200 align:start position:0%
them away arrest them and take them away
 
05:37:37.270 --> 05:37:37.280 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:37:39.750 --> 05:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
because he's not really
 
05:37:43.270 --> 05:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
committed a a serious offense
 
05:37:45.430 --> 05:37:45.440 align:start position:0%
they were are released again
 
05:37:47.510 --> 05:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
and before you know it
 
05:37:50.070 --> 05:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
he's back in that same business doing
 
05:37:52.628 --> 05:37:52.638 align:start position:0%
the same kind of thing maybe
 
05:37:54.628 --> 05:37:54.638 align:start position:0%
more aggravated
 
05:37:54.638 --> 05:37:55.670 align:start position:0%
more aggravated
and

05:37:55.670 --> 05:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:37:58.708 --> 05:37:58.718 align:start position:0%
he has to the call call the police again
 
05:37:58.718 --> 05:37:59.750 align:start position:0%
he has to the call call the police again
except

05:37:59.750 --> 05:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
except
 
05:37:59.760 --> 05:38:01.190 align:start position:0%
except
maybe

05:38:01.190 --> 05:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
05:38:04.070 --> 05:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
uh the second time hit the he is more
 
05:38:05.910 --> 05:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
offensive towards the manager when he
 
05:38:09.910 --> 05:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
asks he's asked to leave so
 
05:38:11.590 --> 05:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
this is a problem that's not going to be
 
05:38:13.830 --> 05:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
solved by putting people in prison
 
05:38:16.948 --> 05:38:16.958 align:start position:0%
because prison is not going to resolve
 
05:38:20.390 --> 05:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
the problem it probably is going to make
 
05:38:22.628 --> 05:38:22.638 align:start position:0%
the problem worse because
 
05:38:23.830 --> 05:38:23.840 align:start position:0%
this person
 
05:38:27.910 --> 05:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
may be uh have mental illness and being
 
05:38:32.150 --> 05:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
in jail is not going to be
 
05:38:34.310 --> 05:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
a good experience for them
 
05:38:34.320 --> 05:38:35.350 align:start position:0%
a good experience for them
so

05:38:35.350 --> 05:38:35.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:38:37.110 --> 05:38:37.120 align:start position:0%
i don't know the answer
 
05:38:39.670 --> 05:38:39.680 align:start position:0%
but we need to address this problem on a
 
05:38:43.830 --> 05:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
wider scale than putting them in jail
 
05:38:47.430 --> 05:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:49.190 --> 05:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
representative roy
 
05:38:50.708 --> 05:38:50.718 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
05:38:50.718 --> 05:38:51.510 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
um

05:38:51.510 --> 05:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:38:53.270 --> 05:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
one thing that we're you know i i heard
 
05:38:54.470 --> 05:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
the representative talk about how
 
05:38:56.150 --> 05:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
arrests are down
 
05:38:57.750 --> 05:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
one thing you have to think about also
 
05:39:00.628 --> 05:39:00.638 align:start position:0%
from a perspective of a police officer
 
05:39:02.948 --> 05:39:02.958 align:start position:0%
this is a very tiring job and it's a
 
05:39:04.548 --> 05:39:04.558 align:start position:0%
very hard job and it's a very dangerous
 
05:39:06.310 --> 05:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
job and when you
 
05:39:08.150 --> 05:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
arrest somebody and you end up getting
 
05:39:10.470 --> 05:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
into a scruffa with them and you gotta
 
05:39:11.990 --> 05:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
cuff them and wrestle with them and get
 
05:39:13.350 --> 05:39:13.360 align:start position:0%
them in the
 
05:39:14.788 --> 05:39:14.798 align:start position:0%
to see them walk out the door five
 
05:39:17.030 --> 05:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
minutes later while you're still typing
 
05:39:20.150 --> 05:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
your report um it's disheartening and
 
05:39:21.270 --> 05:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
and then
 
05:39:22.868 --> 05:39:22.878 align:start position:0%
to see them on the street again later
 
05:39:24.628 --> 05:39:24.638 align:start position:0%
doing the same things
 
05:39:26.628 --> 05:39:26.638 align:start position:0%
and you're not your arrest will go down
 
05:39:28.070 --> 05:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
because the police just get tired of
 
05:39:29.670 --> 05:39:29.680 align:start position:0%
arresting the same people for the same
 
05:39:31.590 --> 05:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
thing over and over to see the courts or
 
05:39:33.350 --> 05:39:33.360 align:start position:0%
or the bail commissioners just let them
 
05:39:34.868 --> 05:39:34.878 align:start position:0%
walk out the door
 
05:39:37.670 --> 05:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
at least if they have to go to the judge
 
05:39:40.070 --> 05:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
the judge can look at and we're not
 
05:39:42.390 --> 05:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
putting people in prison um this that's
 
05:39:43.910 --> 05:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
not what this bill does this bill just
 
05:39:45.430 --> 05:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
says that they have to go see a judge
 
05:39:46.948 --> 05:39:46.958 align:start position:0%
before they can get back out instead of
 
05:39:49.430 --> 05:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
just another revolving door through the
 
05:39:51.190 --> 05:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
through the police station for a
 
05:39:53.110 --> 05:39:53.120 align:start position:0%
personal requirements bill
 
05:39:54.548 --> 05:39:54.558 align:start position:0%
so um
 
05:39:56.310 --> 05:39:56.320 align:start position:0%
i think that there's a lot of aspects
 
05:39:58.708 --> 05:39:58.718 align:start position:0%
and and we should also look at the the
 
05:40:00.470 --> 05:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
burden this puts on our law enforcement
 
05:40:02.628 --> 05:40:02.638 align:start position:0%
community to continually see the same
 
05:40:04.708 --> 05:40:04.718 align:start position:0%
people walking in and out the door
 
05:40:06.070 --> 05:40:06.080 align:start position:0%
before they can even finish the report
 
05:40:07.590 --> 05:40:07.600 align:start position:0%
from the first arrest
 
05:40:09.190 --> 05:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:40:11.590 --> 05:40:11.600 align:start position:0%
and just to expand on that
 
05:40:13.670 --> 05:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
when a person is brought in front of the
 
05:40:13.680 --> 05:40:15.030 align:start position:0%
when a person is brought in front of the
judge

05:40:15.030 --> 05:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
judge
 
05:40:18.868 --> 05:40:18.878 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in this requiring the
 
05:40:21.270 --> 05:40:21.280 align:start position:0%
prosecutor to request that that person
 
05:40:22.708 --> 05:40:22.718 align:start position:0%
not be
 
05:40:24.070 --> 05:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
given bail
 
05:40:26.230 --> 05:40:26.240 align:start position:0%
it's not a it's not
 
05:40:27.750 --> 05:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
making a suggestion one way or another
 
05:40:27.760 --> 05:40:29.590 align:start position:0%
making a suggestion one way or another
so

05:40:29.590 --> 05:40:29.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:40:31.430 --> 05:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
that's the prosecutor may make the
 
05:40:32.948 --> 05:40:32.958 align:start position:0%
decision to not ask for bill it can it
 
05:40:34.788 --> 05:40:34.798 align:start position:0%
certainly happen
 
05:40:36.150 --> 05:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
that's not
 
05:40:38.470 --> 05:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
an impossibility so just
 
05:40:39.830 --> 05:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
keep that in mind
 
05:40:39.840 --> 05:40:41.030 align:start position:0%
keep that in mind
representative

05:40:41.030 --> 05:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:40:41.040 --> 05:40:42.390 align:start position:0%
representative
coordinate

05:40:42.390 --> 05:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
coordinate
 
05:40:43.350 --> 05:40:43.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:40:43.360 --> 05:40:44.390 align:start position:0%
thank you
well

05:40:44.390 --> 05:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:40:46.470 --> 05:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
after the person's before the person has
 
05:40:48.868 --> 05:40:48.878 align:start position:0%
been brought for the judge
 
05:40:51.270 --> 05:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
the likelihood is that
 
05:40:53.430 --> 05:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
that person's already been
 
05:40:56.070 --> 05:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
in jail before he uh gets to the
 
05:40:58.230 --> 05:40:58.240 align:start position:0%

05:43:10.868 --> 05:43:10.878 align:start position:0%
representative true you're recognized
 
05:43:14.470 --> 05:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:17.590 --> 05:43:17.600 align:start position:0%
i keep hearing that
 
05:43:19.910 --> 05:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
it's implied anyway that it's it's these
 
05:43:22.868 --> 05:43:22.878 align:start position:0%
don uh bail commissioners that uh
 
05:43:24.310 --> 05:43:24.320 align:start position:0%
that are causing all these problems
 
05:43:27.670 --> 05:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:29.670 --> 05:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
the bail commissioner answers to the
 
05:43:29.680 --> 05:43:30.708 align:start position:0%
the bail commissioner answers to the
judge

05:43:30.708 --> 05:43:30.718 align:start position:0%
judge
 
05:43:32.470 --> 05:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
the judge can say
 
05:43:36.230 --> 05:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
you are no longer a bail commissioner
 
05:43:39.110 --> 05:43:39.120 align:start position:0%
because of this this and this
 
05:43:41.030 --> 05:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
so i don't see
 
05:43:44.070 --> 05:43:44.080 align:start position:0%
why people feel that the judge who is
 
05:43:44.080 --> 05:43:45.670 align:start position:0%
why people feel that the judge who is
allowing

05:43:45.670 --> 05:43:45.680 align:start position:0%
allowing
 
05:43:48.150 --> 05:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
the bail commissioners to let people out
 
05:43:50.150 --> 05:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
is now going to be the one who can cure
 
05:43:51.750 --> 05:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
the problem
 
05:43:55.750 --> 05:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:59.270 --> 05:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:01.510 --> 05:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
we are talking about taking away the
 
05:44:03.270 --> 05:44:03.280 align:start position:0%
personal freedom
 
05:44:04.470 --> 05:44:04.480 align:start position:0%
of people
 
05:44:08.070 --> 05:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
who have not only not been found guilty
 
05:44:10.150 --> 05:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
of a crime
 
05:44:11.670 --> 05:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
they haven't even been charged with a
 
05:44:11.680 --> 05:44:12.390 align:start position:0%
they haven't even been charged with a
crime

05:44:12.390 --> 05:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
crime
 
05:44:19.030 --> 05:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:22.470 --> 05:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
i can't support the state saying
 
05:44:25.110 --> 05:44:25.120 align:start position:0%
we think you're so bad you should lose
 
05:44:27.990 --> 05:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:29.990 --> 05:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
for 36 hours
 
05:44:31.590 --> 05:44:31.600 align:start position:0%
well let's not forget saturday and
 
05:44:31.600 --> 05:44:32.548 align:start position:0%
well let's not forget saturday and
sunday

05:44:32.548 --> 05:44:32.558 align:start position:0%
sunday
 
05:44:35.110 --> 05:44:35.120 align:start position:0%
and don't forget uh the the holiday on
 
05:44:35.120 --> 05:44:37.510 align:start position:0%
and don't forget uh the the holiday on
monday

05:44:37.510 --> 05:44:37.520 align:start position:0%
monday
 
05:44:39.670 --> 05:44:39.680 align:start position:0%
36 hours becomes
 
05:44:42.310 --> 05:44:42.320 align:start position:0%
72 hours real quick
 
05:44:42.320 --> 05:44:44.310 align:start position:0%
72 hours real quick
so

05:44:44.310 --> 05:44:44.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:44:46.390 --> 05:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
on paper the 36 hours looks like it's a
 
05:44:46.400 --> 05:44:47.430 align:start position:0%
on paper the 36 hours looks like it's a
reduction

05:44:47.430 --> 05:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
reduction
 
05:44:49.590 --> 05:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
but it's a reduction but don't count
 
05:44:51.990 --> 05:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
saturdays sundays and holidays saturdays
 
05:44:54.628 --> 05:44:54.638 align:start position:0%
sundays and holidays that makes 72 hours
 
05:44:56.948 --> 05:44:56.958 align:start position:0%
right there
 
05:44:59.830 --> 05:44:59.840 align:start position:0%
my main objection is
 
05:45:03.350 --> 05:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:04.708 --> 05:45:04.718 align:start position:0%
take away
 
05:45:06.868 --> 05:45:06.878 align:start position:0%
somebody's freedom
 
05:45:10.868 --> 05:45:10.878 align:start position:0%
when they have not even been charged
 
05:45:13.670 --> 05:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
with a violation
 
05:45:15.750 --> 05:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
that's not going to require any jail
 
05:45:19.750 --> 05:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
time even if they are found guilty
 
05:45:22.470 --> 05:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
and that's why i can't support the otpa
 
05:45:29.670 --> 05:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:32.310 --> 05:45:32.320 align:start position:0%
representative true the existing law as
 
05:45:34.948 --> 05:45:34.958 align:start position:0%
written for any offense a person can be
 
05:45:37.270 --> 05:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
held for 72 hours excluding weekends and
 
05:45:39.830 --> 05:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
holidays so that can really be almost
 
05:45:39.840 --> 05:45:40.868 align:start position:0%
holidays so that can really be almost
double

05:45:40.868 --> 05:45:40.878 align:start position:0%
double
 
05:45:42.230 --> 05:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
72 hours
 
05:45:45.510 --> 05:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:47.430 --> 05:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
rolling some of that part reducing that
 
05:45:49.510 --> 05:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
time period
 
05:45:51.190 --> 05:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
in the
 
05:45:52.548 --> 05:45:52.558 align:start position:0%
other side of that is that being going
 
05:45:53.750 --> 05:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
to be brought in from
 
05:45:55.910 --> 05:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
a judge not a bail commissioner so
 
05:45:58.070 --> 05:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
the issue of 72 hours
 
05:46:00.628 --> 05:46:00.638 align:start position:0%
in the weekends that the existing law
 
05:46:03.190 --> 05:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
that is a problem under current law that
 
05:46:06.070 --> 05:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
is whether this bill passes or not
 
05:46:07.990 --> 05:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
that the weekend that's an issue we have
 
05:46:09.830 --> 05:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
in our system right now
 
05:46:12.548 --> 05:46:12.558 align:start position:0%
this this is going to reduce the time
 
05:46:14.390 --> 05:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
when the courts are open that a person
 
05:46:15.910 --> 05:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
can be held
 
05:46:18.470 --> 05:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
and right now it says any offense
 
05:46:20.390 --> 05:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
so right now it can be a class b
 
05:46:22.230 --> 05:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor as well an offense you
 
05:46:25.190 --> 05:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
cannot serve time for a person could
 
05:46:27.910 --> 05:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
be held for 72 hours then
 
05:46:29.110 --> 05:46:29.120 align:start position:0%
if it's a long weekend because of a
 
05:46:31.190 --> 05:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
holiday on top of that so
 
05:46:32.868 --> 05:46:32.878 align:start position:0%
the concerns you raised this this bill
 
05:46:34.548 --> 05:46:34.558 align:start position:0%
would improve
 
05:46:36.628 --> 05:46:36.638 align:start position:0%
at least that issue
 
05:46:39.510 --> 05:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
it would mitigate that
 
05:46:41.110 --> 05:46:41.120 align:start position:0%
so just something that i would point out
 
05:46:43.190 --> 05:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
now we're not saying that the bail
 
05:46:44.470 --> 05:46:44.480 align:start position:0%
commissioners we're not pointing the
 
05:46:46.708 --> 05:46:46.718 align:start position:0%
finger here we're just explaining that
 
05:46:47.750 --> 05:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
when a person's arrested and they're
 
05:46:48.868 --> 05:46:48.878 align:start position:0%
brought in front of a bail commissioner
 
05:46:50.868 --> 05:46:50.878 align:start position:0%
they're held for a very short period of
 
05:46:50.878 --> 05:46:52.230 align:start position:0%
they're held for a very short period of
time

05:46:52.230 --> 05:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:46:53.830 --> 05:46:53.840 align:start position:0%
and i think what we're trying to do here
 
05:46:56.230 --> 05:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
the goal is that if a person's a repeat
 
05:46:59.670 --> 05:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
offender they're brought before a judge
 
05:47:01.030 --> 05:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
as opposed to a bail commission that
 
05:47:02.628 --> 05:47:02.638 align:start position:0%
that is what we're trying to do the
 
05:47:04.548 --> 05:47:04.558 align:start position:0%
person will be held for a longer period
 
05:47:05.990 --> 05:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
of time
 
05:47:07.830 --> 05:47:07.840 align:start position:0%
if they're arrested and you know seven
 
05:47:09.270 --> 05:47:09.280 align:start position:0%
o'clock at night eight o'clock at night
 
05:47:10.948 --> 05:47:10.958 align:start position:0%
they can be held in the morning so
 
05:47:12.230 --> 05:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
that's that's what we're dealing that's
 
05:47:14.628 --> 05:47:14.638 align:start position:0%
what this is doing is to not let that
 
05:47:16.788 --> 05:47:16.798 align:start position:0%
person be released that night
 
05:47:18.628 --> 05:47:18.638 align:start position:0%
then waive their arraignment and they
 
05:47:20.390 --> 05:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
often don't even only show up at the
 
05:47:22.788 --> 05:47:22.798 align:start position:0%
next hearing things like that can happen
 
05:47:24.310 --> 05:47:24.320 align:start position:0%
so by putting the person in front of a
 
05:47:27.030 --> 05:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
judge they're you know in a courtroom
 
05:47:28.070 --> 05:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
and that's where the bail hearing would
 
05:47:32.948 --> 05:47:32.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:36.788 --> 05:47:36.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:36.798 --> 05:47:37.990 align:start position:0%
 
uh

05:47:37.990 --> 05:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:47:39.990 --> 05:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
so the difference real one of the
 
05:47:42.788 --> 05:47:42.798 align:start position:0%
differences between the existing law and
 
05:47:44.470 --> 05:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
the proposed law
 
05:47:44.480 --> 05:47:45.510 align:start position:0%
the proposed law
is

05:47:45.510 --> 05:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:47:45.520 --> 05:47:46.470 align:start position:0%
is
one

05:47:46.470 --> 05:47:46.480 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:47:46.480 --> 05:47:48.390 align:start position:0%
one
verb

05:47:48.390 --> 05:47:48.400 align:start position:0%
verb
 
05:47:51.190 --> 05:47:51.200 align:start position:0%
ones that present law says
 
05:47:52.708 --> 05:47:52.718 align:start position:0%
may be detained
 
05:47:52.718 --> 05:47:53.510 align:start position:0%
may be detained
while

05:47:53.510 --> 05:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
while
 
05:47:57.350 --> 05:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
the proposed bill says shall be detained
 
05:48:05.190 --> 05:48:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:07.190 --> 05:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
in in order to require the person to be
 
05:48:08.948 --> 05:48:08.958 align:start position:0%
brought before a judge as opposed to a
 
05:48:10.310 --> 05:48:10.320 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner you must change the
 
05:48:13.270 --> 05:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
word made to shall there's no
 
05:48:16.310 --> 05:48:16.320 align:start position:0%
that that's the reason for that
 
05:48:18.788 --> 05:48:18.798 align:start position:0%
change in the language
 
05:48:21.750 --> 05:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
if you leave it as may
 
05:48:23.910 --> 05:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that the bill has written
 
05:48:25.430 --> 05:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
would actually
 
05:48:28.470 --> 05:48:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:31.030 --> 05:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
representative ray newman
 
05:48:32.390 --> 05:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:48:33.990 --> 05:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
i agree with both the representative
 
05:48:35.750 --> 05:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
board here and representative true in
 
05:48:39.510 --> 05:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
may shall mean shall and may means may
 
05:48:41.750 --> 05:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
so it does change it it
 
05:48:41.760 --> 05:48:42.470 align:start position:0%
so it does change it it
it

05:48:42.470 --> 05:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:48:44.708 --> 05:48:44.718 align:start position:0%
shall is a requirement you shall do
 
05:48:47.270 --> 05:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
something in may says you may do
 
05:48:47.280 --> 05:48:48.868 align:start position:0%
something in may says you may do
something

05:48:48.868 --> 05:48:48.878 align:start position:0%
something
 
05:48:51.270 --> 05:48:51.280 align:start position:0%
so what what that is what the reason
 
05:48:53.510 --> 05:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
that shell has to be there is so that
 
05:48:55.590 --> 05:48:55.600 align:start position:0%
the person can't go before a bail
 
05:48:55.600 --> 05:48:56.868 align:start position:0%
the person can't go before a bail
commissioner

05:48:56.868 --> 05:48:56.878 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
05:48:59.670 --> 05:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
so therefore we're saying here again
 
05:49:01.590 --> 05:49:01.600 align:start position:0%
the bail commissioners are not doing
 
05:49:03.190 --> 05:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
what they're supposed to do well let's
 
05:49:05.270 --> 05:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
fix that
 
05:49:07.430 --> 05:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
and and we've also i think i've also
 
05:49:09.110 --> 05:49:09.120 align:start position:0%
heard testimony and i may have been
 
05:49:11.670 --> 05:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
incorrect in the way i interpret it
 
05:49:12.868 --> 05:49:12.878 align:start position:0%
is that
 
05:49:14.390 --> 05:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
there's a judge around
 
05:49:16.948 --> 05:49:16.958 align:start position:0%
24 hours on call but i i think i also
 
05:49:18.310 --> 05:49:18.320 align:start position:0%
heard that that was for domestic
 
05:49:18.320 --> 05:49:19.510 align:start position:0%
heard that that was for domestic
violence

05:49:19.510 --> 05:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
violence
 
05:49:21.510 --> 05:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
and i think we had some testimony from a
 
05:49:22.868 --> 05:49:22.878 align:start position:0%
police chief
 
05:49:24.708 --> 05:49:24.718 align:start position:0%
and i asked him well why don't we just
 
05:49:28.070 --> 05:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
have a judge on call 24 hours and my
 
05:49:30.070 --> 05:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
understanding from him was we don't have
 
05:49:32.830 --> 05:49:32.840 align:start position:0%
that for these kind of offend
 
05:49:36.150 --> 05:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
things so i i think that if you have
 
05:49:38.310 --> 05:49:38.320 align:start position:0%
equal justice under the law
 
05:49:40.390 --> 05:49:40.400 align:start position:0%
monday through friday you should have it
 
05:49:42.470 --> 05:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
on the weekends and that's why this bit
 
05:49:50.788 --> 05:49:50.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:50.798 --> 05:49:51.990 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:49:51.990 --> 05:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:49:54.070 --> 05:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
if you look at lines this is the
 
05:49:56.548 --> 05:49:56.558 align:start position:0%
amendment this is lines 12
 
05:49:58.868 --> 05:49:58.878 align:start position:0%
through 19 where
 
05:50:01.270 --> 05:50:01.280 align:start position:0%
this language struck out
 
05:50:03.270 --> 05:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
when it's a may
 
05:50:05.110 --> 05:50:05.120 align:start position:0%
what is what happens is the court is
 
05:50:09.350 --> 05:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
contacted now the court does not have to
 
05:50:10.788 --> 05:50:10.798 align:start position:0%
have the person appear before the court
 
05:50:12.310 --> 05:50:12.320 align:start position:0%
they can then and if that's the case and
 
05:50:13.670 --> 05:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
the court does not want to do a bail
 
05:50:15.190 --> 05:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
hearing in the court
 
05:50:17.990 --> 05:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
then it would was uh revert back to the
 
05:50:20.708 --> 05:50:20.718 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner system so the may to
 
05:50:22.948 --> 05:50:22.958 align:start position:0%
shall again is making it so it does not
 
05:50:25.190 --> 05:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
go to the bail commissioner and i don't
 
05:50:26.628 --> 05:50:26.638 align:start position:0%
think it's unreasonable that someone
 
05:50:29.350 --> 05:50:29.360 align:start position:0%
who's a repeat offender is held for
 
05:50:31.190 --> 05:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
a short period of time
 
05:50:33.110 --> 05:50:33.120 align:start position:0%
overnight to being brought into a court
 
05:50:34.868 --> 05:50:34.878 align:start position:0%
especially when it's dealing with third
 
05:50:37.030 --> 05:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
fourth offenses here
 
05:50:38.230 --> 05:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
but that's
 
05:50:40.230 --> 05:50:40.240 align:start position:0%
the reason why you change that word is
 
05:50:41.990 --> 05:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
if if you don't change that word the
 
05:50:43.350 --> 05:50:43.360 align:start position:0%
rest of the paragraph's not going to
 
05:50:45.430 --> 05:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
make any sense because
 
05:50:46.948 --> 05:50:46.958 align:start position:0%
there is no this is making it so there
 
05:50:48.548 --> 05:50:48.558 align:start position:0%
is no alternative so it has to be
 
05:50:48.558 --> 05:50:50.788 align:start position:0%
is no alternative so it has to be
shallow

05:50:50.788 --> 05:50:50.798 align:start position:0%
shallow
 
05:50:52.628 --> 05:50:52.638 align:start position:0%
may i respond
 
05:50:54.948 --> 05:50:54.958 align:start position:0%
representing you may respond you have to
 
05:50:54.958 --> 05:50:56.070 align:start position:0%
representing you may respond you have to
respond

05:50:56.070 --> 05:50:56.080 align:start position:0%
respond
 
05:50:59.510 --> 05:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
it is a shall so that you have to have
 
05:51:01.990 --> 05:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
them go to a court and not see a bail
 
05:51:03.670 --> 05:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner yes
 
05:51:06.470 --> 05:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
may would let them still have a bail
 
05:51:08.470 --> 05:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner on on afternoons and
 
05:51:10.390 --> 05:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
weekends that's all i'm saying
 
05:51:12.230 --> 05:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
and i think if you're going to have due
 
05:51:14.310 --> 05:51:14.320 align:start position:0%
process in the middle of the week you
 
05:51:16.070 --> 05:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
ought to have due process on the
 
05:51:18.310 --> 05:51:18.320 align:start position:0%
weekends and we have that now
 
05:51:20.070 --> 05:51:20.080 align:start position:0%
in what we have because we have a
 
05:51:22.230 --> 05:51:22.240 align:start position:0%
judicial officer who is overseen by a
 
05:51:22.240 --> 05:51:23.350 align:start position:0%
judicial officer who is overseen by a
judge

05:51:23.350 --> 05:51:23.360 align:start position:0%
judge
 
05:51:24.470 --> 05:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
and who
 
05:51:27.670 --> 05:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
can correct the if one is is letting
 
05:51:29.670 --> 05:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
people out when they shouldn't be
 
05:51:31.270 --> 05:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
that person should not be a bail
 
05:51:33.830 --> 05:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner before or should have
 
05:51:33.840 --> 05:51:35.350 align:start position:0%
commissioner before or should have
um

05:51:35.350 --> 05:51:35.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:51:37.190 --> 05:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
remedial training that's what we had in
 
05:51:38.708 --> 05:51:38.718 align:start position:0%
the faa when somebody didn't do their
 
05:51:41.590 --> 05:51:41.600 align:start position:0%
job right so i think in in in order to
 
05:51:43.670 --> 05:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
have equal protection i believe that
 
05:51:46.230 --> 05:51:46.240 align:start position:0%
shall should not be changed to me thank
 
05:51:46.240 --> 05:51:47.510 align:start position:0%
shall should not be changed to me thank
you

05:51:47.510 --> 05:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:51:48.948 --> 05:51:48.958 align:start position:0%
representative rory
 
05:51:50.070 --> 05:51:50.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:51:50.080 --> 05:51:52.230 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

05:51:52.230 --> 05:51:52.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:51:53.750 --> 05:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned that we're we're really
 
05:51:56.150 --> 05:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
focused on inconveniencing criminals um
 
05:51:58.070 --> 05:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
could we could we realize several things
 
05:52:01.110 --> 05:52:01.120 align:start position:0%
here first you have to be arrested
 
05:52:02.868 --> 05:52:02.878 align:start position:0%
while on bail
 
05:52:04.628 --> 05:52:04.638 align:start position:0%
okay that means you were once charged
 
05:52:06.708 --> 05:52:06.718 align:start position:0%
with a crime there was probable cause to
 
05:52:08.070 --> 05:52:08.080 align:start position:0%
think you committed a crime you were
 
05:52:09.590 --> 05:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
arrested you were released on your own
 
05:52:11.750 --> 05:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
personal recognizance and told do not
 
05:52:13.750 --> 05:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
commit any more crimes you committed
 
05:52:15.990 --> 05:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
another crime and you get arrested now
 
05:52:18.390 --> 05:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
we fixed it so it's only class b
 
05:52:20.470 --> 05:52:20.480 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors i mean excuse me class a
 
05:52:22.708 --> 05:52:22.718 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors and above there's these now
 
05:52:24.230 --> 05:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
we're getting serious crimes that you've
 
05:52:25.670 --> 05:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
committed the second time while you're
 
05:52:27.270 --> 05:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
on bail if you committed a
 
05:52:29.830 --> 05:52:29.840 align:start position:0%
non-arrestable offense you had to be the
 
05:52:31.910 --> 05:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
third time before you would be for a
 
05:52:34.070 --> 05:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
judge so i'd like to hear some some some
 
05:52:35.590 --> 05:52:35.600 align:start position:0%
of this similar sympathy about the
 
05:52:37.270 --> 05:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
inconvenience of victims
 
05:52:39.430 --> 05:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
who who we have already heard about of
 
05:52:41.190 --> 05:52:41.200 align:start position:0%
people who have been hurt or injured by
 
05:52:43.030 --> 05:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
people who have been repeatedly let out
 
05:52:44.150 --> 05:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
on bail
 
05:52:47.110 --> 05:52:47.120 align:start position:0%
all we're asking is in
 
05:52:49.270 --> 05:52:49.280 align:start position:0%
due process what more do prosecution you
 
05:52:51.750 --> 05:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
get than going to see a judge
 
05:52:53.510 --> 05:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
that's what they're there for
 
05:52:55.830 --> 05:52:55.840 align:start position:0%
that is the definition of due to process
 
05:52:57.990 --> 05:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
that is the definition to be brought
 
05:52:59.990 --> 05:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
before the court
 
05:53:01.910 --> 05:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
and that is all we're asking is that
 
05:53:04.070 --> 05:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
they be brought before the court with
 
05:53:05.830 --> 05:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
regard to the 24 hour on call the
 
05:53:09.430 --> 05:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
judicial system itself the judges could
 
05:53:09.440 --> 05:53:10.230 align:start position:0%
judicial system itself the judges could
say

05:53:10.230 --> 05:53:10.240 align:start position:0%
say
 
05:53:12.070 --> 05:53:12.080 align:start position:0%
judge you're on call for
 
05:53:13.510 --> 05:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
domestic violence calls and you're also
 
05:53:15.350 --> 05:53:15.360 align:start position:0%
going to handle bail calls we're not
 
05:53:16.628 --> 05:53:16.638 align:start position:0%
going to micromanage the court to the
 
05:53:17.910 --> 05:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
level to tell them how to assign their
 
05:53:20.150 --> 05:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
personnel all we're doing is saying that
 
05:53:23.510 --> 05:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
we are going to require that an actual
 
05:53:26.548 --> 05:53:26.558 align:start position:0%
judge who's gone to law school who
 
05:53:28.628 --> 05:53:28.638 align:start position:0%
understands the law who has seen these
 
05:53:28.638 --> 05:53:29.670 align:start position:0%
understands the law who has seen these
cases

05:53:29.670 --> 05:53:29.680 align:start position:0%
cases
 
05:53:31.830 --> 05:53:31.840 align:start position:0%
is going to hear you your case after
 
05:53:34.150 --> 05:53:34.160 align:start position:0%
you've been released on the second time
 
05:53:37.110 --> 05:53:37.120 align:start position:0%
that's all that we're saying
 
05:53:39.270 --> 05:53:39.280 align:start position:0%
it baffles me it really does that we're
 
05:53:45.750 --> 05:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:47.030 --> 05:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
representative news i know you had your
 
05:53:48.310 --> 05:53:48.320 align:start position:0%
hand up i
 
05:53:57.350 --> 05:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:57.360 --> 05:53:58.470 align:start position:0%
 
just

05:53:58.470 --> 05:53:58.480 align:start position:0%
just
 
05:53:58.480 --> 05:53:59.750 align:start position:0%
just
before

05:53:59.750 --> 05:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
before
 
05:54:01.910 --> 05:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
generally is if a member has not spoken
 
05:54:03.510 --> 05:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
already wishes to speak i would
 
05:54:06.548 --> 05:54:06.558 align:start position:0%
recognize them before that's why
 
05:54:08.230 --> 05:54:08.240 align:start position:0%
if you wish to
 
05:54:10.150 --> 05:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
i do i i do
 
05:54:12.150 --> 05:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we is pretty
 
05:54:14.390 --> 05:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
common in this committee mr chair is for
 
05:54:16.548 --> 05:54:16.558 align:start position:0%
when during an executive session
 
05:54:18.548 --> 05:54:18.558 align:start position:0%
when one of us has something to say you
 
05:54:18.558 --> 05:54:19.670 align:start position:0%
when one of us has something to say you
rebut

05:54:19.670 --> 05:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
rebut
 
05:54:19.680 --> 05:54:21.030 align:start position:0%
rebut
another

05:54:21.030 --> 05:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
another
 
05:54:22.788 --> 05:54:22.798 align:start position:0%
uh representative has something to say
 
05:54:24.310 --> 05:54:24.320 align:start position:0%
you rebut again
 
05:54:26.150 --> 05:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
um i think representative newman
 
05:54:29.030 --> 05:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
deserves a chance to respond in and he
 
05:54:30.948 --> 05:54:30.958 align:start position:0%
will have that i just was giving you the
 
05:54:32.628 --> 05:54:32.638 align:start position:0%
courtesy of allowing you to speak before
 
05:54:33.750 --> 05:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
representing just because you haven't
 
05:54:35.430 --> 05:54:35.440 align:start position:0%
spoke already well thank you for the
 
05:54:38.310 --> 05:54:38.320 align:start position:0%
courtesy i can wait
 
05:54:39.910 --> 05:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
representative newman raynerman you were
 
05:54:39.920 --> 05:54:41.030 align:start position:0%
representative newman raynerman you were
recognized

05:54:41.030 --> 05:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
05:54:43.030 --> 05:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
first of all i'm not
 
05:54:45.430 --> 05:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
saying this out of the
 
05:54:48.070 --> 05:54:48.080 align:start position:0%
of my sympathy for multiple time
 
05:54:48.080 --> 05:54:49.350 align:start position:0%
of my sympathy for multiple time
offenders

05:54:49.350 --> 05:54:49.360 align:start position:0%
offenders
 
05:54:51.350 --> 05:54:51.360 align:start position:0%
because these people may or may not be
 
05:54:53.270 --> 05:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
multiple time offenders
 
05:54:55.190 --> 05:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
both times that they are there they're
 
05:54:57.110 --> 05:54:57.120 align:start position:0%
charged they are innocent they haven't
 
05:54:59.350 --> 05:54:59.360 align:start position:0%
been adjudicated
 
05:55:03.510 --> 05:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
so all i'm looking for is having
 
05:55:06.788 --> 05:55:06.798 align:start position:0%
equal justice for people on weekends and
 
05:55:09.830 --> 05:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
and that change of that one word changes
 
05:55:12.788 --> 05:55:12.798 align:start position:0%
it to where it takes away due process
 
05:55:14.788 --> 05:55:14.798 align:start position:0%
something that we hear a lot about here
 
05:55:19.590 --> 05:55:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:19.600 --> 05:55:20.708 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:55:20.708 --> 05:55:20.718 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:55:22.470 --> 05:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
representative muse you were recognized
 
05:55:24.788 --> 05:55:24.798 align:start position:0%
one of something i'd also like to say is
 
05:55:26.948 --> 05:55:26.958 align:start position:0%
that the issue of lack of quantification
 
05:55:28.948 --> 05:55:28.958 align:start position:0%
is not just
 
05:55:31.190 --> 05:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note problem um
 
05:55:33.190 --> 05:55:33.200 align:start position:0%
a bill like this would be much better if
 
05:55:34.868 --> 05:55:34.878 align:start position:0%
it came in a budget year because then we
 
05:55:36.470 --> 05:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
could put a price tag on it and we'd
 
05:55:38.708 --> 05:55:38.718 align:start position:0%
pass it and all the costs would be
 
05:55:40.070 --> 05:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
accounted for
 
05:55:42.788 --> 05:55:42.798 align:start position:0%
um the quantify the quantification issue
 
05:55:42.798 --> 05:55:43.830 align:start position:0%
um the quantify the quantification issue
um

05:55:43.830 --> 05:55:43.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:55:46.390 --> 05:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
also relates to who these people are so
 
05:55:48.230 --> 05:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
so i think one of the things that we get
 
05:55:49.510 --> 05:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
the impression of when we read the
 
05:55:51.750 --> 05:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
newspaper and we hear the stories
 
05:55:53.350 --> 05:55:53.360 align:start position:0%
is that
 
05:55:55.510 --> 05:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
virtually all of the people
 
05:55:57.910 --> 05:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
who fall into this situation are are
 
05:55:59.510 --> 05:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
violent offenders
 
05:56:02.230 --> 05:56:02.240 align:start position:0%
um they're they're people who've
 
05:56:05.030 --> 05:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
done horrible things to victims and and
 
05:56:06.470 --> 05:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
i think one of the things that we lose
 
05:56:09.830 --> 05:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
sight of is the vast majority of people
 
05:56:12.548 --> 05:56:12.558 align:start position:0%
that uh that this type of a law would
 
05:56:13.830 --> 05:56:13.840 align:start position:0%
apply to
 
05:56:15.670 --> 05:56:15.680 align:start position:0%
are people who are homeless they're
 
05:56:17.990 --> 05:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
mentally ill they're addicted
 
05:56:19.990 --> 05:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
and and i know this point has been
 
05:56:23.190 --> 05:56:23.200 align:start position:0%
raised before but what we're doing here
 
05:56:23.200 --> 05:56:23.990 align:start position:0%
raised before but what we're doing here
is

05:56:23.990 --> 05:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:56:26.070 --> 05:56:26.080 align:start position:0%
we're once again using the criminal
 
05:56:27.590 --> 05:56:27.600 align:start position:0%
justice system
 
05:56:30.390 --> 05:56:30.400 align:start position:0%
because it's easier
 
05:56:32.788 --> 05:56:32.798 align:start position:0%
than fixing homelessness it's easier
 
05:56:36.070 --> 05:56:36.080 align:start position:0%
than fixing drug addiction it's easier
 
05:56:36.080 --> 05:56:36.948 align:start position:0%
than fixing drug addiction it's easier
than

05:56:36.948 --> 05:56:36.958 align:start position:0%
than
 
05:56:39.510 --> 05:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
improving mental health um
 
05:56:41.350 --> 05:56:41.360 align:start position:0%
and one of the things
 
05:56:42.548 --> 05:56:42.558 align:start position:0%
a lot of people have had long
 
05:56:44.470 --> 05:56:44.480 align:start position:0%
conversations about over the last couple
 
05:56:46.948 --> 05:56:46.958 align:start position:0%
of years is are there things that we can
 
05:56:49.670 --> 05:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
be doing in the criminal justice system
 
05:56:51.590 --> 05:56:51.600 align:start position:0%
and with law enforcement
 
05:56:53.430 --> 05:56:53.440 align:start position:0%
that would address some of these issues
 
05:56:55.190 --> 05:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
at the root level
 
05:56:56.708 --> 05:56:56.718 align:start position:0%
and i
 
05:56:59.270 --> 05:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
i i don't know
 
05:56:59.280 --> 05:57:00.150 align:start position:0%
i i don't know
how

05:57:00.150 --> 05:57:00.160 align:start position:0%

holding
 
05:57:04.470 --> 05:57:04.480 align:start position:0%
more of these people longer
 
05:57:06.230 --> 05:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
are going to help us solve the root
 
05:57:09.510 --> 05:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
problems which really do seem to be drug
 
05:57:12.150 --> 05:57:12.160 align:start position:0%
addiction homelessness and mental
 
05:57:12.160 --> 05:57:14.230 align:start position:0%
