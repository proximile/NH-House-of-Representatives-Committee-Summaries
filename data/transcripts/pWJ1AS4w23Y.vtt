good morning Mr chair and uh good
 
00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
it's not as bad as when I was sent to
 
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
the principal for breaking the rules but
 
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
uh I'm sure you've heard that before if
 
00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:07.620 align:start position:0%
you're on the rules committee
 
00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:08.450 align:start position:0%
you're on the rules committee
um

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:08.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:10.570 align:start position:0%
um
foreign

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:10.580 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
is an email chain
 
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:17.580 align:start position:0%
um and and a draft of the bill as it was
 
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
sent to the clerk most recently
 
00:07:22.189 --> 00:07:22.199 align:start position:0%
um the email chain has to be read from
 
00:07:23.689 --> 00:07:23.699 align:start position:0%
the bottom up so if you look at the
 
00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:25.740 align:start position:0%
first page the the bottom email is the
 
00:07:26.689 --> 00:07:26.699 align:start position:0%
first email
 
00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
and that's the uh the original email
 
00:07:31.309 --> 00:07:31.319 align:start position:0%
sent into the office of legislative
 
00:07:33.469 --> 00:07:33.479 align:start position:0%
services but the request
 
00:07:35.749 --> 00:07:35.759 align:start position:0%
for the the drafting of the bill and
 
00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:36.740 align:start position:0%
that was
 
00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
1241 on the November 22nd
 
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
and the second email going up would be
 
00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:46.020 align:start position:0%
the response from the office saying I
 
00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:47.580 align:start position:0%
was late
 
00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:50.220 align:start position:0%
uh and then the third email up would be
 
00:07:52.969 --> 00:07:52.979 align:start position:0%
my response saying or explaining that
 
00:07:55.309 --> 00:07:55.319 align:start position:0%
I'd received a miscommunication from the
 
00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
actual staff of legislative office
 
00:08:00.469 --> 00:08:00.479 align:start position:0%
that the deadline didn't pertain to me
 
00:08:03.409 --> 00:08:03.419 align:start position:0%
that it only pertained to uh request
 
00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:05.880 align:start position:0%
that it already been filed to to get all
 
00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:08.280 align:start position:0%
their sponsors lined up so that was a
 
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:10.500 align:start position:0%
miscommunication and through no fault of
 
00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
my own uh therefore you know I was not
 
00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
paying attention to the deadline when I
 
00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:16.500 align:start position:0%
filed it 40 minutes late and so I was
 
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
requesting uh
 
00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
to be allowed to you know go forward
 
00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:23.340 align:start position:0%
with the legislation uh then the next
 
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
email up is an email from the actual
 
00:08:28.189 --> 00:08:28.199 align:start position:0%
staffer who was on the email chain uh
 
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:30.360 align:start position:0%
and I blocked her her name Alex I didn't
 
00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:33.500 align:start position:0%
want to you know implicate her but she's
 
00:08:36.529 --> 00:08:36.539 align:start position:0%
apologizing for the you know for the
 
00:08:39.529 --> 00:08:39.539 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding and for the uh the
 
00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:43.020 align:start position:0%
confusion around her um her advice
 
00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:45.180 align:start position:0%
so uh the only reason I'm sharing that
 
00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:47.100 align:start position:0%
email chain is just to establish that it
 
00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:49.260 align:start position:0%
was really no fault of my own for for
 
00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:52.620 align:start position:0%
the late filing and uh and so here we
 
00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:54.180 align:start position:0%
are today
 
00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:56.940 align:start position:0%
and I'm asking you to please allow this
 
00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:58.680 align:start position:0%
bill to go forward in the in the in the
 
00:08:59.750 --> 00:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
public interest
 
00:09:02.509 --> 00:09:02.519 align:start position:0%
uh I don't think that
 
00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:04.980 align:start position:0%
a technicality should be allowed to
 
00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:07.430 align:start position:0%
a technicality should be allowed to
uh

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:09.720 align:start position:0%
you know hold the hold the public back
 
00:09:15.769 --> 00:09:15.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:18.540 align:start position:0%
so that's it in a nutshell
 
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:22.500 align:start position:0%
so I'm here you know if you have any
 
00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
questions or if there's anything else I
 
00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:40.080 --> 00:11:15.949 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:11:15.949 --> 00:11:15.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:18.060 align:start position:0%
morning represent Kaplan good morning
 
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
could you tell us exactly what the staff
 
00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:22.980 align:start position:0%
person and OLS told you
 
00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:25.860 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean she told me that the
 
00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:28.260 align:start position:0%
November 22nd deadline only pertained to
 
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
bills that had already been filed uh and
 
00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:33.660 align:start position:0%
that the deadline was to receive all the
 
00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:36.060 align:start position:0%
sponsors that you wanted to have on the
 
00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:37.430 align:start position:0%
sponsors that you wanted to have on the
bill

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
well just to be clear you say it pertain
 
00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
to bills that are the deadline contained
 
00:11:44.569 --> 00:11:44.579 align:start position:0%
the bills that already been filed yes
 
00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:47.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:52.250 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:58.130 align:start position:0%
 
questions

00:11:58.130 --> 00:11:58.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:00.710 align:start position:0%
 
today

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:03.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and why can't the
 
00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:05.160 align:start position:0%
bill just be filed next fall I assume
 
00:12:06.949 --> 00:12:06.959 align:start position:0%
missed a deadline and that was my
 
00:12:06.959 --> 00:12:08.569 align:start position:0%
missed a deadline and that was my
Approach

00:12:08.569 --> 00:12:08.579 align:start position:0%
Approach
 
00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:12.660 align:start position:0%
well I mean it's uh there there's good
 
00:12:14.569 --> 00:12:14.579 align:start position:0%
reasons for that I mean this is uh I
 
00:12:15.829 --> 00:12:15.839 align:start position:0%
don't want to argue with the merits of
 
00:12:17.569 --> 00:12:17.579 align:start position:0%
the bill uh in front of the rules
 
00:12:19.069 --> 00:12:19.079 align:start position:0%
committee but
 
00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
this bill pertains to uh enabling
 
00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:24.200 align:start position:0%
legislation that was passed last session
 
00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
for facilities that would possibly be
 
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
proposed to be built in the state in the
 
00:12:32.509 --> 00:12:32.519 align:start position:0%
interim and there are no rules in place
 
00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:35.220 align:start position:0%
to regulate those facilities so this the
 
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
the the bill that's drafted in front of
 
00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:40.680 align:start position:0%
you here is uh to enable that those rule
 
00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:41.410 align:start position:0%
you here is uh to enable that those rule
making

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:41.420 align:start position:0%
making
 
00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:46.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker
 
00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:52.610 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker
yes

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:52.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:54.829 --> 00:12:54.839 align:start position:0%
if you know
 
00:12:57.410 --> 00:12:57.420 align:start position:0%
um are we not still in the period of
 
00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
time when the Senators still are allowed
 
00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:01.500 align:start position:0%
to file bills
 
00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
yes yes we are as far as I understand is
 
00:13:08.629 --> 00:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
there any reason why you couldn't
 
00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
ended yesterday
 
00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
 
00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:35.870 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
Kaplan

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
well we uh
 
00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:48.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:50.700 align:start position:0%
I would move in light of the the move
 
00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
deadline and the confusion that we've
 
00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:54.300 align:start position:0%
heard from a number of members I would
 
00:13:56.389 --> 00:13:56.399 align:start position:0%
move that we allow late drafting on this
 
00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:00.300 align:start position:0%
bill and I I will also subsequently move
 
00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:02.100 align:start position:0%
late drafting on the other bills that
 
00:14:03.949 --> 00:14:03.959 align:start position:0%
were submitted to OLS before four
 
00:14:03.959 --> 00:14:09.769 align:start position:0%
were submitted to OLS before four
o'clock

00:14:09.769 --> 00:14:09.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
I'll second the motion with respect to
 
00:14:16.009 --> 00:14:16.019 align:start position:0%
representative kaplan's bill
 
00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:27.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:29.629 --> 00:14:29.639 align:start position:0%
yeah I I get that
 
00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
the deadline was different this time
 
00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:33.240 align:start position:0%
like I said I got caught by that myself
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
but rules of rules and I'm happy to file
 
00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:38.940 align:start position:0%
my bill on the fall and I'm not
 
00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:40.380 align:start position:0%
convinced of the urgency that this
 
00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:48.490 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:48.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:51.949 --> 00:14:51.959 align:start position:0%
I think if we were to have let people
 
00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:54.660 align:start position:0%
know in advance that at this meeting we
 
00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
would accommodate these requests
 
00:15:00.889 --> 00:15:00.899 align:start position:0%
um that would be a different uh story uh
 
00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:02.220 align:start position:0%
given that there are a number of other
 
00:15:05.449 --> 00:15:05.459 align:start position:0%
members outside of this room today who
 
00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:09.180 align:start position:0%
will probably be irritated if we were to
 
00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:10.689 align:start position:0%
will probably be irritated if we were to
allow

00:15:10.689 --> 00:15:10.699 align:start position:0%
allow
 
00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:14.100 align:start position:0%
such bills through today we should
 
00:15:15.829 --> 00:15:15.839 align:start position:0%
probably not do that
 
00:15:15.839 --> 00:15:17.389 align:start position:0%
probably not do that
yeah

00:15:17.389 --> 00:15:17.399 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:15:20.449 --> 00:15:20.459 align:start position:0%
Mr chair this motion only pertains to
 
00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:23.000 align:start position:0%
this one just for the clarification yeah
 
00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
we'll do each bill separately thank you
 
00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:29.689 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:15:29.689 --> 00:15:29.699 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:15:32.389 --> 00:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
um I think that this particular bill can
 
00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:35.100 align:start position:0%
be distinguished because in fact
 
00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:37.620 align:start position:0%
um there was misinformation that was
 
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
given to the representative as far as
 
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
the deadline
 
00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
um and he relied on that information the
 
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
rep the person from OLS admitted that
 
00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
she had provided misinformation and I
 
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
although there must have been some
 
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
scramble at some point because you
 
00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
figured out that November 22nd at noon
 
00:15:59.870 --> 00:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
was the deadline it was a somewhat
 
00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
complicated bill so it did sort of set
 
00:16:07.189 --> 00:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
you back on the on the path of
 
00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:09.240 align:start position:0%
developing the bill which you otherwise
 
00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:11.100 align:start position:0%
would have been proceeding with with
 
00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
more alacrity so
 
00:16:15.889 --> 00:16:15.899 align:start position:0%
um that's why I am in support of this
 
00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:25.069 --> 00:16:25.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:25.079 --> 00:16:27.350 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
well if I'm correct the clerk will call
 
00:16:32.509 --> 00:16:32.519 align:start position:0%
the roll thank you Mr Mr chairman the
 
00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:34.380 align:start position:0%
motion is to allow
 
00:16:36.769 --> 00:16:36.779 align:start position:0%
representative Packard no
 
00:16:38.449 --> 00:16:38.459 align:start position:0%
representative shurtleff yes
 
00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:40.620 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:41.689 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
no

00:16:41.689 --> 00:16:41.699 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
representative Sanborn no representative
 
00:16:49.069 --> 00:16:49.079 align:start position:0%
Osborne no representative Sweeney no
 
00:16:51.009 --> 00:16:51.019 align:start position:0%
representative Wilhelm yes
 
00:16:53.509 --> 00:16:53.519 align:start position:0%
representative Weber yes
 
00:16:56.449 --> 00:16:56.459 align:start position:0%
representative evil yes
 
00:17:02.569 --> 00:17:02.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:13.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:16.130 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:16.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:25.789 --> 00:17:25.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:34.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:44.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:47.029 --> 00:17:47.039 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr Speaker and good morning
 
00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
everyone thanks for being here today
 
00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:51.660 align:start position:0%
it's good to be back
 
00:17:55.549 --> 00:17:55.559 align:start position:0%
um I'm here because I also had a late
 
00:17:55.559 --> 00:17:56.870 align:start position:0%
um I'm here because I also had a late
filing

00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
filing
 
00:17:58.789 --> 00:17:58.799 align:start position:0%
um I did not know about the deadline
 
00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
being noon I thought it was 5 p.m I had
 
00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
submitted an LSR for former
 
00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:07.500 align:start position:0%
representative skip Berry in that
 
00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:09.660 align:start position:0%
morning on pool safety I had submitted
 
00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
some lsrs and the final LSR that I
 
00:18:15.409 --> 00:18:15.419 align:start position:0%
submitted was for audio video
 
00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:17.580 align:start position:0%
surveillance requirement on special
 
00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:20.340 align:start position:0%
education buses
 
00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:21.710 align:start position:0%
education buses
um

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:21.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:25.909 --> 00:18:25.919 align:start position:0%
that got submitted at 12 14 p.m and
 
00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:28.620 align:start position:0%
everything else went through OLS except
 
00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:30.780 align:start position:0%
for that final bill
 
00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:33.780 align:start position:0%
so it was an honest mistake and I would
 
00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
have been willing to go till next
 
00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
session to do it but um
 
00:18:40.909 --> 00:18:40.919 align:start position:0%
yesterday after speaking with
 
00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
representative kutab of Wyndham we
 
00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:46.200 align:start position:0%
figured out that we have some bipartisan
 
00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
support for this bill and helping her
 
00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:51.900 align:start position:0%
out as well with another bill so
 
00:18:54.169 --> 00:18:54.179 align:start position:0%
when I got the notification of the rules
 
00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:55.860 align:start position:0%
committee I thought why not you know
 
00:18:57.529 --> 00:18:57.539 align:start position:0%
this is a perfect example of working
 
00:18:59.870 --> 00:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
together and going forward and it's a
 
00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
I don't I did not print out the
 
00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:09.780 align:start position:0%
documentation obviously it's in my email
 
00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:13.740 align:start position:0%
from OLS but they immediately responded
 
00:19:15.169 --> 00:19:15.179 align:start position:0%
with you'll have to go to the rules
 
00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
committee so I reached out to Paul Smith
 
00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:21.740 align:start position:0%
the clerk Rachel and our staff office
 
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
and realized that this was an
 
00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:26.220 align:start position:0%
opportunity to learn about the process
 
00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:30.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr chairman good morning
 
00:19:34.909 --> 00:19:34.919 align:start position:0%
representative could you elaborate
 
00:19:37.669 --> 00:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
briefly on what the safety issue is of
 
00:19:40.549 --> 00:19:40.559 align:start position:0%
this bill yeah so
 
00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
um I presented this bill in my first
 
00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:46.380 align:start position:0%
term and it was tabled
 
00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:47.390 align:start position:0%
term and it was tabled
um

00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:47.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:50.340 align:start position:0%
audio video surveillance is required on
 
00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
regular school buses however it is not a
 
00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
law the requirement of audio video
 
00:19:58.669 --> 00:19:58.679 align:start position:0%
surveillance on special ed
 
00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:01.919 align:start position:0%
transportation and the issue came up
 
00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes in the North country or around
 
00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:07.380 align:start position:0%
more rural parts a student may not be
 
00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:09.900 align:start position:0%
transported on an actual School Bus it
 
00:20:12.529 --> 00:20:12.539 align:start position:0%
might be like a van type but when we
 
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
worked on this during my first term and
 
00:20:19.789 --> 00:20:19.799 align:start position:0%
then the second term was covid so I just
 
00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:22.100 align:start position:0%
thought to hold off
 
00:20:25.789 --> 00:20:25.799 align:start position:0%
the state police the ACLU helped work
 
00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:29.220 align:start position:0%
with us in terms of defining the
 
00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
vehicles and also privacy was an initial
 
00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:35.460 align:start position:0%
concern about who would be
 
00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:37.740 align:start position:0%
watching the audio video surveillance
 
00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
who would have access to it
 
00:20:42.289 --> 00:20:42.299 align:start position:0%
most school districts
 
00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:45.780 align:start position:0%
have that as part of their General
 
00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:46.909 align:start position:0%
have that as part of their General
um

00:20:46.909 --> 00:20:46.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
uh you know Safety and Security
 
00:20:54.289 --> 00:20:54.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:54.299 --> 00:20:56.270 align:start position:0%
 
I

00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:20:57.890 --> 00:20:57.900 align:start position:0%
am I'm not sure if you've looked at all
 
00:21:00.289 --> 00:21:00.299 align:start position:0%
the lsrs but I understand uh there's
 
00:21:01.909 --> 00:21:01.919 align:start position:0%
over a hundred that have to do with
 
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
education in the education committee
 
00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:07.380 align:start position:0%
uh this sounds like a subject that I'm
 
00:21:09.169 --> 00:21:09.179 align:start position:0%
sure you could find a bill to attach and
 
00:21:12.049 --> 00:21:12.059 align:start position:0%
mend them into and uh move forward with
 
00:21:12.059 --> 00:21:16.070 align:start position:0%
mend them into and uh move forward with
it

00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:21.289 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:21:21.289 --> 00:21:21.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:37.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:43.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:44.810 align:start position:0%
 
second

00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:44.820 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:47.700 align:start position:0%
motion has been accepted uh we're open
 
00:21:49.909 --> 00:21:49.919 align:start position:0%
for discussion
 
00:21:54.049 --> 00:21:54.059 align:start position:0%
thank you I I I understand the idea
 
00:21:55.789 --> 00:21:55.799 align:start position:0%
about attaching this to a different
 
00:21:57.890 --> 00:21:57.900 align:start position:0%
education bill but it seems to me that
 
00:21:59.330 --> 00:21:59.340 align:start position:0%
it's much cleaner
 
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
provides a much better notice to the
 
00:22:03.049 --> 00:22:03.059 align:start position:0%
General Public
 
00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:05.400 align:start position:0%
if we allowed late drafting of the bill
 
00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
so it could go through the full Bill
 
00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:08.570 align:start position:0%
so it could go through the full Bill
process

00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:08.580 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:22:12.049 --> 00:22:12.059 align:start position:0%
and I sincerely hope that if it gets
 
00:22:14.149 --> 00:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
attached to a different education bill
 
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
it will have a separate Pub noticed
 
00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:17.700 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
because we have seen over the past years
 
00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
some some sessions we have real Mission
 
00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:27.020 align:start position:0%
creep as to what gets attached to a bill
 
00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:31.740 align:start position:0%
and you know I I'm remembering back when
 
00:22:33.409 --> 00:22:33.419 align:start position:0%
anything that had anything to do with
 
00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
landlords and tenants got attached to
 
00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:38.100 align:start position:0%
another landlord tenant Bill and it did
 
00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:40.500 align:start position:0%
not give people adequate notice about
 
00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
what was being done to them and their
 
00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:44.270 align:start position:0%
what was being done to them and their
rights

00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:44.280 align:start position:0%
rights
 
00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:46.380 align:start position:0%
because there was never any public
 
00:22:48.409 --> 00:22:48.419 align:start position:0%
hearing on it so I hope that if this
 
00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
does wind up being attached to something
 
00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:52.740 align:start position:0%
else there will be a separate public
 
00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
hearing but I'm going to say no because
 
00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:56.940 align:start position:0%
I think it ought to be allowed for late
 
00:22:59.149 --> 00:22:59.159 align:start position:0%
drafting thank you
 
00:23:02.029 --> 00:23:02.039 align:start position:0%
am I allowed to make a comment
 
00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:04.980 align:start position:0%
related to attaching it
 
00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:06.710 align:start position:0%
related to attaching it
yeah

00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:07.789 align:start position:0%
yeah
um

00:23:07.789 --> 00:23:07.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:10.380 align:start position:0%
well also just wouldn't
 
00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
confusion if there is fiscal note
 
00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
attached as well I think that this would
 
00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:18.500 align:start position:0%
probably be on the part of the bus
 
00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
providers but there's a question on the
 
00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
fiscal of who would be paying for this
 
00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
piece of equipment
 
00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:29.340 align:start position:0%
um and I have to say this is not
 
00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:31.620 align:start position:0%
this is about kids
 
00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:34.380 align:start position:0%
on school buses and particularly I'm
 
00:23:36.409 --> 00:23:36.419 align:start position:0%
chair of the bipartisan disability
 
00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
caucus and I know we have members here
 
00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:40.980 align:start position:0%
that support our caucus
 
00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:42.770 align:start position:0%
that support our caucus
um

00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:42.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
this is about the safety of our
 
00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:47.580 align:start position:0%
vulnerable kids and my son who's 17 is
 
00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:49.020 align:start position:0%
one of those kids
 
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
he cannot tell me when he gets off the
 
00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:51.890 align:start position:0%
he cannot tell me when he gets off the
bus

00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:51.900 align:start position:0%
bus
 
00:23:55.789 --> 00:23:55.799 align:start position:0%
what happened what went on and there
 
00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:57.780 align:start position:0%
have been situations where it's because
 
00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
of the audio video surveillance that we
 
00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:02.820 align:start position:0%
had in our school district that parents
 
00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:05.039 align:start position:0%
demanded that we didn't have to get
 
00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:06.900 align:start position:0%
police involvement or outside
 
00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:08.940 align:start position:0%
involvement we were able to just look at
 
00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:11.220 align:start position:0%
the video and see what was going on with
 
00:24:14.649 --> 00:24:14.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:17.900 align:start position:0%
and it's also safety about
 
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
this representative could have from
 
00:24:22.669 --> 00:24:22.679 align:start position:0%
Windham shared a story where she went to
 
00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
her school district
 
00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
um so yeah we represented it we don't
 
00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:27.720 align:start position:0%
want to
 
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
go too far off the subject
 
00:24:36.049 --> 00:24:36.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:39.649 --> 00:24:39.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:42.409 --> 00:24:42.419 align:start position:0%
repair Sanborn
 
00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:44.460 align:start position:0%
of course we're very sympathetic because
 
00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:46.260 align:start position:0%
of the situation and because of the bill
 
00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
for both of you but we try to be really
 
00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:50.580 align:start position:0%
consistent in the rules committee about
 
00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:53.460 align:start position:0%
following the was it an emergency you
 
00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:55.260 align:start position:0%
know that kind of thing so I'm sorry I'm
 
00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
not going to be able to support this but
 
00:24:58.310 --> 00:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
hopefully you can have it amended onto
 
00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:00.470 align:start position:0%
hopefully you can have it amended onto
something

00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
I'd welcome any suggestions as well
 
00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:05.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:07.500 align:start position:0%
well like I said we know of at least 100
 
00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
bills that are going to education
 
00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
so out of those hundred I'm sure we
 
00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker I'd just like to
 
00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:22.260 align:start position:0%
um speak in favor of letting the bill
 
00:25:24.409 --> 00:25:24.419 align:start position:0%
come in for late drafting I'm very
 
00:25:26.149 --> 00:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
concerned about the safety of the
 
00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:27.740 align:start position:0%
children on these
 
00:25:30.769 --> 00:25:30.779 align:start position:0%
vehicles and somewhat alarmed that it's
 
00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:39.049 --> 00:25:39.059 align:start position:0%
there be no further discussion Clerk of
 
00:25:39.059 --> 00:25:40.130 align:start position:0%
there be no further discussion Clerk of
Colorado

rules committee
 
00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:51.900 align:start position:0%
I have three documents uh getting passed
 
00:26:54.289 --> 00:26:54.299 align:start position:0%
around or three kind of bundles of
 
00:26:56.810 --> 00:26:56.820 align:start position:0%
documents getting passed around
 
00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:58.210 align:start position:0%
documents getting passed around

um
the

00:26:59.750 --> 00:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:27:01.669 --> 00:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
um issue in question
 
00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
um came to my attention
 
00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
um on uh
 
00:27:09.409 --> 00:27:09.419 align:start position:0%
uh December 14th as you can see on the
 
00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
first there's kind of like a um
 
00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:13.980 align:start position:0%
the first document there is kind of a
 
00:27:18.409 --> 00:27:18.419 align:start position:0%
like a draft 20 2000 or December 14th
 
00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:23.340 align:start position:0%
2020 across the side of it and um
 
00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:26.220 align:start position:0%
this is uh documented it's from my town
 
00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh budget committee
 
00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:32.100 align:start position:0%
where we were um considering the next
 
00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:34.559 align:start position:0%
year's uh
 
00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:36.360 align:start position:0%
um Warren articles
 
00:27:42.649 --> 00:27:42.659 align:start position:0%
and on page five and on to six there was
 
00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:46.500 align:start position:0%
information about the the newly adopted
 
00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
veterans credit
 
00:27:53.890 --> 00:27:53.900 align:start position:0%
um that was part of HB 1667 last time
 
00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
and it
 
00:28:00.169 --> 00:28:00.179 align:start position:0%
um the explanation uh said that
 
00:28:02.570 --> 00:28:02.580 align:start position:0%
essentially we had to accept the
 
00:28:08.149 --> 00:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
veterans credit as expanded by 1667 and
 
00:28:11.289 --> 00:28:11.299 align:start position:0%
if we did not or did not have a warrant
 
00:28:13.789 --> 00:28:13.799 align:start position:0%
later found out that if we did not have
 
00:28:15.769 --> 00:28:15.779 align:start position:0%
a Warren article the veterans credit
 
00:28:18.289 --> 00:28:18.299 align:start position:0%
that we had already accepted for the
 
00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:19.620 align:start position:0%
amount that we had already accepted
 
00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:22.500 align:start position:0%
would be Nolan void
 
00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
and would be revert to the standard
 
00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
veteran credit of 50 dollars
 
00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:28.730 align:start position:0%
veteran credit of 50 dollars
and

00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:28.740 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
um that was not my uh understanding of
 
00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
the legislation when it was passed I
 
00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
believe that it was uh
 
00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:38.460 align:start position:0%
um you could keep what you already
 
00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:41.220 align:start position:0%
previously had adopted or you could
 
00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
accept this new
 
00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:46.860 align:start position:0%
um expanded uh eligibility if you had
 
00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:49.500 align:start position:0%
already adopted a veterans credit of
 
00:28:52.669 --> 00:28:52.679 align:start position:0%
let's say 500 or 750 you could keep that
 
00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:55.140 align:start position:0%
credit and if you wanted to the
 
00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
legislature was offering you a more
 
00:28:59.149 --> 00:28:59.159 align:start position:0%
expanded option
 
00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
and you would um could put that on the
 
00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:04.980 align:start position:0%
ballot in the the town could be able to
 
00:29:06.529 --> 00:29:06.539 align:start position:0%
decide whether or not they wanted to
 
00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
expand that uh definition to the in
 
00:29:10.909 --> 00:29:10.919 align:start position:0%
addition to the people that they've
 
00:29:10.919 --> 00:29:11.710 align:start position:0%
addition to the people that they've
already

00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:11.720 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:29:16.789 --> 00:29:16.799 align:start position:0%
offered that uh exemption to and so
 
00:29:16.799 --> 00:29:17.690 align:start position:0%
offered that uh exemption to and so
um

00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:17.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:20.820 align:start position:0%
giving that uh
 
00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:26.340 align:start position:0%
information I uh I followed up with my
 
00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:29.340 align:start position:0%
Town Administrator to clarify whether
 
00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
that was indeed like what was was
 
00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:35.640 align:start position:0%
written as far as um were they just
 
00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:37.140 align:start position:0%
misinterpreting was it a
 
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
miscommunication or something and the
 
00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
second document is the
 
00:29:44.389 --> 00:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
um the technical information released
 
00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:46.980 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Revenue
 
00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:48.710 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Revenue
which

00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
um you can see on the second page I
 
00:29:55.909 --> 00:29:55.919 align:start position:0%
guess so if you've already had the
 
00:29:58.610 --> 00:29:58.620 align:start position:0%
status standard veterans credit it it
 
00:30:00.529 --> 00:30:00.539 align:start position:0%
first says essentially you don't have to
 
00:30:02.149 --> 00:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
do anything because you haven't accepted
 
00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
anything it just automatically changes
 
00:30:06.889 --> 00:30:06.899 align:start position:0%
but if you have accepted the optional uh
 
00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:09.240 align:start position:0%
veterans tax credit or the
 
00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
um all veterans tax credit in the bottom
 
00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh bulletin bullet of each of these kind
 
00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:20.580 align:start position:0%
of uh all veterans or standard veterans
 
00:30:23.149 --> 00:30:23.159 align:start position:0%
it says if the optional veterans tax
 
00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:25.380 align:start position:0%
credit is not re-adopted
 
00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:27.720 align:start position:0%
uh the standards veterans tax credit
 
00:30:30.649 --> 00:30:30.659 align:start position:0%
which is fifty dollars will be played in
 
00:30:34.970 --> 00:30:34.980 align:start position:0%
place for January 1st uh April 1st 2023
 
00:30:36.169 --> 00:30:36.179 align:start position:0%
tax year
 
00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:38.100 align:start position:0%
with which will also include the
 
00:30:41.149 --> 00:30:41.159 align:start position:0%
expanded eligibility requirements so
 
00:30:43.730 --> 00:30:43.740 align:start position:0%
um it does the same thing for the all
 
00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:47.100 align:start position:0%
veterans tax credits so the what what
 
00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
would happen is
 
00:30:52.130 --> 00:30:52.140 align:start position:0%
um that if you didn't put in a warrant
 
00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
article or you didn't bring up this at
 
00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
all you would automatically revert to
 
00:30:59.269 --> 00:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
the 50 veterans tax credit which I don't
 
00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:01.260 align:start position:0%
believe was the intention of the house
 
00:31:03.169 --> 00:31:03.179 align:start position:0%
and I don't think that it would be it
 
00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:04.620 align:start position:0%
would be um
 
00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
a great topic of discussion if it was
 
00:31:12.409 --> 00:31:12.419 align:start position:0%
um so with that information I want I
 
00:31:14.810 --> 00:31:14.820 align:start position:0%
went to the Attorney General's office to
 
00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:17.880 align:start position:0%
get clarification on the actual law and
 
00:31:20.389 --> 00:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
say is this your interpretation of the
 
00:31:23.210 --> 00:31:23.220 align:start position:0%
law and um I had a conversation with
 
00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
them on Friday
 
00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:26.580 align:start position:0%
um over the phone and I got this
 
00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
document the third document that I
 
00:31:29.450 --> 00:31:29.460 align:start position:0%
passed around
 
00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:32.100 align:start position:0%
um yesterday from them
 
00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:32.990 align:start position:0%
um yesterday from them
um

00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:36.360 align:start position:0%
explaining that yes that is the current
 
00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
understanding of
 
00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:41.460 align:start position:0%
um the RSA
 
00:31:44.450 --> 00:31:44.460 align:start position:0%
um even though so the RSA
 
00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:46.620 align:start position:0%
um says
 
00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:48.769 align:start position:0%
um says
uh

00:31:48.769 --> 00:31:48.779 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:31:51.169 --> 00:31:51.179 align:start position:0%
uh to
 
00:31:54.289 --> 00:31:54.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:55.970 --> 00:31:55.980 align:start position:0%
you know we really don't get into the
 
00:31:58.490 --> 00:31:58.500 align:start position:0%
depth of it too much that's my main the
 
00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
main soap and we have is why were you
 
00:32:03.769 --> 00:32:03.779 align:start position:0%
late so the main reason why I was late
 
00:32:05.149 --> 00:32:05.159 align:start position:0%
is because I didn't know about this
 
00:32:08.149 --> 00:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
issue and and I believe that it
 
00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:11.940 align:start position:0%
um and as as the documents that I show
 
00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:14.100 align:start position:0%
um I
 
00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
I don't I did not know about this until
 
00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:19.020 align:start position:0%
just last week so
 
00:32:21.649 --> 00:32:21.659 align:start position:0%
and I believe it's time sensitive as
 
00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:25.860 align:start position:0%
it comes up in April 1st of Mr Speaker
 
00:32:28.549 --> 00:32:28.559 align:start position:0%
question Weber
 
00:32:30.169 --> 00:32:30.179 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:32.340 align:start position:0%
question my question is
 
00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
um we're not at the time we're not out
 
00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:37.020 align:start position:0%
of time for filing the a warrant
 
00:32:41.510 --> 00:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
petition are we no so the the people
 
00:32:44.389 --> 00:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
could the Warren articles in my town
 
00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:47.820 align:start position:0%
yeah they have to be filed as round
 
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
um or they the first public hearing for
 
00:32:52.789 --> 00:32:52.799 align:start position:0%
these Warren articles will happen unlike
 
00:32:56.149 --> 00:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
January 14th so it will be very time
 
00:32:58.730 --> 00:32:58.740 align:start position:0%
sensitive but yes it it it's
 
00:33:01.669 --> 00:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
theoretically if we you know if the
 
00:33:04.669 --> 00:33:04.679 align:start position:0%
house agreed with this uh being a
 
00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:08.460 align:start position:0%
concern we could you know bipartisan we
 
00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:09.230 align:start position:0%
concern we could you know bipartisan we
could

00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:09.240 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
um potentially get it fixed before the
 
00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:14.700 align:start position:0%
Warren articles are are notice to the
 
00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:15.950 align:start position:0%
Warren articles are are notice to the
publicans

00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
publicans
 
00:33:18.409 --> 00:33:18.419 align:start position:0%
and the hearing is held
 
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
well I guess my question is I'm
 
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
I'm agreeing it's of concern yeah okay
 
00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:26.649 align:start position:0%
I'm agreeing it's of concern yeah okay
absolutely

00:33:26.649 --> 00:33:26.659 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
00:33:30.769 --> 00:33:30.779 align:start position:0%
but just as the issue before us and the
 
00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:33.260 align:start position:0%
last question was of concern
 
00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
uh we're out of time and you actually
 
00:33:38.029 --> 00:33:38.039 align:start position:0%
have a way of curing it by simply
 
00:33:40.370 --> 00:33:40.380 align:start position:0%
putting it on the warrant is that is
 
00:33:42.169 --> 00:33:42.179 align:start position:0%
that not true
 
00:33:44.029 --> 00:33:44.039 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question if you've
 
00:33:47.090 --> 00:33:47.100 align:start position:0%
understood the process so so yes it will
 
00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
be a warrant article in my town right
 
00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
I'm sure it will be a worn article in
 
00:33:53.090 --> 00:33:53.100 align:start position:0%
many towns okay but if the Warren
 
00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
article fails
 
00:33:59.630 --> 00:33:59.640 align:start position:0%
to re-adopt right then the
 
00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:01.740 align:start position:0%
um veterans tax credit we currently
 
00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:05.580 align:start position:0%
offer 750 in my town and if this worn
 
00:34:08.089 --> 00:34:08.099 align:start position:0%
article fails we would have essentially
 
00:34:11.089 --> 00:34:11.099 align:start position:0%
said you get now everyone gets fifty
 
00:34:13.609 --> 00:34:13.619 align:start position:0%
dollars instead of the current 750 kind
 
00:34:15.409 --> 00:34:15.419 align:start position:0%
of a thing and I don't think that was
 
00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
the intention of the legislation follow
 
00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:18.530 align:start position:0%
the intention of the legislation follow
through

00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:18.540 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:20.700 align:start position:0%
but isn't that a question that's up to
 
00:34:23.389 --> 00:34:23.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:25.970 --> 00:34:25.980 align:start position:0%
oh absolutely yes I think I just think
 
00:34:27.649 --> 00:34:27.659 align:start position:0%
that it wasn't agree with it but yeah
 
00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:29.580 align:start position:0%
yeah I just I
 
00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:31.320 align:start position:0%
um it was my understanding when the
 
00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
legislation was passed that we were
 
00:34:37.129 --> 00:34:37.139 align:start position:0%
um that if you had already passed let's
 
00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:39.720 align:start position:0%
say the 750 you could keep giving the
 
00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:42.540 align:start position:0%
750 that you had already adopted
 
00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:46.020 align:start position:0%
and this legislation wouldn't
 
00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:48.540 align:start position:0%
harm the like this passage of this
 
00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:50.820 align:start position:0%
wouldn't harm or threaten that
 
00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
but apparently it will if if you don't
 
00:35:16.849 --> 00:35:16.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:16.859 --> 00:35:26.870 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:29.450 --> 00:35:29.460 align:start position:0%
tell me again what town you live in fake
 
00:35:30.730 --> 00:35:30.740 align:start position:0%
remove things
 
00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:34.440 align:start position:0%
involved with high pressure consumption
 
00:35:36.770 --> 00:35:36.780 align:start position:0%
creating my hometown of coffee the third
 
00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:40.190 align:start position:0%
creating my hometown of coffee the third
generation

00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:40.200 align:start position:0%

Fremont

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:49.790 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:13.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:36:15.109 --> 00:36:15.119 align:start position:0%

against this as well but
 
00:36:27.349 --> 00:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
um it's very clear that there's a path
 
00:36:28.970 --> 00:36:28.980 align:start position:0%
that goes directly to the voters in
 
00:36:43.849 --> 00:36:43.859 align:start position:0%

00:38:54.829 --> 00:38:54.839 align:start position:0%
state when this committee started
 
00:38:56.810 --> 00:38:56.820 align:start position:0%
we had put out a survey through the
 
00:38:58.790 --> 00:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
Department of Education through Steve
 
00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:03.060 align:start position:0%
Appleby the director of uh certification
 
00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:05.220 align:start position:0%
and the return in October was just a
 
00:39:08.569 --> 00:39:08.579 align:start position:0%
meager 16 from superintendents
 
00:39:11.930 --> 00:39:11.940 align:start position:0%
in November we had 40 percent return
 
00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
just yesterday when I spoke to Steve we
 
00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:17.640 align:start position:0%
now have 61 percent and it is confirmed
 
00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
from our districts now that we have a
 
00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
definite shortage in teachers in special
 
00:39:27.530 --> 00:39:27.540 align:start position:0%
education mathematics and the Sciences
 
00:39:30.050 --> 00:39:30.060 align:start position:0%
and we need to do something about the
 
00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
pathways which we need to generate as
 
00:39:34.609 --> 00:39:34.619 align:start position:0%
far as alternative certification for
 
00:39:37.069 --> 00:39:37.079 align:start position:0%
people within the state who want to
 
00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:39.180 align:start position:0%
teach because there is this drastic
 
00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:41.640 align:start position:0%
shortage especially in special education
 
00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
right now or see where we're seeing the
 
00:39:47.109 --> 00:39:47.119 align:start position:0%
other health impaired IEP category
 
00:39:50.089 --> 00:39:50.099 align:start position:0%
Skyrocket on us and a lot of this is a
 
00:39:52.430 --> 00:39:52.440 align:start position:0%
result of the pandemic
 
00:39:56.089 --> 00:39:56.099 align:start position:0%
so what we have here is a request to
 
00:39:58.849 --> 00:39:58.859 align:start position:0%
extend the uh and you'll see in the back
 
00:40:02.270 --> 00:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
side of your sheet there the one-year
 
00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
certification of Eligibility that's
 
00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:08.700 align:start position:0%
already an RSA 18939 Dash B to extend
 
00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:11.160 align:start position:0%
this for one year immediately following
 
00:40:14.450 --> 00:40:14.460 align:start position:0%
that if the school board so requests and
 
00:40:16.190 --> 00:40:16.200 align:start position:0%
it has to be a consecutive year attached
 
00:40:17.930 --> 00:40:17.940 align:start position:0%
to the first year
 
00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:20.220 align:start position:0%
the purpose for this is that we have
 
00:40:23.690 --> 00:40:23.700 align:start position:0%
folks that may come in and they in order
 
00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
to be a certified staff member like this
 
00:40:29.210 --> 00:40:29.220 align:start position:0%
you must have a bachelor's degree
 
00:40:31.130 --> 00:40:31.140 align:start position:0%
you must have a criminal background
 
00:40:33.650 --> 00:40:33.660 align:start position:0%
check and you must have experience in
 
00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
the field
 
00:40:38.450 --> 00:40:38.460 align:start position:0%
and what we have now is a number of
 
00:40:39.950 --> 00:40:39.960 align:start position:0%
people in the state right now that are
 
00:40:43.010 --> 00:40:43.020 align:start position:0%
on this one year ticket however they may
 
00:40:45.230 --> 00:40:45.240 align:start position:0%
have come on in March of last year and
 
00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
the tickets good through March of this
 
00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:48.349 align:start position:0%
the tickets good through March of this
year

00:40:48.349 --> 00:40:48.359 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:40:51.770 --> 00:40:51.780 align:start position:0%
and what we want to do is try to ensure
 
00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:53.160 align:start position:0%
that we have continuity in our
 
00:40:55.849 --> 00:40:55.859 align:start position:0%
classrooms and finding these people to
 
00:40:58.250 --> 00:40:58.260 align:start position:0%
replace the ones which we have who are
 
00:41:00.530 --> 00:41:00.540 align:start position:0%
currently in the classrooms struggling
 
00:41:02.890 --> 00:41:02.900 align:start position:0%
to get their certification
 
00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
and pass the methods courses they need
 
00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
more time than one year to attend the
 
00:41:10.609 --> 00:41:10.619 align:start position:0%
system the university system or whatever
 
00:41:13.790 --> 00:41:13.800 align:start position:0%
system they're getting this through so
 
00:41:15.829 --> 00:41:15.839 align:start position:0%
um I've got on the backside what we're
 
00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:17.880 align:start position:0%
intending to do this has been worked out
 
00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Education and
 
00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:22.260 align:start position:0%
there was one line also that was
 
00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:26.240 align:start position:0%
injected by the National Education
 
00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:28.200 align:start position:0%
association's main reason representative
 
00:41:31.130 --> 00:41:31.140 align:start position:0%
is why why are you late because we did
 
00:41:33.890 --> 00:41:33.900 align:start position:0%
not have the data at the November 22
 
00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:36.540 align:start position:0%
deadline we receive this data just
 
00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:40.140 align:start position:0%
within the last week and as a result of
 
00:41:42.109 --> 00:41:42.119 align:start position:0%
that we know that we definitely have
 
00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:45.060 align:start position:0%
this shortage it's not just a nationwide
 
00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
shortage is the shortage in this state
 
00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
we're having more calls coming in from
 
00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:51.180 align:start position:0%
superintendents just within the last
 
00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:53.160 align:start position:0%
week saying we need to keep these people
 
00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
on board that we have the main the main
 
00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
the main question was why was it late
 
00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
you explained that
 
00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:01.800 align:start position:0%
and the committee came out with
 
00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:05.160 align:start position:0%
recommendations on on November 29 those
 
00:42:07.310 --> 00:42:07.320 align:start position:0%
were interim recommendations as some of
 
00:42:10.010 --> 00:42:10.020 align:start position:0%
our members are no longer with us in the
 
00:42:13.310 --> 00:42:13.320 align:start position:0%
Senate and unfortunately so we went
 
00:42:14.329 --> 00:42:14.339 align:start position:0%
ahead and made the interim
 
00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:17.160 align:start position:0%
recommendations and this is part of the
 
00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:23.450 --> 00:42:23.460 align:start position:0%
motion motion
 
00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'd uh moved to Grant
 
00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:29.160 align:start position:0%
the late filing uh and just to speak
 
00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
briefly to my motion I thank chairman
 
00:42:32.930 --> 00:42:32.940 align:start position:0%
Ladd for bringing this information
 
00:42:34.849 --> 00:42:34.859 align:start position:0%
before this committee and before the
 
00:42:34.859 --> 00:42:35.630 align:start position:0%
before this committee and before the
house

00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:35.640 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
and I think we're all aware of the
 
00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:39.300 align:start position:0%
critical shortage of teachers in New
 
00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire especially in our special
 
00:42:43.849 --> 00:42:43.859 align:start position:0%
needs and fact programs so I thank the
 
00:42:46.310 --> 00:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
member for bringing this forward thank
 
00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr a second Ben Smith
 
00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:49.670 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr a second Ben Smith
seconds

00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
seconds
 
00:42:55.550 --> 00:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:58.490 --> 00:42:58.500 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned about doing this on the
 
00:43:01.490 --> 00:43:01.500 align:start position:0%
basis of the content because that's not
 
00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
how we make our decisions here but
 
00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:06.050 align:start position:0%
how we make our decisions here but
um

00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:06.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
and part of me wants to say gee there
 
00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
are 100 education bills that this can be
 
00:43:13.130 --> 00:43:13.140 align:start position:0%
attached to but I I am well aware of the
 
00:43:14.569 --> 00:43:14.579 align:start position:0%
fact that I said that that wasn't a
 
00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
great way to go before but what I am
 
00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
remembering is and what I discussed
 
00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
actually with the clerk prior to this uh
 
00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:26.220 align:start position:0%
meeting was that we have often had in
 
00:43:29.210 --> 00:43:29.220 align:start position:0%
the past a blanket motion that covers
 
00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
the statutory and study committees that
 
00:43:33.609 --> 00:43:33.619 align:start position:0%
are caught in just this squeeze
 
00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:37.500 align:start position:0%
and if actually if we thought there were
 
00:43:40.010 --> 00:43:40.020 align:start position:0%
more statutory and study committees
 
00:43:42.530 --> 00:43:42.540 align:start position:0%
there are caught in this squeeze I would
 
00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:45.060 align:start position:0%
ask to amend the motion that any of them
 
00:43:47.210 --> 00:43:47.220 align:start position:0%
that have reported late
 
00:43:50.990 --> 00:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
that have a majority report that
 
00:43:53.930 --> 00:43:53.940 align:start position:0%
requests legislation I think that's the
 
00:43:56.089 --> 00:43:56.099 align:start position:0%
way we worded it the last time
 
00:43:58.550 --> 00:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
that that they'd be allowed late
 
00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:00.300 align:start position:0%
drafting so that we didn't have to do
 
00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:02.220 align:start position:0%
them one by one although the clerk said
 
00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:03.720 align:start position:0%
to me that he didn't think that there
 
00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:06.660 align:start position:0%
were a lot of committees in that
 
00:44:10.309 --> 00:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
position because most of them have ended
 
00:44:10.319 --> 00:44:11.870 align:start position:0%
position because most of them have ended
but

00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:11.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
um you know I would I would I would be
 
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
open to a um a more
 
00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:19.670 align:start position:0%
open to a um a more
blanket

00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
blanket
 
00:44:22.150 --> 00:44:22.160 align:start position:0%
permission for late drafting for
 
00:44:24.890 --> 00:44:24.900 align:start position:0%
legislation arriving out of the majority
 
00:44:26.450 --> 00:44:26.460 align:start position:0%
report of a study committee or
 
00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:28.550 align:start position:0%
report of a study committee or
Commission

00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
um but I'm I'm going to vote for this
 
00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:40.190 --> 00:44:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:43.069 --> 00:44:43.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:45.109 --> 00:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
so just so I'm clear there's a statutory
 
00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
study commission that had a report out
 
00:44:51.109 --> 00:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
Dave that was late than what we normally
 
00:44:52.730 --> 00:44:52.740 align:start position:0%
allow what did the committee just to
 
00:44:55.550 --> 00:44:55.560 align:start position:0%
report late the the committee's due date
 
00:44:58.250 --> 00:44:58.260 align:start position:0%
is November 2023.
 
00:45:01.730 --> 00:45:01.740 align:start position:0%
so we are not completed our tasks
 
00:45:03.890 --> 00:45:03.900 align:start position:0%
however we're at that point now where we
 
00:45:06.530 --> 00:45:06.540 align:start position:0%
have this data that's
 
00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
there's a need out there for continuity
 
00:45:11.329 --> 00:45:11.339 align:start position:0%
in the schools for our students uh and
 
00:45:13.970 --> 00:45:13.980 align:start position:0%
so it was the decision of the committee
 
00:45:16.970 --> 00:45:16.980 align:start position:0%
to make an interim recommendations and
 
00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
continue with our work and there is much
 
00:45:22.670 --> 00:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
work to be done in terms of some of our
 
00:45:24.829 --> 00:45:24.839 align:start position:0%
Rural and City districts in terms of
 
00:45:27.290 --> 00:45:27.300 align:start position:0%
incentive grants so there's a whole lot
 
00:45:28.609 --> 00:45:28.619 align:start position:0%
of work which we have ahead of us
 
00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
however this particular can be handled
 
00:45:33.109 --> 00:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
right now we have people in this
 
00:45:36.250 --> 00:45:36.260 align:start position:0%
situation and it's felt that it's best
 
00:45:38.930 --> 00:45:38.940 align:start position:0%
dealt with immediately rather than
 
00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:48.829 --> 00:45:48.839 align:start position:0%
no further discussion clerical color all
 
00:45:50.930 --> 00:45:50.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair the motion is to
 
00:45:53.089 --> 00:45:53.099 align:start position:0%

good morning Mr Speaker and members of
 
00:46:33.770 --> 00:46:33.780 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:46:36.650 --> 00:46:36.660 align:start position:0%
um I elect several people before me uh
 
00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
thought that the deadline for filing was
 
00:46:41.569 --> 00:46:41.579 align:start position:0%
on four o'clock and I had filed another
 
00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
bill earlier that morning and I was
 
00:46:46.309 --> 00:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
rounding up co-sponsors for this bill
 
00:46:49.130 --> 00:46:49.140 align:start position:0%
and when I had done that I submitted
 
00:46:52.490 --> 00:46:52.500 align:start position:0%
mine at 1 14 and it was in
 
00:46:55.970 --> 00:46:55.980 align:start position:0%
and I had no misinformation I except for
 
00:46:57.710 --> 00:46:57.720 align:start position:0%
my own misunderstanding that the
 
00:46:59.410 --> 00:46:59.420 align:start position:0%
deadline was at four
 
00:47:03.170 --> 00:47:03.180 align:start position:0%
and I this is a bill for an independent
 
00:47:04.670 --> 00:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
redistricting committee I'm on the
 
00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
election law committee it's one that we
 
00:47:08.089 --> 00:47:08.099 align:start position:0%
had as a priority
 
00:47:13.069 --> 00:47:13.079 align:start position:0%
so I'm here asking for your I guess
 
00:47:15.710 --> 00:47:15.720 align:start position:0%
Mercy to allow us to find that file this
 
00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:16.490 align:start position:0%
Mercy to allow us to find that file this
bill

00:47:16.490 --> 00:47:16.500 align:start position:0%

00:47:21.530 --> 00:47:21.540 align:start position:0%

00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:31.190 align:start position:0%
 
questions

00:47:31.190 --> 00:47:31.200 align:start position:0%

Jim Smith

fall since redistricting is not imminent
 
00:47:42.349 --> 00:47:42.359 align:start position:0%
we'd like to get it out there and study
 
00:47:43.550 --> 00:47:43.560 align:start position:0%
it and might Define some more
 
00:47:45.829 --> 00:47:45.839 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors but yes it can be followed
 
00:47:50.690 --> 00:47:50.700 align:start position:0%

00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
a Mr chair my understanding was

represented Weiler was not going to be
 
00:50:13.550 --> 00:50:13.560 align:start position:0%
here but representative Smith was going
 
00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
to be making the motion on his behalf or
 
00:50:24.650 --> 00:50:24.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:24.660 --> 00:50:29.690 align:start position:0%

00:50:40.190 --> 00:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:43.730 align:start position:0%
 
second

00:50:43.730 --> 00:50:43.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:47.329 --> 00:50:47.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:50.809 --> 00:50:50.819 align:start position:0%
Senator Weber is there any reason not to
 
00:50:52.609 --> 00:50:52.619 align:start position:0%
amend the motion to include House Bill
 
00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:55.020 align:start position:0%
25 as well
 
00:50:57.170 --> 00:50:57.180 align:start position:0%
I don't think so I think that
 
00:50:59.750 --> 00:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
I I if that you would accept that as a
 
00:51:01.490 --> 00:51:01.500 align:start position:0%
friendly amendment I would move that we
 
00:51:03.530 --> 00:51:03.540 align:start position:0%
allow all three and just get them done
 
00:51:05.329 --> 00:51:05.339 align:start position:0%
as a package
 
00:51:10.130 --> 00:51:10.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:10.140 --> 00:51:13.010 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:51:13.010 --> 00:51:13.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:15.530 --> 00:51:15.540 align:start position:0%
clerk we'll clarify the motion and call
 
00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
the roll uh thank you Mr chair the
 
00:51:20.450 --> 00:51:20.460 align:start position:0%
motion is to allow for late Drafting and
 
00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
introduction of House Bill 1 2 and 25.
 
00:51:25.250 --> 00:51:25.260 align:start position:0%

evil yes motion passes nine to zero Mr
 
00:51:41.930 --> 00:51:41.940 align:start position:0%
chair the only reason uh they were
 
00:51:43.370 --> 00:51:43.380 align:start position:0%
scheduled separately is because
 
00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:45.480 align:start position:0%
representative McConkey is here so that
 
00:51:47.210 --> 00:51:47.220 align:start position:0%
was he was going to make the
 
00:51:48.890 --> 00:51:48.900 align:start position:0%
introduction but that's perfectly
 
00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:50.329 align:start position:0%
introduction but that's perfectly
acceptable

00:51:50.329 --> 00:51:50.339 align:start position:0%
acceptable
 
00:51:52.790 --> 00:51:52.800 align:start position:0%

00:52:03.230 --> 00:52:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:08.990 align:start position:0%

00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:20.089 align:start position:0%
this is in no particular order
um

00:52:20.089 --> 00:52:20.099 align:start position:0%

actually to protect each caucus from
 
00:53:06.660 --> 00:53:07.849 align:start position:0%
actually to protect each caucus from
themselves

00:53:07.849 --> 00:53:07.859 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
00:53:10.130 --> 00:53:10.140 align:start position:0%
so that depending on attendance on any

representative Sweeney representative
 
00:54:25.609 --> 00:54:25.619 align:start position:0%
Cheryl I'm representative Smith
 
00:54:27.890 --> 00:54:27.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker um there's a lot of
 
00:54:29.270 --> 00:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
language to accomplish something really
 
00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:30.230 align:start position:0%
language to accomplish something really
simple

00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
simple
 
00:54:32.569 --> 00:54:32.579 align:start position:0%
that exit normally the executive
 
00:54:34.730 --> 00:54:34.740 align:start position:0%
sessions will be put for a specific date
 
00:54:37.130 --> 00:54:37.140 align:start position:0%
and time on a calendar
 
00:54:40.370 --> 00:54:40.380 align:start position:0%
if you can do them as a package the
 
00:54:44.030 --> 00:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
committee will exec these eight bills at
 
00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
1 pm that's fine and that's normal
 
00:54:49.549 --> 00:54:49.559 align:start position:0%
um if the chair
 
00:54:52.910 --> 00:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
and the uh ranking member as designated
 
00:54:55.370 --> 00:54:55.380 align:start position:0%
by the minority leader agree and they
 
00:54:57.470 --> 00:54:57.480 align:start position:0%
have a gap in their schedule they can
 
00:54:59.650 --> 00:54:59.660 align:start position:0%
pick off some that were not done
 
00:55:01.910 --> 00:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
normally we put language on the calendar
 
00:55:04.730 --> 00:55:04.740 align:start position:0%
to allow executive sessions throughout
 
00:55:06.349 --> 00:55:06.359 align:start position:0%
the day
 
00:55:08.750 --> 00:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
the point of having the concurrence of
 
00:55:10.309 --> 00:55:10.319 align:start position:0%
the chair and the ranking member I
 
00:55:12.170 --> 00:55:12.180 align:start position:0%
thought it was practice I always did it
 
00:55:14.630 --> 00:55:14.640 align:start position:0%
but this way we established it as policy
 
00:55:16.609 --> 00:55:16.619 align:start position:0%
that you don't pull a fast one on either
 
00:55:16.619 --> 00:55:17.569 align:start position:0%
that you don't pull a fast one on either
side

00:55:17.569 --> 00:55:17.579 align:start position:0%
side
 
00:55:19.309 --> 00:55:19.319 align:start position:0%
and hopefully they can pick off their
 
00:55:21.290 --> 00:55:21.300 align:start position:0%
work out of the calendar
 
00:55:23.750 --> 00:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:30.910 align:start position:0%

I have to speak yeah
 
01:00:31.130 --> 01:00:31.140 align:start position:0%
we need a motion first
 
01:00:33.049 --> 01:00:33.059 align:start position:0%

01:00:33.059 --> 01:00:36.309 align:start position:0%
yes Mr Speaker I moved to adopt the
amendment

01:00:36.309 --> 01:00:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:38.329 --> 01:00:38.339 align:start position:0%
first of all I
 
01:00:41.150 --> 01:00:41.160 align:start position:0%
I'm sure it was right you need to
 
01:00:54.349 --> 01:00:54.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:56.329 --> 01:00:56.339 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker and fellow members
 
01:00:57.829 --> 01:00:57.839 align:start position:0%
of the rules committee today
 
01:00:59.750 --> 01:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
um as previous rules that we've adopted
 
01:01:01.789 --> 01:01:01.799 align:start position:0%
already uh amendments we've adopted
 
01:01:04.490 --> 01:01:04.500 align:start position:0%
already today uh the basis for this is
 
01:01:07.309 --> 01:01:07.319 align:start position:0%
really a house floor stability rule uh
 
01:01:09.589 --> 01:01:09.599 align:start position:0%
this is to make sure that when in the
 
01:01:11.930 --> 01:01:11.940 align:start position:0%
scenario a committee is divided evenly
 
01:01:14.450 --> 01:01:14.460 align:start position:0%
between them which uh I would expect
 
01:01:16.789 --> 01:01:16.799 align:start position:0%
we'll see more of this upcoming session
 
01:01:19.130 --> 01:01:19.140 align:start position:0%
uh that the first motion that the house
 
01:01:21.170 --> 01:01:21.180 align:start position:0%
will consider will be coming from the
 
01:01:23.329 --> 01:01:23.339 align:start position:0%
chair or the vice chair if the chair is
 
01:01:25.849 --> 01:01:25.859 align:start position:0%
absent on the floor of the house and
 
01:01:29.569 --> 01:01:29.579 align:start position:0%
that's that's my motion
 
01:01:29.579 --> 01:01:33.010 align:start position:0%
that's that's my motion
foreign

01:01:33.010 --> 01:01:33.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:37.190 --> 01:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:40.670 --> 01:01:40.680 align:start position:0%
Mr clerk is it in basins that our our
 
01:01:43.190 --> 01:01:43.200 align:start position:0%
practice and procedures though when the
 
01:01:44.990 --> 01:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
Committees are tie that this positive
 
01:01:47.809 --> 01:01:47.819 align:start position:0%
motion should come to the floor
 
01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question uh the the
 
01:01:53.030 --> 01:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
situation is that this the two
 
01:01:56.210 --> 01:01:56.220 align:start position:0%
statements uh regarding what the the two
 
01:01:58.010 --> 01:01:58.020 align:start position:0%
positions out of the committee were
 
01:02:00.530 --> 01:02:00.540 align:start position:0%
would be printed in the house calendar
 
01:02:03.170 --> 01:02:03.180 align:start position:0%
excuse me however our practice and
 
01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
precedent is that the positive motion is
 
01:02:08.750 --> 01:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
considered first on the house floor
 
01:02:18.710 --> 01:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:21.410 --> 01:02:21.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um briefly I'm I'm
 
01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
going to vote against this motion
 
01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
um many of us in this chamber including
 
01:02:28.849 --> 01:02:28.859 align:start position:0%
you Mr Speaker have a great deal of
 
01:02:30.910 --> 01:02:30.920 align:start position:0%
respect for our practices and precedence
 
01:02:35.089 --> 01:02:35.099 align:start position:0%
in the traditions of this institution uh
 
01:02:38.030 --> 01:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
we have always brought in my 19 years
 
01:02:40.910 --> 01:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
now in the house uh just positive motion
 
01:02:42.470 --> 01:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
to the floor when the committee is tied
 
01:02:45.829 --> 01:02:45.839 align:start position:0%
in a vote is the first item taken up is
 
01:02:47.390 --> 01:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
something that we have always done we
 
01:02:50.510 --> 01:02:50.520 align:start position:0%
take pride in that I think we should
 
01:02:52.010 --> 01:02:52.020 align:start position:0%
continue with that practice and
 
01:02:54.770 --> 01:02:54.780 align:start position:0%
precedent in honor of this house and the
 
01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
people who have served before us and
 
01:02:58.309 --> 01:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
have carried on that tradition so I will
 
01:03:00.470 --> 01:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
be voting no no in the motion thank you
 
01:03:04.910 --> 01:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:07.309 --> 01:03:07.319 align:start position:0%
John Weber
 
01:03:10.010 --> 01:03:10.020 align:start position:0%
I too very much disagree with this
 
01:03:12.710 --> 01:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
motion and will be voting against it and
 
01:03:14.930 --> 01:03:14.940 align:start position:0%
that's because these are committee
 
01:03:14.940 --> 01:03:16.490 align:start position:0%
that's because these are committee
reports

01:03:16.490 --> 01:03:16.500 align:start position:0%
reports
 
01:03:18.170 --> 01:03:18.180 align:start position:0%
and they are the report of the whole
 
01:03:20.870 --> 01:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
committee not the report of the chair of
 
01:03:22.430 --> 01:03:22.440 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:03:25.670 --> 01:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
and I believe that when a committee is
 
01:03:28.490 --> 01:03:28.500 align:start position:0%
divided there's good reason for it
 
01:03:30.589 --> 01:03:30.599 align:start position:0%
because the good arguments on both sides
 
01:03:33.170 --> 01:03:33.180 align:start position:0%
and as the clerk has told us we put both
 
01:03:35.809 --> 01:03:35.819 align:start position:0%
of those reports in the calendar
 
01:03:35.819 --> 01:03:38.109 align:start position:0%
of those reports in the calendar
and

01:03:38.109 --> 01:03:38.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:03:42.609 --> 01:03:42.619 align:start position:0%
if we allow the chair of the committee
 
01:03:46.089 --> 01:03:46.099 align:start position:0%
to decide which motion gets made first
 
01:03:49.190 --> 01:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
we negate the work of everybody else on
 
01:03:50.390 --> 01:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
that committee
 
01:03:54.349 --> 01:03:54.359 align:start position:0%
and I think it's a very unwise motion
 
01:03:57.589 --> 01:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
for us to take if we continue always
 
01:04:01.990 --> 01:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
taking the positive motion first
 
01:04:05.829 --> 01:04:05.839 align:start position:0%
then they are divided randomly between
 
01:04:08.870 --> 01:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
those that want the bill to pass and
 
01:04:10.670 --> 01:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
those that don't want the bill to pass
 
01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
that's an even division it's an equal
 
01:04:16.430 --> 01:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity for each build a stand or
 
01:04:19.789 --> 01:04:19.799 align:start position:0%
fail on its own merits and I think it
 
01:04:22.010 --> 01:04:22.020 align:start position:0%
would be a very sad day for this house
 
01:04:25.569 --> 01:04:25.579 align:start position:0%
if we voted to allow the committee chair
 
01:04:28.670 --> 01:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
to take over the work of the entire
 
01:04:35.569 --> 01:04:35.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:37.309 --> 01:04:37.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker I just want to
 
01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:39.720 align:start position:0%
address the past practice and precedent
 
01:04:42.230 --> 01:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
issue amazingly I think I've served
 
01:04:44.690 --> 01:04:44.700 align:start position:0%
under seven speakers and I specifically
 
01:04:47.210 --> 01:04:47.220 align:start position:0%
recall three of them on the house floor
 
01:04:49.970 --> 01:04:49.980 align:start position:0%
setting new precedent unilaterally one
 
01:04:51.829 --> 01:04:51.839 align:start position:0%
of them actually explicitly stated so
 
01:04:54.109 --> 01:04:54.119 align:start position:0%
our sources of authority practice
 
01:04:56.930 --> 01:04:56.940 align:start position:0%
practice and precedent are below house
 
01:04:58.849 --> 01:04:58.859 align:start position:0%
rules so if we're going to do something
 
01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
different it's changing the house rule
 
01:05:03.289 --> 01:05:03.299 align:start position:0%
is the proper way to do it so I don't
 
01:05:05.150 --> 01:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
have any objection based on that
 
01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:10.549 align:start position:0%
have any objection based on that
argument

01:05:10.549 --> 01:05:10.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:10.559 --> 01:05:14.510 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:05:14.510 --> 01:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:16.970 --> 01:05:16.980 align:start position:0%
I don't think we've we've ever had a
 
01:05:20.030 --> 01:05:20.040 align:start position:0%
situation where we have had more than
 
01:05:22.730 --> 01:05:22.740 align:start position:0%
one or two no recommendations out of
 
01:05:25.190 --> 01:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
committees in an entire year we're
 
01:05:27.109 --> 01:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
looking forward to two years of having
 
01:05:31.130 --> 01:05:31.140 align:start position:0%
probably you know 150 per year and every
 
01:05:32.690 --> 01:05:32.700 align:start position:0%
single one of those
 
01:05:34.609 --> 01:05:34.619 align:start position:0%
um has the
 
01:05:34.619 --> 01:05:36.650 align:start position:0%
um has the
uh

01:05:36.650 --> 01:05:36.660 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
likelihood of having to go through
 
01:05:40.730 --> 01:05:40.740 align:start position:0%
multiple roll calls
 
01:05:42.650 --> 01:05:42.660 align:start position:0%
um and it's going to take up a lot of
 
01:05:44.930 --> 01:05:44.940 align:start position:0%
time every single session day so I don't
 
01:05:47.569 --> 01:05:47.579 align:start position:0%
know that this proposal is necessarily
 
01:05:50.089 --> 01:05:50.099 align:start position:0%
the the greatest solution to that but I
 
01:05:51.710 --> 01:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
think we should probably come up with
 
01:05:55.010 --> 01:05:55.020 align:start position:0%
some solution
 
01:05:58.609 --> 01:05:58.619 align:start position:0%
um maybe it's uh that the prevailing
 
01:06:02.329 --> 01:06:02.339 align:start position:0%
motion is itl rather than OTP or uh or
 
01:06:04.250 --> 01:06:04.260 align:start position:0%
there are some other mechanism of of
 
01:06:07.549 --> 01:06:07.559 align:start position:0%
selecting the motion that is most likely
 
01:06:11.569 --> 01:06:11.579 align:start position:0%
to Prevail on that day at that time and
 
01:06:13.490 --> 01:06:13.500 align:start position:0%
uh I'd be open to
 
01:06:16.010 --> 01:06:16.020 align:start position:0%
um to any other suggestions but I think
 
01:06:23.569 --> 01:06:23.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:25.789 --> 01:06:25.799 align:start position:0%
I think that's my concern
 
01:06:27.710 --> 01:06:27.720 align:start position:0%
is that we've never been in this
 
01:06:29.809 --> 01:06:29.819 align:start position:0%
position before
 
01:06:32.329 --> 01:06:32.339 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
01:06:35.690 --> 01:06:35.700 align:start position:0%
is this the answer I'm not sure but I
 
01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
agree with the majority leader
 
01:06:40.430 --> 01:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
that something
 
01:06:42.410 --> 01:06:42.420 align:start position:0%
we need to we need to come up with
 
01:06:44.450 --> 01:06:44.460 align:start position:0%
something that's fair to both sides if
 
01:06:46.789 --> 01:06:46.799 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a number of no
 
01:06:46.799 --> 01:06:48.349 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a number of no
recommendations

01:06:48.349 --> 01:06:48.359 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
01:06:48.359 --> 01:06:49.970 align:start position:0%
recommendations
and

01:06:49.970 --> 01:06:49.980 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:06:52.609 --> 01:06:52.619 align:start position:0%
just always going forward with the auto
 
01:06:55.730 --> 01:06:55.740 align:start position:0%
pass motion I I think I think it's
 
01:06:57.410 --> 01:06:57.420 align:start position:0%
unfair for
 
01:07:00.650 --> 01:07:00.660 align:start position:0%
either either one of the bodies
 
01:07:03.890 --> 01:07:03.900 align:start position:0%
Senator Charlie uh Mr chairman I can see
 
01:07:03.900 --> 01:07:05.210 align:start position:0%
Senator Charlie uh Mr chairman I can see
where

01:07:05.210 --> 01:07:05.220 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:07:07.670 --> 01:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
you genuinely feel a dilemma over this
 
01:07:09.890 --> 01:07:09.900 align:start position:0%
situation and I think it's something
 
01:07:11.870 --> 01:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
that the house should discuss with a
 
01:07:13.789 --> 01:07:13.799 align:start position:0%
motion to table this amendment be in
 
01:07:13.799 --> 01:07:15.589 align:start position:0%
motion to table this amendment be in
order

01:07:15.589 --> 01:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
order
 
01:07:18.049 --> 01:07:18.059 align:start position:0%
uh no representative but we can't table
 
01:07:20.450 --> 01:07:20.460 align:start position:0%
in committee you can not recommend it or
 
01:07:24.049 --> 01:07:24.059 align:start position:0%
recommend it and it could certainly come
 
01:07:25.789 --> 01:07:25.799 align:start position:0%
as a floor Amendment as any amendment
 
01:07:28.910 --> 01:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
can on January 4th since the bill cannot
 
01:07:30.890 --> 01:07:30.900 align:start position:0%
the amendment cannot be tabled and there
 
01:07:33.109 --> 01:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
are questions I would ask the committee
 
01:07:35.630 --> 01:07:35.640 align:start position:0%
to vote against it and let some of us
 
01:07:38.690 --> 01:07:38.700 align:start position:0%
talk as many as possible and look at the
 
01:07:41.270 --> 01:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
different scenarios but devote for
 
01:07:43.370 --> 01:07:43.380 align:start position:0%
something because we don't know what the
 
01:07:45.490 --> 01:07:45.500 align:start position:0%
future is going to be hold for this body
 
01:07:47.930 --> 01:07:47.940 align:start position:0%
I just don't think is inappropriate
 
01:07:49.849 --> 01:07:49.859 align:start position:0%
especially by after the comments by the
 
01:07:52.250 --> 01:07:52.260 align:start position:0%
majority leader and the speaker having
 
01:07:55.789 --> 01:07:55.799 align:start position:0%
concerns I think we should not act in
 
01:07:57.650 --> 01:07:57.660 align:start position:0%
haste and pass something and I'd ask the
 
01:07:59.450 --> 01:07:59.460 align:start position:0%
committee to vote no on the amendment
 
01:08:02.089 --> 01:08:02.099 align:start position:0%
the just to clarify if representative
 
01:08:03.710 --> 01:08:03.720 align:start position:0%
Sweeney wished to withdraw his Amendment
 
01:08:10.069 --> 01:08:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:10.079 --> 01:08:14.089 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:08:14.089 --> 01:08:14.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:15.829 --> 01:08:15.839 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:08:19.370 --> 01:08:19.380 align:start position:0%
I I do believe I do believe though that
 
01:08:21.110 --> 01:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
um we we do have to come up with a
 
01:08:22.789 --> 01:08:22.799 align:start position:0%
solution that's fair to both to both
 
01:08:22.799 --> 01:08:24.410 align:start position:0%
solution that's fair to both to both
bodies

01:08:24.410 --> 01:08:24.420 align:start position:0%
bodies
 
01:08:24.420 --> 01:08:25.249 align:start position:0%
bodies
um

01:08:25.249 --> 01:08:25.259 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:26.510 --> 01:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker
 
01:08:28.610 --> 01:08:28.620 align:start position:0%
I I was just going to comment Before the
 
01:08:30.829 --> 01:08:30.839 align:start position:0%
bill was withdrawn that I think
 
01:08:32.809 --> 01:08:32.819 align:start position:0%
traditionally we always have a couple of
 
01:08:34.550 --> 01:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
relatively light days on our first
 
01:08:37.070 --> 01:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
couple of session days and I think that
 
01:08:39.349 --> 01:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
will allow us to see whether the time
 
01:08:41.689 --> 01:08:41.699 align:start position:0%
issues really are there
 
01:08:45.590 --> 01:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
or are not there but I I hope that
 
01:08:47.930 --> 01:08:47.940 align:start position:0%
whatever solution has come up with
 
01:08:51.530 --> 01:08:51.540 align:start position:0%
uh it may be a a problem in a solution
 
01:08:53.269 --> 01:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
in search of a problem but if if it
 
01:08:56.289 --> 01:08:56.299 align:start position:0%
becomes a problem I I think we need to
 
01:08:59.209 --> 01:08:59.219 align:start position:0%
uh come up with a solution that honors
 
01:09:01.249 --> 01:09:01.259 align:start position:0%
the work of the entire committee and
 
01:09:03.769 --> 01:09:03.779 align:start position:0%
does not simply delegate to the chair
 
01:09:05.590 --> 01:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
that which was
 
01:09:08.030 --> 01:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
handed to an entire committee for a
 
01:09:10.669 --> 01:09:10.679 align:start position:0%
resolution thank you yeah I think I I
 
01:09:12.349 --> 01:09:12.359 align:start position:0%
think yeah having put this one aside
 
01:09:15.650 --> 01:09:15.660 align:start position:0%
representative Weber uh
 
01:09:17.570 --> 01:09:17.580 align:start position:0%
I don't know what the solution is
 
01:09:20.809 --> 01:09:20.819 align:start position:0%
offhand but I think it's it's fair it's
 
01:09:22.550 --> 01:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
only fair for both bodies that we come
 
01:09:24.050 --> 01:09:24.060 align:start position:0%
up with some solution
 
01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
that uh doesn't penalize either one of
 
01:09:29.930 --> 01:09:29.940 align:start position:0%
our bodies uh would always happen to be
 
01:09:32.450 --> 01:09:32.460 align:start position:0%
second you know on the motion
 
01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:34.430 align:start position:0%
second you know on the motion
so

01:09:34.430 --> 01:09:34.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:09:36.530 --> 01:09:36.540 align:start position:0%
I guess representative Wilhelm you and I
 
01:09:39.010 --> 01:09:39.020 align:start position:0%
got some work ahead of us
 
01:09:47.510 --> 01:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:50.749 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:09:50.749 --> 01:09:50.759 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:53.809 --> 01:09:53.819 align:start position:0%
is representative Stephen Pearson here I
 
01:09:56.330 --> 01:09:56.340 align:start position:0%
don't see him oh there he is they were
 
01:09:59.150 --> 01:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
hiding uh he is proposing an amendment
 
01:10:05.689 --> 01:10:05.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:07.970 --> 01:10:07.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker and friends and
 
01:10:12.290 --> 01:10:12.300 align:start position:0%
colleagues my proposal is to change the
 
01:10:15.770 --> 01:10:15.780 align:start position:0%
threshold to remove a bill from consent
 
01:10:18.650 --> 01:10:18.660 align:start position:0%
from one member to three members
 
01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
three members does not even represent
 
01:10:24.050 --> 01:10:24.060 align:start position:0%
one percent of our body
 
01:10:27.830 --> 01:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
the purpose of my Amendment
 
01:10:32.209 --> 01:10:32.219 align:start position:0%
is to do two things one my understanding
 
01:10:35.330 --> 01:10:35.340 align:start position:0%
of the purpose of removing a bill from
 
01:10:38.330 --> 01:10:38.340 align:start position:0%
consent is because there was either new
 
01:10:40.669 --> 01:10:40.679 align:start position:0%
information brought to light or
 
01:10:44.030 --> 01:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
circumstances has have changed in a fair
 
01:10:45.530 --> 01:10:45.540 align:start position:0%
and reasonable argument could be made on
 
01:10:47.450 --> 01:10:47.460 align:start position:0%
the floor of the houses is to the
 
01:10:51.229 --> 01:10:51.239 align:start position:0%
content of that change in in fact
 
01:10:55.430 --> 01:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
overturn the opinion of the committee
 
01:10:57.110 --> 01:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
that put it on consent
 
01:11:01.550 --> 01:11:01.560 align:start position:0%
in my two terms in the house I have seen
 
01:11:04.310 --> 01:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
this you weaponized it has been used
 
01:11:07.010 --> 01:11:07.020 align:start position:0%
when members were upset that their bills
 
01:11:11.510 --> 01:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
were put on killed on consent it has
 
01:11:14.630 --> 01:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
been used to grandstand for speech
 
01:11:18.290 --> 01:11:18.300 align:start position:0%
purposes and in a divided house that is
 
01:11:19.970 --> 01:11:19.980 align:start position:0%
nearly tied
 
01:11:22.010 --> 01:11:22.020 align:start position:0%
I don't think that we have the time for
 
01:11:23.570 --> 01:11:23.580 align:start position:0%
that now
 
01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
the threshold of three is not a
 
01:11:28.790 --> 01:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
Monumental mountain to climb at all if
 
01:11:32.930 --> 01:11:32.940 align:start position:0%
something is is legitimately uh
 
01:11:35.990 --> 01:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
legitimately needed to be removed
 
01:11:38.270 --> 01:11:38.280 align:start position:0%
to find two other members to agree with
 
01:11:39.530 --> 01:11:39.540 align:start position:0%
your position should not be that
 
01:11:39.540 --> 01:11:41.209 align:start position:0%
your position should not be that
difficult

01:11:41.209 --> 01:11:41.219 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
01:11:43.430 --> 01:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
so that is the purpose of my Amendment
 
01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:44.990 align:start position:0%
so that is the purpose of my Amendment
and

01:11:44.990 --> 01:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:45.649 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:11:45.649 --> 01:11:45.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:48.229 --> 01:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
I'm asking for your support thank you
 
01:11:50.630 --> 01:11:50.640 align:start position:0%
motion of Charlotte
 
01:11:52.669 --> 01:11:52.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'd move to accept
 
01:11:55.370 --> 01:11:55.380 align:start position:0%
the amendment and just to speak briefly
 
01:11:58.070 --> 01:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
to my emotion I think the uh Majority
 
01:12:01.430 --> 01:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
Leader spoke eloquently earlier when he
 
01:12:03.649 --> 01:12:03.659 align:start position:0%
alluded to the fact the time is going to
 
01:12:05.270 --> 01:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
be of the essence in the upcoming
 
01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:06.229 align:start position:0%
be of the essence in the upcoming
session

01:12:06.229 --> 01:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:12:08.689 --> 01:12:08.699 align:start position:0%
and as the sponsor has said and I know
 
01:12:10.669 --> 01:12:10.679 align:start position:0%
you've seen him Mr Speaker as have I
 
01:12:12.709 --> 01:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
there have been times in the history of
 
01:12:14.270 --> 01:12:14.280 align:start position:0%
the house where members have taken
 
01:12:16.910 --> 01:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
builds off consent for the simple reason
 
01:12:19.790 --> 01:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
to be punitive to the whole body and I
 
01:12:21.709 --> 01:12:21.719 align:start position:0%
think to ask for two additional members
 
01:12:24.530 --> 01:12:24.540 align:start position:0%
to agree to take a bill of consent is
 
01:12:26.330 --> 01:12:26.340 align:start position:0%
not that big a hurdle when I think it
 
01:12:28.490 --> 01:12:28.500 align:start position:0%
this amendment has Merit and I'd ask
 
01:12:31.610 --> 01:12:31.620 align:start position:0%
your support thank you Mr chair we have
 
01:12:35.810 --> 01:12:35.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:40.250 align:start position:0%
 
second

01:12:40.250 --> 01:12:40.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:46.130 --> 01:12:46.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:48.169 --> 01:12:48.179 align:start position:0%
of Osborne
 
01:12:50.810 --> 01:12:50.820 align:start position:0%
um so I gotta tell you I like this idea
 
01:12:53.330 --> 01:12:53.340 align:start position:0%
in fact I wish it were a larger number
 
01:12:56.209 --> 01:12:56.219 align:start position:0%
maybe like 50 or so
 
01:12:57.649 --> 01:12:57.659 align:start position:0%
um but you know that's my personal
 
01:12:59.689 --> 01:12:59.699 align:start position:0%
opinion I do think there should be a
 
01:13:02.330 --> 01:13:02.340 align:start position:0%
much higher bar to bring business to the
 
01:13:04.790 --> 01:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
floor of the house and take up 400
 
01:13:06.890 --> 01:13:06.900 align:start position:0%
people's time
 
01:13:06.900 --> 01:13:08.030 align:start position:0%
people's time
um

01:13:08.030 --> 01:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:11.689 --> 01:13:11.699 align:start position:0%
I I worry that uh
 
01:13:13.010 --> 01:13:13.020 align:start position:0%
you know it's called the consent
 
01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
calendar for a reason that uh you know
 
01:13:17.689 --> 01:13:17.699 align:start position:0%
people you know we are consenting to it
 
01:13:20.930 --> 01:13:20.940 align:start position:0%
and requiring uh an extra two people I
 
01:13:23.450 --> 01:13:23.460 align:start position:0%
don't know that that's
 
01:13:27.770 --> 01:13:27.780 align:start position:0%
uh necessarily right to do but I I do
 
01:13:29.870 --> 01:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
I do like the idea
 
01:13:33.669 --> 01:13:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:36.709 --> 01:13:36.719 align:start position:0%
John Wilbur
 
01:13:39.169 --> 01:13:39.179 align:start position:0%
I too was on the fence when I when I
 
01:13:42.830 --> 01:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
read this because I'm thinking about you
 
01:13:44.750 --> 01:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
know the concept of unanimous consent
 
01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
and one person withdrawing their consent
 
01:13:50.510 --> 01:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
and but as has been pointed out we have
 
01:13:52.250 --> 01:13:52.260 align:start position:0%
the right to change our rules and to
 
01:13:54.290 --> 01:13:54.300 align:start position:0%
adopt a specific rule for a specific
 
01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:55.850 align:start position:0%
adopt a specific rule for a specific
situation

01:13:55.850 --> 01:13:55.860 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:14:00.770 --> 01:14:00.780 align:start position:0%
and I think that this rule is probably a
 
01:14:03.290 --> 01:14:03.300 align:start position:0%
good idea for specific situation so I'm
 
01:14:06.229 --> 01:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
going to vote for it but I will say that
 
01:14:07.790 --> 01:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
there there have been times when
 
01:14:09.590 --> 01:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
committees have just gotten things flat
 
01:14:12.649 --> 01:14:12.659 align:start position:0%
out wrong and I'm remembering uh the
 
01:14:15.770 --> 01:14:15.780 align:start position:0%
requirement that everybody who swam in
 
01:14:18.470 --> 01:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
Lake Winnipesaukee would be required to
 
01:14:20.750 --> 01:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
wear a red bathing cap
 
01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
which came unanimously out of committee
 
01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:24.370 align:start position:0%
which came unanimously out of committee
and

01:14:24.370 --> 01:14:24.380 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:14:27.169 --> 01:14:27.179 align:start position:0%
which became the subject of a fairly
 
01:14:30.290 --> 01:14:30.300 align:start position:0%
lengthy debate but
 
01:14:32.450 --> 01:14:32.460 align:start position:0%
um you know and they were rightly
 
01:14:34.910 --> 01:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
concerned about safety but
 
01:14:37.070 --> 01:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
you know people get to make their own
 
01:14:39.890 --> 01:14:39.900 align:start position:0%
decisions on that kind of thing anyway
 
01:14:39.900 --> 01:14:40.490 align:start position:0%
decisions on that kind of thing anyway
um

01:14:40.490 --> 01:14:40.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:42.470 --> 01:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
the more I think about it the more I
 
01:14:44.630 --> 01:14:44.640 align:start position:0%
think that three people at a minimum
 
01:14:48.050 --> 01:14:48.060 align:start position:0%
defeats the one person who is trying to
 
01:14:50.090 --> 01:14:50.100 align:start position:0%
make a point and hold a stall hostage
 
01:14:53.450 --> 01:14:53.460 align:start position:0%
which has happened in the past so I'm
 
01:14:55.370 --> 01:14:55.380 align:start position:0%
going to vote for it
 
01:14:57.590 --> 01:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
01:15:01.370 --> 01:15:01.380 align:start position:0%
is my concern too is that uh
 
01:15:03.890 --> 01:15:03.900 align:start position:0%
um we could be held
 
01:15:08.870 --> 01:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
hostage very easily too many times and
 
01:15:11.390 --> 01:15:11.400 align:start position:0%
if a member can't come up with two more
 
01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
members that wants to remove a bill from
 
01:15:15.950 --> 01:15:15.960 align:start position:0%
consent for good reasons then it
 
01:15:19.970 --> 01:15:19.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:24.050 --> 01:15:24.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:26.390 --> 01:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
clerk will call a roll
 
01:15:28.970 --> 01:15:28.980 align:start position:0%
the motion is to accept the amendment
 
01:15:31.430 --> 01:15:31.440 align:start position:0%

01:16:09.890 --> 01:16:09.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative Betsy to
 
01:16:25.430 --> 01:16:25.440 align:start position:0%

this okay
 
01:16:36.470 --> 01:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
um I'm proposing a rule change

01:16:45.370 --> 01:16:45.380 align:start position:0%
um change it from prayer to invocation
 
01:16:47.990 --> 01:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
and the reason I'm doing that or
 
01:16:50.810 --> 01:16:50.820 align:start position:0%
requesting that is that the word
 
01:16:54.229 --> 01:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
invocation is more inclusive than the
 
01:16:57.590 --> 01:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
word prayer it also does include the
 
01:17:00.530 --> 01:17:00.540 align:start position:0%
word prayer if so chooses but it does
 
01:17:04.030 --> 01:17:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:08.209 --> 01:17:08.219 align:start position:0%
mandate that it be a prayer so I uh
 
01:17:11.149 --> 01:17:11.159 align:start position:0%
right now we have a situation in the
 
01:17:12.950 --> 01:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire where only 20
 
01:17:17.090 --> 01:17:17.100 align:start position:0%
percent of our citizens attend church on
 
01:17:19.030 --> 01:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
a regular basis
 
01:17:21.950 --> 01:17:21.960 align:start position:0%
there are a number in the younger
 
01:17:24.350 --> 01:17:24.360 align:start position:0%
generation that are not religiously
 
01:17:27.530 --> 01:17:27.540 align:start position:0%
Affiliated and I just think moving
 
01:17:30.590 --> 01:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
forward it's would be in our best
 
01:17:33.890 --> 01:17:33.900 align:start position:0%
interest and show progressiveness to
 
01:17:41.209 --> 01:17:41.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:41.219 --> 01:17:45.649 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:17:45.649 --> 01:17:45.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:47.750 --> 01:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:48.709 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

01:17:48.709 --> 01:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:51.169 --> 01:17:51.179 align:start position:0%
this proposed amendment would have
 
01:17:53.450 --> 01:17:53.460 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with eliminating the
 
01:17:56.030 --> 01:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
position of house chaplain
 
01:18:07.310 --> 01:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:10.010 --> 01:18:10.020 align:start position:0%
somebody want to make a motion
 
01:18:11.810 --> 01:18:11.820 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker I have a I have a question
 
01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:13.070 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker I have a I have a question
first

01:18:13.070 --> 01:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:18:15.050 --> 01:18:15.060 align:start position:0%
uh representative thanks for bringing
 
01:18:17.149 --> 01:18:17.159 align:start position:0%
this forward can you give some examples
 
01:18:20.689 --> 01:18:20.699 align:start position:0%
of uh aside from prayer what what might
 
01:18:24.050 --> 01:18:24.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:27.410 --> 01:18:27.420 align:start position:0%
well to me an invocation because it
 
01:18:30.410 --> 01:18:30.420 align:start position:0%
opens up our session
 
01:18:30.420 --> 01:18:31.550 align:start position:0%
opens up our session
um

01:18:31.550 --> 01:18:31.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:33.830 --> 01:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
is something that should really speak to
 
01:18:39.470 --> 01:18:39.480 align:start position:0%
us as a unifying force as a um you know
 
01:18:43.870 --> 01:18:43.880 align:start position:0%
a call for us to do our duty of that day
 
01:18:48.050 --> 01:18:48.060 align:start position:0%
to be a celebration of why we're there
 
01:18:50.330 --> 01:18:50.340 align:start position:0%
um you know to um
 
01:18:53.870 --> 01:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
uh promote policies for everybody in New
 
01:18:57.229 --> 01:18:57.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I just think that
 
01:18:57.239 --> 01:18:58.010 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I just think that
um

01:18:58.010 --> 01:18:58.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
the individuals that are chosen to come
 
01:19:03.950 --> 01:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
up and do an invocation would be given
 
01:19:06.770 --> 01:19:06.780 align:start position:0%
greater latitude in terms of what they
 
01:19:10.970 --> 01:19:10.980 align:start position:0%
want to say okay and you know some you
 
01:19:13.149 --> 01:19:13.159 align:start position:0%
know some choose to go down a religious
 
01:19:16.250 --> 01:19:16.260 align:start position:0%
line and that's fine but others may
 
01:19:20.570 --> 01:19:20.580 align:start position:0%
choose really to do more of a spiritual
 
01:19:22.370 --> 01:19:22.380 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:19:22.380 --> 01:19:23.209 align:start position:0%
um and
um

01:19:23.209 --> 01:19:23.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:27.350 --> 01:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
I'll say nature-based uh uplifting
 
01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:29.149 align:start position:0%
I'll say nature-based uh uplifting
speech

01:19:29.149 --> 01:19:29.159 align:start position:0%
speech
 
01:19:31.490 --> 01:19:31.500 align:start position:0%
um that you know does not have any
 
01:19:33.530 --> 01:19:33.540 align:start position:0%
religious connotation so I just think
 
01:19:36.350 --> 01:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
that the word invocation gives that
 
01:19:39.830 --> 01:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
Latitude to whomever the speaker chooses
 
01:19:43.250 --> 01:19:43.260 align:start position:0%
to give the um opening
 
01:19:45.590 --> 01:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
invocation for that day it's still
 
01:19:48.590 --> 01:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
certainly within the speakers
 
01:19:51.350 --> 01:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
um purview to do whatever he wants but I
 
01:19:54.050 --> 01:19:54.060 align:start position:0%
just think it gives everybody it gives
 
01:19:56.750 --> 01:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
greater latitude to those who are chosen
 
01:19:58.149 --> 01:19:58.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:20:00.890 --> 01:20:00.900 align:start position:0%
Sweeney Mr Speaker I move to reject this
 
01:20:00.900 --> 01:20:02.330 align:start position:0%
Sweeney Mr Speaker I move to reject this
amendment

01:20:02.330 --> 01:20:02.340 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:20:05.890 --> 01:20:05.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:08.630 --> 01:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
01:20:10.610 --> 01:20:10.620 align:start position:0%
is it Weber
 
01:20:13.310 --> 01:20:13.320 align:start position:0%
I just want to put on record that I I
 
01:20:16.189 --> 01:20:16.199 align:start position:0%
too am concerned I well you know the
 
01:20:18.290 --> 01:20:18.300 align:start position:0%
clerk will tell you that every year we
 
01:20:20.510 --> 01:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
have our discussion about what is
 
01:20:23.570 --> 01:20:23.580 align:start position:0%
referred to as the Quaker oath and it's
 
01:20:26.209 --> 01:20:26.219 align:start position:0%
an imprecise term unless it's in the
 
01:20:28.070 --> 01:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
Constitution I think or if not in the
 
01:20:29.990 --> 01:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
Constitution and statute so we're stuck
 
01:20:32.570 --> 01:20:32.580 align:start position:0%
with it unless we start amending
 
01:20:34.130 --> 01:20:34.140 align:start position:0%
everything but there are a number of
 
01:20:36.130 --> 01:20:36.140 align:start position:0%
places in our
 
01:20:40.970 --> 01:20:40.980 align:start position:0%
laws that we have
 
01:20:43.490 --> 01:20:43.500 align:start position:0%
in my opinion crossed the line in
 
01:20:47.510 --> 01:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
assuming uh a particular religious
 
01:20:50.510 --> 01:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
tradition over all the other religious
 
01:20:53.689 --> 01:20:53.699 align:start position:0%
Traditions or those members who choose
 
01:20:55.370 --> 01:20:55.380 align:start position:0%
not to follow a legit religious
 
01:20:58.970 --> 01:20:58.980 align:start position:0%
tradition and I think that any time that
 
01:21:01.490 --> 01:21:01.500 align:start position:0%
we can allow our language to be more
 
01:21:03.590 --> 01:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
inclusive and more acceptable of
 
01:21:05.470 --> 01:21:05.480 align:start position:0%
everybody's viewpoints
 
01:21:08.390 --> 01:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
that it is a good thing so I'm going to
 
01:21:14.229 --> 01:21:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:17.450 --> 01:21:17.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker uh as somebody who
 
01:21:19.189 --> 01:21:19.199 align:start position:0%
grew up in the church who got married in
 
01:21:20.689 --> 01:21:20.699 align:start position:0%
the church who got confirmed in the
 
01:21:22.490 --> 01:21:22.500 align:start position:0%
church who got baptized in the church
 
01:21:24.709 --> 01:21:24.719 align:start position:0%
whose kids got baptized in the church
 
01:21:27.649 --> 01:21:27.659 align:start position:0%
who uh admittedly doesn't attend church
 
01:21:29.990 --> 01:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
quite as often as I used to however I'll
 
01:21:32.930 --> 01:21:32.940 align:start position:0%
be there on Saturday evening
 
01:21:32.940 --> 01:21:34.189 align:start position:0%
be there on Saturday evening
um

01:21:34.189 --> 01:21:34.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:37.790 --> 01:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
I think this is a really uh smart move
 
01:21:40.010 --> 01:21:40.020 align:start position:0%
for the chamber I think this is you know
 
01:21:42.950 --> 01:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
this is not a slight of uh people of
 
01:21:44.770 --> 01:21:44.780 align:start position:0%
faith I certainly don't take it as that
 
01:21:47.149 --> 01:21:47.159 align:start position:0%
but it's really an effort to be more
 
01:21:49.669 --> 01:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
inclusive as the representative shared
 
01:21:52.669 --> 01:21:52.679 align:start position:0%
so I'll be voting in support of it and
 
01:21:54.050 --> 01:21:54.060 align:start position:0%
hope other members of the committee will
 
01:21:57.530 --> 01:21:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:05.570 --> 01:22:05.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:07.610 --> 01:22:07.620 align:start position:0%
clerical color roll
 
01:22:09.590 --> 01:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
but the motion is to not accept the
 
01:22:11.830 --> 01:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
amendment represent Packard yes
 
01:22:14.390 --> 01:22:14.400 align:start position:0%

Weber no representative evil no
 
01:22:34.550 --> 01:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:36.350 --> 01:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative Edwards
 
01:22:44.570 --> 01:22:44.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:46.970 --> 01:22:46.980 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:22:50.030 --> 01:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
um this is uh I'm here to represent
 
01:22:52.330 --> 01:22:52.340 align:start position:0%
um representative Andrew prout's
 
01:22:55.669 --> 01:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
Amendment here it's in my name he had a
 
01:22:58.250 --> 01:22:58.260 align:start position:0%
job I'm unemployed so that's why you get
 
01:23:00.830 --> 01:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
to talk to me today so
 
01:23:05.530 --> 01:23:05.540 align:start position:0%
um this is a rule change that imagines
 
01:23:07.750 --> 01:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh maybe
 
01:23:10.729 --> 01:23:10.739 align:start position:0%
the worst case scenario of what a
 
01:23:14.149 --> 01:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
divided house may lead us to and that is
 
01:23:16.790 --> 01:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
when it comes to unanimous consent at
 
01:23:19.729 --> 01:23:19.739 align:start position:0%
the end of the day potentially a very
 
01:23:21.189 --> 01:23:21.199 align:start position:0%
long day
 
01:23:25.570 --> 01:23:25.580 align:start position:0%
that people rise to the floor
 
01:23:29.649 --> 01:23:29.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:33.470 --> 01:23:33.480 align:start position:0%
a speech a floor speech that's intended
 
01:23:35.990 --> 01:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
to be contentions and to throw a few
 
01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:37.570 align:start position:0%
to be contentions and to throw a few
elbows

01:23:37.570 --> 01:23:37.580 align:start position:0%
elbows
 
01:23:41.510 --> 01:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
what this rule would do would be allow
 
01:23:45.350 --> 01:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
would to allow somebody to to challenge
 
01:23:48.770 --> 01:23:48.780 align:start position:0%
the con unanimous consent and it would
 
01:23:52.189 --> 01:23:52.199 align:start position:0%
require a two-thirds vote in order for
 
01:23:56.590 --> 01:23:56.600 align:start position:0%
the individual to be allowed to continue
 
01:24:01.250 --> 01:24:01.260 align:start position:0%
that would create a mutually assured
 
01:24:04.090 --> 01:24:04.100 align:start position:0%
destruction scenario where
 
01:24:07.070 --> 01:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
the speech the floor speech would need
 
01:24:11.090 --> 01:24:11.100 align:start position:0%
to be able to Garner some bipartisan
 
01:24:12.590 --> 01:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
support a significant amount of
 
01:24:15.709 --> 01:24:15.719 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support to continue and I
 
01:24:18.229 --> 01:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
think with the proper leadership from
 
01:24:22.010 --> 01:24:22.020 align:start position:0%
each of the caucus leaders that the
 
01:24:25.010 --> 01:24:25.020 align:start position:0%
discipline that this would provide would
 
01:24:28.070 --> 01:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
mean that we would still get interesting
 
01:24:30.250 --> 01:24:30.260 align:start position:0%
important relevant
 
01:24:34.270 --> 01:24:34.280 align:start position:0%
unanimous consent speeches before us
 
01:24:37.490 --> 01:24:37.500 align:start position:0%
but it may
 
01:24:41.330 --> 01:24:41.340 align:start position:0%
it is intended to prevent those who
 
01:24:44.810 --> 01:24:44.820 align:start position:0%
might use their opportunity to throw a
 
01:24:49.030 --> 01:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
few elbows and and given our our numbers
 
01:24:50.990 --> 01:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
uh given
 
01:24:54.530 --> 01:24:54.540 align:start position:0%
um that the alternative for the house is
 
01:24:58.070 --> 01:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
to have individuals who object to the
 
01:25:00.890 --> 01:25:00.900 align:start position:0%
ask consent just simply leave for the
 
01:25:03.290 --> 01:25:03.300 align:start position:0%
day early then we start to get into
 
01:25:05.570 --> 01:25:05.580 align:start position:0%
potential Quorum issues and just
 
01:25:08.990 --> 01:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
maintenance of the of the house so
 
01:25:11.510 --> 01:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
um so I would hope that that you would
 
01:25:14.689 --> 01:25:14.699 align:start position:0%
consider this favorably it's not a new
 
01:25:16.970 --> 01:25:16.980 align:start position:0%
issue I think we've discussed this
 
01:25:18.530 --> 01:25:18.540 align:start position:0%
potential rule change or something
 
01:25:21.470 --> 01:25:21.480 align:start position:0%
similar in the past so hopefully you're
 
01:25:23.510 --> 01:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
familiar enough with it that you can
 
01:25:27.649 --> 01:25:27.659 align:start position:0%
apply your own theory on the benefit of
 
01:25:31.010 --> 01:25:31.020 align:start position:0%
of this proposal
 
01:25:31.020 --> 01:25:44.450 align:start position:0%
of this proposal
foreign

01:25:44.450 --> 01:25:44.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:47.689 --> 01:25:47.699 align:start position:0%
my question is I'm curious why the bar
 
01:25:49.610 --> 01:25:49.620 align:start position:0%
was set so high
 
01:25:51.950 --> 01:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
at a two-thirds vote
 
01:25:55.910 --> 01:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
that's 66 and two-thirds percent that a
 
01:25:57.950 --> 01:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
member would need to get the vote of to
 
01:25:59.810 --> 01:25:59.820 align:start position:0%
be allowed to continue with the consent
 
01:26:01.850 --> 01:26:01.860 align:start position:0%
of the house and I just can't understand
 
01:26:05.870 --> 01:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:08.510 --> 01:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
um I I I respect the question I think
 
01:26:12.110 --> 01:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
that's a very fair question I I uh in
 
01:26:14.810 --> 01:26:14.820 align:start position:0%
order to provide you a point of view on
 
01:26:16.970 --> 01:26:16.980 align:start position:0%
it not one that I necessarily am
 
01:26:19.370 --> 01:26:19.380 align:start position:0%
passionate about but but the word
 
01:26:23.030 --> 01:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
unanimous is implies an extremely high
 
01:26:26.030 --> 01:26:26.040 align:start position:0%
bar and and two-thirds is actually
 
01:26:29.870 --> 01:26:29.880 align:start position:0%
pretty far away from being unanimous and
 
01:26:32.209 --> 01:26:32.219 align:start position:0%
so I I think if you look flip it around
 
01:26:34.729 --> 01:26:34.739 align:start position:0%
and look at it the other way what is a
 
01:26:37.669 --> 01:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
unanimous consent uh that two-thirds
 
01:26:41.270 --> 01:26:41.280 align:start position:0%
would reflect a position where it's it's
 
01:26:44.750 --> 01:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
still a whole lot of people so
 
01:26:47.750 --> 01:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
um if if uh if you all wanted to change
 
01:26:50.090 --> 01:26:50.100 align:start position:0%
it to say sixty percent or some other
 
01:26:53.270 --> 01:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
number I I wouldn't object to it the the
 
01:26:55.010 --> 01:26:55.020 align:start position:0%
point is
 
01:26:59.750 --> 01:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
um with our majorities and uh so close
 
01:27:03.350 --> 01:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
to one another a mere 50 percent on any
 
01:27:07.310 --> 01:27:07.320 align:start position:0%
given day open a potential can of worms
 
01:27:10.729 --> 01:27:10.739 align:start position:0%
and so I'm just trying to assure that
 
01:27:13.550 --> 01:27:13.560 align:start position:0%
that there's some bipartisanship in
 
01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:17.290 align:start position:0%
that there's some bipartisanship in
there

01:27:17.290 --> 01:27:17.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:20.689 --> 01:27:20.699 align:start position:0%
brother discussion mine was discussion
 
01:27:22.610 --> 01:27:22.620 align:start position:0%
rather than a question
 
01:27:25.129 --> 01:27:25.139 align:start position:0%
is that okay why don't we get the motion
 
01:27:27.350 --> 01:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
for US Representative
 
01:27:29.450 --> 01:27:29.460 align:start position:0%
well I was trying to figure out what
 
01:27:32.810 --> 01:27:32.820 align:start position:0%
motion I wanted to make but that's okay
 
01:27:35.090 --> 01:27:35.100 align:start position:0%
does somebody want to make a motion well
 
01:27:37.189 --> 01:27:37.199 align:start position:0%
I'd make a push okay
 
01:27:38.930 --> 01:27:38.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman with all due
 
01:27:40.790 --> 01:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
respect to the member I'd move that we
 
01:27:43.189 --> 01:27:43.199 align:start position:0%
not accepted I think that number of
 
01:27:45.410 --> 01:27:45.420 align:start position:0%
requiring a two-thirds vote is extremely
 
01:27:47.450 --> 01:27:47.460 align:start position:0%
high and
 
01:27:49.430 --> 01:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
um I think if it was all it brought
 
01:27:51.590 --> 01:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
before the Lesser number maybe but at
 
01:27:54.169 --> 01:27:54.179 align:start position:0%
two-thirds it's an awful High uh barrier
 
01:27:56.629 --> 01:27:56.639 align:start position:0%
for a member to try to uh uh get
 
01:27:58.729 --> 01:27:58.739 align:start position:0%
permission to continue to speak so I'd
 
01:28:00.530 --> 01:28:00.540 align:start position:0%
ask the committee to vote no one without
 
01:28:03.590 --> 01:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
without due respect to my friend from
 
01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:04.430 align:start position:0%
without due respect to my friend from
Robert

01:28:04.430 --> 01:28:04.440 align:start position:0%
Robert
 
01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:07.070 align:start position:0%
Robert
second

01:28:07.070 --> 01:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:10.610 --> 01:28:10.620 align:start position:0%
Weber and I was going to say I I very
 
01:28:13.910 --> 01:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
much respect the point of view of those
 
01:28:16.310 --> 01:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
submitting this because I think it is a
 
01:28:19.310 --> 01:28:19.320 align:start position:0%
a consideration and I'm I'm actually not
 
01:28:21.649 --> 01:28:21.659 align:start position:0%
opposed to this but I think that there
 
01:28:23.390 --> 01:28:23.400 align:start position:0%
are a couple of other
 
01:28:26.209 --> 01:28:26.219 align:start position:0%
issues with unanimous consent that need
 
01:28:28.490 --> 01:28:28.500 align:start position:0%
to be addressed at the same time and the
 
01:28:32.950 --> 01:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
other one is the area which we have
 
01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:34.930 align:start position:0%
other one is the area which we have
where

01:28:34.930 --> 01:28:34.940 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:28:37.790 --> 01:28:37.800 align:start position:0%
unanimous consent one member withdraws
 
01:28:39.350 --> 01:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
their consent there is a vote of the
 
01:28:41.229 --> 01:28:41.239 align:start position:0%
house to allow the member to proceed
 
01:28:44.689 --> 01:28:44.699 align:start position:0%
very early on in the discussion the
 
01:28:47.330 --> 01:28:47.340 align:start position:0%
member precedes the content becomes
 
01:28:49.850 --> 01:28:49.860 align:start position:0%
exceedingly offensive and there is no
 
01:28:53.470 --> 01:28:53.480 align:start position:0%
longer any way to stop them because
 
01:28:59.290 --> 01:28:59.300 align:start position:0%
the the the ruling was at that time that
 
01:29:03.290 --> 01:29:03.300 align:start position:0%
you could only make the motion once I I
 
01:29:05.629 --> 01:29:05.639 align:start position:0%
personally would argue
 
01:29:05.639 --> 01:29:07.570 align:start position:0%
personally would argue
that

01:29:07.570 --> 01:29:07.580 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:29:10.750 --> 01:29:10.760 align:start position:0%
further intervening
 
01:29:13.550 --> 01:29:13.560 align:start position:0%
offensive speech
 
01:29:16.910 --> 01:29:16.920 align:start position:0%
would allow a renewal of the motion but
 
01:29:19.189 --> 01:29:19.199 align:start position:0%
I don't think that's articulated well
 
01:29:21.169 --> 01:29:21.179 align:start position:0%
anywhere and I was unable to come up
 
01:29:23.510 --> 01:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
with an articulation to present to us
 
01:29:26.330 --> 01:29:26.340 align:start position:0%
today but I I would like
 
01:29:28.430 --> 01:29:28.440 align:start position:0%
us to continue to have the discussion
 
01:29:30.890 --> 01:29:30.900 align:start position:0%
because I do think I do think the point
 
01:29:33.649 --> 01:29:33.659 align:start position:0%
here is a is well taken but I think it
 
01:29:36.290 --> 01:29:36.300 align:start position:0%
there's certain there are several things
 
01:29:44.209 --> 01:29:44.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:55.070 --> 01:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:58.189 --> 01:29:58.199 align:start position:0%
clerical color roll the motion is to not
 
01:29:58.199 --> 01:29:59.270 align:start position:0%
clerical color roll the motion is to not
accept

01:29:59.270 --> 01:29:59.280 align:start position:0%
accept
 
01:30:02.990 --> 01:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:04.189 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:30:04.189 --> 01:30:04.199 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:30:05.810 --> 01:30:05.820 align:start position:0%
representative shirtleff yes
 
01:30:08.750 --> 01:30:08.760 align:start position:0%

representative Weber yes representative
 
01:30:19.370 --> 01:30:19.380 align:start position:0%
evil yes
 
01:30:21.530 --> 01:30:21.540 align:start position:0%
motion to not accept is adopted nine to
 
01:30:21.540 --> 01:30:30.470 align:start position:0%
motion to not accept is adopted nine to
zero

01:30:30.470 --> 01:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:35.890 --> 01:30:35.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:35.900 --> 01:30:37.490 align:start position:0%
 
Sweeney

01:30:37.490 --> 01:30:37.500 align:start position:0%
Sweeney
 
01:30:39.290 --> 01:30:39.300 align:start position:0%
it's proposing an amendment to House
 
01:30:47.570 --> 01:30:47.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:49.250 --> 01:30:49.260 align:start position:0%
thank you again Mr speaker thank you
 
01:30:51.590 --> 01:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
again to the members of the committee
 
01:30:55.310 --> 01:30:55.320 align:start position:0%
um this rules Amendment uh removes the
 
01:30:58.669 --> 01:30:58.679 align:start position:0%
word bulbs and adds the word a in front
 
01:31:01.310 --> 01:31:01.320 align:start position:0%
of flash in the current house rules
 
01:31:04.910 --> 01:31:04.920 align:start position:0%
Banning cameras on the house floor I'm a
 
01:31:07.729 --> 01:31:07.739 align:start position:0%
big fan of photography I uh well
 
01:31:09.169 --> 01:31:09.179 align:start position:0%
occasionally around New Hampshire go to
 
01:31:11.810 --> 01:31:11.820 align:start position:0%
antique shops and buy old cameras that I
 
01:31:14.750 --> 01:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
can and they all have the old flash bulb
 
01:31:17.810 --> 01:31:17.820 align:start position:0%
ports where you put a light bulb in uh
 
01:31:19.370 --> 01:31:19.380 align:start position:0%
but I have not seen one on the house
 
01:31:21.229 --> 01:31:21.239 align:start position:0%
floor and I've been in and out of the
 
01:31:24.110 --> 01:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
legislature for the last 10 years
 
01:31:26.570 --> 01:31:26.580 align:start position:0%
um so I do think the uh the update you
 
01:31:28.430 --> 01:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
know not to undermine the
 
01:31:30.290 --> 01:31:30.300 align:start position:0%
institutionalism or the history of the
 
01:31:32.390 --> 01:31:32.400 align:start position:0%
house and how we do things but I think
 
01:31:34.010 --> 01:31:34.020 align:start position:0%
this is an area where we can update the
 
01:31:37.310 --> 01:31:37.320 align:start position:0%
rules or a simple flash does not have a
 
01:31:39.229 --> 01:31:39.239 align:start position:0%
bulb associated with it anymore and
 
01:31:41.810 --> 01:31:41.820 align:start position:0%
that's the uh that's it that's the
 
01:31:48.950 --> 01:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:52.370 --> 01:31:52.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:55.129 --> 01:31:55.139 align:start position:0%
okay we got a motion to accept is there
 
01:31:57.770 --> 01:31:57.780 align:start position:0%
any discussion
 
01:31:59.750 --> 01:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
there's no discussion clerk will call
 
01:32:03.649 --> 01:32:03.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:05.629 --> 01:32:05.639 align:start position:0%
the motion is to accept representative
 
01:32:08.149 --> 01:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
Packard yes representative shirtless
 
01:32:10.669 --> 01:32:10.679 align:start position:0%

representative Weber
 
01:32:20.990 --> 01:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
representative evil it's a tough call
 
01:32:22.750 --> 01:32:22.760 align:start position:0%
but yeah
 
01:32:25.570 --> 01:32:25.580 align:start position:0%
I'm kidding motion
 
01:32:28.790 --> 01:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
amendment is accepted nine to zero
 
01:32:32.810 --> 01:32:32.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:36.830 --> 01:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:39.590 --> 01:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman we have one remaining
 
01:32:43.129 --> 01:32:43.139 align:start position:0%
that we haven't taken up yet amendment
 
01:32:44.990 --> 01:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
to house rule 66 which is kind of an
 
01:32:47.629 --> 01:32:47.639 align:start position:0%
important one house deadlines
 
01:32:49.370 --> 01:32:49.380 align:start position:0%

sorry
 
01:32:54.770 --> 01:32:54.780 align:start position:0%
yes I have I was just looking for
 
01:32:57.229 --> 01:32:57.239 align:start position:0%
that okay I knew we hadn't taken that
 
01:33:00.350 --> 01:33:00.360 align:start position:0%
one up yet so I'll move acceptance Mr
 
01:33:03.169 --> 01:33:03.179 align:start position:0%
Speaker if that's helpful that that
 
01:33:03.179 --> 01:33:06.050 align:start position:0%
Speaker if that's helpful that that
helps

01:33:06.050 --> 01:33:06.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:09.010 --> 01:33:09.020 align:start position:0%
so we have a motion and a second to
 
01:33:13.310 --> 01:33:13.320 align:start position:0%
accept the uh house deadlines uh is
 
01:33:17.450 --> 01:33:17.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:19.430 --> 01:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
01:33:22.550 --> 01:33:22.560 align:start position:0%
I will just note that the
 
01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:24.550 align:start position:0%
I will just note that the
um

01:33:24.550 --> 01:33:24.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:27.290 --> 01:33:27.300 align:start position:0%
deadline to report how spills going to
 
01:33:30.410 --> 01:33:30.420 align:start position:0%
Second committee has slid
 
01:33:34.430 --> 01:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
later from where it has been some years
 
01:33:36.229 --> 01:33:36.239 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:33:38.510 --> 01:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
later in the calendar there's some
 
01:33:40.669 --> 01:33:40.679 align:start position:0%
squashing to make up with that but we're
 
01:33:43.790 --> 01:33:43.800 align:start position:0%
going to be pressed for time somewhere
 
01:33:45.649 --> 01:33:45.659 align:start position:0%
in the calendar no matter where we put
 
01:33:49.189 --> 01:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
things so I see no reason not to adopt
 
01:33:50.930 --> 01:33:50.940 align:start position:0%
these and I would move that we accept
 
01:33:50.940 --> 01:33:52.729 align:start position:0%
these and I would move that we accept
them

01:33:52.729 --> 01:33:52.739 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:33:55.970 --> 01:33:55.980 align:start position:0%
well it gives us a little bit more time
 
01:33:59.510 --> 01:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
to put the budget together yep
 
01:34:02.570 --> 01:34:02.580 align:start position:0%
we were always pressed with that and uh
 
01:34:04.850 --> 01:34:04.860 align:start position:0%
I'm glad that we're moving forward and
 
01:34:07.510 --> 01:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
giving us a little bit of extra time
 
01:34:11.390 --> 01:34:11.400 align:start position:0%
well there's no further discussion Clerk

we'll need those by the third Tuesday
 
01:34:57.050 --> 01:34:57.060 align:start position:0%
the third so that we can run copies for
 
01:34:58.910 --> 01:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
seat Pockets

thank you
 
01:35:19.850 --> 01:35:19.860 align:start position:0%
um ish I would just be mindful that
 
01:35:22.490 --> 01:35:22.500 align:start position:0%
needing to run 400 copies takes more
 
01:35:25.669 --> 01:35:25.679 align:start position:0%
than 10 minutes though so if if if you
 
01:35:27.770 --> 01:35:27.780 align:start position:0%
do have something the earlier in the day
 
01:35:30.590 --> 01:35:30.600 align:start position:0%
