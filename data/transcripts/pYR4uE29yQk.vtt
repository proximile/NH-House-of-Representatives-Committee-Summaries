00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
when we because we've got we got Ryan
 
00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
Casey here his daughter Morgan helped
 
00:24:49.389 --> 00:24:49.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:53.000 align:start position:0%
that of the education committee uh today
 
00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:56.320 align:start position:0%
our task before us is to look at 24
 
00:24:59.350 --> 00:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
bills which we recommend inome study
 
00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:02.200 align:start position:0%
during the past session and as a
 
00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
reminder to folks uh when we have a bill
 
00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:09.720 align:start position:0%
that's inter room study we can make
 
00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:11.310 align:start position:0%
that's inter room study we can make
uh

00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:11.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:13.480 align:start position:0%
basically two
 
00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
recommendations uh however we have a
 
00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:18.440 align:start position:0%
another recommendation that committees
 
00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
are doing right now and I'll go through
 
00:25:21.549 --> 00:25:21.559 align:start position:0%
them the first recommendation we can
 
00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
make is we recommend this legislation
 
00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
for future legislation so we recommend
 
00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
that it move forward
 
00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:31.640 align:start position:0%
uh often times that can be done with uh
 
00:25:35.269 --> 00:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
with a caveat that moved forward with
 
00:25:35.279 --> 00:25:36.149 align:start position:0%
with a caveat that moved forward with
some

00:25:36.149 --> 00:25:36.159 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
changes um the second motion is not
 
00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:42.320 align:start position:0%
recommending a leg a piece of
 
00:25:44.389 --> 00:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
legislation for future legislation so
 
00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
that would just be basically saying no
 
00:25:50.269 --> 00:25:50.279 align:start position:0%
and the last one and we've seen this
 
00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:52.200 align:start position:0%
number of times in committees throughout
 
00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:55.000 align:start position:0%
the house here where they we've come out
 
00:25:58.269 --> 00:25:58.279 align:start position:0%
with a 1010 no recommendation type vote
 
00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:00.200 align:start position:0%
and that's why often times we ended up
 
00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:04.440 align:start position:0%
with 24 in inter room study uh the
 
00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:07.320 align:start position:0%
the verbich that would be used to
 
00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
reflect that in the in the counter would
 
00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
be unable to reach a consensus of
 
00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:14.440 align:start position:0%
whether to recommend further legislation
 
00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:17.240 align:start position:0%
or not so that's what you would see in
 
00:26:20.149 --> 00:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
the calendar and and the and the chair
 
00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
of the committee here would be putting
 
00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
that uh recommendation forward that
 
00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:25.640 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:28.840 align:start position:0%
myself so we're looking at POS three
 
00:26:31.549 --> 00:26:31.559 align:start position:0%
outcomes coming from this before we get
 
00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
into US I'd like to welcome everybody to

previous two years uh FY 23 and 24 the
 
00:32:15.789 --> 00:32:15.799 align:start position:0%
education committee had more bills than
 
00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:17.960 align:start position:0%
any other Committee in the history of
 
00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
this house has ever had we had 235 bills
 
00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
in this one Committee of which we've
 
00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:28.360 align:start position:0%
retained or interim study uh 24 of them
 
00:32:31.629 --> 00:32:31.639 align:start position:0%
uh we're looking at a rule change for
 
00:32:35.029 --> 00:32:35.039 align:start position:0%
the next year it's very difficult for us
 
00:32:39.269 --> 00:32:39.279 align:start position:0%
to do really down research work on some
 
00:32:41.269 --> 00:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
of the bills which really necessitate
 
00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
that we've been looking at education
 
00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
funding bills we have catastrophic Aid
 
00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:47.000 align:start position:0%
we've been looking at school building
 
00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:49.480 align:start position:0%
Aid Career Technical education higher
 
00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
education and there's a number of
 
00:32:53.149 --> 00:32:53.159 align:start position:0%
concurrent dual enrollment there's a
 
00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
number of issues which are pretty heady
 
00:32:59.110 --> 00:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
issues and and important for this State
 
00:33:02.549 --> 00:33:02.559 align:start position:0%
and so in looking at trying to divide
 
00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:05.480 align:start position:0%
the education committee up as has been
 
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
done in past years or some others you
 
00:33:10.669 --> 00:33:10.679 align:start position:0%
know criminal justice uh Judiciary used
 
00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:13.240 align:start position:0%
to be a singular committee it's been
 
00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:15.440 align:start position:0%
divided up into another one right now as
 
00:33:20.110 --> 00:33:20.120 align:start position:0%
well criminal justice um we we need to
 
00:33:21.269 --> 00:33:21.279 align:start position:0%
do that with
 
00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
education uh so we can get this work
 
00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:26.720 align:start position:0%
done and done properly and not that we
 
00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:28.840 align:start position:0%
haven't been put our nose to it and
 
00:33:32.149 --> 00:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
really working hard to accomplish that
 
00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:34.840 align:start position:0%
but it's been an intensive intensive
 
00:33:37.669 --> 00:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
last several years and a lot of time
 
00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:39.200 align:start position:0%
spent by this committee and I like to
 
00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
congratulate the people on the education
 
00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:43.360 align:start position:0%
committee most committees meet maybe
 
00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:47.720 align:start position:0%
once or twice at Max a week we can count
 
00:33:50.350 --> 00:33:50.360 align:start position:0%
on four days on many of these days not
 
00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:52.840 align:start position:0%
including the session day and it's been
 
00:33:57.269 --> 00:33:57.279 align:start position:0%
very very you know difficult and so by
 
00:33:59.149 --> 00:33:59.159 align:start position:0%
spreading the wealth amongst two
 
00:34:01.470 --> 00:34:01.480 align:start position:0%
separate education committees I think
 
00:34:04.669 --> 00:34:04.679 align:start position:0%
we're going to be able to do a uh a the
 
00:34:06.629 --> 00:34:06.639 align:start position:0%
type of work that I think the Public's
 
00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
expecting us to do and I I hope that U
 
00:34:12.270 --> 00:34:12.280 align:start position:0%
that will net some benefits to us so
 
00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:14.280 align:start position:0%
without any belaboring we're going to
 
00:34:16.069 --> 00:34:16.079 align:start position:0%
get on these interim study bills right
 
00:34:17.629 --> 00:34:17.639 align:start position:0%
here we're going to take them
 
00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
numerically uh so the we'll start with
 
00:34:21.589 --> 00:34:21.599 align:start position:0%
the lowest number first and that would
 
00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
be uh
 
00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:25.629 align:start position:0%
be uh
HB

00:34:25.629 --> 00:34:25.639 align:start position:0%
HB
 
00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:28.520 align:start position:0%
623 and that bill was inter studied and
 
00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
it's establishing a teacher candidate
 
00:34:32.909 --> 00:34:32.919 align:start position:0%
loan uh forgiveness
 
00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
program and I'd like to look for a
 
00:34:41.069 --> 00:34:41.079 align:start position:0%
motion on that yes represent the hall I
 
00:34:43.950 --> 00:34:43.960 align:start position:0%
make a motion that we recommend uh HB
 
00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:51.829 --> 00:34:51.839 align:start position:0%
legislation is there a second of that
 
00:34:53.829 --> 00:34:53.839 align:start position:0%
motion okay we have a motion on the
 
00:34:56.829 --> 00:34:56.839 align:start position:0%
floor to interim study uh for interim
 
00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:00.200 align:start position:0%
study they would recommended for future
 
00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:09.640 align:start position:0%
discussion represent Hall thank you Mr
 
00:35:12.349 --> 00:35:12.359 align:start position:0%
chair um I I just think this program
 
00:35:13.870 --> 00:35:13.880 align:start position:0%
makes a lot of sense in terms of
 
00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:15.200 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and
 
00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:19.320 align:start position:0%
Retention of uh teachers so I think it's
 
00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
a good
 
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
idea represent cordelli yes I uh I have
 
00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
an issue with uh loan
 
00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:31.800 align:start position:0%
forgiveness um what about uh um people
 
00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
who have already paid off their
 
00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:38.240 align:start position:0%
loans um I I think that there um is some
 
00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:38.990 align:start position:0%
loans um I I think that there um is some
uh

00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:42.280 align:start position:0%
unfairness um built into such a program
 
00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:46.240 align:start position:0%
as provided for in this bill so I am uh
 
00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:47.960 align:start position:0%
um a no on
 
00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
this I'd like to also speak to it um
 
00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:53.480 align:start position:0%
this previous year we did pass
 
00:35:56.109 --> 00:35:56.119 align:start position:0%
legislation dealing with folks which
 
00:35:58.470 --> 00:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
come out with debt and over a period of
 
00:36:01.589 --> 00:36:01.599 align:start position:0%
4 years amount part of that debt is paid
 
00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
off the problem was I think we only
 
00:36:06.069 --> 00:36:06.079 align:start position:0%
funded it or appropriated $1 dollar for
 
00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
it as a state and so it's uh we borrowed
 
00:36:11.589 --> 00:36:11.599 align:start position:0%
that legislation from
 
00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
Idaho um and I'm concerned that in in
 
00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
passing these by from the policy
 
00:36:21.829 --> 00:36:21.839 align:start position:0%
perspective but then seeing no dollars
 
00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:24.520 align:start position:0%
allocated and it kind of appears that
 
00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
that's the way it's going to be during
 
00:36:29.829 --> 00:36:29.839 align:start position:0%
the next bium here so I too will not be
 
00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
supporting the motion that it move
 
00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
forward for future
 
00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:37.480 align:start position:0%
legislation further discussion Madam
 
00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:40.200 align:start position:0%
clerk would you please call the role Mr
 
00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
chair any chance we could do this by
 
00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:44.680 align:start position:0%
hand sure and that way we can keep these
 
00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:47.800 align:start position:0%
things move it along that'd be great
 
00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:52.440 align:start position:0%
second I got to do the same way yeah
 
00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:55.240 align:start position:0%
we'll just all those that support the
 
00:36:57.109 --> 00:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
motion the motion would be recommending
 
00:36:59.230 --> 00:36:59.240 align:start position:0%
for fut legislation please put your
 
00:37:01.829 --> 00:37:01.839 align:start position:0%
hands up we'll just count
 
00:37:01.839 --> 00:37:06.270 align:start position:0%
hands up we'll just count
them

00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:06.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:10.760 align:start position:0%
one 10 10 okay those opposed put your
 
00:37:16.309 --> 00:37:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
please 10 okay that's pretty easy to
 
00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:21.069 align:start position:0%
please 10 okay that's pretty easy to
figure

00:37:21.069 --> 00:37:21.079 align:start position:0%
figure
 
00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:31.109 --> 00:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
uh and I'm assuming that we go the other
 
00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:34.640 align:start position:0%
way it's going to be the same
 
00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:37.000 align:start position:0%
boote so is there any need to travel
 
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.230 align:start position:0%
boote so is there any need to travel
down

00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:38.240 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
that I just checked in with Jin he said
 
00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
we need to dooll call votes for the Okay
 
00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:45.440 align:start position:0%

expedites okay so those will go back on
 
00:37:59.069 --> 00:37:59.079 align:start position:0%
623 those that are supporting
 
00:38:02.109 --> 00:38:02.119 align:start position:0%
recommendation for it the motion was
 
00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:03.880 align:start position:0%

lad no and total 10 yays 10 Nays okay
 
00:38:59.349 --> 00:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
now normally what we do is we go with
 
00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
the other motion and not recommend
 
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
future legislation but I'm assuming
 
00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong anybody on the
 
00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:07.880 align:start position:0%
committee that it's going to come out at
 
00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
1010 so with that the the chair will
 
00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
write the the uh final action of this
 
00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:17.200 align:start position:0%
committee is unable to reach a consensus
 
00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:18.680 align:start position:0%
of whether to recommend further
 
00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
legislation or
 
00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
notation so it's without recommendation
 
00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's recommend further it's we're
 
00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:30.160 align:start position:0%
un able to come to consensus regarding a
 
00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
recommendation to either move forward or
 
00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:36.520 align:start position:0%
not so so so Mr chair and and I suspect
 
00:39:38.670 --> 00:39:38.680 align:start position:0%
there may be other
 
00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
votes that come out like this 1010 and
 
00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
so it will be that prescriptive language
 
00:39:46.349 --> 00:39:46.359 align:start position:0%
it will be the same language that I just
 
00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
read unable to reach a consensus of
 
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
whether to recommend further legislation
 
00:39:53.349 --> 00:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
or not right and that and and so has
 
00:39:55.069 --> 00:39:55.079 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with the merits of the
 
00:39:58.150 --> 00:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
bill at all exactly correct exactly all
 
00:39:59.950 --> 00:39:59.960 align:start position:0%
right I believe that that language came
 
00:40:01.630 --> 00:40:01.640 align:start position:0%
from the house clerk that's my
 
00:40:03.390 --> 00:40:03.400 align:start position:0%
understanding yes it did thank you yes
 
00:40:06.589 --> 00:40:06.599 align:start position:0%
it did is that the motion writing here
 
00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
well the the it was recommended for
 
00:40:12.990 --> 00:40:13.000 align:start position:0%
future legisl at 1010 so we have no
 
00:40:17.790 --> 00:40:17.800 align:start position:0%
recommendation and so the yeah and so on
 
00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:19.000 align:start position:0%
that SLI I think you can just write
 
00:40:22.109 --> 00:40:22.119 align:start position:0%
without recommendation yeah okay so yeah
 
00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:24.280 align:start position:0%
without Jen is that what other
 
00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
okay fine okay we're going to move on to
 
00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
HB 1176 this is establishing a
 
00:40:37.470 --> 00:40:37.480 align:start position:0%

um so represent Hall that's calendar 6
 
01:05:27.150 --> 01:05:27.160 align:start position:0%
page four you're can find a prior
 
01:05:29.470 --> 01:05:29.480 align:start position:0%

it's the engine that drives Ingenuity

step and I've received valuable feedback
 
01:06:59.190 --> 01:06:59.200 align:start position:0%
from some of the committee members I've
 
01:07:00.510 --> 01:07:00.520 align:start position:0%
come to realize that starting the
 
01:07:02.829 --> 01:07:02.839 align:start position:0%
program on a limited scale and growing
 
01:07:04.230 --> 01:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
it will provide more accurate
 
01:07:06.470 --> 01:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
information on the potential cost of
 
01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:07.630 align:start position:0%
information on the potential cost of
this

01:07:07.630 --> 01:07:07.640 align:start position:0%

01:07:09.829 --> 01:07:09.839 align:start position:0%

session
 
01:24:01.830 --> 01:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
here and we have a motion on the floor
 
01:24:02.910 --> 01:24:02.920 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:24:05.550 --> 01:24:05.560 align:start position:0%
1534 relative to establishing a program
 
01:24:07.270 --> 01:24:07.280 align:start position:0%
to earn tuition credits for state New
 
01:24:09.229 --> 01:24:09.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire higher education institutions
 
01:24:12.390 --> 01:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
through community service the motion is
 
01:24:17.470 --> 01:24:17.480 align:start position:0%
uh the bill be put forward for future
 
01:24:20.030 --> 01:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
legislation Is there further discussion
 
01:24:23.470 --> 01:24:23.480 align:start position:0%
on the yes representative thank you Mr
 
01:24:25.830 --> 01:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
chair and I'd like to say thank you to
 
01:24:28.350 --> 01:24:28.360 align:start position:0%
you and your sister as well I think a
 
01:24:30.229 --> 01:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
lot of us can recognize the Merit in the
 
01:24:32.629 --> 01:24:32.639 align:start position:0%
idea and look forward to seeing perhaps
 
01:24:34.669 --> 01:24:34.679 align:start position:0%
what you bring forward next if the cost
 
01:24:36.590 --> 01:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
is reduced or maybe some more extensive
 
01:24:40.229 --> 01:24:40.239 align:start position:0%
analysis on how the cost is determined
 
01:24:43.070 --> 01:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
but um so to clarify my vote is in
 
01:24:44.750 --> 01:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
support of the idea and not necessarily
 
01:24:46.390 --> 01:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
the fiscal amount and I think I speak
 
01:24:48.390 --> 01:24:48.400 align:start position:0%
for quite a few of us when I say that
 
01:24:50.149 --> 01:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
but thank
 
01:24:53.189 --> 01:24:53.199 align:start position:0%
you yeah if you look at the write up
 
01:24:55.709 --> 01:24:55.719 align:start position:0%
that the doe did on this they took a
 
01:24:59.229 --> 01:24:59.239 align:start position:0%
hypothetical that we know we have 52,000
 
01:25:01.830 --> 01:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
plus high school students in the
 
01:25:05.070 --> 01:25:05.080 align:start position:0%
state if 20% took advantage of the
 
01:25:07.790 --> 01:25:07.800 align:start position:0%
program that's about 10,000
 
01:25:11.830 --> 01:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
kids $2500 times the 10,000 students
 
01:25:15.030 --> 01:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
would be $25 million a year and
 
01:25:18.870 --> 01:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
obviously that's out of the ballpark uh
 
01:25:22.270 --> 01:25:22.280 align:start position:0%
however this concept has a lot of
 
01:25:24.870 --> 01:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
Merit and so
 
01:25:27.310 --> 01:25:27.320 align:start position:0%
I think you said scale back in your
 
01:25:30.430 --> 01:25:30.440 align:start position:0%
presentation to us I think that's good
 
01:25:32.990 --> 01:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
thing to be looking at so as it further
 
01:25:37.149 --> 01:25:37.159 align:start position:0%
discussion on the yes represent Damon so
 
01:25:38.510 --> 01:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
I would just acknowledge as the maker of
 
01:25:39.950 --> 01:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
the motion that I would be happy to
 
01:25:42.229 --> 01:25:42.239 align:start position:0%
include in the report that the concept
 
01:25:44.830 --> 01:25:44.840 align:start position:0%
has significant Merit but it needs more
 
01:25:47.750 --> 01:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal analysis and a really careful
 
01:25:49.270 --> 01:25:49.280 align:start position:0%
look at further development of thank you
 
01:25:52.390 --> 01:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
very much PR thank you okay further

01:29:02.149 --> 01:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion I would just very
 
01:29:05.390 --> 01:29:05.400 align:start position:0%
briefly 1586 is a comprehensive school
 
01:29:08.790 --> 01:29:08.800 align:start position:0%
funding reform um uh obviously there's a
 
01:29:10.550 --> 01:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
lot going on in the courts right now
 
01:29:14.270 --> 01:29:14.280 align:start position:0%
with respect to um to uh school funding
 
01:29:16.470 --> 01:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
but uh but I don't think anybody uh in
 
01:29:18.149 --> 01:29:18.159 align:start position:0%
the state is necessarily looking at our
 
01:29:20.590 --> 01:29:20.600 align:start position:0%
current uh mechanism for um for funding
 
01:29:22.550 --> 01:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
schools and saying oh yeah that's
 
01:29:25.629 --> 01:29:25.639 align:start position:0%
working out really well um so um so
 
01:29:29.350 --> 01:29:29.360 align:start position:0%
while 1586 is uh currently I think a 26
 
01:29:31.669 --> 01:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
page Bill and there's a lot to it
 
01:29:33.629 --> 01:29:33.639 align:start position:0%
there's some things that uh that I think
 
01:29:35.149 --> 01:29:35.159 align:start position:0%
people like some things that people
 
01:29:36.790 --> 01:29:36.800 align:start position:0%
maybe don't like so much but I think it
 
01:29:40.950 --> 01:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
does give us a basis to work from and um
 
01:29:43.669 --> 01:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
and uh a number of us do intend to uh
 
01:29:45.550 --> 01:29:45.560 align:start position:0%
bring forward something along these
 
01:29:47.910 --> 01:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
lines uh during the next uh session
 
01:29:50.550 --> 01:29:50.560 align:start position:0%
should we be here so um so anyway I
 
01:29:52.669 --> 01:29:52.679 align:start position:0%
would appreciate everybody's positive
 
01:29:56.270 --> 01:29:56.280 align:start position:0%

01:29:58.669 --> 01:29:58.679 align:start position:0%
that it's it's a complicated situation

costs further discussion sure just just
 
01:40:33.390 --> 01:40:33.400 align:start position:0%
briefly Mr chair thank you um uh I would
 
01:40:35.589 --> 01:40:35.599 align:start position:0%
I I would recommend that this bill be
 
01:40:38.189 --> 01:40:38.199 align:start position:0%
looked at for future legislation but uh
 
01:40:41.910 --> 01:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
but in terms of considering uh what the
 
01:40:44.629 --> 01:40:44.639 align:start position:0%
actual costs are for special education
 
01:40:47.149 --> 01:40:47.159 align:start position:0%
when uh when calculating the cost
 
01:40:50.750 --> 01:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
formula uh and um and you know different
 
01:40:52.709 --> 01:40:52.719 align:start position:0%
than reimbursing every school district
 
01:40:54.950 --> 01:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
for every cost of special education but
 
01:40:57.229 --> 01:40:57.239 align:start position:0%
at least considering how these costs
 
01:41:01.510 --> 01:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
impact the total cost of um of um U of
 
01:41:04.709 --> 01:41:04.719 align:start position:0%
Education in a school district thank you
 
01:41:06.790 --> 01:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
any further discussion I will speak to
 
01:41:10.149 --> 01:41:10.159 align:start position:0%
this a little bit here um we did pass
 
01:41:13.990 --> 01:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
legislation last year through this
 
01:41:16.270 --> 01:41:16.280 align:start position:0%
committee by the house
 
01:41:19.310 --> 01:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
floor and by house
 
01:41:22.390 --> 01:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
finance to change the formula for
 
01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:25.430 align:start position:0%
finance to change the formula for
differentiated

01:41:25.430 --> 01:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:27.510 --> 01:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the Senate didn't see it
 
01:41:30.870 --> 01:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
our way and we had three categories of
 
01:41:33.750 --> 01:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
funding for the 13 different IEPs and
 
01:41:36.350 --> 01:41:36.360 align:start position:0%
that's I know that that type of
 
01:41:39.950 --> 01:41:39.960 align:start position:0%
legislation is coming back we also had a
 
01:41:41.750 --> 01:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
number of bills which were dealing with
 
01:41:44.430 --> 01:41:44.440 align:start position:0%
the the elephant in the room in terms of
 
01:41:47.270 --> 01:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
special education catastrophic Aid or
 
01:41:49.870 --> 01:41:49.880 align:start position:0%
special education Aid as we now call it
 
01:41:51.510 --> 01:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
where the three and a half first three
 
01:41:54.109 --> 01:41:54.119 align:start position:0%
and a half times the average cost
 
01:41:57.550 --> 01:41:57.560 align:start position:0%
of a student are paid by the
 
01:42:03.390 --> 01:42:03.400 align:start position:0%
district we know that's upwards towards
 
01:42:06.149 --> 01:42:06.159 align:start position:0%
$70,000 and from the three and a half
 
01:42:10.189 --> 01:42:10.199 align:start position:0%
times to 10 times 80% is paid by the
 
01:42:12.470 --> 01:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
state and the district has to cough up
 
01:42:13.790 --> 01:42:13.800 align:start position:0%
that other
 
01:42:16.510 --> 01:42:16.520 align:start position:0%
20% so there are some real issues in
 
01:42:20.149 --> 01:42:20.159 align:start position:0%
terms of funding um special
 
01:42:22.589 --> 01:42:22.599 align:start position:0%
education and whether all costs should
 
01:42:26.470 --> 01:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
be that of the state or not is a
 
01:42:28.629 --> 01:42:28.639 align:start position:0%
question and so but that's just some
 
01:42:32.070 --> 01:42:32.080 align:start position:0%
information for your decision
 
01:42:37.669 --> 01:42:37.679 align:start position:0%

Society for the state is on it and it's
 
01:44:17.109 --> 01:44:17.119 align:start position:0%
moving along and making some real
 
01:44:19.790 --> 01:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
wonderful recommendations in terms of uh
 
01:44:23.870 --> 01:44:23.880 align:start position:0%
complying with hb2 nsv 216 which was a
 
01:44:26.629 --> 01:44:26.639 align:start position:0%
bill that mandated that Civics be taught
 
01:44:28.430 --> 01:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
in the middle school and in the high
 
01:44:30.390 --> 01:44:30.400 align:start position:0%
school along with history Etc there at
 
01:44:33.550 --> 01:44:33.560 align:start position:0%
the high school and in terms of grades K
 
01:44:36.189 --> 01:44:36.199 align:start position:0%
through 8 that Civics education
 
01:44:38.950 --> 01:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
curriculum may be taught embedded within
 
01:44:40.950 --> 01:44:40.960 align:start position:0%
other subject areas presently being
 
01:44:43.589 --> 01:44:43.599 align:start position:0%
taught they're making a lot of progress
 
01:44:47.830 --> 01:44:47.840 align:start position:0%
on this in terms of you know this aspect
 
01:44:50.189 --> 01:44:50.199 align:start position:0%
and talking about accountability as
 
01:44:54.070 --> 01:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
well so um there is a an organization
 
01:44:55.990 --> 01:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
which is tasked to go forward this is
 
01:44:58.750 --> 01:44:58.760 align:start position:0%
also a result of you know the
 
01:45:00.550 --> 01:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
appropriation of a million dollars which
 
01:45:02.709 --> 01:45:02.719 align:start position:0%
we gave that organization that set up
 
01:45:05.070 --> 01:45:05.080 align:start position:0%
the textbook for this through
 
01:45:08.350 --> 01:45:08.360 align:start position:0%
hb2 so that's where we stand on that
 
01:45:11.310 --> 01:45:11.320 align:start position:0%
progress is being made I'm concerned
 
01:45:14.790 --> 01:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
that that we allow that group to
 
01:45:17.350 --> 01:45:17.360 align:start position:0%
finalize where they are and coming out
 
01:45:21.070 --> 01:45:21.080 align:start position:0%
with this report the discovery um what
 
01:45:24.149 --> 01:45:24.159 align:start position:0%
do you call the the U commercial program
 
01:45:25.510 --> 01:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
Discovery you see it in television every
 
01:45:27.750 --> 01:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
now and then too is very much been
 
01:45:29.589 --> 01:45:29.599 align:start position:0%
contracted as a third party to help
 
01:45:32.149 --> 01:45:32.159 align:start position:0%
write this curriculum I think I'm seeing
 
01:45:34.430 --> 01:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
some really pretty good stuff coming out
 
01:45:37.310 --> 01:45:37.320 align:start position:0%
the Historical Society here is offering
 
01:45:39.310 --> 01:45:39.320 align:start position:0%
much much information you know moose on
 
01:45:40.790 --> 01:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
the loose program if you're familiar
 
01:45:43.229 --> 01:45:43.239 align:start position:0%
with that um that's being incorporated
 
01:45:46.430 --> 01:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
into the program so that's just some
 
01:45:50.229 --> 01:45:50.239 align:start position:0%
information to make your decision Mr
 
01:45:53.550 --> 01:45:53.560 align:start position:0%
yes um I just want to make it clear that
 
01:45:55.990 --> 01:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
this bill is about the high Stak Civics
 
01:45:58.870 --> 01:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
test for senior graduation right that's
 
01:46:03.270 --> 01:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
part of the national uh testing for uh
 
01:46:05.310 --> 01:46:05.320 align:start position:0%
citizenship we're not talking about
 
01:46:08.510 --> 01:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
Civics a Civics course per se yeah but
 
01:46:10.990 --> 01:46:11.000 align:start position:0%
the Civics people are talking this also
 
01:46:13.270 --> 01:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
it they C of mesh together is that the
 
01:46:15.830 --> 01:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
way we is that the tool we use to
 
01:46:18.229 --> 01:46:18.239 align:start position:0%
measure accountability for a Civics
 
01:46:20.990 --> 01:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
program or for your graduating from high
 
01:46:22.750 --> 01:46:22.760 align:start position:0%
school does that incorporate everything
 
01:46:25.870 --> 01:46:25.880 align:start position:0%
in is being measured through that Civics
 
01:46:25.880 --> 01:46:27.390 align:start position:0%
in is being measured through that Civics
task

01:46:27.390 --> 01:46:27.400 align:start position:0%
task
 
01:46:31.149 --> 01:46:31.159 align:start position:0%
force question that's all thank you
 
01:46:32.870 --> 01:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
further discussion well the maker of the
 
01:46:35.790 --> 01:46:35.800 align:start position:0%
motion prer to talk pardon me the maker
 
01:46:37.910 --> 01:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
of the motion would like to talk yes
 
01:46:42.189 --> 01:46:42.199 align:start position:0%
thank you um Mr chair I agree with uh
 
01:46:44.830 --> 01:46:44.840 align:start position:0%
your comments on the work of the
 
01:46:46.470 --> 01:46:46.480 align:start position:0%
commission and most of the people on the
 
01:46:49.229 --> 01:46:49.239 align:start position:0%
commission are uh experts in that field
 
01:46:52.870 --> 01:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
and I think they're uh program
 
01:46:53.910 --> 01:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
curricular to bring back would be
 
01:46:57.830 --> 01:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
terrific however this bill uh tends not
 
01:46:59.430 --> 01:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
to deal with that as representative
 
01:47:01.709 --> 01:47:01.719 align:start position:0%
Tanis said but rather once again
 
01:47:03.470 --> 01:47:03.480 align:start position:0%
impacting local school committees to
 
01:47:05.750 --> 01:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
make the decision on how they evaluate
 
01:47:07.229 --> 01:47:07.239 align:start position:0%
their youngsters and their students in
 
01:47:09.709 --> 01:47:09.719 align:start position:0%
the classroom uh and the curriculum that
 
01:47:11.629 --> 01:47:11.639 align:start position:0%
they use so I don't think the bill
 
01:47:13.669 --> 01:47:13.679 align:start position:0%
should go forward because once again we
 
01:47:16.430 --> 01:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
should not be telling local school
 
01:47:18.870 --> 01:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
boards how they have to test and
 
01:47:21.070 --> 01:47:21.080 align:start position:0%
evaluate their their own
 
01:47:23.070 --> 01:47:23.080 align:start position:0%
students uh this goes along with some
 
01:47:25.310 --> 01:47:25.320 align:start position:0%
other Bill we had about uh immigration
 
01:47:27.709 --> 01:47:27.719 align:start position:0%
before uh in terms of the same concept
 
01:47:30.550 --> 01:47:30.560 align:start position:0%
this is should not be a required piece
 
01:47:32.109 --> 01:47:32.119 align:start position:0%
to tell local school boards the
 
01:47:33.310 --> 01:47:33.320 align:start position:0%
curriculum you're talking about I think
 
01:47:35.430 --> 01:47:35.440 align:start position:0%
is superb but the requirement that to
 
01:47:36.870 --> 01:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
force local school boards to do what we
 
01:47:39.229 --> 01:47:39.239 align:start position:0%
want down here is not appropriate thank
 
01:47:44.109 --> 01:47:44.119 align:start position:0%

01:50:22.910 --> 01:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
year HB 1205 it was signed into law um
 
01:50:25.550 --> 01:50:25.560 align:start position:0%
it is currently in the courts I believe
 
01:50:29.709 --> 01:50:29.719 align:start position:0%
um so I see no need for this uh bill um
 
01:50:31.709 --> 01:50:31.719 align:start position:0%
in the next legislative session as we
 
01:50:35.390 --> 01:50:35.400 align:start position:0%
already have a law on the books gson
 
01:50:37.510 --> 01:50:37.520 align:start position:0%

01:50:41.109 --> 01:50:41.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:44.109 --> 01:50:44.119 align:start position:0%

recommend further legislation or not
 
01:51:58.870 --> 01:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
those bills will all have that line the

01:53:21.030 --> 01:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
and shows red where it's been added or
 
01:53:21.040 --> 01:53:22.550 align:start position:0%
and shows red where it's been added or
deleted

01:53:22.550 --> 01:53:22.560 align:start position:0%
deleted
 
01:53:26.069 --> 01:53:26.079 align:start position:0%
so check it out Jen
 
01:53:29.229 --> 01:53:29.239 align:start position:0%
have could you please make you know how
 
01:53:32.950 --> 01:53:32.960 align:start position:0%
many people are on the that either the
 
01:53:36.430 --> 01:53:36.440 align:start position:0%
the Jo the Jael car group and that's the
 
01:53:38.470 --> 01:53:38.480 align:start position:0%
group where we have a responsibility to
 
01:53:40.510 --> 01:53:40.520 align:start position:0%
review all three all administrative
 
01:53:43.709 --> 01:53:43.719 align:start position:0%
rules or on the other how many people we
 
01:53:45.310 --> 01:53:45.320 align:start position:0%
have on that so we can get some copies
 
01:53:47.470 --> 01:53:47.480 align:start position:0%
made for
 
01:53:49.470 --> 01:53:49.480 align:start position:0%
everybody no there's
 
01:53:51.430 --> 01:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
only and
 
01:53:54.750 --> 01:53:54.760 align:start position:0%
I three and two no it's four to two four
 
01:53:56.870 --> 01:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
to two
 
01:54:01.709 --> 01:54:01.719 align:start position:0%
so so could you please you know make
 
01:54:04.149 --> 01:54:04.159 align:start position:0%
make it about eight copies please of
 
01:54:07.510 --> 01:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
each the front half and the back half so
 
01:54:09.830 --> 01:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
so on the on those copies Mr chair and
 
01:54:11.950 --> 01:54:11.960 align:start position:0%
and this is actually for for anybody
 
01:54:14.430 --> 01:54:14.440 align:start position:0%
else that that is because there a lot of
 
01:54:16.629 --> 01:54:16.639 align:start position:0%
people that are following this the um
 
01:54:18.830 --> 01:54:18.840 align:start position:0%
the redlining or the change tracking on
 
01:54:23.390 --> 01:54:23.400 align:start position:0%
that is not change tracking back to the
 
01:54:26.870 --> 01:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
current rules it's only change tracking
 
01:54:29.589 --> 01:54:29.599 align:start position:0%
back to whatever prior draft was worked
 
01:54:33.870 --> 01:54:33.880 align:start position:0%
on by the Department of Education so so
 
01:54:35.830 --> 01:54:35.840 align:start position:0%
when looking at that when looking at the
 
01:54:38.470 --> 01:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
drafts with change tracking on don't
 
01:54:43.310 --> 01:54:43.320 align:start position:0%
don't assume that anything that isn't
 
01:54:47.470 --> 01:54:47.480 align:start position:0%
redlined um how do I say it the there
 
01:54:49.470 --> 01:54:49.480 align:start position:0%
may be things that aren't redlined that
 
01:54:52.350 --> 01:54:52.360 align:start position:0%
are still changes from current from
 
01:54:55.589 --> 01:54:55.599 align:start position:0%
current rule uh so it's it's very
 
01:54:58.310 --> 01:54:58.320 align:start position:0%
difficult to uh to see how things are
 
01:55:01.709 --> 01:55:01.719 align:start position:0%
changed without doing a side by side
 
01:55:04.109 --> 01:55:04.119 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah excuse me chairman lad may I
 
01:55:07.430 --> 01:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
make a request yes um that that link
 
01:55:09.990 --> 01:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
gets sent to all of us on the committee
 
01:55:11.629 --> 01:55:11.639 align:start position:0%
because I know when I go on the doe
 
01:55:14.750 --> 01:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
website I get lost so I would appreciate
 
01:55:16.430 --> 01:55:16.440 align:start position:0%
just having a specific link so that I
 
01:55:19.589 --> 01:55:19.599 align:start position:0%
can find them thank you yeah you go to
 
01:55:21.669 --> 01:55:21.679 align:start position:0%
the section has administrative rules and
 
01:55:24.069 --> 01:55:24.079 align:start position:0%
then you go down several links down
 
01:55:27.189 --> 01:55:27.199 align:start position:0%
we'll get that to you we'll get that to
 
01:55:30.430 --> 01:55:30.440 align:start position:0%
everybody um the other thing I wanted to
 
01:55:32.589 --> 01:55:32.599 align:start position:0%
speak to everybody about there's been
 
01:55:35.109 --> 01:55:35.119 align:start position:0%
some concern throughout the state that
 
01:55:37.430 --> 01:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
local municipalities are going through
 
01:55:39.750 --> 01:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
reassessments of property
 
01:55:43.830 --> 01:55:43.840 align:start position:0%
values and the my particular town is one
 
01:55:46.510 --> 01:55:46.520 align:start position:0%
of them and not doing it in a 5year
 
01:55:48.669 --> 01:55:48.679 align:start position:0%
cycle but doing it on a three-year
 
01:55:51.750 --> 01:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
cycle and some of those re aows are
 
01:55:55.350 --> 01:55:55.360 align:start position:0%
coming out as high as 78 80% on top of
 
01:55:57.910 --> 01:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
what they have been in the past the
 
01:56:00.390 --> 01:56:00.400 align:start position:0%
questions that I have been asking over
 
01:56:00.400 --> 01:56:01.430 align:start position:0%
questions that I have been asking over
to

01:56:01.430 --> 01:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:56:04.750 --> 01:56:04.760 align:start position:0%
doe to the finance people and to
 
01:56:09.030 --> 01:56:09.040 align:start position:0%
Dr is that yes we we do know that
 
01:56:11.270 --> 01:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
changes are being made in terms of
 
01:56:13.709 --> 01:56:13.719 align:start position:0%
market value current market value of
 
01:56:15.470 --> 01:56:15.480 align:start position:0%
these Residential Properties and
 
01:56:15.480 --> 01:56:16.629 align:start position:0%
these Residential Properties and
Commercial

01:56:16.629 --> 01:56:16.639 align:start position:0%
Commercial
 
01:56:19.470 --> 01:56:19.480 align:start position:0%
properties and we have what we call an
 
01:56:22.870 --> 01:56:22.880 align:start position:0%
equalized property ratio which shows you
 
01:56:25.709 --> 01:56:25.719 align:start position:0%
where the reeval is in terms of the
 
01:56:28.510 --> 01:56:28.520 align:start position:0%
market value if you got 100 it means
 
01:56:30.910 --> 01:56:30.920 align:start position:0%
they're 100% they're there together but
 
01:56:33.109 --> 01:56:33.119 align:start position:0%
if you have like a 58 or something such
 
01:56:34.950 --> 01:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
as that it means your assessment
 
01:56:37.910 --> 01:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
properties only 58% of what the market
 
01:56:39.830 --> 01:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
is driving right now or the current
 
01:56:43.109 --> 01:56:43.119 align:start position:0%
market within the last year or so and my
 
01:56:45.589 --> 01:56:45.599 align:start position:0%
the concern that folks are raising is we
 
01:56:47.430 --> 01:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
have a number of areas within our
 
01:56:50.550 --> 01:56:50.560 align:start position:0%
finance formula which are based off of
 
01:56:52.990 --> 01:56:53.000 align:start position:0%
property values
 
01:56:55.669 --> 01:56:55.679 align:start position:0%
uh such as the extraordinary needs Grant
 
01:56:57.310 --> 01:56:57.320 align:start position:0%
which is on the right hand side Mary you
 
01:56:58.990 --> 01:56:59.000 align:start position:0%
know that on the right hand side the
 
01:57:00.910 --> 01:57:00.920 align:start position:0%
leftand side is a base differentiated
 
01:57:03.510 --> 01:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
Aid stuff on the right hand side you
 
01:57:05.350 --> 01:57:05.360 align:start position:0%
have this extraordinary need and it's
 
01:57:07.629 --> 01:57:07.639 align:start position:0%
based upon equiz property valuation
 
01:57:09.550 --> 01:57:09.560 align:start position:0%
including those things such as utilities
 
01:57:11.750 --> 01:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
and railroads but divided by the number
 
01:57:14.910 --> 01:57:14.920 align:start position:0%
of kids that qualify for fnr free and
 
01:57:14.920 --> 01:57:15.870 align:start position:0%
of kids that qualify for fnr free and
reduced

01:57:15.870 --> 01:57:15.880 align:start position:0%
reduced
 
01:57:18.550 --> 01:57:18.560 align:start position:0%
meals and we're seeing with the re
 
01:57:22.510 --> 01:57:22.520 align:start position:0%
values that some of these um change Es
 
01:57:25.390 --> 01:57:25.400 align:start position:0%
are impacting the extraordinary need
 
01:57:29.229 --> 01:57:29.239 align:start position:0%
grant funding and districts are starting
 
01:57:30.950 --> 01:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
to filter through that and see the
 
01:57:33.709 --> 01:57:33.719 align:start position:0%
consequences of that now so if you hear
 
01:57:35.709 --> 01:57:35.719 align:start position:0%
anything about it my suggestion is you
 
01:57:38.709 --> 01:57:38.719 align:start position:0%
contact doe and Dr and try to get a
 
01:57:42.189 --> 01:57:42.199 align:start position:0%
handle on that um it's something that we
 
01:57:44.030 --> 01:57:44.040 align:start position:0%
as a legislature are going to have to
 
01:57:45.629 --> 01:57:45.639 align:start position:0%
address represent L do you have anything
 
01:57:47.310 --> 01:57:47.320 align:start position:0%
for this say on that because we talked
 
01:57:50.870 --> 01:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
earlier today about it sure um yeah um
 
01:57:52.629 --> 01:57:52.639 align:start position:0%
chair lad and I are going to are going
 
01:57:55.069 --> 01:57:55.079 align:start position:0%
to get together with um we're looking to
 
01:57:56.550 --> 01:57:56.560 align:start position:0%
get together with some some
 
01:57:58.310 --> 01:57:58.320 align:start position:0%
representatives from the Department of
 
01:58:00.629 --> 01:58:00.639 align:start position:0%
Revenue Administration to really
 
01:58:03.350 --> 01:58:03.360 align:start position:0%
understand what the impact is on um on
 
01:58:06.270 --> 01:58:06.280 align:start position:0%
some of these um um school funding
 
01:58:09.069 --> 01:58:09.079 align:start position:0%
grants obviously it's of of great
 
01:58:12.310 --> 01:58:12.320 align:start position:0%
concern right now and actually I I had
 
01:58:14.030 --> 01:58:14.040 align:start position:0%
concern about that even when those
 
01:58:16.350 --> 01:58:16.360 align:start position:0%
grants were when the language for those
 
01:58:17.709 --> 01:58:17.719 align:start position:0%
were being developed because they were
 
01:58:20.669 --> 01:58:20.679 align:start position:0%
so tightly coupled with valuations
 
01:58:22.629 --> 01:58:22.639 align:start position:0%
during a during a very
 
01:58:25.790 --> 01:58:25.800 align:start position:0%
you know um unusual uh real estate
 
01:58:29.629 --> 01:58:29.639 align:start position:0%
market and and uh and so
 
01:58:35.229 --> 01:58:35.239 align:start position:0%
um so I I I I I I think we're all you
 
01:58:37.870 --> 01:58:37.880 align:start position:0%
know seeing seeing our communities go
 
01:58:39.510 --> 01:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
through this I'm certainly seeing it in
 
01:58:41.229 --> 01:58:41.239 align:start position:0%
hopkington where people are lined up
 
01:58:43.790 --> 01:58:43.800 align:start position:0%
getting into town hall uh you know
 
01:58:45.629 --> 01:58:45.639 align:start position:0%
because they're so surprised at the uh
 
01:58:48.470 --> 01:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
the change in the valuations but uh but
 
01:58:50.910 --> 01:58:50.920 align:start position:0%
where the real surprise is going to be
 
01:58:54.109 --> 01:58:54.119 align:start position:0%
is in the um in the state grants um to
 
01:58:56.189 --> 01:58:56.199 align:start position:0%
school districts that are based on
 
01:58:58.149 --> 01:58:58.159 align:start position:0%
valuation so we're going to need to take
 
01:59:01.109 --> 01:59:01.119 align:start position:0%
a very careful look about how we you
 
01:59:03.310 --> 01:59:03.320 align:start position:0%
know whether we Factor valuation into
 
01:59:05.709 --> 01:59:05.719 align:start position:0%
grants down the road and how we make
 
01:59:09.550 --> 01:59:09.560 align:start position:0%
sure that those grants are or the the um
 
01:59:12.189 --> 01:59:12.199 align:start position:0%
how the valuations are calculated that
 
01:59:16.589 --> 01:59:16.599 align:start position:0%
can keep up with changes in in you know
 
01:59:19.870 --> 01:59:19.880 align:start position:0%
in the in the real market right the
 
01:59:22.550 --> 01:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
equalization they're all doing this then
 
01:59:24.669 --> 01:59:24.679 align:start position:0%
fine but they're all all the towns are
 
01:59:27.430 --> 01:59:27.440 align:start position:0%
not doing it so it's not going to be
 
01:59:31.030 --> 01:59:31.040 align:start position:0%
equal and if you're doing this out of
 
01:59:33.790 --> 01:59:33.800 align:start position:0%
sync of the five years you know right
 
01:59:35.550 --> 01:59:35.560 align:start position:0%
now we're in a moment in time where the
 
01:59:40.109 --> 01:59:40.119 align:start position:0%
market values are really up and and uh
 
01:59:43.189 --> 01:59:43.199 align:start position:0%
so it is a concern and school boards my
 
01:59:45.229 --> 01:59:45.239 align:start position:0%
school board has recognized that my
 
01:59:47.629 --> 01:59:47.639 align:start position:0%
community is seeing where the commercial
 
01:59:50.030 --> 01:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
properties are not jumping but the
 
01:59:52.390 --> 01:59:52.400 align:start position:0%
Residential Properties are jumping by
 
01:59:56.870 --> 01:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
twice you so you're seeing 80% plus
 
02:00:00.350 --> 02:00:00.360 align:start position:0%
increases and that is very difficult and
 
02:00:04.350 --> 02:00:04.360 align:start position:0%
the concern we have is Workforce housing
 
02:00:06.229 --> 02:00:06.239 align:start position:0%
for young people moving into the state
 
02:00:07.790 --> 02:00:07.800 align:start position:0%
where they're seeing these prices now
 
02:00:10.470 --> 02:00:10.480 align:start position:0%
they can't afford to find a place and so
 
02:00:13.270 --> 02:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
your towns having a hard time attracting
 
02:00:15.990 --> 02:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
people there's there's young families
 
02:00:19.910 --> 02:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
so keep in tune if you if you get hit
 
02:00:22.069 --> 02:00:22.079 align:start position:0%
with something as a representative you
 
02:00:27.030 --> 02:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
know I would I would call doe and Dr and
 
02:00:28.790 --> 02:00:28.800 align:start position:0%
and try and get a better understanding
 
02:00:32.189 --> 02:00:32.199 align:start position:0%
what's going on or or reach out or reach
 
02:00:32.199 --> 02:00:33.629 align:start position:0%
what's going on or or reach out or reach
out

02:00:33.629 --> 02:00:33.639 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:00:36.069 --> 02:00:36.079 align:start position:0%
yeah okay thank you very much that
