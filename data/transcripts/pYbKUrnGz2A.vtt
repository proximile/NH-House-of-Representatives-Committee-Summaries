considerable break
 
00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
and we're back now to discuss some
 
00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 align:start position:0%
interim study bills we have six to
 
00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 align:start position:0%
discuss today but before we get started
 
00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 align:start position:0%
if you would uh please stand and join me
 
00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 align:start position:0%
the flag is right behind me
 
00:05:54.360 --> 00:06:06.010 align:start position:0%
the flag is right behind me
yeah

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:06.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
justice for all thank you can be seated
 
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
our procedures uh
 
00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:19.919 align:start position:0%
suggests that you wait to be recognized
 
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:23.100 align:start position:0%
if you want to speak and if you do speak
 
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.020 align:start position:0%
you push the little button in front of
 
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:27.240 align:start position:0%
you to the red light comes on and that
 
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:28.860 align:start position:0%
means that'll turn your microphone on
 
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
and then I ask that after you finish
 
00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:33.539 align:start position:0%
speaking you push it again to turn the
 
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:35.940 align:start position:0%
microphone off
 
00:06:38.809 --> 00:06:38.819 align:start position:0%
otherwise what you say as a reminder
 
00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
goes out over the world wide web
 
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:44.580 align:start position:0%
and is noted by
 
00:06:50.749 --> 00:06:50.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:54.300 align:start position:0%
uh today our agenda is to uh
 
00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:56.220 align:start position:0%
to speak to the
 
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:01.020 align:start position:0%
uh six interim study bills that we uh
 
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
put out in uh in the in last year's
 
00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:08.460 align:start position:0%
legislative session uh and we have
 
00:07:11.689 --> 00:07:11.699 align:start position:0%
one of two recommendations for each
 
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
uh each bill one is to recommend it for
 
00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
future legislation
 
00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:19.199 align:start position:0%
or not to recommend it a future
 
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:21.060 align:start position:0%
legislation which will mean that the
 
00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
bill will die
 
00:07:22.319 --> 00:07:25.029 align:start position:0%
bill will die
here

00:07:25.029 --> 00:07:25.039 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:07:27.469 --> 00:07:27.479 align:start position:0%
when we write
 
00:07:30.529 --> 00:07:30.539 align:start position:0%
the the committee reports
 
00:07:32.629 --> 00:07:32.639 align:start position:0%
sometimes known as blurbs but we'll
 
00:07:35.629 --> 00:07:35.639 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll talk about committee reports
 
00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:38.639 align:start position:0%
those reports are a little different
 
00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:41.639 align:start position:0%
than normal and that normally the
 
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
reports are written
 
00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:49.860 align:start position:0%
in a sort of partisan way by the by the
 
00:07:53.749 --> 00:07:53.759 align:start position:0%
writer uh this these reports
 
00:07:56.029 --> 00:07:56.039 align:start position:0%
there's only one report there's not a a
 
00:07:58.370 --> 00:07:58.380 align:start position:0%
minority and a majority with one report
 
00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
and and uh it should include the
 
00:08:05.089 --> 00:08:05.099 align:start position:0%
discussion or any discussion from both
 
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:07.080 align:start position:0%
sides of the aisle it should not just
 
00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh and today we have uh we'll welcome uh
 
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
representative Smith from the from the
 
00:08:20.809 --> 00:08:20.819 align:start position:0%
speaker's office and representative
 
00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:24.060 align:start position:0%
plett also uh will be substituting in
 
00:08:26.029 --> 00:08:26.039 align:start position:0%
for McBride and Air
 
00:08:28.969 --> 00:08:28.979 align:start position:0%
and I don't believe the minority has any
 
00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:31.500 align:start position:0%
substitutes today so uh
 
00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:34.260 align:start position:0%
that that's our total
 
00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:42.589 align:start position:0%
that that's our total
participation

00:08:42.589 --> 00:08:42.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:45.420 align:start position:0%
Smith is behind you
 
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.410 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:08:57.410 --> 00:08:57.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:00.769 --> 00:09:00.779 align:start position:0%
everybody uh okay uh Jimmy have your
 
00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:03.060 align:start position:0%
microphone on did you wanna
 
00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:06.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:14.820 align:start position:0%
on any of these bills right
 
00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:17.870 align:start position:0%
on any of these bills right
therefore

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:20.389 --> 00:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
are we voting again on these bills
 
00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:22.380 align:start position:0%
because there is no interim study to
 
00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:24.540 align:start position:0%
vote on no the the vote's going to be
 
00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
whether they they uh they weren't uh
 
00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:30.660 align:start position:0%
future legislation continue to work them
 
00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:34.680 align:start position:0%
or not that's it's
 
00:09:36.949 --> 00:09:36.959 align:start position:0%
basically that's the extent of the the
 
00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:38.940 align:start position:0%
vote will be taken today
 
00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:41.580 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:43.500 align:start position:0%
okay so the way we're going to start is
 
00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
going to be a little different
 
00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:45.769 align:start position:0%
going to be a little different
um

00:09:45.769 --> 00:09:45.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh some of the folks uh who haven't been
 
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
in session here since last spring uh may
 
00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:55.190 align:start position:0%
in session here since last spring uh may
have

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
forgotten a little bit about what we
 
00:09:58.670 --> 00:09:58.680 align:start position:0%
were talking about of interim study and
 
00:09:59.750 --> 00:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
everything so what we're going to do is
 
00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:02.940 align:start position:0%
I'm going to take a break for 15 minutes
 
00:10:07.009 --> 00:10:07.019 align:start position:0%
uh to to reconvene at 25 past the hour
 
00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
uh and that'll give each caucus a chance
 
00:10:12.889 --> 00:10:12.899 align:start position:0%
to privately discuss
 
00:10:15.769 --> 00:10:15.779 align:start position:0%
the six bills in front of us and any
 
00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
particular action or uh point of view
 
00:10:21.769 --> 00:10:21.779 align:start position:0%
that they may want to take so if I could
 
00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:24.959 align:start position:0%
ask Jim if you could take your group
 
00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:28.500 align:start position:0%
elsewhere we'll go and uh
 
00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:30.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr I think we'll just go
 
00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
across the hall hopefully nobody's
 
00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:33.180 align:start position:0%
across the hall we'll see you in 15
 
00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:34.980 align:start position:0%
minutes sounds good thank you please uh
 
00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:36.180 align:start position:0%
turn off your
 
00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:38.580 align:start position:0%
microphones if they happen to be on for
 
00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:40.200 align:start position:0%
the next 15 minutes
 
00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:42.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
is written in a flavor that somebody's
 
00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:50.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:54.660 align:start position:0%
no I I I disagree it has to do with the
 
00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
delegation of the powers and authorities
 
00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:01.700 align:start position:0%
of members of boards and it's it's
 
00:18:12.049 --> 00:18:12.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:13.860 align:start position:0%
well this is an important issue it
 
00:18:16.669 --> 00:18:16.679 align:start position:0%
affects it affects
 
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:22.380 align:start position:0%
different people and make a motion to
 
00:23:24.409 --> 00:23:24.419 align:start position:0%
kill it
 
00:23:24.419 --> 00:23:25.909 align:start position:0%
kill it
foreign

00:23:25.909 --> 00:23:25.919 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:23:25.919 --> 00:23:28.549 align:start position:0%
foreign
no

00:23:28.549 --> 00:23:28.559 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:44.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:50.710 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:53.580 align:start position:0%
the first time you did not think it
 
00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
should pass that's why you voted in from
 
00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:57.890 align:start position:0%
should pass that's why you voted in from
study

00:25:57.890 --> 00:25:57.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
session is on the bills since nothing
 
00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:04.260 align:start position:0%
has transpired between now and then
 
00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
it's easy to say not recommended for
 
00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:10.200 align:start position:0%
future legislation new information and a
 
00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
case has to be built for any of these
 
00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:13.380 align:start position:0%
bills to say yeah we're going to
 
00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
recommend it complete legislative that's
 
00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:17.580 align:start position:0%
that's the way it should be approaching
 
00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:19.980 align:start position:0%
so I mean if nothing has gone on
 
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
and you didn't want to pass it the last
 
00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:25.260 align:start position:0%
time of someone who wants to make the
 
00:26:27.169 --> 00:26:27.179 align:start position:0%
yes recommended they would have to build
 
00:26:33.409 --> 00:26:33.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:35.220 align:start position:0%
as you always say
 
00:26:37.549 --> 00:26:37.559 align:start position:0%
um so they we didn't
 
00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:40.200 align:start position:0%
submit committees to go ahead and study
 
00:26:40.200 --> 00:30:28.250 align:start position:0%
submit committees to go ahead and study
it

00:30:28.250 --> 00:30:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:40.730 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:40.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:46.669 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:30:46.669 --> 00:30:46.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:50.029 --> 00:30:50.039 align:start position:0%
okay we're we're back and um my
 
00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:52.860 align:start position:0%
microphone is on so we are now being
 
00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:55.320 align:start position:0%
recorded and uh
 
00:30:58.730 --> 00:30:58.740 align:start position:0%
and publicizing these uh these comments
 
00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:01.320 align:start position:0%
okay we have six interim study bills in
 
00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:04.200 align:start position:0%
front of us uh
 
00:31:07.789 --> 00:31:07.799 align:start position:0%
our Our obligation here is to recommend
 
00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
each bill for future legislation why not
 
00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:15.480 align:start position:0%
that's the the only two options we have
 
00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:19.140 align:start position:0%
and there's going to be no discussion uh
 
00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:22.440 align:start position:0%
and uh an amendments being offered on
 
00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
any of these bills
 
00:31:27.289 --> 00:31:27.299 align:start position:0%
that's the rules of the game all right
 
00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:29.100 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:31:32.269 --> 00:31:32.279 align:start position:0%
before us we the first bill is House
 
00:31:37.130 --> 00:31:37.140 align:start position:0%
Bill 132 do we have a motion
 
00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:40.500 align:start position:0%
yeah yes go ahead uh I recommend not
 
00:31:43.669 --> 00:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
recommending House Bill 132 for
 
00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:46.200 align:start position:0%
legislation prepare the legislation and
 
00:31:48.769 --> 00:31:48.779 align:start position:0%
is there a second a second
 
00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
okay representative Melvin is a
 
00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:54.889 align:start position:0%
okay representative Melvin is a
second

00:31:54.889 --> 00:31:54.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:01.549 --> 00:32:01.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:04.610 --> 00:32:04.620 align:start position:0%
you can speak to it but there is there
 
00:32:06.409 --> 00:32:06.419 align:start position:0%
is no amendment to speak no I'm not
 
00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:08.580 align:start position:0%
proposing an amendment I am proposing to
 
00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:10.440 align:start position:0%
say that I am going to vote against the
 
00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:13.020 align:start position:0%
recommendation to not file it for
 
00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
further for further uh legislation
 
00:32:18.409 --> 00:32:18.419 align:start position:0%
because I actually think this is a thing
 
00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:21.480 align:start position:0%
that we should be considering and I'd
 
00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
like to remind everyone that
 
00:32:26.029 --> 00:32:26.039 align:start position:0%
um several recent reports including one
 
00:32:28.389 --> 00:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
from The mercatus Institute listed
 
00:32:31.730 --> 00:32:31.740 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily large lot sizes in areas
 
00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:34.200 align:start position:0%
served by water and sewer as one of the
 
00:32:36.169 --> 00:32:36.179 align:start position:0%
primary drivers for housing costs I
 
00:32:38.269 --> 00:32:38.279 align:start position:0%
think it's wrong for us to say that this
 
00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:40.980 align:start position:0%
should not consider could be
 
00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:43.500 align:start position:0%
um considered in the future
 
00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:47.100 align:start position:0%
okay we we have a motion on the table to
 
00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
not recommend this for additional
 
00:32:51.769 --> 00:32:51.779 align:start position:0%
legislation uh in a second I'll also is
 
00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:54.960 align:start position:0%

it doesn't really matter because I'm
 
00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:16.380 align:start position:0%
already refiling it okay well thank you
 
00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:18.720 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chair representative here
 
00:37:38.450 --> 00:37:38.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:43.089 --> 00:37:43.099 align:start position:0%
um this is a process and I was very
 
00:37:46.970 --> 00:37:46.980 align:start position:0%
vocal about it during the discussion and
 
00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:50.940 align:start position:0%
I wanted to work on adding municipal
 
00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:55.800 align:start position:0%
waste uh management into this and I had
 
00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
reached out and never heard back so I
 
00:38:04.270 --> 00:38:04.280 align:start position:0%
feel like there was no process or the
 
00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:07.260 align:start position:0%
typical process for an interim study was
 
00:38:12.109 --> 00:38:12.119 align:start position:0%
not done and whether I vote Yes or no
 
00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:15.060 align:start position:0%
it is a mute point so I just wanted to
 
00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:17.940 align:start position:0%
make that statement in terms of what we
 
00:38:20.569 --> 00:38:20.579 align:start position:0%
are doing today
 
00:38:22.609 --> 00:38:22.619 align:start position:0%
um I know it's the chair's prerogative
 
00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:25.500 align:start position:0%
to whether have the study or not having
 
00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
put the time and effort coming here
 
00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
in representing my constituents I feel
 
00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
like I wasn't given that opportunity I
 
00:38:36.770 --> 00:38:36.780 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make a statement thank
 
00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:44.210 --> 00:38:44.220 align:start position:0%
because representative galga I I don't
 
00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:46.020 align:start position:0%
know if you would add
 
00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
uh that the public housing
 
00:38:52.069 --> 00:38:52.079 align:start position:0%
would have an input in this I don't know
 
00:38:54.589 --> 00:38:54.599 align:start position:0%
if you've checked with them or yes I've
 
00:38:58.010 --> 00:38:58.020 align:start position:0%
been trying to finish please sorry
 
00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:03.180 align:start position:0%
um that it would be more so uh
 
00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
it could be favorable to detrimental to
 
00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:06.950 align:start position:0%
it could be favorable to detrimental to
them

00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:39:10.370 --> 00:39:10.380 align:start position:0%
and I think getting their opinion uh
 
00:39:11.810 --> 00:39:11.820 align:start position:0%
whether they would want something like
 
00:39:14.690 --> 00:39:14.700 align:start position:0%
this may influence your legislation
 
00:39:17.810 --> 00:39:17.820 align:start position:0%
uh yes I've been trying to get in touch
 
00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
with my local Housing Authority but we
 
00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:22.260 align:start position:0%
haven't managed to
 
00:39:25.069 --> 00:39:25.079 align:start position:0%
uh set anything up yet
 
00:39:26.930 --> 00:39:26.940 align:start position:0%
um I was
 
00:39:29.690 --> 00:39:29.700 align:start position:0%
um as uh or rep manager who he was
 
00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:30.770 align:start position:0%
um as uh or rep manager who he was
saying

00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:30.780 align:start position:0%
saying
 
00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
um yeah I was also looking forward to
 
00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
doing actual interim study sessions
 
00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:41.160 align:start position:0%
um on this bill over the summer too and
 
00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:43.500 align:start position:0%
was hoping that if we had some we could
 
00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:44.930 align:start position:0%
was hoping that if we had some we could
have

00:39:44.930 --> 00:39:44.940 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:39:47.690 --> 00:39:47.700 align:start position:0%
um had had the public housing
 
00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
authorities come speak with us
 
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
then at one of those study sessions but
 
00:39:57.410 --> 00:39:57.420 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that didn't happen so um
 
00:39:59.810 --> 00:39:59.820 align:start position:0%
it's just I guess that's just something
 
00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
I'll have to
 
00:40:05.810 --> 00:40:05.820 align:start position:0%
keep trying to figure out for next year
 
00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:07.010 align:start position:0%
keep trying to figure out for next year
okay

00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:07.020 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:40:09.770 --> 00:40:09.780 align:start position:0%
um I have some uh some thoughts for you
 
00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:13.500 align:start position:0%
think about uh one is uh
 
00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:16.020 align:start position:0%
to in addition to if you want to
 
00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:17.640 align:start position:0%
consider legislation if you want to
 
00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
consider speaking directly with the uh
 
00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:28.740 align:start position:0%
the organization in charge of removing
 
00:40:31.849 --> 00:40:31.859 align:start position:0%
trash and garbage and so forth if they
 
00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:33.900 align:start position:0%
would uh if they feel within their
 
00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
authority to do something like this and
 
00:40:39.109 --> 00:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
the other thing is in your legislation
 
00:40:42.770 --> 00:40:42.780 align:start position:0%
uh one another way to approach this is
 
00:40:46.370 --> 00:40:46.380 align:start position:0%
to have legislation to approve a study
 
00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
Commission uh so that you're you don't
 
00:40:52.310 --> 00:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
have to rely on a committee like this to
 
00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:54.900 align:start position:0%
decide to study it the the legislation
 
00:40:57.589 --> 00:40:57.599 align:start position:0%
itself can say to study it so that's
 
00:40:59.450 --> 00:40:59.460 align:start position:0%
just a couple of thoughts to think about
 
00:41:02.270 --> 00:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
as you go forward so
 
00:41:06.050 --> 00:41:06.060 align:start position:0%
so I'm looking now for for uh the clerk
 
00:41:08.089 --> 00:41:08.099 align:start position:0%
to call a roll on the on the motion on
 
00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:11.040 align:start position:0%

uh I'm gonna
 
00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
go slow here give representative LaSalle
 
00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:46.800 align:start position:0%

committee when the bill was heard

had there been an interim study those
 
00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:19.260 align:start position:0%
could have been fleshed out far further
 
00:43:20.569 --> 00:43:20.579 align:start position:0%
and we could have been in a much
 
00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
different place today than we than we
 
00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:23.930 align:start position:0%
different place today than we than we

00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:37.200 align:start position:0%

that we were charged with uh
 
00:51:45.109 --> 00:51:45.119 align:start position:0%
with today
 
00:51:45.119 --> 00:51:46.150 align:start position:0%
with today
um

00:51:46.150 --> 00:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
before before we leave before we adjourn
 
00:51:51.890 --> 00:51:51.900 align:start position:0%
I'd like to make sure that we have the
 
00:51:54.049 --> 00:51:54.059 align:start position:0%
reports lined up to be written these
 
00:51:57.530 --> 00:51:57.540 align:start position:0%
reports yes you have a question
 
00:52:01.309 --> 00:52:01.319 align:start position:0%
I have a process question Mr chair
 
00:52:03.530 --> 00:52:03.540 align:start position:0%
um presumably a report would be written
 
00:52:06.770 --> 00:52:06.780 align:start position:0%
on the outcome of an interim study
 
00:52:09.530 --> 00:52:09.540 align:start position:0%
we have had no interim study on any of
 
00:52:10.730 --> 00:52:10.740 align:start position:0%
these bills
 
00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
despite the fact that we in the minority
 
00:52:15.890 --> 00:52:15.900 align:start position:0%
volunteered for interim study and wanted
 
00:52:18.770 --> 00:52:18.780 align:start position:0%
to to do that and the legislature voted
 
00:52:22.309 --> 00:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
to refer them for interim study what are
 
00:52:24.650 --> 00:52:24.660 align:start position:0%
we writing a report on doesn't the
 
00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
report that's already been written stand
 
00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
if there has been no interim study
 
00:52:32.990 --> 00:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
conducted the the report is different
 
00:52:36.170 --> 00:52:36.180 align:start position:0%
than the uh normal uh
 
00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:38.640 align:start position:0%
reports that we write uh that are that
 
00:52:40.609 --> 00:52:40.619 align:start position:0%
is more or less
 
00:52:42.650 --> 00:52:42.660 align:start position:0%
uh caucus
 
00:52:45.950 --> 00:52:45.960 align:start position:0%
uh intentional that this these these
 
00:52:50.569 --> 00:52:50.579 align:start position:0%
reports are more and bipartisan written
 
00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
as as to the fact that uh whether an
 
00:52:58.490 --> 00:52:58.500 align:start position:0%
interim interim study was done and
 
00:53:00.049 --> 00:53:00.059 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's recommended for a
 
00:53:03.170 --> 00:53:03.180 align:start position:0%
future legislation and and uh or not but
 
00:53:05.630 --> 00:53:05.640 align:start position:0%
an interim study was never done right
 
00:53:07.069 --> 00:53:07.079 align:start position:0%
and so that would be part of the report
 
00:53:09.829 --> 00:53:09.839 align:start position:0%
but the bill we have just voted on the
 
00:53:13.309 --> 00:53:13.319 align:start position:0%
bills as they stood because no study was
 
00:53:15.829 --> 00:53:15.839 align:start position:0%
conducted right and now now you were
 
00:53:18.170 --> 00:53:18.180 align:start position:0%
voting on the last six votes were
 
00:53:19.370 --> 00:53:19.380 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
00:53:21.410 --> 00:53:21.420 align:start position:0%
there should be continued legislation
 
00:53:23.630 --> 00:53:23.640 align:start position:0%
for this for this isn't that the end of
 
00:53:24.650 --> 00:53:24.660 align:start position:0%
the story
 
00:53:28.490 --> 00:53:28.500 align:start position:0%
right why is there a need for a report
 
00:53:31.130 --> 00:53:31.140 align:start position:0%
to explain to the to the clerk and to
 
00:53:33.950 --> 00:53:33.960 align:start position:0%
the rest of the uh the legislature as
 
00:53:36.170 --> 00:53:36.180 align:start position:0%
what we did with these bills and why we
 
00:53:37.250 --> 00:53:37.260 align:start position:0%
did it
 
00:53:39.470 --> 00:53:39.480 align:start position:0%
there was no discussion as to why we did
 
00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
what we did it was simply a state from
 
00:53:43.790 --> 00:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
from you at the opening of the meeting
 
00:53:46.309 --> 00:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
that we were not to discuss the merits
 
00:53:49.250 --> 00:53:49.260 align:start position:0%
of the bills or amend them we were only
 
00:53:52.130 --> 00:53:52.140 align:start position:0%
to vote on whether to refer them for
 
00:53:54.710 --> 00:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
future legislation or let them die a
 
00:53:56.210 --> 00:53:56.220 align:start position:0%
dignified death
 
00:53:58.370 --> 00:53:58.380 align:start position:0%
there was no discussion to report on
 
00:54:00.770 --> 00:54:00.780 align:start position:0%
yeah I I understand how you feel anyone
 
00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
else have any comments on along those
 
00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:04.370 align:start position:0%
else have any comments on along those
lines

00:54:04.370 --> 00:54:04.380 align:start position:0%
lines
 
00:54:07.549 --> 00:54:07.559 align:start position:0%
yes sir over there in Melville oh I'm
 
00:54:09.410 --> 00:54:09.420 align:start position:0%
sorry representative
 
00:54:12.130 --> 00:54:12.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I echo my colleague
 
00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:17.640 align:start position:0%
representative stavis and it just seems
 
00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:19.910 align:start position:0%
representative stavis and it just seems
um

00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:22.309 --> 00:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
what am I reporting on there's you know
 
00:54:25.069 --> 00:54:25.079 align:start position:0%
it was a study imagined Phantom study
 
00:54:27.349 --> 00:54:27.359 align:start position:0%
that showed the outcome of this Phantom
 
00:54:30.290 --> 00:54:30.300 align:start position:0%
study was a bipartisan recommendation
 
00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
now to send it forward or not when there
 
00:54:34.430 --> 00:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
was no
 
00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:35.809 align:start position:0%
was no
study

00:54:35.809 --> 00:54:35.819 align:start position:0%
study
 
00:54:39.490 --> 00:54:39.500 align:start position:0%
and so it just seems very
 
00:54:42.589 --> 00:54:42.599 align:start position:0%
ingenuous in the process of legislative
 
00:54:45.950 --> 00:54:45.960 align:start position:0%
process so
 
00:54:49.370 --> 00:54:49.380 align:start position:0%
I think it you know there's really no
 
00:54:52.609 --> 00:54:52.619 align:start position:0%
merit to what we write
 
00:54:54.890 --> 00:54:54.900 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:54:58.790 --> 00:54:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:01.370 --> 00:55:01.380 align:start position:0%
okay well I appreciate your comments Mr
 
00:55:01.380 --> 00:55:05.930 align:start position:0%
okay well I appreciate your comments Mr
Smith

00:55:05.930 --> 00:55:05.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:10.490 --> 00:55:10.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I agree that this is
 
00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
kind of a
 
00:55:14.210 --> 00:55:14.220 align:start position:0%
an odd process because even if you do
 
00:55:15.710 --> 00:55:15.720 align:start position:0%
recommend them for future legislation
 
00:55:18.109 --> 00:55:18.119 align:start position:0%
the Bill's still dead this is the end of
 
00:55:20.569 --> 00:55:20.579 align:start position:0%
the process it doesn't matter excuse me
 
00:55:21.950 --> 00:55:21.960 align:start position:0%
what you recommend
 
00:55:24.770 --> 00:55:24.780 align:start position:0%
but we do have to close the file on the
 
00:55:27.230 --> 00:55:27.240 align:start position:0%
bill this is just a pro forma thing but
 
00:55:29.450 --> 00:55:29.460 align:start position:0%
I would like to ask the chair
 
00:55:31.970 --> 00:55:31.980 align:start position:0%
when you exec these and they went on the
 
00:55:34.790 --> 00:55:34.800 align:start position:0%
house calendar as interim study and in
 
00:55:36.589 --> 00:55:36.599 align:start position:0%
those committee reports that the house
 
00:55:38.690 --> 00:55:38.700 align:start position:0%
voted on there were concerns or
 
00:55:41.329 --> 00:55:41.339 align:start position:0%
questions within that report how many
 
00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
Bill sponsors provided you answers to
 
00:55:45.589 --> 00:55:45.599 align:start position:0%
those questions and then requested that
 
00:55:47.870 --> 00:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
you hold a work session there was no
 
00:55:50.030 --> 00:55:50.040 align:start position:0%
further input Beyond
 
00:55:54.890 --> 00:55:54.900 align:start position:0%
the uh the uh a vote that we took uh in
 
00:55:57.530 --> 00:55:57.540 align:start position:0%
executive sessions thank you Mr chair I
 
00:55:59.150 --> 00:55:59.160 align:start position:0%
know that if you had interim studied one
 
00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:00.720 align:start position:0%
of my bills I would have read the
 
00:56:02.930 --> 00:56:02.940 align:start position:0%
committee's concerns I would have found
 
00:56:05.329 --> 00:56:05.339 align:start position:0%
a way to address those and once I had
 
00:56:07.670 --> 00:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
that material for you then requested
 
00:56:09.530 --> 00:56:09.540 align:start position:0%
that you hold a work session
 
00:56:11.109 --> 00:56:11.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:56:13.250 --> 00:56:13.260 align:start position:0%
probably a good lesson learned for the
 
00:56:15.410 --> 00:56:15.420 align:start position:0%
committee that if uh if that's the
 
00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
intent of individual legislators then
 
00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
that might be a recipe that we follow in
 
00:56:22.910 --> 00:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
the future
 
00:56:25.790 --> 00:56:25.800 align:start position:0%
um yes Representatives so is the
 
00:56:28.990 --> 00:56:29.000 align:start position:0%
intimation here that if a Bill's sponsor
 
00:56:32.809 --> 00:56:32.819 align:start position:0%
does not request any further information
 
00:56:34.609 --> 00:56:34.619 align:start position:0%
from a committee
 
00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
where the bill is referred for interim
 
00:56:39.410 --> 00:56:39.420 align:start position:0%
study that there is no need for interim
 
00:56:41.809 --> 00:56:41.819 align:start position:0%
study is that is that I think it's none
 
00:56:43.970 --> 00:56:43.980 align:start position:0%
not the need it's the Assumption if if
 
00:56:47.030 --> 00:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
there is no additional queries or
 
00:56:49.190 --> 00:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
requests for information then the
 
00:56:52.190 --> 00:56:52.200 align:start position:0%
assumption is that uh there's there is
 
00:56:56.450 --> 00:56:56.460 align:start position:0%
no interest in uh continuing it I I
 
00:56:58.750 --> 00:56:58.760 align:start position:0%
would think that our voters might differ
 
00:57:01.970 --> 00:57:01.980 align:start position:0%
I think our voters might want us to be
 
00:57:04.790 --> 00:57:04.800 align:start position:0%
doing what they sent us here to do which
 
00:57:07.370 --> 00:57:07.380 align:start position:0%
is to conduct interim studies on bills
 
00:57:10.089 --> 00:57:10.099 align:start position:0%
that were voted for interim study
 
00:57:13.250 --> 00:57:13.260 align:start position:0%
regardless of what the sponsor says
 
00:57:16.250 --> 00:57:16.260 align:start position:0%
the legislature voted these for interim
 
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
study not the individual sponsors
 
00:57:22.190 --> 00:57:22.200 align:start position:0%
yes representative Smith did you have
 
00:57:25.849 --> 00:57:25.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:28.809 --> 00:57:28.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:32.690 --> 00:57:32.700 align:start position:0%
okay I'll get you
 
00:57:36.170 --> 00:57:36.180 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you Mr chair not sure why
 
00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
we're having this conversation you're
 
00:57:40.010 --> 00:57:40.020 align:start position:0%
debating a house process which is a
 
00:57:41.329 --> 00:57:41.339 align:start position:0%
thing that you would take up and rules
 
00:57:43.430 --> 00:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
or what the speaker's office the U.S
 
00:57:44.690 --> 00:57:44.700 align:start position:0%
chair of the committee have no control
 
00:57:47.990 --> 00:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
over how this works and as a side note
 
00:57:49.730 --> 00:57:49.740 align:start position:0%
when we train new legislators too we
 
00:57:52.250 --> 00:57:52.260 align:start position:0%
tell them that it isn't the committee's
 
00:57:55.190 --> 00:57:55.200 align:start position:0%
job to fix your bill so I'm gonna stand
 
00:57:57.710 --> 00:57:57.720 align:start position:0%
by what I said that if you didn't pass
 
00:58:01.309 --> 00:58:01.319 align:start position:0%
my bill I would and I cared I would feel
 
00:58:03.710 --> 00:58:03.720 align:start position:0%
the compulsion to do the work and the
 
00:58:06.049 --> 00:58:06.059 align:start position:0%
responsibility for that in my 12 years
 
00:58:07.790 --> 00:58:07.800 align:start position:0%
that's kind of how it's worked
 
00:58:10.370 --> 00:58:10.380 align:start position:0%
but again if they're upset with the
 
00:58:12.349 --> 00:58:12.359 align:start position:0%
process that's something to take up when
 
00:58:13.910 --> 00:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
we vote on house rules or suggest
 
00:58:15.829 --> 00:58:15.839 align:start position:0%
changes to that because there is nothing
 
00:58:18.290 --> 00:58:18.300 align:start position:0%
that can be done for the bill today and
 
00:58:19.609 --> 00:58:19.619 align:start position:0%
one thing we're not supposed to say
 
00:58:22.069 --> 00:58:22.079 align:start position:0%
publicly there are cases to where
 
00:58:24.170 --> 00:58:24.180 align:start position:0%
interim study is referred to as death
 
00:58:25.970 --> 00:58:25.980 align:start position:0%
With Dignity for a bill
 
00:58:29.089 --> 00:58:29.099 align:start position:0%
so uh there was a good example probably
 
00:58:30.829 --> 00:58:30.839 align:start position:0%
six years ago I won't say the
 
00:58:32.270 --> 00:58:32.280 align:start position:0%
representative put the bill in but they
 
00:58:34.970 --> 00:58:34.980 align:start position:0%
wanted to do something that was nice we
 
00:58:36.349 --> 00:58:36.359 align:start position:0%
all agreed with it
 
00:58:39.049 --> 00:58:39.059 align:start position:0%
it was a good thing to do sadly it was
 
00:58:42.349 --> 00:58:42.359 align:start position:0%
mechanically impossible what they wanted
 
00:58:44.510 --> 00:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
to do was something the state agency has
 
00:58:46.130 --> 00:58:46.140 align:start position:0%
no power to do
 
00:58:48.770 --> 00:58:48.780 align:start position:0%
we didn't want to just itl it and say no
 
00:58:50.630 --> 00:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
this is not something the legislature
 
00:58:53.030 --> 00:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
should do that one went to interim study
 
00:58:55.370 --> 00:58:55.380 align:start position:0%
I talked to the bill sponsor about why
 
00:58:58.190 --> 00:58:58.200 align:start position:0%
it happened they understood and no work
 
00:58:59.809 --> 00:58:59.819 align:start position:0%
session was held and the bill was not
 
00:59:02.030 --> 00:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
recommended for future legislation
 
00:59:03.770 --> 00:59:03.780 align:start position:0%
so there are some nuances there maybe
 
00:59:05.450 --> 00:59:05.460 align:start position:0%
people care maybe they don't I don't
 
00:59:09.829 --> 00:59:09.839 align:start position:0%
know but if you don't like the process I
 
00:59:12.230 --> 00:59:12.240 align:start position:0%
don't like it either you could just as
 
00:59:14.510 --> 00:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
easily have not come in today and the
 
00:59:16.549 --> 00:59:16.559 align:start position:0%
results is the same but we're required
 
00:59:18.349 --> 00:59:18.359 align:start position:0%
to do this so if you have ideas I know
 
00:59:20.030 --> 00:59:20.040 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to hear them but this isn't
 
00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:22.440 align:start position:0%
the form to do that thank you
 
00:59:24.950 --> 00:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
representative manjapudi
 
00:59:29.390 --> 00:59:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:30.230 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:59:30.230 --> 00:59:30.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:33.770 --> 00:59:33.780 align:start position:0%
I know this is not a debate of uh the
 
00:59:36.950 --> 00:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
process and stuff but this is I'm
 
00:59:40.190 --> 00:59:40.200 align:start position:0%
finishing up my fifth term 10 years and
 
00:59:43.370 --> 00:59:43.380 align:start position:0%
uh to say that once the bill comes to
 
00:59:45.410 --> 00:59:45.420 align:start position:0%
the committee it's not the individual
 
00:59:47.390 --> 00:59:47.400 align:start position:0%
sponsors bill it's not my bill or
 
00:59:49.730 --> 00:59:49.740 align:start position:0%
somebody else who is co-sponsored with
 
00:59:52.849 --> 00:59:52.859 align:start position:0%
me I was always under you know once the
 
00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:54.240 align:start position:0%
committee takes over it's the
 
00:59:56.750 --> 00:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
committee's bill and committee makes the
 
00:59:58.849 --> 00:59:58.859 align:start position:0%
decision how it's going to go what it's
 
01:00:01.490 --> 01:00:01.500 align:start position:0%
uh you know and as a collective uh
 
01:00:04.670 --> 01:00:04.680 align:start position:0%
committee members vote on it and that's
 
01:00:07.370 --> 01:00:07.380 align:start position:0%
how it stands that's my understanding of
 
01:00:10.370 --> 01:00:10.380 align:start position:0%
the process and this time it seems like
 
01:00:13.069 --> 01:00:13.079 align:start position:0%
the whole process is all over the place
 
01:00:15.710 --> 01:00:15.720 align:start position:0%
so I don't know which way the process is
 
01:00:18.109 --> 01:00:18.119 align:start position:0%
going so that's my
 
01:00:21.049 --> 01:00:21.059 align:start position:0%
two cents and
 
01:00:23.569 --> 01:00:23.579 align:start position:0%
I'm just making a statement thank you
 
01:00:25.549 --> 01:00:25.559 align:start position:0%
thank you one last comment uh
 
01:00:26.809 --> 01:00:26.819 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher and then we're
 
01:00:28.609 --> 01:00:28.619 align:start position:0%
going to close I'm sorry um then we'll
 
01:00:30.890 --> 01:00:30.900 align:start position:0%
have representative wrong but so yeah
 
01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:32.270 align:start position:0%
have representative wrong but so yeah
just

01:00:32.270 --> 01:00:32.280 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
um for the record I do not remember
 
01:00:39.890 --> 01:00:39.900 align:start position:0%
being told that I need to ask specific
 
01:00:42.890 --> 01:00:42.900 align:start position:0%
questions after a Bill had been
 
01:00:46.190 --> 01:00:46.200 align:start position:0%
uh referred to interim study I'm a
 
01:00:50.270 --> 01:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
freshman representative here and
 
01:00:52.069 --> 01:00:52.079 align:start position:0%
um if that was in the training or
 
01:00:55.250 --> 01:00:55.260 align:start position:0%
something I must have missed it so I
 
01:00:57.349 --> 01:00:57.359 align:start position:0%
really would have been
 
01:01:01.010 --> 01:01:01.020 align:start position:0%
appreciated if I had been more informed
 
01:01:04.309 --> 01:01:04.319 align:start position:0%
ahead of time that I needed to
 
01:01:08.930 --> 01:01:08.940 align:start position:0%
ask specific questions to have as part
 
01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
of the interim study process okay
 
01:01:14.089 --> 01:01:14.099 align:start position:0%
representative run last comment thank
 
01:01:17.870 --> 01:01:17.880 align:start position:0%
you um I think if we have to do a report
 
01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
on the votes we took today I think we
 
01:01:22.730 --> 01:01:22.740 align:start position:0%
need to be honest and say there was no
 
01:01:25.190 --> 01:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
interim study but the committee voted
 
01:01:26.690 --> 01:01:26.700 align:start position:0%
these recommendations are not
 
01:01:28.549 --> 01:01:28.559 align:start position:0%
recommendations I don't want to have
 
01:01:31.490 --> 01:01:31.500 align:start position:0%
those reports reflect that there was
 
01:01:33.530 --> 01:01:33.540 align:start position:0%
study done when there wasn't study done
 
01:01:35.270 --> 01:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
I think it needs to be an accurate
 
01:01:37.569 --> 01:01:37.579 align:start position:0%
reflection of what happened
 
01:01:41.089 --> 01:01:41.099 align:start position:0%
and to get to representative Smith's
 
01:01:43.730 --> 01:01:43.740 align:start position:0%
point about death With Dignity I can't
 
01:01:45.410 --> 01:01:45.420 align:start position:0%
see how any of these bills are more
 
01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
dignified because we didn't make a
 
01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
recommendation for them to go through so
 
01:01:53.030 --> 01:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
as I said during interim study reports
 
01:01:55.730 --> 01:01:55.740 align:start position:0%
at previous executive Council executive
 
01:01:57.410 --> 01:01:57.420 align:start position:0%
sessions in the spring
 
01:02:00.410 --> 01:02:00.420 align:start position:0%
I'm a I'm generally I think I don't
 
01:02:02.089 --> 01:02:02.099 align:start position:0%
think I voted for any interim study
 
01:02:06.370 --> 01:02:06.380 align:start position:0%
because it did it it would it requires
 
01:02:08.589 --> 01:02:08.599 align:start position:0%
representatives to meet over the summer
 
01:02:11.870 --> 01:02:11.880 align:start position:0%
do study and then come back and that's
 
01:02:14.750 --> 01:02:14.760 align:start position:0%
an investment when of time and resources
 
01:02:17.329 --> 01:02:17.339 align:start position:0%
when it was very clear on at least two
 
01:02:19.490 --> 01:02:19.500 align:start position:0%
of these bills that they were not going
 
01:02:22.849 --> 01:02:22.859 align:start position:0%
to go anywhere they were uh they they
 
01:02:25.549 --> 01:02:25.559 align:start position:0%
presented conflicts and existing statute
 
01:02:28.490 --> 01:02:28.500 align:start position:0%
where the bill did not correct that in
 
01:02:30.530 --> 01:02:30.540 align:start position:0%
fact we had voted on two of these bills
 
01:02:33.230 --> 01:02:33.240 align:start position:0%
itl and if you remember the committee
 
01:02:35.569 --> 01:02:35.579 align:start position:0%
came back the next day to reconsider
 
01:02:38.270 --> 01:02:38.280 align:start position:0%
that to vote for interim study for what
 
01:02:42.289 --> 01:02:42.299 align:start position:0%
to waste our time to waste our committee
 
01:02:44.750 --> 01:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
assistance time the researchers time you
 
01:02:47.210 --> 01:02:47.220 align:start position:0%
know time is money and we've wasted a
 
01:02:49.250 --> 01:02:49.260 align:start position:0%
lot of time and money for the New
 
01:02:51.710 --> 01:02:51.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire taxpayers by going through
 
01:02:55.250 --> 01:02:55.260 align:start position:0%
this farce of thinking that we're doing
 
01:02:57.349 --> 01:02:57.359 align:start position:0%
something dignified when it does not
 
01:03:00.230 --> 01:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
nothing to me wasting resources is the
 
01:03:02.270 --> 01:03:02.280 align:start position:0%
most undignified thing we can do and
 
01:03:04.789 --> 01:03:04.799 align:start position:0%
that's what we've done today thank you
 
01:03:07.130 --> 01:03:07.140 align:start position:0%
thank you okay
 
01:03:09.770 --> 01:03:09.780 align:start position:0%
that being the last comment I think that
 
01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
we I would like to do is look at these
 
01:03:13.609 --> 01:03:13.619 align:start position:0%
six bills see if there are any
 
01:03:16.609 --> 01:03:16.619 align:start position:0%
volunteers to help write the reports
 
01:03:18.829 --> 01:03:18.839 align:start position:0%
and also give a little coaching on what
 
01:03:22.849 --> 01:03:22.859 align:start position:0%
those reports are to say in terms of uh
 
01:03:25.549 --> 01:03:25.559 align:start position:0%
again these are not partisan outputs but
 
01:03:26.950 --> 01:03:26.960 align:start position:0%
they should be
 
01:03:30.410 --> 01:03:30.420 align:start position:0%
summarized for the clerk uh in such a
 
01:03:34.370 --> 01:03:34.380 align:start position:0%
way that does not overly slant the uh
 
01:03:37.309 --> 01:03:37.319 align:start position:0%
the response to be in favor of one side
 
01:03:39.470 --> 01:03:39.480 align:start position:0%
or the other but just basically an
 
01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
observation of what we did uh with each
 
01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:43.730 align:start position:0%
