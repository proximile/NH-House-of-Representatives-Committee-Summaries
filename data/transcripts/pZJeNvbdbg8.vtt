00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 align:start position:0%
House Bill 44 relative to permissible
 
00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 align:start position:0%
residential units in a residential Zone
 
00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.249 align:start position:0%
 
second

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:34.259 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 align:start position:0%
representative Elward seconds
 
00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 align:start position:0%
representative Cahill would you like to
 
00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion
 
00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:43.380 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair
 
00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:47.699 align:start position:0%
House Bill 44 seeks to take away a lot
 
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
of local control
 
00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
zoning boards have obviously already
 
00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:54.419 align:start position:0%
established as a process which people
 
00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 align:start position:0%
can apply for what house bill 44 seeks
 
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 align:start position:0%
to do and for that reason I think that
 
00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:02.039 align:start position:0%
we should ideal it
 
00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative anybody else
 
00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:08.639 align:start position:0%
representative Gilman thank you Mr chair
 
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
uh it should be 44
 
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
provide some
 
00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.110 align:start position:0%
provide some
um

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 align:start position:0%
extra property rights it it increases
 
00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:20.360 align:start position:0%
the property rights for single family
 
00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:22.979 align:start position:0%
lots uh
 
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
there are restrictions on this um
 
00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
on the proposal that has the the units
 
00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:32.759 align:start position:0%
have to meet the setbacks whatever the
 
00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
municipality has in their zoning
 
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
ordinance and the amendment which we
 
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
haven't spoken of includes parking that
 
00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.080 align:start position:0%
parking requirements must be met and it
 
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
also changes the date of uh
 
00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:48.660 align:start position:0%
its effective date into 20. the member
 
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:50.580 align:start position:0%
will suspend we are at this point only
 
00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
talking about the the bill not the
 
00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.909 align:start position:0%
talking about the the bill not the
amendment

00:06:54.909 --> 00:06:54.919 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:57.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:06:59.450 --> 00:06:59.460 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:01.560 align:start position:0%
the positive things about this bill is
 
00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:05.580 align:start position:0%
that it will be a tool not everybody is
 
00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:08.100 align:start position:0%
going to use this tool but it will be a
 
00:07:10.309 --> 00:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
tool to provide more housing in
 
00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:13.500 align:start position:0%
communities it requires that the units
 
00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:15.660 align:start position:0%
be connected to Municipal Water and
 
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
Sewer if there is some if not
 
00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:21.300 align:start position:0%
you would stick to the regular zoning of
 
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
your municipality I know there's concern
 
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
about whether or not this will overwhelm
 
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
a municipalities Water and Sewer process
 
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
or process processing I think that there
 
00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:35.400 align:start position:0%
is a trigger point where that can be
 
00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:38.900 align:start position:0%
reviewed perhaps at the building permit
 
00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:42.120 align:start position:0%
adding units to a single-family prob
 
00:07:44.029 --> 00:07:44.039 align:start position:0%
property don't necessarily have to go
 
00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:47.460 align:start position:0%
through site plan design and review but
 
00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:50.340 align:start position:0%
if we have it as a checkpoint on the
 
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
building permits to review for the your
 
00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:55.860 align:start position:0%
water and sewer department or whoever is
 
00:07:58.790 --> 00:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
in charge of the connections then that's
 
00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:02.220 align:start position:0%
where a building could be or additional
 
00:08:04.689 --> 00:08:04.699 align:start position:0%
units can be denied based on the
 
00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:07.620 align:start position:0%
incapacity of the system to handle it
 
00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:11.340 align:start position:0%
and then the municipalities can decide
 
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:13.560 align:start position:0%
if they want to go forward and expand
 
00:08:15.969 --> 00:08:15.979 align:start position:0%
what they already have
 
00:08:19.809 --> 00:08:19.819 align:start position:0%
I think this is a good way to start
 
00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
providing the housing that this this
 
00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:25.860 align:start position:0%
state is looking for and as I said
 
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
before it expands the property rights on
 
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
a single family lots and also provide it
 
00:08:37.029 --> 00:08:37.039 align:start position:0%
could provide an income stream for those
 
00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:40.919 align:start position:0%
owners that want to stay in place age in
 
00:08:42.889 --> 00:08:42.899 align:start position:0%
place but need some income to cover
 
00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:46.020 align:start position:0%
their taxes I think there's plenty good
 
00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:48.300 align:start position:0%
about this with the restrictions that
 
00:08:50.389 --> 00:08:50.399 align:start position:0%
are very clear if your zoning ordinance
 
00:08:53.329 --> 00:08:53.339 align:start position:0%
has setbacks Etc you must comply with
 
00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
them there is no way out of that unless
 
00:08:59.949 --> 00:08:59.959 align:start position:0%
you go to the zoning board and even then
 
00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
there has to be a strong a very strong
 
00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:05.940 align:start position:0%
argument for why these additions and
 
00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
divisions should happen
 
00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Kellum
 
00:09:14.329 --> 00:09:14.339 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:20.220 align:start position:0%
I see that the that some people would
 
00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:24.660 align:start position:0%
like the local municipalities to have
 
00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:26.690 align:start position:0%
like the local municipalities to have
um

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:26.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:31.640 align:start position:0%
over uh that the state needs to um
 
00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
limit the over regulation of our housing
 
00:09:38.269 --> 00:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
and as someone that is on the housing
 
00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
board or the housing special committee
 
00:09:44.449 --> 00:09:44.459 align:start position:0%
at at the State House I think that
 
00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:46.980 align:start position:0%
housing is
 
00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:51.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:55.329 --> 00:09:55.339 align:start position:0%
reduced by municipality over regulation
 
00:09:58.009 --> 00:09:58.019 align:start position:0%
and I do agree with the previous
 
00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
representative that this is increasing
 
00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:04.580 align:start position:0%
the property rights of those the the
 
00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:06.540 align:start position:0%
individuals that we are trying to
 
00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:08.700 align:start position:0%
protect and
 
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:12.720 align:start position:0%
and serve in our communities and the
 
00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:17.100 align:start position:0%
municipality may be through honest error
 
00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:19.380 align:start position:0%
or just because they like Central
 
00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:23.700 align:start position:0%
planning are over uh regulating their
 
00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:26.820 align:start position:0%
community in and causing each Community
 
00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:29.820 align:start position:0%
is contributing to the the housing
 
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
shortage that we have and each one wants
 
00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:36.540 align:start position:0%
to claim it's everyone else and and I
 
00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:40.700 align:start position:0%
think that the state has an absolute uh
 
00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
responsibility to
 
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
ensure that that these local
 
00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:48.980 align:start position:0%
municipalities are not over regulating
 
00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:52.200 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily when uh you know there's
 
00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:55.740 align:start position:0%
uh no safety or
 
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
um or uh harm being done to uh no safety
 
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
concerns or harm being done by
 
00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
additional people living in their
 
00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
community so thank you
 
00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
representative manager booty
 
00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:13.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:14.590 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for
um

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:14.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
my two senses very similar to the
 
00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
previous two speakers this is another
 
00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:23.940 align:start position:0%
tool for in the toolbox for the
 
00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
communities to enhance or increase more
 
00:11:31.009 --> 00:11:31.019 align:start position:0%
dwellings right now when we are in
 
00:11:31.019 --> 00:11:32.150 align:start position:0%
dwellings right now when we are in
crisis

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
crisis
 
00:11:36.889 --> 00:11:36.899 align:start position:0%
and um you know somebody who's in that
 
00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
cusp of
 
00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:42.060 align:start position:0%
you know trying to downsize this gives
 
00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:44.300 align:start position:0%
an option for
 
00:11:49.069 --> 00:11:49.079 align:start position:0%
multi-generational and dwelling or stay
 
00:11:52.069 --> 00:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
an age in place it's a win-win for all
 
00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:57.200 align:start position:0%
around and I look at the support
 
00:12:02.569 --> 00:12:02.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:05.940 align:start position:0%
quite a few support except one two three
 
00:12:08.569 --> 00:12:08.579 align:start position:0%
four five six seven eight nine ten
 
00:12:11.569 --> 00:12:11.579 align:start position:0%
eleven twelve who spoke in support two
 
00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:14.940 align:start position:0%
in opposition and then sign on was 10
 
00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
support and none in opposition so we are
 
00:12:22.009 --> 00:12:22.019 align:start position:0%
really doing the work of constituents
 
00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
and what our members want to want us to
 
00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:28.860 align:start position:0%
do and this
 
00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:32.940 align:start position:0%
it very clearly states that only with
 
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
the municipal sewer and water so it's
 
00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:40.260 align:start position:0%
not adding additional burden to any
 
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
Community if it cannot take and it only
 
00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:48.180 align:start position:0%
enhances the community and I strongly
 
00:12:52.129 --> 00:12:52.139 align:start position:0%
urge that we pass this with uh ought to
 
00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:54.300 align:start position:0%
pass so
 
00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
um I will be opposing itl
 
00:12:59.329 --> 00:12:59.339 align:start position:0%
representative Howell
 
00:13:02.569 --> 00:13:02.579 align:start position:0%
so I I support this bill I think it
 
00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
really strikes a good balance between
 
00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:07.320 align:start position:0%
property owner rights and uh local
 
00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:11.160 align:start position:0%
control and by that um over regulation
 
00:13:14.389 --> 00:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
often turns uh uh this type of
 
00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:16.680 align:start position:0%
development into a no it's not even a
 
00:13:19.129 --> 00:13:19.139 align:start position:0%
conversation that you can have and that
 
00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:22.500 align:start position:0%
really impinges upon the uh the asset of
 
00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
the property owner they're not able to
 
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
maximize the value of their most
 
00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:30.180 align:start position:0%
consequential uh item and so I think uh
 
00:13:32.389 --> 00:13:32.399 align:start position:0%
the community still has the power with
 
00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:34.380 align:start position:0%
setbacks Heights and that to regulate
 
00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:36.660 align:start position:0%
but the conversation as I said changes
 
00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:39.240 align:start position:0%
from no to how does this actually fit in
 
00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:41.160 align:start position:0%
our community and I think it really
 
00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:43.260 align:start position:0%
Spurs on the planning board then to
 
00:13:45.889 --> 00:13:45.899 align:start position:0%
begin to look at local regulations and
 
00:13:47.569 --> 00:13:47.579 align:start position:0%
to think about how you can add housing
 
00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
that fits into the existing uh the
 
00:13:51.889 --> 00:13:51.899 align:start position:0%
existing community in an existing
 
00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
neighborhood so I think it's a really
 
00:13:55.009 --> 00:13:55.019 align:start position:0%
good bill and I support it
 
00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:56.600 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
00:13:59.150 --> 00:13:59.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I support the
 
00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
motion of itl because the bill has
 
00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:04.440 align:start position:0%
written it unilaterally preempts local
 
00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
land use controls and also has the
 
00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:10.860 align:start position:0%
potential to avoid local a master plans
 
00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
that towns have adopted I um
 
00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:17.820 align:start position:0%
I support these types of decisions being
 
00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
made at the local level in the local
 
00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:23.100 align:start position:0%
municipalities they are there they
 
00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:25.220 align:start position:0%
understand the the the
 
00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:27.720 align:start position:0%
I guess the lay of the land if you will
 
00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:30.540 align:start position:0%
in the municipalities and for this type
 
00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:33.240 align:start position:0%
of a decision to be made here at the
 
00:14:37.009 --> 00:14:37.019 align:start position:0%
state level I don't think it's the best
 
00:14:37.019 --> 00:14:37.670 align:start position:0%
state level I don't think it's the best
um

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
solution and additionally under current
 
00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:42.230 align:start position:0%
solution and additionally under current
rsas

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
rsas
 
00:14:46.129 --> 00:14:46.139 align:start position:0%
individuals can go before their zba and
 
00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
and ask for permission to do what this
 
00:14:50.689 --> 00:14:50.699 align:start position:0%
bill bill seeks to do and again that
 
00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
would be made at the local level not
 
00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
representative priest
 
00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:03.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I am for this bill
 
00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:08.420 align:start position:0%
and against the itl motion and I
 
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
basically agree with what has been said
 
00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
so far by all the supporters of this
 
00:15:18.889 --> 00:15:18.899 align:start position:0%
bill but I want to stress the fact that
 
00:15:21.769 --> 00:15:21.779 align:start position:0%
we have a housing crisis in New
 
00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:24.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it is affecting our Economic
 
00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:26.689 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it is affecting our Economic
Development

00:15:26.689 --> 00:15:26.699 align:start position:0%
Development
 
00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
um and none of the communities are
 
00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:33.240 align:start position:0%
really taking on the responsibility to
 
00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:35.220 align:start position:0%
address this problem
 
00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:37.820 align:start position:0%
and this problem is going to get worse
 
00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
this bill is one tool that has to happen
 
00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
and it provides
 
00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
the ability for the property owner to do
 
00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
this if he meets certain
 
00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:52.680 align:start position:0%
regulations Water and Sewer setbacks and
 
00:15:53.829 --> 00:15:53.839 align:start position:0%
all of that
 
00:15:56.569 --> 00:15:56.579 align:start position:0%
the communities are not losing their
 
00:15:59.449 --> 00:15:59.459 align:start position:0%
right they're gaining they're they're
 
00:16:02.569 --> 00:16:02.579 align:start position:0%
they're able to provide the housing to
 
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
their Workforce and to to kind of lessen
 
00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:09.480 align:start position:0%
the crisis that we have currently
 
00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative further uh
 
00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.050 align:start position:0%
thank you representative further uh
representative

00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:18.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:21.660 align:start position:0%
um so yeah I support this bill and
 
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
oppose the motion of Ito on it
 
00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:26.449 align:start position:0%
oppose the motion of Ito on it
um

00:16:26.449 --> 00:16:26.459 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:29.689 --> 00:16:29.699 align:start position:0%
some just some additional points I'd
 
00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:32.220 align:start position:0%
like to bring up as
 
00:16:34.069 --> 00:16:34.079 align:start position:0%
just a personal anecdote my brother
 
00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:38.060 align:start position:0%
lives in Portland Oregon in a fourplex
 
00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
like this type of Bill would allow by
 
00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
right and um
 
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
it's a very nice type of housing I've
 
00:16:50.569 --> 00:16:50.579 align:start position:0%
gone out to visit them and it works
 
00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
perfectly for him and his fiance and
 
00:16:56.749 --> 00:16:56.759 align:start position:0%
their current living situation
 
00:16:56.759 --> 00:16:57.530 align:start position:0%
their current living situation
um

00:16:57.530 --> 00:16:57.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:59.329 --> 00:16:59.339 align:start position:0%
and so so
 
00:17:00.949 --> 00:17:00.959 align:start position:0%
um yeah I support building more of this
 
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
type of Housing and
 
00:17:05.449 --> 00:17:05.459 align:start position:0%
um as for the bill itself
 
00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:07.740 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:17:10.549 --> 00:17:10.559 align:start position:0%
it's already
 
00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh a very compromising very much a
 
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
compromised Bill like it's watered down
 
00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:20.220 align:start position:0%
a lot from
 
00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:22.140 align:start position:0%
previous versions
 
00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:23.449 align:start position:0%
previous versions
um

00:17:23.449 --> 00:17:23.459 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:27.240 align:start position:0%
if if I had my way and
 
00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:28.429 align:start position:0%
if if I had my way and
could

00:17:28.429 --> 00:17:28.439 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:31.140 align:start position:0%
enact legislation unilaterally I would
 
00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:33.660 align:start position:0%
just say four plexes are allowed by
 
00:17:36.169 --> 00:17:36.179 align:start position:0%
right full stop and not include any of
 
00:17:36.179 --> 00:17:37.010 align:start position:0%
right full stop and not include any of
the

00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:37.020 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:17:39.289 --> 00:17:39.299 align:start position:0%
other stuff about
 
00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:41.340 align:start position:0%
having to meet parking requirements and
 
00:17:43.909 --> 00:17:43.919 align:start position:0%
whatever but
 
00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:46.140 align:start position:0%
since I'm not and we have to make
 
00:17:48.529 --> 00:17:48.539 align:start position:0%
compromises here in the legislature we
 
00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:53.580 align:start position:0%
um provisions
 
00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:57.240 align:start position:0%
so to address people's concerns about
 
00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:00.900 align:start position:0%
local control so I think that shows
 
00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:03.660 align:start position:0%
that we are taking
 
00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:07.380 align:start position:0%
those concerns seriously and I think
 
00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:08.630 align:start position:0%
those concerns seriously and I think
um

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:11.940 align:start position:0%
you know there are a lot of
 
00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:13.980 align:start position:0%
local planning boards
 
00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:16.860 align:start position:0%
out there who might be kind of
 
00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:18.350 align:start position:0%
out there who might be kind of
protesting

00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:18.360 align:start position:0%
protesting
 
00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:30.409 --> 00:18:30.419 align:start position:0%
um waiting for us to tell them to do to
 
00:18:33.289 --> 00:18:33.299 align:start position:0%
start allowing fourplexes and will be
 
00:18:36.049 --> 00:18:36.059 align:start position:0%
perfectly fine with it once we do pass
 
00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
this so
 
00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:38.150 align:start position:0%
this so
um

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:41.820 align:start position:0%
yeah I I I don't really see any
 
00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
great harms that this bill will cause I
 
00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:46.860 align:start position:0%
I think it will only be a benefit and
 
00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:54.049 --> 00:18:54.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
for the comments
 
00:18:59.150 --> 00:18:59.160 align:start position:0%
seeing that I'll make uh one I will
 
00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:02.460 align:start position:0%

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
representative manager Puti in the
 
00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:14.940 align:start position:0%

um on the remote sign-in we had 83
 
00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
support 83 signed into support uh four
 
00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:23.580 align:start position:0%
for a pose in opposition and three
 
00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:26.340 align:start position:0%
neutral and I think that these numbers
 
00:19:28.789 --> 00:19:28.799 align:start position:0%
matter thank you
 
00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:30.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:32.220 align:start position:0%
um the comment I was going to make there
 
00:19:33.409 --> 00:19:33.419 align:start position:0%
are a lot of issues that I have
 
00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
personally with the bill some of them
 
00:19:36.669 --> 00:19:36.679 align:start position:0%
have been discussed some haven't
 
00:19:39.049 --> 00:19:39.059 align:start position:0%
ultimately for me it comes down to the
 
00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
to the issue of local control this
 
00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:45.480 align:start position:0%
mandates from a top-down to these cities
 
00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:49.500 align:start position:0%
and towns that you must do this that is
 
00:19:51.169 --> 00:19:51.179 align:start position:0%
something that those cities and towns
 
00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
can do on their own without being forced
 
00:19:57.770 --> 00:19:57.780 align:start position:0%
to uh from above so I will support the
 
00:20:00.529 --> 00:20:00.539 align:start position:0%

believe the individual who made the
 
00:25:20.029 --> 00:25:20.039 align:start position:0%

representative Gilman thank you Mr chair
 
00:25:45.649 --> 00:25:45.659 align:start position:0%
I I think that the amendment further
 
00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:48.020 align:start position:0%
clarifies the
 
00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:52.740 align:start position:0%
limitation that uh each Community can or
 
00:25:56.269 --> 00:25:56.279 align:start position:0%
has or may have on the parking amount
 
00:25:59.710 --> 00:25:59.720 align:start position:0%
per dwelling unit it also expends or
 
00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:03.480 align:start position:0%
changes the enabling
 
00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:07.500 align:start position:0%
or effective date I'm sorry to uh 2024
 
00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:10.380 align:start position:0%
in order to give towns uh time to
 
00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
prepare and be ready to know the answer
 
00:26:18.049 --> 00:26:18.059 align:start position:0%
to whether they can EX
 
00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:25.789 --> 00:26:25.799 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:28.799 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um before us we
 
00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:31.020 align:start position:0%
have an amendment and I don't believe
 
00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
that all committee members have a copy
 
00:26:34.789 --> 00:26:34.799 align:start position:0%
of the amendment
 
00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:37.620 align:start position:0%
so I will not be supporting this
 
00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:40.850 align:start position:0%
so I will not be supporting this
amendment

00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:40.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:42.769 --> 00:26:42.779 align:start position:0%
representative for the comments
 
00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:46.140 align:start position:0%
representative yokella the amendment
 
00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
um was given at the hearing and
 
00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:50.100 align:start position:0%
discussed at the hearing so it is not
 
00:26:54.669 --> 00:26:54.679 align:start position:0%
the fault of the member to uh ship to
 
00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
redistribute the amendment that you
 
00:26:59.630 --> 00:26:59.640 align:start position:0%
already previously were given so I don't
 
00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:02.580 align:start position:0%
believe that is a valid criticism of the
 
00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:12.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
I believe representative yokella when we
 
00:27:19.669 --> 00:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
speak to bills or amendments we
 
00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:21.840 align:start position:0%

00:27:45.049 --> 00:27:45.059 align:start position:0%
when before the prime sponsor
 
00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
presented the bill and so we've had it

Mr chair
 
00:33:51.769 --> 00:33:51.779 align:start position:0%
um while this is a well-intentioned
 
00:33:56.090 --> 00:33:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:57.850 --> 00:33:57.860 align:start position:0%
lower income
 
00:34:01.009 --> 00:34:01.019 align:start position:0%
homeowners about the possibilities of
 
00:34:05.690 --> 00:34:05.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:09.720 align:start position:0%
you know not a rebate a waiver on the
 
00:34:11.450 --> 00:34:11.460 align:start position:0%
amount of tax they have to pay or a
 
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
waiver on their assessment
 
00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:17.220 align:start position:0%
it's it's too unwieldy it's not fair to
 
00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:19.260 align:start position:0%
towns and cities to require them to put
 
00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
this sort of information on every single
 
00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:23.869 align:start position:0%
this sort of information on every single
solitary

00:34:23.869 --> 00:34:23.879 align:start position:0%
solitary
 
00:34:23.879 --> 00:34:24.770 align:start position:0%
solitary
um

00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:24.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:27.169 --> 00:34:27.179 align:start position:0%
tax bill it also may be discriminatory
 
00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:36.349 --> 00:34:36.359 align:start position:0%
people who will be
 
00:34:36.359 --> 00:34:38.210 align:start position:0%
people who will be
labeled

00:34:38.210 --> 00:34:38.220 align:start position:0%
labeled
 
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
as low-income homeowners and that's
 
00:34:43.609 --> 00:34:43.619 align:start position:0%
that's really not fair
 
00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
um the information that people need when
 
00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:49.020 align:start position:0%
they are in a category in which they
 
00:34:51.109 --> 00:34:51.119 align:start position:0%
might receive help from the state or the
 
00:34:54.349 --> 00:34:54.359 align:start position:0%
town possibly even the community is
 
00:34:58.370 --> 00:34:58.380 align:start position:0%
readily available and If the
 
00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:01.560 align:start position:0%
sponsors of the bill would come back and
 
00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:04.020 align:start position:0%
maybe propose oh
 
00:35:06.109 --> 00:35:06.119 align:start position:0%
you know a line on a tax bill that would
 
00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:11.400 align:start position:0%
say if you need help contact XYZ program
 
00:35:14.569 --> 00:35:14.579 align:start position:0%
or community service
 
00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:16.980 align:start position:0%
that might be workable but this in its
 
00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:19.740 align:start position:0%
state is its current uh proposal is is
 
00:35:23.569 --> 00:35:23.579 align:start position:0%
not workable and it becomes here's that
 
00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:26.220 align:start position:0%
lovely word two words unfunded mandate
 
00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:29.160 align:start position:0%
because it certainly will cost person
 
00:35:33.349 --> 00:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
hours and time and materials to
 
00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:37.020 align:start position:0%
produce this information on the tax
 
00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:42.530 --> 00:35:42.540 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:35:45.349 --> 00:35:45.359 align:start position:0%

00:35:49.210 --> 00:35:49.220 align:start position:0%

motion of octopass
 
00:37:58.910 --> 00:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
and this bill will clarify the role of
 
00:38:01.970 --> 00:38:01.980 align:start position:0%
Municipal budget committee members
 
00:38:05.810 --> 00:38:05.820 align:start position:0%
it will prohibit the governing body in
 
00:38:08.450 --> 00:38:08.460 align:start position:0%
school board ex-officio members from
 
00:38:11.329 --> 00:38:11.339 align:start position:0%
being counted towards uh the required
 
00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:14.640 align:start position:0%
Quorum and from voting on matters before
 
00:38:18.050 --> 00:38:18.060 align:start position:0%
the committee and it designates that
 
00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:19.250 align:start position:0%
the committee and it designates that
these

00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:19.260 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:20.030 align:start position:0%
these
um

00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:24.109 --> 00:38:24.119 align:start position:0%
members will only serve in an in an
 
00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:27.420 align:start position:0%
advisory capacity and I am very much in
 
00:38:28.970 --> 00:38:28.980 align:start position:0%
favor of this bill
 
00:38:32.089 --> 00:38:32.099 align:start position:0%
I feel that the budget committee must be
 
00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
independent free from undue influence
 
00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:39.650 align:start position:0%
independent free from undue influence
anecdotally

00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:39.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:43.849 --> 00:38:43.859 align:start position:0%
my Town's elected or official budget
 
00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:47.640 align:start position:0%
committee has a selectman who serves and
 
00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:48.710 align:start position:0%
committee has a selectman who serves and
votes

00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:48.720 align:start position:0%
votes
 
00:38:51.950 --> 00:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
and I feel that um this person is very
 
00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:53.390 align:start position:0%
and I feel that um this person is very
strong-willed

00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:53.400 align:start position:0%
strong-willed
 
00:38:57.290 --> 00:38:57.300 align:start position:0%
that we can't communicate directly with
 
00:38:59.329 --> 00:38:59.339 align:start position:0%
the budget committee we have to funnel
 
00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
all our information and inquiries
 
00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
through the select board
 
00:39:06.349 --> 00:39:06.359 align:start position:0%
and I just think that
 
00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:10.440 align:start position:0%
um I'm agreeing with the phrase taking
 
00:39:12.370 --> 00:39:12.380 align:start position:0%
two bites at the Apple
 
00:39:16.370 --> 00:39:16.380 align:start position:0%
stacking the deck and that we need to
 
00:39:20.329 --> 00:39:20.339 align:start position:0%
let our budget committee Members Own the
 
00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:22.140 align:start position:0%
budget thank you
 
00:39:23.930 --> 00:39:23.940 align:start position:0%

00:39:35.210 --> 00:39:35.220 align:start position:0%
says that this is proposed as OTP slash
 
00:39:39.349 --> 00:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
a uh is there an amendment sir
 
00:39:42.589 --> 00:39:42.599 align:start position:0%
we have we have it as OTP without an
 
00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:45.540 align:start position:0%
amendment we were told that there might
 
00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
be an amendment to correct a single word
 
00:39:50.450 --> 00:39:50.460 align:start position:0%
but we do not have an amendment so it's
 
00:39:52.130 --> 00:39:52.140 align:start position:0%
just OTP thank you for your answer
 
00:39:53.450 --> 00:39:53.460 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
00:39:56.210 --> 00:39:56.220 align:start position:0%
representative majori thank you Mr chair
 
00:39:59.690 --> 00:39:59.700 align:start position:0%
I'm going to oppose the the OTP as
 
00:40:01.490 --> 00:40:01.500 align:start position:0%
um I have been the select board
 
00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
representative to the budget committee
 
00:40:04.490 --> 00:40:04.500 align:start position:0%
I've chaired the budget committee I
 
00:40:06.829 --> 00:40:06.839 align:start position:0%
still serve on the on the select board
 
00:40:10.970 --> 00:40:10.980 align:start position:0%
when my select board finishes with its
 
00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:13.320 align:start position:0%
budget we hand that budget to our
 
00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:15.660 align:start position:0%
official budget committee it is no
 
00:40:18.349 --> 00:40:18.359 align:start position:0%
longer the select board budget it is the
 
00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
municipal but the official Municipal
 
00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:23.640 align:start position:0%
budget committee budget same thing
 
00:40:26.089 --> 00:40:26.099 align:start position:0%
happens with the school side they hand
 
00:40:27.410 --> 00:40:27.420 align:start position:0%
their budget to the budget committee
 
00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
it's the official school it's the
 
00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
official Municipal budget committee
 
00:40:35.150 --> 00:40:35.160 align:start position:0%
budget and the budget committee can make
 
00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
any small change could make any
 
00:40:40.130 --> 00:40:40.140 align:start position:0%
Draconian change they are certainly
 
00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
within their rights to do that and I
 
00:40:45.950 --> 00:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
feel that it is very important that the
 
00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:48.060 align:start position:0%
the select board and School Board
 
00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
representative to the budget committee
 
00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:51.170 align:start position:0%
representative to the budget committee
retain

00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:51.180 align:start position:0%
retain
 
00:40:54.109 --> 00:40:54.119 align:start position:0%
their ability their full ability to vote
 
00:40:57.109 --> 00:40:57.119 align:start position:0%
on whatever amendments happen and
 
00:40:59.870 --> 00:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
whatever changes happen to that budget
 
00:41:01.730 --> 00:41:01.740 align:start position:0%
to the extent that you're getting two
 
00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
bites of the Apple everybody who serves
 
00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
on a select board or budget committee
 
00:41:09.109 --> 00:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
gets multiple bites of the Apple because
 
00:41:11.690 --> 00:41:11.700 align:start position:0%
they vote on that budget then they go to
 
00:41:13.849 --> 00:41:13.859 align:start position:0%
their election and they vote we're all
 
00:41:16.010 --> 00:41:16.020 align:start position:0%
getting multiple bites of the Apple
 
00:41:18.170 --> 00:41:18.180 align:start position:0%
we're doing it in the way that statute
 
00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:21.180 align:start position:0%
provides and and I think that that is
 
00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:23.220 align:start position:0%
it's critically important that you allow
 
00:41:26.329 --> 00:41:26.339 align:start position:0%
people to retain their rights to make
 
00:41:28.609 --> 00:41:28.619 align:start position:0%
decisions on multi-million dollar
 
00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:30.300 align:start position:0%
Appropriations for each one of their
 
00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:32.220 align:start position:0%
towns thank you Mr chair
 
00:41:35.569 --> 00:41:35.579 align:start position:0%
thank you oops uh representative Kellogg
 
00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:37.020 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
um I agree with the previous speaker
 
00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:41.940 align:start position:0%
that currently it is allowed that they
 
00:41:43.970 --> 00:41:43.980 align:start position:0%
can have multiple bites of the apple and
 
00:41:46.490 --> 00:41:46.500 align:start position:0%
I agree with the sentiment that we
 
00:41:49.069 --> 00:41:49.079 align:start position:0%
should remove that statutory right of
 
00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:51.420 align:start position:0%
multiple bites at the Apple for the um
 
00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
for the selectmin and and uh School
 
00:41:58.069 --> 00:41:58.079 align:start position:0%
Board to
 
00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:01.260 align:start position:0%
um try and influence the the will of the
 
00:42:03.050 --> 00:42:03.060 align:start position:0%
budget committee
 
00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
um I believe that they do once the
 
00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
budget committee
 
00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
um makes in in my town at least once the
 
00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
budget committee makes the changes the
 
00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:17.829 align:start position:0%
budget committee makes the changes the
the

00:42:17.829 --> 00:42:17.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:21.180 align:start position:0%
Selectmen and the school boards both
 
00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:23.640 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to vote whether or
 
00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:26.220 align:start position:0%
not they recommend that uh those changes
 
00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:29.160 align:start position:0%
to the voters on the actual ballot and
 
00:42:31.609 --> 00:42:31.619 align:start position:0%
it says three you know in my town
 
00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:33.480 align:start position:0%
there's three Selectmen three Selectmen
 
00:42:37.390 --> 00:42:37.400 align:start position:0%
don't uh recommend this these changes
 
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
and in on our ballot there um you know
 
00:42:46.930 --> 00:42:46.940 align:start position:0%
there's uh this the budget the school uh
 
00:42:51.010 --> 00:42:51.020 align:start position:0%
board is able to do that same uh
 
00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
conveyance to the to the um
 
00:42:59.089 --> 00:42:59.099 align:start position:0%
to the voters of the town to say we may
 
00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:01.140 align:start position:0%
or may not agree with the rec uh the
 
00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:03.200 align:start position:0%
changes that the budget committee made
 
00:43:08.089 --> 00:43:08.099 align:start position:0%
and I uh think that it is a little bit
 
00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:11.700 align:start position:0%
confusing to the budget to the voters to
 
00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
see for example 3-0 and then a 5-2
 
00:43:20.809 --> 00:43:20.819 align:start position:0%
um and not being aware that some of
 
00:43:23.690 --> 00:43:23.700 align:start position:0%
those people are counted the same that
 
00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
same person is counted twice in in those
 
00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
numbers and so
 
00:43:30.170 --> 00:43:30.180 align:start position:0%
um I think that there should they should
 
00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:33.720 align:start position:0%
only be uh displayed once to the voters
 
00:43:37.370 --> 00:43:37.380 align:start position:0%
that vote and so I will be voting in in
 
00:43:39.109 --> 00:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
support of this motion thank you thank
 
00:43:40.250 --> 00:43:40.260 align:start position:0%
you representative representative
 
00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:41.809 align:start position:0%
you representative representative
Holland

00:43:41.809 --> 00:43:41.819 align:start position:0%
Holland
 
00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
so I'll State the obvious it's it's
 
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
always hard to pass a budget and I
 
00:43:48.589 --> 00:43:48.599 align:start position:0%
always thought it would be easier but it
 
00:43:51.109 --> 00:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
never is and so the most frustrating
 
00:43:54.109 --> 00:43:54.119 align:start position:0%
part about uh working on a budget is
 
00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
having people disagree with you
 
00:43:58.069 --> 00:43:58.079 align:start position:0%
particularly when you think your idea is
 
00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
better than theirs and so I think the
 
00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
Temptation is to either ignore what
 
00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:06.660 align:start position:0%
they're saying or even remove their
 
00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
voice remove their votes so that it
 
00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
makes it easier to get what I want and I
 
00:44:13.069 --> 00:44:13.079 align:start position:0%
think that really harms the budget
 
00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:15.900 align:start position:0%
process I think what the concerns that
 
00:44:18.349 --> 00:44:18.359 align:start position:0%
were spoken to here actually are not
 
00:44:20.569 --> 00:44:20.579 align:start position:0%
actually the statutory budget committee
 
00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
composition it's the actual budget
 
00:44:25.849 --> 00:44:25.859 align:start position:0%
process and I was the chair of a
 
00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:29.400 align:start position:0%
advisory not a statutory and it's why I
 
00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
was so obsessed with process I think you
 
00:44:35.390 --> 00:44:35.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned really uh a good point was
 
00:44:36.890 --> 00:44:36.900 align:start position:0%
that you had to funnel all your
 
00:44:38.930 --> 00:44:38.940 align:start position:0%
information through one person and
 
00:44:40.609 --> 00:44:40.619 align:start position:0%
therefore when you got to the really
 
00:44:43.370 --> 00:44:43.380 align:start position:0%
really hard part of the budget that last
 
00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:45.060 align:start position:0%
half a percent that really is
 
00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
consequential it was really challenging
 
00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:50.640 align:start position:0%
to make a decision and so therefore it's
 
00:44:53.930 --> 00:44:53.940 align:start position:0%
really incumbent on the process to
 
00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
include the statutory budget process uh
 
00:45:00.410 --> 00:45:00.420 align:start position:0%
committee uh in the uh forming of the
 
00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
budget and throughout the entire process
 
00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
so that you have the information that
 
00:45:06.829 --> 00:45:06.839 align:start position:0%
you need why did you set this budget
 
00:45:09.589 --> 00:45:09.599 align:start position:0%
goal what are the priorities of your
 
00:45:12.109 --> 00:45:12.119 align:start position:0%
budget what tools do you use to overcome
 
00:45:14.390 --> 00:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
I mean I've heard the term cut but is it
 
00:45:16.609 --> 00:45:16.619 align:start position:0%
like a deferred maintenance is it a
 
00:45:19.069 --> 00:45:19.079 align:start position:0%
retired incentive am I shifting money
 
00:45:22.130 --> 00:45:22.140 align:start position:0%
from one line to another I think there's
 
00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:24.720 align:start position:0%
multiple changes that occur as it moves
 
00:45:27.050 --> 00:45:27.060 align:start position:0%
either through the municipal side or the
 
00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
school side and so it's really important
 
00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
that the budget committee has seen all
 
00:45:34.130 --> 00:45:34.140 align:start position:0%
those changes and understands the those
 
00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:36.720 align:start position:0%
changes so that when the budget is
 
00:45:39.410 --> 00:45:39.420 align:start position:0%
presented to you that you're able to
 
00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:41.400 align:start position:0%
make the really difficult decisions and
 
00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:45.540 align:start position:0%
so I think this really sets up sb2 towns
 
00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:47.640 align:start position:0%
for some real Conflict at the
 
00:45:50.809 --> 00:45:50.819 align:start position:0%
deliberative session because there the
 
00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
voters will get they get two bites as
 
00:45:54.829 --> 00:45:54.839 align:start position:0%
well right they get a chance at the
 
00:45:56.329 --> 00:45:56.339 align:start position:0%
deliberative session to make changes
 
00:45:58.670 --> 00:45:58.680 align:start position:0%
that you had and they get a chance to
 
00:46:01.550 --> 00:46:01.560 align:start position:0%
vote on the budget and so I think having
 
00:46:03.589 --> 00:46:03.599 align:start position:0%
a really coherent thought through
 
00:46:05.210 --> 00:46:05.220 align:start position:0%
strategy as you approach the
 
00:46:07.970 --> 00:46:07.980 align:start position:0%
deliberative session is really to the
 
00:46:09.710 --> 00:46:09.720 align:start position:0%
advantage of municipality so I think
 
00:46:12.530 --> 00:46:12.540 align:start position:0%
this is a bad idea and I oppose it
 
00:46:14.270 --> 00:46:14.280 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:16.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I I would like to
 
00:46:18.290 --> 00:46:18.300 align:start position:0%
bring the focus
 
00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:19.010 align:start position:0%
bring the focus
um

00:46:19.010 --> 00:46:19.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:21.770 --> 00:46:21.780 align:start position:0%
of this bill you know back into the
 
00:46:25.250 --> 00:46:25.260 align:start position:0%
center and it pertains to the powers of
 
00:46:29.089 --> 00:46:29.099 align:start position:0%
elected officials and not so much a
 
00:46:30.950 --> 00:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
budget process
 
00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:33.480 align:start position:0%
and the powers of these elected fish
 
00:46:35.870 --> 00:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
officials has to do with their ability
 
00:46:39.190 --> 00:46:39.200 align:start position:0%
to vote so
 
00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:42.540 align:start position:0%
voters in in a municipality they vote
 
00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
for officials to be on a governing body
 
00:46:50.270 --> 00:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
be it a select board or school board or
 
00:46:51.589 --> 00:46:51.599 align:start position:0%
budget committee
 
00:46:51.599 --> 00:46:53.089 align:start position:0%
budget committee
and

00:46:53.089 --> 00:46:53.099 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:46:53.099 --> 00:46:58.069 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:46:58.069 --> 00:46:58.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:01.370 --> 00:47:01.380 align:start position:0%
there's a reason why a person cannot be
 
00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
elected to both say for example a school
 
00:47:08.210 --> 00:47:08.220 align:start position:0%
board and the budget committee
 
00:47:11.210 --> 00:47:11.220 align:start position:0%
you can only be elected and sit on one
 
00:47:13.309 --> 00:47:13.319 align:start position:0%
so I think that that should be the focus
 
00:47:15.650 --> 00:47:15.660 align:start position:0%
and and therefore if voters elect
 
00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
somebody to be on the governing body
 
00:47:21.829 --> 00:47:21.839 align:start position:0%
I they should not have the the power and
 
00:47:24.349 --> 00:47:24.359 align:start position:0%
the authority to vote both on the
 
00:47:30.170 --> 00:47:30.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
if they were appointed
 
00:47:35.569 --> 00:47:35.579 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't then be able to vote on
 
00:47:39.829 --> 00:47:39.839 align:start position:0%
the school board or the budget committee
 
00:47:42.589 --> 00:47:42.599 align:start position:0%
and furthermore with regard to the
 
00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:51.170 --> 00:47:51.180 align:start position:0%
that has to do with the position being
 
00:47:56.030 --> 00:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
on being elected to a a position a
 
00:47:58.849 --> 00:47:58.859 align:start position:0%
governing body position a school board
 
00:48:01.690 --> 00:48:01.700 align:start position:0%
position and a budget committee position
 
00:48:05.089 --> 00:48:05.099 align:start position:0%
when they get to vote again they're
 
00:48:07.250 --> 00:48:07.260 align:start position:0%
they're functioning as a member of the
 
00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:09.720 align:start position:0%
legislative body voting on The matters
 
00:48:12.109 --> 00:48:12.119 align:start position:0%
before them in the warrant so I see that
 
00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:15.960 align:start position:0%
as two different functions thank you
 
00:48:18.290 --> 00:48:18.300 align:start position:0%
representative Gilman
 
00:48:20.750 --> 00:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair one thing I would
 
00:48:23.530 --> 00:48:23.540 align:start position:0%
like to bring up is that on any board
 
00:48:26.089 --> 00:48:26.099 align:start position:0%
committee or commission such as this
 
00:48:28.910 --> 00:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
committee members speak in favor or
 
00:48:31.790 --> 00:48:31.800 align:start position:0%
opposed to parts of the budget or the
 
00:48:33.829 --> 00:48:33.839 align:start position:0%
total of the budget you know what what
 
00:48:35.930 --> 00:48:35.940 align:start position:0%
they're looking at and it's possible
 
00:48:39.349 --> 00:48:39.359 align:start position:0%
that a member of of a committee can
 
00:48:42.770 --> 00:48:42.780 align:start position:0%
persuade one of those uh one of the
 
00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
folks that were that this bill is trying
 
00:48:47.569 --> 00:48:47.579 align:start position:0%
to exclude to change their mind about
 
00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
what they've done or change their mind
 
00:48:51.050 --> 00:48:51.060 align:start position:0%
you know on the school board budget
 
00:48:53.470 --> 00:48:53.480 align:start position:0%
versus the um
 
00:48:56.930 --> 00:48:56.940 align:start position:0%
uh Municipal budget so I think there's
 
00:49:00.109 --> 00:49:00.119 align:start position:0%
an opportunity for
 
00:49:03.650 --> 00:49:03.660 align:start position:0%
these members to retain uh their voting
 
00:49:05.710 --> 00:49:05.720 align:start position:0%
status because there's an opportunity
 
00:49:09.950 --> 00:49:09.960 align:start position:0%
for the discussion to be uh to change
 
00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
and be persuadable and the other aspect
 
00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
of this is that we often hear bills that
 
00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:18.770 align:start position:0%
of this is that we often hear bills that
are

00:49:18.770 --> 00:49:18.780 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:20.089 align:start position:0%
are
um

00:49:20.089 --> 00:49:20.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
what's the word I want generated from a
 
00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
problem in one town and we have seen
 
00:49:28.010 --> 00:49:28.020 align:start position:0%
this bill before and we have seen the
 
00:49:30.309 --> 00:49:30.319 align:start position:0%
same proponent come to us with the same
 
00:49:35.089 --> 00:49:35.099 align:start position:0%
argument and to carry the Apple analogy
 
00:49:38.390 --> 00:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
I would like to say that One Bad Apple
 
00:49:40.849 --> 00:49:40.859 align:start position:0%
should not spoil the whole State's
 
00:49:40.859 --> 00:49:42.290 align:start position:0%
should not spoil the whole State's
Barrel

00:49:42.290 --> 00:49:42.300 align:start position:0%
Barrel
 
00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:49:45.829 --> 00:49:45.839 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:49:51.530 --> 00:49:51.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:55.010 --> 00:49:55.020 align:start position:0%
to me this this bill should be called
 
00:49:59.569 --> 00:49:59.579 align:start position:0%
the budget committee Independence bill
 
00:49:59.579 --> 00:50:00.410 align:start position:0%
the budget committee Independence bill
um

00:50:00.410 --> 00:50:00.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:02.569 --> 00:50:02.579 align:start position:0%
in in my town
 
00:50:06.050 --> 00:50:06.060 align:start position:0%
the budget committee is held in very
 
00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
high esteem
 
00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
by the voters
 
00:50:12.410 --> 00:50:12.420 align:start position:0%
so many times
 
00:50:16.930 --> 00:50:16.940 align:start position:0%
the the people follow
 
00:50:19.790 --> 00:50:19.800 align:start position:0%
the recommendation of the budget
 
00:50:24.410 --> 00:50:24.420 align:start position:0%
committee uh a lot more than they do the
 
00:50:27.950 --> 00:50:27.960 align:start position:0%
Selectmen or the school board
 
00:50:30.589 --> 00:50:30.599 align:start position:0%
I'd like to reiterate what the vice
 
00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
chairman said is that there's nothing to
 
00:50:37.609 --> 00:50:37.619 align:start position:0%
keep me I'm going to look elected
 
00:50:40.849 --> 00:50:40.859 align:start position:0%
select then I'm also an elected State
 
00:50:43.790 --> 00:50:43.800 align:start position:0%
Rep I could be an elected School Board
 
00:50:45.710 --> 00:50:45.720 align:start position:0%
member also
 
00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
but I cannot
 
00:50:52.730 --> 00:50:52.740 align:start position:0%
be if I'm any of those things I cannot
 
00:50:55.250 --> 00:50:55.260 align:start position:0%
be an elected member of the budget
 
00:50:58.910 --> 00:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
committee and I think that's
 
00:51:04.370 --> 00:51:04.380 align:start position:0%
on purpose and I think it's uh a very
 
00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:07.020 align:start position:0%
powerful tool
 
00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
um so when the budget committee does
 
00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
their deliberation on the town budget or
 
00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
the School District budget
 
00:51:21.109 --> 00:51:21.119 align:start position:0%
they need to have that Independence
 
00:51:25.730 --> 00:51:25.740 align:start position:0%
to make their deliberations and come out
 
00:51:28.089 --> 00:51:28.099 align:start position:0%
with their recommendation
 
00:51:33.770 --> 00:51:33.780 align:start position:0%
that the townspeople can then get behind
 
00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
having elected members
 
00:51:42.589 --> 00:51:42.599 align:start position:0%
uh of the selectman and the school board
 
00:51:45.370 --> 00:51:45.380 align:start position:0%
pollutes that Independence
 
00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
and I feel I'm I'm
 
00:51:54.130 --> 00:51:54.140 align:start position:0%
in support of this bill for that reason
 
00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to make a lot of people
 
00:52:00.670 --> 00:52:00.680 align:start position:0%
mad a lot of people that I respect are
 
00:52:04.549 --> 00:52:04.559 align:start position:0%
disappointed in that but I I feel that
 
00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
it's important that we maintain the
 
00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
independence of the budget committee so
 
00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
I will support this thank you
 
00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:14.569 align:start position:0%
I will support this thank you
representative

00:52:14.569 --> 00:52:14.579 align:start position:0%

allowing me to speak again
 
00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:22.670 align:start position:0%
allowing me to speak again
um

00:52:22.670 --> 00:52:22.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
I uh another huge issue that I have with
 
00:52:28.370 --> 00:52:28.380 align:start position:0%
this we're talking about I my friend
 
00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
from Litchfield who I have the most
 
00:52:31.609 --> 00:52:31.619 align:start position:0%
respect for
 
00:52:35.450 --> 00:52:35.460 align:start position:0%
um uh I hope so I do and you know that
 
00:52:37.130 --> 00:52:37.140 align:start position:0%
you know that
 
00:52:37.140 --> 00:52:37.970 align:start position:0%
you know that
um

00:52:37.970 --> 00:52:37.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:39.710 --> 00:52:39.720 align:start position:0%
this you're talking about the
 
00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:40.970 align:start position:0%
this you're talking about the
independence

00:52:40.970 --> 00:52:40.980 align:start position:0%
independence
 
00:52:44.990 --> 00:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
this bill completely neuters the role of
 
00:52:46.910 --> 00:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
the select board the ex-officio member
 
00:52:49.549 --> 00:52:49.559 align:start position:0%
on the budget committee by not even
 
00:52:51.770 --> 00:52:51.780 align:start position:0%
allowing that person to count towards a
 
00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
quorum so I'm not even sure if I were
 
00:52:55.609 --> 00:52:55.619 align:start position:0%
that person elected to the or or
 
00:52:57.230 --> 00:52:57.240 align:start position:0%
representing the budget committee I
 
00:52:59.210 --> 00:52:59.220 align:start position:0%
wouldn't even go I wouldn't why would I
 
00:53:01.609 --> 00:53:01.619 align:start position:0%
go I don't count towards a quorum and I
 
00:53:02.690 --> 00:53:02.700 align:start position:0%
can't vote
 
00:53:05.630 --> 00:53:05.640 align:start position:0%
so I'm not even sure what my influence
 
00:53:07.849 --> 00:53:07.859 align:start position:0%
would be I would I would fight tooth and
 
00:53:09.650 --> 00:53:09.660 align:start position:0%
nail and I think that would then be a
 
00:53:11.930 --> 00:53:11.940 align:start position:0%
conflict I think this bill sets up more
 
00:53:14.510 --> 00:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
conflict than it does but to the point
 
00:53:16.849 --> 00:53:16.859 align:start position:0%
where I think it was representative
 
00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
Hicks said a little while ago yes
 
00:53:22.010 --> 00:53:22.020 align:start position:0%
um I think that the budget process
 
00:53:24.049 --> 00:53:24.059 align:start position:0%
should be the most Co-op oh Helen I'm
 
00:53:24.059 --> 00:53:25.130 align:start position:0%
should be the most Co-op oh Helen I'm
sorry

00:53:25.130 --> 00:53:25.140 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:53:27.230 --> 00:53:27.240 align:start position:0%
I think the budget process should be
 
00:53:30.170 --> 00:53:30.180 align:start position:0%
incredibly Cooperative but it is at
 
00:53:32.210 --> 00:53:32.220 align:start position:0%
times adversarial and I and I absolutely
 
00:53:34.190 --> 00:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
get that but I still can't support this
 
00:53:36.049 --> 00:53:36.059 align:start position:0%
bill sorry representative thank you

00:54:51.770 --> 00:54:51.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Clerk so where we're at
 
00:54:54.890 --> 00:54:54.900 align:start position:0%
here there we can always
 
00:54:57.349 --> 00:54:57.359 align:start position:0%
entertain another motion I believe we
 
00:54:59.510 --> 00:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
know we're probably all for the Motions
 
00:55:01.309 --> 00:55:01.319 align:start position:0%
are going to go so we can either
 
00:55:03.710 --> 00:55:03.720 align:start position:0%
continue down that path or we can send
 
00:55:05.809 --> 00:55:05.819 align:start position:0%
this to the
 
00:55:05.819 --> 00:55:06.589 align:start position:0%
this to the
um

00:55:06.589 --> 00:55:06.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:08.270 --> 00:55:08.280 align:start position:0%
to the calendar
 
00:55:10.210 --> 00:55:10.220 align:start position:0%
without recommendation
 
00:55:14.510 --> 00:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
so are there any further motions Mr
 
00:55:18.470 --> 00:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
chairman yes sir I make a motion that we
 
00:55:19.670 --> 00:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
send it to the floor without
 
00:55:22.010 --> 00:55:22.020 align:start position:0%
recommendation that I don't think that's
 
00:55:24.650 --> 00:55:24.660 align:start position:0%
a motion that we entertain in this oh
 
00:55:24.660 --> 00:55:26.510 align:start position:0%
a motion that we entertain in this oh
buddy

00:55:26.510 --> 00:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
buddy
 
00:55:29.089 --> 00:55:29.099 align:start position:0%
the only point in my comment was I
 
00:55:30.950 --> 00:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
believe if we start making other motions
 
00:55:32.750 --> 00:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to end up the same place we
 
00:55:34.849 --> 00:55:34.859 align:start position:0%
are and it'll eventually go to the floor
 
00:55:38.210 --> 00:55:38.220 align:start position:0%
that way so do I hear any other motions
 
00:55:40.549 --> 00:55:40.559 align:start position:0%
seeing none this will go to the floor
 
00:55:43.210 --> 00:55:43.220 align:start position:0%
without recommendation uh representative
 
00:55:45.710 --> 00:55:45.720 align:start position:0%

session on 483 and open up exec session

Belknap County officers
 
00:58:39.470 --> 00:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
do I have a motion on that
 
00:58:41.270 --> 00:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
representative yakella
 
00:58:49.069 --> 00:58:49.079 align:start position:0%
I yes I make a motion to itl HB 357.
 
00:58:50.750 --> 00:58:50.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative seconded by
 
00:58:52.970 --> 00:58:52.980 align:start position:0%
representative power representative
 
00:58:56.089 --> 00:58:56.099 align:start position:0%
calorie do you like to speak yes
 
00:58:58.970 --> 00:58:58.980 align:start position:0%
um I disagree with the idea that we
 
00:59:01.010 --> 00:59:01.020 align:start position:0%
should have
 
00:59:04.430 --> 00:59:04.440 align:start position:0%
um different uh term lengths for
 
00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
different counties and
 
00:59:11.450 --> 00:59:11.460 align:start position:0%
um in general I think that the uh that
 
00:59:13.789 --> 00:59:13.799 align:start position:0%
there's no good reason for us to
 
00:59:16.970 --> 00:59:16.980 align:start position:0%
continue down the path of of increasing
 
00:59:20.450 --> 00:59:20.460 align:start position:0%
the terms from four years to to uh from
 
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:22.140 align:start position:0%
two years to four years I don't think
 
00:59:23.450 --> 00:59:23.460 align:start position:0%
that they
 
00:59:25.130 --> 00:59:25.140 align:start position:0%
um that the voters should have any less
 
00:59:28.250 --> 00:59:28.260 align:start position:0%
oversight over these uh County officers
 
00:59:30.170 --> 00:59:30.180 align:start position:0%
than they have over the governor or the
 
00:59:32.750 --> 00:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
state reps or anyone else so for those
 
00:59:37.069 --> 00:59:37.079 align:start position:0%
reasons I uh make the motion thank you
 
00:59:39.069 --> 00:59:39.079 align:start position:0%
thank you representative as a further
 
00:59:41.770 --> 00:59:41.780 align:start position:0%
comments questions
 
00:59:44.809 --> 00:59:44.819 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher
 
00:59:49.370 --> 00:59:49.380 align:start position:0%
um so I would agree that
 
00:59:49.380 --> 00:59:50.030 align:start position:0%
um so I would agree that
um

00:59:50.030 --> 00:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:53.390 --> 00:59:53.400 align:start position:0%
yes we should be uh
 
00:59:53.400 --> 00:59:55.970 align:start position:0%
yes we should be uh
doing

00:59:55.970 --> 00:59:55.980 align:start position:0%
doing
 
00:59:58.370 --> 00:59:58.380 align:start position:0%
that we should be treating the counties
 
01:00:02.750 --> 01:00:02.760 align:start position:0%
the same but the last time we tried that
 
01:00:06.589 --> 01:00:06.599 align:start position:0%
it got pulled from consent and then
 
01:00:08.569 --> 01:00:08.579 align:start position:0%
stopped so
 
01:00:08.579 --> 01:00:09.289 align:start position:0%
stopped so
um

01:00:09.289 --> 01:00:09.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:10.910 --> 01:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
I think
 
01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:13.609 align:start position:0%
I think
that

01:00:13.609 --> 01:00:13.619 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:00:13.619 --> 01:00:14.270 align:start position:0%
that
um

01:00:14.270 --> 01:00:14.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
that that just shows that a bill to
 
01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:19.250 align:start position:0%
that that just shows that a bill to
do

01:00:19.250 --> 01:00:19.260 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:20.030 align:start position:0%
do
um

01:00:20.030 --> 01:00:20.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:21.890 --> 01:00:21.900 align:start position:0%
to change them all simultaneously
 
01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
wouldn't really work so
 
01:00:26.930 --> 01:00:26.940 align:start position:0%
um I think instead
 
01:00:29.690 --> 01:00:29.700 align:start position:0%
we're just going to have to continue it
 
01:00:35.329 --> 01:00:35.339 align:start position:0%
in this uh piecemeal way of trading
 
01:00:38.569 --> 01:00:38.579 align:start position:0%
um each County separately and so I'll be
 
01:00:41.210 --> 01:00:41.220 align:start position:0%
opposing the motion of Ito thank you
 
01:00:42.410 --> 01:00:42.420 align:start position:0%
representative for the comments
 
01:00:43.970 --> 01:00:43.980 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
01:00:47.210 --> 01:00:47.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I agree with
 
01:00:51.530 --> 01:00:51.540 align:start position:0%
the concerns having a patchwork of terms
 
01:00:55.250 --> 01:00:55.260 align:start position:0%
for County offices across the state and
 
01:00:57.890 --> 01:00:57.900 align:start position:0%
additionally I have another concern with
 
01:00:59.809 --> 01:00:59.819 align:start position:0%
regards to
 
01:00:59.819 --> 01:01:00.829 align:start position:0%
regards to
um

01:01:00.829 --> 01:01:00.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:02.710 --> 01:01:02.720 align:start position:0%
people in the county
 
01:01:06.049 --> 01:01:06.059 align:start position:0%
weighing in on this change from two-year
 
01:01:08.510 --> 01:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
to four-year terms
 
01:01:10.789 --> 01:01:10.799 align:start position:0%
my understanding through testimony
 
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
during the hearing is that the bill was
 
01:01:16.849 --> 01:01:16.859 align:start position:0%
not brought up at a delegation meeting
 
01:01:19.309 --> 01:01:19.319 align:start position:0%
it was only discussed with a few reps so
 
01:01:21.890 --> 01:01:21.900 align:start position:0%
I have concern that the the Belknap
 
01:01:24.789 --> 01:01:24.799 align:start position:0%
County delegation in fact did not
 
01:01:28.370 --> 01:01:28.380 align:start position:0%
fully and sufficiently debate discuss
 
01:01:32.750 --> 01:01:32.760 align:start position:0%
and weigh in on this significant change
 
01:01:34.370 --> 01:01:34.380 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:37.069 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
comments

01:01:37.069 --> 01:01:37.079 align:start position:0%
comments
 
01:01:39.049 --> 01:01:39.059 align:start position:0%
seeing that I'll make a quick one on
 
01:01:40.130 --> 01:01:40.140 align:start position:0%
this one
 
01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:41.150 align:start position:0%
this one
um

01:01:41.150 --> 01:01:41.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:43.130 --> 01:01:43.140 align:start position:0%
to me this this comes down to
 
01:01:45.109 --> 01:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
consistency I I was not here on this
 
01:01:46.609 --> 01:01:46.619 align:start position:0%
committee last term
 
01:01:48.650 --> 01:01:48.660 align:start position:0%
um I was aware of what happened on the
 
01:01:49.730 --> 01:01:49.740 align:start position:0%
house floor
 
01:01:52.730 --> 01:01:52.740 align:start position:0%
we can make the argument about precedent
 
01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
being set but we We Know by uh Supreme
 
01:01:59.870 --> 01:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
Court rulings of at the U.S and the
 
01:02:02.210 --> 01:02:02.220 align:start position:0%
state level that sometimes those rulings
 
01:02:05.450 --> 01:02:05.460 align:start position:0%
are found to have been made in bad bad
 
01:02:08.990 --> 01:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
judgment and they've been overturned I
 
01:02:11.809 --> 01:02:11.819 align:start position:0%
am personally not willing to continue
 
01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
down a road as some of the other
 
01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
speakers have talked talked about about
 
01:02:22.030 --> 01:02:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:24.670 --> 01:02:24.680 align:start position:0%
legislation in different counties
 
01:02:28.250 --> 01:02:28.260 align:start position:0%
something like this I'm totally as
 
01:02:30.950 --> 01:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly said uh two years I
 
01:02:33.289 --> 01:02:33.299 align:start position:0%
believe should be the the where it
 
01:02:36.589 --> 01:02:36.599 align:start position:0%
should remain and regardless of what
 
01:02:38.809 --> 01:02:38.819 align:start position:0%
happened on the house floor yes uh last
 
01:02:41.809 --> 01:02:41.819 align:start position:0%
year in Rockingham County
 
01:02:44.930 --> 01:02:44.940 align:start position:0%
um it's my my thought process is that we
 
01:02:48.349 --> 01:02:48.359 align:start position:0%
stop what happened last year and if uh
 
01:02:50.329 --> 01:02:50.339 align:start position:0%
if the decision is made that four years
 
01:02:53.030 --> 01:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
is okay for these uh individuals that
 
01:02:54.770 --> 01:02:54.780 align:start position:0%
should apply to All Counties or it
 
01:02:56.750 --> 01:02:56.760 align:start position:0%
should apply to none so in favor of the
 
01:02:59.450 --> 01:02:59.460 align:start position:0%
itel motion
 
01:03:01.549 --> 01:03:01.559 align:start position:0%
seeing no further comment could we have
 
01:03:05.210 --> 01:03:05.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:08.760 align:start position:0%

we did a couple couple bills ago
 
01:04:10.430 --> 01:04:10.440 align:start position:0%
um I'm gonna say the same thing I said
 
01:04:12.589 --> 01:04:12.599 align:start position:0%
there we could make other motions or we
 
01:04:15.049 --> 01:04:15.059 align:start position:0%
could simply allow this to go
 
01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:23.210 --> 01:04:23.220 align:start position:0%

01:05:50.870 --> 01:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh with the representative of your
 
01:05:54.170 --> 01:05:54.180 align:start position:0%
calorie like to speak yes I think that
 
01:05:54.180 --> 01:05:55.190 align:start position:0%
calorie like to speak yes I think that
um

01:05:55.190 --> 01:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:57.589 --> 01:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
as someone that has done many petition
 
01:06:01.250 --> 01:06:01.260 align:start position:0%
Warren articles in my local uh Community
 
01:06:04.190 --> 01:06:04.200 align:start position:0%
I think that it is
 
01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:04.910 align:start position:0%
I think that it is
um

01:06:04.910 --> 01:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:08.890 --> 01:06:08.900 align:start position:0%
a great opportunity to
 
01:06:12.770 --> 01:06:12.780 align:start position:0%
empower the local citizenry and I think
 
01:06:20.030 --> 01:06:20.040 align:start position:0%
that exp raising the uh requirement to
 
01:06:22.250 --> 01:06:22.260 align:start position:0%
um to the amount suggested in this bill
 
01:06:22.260 --> 01:06:23.990 align:start position:0%
um to the amount suggested in this bill
is

01:06:23.990 --> 01:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:06:26.630 --> 01:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
um onerous on that
 
01:06:30.349 --> 01:06:30.359 align:start position:0%
um engagement and those discussions and
 
01:06:33.650 --> 01:06:33.660 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that just came up
 
01:06:35.390 --> 01:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
at my local
 
01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:35.990 align:start position:0%
at my local
um

01:06:35.990 --> 01:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:39.839 align:start position:0%
budget committee was a discussion about
 
01:06:41.510 --> 01:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
um the
 
01:06:46.910 --> 01:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
uh uh for the school budget the contract
 
01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:50.150 align:start position:0%
uh uh for the school budget the contract
that

01:06:50.150 --> 01:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:53.990 --> 01:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
um is proposed for our collective
 
01:06:56.390 --> 01:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement and if that
 
01:06:59.690 --> 01:06:59.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:02.990 --> 01:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
um and the Warren article saying hey can
 
01:07:05.329 --> 01:07:05.339 align:start position:0%
we call a special meeting was also to
 
01:07:05.339 --> 01:07:06.529 align:start position:0%
we call a special meeting was also to
fail

01:07:06.529 --> 01:07:06.539 align:start position:0%
fail
 
01:07:10.670 --> 01:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
then the town would have to go to court
 
01:07:13.789 --> 01:07:13.799 align:start position:0%
and and require and get a judge to grant
 
01:07:16.490 --> 01:07:16.500 align:start position:0%
them an emergency which would take
 
01:07:20.510 --> 01:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
some time whereas Gathering up 25
 
01:07:22.809 --> 01:07:22.819 align:start position:0%
signatures to
 
01:07:25.789 --> 01:07:25.799 align:start position:0%
call a special meeting on that topic
 
01:07:28.370 --> 01:07:28.380 align:start position:0%
could be done potentially in the same
 
01:07:28.380 --> 01:07:29.990 align:start position:0%
could be done potentially in the same
day

01:07:29.990 --> 01:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
day
 
01:07:34.549 --> 01:07:34.559 align:start position:0%
um and so I think that it in that
 
01:07:38.870 --> 01:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
situation it would be very valuable to
 
01:07:42.890 --> 01:07:42.900 align:start position:0%
be able to have a low bar and it would
 
01:07:44.690 --> 01:07:44.700 align:start position:0%
save the taxpayers
 
01:07:46.970 --> 01:07:46.980 align:start position:0%
um having to go time and money having to
 
01:07:49.849 --> 01:07:49.859 align:start position:0%
go to court to try and get an emergency
 
01:07:53.329 --> 01:07:53.339 align:start position:0%
or to gather the thousands potentially
 
01:07:55.130 --> 01:07:55.140 align:start position:0%
thousands of signatures that would be
 
01:07:57.650 --> 01:07:57.660 align:start position:0%
necessary to call a special meeting
 
01:08:00.829 --> 01:08:00.839 align:start position:0%
under this new proposed Rule and so for
 
01:08:04.670 --> 01:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
those and and many more reasons I I make
 
01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:07.260 align:start position:0%
the motion to itl thank you thank you
 
01:08:10.970 --> 01:08:10.980 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher uh may I ask a
 
01:08:13.730 --> 01:08:13.740 align:start position:0%
question of Representative yokawa
 
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
you can always ask there's no
 
01:08:17.930 --> 01:08:17.940 align:start position:0%
requirement to answer but go ahead okay
 
01:08:20.470 --> 01:08:20.480 align:start position:0%
so you said um
 
01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:22.189 align:start position:0%
so you said um
specifically

01:08:22.189 --> 01:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
01:08:26.030 --> 01:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
that the number in this bill would be an
 
01:08:29.329 --> 01:08:29.339 align:start position:0%
onerous requirement is there
 
01:08:32.689 --> 01:08:32.699 align:start position:0%
um a different number that you would
 
01:08:35.650 --> 01:08:35.660 align:start position:0%
consider not onerous
 
01:08:38.930 --> 01:08:38.940 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I think let's
 
01:08:42.590 --> 01:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
say 30 people I'm I'm okay with that
 
01:08:44.990 --> 01:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Cahill
 
01:08:46.550 --> 01:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:08:48.289 --> 01:08:48.299 align:start position:0%
thank you colleagues for hearing what I
 
01:08:51.410 --> 01:08:51.420 align:start position:0%
have to say I think that this bill would
 
01:08:53.809 --> 01:08:53.819 align:start position:0%
make it harder for the people to
 
01:08:56.390 --> 01:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
participate in their government and I
 
01:08:58.070 --> 01:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
think we should be seeking to make it
 
01:09:02.209 --> 01:09:02.219 align:start position:0%
easier for the people to participate in
 
01:09:02.219 --> 01:09:03.169 align:start position:0%
easier for the people to participate in
government

01:09:03.169 --> 01:09:03.179 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:09:03.179 --> 01:09:04.249 align:start position:0%
government
so

01:09:04.249 --> 01:09:04.259 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:09:07.430 --> 01:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
for that reason I vote to itl
 
01:09:08.749 --> 01:09:08.759 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
01:09:08.759 --> 01:09:11.169 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
tatra

01:09:11.169 --> 01:09:11.179 align:start position:0%
tatra
 
01:09:14.570 --> 01:09:14.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:15.370 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

01:09:15.370 --> 01:09:15.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:18.530 --> 01:09:18.540 align:start position:0%
my opinion I guess takes a little bit
 
01:09:21.470 --> 01:09:21.480 align:start position:0%
different path
 
01:09:23.930 --> 01:09:23.940 align:start position:0%
um this is going to cause
 
01:09:27.110 --> 01:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
hardship on parts of
 
01:09:29.030 --> 01:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:09:32.030 --> 01:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
an sb2 town
 
01:09:34.370 --> 01:09:34.380 align:start position:0%
where you have to have a second election
 
01:09:37.130 --> 01:09:37.140 align:start position:0%
which means you have to have
 
01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:38.530 align:start position:0%
which means you have to have
the

01:09:38.530 --> 01:09:38.540 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:09:41.930 --> 01:09:41.940 align:start position:0%
all the same workers that you had for
 
01:09:43.910 --> 01:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
the regular election so it's going to
 
01:09:45.410 --> 01:09:45.420 align:start position:0%
cost double
 
01:09:47.390 --> 01:09:47.400 align:start position:0%
what the town
 
01:09:50.349 --> 01:09:50.359 align:start position:0%
has without any
 
01:09:53.110 --> 01:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
help from the state
 
01:09:56.930 --> 01:09:56.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:59.870 --> 01:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
I don't think this
 
01:10:02.450 --> 01:10:02.460 align:start position:0%
I believe this falls under unfunded
 
01:10:09.350 --> 01:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:11.150 --> 01:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
01:10:13.550 --> 01:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
01:10:15.410 --> 01:10:15.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I support the
 
01:10:17.090 --> 01:10:17.100 align:start position:0%
motion of itl I have a number of
 
01:10:19.130 --> 01:10:19.140 align:start position:0%
concerns with with the bill as written
 
01:10:21.169 --> 01:10:21.179 align:start position:0%
the first would be
 
01:10:21.179 --> 01:10:21.770 align:start position:0%
the first would be
um

01:10:21.770 --> 01:10:21.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:24.830 --> 01:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
it strikes language that has a provision
 
01:10:27.410 --> 01:10:27.420 align:start position:0%
for municipalities with that that are
 
01:10:30.530 --> 01:10:30.540 align:start position:0%
perhaps deemed smaller and it specifies
 
01:10:32.750 --> 01:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
for towns with less than ten thousand
 
01:10:35.570 --> 01:10:35.580 align:start position:0%
inhabitants that there's the requirement
 
01:10:37.370 --> 01:10:37.380 align:start position:0%
of 50
 
01:10:40.310 --> 01:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
um or more signatures of Voters or a
 
01:10:41.930 --> 01:10:41.940 align:start position:0%
quarter of the voters in town whichever
 
01:10:44.630 --> 01:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
is fewer and this bill has written just
 
01:10:48.830 --> 01:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
completely strikes that and
 
01:10:51.649 --> 01:10:51.659 align:start position:0%
um Additionally the provision was that
 
01:10:53.870 --> 01:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
if you have a municipality with 10 000
 
01:10:56.750 --> 01:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
or more the the required signature
 
01:10:59.330 --> 01:10:59.340 align:start position:0%
threshold was five percent of of the
 
01:11:01.610 --> 01:11:01.620 align:start position:0%
voters and
 
01:11:01.620 --> 01:11:03.050 align:start position:0%
voters and
um

01:11:03.050 --> 01:11:03.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:07.189 --> 01:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
making this the the threshold the same
 
01:11:10.310 --> 01:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
for small towns and larger towns to me
 
01:11:12.590 --> 01:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
is not fair and there was wisdom in in
 
01:11:15.229 --> 01:11:15.239 align:start position:0%
having this distinction in the the
 
01:11:17.510 --> 01:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
statute that is currently on the books
 
01:11:21.470 --> 01:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
and additionally during the hearing um
 
01:11:25.189 --> 01:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
I asked about the changing the threshold
 
01:11:28.130 --> 01:11:28.140 align:start position:0%
to to 10 percent
 
01:11:28.140 --> 01:11:29.050 align:start position:0%
to to 10 percent
um

01:11:29.050 --> 01:11:29.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:32.030 --> 01:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
and the answer that I got that it was
 
01:11:33.770 --> 01:11:33.780 align:start position:0%
just completely random it's just
 
01:11:37.070 --> 01:11:37.080 align:start position:0%
something that OLS decided to draft into
 
01:11:39.410 --> 01:11:39.420 align:start position:0%
the bill and so there was no real
 
01:11:41.390 --> 01:11:41.400 align:start position:0%
rationale for
 
01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:42.169 align:start position:0%
rationale for
um

01:11:42.169 --> 01:11:42.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:45.709 --> 01:11:45.719 align:start position:0%
for for that change so I support the
 
01:11:47.810 --> 01:11:47.820 align:start position:0%
motion of itl thank you representative
 
01:11:50.209 --> 01:11:50.219 align:start position:0%
representative majority
 
01:11:50.219 --> 01:11:51.350 align:start position:0%
representative majority
chair

01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:52.610 align:start position:0%
chair
um

01:11:52.610 --> 01:11:52.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:56.810 --> 01:11:56.820 align:start position:0%
the a special meeting we all know there
 
01:11:58.610 --> 01:11:58.620 align:start position:0%
has to be some some cause for that
 
01:12:00.770 --> 01:12:00.780 align:start position:0%
special meeting and I respect the
 
01:12:02.630 --> 01:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
process of getting to that cause if you
 
01:12:03.709 --> 01:12:03.719 align:start position:0%
have a concern with your local
 
01:12:05.630 --> 01:12:05.640 align:start position:0%
government you should be able to to
 
01:12:07.430 --> 01:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
voice that concern especially if you
 
01:12:09.890 --> 01:12:09.900 align:start position:0%
think there's some impropriety but there
 
01:12:12.110 --> 01:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
there is a lot of weight then given to
 
01:12:14.750 --> 01:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
that which which imposes to the
 
01:12:17.270 --> 01:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
taxpayers great additional costs one
 
01:12:19.189 --> 01:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
Community next to mine upwards of thirty
 
01:12:21.590 --> 01:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for the special for
 
01:12:24.050 --> 01:12:24.060 align:start position:0%
that special meeting uh the intent of
 
01:12:26.689 --> 01:12:26.699 align:start position:0%
the bill is to is to apply the same
 
01:12:30.530 --> 01:12:30.540 align:start position:0%
weight of that application to hopefully
 
01:12:32.630 --> 01:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
what the intent of of the special
 
01:12:34.570 --> 01:12:34.580 align:start position:0%
election would be and I and I might
 
01:12:38.030 --> 01:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
hypothesize here that if it this vote
 
01:12:41.030 --> 01:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
were to get to 1010 there may be another
 
01:12:44.330 --> 01:12:44.340 align:start position:0%
motion to uh to offer something that
 
01:12:46.850 --> 01:12:46.860 align:start position:0%
might help if we can get to if there is
 
01:12:48.950 --> 01:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
a 10 10 vote but I'm only hypothesizing
 
01:12:51.770 --> 01:12:51.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you
 
01:12:54.110 --> 01:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
for their comments represent Manchester
 
01:12:57.890 --> 01:12:57.900 align:start position:0%
Beauty thank you uh Mr chair
 
01:13:01.550 --> 01:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
um my comment is I'm not in a town but
 
01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:03.610 align:start position:0%
um my comment is I'm not in a town but
this

01:13:03.610 --> 01:13:03.620 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:13:07.610 --> 01:13:07.620 align:start position:0%
increases the threshold to ask for a
 
01:13:10.910 --> 01:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
special election a special meeting
 
01:13:14.750 --> 01:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
by engaging if we are not able to get
 
01:13:18.649 --> 01:13:18.659 align:start position:0%
five percent or a higher threshold then
 
01:13:22.250 --> 01:13:22.260 align:start position:0%
there is that opportunity to engage with
 
01:13:25.310 --> 01:13:25.320 align:start position:0%
the voters of that town to bring them
 
01:13:27.890 --> 01:13:27.900 align:start position:0%
why this is needed if they're not able
 
01:13:31.970 --> 01:13:31.980 align:start position:0%
to there's another threshold to save the
 
01:13:34.550 --> 01:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
Democratic process well we didn't get
 
01:13:37.130 --> 01:13:37.140 align:start position:0%
five percent so whatever the voters
 
01:13:41.390 --> 01:13:41.400 align:start position:0%
decided States so this would be another
 
01:13:45.649 --> 01:13:45.659 align:start position:0%
way of increasing the engagement of the
 
01:13:49.130 --> 01:13:49.140 align:start position:0%
voters in that Community to participate
 
01:13:52.010 --> 01:13:52.020 align:start position:0%
in the Democratic process which we pride
 
01:13:57.709 --> 01:13:57.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:01.250 --> 01:14:01.260 align:start position:0%

Maggiore
 
01:14:11.209 --> 01:14:11.219 align:start position:0%
and say that if if we are split truly
 
01:14:13.850 --> 01:14:13.860 align:start position:0%
split down the middle on this vote that
 
01:14:16.669 --> 01:14:16.679 align:start position:0%
we um we might make another motion to
 
01:14:18.590 --> 01:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
consider the amendment which was duly
 
01:14:22.430 --> 01:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:25.010 --> 01:14:25.020 align:start position:0%
for the comments
 
01:14:26.990 --> 01:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'll make one comment on
 
01:14:29.810 --> 01:14:29.820 align:start position:0%
this regardless of the uh the original
 
01:14:32.149 --> 01:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
bill or the
 
01:14:34.490 --> 01:14:34.500 align:start position:0%
um what might be considered a potential
 
01:14:37.010 --> 01:14:37.020 align:start position:0%
Amendment the
 
01:14:38.990 --> 01:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
the issue here I'm going to pick up on a
 
01:14:40.850 --> 01:14:40.860 align:start position:0%
comment made by representative Gilman a
 
01:14:43.189 --> 01:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
little earlier and it this this appears
 
01:14:44.270 --> 01:14:44.280 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:14:47.030 --> 01:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
a solution that was brought on by it's a
 
01:14:49.490 --> 01:14:49.500 align:start position:0%
single Town issue all our everybody who
 
01:14:52.250 --> 01:14:52.260 align:start position:0%

was from the
 
01:14:55.970 --> 01:14:55.980 align:start position:0%
beautiful town of Greenland I understand
 
01:14:59.630 --> 01:14:59.640 align:start position:0%
I grew up around there however
 
01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:00.350 align:start position:0%
I grew up around there however
um

01:15:00.350 --> 01:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:03.649 --> 01:15:03.659 align:start position:0%

Amendment

01:31:59.870 --> 01:31:59.880 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
01:31:59.880 --> 01:32:02.090 align:start position:0%
Amendment
um

01:32:02.090 --> 01:32:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:08.090 --> 01:32:08.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:12.229 --> 01:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:14.990 --> 01:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
I second that representative power

speak to the amendment
 
01:32:22.370 --> 01:32:22.380 align:start position:0%
yes uh does the committee have a copy of
 
01:32:24.290 --> 01:32:24.300 align:start position:0%
of the amendment
 
01:32:24.300 --> 01:32:29.890 align:start position:0%
of the amendment
um

01:32:29.890 --> 01:32:29.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:33.410 --> 01:32:33.420 align:start position:0%
zero one five five h
 
01:32:33.420 --> 01:32:37.930 align:start position:0%
zero one five five h
D okay

01:32:37.930 --> 01:32:37.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:40.310 --> 01:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
just to uh
 
01:32:42.890 --> 01:32:42.900 align:start position:0%
refresh everyone's memory the whole
 
01:32:46.430 --> 01:32:46.440 align:start position:0%
purpose of this and it's it's
 
01:32:50.149 --> 01:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
written kind of convoluted but is to
 
01:32:52.010 --> 01:32:52.020 align:start position:0%
make it
 
01:32:52.020 --> 01:32:53.209 align:start position:0%
make it
um

01:32:53.209 --> 01:32:53.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:55.930 --> 01:32:55.940 align:start position:0%
easier to correct
 
01:33:00.709 --> 01:33:00.719 align:start position:0%
inadvertent uh errors that occur and it
 
01:33:05.649 --> 01:33:05.659 align:start position:0%
it the whole purpose is is to make it
 
01:33:08.990 --> 01:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
reasonable for the Selectmen to make
 
01:33:14.870 --> 01:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:18.950 --> 01:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:22.250 --> 01:33:22.260 align:start position:0%
just to clarify
 
01:33:28.610 --> 01:33:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:33.590 --> 01:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
following the on the bill can you please
 
01:33:38.689 --> 01:33:38.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:44.629 --> 01:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what uh the amendment zero
 
01:33:47.689 --> 01:33:47.699 align:start position:0%
one five five H amend the bill by
 
01:33:51.169 --> 01:33:51.179 align:start position:0%
replacing all after the enacting Clause
 
01:33:52.910 --> 01:33:52.920 align:start position:0%
with the following
 
01:33:55.570 --> 01:33:55.580 align:start position:0%
so it looks like
 
01:34:00.470 --> 01:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
it's replacing the entire bill
 
01:34:03.350 --> 01:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
is that correct that would be my
 
01:34:04.490 --> 01:34:04.500 align:start position:0%
interpretation representative
 
01:34:06.950 --> 01:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
representative yukela
 
01:34:08.390 --> 01:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:09.290 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:34:09.290 --> 01:34:09.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:12.290 --> 01:34:12.300 align:start position:0%
so this amendment has the same problem
 
01:34:16.910 --> 01:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
that the original bill has that
 
01:34:16.920 --> 01:34:17.830 align:start position:0%
that the original bill has that
um

01:34:17.830 --> 01:34:17.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:23.510 --> 01:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh good cause is all of these reasons
 
01:34:26.090 --> 01:34:26.100 align:start position:0%
that are are listed are within good
 
01:34:31.430 --> 01:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
cause and so it is actually not making
 
01:34:35.209 --> 01:34:35.219 align:start position:0%
anything easier it's making things that
 
01:34:38.510 --> 01:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
um would be considered good cause but
 
01:34:41.149 --> 01:34:41.159 align:start position:0%
don't follow under these delimited lists
 
01:34:45.830 --> 01:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
no longer to be adjusted and so for uh I
 
01:34:47.050 --> 01:34:47.060 align:start position:0%
don't see
 
01:34:50.750 --> 01:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
that there is a real value in
 
01:34:53.689 --> 01:34:53.699 align:start position:0%
hamstringing the Selectmen to make other
 
01:34:53.699 --> 01:34:55.810 align:start position:0%
hamstringing the Selectmen to make other
uh

01:34:55.810 --> 01:34:55.820 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:34:59.030 --> 01:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
Corrections that previously had shown
 
01:35:01.430 --> 01:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
good cause and now
 
01:35:05.149 --> 01:35:05.159 align:start position:0%
um wouldn't fall under this list so
 
01:35:07.430 --> 01:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
um I do not support this this amendment
 
01:35:16.910 --> 01:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:19.189 --> 01:35:19.199 align:start position:0%
what's up
 
01:35:19.199 --> 01:35:21.950 align:start position:0%
what's up
Calico

01:35:21.950 --> 01:35:21.960 align:start position:0%
Calico
 
01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:23.169 align:start position:0%
Calico
um

01:35:23.169 --> 01:35:23.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:32.890 --> 01:35:32.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:35.930 --> 01:35:35.940 align:start position:0%
representative 11.
 
01:35:37.370 --> 01:35:37.380 align:start position:0%
your chair
 
01:35:41.330 --> 01:35:41.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:43.870 --> 01:35:43.880 align:start position:0%
motion motioner
 
01:35:46.250 --> 01:35:46.260 align:start position:0%
I will say you may ask that question
 
01:35:48.530 --> 01:35:48.540 align:start position:0%
there's no requirement to answer but yes
 
01:35:50.629 --> 01:35:50.639 align:start position:0%
of course I got you thank you
 
01:35:53.510 --> 01:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
representative lasalles can you give me
 
01:35:57.050 --> 01:35:57.060 align:start position:0%
an idea as to why the phrase good cause
 
01:36:00.169 --> 01:36:00.179 align:start position:0%
shown has been removed and replaced with
 
01:36:08.649 --> 01:36:08.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:14.570 --> 01:36:14.580 align:start position:0%
yes to my colleague I I would say that
 
01:36:18.350 --> 01:36:18.360 align:start position:0%
and it's it's not my bill but I I would
 
01:36:21.189 --> 01:36:21.199 align:start position:0%
say it's just to delineate
 
01:36:21.199 --> 01:36:23.030 align:start position:0%
say it's just to delineate
the

01:36:23.030 --> 01:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:24.890 align:start position:0%
the
causes

01:36:24.890 --> 01:36:24.900 align:start position:0%
causes
 
01:36:28.430 --> 01:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
and it it's meant to be more restrictive
 
01:36:31.790 --> 01:36:31.800 align:start position:0%
rather than just throwing the whole uh
 
01:36:35.149 --> 01:36:35.159 align:start position:0%
the whole door wide open it's to be more
 
01:36:37.970 --> 01:36:37.980 align:start position:0%
restrictive but again it's not my bill
 
01:36:43.129 --> 01:36:43.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:47.390 --> 01:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:48.830 --> 01:36:48.840 align:start position:0%
another question give me another
 
01:36:51.350 --> 01:36:51.360 align:start position:0%
question oh okay go ahead
 
01:36:53.930 --> 01:36:53.940 align:start position:0%
um it's my understanding that good cause
 
01:36:56.870 --> 01:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
or good cause shown is a legal term is
 
01:37:03.070 --> 01:37:03.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:10.129 --> 01:37:10.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:11.810 --> 01:37:11.820 align:start position:0%
for the discussion
 
01:37:14.629 --> 01:37:14.639 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher
 
01:37:14.639 --> 01:37:15.410 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher
um

01:37:15.410 --> 01:37:15.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:19.790 --> 01:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
so I just want to
 
01:37:21.530 --> 01:37:21.540 align:start position:0%
um get some things straight about
 
01:37:26.450 --> 01:37:26.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:28.850 --> 01:37:28.860 align:start position:0%
about whether things we're discussing
 
01:37:31.010 --> 01:37:31.020 align:start position:0%
are in the underlying bill or the
 
01:37:33.370 --> 01:37:33.380 align:start position:0%
amendment um so
 
01:37:36.649 --> 01:37:36.659 align:start position:0%
I see good cause
 
01:37:39.649 --> 01:37:39.659 align:start position:0%
being removed in both the original bill
 
01:37:43.129 --> 01:37:43.139 align:start position:0%
and the amendment so
 
01:37:44.750 --> 01:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
I would
 
01:37:47.750 --> 01:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill
 
01:37:52.129 --> 01:37:52.139 align:start position:0%
as written and also oppose this bill
 
01:37:55.729 --> 01:37:55.739 align:start position:0%
as amended but then the question of
 
01:37:59.090 --> 01:37:59.100 align:start position:0%
whether to amend it
 
01:38:03.709 --> 01:38:03.719 align:start position:0%
is still a separate one I think
 
01:38:06.110 --> 01:38:06.120 align:start position:0%
there could be a case
 
01:38:08.450 --> 01:38:08.460 align:start position:0%
to um
 
01:38:10.310 --> 01:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
may be made
 
01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:11.090 align:start position:0%
may be made
um

01:38:11.090 --> 01:38:11.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:13.669 --> 01:38:13.679 align:start position:0%
for the amendment and that it makes a
 
01:38:16.250 --> 01:38:16.260 align:start position:0%
bad Bill slightly better
 
01:38:16.260 --> 01:38:16.970 align:start position:0%
bad Bill slightly better
um

01:38:16.970 --> 01:38:16.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:19.729 --> 01:38:19.739 align:start position:0%
but I'm still not really quite sure
 
01:38:19.739 --> 01:38:22.370 align:start position:0%
but I'm still not really quite sure
whether

01:38:22.370 --> 01:38:22.380 align:start position:0%
whether
 
01:38:24.950 --> 01:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
it's worth amending something that I'm
 
01:38:28.490 --> 01:38:28.500 align:start position:0%
going to vote against anyway so
 
01:38:30.310 --> 01:38:30.320 align:start position:0%
um I am
 
01:38:33.770 --> 01:38:33.780 align:start position:0%
uh I I would appreciate it if anyone
 
01:38:36.229 --> 01:38:36.239 align:start position:0%
else who is having
 
01:38:38.750 --> 01:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
um the same uncertainty could share
 
01:38:42.050 --> 01:38:42.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:44.629 --> 01:38:44.639 align:start position:0%
representative Elwood
 
01:38:46.910 --> 01:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I've always
 
01:38:49.850 --> 01:38:49.860 align:start position:0%
believed that no bill is better than a
 
01:38:55.370 --> 01:38:55.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:55.380 --> 01:38:58.310 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:38:58.310 --> 01:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:39:01.010 --> 01:39:01.020 align:start position:0%
Mr chair uh in a city that will remain
 
01:39:01.020 --> 01:39:03.169 align:start position:0%
Mr chair uh in a city that will remain
unnamed

01:39:03.169 --> 01:39:03.179 align:start position:0%
unnamed
 
01:39:03.179 --> 01:39:03.890 align:start position:0%
unnamed
um

01:39:03.890 --> 01:39:03.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:06.649 --> 01:39:06.659 align:start position:0%
the housing appeals board issued a
 
01:39:06.659 --> 01:39:07.910 align:start position:0%
the housing appeals board issued a
ruling

01:39:07.910 --> 01:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
ruling
 
01:39:11.870 --> 01:39:11.880 align:start position:0%
that used the term good cause
 
01:39:14.149 --> 01:39:14.159 align:start position:0%
um against the planning board and said
 
01:39:15.890 --> 01:39:15.900 align:start position:0%
unnamed City
 
01:39:19.550 --> 01:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
uh we were at first outraged by this but
 
01:39:20.810 --> 01:39:20.820 align:start position:0%
then when we did a little bit more
 
01:39:22.850 --> 01:39:22.860 align:start position:0%
digging and a little bit more research
 
01:39:24.770 --> 01:39:24.780 align:start position:0%
and speaking with lawyers we came to
 
01:39:27.169 --> 01:39:27.179 align:start position:0%
understand that the term good cause is a
 
01:39:30.290 --> 01:39:30.300 align:start position:0%
recognized legal phrase that is used
 
01:39:33.470 --> 01:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
with a very common understanding by the
 
01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:34.490 align:start position:0%
with a very common understanding by the
courts

01:39:34.490 --> 01:39:34.500 align:start position:0%
courts
 
01:39:37.850 --> 01:39:37.860 align:start position:0%
so I opposed this bill based on its
 
01:39:40.669 --> 01:39:40.679 align:start position:0%
striking the the legal term good cause
 
01:39:43.750 --> 01:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:47.930 --> 01:39:47.940 align:start position:0%
brother excuse me further comments
 
01:39:51.229 --> 01:39:51.239 align:start position:0%
I'll make one that might help answer
 
01:39:53.990 --> 01:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
um representative 11's
 
01:39:57.770 --> 01:39:57.780 align:start position:0%
question uh good cause shown sure it can
 
01:40:00.530 --> 01:40:00.540 align:start position:0%
be used as a legal term the sponsor
 
01:40:03.709 --> 01:40:03.719 align:start position:0%
brought forth this bill um based on
 
01:40:05.750 --> 01:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
situations that had been occurring in
 
01:40:07.970 --> 01:40:07.980 align:start position:0%
his his town but this is not a single
 
01:40:09.649 --> 01:40:09.659 align:start position:0%
Town issue
 
01:40:12.770 --> 01:40:12.780 align:start position:0%
um he also sent along at three or four
 
01:40:15.890 --> 01:40:15.900 align:start position:0%
court cases in New Hampshire that dealt
 
01:40:15.900 --> 01:40:16.629 align:start position:0%
court cases in New Hampshire that dealt
with

01:40:16.629 --> 01:40:16.639 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:40:21.110 --> 01:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
this good cause shown being abused
 
01:40:23.990 --> 01:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
um the one if anybody took the time to
 
01:40:25.490 --> 01:40:25.500 align:start position:0%
read it it was very enlightening and
 
01:40:27.290 --> 01:40:27.300 align:start position:0%
eye-opening and some of the comments the
 
01:40:30.290 --> 01:40:30.300 align:start position:0%
the decision I wish I had wrote them
 
01:40:33.770 --> 01:40:33.780 align:start position:0%
down written them down I could have uh
 
01:40:35.870 --> 01:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
given them to you right here but
 
01:40:38.030 --> 01:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
basically you had
 
01:40:41.330 --> 01:40:41.340 align:start position:0%
individuals in a city to the North Way
 
01:40:41.340 --> 01:40:43.010 align:start position:0%
individuals in a city to the North Way
North

01:40:43.010 --> 01:40:43.020 align:start position:0%
North
 
01:40:53.990 --> 01:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.030 align:start position:0%
 
where

01:40:56.030 --> 01:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:40:56.040 --> 01:40:57.709 align:start position:0%
where
the

01:40:57.709 --> 01:40:57.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:41:00.470 --> 01:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
selectman in the town
 
01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:01.910 align:start position:0%
selectman in the town
along

01:41:01.910 --> 01:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
along
 
01:41:04.070 --> 01:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
gave themselves abatements on their own
 
01:41:06.470 --> 01:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
properties along with another individual
 
01:41:08.270 --> 01:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
and friend in the town
 
01:41:12.169 --> 01:41:12.179 align:start position:0%
that is and they claimed the use of the
 
01:41:14.629 --> 01:41:14.639 align:start position:0%
term good cause shown
 
01:41:18.350 --> 01:41:18.360 align:start position:0%
it was uh they were reprimanded mightily
 
01:41:22.430 --> 01:41:22.440 align:start position:0%
in the court decision and
 
01:41:24.350 --> 01:41:24.360 align:start position:0%
so that was overturned there was another
 
01:41:26.930 --> 01:41:26.940 align:start position:0%
uh incident down in Siebert not to the
 
01:41:29.570 --> 01:41:29.580 align:start position:0%
level of egregiousness but very similar
 
01:41:32.570 --> 01:41:32.580 align:start position:0%
this bill I I believe is actually very
 
01:41:35.450 --> 01:41:35.460 align:start position:0%
good the Selectmen and assessors
 
01:41:37.910 --> 01:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
are limited by the administrative of
 
01:41:40.250 --> 01:41:40.260 align:start position:0%
clerical errors which of course or an
 
01:41:43.129 --> 01:41:43.139 align:start position:0%
assessment or evaluation error of course
 
01:41:46.910 --> 01:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
and there was a concern that they
 
01:41:48.470 --> 01:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to
 
01:41:52.370 --> 01:41:52.380 align:start position:0%
give a an abatement based on poverty
 
01:41:54.709 --> 01:41:54.719 align:start position:0%
that was added in in this final
 
01:41:54.719 --> 01:41:57.169 align:start position:0%
that was added in in this final
Amendment

01:41:57.169 --> 01:41:57.179 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
01:41:59.629 --> 01:41:59.639 align:start position:0%
so I I'm
 
01:42:02.209 --> 01:42:02.219 align:start position:0%
when I first saw the bill being new to
 
01:42:03.590 --> 01:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
the committee when I saw the word good
 
01:42:06.350 --> 01:42:06.360 align:start position:0%
cause shown in that that
 
01:42:08.810 --> 01:42:08.820 align:start position:0%
just made the hair on the back of my
 
01:42:11.030 --> 01:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
next stick up thinking holy cow that's
 
01:42:14.750 --> 01:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
just a an opportunity for abuse
 
01:42:14.760 --> 01:42:15.410 align:start position:0%
just a an opportunity for abuse
um

01:42:15.410 --> 01:42:15.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:19.310 --> 01:42:19.320 align:start position:0%
so I'm fully supported of the amendment
 
01:42:21.950 --> 01:42:21.960 align:start position:0%
uh zero one one zero one five five H
 
01:42:24.350 --> 01:42:24.360 align:start position:0%

thank you uh Mr chair I have a question
 
01:42:33.050 --> 01:42:33.060 align:start position:0%
in terms of we are looking at one
 
01:42:35.750 --> 01:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment but the sponsor Prime sponsor
 
01:42:40.070 --> 01:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
brought two together so what was the
 
01:42:43.310 --> 01:42:43.320 align:start position:0%

01:42:55.189 --> 01:42:55.199 align:start position:0%

further clarified his first amendment by
 
01:43:23.330 --> 01:43:23.340 align:start position:0%

um and not to uh not to speak too much
 
01:45:13.490 --> 01:45:13.500 align:start position:0%
about it but good cause is a legal term
 
01:45:15.890 --> 01:45:15.900 align:start position:0%
that has legal standing
 
01:45:17.750 --> 01:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
um I I think to further delineate
 
01:45:21.890 --> 01:45:21.900 align:start position:0%
without uh adding terms like not limited
 
01:45:25.750 --> 01:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
to or uh including but not limited to
 
01:45:28.669 --> 01:45:28.679 align:start position:0%
hamstrings uh the select board in the
 
01:45:31.370 --> 01:45:31.380 align:start position:0%
town and may uh I I think may cause
 
01:45:34.129 --> 01:45:34.139 align:start position:0%
farther problems so for those reasons I
 
01:45:38.149 --> 01:45:38.159 align:start position:0%
support the itl thank you thank you
 
01:45:42.410 --> 01:45:42.420 align:start position:0%

um
 
01:45:47.209 --> 01:45:47.219 align:start position:0%
I think that what we're talking about
 
01:45:49.010 --> 01:45:49.020 align:start position:0%
here is
 
01:45:49.020 --> 01:45:49.609 align:start position:0%
here is
um

01:45:49.609 --> 01:45:49.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:51.890 --> 01:45:51.900 align:start position:0%
reducing taxes
 
01:45:55.669 --> 01:45:55.679 align:start position:0%
on on people and if there's uh
 
01:46:00.229 --> 01:46:00.239 align:start position:0%
if if abuse happens as the chair
 
01:46:02.030 --> 01:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
brought up
 
01:46:04.850 --> 01:46:04.860 align:start position:0%
um I think that those people should be
 
01:46:07.310 --> 01:46:07.320 align:start position:0%
um not re-elected
 
01:46:10.370 --> 01:46:10.380 align:start position:0%
um and I think that
 
01:46:10.380 --> 01:46:11.390 align:start position:0%
um and I think that
um

01:46:11.390 --> 01:46:11.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:11.400 --> 01:46:13.550 align:start position:0%
um
however

01:46:13.550 --> 01:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:46:19.550 --> 01:46:19.560 align:start position:0%
uh I so I I don't agree that that you
 
01:46:21.109 --> 01:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
know you should be voting yourself an
 
01:46:21.119 --> 01:46:22.910 align:start position:0%
know you should be voting yourself an
abatement

01:46:22.910 --> 01:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
abatement
 
01:46:26.629 --> 01:46:26.639 align:start position:0%
um however I think that if the if
 
01:46:28.490 --> 01:46:28.500 align:start position:0%
someone comes to the
 
01:46:34.850 --> 01:46:34.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:37.430 --> 01:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
believe and are able to convince the
 
01:46:39.709 --> 01:46:39.719 align:start position:0%
selectman that this is
 
01:46:42.290 --> 01:46:42.300 align:start position:0%
um uh appropriate that they should pay
 
01:46:44.450 --> 01:46:44.460 align:start position:0%
less taxes then I don't think that the
 
01:46:46.070 --> 01:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
that the state should come in the way
 
01:46:48.229 --> 01:46:48.239 align:start position:0%
and say no you you need to pay more
 
01:46:49.910 --> 01:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
taxes so
 
01:46:52.850 --> 01:46:52.860 align:start position:0%
um for that reason I think that
 
01:46:52.860 --> 01:46:53.510 align:start position:0%
um for that reason I think that
um

01:46:53.510 --> 01:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:56.709 --> 01:46:56.719 align:start position:0%
error on the side of being more General
 
01:47:01.250 --> 01:47:01.260 align:start position:0%
allows people to pay less taxes and I'm
 
01:47:03.050 --> 01:47:03.060 align:start position:0%
all for that so thank you thank you
 
01:47:03.060 --> 01:47:04.330 align:start position:0%
all for that so thank you thank you

to fund a scholarship
 
01:51:18.470 --> 01:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:22.490 --> 01:51:22.500 align:start position:0%
there are other ways for a municipality
 
01:51:27.470 --> 01:51:27.480 align:start position:0%
to offer scholarships
 
01:51:30.410 --> 01:51:30.420 align:start position:0%
doing this at the Town level through
 
01:51:34.129 --> 01:51:34.139 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars to me is is not a good
 
01:51:34.139 --> 01:51:35.270 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars to me is is not a good
idea

01:51:35.270 --> 01:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
idea
 
01:51:35.280 --> 01:51:37.490 align:start position:0%
idea
and

01:51:37.490 --> 01:51:37.500 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:51:40.790 --> 01:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
additionally in the hearing there were
 
01:51:43.070 --> 01:51:43.080 align:start position:0%
some concerns with regards to the
 
01:51:46.310 --> 01:51:46.320 align:start position:0%
mechanics of of how this this would
 
01:51:48.530 --> 01:51:48.540 align:start position:0%
actually work
 
01:51:48.540 --> 01:51:55.550 align:start position:0%
actually work
and

01:51:55.550 --> 01:51:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:57.530 --> 01:51:57.540 align:start position:0%
I I was going to make one more point but
 
01:52:01.430 --> 01:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:04.490 --> 01:52:04.500 align:start position:0%
thank you further discussion
 
01:52:08.330 --> 01:52:08.340 align:start position:0%
see representative priests I will also
 
01:52:11.510 --> 01:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
be voting to itl this because I don't
 
01:52:11.520 --> 01:52:12.470 align:start position:0%
be voting to itl this because I don't
think

01:52:12.470 --> 01:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:52:14.209 --> 01:52:14.219 align:start position:0%
that it is
 
01:52:17.330 --> 01:52:17.340 align:start position:0%
the town's responsibilities to do a
 
01:52:17.340 --> 01:52:18.950 align:start position:0%
the town's responsibilities to do a
scholarship

01:52:18.950 --> 01:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
scholarship
 
01:52:22.189 --> 01:52:22.199 align:start position:0%
if they want to create a fund and have
 
01:52:25.490 --> 01:52:25.500 align:start position:0%
it public donations that would be great
 
01:52:27.470 --> 01:52:27.480 align:start position:0%
but I don't think public money should be
 
01:52:28.850 --> 01:52:28.860 align:start position:0%
doing this
 
01:52:29.990 --> 01:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:52:33.590 --> 01:52:33.600 align:start position:0%

I also find problems with this bill uh
 
01:52:40.310 --> 01:52:40.320 align:start position:0%
what are the questions that was not
 
01:52:42.590 --> 01:52:42.600 align:start position:0%
answered or could not be answered by the

answered or could not be answered by the
um

01:52:43.490 --> 01:52:43.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:45.890 --> 01:52:45.900 align:start position:0%
the sponsor was how this would work with
 
01:52:48.410 --> 01:52:48.420 align:start position:0%
education Freedom accounts and would
 
01:52:51.410 --> 01:52:51.420 align:start position:0%
would families have a chance to have two

thank you Mr chairman what I was going
 
01:53:12.770 --> 01:53:12.780 align:start position:0%
to say is there are other ways if
 
01:53:15.370 --> 01:53:15.380 align:start position:0%
citizens want to
 
01:53:17.750 --> 01:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
establish a scholarship fund there are
 
01:53:19.430 --> 01:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
other ways to do it
 
01:53:22.330 --> 01:53:22.340 align:start position:0%
and that that it should be done
 
01:53:26.209 --> 01:53:26.219 align:start position:0%
with private donations and not taxpayer
 
01:53:29.870 --> 01:53:29.880 align:start position:0%

um
 
01:53:38.990 --> 01:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
we were undecided about this bill when
 
01:53:41.930 --> 01:53:41.940 align:start position:0%
we discussed it but in hindsight and
 
01:53:44.149 --> 01:53:44.159 align:start position:0%
looking further at the wording of Bill I
 
01:53:44.159 --> 01:53:44.990 align:start position:0%
looking further at the wording of Bill I
now

01:53:44.990 --> 01:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:53:49.010 --> 01:53:49.020 align:start position:0%
uh am in favor of the itl motion I feel
 
01:53:52.870 --> 01:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
that the word scholarship is over broad
 
01:53:55.550 --> 01:53:55.560 align:start position:0%
what what would these scholarships be
 
01:53:58.010 --> 01:53:58.020 align:start position:0%
for what would they fund there's no
 
01:54:01.129 --> 01:54:01.139 align:start position:0%
definition there's no mechanism for
 
01:54:03.290 --> 01:54:03.300 align:start position:0%
means testing so how could you be sure
 
01:54:05.149 --> 01:54:05.159 align:start position:0%
that the people who wanted the
 
01:54:06.770 --> 01:54:06.780 align:start position:0%
scholarships truly needed the
 
01:54:09.290 --> 01:54:09.300 align:start position:0%
scholarships and it just doesn't seem
 
01:54:11.750 --> 01:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
like a good use of taxpayer money to me
 
01:54:14.030 --> 01:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
so I will be voting in support of the
 
01:54:16.250 --> 01:54:16.260 align:start position:0%
itl motion
 
01:54:16.260 --> 01:54:18.830 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chair
 
01:54:26.629 --> 01:54:26.639 align:start position:0%
um I like the idea of this bill but I
 
01:54:28.689 --> 01:54:28.699 align:start position:0%
agree with my colleagues
 
01:54:33.290 --> 01:54:33.300 align:start position:0%
that it is too broad the language and
 
01:54:34.910 --> 01:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
really the voters should be deciding
 
01:54:37.189 --> 01:54:37.199 align:start position:0%
what to do their tax dollars so I'll be
 
01:54:39.709 --> 01:54:39.719 align:start position:0%
voting to support the Ito
 
01:54:41.330 --> 01:54:41.340 align:start position:0%

01:54:44.810 --> 01:54:44.820 align:start position:0%
Mike thank you Mr chair my comment would
 
01:54:47.390 --> 01:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
be similar to representative stavis at
 
01:54:49.490 --> 01:54:49.500 align:start position:0%
first I was in favor and then as I read
 
01:54:52.729 --> 01:54:52.739 align:start position:0%
more I became uninfavor
 
01:54:55.370 --> 01:54:55.380 align:start position:0%
specifically because there was no
 
01:54:58.189 --> 01:54:58.199 align:start position:0%
mechanism that said who gets to pick who
 
01:55:00.530 --> 01:55:00.540 align:start position:0%
gets the scholarship and who gets to
 
01:55:00.540 --> 01:55:01.310 align:start position:0%
gets the scholarship and who gets to
pick

01:55:01.310 --> 01:55:01.320 align:start position:0%
pick
 
01:55:03.890 --> 01:55:03.900 align:start position:0%
what kind of scholarship is created and
 
01:55:05.810 --> 01:55:05.820 align:start position:0%
I agree with my colleague who stated
 
01:55:07.970 --> 01:55:07.980 align:start position:0%
that there are other ways several of my
 
01:55:10.129 --> 01:55:10.139 align:start position:0%
colleagues that a town can create a
 
01:55:12.229 --> 01:55:12.239 align:start position:0%
scholarship in the name of someone or in
 
01:55:14.990 --> 01:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
honor of a family or for any number of
 
01:55:18.470 --> 01:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
reasons and it could be managed by the
 
01:55:20.510 --> 01:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
town quote unquote as a pass-through
 
01:55:24.290 --> 01:55:24.300 align:start position:0%
without the town using tax dollars to to
 
01:55:26.810 --> 01:55:26.820 align:start position:0%
do that so I will be voting itl thank
 
01:55:26.820 --> 01:55:31.570 align:start position:0%
do that so I will be voting itl thank
you

01:55:31.570 --> 01:55:31.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:34.070 --> 01:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
representative men's Purdy
 
01:55:36.950 --> 01:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:55:40.129 --> 01:55:40.139 align:start position:0%
um I too will be supporting the itl
 
01:55:45.950 --> 01:55:45.960 align:start position:0%
motion in my city we have an Education
 
01:55:45.960 --> 01:55:47.410 align:start position:0%
motion in my city we have an Education
Foundation

01:55:47.410 --> 01:55:47.420 align:start position:0%
Foundation
 
01:55:50.570 --> 01:55:50.580 align:start position:0%
established which is scholarship used
 
01:55:52.910 --> 01:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
for both the
 
01:55:56.930 --> 01:55:56.940 align:start position:0%
um by private donations and fundraising
 
01:55:59.209 --> 01:55:59.219 align:start position:0%
and that would be used both for the
 
01:56:01.609 --> 01:56:01.619 align:start position:0%
students as well as for the teachers to
 
01:56:05.930 --> 01:56:05.940 align:start position:0%
provide supplies in public schools this
 
01:56:09.649 --> 01:56:09.659 align:start position:0%
is to augment the public school teachers
 
01:56:13.310 --> 01:56:13.320 align:start position:0%
in the public school kids and
 
01:56:16.090 --> 01:56:16.100 align:start position:0%
and that's not doing with taxpayer money
 
01:56:19.729 --> 01:56:19.739 align:start position:0%
and in this case taking the taxpayer
 
01:56:19.739 --> 01:56:20.750 align:start position:0%
and in this case taking the taxpayer
money

01:56:20.750 --> 01:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:56:24.530 --> 01:56:24.540 align:start position:0%
and putting it in a pot and who decides
 
01:56:28.550 --> 01:56:28.560 align:start position:0%
who gets it just doesn't seem fair and
 
01:56:31.850 --> 01:56:31.860 align:start position:0%
so I will be voting in support of Ito
 
01:56:36.169 --> 01:56:36.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:38.990 --> 01:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher
 
01:56:40.129 --> 01:56:40.139 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:56:44.390 --> 01:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
I'd just like to start by saying um I
 
01:56:44.400 --> 01:56:46.250 align:start position:0%
I'd just like to start by saying um I
support

01:56:46.250 --> 01:56:46.260 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:56:46.260 --> 01:56:46.930 align:start position:0%
support
um

01:56:46.930 --> 01:56:46.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:49.490 --> 01:56:49.500 align:start position:0%
municipalities being able to pay for
 
01:56:52.129 --> 01:56:52.139 align:start position:0%
education in general I believe that
 
01:56:56.149 --> 01:56:56.159 align:start position:0%
education is a public good that everyone
 
01:56:59.090 --> 01:56:59.100 align:start position:0%
benefits from so um
 
01:56:59.100 --> 01:57:01.250 align:start position:0%
benefits from so um
it

01:57:01.250 --> 01:57:01.260 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:57:03.709 --> 01:57:03.719 align:start position:0%
um I I I
 
01:57:03.719 --> 01:57:04.250 align:start position:0%
um I I I
um

01:57:04.250 --> 01:57:04.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:07.189 --> 01:57:07.199 align:start position:0%
I I do think that
 
01:57:10.930 --> 01:57:10.940 align:start position:0%
it can it does often make sense for
 
01:57:13.669 --> 01:57:13.679 align:start position:0%
taxpayers to pay for education I just
 
01:57:15.790 --> 01:57:15.800 align:start position:0%
think in this case
 
01:57:19.030 --> 01:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
since the wording isn't clear enough
 
01:57:19.040 --> 01:57:20.649 align:start position:0%
since the wording isn't clear enough
since

01:57:20.649 --> 01:57:20.659 align:start position:0%
since
 
01:57:23.930 --> 01:57:23.940 align:start position:0%
scholarship isn't defined and
 
01:57:26.209 --> 01:57:26.219 align:start position:0%
they didn't say
 
01:57:28.430 --> 01:57:28.440 align:start position:0%
uh the Bill's sponsors
 
01:57:30.709 --> 01:57:30.719 align:start position:0%
didn't say what type of schooling
 
01:57:30.719 --> 01:57:32.229 align:start position:0%
didn't say what type of schooling
specifically

01:57:32.229 --> 01:57:32.239 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
01:57:36.890 --> 01:57:36.900 align:start position:0%
uh scholarship funds could be used for
 
01:57:40.310 --> 01:57:40.320 align:start position:0%
um yeah I I just think that the
 
01:57:44.510 --> 01:57:44.520 align:start position:0%
implementation isn't uh isn't good
 
01:57:46.070 --> 01:57:46.080 align:start position:0%
enough so
 
01:57:46.080 --> 01:57:46.689 align:start position:0%
enough so
um

01:57:46.689 --> 01:57:46.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:56.270 --> 01:57:56.280 align:start position:0%

03:18:08.870 --> 03:18:08.880 align:start position:0%

03:18:10.690 --> 03:18:10.700 align:start position:0%
uh somebody like the second second
 
03:18:13.429 --> 03:18:13.439 align:start position:0%
representative majority seconds uh
 
03:18:16.370 --> 03:18:16.380 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair having
 
03:18:18.349 --> 03:18:18.359 align:start position:0%
been on the municipal and County
 
03:18:19.969 --> 03:18:19.979 align:start position:0%
government committee for several years
 
03:18:22.969 --> 03:18:22.979 align:start position:0%
now I've seen many bills
 
03:18:26.090 --> 03:18:26.100 align:start position:0%
um similar to this one come before us
 
03:18:28.730 --> 03:18:28.740 align:start position:0%
uh there's there can be no doubt that
 
03:18:31.849 --> 03:18:31.859 align:start position:0%
plastic waste is a problem in New
 
03:18:34.190 --> 03:18:34.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and in the world
 
03:18:36.170 --> 03:18:36.180 align:start position:0%
um in many states and many countries are
 
03:18:39.590 --> 03:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
moving to reduce uh plastic waste but in
 
03:18:43.010 --> 03:18:43.020 align:start position:0%
we have not yet seen a bill come before
 
03:18:44.570 --> 03:18:44.580 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
03:18:48.050 --> 03:18:48.060 align:start position:0%
that adequately defines single use point
 
03:18:51.590 --> 03:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
of sale single-use plastic bag we find
 
03:18:53.690 --> 03:18:53.700 align:start position:0%
that this bill is
 
03:18:57.170 --> 03:18:57.180 align:start position:0%
um not specific enough to provide
 
03:19:00.410 --> 03:19:00.420 align:start position:0%
guidance for retailers or customers and
 
03:19:03.290 --> 03:19:03.300 align:start position:0%
could have unintended consequences and
 
03:19:05.809 --> 03:19:05.819 align:start position:0%
therefore recommend itl thank you thank
 
03:19:08.870 --> 03:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
you for the discussion representative
 
03:19:08.880 --> 03:19:10.429 align:start position:0%
you for the discussion representative
priest

03:19:10.429 --> 03:19:10.439 align:start position:0%
priest
 
03:19:13.790 --> 03:19:13.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I am for this bill
 
03:19:17.570 --> 03:19:17.580 align:start position:0%
and against it Elling it uh if there's
 
03:19:18.710 --> 03:19:18.720 align:start position:0%
such a thing
 
03:19:21.530 --> 03:19:21.540 align:start position:0%
um because I think we've
 
03:19:23.630 --> 03:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
we've reached a point
 
03:19:25.550 --> 03:19:25.560 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
03:19:29.750 --> 03:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
where we are being our environment our
 
03:19:32.990 --> 03:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
Parks our Lakes our oceans are being
 
03:19:35.990 --> 03:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
clogged and choked by the single-use
 
03:19:36.000 --> 03:19:37.510 align:start position:0%
clogged and choked by the single-use
plastic

03:19:37.510 --> 03:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
plastic
 
03:19:40.190 --> 03:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
and Retail isn't taking the
 
03:19:43.070 --> 03:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
responsibilities the production isn't
 
03:19:45.710 --> 03:19:45.720 align:start position:0%
taking any responsibilities the state
 
03:19:48.410 --> 03:19:48.420 align:start position:0%
isn't taking any responsibilities so
 
03:19:51.170 --> 03:19:51.180 align:start position:0%
it's really up to the localities to do
 
03:19:54.469 --> 03:19:54.479 align:start position:0%
this and this enables them to do this
 
03:19:57.050 --> 03:19:57.060 align:start position:0%
and this is the first step that I think
 
03:19:59.570 --> 03:19:59.580 align:start position:0%
can address the problem
 
03:20:02.750 --> 03:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
that is really degrading our environment
 
03:20:05.150 --> 03:20:05.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:20:06.710 --> 03:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
03:20:08.690 --> 03:20:08.700 align:start position:0%
comments representative Holland we'll go
 
03:20:10.010 --> 03:20:10.020 align:start position:0%
right down the line
 
03:20:13.670 --> 03:20:13.680 align:start position:0%
so uh this pains me to support the itl
 
03:20:15.410 --> 03:20:15.420 align:start position:0%
because I've spent the last five years
 
03:20:18.710 --> 03:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
on our town Solid Waste committee
 
03:20:20.210 --> 03:20:20.220 align:start position:0%
um and you know when I look at the
 
03:20:23.450 --> 03:20:23.460 align:start position:0%
problem it's not just the plastic bag
 
03:20:25.849 --> 03:20:25.859 align:start position:0%
it's everything that you stick in it and
 
03:20:29.090 --> 03:20:29.100 align:start position:0%
so uh the packaging is complex enough
 
03:20:32.330 --> 03:20:32.340 align:start position:0%
that consumers are often like looking at
 
03:20:33.710 --> 03:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
something and they're saying is this
 
03:20:36.410 --> 03:20:36.420 align:start position:0%
recyclable is this not recyclable which
 
03:20:39.349 --> 03:20:39.359 align:start position:0%
leads to recycling you throw it in the
 
03:20:41.330 --> 03:20:41.340 align:start position:0%
recycling bin and hope for the best and
 
03:20:44.150 --> 03:20:44.160 align:start position:0%
so while I think something needs to be
 
03:20:46.250 --> 03:20:46.260 align:start position:0%
done with packaging I don't think this
 
03:20:48.410 --> 03:20:48.420 align:start position:0%
bill would allow us to do that and I
 
03:20:50.690 --> 03:20:50.700 align:start position:0%
think it's sufficiently vague that it
 
03:20:52.610 --> 03:20:52.620 align:start position:0%
adds problems to retailers so
 
03:20:55.990 --> 03:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I have to support the IDL
 
03:20:59.150 --> 03:20:59.160 align:start position:0%
representative Hicks
 
03:21:01.610 --> 03:21:01.620 align:start position:0%
I agree with everything that represents
 
03:21:03.530 --> 03:21:03.540 align:start position:0%
Davis said
 
03:21:06.469 --> 03:21:06.479 align:start position:0%
um I will be opposing the itl just
 
03:21:08.210 --> 03:21:08.220 align:start position:0%
because I want to make sure that there
 
03:21:11.269 --> 03:21:11.279 align:start position:0%
are enough votes against the itl that
 
03:21:15.110 --> 03:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
people don't assume that nobody supports
 
03:21:17.510 --> 03:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
further conserving Plastics
 
03:21:18.769 --> 03:21:18.779 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
03:21:18.779 --> 03:21:20.630 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
Gala

03:21:20.630 --> 03:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
Gala
 
03:21:22.550 --> 03:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:21:25.750 --> 03:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm going to be
 
03:21:29.570 --> 03:21:29.580 align:start position:0%
opposing the itl motion
 
03:21:33.410 --> 03:21:33.420 align:start position:0%
um just because this well not not so
 
03:21:35.269 --> 03:21:35.279 align:start position:0%
much this term but last terms version of
 
03:21:38.230 --> 03:21:38.240 align:start position:0%
this bill was one of the most popular
 
03:21:42.710 --> 03:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
bills in my inbox for constituents to
 
03:21:44.990 --> 03:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
um emailed me about
 
03:21:47.450 --> 03:21:47.460 align:start position:0%
um a lot of my constituents care deeply
 
03:21:51.250 --> 03:21:51.260 align:start position:0%
about the environment and want to see
 
03:21:53.690 --> 03:21:53.700 align:start position:0%
single-use Plastics
 
03:21:57.170 --> 03:21:57.180 align:start position:0%
um regulated ass
 
03:22:00.769 --> 03:22:00.779 align:start position:0%
um a way of helping to preserve our
 
03:22:00.779 --> 03:22:01.969 align:start position:0%
um a way of helping to preserve our
environment

03:22:01.969 --> 03:22:01.979 align:start position:0%
environment
 
03:22:01.979 --> 03:22:03.170 align:start position:0%
environment
um

03:22:03.170 --> 03:22:03.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:05.690 --> 03:22:05.700 align:start position:0%
one thing I will
 
03:22:08.030 --> 03:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
um bring up the
 
03:22:09.830 --> 03:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
um that
 
03:22:12.349 --> 03:22:12.359 align:start position:0%
a concern that I don't
 
03:22:15.889 --> 03:22:15.899 align:start position:0%
think has been addressed is um
 
03:22:19.849 --> 03:22:19.859 align:start position:0%
so I I'm also trying to be
 
03:22:21.349 --> 03:22:21.359 align:start position:0%
um very
 
03:22:25.130 --> 03:22:25.140 align:start position:0%
sensitive to the needs of the disability
 
03:22:28.190 --> 03:22:28.200 align:start position:0%
Community as well and
 
03:22:28.200 --> 03:22:29.269 align:start position:0%
Community as well and
um

03:22:29.269 --> 03:22:29.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:32.830 --> 03:22:32.840 align:start position:0%
the disability Community often has
 
03:22:36.410 --> 03:22:36.420 align:start position:0%
interesting perspectives on single-use
 
03:22:36.420 --> 03:22:37.929 align:start position:0%
interesting perspectives on single-use
Plastics

03:22:37.929 --> 03:22:37.939 align:start position:0%
Plastics
 
03:22:40.429 --> 03:22:40.439 align:start position:0%
like apparently some disabled people
 
03:22:43.849 --> 03:22:43.859 align:start position:0%
actually need them so um
 
03:22:46.309 --> 03:22:46.319 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that would be
 
03:22:46.319 --> 03:22:47.389 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that would be
um

03:22:47.389 --> 03:22:47.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:50.630 --> 03:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
if this bill comes back in the future I
 
03:22:53.650 --> 03:22:53.660 align:start position:0%
that would be a perspective
 
03:22:55.849 --> 03:22:55.859 align:start position:0%
I'd want to
 
03:22:57.650 --> 03:22:57.660 align:start position:0%
hear from
 
03:23:00.230 --> 03:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
in the future but for now I'm just going
 
03:23:02.630 --> 03:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
to be voting
 
03:23:05.630 --> 03:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
against the itl motion
 
03:23:07.550 --> 03:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
for the comments representative
 
03:23:07.560 --> 03:23:08.870 align:start position:0%
for the comments representative
benchputi

03:23:08.870 --> 03:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
benchputi
 
03:23:13.610 --> 03:23:13.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I strongly oppose itl
 
03:23:17.450 --> 03:23:17.460 align:start position:0%
for a couple of reasons one is
 
03:23:20.510 --> 03:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
it's well established that single-use
 
03:23:20.520 --> 03:23:22.309 align:start position:0%
it's well established that single-use
plastic

03:23:22.309 --> 03:23:22.319 align:start position:0%
plastic
 
03:23:25.610 --> 03:23:25.620 align:start position:0%
plastic especially plastic bag has
 
03:23:28.250 --> 03:23:28.260 align:start position:0%
caused a lot of havoc in a lot of
 
03:23:29.950 --> 03:23:29.960 align:start position:0%
different communities
 
03:23:34.190 --> 03:23:34.200 align:start position:0%
and because as much as we you know we
 
03:23:34.200 --> 03:23:35.170 align:start position:0%
and because as much as we you know we
heard

03:23:35.170 --> 03:23:35.180 align:start position:0%
heard
 
03:23:38.570 --> 03:23:38.580 align:start position:0%
how much just 10 percent
 
03:23:43.429 --> 03:23:43.439 align:start position:0%
of the bags produced or recycled and
 
03:23:46.030 --> 03:23:46.040 align:start position:0%
others might be reused
 
03:23:50.450 --> 03:23:50.460 align:start position:0%
reused yet it ends up after three uses
 
03:23:53.630 --> 03:23:53.640 align:start position:0%
four uses it ends up in the landfill it
 
03:23:55.849 --> 03:23:55.859 align:start position:0%
has no place else to go
 
03:24:00.370 --> 03:24:00.380 align:start position:0%
so reuse does not mitigate
 
03:24:03.769 --> 03:24:03.779 align:start position:0%
production in the first place so if we
 
03:24:07.910 --> 03:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
have to take anything seriously to make
 
03:24:10.969 --> 03:24:10.979 align:start position:0%
sure we leave this planet
 
03:24:14.570 --> 03:24:14.580 align:start position:0%
better for my grandson in his next
 
03:24:16.190 --> 03:24:16.200 align:start position:0%
Generation his
 
03:24:20.269 --> 03:24:20.279 align:start position:0%
uh great grand my great grandkids we
 
03:24:22.670 --> 03:24:22.680 align:start position:0%
have to start now we have come to this
 
03:24:26.570 --> 03:24:26.580 align:start position:0%
point in you know and I strongly feel
 
03:24:29.950 --> 03:24:29.960 align:start position:0%
that addressing recycle as well as
 
03:24:34.790 --> 03:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
production generation both angles we
 
03:24:37.309 --> 03:24:37.319 align:start position:0%
have to take only then we can make a
 
03:24:40.910 --> 03:24:40.920 align:start position:0%
small dent in what's where we are with
 
03:24:44.690 --> 03:24:44.700 align:start position:0%
this so with that I would this would be
 
03:24:47.269 --> 03:24:47.279 align:start position:0%
a step in the right direction
 
03:24:52.130 --> 03:24:52.140 align:start position:0%
so I strongly support this bill and I

03:25:05.389 --> 03:25:05.399 align:start position:0%
I will be supporting itl on this bill
 
03:25:08.030 --> 03:25:08.040 align:start position:0%
well I agree that we do have an issue
 
03:25:12.410 --> 03:25:12.420 align:start position:0%
with how we handle our plastic waste I
 
03:25:15.410 --> 03:25:15.420 align:start position:0%
um I disagree that the single-use bags
 
03:25:18.650 --> 03:25:18.660 align:start position:0%
are our problem to address when I walk
 
03:25:20.870 --> 03:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
into the grocery store and I can walk
 
03:25:22.490 --> 03:25:22.500 align:start position:0%
through the produce aisle and pick up
 
03:25:24.710 --> 03:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
potatoes apples and any other vegetable
 
03:25:27.170 --> 03:25:27.180 align:start position:0%
that's in a plastic bag and then move
 
03:25:29.570 --> 03:25:29.580 align:start position:0%
into the deli department and receive my
 
03:25:32.290 --> 03:25:32.300 align:start position:0%
cut meats and cheeses in a plastic bag
 
03:25:35.330 --> 03:25:35.340 align:start position:0%
and my prepared salads in a plastic
 
03:25:37.490 --> 03:25:37.500 align:start position:0%
container and then move over to the fish
 
03:25:40.250 --> 03:25:40.260 align:start position:0%
department and I get my fish packaged in
 
03:25:42.710 --> 03:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
a plastic bag those are all single-use
 
03:25:44.809 --> 03:25:44.819 align:start position:0%
bags I'm never going to reuse a bag that
 
03:25:46.849 --> 03:25:46.859 align:start position:0%
comes from a piece of fish and then I
 
03:25:48.830 --> 03:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
move into the meat department and what's
 
03:25:50.210 --> 03:25:50.220 align:start position:0%
everything pot wrapped in the meat
 
03:25:52.250 --> 03:25:52.260 align:start position:0%
department plastic and I can also walk
 
03:25:54.349 --> 03:25:54.359 align:start position:0%
over to the aisle that sells everything
 
03:25:56.630 --> 03:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
plastic I can buy plastic bags plastic
 
03:25:59.330 --> 03:25:59.340 align:start position:0%
wrap plastic containers all in a single
 
03:26:01.729 --> 03:26:01.739 align:start position:0%
aisle I can buy plastic but when I leave
 
03:26:04.190 --> 03:26:04.200 align:start position:0%
the store I'm now being told that I
 
03:26:06.290 --> 03:26:06.300 align:start position:0%
can't take plastic bag
 
03:26:08.030 --> 03:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
so because we're going to ban that or
 
03:26:09.769 --> 03:26:09.779 align:start position:0%
we're going to address that I just think
 
03:26:11.510 --> 03:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
that this is addressing the wrong issue
 
03:26:12.950 --> 03:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
and that there are many other single
 
03:26:14.690 --> 03:26:14.700 align:start position:0%
plastic items that should be addressed
 
03:26:16.490 --> 03:26:16.500 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
03:26:18.889 --> 03:26:18.899 align:start position:0%
comments representative Gilman thank you
 
03:26:20.150 --> 03:26:20.160 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
03:26:22.370 --> 03:26:22.380 align:start position:0%
um I will probably vote in support of
 
03:26:25.130 --> 03:26:25.140 align:start position:0%
the itl and the reason is because there
 
03:26:28.490 --> 03:26:28.500 align:start position:0%
is a Senate bill that changes the method
 
03:26:31.990 --> 03:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
of doing this and it's to allow or
 
03:26:34.969 --> 03:26:34.979 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
03:26:37.670 --> 03:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
to use their rule making Authority
 
03:26:42.490 --> 03:26:42.500 align:start position:0%
excuse me rule making authority to um
 
03:26:46.250 --> 03:26:46.260 align:start position:0%
make make uh not decisions but uh the
 
03:26:48.349 --> 03:26:48.359 align:start position:0%
way forward I guess and and how to
 
03:26:51.590 --> 03:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
define how to um how do you what happens
 
03:26:53.990 --> 03:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
in the landfills and those those kind of
 
03:26:56.690 --> 03:26:56.700 align:start position:0%
issues that were were worried about
 
03:27:00.050 --> 03:27:00.060 align:start position:0%
um so I think that's maybe actually a
 
03:27:05.210 --> 03:27:05.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:07.070 --> 03:27:07.080 align:start position:0%

03:32:31.439 --> 03:32:32.450 align:start position:0%
make those available
um

03:32:32.450 --> 03:32:32.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:34.790 --> 03:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
we referred it to interim study but then
 
03:32:37.550 --> 03:32:37.560 align:start position:0%
never actually did the study so
 
03:32:40.190 --> 03:32:40.200 align:start position:0%
um this term
 
03:32:40.200 --> 03:32:41.450 align:start position:0%
um this term
um

03:32:41.450 --> 03:32:41.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:44.450 --> 03:32:44.460 align:start position:0%
I had meant to turn it into a study
 
03:32:44.460 --> 03:32:45.469 align:start position:0%
I had meant to turn it into a study
committee

03:32:45.469 --> 03:32:45.479 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:32:49.429 --> 03:32:49.439 align:start position:0%
but uh OLS didn't
 
03:32:52.550 --> 03:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
draft it that way they just gave the old
 
03:32:55.190 --> 03:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
language again so the motion to retain
 
03:32:56.990 --> 03:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
is to
 
03:32:57.000 --> 03:32:58.070 align:start position:0%
is to
um

03:32:58.070 --> 03:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:01.929 --> 03:33:01.939 align:start position:0%
give me time to get the bill
 
03:33:01.939 --> 03:33:03.710 align:start position:0%
give me time to get the bill
re-drafted

03:33:03.710 --> 03:33:03.720 align:start position:0%
re-drafted
 
03:33:03.720 --> 03:33:04.370 align:start position:0%
re-drafted
um

03:33:04.370 --> 03:33:04.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:06.650 --> 03:33:06.660 align:start position:0%
so that way I can get to do what I
 
03:33:08.750 --> 03:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
actually want it to do
 
03:33:08.760 --> 03:33:09.710 align:start position:0%
actually want it to do
um

03:33:09.710 --> 03:33:09.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:11.330 --> 03:33:11.340 align:start position:0%
so and
 
03:33:11.340 --> 03:33:12.050 align:start position:0%
so and
um

03:33:12.050 --> 03:33:12.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:13.790 --> 03:33:13.800 align:start position:0%
so some things I've found out by the way
 
03:33:18.050 --> 03:33:18.060 align:start position:0%
since last term on this topic um
 
03:33:18.060 --> 03:33:19.670 align:start position:0%
since last term on this topic um
are

03:33:19.670 --> 03:33:19.680 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:33:21.349 --> 03:33:21.359 align:start position:0%
so one
 
03:33:21.359 --> 03:33:22.190 align:start position:0%
so one
um

03:33:22.190 --> 03:33:22.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:24.469 --> 03:33:24.479 align:start position:0%
one of the things that's an issue here
 
03:33:27.410 --> 03:33:27.420 align:start position:0%
is the city of Concord has a pass you
 
03:33:30.170 --> 03:33:30.180 align:start position:0%
throw program where
 
03:33:30.180 --> 03:33:31.490 align:start position:0%
throw program where
um

03:33:31.490 --> 03:33:31.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:31.500 --> 03:33:33.910 align:start position:0%
um
where

03:33:33.910 --> 03:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
where
 
03:33:37.490 --> 03:33:37.500 align:start position:0%
to have your trash collected by the
 
03:33:40.790 --> 03:33:40.800 align:start position:0%
municipal trash pickup Services
 
03:33:43.490 --> 03:33:43.500 align:start position:0%
um you have to use these special purple
 
03:33:43.500 --> 03:33:45.650 align:start position:0%
um you have to use these special purple
bags

03:33:45.650 --> 03:33:45.660 align:start position:0%
bags
 
03:33:48.110 --> 03:33:48.120 align:start position:0%
um so some
 
03:33:51.229 --> 03:33:51.239 align:start position:0%
some landlords some um
 
03:33:54.950 --> 03:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
or some buildings
 
03:33:57.170 --> 03:33:57.180 align:start position:0%
or groups of people in buildings we're
 
03:34:01.490 --> 03:34:01.500 align:start position:0%
trying to get around that by just
 
03:34:04.250 --> 03:34:04.260 align:start position:0%
putting their uh
 
03:34:07.370 --> 03:34:07.380 align:start position:0%
trash in the recycling which was
 
03:34:09.349 --> 03:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
increasing the uh
 
03:34:09.359 --> 03:34:11.090 align:start position:0%
increasing the uh
spoilage

03:34:11.090 --> 03:34:11.100 align:start position:0%
spoilage
 
03:34:11.100 --> 03:34:13.429 align:start position:0%
spoilage
rate

03:34:13.429 --> 03:34:13.439 align:start position:0%
rate
 
03:34:13.439 --> 03:34:14.389 align:start position:0%
rate
um

03:34:14.389 --> 03:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:17.750 --> 03:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
and so I talked with somebody from our
 
03:34:21.229 --> 03:34:21.239 align:start position:0%
Waste Services and
 
03:34:21.239 --> 03:34:22.250 align:start position:0%
Waste Services and
um

03:34:22.250 --> 03:34:22.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:24.410 --> 03:34:24.420 align:start position:0%
they said
 
03:34:26.630 --> 03:34:26.640 align:start position:0%
that yeah the spoilage rate from just
 
03:34:28.729 --> 03:34:28.739 align:start position:0%
having it collected directly from the
 
03:34:30.950 --> 03:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
buildings is generally too high in that
 
03:34:33.110 --> 03:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
the best way to um
 
03:34:36.469 --> 03:34:36.479 align:start position:0%
go about it instead would be to make it
 
03:34:38.150 --> 03:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
more possible for
 
03:34:38.160 --> 03:34:39.110 align:start position:0%
more possible for
um

03:34:39.110 --> 03:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:43.670 --> 03:34:43.680 align:start position:0%
people to uh bring their recycling
 
03:34:46.010 --> 03:34:46.020 align:start position:0%
directly to the transfer station
 
03:34:49.550 --> 03:34:49.560 align:start position:0%
themselves so
 
03:34:49.560 --> 03:34:51.530 align:start position:0%
themselves so
another

03:34:51.530 --> 03:34:51.540 align:start position:0%
another
 
03:34:54.650 --> 03:34:54.660 align:start position:0%
Avenue I might be pursuing would be to
 
03:34:54.660 --> 03:34:56.630 align:start position:0%
Avenue I might be pursuing would be to
um

03:34:56.630 --> 03:34:56.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:58.910 --> 03:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
have this
 
03:35:02.950 --> 03:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
uh to turn the bill or into
 
03:35:05.330 --> 03:35:05.340 align:start position:0%
a wage who
 
03:35:08.630 --> 03:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
require that uh
 
03:35:13.010 --> 03:35:13.020 align:start position:0%
public transit services
 
03:35:13.020 --> 03:35:14.830 align:start position:0%
public transit services
provide

03:35:14.830 --> 03:35:14.840 align:start position:0%
provide
 
03:35:16.849 --> 03:35:16.859 align:start position:0%
transit to
 
03:35:20.030 --> 03:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
transfer stations but yeah that's just
 
03:35:21.530 --> 03:35:21.540 align:start position:0%
one of the options that a study
 
03:35:24.830 --> 03:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
committee could consider so yeah I ask
 
03:35:29.090 --> 03:35:29.100 align:start position:0%
that we can retain uh this bill so that
 
03:35:32.210 --> 03:35:32.220 align:start position:0%
um we can have the time to figure that
 
03:35:32.220 --> 03:35:34.250 align:start position:0%
um we can have the time to figure that
out

03:35:34.250 --> 03:35:34.260 align:start position:0%
out
 
03:35:36.769 --> 03:35:36.779 align:start position:0%
thank you so further discussion
 
03:35:39.530 --> 03:35:39.540 align:start position:0%
representative manager a quick question
 
03:35:39.540 --> 03:35:40.849 align:start position:0%
representative manager a quick question
to

03:35:40.849 --> 03:35:40.859 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:35:43.969 --> 03:35:43.979 align:start position:0%
the client sponsor
 
03:35:43.979 --> 03:35:45.769 align:start position:0%
the client sponsor
um I

03:35:45.769 --> 03:35:45.779 align:start position:0%
um I
 
03:35:48.710 --> 03:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
if I understand the intention is to
 
03:35:51.130 --> 03:35:51.140 align:start position:0%
bring composting to public housing
 
03:35:53.690 --> 03:35:53.700 align:start position:0%
there's another we talked about another
 
03:35:56.469 --> 03:35:56.479 align:start position:0%
bill that has passed
 
03:36:00.229 --> 03:36:00.239 align:start position:0%
composting being food waste being
 
03:36:02.170 --> 03:36:02.180 align:start position:0%
diverted from
 
03:36:07.570 --> 03:36:07.580 align:start position:0%
landfill HB 300 which passed
 
03:36:11.450 --> 03:36:11.460 align:start position:0%
environmental and agricultural committee
 
03:36:13.690 --> 03:36:13.700 align:start position:0%
20 to nothing
 
03:36:17.990 --> 03:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
were considering that that bill is for
 
03:36:20.030 --> 03:36:20.040 align:start position:0%
all food waste
 
03:36:23.990 --> 03:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
would that help address it doesn't make
 
03:36:25.309 --> 03:36:25.319 align:start position:0%
a distinction whether it's public
 
03:36:28.490 --> 03:36:28.500 align:start position:0%
housing or single family or apartment
 
03:36:34.070 --> 03:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
complex so would that make it easier
 
03:36:37.370 --> 03:36:37.380 align:start position:0%
to kind of focus on that than retaining
 
03:36:39.830 --> 03:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
and working on one just one small piece
 
03:36:42.290 --> 03:36:42.300 align:start position:0%
just a question
 
03:36:45.290 --> 03:36:45.300 align:start position:0%
um yeah I do think that bill would be
 
03:36:47.330 --> 03:36:47.340 align:start position:0%
helpful too
 
03:36:47.340 --> 03:36:48.050 align:start position:0%
helpful too
um

03:36:48.050 --> 03:36:48.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:48.060 --> 03:36:49.610 align:start position:0%
um
uh

03:36:49.610 --> 03:36:49.620 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:36:49.620 --> 03:36:51.050 align:start position:0%
uh
I

03:36:51.050 --> 03:36:51.060 align:start position:0%
I
 
03:36:53.090 --> 03:36:53.100 align:start position:0%
I mean yeah I guess if it passed you yes
 
03:36:56.570 --> 03:36:56.580 align:start position:0%
Lily it's probably going to pass as well
 
03:36:59.030 --> 03:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
but I still think
 
03:37:02.809 --> 03:37:02.819 align:start position:0%
it might be worthwhile to wait and see
 
03:37:04.490 --> 03:37:04.500 align:start position:0%
what happens with it just in case
 
03:37:06.590 --> 03:37:06.600 align:start position:0%
there's something
 
03:37:11.510 --> 03:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
unusual occurs and if it does pass then
 
03:37:13.729 --> 03:37:13.739 align:start position:0%
after the bill comes back from retention
 
03:37:16.429 --> 03:37:16.439 align:start position:0%
we can just ital it then but if it
 
03:37:18.769 --> 03:37:18.779 align:start position:0%
doesn't if leather build doesn't pass
 
03:37:22.210 --> 03:37:22.220 align:start position:0%
then we can have this in backup
 
03:37:28.610 --> 03:37:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:30.110 --> 03:37:30.120 align:start position:0%
further comments or questions
 
03:37:32.090 --> 03:37:32.100 align:start position:0%
representative Holland
 
03:37:34.490 --> 03:37:34.500 align:start position:0%
so unlike the plastic bag one the solid
 
03:37:37.490 --> 03:37:37.500 align:start position:0%
waste is about 30 percent uh a food
 
03:37:39.889 --> 03:37:39.899 align:start position:0%
waste is about 30 percent of our solid
 
03:37:42.650 --> 03:37:42.660 align:start position:0%
waste and the real challenges are not
 
03:37:45.889 --> 03:37:45.899 align:start position:0%
limited to public housing it's like how
 
03:37:48.229 --> 03:37:48.239 align:start position:0%
do you have a collection system in your
 
03:37:51.170 --> 03:37:51.180 align:start position:0%
community and then the second problem is
 
03:37:54.710 --> 03:37:54.720 align:start position:0%
if it includes any dairy or meat there's
 
03:37:56.929 --> 03:37:56.939 align:start position:0%
very few processing centers you can't
 
03:37:59.389 --> 03:37:59.399 align:start position:0%
just throw it in a in any place you
 
03:38:01.429 --> 03:38:01.439 align:start position:0%
really need a specialized processing
 
03:38:04.250 --> 03:38:04.260 align:start position:0%
place to actually take take it to and
 
03:38:06.530 --> 03:38:06.540 align:start position:0%
we've been working for five years and
 
03:38:08.210 --> 03:38:08.220 align:start position:0%
trying to work on more of a regional
 
03:38:10.910 --> 03:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
approach that we can bring the compost
 
03:38:13.670 --> 03:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
easily to it's not a long transportation
 
03:38:16.670 --> 03:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
and the real benefit of this is over the
 
03:38:19.969 --> 03:38:19.979 align:start position:0%
last two years or three years there's
 
03:38:22.070 --> 03:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
been extreme volatility in the recycling
 
03:38:24.110 --> 03:38:24.120 align:start position:0%
markets and there's been a real
 
03:38:26.150 --> 03:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
tightening in the contamination markets
 
03:38:30.170 --> 03:38:30.180 align:start position:0%
which has led to real flux uh real uh
 
03:38:32.809 --> 03:38:32.819 align:start position:0%
fluctuations in our Sanitation in budget
 
03:38:35.330 --> 03:38:35.340 align:start position:0%
and so composting especially if you can
 
03:38:37.670 --> 03:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
do it locally offers us an opportunity
 
03:38:41.510 --> 03:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
to stabilize our Solid Waste costs and
 
03:38:44.389 --> 03:38:44.399 align:start position:0%
so if a system can be brought together
 
03:38:47.150 --> 03:38:47.160 align:start position:0%
that really helps us in terms of how do
 
03:38:48.950 --> 03:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
we do a pickup and then where do we
 
03:38:50.450 --> 03:38:50.460 align:start position:0%
bring it if that could be part of this
 
03:38:54.349 --> 03:38:54.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:56.389 --> 03:38:56.399 align:start position:0%
for the comments
 
03:38:59.090 --> 03:38:59.100 align:start position:0%
I'll just make one based on the
 
03:39:01.010 --> 03:39:01.020 align:start position:0%
representative Holland's comment I would

03:41:00.530 --> 03:41:00.540 align:start position:0%
uh represent powered like to speak thank
 
03:41:02.990 --> 03:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman so um
 
03:41:05.570 --> 03:41:05.580 align:start position:0%
we did have this this
 
03:41:08.210 --> 03:41:08.220 align:start position:0%
same similar Bill last year in committee
 
03:41:08.220 --> 03:41:09.410 align:start position:0%
same similar Bill last year in committee
and

03:41:09.410 --> 03:41:09.420 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:41:09.420 --> 03:41:10.550 align:start position:0%
and
um

03:41:10.550 --> 03:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:12.830 --> 03:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
now we we have it again
 
03:41:15.349 --> 03:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
and I see it as an unfunded mandate
 
03:41:18.170 --> 03:41:18.180 align:start position:0%
because clearly
 
03:41:18.180 --> 03:41:19.610 align:start position:0%
because clearly
um

03:41:19.610 --> 03:41:19.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:23.389 --> 03:41:23.399 align:start position:0%
to require that public housing provide
 
03:41:27.410 --> 03:41:27.420 align:start position:0%
on-site composting and recycling will be
 
03:41:29.809 --> 03:41:29.819 align:start position:0%
in an added cost
 
03:41:32.269 --> 03:41:32.279 align:start position:0%
I have a family member that lives in an
 
03:41:35.090 --> 03:41:35.100 align:start position:0%
apartment in Manchester and they
 
03:41:38.990 --> 03:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately don't provide recycling at
 
03:41:41.150 --> 03:41:41.160 align:start position:0%
that apartment complex because it does
 
03:41:44.330 --> 03:41:44.340 align:start position:0%
cost extra money to have those
 
03:41:44.340 --> 03:41:45.950 align:start position:0%
cost extra money to have those
receptacles

03:41:45.950 --> 03:41:45.960 align:start position:0%
receptacles
 
03:41:47.630 --> 03:41:47.640 align:start position:0%
on site
 
03:41:50.150 --> 03:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
additionally I see other problems with
 
03:41:52.670 --> 03:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
with the bill as written with regard to
 
03:41:57.590 --> 03:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
the um provisions of on-site composting
 
03:41:59.450 --> 03:41:59.460 align:start position:0%
um specifically there's safety issues
 
03:42:01.010 --> 03:42:01.020 align:start position:0%
with um
 
03:42:04.750 --> 03:42:04.760 align:start position:0%
that attracting pests in vermin
 
03:42:08.090 --> 03:42:08.100 align:start position:0%
additionally I would say that
 
03:42:12.050 --> 03:42:12.060 align:start position:0%
not all activities are feasible in
 
03:42:14.389 --> 03:42:14.399 align:start position:0%
apartment complexes
 
03:42:14.399 --> 03:42:15.650 align:start position:0%
apartment complexes
um

03:42:15.650 --> 03:42:15.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:18.290 --> 03:42:18.300 align:start position:0%
and and and this would be on-site
 
03:42:21.349 --> 03:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
composting and recycling
 
03:42:21.359 --> 03:42:22.309 align:start position:0%
composting and recycling
um

03:42:22.309 --> 03:42:22.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:25.210 --> 03:42:25.220 align:start position:0%
to provide that that ability to do that
 
03:42:27.469 --> 03:42:27.479 align:start position:0%
on site
 
03:42:27.479 --> 03:42:29.929 align:start position:0%
on site
um

03:42:29.929 --> 03:42:29.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:34.130 --> 03:42:34.140 align:start position:0%
for it it it's it poses difficulties and
 
03:42:36.170 --> 03:42:36.180 align:start position:0%
the last point that that I would make is
 
03:42:38.870 --> 03:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
that not all municipalities have the
 
03:42:40.969 --> 03:42:40.979 align:start position:0%
ability at this point in time to collect
 
03:42:43.729 --> 03:42:43.739 align:start position:0%
compost New Hampshire as I understand it
 
03:42:45.290 --> 03:42:45.300 align:start position:0%
just simply does not have that
 
03:42:48.349 --> 03:42:48.359 align:start position:0%
infrastructure at the time at this point
 
03:42:50.750 --> 03:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
in time and therefore the bill
 
03:42:55.130 --> 03:42:55.140 align:start position:0%
um to me just would not work as written
 
03:42:56.450 --> 03:42:56.460 align:start position:0%
thank you representative further
 
03:42:56.460 --> 03:42:58.429 align:start position:0%
thank you representative further

representative Gallagher
 
03:43:02.210 --> 03:43:02.220 align:start position:0%
um I'd just like to say I'm okay with
 
03:43:07.010 --> 03:43:07.020 align:start position:0%
the motion of itl and um yeah don't
 
03:43:08.450 --> 03:43:08.460 align:start position:0%
think we need to have any further
 
03:43:10.790 --> 03:43:10.800 align:start position:0%

thank you representative for their
 
03:45:39.710 --> 03:45:39.720 align:start position:0%
discussion representative stavis
 
03:45:41.929 --> 03:45:41.939 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
03:45:43.929 --> 03:45:43.939 align:start position:0%
um I think as everybody probably knows
 
03:45:47.170 --> 03:45:47.180 align:start position:0%
municipality Master plans are
 
03:45:49.790 --> 03:45:49.800 align:start position:0%
guideposts they're not not anything
 
03:45:54.050 --> 03:45:54.060 align:start position:0%
about them that says shall it's just a
 
03:45:57.070 --> 03:45:57.080 align:start position:0%
kind of a map guiding the way
 
03:46:00.229 --> 03:46:00.239 align:start position:0%
and we have found in our community that
 
03:46:03.170 --> 03:46:03.180 align:start position:0%
our Master planning process is simply
 
03:46:04.969 --> 03:46:04.979 align:start position:0%
not able to keep up with the times
 
03:46:07.910 --> 03:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
because times are changing so quickly
 
03:46:11.570 --> 03:46:11.580 align:start position:0%
and we felt I worked on this bill with
 
03:46:14.090 --> 03:46:14.100 align:start position:0%
our planning director and we felt that
 
03:46:16.729 --> 03:46:16.739 align:start position:0%
it was time for the statute to reflect
 
03:46:18.469 --> 03:46:18.479 align:start position:0%
the fact that the times are changing
 
03:46:22.849 --> 03:46:22.859 align:start position:0%
quickly and that residents have new and
 
03:46:25.429 --> 03:46:25.439 align:start position:0%
different needs of their municipalities
 
03:46:28.550 --> 03:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
these days than they did
 
03:46:31.370 --> 03:46:31.380 align:start position:0%
12 years ago which was probably when
 
03:46:33.590 --> 03:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
some master plans began their process
 
03:46:35.929 --> 03:46:35.939 align:start position:0%
and we thought that this would help
 
03:46:39.290 --> 03:46:39.300 align:start position:0%
bring us into the 20th and dare I say
 
03:46:41.210 --> 03:46:41.220 align:start position:0%
the 21st century
 
03:46:42.950 --> 03:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
so um
 
03:46:44.990 --> 03:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
for that reason I hope you will vote
 
03:46:47.570 --> 03:46:47.580 align:start position:0%
against the Ito I will be voting against
 
03:46:49.790 --> 03:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
the itl thank you thank you
 
03:46:52.250 --> 03:46:52.260 align:start position:0%
representative for the comment
 
03:46:54.889 --> 03:46:54.899 align:start position:0%
a representative Parr thank you Mr
 
03:46:54.899 --> 03:46:55.969 align:start position:0%
a representative Parr thank you Mr
chairman

03:46:55.969 --> 03:46:55.979 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
03:46:58.429 --> 03:46:58.439 align:start position:0%
um I'll be supporting the the motion of
 
03:47:01.250 --> 03:47:01.260 align:start position:0%
itl and I I did speak to a planning
 
03:47:04.910 --> 03:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
board member in in my municipality and
 
03:47:09.170 --> 03:47:09.180 align:start position:0%
it was explained to me that um
 
03:47:11.870 --> 03:47:11.880 align:start position:0%
what the bill is intending to do can
 
03:47:15.530 --> 03:47:15.540 align:start position:0%
already in fact be done and I I was a
 
03:47:18.469 --> 03:47:18.479 align:start position:0%
referenced to the section of Statute
 
03:47:22.729 --> 03:47:22.739 align:start position:0%
which would be come under RSA 674 colon
 
03:47:25.910 --> 03:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
2 n where it discusses
 
03:47:29.269 --> 03:47:29.279 align:start position:0%
um energy is is covered and therefore in
 
03:47:33.410 --> 03:47:33.420 align:start position:0%
my mind the the bill is not needed
 
03:47:34.910 --> 03:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
03:47:37.610 --> 03:47:37.620 align:start position:0%
of uh Holland
 
03:47:39.410 --> 03:47:39.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
03:47:41.450 --> 03:47:41.460 align:start position:0%
um while actually again in the master
 
03:47:44.510 --> 03:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
plan there's only two sections that you
 
03:47:46.910 --> 03:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
have to approve the first is the vision
 
03:47:48.710 --> 03:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
statement and the second is the land use
 
03:47:51.469 --> 03:47:51.479 align:start position:0%
statement and then as Representative
 
03:47:53.630 --> 03:47:53.640 align:start position:0%
Steve has said there have been added
 
03:47:55.670 --> 03:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
suggestions that you could do these
 
03:47:58.490 --> 03:47:58.500 align:start position:0%
things and put them on and while the
 
03:48:00.889 --> 03:48:00.899 align:start position:0%
energy section is in there there's a
 
03:48:03.050 --> 03:48:03.060 align:start position:0%
broad section on energy this bill
 
03:48:05.150 --> 03:48:05.160 align:start position:0%
actually does provide more flexibility
 
03:48:08.150 --> 03:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
in the planning board for those of us
 
03:48:10.510 --> 03:48:10.520 align:start position:0%
who have eight-year-old Master plans
 
03:48:13.130 --> 03:48:13.140 align:start position:0%
right now our planning board really has
 
03:48:15.650 --> 03:48:15.660 align:start position:0%
become a reacting board and this gives
 
03:48:18.530 --> 03:48:18.540 align:start position:0%
us more flexibility as we rewrite our
 
03:48:20.510 --> 03:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
master plan to begin to put those in
 
03:48:22.550 --> 03:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
rather than having to come to the
 
03:48:26.150 --> 03:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
legislation and uh legislative body and
 
03:48:28.969 --> 03:48:28.979 align:start position:0%
ask to have specific sections each time
 
03:48:31.790 --> 03:48:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:35.090 --> 03:48:35.100 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative Hicks
 
03:48:37.550 --> 03:48:37.560 align:start position:0%
I support this bill I think this is
 
03:48:38.750 --> 03:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
something especially if your
 
03:48:40.969 --> 03:48:40.979 align:start position:0%
municipalities that are not considering
 
03:48:43.250 --> 03:48:43.260 align:start position:0%
these issues I think this just brings
 
03:48:45.830 --> 03:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
this to their attention
 
03:48:47.929 --> 03:48:47.939 align:start position:0%
if it's not needed then it also doesn't
 
03:48:53.510 --> 03:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:55.370 --> 03:48:55.380 align:start position:0%
representative Manchester
 
03:48:57.530 --> 03:48:57.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
03:49:01.550 --> 03:49:01.560 align:start position:0%
um I too will oppose itl this is a
 
03:49:04.130 --> 03:49:04.140 align:start position:0%
master plan so it's like the blueprint
 
03:49:07.690 --> 03:49:07.700 align:start position:0%
for America this is a blueprint and not
 
03:49:13.309 --> 03:49:13.319 align:start position:0%
uh shelled so this is very needed in
 
03:49:16.429 --> 03:49:16.439 align:start position:0%
terms of how fast the technology energy
 
03:49:19.550 --> 03:49:19.560 align:start position:0%
sources and other sources Transportation
 
03:49:22.309 --> 03:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
you name it things are changing in a
 
03:49:25.490 --> 03:49:25.500 align:start position:0%
rapid rate in this day and age in 21st
 
03:49:28.070 --> 03:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
century if you are stuck with
 
03:49:32.630 --> 03:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
10 year old 10-year behind that's a huge
 
03:49:32.640 --> 03:49:33.769 align:start position:0%
10 year old 10-year behind that's a huge
handicap

03:49:33.769 --> 03:49:33.779 align:start position:0%
handicap
 
03:49:37.610 --> 03:49:37.620 align:start position:0%
for any municipality to function agile
 
03:49:37.620 --> 03:49:39.250 align:start position:0%
for any municipality to function agile
and

03:49:39.250 --> 03:49:39.260 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:49:43.510 --> 03:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
embrace the efficient new
 
03:49:46.670 --> 03:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
approaches to solving Municipal problems
 
03:49:50.570 --> 03:49:50.580 align:start position:0%
and I think this is a great win so I
 
03:49:52.969 --> 03:49:52.979 align:start position:0%
would oppose itl and I would
 
03:49:54.710 --> 03:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
request our
 
03:49:57.769 --> 03:49:57.779 align:start position:0%
um encourage my colleagues on both sides
 
03:50:01.790 --> 03:50:01.800 align:start position:0%
to take a hard look and support uh art
 
03:50:06.130 --> 03:50:06.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:08.990 --> 03:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
representative yocella
 
03:50:11.150 --> 03:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:50:11.160 --> 03:50:12.050 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

03:50:12.050 --> 03:50:12.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:14.690 --> 03:50:14.700 align:start position:0%
I consider the master plan to be the
 
03:50:18.050 --> 03:50:18.060 align:start position:0%
central Plan central planning and it
 
03:50:20.150 --> 03:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
costs money
 
03:50:23.150 --> 03:50:23.160 align:start position:0%
um and the voters don't have a vote on
 
03:50:25.309 --> 03:50:25.319 align:start position:0%
what is in the master plan it is created
 
03:50:25.319 --> 03:50:26.750 align:start position:0%
what is in the master plan it is created
by

03:50:26.750 --> 03:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
by
 
03:50:29.769 --> 03:50:29.779 align:start position:0%
um either uh
 
03:50:34.309 --> 03:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:38.150 --> 03:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
um so it costs taxpayer money or it's
 
03:50:40.309 --> 03:50:40.319 align:start position:0%
created directly from the budget
 
03:50:40.319 --> 03:50:41.510 align:start position:0%
created directly from the budget
committee

03:50:41.510 --> 03:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:50:43.190 --> 03:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
or not the budget committee the planning
 
03:50:43.200 --> 03:50:44.030 align:start position:0%
or not the budget committee the planning
board

03:50:44.030 --> 03:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
board
 
03:50:46.370 --> 03:50:46.380 align:start position:0%
and approved by the planning board and
 
03:50:46.380 --> 03:50:47.750 align:start position:0%
and approved by the planning board and
so

03:50:47.750 --> 03:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:50:51.950 --> 03:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
there's no real reason that they
 
03:50:56.210 --> 03:50:56.220 align:start position:0%
could not put in any ordinance
 
03:50:58.729 --> 03:50:58.739 align:start position:0%
or propose any ordinance the the
 
03:51:01.309 --> 03:51:01.319 align:start position:0%
planning board is the the board that
 
03:51:04.790 --> 03:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
proposes ordinances so they would be
 
03:51:06.530 --> 03:51:06.540 align:start position:0%
able to propose an ordinance even
 
03:51:08.929 --> 03:51:08.939 align:start position:0%
without the master plan going into and
 
03:51:11.030 --> 03:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
spelling out what they should do because
 
03:51:13.309 --> 03:51:13.319 align:start position:0%
they are the ones that actually tell
 
03:51:16.130 --> 03:51:16.140 align:start position:0%
themselves what they should do in their
 
03:51:18.650 --> 03:51:18.660 align:start position:0%
Central plan
 
03:51:20.570 --> 03:51:20.580 align:start position:0%
um so I don't think that this is
 
03:51:23.269 --> 03:51:23.279 align:start position:0%
actually necessary I think it's just
 
03:51:25.550 --> 03:51:25.560 align:start position:0%
paperwork and spending
 
03:51:29.330 --> 03:51:29.340 align:start position:0%
um money uh for the the planning board
 
03:51:32.030 --> 03:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
to tell itself what to do and they can
 
03:51:34.429 --> 03:51:34.439 align:start position:0%
already make their own decision and so I
 
03:51:36.590 --> 03:51:36.600 align:start position:0%
don't believe that this is necessary
 
03:51:39.290 --> 03:51:39.300 align:start position:0%
for that reason I'm voting itl thank you
 
03:51:40.670 --> 03:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
03:51:43.550 --> 03:51:43.560 align:start position:0%
comments representative priests and I
 
03:51:44.870 --> 03:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
wasn't going to speak because everything
 
03:51:46.610 --> 03:51:46.620 align:start position:0%
that I was going to speak on has been
 
03:51:49.370 --> 03:51:49.380 align:start position:0%
spoken but after the last remark there's
 
03:51:51.530 --> 03:51:51.540 align:start position:0%
a lot of misinformation about master
 
03:51:54.469 --> 03:51:54.479 align:start position:0%
plans that I want to correct and number
 
03:51:58.490 --> 03:51:58.500 align:start position:0%
one it is a guidance for the future
 
03:52:01.490 --> 03:52:01.500 align:start position:0%
development of the community and all
 
03:52:04.370 --> 03:52:04.380 align:start position:0%
master plans are developed by the
 
03:52:08.330 --> 03:52:08.340 align:start position:0%
residents of that Community they take an
 
03:52:11.090 --> 03:52:11.100 align:start position:0%
active part from the very beginning of
 
03:52:14.389 --> 03:52:14.399 align:start position:0%
what's in that master plan and this bill
 
03:52:17.570 --> 03:52:17.580 align:start position:0%
is only giving them some more options to
 
03:52:21.410 --> 03:52:21.420 align:start position:0%
consider it's not a mandate it's just
 
03:52:23.389 --> 03:52:23.399 align:start position:0%
merely options
 
03:52:25.130 --> 03:52:25.140 align:start position:0%
every Community is going to be
 
03:52:28.309 --> 03:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
developing in the future and and this
 
03:52:30.650 --> 03:52:30.660 align:start position:0%
bill it's just giving them options to
 
03:52:33.349 --> 03:52:33.359 align:start position:0%
consider when they're developing their
 
03:52:36.469 --> 03:52:36.479 align:start position:0%
guidelines in their master plan thank
 
03:52:36.479 --> 03:52:37.790 align:start position:0%
guidelines in their master plan thank
you

03:52:37.790 --> 03:52:37.800 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:52:42.110 --> 03:52:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:46.910 --> 03:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:49.849 --> 03:52:49.859 align:start position:0%
the master plan sections of the rsas
 
03:52:49.859 --> 03:52:53.510 align:start position:0%
the master plan sections of the rsas
6742

03:52:53.510 --> 03:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:55.849 --> 03:52:55.859 align:start position:0%
um Roman numeral 2 talks about master
 
03:52:57.650 --> 03:52:57.660 align:start position:0%
plans and what must
 
03:53:00.309 --> 03:53:00.319 align:start position:0%
they contain
 
03:53:03.610 --> 03:53:03.620 align:start position:0%
67423 which we're talking about here
 
03:53:07.610 --> 03:53:07.620 align:start position:0%
says may and during discussions it was
 
03:53:09.710 --> 03:53:09.720 align:start position:0%
my interpretation that that may is a
 
03:53:13.309 --> 03:53:13.319 align:start position:0%
suggestive May rather than a restrictive
 
03:53:16.910 --> 03:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
which to me means may you can do it
 
03:53:18.710 --> 03:53:18.720 align:start position:0%
pretty much anything you want under that
 
03:53:21.530 --> 03:53:21.540 align:start position:0%
consider anything you want
 
03:53:21.540 --> 03:53:22.190 align:start position:0%
consider anything you want
um

03:53:22.190 --> 03:53:22.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:24.349 --> 03:53:24.359 align:start position:0%
and what has happened over the years is
 
03:53:27.650 --> 03:53:27.660 align:start position:0%
that our RSA obviously had has grown
 
03:53:30.889 --> 03:53:30.899 align:start position:0%
into yet another long laundry list of
 
03:53:30.899 --> 03:53:32.690 align:start position:0%
into yet another long laundry list of
additions

03:53:32.690 --> 03:53:32.700 align:start position:0%
additions
 
03:53:37.010 --> 03:53:37.020 align:start position:0%
when I look at the the item Q there any
 
03:53:38.809 --> 03:53:38.819 align:start position:0%
other section addressing any other topic
 
03:53:40.309 --> 03:53:40.319 align:start position:0%
relevant to the appropriate future
 
03:53:43.309 --> 03:53:43.319 align:start position:0%
development and on and on to me
 
03:53:45.530 --> 03:53:45.540 align:start position:0%
you could eliminate everything in that
 
03:53:45.540 --> 03:53:46.490 align:start position:0%
you could eliminate everything in that
section

03:53:46.490 --> 03:53:46.500 align:start position:0%
section
 
03:53:49.550 --> 03:53:49.560 align:start position:0%
a through the new proposed p
 
03:53:52.250 --> 03:53:52.260 align:start position:0%
and Implement some form of a cue and
 
03:53:54.650 --> 03:53:54.660 align:start position:0%
that would take care of anything I I
 
03:53:58.010 --> 03:53:58.020 align:start position:0%
oppose continuing to add
 
03:54:01.790 --> 03:54:01.800 align:start position:0%
laundry lists of items that suggest
 
03:54:03.830 --> 03:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
maybe what you could do when I believe
 
03:54:05.809 --> 03:54:05.819 align:start position:0%
the planning boards can actually do that
 
03:54:09.110 --> 03:54:09.120 align:start position:0%
I've actually talked to uh
 
03:54:12.469 --> 03:54:12.479 align:start position:0%
representative stavis that um
