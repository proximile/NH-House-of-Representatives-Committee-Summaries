two we the members of the house finance
 
00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
committee are gathered here today to
 
00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
listen to the public as we are analyzing
 
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 align:start position:0%
the governor's proposed budget for
 
00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 align:start position:0%
fiscal years 2026 and
 
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
2027 we must fit it to the revenue
 
00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:52.879 align:start position:0%
proposed by the house Ways and Means
 
00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 align:start position:0%
Committee that Revenue differs from the
 
00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 align:start position:0%
governor's estimate by almost $800
 
00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:00.229 align:start position:0%
governor's estimate by almost $800
million

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
in an almost $16 billion budget
 
00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 align:start position:0%
obviously this is a bigger challenge
 
00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 align:start position:0%
than most
 
00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
budgets but less than some previous
 
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 align:start position:0%
challenges we also have the fact that
 
00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 align:start position:0%
the current budget is on a path to
 
00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 align:start position:0%
overspend by about 50 million we have
 
00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 align:start position:0%
new legislation passed by the house this
 
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 align:start position:0%
session of 1.6 billion we will deal with
 
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 align:start position:0%
all this by a close examination of all
 
00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 align:start position:0%
departments so as to efficiency and
 
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.310 align:start position:0%
departments so as to efficiency and
employee

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
employee
 
00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
vacancies we may update fees that have
 
00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 align:start position:0%
not been increased for decades we do not
 
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
have any proposals for new taxes as of
 
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
yet typically 30 to 32% of our budget is
 
00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 align:start position:0%
from federal spunding federal funding
 
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 align:start position:0%
scattered throughout most departments we
 
00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 align:start position:0%
do not at this time expect big changes
 
00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:55.639 align:start position:0%
in established grants there was a lot of
 
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
concern regarding the future of Medicaid
 
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
we have reason to think the federal
 
00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
changes are likely to sustain funding to
 
00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 align:start position:0%
the state along with more
 
00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
flexibility the governor has proposed
 
00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
specific changes to the state
 
00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 align:start position:0%
Administration that will protect
 
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 align:start position:0%
patients while calibrating spending to
 
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
the while recalibrating spending the
 
00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee of our committee is
 
00:05:22.749 --> 00:05:22.759 align:start position:0%
evaluating the governor's process I will
 
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
remind you that in the previous budget
 
00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:26.759 align:start position:0%
we made a substantial increase in
 
00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.160 align:start position:0%
Medicaid due to the high inflation rate
 
00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
just prior to that budget now I've given
 
00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
you a lot of information in the speech
 
00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
and still did it in less than three
 
00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
minutes this is the time limit we admire
 
00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080 align:start position:0%
in this chamber so we must restrict all
 
00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:50.639 align:start position:0%
your speeches to that time limit so that
 
00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.280 align:start position:0%
more of you can speak I have over a
 
00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.000 align:start position:0%
hundred requests I also request that you
 
00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560 align:start position:0%
avoid duplicative remarks if several of
 
00:05:59.870 --> 00:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
you are speaking on the same topic
 
00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:01.759 align:start position:0%
please shorten your remarks to something
 
00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:04.600 align:start position:0%
like I am also speaking on whatever the
 
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
topic was I agree with the previous
 
00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:08.840 align:start position:0%
speaker and have nothing to add or if
 
00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:10.759 align:start position:0%
there was some brief thing that differs
 
00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:12.639 align:start position:0%
from the previous person that would be a
 
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
good time to add it so that is what we
 
00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:19.160 align:start position:0%
here for here's the house finance
 
00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.000 align:start position:0%

Marat counties though I'm speaking on
 
00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
behalf of myself today and um I wanted
 
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:23.400 align:start position:0%
to ask that you please um look at adding
 
00:07:26.749 --> 00:07:26.759 align:start position:0%
back in the um money that was taken out
 
00:07:28.869 --> 00:07:28.879 align:start position:0%
for supporting transportation for the
 
00:07:28.879 --> 00:07:30.110 align:start position:0%
for supporting transportation for the
banum

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
banum
 
00:07:34.629 --> 00:07:34.639 align:start position:0%
of uh 6.8 million uh I also wanted to
 
00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
speak to the Medicaid that you mentioned
 
00:07:39.629 --> 00:07:39.639 align:start position:0%
um I work as an independent contractor
 
00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:43.360 align:start position:0%
and my income is very fluctuating but I
 
00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:45.800 align:start position:0%
tend to fall into that Granite St the
 
00:07:49.629 --> 00:07:49.639 align:start position:0%
granite advantage of um 100% plus
 
00:07:53.629 --> 00:07:53.639 align:start position:0%
poverty um by a little bit and this 5%
 
00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:56.360 align:start position:0%
increase would be an income tax I'd have
 
00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
to pay and I would not be sure exactly
 
00:07:59.790 --> 00:07:59.800 align:start position:0%
what amount I would be paying paying
 
00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:02.080 align:start position:0%
since my income literally changes from
 
00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:04.360 align:start position:0%
month to month I've had some months
 
00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
where I've made as little as 200 I've
 
00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:07.280 align:start position:0%
had some months where I've made almost
 
00:08:09.629 --> 00:08:09.639 align:start position:0%
1,000 and so not knowing how much I'd
 
00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:11.560 align:start position:0%
have to set aside would be a huge
 
00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
problem uh especially since some of my
 
00:08:16.589 --> 00:08:16.599 align:start position:0%
medical needs are not always covered by
 
00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:20.120 align:start position:0%
my Medicaid thank you very much and um I
 
00:08:22.469 --> 00:08:22.479 align:start position:0%
wish you luck with all the testimony

just a little background Anna is 28
 
00:09:51.269 --> 00:09:51.279 align:start position:0%
years old has been availing herself of I
 
00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:52.760 align:start position:0%
guess what we call Northern Human
 
00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
Services uh since birth since the day
 
00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:57.240 align:start position:0%
she came home uh from the hospital
 
00:10:00.069 --> 00:10:00.079 align:start position:0%
Intensive Care Unit at Dartmouth and our
 
00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
family really relies on these services
 
00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:06.640 align:start position:0%
and so we're very concerned to see uh
 
00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
that they continue to be funded and also
 
00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:11.079 align:start position:0%
there needs to be a mechanism in there
 
00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:14.240 align:start position:0%
for inflationary concerns especially
 
00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:17.240 align:start position:0%
when it comes to paying for inhome
 
00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:20.440 align:start position:0%
supports uh and support people that help
 
00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
us inside our home um Anna uh has
 
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
benefited from these Services her entire
 
00:10:31.269 --> 00:10:31.279 align:start position:0%
life it is very hard when you're in her
 
00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
condition she has a neurological
 
00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
condition by the way she understands
 
00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:36.920 align:start position:0%
everything that's going on here today
 
00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
she can see here everybody she just
 
00:10:41.829 --> 00:10:41.839 align:start position:0%
can't speak for herself I might also
 
00:10:44.069 --> 00:10:44.079 align:start position:0%
mention she's a registered voter so if
 
00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
there's anybody here from the Carol
 
00:10:48.629 --> 00:10:48.639 align:start position:0%
County de delegation keep that in mind
 
00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:53.480 align:start position:0%
um um uh so early on we've relied on
 
00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
these services to purchase things like
 
00:10:59.030 --> 00:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
wheelchair ramps U modifi modifications
 
00:11:01.949 --> 00:11:01.959 align:start position:0%
uh so she can get in a wheelchair van uh
 
00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:04.200 align:start position:0%
simple tasks that many of us take for
 
00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:06.760 align:start position:0%
granted I used to take for granted are
 
00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:08.680 align:start position:0%
very difficult for Anna getting around
 
00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
so the socialization aspect from these
 
00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
funds is really important also just the
 
00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
fact that paying inh home support is
 
00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
getting more difficult especially in The
 
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
Lakes region where uh jobs are um trying
 
00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:26.240 align:start position:0%
to hire people is very difficult and
 
00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
trying to pay a living wage to folks
 
00:11:31.509 --> 00:11:31.519 align:start position:0%
that come into our house to help care
 
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
for Anna so we can have vital respit
 
00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:36.760 align:start position:0%
time uh and mental health break if you
 
00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
will for my wife and I uh because when
 
00:11:40.829 --> 00:11:40.839 align:start position:0%
we don't have that support it's her and
 
00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
I my wife and I
 
00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
247 so these funds uh not only need to
 
00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:50.600 align:start position:0%
be uh continued but uh find some way to
 
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:54.440 align:start position:0%
pay these caregivers uh a decent wage
 
00:11:57.269 --> 00:11:57.279 align:start position:0%
it's a shame that uh folks that work for
 
00:11:59.870 --> 00:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
us my daughter is medically involved uh
 
00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
nobody can even work with her until
 
00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
they've had a month's worth of training
 
00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
and uh they're paid uh less than
 
00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
McDonald's employees no offense against
 
00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
McDonald's employees so um so I asked
 
00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:14.120 align:start position:0%
for the committee's uh uh thorough
 
00:12:16.189 --> 00:12:16.199 align:start position:0%
examination of this and you know the
 
00:12:17.949 --> 00:12:17.959 align:start position:0%

of supporting people like my daughter we
 
00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
want that to continue thank you three
 
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:43.800 align:start position:0%

Hampshire resident and she um would be
 
00:13:07.509 --> 00:13:07.519 align:start position:0%
severely impacted by any cuts to
 
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
Medicaid she is uh in a day program uh
 
00:13:13.829 --> 00:13:13.839 align:start position:0%
through Community Partners uh in area 9
 
00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
and she also lives with a skilled home
 
00:13:19.269 --> 00:13:19.279 align:start position:0%
provider uh who is her caregiver and
 
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
receives a a good a decent salary for
 
00:13:24.829 --> 00:13:24.839 align:start position:0%
the very hard work that she
 
00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
does Medicaid is such an important
 
00:13:29.189 --> 00:13:29.199 align:start position:0%
program and it's more than just
 
00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
Healthcare it funds the services that we
 
00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:33.320 align:start position:0%
receive through Community Partners in
 
00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:36.760 align:start position:0%
area 9 and I was here in 2011 to urge uh
 
00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:39.320 align:start position:0%
the folks to uh fully fund the weight
 
00:13:42.069 --> 00:13:42.079 align:start position:0%
list uh back in 2011 because Alyssa was
 
00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
uh aging out of the school district what
 
00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
were we going to do um if she didn't
 
00:13:48.829 --> 00:13:48.839 align:start position:0%
have a day program to go to I would have
 
00:13:51.269 --> 00:13:51.279 align:start position:0%
had to quit my job I had a mortgage to
 
00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
pay I would have had lost my home in
 
00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
foreclosure and then what if I can't
 
00:13:59.189 --> 00:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
make a living and Alyssa is not uh in a
 
00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
Day program out in the socialization
 
00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
piece from the last speaker very very
 
00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:06.920 align:start position:0%
important um you know where would we be
 
00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:10.360 align:start position:0%
um so if we can all agree that we all
 
00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:12.920 align:start position:0%
deserve health care right but we're
 
00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
worried about the financial aspect of it
 
00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
I would ask you to consider the velocity
 
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
of money if you pay a shop owner $100
 
00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
for a good in their shop that $100 that
 
00:14:26.389 --> 00:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
shop owner takes and maybe pays somebody
 
00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
else for a $100 service that $100
 
00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
service is going to be paying for that
 
00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:35.320 align:start position:0%
person's mortgage their taxes whatever
 
00:14:37.509 --> 00:14:37.519 align:start position:0%
um you know expenses they have the money
 
00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:39.880 align:start position:0%
keeps going that's the economy and I
 
00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:41.560 align:start position:0%
want you to know that Medicaid money it
 
00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't just disappear in a vacuum it
 
00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:45.720 align:start position:0%
isn't just this Giants amounts of money
 
00:14:47.749 --> 00:14:47.759 align:start position:0%
that just goes you know that's spent on
 
00:14:49.829 --> 00:14:49.839 align:start position:0%
something that's not worthwhile it helps
 
00:14:52.389 --> 00:14:52.399 align:start position:0%
keep the economy
 
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
going it funds the salaries of the
 
00:14:56.189 --> 00:14:56.199 align:start position:0%
people that provide the services for
 
00:14:58.389 --> 00:14:58.399 align:start position:0%
Alyssa's Day program and her skilled Pro
 
00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
home providers and if those funds are
 
00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:03.160 align:start position:0%
cut I'll be back where I was in 2011
 
00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:05.320 align:start position:0%
having to quit my job in danger of
 
00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
losing my home and just staying home
 
00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
with Alysa not knowing if her health
 
00:15:12.189 --> 00:15:12.199 align:start position:0%
care and her needs will be
 
00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:14.440 align:start position:0%
met thank
 
00:15:19.509 --> 00:15:19.519 align:start position:0%

director of operations um of Team select
 
00:16:27.629 --> 00:16:27.639 align:start position:0%
home care we are a Home Care Agency that

provides private dut nursing and home
 
00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:32.440 align:start position:0%
health aid for medically fragile
 
00:16:34.749 --> 00:16:34.759 align:start position:0%
patients I'm here today to strongly
 
00:16:37.509 --> 00:16:37.519 align:start position:0%
oppose the proposed 3% Medicaid budget
 
00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:40.120 align:start position:0%
cut while this cut may seem like a cost
 
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
saving measure it has ultimately lead to
 
00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:44.920 align:start position:0%
far greater expenses serious
 
00:16:47.069 --> 00:16:47.079 align:start position:0%
consequences for vulnerable patients who
 
00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:50.360 align:start position:0%
rely on home care services if this cut
 
00:16:52.749 --> 00:16:52.759 align:start position:0%
goes into effect home care agencies such
 
00:16:55.509 --> 00:16:55.519 align:start position:0%
like ours will struggle to attend I'm
 
00:16:58.230 --> 00:16:58.240 align:start position:0%
sorry to afford nurses and caregivers
 
00:17:00.309 --> 00:17:00.319 align:start position:0%
necessary to provide critical care for
 
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
our patients these patients many of whom
 
00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:05.640 align:start position:0%
are children with complex medical needs
 
00:17:08.029 --> 00:17:08.039 align:start position:0%
will be left without medical support
 
00:17:08.039 --> 00:17:09.510 align:start position:0%
will be left without medical support
they're

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
they're
 
00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
required sorry to remain stable at home
 
00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
without proper Home Care these
 
00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
individuals are at much higher risk of
 
00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:21.160 align:start position:0%
hospital visits which are sign sign
 
00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
sorry sign much more cost to the current
 
00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:27.880 align:start position:0%
Medicaid um much more cost than the
 
00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:29.720 align:start position:0%
Medicaid reimbursement
 
00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:32.240 align:start position:0%
um rates we only need to look back at a
 
00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:34.720 align:start position:0%
covid-19 p pandemic to see what happens
 
00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:37.480 align:start position:0%
when Hospital emmissions are surge
 
00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
Medicaid bore the financial burden of
 
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
those emissions and without adequate
 
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
Home Care F funding we could see a
 
00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
repeat of those crisis of this crisis on
 
00:17:48.029 --> 00:17:48.039 align:start position:0%
the positive Aid the increase on
 
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
Medicaid funding we've re we received
 
00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:52.600 align:start position:0%
has made remarkable impact thanks to the
 
00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:55.000 align:start position:0%
investment of um of our agency to our
 
00:17:57.870 --> 00:17:57.880 align:start position:0%
agency team select was able to hire 102
 
00:17:59.510 --> 00:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
more additional caregivers
 
00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
this allowed to improve our caregiver
 
00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
retention rate by
 
00:18:05.669 --> 00:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
87.3% a critical factor in ensuring
 
00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
continuity of care as a result we've
 
00:18:10.549 --> 00:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
been able to provide an additional 4,000
 
00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:13.720 align:start position:0%
weekly care hours that's over 28,000
 
00:18:17.789 --> 00:18:17.799 align:start position:0%
hours of annual care most importantly
 
00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:20.360 align:start position:0%
this investment kept 168 Patients Out of
 
00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:22.440 align:start position:0%
the hospitals with many of them
 
00:18:24.149 --> 00:18:24.159 align:start position:0%
graduating from our program no longer
 
00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
requiring medical coverage this success

00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
of one of our patients who is currently
 
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
not here at the moment but I'm use the
 
00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
initials as Li a 15-month old boy who
 
00:18:43.549 --> 00:18:43.559 align:start position:0%
depends on gtube trick and vent Li U
 
00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:45.880 align:start position:0%
spent his first two months and a half of
 
00:18:47.909 --> 00:18:47.919 align:start position:0%
his life in a niku but thanks to the
 
00:18:49.789 --> 00:18:49.799 align:start position:0%
care we've been able to provide at home
 
00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:51.200 align:start position:0%
he hasn't had a single Hospital
 
00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:53.320 align:start position:0%
admissions since we began suppor since
 
00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:55.640 align:start position:0%
we've been providing care for them this
 
00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
was us this has saved Medicaid thousands
 
00:18:59.950 --> 00:18:59.960 align:start position:0%
of dollars and that just one child
 
00:19:01.549 --> 00:19:01.559 align:start position:0%

thousands of patients in similar
 
00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:05.960 align:start position:0%
situation cutting Medicaid's budget by
 
00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
3% won't save money it will increase
 
00:19:10.149 --> 00:19:10.159 align:start position:0%
hospital emmissions and drive costs even
 
00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
much higher continue investment in home
 
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
care is crucial not just to control
 
00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:17.200 align:start position:0%

inclusion of the group two retirement

significant reforms to the state's

retirement system aimed at improving the

state's Financial stability while the

intent was to strengthen the system
 
00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:28.600 align:start position:0%
these reforms introduced sweet sweeping
 
00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:30.520 align:start position:0%
changes to the benefit structure for
 
00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
employees already in service changes
 
00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
that fundamentally altered the terms
 
00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
under which they had been hired and the
 
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
benefits that they were promised the
 
00:25:40.549 --> 00:25:40.559 align:start position:0%
impact of these changes has been
 
00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:43.000 align:start position:0%
profound and far-reaching creating an
 
00:25:44.669 --> 00:25:44.679 align:start position:0%
unintended ripple effect throughout
 
00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
Public Safety in New Hampshire many of
 
00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
those affected commonly referred to as
 
00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
the tier B group have expressed deep
 
00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:52.960 align:start position:0%
concern and frustration as they
 
00:25:54.789 --> 00:25:54.799 align:start position:0%
witnessed their retirement benefits
 
00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:56.320 align:start position:0%
which they had worked hard to earn being
 
00:25:58.789 --> 00:25:58.799 align:start position:0%
Stripped Away
 
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
this has led many to seek employment in
 
00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:02.120 align:start position:0%
neighboring states or to leave their
 
00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:04.360 align:start position:0%
profession entirely this Exodus
 
00:26:06.389 --> 00:26:06.399 align:start position:0%
threatens to undermine the Integrity of
 
00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:08.240 align:start position:0%
Public Safety in our state leaving the
 
00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
rest of us to pick up the
 
00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
pieces given that word of mouth is the
 
00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:13.880 align:start position:0%
most powerful form of advertising
 
00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
reinstating these benefits for those who
 
00:26:17.269 --> 00:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
had them taken away should be seen as
 
00:26:19.149 --> 00:26:19.159 align:start position:0%
the most effective strategy for
 
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
retaining senior leadership and
 
00:26:22.669 --> 00:26:22.679 align:start position:0%
attracting The Leaders of Tomorrow it
 
00:26:24.789 --> 00:26:24.799 align:start position:0%

the state upholds its integrity and
 
00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:29.000 align:start position:0%
keeps its promises the reality that we
 
00:26:31.149 --> 00:26:31.159 align:start position:0%
face today is undeniable New Hampshire
 
00:26:32.909 --> 00:26:32.919 align:start position:0%
is struggling to retain some of our most
 
00:26:35.029 --> 00:26:35.039 align:start position:0%
highly trained and experienced leaders
 
00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
and it has been widely acknowledged that
 
00:26:38.789 --> 00:26:38.799 align:start position:0%
many who have left the profession have
 
00:26:40.669 --> 00:26:40.679 align:start position:0%
done so because of the Midstream changes
 
00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
to their benefits this is not merely an
 
00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
issue of policy it is a matter of equity
 
00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
and fairness for those who have
 
00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
dedicated their lives to protecting

retirement Provisions included in hb2
 
00:26:57.470 --> 00:26:57.480 align:start position:0%
are a critical step towards preventing
 
00:26:59.669 --> 00:26:59.679 align:start position:0%
the continued loss of some of our most
 
00:27:01.789 --> 00:27:01.799 align:start position:0%
qualified and committed leaders more
 
00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:03.320 align:start position:0%
importantly they fulfill the promise
 
00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:05.000 align:start position:0%
made to those who serve and protect the
 
00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:06.960 align:start position:0%

Representatives for their overwhelming
 
00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
support of these very same Provisions in
 
00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
the 2023 budget which passed with strong
 
00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:23.720 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support 282 votes to 80 this
 
00:27:25.549 --> 00:27:25.559 align:start position:0%
demonstrates the broad recognition of
 
00:27:27.269 --> 00:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
the importance of restoring these
 
00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
benefits not only for Public Safety
 
00:27:31.029 --> 00:27:31.039 align:start position:0%
professionals but for the safety and
 
00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
well-being of New Hampshire residents we
 
00:27:34.510 --> 00:27:34.520 align:start position:0%

Campo and I'm representing the New
 
00:27:53.909 --> 00:27:53.919 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Troopers Association I'm here
 
00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:55.720 align:start position:0%
to speak in support of the group two
 
00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
middle tier retirement provision that
 
00:27:58.669 --> 00:27:58.679 align:start position:0%
was presented in the the governor's
 
00:28:01.029 --> 00:28:01.039 align:start position:0%
budget this provision is very similar to
 
00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
the bill that the house overwhelmingly
 
00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:05.360 align:start position:0%
passed two years ago it offers no new
 
00:28:07.269 --> 00:28:07.279 align:start position:0%
benefits it simply restores benefits
 
00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:09.320 align:start position:0%
that were unfairly taken away from First
 
00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:11.640 align:start position:0%
Responders prior to those changes New
 
00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:13.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire never had an issue retaining
 
00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:15.880 align:start position:0%
police officers since then especially in
 
00:28:18.029 --> 00:28:18.039 align:start position:0%
the past five or six years Police
 
00:28:19.549 --> 00:28:19.559 align:start position:0%
Service in the state has become a
 
00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:21.880 align:start position:0%
revolving door those pension changes
 
00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
that took effect 13 years ago have
 
00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:26.120 align:start position:0%
changed the culture and police work
 
00:28:27.549 --> 00:28:27.559 align:start position:0%
being a police officer in New Hampshire
 
00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:29.880 align:start position:0%
is no longer you're considered a career
 
00:28:32.149 --> 00:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
it's considered more of a job it simply
 
00:28:34.149 --> 00:28:34.159 align:start position:0%
isn't worth spending a whole career in
 
00:28:36.269 --> 00:28:36.279 align:start position:0%
police work in New Hampshire I have
 
00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:38.320 align:start position:0%
worked for the State Police for 20 years
 
00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:41.080 align:start position:0%
and in the past 10 15 years I have seen
 
00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
scores of well-qualified and talented
 
00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
men and women leave the state police for
 
00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:47.360 align:start position:0%
other law enforcement agencies in other
 
00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:49.240 align:start position:0%
states um as well as the federal
 
00:28:50.549 --> 00:28:50.559 align:start position:0%
government that offer much better
 
00:28:52.909 --> 00:28:52.919 align:start position:0%
retirement benefits uh it's time to
 
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
change the culture back to how it was
 
00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:56.840 align:start position:0%
the citizens of New Hampshire want their
 
00:28:58.430 --> 00:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
public safety personnel to view their
 
00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
service as a career not just a job those
 
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
middle tier members that had their
 
00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
benefits stripped 13 years ago are now
 
00:29:07.789 --> 00:29:07.799 align:start position:0%
the senior personnel and the leaders in
 
00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
police and fire departments across the
 
00:29:11.549 --> 00:29:11.559 align:start position:0%
state the time is now to restore the
 
00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:13.320 align:start position:0%
benefits that were taken from them so
 
00:29:15.669 --> 00:29:15.679 align:start position:0%
these leaders can in good faith begin to
 
00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:18.360 align:start position:0%
change the culture back to how it was
 
00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:19.549 align:start position:0%
change the culture back to how it was

Police Association I'm also a sergeant
 
00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
with the Nashville Police Department I'm
 
00:29:41.029 --> 00:29:41.039 align:start position:0%
here to urge the house finance committee
 
00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
to support house bill to in particularly
 
00:29:44.389 --> 00:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
the restoring of benefits to the group
 
00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
two middle
 
00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:48.320 align:start position:0%
tier what we've recognized since these
 
00:29:50.269 --> 00:29:50.279 align:start position:0%
changes is police and fire departments
 
00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:52.200 align:start position:0%
across the state are struggling to
 
00:29:54.909 --> 00:29:54.919 align:start position:0%
retain their qualified people with much
 
00:29:56.149 --> 00:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
of the workforce coming from our
 
00:29:58.350 --> 00:29:58.360 align:start position:0%
neighboring states we have to stay
 
00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
competitive with our retirement we are
 
00:30:02.509 --> 00:30:02.519 align:start position:0%
currently not and more so we have fallen
 
00:30:02.519 --> 00:30:03.470 align:start position:0%
currently not and more so we have fallen
behind

00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:03.480 align:start position:0%
behind
 
00:30:06.269 --> 00:30:06.279 align:start position:0%
significantly for example in Nash
 
00:30:08.269 --> 00:30:08.279 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts has has been our number
 
00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
one competitor and resource for
 
00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
employees the Nashville Police
 
00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
Department currently has 164 active
 
00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
police officers with more than 20
 
00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:21.240 align:start position:0%
openings 107 of those 164 are from
 
00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts that's 64% of our police
 
00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
department since
 
00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
2011 the nille police department has
 
00:30:32.669 --> 00:30:32.679 align:start position:0%
lost 69 officers to resignation that's
 
00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:35.080 align:start position:0%
officers that resigned prior to reaching
 
00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
their retirement
 
00:30:40.029 --> 00:30:40.039 align:start position:0%
benefits of those 69 27 of them left to
 
00:30:42.669 --> 00:30:42.679 align:start position:0%
go to Massachusetts law enforcement all
 
00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:45.240 align:start position:0%
citing that the retirement issues in the
 
00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:46.840 align:start position:0%
greater benefit in Massachusetts is the
 
00:30:47.789 --> 00:30:47.799 align:start position:0%
reason for
 
00:30:50.509 --> 00:30:50.519 align:start position:0%
leaving each officer who leaves it costs
 
00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:52.600 align:start position:0%
the city of Nashville over $100,000 to
 
00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:54.640 align:start position:0%
replace that officer in approximately 12
 
00:30:56.430 --> 00:30:56.440 align:start position:0%
months of training to get them up and
 
00:30:57.629 --> 00:30:57.639 align:start position:0%
running before they're considered part
 
00:30:59.509 --> 00:30:59.519 align:start position:0%
of the uh staff to go out there and
 
00:31:01.029 --> 00:31:01.039 align:start position:0%
protect the uh the
 
00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
community that's a great cost to the
 
00:31:05.389 --> 00:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
city and this is a sweeping uh problem
 
00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
for each and every Community within the
 
00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
state so again I urge the committee to
 
00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
support the restoration of the group two
 
00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
middle tier retirement so we can provide
 
00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:15.080 align:start position:0%
the retirement benefits that our
 
00:31:17.149 --> 00:31:17.159 align:start position:0%
dedicated First Responders deserve and
 
00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:19.480 align:start position:0%

00:31:21.389 --> 00:31:21.399 align:start position:0%
officers here in our communities and
 
00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:23.200 align:start position:0%

00:32:51.389 --> 00:32:51.399 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire remained to
 
00:32:53.629 --> 00:32:53.639 align:start position:0%
be the only state in the United States
 
00:32:58.110 --> 00:32:58.120 align:start position:0%

fails to cover its obligations life gets
 
00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
harder for local property taxpayers when
 
00:34:47.909 --> 00:34:47.919 align:start position:0%
the state faces a difficult budget
 
00:34:50.470 --> 00:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
environment and cuts spending local

budget local property taxes went up to
 
00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
cover the difference by hundreds of
 
00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars contributing to the
 
00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
high taxes many of us pay today when the

today and I want to call your attention
 
00:36:52.069 --> 00:36:52.079 align:start position:0%
to the ongoing needs of the mental
 
00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:54.160 align:start position:0%
health system in New Hampshire we've
 
00:36:56.270 --> 00:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
made some significant progress but more
 
00:36:58.190 --> 00:36:58.200 align:start position:0%
work needs to be done we're happy that
 
00:36:59.950 --> 00:36:59.960 align:start position:0%
the governor has called for an
 
00:37:02.069 --> 00:37:02.079 align:start position:0%
investment in mental health but we want
 
00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:03.880 align:start position:0%
to make sure you understand what our
 
00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:06.440 align:start position:0%
priorities are and our priorities really
 
00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
center around uncompensated care housing
 
00:37:13.630 --> 00:37:13.640 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rates and community behavioral
 
00:37:16.829 --> 00:37:16.839 align:start position:0%
health clinics so for uncompensated Care
 
00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Centers eat if you will
 
00:37:21.870 --> 00:37:21.880 align:start position:0%
giving services to people who medically
 
00:37:24.069 --> 00:37:24.079 align:start position:0%
need the services that we provide but we
 
00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
can't collect from private insurance and
 
00:37:28.990 --> 00:37:29.000 align:start position:0%
others on we also have to deal with
 
00:37:30.829 --> 00:37:30.839 align:start position:0%
people who have Medicaid who are on
 
00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
what's called in- andout um that's a
 
00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:36.040 align:start position:0%
very popular program not with me or
 
00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
anybody else that I know of but it is a
 
00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
deductible for people who are poor who
 
00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
can't afford to make those payments and
 
00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
in order to get their medication and
 
00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
other services we the Community Mental
 
00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
Health Centers eat those cost the
 
00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:52.079 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rates we are calling for an
 
00:37:54.309 --> 00:37:54.319 align:start position:0%
increase in Medicaid rates that's
 
00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
sustainable and ongoing because as you
 
00:37:59.710 --> 00:37:59.720 align:start position:0%
know our Workforce is dwindling and we
 
00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
can't attract people who we can't pay
 
00:38:05.109 --> 00:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
wages that they can live on we also know
 
00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
that the state of New Hampshire has
 
00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:08.920 align:start position:0%
invested a lot of money in what's called
 
00:38:11.470 --> 00:38:11.480 align:start position:0%
community behavioral health clinics
 
00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:12.920 align:start position:0%
those are a
 
00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:15.160 align:start position:0%
transformational change to mental health
 
00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:17.720 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire where you have One-Stop
 
00:38:20.109 --> 00:38:20.119 align:start position:0%
shopping and you treat the whole person
 
00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:22.040 align:start position:0%
so you have medical services and Mental
 
00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
Health Services allinone um the state
 
00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:26.920 align:start position:0%
has made a significant investment but
 
00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:28.440 align:start position:0%
it's going to take take the legislature
 
00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
to keep it up because it was funded on
 
00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:34.040 align:start position:0%
grants and has proven to be successful
 
00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:35.720 align:start position:0%
we have three Mental Health Centers
 
00:38:38.069 --> 00:38:38.079 align:start position:0%
right now West Central naswa and
 
00:38:40.829 --> 00:38:40.839 align:start position:0%
Manchester operating clinics so I thank
 
00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:52.760 align:start position:0%
afternoon thank you next will be Mary
 
00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:55.400 align:start position:0%
wilky followed by Tim
 
00:38:58.349 --> 00:38:58.359 align:start position:0%
Diaz thank you I'm Mary Wilkey I'm a
 
00:39:00.349 --> 00:39:00.359 align:start position:0%
property taxpayer from conquer and I
 
00:39:02.069 --> 00:39:02.079 align:start position:0%
urge you to take any money you might
 
00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
consider allocating for Universal
 
00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:05.720 align:start position:0%
vouchers and direct it instead to our
 
00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:08.720 align:start position:0%
Public Schools uh proponents of vouchers
 
00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:10.760 align:start position:0%
will often tell stories of children who
 
00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
have found something lacking in their
 
00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
Public School saying we need to
 
00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
prioritize what's best for each
 
00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
individual student but their focus is
 
00:39:19.829 --> 00:39:19.839 align:start position:0%
always on the child who wants to leave
 
00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:22.760 align:start position:0%
the public school and never on those who
 
00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:25.160 align:start position:0%
remain take two High School classmates
 
00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
Josie and Marie both love art but their
 
00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
school can't afford to provide art
 
00:39:31.950 --> 00:39:31.960 align:start position:0%
classes their Public School the best way
 
00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:33.720 align:start position:0%
to address their individual needs would
 
00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:35.480 align:start position:0%
be to fund the district well enough that
 
00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:37.880 align:start position:0%
it can provide art which would benefit
 
00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
them and many others but what happens if
 
00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
instead we rely on a voucher program
 
00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
Josie's parents take a voucher and send
 
00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
her to a private school with art classes
 
00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:48.920 align:start position:0%
and her needs are met but Marie's
 
00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
parents don't have that choice because
 
00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
maybe they can't afford the difference
 
00:39:54.589 --> 00:39:54.599 align:start position:0%
between the voucher and the tuition of
 
00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
the school maybe they can't provide
 
00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:57.870 align:start position:0%
the school maybe they can't provide
transportation

00:39:57.870 --> 00:39:57.880 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
00:39:59.550 --> 00:39:59.560 align:start position:0%
maybe Marie has a learning disability
 
00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
and needs special ed services that
 
00:40:04.069 --> 00:40:04.079 align:start position:0%
private schools usually do not offer or
 
00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:06.040 align:start position:0%
maybe no private school will admit Marie
 
00:40:07.589 --> 00:40:07.599 align:start position:0%
because she has a bad report card or
 
00:40:10.510 --> 00:40:10.520 align:start position:0%
disciplinary issues so how exactly do
 
00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
Universal vouchers prioritize Marie's
 
00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:15.720 align:start position:0%
needs over time as more money is
 
00:40:17.950 --> 00:40:17.960 align:start position:0%
diverted from Marie's school to pay for
 
00:40:20.349 --> 00:40:20.359 align:start position:0%
vouchers her opportunities will diminish
 
00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
maybe World Language your lab science
 
00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:24.640 align:start position:0%
classes will be cut or class sizes
 
00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
increased and this in turn will make
 
00:40:29.309 --> 00:40:29.319 align:start position:0%
vouchers more attractive to those who
 
00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
can use them diverting even more money
 
00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
away from Marie's school this cycle will
 
00:40:36.349 --> 00:40:36.359 align:start position:0%
ultimately lead to two parallel systems
 
00:40:38.829 --> 00:40:38.839 align:start position:0%
of educating educating the public a
 
00:40:41.349 --> 00:40:41.359 align:start position:0%
separate and unequal system that meets
 
00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
the needs of students like Josie and
 
00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
leaves those like Marie with less
 
00:40:48.069 --> 00:40:48.079 align:start position:0%
opportunity with every passing Year from
 
00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
its beginning the whole premise of
 
00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:52.400 align:start position:0%
public education has been to offer
 
00:40:55.349 --> 00:40:55.359 align:start position:0%
opportunity to every child regardless of
 
00:40:57.910 --> 00:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
income or any other Factor and the way
 
00:40:59.910 --> 00:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
to do that is to fully fund our public
 
00:41:02.190 --> 00:41:02.200 align:start position:0%
schools which are open and accessible to
 
00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
everyone thank
 
00:41:14.589 --> 00:41:14.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:17.720 align:start position:0%
you next Tim Diaz please restrict your
 
00:41:20.349 --> 00:41:20.359 align:start position:0%
remarks to three minutes that will be
 
00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:22.520 align:start position:0%

my name is Tim Diaz and I am the
 
00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
executive director of Meals on Wheels of
 
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:34.200 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County I also serve as
 
00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:35.640 align:start position:0%
chairman of Meals on Wheels New
 
00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:37.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a group which represents all
 
00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
of the Meals on Wheels agencies in the
 
00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
state at occasions such as this our
 
00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
agencies provide nutritious meals safety
 
00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
checks and precious human interaction to
 
00:41:50.430 --> 00:41:50.440 align:start position:0%
older adults in our state in congregate
 
00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:52.720 align:start position:0%
settings such as senior centers and
 
00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
often sometimes in local restaurants as
 
00:41:57.550 --> 00:41:57.560 align:start position:0%
well as hom delivered meals on behalf of
 
00:41:59.710 --> 00:41:59.720 align:start position:0%
the over 20,000 citizens of the state
 
00:42:02.069 --> 00:42:02.079 align:start position:0%
whom we serve I'd like to thank you for
 
00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
your past support and to ask you to
 
00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:06.520 align:start position:0%
revisit the prioritized needs submitted
 
00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
by DHHS which proposes a modest increase
 
00:42:11.589 --> 00:42:11.599 align:start position:0%
to the reimbursement rate we receive for
 
00:42:14.670 --> 00:42:14.680 align:start position:0%
the nearly 1.8 million meals we serve
 
00:42:17.069 --> 00:42:17.079 align:start position:0%
each year it is our understanding that
 
00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:18.680 align:start position:0%
this new rate was derived from a recent
 
00:42:22.589 --> 00:42:22.599 align:start position:0%
DHHS study of the cost agencies like our
 
00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:24.640 align:start position:0%
ours pay for the services we
 
00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
provide your support of this request
 
00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
would help ensure the financial
 
00:42:31.150 --> 00:42:31.160 align:start position:0%
stability and indeed sometimes survival
 
00:42:33.630 --> 00:42:33.640 align:start position:0%
of agencies like ours and that means we
 
00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:35.640 align:start position:0%
can continue to serve our clients in the
 
00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
face of riseing cost means we can feed
 
00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
them chat with them make sure they're
 
00:42:43.829 --> 00:42:43.839 align:start position:0%
okay and call a loved one or Protective
 
00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:45.200 align:start position:0%
Services if we're
 
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
concerned I hope I don't have to tell
 
00:42:49.390 --> 00:42:49.400 align:start position:0%
you that to the extent our service helps
 
00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:52.480 align:start position:0%
people age in place at their home doing
 
00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
so is much less expensive for everyone
 
00:42:58.430 --> 00:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
involved than an unnecessary move to
 
00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
assisted living or even a nursing home
 
00:43:02.829 --> 00:43:02.839 align:start position:0%
and that move very often comes after a
 
00:43:06.510 --> 00:43:06.520 align:start position:0%
911 call due to a fall which can
 
00:43:08.829 --> 00:43:08.839 align:start position:0%
sometimes be prevented by catching a
 
00:43:11.589 --> 00:43:11.599 align:start position:0%
safety issue at someone's home what you
 
00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
might not have heard though because you
 
00:43:15.430 --> 00:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
are literally buried in budget numbers I
 
00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
understand is that something like 30% of
 
00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
our home delivery clients Statewide tell
 
00:43:21.829 --> 00:43:21.839 align:start position:0%
us that their driver is the only person
 
00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
they see every
 
00:43:25.829 --> 00:43:25.839 align:start position:0%
week every
 
00:43:28.589 --> 00:43:28.599 align:start position:0%
week beond beyond that many report that
 
00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:30.040 align:start position:0%
the meals we deliver to them are their
 
00:43:32.589 --> 00:43:32.599 align:start position:0%
only source of nutrition in a given week
 
00:43:34.270 --> 00:43:34.280 align:start position:0%
so in terms of being the eyes and ears
 
00:43:36.270 --> 00:43:36.280 align:start position:0%
of the community on behalf of a citizen
 
00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:40.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes were it and make no
 
00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
mistake our clients are the people that
 
00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
served most of us in one way or another
 
00:43:47.349 --> 00:43:47.359 align:start position:0%

this job but I wouldn't be here if I
 
00:43:58.910 --> 00:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
didn't believe that we now have an
 
00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
obligation to serve them in a
 
00:44:03.230 --> 00:44:03.240 align:start position:0%
sustainable way that they should be able
 
00:44:05.790 --> 00:44:05.800 align:start position:0%
to trust us to look out for them the way
 
00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:09.200 align:start position:0%
we once trusted them to look after us I
 
00:44:11.589 --> 00:44:11.599 align:start position:0%
hope you agree so I thank you for your

farum thank you Mr chairman and members
 
00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
of the finance committee thank you for
 
00:44:38.829 --> 00:44:38.839 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to testify today my name
 
00:44:41.470 --> 00:44:41.480 align:start position:0%
is Joanne Wilhelm and I'm here to
 
00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
express my strong opposition opposition
 
00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
to hb1 and
 
00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
hb2 doing away with the interest and
 
00:44:51.870 --> 00:44:51.880 align:start position:0%
dividends taxed last year has created a
 
00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:54.640 align:start position:0%
budget problem in our state but cutting
 
00:44:56.549 --> 00:44:56.559 align:start position:0%
essential services for our most
 
00:44:59.670 --> 00:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
vulnerable citizens is no solution and
 
00:45:01.829 --> 00:45:01.839 align:start position:0%
it's devastating to the way of life here
 
00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire the governor's proposed
 
00:45:08.109 --> 00:45:08.119 align:start position:0%
budget makes deep and harmful cuts to
 
00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
Medicaid affordable child care and
 
00:45:14.430 --> 00:45:14.440 align:start position:0%
Housing Services that thousands of
 
00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
granite sters rely on these Cuts will
 
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
directly harm lowincome families seniors
 
00:45:25.069 --> 00:45:25.079 align:start position:0%
and people with disabilities leaving
 
00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
them without the support they need to
 
00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:28.480 align:start position:0%
survive and
 
00:45:31.790 --> 00:45:31.800 align:start position:0%
thrive at the same time this budget
 
00:45:34.510 --> 00:45:34.520 align:start position:0%
allocates millions of taxpayer dollars
 
00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:36.400 align:start position:0%
to fund private school
 
00:45:39.390 --> 00:45:39.400 align:start position:0%
vouchers primarily benefiting wealthy
 
00:45:42.390 --> 00:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
families who can already afford private
 
00:45:45.870 --> 00:45:45.880 align:start position:0%
education whose children were already
 
00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
attending private schools and are now
 
00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:53.160 align:start position:0%
receiving a significant cash bonus I
 
00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
want to remind this committee that the
 
00:45:58.030 --> 00:45:58.040 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account program was
 
00:46:01.390 --> 00:46:01.400 align:start position:0%
passed by being tucked away in the state
 
00:46:05.430 --> 00:46:05.440 align:start position:0%
budget several years ago do not allow
 
00:46:08.309 --> 00:46:08.319 align:start position:0%
this kind of lack of transparency to
 
00:46:11.589 --> 00:46:11.599 align:start position:0%
happen again this is an irresponsible
 
00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
use of public funds diverting resources
 
00:46:17.230 --> 00:46:17.240 align:start position:0%
away from the public schools and
 
00:46:19.549 --> 00:46:19.559 align:start position:0%
services that the vast majority of our
 
00:46:21.470 --> 00:46:21.480 align:start position:0%
residents depend
 
00:46:25.349 --> 00:46:25.359 align:start position:0%
on furthermore by reducing State funding
 
00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
for critical programs this budget shifts
 
00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
the financial burden onto our towns
 
00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:34.640 align:start position:0%
forcing them to raise local taxes just
 
00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
to maintain current service levels this
 
00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:42.280 align:start position:0%
approach is neither Fair nor
 
00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
sustainable I urge you to reject hb1 and
 
00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:49.960 align:start position:0%
hb2 and instead support a budget that
 
00:46:52.549 --> 00:46:52.559 align:start position:0%
prioritizes the needs of all of our
 
00:46:55.230 --> 00:46:55.240 align:start position:0%
residents particularly those who are
 
00:46:58.790 --> 00:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
most vulnerable and cannot be here today
 
00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:01.240 align:start position:0%
to speak for
 
00:47:04.549 --> 00:47:04.559 align:start position:0%
themselves our state must invest in
 
00:47:07.230 --> 00:47:07.240 align:start position:0%
strong Public Services not take them
 
00:47:19.230 --> 00:47:19.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:22.109 --> 00:47:22.119 align:start position:0%
consideration next will be Ellen farum
 
00:47:23.870 --> 00:47:23.880 align:start position:0%
followed by Rob
 
00:47:27.069 --> 00:47:27.079 align:start position:0%
NATO hi thank you for giving me this
 
00:47:29.710 --> 00:47:29.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak my name is Ellen
 
00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
farum and I live in Tamworth a small
 
00:47:35.950 --> 00:47:35.960 align:start position:0%
rural town with high property taxes we
 
00:47:38.510 --> 00:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
have an aging population with many
 
00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
people living on fixed incomes and we
 
00:47:43.870 --> 00:47:43.880 align:start position:0%
are struggling right now to fund Our
 
00:47:47.230 --> 00:47:47.240 align:start position:0%
Town services and our Public Schools I
 
00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:50.720 align:start position:0%
there find therefore find it astonishing
 
00:47:53.150 --> 00:47:53.160 align:start position:0%
that this proposed budget adds to our
 
00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
problems by including money for
 
00:47:57.549 --> 00:47:57.559 align:start position:0%
educational Freedom accounts
 
00:48:01.230 --> 00:48:01.240 align:start position:0%
I oppose efas as they would drive up our
 
00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:04.520 align:start position:0%
already high property taxes and largely
 
00:48:06.270 --> 00:48:06.280 align:start position:0%
benefit wealthy
 
00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:10.040 align:start position:0%
families my grandchildren two of whom
 
00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:11.270 align:start position:0%
families my grandchildren two of whom
have

00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:13.880 align:start position:0%
disabilities attend public schools where
 
00:48:16.030 --> 00:48:16.040 align:start position:0%
they receive a solid education and the
 
00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
services that had helped them grow and
 
00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:21.800 align:start position:0%
Thrive efas will not only cost our state
 
00:48:24.589 --> 00:48:24.599 align:start position:0%
more money but will undermine the public
 
00:48:27.309 --> 00:48:27.319 align:start position:0%
schools that have served my family so
 
00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
well this budget also hurts our most
 
00:48:32.589 --> 00:48:32.599 align:start position:0%
vulnerable families by underfunding
 
00:48:34.589 --> 00:48:34.599 align:start position:0%
important programs that have already
 
00:48:37.829 --> 00:48:37.839 align:start position:0%
been mentioned here including Medicaid
 
00:48:41.270 --> 00:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
and Housing Programs our we need the
 
00:48:44.030 --> 00:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
child care and a Workforce we need to
 
00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
attract a child for we need child care
 
00:48:50.549 --> 00:48:50.559 align:start position:0%
and to attract a Workforce into our area
 
00:48:52.549 --> 00:48:52.559 align:start position:0%
and to provide opportunities for our
 
00:48:54.710 --> 00:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
young people to live and work in our
 
00:48:57.950 --> 00:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
state this pill bill will drive property
 
00:49:00.630 --> 00:49:00.640 align:start position:0%
taxes up and harm families I
 
00:49:12.150 --> 00:49:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:23.349 --> 00:49:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
Carney good afternoon thank you for
 
00:49:28.430 --> 00:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
having me today my name is Rob NATO I'm
 
00:49:30.190 --> 00:49:30.200 align:start position:0%
a former educator and a member of the
 
00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:32.240 align:start position:0%
Hopkinson School Board and our board
 
00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
representative to the Hopkinson Town
 
00:49:36.430 --> 00:49:36.440 align:start position:0%
budget committee I'm here to encourage
 
00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
you to support the caveats of House Bill
 
00:49:43.870 --> 00:49:43.880 align:start position:0%
550 and 603 regarding adequacy and 734
 
00:49:45.630 --> 00:49:45.640 align:start position:0%
which I Now understand in heading back
 
00:49:47.870 --> 00:49:47.880 align:start position:0%
to committee the first two bills
 
00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:50.720 align:start position:0%
regarding adequacy in my view are simple
 
00:49:53.109 --> 00:49:53.119 align:start position:0%
open and shut cases of fact base
 
00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
adequacy as illustrated by the conal
 
00:49:57.510 --> 00:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
case currently comes nowhere close to
 
00:49:59.309 --> 00:49:59.319 align:start position:0%
meeting the financial realities of
 
00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
providing an adequate education for our
 
00:50:04.270 --> 00:50:04.280 align:start position:0%
students for a school board special
 
00:50:06.390 --> 00:50:06.400 align:start position:0%
education costs are the most difficult
 
00:50:08.510 --> 00:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
to forecast and most crippling to our
 
00:50:11.190 --> 00:50:11.200 align:start position:0%
budget process for instance in this
 
00:50:14.030 --> 00:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
calendar year we are upside down a half
 
00:50:16.950 --> 00:50:16.960 align:start position:0%
a million dollars based solely on two
 
00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
unforeseen out placements so yes I
 
00:50:22.750 --> 00:50:22.760 align:start position:0%
believe the base adequacy differentiated
 
00:50:25.270 --> 00:50:25.280 align:start position:0%
aid for special education as well as
 
00:50:28.510 --> 00:50:28.520 align:start position:0%
pration must be increase in this
 
00:50:31.349 --> 00:50:31.359 align:start position:0%
budget however I would like to refocus
 
00:50:33.349 --> 00:50:33.359 align:start position:0%
the discussion onto the equitable
 
00:50:36.150 --> 00:50:36.160 align:start position:0%
distribution of the tax burden Hopkinson
 
00:50:39.430 --> 00:50:39.440 align:start position:0%
just completed its 5-year revaluation in
 
00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
that process the magic number of 78%
 
00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
determined whether or not your taxes
 
00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
would rise or fall personally my
 
00:50:49.870 --> 00:50:49.880 align:start position:0%
property went to 83% my effective
 
00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
property tax rate as determined by a
 
00:50:55.230 --> 00:50:55.240 align:start position:0%
percentage of my income is 10% more than
 
00:50:57.190 --> 00:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
fair in my mind
 
00:50:58.990 --> 00:50:59.000 align:start position:0%
however I was curious about the folks
 
00:51:01.750 --> 00:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
where it was perhaps less more than fair
 
00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:04.240 align:start position:0%
so looking at the valuations I wanted to
 
00:51:06.430 --> 00:51:06.440 align:start position:0%
see the percentages that increased
 
00:51:08.670 --> 00:51:08.680 align:start position:0%
between 150 and
 
00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
500% that means their taxes were going
 
00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:11.710 align:start position:0%
500% that means their taxes were going
to

00:51:11.710 --> 00:51:11.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:51:14.829 --> 00:51:14.839 align:start position:0%
double what I found most striking was 62
 
00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
of the 127 properties that fell into
 
00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
that category were in The Meadows a
 
00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
quiet lovely mobile home park in
 
00:51:25.390 --> 00:51:25.400 align:start position:0%
Hopkinson where most of its residents
 
00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:28.720 align:start position:0%
are older some sometimes single often
 
00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
times un fixed incomes and their
 
00:51:32.950 --> 00:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
property taxes have doubled which is why
 
00:51:34.589 --> 00:51:34.599 align:start position:0%
I would also support the intentions of
 
00:51:34.599 --> 00:51:36.030 align:start position:0%
I would also support the intentions of
HB

00:51:36.030 --> 00:51:36.040 align:start position:0%
HB
 
00:51:38.829 --> 00:51:38.839 align:start position:0%
734 the income property tax relief
 
00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
program to offset that as spoken earlier
 
00:51:43.950 --> 00:51:43.960 align:start position:0%
by the executive
 
00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
Council when you increase adequacy you
 
00:51:50.270 --> 00:51:50.280 align:start position:0%
help lower the burden for the people
 
00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
that are least able to pay that property
 
00:51:57.109 --> 00:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
tax that I believe is a duty that we all
 
00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
hold as public agents I sit on a school
 
00:52:02.430 --> 00:52:02.440 align:start position:0%
board as you sit here it's very very
 
00:52:05.069 --> 00:52:05.079 align:start position:0%
difficult work I understand that but we
 
00:52:07.270 --> 00:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
are still in the strangle hold of this
 
00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:10.200 align:start position:0%
archaic property tax system so if we
 
00:52:12.190 --> 00:52:12.200 align:start position:0%
could work together to balance that out
 
00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
to try and make things better for all of
 
00:52:17.069 --> 00:52:17.079 align:start position:0%
our citizens for our students through
 
00:52:19.349 --> 00:52:19.359 align:start position:0%
adequacy funding and through mechanisms
 
00:52:22.750 --> 00:52:22.760 align:start position:0%
for elderly exemptions and the property
 
00:52:25.710 --> 00:52:25.720 align:start position:0%
tax relief programs as they exist thank
 
00:52:27.370 --> 00:52:27.380 align:start position:0%

Hampshire's education funding system is
 
00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
failing our students and and our

taxpayers that's why I along with 241

nine of New Hampshire's 13 Mayors in my

own District I recently spent eight
 
00:54:07.670 --> 00:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
hours over two days in discussions at
 
00:54:09.710 --> 00:54:09.720 align:start position:0%
the local school district meeting annual
 
00:54:12.549 --> 00:54:12.559 align:start position:0%
meeting only to see $2 million cut from
 
00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:14.720 align:start position:0%
our public schools because the state
 
00:54:17.789 --> 00:54:17.799 align:start position:0%
does not adequately fund special
 
00:54:19.829 --> 00:54:19.839 align:start position:0%
education and even though our local
 
00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:22.640 align:start position:0%
budget in my own town has increased by
 
00:54:24.309 --> 00:54:24.319 align:start position:0%
just a modest
 
00:54:27.589 --> 00:54:27.599 align:start position:0%
1.7% it remains to heavy a burden on
 
00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:30.880 align:start position:0%
property taxes especially elderly
 
00:54:32.950 --> 00:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
residents and young
 
00:54:35.630 --> 00:54:35.640 align:start position:0%
families this is the reality in
 
00:54:38.030 --> 00:54:38.040 align:start position:0%
communities across New Hampshire the
 
00:54:40.470 --> 00:54:40.480 align:start position:0%
state is pushing School costs onto local
 
00:54:43.390 --> 00:54:43.400 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and forcing districts to make
 
00:54:46.349 --> 00:54:46.359 align:start position:0%
impossible choices no Community should
 
00:54:48.190 --> 00:54:48.200 align:start position:0%
have to choose between cutting essential
 
00:54:51.030 --> 00:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
programs and increasing taxes on those
 
00:54:53.430 --> 00:54:53.440 align:start position:0%
who can least afford it the letter
 
00:54:55.069 --> 00:54:55.079 align:start position:0%
before you is a clear and urgent call
 
00:54:58.549 --> 00:54:58.559 align:start position:0%
for Action the state must step up to
 
00:55:01.829 --> 00:55:01.839 align:start position:0%
fulfill its constitutional obligation to
 
00:55:05.230 --> 00:55:05.240 align:start position:0%
fund public education fully our students
 
00:55:08.109 --> 00:55:08.119 align:start position:0%
and our communities cannot afford
 
00:55:11.430 --> 00:55:11.440 align:start position:0%
another budget that ignores this crisis

67 school districts and 88 individual
 
00:55:48.829 --> 00:55:48.839 align:start position:0%
towns as the smallest city in the state
 
00:55:50.950 --> 00:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
we possess a strong sense of community
 
00:55:53.190 --> 00:55:53.200 align:start position:0%
and pride and have made great strides
 
00:55:55.829 --> 00:55:55.839 align:start position:0%
over the years Franklin has remarkable
 
00:55:57.829 --> 00:55:57.839 align:start position:0%
students St achieving extraordinary
 
00:56:00.190 --> 00:56:00.200 align:start position:0%
things in our schools and communities
 
00:56:02.069 --> 00:56:02.079 align:start position:0%
and our city and school board work
 
00:56:03.950 --> 00:56:03.960 align:start position:0%
tirelessly with our teachers
 
00:56:06.069 --> 00:56:06.079 align:start position:0%
superintendent administrators and
 
00:56:08.150 --> 00:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
community members to provide students
 
00:56:10.950 --> 00:56:10.960 align:start position:0%
with enhanced opportunities but the fact
 
00:56:12.789 --> 00:56:12.799 align:start position:0%
of the matter is our children are being
 
00:56:14.670 --> 00:56:14.680 align:start position:0%
let down by the state which provides
 
00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:15.990 align:start position:0%
let down by the state which provides
only

00:56:15.990 --> 00:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
only
 
00:56:19.109 --> 00:56:19.119 align:start position:0%
36.4% of the city's total cost of public
 
00:56:21.630 --> 00:56:21.640 align:start position:0%
education this inadequate state aid and
 
00:56:23.870 --> 00:56:23.880 align:start position:0%
its impacts are compounded by the fact
 
00:56:25.670 --> 00:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
that we are a community both
 
00:56:27.630 --> 00:56:27.640 align:start position:0%
disproportion Ely and negatively
 
00:56:29.710 --> 00:56:29.720 align:start position:0%
affected due to our relatively low
 
00:56:32.549 --> 00:56:32.559 align:start position:0%
property values in short the city of
 
00:56:35.270 --> 00:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
Franklin its students and its taxpayers
 
00:56:36.870 --> 00:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
are harmed by New Hampshire's school
 
00:56:39.589 --> 00:56:39.599 align:start position:0%
funding model and we are not alone as
 
00:56:41.829 --> 00:56:41.839 align:start position:0%
evidenced by the over 80 communities
 
00:56:43.990 --> 00:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
represented in the local elected leaders
 
00:56:46.589 --> 00:56:46.599 align:start position:0%
school funding letter I'm here today to
 
00:56:48.549 --> 00:56:48.559 align:start position:0%
support that letter and to let you all
 
00:56:51.029 --> 00:56:51.039 align:start position:0%
know that anything less than enforcement
 
00:56:53.109 --> 00:56:53.119 align:start position:0%
of the state court prescribed definition
 
00:56:54.990 --> 00:56:55.000 align:start position:0%
of fair and adequate funding is a
 
00:56:56.829 --> 00:56:56.839 align:start position:0%
willful attempt to undermine the public
 
00:56:58.710 --> 00:56:58.720 align:start position:0%
schools especially in communities like
 
00:57:01.630 --> 00:57:01.640 align:start position:0%
Franklin until they no longer exist and
 
00:57:03.829 --> 00:57:03.839 align:start position:0%
our students deserve better than that in
 
00:57:05.789 --> 00:57:05.799 align:start position:0%
Franklin in particular we have been
 
00:57:08.190 --> 00:57:08.200 align:start position:0%
creative we have been Innovative we have
 
00:57:10.710 --> 00:57:10.720 align:start position:0%
been agile we have forged Partnerships
 
00:57:12.630 --> 00:57:12.640 align:start position:0%
and built agreements and relationships
 
00:57:14.789 --> 00:57:14.799 align:start position:0%
with other institutions and groups to
 
00:57:16.990 --> 00:57:17.000 align:start position:0%
try to get students what they need and I
 
00:57:18.910 --> 00:57:18.920 align:start position:0%
say need because as we learned with HB
 
00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
283 students need and deserve a
 
00:57:24.029 --> 00:57:24.039 align:start position:0%
well-rounded education and yet as a
 
00:57:25.630 --> 00:57:25.640 align:start position:0%
reward for our diligent work in
 
00:57:28.109 --> 00:57:28.119 align:start position:0%
optimizing efficiencies we receive less
 
00:57:29.630 --> 00:57:29.640 align:start position:0%
funding and are compelled to make
 
00:57:31.670 --> 00:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
additional cuts that adversely affect
 
00:57:34.990 --> 00:57:35.000 align:start position:0%
our students teachers schools district
 
00:57:37.390 --> 00:57:37.400 align:start position:0%
and Community we operate with reduced
 
00:57:39.670 --> 00:57:39.680 align:start position:0%
resources in Staffing and we must rely
 
00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
annually on inconsistent and variable
 
00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
grant funding to supplement the general
 
00:57:46.270 --> 00:57:46.280 align:start position:0%
fund these struggles are perpetuated and
 
00:57:48.270 --> 00:57:48.280 align:start position:0%
exacerbated by inadequate state aid
 
00:57:51.549 --> 00:57:51.559 align:start position:0%
funding change is imperative you can do
 
00:57:53.510 --> 00:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
better and you must for the sake of our
 
00:58:04.230 --> 00:58:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:14.549 --> 00:58:14.559 align:start position:0%

00:58:37.069 --> 00:58:37.079 align:start position:0%
just unacceptable it's embarrassing a

budget is a reflection of your values
 
00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:40.960 align:start position:0%

responsible for making impossible
 
00:59:11.349 --> 00:59:11.359 align:start position:0%
financial decisions because of
 
00:59:13.870 --> 00:59:13.880 align:start position:0%
inadequate State funding together these
 
00:59:16.150 --> 00:59:16.160 align:start position:0%
local leaders represent over 990,000
 
00:59:19.069 --> 00:59:19.079 align:start position:0%
students that's almost 60% of all public

school students in New Hampshire more
 
00:59:22.789 --> 00:59:22.799 align:start position:0%
than half the children in our state
 
00:59:24.549 --> 00:59:24.559 align:start position:0%
depend on the decisions being made in
 
00:59:27.630 --> 00:59:27.640 align:start position:0%
this room in my own District I've
 
00:59:30.510 --> 00:59:30.520 align:start position:0%
spent hours in school budget meetings
 
00:59:32.910 --> 00:59:32.920 align:start position:0%
only to see $2 million cut made because
 
00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:34.480 align:start position:0%
the state is failing to fund special
 
00:59:37.069 --> 00:59:37.079 align:start position:0%
education adequately even with the
 
00:59:39.870 --> 00:59:39.880 align:start position:0%
modest 1.7% budget increase the burden
 
00:59:41.910 --> 00:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
on local taxpayers especially seniors
 
00:59:44.309 --> 00:59:44.319 align:start position:0%
and young families is too great this is
 
00:59:46.069 --> 00:59:46.079 align:start position:0%
the reality in communities across the
 
00:59:48.430 --> 00:59:48.440 align:start position:0%
state I've served 18 years on public
 
00:59:50.109 --> 00:59:50.119 align:start position:0%
school boards seven years on a charter
 
00:59:51.910 --> 00:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
school board and two terms in the
 
00:59:54.190 --> 00:59:54.200 align:start position:0%
legislature I have now seen how hard
 
00:59:55.470 --> 00:59:55.480 align:start position:0%
communities fight to support their
 
00:59:57.309 --> 00:59:57.319 align:start position:0%
schools but local efforts are not enough
 
00:59:59.670 --> 00:59:59.680 align:start position:0%
when the state refuses to do its part
 
01:00:01.109 --> 01:00:01.119 align:start position:0%
what does it say about our values when
 
01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:02.640 align:start position:0%
year after year the state fails to meet
 
01:00:05.109 --> 01:00:05.119 align:start position:0%
its constitutional obligation to fund to
 
01:00:07.349 --> 01:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
fund education fairly we are tired of
 
01:00:08.829 --> 01:00:08.839 align:start position:0%
waiting it's time for New Hampshire to
 
01:00:10.390 --> 01:00:10.400 align:start position:0%
stop forcing towns to bear this burden
 
01:00:12.870 --> 01:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
alone fund our school's property
 
01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
properly follow the Constitution thank

house finance committee members my name
 
01:00:39.390 --> 01:00:39.400 align:start position:0%
is Michaela Deiter I'm speaking today on
 
01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
behalf of the do school board who are
 
01:00:43.950 --> 01:00:43.960 align:start position:0%
all signers on the school funding letter
 
01:00:45.430 --> 01:00:45.440 align:start position:0%
you are about to
 
01:00:49.630 --> 01:00:49.640 align:start position:0%
receive with over 3,400 students do has
 
01:00:52.190 --> 01:00:52.200 align:start position:0%
the 10th largest student population in
 
01:00:55.990 --> 01:00:56.000 align:start position:0%
the state we spent nearly $3,000 less
 
01:00:58.589 --> 01:00:58.599 align:start position:0%
per pupil than the state average putting
 
01:01:02.950 --> 01:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
us 17th out of 161 districts in Dover
 
01:01:05.309 --> 01:01:05.319 align:start position:0%
like in every Community our board works
 
01:01:07.549 --> 01:01:07.559 align:start position:0%
diligently to make spending decisions
 
01:01:09.789 --> 01:01:09.799 align:start position:0%
that balance the needs of our students
 
01:01:12.190 --> 01:01:12.200 align:start position:0%
with the financial realities of our
 
01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
taxpayers as you well know the task is
 
01:01:17.430 --> 01:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
not an easy one because New Hampshire
 
01:01:19.870 --> 01:01:19.880 align:start position:0%
does not pay its fair share of the cost
 
01:01:22.789 --> 01:01:22.799 align:start position:0%
of public education contributing a worst
 
01:01:24.710 --> 01:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
in the nation
 
01:01:27.829 --> 01:01:27.839 align:start position:0%
19.9% of of school expenses our local
 
01:01:30.150 --> 01:01:30.160 align:start position:0%
taxpayers are forced to compensate in
 
01:01:34.069 --> 01:01:34.079 align:start position:0%
unsustainable ways do schools spend 133%
 
01:01:35.630 --> 01:01:35.640 align:start position:0%
less than the average New Hampshire
 
01:01:38.470 --> 01:01:38.480 align:start position:0%
District we struggle annually to meet
 
01:01:40.390 --> 01:01:40.400 align:start position:0%
the needs of our students and our
 
01:01:43.390 --> 01:01:43.400 align:start position:0%
taxpayers still feel overburdened the
 
01:01:45.670 --> 01:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
governor's proposed budget corrects a
 
01:01:47.630 --> 01:01:47.640 align:start position:0%
yearlong underfunding of special
 
01:01:50.349 --> 01:01:50.359 align:start position:0%
education Aid bringing it level with the
 
01:01:52.309 --> 01:01:52.319 align:start position:0%
reimbursements currently submitted this
 
01:01:54.230 --> 01:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
year but special education Aid
 
01:01:56.789 --> 01:01:56.799 align:start position:0%
reimbursement requests continue to climb
 
01:01:59.390 --> 01:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
year over-year the do school board
 
01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
advocates for additional funding for
 
01:02:03.630 --> 01:02:03.640 align:start position:0%
special education Aid beyond what
 
01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
governor aot has
 
01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
suggested in the past 10 years the

number of do students placed out of
 
01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
District increased from 40 to 61 that's
 
01:02:17.269 --> 01:02:17.279 align:start position:0%
a 52% jump in 10 years despite the fact
 
01:02:19.029 --> 01:02:19.039 align:start position:0%
that our total student population
 
01:02:22.750 --> 01:02:22.760 align:start position:0%
decreased by 10% during the same time
 
01:02:25.470 --> 01:02:25.480 align:start position:0%
those 61 students received more than 7.4

see that on the back of what I handed to

be repetitious it seems like we've heard
 
01:03:21.910 --> 01:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
a lot about school funding more than we
 
01:03:24.309 --> 01:03:24.319 align:start position:0%
really need to know we know that it's a
 
01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
problem we don't need to hear it 50

01:04:33.069 --> 01:04:33.079 align:start position:0%
this great state of New Hampshire had a

successful Mental Health System model

community behavioral health centers is
 
01:05:05.230 --> 01:05:05.240 align:start position:0%
critical for patients to learn how to

manage their lifelong illness like our

maintain and protect our solid

all of our children proposals in hb1 and

Hampshire's children I won't speak to
 
01:06:46.190 --> 01:06:46.200 align:start position:0%
the education because there's been some
 
01:06:48.950 --> 01:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
eloquent conversations about that just
 
01:06:52.990 --> 01:06:53.000 align:start position:0%
know that I also really oppose the
 
01:06:56.069 --> 01:06:56.079 align:start position:0%
proposal to increase the voucher system
 
01:06:58.710 --> 01:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
and want the funding to go to public
 
01:07:00.789 --> 01:07:00.799 align:start position:0%
education obviously as a special
 
01:07:03.309 --> 01:07:03.319 align:start position:0%
education teacher I know the value of
 
01:07:06.349 --> 01:07:06.359 align:start position:0%
public schools healthc care people have
 
01:07:09.150 --> 01:07:09.160 align:start position:0%
also SP spoken eloquently about the need
 
01:07:12.349 --> 01:07:12.359 align:start position:0%
to not cut Medicaid that is going to
 
01:07:15.510 --> 01:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
also really impact the children of our
 
01:07:18.269 --> 01:07:18.279 align:start position:0%
state housing and Child Care New
 
01:07:20.190 --> 01:07:20.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire faces an affordable housing
 
01:07:22.430 --> 01:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
crisis and yet the proposed budget
 
01:07:24.109 --> 01:07:24.119 align:start position:0%
eliminates funding for invest New
 
01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in housing champions making it
 
01:07:28.430 --> 01:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
harder for families to find affordable
 
01:07:31.470 --> 01:07:31.480 align:start position:0%
homes they also remove support for
 
01:07:33.630 --> 01:07:33.640 align:start position:0%
childcare Workforce Development making
 
01:07:36.829 --> 01:07:36.839 align:start position:0%
quality child care even less accessible
 
01:07:40.470 --> 01:07:40.480 align:start position:0%
again impacting our children of New
 
01:07:43.510 --> 01:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and finally energy and our
 
01:07:47.150 --> 01:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
children's future the budget moves 10

million from the renewable energy fund
 
01:07:51.710 --> 01:07:51.720 align:start position:0%

energy investment and keeping New
 
01:07:56.029 --> 01:07:56.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire relying on fossil fuels the
 
01:07:59.549 --> 01:07:59.559 align:start position:0%
only New England State to still do so
 
01:08:03.789 --> 01:08:03.799 align:start position:0%
later is too late to transition to
 
01:08:07.390 --> 01:08:07.400 align:start position:0%
renewable energy sources too late for
 
01:08:09.029 --> 01:08:09.039 align:start position:0%
our children's
 
01:08:12.109 --> 01:08:12.119 align:start position:0%

harmful proposals in hb1 and
 
01:08:22.309 --> 01:08:22.319 align:start position:0%

affect our Workforce New Hampshire

jobs that result in Energy savings for

our neighbors and reduce the amount of

money that leads the state to pay for
 
01:12:30.310 --> 01:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
our out ofate fuels by raiding the RAF
 
01:12:32.430 --> 01:12:32.440 align:start position:0%
fund and essentially robbing Peter to
 
01:12:35.310 --> 01:12:35.320 align:start position:0%
pay Paul you will be taking jobs and
 
01:12:37.470 --> 01:12:37.480 align:start position:0%
business opportunities away from the New
 
01:12:40.950 --> 01:12:40.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents and work three
 
01:12:44.790 --> 01:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
minutes let me just lastly you will be
 
01:12:46.750 --> 01:12:46.760 align:start position:0%
you'll be let me just this one paragraph
 
01:12:48.189 --> 01:12:48.199 align:start position:0%
lastly you will be violating a
 
01:12:49.950 --> 01:12:49.960 align:start position:0%
legislative agreement with New Hampshire
 
01:12:52.110 --> 01:12:52.120 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and stakeholders who supported
 
01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
the fund with the understanding that it
 
01:12:56.229 --> 01:12:56.239 align:start position:0%
would be used exclusively for renewable
 
01:12:58.910 --> 01:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
energy initiatives redirecting funds
 
01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
like this only leads to an erosion of
 
01:13:03.550 --> 01:13:03.560 align:start position:0%
public confidence in government fiscal
 
01:13:06.550 --> 01:13:06.560 align:start position:0%

Providers including rate increases last
 
01:14:39.950 --> 01:14:39.960 align:start position:0%
budget cycle the rate increases have
 
01:14:41.750 --> 01:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
been beneficial to recruit and retain
 
01:14:44.229 --> 01:14:44.239 align:start position:0%
nurses in New Hampshire we've seen
 
01:14:46.030 --> 01:14:46.040 align:start position:0%
astounding recruiting and retention
 
01:14:47.870 --> 01:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
results as a result of
 
01:14:50.149 --> 01:14:50.159 align:start position:0%
this in previous New Hampshire budget
 
01:14:52.750 --> 01:14:52.760 align:start position:0%
Cycles the lack of proactive investment
 
01:14:54.709 --> 01:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
in this area created critical access
 
01:14:57.149 --> 01:14:57.159 align:start position:0%
issues issues for services and left many
 
01:14:59.070 --> 01:14:59.080 align:start position:0%
patients forced to seek more expensive
 
01:15:01.669 --> 01:15:01.679 align:start position:0%
care in nursing homes or hospitals at
 
01:15:03.910 --> 01:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
precisely the time when the capacity was
 
01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:05.110 align:start position:0%
precisely the time when the capacity was
needed

01:15:05.110 --> 01:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
needed
 
01:15:07.430 --> 01:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
elsewhere each time provider groups such
 
01:15:09.669 --> 01:15:09.679 align:start position:0%
as ourselves and parents are forced to
 
01:15:11.430 --> 01:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
get involved and raise awareness it is
 
01:15:12.709 --> 01:15:12.719 align:start position:0%
already too
 
01:15:15.270 --> 01:15:15.280 align:start position:0%
late this committee had the opportunity
 
01:15:16.229 --> 01:15:16.239 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:15:18.350 --> 01:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
responsibility to offer these children
 
01:15:20.709 --> 01:15:20.719 align:start position:0%
and their families a better way of life
 
01:15:22.310 --> 01:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
while also helping balance New
 
01:15:26.189 --> 01:15:26.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:27.669 --> 01:15:27.679 align:start position:0%
maintaining New Hampshire's Medicaid
 
01:15:29.470 --> 01:15:29.480 align:start position:0%
rates by including a cost of living
 
01:15:31.629 --> 01:15:31.639 align:start position:0%
adjustment or a cola based on current
 
01:15:34.390 --> 01:15:34.400 align:start position:0%
market values annually for private duty
 
01:15:35.870 --> 01:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
nursing would Place New Hampshire's
 
01:15:37.950 --> 01:15:37.960 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates comparably with
 
01:15:39.149 --> 01:15:39.159 align:start position:0%
other New Hampshire Healthcare
 
01:15:40.910 --> 01:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
Industries and neighboring
 
01:15:43.510 --> 01:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
states this will have a tangible effect
 
01:15:46.030 --> 01:15:46.040 align:start position:0%
on children their families and the great
 
01:15:48.110 --> 01:15:48.120 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire surrounding
 
01:15:49.669 --> 01:15:49.679 align:start position:0%
states have been investing in these
 
01:15:51.510 --> 01:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
programs by initiating rate studies
 
01:15:53.750 --> 01:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
along with colas and adjusting their
 
01:15:56.510 --> 01:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
rates based on these programs or excuse
 
01:15:58.270 --> 01:15:58.280 align:start position:0%
me and adjusting their rates based on
 
01:16:00.629 --> 01:16:00.639 align:start position:0%
recommendations from those studies we
 
01:16:03.030 --> 01:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
urge this committee to stabilize the
 
01:16:06.070 --> 01:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program by funding the general
 
01:16:07.910 --> 01:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
funds with appropriate dollars by
 
01:16:10.550 --> 01:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
including colas annually this investment
 
01:16:12.470 --> 01:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
will continue the course of private duty
 
01:16:13.990 --> 01:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
nursing care in the state and help
 
01:16:15.950 --> 01:16:15.960 align:start position:0%
protect medically fragile New Hampshire
 
01:16:18.270 --> 01:16:18.280 align:start position:0%
patients thank you for your support of
 
01:16:19.870 --> 01:16:19.880 align:start position:0%
home health care we hope that the
 
01:16:21.350 --> 01:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
committee will consider our request and
 
01:16:23.430 --> 01:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
maintain PDN reimbursement rates for
 
01:16:25.070 --> 01:16:25.080 align:start position:0%
private duty nursing so that New
 
01:16:26.629 --> 01:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire care can keep their skilled

chair Community Advocate and I'll say
 
01:16:55.669 --> 01:16:55.679 align:start position:0%
mother um I have heard what others have
 
01:16:57.830 --> 01:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
said before me in a mark of a
 
01:17:00.310 --> 01:17:00.320 align:start position:0%
civilization as famously quoted by Mar
 
01:17:03.110 --> 01:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
Margaret me is how we care for our most
 
01:17:06.910 --> 01:17:06.920 align:start position:0%
vulnerable I love our state I love our
 
01:17:09.950 --> 01:17:09.960 align:start position:0%
country but we need to do better about
 
01:17:12.310 --> 01:17:12.320 align:start position:0%
how we care for our most
 
01:17:15.110 --> 01:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
vulnerable it is fiscally necessary and
 
01:17:18.189 --> 01:17:18.199 align:start position:0%
morally obligatory our governor has
 
01:17:20.910 --> 01:17:20.920 align:start position:0%
stated honoring our unbreakable
 
01:17:23.030 --> 01:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
commitment to those in need of our help
 
01:17:25.110 --> 01:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
reinforces the essential truth and
 
01:17:27.709 --> 01:17:27.719 align:start position:0%
recognizes that true Equity requires
 
01:17:29.830 --> 01:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
targeted resources where they're needed
 
01:17:32.390 --> 01:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
most we must not continue to balance our
 
01:17:33.750 --> 01:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
budgets on the backs of our most
 
01:17:36.310 --> 01:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
vulnerable or accepted education system
 
01:17:38.629 --> 01:17:38.639 align:start position:0%
where Equity remains an aspiration
 
01:17:40.310 --> 01:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
rather than a
 
01:17:43.550 --> 01:17:43.560 align:start position:0%
reality I see that our governor has um
 
01:17:45.070 --> 01:17:45.080 align:start position:0%
has a budget that demonstrates a
 
01:17:47.550 --> 01:17:47.560 align:start position:0%
willingness to prioritize these values I
 
01:17:49.590 --> 01:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
want to build upon this Foundation
 
01:17:51.590 --> 01:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
together collaboratively and further
 
01:17:54.070 --> 01:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
increase funding for public education
 
01:17:56.870 --> 01:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
especially special education to create a
 
01:17:58.910 --> 01:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
truly Equitable system that fully meets
 
01:18:01.310 --> 01:18:01.320 align:start position:0%
the needs of all students our special
 
01:18:03.990 --> 01:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
education is a third of our budget we
 
01:18:06.750 --> 01:18:06.760 align:start position:0%
have um had to cut 16 positions this
 
01:18:09.950 --> 01:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
year and that includes the trades we are
 
01:18:13.149 --> 01:18:13.159 align:start position:0%
sinking as a small community that's full

brink of closing due to the lack of

the state does not continue to support

the child care Workforce fund which

than $16 an hour and the wages are lower
 
01:19:51.110 --> 01:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
than every other state in New England if
 
01:19:52.950 --> 01:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
we want families to prosper in New

project um with respect to the comments
 
01:20:47.510 --> 01:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
I'll try not to repeat what some of the
 
01:20:49.030 --> 01:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
folks ahead of me have
 
01:20:51.550 --> 01:20:51.560 align:start position:0%
said um state budget is an opportunity
 
01:20:54.310 --> 01:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
to fulfill and fill some of the gap
 
01:20:56.390 --> 01:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
between what the state has determined to
 
01:20:58.750 --> 01:20:58.760 align:start position:0%
be the cost of an adequate education
 
01:21:01.350 --> 01:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
about $5,000 per student and the actual
 
01:21:02.830 --> 01:21:02.840 align:start position:0%
amount we spend in our public schools
 
01:21:05.669 --> 01:21:05.679 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire upwards of $22,000
 
01:21:07.629 --> 01:21:07.639 align:start position:0%
per student this lack of funding from
 
01:21:09.510 --> 01:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
the state creates vast disparities
 
01:21:11.790 --> 01:21:11.800 align:start position:0%
between what our schools can provide and
 
01:21:13.750 --> 01:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
between what the property taxpayers have
 
01:21:16.750 --> 01:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
to foot in each Community about 70% of
 
01:21:18.310 --> 01:21:18.320 align:start position:0%
all School District Revenue comes from
 
01:21:20.910 --> 01:21:20.920 align:start position:0%
local property taxes the highest share
 
01:21:23.669 --> 01:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
in the entire country where only 20%
 
01:21:25.270 --> 01:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
comes from State source which is the
 
01:21:27.669 --> 01:21:27.679 align:start position:0%
lowest share in the entire
 
01:21:30.470 --> 01:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
country hb1 and two present significant
 
01:21:32.189 --> 01:21:32.199 align:start position:0%
opportuni to start making steps in the
 
01:21:34.030 --> 01:21:34.040 align:start position:0%
right direction to increase funding for
 
01:21:36.229 --> 01:21:36.239 align:start position:0%
our Public Schools people all over the
 
01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
state are demanding that you take this
 
01:21:40.430 --> 01:21:40.440 align:start position:0%
issue seriously and figure out how to
 
01:21:42.790 --> 01:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
increase funding for our public schools
 
01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
around the state we continue to show
 
01:21:46.910 --> 01:21:46.920 align:start position:0%
that we care deeply about our public
 
01:21:49.070 --> 01:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
schools that we work hard in our local
 
01:21:51.830 --> 01:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
communities to walk a very fine line
 
01:21:53.229 --> 01:21:53.239 align:start position:0%
between balancing the needs of our
 
01:21:55.350 --> 01:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
students and schools and those are our
 
01:21:57.910 --> 01:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
taxpayers we're doing this work and we
 
01:21:59.350 --> 01:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
really appreciate and we hope that the
 
01:22:01.390 --> 01:22:01.400 align:start position:0%
legislature will step up and meet us in
 
01:22:03.510 --> 01:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
that effort there are also multiple
 
01:22:05.629 --> 01:22:05.639 align:start position:0%
recent court rulings that have found
 
01:22:07.550 --> 01:22:07.560 align:start position:0%
that the system used to fund our Public
 
01:22:10.310 --> 01:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
Schools is unconstitutional let alone
 
01:22:11.629 --> 01:22:11.639 align:start position:0%
Decades of other rulings from the
 
01:22:13.669 --> 01:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court that back up those same
 
01:22:15.430 --> 01:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional principles were now
 
01:22:18.030 --> 01:22:18.040 align:start position:0%
operating under just two months ago more
 
01:22:19.709 --> 01:22:19.719 align:start position:0%
than 1500 people showed up at the
 
01:22:21.669 --> 01:22:21.679 align:start position:0%
deliberative session in the karge
 
01:22:23.390 --> 01:22:23.400 align:start position:0%
Regional School District and voted
 
01:22:25.229 --> 01:22:25.239 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly to reject an attempt to
 
01:22:27.189 --> 01:22:27.199 align:start position:0%
slash their budget showing again that
 
01:22:29.149 --> 01:22:29.159 align:start position:0%
when Grand sters have the opportunity to
 
01:22:30.590 --> 01:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
engage and show support for the public
 
01:22:33.189 --> 01:22:33.199 align:start position:0%
schools we overwhelmingly do one month
 
01:22:35.149 --> 01:22:35.159 align:start position:0%
ago more than 30,000 people signed in
 
01:22:37.270 --> 01:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
from every single City in town against
 
01:22:38.950 --> 01:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
an effort to slash the definition of an
 
01:22:40.950 --> 01:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
adequate education hundred showed up
 
01:22:43.070 --> 01:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
here to testify against that that
 
01:22:45.070 --> 01:22:45.080 align:start position:0%
proposal as well and just last night
 
01:22:46.990 --> 01:22:47.000 align:start position:0%
communities all over the state voted
 
01:22:49.750 --> 01:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
again and again to reject attempts to
 
01:22:51.750 --> 01:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
slash their school budgets and supported
 
01:22:53.590 --> 01:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
increasing funding in their local
 
01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:54.990 align:start position:0%
increasing funding in their local
schools

01:22:54.990 --> 01:22:55.000 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:22:56.550 --> 01:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
there's ample evidence that this is an
 
01:22:58.510 --> 01:22:58.520 align:start position:0%
issue that Grant Staters care deeply
 
01:23:00.669 --> 01:23:00.679 align:start position:0%
about and when given the opportunity we
 
01:23:02.149 --> 01:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
show again and again that we are willing
 
01:23:04.790 --> 01:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
to invest and and care about our Public
 
01:23:06.910 --> 01:23:06.920 align:start position:0%
Schools this is not a new issue there's
 
01:23:09.629 --> 01:23:09.639 align:start position:0%
not a lack of data and I think what I
 
01:23:11.830 --> 01:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
want to close with is that every child
 
01:23:13.270 --> 01:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire should have access to
 
01:23:15.070 --> 01:23:15.080 align:start position:0%
an excellent fairly funded public
 
01:23:18.030 --> 01:23:18.040 align:start position:0%
education system regardless of zip code
 
01:23:20.750 --> 01:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
but this does not mean that we need to
 
01:23:22.669 --> 01:23:22.679 align:start position:0%
pit this issue against other issues and
 
01:23:24.510 --> 01:23:24.520 align:start position:0%
there are ways to address all of these
 
01:23:26.350 --> 01:23:26.360 align:start position:0%
um in a state budget for All Gran
 
01:23:28.030 --> 01:23:28.040 align:start position:0%
Staters thank you for the opportunity I
 
01:23:29.410 --> 01:23:29.420 align:start position:0%

01:23:29.420 --> 01:23:35.830 align:start position:0%

late zo Hill followed by Mike
 
01:23:43.110 --> 01:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
shagu good afternoon Representatives my
 
01:23:45.110 --> 01:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
name is Zoe Hill I'm a resident of
 
01:23:47.830 --> 01:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
Lebanon I'm here today to testify an
 
01:23:50.950 --> 01:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
opposition to proposed Medicaid premiums
 
01:23:53.550 --> 01:23:53.560 align:start position:0%
growing up Medicaid was how I was able
 
01:23:55.310 --> 01:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
to get needed medical treatment
 
01:23:57.750 --> 01:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
including dental care if my parents had
 
01:23:59.830 --> 01:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
to pay even1 or
 
01:24:02.350 --> 01:24:02.360 align:start position:0%
$200 I would not have been able to get
 
01:24:04.590 --> 01:24:04.600 align:start position:0%
the care I needed there are many
 
01:24:07.590 --> 01:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
children now who like I did are able to
 
01:24:09.590 --> 01:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
receive needed care because it is free
 
01:24:12.750 --> 01:24:12.760 align:start position:0%
to them due to Medicaid forcing families
 
01:24:14.750 --> 01:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
to pay for care previously covered by
 
01:24:17.189 --> 01:24:17.199 align:start position:0%
Medicaid will harm children in the state
 
01:24:27.870 --> 01:24:27.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:29.750 --> 01:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you hi my name is Mike shagu and I
 
01:24:31.110 --> 01:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
have three perspectives I'd like to
 
01:24:32.950 --> 01:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
share in support of the governor's bill
 
01:24:35.390 --> 01:24:35.400 align:start position:0%
for funding for folks with disabilities
 
01:24:37.750 --> 01:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
the first is as a parent I have a son
 
01:24:39.950 --> 01:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
who has autism and he was diagnosed
 
01:24:41.470 --> 01:24:41.480 align:start position:0%
early on with Early Intervention when he
 
01:24:43.830 --> 01:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
was two years old and now he's 25 and
 
01:24:45.950 --> 01:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
he's working a job and with supported
 
01:24:47.830 --> 01:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
employment and supported help from job
 
01:24:50.669 --> 01:24:50.679 align:start position:0%

01:31:37.990 --> 01:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
budget for fiscal years 26 2026 and 2027
 
01:31:39.510 --> 01:31:39.520 align:start position:0%
and to fund the Bureau of Developmental
 
01:31:42.550 --> 01:31:42.560 align:start position:0%
Services priority needs list I would
 
01:31:44.109 --> 01:31:44.119 align:start position:0%
also like support for specifically
 
01:31:47.070 --> 01:31:47.080 align:start position:0%
funding Family Support Services Charles
 
01:31:48.750 --> 01:31:48.760 align:start position:0%
would be negatively affected without
 
01:31:51.590 --> 01:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
funding these Services because of the
 
01:31:53.470 --> 01:31:53.480 align:start position:0%
services Charles has been able to attend
 
01:31:56.229 --> 01:31:56.239 align:start position:0%
events with best buddies at Sports and
 
01:31:58.709 --> 01:31:58.719 align:start position:0%
healthy exercise events including
 
01:32:01.470 --> 01:32:01.480 align:start position:0%
bowling Zumba walks dances and other
 
01:32:04.070 --> 01:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
social Gatherings he's been able to have
 
01:32:04.080 --> 01:32:06.510 align:start position:0%
social Gatherings he's been able to have
pure

01:32:06.510 --> 01:32:06.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:08.510 --> 01:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
companionship he has only been able to
 
01:32:10.669 --> 01:32:10.679 align:start position:0%
work part-time and has for over three
 
01:32:12.790 --> 01:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
and a half year over three years with
 
01:32:15.270 --> 01:32:15.280 align:start position:0%
the Market Basket but I have not been
 
01:32:17.270 --> 01:32:17.280 align:start position:0%
able to work at all because we live in
 
01:32:19.950 --> 01:32:19.960 align:start position:0%
subsidized housing in Plymouth and we
 
01:32:22.470 --> 01:32:22.480 align:start position:0%
have for unfortunately for many years
 
01:32:25.149 --> 01:32:25.159 align:start position:0%
the laws on this subsid housing dictate
 
01:32:29.629 --> 01:32:29.639 align:start position:0%
an income cap and an asset cap once you
 
01:32:32.350 --> 01:32:32.360 align:start position:0%
go over either cap you forfeit your
 
01:32:34.510 --> 01:32:34.520 align:start position:0%
apartment which means
 
01:32:36.950 --> 01:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
homelessness as housing costs have risen
 
01:32:39.070 --> 01:32:39.080 align:start position:0%
astronomically in the past few years
 
01:32:41.950 --> 01:32:41.960 align:start position:0%
with no availability and no reasonable
 
01:32:45.229 --> 01:32:45.239 align:start position:0%
event re rent even it's if it's found it
 
01:32:46.990 --> 01:32:47.000 align:start position:0%
leaves Charles and me staying in that
 
01:32:49.229 --> 01:32:49.239 align:start position:0%
housing this is costly as these
 
01:32:51.430 --> 01:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
community events and social Gatherings
 
01:32:54.189 --> 01:32:54.199 align:start position:0%
are often a distance away involving wear
 
01:32:57.070 --> 01:32:57.080 align:start position:0%
and tear on the car and Charles although

inclusive quality care I'm here today to
 
01:34:31.070 --> 01:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
oppose hb1 because they didn't approve

the 15 million Workforce grant for Early
 
01:34:37.870 --> 01:34:37.880 align:start position:0%
Childhood as they had previously
 
01:34:40.350 --> 01:34:40.360 align:start position:0%
budgeted my Center received grant money
 
01:34:42.390 --> 01:34:42.400 align:start position:0%
prior that we've been able to use to
 
01:34:45.149 --> 01:34:45.159 align:start position:0%
support teacher retention by creating
 
01:34:48.830 --> 01:34:48.840 align:start position:0%
well-deserved paid days off for our
 
01:34:51.189 --> 01:34:51.199 align:start position:0%
employees provide telea health benefits
 
01:34:53.790 --> 01:34:53.800 align:start position:0%
to keep them healthy and in the class
 
01:34:56.070 --> 01:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
rooms pay for professional development
 
01:34:59.430 --> 01:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
CPR certifications for all staff and
 
01:35:02.270 --> 01:35:02.280 align:start position:0%
more importantly provide pay increases
 
01:35:04.270 --> 01:35:04.280 align:start position:0%
although we'll never be truly paid what
 
01:35:07.430 --> 01:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
they really deserve but the grant monies
 
01:35:10.270 --> 01:35:10.280 align:start position:0%
have gone to grow our staff and myself
 
01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:11.109 align:start position:0%
have gone to grow our staff and myself
as

01:35:11.109 --> 01:35:11.119 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:35:13.709 --> 01:35:13.719 align:start position:0%

01:35:16.070 --> 01:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
the budget to write back in for the
 
01:35:18.189 --> 01:35:18.199 align:start position:0%
grant to support daycare and childcare
 
01:35:20.830 --> 01:35:20.840 align:start position:0%
centers across all of New Hampshire to
 
01:35:22.629 --> 01:35:22.639 align:start position:0%
be able to pour into our teachers to
 
01:35:24.510 --> 01:35:24.520 align:start position:0%
reduce burnout
 
01:35:26.870 --> 01:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
causing teacher turnover and provide
 
01:35:28.950 --> 01:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
provision to fuel our teachers to get
 
01:35:31.870 --> 01:35:31.880 align:start position:0%
their needs met to create a more stable
 
01:35:34.149 --> 01:35:34.159 align:start position:0%
early childhood education environment
 
01:35:36.709 --> 01:35:36.719 align:start position:0%

licensed for 185 children I am also a

mom of two um ages four and two and I
 
01:36:16.910 --> 01:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
also am a parent that pays for child
 
01:36:20.229 --> 01:36:20.239 align:start position:0%
care the weekly tuition for my family
 
01:36:24.709 --> 01:36:24.719 align:start position:0%
would be $700 a week that is 3,1 $150 a
 
01:36:28.990 --> 01:36:29.000 align:start position:0%
month that is $36,500 a year why are
 
01:36:30.510 --> 01:36:30.520 align:start position:0%
these grants important that's what I'm
 
01:36:32.709 --> 01:36:32.719 align:start position:0%
here to talk about that $5 million
 
01:36:36.070 --> 01:36:36.080 align:start position:0%
Workforce Grant the way Child Care is
 
01:36:38.070 --> 01:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
set up in this country it's imperfect
 
01:36:40.590 --> 01:36:40.600 align:start position:0%
the entire burden RS on the families
 
01:36:42.950 --> 01:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
that need that need it but everybody
 
01:36:44.750 --> 01:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
everybody in this room absolutely
 
01:36:47.750 --> 01:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
everybody benefits from Child Care
 
01:36:49.790 --> 01:36:49.800 align:start position:0%
without it we wouldn't have a Workforce
 
01:36:51.590 --> 01:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
as it stands New Hampshire has one of
 
01:36:54.189 --> 01:36:54.199 align:start position:0%
the highest living costs in the nation
 
01:36:57.430 --> 01:36:57.440 align:start position:0%
most families can't afford housing can't
 
01:36:59.790 --> 01:36:59.800 align:start position:0%
afford pretty much to live here
 
01:37:01.669 --> 01:37:01.679 align:start position:0%
definitely cannot afford to have a
 
01:37:04.750 --> 01:37:04.760 align:start position:0%
stay-at-home parent without this grant
 
01:37:06.550 --> 01:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
Child Care becomes more and more
 
01:37:08.149 --> 01:37:08.159 align:start position:0%
inaccessible to families that
 
01:37:11.709 --> 01:37:11.719 align:start position:0%
desperately need it we are and we are
 
01:37:13.990 --> 01:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
unable without this grant we're unable
 
01:37:17.149 --> 01:37:17.159 align:start position:0%
to retain and recruit staff we sent out
 
01:37:21.270 --> 01:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
a um a letter to our parents last week
 
01:37:23.669 --> 01:37:23.679 align:start position:0%
that said in 2024 East Side Learning
 
01:37:25.629 --> 01:37:25.639 align:start position:0%
Center received various one-time
 
01:37:27.950 --> 01:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
governmental grants these were
 
01:37:29.590 --> 01:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
specifically targeted to address the
 
01:37:31.310 --> 01:37:31.320 align:start position:0%
various challenges childcare providers
 
01:37:34.870 --> 01:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
are facing with staff vacancy staff
 
01:37:36.910 --> 01:37:36.920 align:start position:0%
retention and increased cost across the
 
01:37:38.830 --> 01:37:38.840 align:start position:0%
board we recognize that the cost of
 
01:37:40.830 --> 01:37:40.840 align:start position:0%
child care is a tremendous burden to
 
01:37:42.550 --> 01:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
families and these Grant funds
 
01:37:45.189 --> 01:37:45.199 align:start position:0%
essentially subsidized our personal cost
 
01:37:47.950 --> 01:37:47.960 align:start position:0%
and enabled us not to charge families
 
01:37:50.270 --> 01:37:50.280 align:start position:0%
the full cost of operating the center
 
01:37:52.270 --> 01:37:52.280 align:start position:0%
with the Ever Changing political climate
 
01:37:54.550 --> 01:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
we cannot rely on this grants these are
 
01:37:56.149 --> 01:37:56.159 align:start position:0%
not in the
 
01:37:59.270 --> 01:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
budget as such we are making difficult
 
01:38:00.870 --> 01:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
changes to our Center that it's
 
01:38:03.550 --> 01:38:03.560 align:start position:0%
affecting 185
 
01:38:06.310 --> 01:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
children at the end of the day to have a
 
01:38:08.830 --> 01:38:08.840 align:start position:0%
thriving economy in New Hampshire you
 
01:38:10.270 --> 01:38:10.280 align:start position:0%
have to have the infrastructure to
 
01:38:12.109 --> 01:38:12.119 align:start position:0%
support it and that starts with child
 
01:38:14.950 --> 01:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
care without child care you don't have a
 
01:38:17.229 --> 01:38:17.239 align:start position:0%
Workforce no matter what at the end of
 
01:38:20.310 --> 01:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
the day someone will be paying for this
 
01:38:21.990 --> 01:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
whether it be the families with
 
01:38:24.910 --> 01:38:24.920 align:start position:0%
increased tuition cost with un higher
 
01:38:27.550 --> 01:38:27.560 align:start position:0%
unemployment rates without a Workforce
 
01:38:29.870 --> 01:38:29.880 align:start position:0%
someone at the end of the day will be
 
01:38:33.510 --> 01:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
paying for not supporting Child Care
 
01:38:33.520 --> 01:38:42.070 align:start position:0%
paying for not supporting Child Care
thank

my name is Flo daffis I'm a senior at

Hopkin and high school and also a
 
01:39:03.589 --> 01:39:03.599 align:start position:0%
student representative to the school
 
01:39:06.189 --> 01:39:06.199 align:start position:0%
board in front of you is the
 
01:39:09.030 --> 01:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
aforementioned letter with 240
 
01:39:11.589 --> 01:39:11.599 align:start position:0%
signatures from local elected leaders
 
01:39:13.950 --> 01:39:13.960 align:start position:0%
including myself calling on the state of
 
01:39:15.950 --> 01:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to increase its funding
 
01:39:17.790 --> 01:39:17.800 align:start position:0%
for public
 
01:39:19.990 --> 01:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
education currently the way that New
 
01:39:22.470 --> 01:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire funds Public Schools means
 
01:39:24.070 --> 01:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
that local proper property values
 
01:39:25.990 --> 01:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
determine how high the property tax
 
01:39:28.510 --> 01:39:28.520 align:start position:0%
burden is on residents and also the
 
01:39:30.270 --> 01:39:30.280 align:start position:0%
quality of the education for the kids
 
01:39:34.030 --> 01:39:34.040 align:start position:0%
there last year you see it cost
 
01:39:36.950 --> 01:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
$2,545 to educate each student but the
 
01:39:39.229 --> 01:39:39.239 align:start position:0%
state contributed just $
 
01:39:43.189 --> 01:39:43.199 align:start position:0%
5,148 per student and that's not enough
 
01:39:45.470 --> 01:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
some towns were able to close that Gap
 
01:39:48.030 --> 01:39:48.040 align:start position:0%
easily some like mine had to raise
 
01:39:50.990 --> 01:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
property taxes significantly and by no
 
01:39:52.669 --> 01:39:52.679 align:start position:0%
fault of their own some towns were not
 
01:39:55.709 --> 01:39:55.719 align:start position:0%
able to close that Gap because you did
 
01:39:58.510 --> 01:39:58.520 align:start position:0%
not step up to pay for their education
 
01:40:00.709 --> 01:40:00.719 align:start position:0%
the students in these towns were the
 
01:40:03.189 --> 01:40:03.199 align:start position:0%
ones who paid for it themselves by
 
01:40:05.070 --> 01:40:05.080 align:start position:0%
losing out on opportunities and
 
01:40:07.109 --> 01:40:07.119 align:start position:0%
resources in their
 
01:40:09.990 --> 01:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
schools the vast majority
 
01:40:12.830 --> 01:40:12.840 align:start position:0%
85% of New Hampshire students attend
 
01:40:16.229 --> 01:40:16.239 align:start position:0%
public schools there are over 160,000 of
 
01:40:19.149 --> 01:40:19.159 align:start position:0%
us and we can't vote we can't choose
 
01:40:21.669 --> 01:40:21.679 align:start position:0%
where we live or where we go to school
 
01:40:23.669 --> 01:40:23.679 align:start position:0%
but we all deserve and not not just
 
01:40:25.430 --> 01:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
deserve but are constitutionally
 
01:40:28.510 --> 01:40:28.520 align:start position:0%
entitled to an adequate education we
 
01:40:29.910 --> 01:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
will be in school while you write and
 
01:40:31.790 --> 01:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
vote on this budget so it is your job to
 
01:40:33.910 --> 01:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
represent us please consider my
 
01:40:35.709 --> 01:40:35.719 align:start position:0%
testimony in this letter as you work on

the state's Public School population if
 
01:41:39.149 --> 01:41:39.159 align:start position:0%
you're wondering where ston New
 
01:41:41.510 --> 01:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is we are located in the karge
 
01:41:44.870 --> 01:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
district go cougars so you can imagine
 
01:41:47.070 --> 01:41:47.080 align:start position:0%
why it is important for me to be here
 
01:41:49.510 --> 01:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
today to represent my
 
01:41:52.629 --> 01:41:52.639 align:start position:0%
constituents our message is simple the
 
01:41:55.350 --> 01:41:55.360 align:start position:0%
state is not fulfilling its obligation
 
01:41:58.109 --> 01:41:58.119 align:start position:0%
to adequately fund public education and
 
01:42:00.149 --> 01:42:00.159 align:start position:0%
it's pushing the burden onto local
 
01:42:03.030 --> 01:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers in small towns like
 
01:42:05.109 --> 01:42:05.119 align:start position:0%
mine in Sutton this means difficult
 
01:42:06.950 --> 01:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
choices whether to cut essential
 
01:42:09.830 --> 01:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
programs delay building repairs or
 
01:42:12.350 --> 01:42:12.360 align:start position:0%
further raise property taxes on Working
 
01:42:15.350 --> 01:42:15.360 align:start position:0%
Families like mine we need a budget that
 
01:42:17.669 --> 01:42:17.679 align:start position:0%
ensures students across New Hampshire no
 
01:42:20.149 --> 01:42:20.159 align:start position:0%
matter their zip code have access to the
 
01:42:22.750 --> 01:42:22.760 align:start position:0%
education that they deserve that's why
 
01:42:24.790 --> 01:42:24.800 align:start position:0%
this that was just put in front of you
 
01:42:26.750 --> 01:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
thank you to the student that also
 
01:42:29.870 --> 01:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
shared her story as well is so
 
01:42:31.830 --> 01:42:31.840 align:start position:0%
incredibly important and it's not just a
 
01:42:34.030 --> 01:42:34.040 align:start position:0%
collection of signatures it's a call to
 
01:42:36.189 --> 01:42:36.199 align:start position:0%
action from those of us on the front
 
01:42:39.310 --> 01:42:39.320 align:start position:0%
lines of local school funding decisions
 
01:42:40.950 --> 01:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
we see the personal impacts these
 
01:42:42.750 --> 01:42:42.760 align:start position:0%
choices have on students in our schools
 
01:42:44.990 --> 01:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
and the taxpayers in our communities and
 
01:42:47.270 --> 01:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
I understand the frustration in regards
 
01:42:50.470 --> 01:42:50.480 align:start position:0%
the repetition of hearing from all of us
 
01:42:52.229 --> 01:42:52.239 align:start position:0%
about the importance of funding Public
 
01:42:53.709 --> 01:42:53.719 align:start position:0%
School Ed
 
01:42:56.790 --> 01:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
education I too share your frustration
 
01:42:59.790 --> 01:42:59.800 align:start position:0%
in the the repetitious nature that our
 
01:43:02.229 --> 01:43:02.239 align:start position:0%
state legislature has State Legislature
 
01:43:04.510 --> 01:43:04.520 align:start position:0%
has done in continuing to put forward
 
01:43:06.629 --> 01:43:06.639 align:start position:0%
bills to continue to defund public
 
01:43:08.910 --> 01:43:08.920 align:start position:0%
school education so I can empathize with
 
01:43:11.669 --> 01:43:11.679 align:start position:0%
you on that so I urge you to listen to
 
01:43:14.270 --> 01:43:14.280 align:start position:0%
the voices of local leaders to the needs
 
01:43:16.910 --> 01:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
of our students and to pass a budget
 
01:43:20.350 --> 01:43:20.360 align:start position:0%
that provides real sustainable
 
01:43:23.109 --> 01:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
investment in public education thank you
 
01:43:23.119 --> 01:43:30.950 align:start position:0%

rur hello thank you for allowing me to
 
01:43:44.350 --> 01:43:44.360 align:start position:0%
speak today I am from Meredith New
 
01:43:47.270 --> 01:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I represent myself as a
 
01:43:50.310 --> 01:43:50.320 align:start position:0%
taxpayer I'm not in the school system I
 
01:43:53.550 --> 01:43:53.560 align:start position:0%
don't have children in the school system
 
01:43:57.830 --> 01:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
but aair times call for drastic changes
 
01:44:01.510 --> 01:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
and I apologize in advance I support an
 
01:44:04.270 --> 01:44:04.280 align:start position:0%
adequately funded public school system
 
01:44:07.870 --> 01:44:07.880 align:start position:0%
and I'm opposed to the EFA I apologize I
 
01:44:10.629 --> 01:44:10.639 align:start position:0%
know you've heard it I would ask are you
 
01:44:13.790 --> 01:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
listening Have you listened to us Have
 
01:44:19.709 --> 01:44:19.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:23.109 --> 01:44:23.119 align:start position:0%
people we can't continue to make Cuts in
 
01:44:25.470 --> 01:44:25.480 align:start position:0%
our Revenue at the beginning it was
 
01:44:27.910 --> 01:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
stated that Governor aot's budget is
 
01:44:29.990 --> 01:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
$800 million
 
01:44:33.950 --> 01:44:33.960 align:start position:0%
off at that point what do you do you
 
01:44:36.950 --> 01:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
need to number one reinstate the
 
01:44:40.870 --> 01:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
interest and dividends tax and you need
 
01:44:45.350 --> 01:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
to not pass HB
 
01:44:48.229 --> 01:44:48.239 align:start position:0%
1422 which gives it's called the
 
01:44:51.470 --> 01:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
consumer Relief act but it really just
 
01:44:54.350 --> 01:44:54.360 align:start position:0%
reduces business profit tax business
 
01:44:57.709 --> 01:44:57.719 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax the Communication Service
 
01:44:59.790 --> 01:44:59.800 align:start position:0%
tax and meals and rooms tax now if you
 
01:45:02.510 --> 01:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
live here you might pay a restaurant tax
 
01:45:04.189 --> 01:45:04.199 align:start position:0%
but you're not paying meals and rooms
 
01:45:07.750 --> 01:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
right so here's the deal if you pass
 
01:45:11.030 --> 01:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
that bill by the time it's fully
 
01:45:14.470 --> 01:45:14.480 align:start position:0%
implemented it will have cost it a
 
01:45:17.470 --> 01:45:17.480 align:start position:0%
reduction in the state general and
 
01:45:20.750 --> 01:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
education trust funds of
 
01:45:25.750 --> 01:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
$374 million per year so if 800 million
 
01:45:28.589 --> 01:45:28.599 align:start position:0%
is off imagine 1.1
 
01:45:33.430 --> 01:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
billion i i as far as I feel the state
 
01:45:37.550 --> 01:45:37.560 align:start position:0%
is not doing its job to fund the the
 
01:45:39.750 --> 01:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
actions that are needed for the people
 
01:45:44.189 --> 01:45:44.199 align:start position:0%
of this state and you're kicking the can
 
01:45:47.910 --> 01:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
down the road to property taxpayers we
 
01:45:51.030 --> 01:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
cannot fund every single thing in the
 
01:45:55.390 --> 01:45:55.400 align:start position:0%
state while you lower taxes for the
 
01:45:59.470 --> 01:45:59.480 align:start position:0%
wealthiest and you pay for vouchers for
 
01:46:01.149 --> 01:46:01.159 align:start position:0%
people who already are sending their
 
01:46:04.709 --> 01:46:04.719 align:start position:0%
kids to public school so I know the
 
01:46:06.669 --> 01:46:06.679 align:start position:0%
state has a lot of problems that have to
 
01:46:10.589 --> 01:46:10.599 align:start position:0%
be tackled housing Child Care employment
 
01:46:12.510 --> 01:46:12.520 align:start position:0%
you can't bring people into this state
 
01:46:15.030 --> 01:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
if they can't afford to live here and if
 
01:46:17.510 --> 01:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
they can't find child care and if the
 
01:46:19.510 --> 01:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
schools aren't supported well enough
 
01:46:22.669 --> 01:46:22.679 align:start position:0%
they won't want to come so again I thank
 
01:46:25.669 --> 01:46:25.679 align:start position:0%
you you I've never spoken like this
 
01:46:28.229 --> 01:46:28.239 align:start position:0%
before but I thank you for the time and
 
01:46:32.430 --> 01:46:32.440 align:start position:0%

three budget priorities that support
 
01:47:18.910 --> 01:47:18.920 align:start position:0%
family caregivers and allow people to
 
01:47:21.830 --> 01:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
receive community-based care as they
 
01:47:27.149 --> 01:47:27.159 align:start position:0%
age family caregivers are the 168,000
 
01:47:30.310 --> 01:47:30.320 align:start position:0%
people in New Hampshire who assist loved

serious health conditions they provide
 
01:47:43.149 --> 01:47:43.159 align:start position:0%
2.8 billion in unpaid labor annually I

01:47:49.550 --> 01:47:49.560 align:start position:0%
support can be as my mom's caregiver I
 
01:47:52.510 --> 01:47:52.520 align:start position:0%
would visit my mom every day after work

this wouldn't be possible thank you for

01:51:21.629 --> 01:51:21.639 align:start position:0%
person you'll ever meet with that name
 
01:51:24.030 --> 01:51:24.040 align:start position:0%
by the way uh so I'm the CEO of Amin
 
01:51:25.870 --> 01:51:25.880 align:start position:0%
Community Health Center um is a
 
01:51:27.550 --> 01:51:27.560 align:start position:0%
federally qualified Health Center in
 
01:51:28.669 --> 01:51:28.679 align:start position:0%
Northern New
 
01:51:31.589 --> 01:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh 26 towns 30,000 residents
 
01:51:34.830 --> 01:51:34.840 align:start position:0%
we see one in three of the residents um
 
01:51:36.390 --> 01:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
I won't read the testimony to you have
 
01:51:38.069 --> 01:51:38.079 align:start position:0%
it in front of you I'll just hit some
 
01:51:40.750 --> 01:51:40.760 align:start position:0%
highlights so when we invest in primary
 
01:51:42.669 --> 01:51:42.679 align:start position:0%
preventive Health Care the return on
 
01:51:44.870 --> 01:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
investment is
 
01:51:47.870 --> 01:51:47.880 align:start position:0%
$13 as a fiscal conservative it's hard
 
01:51:49.470 --> 01:51:49.480 align:start position:0%
to find something especially in today's
 
01:51:50.709 --> 01:51:50.719 align:start position:0%
stock market that's going to give you
 
01:51:52.790 --> 01:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
that kind of return so to good
 
01:51:54.149 --> 01:51:54.159 align:start position:0%
investment and it's an investment in
 
01:51:55.910 --> 01:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
your friends your families your
 
01:51:57.990 --> 01:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
neighbors yourselves because I think we
 
01:51:59.430 --> 01:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
all want to be healthy for a variety of
 
01:52:01.510 --> 01:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
reasons we want to go to our son's
 
01:52:03.430 --> 01:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
baseball day our our daughter's
 
01:52:05.270 --> 01:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
graduation you know so most of why we
 
01:52:06.510 --> 01:52:06.520 align:start position:0%
want to stay healthy is because of
 
01:52:08.750 --> 01:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
relationships or you want to hike in the
 
01:52:11.350 --> 01:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
White Mountains things like that when we
 
01:52:12.350 --> 01:52:12.360 align:start position:0%
look at
 
01:52:15.950 --> 01:52:15.960 align:start position:0%
Medicaid um the return on investment
 
01:52:17.790 --> 01:52:17.800 align:start position:0%
really is a economic multiplier for
 
01:52:20.470 --> 01:52:20.480 align:start position:0%
every dollar of Medicaid there's a
 
01:52:23.589 --> 01:52:23.599 align:start position:0%
there's a three-fold economic multiplier
 
01:52:25.870 --> 01:52:25.880 align:start position:0%
so if we put that in human terms for
 
01:52:28.430 --> 01:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
amusa Community Health Services the SE
 
01:52:31.310 --> 01:52:31.320 align:start position:0%
approximately 9,000 patients um that's
 
01:52:31.320 --> 01:52:32.270 align:start position:0%
approximately 9,000 patients um that's
about

01:52:32.270 --> 01:52:32.280 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:52:36.030 --> 01:52:36.040 align:start position:0%
1300 um care visits for the granite
 
01:52:38.149 --> 01:52:38.159 align:start position:0%
state program so I I really think that's
 
01:52:41.030 --> 01:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
a significant investment in the health
 
01:52:42.109 --> 01:52:42.119 align:start position:0%
and wellness of our friends and
 
01:52:44.589 --> 01:52:44.599 align:start position:0%
neighbors and our families uh they they
 
01:52:46.350 --> 01:52:46.360 align:start position:0%
work in New Hampshire a lot of them are
 
01:52:48.870 --> 01:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
small business owners and if they're not
 
01:52:51.229 --> 01:52:51.239 align:start position:0%
healthy uh they may not have the bench
 
01:52:54.669 --> 01:52:54.679 align:start position:0%
depth to to have a waitress or to have a
 
01:52:57.830 --> 01:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
a cashier or to have a mechanic at the
 
01:53:02.310 --> 01:53:02.320 align:start position:0%
uh at the automobile shop uh so um
 
01:53:05.109 --> 01:53:05.119 align:start position:0%
lastly I'll point you to the second page
 
01:53:06.510 --> 01:53:06.520 align:start position:0%
because I had a chance to speak with
 
01:53:08.589 --> 01:53:08.599 align:start position:0%
some patients about you know what does
 
01:53:10.430 --> 01:53:10.440 align:start position:0%
health insurance matter for you in this
 
01:53:11.910 --> 01:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
instance Medicaid but it could be
 
01:53:13.589 --> 01:53:13.599 align:start position:0%
Medicare it could be something off of
 
01:53:15.589 --> 01:53:15.599 align:start position:0%
the marketplace and what does it mean to
 
01:53:17.790 --> 01:53:17.800 align:start position:0%
be well and healthy so there's just a
 
01:53:20.270 --> 01:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
sampling of those for you and just one
 
01:53:22.870 --> 01:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
last thing I am the product of public
 
01:53:25.149 --> 01:53:25.159 align:start position:0%
education from an Appalachian Economic
 
01:53:27.830 --> 01:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
Development Zone um so I hope that
 
01:53:29.790 --> 01:53:29.800 align:start position:0%
you're pleased with a return on that
 
01:53:32.069 --> 01:53:32.079 align:start position:0%
investment of people who were older than
 
01:53:34.470 --> 01:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
I was who saw the value in investing in
 
01:53:36.790 --> 01:53:36.800 align:start position:0%
my education I hope that working in a
 
01:53:38.470 --> 01:53:38.480 align:start position:0%
community health center I'm giving back
 
01:53:40.350 --> 01:53:40.360 align:start position:0%
to the community so I would encourage
 
01:53:42.430 --> 01:53:42.440 align:start position:0%
you to invest in uh the health and
 
01:53:44.550 --> 01:53:44.560 align:start position:0%
wellness of the children because uh they
 
01:53:46.709 --> 01:53:46.719 align:start position:0%
will be making my end of life decision
 
01:53:49.510 --> 01:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
and I prefer them to be really smart so
 
01:54:00.069 --> 01:54:00.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:13.350 --> 01:54:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:15.990 --> 01:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
Pike good
 
01:54:18.750 --> 01:54:18.760 align:start position:0%
afternoon I don't apologize for
 
01:54:21.589 --> 01:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
repeating some of what other people have
 
01:54:25.669 --> 01:54:25.679 align:start position:0%
said it's just too important my name is
 
01:54:28.870 --> 01:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
Deb Nelson and I serve on the Hanover
 
01:54:32.350 --> 01:54:32.360 align:start position:0%
and Dresden school boards I am also by
 
01:54:35.470 --> 01:54:35.480 align:start position:0%
the way a retired public school teacher
 
01:54:39.030 --> 01:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
I regret that my public colleagues did
 
01:54:41.390 --> 01:54:41.400 align:start position:0%
not include teachers in their concerns
 
01:54:42.910 --> 01:54:42.920 align:start position:0%
about retirement
 
01:54:46.350 --> 01:54:46.360 align:start position:0%
benefits but I am here today to
 
01:54:48.709 --> 01:54:48.719 align:start position:0%
underscore the urgency of New
 
01:54:51.709 --> 01:54:51.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's school funding crisis and to
 
01:54:51.719 --> 01:54:52.830 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's school funding crisis and to
emphasize

01:54:52.830 --> 01:54:52.840 align:start position:0%
emphasize
 
01:54:56.709 --> 01:54:56.719 align:start position:0%
the concerns of my colleagues who have
 
01:54:59.470 --> 01:54:59.480 align:start position:0%
signed the letter that you received
 
01:55:03.189 --> 01:55:03.199 align:start position:0%
already as you know leaders from 88
 
01:55:07.229 --> 01:55:07.239 align:start position:0%
municipalities and 67 school districts
 
01:55:11.589 --> 01:55:11.599 align:start position:0%
signed that letter its signers include
 
01:55:13.910 --> 01:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
as you know members of school boards
 
01:55:18.629 --> 01:55:18.639 align:start position:0%
select boards town councils and budget
 
01:55:22.990 --> 01:55:23.000 align:start position:0%
committees we see the consequences
 
01:55:27.109 --> 01:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
of our current funding system which is
 
01:55:29.350 --> 01:55:29.360 align:start position:0%
failing our
 
01:55:31.470 --> 01:55:31.480 align:start position:0%
taxpayers every
 
01:55:36.350 --> 01:55:36.360 align:start position:0%
day in Hanover we are very fortunate as
 
01:55:39.229 --> 01:55:39.239 align:start position:0%
I think probably a lot of you know to
 
01:55:43.790 --> 01:55:43.800 align:start position:0%
have a very strong local tax
 
01:55:46.669 --> 01:55:46.679 align:start position:0%
base and this
 
01:55:49.149 --> 01:55:49.159 align:start position:0%
unfortunately many communities across
 
01:55:52.390 --> 01:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
the state are not in a similar position
 
01:55:54.270 --> 01:55:54.280 align:start position:0%
and you've heard many of them speak to
 
01:55:57.510 --> 01:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
you today and this
 
01:55:59.750 --> 01:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
imbalance this
 
01:56:03.790 --> 01:56:03.800 align:start position:0%
misbalance this inequity matters to me
 
01:56:07.030 --> 01:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
and my colleagues it is a sorry
 
01:56:10.709 --> 01:56:10.719 align:start position:0%
statement about public education in New
 
01:56:13.629 --> 01:56:13.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that many other districts do
 
01:56:16.830 --> 01:56:16.840 align:start position:0%
not have the resources we
 
01:56:20.589 --> 01:56:20.599 align:start position:0%
do towns with lower property values are
 
01:56:22.990 --> 01:56:23.000 align:start position:0%
struggling to provide even the most
 
01:56:25.270 --> 01:56:25.280 align:start position:0%
basic educational opportunities for
 
01:56:28.910 --> 01:56:28.920 align:start position:0%
their students the current system forces
 
01:56:32.189 --> 01:56:32.199 align:start position:0%
communities into a lose lose choice
 
01:56:34.669 --> 01:56:34.679 align:start position:0%
either raise property taxes to make up
 
01:56:37.910 --> 01:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
for inadequate state aid or cut critical
 
01:56:40.109 --> 01:56:40.119 align:start position:0%
programs but our students
 
01:56:45.229 --> 01:56:45.239 align:start position:0%
need we need our students deserve our
 
01:56:51.069 --> 01:56:51.079 align:start position:0%
families want our communities ask for a
 
01:56:53.830 --> 01:56:53.840 align:start position:0%
budget that meets the state's

Medicaid funded Insurance thanks to the

expansion and mental health care so now
 
01:59:34.109 --> 01:59:34.119 align:start position:0%
they have re-entered the stream of life
 
01:59:35.950 --> 01:59:35.960 align:start position:0%
and picked up on building their dreams
 
01:59:39.350 --> 01:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
as young adults should Medicaid funded
 
01:59:41.310 --> 01:59:41.320 align:start position:0%
insurance gave them access to mental
 
01:59:44.669 --> 01:59:44.679 align:start position:0%
health care it was Health Care access
 
01:59:47.030 --> 01:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
that put this young person in position
 
01:59:49.390 --> 01:59:49.400 align:start position:0%
to re-enter their world world and get
 
01:59:51.750 --> 01:59:51.760 align:start position:0%

01:59:51.760 --> 01:59:53.229 align:start position:0%
back working again not the other way
around

01:59:53.229 --> 01:59:53.239 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:59:55.830 --> 01:59:55.840 align:start position:0%
around the second story is another loved
 
01:59:58.069 --> 01:59:58.079 align:start position:0%
one living with complex medical issues
 
01:59:59.669 --> 01:59:59.679 align:start position:0%
including an intractable and
 
02:00:01.350 --> 02:00:01.360 align:start position:0%
lifethreatening mental illness who
 
02:00:03.550 --> 02:00:03.560 align:start position:0%
relies on Medicaid for services and
 
02:00:05.870 --> 02:00:05.880 align:start position:0%
supports for aspects of daily living and
 
02:00:08.629 --> 02:00:08.639 align:start position:0%
health care this person lives in a rural
 
02:00:11.910 --> 02:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
area with very few options or resources
 
02:00:14.229 --> 02:00:14.239 align:start position:0%
to basic access for things we all hold
 
02:00:17.030 --> 02:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
dear like most people in their position
 
02:00:19.950 --> 02:00:19.960 align:start position:0%
they are a pedestrian and they rely on
 
02:00:22.149 --> 02:00:22.159 align:start position:0%
the CTS through Medicaid for their
 
02:00:24.669 --> 02:00:24.679 align:start position:0%
transportation to their medical
 
02:00:27.310 --> 02:00:27.320 align:start position:0%
appointments this person also relies on
 
02:00:29.669 --> 02:00:29.679 align:start position:0%
a Community Mental Health Center a case
 
02:00:31.950 --> 02:00:31.960 align:start position:0%
manager to interface for all their use
 
02:00:34.550 --> 02:00:34.560 align:start position:0%
of Center services but as one case
 
02:00:37.709 --> 02:00:37.719 align:start position:0%
manager noted with about 65 clients a
 
02:00:40.069 --> 02:00:40.079 align:start position:0%
piece these clients who need more than
 
02:00:42.229 --> 02:00:42.239 align:start position:0%
basic Services there is no way
 
02:00:44.950 --> 02:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
realistically to make that happen
 
02:00:47.910 --> 02:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
sustainably so I'm speaking here of the
 
02:00:50.870 --> 02:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health carees wanting
 
02:00:52.589 --> 02:00:52.599 align:start position:0%
to provide much
 
02:00:55.470 --> 02:00:55.480 align:start position:0%
needed services but they cannot because
 
02:00:58.510 --> 02:00:58.520 align:start position:0%
of the uncompensated categories for
 
02:01:01.229 --> 02:01:01.239 align:start position:0%
services so that's one of my emphasis is
 
02:01:03.750 --> 02:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
that I ask you to address those and when
 
02:01:05.790 --> 02:01:05.800 align:start position:0%
you read my testimony you look in the
 
02:01:07.350 --> 02:01:07.360 align:start position:0%
middle of it there's a little Easter egg
 
02:01:09.310 --> 02:01:09.320 align:start position:0%
in there about what will surprise you
 
02:01:10.790 --> 02:01:10.800 align:start position:0%
about what's not
 
02:01:14.149 --> 02:01:14.159 align:start position:0%
compensated no one none of us are immune
 
02:01:16.310 --> 02:01:16.320 align:start position:0%
from illness or Misfortune that can lay
 
02:01:18.390 --> 02:01:18.400 align:start position:0%
us low or cause us to lose all we
 
02:01:20.589 --> 02:01:20.599 align:start position:0%
thought we had control over three
 
02:01:22.510 --> 02:01:22.520 align:start position:0%
minutes never know
 
02:01:24.870 --> 02:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
health is the first wealth please do
 
02:01:26.589 --> 02:01:26.599 align:start position:0%
what you can to help it in the budget
 
02:01:26.599 --> 02:01:27.320 align:start position:0%
what you can to help it in the budget

good afternoon chairman Wier members of

Susan Sterns and I'm a resident of

sbert in the interest of full disclosure
 
02:02:04.790 --> 02:02:04.800 align:start position:0%
I am employed as executive director of
 
02:02:08.229 --> 02:02:08.239 align:start position:0%
Nami New Hampshire however I am not here
 
02:02:11.310 --> 02:02:11.320 align:start position:0%
today in that role rather I am here as a
 
02:02:13.750 --> 02:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
family member of a loved one living with
 
02:02:15.189 --> 02:02:15.199 align:start position:0%
a mental
 
02:02:18.550 --> 02:02:18.560 align:start position:0%
illness my family member is 53 years old
 
02:02:20.510 --> 02:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
and has been living with this severe and
 
02:02:23.790 --> 02:02:23.800 align:start position:0%
persistent illness since his late teens
 
02:02:26.430 --> 02:02:26.440 align:start position:0%
he receives Social Security benefits
 
02:02:28.270 --> 02:02:28.280 align:start position:0%
accesses Mental Health Care through his
 
02:02:30.589 --> 02:02:30.599 align:start position:0%
local Community Mental Health Center and
 
02:02:33.350 --> 02:02:33.360 align:start position:0%
has lived in his own small apartment for
 
02:02:35.910 --> 02:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
many years thanks to a Section 8 Housing
 
02:02:39.069 --> 02:02:39.079 align:start position:0%
Voucher due to his disability he has
 
02:02:41.950 --> 02:02:41.960 align:start position:0%
significant challenges managing money so
 
02:02:43.990 --> 02:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
his father is his legal representative
 
02:02:46.709 --> 02:02:46.719 align:start position:0%
pay making sure that his rent and
 
02:02:49.390 --> 02:02:49.400 align:start position:0%
utilities are always paid on time and
 
02:02:52.629 --> 02:02:52.639 align:start position:0%
that he has food after paying all his
 
02:02:56.870 --> 02:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
bills my loved one has $4 a day in
 
02:02:59.830 --> 02:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
spending money which gives him a small
 
02:03:02.430 --> 02:03:02.440 align:start position:0%
bit of autonomy that is incredibly
 
02:03:05.750 --> 02:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
important to him and his mental
 
02:03:07.790 --> 02:03:07.800 align:start position:0%
well-being he used to be able to
 
02:03:09.870 --> 02:03:09.880 align:start position:0%
purchase a coffee and donut with his
 
02:03:13.189 --> 02:03:13.199 align:start position:0%
daily $4 but due to Rising costs he can
 
02:03:14.709 --> 02:03:14.719 align:start position:0%
no longer afford the
 
02:03:19.310 --> 02:03:19.320 align:start position:0%
dut of course he did receive a $30 month
 
02:03:21.310 --> 02:03:21.320 align:start position:0%
Cola increase from Social Security at
 
02:03:24.270 --> 02:03:24.280 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the year as a result
 
02:03:26.189 --> 02:03:26.199 align:start position:0%
his Section 8 Housing Voucher was
 
02:03:30.189 --> 02:03:30.199 align:start position:0%
reduced by $32 a month it's not even a
 
02:03:32.189 --> 02:03:32.199 align:start position:0%
zero sum game
 
02:03:34.629 --> 02:03:34.639 align:start position:0%
folks you might think my loved one's
 
02:03:36.790 --> 02:03:36.800 align:start position:0%
financial situation is exceptional
 
02:03:40.149 --> 02:03:40.159 align:start position:0%
because of his very limited means it is
 
02:03:40.159 --> 02:03:41.709 align:start position:0%
because of his very limited means it is
sadly

02:03:41.709 --> 02:03:41.719 align:start position:0%
sadly
 
02:03:43.910 --> 02:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
exceptional because he does have
 
02:03:46.709 --> 02:03:46.719 align:start position:0%
subsidized housing and thanks to his
 
02:03:49.870 --> 02:03:49.880 align:start position:0%
father's careful management he has $4 a
 
02:03:52.709 --> 02:03:52.719 align:start position:0%
day in his pocket something that allows
 
02:03:56.069 --> 02:03:56.079 align:start position:0%
him to meet his one friend and have a
 
02:03:57.189 --> 02:03:57.199 align:start position:0%
cup of
 
02:04:00.069 --> 02:04:00.079 align:start position:0%
coffee for people like my loved one
 
02:04:02.109 --> 02:04:02.119 align:start position:0%
living with a severe and persistent
 
02:04:04.629 --> 02:04:04.639 align:start position:0%
mental illness even the smallest
 
02:04:06.069 --> 02:04:06.079 align:start position:0%
increase in something like a
 
02:04:08.189 --> 02:04:08.199 align:start position:0%
prescription co-pay will have a
 
02:04:08.199 --> 02:04:09.390 align:start position:0%
prescription co-pay will have a
significant

02:04:09.390 --> 02:04:09.400 align:start position:0%
significant
 
02:04:12.189 --> 02:04:12.199 align:start position:0%
impact my loved one has family who will
 
02:04:15.390 --> 02:04:15.400 align:start position:0%
help him of course many people living
 
02:04:17.870 --> 02:04:17.880 align:start position:0%
with serious mental illness do not
 
02:04:20.470 --> 02:04:20.480 align:start position:0%
however and the outcomes for many will
 
02:04:22.669 --> 02:04:22.679 align:start position:0%
likely be not being able to fill
 
02:04:24.870 --> 02:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
prescriptions resulting in far more
 
02:04:27.709 --> 02:04:27.719 align:start position:0%
costly interventions such as
 
02:04:29.990 --> 02:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
hospitalization I know that the task

whose financial situation makes them
 
02:04:39.830 --> 02:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
especially vulnerable to even the
 
02:04:42.669 --> 02:04:42.679 align:start position:0%
smallest changes in income and I thank

Danielle Robinson and I'm here to speak
 
02:05:18.350 --> 02:05:18.360 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the families children and
 
02:05:20.990 --> 02:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
child care providers who depend on the
 
02:05:22.750 --> 02:05:22.760 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire childcare scholarship
 
02:05:24.990 --> 02:05:25.000 align:start position:0%
program at the ark Learning Center we
 
02:05:27.189 --> 02:05:27.199 align:start position:0%
have three locations in Tilton hookit
 
02:05:29.790 --> 02:05:29.800 align:start position:0%
and Londoner and we see firsthand the
 
02:05:32.790 --> 02:05:32.800 align:start position:0%
impact of this program in Tilton alone
 
02:05:36.270 --> 02:05:36.280 align:start position:0%
55% of my families rely on it to afford
 
02:05:38.709 --> 02:05:38.719 align:start position:0%
safe quality and child quality Child
 
02:05:40.910 --> 02:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
Care while they work while this program
 
02:05:43.270 --> 02:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
is essential it's not without its flaws
 
02:05:45.109 --> 02:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
managing it requires a dedicated staff
 
02:05:46.950 --> 02:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
member spending multiple hours a week
 
02:05:49.350 --> 02:05:49.360 align:start position:0%
just on billing tracking attendance
 
02:05:51.030 --> 02:05:51.040 align:start position:0%
obtaining signatures and monitoring for
 
02:05:53.950 --> 02:05:53.960 align:start position:0%
a sudden SC scholarship link sudden
 
02:05:55.270 --> 02:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
something that happens without warning
 
02:05:57.790 --> 02:05:57.800 align:start position:0%
over 90% of time the scholarship link
 
02:06:00.510 --> 02:06:00.520 align:start position:0%
will drop without warning the because
 
02:06:02.549 --> 02:06:02.559 align:start position:0%
these funds are paid retroactively when
 
02:06:05.229 --> 02:06:05.239 align:start position:0%
the link drops families suddenly face an
 
02:06:07.830 --> 02:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
average unexpected bill of
 
02:06:10.229 --> 02:06:10.239 align:start position:0%
$900 forcing them to pull their child
 
02:06:12.470 --> 02:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
from care this leads to job loss
 
02:06:14.549 --> 02:06:14.559 align:start position:0%
disrupted care and providers losing
 
02:06:17.069 --> 02:06:17.079 align:start position:0%
tuition they were counting on enrollment
 
02:06:19.270 --> 02:06:19.280 align:start position:0%
delays create further hardship it can
 
02:06:21.030 --> 02:06:21.040 align:start position:0%
take weeks for a scholarship link to
 
02:06:23.030 --> 02:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
appear meaning families must either pay
 
02:06:24.790 --> 02:06:24.800 align:start position:0%
out of pocket or delay starting their
 
02:06:27.510 --> 02:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
new job this system is not working for
 
02:06:29.990 --> 02:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
the people it was meant to help at the
 
02:06:32.109 --> 02:06:32.119 align:start position:0%
same time we must address the challenges
 
02:06:34.510 --> 02:06:34.520 align:start position:0%
facing our teachers the state expanded
 
02:06:36.229 --> 02:06:36.239 align:start position:0%
funding through the workforce assistance
 
02:06:38.870 --> 02:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
pilot program yet the process to access
 
02:06:40.709 --> 02:06:40.719 align:start position:0%
these funds is so burdensome that it's
 
02:06:43.069 --> 02:06:43.079 align:start position:0%
failing those it was meant to help at
 
02:06:44.990 --> 02:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
the ark we provide free child care to
 
02:06:48.069 --> 02:06:48.079 align:start position:0%
all of our teachers this cost us
 
02:06:49.870 --> 02:06:49.880 align:start position:0%
$270,000 in
 
02:06:52.549 --> 02:06:52.559 align:start position:0%
2024 this was a benefit that we hoped
 
02:06:54.310 --> 02:06:54.320 align:start position:0%
that this program would help us be able
 
02:06:56.870 --> 02:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
to sustain however in the 3 months that
 
02:06:59.709 --> 02:06:59.719 align:start position:0%
this pilot program has been working zero
 
02:07:02.589 --> 02:07:02.599 align:start position:0%
out of my 15 teachers have been approved
 
02:07:03.950 --> 02:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
and one of our teachers that was
 
02:07:05.669 --> 02:07:05.679 align:start position:0%
previously approved for the scholarship
 
02:07:08.270 --> 02:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
program had her link drop suddenly with
 
02:07:10.030 --> 02:07:10.040 align:start position:0%
no explanation and no change of
 
02:07:12.189 --> 02:07:12.199 align:start position:0%
financial status so I guess we can say
 
02:07:14.390 --> 02:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
negative one teachers has benefited from
 
02:07:16.669 --> 02:07:16.679 align:start position:0%
this program everyone is stuck in an
 
02:07:19.310 --> 02:07:19.320 align:start position:0%
endless cycle of paperwork resubmissions
 
02:07:21.549 --> 02:07:21.559 align:start position:0%
and rejections even when they can Pro
 
02:07:23.310 --> 02:07:23.320 align:start position:0%
prove that they submitted the required
 
02:07:26.030 --> 02:07:26.040 align:start position:0%
documents the process is so convoluted
 
02:07:27.390 --> 02:07:27.400 align:start position:0%
that teachers must apply through the
 
02:07:29.910 --> 02:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
regular scholarship program get denied
 
02:07:33.189 --> 02:07:33.199 align:start position:0%
then start over entirely once denied
 
02:07:35.430 --> 02:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
facing more paperwork more interviews
 
02:07:37.629 --> 02:07:37.639 align:start position:0%
and more barriers for our teachers run
 
02:07:38.910 --> 02:07:38.920 align:start position:0%
the regular New Hampshire childcare
 
02:07:40.750 --> 02:07:40.760 align:start position:0%
scholarship program their cost Shares
 
02:07:42.189 --> 02:07:42.199 align:start position:0%
are so high that the arc is still
 
02:07:44.030 --> 02:07:44.040 align:start position:0%
covering over 50% of their child's
 
02:07:46.750 --> 02:07:46.760 align:start position:0%
tuition if we truly value child care as
 
02:07:48.669 --> 02:07:48.679 align:start position:0%
an essential service one that keeps
 
02:07:50.430 --> 02:07:50.440 align:start position:0%
parents working and strengthens our New
 
02:07:52.430 --> 02:07:52.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire economy then we must reduce
 
02:07:54.350 --> 02:07:54.360 align:start position:0%
the barriers not create more the New
 
02:07:56.229 --> 02:07:56.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire childcare scholarship program
 
02:07:58.629 --> 02:07:58.639 align:start position:0%
must continue but with improved
 
02:08:00.350 --> 02:08:00.360 align:start position:0%
accessibility and the workforce
 
02:08:03.310 --> 02:08:03.320 align:start position:0%
assistant pilot project must continue
 
02:08:05.350 --> 02:08:05.360 align:start position:0%
but be reformed to actually work for the
 
02:08:07.669 --> 02:08:07.679 align:start position:0%
Educators it was designed to support our
 
02:08:09.790 --> 02:08:09.800 align:start position:0%
families need this our teachers need
 
02:08:11.669 --> 02:08:11.679 align:start position:0%
this let's work together to make sure it
 
02:08:24.149 --> 02:08:24.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:26.950 --> 02:08:26.960 align:start position:0%

documents they show show us what we

value the decisions made in this budget
 
02:11:56.589 --> 02:11:56.599 align:start position:0%
will shape the health stability and the

economic future of New Hampshire's
 
02:12:00.870 --> 02:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
families here's what we're asking of you
 
02:12:02.549 --> 02:12:02.559 align:start position:0%
invest in child care because parents
 
02:12:04.470 --> 02:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
can't work without it parents in New
 
02:12:06.629 --> 02:12:06.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are facing a crisis when it
 
02:12:08.870 --> 02:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
comes to child care Working Families are
 
02:12:10.709 --> 02:12:10.719 align:start position:0%
struggling to afford it and providers
 
02:12:12.109 --> 02:12:12.119 align:start position:0%
who are the workforce behind the
 
02:12:15.510 --> 02:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
workforce cannot make ends meet without
 
02:12:17.390 --> 02:12:17.400 align:start position:0%
continued investment we risk losing more
 
02:12:19.390 --> 02:12:19.400 align:start position:0%
child care providers pushing parents out
 
02:12:21.390 --> 02:12:21.400 align:start position:0%
of the workforce and stalling our econom
 
02:12:23.629 --> 02:12:23.639 align:start position:0%

Solutions that allow our families to

thrive and our economy to function
 
02:12:30.709 --> 02:12:30.719 align:start position:0%
protect Medicaid because health is not a

Medicaid Cuts in these proposed changes
 
02:12:47.950 --> 02:12:47.960 align:start position:0%
would mean fewer families accessing
 
02:12:49.910 --> 02:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
life-saving care more strain on
 
02:12:52.109 --> 02:12:52.119 align:start position:0%

across our state protecting Medicaid

isn't just the right thing to do it's a

fiscally responsible investment in
 
02:13:00.149 --> 02:13:00.159 align:start position:0%
public health I'm also asking that you
 
02:13:01.589 --> 02:13:01.599 align:start position:0%
preserve funding for Family Resource
 
02:13:03.629 --> 02:13:03.639 align:start position:0%

most challenging days cutting this
 
02:13:19.669 --> 02:13:19.679 align:start position:0%
funding would be devastating especially
 
02:13:21.790 --> 02:13:21.800 align:start position:0%
in the mid middle of a growing maternal
 
02:13:24.390 --> 02:13:24.400 align:start position:0%
Health crisis we want to keep families

babies supported and we want to keep
 
02:13:28.189 --> 02:13:28.199 align:start position:0%
strong communities we must keep these in
 
02:13:30.950 --> 02:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
Investments intact lastly keep public
 
02:13:32.669 --> 02:13:32.679 align:start position:0%
education dollars where they belong in

public schools New Hampshire's public
 
02:13:36.270 --> 02:13:36.280 align:start position:0%
schools are the hearts of our community
 
02:13:37.870 --> 02:13:37.880 align:start position:0%
every dollar diverted away from them
 
02:13:39.589 --> 02:13:39.599 align:start position:0%
weakens the system that the vast
 
02:13:41.910 --> 02:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
majority of our kids use our teachers
 
02:13:43.870 --> 02:13:43.880 align:start position:0%
students and schools need resources not
 
02:13:46.229 --> 02:13:46.239 align:start position:0%
roadblocks public tax dollars should
 
02:13:47.830 --> 02:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
stay in public schools to ensure that

across New Hampshire are watching this
 
02:13:59.549 --> 02:13:59.559 align:start position:0%
budget process closely I know because
 
02:14:01.390 --> 02:14:01.400 align:start position:0%
we're bringing it to them we're making
 
02:14:03.310 --> 02:14:03.320 align:start position:0%
it more accessible answering their
 
02:14:06.069 --> 02:14:06.079 align:start position:0%
questions their concerns hearing them
 
02:14:07.750 --> 02:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
you may find me repetitive but this is
 
02:14:09.990 --> 02:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
the people's house and in the moms that
 
02:14:12.189 --> 02:14:12.199 align:start position:0%
I'm talking to they don't feel heard
 
02:14:13.870 --> 02:14:13.880 align:start position:0%
because hearings like these happen
 
02:14:15.189 --> 02:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
during the middle of the workday with
 
02:14:17.589 --> 02:14:17.599 align:start position:0%
only 5 days notice that doesn't just
 
02:14:19.549 --> 02:14:19.559 align:start position:0%
shut families out of the process it
 
02:14:21.629 --> 02:14:21.639 align:start position:0%
shuts out the very people that these
 
02:14:24.510 --> 02:14:24.520 align:start position:0%
decisions impact the most and those
 
02:14:27.109 --> 02:14:27.119 align:start position:0%
decisions matter they determine whether
 
02:14:29.510 --> 02:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
young families can afford to stay move
 
02:14:31.830 --> 02:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
here and build a future in New Hampshire
 
02:14:33.350 --> 02:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
it's not just about those families it's
 
02:14:34.830 --> 02:14:34.840 align:start position:0%
about the future of our Workforce and
 
02:14:37.830 --> 02:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
our economy and our communities we urge
 
02:14:40.709 --> 02:14:40.719 align:start position:0%
you prioritize funding for child care
 
02:14:42.790 --> 02:14:42.800 align:start position:0%

Action Network to talk about child care

first I want to share a story um from
 
02:15:20.629 --> 02:15:20.639 align:start position:0%
Laura Lee Baker a childcare director
 
02:15:22.470 --> 02:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
from in who wasn't able to join us here
 
02:15:25.229 --> 02:15:25.239 align:start position:0%
today she shared that she first started
 
02:15:27.390 --> 02:15:27.400 align:start position:0%
in the workforce in 2003 but had to
 
02:15:29.549 --> 02:15:29.559 align:start position:0%
leave once she had kids due to the high
 
02:15:31.790 --> 02:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
cost of care for her own
 
02:15:35.430 --> 02:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
kids she said quote despite these
 
02:15:37.109 --> 02:15:37.119 align:start position:0%
challenges I remained committed to my
 
02:15:39.430 --> 02:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
career working hard to earn my degree in
 
02:15:40.950 --> 02:15:40.960 align:start position:0%
early childhood education while
 
02:15:42.629 --> 02:15:42.639 align:start position:0%
balancing the responsibilities of being
 
02:15:45.350 --> 02:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
a mother in 2012 I took the opportunity
 
02:15:47.950 --> 02:15:47.960 align:start position:0%
to further my education and by 2014 I
 
02:15:49.750 --> 02:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
graduated and began working as a lead
 
02:15:52.510 --> 02:15:52.520 align:start position:0%
educator as at a Childcare Center
 
02:15:54.229 --> 02:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
however I quickly found that despite my
 
02:15:56.270 --> 02:15:56.280 align:start position:0%
degree the pay was still insufficient to
 
02:15:58.030 --> 02:15:58.040 align:start position:0%
support my family forcing me to leave
 
02:16:00.390 --> 02:16:00.400 align:start position:0%
the field again she's bounced in and out
 
02:16:02.270 --> 02:16:02.280 align:start position:0%
of the field since then until she got a
 
02:16:04.030 --> 02:16:04.040 align:start position:0%
director role in
 
02:16:06.830 --> 02:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
2023 you've heard wages for early
 
02:16:09.390 --> 02:16:09.400 align:start position:0%
educators are low and yet child care in
 
02:16:11.109 --> 02:16:11.119 align:start position:0%
the granite state is unaffordable for
 
02:16:13.629 --> 02:16:13.639 align:start position:0%
most Working Families I want to share
 
02:16:16.189 --> 02:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
some polling information recent polling
 
02:16:18.350 --> 02:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
of granite Staters shows that nearly
 
02:16:20.189 --> 02:16:20.199 align:start position:0%
three in four voters believe the state
 
02:16:22.229 --> 02:16:22.239 align:start position:0%
should be doing more to support Working
 
02:16:24.390 --> 02:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
Families by improving access to quality
 
02:16:27.470 --> 02:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
affordable care 86% of Voters view
 
02:16:29.109 --> 02:16:29.119 align:start position:0%
funding for the child care and preschool
 
02:16:31.549 --> 02:16:31.559 align:start position:0%
system as a good investment of taxpayer
 
02:16:33.790 --> 02:16:33.800 align:start position:0%
money this is not a partisan issue it's
 
02:16:36.429 --> 02:16:36.439 align:start position:0%
a family and Workforce issue that's why
 
02:16:38.070 --> 02:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
I urge you to take three steps in this
 
02:16:40.349 --> 02:16:40.359 align:start position:0%
budget first protect Investments of the
 
02:16:42.509 --> 02:16:42.519 align:start position:0%
childcare scholarship program nearly
 
02:16:45.190 --> 02:16:45.200 align:start position:0%
nine in 10 voters support maintaining
 
02:16:47.190 --> 02:16:47.200 align:start position:0%
funding for this
 
02:16:50.270 --> 02:16:50.280 align:start position:0%
program second extend the child care for
 
02:16:53.349 --> 02:16:53.359 align:start position:0%
child care workers pilot Beyond 6 months
 
02:16:55.190 --> 02:16:55.200 align:start position:0%
this is not enough time as you've heard
 
02:16:57.629 --> 02:16:57.639 align:start position:0%
to fully assess its impact we need at
 
02:16:59.589 --> 02:16:59.599 align:start position:0%
least a year to allow workers to learn
 
02:17:01.429 --> 02:17:01.439 align:start position:0%
about the program apply and for us to
 
02:17:03.910 --> 02:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
gather meaningful data on its efficacy
 
02:17:05.589 --> 02:17:05.599 align:start position:0%
if we want to solve the Staffing crisis
 
02:17:06.990 --> 02:17:07.000 align:start position:0%
in childcare we need Sustainable
 
02:17:09.270 --> 02:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
Solutions not quick fixed programs that
 
02:17:10.549 --> 02:17:10.559 align:start position:0%
disappear before they can make a
 
02:17:13.030 --> 02:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
difference and lastly please restore the
 
02:17:16.190 --> 02:17:16.200 align:start position:0%
$15 million childcare Workforce fund
 
02:17:18.389 --> 02:17:18.399 align:start position:0%
this fund was created to support Child
 
02:17:19.950 --> 02:17:19.960 align:start position:0%
Care Professionals by providing grants
 
02:17:21.990 --> 02:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
for bonit bone bonuses benefits and
 
02:17:24.110 --> 02:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
professional development right now even
 
02:17:25.549 --> 02:17:25.559 align:start position:0%
the most experienced Child Care
 
02:17:27.270 --> 02:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
Professionals often earn less than the
 
02:17:30.150 --> 02:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
federal poverty level the average pay is
 
02:17:33.589 --> 02:17:33.599 align:start position:0%
$15 an hour less than most fast food
 
02:17:36.190 --> 02:17:36.200 align:start position:0%
jobs this low pay is a major reason why
 
02:17:37.910 --> 02:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
so many childcare programs have long
 
02:17:40.110 --> 02:17:40.120 align:start position:0%
weight lists and cannot meet demand
 
02:17:41.509 --> 02:17:41.519 align:start position:0%
investing in the childcare Workforce
 
02:17:43.190 --> 02:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
fund is a direct investment in the
 
02:17:46.309 --> 02:17:46.319 align:start position:0%
stability of our child care system 82%
 
02:17:47.950 --> 02:17:47.960 align:start position:0%
of Voters support continued State
 
02:17:49.870 --> 02:17:49.880 align:start position:0%
funding to recruit and retain childcare
 
02:17:52.629 --> 02:17:52.639 align:start position:0%
teachers and and nearly two in three
 
02:17:54.190 --> 02:17:54.200 align:start position:0%
voters so they would have a less
 
02:17:56.270 --> 02:17:56.280 align:start position:0%
favorable view of their legislature if
 
02:17:58.589 --> 02:17:58.599 align:start position:0%
they vote to cut this funding I urge you
 
02:17:59.629 --> 02:17:59.639 align:start position:0%
to make the right choice for New
 
02:18:01.549 --> 02:18:01.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire families and our economy and
 
02:18:09.270 --> 02:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:12.950 --> 02:18:12.960 align:start position:0%

followed by Deborah house wonderful good
 
02:18:21.750 --> 02:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
afternoon everybody my name is a lawitz
 
02:18:23.910 --> 02:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
I have lived in New Hampshire my entire
 
02:18:26.070 --> 02:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
life and I'm currently a junior up at
 
02:18:28.589 --> 02:18:28.599 align:start position:0%
Plymouth State University I'm studying
 
02:18:30.349 --> 02:18:30.359 align:start position:0%
political science up there and I'm here
 
02:18:32.629 --> 02:18:32.639 align:start position:0%
today to express my concerns for the
 
02:18:34.709 --> 02:18:34.719 align:start position:0%
proposed budget cuts that would include
 
02:18:36.070 --> 02:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
programs at my
 
02:18:38.270 --> 02:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
University Plymouth State University is
 
02:18:39.830 --> 02:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
currently seeking to cut its budget by
 
02:18:42.509 --> 02:18:42.519 align:start position:0%
2% and has provided a working plan to do
 
02:18:44.750 --> 02:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
this but that would fire 30 faculty
 
02:18:46.549 --> 02:18:46.559 align:start position:0%
members and greatly reduce the
 
02:18:49.190 --> 02:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
humanities Department this is a
 
02:18:51.629 --> 02:18:51.639 align:start position:0%
temporary solution to a larger problem
 
02:18:53.709 --> 02:18:53.719 align:start position:0%
that we're facing uh a solution that
 
02:18:56.270 --> 02:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
will not hold forever uh I expect that
 
02:18:57.990 --> 02:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
the solution will not hold for the next
 
02:19:00.589 --> 02:19:00.599 align:start position:0%
5 years these budget cuts will not stop
 
02:19:02.230 --> 02:19:02.240 align:start position:0%
at just the humanities when Plymouth
 
02:19:03.950 --> 02:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
state is again faced in another five
 
02:19:05.790 --> 02:19:05.800 align:start position:0%
years with budget cuts they will look to
 
02:19:07.629 --> 02:19:07.639 align:start position:0%
the most to the next group of the most
 
02:19:07.639 --> 02:19:09.070 align:start position:0%
the most to the next group of the most
vulnerable

02:19:09.070 --> 02:19:09.080 align:start position:0%
vulnerable
 
02:19:11.349 --> 02:19:11.359 align:start position:0%
Majors after that they will go to the
 
02:19:13.589 --> 02:19:13.599 align:start position:0%
next group and then the next I believe
 
02:19:15.190 --> 02:19:15.200 align:start position:0%
that Plymouth State University will be
 
02:19:17.270 --> 02:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
budgeted out of existence in the next 15
 
02:19:19.629 --> 02:19:19.639 align:start position:0%
years these budget cuts will not just
 
02:19:20.709 --> 02:19:20.719 align:start position:0%
kill Plymouth State University
 
02:19:22.030 --> 02:19:22.040 align:start position:0%
University but will strangle the many
 
02:19:23.549 --> 02:19:23.559 align:start position:0%
small businesses that rely on the
 
02:19:25.910 --> 02:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
student body to keep their doors open
 
02:19:27.429 --> 02:19:27.439 align:start position:0%
these budget cuts will destroy the
 
02:19:28.790 --> 02:19:28.800 align:start position:0%
unique community that has developed
 
02:19:30.790 --> 02:19:30.800 align:start position:0%
between the campus and the town
 
02:19:32.349 --> 02:19:32.359 align:start position:0%
dismantling the decades long
 
02:19:33.910 --> 02:19:33.920 align:start position:0%
relationships formed between local
 
02:19:36.709 --> 02:19:36.719 align:start position:0%
organizations and campus groups the
 
02:19:38.549 --> 02:19:38.559 align:start position:0%
budget cuts will destroy the majority of
 
02:19:40.830 --> 02:19:40.840 align:start position:0%
student organizations primarily ran by
 
02:19:43.790 --> 02:19:43.800 align:start position:0%
Humanities Majors these programs make
 
02:19:45.270 --> 02:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
Plymouth the Charming campus that
 
02:19:47.469 --> 02:19:47.479 align:start position:0%
invites new students to take a chance on
 
02:19:47.479 --> 02:19:48.469 align:start position:0%
invites new students to take a chance on

thank

02:20:06.030 --> 02:20:06.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:09.510 --> 02:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
you jebra house followed
 
02:20:13.030 --> 02:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:15.670 --> 02:20:15.680 align:start position:0%
brassett good afternoon chairman Wier
 
02:20:17.190 --> 02:20:17.200 align:start position:0%
members of the house finance committee
 
02:20:19.270 --> 02:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
my name is Deborah how I am president of
 
02:20:21.070 --> 02:20:21.080 align:start position:0%
the American Federation of teachers New
 
02:20:23.309 --> 02:20:23.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh and yes I am here to talk
 
02:20:24.750 --> 02:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
about education funding if you didn't
 
02:20:26.590 --> 02:20:26.600 align:start position:0%
want to hear about it then perhaps you
 
02:20:27.990 --> 02:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
can fix it in this budget and we won't
 
02:20:30.710 --> 02:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
have to repeat this in two years um I
 
02:20:32.270 --> 02:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
will try and summarize because I do have
 
02:20:35.070 --> 02:20:35.080 align:start position:0%
written testimony to hand in so we are
 
02:20:36.750 --> 02:20:36.760 align:start position:0%
here to oppose this budget as it is
 
02:20:38.070 --> 02:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
currently written and we hope that you
 
02:20:40.870 --> 02:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
will make great strides in bringing the
 
02:20:42.870 --> 02:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
state into constitutional compliance
 
02:20:44.469 --> 02:20:44.479 align:start position:0%
with its duty to all granted State
 
02:20:46.590 --> 02:20:46.600 align:start position:0%
children all granted State children have
 
02:20:48.670 --> 02:20:48.680 align:start position:0%
the constitutional right to a robust
 
02:20:51.190 --> 02:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
public education uh in in their school
 
02:20:52.670 --> 02:20:52.680 align:start position:0%
district and the state has the
 
02:20:54.790 --> 02:20:54.800 align:start position:0%
obligation to fund it right now our
 
02:20:57.270 --> 02:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
current funding model relies about 70%
 
02:21:00.110 --> 02:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
on local property taxes 20% on state
 
02:21:02.190 --> 02:21:02.200 align:start position:0%
revenue and as of at least yesterday
 
02:21:04.870 --> 02:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
about 9% on federal sources we don't
 
02:21:06.950 --> 02:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
know what's happening with that um
 
02:21:10.630 --> 02:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
because of that we have a very
 
02:21:14.870 --> 02:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
varied um experience in our public
 
02:21:16.990 --> 02:21:17.000 align:start position:0%
education from District to District to
 
02:21:19.469 --> 02:21:19.479 align:start position:0%
the point where um in some schools you
 
02:21:21.750 --> 02:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
have a wide variety of say advanced
 
02:21:23.670 --> 02:21:23.680 align:start position:0%
placement classes that students can take
 
02:21:26.429 --> 02:21:26.439 align:start position:0%
in high school and other uh districts
 
02:21:29.469 --> 02:21:29.479 align:start position:0%
they can't hire and retain Math teachers
 
02:21:31.349 --> 02:21:31.359 align:start position:0%
in the high school they have to do a
 
02:21:34.230 --> 02:21:34.240 align:start position:0%
virtual option where the teacher is not
 
02:21:37.030 --> 02:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
available in person to help students who
 
02:21:39.630 --> 02:21:39.640 align:start position:0%
are stuck on something um and and they
 
02:21:41.870 --> 02:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
have teachers who cannot differentiate
 
02:21:45.309 --> 02:21:45.319 align:start position:0%
lessons for students with special needs
 
02:21:46.830 --> 02:21:46.840 align:start position:0%
for students who come from a different
 
02:21:48.750 --> 02:21:48.760 align:start position:0%
language background but all of those
 
02:21:50.309 --> 02:21:50.319 align:start position:0%
students have the right to take math
 
02:21:53.070 --> 02:21:53.080 align:start position:0%
class class in high school that is not a
 
02:21:55.150 --> 02:21:55.160 align:start position:0%
robust public education it's not even a
 
02:21:57.230 --> 02:21:57.240 align:start position:0%
basic public education when you can't
 
02:22:00.270 --> 02:22:00.280 align:start position:0%
provide that so we want you to really
 
02:22:02.429 --> 02:22:02.439 align:start position:0%
make strides on fixing this funding
 
02:22:04.389 --> 02:22:04.399 align:start position:0%
formula even though we know revenues are
 
02:22:06.309 --> 02:22:06.319 align:start position:0%
limited that's a whole other discussion
 
02:22:07.870 --> 02:22:07.880 align:start position:0%
that I heard someone address very well
 
02:22:11.030 --> 02:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
here um the second thing we do realize
 
02:22:12.870 --> 02:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
there is more funding in there for
 
02:22:16.429 --> 02:22:16.439 align:start position:0%
special education grants but not enough
 
02:22:18.750 --> 02:22:18.760 align:start position:0%
it only meets the needs as they were two
 
02:22:23.309 --> 02:22:23.319 align:start position:0%
years ago those are needs to support
 
02:22:26.070 --> 02:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
extraordinary um needs for support that
 
02:22:28.309 --> 02:22:28.319 align:start position:0%
students have to access their public
 
02:22:31.270 --> 02:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
education but it's always a year behind
 
02:22:33.230 --> 02:22:33.240 align:start position:0%
and what the governor budgeted for is
 
02:22:35.349 --> 02:22:35.359 align:start position:0%
what was needed two years ago costs have
 
02:22:37.710 --> 02:22:37.720 align:start position:0%
gone up in the last two years districts
 
02:22:40.389 --> 02:22:40.399 align:start position:0%
need more than that right now and they
 
02:22:42.110 --> 02:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
will need more going forward so even
 
02:22:43.870 --> 02:22:43.880 align:start position:0%
though the governor put more in in her
 
02:22:46.550 --> 02:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
budget it's not enough you're going to
 
02:22:46.560 --> 02:22:47.469 align:start position:0%
budget it's not enough you're going to
keep

02:22:47.469 --> 02:22:47.479 align:start position:0%
keep
 
02:22:51.830 --> 02:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
pitting um special educ a needs against
 
02:22:54.510 --> 02:22:54.520 align:start position:0%
what's the rest of the school budget and
 
02:22:58.469 --> 02:22:58.479 align:start position:0%
cause that hollowing out of your already
 
02:23:01.710 --> 02:23:01.720 align:start position:0%
skimpy education to the detriment of all
 
02:23:05.870 --> 02:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
students the third thing expanding
 
02:23:08.230 --> 02:23:08.240 align:start position:0%
vouchers providing a robust public
 
02:23:10.710 --> 02:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
education is a constitutional right for
 
02:23:13.349 --> 02:23:13.359 align:start position:0%
every student and a constitutional Duty
 
02:23:16.590 --> 02:23:16.600 align:start position:0%
for this legislature paying for the
 
02:23:20.230 --> 02:23:20.240 align:start position:0%
private educational choices of Granite
 
02:23:22.429 --> 02:23:22.439 align:start position:0%
State families is a choice this
 
02:23:25.630 --> 02:23:25.640 align:start position:0%
legislature made paying for it is not
 
02:23:27.429 --> 02:23:27.439 align:start position:0%
something you have to do when revenues
 
02:23:30.150 --> 02:23:30.160 align:start position:0%
are limited you don't make extra
 
02:23:33.870 --> 02:23:33.880 align:start position:0%
expenses you don't pay extra you don't
 
02:23:36.950 --> 02:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
go out shopping on a shopping spr okay
 
02:23:38.710 --> 02:23:38.720 align:start position:0%
last thing University system we just
 
02:23:41.510 --> 02:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
heard about it don't cut that further
 
02:23:43.110 --> 02:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
our grand State families deserve an
 
02:23:44.550 --> 02:23:44.560 align:start position:0%
instate choice that they can afford to
 
02:23:46.030 --> 02:23:46.040 align:start position:0%
send their children to it so they will
 
02:23:52.100 --> 02:23:52.110 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:52.110 --> 02:23:54.670 align:start position:0%

you've heard already today but I did
 
02:24:44.910 --> 02:24:44.920 align:start position:0%
want to briefly just share that some of

02:25:02.110 --> 02:25:02.120 align:start position:0%
the years since covid we've pulled and
 
02:25:03.910 --> 02:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
surveyed our attendees just to kind of
 
02:25:05.870 --> 02:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
get a better sense of what they're
 
02:25:08.670 --> 02:25:08.680 align:start position:0%
experiencing without fail the number one
 
02:25:10.670 --> 02:25:10.680 align:start position:0%
issue that we have heard has been
 
02:25:13.670 --> 02:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
Staffing both retaining and recruiting
 
02:25:16.630 --> 02:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
good teachers to work in these programs
 
02:25:17.950 --> 02:25:17.960 align:start position:0%
this has been the biggest challenge
 
02:25:20.950 --> 02:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
above all and we know and you heard that
 
02:25:23.190 --> 02:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
other Industries are facing a Workforce
 
02:25:25.870 --> 02:25:25.880 align:start position:0%
crisis and we understand that but what's
 
02:25:27.590 --> 02:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
different about child care is that we
 
02:25:30.110 --> 02:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
are the workforce behind the workforce
 
02:25:31.870 --> 02:25:31.880 align:start position:0%
so we know New Hampshire businesses are
 
02:25:33.910 --> 02:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
relying on these programs so that their
 
02:25:36.590 --> 02:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
employees can show up every day to
 
02:25:39.550 --> 02:25:39.560 align:start position:0%
work today I am asking you to restore
 
02:25:42.030 --> 02:25:42.040 align:start position:0%
the $115 million for the childcare
 
02:25:44.389 --> 02:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
Workforce so these programs can keep
 
02:25:47.269 --> 02:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
their doors open so that they can rain
 
02:25:50.389 --> 02:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
and recruit good teachers and so that
 
02:25:52.469 --> 02:25:52.479 align:start position:0%
they can provide this essential service
 
02:25:54.950 --> 02:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire citizens we cannot
 
02:26:03.750 --> 02:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:08.469 --> 02:26:08.479 align:start position:0%
time John Lappy or Lai followed by
 
02:26:11.389 --> 02:26:11.399 align:start position:0%
correct me uh Lappy Lappy followed by
 
02:26:14.830 --> 02:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
Lisa Bowden right thank you uh my name
 
02:26:16.389 --> 02:26:16.399 align:start position:0%
is John Lappy I'm a professor of
 
02:26:18.429 --> 02:26:18.439 align:start position:0%
political science at Plymouth State and
 
02:26:20.469 --> 02:26:20.479 align:start position:0%
I'm here to express my concerns for what
 
02:26:22.590 --> 02:26:22.600 align:start position:0%
proposed higher education uh funding
 
02:26:25.630 --> 02:26:25.640 align:start position:0%
Cuts will do to our University
 
02:26:27.349 --> 02:26:27.359 align:start position:0%
plymouth's mission is to provide a
 
02:26:30.030 --> 02:26:30.040 align:start position:0%
quality affordable and personal college
 
02:26:32.070 --> 02:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
education I can tell you from personal
 
02:26:33.990 --> 02:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
experience many of our students come in
 
02:26:36.990 --> 02:26:37.000 align:start position:0%
rough around the edges 37% of our
 
02:26:39.230 --> 02:26:39.240 align:start position:0%
instate students are first generation
 
02:26:41.309 --> 02:26:41.319 align:start position:0%
who tend to need a bit more guidance
 
02:26:43.910 --> 02:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
some of them like I was myself as a teen
 
02:26:46.030 --> 02:26:46.040 align:start position:0%
maybe didn't do great in high school
 
02:26:47.830 --> 02:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
having the talent but maybe they weren't
 
02:26:49.870 --> 02:26:49.880 align:start position:0%
mature enough yet or they just weren't
 
02:26:52.750 --> 02:26:52.760 align:start position:0%
challenged or inspired and we provide
 
02:26:54.550 --> 02:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
the kind of environment those students
 
02:26:57.309 --> 02:26:57.319 align:start position:0%
need some institutions have large class
 
02:27:00.030 --> 02:27:00.040 align:start position:0%
sizes Professor lectures to them they
 
02:27:01.550 --> 02:27:01.560 align:start position:0%
don't know the students and for some
 
02:27:03.830 --> 02:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
students that works fine but it doesn't
 
02:27:06.590 --> 02:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
work for ours we know who our students
 
02:27:08.990 --> 02:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
are the faculty student ratio at
 
02:27:12.150 --> 02:27:12.160 align:start position:0%
Plymouth is 1 to 17 so one fat Professor
 
02:27:14.670 --> 02:27:14.680 align:start position:0%
for every 17 students when they struggle
 
02:27:16.389 --> 02:27:16.399 align:start position:0%
or they do well or need a little
 
02:27:18.990 --> 02:27:19.000 align:start position:0%
encouragement we see them in our major
 
02:27:20.990 --> 02:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
classes we're usually see those students
 
02:27:23.790 --> 02:27:23.800 align:start position:0%
twice a week every week every semester
 
02:27:25.990 --> 02:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
until they graduate and that's what many
 
02:27:29.110 --> 02:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
of our students need the Personal Touch
 
02:27:31.429 --> 02:27:31.439 align:start position:0%
they were always capable but they needed
 
02:27:32.269 --> 02:27:32.279 align:start position:0%
to be
 
02:27:34.590 --> 02:27:34.600 align:start position:0%
seen an article in the New Hampshire
 
02:27:36.870 --> 02:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
Business Review among other show sources
 
02:27:39.030 --> 02:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
shows our state is last in State
 
02:27:41.429 --> 02:27:41.439 align:start position:0%
financial support for higher education
 
02:27:43.630 --> 02:27:43.640 align:start position:0%
but we are also as reported in Forbes
 
02:27:45.790 --> 02:27:45.800 align:start position:0%
and the College Board the second highest
 
02:27:48.269 --> 02:27:48.279 align:start position:0%
instate tuition rate in the country and
 
02:27:50.510 --> 02:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
those rates are set to go up even as our
 
02:27:52.750 --> 02:27:52.760 align:start position:0%
budget is set to be cut even as there
 
02:27:55.070 --> 02:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
are proposals to eliminate up to 30
 
02:27:57.950 --> 02:27:57.960 align:start position:0%
faculty positions that 16% of our
 
02:28:00.190 --> 02:28:00.200 align:start position:0%
faculty and the permanently shutter
 
02:28:02.150 --> 02:28:02.160 align:start position:0%
eight programs we are going to be
 
02:28:04.429 --> 02:28:04.439 align:start position:0%
offering our young people a lower
 
02:28:07.469 --> 02:28:07.479 align:start position:0%
quality education with fewer choices
 
02:28:10.950 --> 02:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
less knowledge less skills at higher
 
02:28:14.870 --> 02:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
cost as of 2022 58% of New Hampshire
 
02:28:16.750 --> 02:28:16.760 align:start position:0%
High School grads who went to college
 
02:28:18.590 --> 02:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
went out of state and that is the
 
02:28:20.630 --> 02:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
highest rate in the country
 
02:28:22.590 --> 02:28:22.600 align:start position:0%
and it's easy to see why as of today
 
02:28:24.670 --> 02:28:24.680 align:start position:0%
instate students at Plymouth are charged
 
02:28:27.830 --> 02:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
15,000 a year tuition and fees as New
 
02:28:29.510 --> 02:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
England residents they could enroll in
 
02:28:31.710 --> 02:28:31.720 align:start position:0%
one of 33 programs at Southern Maine
 
02:28:34.710 --> 02:28:34.720 align:start position:0%
just as an example for 19,000 and if
 
02:28:36.990 --> 02:28:37.000 align:start position:0%
these Cuts go through other institutions
 
02:28:39.309 --> 02:28:39.319 align:start position:0%
are going to be offering more choice and
 
02:28:41.110 --> 02:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
I think as Granite Staters we need to
 
02:28:43.269 --> 02:28:43.279 align:start position:0%
ask what do we need to do to give the
 
02:28:45.070 --> 02:28:45.080 align:start position:0%
students of our state the education they
 
02:28:47.670 --> 02:28:47.680 align:start position:0%
deserve and what are we offering them to
 
02:28:50.330 --> 02:28:50.340 align:start position:0%
stay in our state thank you
 
02:28:50.340 --> 02:29:01.230 align:start position:0%
stay in our state thank you
[Applause]

02:29:01.230 --> 02:29:01.240 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
 
02:29:13.550 --> 02:29:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:17.389 --> 02:29:17.399 align:start position:0%
Leno good afternoon I am here in two
 
02:29:19.790 --> 02:29:19.800 align:start position:0%
capacities I am currently serving as the
 
02:29:21.630 --> 02:29:21.640 align:start position:0%
half time executive director of the New
 
02:29:23.830 --> 02:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Council of churches which is
 
02:29:25.950 --> 02:29:25.960 align:start position:0%
calling for a moral budget and the New
 
02:29:27.510 --> 02:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Council of churches doesn't
 
02:29:30.110 --> 02:29:30.120 align:start position:0%
see the budget as proposed as a moral
 
02:29:31.790 --> 02:29:31.800 align:start position:0%
budget and that test that written
 
02:29:34.429 --> 02:29:34.439 align:start position:0%
testimony is submitted I am also here
 
02:29:35.790 --> 02:29:35.800 align:start position:0%
today in my
 
02:29:38.830 --> 02:29:38.840 align:start position:0%
capacity um again for the record my name
 
02:29:41.070 --> 02:29:41.080 align:start position:0%
is Lisa Bodwin in my capacity as a mom
 
02:29:44.469 --> 02:29:44.479 align:start position:0%
and as a Disability Policy expert I want
 
02:29:46.110 --> 02:29:46.120 align:start position:0%
to tell you that I support the
 
02:29:50.070 --> 02:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
governor's call for a for fully funding
 
02:29:52.710 --> 02:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
the developmental Disability Services
 
02:29:55.230 --> 02:29:55.240 align:start position:0%
line items however I cannot in good
 
02:29:57.550 --> 02:29:57.560 align:start position:0%
conscience support the
 
02:30:00.790 --> 02:30:00.800 align:start position:0%
budget because a budget that calls for
 
02:30:04.590 --> 02:30:04.600 align:start position:0%
Medicaid premiums and co-pays is going
 
02:30:08.510 --> 02:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
to harm the families who at the highest
 
02:30:10.349 --> 02:30:10.359 align:start position:0%
rates in our nation fall out of the
 
02:30:12.070 --> 02:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
middle class and into poverty and those
 
02:30:14.710 --> 02:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
are disability families disability
 
02:30:16.389 --> 02:30:16.399 align:start position:0%
families across New Hampshire have to
 
02:30:20.110 --> 02:30:20.120 align:start position:0%
leave employment as Nicole just told you
 
02:30:24.429 --> 02:30:24.439 align:start position:0%
and as Barbara also told you earlier and
 
02:30:27.309 --> 02:30:27.319 align:start position:0%
families are already paying somewhere on
 
02:30:30.309 --> 02:30:30.319 align:start position:0%
the order I mean I'm sorry giving
 
02:30:34.230 --> 02:30:34.240 align:start position:0%
$339 million a year on nights and
 
02:30:36.150 --> 02:30:36.160 align:start position:0%

02:30:38.429 --> 02:30:38.439 align:start position:0%

02:30:40.510 --> 02:30:40.520 align:start position:0%
individuals with Developmental and

round-the-clock
 
02:30:46.990 --> 02:30:47.000 align:start position:0%

02:30:51.790 --> 02:30:51.800 align:start position:0%

02:30:58.070 --> 02:30:58.080 align:start position:0%

02:31:00.750 --> 02:31:00.760 align:start position:0%
to by state law in order to participate
 
02:31:02.790 --> 02:31:02.800 align:start position:0%

home communities Medicaid is not only a
 
02:31:15.030 --> 02:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
vital safety net it is one of the most
 
02:31:17.030 --> 02:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
coste effective Investments New
 
02:31:18.550 --> 02:31:18.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can

make medic Home and Community Based
 
02:31:23.309 --> 02:31:23.319 align:start position:0%
service waivers allow people with
 
02:31:25.510 --> 02:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
disabilities as you've heard to do all
 
02:31:27.150 --> 02:31:27.160 align:start position:0%
sorts of things in their communities I
 
02:31:29.269 --> 02:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
won't repeat but what I do want to tell
 
02:31:31.429 --> 02:31:31.439 align:start position:0%
you is the
 
02:31:33.830 --> 02:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
alternative is institutional or
 
02:31:35.510 --> 02:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
congregate setting care which is
 
02:31:38.030 --> 02:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
infinitely far more expensive group
 
02:31:39.269 --> 02:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
homes are about
 
02:31:42.150 --> 02:31:42.160 align:start position:0%
$112,000 a year and if New Hampshire
 
02:31:45.190 --> 02:31:45.200 align:start position:0%
returns to congregate settings that's
 
02:31:49.309 --> 02:31:49.319 align:start position:0%
$225,000 a year per person Medicaid HCBS
 
02:31:51.710 --> 02:31:51.720 align:start position:0%
waiver money is a
 
02:31:54.269 --> 02:31:54.279 align:start position:0%
bargain when Services aren't funded
 
02:31:56.110 --> 02:31:56.120 align:start position:0%
adequately families are forced to step
 
02:31:58.190 --> 02:31:58.200 align:start position:0%
in as unpaid caregivers which I just
 
02:32:00.750 --> 02:32:00.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned this is an unsustainable and
 
02:32:03.349 --> 02:32:03.359 align:start position:0%
unjust burden that no responsible
 
02:32:05.550 --> 02:32:05.560 align:start position:0%
government should allow to continue it
 
02:32:07.269 --> 02:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
is in fact a form of
 
02:32:10.389 --> 02:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
exploitation let's be clear supporting
 
02:32:13.150 --> 02:32:13.160 align:start position:0%
full funding for Adult Services is not
 
02:32:13.160 --> 02:32:14.670 align:start position:0%
full funding for Adult Services is not
about

02:32:14.670 --> 02:32:14.680 align:start position:0%

why I'm why I'm up here to uh to speak
 
02:33:23.790 --> 02:33:23.800 align:start position:0%
this afternoon uh and it's specifically
 
02:33:26.469 --> 02:33:26.479 align:start position:0%
on the education Freedom account program
 
02:33:29.469 --> 02:33:29.479 align:start position:0%
and the proposed expansion um of that of
 
02:33:31.389 --> 02:33:31.399 align:start position:0%
that program uh want to talk a little
 
02:33:33.950 --> 02:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
bit about the estimated costs but first
 
02:33:36.349 --> 02:33:36.359 align:start position:0%
as you're aware this is a program where
 
02:33:39.870 --> 02:33:39.880 align:start position:0%
the state gives families $5 to $9,000 a
 
02:33:42.269 --> 02:33:42.279 align:start position:0%
year as long as their child does not
 
02:33:46.190 --> 02:33:46.200 align:start position:0%
attend public schools so the thing is uh
 
02:33:49.269 --> 02:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
Mr chair the uh the takeup rate on this
 
02:33:52.990 --> 02:33:53.000 align:start position:0%
program is very low very low and um uh
 
02:33:57.190 --> 02:33:57.200 align:start position:0%
and it's about 220 250 kids out of the
 
02:34:00.349 --> 02:34:00.359 align:start position:0%
160,000 um uh students that attend New
 
02:34:03.110 --> 02:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Public Schools um I mean after
 
02:34:04.990 --> 02:34:05.000 align:start position:0%
all most of these kids want to be with
 
02:34:06.309 --> 02:34:06.319 align:start position:0%
their friends and teachers they don't
 
02:34:08.349 --> 02:34:08.359 align:start position:0%
want to uh they don't want to leave for5
 
02:34:14.429 --> 02:34:14.439 align:start position:0%
or $9,000 um um at all but um but of the
 
02:34:17.590 --> 02:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
22,000 School AG kids that are not in
 
02:34:19.830 --> 02:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
public schools that particip the
 
02:34:23.269 --> 02:34:23.279 align:start position:0%
participation rate is very high after
 
02:34:24.910 --> 02:34:24.920 align:start position:0%
all who's going to leave that type of
 
02:34:27.870 --> 02:34:27.880 align:start position:0%
cash on the table so there's currently
 
02:34:30.550 --> 02:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
about 6,000 kids in the program costing
 
02:34:33.230 --> 02:34:33.240 align:start position:0%
about $30 million a year uh with
 
02:34:36.150 --> 02:34:36.160 align:start position:0%
virtually no local tax
 
02:34:38.630 --> 02:34:38.640 align:start position:0%
savings why be because they were already
 
02:34:41.830 --> 02:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
in non-public you know private um
 
02:34:47.349 --> 02:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
schools so um the remaining kids uh with
 
02:34:50.469 --> 02:34:50.479 align:start position:0%
no income cap are very like to take the
 
02:34:53.750 --> 02:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
cash so costing the state some 60 to 80
 
02:34:57.269 --> 02:34:57.279 align:start position:0%
million a year and this is a number um
 
02:35:01.469 --> 02:35:01.479 align:start position:0%
that um uh that's based on information
 
02:35:04.190 --> 02:35:04.200 align:start position:0%
on the number of of Stu of school age
 
02:35:06.389 --> 02:35:06.399 align:start position:0%
students that live in New Hampshire but
 
02:35:09.910 --> 02:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
it's also supported by uh by you know a
 
02:35:11.870 --> 02:35:11.880 align:start position:0%
for the former member from where and
 
02:35:15.030 --> 02:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
former chair of this um this committee
 
02:35:17.990 --> 02:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
so just yesterday the Josiah Bartlet
 
02:35:19.750 --> 02:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
Center put out an estimate that this
 
02:35:22.070 --> 02:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
would cost about $5 million well that's
 
02:35:24.309 --> 02:35:24.319 align:start position:0%
laughable given the uh the de the
 
02:35:26.750 --> 02:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
demographic data and I urge this
 
02:35:30.550 --> 02:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
committee to do its job and not wave off
 
02:35:32.990 --> 02:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
getting a detailed fiscal analysis of
 
02:35:35.190 --> 02:35:35.200 align:start position:0%
this program I hope you'll look into the
 
02:35:37.230 --> 02:35:37.240 align:start position:0%
cost associated with this and I hope
 
02:35:39.110 --> 02:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
you'll find that um expanding to
 
02:35:41.630 --> 02:35:41.640 align:start position:0%
Universal vouchers is uh is not the
 
02:35:43.269 --> 02:35:43.279 align:start position:0%
right thing to do at this time thank you
 
02:35:50.510 --> 02:35:50.520 align:start position:0%

so much for allowing me to speak today
 
02:36:30.990 --> 02:36:31.000 align:start position:0%
I'm coming to you as a mother a resident
 
02:36:32.710 --> 02:36:32.720 align:start position:0%
and a compassionate and dedicated
 
02:36:35.230 --> 02:36:35.240 align:start position:0%
hardworking woman these are traits that
 
02:36:37.429 --> 02:36:37.439 align:start position:0%
I carried with me as I migrated here
 
02:36:39.429 --> 02:36:39.439 align:start position:0%
from Massachusetts for a better life for
 
02:36:41.510 --> 02:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
me and my daughter as you see this is
 
02:36:45.030 --> 02:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
Zana back in the fall of 2022 I never
 
02:36:46.429 --> 02:36:46.439 align:start position:0%
thought in a million years that I would
 
02:36:48.830 --> 02:36:48.840 align:start position:0%
be out of work for over a year and half
 
02:36:51.190 --> 02:36:51.200 align:start position:0%
of the reason was due to lack of child
 
02:36:53.670 --> 02:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
care availability in the area I live in
 
02:36:56.030 --> 02:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
Bristol my daughter was able to attend
 
02:36:58.230 --> 02:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
one facility but was expelled due to
 
02:37:00.309 --> 02:37:00.319 align:start position:0%
behavioral issues she had when she was
 
02:37:02.750 --> 02:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
two I was then forced to seek child care
 
02:37:05.230 --> 02:37:05.240 align:start position:0%
in lonia which in which is 25 minutes
 
02:37:07.550 --> 02:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
away from where we
 
02:37:11.870 --> 02:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
live yes M and that also fell through it
 
02:37:13.550 --> 02:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
was the end of the school year and I put
 
02:37:15.190 --> 02:37:15.200 align:start position:0%
myself on a waiting list at both Head
 
02:37:17.110 --> 02:37:17.120 align:start position:0%
Start and a local daycare facility that
 
02:37:18.670 --> 02:37:18.680 align:start position:0%
was willing to take on my daughter even
 
02:37:20.070 --> 02:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
though she had just been been diagnosed
 
02:37:21.990 --> 02:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
with a developmental delay these are
 
02:37:23.349 --> 02:37:23.359 align:start position:0%
only a few of the trials and
 
02:37:25.070 --> 02:37:25.080 align:start position:0%
tribulations that I had to go through to
 
02:37:27.710 --> 02:37:27.720 align:start position:0%
seek reliable child care then came
 
02:37:29.790 --> 02:37:29.800 align:start position:0%
applying for a child care scholarship
 
02:37:32.670 --> 02:37:32.680 align:start position:0%
with DHHS which took about 90 days in
 
02:37:35.830 --> 02:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
total to obtain once obtained I still
 
02:37:37.790 --> 02:37:37.800 align:start position:0%
had to come up with $300 for the first
 
02:37:39.590 --> 02:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
two weeks that my daughter would attend
 
02:37:42.230 --> 02:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
the child care and I ask you this how
 
02:37:43.670 --> 02:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
can a parent or a family come up with
 
02:37:45.950 --> 02:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
$300 for child care if they don't even
 
02:37:47.870 --> 02:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
have income or employment and they're
 
02:37:50.389 --> 02:37:50.399 align:start position:0%
seeking income and employment while also
 
02:37:52.630 --> 02:37:52.640 align:start position:0%
seeking Child Care these numbers aren't
 
02:37:54.790 --> 02:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
adding up I need you to take a hard look
 
02:37:56.550 --> 02:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
at the paperwork in front of you the
 
02:37:59.349 --> 02:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
numbers don't lie I'm here as a mother
 
02:38:01.269 --> 02:38:01.279 align:start position:0%
pleading for you to consider increasing
 
02:38:02.510 --> 02:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
the funding for this child care
 
02:38:04.469 --> 02:38:04.479 align:start position:0%
scholarship and somehow allowing it
 
02:38:06.630 --> 02:38:06.640 align:start position:0%
possible and easier for families to
 
02:38:09.110 --> 02:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
obtain Child Care affordable child care
 
02:38:11.070 --> 02:38:11.080 align:start position:0%

be working citizens of New Hampshire
 
02:38:27.110 --> 02:38:27.120 align:start position:0%

by cut in Medicaid this would be
 
02:38:55.550 --> 02:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
detrimental to Services across the state

as well as the workforce which many
 
02:39:00.269 --> 02:39:00.279 align:start position:0%
people have expressed concern about I'm
 
02:39:02.309 --> 02:39:02.319 align:start position:0%
here today in support of ensuring that
 
02:39:04.349 --> 02:39:04.359 align:start position:0%
adequate CFI funding remains in the

02:39:59.230 --> 02:39:59.240 align:start position:0%
component of our system of care
 
02:40:01.550 --> 02:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
hospitals are overburdened and unable to
 
02:40:03.309 --> 02:40:03.319 align:start position:0%
discharge clients due to a lack of
 
02:40:04.870 --> 02:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
available beds and nursing homes
 
02:40:07.309 --> 02:40:07.319 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation centers and homebased
 
02:40:09.830 --> 02:40:09.840 align:start position:0%

Stays creating a log gym in the system
 
02:40:14.469 --> 02:40:14.479 align:start position:0%

risks of social isolation Falls and
 
02:40:35.309 --> 02:40:35.319 align:start position:0%
unnecessary hospitalizations I just want
 
02:40:37.550 --> 02:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
to share a quick client story as this
 
02:40:40.389 --> 02:40:40.399 align:start position:0%
client wasn't able to attend today in
 
02:40:42.790 --> 02:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
March of 2024 we received a referral for
 
02:40:44.830 --> 02:40:44.840 align:start position:0%
81-year-old female who resides in
 
02:40:47.550 --> 02:40:47.560 align:start position:0%
Manchester within 72 hours of receiving
 
02:40:49.990 --> 02:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
the referral we were able to open the
 
02:40:51.790 --> 02:40:51.800 align:start position:0%
client and begin providing essential
 
02:40:54.469 --> 02:40:54.479 align:start position:0%
nursing and pcsp services in the
 
02:40:57.150 --> 02:40:57.160 align:start position:0%
client's home she was extremely highrisk
 
02:40:59.070 --> 02:40:59.080 align:start position:0%
and medically compromised she had
 
02:41:01.950 --> 02:41:01.960 align:start position:0%
mobility issues and was a fall risk she
 
02:41:04.110 --> 02:41:04.120 align:start position:0%
was unable to move without the use of an
 
02:41:06.349 --> 02:41:06.359 align:start position:0%
assisted device and unable to leave her
 
02:41:09.309 --> 02:41:09.319 align:start position:0%
home she spent almost a year without
 
02:41:10.670 --> 02:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
leaving her
 
02:41:10.680 --> 02:41:12.990 align:start position:0%
leaving her
home

02:41:12.990 --> 02:41:13.000 align:start position:0%
home
 
02:41:16.870 --> 02:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
um she was unable to sorry um she was
 
02:41:18.950 --> 02:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
unable to leave to do essential errands
 
02:41:20.630 --> 02:41:20.640 align:start position:0%
such as is grocery shopping laundry and
 
02:41:22.550 --> 02:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
picking up her medication she was on
 
02:41:25.870 --> 02:41:25.880 align:start position:0%
24-hour O2 for her COPD she was unable
 
02:41:27.990 --> 02:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
to bathe and dress
 
02:41:31.389 --> 02:41:31.399 align:start position:0%
herself ultimately leading to unhygienic
 
02:41:33.070 --> 02:41:33.080 align:start position:0%
conditions which impacted her overall
 
02:41:35.389 --> 02:41:35.399 align:start position:0%
health her hair was Madden and her skin
 
02:41:37.910 --> 02:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
had sores her Livin situation and
 
02:41:39.710 --> 02:41:39.720 align:start position:0%
overall well-being was just completely
 
02:41:41.990 --> 02:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
unsafe she was struggling with untreated
 
02:41:44.389 --> 02:41:44.399 align:start position:0%
mental illness she was at risk of having
 
02:41:46.230 --> 02:41:46.240 align:start position:0%
to go into a nursing home despite her
 
02:41:48.510 --> 02:41:48.520 align:start position:0%
wish to stay at home she had a lack of
 
02:41:50.510 --> 02:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
community support for limited financial
 
02:41:53.710 --> 02:41:53.720 align:start position:0%
means and no family involvement the
 
02:41:56.510 --> 02:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
impact can I three minutes can I finish
 
02:41:58.349 --> 02:41:58.359 align:start position:0%
it's real
 
02:41:58.359 --> 02:42:00.830 align:start position:0%
it's real
quick

02:42:00.830 --> 02:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
quick
 
02:42:03.710 --> 02:42:03.720 align:start position:0%
um sorry
 
02:42:05.710 --> 02:42:05.720 align:start position:0%
conclusion basically without our
 
02:42:06.950 --> 02:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
services she would have been in the
 
02:42:09.910 --> 02:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
nursing home so
 
02:42:19.910 --> 02:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:21.830 --> 02:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the cooperation most of you
 
02:42:24.150 --> 02:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
are sticking to three minutes or less
 
02:42:25.790 --> 02:42:25.800 align:start position:0%
we've still got many more to go and it
 
02:42:29.030 --> 02:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
could be two more hours or more all
 
02:42:30.990 --> 02:42:31.000 align:start position:0%
right Debbie and Zeke Richardson will be
 
02:42:36.429 --> 02:42:36.439 align:start position:0%
followed by Dam uh damis
 
02:42:38.710 --> 02:42:38.720 align:start position:0%
santara thank you so much so I'm here on
 
02:42:40.550 --> 02:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
behalf of my grandson Zeke Richardson he
 
02:42:42.630 --> 02:42:42.640 align:start position:0%
just wants to say a few words as best as
 
02:42:45.870 --> 02:42:45.880 align:start position:0%
he can go ahead
 
02:42:45.880 --> 02:42:47.870 align:start position:0%
he can go ahead
go

02:42:47.870 --> 02:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
go
 
02:42:50.950 --> 02:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
um hey
 
02:42:54.230 --> 02:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
GJ yeah okay so um he just wants to
 
02:42:56.830 --> 02:42:56.840 align:start position:0%
share his story see stay here with me he
 
02:42:58.870 --> 02:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
just wants to share his story so he um
 
02:43:01.710 --> 02:43:01.720 align:start position:0%
was born uh with Down Syndrome but he
 
02:43:04.950 --> 02:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
has uh multiple GI issues um and he came
 
02:43:06.990 --> 02:43:07.000 align:start position:0%
to live with us when he was 8 years old
 
02:43:09.710 --> 02:43:09.720 align:start position:0%
we are his grandparents so um he lives
 
02:43:12.630 --> 02:43:12.640 align:start position:0%
with u myself and my husband because of
 
02:43:14.630 --> 02:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
some substance misuse that happened in
 
02:43:16.910 --> 02:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
the family this is a normal um
 
02:43:20.389 --> 02:43:20.399 align:start position:0%
unfortunate um case that you see across
 
02:43:21.870 --> 02:43:21.880 align:start position:0%
the board so we are dealing with
 
02:43:24.230 --> 02:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
multiple things um because Zeke lives
 
02:43:26.429 --> 02:43:26.439 align:start position:0%
with us we provide 247 care he's
 
02:43:29.389 --> 02:43:29.399 align:start position:0%
essentially nonverbal um he needs
 
02:43:32.230 --> 02:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
assistance with all daily activities but
 
02:43:34.910 --> 02:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
he has had an amazing life he has had an
 
02:43:37.590 --> 02:43:37.600 align:start position:0%
excellent uh school system um and
 
02:43:39.230 --> 02:43:39.240 align:start position:0%
thrived he was known as the mayor of
 
02:43:41.830 --> 02:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
Newfound uh we live in Alexandria New
 
02:43:45.030 --> 02:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and um he just absolutely just
 
02:43:46.670 --> 02:43:46.680 align:start position:0%
thrives everybody in the community knows
 
02:43:48.230 --> 02:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
him even though he's non-verbal he's
 
02:43:50.910 --> 02:43:50.920 align:start position:0%
still um just very very active very
 
02:43:54.349 --> 02:43:54.359 align:start position:0%
involved in the football program um but
 
02:43:56.030 --> 02:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
when he graduated from high school there
 
02:43:58.190 --> 02:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
was nothing for him he is part of Lakes
 
02:43:59.910 --> 02:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
Region community services and although
 
02:44:01.870 --> 02:44:01.880 align:start position:0%
they did everything that they could to
 
02:44:03.389 --> 02:44:03.399 align:start position:0%
help us uh we were unable to get
 
02:44:05.910 --> 02:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
services for him for two years he fell
 
02:44:07.990 --> 02:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
into a very deep depression this young
 
02:44:12.349 --> 02:44:12.359 align:start position:0%
man who is so engaged um re just was not
 
02:44:15.309 --> 02:44:15.319 align:start position:0%
able to communicate his needs he became
 
02:44:18.150 --> 02:44:18.160 align:start position:0%
very reclusive um he became disruptive
 
02:44:20.670 --> 02:44:20.680 align:start position:0%
it became very ult unlike anything he
 
02:44:23.070 --> 02:44:23.080 align:start position:0%
had been his entire life um we were
 
02:44:25.710 --> 02:44:25.720 align:start position:0%
fortunate enough to get um Services two
 
02:44:27.790 --> 02:44:27.800 align:start position:0%
days a week it has dramatically changed
 
02:44:29.630 --> 02:44:29.640 align:start position:0%
him back to the young man that he is
 
02:44:32.469 --> 02:44:32.479 align:start position:0%
today and he is so happy are you so
 
02:44:34.990 --> 02:44:35.000 align:start position:0%
happy Zeke so please continue to fund it
 
02:44:36.550 --> 02:44:36.560 align:start position:0%
because without these services I don't
 
02:44:38.870 --> 02:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
know where we'd be I am a nurse I work
 
02:44:40.990 --> 02:44:41.000 align:start position:0%
on the days that he attends these these
 
02:44:43.870 --> 02:44:43.880 align:start position:0%
uh Community programs he works at hords
 
02:44:46.550 --> 02:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
um my husband works nights so we provide
 
02:44:48.830 --> 02:44:48.840 align:start position:0%
as much support as we possibly can but
 
02:44:51.269 --> 02:44:51.279 align:start position:0%
we need your help in order for him to be
 
02:44:54.150 --> 02:44:54.160 align:start position:0%
able to do and live and be the best
 
02:45:06.550 --> 02:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:09.870 --> 02:45:09.880 align:start position:0%
right did I pronounce the name right
 
02:45:13.070 --> 02:45:13.080 align:start position:0%
Santa uh Santana a colleague filled it
 
02:45:14.830 --> 02:45:14.840 align:start position:0%
out for me as I was coming in so that's
 
02:45:17.550 --> 02:45:17.560 align:start position:0%
what was the first name Damen Damen
 
02:45:19.550 --> 02:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
thank you he will be followed by
 
02:45:29.990 --> 02:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:32.030 --> 02:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
bergham so I just wanted to speak
 
02:45:34.190 --> 02:45:34.200 align:start position:0%
briefly on the Alcohol fund and I have a
 
02:45:35.710 --> 02:45:35.720 align:start position:0%
colleague that will be speaking more
 
02:45:36.870 --> 02:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
directly to the programs that it
 
02:45:38.510 --> 02:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
supports uh within the public health
 
02:45:40.110 --> 02:45:40.120 align:start position:0%
networks but as an employee of the
 
02:45:41.710 --> 02:45:41.720 align:start position:0%
public health networks for the State of
 
02:45:43.190 --> 02:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I wanted to talk a little
 
02:45:45.269 --> 02:45:45.279 align:start position:0%
bit uh more broadly about the work that
 
02:45:47.349 --> 02:45:47.359 align:start position:0%
we do and what this funding helps to
 
02:45:50.910 --> 02:45:50.920 align:start position:0%
support so one of the things that the
 
02:45:52.750 --> 02:45:52.760 align:start position:0%
public health networks do within the
 
02:45:55.710 --> 02:45:55.720 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire is create um
 
02:45:57.990 --> 02:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
strategic plans to support emergency
 
02:45:59.950 --> 02:45:59.960 align:start position:0%
response Services throughout the state
 
02:46:02.230 --> 02:46:02.240 align:start position:0%
so there are 13 networks we cover a
 
02:46:03.990 --> 02:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
number of towns in each region I cover
 
02:46:06.910 --> 02:46:06.920 align:start position:0%
24 towns around conquered and our
 
02:46:10.269 --> 02:46:10.279 align:start position:0%
responsibility uh within those um
 
02:46:12.950 --> 02:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
networks is to maintain things like
 
02:46:14.910 --> 02:46:14.920 align:start position:0%
trained volunteers Medical Reserve Corps
 
02:46:17.030 --> 02:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
volunteers uh emergency response
 
02:46:19.550 --> 02:46:19.560 align:start position:0%
Services things like that and we we
 
02:46:21.469 --> 02:46:21.479 align:start position:0%
collaborate and work closely with
 
02:46:24.269 --> 02:46:24.279 align:start position:0%
Emergency Management directors uh First
 
02:46:26.790 --> 02:46:26.800 align:start position:0%
Responders multiple departments at
 
02:46:29.550 --> 02:46:29.560 align:start position:0%
DHHS and we all have a critical role in
 
02:46:31.910 --> 02:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
responding to emergencies so something
 
02:46:34.070 --> 02:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
like the covid-19 pandemic we all play a
 
02:46:36.070 --> 02:46:36.080 align:start position:0%
part in making sure that vaccin
 
02:46:37.710 --> 02:46:37.720 align:start position:0%
vaccinations and information get out to
 
02:46:39.990 --> 02:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
the towns in a timely man manner so that
 
02:46:43.230 --> 02:46:43.240 align:start position:0%
we can address our most vulnerable
 
02:46:45.349 --> 02:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
populations so this funding is really
 
02:46:46.990 --> 02:46:47.000 align:start position:0%
critical to supporting these networks
 
02:46:49.710 --> 02:46:49.720 align:start position:0%
because without that uh pre-existing
 
02:46:52.550 --> 02:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
infrastructure we would be completely
 
02:46:54.590 --> 02:46:54.600 align:start position:0%
unprepared to respond to the next public
 
02:46:56.990 --> 02:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
health emergency whether it's natural
 
02:47:00.269 --> 02:47:00.279 align:start position:0%
disaster uh or another pandemic for
 
02:47:02.389 --> 02:47:02.399 align:start position:0%
example so I hope this testimony is
 
02:47:04.230 --> 02:47:04.240 align:start position:0%
helpful just helping to contextualize
 
02:47:06.389 --> 02:47:06.399 align:start position:0%
what those networks are for and how they

opportunity to
 
02:52:02.190 --> 02:52:02.200 align:start position:0%
succeed it is our fervent request that

our legislators carefully consider the
 
02:52:05.990 --> 02:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
persistent effects of underfunding our

embarrassing and
 
02:52:17.150 --> 02:52:17.160 align:start position:0%
unconscionable the reason you've heard
 
02:52:18.550 --> 02:52:18.560 align:start position:0%
about it and continue to hear about
 
02:52:20.309 --> 02:52:20.319 align:start position:0%
about it is it
 
02:52:22.590 --> 02:52:22.600 align:start position:0%
persists the current system creates
 
02:52:25.790 --> 02:52:25.800 align:start position:0%
profound inequality forcing towns with
 
02:52:27.750 --> 02:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
lower property values to make impossible
 
02:52:30.349 --> 02:52:30.359 align:start position:0%
choices between raising taxes and
 
02:52:32.950 --> 02:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
cutting essential programs these
 
02:52:36.150 --> 02:52:36.160 align:start position:0%

towns against each other these
 
02:52:43.429 --> 02:52:43.439 align:start position:0%
disparities also discourage young people
 
02:52:45.710 --> 02:52:45.720 align:start position:0%
from returning to New Hampshire because
 
02:52:48.030 --> 02:52:48.040 align:start position:0%
only the wealthy can afford to live

where the schools remain properly funded
 
02:52:53.630 --> 02:52:53.640 align:start position:0%
this is not in the true Spirit of the

obligation and a responsibility to
 
02:53:12.830 --> 02:53:12.840 align:start position:0%
participate and advocate for those who
 
02:53:15.550 --> 02:53:15.560 align:start position:0%
cannot advocate for
 
02:53:18.190 --> 02:53:18.200 align:start position:0%
themselves our state can't afford for
 
02:53:21.670 --> 02:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
our communities to diminish our economy
 
02:53:24.910 --> 02:53:24.920 align:start position:0%
and to and need to invest in our state's
 
02:53:27.750 --> 02:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
future I ask everyone but particularly
 
02:53:29.349 --> 02:53:29.359 align:start position:0%
the committee members in front of me who
 
02:53:32.429 --> 02:53:32.439 align:start position:0%
have patiently sat through testimony ask
 
02:53:34.710 --> 02:53:34.720 align:start position:0%
yourself as you look in the mirror
 
02:53:37.750 --> 02:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
whether you an elected official of we
 
02:53:40.590 --> 02:53:40.600 align:start position:0%
the people can turn away from your
 
02:53:42.910 --> 02:53:42.920 align:start position:0%
neighbors and their families by
 
02:53:45.710 --> 02:53:45.720 align:start position:0%
continuing to ignore your constitutional
 
02:53:49.910 --> 02:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility to fund public education
 
02:53:49.920 --> 02:53:56.750 align:start position:0%

02:53:56.750 --> 02:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:01.229 --> 02:54:01.239 align:start position:0%
you Kelsey Brooke Emory and I believe I
 
02:54:05.070 --> 02:54:05.080 align:start position:0%
have a second card from Damian Santana I
 
02:54:07.349 --> 02:54:07.359 align:start position:0%
think he spoke and
 
02:54:11.870 --> 02:54:11.880 align:start position:0%
left okay why did he put in two cards
 
02:54:16.110 --> 02:54:16.120 align:start position:0%
anyway Kelsey followed by Michelle St
 
02:54:19.150 --> 02:54:19.160 align:start position:0%
John okay I'm standing in opposition to
 
02:54:21.630 --> 02:54:21.640 align:start position:0%
further cuts to higher education as it's
 
02:54:23.830 --> 02:54:23.840 align:start position:0%
related to the state's mandate to
 
02:54:25.750 --> 02:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
provide an adequate
 
02:54:28.190 --> 02:54:28.200 align:start position:0%
education um I will not be talking about
 
02:54:30.710 --> 02:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
my strong opposition to foucher programs
 
02:54:33.030 --> 02:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
as I agree with most of the already
 
02:54:35.550 --> 02:54:35.560 align:start position:0%
vocalized concerns the only thing that I
 
02:54:36.990 --> 02:54:37.000 align:start position:0%
want to add to what has already been
 
02:54:39.950 --> 02:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
said is a challenge um there is a false
 
02:54:41.870 --> 02:54:41.880 align:start position:0%
presumption that private schools
 
02:54:44.150 --> 02:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
outperform public ones and if the

unaccountable voucher program is doing

data to prove
 
02:54:54.910 --> 02:54:54.920 align:start position:0%
that my commentary today is aimed at
 
02:54:56.790 --> 02:54:56.800 align:start position:0%

proam that I may serve and foremost um
 
02:55:53.630 --> 02:55:53.640 align:start position:0%
is the work that we do in creating the

Leaders uh if we continue to take a
 
02:56:02.870 --> 02:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
for-profit model and apply it to higher
 
02:56:04.990 --> 02:56:05.000 align:start position:0%
education we will see a degrading effect
 
02:56:07.950 --> 02:56:07.960 align:start position:0%
across the entire State not just at PSU
 
02:56:10.950 --> 02:56:10.960 align:start position:0%
we are already seeing these effects UNH
 
02:56:13.510 --> 02:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
is closing Ed programs Rivier is closing
 
02:56:16.389 --> 02:56:16.399 align:start position:0%
Ed programs at PSU we were forced to
 
02:56:18.469 --> 02:56:18.479 align:start position:0%
close early childhood education we've
 
02:56:20.269 --> 02:56:20.279 align:start position:0%
heard about the effects of that already
 
02:56:23.469 --> 02:56:23.479 align:start position:0%
today math education Science Education
 
02:56:26.309 --> 02:56:26.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:29.309 --> 02:56:29.319 align:start position:0%
closed the effect New Hampshire is not
 
02:56:31.550 --> 02:56:31.560 align:start position:0%
preparing a new generation of math and
 
02:56:33.910 --> 02:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
science and early childhood Educators we
 
02:56:36.910 --> 02:56:36.920 align:start position:0%
are importing them or allowing them to
 
02:56:39.630 --> 02:56:39.640 align:start position:0%
uh we allowing people to bypass higher
 
02:56:42.269 --> 02:56:42.279 align:start position:0%
education wrongly suggested that any
 
02:56:44.030 --> 02:56:44.040 align:start position:0%
person who is good at calculus can
 
02:56:46.630 --> 02:56:46.640 align:start position:0%
somehow convey that to young people
 
02:56:48.870 --> 02:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
worse while my programs social studies
 
02:56:51.269 --> 02:56:51.279 align:start position:0%
education is going to survive the budget
 
02:56:53.229 --> 02:56:53.239 align:start position:0%
cuts that have been proposed by our
 
02:56:56.830 --> 02:56:56.840 align:start position:0%
president um The Faculty in the content
 
02:56:59.670 --> 02:56:59.680 align:start position:0%

Majors by having adjunct faculty member
 
02:57:13.910 --> 02:57:13.920 align:start position:0%

they
 
03:06:02.150 --> 03:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
age in 2023 this body passed Landmark
 
03:06:04.349 --> 03:06:04.359 align:start position:0%
legislation that adopted the system of
 
03:06:06.590 --> 03:06:06.600 align:start position:0%
care for healthy aging and this promoted
 
03:06:08.950 --> 03:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
home and communitybased Care
 
03:06:11.309 --> 03:06:11.319 align:start position:0%
programs progress under the system of

03:06:16.880 --> 03:06:18.110 align:start position:0%
supported building on the existing
infrastructure

03:06:18.110 --> 03:06:18.120 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
03:06:20.630 --> 03:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
so that adults have timely access to
 
03:06:23.269 --> 03:06:23.279 align:start position:0%
home care including the choices for
 
03:06:25.550 --> 03:06:25.560 align:start position:0%
Independence program but also other
 
03:06:27.830 --> 03:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
programs that support community
 
03:06:30.150 --> 03:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
living as you've heard investing in
 
03:06:32.269 --> 03:06:32.279 align:start position:0%
programs that enable adults to remain in
 
03:06:35.309 --> 03:06:35.319 align:start position:0%
the community it's a wise use of
 
03:06:38.190 --> 03:06:38.200 align:start position:0%
resources given that this support can
 
03:06:41.550 --> 03:06:41.560 align:start position:0%
delay the need for more costly long-term
 
03:06:43.790 --> 03:06:43.800 align:start position:0%
care services you've heard other people
 
03:06:45.670 --> 03:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
speak of the choices for Independence
 
03:06:48.349 --> 03:06:48.359 align:start position:0%
program specifically about about the
 
03:06:50.269 --> 03:06:50.279 align:start position:0%
critical need in the community so I
 
03:06:52.910 --> 03:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
won't go into that in detail but wanted
 
03:06:55.990 --> 03:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
to highlight a few other key programs
 
03:06:57.950 --> 03:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
that provide support for folks in the
 
03:07:00.550 --> 03:07:00.560 align:start position:0%
community and often these programs have
 
03:07:04.349 --> 03:07:04.359 align:start position:0%
lower dollar figures but can help folks
 
03:07:06.510 --> 03:07:06.520 align:start position:0%
stay in the community and just a few of
 
03:07:08.990 --> 03:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
these that you'll see in the budget one
 
03:07:11.429 --> 03:07:11.439 align:start position:0%
is caregiver respit
 
03:07:14.309 --> 03:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
programs another is harnessing the power
 
03:07:15.590 --> 03:07:15.600 align:start position:0%
of senior
 
03:07:18.510 --> 03:07:18.520 align:start position:0%
volunteers volunteers in the community
 
03:07:20.750 --> 03:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
help other people in the community
 
03:07:22.790 --> 03:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
Target the needs of the community
 
03:07:25.710 --> 03:07:25.720 align:start position:0%
reducing the need for long-term
 
03:07:29.550 --> 03:07:29.560 align:start position:0%
care we'd also mention Meals on Wheels
 
03:07:31.950 --> 03:07:31.960 align:start position:0%
congregate housing the need for
 
03:07:31.960 --> 03:07:33.870 align:start position:0%
congregate housing the need for
Guardianship

03:07:33.870 --> 03:07:33.880 align:start position:0%
Guardianship
 
03:07:36.309 --> 03:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
Services also the need for access to
 
03:07:36.319 --> 03:07:37.110 align:start position:0%
Services also the need for access to
public

03:07:37.110 --> 03:07:37.120 align:start position:0%
public
 
03:07:39.150 --> 03:07:39.160 align:start position:0%
transportation by providing people
 
03:07:41.030 --> 03:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
access to Transportation they can get
 
03:07:43.110 --> 03:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
the support they need for medical care
 
03:07:43.120 --> 03:07:44.510 align:start position:0%
the support they need for medical care
food

03:07:44.510 --> 03:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
food
 
03:07:46.950 --> 03:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
medications and finally just want to say
 
03:07:48.269 --> 03:07:48.279 align:start position:0%
a word
 
03:07:51.190 --> 03:07:51.200 align:start position:0%
about the barriers that would be set up
 
03:07:54.269 --> 03:07:54.279 align:start position:0%
in House Bill 2 regarding accessing
 
03:07:57.389 --> 03:07:57.399 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and urge you to consider what
 
03:07:59.670 --> 03:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
that would mean for older adults in New
 
03:08:02.309 --> 03:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire just finally as you draft the
 
03:08:05.150 --> 03:08:05.160 align:start position:0%
budget you're concerned about cost
 
03:08:07.190 --> 03:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness keeping individuals in
 
03:08:09.150 --> 03:08:09.160 align:start position:0%
their homes in New Hampshire is cost
 
03:08:12.710 --> 03:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
effective it has a high rate of return
 
03:08:14.790 --> 03:08:14.800 align:start position:0%
and it makes sense for granite Staters
 
03:08:16.910 --> 03:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
it makes sense for the state budget
 
03:08:24.110 --> 03:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:27.110 --> 03:08:27.120 align:start position:0%

extraordinary married children two of

which were born with a rare genetic
 
03:10:53.349 --> 03:10:53.359 align:start position:0%
syndrome called
 
03:10:56.550 --> 03:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
sodos our son Frankie who is a humorous
 
03:10:59.429 --> 03:10:59.439 align:start position:0%
affectionate 10-year-old um began
 
03:11:01.910 --> 03:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
receiving early intervention services
 
03:11:04.389 --> 03:11:04.399 align:start position:0%
through early supports at gateways when
 
03:11:08.030 --> 03:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
he was 5 months old he continued to get
 
03:11:10.389 --> 03:11:10.399 align:start position:0%
physical and speech therapy until he was
 
03:11:13.229 --> 03:11:13.239 align:start position:0%
three and then he was transitioned at 3
 
03:11:16.030 --> 03:11:16.040 align:start position:0%
years old to intensive needs special
 
03:11:21.070 --> 03:11:21.080 align:start position:0%
education um at the Nashville School
 
03:11:24.870 --> 03:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
District the impact that that early
 
03:11:27.309 --> 03:11:27.319 align:start position:0%
support that he received from zero to
 
03:11:27.319 --> 03:11:28.950 align:start position:0%
support that he received from zero to
three

03:11:28.950 --> 03:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
three
 
03:11:32.190 --> 03:11:32.200 align:start position:0%
um wasn't really fully realized until we
 
03:11:35.990 --> 03:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
adopted our third child um we adopted
 
03:11:39.309 --> 03:11:39.319 align:start position:0%
our daughter magdalina in 2021 from an
 
03:11:42.229 --> 03:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
orphanage in Bulgaria and she was born
 
03:11:44.830 --> 03:11:44.840 align:start position:0%
with the same rare genetic disorder
 
03:11:47.550 --> 03:11:47.560 align:start position:0%
sodos um but she had spent her first 5
 
03:11:50.990 --> 03:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
and a half years of life in a Bulgarian
 
03:11:53.710 --> 03:11:53.720 align:start position:0%
orphanage so she did not get early
 
03:11:53.720 --> 03:11:54.750 align:start position:0%
orphanage so she did not get early
support

03:11:54.750 --> 03:11:54.760 align:start position:0%
support
 
03:11:58.550 --> 03:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
services and it was staggering to us to
 
03:12:01.750 --> 03:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
see the difference between she and our
 
03:12:04.870 --> 03:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
son by birth um now granted not all
 
03:12:06.150 --> 03:12:06.160 align:start position:0%
people with sodos are going to be
 
03:12:10.070 --> 03:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
identical but um my house is a is a home
 
03:12:13.790 --> 03:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
study to prove like here's a child with
 
03:12:16.309 --> 03:12:16.319 align:start position:0%
the same genetic disorder that was born
 
03:12:19.030 --> 03:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
the same year as child who who didn't
 
03:12:22.269 --> 03:12:22.279 align:start position:0%
get the early support services
 
03:12:26.190 --> 03:12:26.200 align:start position:0%
so um I'm here to impress upon you a
 
03:12:29.429 --> 03:12:29.439 align:start position:0%
real life example of why funding these
 
03:12:32.630 --> 03:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
types of programs matters because I have
 
03:12:36.870 --> 03:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
seen the difference and it's not lost on
 
03:12:38.670 --> 03:12:38.680 align:start position:0%

proposed cuts to the State Medicaid
 
03:13:59.950 --> 03:13:59.960 align:start position:0%
Program and the granite Advantage
 
03:14:03.950 --> 03:14:03.960 align:start position:0%
Program to be clear these Cuts
 
03:14:06.110 --> 03:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
jeopardize the health and well-being of
 
03:14:09.590 --> 03:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
every citizen in New Hampshire not just
 
03:14:11.950 --> 03:14:11.960 align:start position:0%
those who are participants in this
 
03:14:14.590 --> 03:14:14.600 align:start position:0%
program they do so by threatening to
 
03:14:17.229 --> 03:14:17.239 align:start position:0%
unravel the financial underpinnings of
 
03:14:20.469 --> 03:14:20.479 align:start position:0%
our state's Health Care System nearly
 
03:14:22.150 --> 03:14:22.160 align:start position:0%
every component of the Health Care
 
03:14:24.630 --> 03:14:24.640 align:start position:0%
system that we know today is dependent
 
03:14:27.469 --> 03:14:27.479 align:start position:0%
upon Medicaid from our local ambulance
 
03:14:30.269 --> 03:14:30.279 align:start position:0%
services to primary care clinics to home
 
03:14:33.190 --> 03:14:33.200 align:start position:0%
care services to hospitals to nursing
 
03:14:36.190 --> 03:14:36.200 align:start position:0%
homes these systems are already under
 
03:14:38.750 --> 03:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
stress additional Financial losses
 
03:14:40.269 --> 03:14:40.279 align:start position:0%
resulting from Medicaid Cuts will
 
03:14:42.790 --> 03:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
undermine the very existence of some of
 
03:14:45.670 --> 03:14:45.680 align:start position:0%
them in my view it's not an exaggeration
 
03:14:47.469 --> 03:14:47.479 align:start position:0%
to suggest that we may lose some of
 
03:14:50.150 --> 03:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
these critical Services if these cuts
 
03:14:51.990 --> 03:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
and others being proposed at the federal
 
03:14:55.309 --> 03:14:55.319 align:start position:0%
level take place for people who rely on
 
03:14:57.309 --> 03:14:57.319 align:start position:0%
these programs they will feel it most
 
03:14:59.950 --> 03:14:59.960 align:start position:0%
strongly but all of us will feel it and
 
03:15:02.429 --> 03:15:02.439 align:start position:0%
will feel it in various forms those
 
03:15:05.070 --> 03:15:05.080 align:start position:0%
forms include local ambulance services
 
03:15:07.870 --> 03:15:07.880 align:start position:0%
that are no longer available delays in
 
03:15:09.830 --> 03:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
access to Primary Care and Specialty
 
03:15:12.670 --> 03:15:12.680 align:start position:0%

03:15:15.990 --> 03:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
departments delayed Hospital admissions
 
03:15:18.030 --> 03:15:18.040 align:start position:0%
decreased availab ility of nursing home
 
03:15:20.910 --> 03:15:20.920 align:start position:0%

little bit about the alcohol fund the

governor's Commission on Alcohol and

Other Drugs the um new features has
 
03:17:02.070 --> 03:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
always supported a fully funded alcohol
 
03:17:04.750 --> 03:17:04.760 align:start position:0%
fund um the intent behind this is the
 
03:17:07.550 --> 03:17:07.560 align:start position:0%
alcohol fund would be funded by 5% of
 
03:17:10.110 --> 03:17:10.120 align:start position:0%
gross profits of substantial sale of
 
03:17:13.830 --> 03:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
alcohol revenues um up until uh the last
 
03:17:15.670 --> 03:17:15.680 align:start position:0%
budget cycle it was always it was never
 
03:17:18.349 --> 03:17:18.359 align:start position:0%
fully funded or it was diverted it was
 
03:17:20.229 --> 03:17:20.239 align:start position:0%
this committee that restored that
 
03:17:22.429 --> 03:17:22.439 align:start position:0%
funding um since then the governor's
 
03:17:24.229 --> 03:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
commission has made substantial
 
03:17:26.590 --> 03:17:26.600 align:start position:0%
commitments to the state substance use
 
03:17:29.389 --> 03:17:29.399 align:start position:0%

03:17:31.189 --> 03:17:31.199 align:start position:0%
hear about the student assistant

03:17:36.550 --> 03:17:36.560 align:start position:0%
but I have with me today um dozens of
 
03:17:38.110 --> 03:17:38.120 align:start position:0%
letters from recovery centers and
 
03:17:39.790 --> 03:17:39.800 align:start position:0%
treatment centers that have been able to
 
03:17:41.710 --> 03:17:41.720 align:start position:0%
do the work under the alcohol fund as
 
03:17:44.189 --> 03:17:44.199 align:start position:0%
well as their annual report we also
 
03:17:46.150 --> 03:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
support the system for children's
 
03:17:47.630 --> 03:17:47.640 align:start position:0%

division of Behavioral Health Services
 
03:17:51.590 --> 03:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
it's important to fully fund the
 
03:17:53.790 --> 03:17:53.800 align:start position:0%
children's system of care we are
 
03:17:57.429 --> 03:17:57.439 align:start position:0%
concerned about a um a cut that may not
 
03:17:59.990 --> 03:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
allow the children's system of Care
 
03:18:02.469 --> 03:18:02.479 align:start position:0%
Resource Center to continue um we've
 
03:18:04.309 --> 03:18:04.319 align:start position:0%
made a lot of Headway in the children's
 
03:18:06.990 --> 03:18:07.000 align:start position:0%
system of care and we really feel it's
 
03:18:09.110 --> 03:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
important to um fully fund these
 
03:18:11.510 --> 03:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
critical Services there are various
 
03:18:13.030 --> 03:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
areas within the division of Public
 
03:18:16.150 --> 03:18:16.160 align:start position:0%

03:18:18.550 --> 03:18:18.560 align:start position:0%

Centers lastly just to touch base on
 
03:18:31.750 --> 03:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
what you heard about the graned
 
03:18:34.469 --> 03:18:34.479 align:start position:0%
advantage premiums we have concerns
 
03:18:36.590 --> 03:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
about what that impact will be to
 
03:18:39.189 --> 03:18:39.199 align:start position:0%
clients um we know that charging
 
03:18:41.349 --> 03:18:41.359 align:start position:0%
premiums will lead to substantial
 
03:18:44.550 --> 03:18:44.560 align:start position:0%
disenrollment it will also um not really
 
03:18:46.830 --> 03:18:46.840 align:start position:0%
generate the potential Revenue gains
 
03:18:49.790 --> 03:18:49.800 align:start position:0%
we're uh concerned about the offset that
 
03:18:52.590 --> 03:18:52.600 align:start position:0%
other um hospitals and providers will
 
03:18:56.189 --> 03:18:56.199 align:start position:0%
see and um we also are concerned about
 
03:18:59.110 --> 03:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
people using more expensive um Services
 
03:19:01.229 --> 03:19:01.239 align:start position:0%
if they are disenrolled it will bring
 
03:19:03.349 --> 03:19:03.359 align:start position:0%
unintended additional costs to the state
 
03:19:06.429 --> 03:19:06.439 align:start position:0%
for that reason um we are we would like
 
03:19:08.990 --> 03:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
the legislature to reconc reconsider
 
03:19:11.309 --> 03:19:11.319 align:start position:0%
premiums and cost sharing I also have
 
03:19:13.070 --> 03:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
testimony from someone who had to leave
 
03:19:15.429 --> 03:19:15.439 align:start position:0%
Julie jurus and I will hand it in as
 
03:19:22.550 --> 03:19:22.560 align:start position:0%

homeless I will add to Ken Gordon's
 
03:19:42.710 --> 03:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
comments by simply saying that at amamos
 
03:19:46.189 --> 03:19:46.199 align:start position:0%
they serve 60,000 adults that Medicaid
 
03:19:47.950 --> 03:19:47.960 align:start position:0%
is thear largest source of their patient
 
03:19:52.030 --> 03:19:52.040 align:start position:0%
Revenue with 57% medical and 61% of
 
03:19:54.189 --> 03:19:54.199 align:start position:0%
their Mental Health visits being covered
 
03:19:57.550 --> 03:19:57.560 align:start position:0%
in the last fiscal year 76% of these
 
03:20:00.030 --> 03:20:00.040 align:start position:0%
individuals are below 200% of the
 
03:20:02.510 --> 03:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
federal poverty level health care for

49% of which are are supported by
 
03:20:13.150 --> 03:20:13.160 align:start position:0%

03:20:16.229 --> 03:20:16.239 align:start position:0%
below 200% of the federal poverty level
 
03:20:17.710 --> 03:20:17.720 align:start position:0%
kend did a great job already of
 
03:20:20.750 --> 03:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
illustrating the impact of what happens
 
03:20:22.910 --> 03:20:22.920 align:start position:0%
if we look at one portion of our Health
 
03:20:25.469 --> 03:20:25.479 align:start position:0%
Care system and don't look at it in a
 
03:20:28.349 --> 03:20:28.359 align:start position:0%
sort of well-rounded view um and and
 
03:20:30.150 --> 03:20:30.160 align:start position:0%
looking at these two particular
 
03:20:32.309 --> 03:20:32.319 align:start position:0%
organizations being at sort of that
 
03:20:35.309 --> 03:20:35.319 align:start position:0%
first layer if you will of immediate
 
03:20:38.309 --> 03:20:38.319 align:start position:0%

03:20:39.790 --> 03:20:39.800 align:start position:0%
the community in Manchester you heard
 
03:20:42.510 --> 03:20:42.520 align:start position:0%
about the North Country um same applies
 
03:20:44.830 --> 03:20:44.840 align:start position:0%
for what Ken had to say but more for the
 
03:20:46.870 --> 03:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
southern part of the state the ripples
 
03:20:49.510 --> 03:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
that we would experience if these Cuts
 
03:20:52.429 --> 03:20:52.439 align:start position:0%
were made um would create the same kinds
 
03:20:54.590 --> 03:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
of ripples that he talked about um
 
03:20:56.710 --> 03:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
including placements for rehabilitation
 
03:20:59.110 --> 03:20:59.120 align:start position:0%

03:21:24.710 --> 03:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's community health centers
 
03:21:27.910 --> 03:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
they serve over a 100,000 people and as
 
03:21:30.269 --> 03:21:30.279 align:start position:0%
you've heard from two earlier speakers
 
03:21:32.870 --> 03:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
most of their patients live at 200% of
 
03:21:35.150 --> 03:21:35.160 align:start position:0%
the federal poverty level or below
 
03:21:37.309 --> 03:21:37.319 align:start position:0%
that's about
 
03:21:40.950 --> 03:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
$30,000 the health centers take all
 
03:21:42.710 --> 03:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
patients regardless of their ability to
 
03:21:45.469 --> 03:21:45.479 align:start position:0%
pay or Insurance status they cannot turn
 
03:21:47.830 --> 03:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
patients away if they lose their
 
03:21:50.389 --> 03:21:50.399 align:start position:0%
insurance if there were changes made to
 
03:21:52.389 --> 03:21:52.399 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid Program in the state of New
 
03:21:54.429 --> 03:21:54.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have studies that show that
 
03:21:56.030 --> 03:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
the health centers would increase their
 
03:21:59.630 --> 03:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
uncompensated Care by about $35 million
 
03:22:02.670 --> 03:22:02.680 align:start position:0%
there's only 10 of them that's a lot of
 
03:22:05.389 --> 03:22:05.399 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care for 10 organizations
 
03:22:09.309 --> 03:22:09.319 align:start position:0%
to absorb in 2023 even with granted
 
03:22:12.710 --> 03:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
Advantage they had $14.5 million of
 
03:22:16.269 --> 03:22:16.279 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care our safety net system
 
03:22:20.030 --> 03:22:20.040 align:start position:0%
can cannot afford for the legislature to
 
03:22:22.269 --> 03:22:22.279 align:start position:0%
reduce Medicaid Eligibility at this
 
03:22:25.309 --> 03:22:25.319 align:start position:0%
point if you remember back before we had
 
03:22:27.269 --> 03:22:27.279 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion what the substance
 
03:22:29.630 --> 03:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
use disorder treatment Network looked
 
03:22:32.229 --> 03:22:32.239 align:start position:0%
like it was non-existent and it is
 
03:22:35.070 --> 03:22:35.080 align:start position:0%
because of granted advantage that our
 
03:22:37.550 --> 03:22:37.560 align:start position:0%
residents in New Hampshire have access
 
03:22:40.630 --> 03:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
to substance use disorder treatment what
 
03:22:43.150 --> 03:22:43.160 align:start position:0%
will they do if they can't access
 
03:22:46.110 --> 03:22:46.120 align:start position:0%
treatment where will they go the fqhcs
 
03:22:48.710 --> 03:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
would have to shut down their services
 
03:22:50.670 --> 03:22:50.680 align:start position:0%
just to give you a recent example one of
 
03:22:53.950 --> 03:22:53.960 align:start position:0%
our health centers had to stop providing
 
03:22:57.870 --> 03:22:57.880 align:start position:0%
as much mat because Medicaid medicated
 
03:23:00.990 --> 03:23:01.000 align:start position:0%
medicated assisted treatment because the
 
03:23:03.790 --> 03:23:03.800 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for mat is substantially
 
03:23:07.309 --> 03:23:07.319 align:start position:0%
lower than primary care that's not the
 
03:23:09.150 --> 03:23:09.160 align:start position:0%
outcome that we want to have but that's
 
03:23:12.590 --> 03:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
a reality as a business that they face
 
03:23:15.429 --> 03:23:15.439 align:start position:0%
we ask that you please not reduce the
 
03:23:18.070 --> 03:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
Medicaid ibility for any of the Medicaid
 
03:23:21.030 --> 03:23:21.040 align:start position:0%

committee members for for your patience
 
03:23:49.229 --> 03:23:49.239 align:start position:0%
and listening uh my name is David
 
03:23:51.389 --> 03:23:51.399 align:start position:0%
Trumble I'm from the town of wear I'd
 
03:23:52.830 --> 03:23:52.840 align:start position:0%
like to bring a few points for your
 
03:23:55.910 --> 03:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
consideration first is New Hampshire is
 
03:23:59.030 --> 03:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
ranked 48th in the United States for our
 
03:24:01.309 --> 03:24:01.319 align:start position:0%
state economy we have one of the three
 
03:24:04.389 --> 03:24:04.399 align:start position:0%
worst economies in the entire country
 
03:24:06.870 --> 03:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
that's from the CNBC annual ranking of
 
03:24:10.590 --> 03:24:10.600 align:start position:0%
the states why are we so bad it's
 
03:24:12.710 --> 03:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
because we don't invest in our people
 
03:24:14.790 --> 03:24:14.800 align:start position:0%
they specifically cited housing and
 
03:24:17.550 --> 03:24:17.560 align:start position:0%
child care in their stud
 
03:24:19.710 --> 03:24:19.720 align:start position:0%
we can't fix the housing crisis through
 
03:24:21.870 --> 03:24:21.880 align:start position:0%
regulatory reform alone it's going to
 
03:24:23.830 --> 03:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
require funding to make the housing
 
03:24:25.469 --> 03:24:25.479 align:start position:0%
Supply go up it's going to require
 
03:24:27.309 --> 03:24:27.319 align:start position:0%
funding to make it more affordable and
 
03:24:28.830 --> 03:24:28.840 align:start position:0%
we have to have a real solution to the
 
03:24:31.309 --> 03:24:31.319 align:start position:0%
homelessness crisis homelessness went up
 
03:24:34.750 --> 03:24:34.760 align:start position:0%
over 40% this past year alone and to not
 
03:24:37.189 --> 03:24:37.199 align:start position:0%
do anything about that is unconscionable
 
03:24:39.630 --> 03:24:39.640 align:start position:0%
also they talked about child care we
 
03:24:41.950 --> 03:24:41.960 align:start position:0%
need to have more people we you heard
 
03:24:44.269 --> 03:24:44.279 align:start position:0%
about training and retention we need
 
03:24:46.790 --> 03:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
bigger Longer hours so families can
 
03:24:48.830 --> 03:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
access child care and we need to expand
 
03:24:50.710 --> 03:24:50.720 align:start position:0%
the scholarship program that means
 
03:24:52.950 --> 03:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
changing our mindset as a state from
 
03:24:55.110 --> 03:24:55.120 align:start position:0%
every dollar we spend being a dollar
 
03:24:57.349 --> 03:24:57.359 align:start position:0%
that's gone to being a dollar that we
 
03:25:00.590 --> 03:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
invest in our people I'd like to turn to
 
03:25:02.150 --> 03:25:02.160 align:start position:0%
Public Schools I'll try and say
 
03:25:04.030 --> 03:25:04.040 align:start position:0%
something different from previous
 
03:25:06.710 --> 03:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
speakers education research shows that
 
03:25:10.349 --> 03:25:10.359 align:start position:0%
funding Public Schools it pays it
 
03:25:12.990 --> 03:25:13.000 align:start position:0%
increases lifetime earnings it decreases
 
03:25:15.229 --> 03:25:15.239 align:start position:0%
adult poverty Professor Jackson from
 
03:25:17.469 --> 03:25:17.479 align:start position:0%
Northwestern University University is a
 
03:25:18.950 --> 03:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
expert in the field who's looked at
 
03:25:21.990 --> 03:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
dozens of studies he says that a 10%
 
03:25:24.510 --> 03:25:24.520 align:start position:0%
increase in per pupil spending can
 
03:25:27.630 --> 03:25:27.640 align:start position:0%
result in a 99.5% increase in earnings
 
03:25:30.990 --> 03:25:31.000 align:start position:0%
that's lifetime a 6.8% reduction in
 
03:25:33.910 --> 03:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
adult poverty that's 10% so if you have
 
03:25:36.590 --> 03:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
a town that's not funding a lot let's
 
03:25:39.150 --> 03:25:39.160 align:start position:0%
say 15,000 per pupil if you give them
 
03:25:42.630 --> 03:25:42.640 align:start position:0%
1,500 more you take a lot of people out
 
03:25:44.790 --> 03:25:44.800 align:start position:0%
of poverty you reverse that cycle of
 
03:25:47.030 --> 03:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
poverty you lift that town up he goes on
 
03:25:49.990 --> 03:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
to say that a 25% increase is
 
03:25:52.550 --> 03:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
sufficiently large to eliminate the
 
03:25:54.309 --> 03:25:54.319 align:start position:0%
attainment gaps between children from
 
03:25:56.429 --> 03:25:56.439 align:start position:0%
low and high income families so for a
 
03:25:58.870 --> 03:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
few thousand dollar you can make every
 
03:26:01.790 --> 03:26:01.800 align:start position:0%
town in this state have good schools
 
03:26:04.150 --> 03:26:04.160 align:start position:0%
next is special education the governor's
 
03:26:06.469 --> 03:26:06.479 align:start position:0%
got a lot of positive praise for
 
03:26:08.670 --> 03:26:08.680 align:start position:0%
increasing special ed funding but in the
 
03:26:11.030 --> 03:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
big picture think about a pizzapi the
 
03:26:12.870 --> 03:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
state share is going from
 
03:26:17.030 --> 03:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
11% to 12% the local towns are still
 
03:26:20.349 --> 03:26:20.359 align:start position:0%
going to be paying 81% instead of 82% it
 
03:26:23.670 --> 03:26:23.680 align:start position:0%
barely budges the needle it is your job
 
03:26:25.870 --> 03:26:25.880 align:start position:0%
constitutionally to fend fund all of
 
03:26:29.510 --> 03:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
that not 11% or 12% lastly is where do
 
03:26:31.269 --> 03:26:31.279 align:start position:0%
you get the money from New Hampshire's
 
03:26:33.429 --> 03:26:33.439 align:start position:0%
tax system is highly regressive The
 
03:26:35.750 --> 03:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
Institute on tax and economic policy
 
03:26:37.429 --> 03:26:37.439 align:start position:0%
shows that low-income people in the
 
03:26:39.990 --> 03:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
state pay three times as much as a
 
03:26:41.750 --> 03:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
percentage of their income as wealthy
 
03:26:44.269 --> 03:26:44.279 align:start position:0%
people and if you put that 5% income tax
 
03:26:46.670 --> 03:26:46.680 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid payments they'll be paying
 
03:26:49.189 --> 03:26:49.199 align:start position:0%
14% of their income in taxes in the
 
03:26:50.750 --> 03:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
state while the wealthy get away with
 
03:26:52.910 --> 03:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
paying 3 or 4% the question you should
 
03:26:55.110 --> 03:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
be asking yourself is what does a fair
 
03:26:57.429 --> 03:26:57.439 align:start position:0%
tax system look like how can we raise
 
03:26:59.750 --> 03:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
this tax system which is so regressive
 
03:27:01.429 --> 03:27:01.439 align:start position:0%
right now and have it be a little more
 
03:27:03.830 --> 03:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
balanced so that everybody can get the
 
03:27:05.469 --> 03:27:05.479 align:start position:0%
services that they need so that we
 
03:27:07.389 --> 03:27:07.399 align:start position:0%
invest in our state and our tax system
 
03:27:14.070 --> 03:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:18.469 --> 03:27:18.479 align:start position:0%

our members um along with
 
03:28:20.429 --> 03:28:20.439 align:start position:0%
my my testimony for years New Hampshire
 
03:28:23.030 --> 03:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
has been facing a mental health crisis
 
03:28:26.150 --> 03:28:26.160 align:start position:0%
one in five adults and one in five youth
 
03:28:29.910 --> 03:28:29.920 align:start position:0%
age 6 to 17 experience a mental illness
 
03:28:33.510 --> 03:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
each year in New Hampshire that's 20% of
 
03:28:37.510 --> 03:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
our population aged six
 
03:28:42.469 --> 03:28:42.479 align:start position:0%
to 90 100 um experience a mental health
 
03:28:45.229 --> 03:28:45.239 align:start position:0%
issue every single year the most visible
 
03:28:47.950 --> 03:28:47.960 align:start position:0%
symptom of this crisis is emergency room
 
03:28:50.790 --> 03:28:50.800 align:start position:0%
boarding of individuals in Mental Health
 
03:28:52.750 --> 03:28:52.760 align:start position:0%
crisis while waiting for an impatient
 
03:28:55.910 --> 03:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
bed yesterday 31 adults and three
 
03:28:58.630 --> 03:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
children were waiting for a psychiatric
 
03:29:01.389 --> 03:29:01.399 align:start position:0%
impatient admission at a New Hampshire
 
03:29:03.590 --> 03:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
ER somewhere in the state and I just
 
03:29:05.150 --> 03:29:05.160 align:start position:0%
checked the numbers as I was sitting
 
03:29:08.510 --> 03:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
here and now it is 35 adults and five
 
03:29:10.870 --> 03:29:10.880 align:start position:0%
children that are waiting
 
03:29:13.269 --> 03:29:13.279 align:start position:0%
today the mission zero initiative has
 
03:29:15.309 --> 03:29:15.319 align:start position:0%
helped address the ER boarding crisis
 
03:29:17.830 --> 03:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
however despite the steady progress of
 
03:29:20.349 --> 03:29:20.359 align:start position:0%
the initiative more needs to be done to
 
03:29:22.510 --> 03:29:22.520 align:start position:0%
ensure we're able to get to zero and
 
03:29:24.070 --> 03:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
stay at
 
03:29:26.750 --> 03:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
zero a couple of the root causes of the
 
03:29:28.150 --> 03:29:28.160 align:start position:0%
Mental Health crisis that you've heard
 
03:29:29.830 --> 03:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
about today so I won't get into a lot
 
03:29:32.189 --> 03:29:32.199 align:start position:0%
are the workforce issue and the housing
 
03:29:35.030 --> 03:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
crisis that we're um facing both
 
03:29:37.670 --> 03:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing and additionally we
 
03:29:39.910 --> 03:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
need Supportive Housing including step
 
03:29:42.110 --> 03:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
up and step down units to support folks
 
03:29:44.389 --> 03:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
with mental illness who are unable to
 
03:29:46.710 --> 03:29:46.720 align:start position:0%
live alone on any any given day there
 
03:29:49.150 --> 03:29:49.160 align:start position:0%
are 50 to 60 people ready to leave New
 
03:29:51.189 --> 03:29:51.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital but are not able to
 
03:29:54.550 --> 03:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
do so because they have no place to go
 
03:29:56.990 --> 03:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
having Supportive Housing would assist
 
03:29:59.189 --> 03:29:59.199 align:start position:0%
addressing this backdoor issue so that
 
03:30:01.469 --> 03:30:01.479 align:start position:0%
we can get people out of the ER and into
 
03:30:03.910 --> 03:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
psychiatric placements that they so
 
03:30:06.469 --> 03:30:06.479 align:start position:0%
desperately need additionally robust
 
03:30:08.870 --> 03:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
investments in Community Resources such
 
03:30:11.510 --> 03:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
as the children's system of care 988 in
 
03:30:13.670 --> 03:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
the crisis service system intensive
 
03:30:16.590 --> 03:30:16.600 align:start position:0%
reent re-entry services Community Mental
 
03:30:18.910 --> 03:30:18.920 align:start position:0%
Health Centers and the goals of the 10
 
03:30:21.389 --> 03:30:21.399 align:start position:0%
mental 10-year Mental Health Plan are
 
03:30:23.070 --> 03:30:23.080 align:start position:0%
essential to supporting people in our
 
03:30:25.910 --> 03:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
communities in avoiding crisis and I
 
03:30:27.550 --> 03:30:27.560 align:start position:0%
know you have heard about it a couple of
 
03:30:30.550 --> 03:30:30.560 align:start position:0%
times but I would be remiss if I did not
 
03:30:34.870 --> 03:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
mention that um the proposed changes to
 
03:30:37.110 --> 03:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
Med to the Medicaid Program that include
 
03:30:39.030 --> 03:30:39.040 align:start position:0%
instituting premiums on certain
 
03:30:41.670 --> 03:30:41.680 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries and increasing co-payments
 
03:30:44.309 --> 03:30:44.319 align:start position:0%
for medications would be detrimental to
 
03:30:46.710 --> 03:30:46.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's uh citizen
 
03:30:48.990 --> 03:30:49.000 align:start position:0%
the changes suggested will only lead to
 
03:30:51.550 --> 03:30:51.560 align:start position:0%
decreases in coverage for both adults
 
03:30:53.990 --> 03:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
and children interruptions in treatment
 
03:30:55.830 --> 03:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
increases in health care costs and
 
03:30:59.030 --> 03:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
worsening of the Mental Health crisis in
 
03:31:01.030 --> 03:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
summary it's imperative that house
 
03:31:03.229 --> 03:31:03.239 align:start position:0%
finance builds a budget that fully
 
03:31:04.990 --> 03:31:05.000 align:start position:0%
addresses the Mental Health crisis we
 
03:31:07.630 --> 03:31:07.640 align:start position:0%
are currently in and uses Extreme
 
03:31:09.950 --> 03:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
Caution when considering changes to the
 
03:31:12.150 --> 03:31:12.160 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program that include increased
 
03:31:14.229 --> 03:31:14.239 align:start position:0%
cost sharing for our beneficiaries thank

take what we can get um we've heard a
 
03:33:09.429 --> 03:33:09.439 align:start position:0%
lot of stories today so I won't tell any

03:33:15.790 --> 03:33:15.800 align:start position:0%
I need a Workforce and I can't deliver
 
03:33:18.229 --> 03:33:18.239 align:start position:0%

03:33:22.189 --> 03:33:22.199 align:start position:0%
without employees and so please pass hb1

efforts that are put before the
 
03:33:30.469 --> 03:33:30.479 align:start position:0%
legislature for increasing funding for
 
03:33:33.110 --> 03:33:33.120 align:start position:0%

to I see the governor's budget is
 
03:34:11.910 --> 03:34:11.920 align:start position:0%
placing a lot of faith in the growth of
 
03:34:14.030 --> 03:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire business and while I
 
03:34:16.510 --> 03:34:16.520 align:start position:0%
certainly hope she's right the headlines
 
03:34:18.429 --> 03:34:18.439 align:start position:0%
that I see in the national news suggest
 
03:34:20.950 --> 03:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
many coming headwinds over which we have
 
03:34:24.189 --> 03:34:24.199 align:start position:0%
little or no State Control regarding the

agency with under 15 employees in lonia
 
03:37:28.790 --> 03:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
I'm here to speak about the importance
 
03:37:30.990 --> 03:37:31.000 align:start position:0%
of appropriate funding for home and
 
03:37:32.510 --> 03:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
communitybased services that are
 
03:37:34.750 --> 03:37:34.760 align:start position:0%
essential for those we serve and is most
 
03:37:37.670 --> 03:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
financially responsible uh for
 
03:37:40.389 --> 03:37:40.399 align:start position:0%
investment by the state uh over the last
 
03:37:42.229 --> 03:37:42.239 align:start position:0%
budget cycle State funding has allowed
 
03:37:44.150 --> 03:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
us to make a meaningful impact the
 
03:37:45.510 --> 03:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
congregate housing service progam
 
03:37:48.030 --> 03:37:48.040 align:start position:0%
program chsp which is funded through
 
03:37:50.389 --> 03:37:50.399 align:start position:0%
General funds enabled us to serve 36
 
03:37:53.269 --> 03:37:53.279 align:start position:0%
additional individuals providing 3600
 
03:37:55.309 --> 03:37:55.319 align:start position:0%

03:37:57.189 --> 03:37:57.199 align:start position:0%
vulnerable individuals to remain safely
 
03:38:00.269 --> 03:38:00.279 align:start position:0%
home safely at home prevented at least
 
03:38:01.910 --> 03:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
three individuals from requiring nursing
 
03:38:04.269 --> 03:38:04.279 align:start position:0%

$210,000 for the State uh verted at
 
03:38:09.229 --> 03:38:09.239 align:start position:0%
least seven ER visits and Hospital
 
03:38:11.550 --> 03:38:11.560 align:start position:0%
admissions saving around
 
03:38:13.910 --> 03:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
$56,000 provided a crucial safety net
 
03:38:16.670 --> 03:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
for those who lost CFI eligibility or
 
03:38:18.590 --> 03:38:18.600 align:start position:0%
needed a bridge while waiting for
 
03:38:20.309 --> 03:38:20.319 align:start position:0%

Independence program CFI allowed us to
 
03:38:26.349 --> 03:38:26.359 align:start position:0%
serve 47 individuals ensuring they could
 
03:38:28.070 --> 03:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
remain in their homes rather than enter

Emergency Medical Service Services which
 
03:38:35.910 --> 03:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
is facing an unprecedented burden in our
 
03:38:38.750 --> 03:38:38.760 align:start position:0%

03:38:54.590 --> 03:38:54.600 align:start position:0%
person additionally both programs have
 
03:38:56.229 --> 03:38:56.239 align:start position:0%
helped keep individuals independently

housed and prevent uh prevented

evictions which translates into
 
03:39:02.469 --> 03:39:02.479 align:start position:0%
significant cost savings for the state
 
03:39:04.229 --> 03:39:04.239 align:start position:0%
particularly among those in subsidized

options once evicted they face a high
 
03:39:22.670 --> 03:39:22.680 align:start position:0%
risk of homelessness or institutional

Financial consequences for the state
 
03:39:29.590 --> 03:39:29.600 align:start position:0%
homelessness costs an estimated $30,000

per person nursing home care as
 
03:39:34.469 --> 03:39:34.479 align:start position:0%
mentioned costs around $70,000 per
 
03:39:36.990 --> 03:39:37.000 align:start position:0%
person to maintain these vital programs
 
03:39:39.710 --> 03:39:39.720 align:start position:0%
we request the continuation of the chsp
 
03:39:41.750 --> 03:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
fund funding through General funds at
 
03:39:44.790 --> 03:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
approximately $400,000 per provider this
 
03:39:46.510 --> 03:39:46.520 align:start position:0%
program has been removed from the budget
 
03:39:49.110 --> 03:39:49.120 align:start position:0%
it is set to end in June of this year
 
03:39:53.070 --> 03:39:53.080 align:start position:0%
leaving 27 plus individuals without care
 
03:39:55.150 --> 03:39:55.160 align:start position:0%
we are only one of two providers in New
 
03:39:57.750 --> 03:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire offering chsp Services
 
03:40:00.309 --> 03:40:00.319 align:start position:0%
alongside Manchester housing authority
 
03:40:02.269 --> 03:40:02.279 align:start position:0%
this program provides at least a 2:1
 
03:40:03.510 --> 03:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
return on
 
03:40:06.389 --> 03:40:06.399 align:start position:0%
investments realistically closer to 4:1
 
03:40:08.389 --> 03:40:08.399 align:start position:0%
I gave a conservative estimate on the
 
03:40:11.990 --> 03:40:12.000 align:start position:0%

Federation for college Republicans uh I
 
03:41:46.710 --> 03:41:46.720 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make my kind of testimony
 
03:41:48.030 --> 03:41:48.040 align:start position:0%
heard that I've never felt any
 
03:41:50.349 --> 03:41:50.359 align:start position:0%
alienation from my professors uh based
 
03:41:51.870 --> 03:41:51.880 align:start position:0%
off my conservative beliefs and trust me
 
03:41:53.630 --> 03:41:53.640 align:start position:0%
they've had every opportunity to do so
 
03:41:55.790 --> 03:41:55.800 align:start position:0%
because I've had two public debates and
 
03:41:58.030 --> 03:41:58.040 align:start position:0%
I've very much fiercely defended my
 
03:42:00.910 --> 03:42:00.920 align:start position:0%
conservative values um I am speaking
 
03:42:03.389 --> 03:42:03.399 align:start position:0%
today uh on the $16 million cut to the
 
03:42:06.110 --> 03:42:06.120 align:start position:0%
university system uh which has placed
 
03:42:08.750 --> 03:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
both of my majors in Jeopardy uh may I
 
03:42:10.710 --> 03:42:10.720 align:start position:0%

03:42:12.710 --> 03:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
of life I am born and Brad in New
 
03:42:14.349 --> 03:42:14.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm so proud to be
 
03:42:16.070 --> 03:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
standing in the capital the free estate
 
03:42:17.149 --> 03:42:17.159 align:start position:0%
in the
 
03:42:19.750 --> 03:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
country that being said since I love my
 
03:42:22.189 --> 03:42:22.199 align:start position:0%
state I want people to stay in my state
 
03:42:24.389 --> 03:42:24.399 align:start position:0%
and continue to grow our
 
03:42:27.630 --> 03:42:27.640 align:start position:0%
state um therefore I believe the state
 
03:42:30.630 --> 03:42:30.640 align:start position:0%
should fund and invest our universities
 
03:42:33.870 --> 03:42:33.880 align:start position:0%
PSU is the lifeline uh for educated
 
03:42:35.790 --> 03:42:35.800 align:start position:0%
Workforce in the North country as
 
03:42:37.269 --> 03:42:37.279 align:start position:0%
students fall in love with the northern
 
03:42:39.189 --> 03:42:39.199 align:start position:0%
part of the of the state and wish to
 
03:42:40.750 --> 03:42:40.760 align:start position:0%
stay in New Hampshire for jobs and a
 
03:42:42.149 --> 03:42:42.159 align:start position:0%
wonderful way of
 
03:42:45.550 --> 03:42:45.560 align:start position:0%
life I believe that placing more funding
 
03:42:48.229 --> 03:42:48.239 align:start position:0%
into our universities will promote the
 
03:42:51.229 --> 03:42:51.239 align:start position:0%
student revenue and uh potential
 
03:42:52.750 --> 03:42:52.760 align:start position:0%

03:42:57.950 --> 03:42:57.960 align:start position:0%

uh Public School Educators across the
 
03:43:13.030 --> 03:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
state um I'll boil try and boil my
 
03:43:14.830 --> 03:43:14.840 align:start position:0%
testimony down from what has already
 
03:43:18.950 --> 03:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
been said but first I'd like to say the
 
03:43:20.790 --> 03:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
there's a cautionary tale out there from
 
03:43:23.070 --> 03:43:23.080 align:start position:0%
all the states that have expanded um
 
03:43:24.830 --> 03:43:24.840 align:start position:0%
their voucher programs and you have
 
03:43:28.389 --> 03:43:28.399 align:start position:0%
heard a lot of very important needs from
 
03:43:32.429 --> 03:43:32.439 align:start position:0%
the people in this audience today and so
 
03:43:34.389 --> 03:43:34.399 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we know in in
 
03:43:36.269 --> 03:43:36.279 align:start position:0%
education from those States who have
 
03:43:38.309 --> 03:43:38.319 align:start position:0%
expanded those programs
 
03:43:41.269 --> 03:43:41.279 align:start position:0%
significantly is that uh the effort to
 
03:43:45.550 --> 03:43:45.560 align:start position:0%
fund Public Schools uh for who serve the
 
03:43:48.070 --> 03:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
significant majority of our students has
 
03:43:51.870 --> 03:43:51.880 align:start position:0%
declined in those States um Arizona
 
03:43:54.269 --> 03:43:54.279 align:start position:0%
obviously is a great example now costing
 
03:43:56.030 --> 03:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
over a billion dollars a year since they
 
03:43:58.269 --> 03:43:58.279 align:start position:0%
have thrown the doors open on that
 
03:44:01.670 --> 03:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
program our program as it is already
 
03:44:04.790 --> 03:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
just under current law would be $41
 
03:44:08.229 --> 03:44:08.239 align:start position:0%
million per year by the time uh we hit
 
03:44:12.790 --> 03:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
FY 27 we also know that uh in places
 
03:44:16.830 --> 03:44:16.840 align:start position:0%
like Arizona Florida consistent ly um
 
03:44:19.149 --> 03:44:19.159 align:start position:0%
those the people who are using those
 
03:44:22.149 --> 03:44:22.159 align:start position:0%
were already in private schools or other
 
03:44:24.389 --> 03:44:24.399 align:start position:0%
settings and were on the wealthier end
 
03:44:27.030 --> 03:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
of the spectrum um in some schools in
 
03:44:30.630 --> 03:44:30.640 align:start position:0%
Florida you're talking about 98% of
 
03:44:33.630 --> 03:44:33.640 align:start position:0%
those counties where in private schools
 
03:44:39.070 --> 03:44:39.080 align:start position:0%
are using uh Florida vouchers um so uh
 
03:44:41.110 --> 03:44:41.120 align:start position:0%

Jennifer kudi and I live in marac with
 
03:50:59.950 --> 03:50:59.960 align:start position:0%
Christine I'm here to request increased
 
03:51:02.030 --> 03:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
funding for the Bureau of Developmental
 
03:51:04.990 --> 03:51:05.000 align:start position:0%
services to attract qualified direct
 
03:51:08.110 --> 03:51:08.120 align:start position:0%
support professionals or dsps and respit
 
03:51:10.590 --> 03:51:10.600 align:start position:0%
care providers two years ago after my
 
03:51:12.670 --> 03:51:12.680 align:start position:0%
mother-in-law passed away my husband and
 
03:51:15.030 --> 03:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
I became guardians of Christine who was
 
03:51:17.750 --> 03:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
intellectually disabled I was excited to
 
03:51:20.070 --> 03:51:20.080 align:start position:0%
get her re-engaged in the community but
 
03:51:21.990 --> 03:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
quickly discovered a critical shortage
 
03:51:25.790 --> 03:51:25.800 align:start position:0%
of dsps stories of neglect like dsps
 
03:51:28.469 --> 03:51:28.479 align:start position:0%
taking Christine to their home to nap
 
03:51:30.710 --> 03:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
showed how vital it is to have caring
 
03:51:33.550 --> 03:51:33.560 align:start position:0%
professional support this is something
 
03:51:35.189 --> 03:51:35.199 align:start position:0%
that we do not want Christine to
 
03:51:38.189 --> 03:51:38.199 align:start position:0%
experience again or anybody else to
 
03:51:40.030 --> 03:51:40.040 align:start position:0%
ensure Christine's progress I had to
 
03:51:42.269 --> 03:51:42.279 align:start position:0%
leave my 17-year career as a par
 
03:51:45.469 --> 03:51:45.479 align:start position:0%
educator to become her full-time care
 
03:51:47.670 --> 03:51:47.680 align:start position:0%
initially I thought this was temporary
 
03:51:49.830 --> 03:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
but the lack of staffing has made me her
 
03:51:53.070 --> 03:51:53.080 align:start position:0%
best and at this point only option as a
 
03:51:55.429 --> 03:51:55.439 align:start position:0%
small business owner I am torn between
 
03:51:57.349 --> 03:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
giving Christine what she needs and what
 
03:52:00.229 --> 03:52:00.239 align:start position:0%
she deserves and what our business needs
 
03:52:02.309 --> 03:52:02.319 align:start position:0%
to be able to be successful so we may
 
03:52:05.469 --> 03:52:05.479 align:start position:0%
continue to provide things for Christine
 
03:52:06.950 --> 03:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
Christine thrives in activities like
 
03:52:08.830 --> 03:52:08.840 align:start position:0%
horseback riding Special Olympics
 
03:52:10.910 --> 03:52:10.920 align:start position:0%
basketball and her classes at Community
 
03:52:13.389 --> 03:52:13.399 align:start position:0%
integrated services in Manchester but
 
03:52:15.189 --> 03:52:15.199 align:start position:0%
without more funding to to attract and
 
03:52:18.469 --> 03:52:18.479 align:start position:0%
retain dsps I worry about her future who
 
03:52:20.189 --> 03:52:20.199 align:start position:0%
will care for her when I am no longer
 
03:52:22.790 --> 03:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
able will my daughter have to sacrifice
 
03:52:25.870 --> 03:52:25.880 align:start position:0%
her career in order to step in I urge
 
03:52:28.750 --> 03:52:28.760 align:start position:0%
you to prioritize funding for dsps so
 
03:52:31.309 --> 03:52:31.319 align:start position:0%
families like mine and others that were
 
03:52:33.830 --> 03:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
here um do not have to give up
 
03:52:35.750 --> 03:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
everything to ensure that our loved ones
 
03:52:38.590 --> 03:52:38.600 align:start position:0%

Justice organization and we fight for
 
03:53:05.790 --> 03:53:05.800 align:start position:0%
the civil and human rights of people
 
03:53:07.910 --> 03:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
with disabilities in New Hampshire let
 
03:53:11.189 --> 03:53:11.199 align:start position:0%
me be absolutely clear this proposal to
 
03:53:14.550 --> 03:53:14.560 align:start position:0%
impose premiums on Medicaid is not just
 
03:53:16.269 --> 03:53:16.279 align:start position:0%
acceptable it is
 
03:53:19.149 --> 03:53:19.159 align:start position:0%
cruel it is an attack on the very people
 
03:53:21.910 --> 03:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
our government is supposed to protect
 
03:53:24.510 --> 03:53:24.520 align:start position:0%
Medicaid is not a handout it is not a
 
03:53:28.070 --> 03:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
luxury it is survival it keeps people
 
03:53:30.149 --> 03:53:30.159 align:start position:0%
with disabilities in their homes in
 
03:53:32.870 --> 03:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
their communities and out of Crisis it
 
03:53:34.990 --> 03:53:35.000 align:start position:0%
is the difference between dignity and
 
03:53:38.229 --> 03:53:38.239 align:start position:0%
despair and between life and death and
 
03:53:40.389 --> 03:53:40.399 align:start position:0%
yet this committee is actually
 
03:53:43.550 --> 03:53:43.560 align:start position:0%
considering forcing the poorest sickest
 
03:53:46.110 --> 03:53:46.120 align:start position:0%
and most vulnerable among us to pay for
 
03:53:49.389 --> 03:53:49.399 align:start position:0%
the care they need just to stay
 
03:53:52.389 --> 03:53:52.399 align:start position:0%
alive let's call this what it is
 
03:53:54.070 --> 03:53:54.080 align:start position:0%
balancing the budget on the backs of
 
03:53:56.710 --> 03:53:56.720 align:start position:0%
people who have nowhere else to
 
03:53:59.189 --> 03:53:59.199 align:start position:0%
turn the people who rely on Medicaid
 
03:54:01.229 --> 03:54:01.239 align:start position:0%
already navigate a world full of
 
03:54:03.670 --> 03:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
barriers they fight every single day
 
03:54:06.750 --> 03:54:06.760 align:start position:0%
just to access basic health care to find
 
03:54:09.590 --> 03:54:09.600 align:start position:0%
housing to work against a system that is
 
03:54:12.510 --> 03:54:12.520 align:start position:0%
never built for them and now you want to
 
03:54:14.990 --> 03:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
make them fight harder to force
 
03:54:17.790 --> 03:54:17.800 align:start position:0%
impossible choices between rent food and
 
03:54:20.950 --> 03:54:20.960 align:start position:0%
life-saving care I urge you drop this
 
03:54:23.590 --> 03:54:23.600 align:start position:0%
plan do not be the legislators who chose
 
03:54:26.550 --> 03:54:26.560 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy over Humanity do not be the
 
03:54:28.670 --> 03:54:28.680 align:start position:0%
ones who decided that saving a few
 
03:54:31.429 --> 03:54:31.439 align:start position:0%
dollars mattered more than the lives of
 
03:54:35.710 --> 03:54:35.720 align:start position:0%
real people do better because this is
 
03:54:38.330 --> 03:54:38.340 align:start position:0%
shameful thank you

provider I am here today to tell you
 
03:57:01.910 --> 03:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
about the important impact the recent
 
03:57:04.309 --> 03:57:04.319 align:start position:0%
Workforce grant that we received in
 
03:57:07.229 --> 03:57:07.239 align:start position:0%
August has had on our community-based
 
03:57:10.070 --> 03:57:10.080 align:start position:0%
highquality Child Care Program the
 
03:57:13.110 --> 03:57:13.120 align:start position:0%
workforce Grant received in August has
 
03:57:15.710 --> 03:57:15.720 align:start position:0%
increased our ability to recruit and
 
03:57:18.469 --> 03:57:18.479 align:start position:0%
retain qualified Child Care teachers
 
03:57:20.389 --> 03:57:20.399 align:start position:0%
helping to maintain our child care
 
03:57:23.910 --> 03:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
program's ability to serve our community
 
03:57:25.870 --> 03:57:25.880 align:start position:0%
some of the actual results that this
 
03:57:29.309 --> 03:57:29.319 align:start position:0%
Workforce Grant gave us were low teacher
 
03:57:32.590 --> 03:57:32.600 align:start position:0%
turnover experienced and educated and
 
03:57:35.630 --> 03:57:35.640 align:start position:0%
enthused teachers our own agency's
 
03:57:37.550 --> 03:57:37.560 align:start position:0%
investment in teachers through wage
 
03:57:40.950 --> 03:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
increases and an unprecedented bonus
 
03:57:44.229 --> 03:57:44.239 align:start position:0%
award I am very concerned that without
 
03:57:47.309 --> 03:57:47.319 align:start position:0%
the restoration of the $15 million in
 
03:57:50.309 --> 03:57:50.319 align:start position:0%
the state budget to retain and recruit
 
03:57:52.469 --> 03:57:52.479 align:start position:0%
to recruit and retain rather um
 
03:57:54.630 --> 03:57:54.640 align:start position:0%
qualified teachers could force our
 
03:57:57.790 --> 03:57:57.800 align:start position:0%
program to revert to struggling in those
 
03:58:00.149 --> 03:58:00.159 align:start position:0%
areas this would cause our child care
 
03:58:02.110 --> 03:58:02.120 align:start position:0%
program's ability to serve our community
 
03:58:04.670 --> 03:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
to weaken and decrease
 
03:58:07.269 --> 03:58:07.279 align:start position:0%
significantly I thank you for listening

next good evening my name is Amy Upton
 
03:58:46.389 --> 03:58:46.399 align:start position:0%
and I'm I reside in bone New Hampshire
 
03:58:48.870 --> 03:58:48.880 align:start position:0%
and I'm here to talk to you about what
 
03:58:51.189 --> 03:58:51.199 align:start position:0%
I've been doing for the last 41 years
 
03:58:53.550 --> 03:58:53.560 align:start position:0%
and that is providing Child Care I've
 
03:58:55.510 --> 03:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
been a childcare director in conquered
 
03:58:59.389 --> 03:58:59.399 align:start position:0%
for 35 years I opened the program 35
 
03:59:01.710 --> 03:59:01.720 align:start position:0%
years ago with six children and I'm
 
03:59:04.750 --> 03:59:04.760 align:start position:0%
still there and now well there's 100 we
 
03:59:07.110 --> 03:59:07.120 align:start position:0%
are licensed for 185 there's a lot more
 
03:59:09.830 --> 03:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
than that that we serve and uh over
 
03:59:11.309 --> 03:59:11.319 align:start position:0%
those years I was trying to figure out
 
03:59:13.830 --> 03:59:13.840 align:start position:0%
how much my salary has changed and it's
 
03:59:15.510 --> 03:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
um a little bit too embarrassing to tell
 
03:59:18.670 --> 03:59:18.680 align:start position:0%
you and although it's been tiresome to
 
03:59:21.229 --> 03:59:21.239 align:start position:0%
wait here to talk to you um the good
 
03:59:22.830 --> 03:59:22.840 align:start position:0%
news is that I am not tired of providing
 
03:59:24.830 --> 03:59:24.840 align:start position:0%
Child Care I've been doing it for a long
 
03:59:26.550 --> 03:59:26.560 align:start position:0%
time and I am so thankful for the
 
03:59:28.510 --> 03:59:28.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity I look forward to Monday as
 
03:59:30.750 --> 03:59:30.760 align:start position:0%
much as I work forward to Friday as I
 
03:59:33.309 --> 03:59:33.319 align:start position:0%
look forward to Saturday and it is
 
03:59:36.389 --> 03:59:36.399 align:start position:0%
mindboggling to me that we would have
 
03:59:37.510 --> 03:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
the amount of money that we've had for
 
03:59:39.870 --> 03:59:39.880 align:start position:0%
the childcare Workforce 15 million to go
 
03:59:44.070 --> 03:59:44.080 align:start position:0%
from that to go to zero and I am
 
03:59:45.910 --> 03:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
imploring you to please
 
03:59:48.429 --> 03:59:48.439 align:start position:0%
continue providing money for the
 
03:59:49.990 --> 03:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
childcare Workforce just as I'm going to
 
03:59:53.269 --> 03:59:53.279 align:start position:0%
continue providing care for the children
 
03:59:54.389 --> 03:59:54.399 align:start position:0%
and families of conquered in the
 
03:59:58.149 --> 03:59:58.159 align:start position:0%
outlying areas um throughout the years I
 
03:59:59.710 --> 03:59:59.720 align:start position:0%
have gone from when I opened my program
 
04:00:01.630 --> 04:00:01.640 align:start position:0%
I had an associates degree I have a
 
04:00:03.750 --> 04:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
master's degree now my pay hasn't
 
04:00:04.990 --> 04:00:05.000 align:start position:0%
changed that much from when I had an
 
04:00:07.389 --> 04:00:07.399 align:start position:0%
associates degree to a master's degree
 
04:00:09.110 --> 04:00:09.120 align:start position:0%
and the reason why I got that degree was
 
04:00:11.630 --> 04:00:11.640 align:start position:0%
not necessarily to gain more knowledge
 
04:00:14.189 --> 04:00:14.199 align:start position:0%
which I certainly did um I've also
 
04:00:17.269 --> 04:00:17.279 align:start position:0%
taught at UNH at uh Plymouth State and
 
04:00:19.590 --> 04:00:19.600 align:start position:0%
20 years at nhti in conquer but the
 
04:00:20.990 --> 04:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
reason why I taught was I didn't have
 
04:00:22.189 --> 04:00:22.199 align:start position:0%
enough money to put my own children
 
04:00:23.590 --> 04:00:23.600 align:start position:0%
through college because of the amount of
 
04:00:25.750 --> 04:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
money that I made as a childcare worker
 
04:00:27.950 --> 04:00:27.960 align:start position:0%
so I taught College until my children
 
04:00:30.389 --> 04:00:30.399 align:start position:0%
were done going through college and
 
04:00:33.110 --> 04:00:33.120 align:start position:0%
happy to say that they are all grown and
 
04:00:35.710 --> 04:00:35.720 align:start position:0%
um serving our state of New Hampshire
 
04:00:39.070 --> 04:00:39.080 align:start position:0%
two of them so uh it's it's an important
 
04:00:40.389 --> 04:00:40.399 align:start position:0%
field like you've heard already from
 
04:00:42.950 --> 04:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
many of my colleagues and from the CPA
 
04:00:44.910 --> 04:00:44.920 align:start position:0%
that works at my program
 
04:00:47.429 --> 04:00:47.439 align:start position:0%
that took a huge job a huge pay cut to
 
04:00:50.030 --> 04:00:50.040 align:start position:0%
come and serve at East Side Learning
 
04:00:52.149 --> 04:00:52.159 align:start position:0%
Center and if that didn't happen after
 
04:00:54.870 --> 04:00:54.880 align:start position:0%
35 years my program probably wouldn't be
 
04:00:57.630 --> 04:00:57.640 align:start position:0%
existing because I am very good at
 
04:00:59.630 --> 04:00:59.640 align:start position:0%
managing children and managing staff I
 
04:01:01.550 --> 04:01:01.560 align:start position:0%
am not very good at managing money or
 
04:01:03.229 --> 04:01:03.239 align:start position:0%
knowing how to go out there and get it
 
04:01:05.070 --> 04:01:05.080 align:start position:0%
and I'm thankful that I have somebody
 
04:01:06.950 --> 04:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
that does know how to do that as you've
 
04:01:09.269 --> 04:01:09.279 align:start position:0%
heard a letter went out to our families
 
04:01:11.070 --> 04:01:11.080 align:start position:0%
um I think we've had over probably in
 
04:01:14.110 --> 04:01:14.120 align:start position:0%
the last week 150 emails of how how
 
04:01:15.750 --> 04:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
upset and distraught parents are that we
 
04:01:18.070 --> 04:01:18.080 align:start position:0%
raised our rates it was not that much
 
04:01:19.670 --> 04:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
and the only reason they were raised at
 
04:01:21.950 --> 04:01:21.960 align:start position:0%
all is because I had a CPA that could
 
04:01:24.309 --> 04:01:24.319 align:start position:0%
figure out how much money we had to have
 
04:01:25.990 --> 04:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
to continue to pay our staff the amount
 
04:01:29.149 --> 04:01:29.159 align:start position:0%
of money that they are making right now
 
04:01:30.990 --> 04:01:31.000 align:start position:0%
and still be able which we were able to
 
04:01:33.990 --> 04:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
do and give them slight raises due to
 
04:01:36.389 --> 04:01:36.399 align:start position:0%
the childware workforce Grant which now
 
04:01:38.070 --> 04:01:38.080 align:start position:0%
um we we don't have any you know we
 
04:01:39.590 --> 04:01:39.600 align:start position:0%
don't suddenly we can't go back and pay
 
04:01:42.630 --> 04:01:42.640 align:start position:0%
them less money so just to maintain our
 
04:01:45.469 --> 04:01:45.479 align:start position:0%
our staff that we have um the rates have
 
04:01:47.550 --> 04:01:47.560 align:start position:0%
had to increase for families and
 
04:01:49.349 --> 04:01:49.359 align:start position:0%
numerous changes made such as our
 
04:01:50.990 --> 04:01:51.000 align:start position:0%
availability for how much time we can
 
04:01:54.990 --> 04:01:55.000 align:start position:0%
offer due to Staffing so please continue
 
04:01:56.750 --> 04:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
providing money for the childcare
 
04:01:58.630 --> 04:01:58.640 align:start position:0%
Workforce so childcare workers can
 
04:02:04.349 --> 04:02:04.359 align:start position:0%

awake and alert um I've come here to
 
04:06:00.070 --> 04:06:00.080 align:start position:0%
respectfully suggest that you Recons the
 
04:06:02.189 --> 04:06:02.199 align:start position:0%
proposed budget especially with regards
 
04:06:04.149 --> 04:06:04.159 align:start position:0%
to steep Cuts in the Department of
 
04:06:06.070 --> 04:06:06.080 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services the Department
 
04:06:07.750 --> 04:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
of Behavioral Health and the Department
 
04:06:10.510 --> 04:06:10.520 align:start position:0%
of Child Protection uh taking a machete
 
04:06:12.429 --> 04:06:12.439 align:start position:0%
to these already underfunded Apartments
 
04:06:14.830 --> 04:06:14.840 align:start position:0%
will leave them lifeless and ineffective
 
04:06:16.550 --> 04:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
as I understand it the overall budget
 
04:06:19.269 --> 04:06:19.279 align:start position:0%
will increase R roughly 1% this year
 
04:06:21.309 --> 04:06:21.319 align:start position:0%
with the largest decreases of about 25
 
04:06:24.590 --> 04:06:24.600 align:start position:0%
to 30% among the A4 mentioned agencies
 
04:06:26.429 --> 04:06:26.439 align:start position:0%
the very agencies that are most
 
04:06:28.510 --> 04:06:28.520 align:start position:0%
necessary to protect disabled children
 
04:06:30.670 --> 04:06:30.680 align:start position:0%
and adults the most vulnerable people in
 
04:06:33.110 --> 04:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
our society I'm here to explain why
 
04:06:34.750 --> 04:06:34.760 align:start position:0%
these proposed Cuts would be a terrible
 
04:06:36.710 --> 04:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
idea and cause children and their
 
04:06:39.070 --> 04:06:39.080 align:start position:0%
families to suffer and even die if you
 
04:06:40.269 --> 04:06:40.279 align:start position:0%
don't believe me you'll have to enter
 
04:06:42.750 --> 04:06:42.760 align:start position:0%
into my world one of my two boys has
 
04:06:45.110 --> 04:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
autism and a sleep did when my wife when
 
04:06:47.790 --> 04:06:47.800 align:start position:0%
my son uh my disabled son lived at home
 
04:06:49.510 --> 04:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
I would have to tag team with my wife to
 
04:06:51.269 --> 04:06:51.279 align:start position:0%
stay up awake all night to make sure
 
04:06:53.030 --> 04:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
that he didn't flood the house or burn
 
04:06:55.389 --> 04:06:55.399 align:start position:0%
it down or egress and wander through the
 
04:06:57.389 --> 04:06:57.399 align:start position:0%
neighborhood uh where he was at risk of
 
04:06:59.630 --> 04:06:59.640 align:start position:0%
being hit by a car or freezing to death
 
04:07:01.309 --> 04:07:01.319 align:start position:0%
he didn't have the capacity to navigate
 
04:07:03.670 --> 04:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
the world it meant locking all the doors
 
04:07:05.269 --> 04:07:05.279 align:start position:0%
at night and uh turning off the
 
04:07:06.630 --> 04:07:06.640 align:start position:0%
microwave and the water man and
 
04:07:09.189 --> 04:07:09.199 align:start position:0%
unplugging the appliances um just so we
 
04:07:11.229 --> 04:07:11.239 align:start position:0%
could get through in the evening or end
 
04:07:13.110 --> 04:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
the night uh we did this while trying to
 
04:07:15.950 --> 04:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
raise our our Second neurotypical Son as
 
04:07:17.870 --> 04:07:17.880 align:start position:0%
best as we could while going to our
 
04:07:20.670 --> 04:07:20.680 align:start position:0%
full-time jobs uh this lifestyle was not
 
04:07:22.990 --> 04:07:23.000 align:start position:0%
sustainable and it required me to drink
 
04:07:25.189 --> 04:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
vast quantities of coffee and uh eat at
 
04:07:27.710 --> 04:07:27.720 align:start position:0%
every opportunity just to stay awake so
 
04:07:30.469 --> 04:07:30.479 align:start position:0%
that I could I could parent um I became
 
04:07:33.109 --> 04:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
clinically obese pre-diabetic I took
 
04:07:35.389 --> 04:07:35.399 align:start position:0%
five pills from my heart three blood
 
04:07:37.790 --> 04:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
pressure medications uh my doctor told
 
04:07:40.590 --> 04:07:40.600 align:start position:0%
me I had to change this I was on my way
 
04:07:43.070 --> 04:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
to disability and death uh and I did
 
04:07:43.080 --> 04:07:44.229 align:start position:0%
to disability and death uh and I did
change

04:07:44.229 --> 04:07:44.239 align:start position:0%
change
 
04:07:46.109 --> 04:07:46.119 align:start position:0%
uh my son got access to the appropriate
 
04:07:48.469 --> 04:07:48.479 align:start position:0%
programs and it changed all this uh so
 
04:07:50.429 --> 04:07:50.439 align:start position:0%
all four of us could live and even
 
04:07:54.030 --> 04:07:54.040 align:start position:0%
Thrive so today I stand before you alive
 
04:07:56.030 --> 04:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
I'm alive because my son has a Medicaid
 
04:07:58.189 --> 04:07:58.199 align:start position:0%
funding I'm alive because my son's
 
04:07:59.990 --> 04:08:00.000 align:start position:0%

04:08:09.149 --> 04:08:09.159 align:start position:0%
productive members of the society like
 
04:08:11.149 --> 04:08:11.159 align:start position:0%
Loaves and Fishes every dollar spent on
 
04:08:13.510 --> 04:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
my son's Medicaid and behavioral program
 
04:08:15.630 --> 04:08:15.640 align:start position:0%
and protective services created health
 
04:08:18.229 --> 04:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
and wellness for myself my family my son
 
04:08:20.630 --> 04:08:20.640 align:start position:0%
the community and Beyond New Hampshire
 
04:08:23.309 --> 04:08:23.319 align:start position:0%
even there is truly a multiplier effect
 
04:08:24.870 --> 04:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
on health and wellness from disability
 
04:08:28.149 --> 04:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
funding a trickle down effect so great
 
04:08:30.030 --> 04:08:30.040 align:start position:0%
that it would make Ronald Reagan blush
 
04:08:32.510 --> 04:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
if May Rest In Peace So I respectfully
 
04:08:34.630 --> 04:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
suggest members of the House reject the
 
04:08:37.469 --> 04:08:37.479 align:start position:0%
Steep Cuts in the budget aimed at the
 
04:08:39.349 --> 04:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
04:08:42.030 --> 04:08:42.040 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health and Child Protection
 
04:08:44.070 --> 04:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
these cuts are fiscally IR irresponsible
 
04:08:46.469 --> 04:08:46.479 align:start position:0%
and a bad idea and in my opinion they're
 
04:08:52.269 --> 04:08:52.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:55.510 --> 04:08:55.520 align:start position:0%

five I object to the number 63 part of
 
04:09:50.910 --> 04:09:50.920 align:start position:0%
hb2 which directs the proceeds of the
 
04:09:53.630 --> 04:09:53.640 align:start position:0%
sale of the former Laconia State School
 
04:09:56.189 --> 04:09:56.199 align:start position:0%
campus property to be applied to the

subsequent land Building and
 
04:10:01.630 --> 04:10:01.640 align:start position:0%
improvements at one Granite place the
 
04:10:04.189 --> 04:10:04.199 align:start position:0%
lonia state school is not a property
 
04:10:06.550 --> 04:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
like any other the site of the
 
04:10:09.229 --> 04:10:09.239 align:start position:0%
dehumanization of several generations of
 
04:10:11.630 --> 04:10:11.640 align:start position:0%
people with developmental disabilities
 
04:10:14.790 --> 04:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
some of whose bones are buried there in
 
04:10:17.870 --> 04:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
unmarked Graves before 1940 and when
 
04:10:20.550 --> 04:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
they dig it dig it up to develop it they
 
04:10:21.790 --> 04:10:21.800 align:start position:0%
will find
 
04:10:24.070 --> 04:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
them these people deserve to be
 
04:10:26.070 --> 04:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
remembered and I think some of the
 
04:10:28.990 --> 04:10:29.000 align:start position:0%
proceeds from the sale of the in the
 
04:10:31.109 --> 04:10:31.119 align:start position:0%
property should go towards

04:11:03.550 --> 04:11:03.560 align:start position:0%
Ark back then and my Aunt Kathy held my

boys when they were
 
04:11:08.030 --> 04:11:08.040 align:start position:0%

film The horrendous living conditions
 
04:11:18.710 --> 04:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
that people were forced to endure in the

1950s it's in the documentary lost in

lonia if you haven't seen it these
 
04:11:25.870 --> 04:11:25.880 align:start position:0%
activists hoped that the film they
 
04:11:27.590 --> 04:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
captured would compel the New Hampshire
 
04:11:29.750 --> 04:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
State Legislature which passed
 
04:11:32.030 --> 04:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
legislation establishing theonia State
 
04:11:38.070 --> 04:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
School in 1901 to act they did not lonia
 
04:11:41.070 --> 04:11:41.080 align:start position:0%
was officially closed in 1991 after the
 
04:11:43.950 --> 04:11:43.960 align:start position:0%
landmark case gity v Galan
 
04:11:45.990 --> 04:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
when it closed its former residents
 
04:11:48.149 --> 04:11:48.159 align:start position:0%
moved out into the community and
 
04:11:50.990 --> 04:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
received amazing services and in many
 
04:11:53.469 --> 04:11:53.479 align:start position:0%
cases lived in group homes one of these
 
04:11:56.830 --> 04:11:56.840 align:start position:0%
people was Nelly a gentle and kind woman
 
04:11:58.790 --> 04:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
who was friends with my Aunt Kathy and
 
04:12:01.550 --> 04:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
lived at Great Bay she spent most of her
 
04:12:04.349 --> 04:12:04.359 align:start position:0%
life at lonia and said they were never
 
04:12:06.469 --> 04:12:06.479 align:start position:0%
allowed to go swimming even though the
 
04:12:08.790 --> 04:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
Laconia State School overlooked the
 
04:12:11.349 --> 04:12:11.359 align:start position:0%
water yep she didn't know how to use a
 
04:12:12.950 --> 04:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
fork and knife until she came out of
 
04:12:12.960 --> 04:12:13.910 align:start position:0%
fork and knife until she came out of
there

04:12:13.910 --> 04:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:12:16.189 --> 04:12:16.199 align:start position:0%
I think that the people that survived
 
04:12:18.269 --> 04:12:18.279 align:start position:0%
Laconia should have a say in what some
 
04:12:21.189 --> 04:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
of the proceeds from the sale go towards
 
04:12:23.070 --> 04:12:23.080 align:start position:0%
setting aside a portion of the funds to
 
04:12:25.710 --> 04:12:25.720 align:start position:0%
be used as a memorial or a scholarship
 
04:12:27.790 --> 04:12:27.800 align:start position:0%
that develop that benefits the
 
04:12:29.750 --> 04:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
developmental disability Community could
 
04:12:31.830 --> 04:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
be one way of remembering these people
 
04:12:34.070 --> 04:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
and restoring their Humanity I'm happy
 
04:12:41.790 --> 04:12:41.800 align:start position:0%

bone New Hampshire I'm here today to
 
04:13:07.590 --> 04:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
testify in strong support of the ad Rd
 
04:13:10.990 --> 04:13:11.000 align:start position:0%
respit grant program at just 21 years
 
04:13:13.109 --> 04:13:13.119 align:start position:0%
old I have lived the reality of
 
04:13:15.189 --> 04:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's caregiving when my
 
04:13:17.790 --> 04:13:17.800 align:start position:0%
grandfather was diagnosed in 2021 my
 
04:13:19.189 --> 04:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
family made the decision to move my
 
04:13:21.590 --> 04:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
grandparents into our home uring that he
 
04:13:24.510 --> 04:13:24.520 align:start position:0%
had the support he needed at first we
 
04:13:28.149 --> 04:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
managed but soon it became impossible he
 
04:13:30.189 --> 04:13:30.199 align:start position:0%
wandered outside forgetting which house
 
04:13:33.550 --> 04:13:33.560 align:start position:0%
was ours he became confused anxious and
 
04:13:36.309 --> 04:13:36.319 align:start position:0%
paranoid the Sund Downing was the worst
 
04:13:38.229 --> 04:13:38.239 align:start position:0%
he grew angry aggressive and
 
04:13:40.189 --> 04:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
unrecognizable to my grandmother who
 
04:13:42.469 --> 04:13:42.479 align:start position:0%
could no longer sleep beside him we
 
04:13:44.950 --> 04:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
installed cameras door sensors and took
 
04:13:47.510 --> 04:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
shifts just to keep him safe caregiving
 
04:13:50.189 --> 04:13:50.199 align:start position:0%
wasn't a responsibility it consumed Our
 
04:13:52.710 --> 04:13:52.720 align:start position:0%
Lives even when we hired help we were
 
04:13:55.149 --> 04:13:55.159 align:start position:0%
never truly off the clock but those few
 
04:13:57.070 --> 04:13:57.080 align:start position:0%
hours of respit allowed us to keep up
 
04:14:00.590 --> 04:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
with work school and our own health this
 
04:14:03.149 --> 04:14:03.159 align:start position:0%
support is essential it prevents burnout
 
04:14:05.030 --> 04:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
and allows families to keep loved ones
 
04:14:08.630 --> 04:14:08.640 align:start position:0%
at home longer with dignity Alzheimer's
 
04:14:10.710 --> 04:14:10.720 align:start position:0%
care isn't just emotionally exhausting
 
04:14:13.389 --> 04:14:13.399 align:start position:0%
it's financially crippling and just two
 
04:14:16.670 --> 04:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
months we spent $22,000 on home care and
 
04:14:19.790 --> 04:14:19.800 align:start position:0%
that wasn't even 24/7 coverage when my
 
04:14:21.510 --> 04:14:21.520 align:start position:0%
grandfather transitioned into Memory
 
04:14:25.710 --> 04:14:25.720 align:start position:0%
Care the financial strain only grew
 
04:14:28.830 --> 04:14:28.840 align:start position:0%
$67,000 for five months at one facility
 
04:14:32.550 --> 04:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
that's $133,000 per month and $48,000
 
04:14:35.229 --> 04:14:35.239 align:start position:0%
for four months at another at $122,000
 
04:14:37.790 --> 04:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
per month families like mine will do
 
04:14:39.710 --> 04:14:39.720 align:start position:0%
whatever it takes to care for our loved
 
04:14:43.070 --> 04:14:43.080 align:start position:0%
ones but it comes at an unbearable cost
 
04:14:45.469 --> 04:14:45.479 align:start position:0%
the funding the adrd respit grant
 
04:14:47.710 --> 04:14:47.720 align:start position:0%
program provides barely scratches the
 
04:14:50.149 --> 04:14:50.159 align:start position:0%
surface but it is still a
 
04:14:53.149 --> 04:14:53.159 align:start position:0%
Lifeline this isn't just my family story
 
04:14:56.309 --> 04:14:56.319 align:start position:0%
more than 11 million Americans provide
 
04:14:59.030 --> 04:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
unpaid Alzheimer's care totaling 18
 
04:15:02.710 --> 04:15:02.720 align:start position:0%
billion hours each year in New Hampshire
 
04:15:04.149 --> 04:15:04.159 align:start position:0%
the state with the second oldest
 
04:15:06.349 --> 04:15:06.359 align:start position:0%
population in the country the need for
 
04:15:09.469 --> 04:15:09.479 align:start position:0%
support is only growing the financial
 
04:15:11.269 --> 04:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
and emotional burden leads to
 
04:15:14.189 --> 04:15:14.199 align:start position:0%
devastating burnout nearly 60% of
 
04:15:15.910 --> 04:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's caregivers report high
 
04:15:18.790 --> 04:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
levels of stress anxiety and
 
04:15:21.109 --> 04:15:21.119 align:start position:0%
depression these are families stretch
 
04:15:23.149 --> 04:15:23.159 align:start position:0%
beyond their limits doing everything
 
04:15:24.870 --> 04:15:24.880 align:start position:0%
they can but without the support they
 
04:15:27.630 --> 04:15:27.640 align:start position:0%
truly need Alzheimer's caregiving is
 
04:15:29.870 --> 04:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
Relentless no one should have to choose
 
04:15:31.950 --> 04:15:31.960 align:start position:0%
between their loved ones care and
 
04:15:34.910 --> 04:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
financial ruin I urge you to support it
 
04:15:37.510 --> 04:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
because caregivers need care too thank

want you to know that I'm I'm all I'm
 
04:20:41.349 --> 04:20:41.359 align:start position:0%
very concerned about the the federal
 
04:20:43.429 --> 04:20:43.439 align:start position:0%
government and how would this budget
 
04:20:44.790 --> 04:20:44.800 align:start position:0%
affect if there were cuts from the
 
04:20:47.109 --> 04:20:47.119 align:start position:0%
federal level if if this was to pass or
 
04:20:50.349 --> 04:20:50.359 align:start position:0%
not to pass um with the further with the
 
04:20:52.309 --> 04:20:52.319 align:start position:0%
cuts affect Medicaid further than you
 
04:20:55.149 --> 04:20:55.159 align:start position:0%
all aware um cuts to education is that
 
04:20:56.349 --> 04:20:56.359 align:start position:0%
is that taken into count to some of
 
04:20:58.630 --> 04:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
these bills in your thought process um
 
04:21:00.510 --> 04:21:00.520 align:start position:0%
and if this is a reality if pass how
 
04:21:02.510 --> 04:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
would these Services look if this bill
 
04:21:04.070 --> 04:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
is passed in the federal government
 
04:21:05.590 --> 04:21:05.600 align:start position:0%

04:21:07.189 --> 04:21:07.199 align:start position:0%
here is really nervous about that and
 
04:21:08.389 --> 04:21:08.399 align:start position:0%

04:24:19.870 --> 04:24:19.880 align:start position:0%
dependent upon the supports that he
 
04:24:21.990 --> 04:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
receives from us and the services he
 
04:24:24.510 --> 04:24:24.520 align:start position:0%
receives through gateways and he's also
 
04:24:26.309 --> 04:24:26.319 align:start position:0%
very very dependent on the budget that
 
04:24:29.389 --> 04:24:29.399 align:start position:0%
you pass um and so please not only pass
 
04:24:31.189 --> 04:24:31.199 align:start position:0%

I'm with the nature conservancy in New
 
04:25:06.830 --> 04:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you for your service
 
04:25:08.790 --> 04:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
your patience uh and your attention
 
04:25:11.510 --> 04:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
tonight it's been a humbling afternoon
 
04:25:14.950 --> 04:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
I'm here to raise uh issues with two uh
 
04:25:16.830 --> 04:25:16.840 align:start position:0%
proposals in house bill one and House
 
04:25:18.990 --> 04:25:19.000 align:start position:0%
Bill two one has already been spoken to
 
04:25:20.910 --> 04:25:20.920 align:start position:0%
so I'll be brief and that is the
 
04:25:23.030 --> 04:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
proposed raid of the renewable energy
 
04:25:25.590 --> 04:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
fund uh House Bill one proposes to
 
04:25:28.429 --> 04:25:28.439 align:start position:0%
transfer $10 million from the rate payer
 
04:25:30.030 --> 04:25:30.040 align:start position:0%
funded renewable energy fund to the
 
04:25:32.830 --> 04:25:32.840 align:start position:0%
general fund we urge you to reject this
 
04:25:35.030 --> 04:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
proposal to sweep dedicated funds and
 
04:25:36.950 --> 04:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
shift them from their lawful intended
 
04:25:39.750 --> 04:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
uses that benefit electric rate payers
 
04:25:41.750 --> 04:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
from whom the funds were collected and
 
04:25:45.309 --> 04:25:45.319 align:start position:0%
instead uh becomes an unlawful General
 
04:25:48.149 --> 04:25:48.159 align:start position:0%
uh tax We Believe shifting these funds
 
04:25:50.389 --> 04:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
is an improper use of dedicated rate
 
04:25:53.070 --> 04:25:53.080 align:start position:0%
payer funds and instead we urge you to
 
04:25:54.510 --> 04:25:54.520 align:start position:0%
direct the New Hampshire Department of
 
04:25:57.229 --> 04:25:57.239 align:start position:0%
energy to actually spend those funds on
 
04:25:59.189 --> 04:25:59.199 align:start position:0%
eligible New Hampshire local energy
 
04:26:02.630 --> 04:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
projects as required by RSA 362
 
04:26:04.950 --> 04:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
F10 I will be submitting written
 
04:26:06.670 --> 04:26:06.680 align:start position:0%
testimony I'll go into more detail on
 
04:26:06.680 --> 04:26:07.590 align:start position:0%
testimony I'll go into more detail on
this

04:26:07.590 --> 04:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:26:10.590 --> 04:26:10.600 align:start position:0%
issue uh the second issue is uh the
 
04:26:12.670 --> 04:26:12.680 align:start position:0%
permitting streamlining propos proposals
 
04:26:14.590 --> 04:26:14.600 align:start position:0%
that are in uh house bill
 
04:26:18.510 --> 04:26:18.520 align:start position:0%
2 we are uh concerned about some of uh
 
04:26:20.189 --> 04:26:20.199 align:start position:0%
some aspects of these proposals and
 
04:26:21.750 --> 04:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
again I will cover this in more detail
 
04:26:23.349 --> 04:26:23.359 align:start position:0%
in written testimony but wanted to bring
 
04:26:26.990 --> 04:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
them to your attention uh we understand
 
04:26:29.429 --> 04:26:29.439 align:start position:0%
completely the goal of uh producing more
 
04:26:31.269 --> 04:26:31.279 align:start position:0%
housing in New Hampshire particularly
 
04:26:33.630 --> 04:26:33.640 align:start position:0%
housing that is Affordable and uh
 
04:26:34.950 --> 04:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
available for our
 
04:26:37.590 --> 04:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
Workforce however um these changes are
 
04:26:39.389 --> 04:26:39.399 align:start position:0%
that are being proposed in the name of
 
04:26:40.990 --> 04:26:41.000 align:start position:0%
making permitting environmental
 
04:26:43.510 --> 04:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
permitting easier for housing uh
 
04:26:45.790 --> 04:26:45.800 align:start position:0%
actually would apply to all development
 
04:26:49.070 --> 04:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
and Dees analysis shows that H new
 
04:26:52.510 --> 04:26:52.520 align:start position:0%
housing only makes up 30% of alteration
 
04:26:55.349 --> 04:26:55.359 align:start position:0%
of terrain permits and only 10% of
 
04:26:58.309 --> 04:26:58.319 align:start position:0%
wetlands permits so uh I just wanted to
 
04:27:00.469 --> 04:27:00.479 align:start position:0%
note that uh what we would be doing is
 
04:27:02.990 --> 04:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
changing and making uh permits easier
 
04:27:05.670 --> 04:27:05.680 align:start position:0%
for a wide range uh of
 
04:27:08.870 --> 04:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
development uh we are concerned about
 
04:27:11.750 --> 04:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
proposed shifts of staff and duties from
 
04:27:13.630 --> 04:27:13.640 align:start position:0%
the fish game department and the
 
04:27:15.070 --> 04:27:15.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Natural and cultural
 
04:27:18.269 --> 04:27:18.279 align:start position:0%
resources to Dees we deeply respect the
 
04:27:20.349 --> 04:27:20.359 align:start position:0%
work of Dees but we are concerned that
 
04:27:22.269 --> 04:27:22.279 align:start position:0%
this proposed streamlining that
 
04:27:24.109 --> 04:27:24.119 align:start position:0%
consolidates the staff and duties would
 
04:27:26.670 --> 04:27:26.680 align:start position:0%
be detrimental to the important services
 
04:27:29.429 --> 04:27:29.439 align:start position:0%
that dncr is natural heritage Bureau and
 
04:27:32.149 --> 04:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
Fish and Game provide to protect the
 
04:27:34.349 --> 04:27:34.359 align:start position:0%
health the water resources and the
 
04:27:36.349 --> 04:27:36.359 align:start position:0%
wildlife of New
 
04:27:39.389 --> 04:27:39.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh we would urge you to take
 
04:27:41.630 --> 04:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
more time to review these complex
 
04:27:44.109 --> 04:27:44.119 align:start position:0%
proposals including in front of the
 
04:27:46.469 --> 04:27:46.479 align:start position:0%
policy Committees of the house uh
 
04:27:48.349 --> 04:27:48.359 align:start position:0%
environment and agriculture resources
 
04:27:49.950 --> 04:27:49.960 align:start position:0%
Recreation and development fish and game
 
04:27:53.389 --> 04:27:53.399 align:start position:0%
and Marine Resources to name a few um we
 
04:27:56.309 --> 04:27:56.319 align:start position:0%
do want to um thank Dees for all the
 
04:27:57.830 --> 04:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
time they've spent with us explaining
 
04:28:00.189 --> 04:28:00.199 align:start position:0%
these changes to us and also thank
 
04:28:03.070 --> 04:28:03.080 align:start position:0%
Division 1 and Dees for supporting a
 
04:28:05.229 --> 04:28:05.239 align:start position:0%
change in the effective date we think
 
04:28:07.109 --> 04:28:07.119 align:start position:0%
this is critical if this goes into
 
04:28:10.389 --> 04:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
effect if it moves forward on June 30
 
04:28:12.990 --> 04:28:13.000 align:start position:0%
the staff can't possibly make this
 
04:28:15.349 --> 04:28:15.359 align:start position:0%
happen effectively on July 1 and we
 
04:28:17.149 --> 04:28:17.159 align:start position:0%
think it would actually slow down and
 
04:28:19.149 --> 04:28:19.159 align:start position:0%
complicate permitting so we thank
 
04:28:21.590 --> 04:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
Division 1 for that change and I will uh
 
04:28:23.469 --> 04:28:23.479 align:start position:0%
make the rest of my comments and writing
 
04:28:29.710 --> 04:28:29.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:32.349 --> 04:28:32.359 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman and uh
 
04:28:33.870 --> 04:28:33.880 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the committee good
 
04:28:35.910 --> 04:28:35.920 align:start position:0%
evening uh my name is Brendan Williams
 
04:28:37.950 --> 04:28:37.960 align:start position:0%
I'm the present CEO of the New Hampshire
 
04:28:40.710 --> 04:28:40.720 align:start position:0%
healthc care Association uh we represent
 
04:28:43.429 --> 04:28:43.439 align:start position:0%
a facility based long-term care uh
 
04:28:45.830 --> 04:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
nursing homes Assisted Living uh
 
04:28:48.030 --> 04:28:48.040 align:start position:0%
Continuing Care retirement communities
 
04:28:50.510 --> 04:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
and uh also the Cedar Crest Center for
 
04:28:52.950 --> 04:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
children with disabilities as you could
 
04:28:55.349 --> 04:28:55.359 align:start position:0%
perhaps imagine our foremost priority in
 
04:28:56.950 --> 04:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
this budget is to see that there be a
 
04:28:59.670 --> 04:28:59.680 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rate increase uh for nursing
 
04:29:01.590 --> 04:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
homes and also for the cedarest center
 
04:29:05.790 --> 04:29:05.800 align:start position:0%
for kids um that really is um something
 
04:29:07.750 --> 04:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
that would build upon the good work that
 
04:29:10.269 --> 04:29:10.279 align:start position:0%
this uh body did uh in the current
 
04:29:13.149 --> 04:29:13.159 align:start position:0%
budget uh when we look at the costs uh
 
04:29:15.349 --> 04:29:15.359 align:start position:0%
that nursing homes have incurred uh for
 
04:29:18.870 --> 04:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
example since the pandemic uh began uh
 
04:29:22.590 --> 04:29:22.600 align:start position:0%
wage costs alone are up 36% for
 
04:29:25.269 --> 04:29:25.279 align:start position:0%
nonsupervisory uh nursing home employees
 
04:29:27.990 --> 04:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
and that's just since February of 2020
 
04:29:30.510 --> 04:29:30.520 align:start position:0%
uh through January of this year and yet
 
04:29:33.469 --> 04:29:33.479 align:start position:0%
our Workforce is 7% smaller uh than it
 
04:29:35.670 --> 04:29:35.680 align:start position:0%
was uh in New Hampshire for nursing
 
04:29:38.990 --> 04:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
homes uh before the pandemic began uh
 
04:29:41.149 --> 04:29:41.159 align:start position:0%
despite these pay increases uh we just
 
04:29:42.510 --> 04:29:42.520 align:start position:0%
can't find the work workers and it
 
04:29:45.910 --> 04:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't help that every day uh roughly
 
04:29:49.109 --> 04:29:49.119 align:start position:0%
1,200 registered nurses uh leave the
 
04:29:51.710 --> 04:29:51.720 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire to work in
 
04:29:54.429 --> 04:29:54.439 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts so uh whatever we can do
 
04:29:57.109 --> 04:29:57.119 align:start position:0%
to keep Granite Staters here uh to serve
 
04:29:59.630 --> 04:29:59.640 align:start position:0%
our aging population is obviously a
 
04:30:02.070 --> 04:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
great investment and I also want to uh
 
04:30:05.389 --> 04:30:05.399 align:start position:0%
tout uh choices for Independence this is
 
04:30:08.710 --> 04:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
an interconnected system uh we rely upon
 
04:30:11.510 --> 04:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
Home Care uh even though we represent a
 
04:30:14.030 --> 04:30:14.040 align:start position:0%
facility based care because we discharge
 
04:30:17.070 --> 04:30:17.080 align:start position:0%
a rehabilitated uh patients uh into the
 
04:30:19.550 --> 04:30:19.560 align:start position:0%
Home Care setting uh my wife works in
 
04:30:22.070 --> 04:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
home health she's had three clients uh
 
04:30:25.710 --> 04:30:25.720 align:start position:0%
go into nursing homes uh the most recent
 
04:30:27.790 --> 04:30:27.800 align:start position:0%
uh lived to uh the age of
 
04:30:30.469 --> 04:30:30.479 align:start position:0%
96 uh before she went into a nursing
 
04:30:33.910 --> 04:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
home and although she will not return uh
 
04:30:36.630 --> 04:30:36.640 align:start position:0%
to her own home I think that's a tesate
 
04:30:39.109 --> 04:30:39.119 align:start position:0%
to the success of choices for
 
04:30:40.710 --> 04:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
Independence but the consequence to
 
04:30:42.590 --> 04:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
nursing homes is is that people are
 
04:30:44.750 --> 04:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
entering uh when they're sicker uh when
 
04:30:46.269 --> 04:30:46.279 align:start position:0%
they're older uh we have one of the
 
04:30:48.790 --> 04:30:48.800 align:start position:0%
nation's oldest nursing home populations
 
04:30:50.830 --> 04:30:50.840 align:start position:0%
and when their resources are depleted
 
04:30:53.269 --> 04:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
which is where you come in and uh I know
 
04:30:55.269 --> 04:30:55.279 align:start position:0%
you'll do the compassionate thing uh
 
04:30:56.990 --> 04:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
again in terms of providing a funding
 
04:30:59.349 --> 04:30:59.359 align:start position:0%
increase uh not withstanding the
 
04:31:01.910 --> 04:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
difficult uh state budget situation I
 
04:31:04.870 --> 04:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your public
 
04:31:07.550 --> 04:31:07.560 align:start position:0%
service thank
 
04:31:10.189 --> 04:31:10.199 align:start position:0%
you all right going through and list
 
04:31:15.790 --> 04:31:15.800 align:start position:0%

Marie Morgan I'm from Goffstown New
 
04:34:49.310 --> 04:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I agree with the testimony
 
04:34:51.949 --> 04:34:51.959 align:start position:0%
presented by these previous speakers
 
04:34:55.070 --> 04:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
regarding proposed cuts to so many
 
04:34:57.189 --> 04:34:57.199 align:start position:0%
programs impacting New Hampshire
 
04:35:00.150 --> 04:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
residents I stand before you today
 
04:35:02.150 --> 04:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
because I have a
 
04:35:05.990 --> 04:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
question regarding House Bill two and
 
04:35:09.390 --> 04:35:09.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:12.230 --> 04:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
Constitution it's my understanding
 
04:35:14.990 --> 04:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
that house bill two is a budget bill
 
04:35:18.150 --> 04:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
which is why it's in front of you as
 
04:35:19.670 --> 04:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
finance committee
 
04:35:23.629 --> 04:35:23.639 align:start position:0%
members yet under part two of the New
 
04:35:28.670 --> 04:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:32.390 --> 04:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:38.189 --> 04:35:38.199 align:start position:0%
1984 it says that no section or footnote
 
04:35:41.949 --> 04:35:41.959 align:start position:0%
of any budget bill
 
04:35:44.750 --> 04:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
shall contain any
 
04:35:46.910 --> 04:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
provision which
 
04:35:46.920 --> 04:35:48.429 align:start position:0%
provision which
establishes

04:35:48.429 --> 04:35:48.439 align:start position:0%
establishes
 
04:35:50.349 --> 04:35:50.359 align:start position:0%
amends or
 
04:35:53.551 --> 04:35:53.561 align:start position:0%
repeals statuary
 
04:35:55.789 --> 04:35:55.799 align:start position:0%
law other than
 
04:35:55.799 --> 04:35:57.750 align:start position:0%
law other than
Provisions

04:35:57.750 --> 04:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
Provisions
 
04:36:01.429 --> 04:36:01.439 align:start position:0%
establishing amending or
 
04:36:05.990 --> 04:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
repealing operating and capital expenses
 
04:36:08.949 --> 04:36:08.959 align:start position:0%
for the executive legislative and
 
04:36:13.029 --> 04:36:13.039 align:start position:0%
judicial branches of government
 
04:36:14.949 --> 04:36:14.959 align:start position:0%
let me read it
 
04:36:19.551 --> 04:36:19.561 align:start position:0%
again no section or footnote of any
 
04:36:23.551 --> 04:36:23.561 align:start position:0%
budget Bill shall contain any provision
 
04:36:26.830 --> 04:36:26.840 align:start position:0%
which establishes amends or repeals
 
04:36:31.150 --> 04:36:31.160 align:start position:0%
statutory law other than Provisions
 
04:36:34.510 --> 04:36:34.520 align:start position:0%
establishing amending or repealing those
 
04:36:37.470 --> 04:36:37.480 align:start position:0%
operating in capital expenses for the
 
04:36:40.590 --> 04:36:40.600 align:start position:0%
executive leg legislative and judicial
 
04:36:40.600 --> 04:36:42.189 align:start position:0%
executive leg legislative and judicial
branches

04:36:42.189 --> 04:36:42.199 align:start position:0%
branches
 
04:36:44.510 --> 04:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
so my question is
 
04:36:47.510 --> 04:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
this if the New Hampshire
 
04:36:50.709 --> 04:36:50.719 align:start position:0%
Constitution says budget bills shall not
 
04:36:56.670 --> 04:36:56.680 align:start position:0%
do all that why does House Bill two do
 
04:37:00.029 --> 04:37:00.039 align:start position:0%
it this refers to House Bill
 
04:37:02.990 --> 04:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
one when it says budget bills House Bill
 
04:37:06.429 --> 04:37:06.439 align:start position:0%
two is not considered a budget Bill why
 
04:37:09.189 --> 04:37:09.199 align:start position:0%
not it is the enabling legislation for
 
04:37:12.470 --> 04:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
the budget Bill well it says is any
 
04:37:16.310 --> 04:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
budget bill so how is that defined any
 
04:37:20.750 --> 04:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
budget bill because hb1 is budget bill
 
04:37:24.910 --> 04:37:24.920 align:start position:0%
hb2 is enabling hp1 okay so here here's
 
04:37:29.109 --> 04:37:29.119 align:start position:0%
some examples from House Bill 2 line one
 
04:37:34.070 --> 04:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
for example it says RSA 597 section 2
 
04:37:36.910 --> 04:37:36.920 align:start position:0%
regarding bail and release of defendants
 
04:37:36.920 --> 04:37:39.070 align:start position:0%
regarding bail and release of defendants
is

04:37:39.070 --> 04:37:39.080 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:37:42.349 --> 04:37:42.359 align:start position:0%
repealed and reenacted
 
04:37:48.510 --> 04:37:48.520 align:start position:0%
Etc then line two says RSA 212 section A
 
04:37:51.189 --> 04:37:51.199 align:start position:0%
talks about fishing game and endangered
 
04:37:53.510 --> 04:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
species is
 
04:37:57.709 --> 04:37:57.719 align:start position:0%
amended then we go on to line 19
 
04:38:00.470 --> 04:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
requires school boards to adopt student
 
04:38:03.910 --> 04:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
cell phone policies another one defines
 
04:38:07.070 --> 04:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
the eligible student for the purposes of
 
04:38:10.830 --> 04:38:10.840 align:start position:0%
enrollment in EFA accounts another one
 
04:38:14.470 --> 04:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
expands the types of purposes for which
 
04:38:17.990 --> 04:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
educational trust funds may be used
 
04:38:20.990 --> 04:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
another authorizes the State Board of
 
04:38:24.910 --> 04:38:24.920 align:start position:0%
Education to modify determinations of
 
04:38:28.830 --> 04:38:28.840 align:start position:0%
Education adequacy grants in line
 
04:38:34.150 --> 04:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
79 suspends Revenue sharing with towns
 
04:38:37.510 --> 04:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
under that's been in there since I think
 
04:38:40.070 --> 04:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
2013 it's a different program that's
 
04:38:43.590 --> 04:38:43.600 align:start position:0%
referred to in that RSA that we haven't
 
04:38:46.269 --> 04:38:46.279 align:start position:0%
used that to share we still do several
 
04:38:49.670 --> 04:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
sharing um places in the budget but not
 
04:38:51.470 --> 04:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
that particular one and that's that's
 
04:38:53.789 --> 04:38:53.799 align:start position:0%
something we should probably just delete
 
04:38:56.029 --> 04:38:56.039 align:start position:0%
it because we haven't we haven't shared
 
04:38:59.629 --> 04:38:59.639 align:start position:0%
along with that RSA for I don't know 12
 
04:39:02.269 --> 04:39:02.279 align:start position:0%
years or so so I guess the bottom line
 
04:39:07.349 --> 04:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
is is this house bill to a budget
 
04:39:17.070 --> 04:39:17.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:20.070 --> 04:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
let's see was that was Marie right yes
 
04:39:24.670 --> 04:39:24.680 align:start position:0%

has been going through hard times
 
04:40:00.510 --> 04:40:00.520 align:start position:0%
because diminish funding and low
 
04:40:02.550 --> 04:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
attendance I have talked to students who
 
04:40:04.190 --> 04:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
including myself have faced the
 
04:40:05.910 --> 04:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
consequences of this diminished funding
 
04:40:07.590 --> 04:40:07.600 align:start position:0%
for their Department programs that were
 
04:40:09.550 --> 04:40:09.560 align:start position:0%

04:40:10.990 --> 04:40:11.000 align:start position:0%

04:40:15.948 --> 04:40:15.958 align:start position:0%
change killing Plymouth State From the
 
04:40:18.470 --> 04:40:18.480 align:start position:0%

04:40:20.030 --> 04:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
seen the passion that we have for our
 
04:40:22.910 --> 04:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
campus the beautiful White Mountains the
 
04:40:24.510 --> 04:40:24.520 align:start position:0%
wonderful facility who work day and
 
04:40:26.350 --> 04:40:26.360 align:start position:0%
night to support us and the wonderful
 
04:40:28.390 --> 04:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
Community made up of people from all
 
04:40:30.510 --> 04:40:30.520 align:start position:0%
around the area but one thing is in
 
04:40:32.430 --> 04:40:32.440 align:start position:0%
common Plymouth State University is
 
04:40:35.310 --> 04:40:35.320 align:start position:0%
dying and it has been New Hampshire is
 
04:40:37.510 --> 04:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
dead last in public university funding
 
04:40:38.910 --> 04:40:38.920 align:start position:0%
and has the highest instate tuition
 
04:40:40.350 --> 04:40:40.360 align:start position:0%
rates to balance that out putting the
 
04:40:43.390 --> 04:40:43.400 align:start position:0%
institution on the back students we are
 
04:40:45.670 --> 04:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
$77,000 below the medium rage for per
 
04:40:49.550 --> 04:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
student funding let me be frank a 16.5
 
04:40:51.070 --> 04:40:51.080 align:start position:0%
million decrease over the next two years
 
04:40:52.948 --> 04:40:52.958 align:start position:0%
for the UNH system would kill our public
 
04:40:54.670 --> 04:40:54.680 align:start position:0%
universities that have been a resource
 
04:40:55.750 --> 04:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire students to get
 
04:40:59.430 --> 04:40:59.440 align:start position:0%
cheaper public education since 1866 in
 
04:41:02.390 --> 04:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
the case of unh 187
 
04:41:04.750 --> 04:41:04.760 align:start position:0%
1817 in the case of Plum State
 
04:41:07.990 --> 04:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
University in 1909 for Keen state with
 
04:41:09.230 --> 04:41:09.240 align:start position:0%
this less and less of our high school
 
04:41:10.750 --> 04:41:10.760 align:start position:0%
students will be staying in state for
 
04:41:13.670 --> 04:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
education or work leaving yes less of
 
04:41:15.750 --> 04:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
the younger generation in New Hampshire
 
04:41:17.910 --> 04:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
our universities are in danger and this
 
04:41:19.390 --> 04:41:19.400 align:start position:0%
will effectively be the final nail in
 
04:41:23.430 --> 04:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
the coffin for UNH school systems thank
 
04:41:26.788 --> 04:41:26.798 align:start position:0%

you good evening how do you do I'm
 
04:41:45.390 --> 04:41:45.400 align:start position:0%
Jackie Cowell from Early Learning New
 
04:41:48.150 --> 04:41:48.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we're a Statewide nonprofit
 
04:41:50.310 --> 04:41:50.320 align:start position:0%
Katie had mentioned it before um and
 
04:41:51.788 --> 04:41:51.798 align:start position:0%
we're here to talk with you about child
 
04:41:53.550 --> 04:41:53.560 align:start position:0%
care and I'm really appreciative of
 
04:41:54.750 --> 04:41:54.760 align:start position:0%
being able to talk to the whole
 
04:41:56.310 --> 04:41:56.320 align:start position:0%
committee I had the chance to talk to
 
04:42:00.628 --> 04:42:00.638 align:start position:0%
division three uh last week so um I've
 
04:42:02.430 --> 04:42:02.440 align:start position:0%
had a few childcare providers were
 
04:42:04.590 --> 04:42:04.600 align:start position:0%
hoping to come today they couldn't they
 
04:42:06.310 --> 04:42:06.320 align:start position:0%
had some letters I think they've they've
 
04:42:09.030 --> 04:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
uploaded them online so but I did want
 
04:42:11.310 --> 04:42:11.320 align:start position:0%
to read one of them to you um from
 
04:42:14.150 --> 04:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
alphabets in Manchester they have two
 
04:42:17.030 --> 04:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
programs and so Muriel Allard founded it
 
04:42:20.150 --> 04:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
40 years ago her niece uh Nicole Allard
 
04:42:22.948 --> 04:42:22.958 align:start position:0%
Nutter uh runs it now and so she shared
 
04:42:25.350 --> 04:42:25.360 align:start position:0%
this and I want to share this with you
 
04:42:27.550 --> 04:42:27.560 align:start position:0%
she said they have a licensed capacity
 
04:42:32.470 --> 04:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
of 323 at one childcare program 264 at
 
04:42:35.430 --> 04:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
the other they have ample space for more
 
04:42:37.390 --> 04:42:37.400 align:start position:0%
children one of the programs could take
 
04:42:40.110 --> 04:42:40.120 align:start position:0%
70 more kids and uh the other one can
 
04:42:43.070 --> 04:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
take 130 and the only reason they're not
 
04:42:45.948 --> 04:42:45.958 align:start position:0%
full is the Staffing shortage and so
 
04:42:48.310 --> 04:42:48.320 align:start position:0%
their number one priority is restoring
 
04:42:52.270 --> 04:42:52.280 align:start position:0%
that 15 million in child care Workforce
 
04:42:55.750 --> 04:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
grants and um and she mentions also that
 
04:42:57.868 --> 04:42:57.878 align:start position:0%
it was very successful for them when it
 
04:43:00.750 --> 04:43:00.760 align:start position:0%
came out in August last year of
 
04:43:03.430 --> 04:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
2024 uh it helped them you you'll see in
 
04:43:06.310 --> 04:43:06.320 align:start position:0%
her letter it helped them keep those
 
04:43:07.948 --> 04:43:07.958 align:start position:0%
credential staff the ones who were
 
04:43:09.550 --> 04:43:09.560 align:start position:0%
really terrific at their jobs they
 
04:43:11.868 --> 04:43:11.878 align:start position:0%
stayed and so she she's really they're
 
04:43:14.190 --> 04:43:14.200 align:start position:0%
really hoping this continues just a
 
04:43:16.350 --> 04:43:16.360 align:start position:0%
quick story is that in
 
04:43:19.670 --> 04:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
2023 these $15 million and Workforce
 
04:43:21.470 --> 04:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
grants went out the door it was very
 
04:43:24.310 --> 04:43:24.320 align:start position:0%
much a strong bipartisan vote to do this
 
04:43:26.350 --> 04:43:26.360 align:start position:0%
they were General funds in
 
04:43:30.190 --> 04:43:30.200 align:start position:0%
2023 and um it was very important that
 
04:43:33.628 --> 04:43:33.638 align:start position:0%
again the strong bipartisan vote in hb2
 
04:43:37.270 --> 04:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
as well they did mention um and direct
 
04:43:40.628 --> 04:43:40.638 align:start position:0%
that uh DHHS put that 15 million in this
 
04:43:44.270 --> 04:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
next by Anum coming up and they did as
 
04:43:45.910 --> 04:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
you'll see on page
 
04:43:48.990 --> 04:43:49.000 align:start position:0%
881 it is zeroed out in the governor's
 
04:43:51.788 --> 04:43:51.798 align:start position:0%
proposal however we do believe and we'd
 
04:43:53.990 --> 04:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
love to work with you we do believe
 
04:43:56.510 --> 04:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
there's funding available right now that
 
04:43:58.430 --> 04:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
can be used that's an allowable use for
 
04:44:00.830 --> 04:44:00.840 align:start position:0%
these childcare Workforce grants that
 
04:44:03.430 --> 04:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
would not require General funds so I
 
04:44:04.830 --> 04:44:04.840 align:start position:0%
hope to work with you to restore it
 
04:44:08.990 --> 04:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you all
 
04:44:12.430 --> 04:44:12.440 align:start position:0%
right Cyrus is next and then state
 
04:44:13.750 --> 04:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
representative Chris
 
04:44:19.590 --> 04:44:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:21.788 --> 04:44:21.798 align:start position:0%
you thank you all so much for still
 
04:44:25.670 --> 04:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
being here given the hour um my name is
 
04:44:27.550 --> 04:44:27.560 align:start position:0%
Cyrus anger bich I am a student at
 
04:44:29.150 --> 04:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
Plymouth State University and I'm here
 
04:44:31.510 --> 04:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
representing myself as a citizen and a
 
04:44:34.150 --> 04:44:34.160 align:start position:0%
voter in New Hampshire I live in
 
04:44:37.190 --> 04:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
Plymouth and I love my town uh and I am
 
04:44:38.910 --> 04:44:38.920 align:start position:0%
deeply deeply concerned not just about
 
04:44:41.190 --> 04:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
the university but about the town itself
 
04:44:44.110 --> 04:44:44.120 align:start position:0%
given the potential Cuts uh to the usn
 
04:44:44.120 --> 04:44:45.470 align:start position:0%
given the potential Cuts uh to the usn
to

04:44:45.470 --> 04:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:44:47.948 --> 04:44:47.958 align:start position:0%
usnh uh while a lot of what I'm going to
 
04:44:50.310 --> 04:44:50.320 align:start position:0%
say is applicable to usnh as a whole
 
04:44:53.470 --> 04:44:53.480 align:start position:0%
given my own uh time at Plymouth state
 
04:44:55.708 --> 04:44:55.718 align:start position:0%
which is where I currently am uh I will
 
04:44:58.150 --> 04:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
primarily be referring to that I mostly
 
04:44:59.628 --> 04:44:59.638 align:start position:0%
Echo a lot of sentiments that fellow
 
04:45:00.670 --> 04:45:00.680 align:start position:0%
students of mine have brought up
 
04:45:03.150 --> 04:45:03.160 align:start position:0%
especially things brought up by Jeremiah
 
04:45:05.430 --> 04:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
and Ethan as you heard earlier um
 
04:45:07.868 --> 04:45:07.878 align:start position:0%
Plymouth state is kind of a life uh
 
04:45:10.230 --> 04:45:10.240 align:start position:0%
Lifeline directly to the north for a lot
 
04:45:11.948 --> 04:45:11.958 align:start position:0%
of economic
 
04:45:14.910 --> 04:45:14.920 align:start position:0%
uh the actual when school is in session
 
04:45:16.750 --> 04:45:16.760 align:start position:0%
the town of plymouth's size almost
 
04:45:20.430 --> 04:45:20.440 align:start position:0%
doubles so businesses in town rely
 
04:45:21.910 --> 04:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
heavily on students being able to
 
04:45:24.030 --> 04:45:24.040 align:start position:0%
regularly come I personally know someone
 
04:45:25.788 --> 04:45:25.798 align:start position:0%
who was working at a business that had
 
04:45:27.390 --> 04:45:27.400 align:start position:0%
to go from being open every day of the
 
04:45:29.430 --> 04:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
week to shutting down some days of the
 
04:45:32.150 --> 04:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
week because during offseasons they
 
04:45:36.070 --> 04:45:36.080 align:start position:0%
could not uh maintain opening costs um a
 
04:45:37.470 --> 04:45:37.480 align:start position:0%
couple other things I want to bring up
 
04:45:41.070 --> 04:45:41.080 align:start position:0%
is the fact that uh with the cuts
 
04:45:43.310 --> 04:45:43.320 align:start position:0%
already having happened uh it's not like
 
04:45:45.390 --> 04:45:45.400 align:start position:0%
Plymouth state has some Grand budget
 
04:45:46.830 --> 04:45:46.840 align:start position:0%
that they're able to work with over the
 
04:45:48.310 --> 04:45:48.320 align:start position:0%
past few years they've already cut over
 
04:45:50.628 --> 04:45:50.638 align:start position:0%
a hundred staff and they've done every
 
04:45:53.150 --> 04:45:53.160 align:start position:0%
single thing that they can to as little
 
04:45:54.430 --> 04:45:54.440 align:start position:0%
as possible change the student
 
04:45:56.430 --> 04:45:56.440 align:start position:0%
experience and therefore as little as
 
04:45:58.868 --> 04:45:58.878 align:start position:0%
possible uh prevent people from coming
 
04:46:00.470 --> 04:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
it's coming now to the point where many
 
04:46:02.470 --> 04:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
people I've personally spoken to have
 
04:46:04.628 --> 04:46:04.638 align:start position:0%
wanted to transfer take their money go
 
04:46:06.030 --> 04:46:06.040 align:start position:0%
somewhere else most people I've spoken
 
04:46:07.470 --> 04:46:07.480 align:start position:0%
to are planning to go to schools in
 
04:46:09.868 --> 04:46:09.878 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts um many people that I've
 
04:46:12.550 --> 04:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
interacted with have have uh come from
 
04:46:14.430 --> 04:46:14.440 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and back to New Hampshire
 
04:46:18.230 --> 04:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
and come here to Plymouth and have loved
 
04:46:19.990 --> 04:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
the school but have expressed that part
 
04:46:22.310 --> 04:46:22.320 align:start position:0%
of them kind of regrets it given what
 
04:46:24.628 --> 04:46:24.638 align:start position:0%
the funding cuts that are happening now
 
04:46:26.590 --> 04:46:26.600 align:start position:0%
um the way that the school is designed
 
04:46:28.470 --> 04:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
is focused on Innovation it's focused on
 
04:46:31.470 --> 04:46:31.480 align:start position:0%
letting uh students look at you know a
 
04:46:33.670 --> 04:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
broad range of important perspectives
 
04:46:35.990 --> 04:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
from engineering to business to
 
04:46:38.070 --> 04:46:38.080 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurship when it comes to uh
 
04:46:39.830 --> 04:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
bringing Innovation into New Hampshire
 
04:46:42.230 --> 04:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
bringing economic GS into New Hampshire
 
04:46:44.868 --> 04:46:44.878 align:start position:0%
and a cut like this to the schools as
 
04:46:48.110 --> 04:46:48.120 align:start position:0%
they are right now given that again we
 
04:46:50.350 --> 04:46:50.360 align:start position:0%
are the lowest school we are the lowest
 
04:46:52.708 --> 04:46:52.718 align:start position:0%
state in the nation when it comes to uh
 
04:46:55.070 --> 04:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
paying for public education and even if
 
04:46:57.430 --> 04:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
we raised it by $1,000 per student at
 
04:46:59.470 --> 04:46:59.480 align:start position:0%
Plymouth State we would still be 50th
 
04:47:00.868 --> 04:47:00.878 align:start position:0%
and we would not have to worry about
 
04:47:03.030 --> 04:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
these uh cuts and we would still be able
 
04:47:05.350 --> 04:47:05.360 align:start position:0%
to keep most of our faculty all of that
 
04:47:08.430 --> 04:47:08.440 align:start position:0%
being said I truly implore you not for
 
04:47:10.150 --> 04:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
the sake of me as a student but for the
 
04:47:12.470 --> 04:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
sake of me a resident of Plymouth and
 
04:47:14.110 --> 04:47:14.120 align:start position:0%
for the sake of all of the people that I
 
04:47:16.510 --> 04:47:16.520 align:start position:0%
know that are from further north and
 
04:47:19.190 --> 04:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
rely heavily on the uh economic input
 
04:47:21.350 --> 04:47:21.360 align:start position:0%
that having the university system in
 
04:47:24.670 --> 04:47:24.680 align:start position:0%
place as it is to not execute it to not
 
04:47:26.430 --> 04:47:26.440 align:start position:0%
choke the lifeblood out of the north of
 
04:47:30.990 --> 04:47:31.000 align:start position:0%

04:47:52.670 --> 04:47:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:55.548 --> 04:47:55.558 align:start position:0%

04:48:11.788 --> 04:48:11.798 align:start position:0%
representative Schulz thank you Mr chair
 
04:48:13.110 --> 04:48:13.120 align:start position:0%
it would have been fun to be the very
 
04:48:15.310 --> 04:48:15.320 align:start position:0%
last speaker but I will be brief because
 
04:48:17.510 --> 04:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
I know you guys have had a very long day
 
04:48:21.030 --> 04:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
my message is simple um you've probably
 
04:48:23.590 --> 04:48:23.600 align:start position:0%
heard a lot of stories about the most
 
04:48:26.910 --> 04:48:26.920 align:start position:0%
vulnerable in New Hampshire and I think
 
04:48:28.788 --> 04:48:28.798 align:start position:0%
that that should be given the very first
 
04:48:31.190 --> 04:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
part of your priority when you look at
 
04:48:34.948 --> 04:48:34.958 align:start position:0%
the budget I would say this category
 
04:48:37.830 --> 04:48:37.840 align:start position:0%
list includes children mothers in need
 
04:48:39.910 --> 04:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
of help with child care mothers in
 
04:48:41.548 --> 04:48:41.558 align:start position:0%
general probably
 
04:48:45.750 --> 04:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
seniors people who are ill people with
 
04:48:48.910 --> 04:48:48.920 align:start position:0%
disabilities public school students
 
04:48:51.670 --> 04:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
people in poverty people earning low
 
04:48:54.190 --> 04:48:54.200 align:start position:0%
wages I will remind you that we default
 
04:48:57.270 --> 04:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
to the federal minimum wage is $725
 
04:48:59.670 --> 04:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
cents and you think well not many people
 
04:49:02.750 --> 04:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
make minimum wage in New Hampshire um
 
04:49:02.760 --> 04:49:03.830 align:start position:0%
make minimum wage in New Hampshire um
about

04:49:03.830 --> 04:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:49:06.548 --> 04:49:06.558 align:start position:0%
130,000 graned Staters earn less than
 
04:49:10.868 --> 04:49:10.878 align:start position:0%
$15 an hour that is a vulnerable wage
 
04:49:13.750 --> 04:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
I would include um people with medical
 
04:49:15.310 --> 04:49:15.320 align:start position:0%
debt and student
 
04:49:19.708 --> 04:49:19.718 align:start position:0%
debt and I would also add I'm a um a
 
04:49:22.150 --> 04:49:22.160 align:start position:0%
city councelor here in conquer and the
 
04:49:24.230 --> 04:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
one thing that I also know you've heard
 
04:49:26.868 --> 04:49:26.878 align:start position:0%
today is that we we should stop the
 
04:49:30.510 --> 04:49:30.520 align:start position:0%
downshifting of costs to uh cities and
 
04:49:33.230 --> 04:49:33.240 align:start position:0%
towns to all but the most 12 most
 
04:49:34.830 --> 04:49:34.840 align:start position:0%
prosperous cities and towns in New
 
04:49:36.990 --> 04:49:37.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's like almost all of New
 
04:49:40.070 --> 04:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would benefit from that so my
 
04:49:42.430 --> 04:49:42.440 align:start position:0%
message is simple please keep the most
 
04:49:45.150 --> 04:49:45.160 align:start position:0%
vulnerable at the top of your agenda and
 
04:49:48.030 --> 04:49:48.040 align:start position:0%
stop the down uh shifting of costs to
 
04:49:50.910 --> 04:49:50.920 align:start position:0%
our uh all but the 14 or so most
 
04:49:53.628 --> 04:49:53.638 align:start position:0%
prosperous cities in towns and thank you
 
04:49:56.990 --> 04:49:57.000 align:start position:0%

04:50:31.628 --> 04:50:31.638 align:start position:0%
Testimony my name is Caitlyn Bernier and
 
04:50:34.150 --> 04:50:34.160 align:start position:0%
I'm in opposition of this budget I live
 
04:50:36.230 --> 04:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
in marac where I'm a member of our
 
04:50:38.150 --> 04:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
school budget committee Planning and
 
04:50:40.750 --> 04:50:40.760 align:start position:0%
Building committee and a mother of two
 
04:50:44.190 --> 04:50:44.200 align:start position:0%
very pre-teen children who you who one
 
04:50:47.750 --> 04:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
of utilizes special education and I am
 
04:50:50.430 --> 04:50:50.440 align:start position:0%
on a fixed income I am speaking to you
 
04:50:52.948 --> 04:50:52.958 align:start position:0%
today as all of those things and many
 
04:50:55.190 --> 04:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
more active roles that I play in my
 
04:50:57.948 --> 04:50:57.958 align:start position:0%
community as a budget Committee Member I
 
04:51:00.310 --> 04:51:00.320 align:start position:0%
have been in your position Al Bet on a
 
04:51:02.708 --> 04:51:02.718 align:start position:0%
much smaller scale but I learned a lot
 
04:51:05.030 --> 04:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
from our public hearings about my
 
04:51:07.590 --> 04:51:07.600 align:start position:0%
community's needs and struggles I also
 
04:51:10.628 --> 04:51:10.638 align:start position:0%
learned a lot about our District budget
 
04:51:13.230 --> 04:51:13.240 align:start position:0%
expenses and revenue which we don't have
 
04:51:15.948 --> 04:51:15.958 align:start position:0%
much of and actually receive much less
 
04:51:18.150 --> 04:51:18.160 align:start position:0%
than I had anticipated since we are the
 
04:51:21.070 --> 04:51:21.080 align:start position:0%
eighth largest District in New Hampshire
 
04:51:23.150 --> 04:51:23.160 align:start position:0%
the state has routinely reduced the
 
04:51:25.788 --> 04:51:25.798 align:start position:0%
amount of special education funding
 
04:51:27.868 --> 04:51:27.878 align:start position:0%
provided to our district despite
 
04:51:29.830 --> 04:51:29.840 align:start position:0%
inflation and is currently adding more
 
04:51:32.628 --> 04:51:32.638 align:start position:0%
barriers to Grants and funding the cost
 
04:51:35.150 --> 04:51:35.160 align:start position:0%
of funding and adequate education is not
 
04:51:37.470 --> 04:51:37.480 align:start position:0%
being met by the state which in turn
 
04:51:40.150 --> 04:51:40.160 align:start position:0%
puts the cost burden on our taxpayers in
 
04:51:43.070 --> 04:51:43.080 align:start position:0%
the form of higher property taxes the
 
04:51:45.708 --> 04:51:45.718 align:start position:0%
consistent concern with the increase in
 
04:51:47.990 --> 04:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
property taxes is prevalent throughout
 
04:51:50.310 --> 04:51:50.320 align:start position:0%
our community and our state as you have
 
04:51:54.150 --> 04:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
all heard today yet we still see these
 
04:51:58.350 --> 04:51:58.360 align:start position:0%
non-stop bills to expand our efas your
 
04:52:01.350 --> 04:52:01.360 align:start position:0%
obligation is to the m the majority of
 
04:52:03.990 --> 04:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
children in New Hampshire that utilize
 
04:52:06.990 --> 04:52:07.000 align:start position:0%
public education first and foremost the
 
04:52:09.830 --> 04:52:09.840 align:start position:0%
state meaning you all need to look at
 
04:52:12.150 --> 04:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
other Avenue Vues for Revenue to
 
04:52:15.110 --> 04:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
adequately fund public education so
 
04:52:17.590 --> 04:52:17.600 align:start position:0%
seniors and those on fixed incomes
 
04:52:20.390 --> 04:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
aren't taxed out of their homes I grew
 
04:52:22.470 --> 04:52:22.480 align:start position:0%
up in the town I am now choosing to
 
04:52:25.510 --> 04:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
raise my own children in a town where we
 
04:52:27.788 --> 04:52:27.798 align:start position:0%
look out for our neighbors and work
 
04:52:29.910 --> 04:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
together to improve our community and
 
04:52:32.990 --> 04:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
solve our problems my ask today is that
 
04:52:35.548 --> 04:52:35.558 align:start position:0%
you consider your neighbors especially
 
04:52:38.390 --> 04:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
children and seniors and your obligation
 
04:52:41.708 --> 04:52:41.718 align:start position:0%
to adequately fund a prop Education
 
04:52:44.390 --> 04:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
Without more burden on property taxes
 
04:52:46.548 --> 04:52:46.558 align:start position:0%
