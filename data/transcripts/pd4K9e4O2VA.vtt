00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
house bill 122 is relative
 
00:10:25.829 --> 00:10:25.839 align:start position:0%
house bill 142 is relative to causes for
 
00:10:25.839 --> 00:10:28.069 align:start position:0%
house bill 142 is relative to causes for
divorce

00:10:28.069 --> 00:10:28.079 align:start position:0%
divorce
 
00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:35.509 --> 00:10:35.519 align:start position:0%
what we're doing is on uh roman numeral
 
00:10:37.829 --> 00:10:37.839 align:start position:0%
roman numeral seven
 
00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
um we were we are adding
 
00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
and correcting
 
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
the verbiage of this bill so it will say
 
00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
when either party
 
00:10:52.949 --> 00:10:52.959 align:start position:0%
habitually abuses alcohol or drugs and
 
00:10:58.069 --> 00:10:58.079 align:start position:0%
has been doing so for two or more years
 
00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:00.720 align:start position:0%
i feel that this will clarify
 
00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:04.160 align:start position:0%
um that cause of divorce more so
 
00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
than what was already there
 
00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
and with that um
 
00:11:15.269 --> 00:11:15.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:17.200 align:start position:0%

forgive me if it's um not exactly
 
00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:22.720 align:start position:0%
uh the right thing but i can't hear is
 
00:14:25.189 --> 00:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
to revise the uh the wording for a fault
 
00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
divorce and my understanding was that
 
00:14:30.629 --> 00:14:30.639 align:start position:0%
adding the sexual misconduct phrase
 
00:14:32.629 --> 00:14:32.639 align:start position:0%
was also part of this bill
 
00:14:35.269 --> 00:14:35.279 align:start position:0%
my understanding was that the law simply
 
00:14:37.509 --> 00:14:37.519 align:start position:0%
the states the law right now as it is
 
00:14:39.189 --> 00:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
that adultery can only occur between a
 
00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
man and a woman
 
00:14:43.189 --> 00:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
i'm talking to today because i'm going
 
00:14:44.629 --> 00:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
through a divorce
 
00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:48.160 align:start position:0%
and i begin a gay marriage and my wife
 
00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
committed the adultery
 
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
when i submitted my testimony for the
 
00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
hearing to the judge
 
00:14:57.509 --> 00:14:57.519 align:start position:0%
it was thrown back because adultery in
 
00:14:58.870 --> 00:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire is only
 
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
between a man and a woman
 
00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
um we fought for marriage rights so
 
00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
straight couples have the right to marry
 
00:15:06.389 --> 00:15:06.399 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:15:06.399 --> 00:15:07.110 align:start position:0%
and then
gay

00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
gay
 
00:15:08.389 --> 00:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
people have the right to marry so we
 
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
have the right to marry but we do not
 
00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
have the right to divorce in the same
 
00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
manner i was thrown back all of my
 
00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:16.310 align:start position:0%
manner i was thrown back all of my
exhibits

00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
exhibits
 
00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
um and the lawyer on the opposing side
 
00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
from concord was able to get lawyer fees
 
00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
out of me when it's his client that did
 
00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
the adultery
 
00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:28.240 align:start position:0%
i find it completely discriminating
 
00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
that we are allowed to marry but we are
 
00:15:32.949 --> 00:15:32.959 align:start position:0%
not allowed to base our adultery
 
00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
cause of divorce for adultery just
 
00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:35.509 align:start position:0%
cause of divorce for adultery just
because

00:15:35.509 --> 00:15:35.519 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
we are two women
 
00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:40.240 align:start position:0%
when i talked about this to uh in the
 
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
hearing and to my lawyer to the judge
 
00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
my the lawyer was very patronizing and
 
00:15:47.829 --> 00:15:47.839 align:start position:0%
told me well that's the law you want to
 
00:15:49.189 --> 00:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
do something about it i guess go to
 
00:15:49.199 --> 00:15:50.389 align:start position:0%
do something about it i guess go to
legislation

00:15:50.389 --> 00:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:15:50.399 --> 00:15:51.269 align:start position:0%
legislation
well

00:15:51.269 --> 00:15:51.279 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
here i am
 
00:15:55.749 --> 00:15:55.759 align:start position:0%
um i don't know what i can do i'm hoping
 
00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
that this bill with the sexual
 
00:16:00.629 --> 00:16:00.639 align:start position:0%
misconduct phrase would allow me if this
 
00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
became law
 
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
to resubmit my divorce claim on the
 
00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
basis of adultery rounds with adultery
 
00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
because i can use the sexual misconduct
 
00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
it isn't unfair how far our gay rights
 
00:16:18.389 --> 00:16:18.399 align:start position:0%
have come
 
00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
and yet i am still discriminated against
 
00:16:23.829 --> 00:16:23.839 align:start position:0%
in my law my divorce proceedings my
 
00:16:26.389 --> 00:16:26.399 align:start position:0%
final hearing is not until june
 
00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
i don't know if anything would happen in
 
00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
a timeline where i can resubmit my claim
 
00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
of adult trade rounds for adultery in my
 
00:16:34.949 --> 00:16:34.959 align:start position:0%
divorce hearing
 
00:16:37.189 --> 00:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
but if not and i unfortunately had to
 
00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
pay fees which i did not think was fair
 
00:16:42.389 --> 00:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
um i'm hoping that future
 
00:16:44.949 --> 00:16:44.959 align:start position:0%
gay and lesbians that have any issues in
 
00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
a marriage
 
00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:48.720 align:start position:0%
adultery is adultery just like marriage
 
00:16:51.749 --> 00:16:51.759 align:start position:0%
is marriage man to woman or woman to
 
00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
woman or man to man
 
00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:54.870 align:start position:0%
woman or man to man
so

00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
i may not be clear exactly what this
 
00:16:58.790 --> 00:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
hearing is it seems like after the
 
00:17:01.269 --> 00:17:01.279 align:start position:0%
opening of the bill that it's just to
 
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
change the wording
 
00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
for the two years and that seems fine to
 
00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
me makes the wording more clear so i
 
00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
support that
 
00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:09.839 align:start position:0%
bill that you're looking at today
 
00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:12.959 align:start position:0%
um if anybody can help provide any
 
00:17:14.789 --> 00:17:14.799 align:start position:0%
other information to me
 
00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
as far as what i'm not reading correctly
 
00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:18.959 align:start position:0%
if the sexual misconduct is already in
 
00:17:21.189 --> 00:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
law i don't think it's already in law as
 
00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
far as what i was looking at
 
00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:25.839 align:start position:0%
so that's all i wanted to say um i
 
00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:27.839 align:start position:0%

problem that you have you are
 
00:20:03.029 --> 00:20:03.039 align:start position:0%
experiencing right now within the

judicial system
 
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
is actually being addressed at the

that will probably come out before any
 
00:20:32.149 --> 00:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
legislation could finish winding its way
 
00:20:32.159 --> 00:20:33.510 align:start position:0%
legislation could finish winding its way

so
 
00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
if i i came in on the tail end of that
 
00:21:30.149 --> 00:21:30.159 align:start position:0%
and it was my understanding that in
 
00:21:32.549 --> 00:21:32.559 align:start position:0%
support of this bill somebody who just
 
00:21:35.029 --> 00:21:35.039 align:start position:0%
testified indicate that they were in a
 
00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
same-sex marriage and that there was the
 
00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
type of uh sexual misconduct described
 
00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
which is described in house
 
00:21:45.669 --> 00:21:45.679 align:start position:0%
uh 142.
 
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
um if somebody
 
00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:48.149 align:start position:0%
um if somebody
uh

00:21:48.149 --> 00:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:21:50.149 --> 00:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
what i was basing what we were basing
 
00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
this bill on was first of all not only
 
00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
the traditional notions of what
 
00:21:58.710 --> 00:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
constituted sexual misconduct was
 
00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
but also on the way the new hampshire
 
00:22:05.029 --> 00:22:05.039 align:start position:0%
supreme court had previously treated
 
00:22:05.039 --> 00:22:07.510 align:start position:0%
supreme court had previously treated
claims

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
claims
 
00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
of what adultery was specifically
 
00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
in the in the case of henry blanchflower
 
00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
from 2003
 
00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:16.390 align:start position:0%
from 2003
uh

00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
the court turned down the notion of
 
00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
adulterous conduct when one of the
 
00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
parties was engaged in basically a
 
00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
same-sex same-sex sex practices okay in
 
00:22:30.149 --> 00:22:30.159 align:start position:0%
other words what the new hampshire
 
00:22:33.029 --> 00:22:33.039 align:start position:0%
supreme court said would adultery uh
 
00:22:36.149 --> 00:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
gets its common ordinary um
 
00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:38.720 align:start position:0%
interpretation which at that time
 
00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
required sexual intercourse uh defined
 
00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
as traditional heterosexual intercourse
 
00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
between a man and a woman
 
00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:47.510 align:start position:0%
between a man and a woman
um

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
just by way of uh just by way of trying
 
00:22:52.149 --> 00:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
to clear some of this stuff up
 
00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
last night i emailed a copy of a new
 
00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire bar news article that i had
 
00:22:59.190 --> 00:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
done uh which described more generally
 
00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
this these issues uh
 
00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:04.559 align:start position:0%
for the committee uh that was done i
 
00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
think in november of last year regarding
 
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
what you have here
 
00:23:14.789 --> 00:23:14.799 align:start position:0%
is more generally is
 
00:23:14.799 --> 00:23:16.070 align:start position:0%
is more generally is
bringing

00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
bringing
 
00:23:19.909 --> 00:23:19.919 align:start position:0%
same-sex couples and
 
00:23:21.909 --> 00:23:21.919 align:start position:0%
i'm going to say traditional couples
 
00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
heterosexual couples more in unity
 
00:23:27.029 --> 00:23:27.039 align:start position:0%
because what it does is it gives them
 
00:23:30.149 --> 00:23:30.159 align:start position:0%
mutuality and commonality of remedy
 
00:23:30.159 --> 00:23:31.190 align:start position:0%
mutuality and commonality of remedy
uh

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
what you have here is um
 
00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
a situation where people who are
 
00:23:39.909 --> 00:23:39.919 align:start position:0%
engaging in sex practices that do not
 
00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
implicate uh sexual intercourse
 
00:23:45.669 --> 00:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
nevertheless have the same remedies uh
 
00:23:48.549 --> 00:23:48.559 align:start position:0%
so this is actually does
 
00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:50.240 align:start position:0%
for one of a better term level the
 
00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:52.640 align:start position:0%
playing field and try and provide true
 
00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
sexual equality um because what it does
 
00:23:58.149 --> 00:23:58.159 align:start position:0%
is it gives the commonality of remedy
 
00:24:00.549 --> 00:24:00.559 align:start position:0%
because it applies not only to same-sex
 
00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
couples but also applies to uh
 
00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
traditional couples as well now what we
 
00:24:08.789 --> 00:24:08.799 align:start position:0%
do here if you read it
 
00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:11.200 align:start position:0%
we borrow from the felonious sexual
 
00:24:14.149 --> 00:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
assault statute that already exists
 
00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
the one difference here is is that as
 
00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
you read it is is that there has to be
 
00:24:22.149 --> 00:24:22.159 align:start position:0%
intentional touching uh which could be
 
00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
reasonably construed for the purposes of
 
00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
arousal or gratification now that's an
 
00:24:30.149 --> 00:24:30.159 align:start position:0%
important protection because people who
 
00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
have either a laying on of hands for
 
00:24:34.789 --> 00:24:34.799 align:start position:0%
therapeutic reasons which could protect
 
00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:38.480 align:start position:0%
doctors obstetricians gynecologists
 
00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
proctologists and people like that are
 
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
doing that in the course of their
 
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
profession so this could not be
 
00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
construed for that reason
 
00:24:48.789 --> 00:24:48.799 align:start position:0%
so it re so it has a necessary
 
00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
protection in it
 
00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
um you know i'd be happy to entertain
 
00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
any questions the committee may have
 
00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
on this issue
 
00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:04.149 --> 00:25:04.159 align:start position:0%

and that would be
 
00:25:11.919 --> 00:25:13.350 align:start position:0%
and that would be
um

00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:13.360 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chair
 
00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
uh yeah attorney markle um
 
00:25:27.029 --> 00:25:27.039 align:start position:0%
i mean it's not on the uh the same-sex
 
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
issue my question is
 
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.350 align:start position:0%
issue my question is
um

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:32.240 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:35.360 align:start position:0%
i'm married for five years i've been
 
00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
drunk and a drug addict for three
 
00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
i'm in six months recovery
 
00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
could they go back in
 
00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:47.200 align:start position:0%
would that be grounds uh
 
00:25:50.789 --> 00:25:50.799 align:start position:0%
with with this change of two years is it
 
00:25:52.789 --> 00:25:52.799 align:start position:0%
i mean does this assume consecutive
 
00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
years or current
 
00:25:58.149 --> 00:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
well oh okay no i'm sorry yeah well it's
 
00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
basically two years if i read this
 
00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
correctly i think we have two years
 
00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
together oh two or more years okay i see
 
00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
uh now i just had to double check what
 
00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
was written here it's two or more years
 
00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
um it could be separate or it could be
 
00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:13.830 align:start position:0%
um it could be separate or it could be
uh

00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
it could be departed that's that is and
 
00:26:19.269 --> 00:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
that is left to the discretion of the
 
00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
court and that's going to be able to re
 
00:26:24.549 --> 00:26:24.559 align:start position:0%
reduce problems with offers of proof so
 
00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
in your case
 
00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
the issue i think is whether or not
 
00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
you're trying to rehabilitate yourself
 
00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
and you're falling back in there so
 
00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
that's going to be up to a court side
 
00:26:37.029 --> 00:26:37.039 align:start position:0%
uh i if i haven't answered your question
 
00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:38.240 align:start position:0%
please let me know
 
00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
no you have so it's so it's not
 
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.110 align:start position:0%
no you have so it's so it's not
community

00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
can you have a follow up
 
00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:46.240 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you madam chair i do follow
 
00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
up go ahead
 
00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
so so it's not
 
00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:50.870 align:start position:0%
so so it's not
um

00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:53.029 --> 00:26:53.039 align:start position:0%
it's not current and in a row
 
00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
that's correct so uh my other my
 
00:26:57.430 --> 00:26:57.440 align:start position:0%
follow-up is uh
 
00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:59.510 align:start position:0%
follow-up is uh
um

00:26:59.510 --> 00:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
i mean who verifies this what happens if
 
00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:04.400 align:start position:0%
both parties are
 
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
having a drinking problem well then you
 
00:27:08.789 --> 00:27:08.799 align:start position:0%
have yeah okay those are good questions
 
00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:10.640 align:start position:0%
then what you have is the affirmative
 
00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
defense of recrimination let me explain
 
00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:14.789 align:start position:0%
defense of recrimination let me explain
uh

00:27:14.789 --> 00:27:14.799 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:27:16.549 --> 00:27:16.559 align:start position:0%
you have to be it's important to
 
00:27:16.559 --> 00:27:17.830 align:start position:0%
you have to be it's important to
remember

00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
remember
 
00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:20.240 align:start position:0%
that uh to be able to prevail in a
 
00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
fault-based divorce the other party has
 
00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
to be blameless of any conduct that
 
00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:27.440 align:start position:0%
would have taken place which also would
 
00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
have given rise to a fault-based divorce
 
00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
so in other words when you read a
 
00:27:35.269 --> 00:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
divorce when you read rsa 458 7 and
 
00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
you're looking at fault-based divorce it
 
00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
basically says a divorce shall be
 
00:27:41.669 --> 00:27:41.679 align:start position:0%
granted on these grounds to a party for
 
00:27:44.149 --> 00:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
want of a better term uh who is
 
00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
blameless it's innocent party is the way
 
00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
i think it reads and that means you
 
00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:50.400 align:start position:0%
haven't done anything wrong so in other
 
00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
words if we go to court and
 
00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
i say
 
00:27:58.230 --> 00:27:58.240 align:start position:0%
uh you know you've been abusing alcohol
 
00:28:00.789 --> 00:28:00.799 align:start position:0%
or drugs for the last two to
 
00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
two of the last three years
 
00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:06.240 align:start position:0%
and uh you say but judge
 
00:28:08.389 --> 00:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
uh he she has been doing exactly the
 
00:28:11.029 --> 00:28:11.039 align:start position:0%
same thing and you bring the evidence in
 
00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
well that kind of cancels it out that's
 
00:28:15.029 --> 00:28:15.039 align:start position:0%
that's in the law that's an affirmative
 
00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
defense of recrimination
 
00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:20.240 align:start position:0%
okay that's what it's called uh so you
 
00:28:22.149 --> 00:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
can't provide you can't prevail on a
 
00:28:24.389 --> 00:28:24.399 align:start position:0%
fork round that way now the reason it
 
00:28:26.389 --> 00:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
says two or more years i think you can
 
00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
fairly infer
 
00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:30.640 align:start position:0%
um is is that people can have problems
 
00:28:32.669 --> 00:28:32.679 align:start position:0%
in a marriage people can go through
 
00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:35.360 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation in a marriage you know
 
00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
but if it looks like the effort has
 
00:28:39.669 --> 00:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
failed and this does not
 
00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:46.149 --> 00:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
one night of drinking or
 
00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
one night of drinking or even a problem
 
00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:52.240 align:start position:0%
with drinking for a short period of time
 
00:28:53.669 --> 00:28:53.679 align:start position:0%
you know this is going to be at the
 
00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:56.320 align:start position:0%
discretion of the court as these cases
 
00:28:59.590 --> 00:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
often are uh you know did they prove
 
00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
their case is the question
 
00:29:03.269 --> 00:29:03.279 align:start position:0%
so that's where i think you're kind of
 
00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:04.480 align:start position:0%
at with this
 
00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:06.320 align:start position:0%
um if i haven't answered anybody's
 
00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:07.350 align:start position:0%
um if i haven't answered anybody's
question

00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
uh please continue to ask me i'll make
 
00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:11.600 align:start position:0%

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:27.269 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair for taking my
question

00:29:27.269 --> 00:29:27.279 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
i too have concerns regarding the um
 
00:29:36.549 --> 00:29:36.559 align:start position:0%
the alcohol drug abuse section
 
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
what happens if someone so recovery and
 
00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
sobriety are a very fluid situation what
 
00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:45.200 align:start position:0%
happens if someone is
 
00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
actively trying to get sober
 
00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:52.230 align:start position:0%
actively trying to get sober
relapses

00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
where does that fall in here um
 
00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:56.389 align:start position:0%
where does that fall in here um
okay

00:29:56.389 --> 00:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:29:58.230 --> 00:29:58.240 align:start position:0%
very good question and that's really
 
00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
going to be a matter for a court to
 
00:30:02.389 --> 00:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
decide because that's going to be fact
 
00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:04.720 align:start position:0%
specific what we're talking about here
 
00:30:07.669 --> 00:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
is having the grounds to plead we the
 
00:30:07.679 --> 00:30:08.389 align:start position:0%
is having the grounds to plead we the
the

00:30:08.389 --> 00:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:10.559 align:start position:0%
basically this is somebody who's going
 
00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
to be able to say
 
00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
uh your honor this has been the problem
 
00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
in the marriage this is what i think
 
00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
caused the breakdown of the marriage and
 
00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:20.320 align:start position:0%
then you plead your case okay and then
 
00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
the court has to decide so in other
 
00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
words and i have these cases uh where
 
00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
somebody comes in and i have them where
 
00:30:30.149 --> 00:30:30.159 align:start position:0%
somebody's been an alcoholic right now
 
00:30:32.149 --> 00:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
as it stands you can't plead a drug
 
00:30:34.549 --> 00:30:34.559 align:start position:0%
problem because we don't recognize that
 
00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
under the law in new hampshire and i've
 
00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
had those cases
 
00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:38.789 align:start position:0%
had those cases
uh

00:30:38.789 --> 00:30:38.799 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
right now in re uh to be more specific i
 
00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
have two of these cases right now just
 
00:30:46.389 --> 00:30:46.399 align:start position:0%
like this okay somebody goes into rehab
 
00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
somebody comes out they continue
 
00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
drinking again so in other words that's
 
00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
going to be part of the cause of action
 
00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
that you plead it's going to be
 
00:30:55.669 --> 00:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
but judge
 
00:30:55.679 --> 00:30:56.549 align:start position:0%
but judge
uh

00:30:56.549 --> 00:30:56.559 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:30:59.190 --> 00:30:59.200 align:start position:0%
he she went into rehabilitation they
 
00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
tried to clean themselves up but it
 
00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
didn't work they're back to drinking
 
00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
again you know over the last two years
 
00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
he she
 
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
did this went into rehab
 
00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh came out went back to drinking or
 
00:31:15.029 --> 00:31:15.039 align:start position:0%
taking drugs again went into rehab went
 
00:31:17.909 --> 00:31:17.919 align:start position:0%
back in and repeats his cycle has often
 
00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
particularly with drugs which takes
 
00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
place very commonly i've seen those
 
00:31:22.789 --> 00:31:22.799 align:start position:0%
cases too
 
00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
so that's the issue for a court to
 
00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:26.149 align:start position:0%
so that's the issue for a court to
decide

00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
decide
 
00:31:26.159 --> 00:31:27.110 align:start position:0%
decide
uh

00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
that's fact specific
 
00:31:32.389 --> 00:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
two years i think is enough of an
 
00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be able to say you know
 
00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
the marriage is damaged beyond repair
 
00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
and this is the problem that we see in
 
00:31:42.389 --> 00:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
the marriage so we've tried we've lived
 
00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
with it for a while uh this kind of
 
00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
that's that's how i see it um i
 
00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
you know i think it improves the statute
 
00:31:55.909 --> 00:31:55.919 align:start position:0%
particularly with adding the drugs
 
00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
aspect to it because that's really
 
00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
commonplace today
 
00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr markell will you take
 
00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
another question yes i will
 
00:32:09.029 --> 00:32:09.039 align:start position:0%
thank you um representative altschiller
 
00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
you may ask your question
 
00:32:14.549 --> 00:32:14.559 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:18.640 align:start position:0%
uh mr markell for taking my question um
 
00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:20.320 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that you have two cases
 
00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
ongoing right now
 
00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
in your experience how many
 
00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:28.480 align:start position:0%
divorces are found on fault grounds
 
00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:29.430 align:start position:0%
divorces are found on fault grounds
well

00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:29.440 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:32:32.149 --> 00:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
that's fact specific um
 
00:32:36.389 --> 00:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:38.240 align:start position:0%
i can't give you a definitive answer
 
00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
other than to say cases plead okay which
 
00:32:44.149 --> 00:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
is the important thing how they resolve
 
00:32:46.389 --> 00:32:46.399 align:start position:0%
is something different so to directly
 
00:32:48.149 --> 00:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
answer your question do we plead fault
 
00:32:50.789 --> 00:32:50.799 align:start position:0%
grounds yes we plead fault grounds when
 
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
a the client thinks it's important and b
 
00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
if it looks like there's a chance of
 
00:32:59.750 --> 00:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
prevailing but given the fact that um
 
00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
i would say better than 90 of the cases
 
00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
that are filed resolve
 
00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:05.190 align:start position:0%
that are filed resolve
uh

00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:05.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:33:07.269 --> 00:33:07.279 align:start position:0%
people may look at the fall grounds and
 
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
say well in the interest of settling the
 
00:33:11.909 --> 00:33:11.919 align:start position:0%
case and getting other aspects that i
 
00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
want uh i will dismiss on fault grounds
 
00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
uh and they will just go for
 
00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
irreconcilable differences but it's very
 
00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
common practice to affirmatively plead
 
00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
fault grounds in a petition or cross
 
00:33:27.389 --> 00:33:27.399 align:start position:0%
petition for divorce in addition to
 
00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
irreconcilable differences if you have
 
00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:31.110 align:start position:0%
irreconcilable differences if you have
them

00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
one of the less plagued grounds
 
00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
interestingly enough which doesn't
 
00:33:39.269 --> 00:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
figure in here is impotence uh i
 
00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
actually have a case right now where
 
00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
impotence is one of the four grounds
 
00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr markell representative

seeing none i will close the hearing on
 
00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
house bill 142
 
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
and ask
 
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
mr markell to stay on the line
 
00:34:18.149 --> 00:34:18.159 align:start position:0%
so once i introduce house bill 547
 
00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
we can hear from um
 
00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:23.919 align:start position:0%
mr markell and then we have other people
 
00:34:26.470 --> 00:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
to testify so stay tuned

we have eight in support and we had to
 
00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:47.829 align:start position:0%
we have eight in support and we had to
testify

00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
we had zero opposed and zero neutral

thank you for bringing that to my
 
00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
attention representative
 
00:36:58.710 --> 00:36:58.720 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm new at this
 
00:37:01.109 --> 00:37:01.119 align:start position:0%
no worries me too um quick question for
 
00:37:04.069 --> 00:37:04.079 align:start position:0%
you you had just said eight in support
 
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am and i have a sheet here that
 
00:37:09.589 --> 00:37:09.599 align:start position:0%
says 10 in support so is it possible
 
00:37:11.829 --> 00:37:11.839 align:start position:0%
that two more people signed in or they
 
00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
took their names off
 
00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
it's possible that two more signed in
 
00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:18.640 align:start position:0%
since this sheet was printed
 
00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
so that's good for that for you
 
00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:23.440 align:start position:0%
um chairwoman desimone um i did print
 
00:37:25.829 --> 00:37:25.839 align:start position:0%
those um sheets for representative all
 
00:37:27.829 --> 00:37:27.839 align:start position:0%
chiller after you were given yours so it
 
00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
is possible so hers are a little more
 
00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:31.510 align:start position:0%
is possible so hers are a little more
recent

00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
recent
 
00:37:36.069 --> 00:37:36.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:37.750 --> 00:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you anything else

yes
 
00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:26.480 align:start position:0%

yes and i commend all of y'all for
 
00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:39.680 align:start position:0%
dealing with such a difficult subject
 
00:38:41.109 --> 00:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
all day long
 
00:38:43.829 --> 00:38:43.839 align:start position:0%
all year both years long
 
00:38:45.109 --> 00:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
now that i'm on health and human
 
00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
services we have
 
00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
similar concerns
 
00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
house bill 547 is extremely simple
 
00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
and if you had told me this three years
 
00:38:56.790 --> 00:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
ago i wouldn't have believed that it was
 
00:38:59.910 --> 00:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
necessary but since then i have learned
 
00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
that some judges and when i say judges i
 
00:39:05.109 --> 00:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
don't mean all i mean the ones who are
 
00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
doing this
 
00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:07.190 align:start position:0%
doing this
okay

00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
uh i don't by my uh telling you that
 
00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
things need to be improved
 
00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
i do not intend it to mean criticism of
 
00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
everybody in that category but
 
00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
the serious
 
00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:23.440 align:start position:0%
situation is that at least
 
00:39:25.349 --> 00:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
at least some judges
 
00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
are breaking rules
 
00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:32.480 align:start position:0%
ignoring rsas and this one in particular
 
00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
no evidentiary hearing was ever
 
00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:39.990 align:start position:0%
no evidentiary hearing was ever
permitted

00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
permitted
 
00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
to this parent
 
00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
who had serious concerns
 
00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
had documentation of abuse of her child
 
00:39:50.069 --> 00:39:50.079 align:start position:0%
by her
 
00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:52.240 align:start position:0%
assumed to be ex-spouse
 
00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
was never permitted to
 
00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
have the hearing
 
00:39:58.069 --> 00:39:58.079 align:start position:0%
because the judge
 
00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
i'm well i can't say why
 
00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
but i do know that
 
00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:06.720 align:start position:0%
she had been ordered to take her child
 
00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:07.020 align:start position:0%
she had been ordered to take her child
to

00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:07.030 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:08.470 align:start position:0%
to
[Music]

00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:08.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
a supervised visitation
 
00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
with this
 
00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
ex soon-to-be ex-spouse
 
00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
and there was the person who was
 
00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
supposed to supervise it had just been
 
00:40:23.829 --> 00:40:23.839 align:start position:0%
stripped of her credentials for cause
 
00:40:23.839 --> 00:40:24.950 align:start position:0%
stripped of her credentials for cause
and

00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:27.200 align:start position:0%
if that wasn't bad enough the place that
 
00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
they were supposed to meet had none of
 
00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
the protections that are federal and
 
00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
state for making it a safe place
 
00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
there's quite a list of federal and
 
00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
state requirements for safety
 
00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:42.560 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that's probably another
 
00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:43.349 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that's probably another
bill

00:40:43.349 --> 00:40:43.359 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
that uh has
 
00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
i think you all have attempted to get it
 
00:40:49.589 --> 00:40:49.599 align:start position:0%
to get it passed
 
00:40:52.069 --> 00:40:52.079 align:start position:0%
for safe uh i can't remember the real
 
00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
term but it's where you know children
 
00:40:56.069 --> 00:40:56.079 align:start position:0%
can meet with
 
00:40:58.870 --> 00:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
a spouse a parent
 
00:41:01.589 --> 00:41:01.599 align:start position:0%
so she said i can't i can't bring my
 
00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
child there it's dangerous
 
00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:06.400 align:start position:0%
and all i can think is that was the
 
00:41:09.589 --> 00:41:09.599 align:start position:0%
reason that the judge refused to give
 
00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
her an evidentiary hearing
 
00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
and instead
 
00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
ultimately without ever hearing
 
00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
for her
 
00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:21.200 align:start position:0%
gave custody of her daughter
 
00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
to this abusive parent that she had no
 
00:41:28.309 --> 00:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
chance to show how dangerous he was
 
00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
she had to give up everything and leave
 
00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
the state with not much more than the
 
00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
clothes on her back
 
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
so i don't know how many other people
 
00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
have been
 
00:41:42.069 --> 00:41:42.079 align:start position:0%
treated like this
 
00:41:42.079 --> 00:41:42.950 align:start position:0%
treated like this
but

00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
i've had two people
 
00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
uh suggest that it should be amended to
 
00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:49.109 align:start position:0%
uh suggest that it should be amended to
say

00:41:49.109 --> 00:41:49.119 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
that equal this says you know that
 
00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
00:41:57.510 --> 00:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
in any proceeding to determine parental
 
00:41:59.430 --> 00:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
rights and responsibilities
 
00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
each parent is entitled to at least
 
00:42:05.829 --> 00:42:05.839 align:start position:0%
one hearing to present evidence and call
 
00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
witnesses so two people have said one is
 
00:42:11.109 --> 00:42:11.119 align:start position:0%
they ought to say they have equal number
 
00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
of testimonies because
 
00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
often the person has more money
 
00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
can ask for more hearings and pay for
 
00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:18.309 align:start position:0%
can ask for more hearings and pay for
more

00:42:18.309 --> 00:42:18.319 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
and the other person uh an attorney said
 
00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
and no unsupervised visitation
 
00:42:27.589 --> 00:42:27.599 align:start position:0%
until evidentiary hearing is held for
 
00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
both parents
 
00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
so that concludes my my testimony i
 
00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:34.720 align:start position:0%
certainly hope that you can
 
00:42:37.589 --> 00:42:37.599 align:start position:0%
help elaborate on the finer parts of the
 
00:42:37.599 --> 00:42:39.910 align:start position:0%
help elaborate on the finer parts of the
law

00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative gage we have
 
00:42:46.069 --> 00:42:46.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
representative vice chair does uh
 
00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
representative gay have a written

cases
 
00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
i'm here today to testify in opposition
 
00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:03.200 align:start position:0%
to house bill 547
 
00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
i'd like to begin by mentioning that a
 
00:44:06.550 --> 00:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
similar bill was proposed by
 
00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
representative gay last session that was
 
00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
house bill 1270
 
00:44:14.309 --> 00:44:14.319 align:start position:0%
that bill was itled by this committee in
 
00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
a unanimous 19-0 vote
 
00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
house bill 547 seeks to correct a right
 
00:44:23.190 --> 00:44:23.200 align:start position:0%
which is already afforded to every
 
00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
litigant entering the family court
 
00:44:28.069 --> 00:44:28.079 align:start position:0%
system namely the right to seek justice
 
00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:30.400 align:start position:0%
this bill seeks to add a new paragraph
 
00:44:34.390 --> 00:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
for under rsa 461a3
 
00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
but if you look at the existing statute
 
00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
namely paragraph two which reads
 
00:44:41.990 --> 00:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
in cases where husband and wife or unwed
 
00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
parents are living apart the court upon
 
00:44:47.829 --> 00:44:47.839 align:start position:0%
petition of either party may make such
 
00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
order as to parental rights and
 
00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:50.950 align:start position:0%
order as to parental rights and
responsibilities

00:44:50.950 --> 00:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
 
00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:53.200 align:start position:0%
and support of the children
 
00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
as justice may require so upon petition
 
00:44:58.950 --> 00:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
of either party means that one of the
 
00:45:01.270 --> 00:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
parents makes a request to the court to
 
00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
be heard on a particular issue
 
00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
so once that happens the law goes on to
 
00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
say that the court may make such order
 
00:45:09.589 --> 00:45:09.599 align:start position:0%
as to parental rights and
 
00:45:09.599 --> 00:45:11.430 align:start position:0%
as to parental rights and
responsibilities

00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
 
00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
in order for the court to make an order
 
00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
a hearing must be held so to add a
 
00:45:19.270 --> 00:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
fourth paragraph would be redundant and
 
00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
is unnecessary
 
00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
additionally the language of this bill
 
00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
will cause confusion as it states each
 
00:45:27.349 --> 00:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
parent is entitled to at least one
 
00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
hearing so does that mean one hearing
 
00:45:31.950 --> 00:45:31.960 align:start position:0%
per parent do the hearings happen
 
00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
simultaneously where the opposing party
 
00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
has an opportunity to question the other
 
00:45:39.349 --> 00:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
party's witnesses and review evidence
 
00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
or will the court need to schedule a
 
00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
separate hearing to allow the other part
 
00:45:44.829 --> 00:45:44.839 align:start position:0%
the other parent to
 
00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
respond this bill is likely to lead to
 
00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
confusion and is redundant of a right
 
00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
already afforded to family court
 
00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
litigants under the law therefore i
 
00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
respectfully request this committee vote
 
00:45:59.430 --> 00:45:59.440 align:start position:0%

absolutely
i

00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:36.960 align:start position:0%

thank you we have actually three
 
00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
questions um representative long
 
00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:46.720 align:start position:0%
can you unmute yourself and ask your
 
00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:47.829 align:start position:0%
can you unmute yourself and ask your
question

00:46:47.829 --> 00:46:47.839 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
i can thank you madam chair um
 
00:46:56.870 --> 00:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:59.349 --> 00:46:59.359 align:start position:0%
the the bill uh so what you're claiming
 
00:47:02.150 --> 00:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
is the bill is redundant when you uh
 
00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
because it's allowed in 461-a colon
 
00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:06.640 align:start position:0%
three two
 
00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
correct and that's what it looks like
 
00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
that i'm reading here correct yes
 
00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:12.870 align:start position:0%
that i'm reading here correct yes
okay

00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:47:15.109 --> 00:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
you know since we're on these divorces
 
00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
do you feel that if we're gonna change
 
00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
uh you know if we're gonna accept bills
 
00:47:23.349 --> 00:47:23.359 align:start position:0%
or change bills or propose bills
 
00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
that in case in cases where husband and
 
00:47:28.550 --> 00:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
wife language is there
 
00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:29.589 align:start position:0%
wife language is there
uh

00:47:29.589 --> 00:47:29.599 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
should we lose it use that uh you know
 
00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
use this opportunity to fix that or is
 
00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
that being taken care of in the spirit
 
00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
in the supreme court
 
00:47:42.069 --> 00:47:42.079 align:start position:0%
you mean um in the difference between a
 
00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
divorce case um and then just a straight
 
00:47:47.829 --> 00:47:47.839 align:start position:0%
parenting case well from a from a
 
00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
same-sex married parent
 
00:47:52.550 --> 00:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
uh both of us are parents to a child
 
00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
yeah doesn't apply because it's we're
 
00:47:55.589 --> 00:47:55.599 align:start position:0%
not husband and you know we're not
 
00:47:57.430 --> 00:47:57.440 align:start position:0%
husband and wife
 
00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:58.870 align:start position:0%
husband and wife
so

00:47:58.870 --> 00:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:48:01.589 --> 00:48:01.599 align:start position:0%
right so this is just in the parenting
 
00:48:05.349 --> 00:48:05.359 align:start position:0%
statute so if it was um in the if there
 
00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
was a divorce case with kids this would
 
00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
apply as well okay great
 
00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
yeah okay thanks
 
00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:15.200 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh the next
 
00:48:17.349 --> 00:48:17.359 align:start position:0%
question is from uh representative
 
00:48:17.359 --> 00:48:20.630 align:start position:0%
question is from uh representative
altschiller

00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:22.870 --> 00:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you miss
 
00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:26.480 align:start position:0%
miss justina for taking my question if i
 
00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
if i understood your testimony correctly
 
00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:30.870 align:start position:0%
if i understood your testimony correctly
um

00:48:30.870 --> 00:48:30.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
it's yours is it your assertion that
 
00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
this is a due process issue that's
 
00:48:42.069 --> 00:48:42.079 align:start position:0%
already addressed in in the same statute
 
00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for your question so i
 
00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:48.640 align:start position:0%
just to be clear um at any point in the
 
00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:51.839 align:start position:0%
process of filing a parenting petition
 
00:48:54.630 --> 00:48:54.640 align:start position:0%
or a divorce petition there is already a
 
00:48:57.109 --> 00:48:57.119 align:start position:0%
system in place for litigants to seek
 
00:48:59.670 --> 00:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
relief at any point in the process there
 
00:49:02.549 --> 00:49:02.559 align:start position:0%
are multiple hearing phases along the
 
00:49:04.950 --> 00:49:04.960 align:start position:0%
way and there's nothing preventing
 
00:49:07.829 --> 00:49:07.839 align:start position:0%
someone from
 
00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
accessing the court system to get
 
00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
justice so the due process issue is
 
00:49:18.549 --> 00:49:18.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for the clarification
 
00:49:23.589 --> 00:49:23.599 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
thank you miss messina we have one more
 
00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:28.720 align:start position:0%
question representative yokela can you
 
00:49:33.510 --> 00:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:35.589 --> 00:49:35.599 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um
 
00:49:37.829 --> 00:49:37.839 align:start position:0%
i had a question about your statement
 
00:49:39.510 --> 00:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
that there was
 
00:49:43.510 --> 00:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
hearing based on
 
00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:47.349 align:start position:0%
hearing based on
the

00:49:47.349 --> 00:49:47.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
request of either party but it seemed to
 
00:49:52.950 --> 00:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
me by the language that you read
 
00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:53.829 align:start position:0%
me by the language that you read
that

00:49:53.829 --> 00:49:53.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:49:58.549 --> 00:49:58.559 align:start position:0%
they could request um
 
00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
they could say that there is an issue
 
00:50:02.790 --> 00:50:02.800 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't necessarily mean that
 
00:50:07.109 --> 00:50:07.119 align:start position:0%
the court will grant a hearing to
 
00:50:07.119 --> 00:50:08.230 align:start position:0%
the court will grant a hearing to
uh

00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:08.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:50:09.990 --> 00:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
you know have those people submit
 
00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
evidence and testimony et cetera et
 
00:50:16.069 --> 00:50:16.079 align:start position:0%
cetera to that fact they
 
00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
could they could the judge not just
 
00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:19.430 align:start position:0%
could they could the judge not just
decide

00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
decide
 
00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
on the
 
00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:21.829 align:start position:0%
on the
um

00:50:21.829 --> 00:50:21.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:24.150 --> 00:50:24.160 align:start position:0%
the petition alone and not have a
 
00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
hearing is that not the case
 
00:50:30.309 --> 00:50:30.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question so
 
00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
a party would
 
00:50:34.230 --> 00:50:34.240 align:start position:0%
either petition the court through a
 
00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:36.640 align:start position:0%
parenting petition or a divorce petition
 
00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
or if the case is already opened they
 
00:50:41.910 --> 00:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
could file a motion requesting any kind
 
00:50:45.589 --> 00:50:45.599 align:start position:0%
of particular relief it is possible
 
00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
that a judge would um
 
00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
issue an order based on the pleadings
 
00:50:54.230 --> 00:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
alone um it's less likely in my
 
00:50:58.309 --> 00:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
experience um but even in that situation
 
00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
even if the party filed a motion
 
00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
and didn't agree with the judge's
 
00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
decision there is an appeals process you
 
00:51:08.470 --> 00:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
can request a hearing you can request a
 
00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
motion for reconsideration there are
 
00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
multiple steps along the way
 
00:51:15.829 --> 00:51:15.839 align:start position:0%
that would allow for a hearing for a
 
00:51:17.430 --> 00:51:17.440 align:start position:0%
party to be able to present their
 
00:51:20.470 --> 00:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
evidence and present witnesses
 
00:51:22.549 --> 00:51:22.559 align:start position:0%
and even at that point even after a
 
00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
hearing if somebody doesn't like the
 
00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:26.240 align:start position:0%
decision you can appeal all the way to
 
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
the supreme court so there is a process
 
00:51:32.790 --> 00:51:32.800 align:start position:0%
in place to be heard um so for those
 
00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
reasons and as well as the language in
 
00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
existing statute
 
00:51:40.950 --> 00:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
this bill really is not necessary um i
 
00:51:43.510 --> 00:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
can't speak to the particular facts of
 
00:51:45.349 --> 00:51:45.359 align:start position:0%
the case that representative gay
 
00:51:45.359 --> 00:51:46.710 align:start position:0%
the case that representative gay
presented

00:51:46.710 --> 00:51:46.720 align:start position:0%
presented
 
00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
but i can say in my experience that
 
00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
these cases tend to drag on quite long
 
00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
in family court because parties are
 
00:51:58.390 --> 00:51:58.400 align:start position:0%
always getting hearings
 
00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:00.720 align:start position:0%
anyone can request one at any time and
 
00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
it may not be scheduled in a timely
 
00:52:05.430 --> 00:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
manner but one will be scheduled and the
 
00:52:08.549 --> 00:52:08.559 align:start position:0%
parties will be heard
 
00:52:10.549 --> 00:52:10.559 align:start position:0%
do you have a follow-up representative
 
00:52:10.559 --> 00:52:11.670 align:start position:0%
do you have a follow-up representative
yokela

00:52:11.670 --> 00:52:11.680 align:start position:0%
yokela
 
00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:14.950 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
um

00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
you said that there was um an ability to
 
00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:19.910 align:start position:0%
you said that there was um an ability to
appeal

00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
appeal
 
00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:20.950 align:start position:0%
appeal
and

00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:52:24.150 --> 00:52:24.160 align:start position:0%
to question essentially the ruling and
 
00:52:25.829 --> 00:52:25.839 align:start position:0%
do those appeals
 
00:52:25.839 --> 00:52:27.829 align:start position:0%
do those appeals
um

00:52:27.829 --> 00:52:27.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
are is it an option for the judge to
 
00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:34.630 align:start position:0%
are is it an option for the judge to
allow

00:52:34.630 --> 00:52:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:38.240 align:start position:0%
um so it's really i would say it's more
 
00:52:41.430 --> 00:52:41.440 align:start position:0%
a litigant's option um this
 
00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
system is in place
 
00:52:46.870 --> 00:52:46.880 align:start position:0%
for the public
 
00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:48.870 align:start position:0%
for the public
so

00:52:48.870 --> 00:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:52:51.030 --> 00:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
i'll give an example uh you have a
 
00:52:52.790 --> 00:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
temporary hearing
 
00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
and the parties have a temporary hearing
 
00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
and at the end of the temporary hearing
 
00:53:00.309 --> 00:53:00.319 align:start position:0%
the judge decides that
 
00:53:02.230 --> 00:53:02.240 align:start position:0%
both parties should be able to spend
 
00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
time with the kiddo despite there being
 
00:53:07.109 --> 00:53:07.119 align:start position:0%
evidence of abuse
 
00:53:07.119 --> 00:53:07.910 align:start position:0%
evidence of abuse
so

00:53:07.910 --> 00:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:10.720 align:start position:0%
the victim in that case obviously being
 
00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
concerned for the safety of the kiddos
 
00:53:14.549 --> 00:53:14.559 align:start position:0%
and the safety of herself
 
00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
disagrees with the judge's decision
 
00:53:19.109 --> 00:53:19.119 align:start position:0%
maybe she presented evidence maybe the
 
00:53:21.349 --> 00:53:21.359 align:start position:0%
judge misconstrued the law
 
00:53:24.309 --> 00:53:24.319 align:start position:0%
at which point she can file a motion for
 
00:53:24.319 --> 00:53:26.150 align:start position:0%
at which point she can file a motion for
reconsideration

00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
reconsideration
 
00:53:28.630 --> 00:53:28.640 align:start position:0%
and saying all of the reasons why she
 
00:53:31.589 --> 00:53:31.599 align:start position:0%
disagrees and why the judge got it wrong
 
00:53:33.109 --> 00:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
if the judge
 
00:53:34.230 --> 00:53:34.240 align:start position:0%
does not
 
00:53:37.750 --> 00:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
agree at that point there are further
 
00:53:39.829 --> 00:53:39.839 align:start position:0%
levels of appeal
 
00:53:41.910 --> 00:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
including going up to the new hampshire
 
00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:51.829 --> 00:53:51.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:53.349 --> 00:53:53.359 align:start position:0%
sure one more
 
00:53:55.030 --> 00:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:53:57.750 --> 00:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
so what you're saying is that you can
 
00:54:00.069 --> 00:54:00.079 align:start position:0%
request an appeal but it doesn't need to
 
00:54:02.790 --> 00:54:02.800 align:start position:0%
be it doesn't necessarily need to be
 
00:54:04.630 --> 00:54:04.640 align:start position:0%
granted or a hearing doesn't need to be
 
00:54:06.630 --> 00:54:06.640 align:start position:0%
scheduled for any of those appeals they
 
00:54:08.069 --> 00:54:08.079 align:start position:0%
could all just be denied without a
 
00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
hearing is what you're saying if i'm
 
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.309 align:start position:0%
hearing is what you're saying if i'm
understanding

00:54:12.309 --> 00:54:12.319 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
so that's i'm
 
00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
not exactly right so if somebody
 
00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:20.710 align:start position:0%
not exactly right so if somebody
files

00:54:20.710 --> 00:54:20.720 align:start position:0%
files
 
00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:24.720 align:start position:0%
an emotion to reconsider a judge's order
 
00:54:27.829 --> 00:54:27.839 align:start position:0%
you are correct a judge could say
 
00:54:30.630 --> 00:54:30.640 align:start position:0%
that there's not going to be a hearing
 
00:54:33.030 --> 00:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
on that issue i'm denying your motion
 
00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
for reconsideration at which point you
 
00:54:38.470 --> 00:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
have further appeal options and likely
 
00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:40.720 align:start position:0%
at that point there would be some kind
 
00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
of hearing held
 
00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:44.069 align:start position:0%
of hearing held
um

00:54:44.069 --> 00:54:44.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:46.549 --> 00:54:46.559 align:start position:0%
but that's a little bit different than
 
00:54:48.950 --> 00:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
what this law is stating or what this
 
00:54:50.710 --> 00:54:50.720 align:start position:0%
bill is requesting that anyone can
 
00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
request a hearing at any time that is
 
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
already in place
 
00:54:57.829 --> 00:54:57.839 align:start position:0%
um it
 
00:54:57.839 --> 00:54:58.950 align:start position:0%
um it
so

00:54:58.950 --> 00:54:58.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:55:01.030 --> 00:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's confusing because it's really
 
00:55:02.549 --> 00:55:02.559 align:start position:0%
two separate issues whether you're
 
00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
appealing an issue or whether you're
 
00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
requesting relief for a particular legal
 
00:55:09.109 --> 00:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
issue or you're seeking a particular
 
00:55:10.790 --> 00:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
legal outcome
 
00:55:13.030 --> 00:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
in which case that's how the family
 
00:55:15.430 --> 00:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
court is designed to allow litigants to
 
00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
do that and to have the opportunity to
 
00:55:20.230 --> 00:55:20.240 align:start position:0%
be heard
 
00:55:21.510 --> 00:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:55:23.750 --> 00:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for your questions
 
00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:28.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much miss messina um
 
00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
mr markell do you have we have about
 
00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
three minutes before our next bill do
 
00:55:34.390 --> 00:55:34.400 align:start position:0%
you have any input
 
00:55:36.549 --> 00:55:36.559 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh thank you madam vice
 
00:55:39.589 --> 00:55:39.599 align:start position:0%
chair the situation here as i see it is
 
00:55:41.829 --> 00:55:41.839 align:start position:0%
whether or not these your you have a
 
00:55:41.839 --> 00:55:42.710 align:start position:0%
whether or not these your you have a
right

00:55:42.710 --> 00:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:55:45.030 --> 00:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
uh in family court as you do in
 
00:55:47.349 --> 00:55:47.359 align:start position:0%
virtually every court at least in the
 
00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire for notice an
 
00:55:53.270 --> 00:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be heard what you have
 
00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
being heard is fully heard that could
 
00:55:57.589 --> 00:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
mean a hearing and that can mean a right
 
00:56:01.109 --> 00:56:01.119 align:start position:0%
to present evidence and witnesses
 
00:56:03.109 --> 00:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
the questions are and by the way that's
 
00:56:05.430 --> 00:56:05.440 align:start position:0%
i think already enshrined in new
 
00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire case law i'm thinking of
 
00:56:09.430 --> 00:56:09.440 align:start position:0%
cossack off the top of my head but i
 
00:56:12.230 --> 00:56:12.240 align:start position:0%
could be wrong on the site however the
 
00:56:13.750 --> 00:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
question is whether or not this is
 
00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:15.410 align:start position:0%
question is whether or not this is
self-executing

00:56:15.410 --> 00:56:15.420 align:start position:0%
self-executing
 
00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:17.349 align:start position:0%
self-executing
[Music]

00:56:17.349 --> 00:56:17.359 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
and whether this is self-executing uh is
 
00:56:22.870 --> 00:56:22.880 align:start position:0%
a decision the kid the committee has to
 
00:56:24.309 --> 00:56:24.319 align:start position:0%
make so
 
00:56:27.030 --> 00:56:27.040 align:start position:0%
if a person requests a hearing and it's
 
00:56:29.750 --> 00:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
denied then i think you probably have a
 
00:56:31.670 --> 00:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
very good um
 
00:56:35.190 --> 00:56:35.200 align:start position:0%
uh you may have a very good uh
 
00:56:37.589 --> 00:56:37.599 align:start position:0%
denial of due process issue there under
 
00:56:39.829 --> 00:56:39.839 align:start position:0%
the 14th amendment and under the new
 
00:56:42.150 --> 00:56:42.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire constitution as well
 
00:56:44.069 --> 00:56:44.079 align:start position:0%
so that's something this committee is
 
00:56:46.069 --> 00:56:46.079 align:start position:0%
going to have to decide i think
 
00:56:46.079 --> 00:56:47.670 align:start position:0%
going to have to decide i think
um

00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:49.670 --> 00:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
the other thing is just
 
00:56:52.390 --> 00:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
speaking as a practical matter
 
00:56:55.190 --> 00:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
appeals are very expensive tedious and
 
00:56:57.750 --> 00:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
time consuming and not everybody can do
 
00:57:01.030 --> 00:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
it either on a self-represented basis
 
00:57:03.910 --> 00:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
or certainly through an attorney um
 
00:57:05.670 --> 00:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
that's just my brief take on it so it's
 
00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
a decision the committee makes
 
00:57:11.109 --> 00:57:11.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr markell uh representative
 
00:57:13.190 --> 00:57:13.200 align:start position:0%

00:57:27.990 --> 00:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
so i myself am going through family
 
00:57:30.150 --> 00:57:30.160 align:start position:0%
court and if if i understand this
 
00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:31.190 align:start position:0%
court and if if i understand this
correctly

00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:32.069 align:start position:0%
correctly
the

00:57:32.069 --> 00:57:32.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:57:33.829 --> 00:57:33.839 align:start position:0%
appeal process
 
00:57:33.839 --> 00:57:35.829 align:start position:0%
appeal process
um

00:57:35.829 --> 00:57:35.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:35.839 --> 00:57:38.950 align:start position:0%
um
is

00:57:38.950 --> 00:57:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:42.549 --> 00:57:42.559 align:start position:0%
is is can be lengthy so
 
00:57:43.750 --> 00:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
when you
 
00:57:45.430 --> 00:57:45.440 align:start position:0%
when you appeal
 
00:57:48.150 --> 00:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
the motion to reconsider
 
00:57:51.510 --> 00:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
is denied you can appeal to the next uh
 
00:57:54.710 --> 00:57:54.720 align:start position:0%
to the next court correct
 
00:57:57.349 --> 00:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
yes this is um aaron justina yes that is
 
00:57:57.359 --> 00:57:59.270 align:start position:0%
yes this is um aaron justina yes that is
correct

00:57:59.270 --> 00:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
uh follow-up
 
00:58:04.069 --> 00:58:04.079 align:start position:0%
certainly one follow-up
 
00:58:06.789 --> 00:58:06.799 align:start position:0%
so if i can
 
00:58:09.750 --> 00:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
appeal that decision
 
00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:12.470 align:start position:0%
appeal that decision
um

00:58:12.470 --> 00:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:15.430 --> 00:58:15.440 align:start position:0%
what do you have a percentage of cases
 
00:58:17.990 --> 00:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
is there excuse me is there data
 
00:58:20.390 --> 00:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
that supports how many cases
 
00:58:22.390 --> 00:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
are denied upon that
 
00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:23.510 align:start position:0%
are denied upon that
appeal

00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
appeal
 
00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:25.670 align:start position:0%
appeal
and

00:58:25.670 --> 00:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:58:29.430 --> 00:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
is there um in family court
 
00:58:32.549 --> 00:58:32.559 align:start position:0%
is there a requirement that there is a
 
00:58:34.069 --> 00:58:34.079 align:start position:0%
always at least
 
00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
one hearing
 
00:58:39.430 --> 00:58:39.440 align:start position:0%
so there's always going to be one
 
00:58:41.990 --> 00:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
hearing i'll adjust your second um
 
00:58:44.390 --> 00:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
question first there's always going to
 
00:58:47.030 --> 00:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
be one hearing in family court if the
 
00:58:49.349 --> 00:58:49.359 align:start position:0%
party's at least one hearing because
 
00:58:52.069 --> 00:58:52.079 align:start position:0%
that's just the nature of how family
 
00:58:53.910 --> 00:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
court is designed
 
00:58:55.990 --> 00:58:56.000 align:start position:0%
assuming the parties don't wish to
 
00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:57.109 align:start position:0%
assuming the parties don't wish to
settle

00:58:57.109 --> 00:58:57.119 align:start position:0%
settle
 
00:58:59.030 --> 00:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
the case and want to proceed on a
 
00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
litigation track there's going to be
 
00:59:03.190 --> 00:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
first appearance
 
00:59:04.950 --> 00:59:04.960 align:start position:0%
and then there may be a case manager
 
00:59:07.109 --> 00:59:07.119 align:start position:0%
conference and then if the case is not
 
00:59:09.030 --> 00:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
settling you're going to a temporary
 
00:59:10.630 --> 00:59:10.640 align:start position:0%
hearing you're going to get that
 
00:59:12.870 --> 00:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
temporary hearing and then if the case
 
00:59:15.109 --> 00:59:15.119 align:start position:0%
is not settled at that point then you're
 
00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
going to have a pre-trial conference and
 
00:59:18.950 --> 00:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
then after that you're gonna have a
 
00:59:21.990 --> 00:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
final hearing that's the general track
 
00:59:24.870 --> 00:59:24.880 align:start position:0%
that litigated and contested cases take
 
00:59:29.349 --> 00:59:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:32.950 --> 00:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
that's the basic track so in addition to
 
00:59:35.109 --> 00:59:35.119 align:start position:0%
that at any point someone could request
 
00:59:36.950 --> 00:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
a review hearing
 
00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:37.910 align:start position:0%
a review hearing
um

00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:39.670 --> 00:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
you know every three months every six
 
00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
months if the case is going on and on um
 
00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:44.069 align:start position:0%
months if the case is going on and on um
but

00:59:44.069 --> 00:59:44.079 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:59:47.670 --> 00:59:47.680 align:start position:0%
everybody is going to get the temporary
 
00:59:49.270 --> 00:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
hearing possibly the pre-trial
 
00:59:51.829 --> 00:59:51.839 align:start position:0%
conference and the final hearing
 
00:59:52.710 --> 00:59:52.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:59:55.829 --> 00:59:55.839 align:start position:0%

any further questions from any of the
 
01:00:06.470 --> 01:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:10.470 --> 01:00:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:12.549 --> 01:00:12.559 align:start position:0%

um during this hearing uh my video was
 
01:00:42.549 --> 01:00:42.559 align:start position:0%
turned off by the host so i don't know i
 
01:00:44.549 --> 01:00:44.559 align:start position:0%
i probably didn't shave too close this
 
01:00:45.910 --> 01:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
morning but
 
01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:50.240 align:start position:0%

members of the committee
 
01:01:45.030 --> 01:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
i am here today to introduce hb 139
 
01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
relative to uh
 
01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
submission of evidence in divorce
 
01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:51.829 align:start position:0%
submission of evidence in divorce
proceedings

01:01:51.829 --> 01:01:51.839 align:start position:0%
proceedings
 
01:01:56.309 --> 01:01:56.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:57.829 --> 01:01:57.839 align:start position:0%
come back again
 
01:01:59.670 --> 01:01:59.680 align:start position:0%
i it
 
01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:01.030 align:start position:0%
i it
was

01:02:01.030 --> 01:02:01.040 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:02:03.670 --> 01:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
originally i think introduced back in
 
01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:05.190 align:start position:0%
originally i think introduced back in
2018

01:02:05.190 --> 01:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
2018
 
01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
or something like that and passed this
 
01:02:10.630 --> 01:02:10.640 align:start position:0%
committee and got changed in the
 
01:02:13.270 --> 01:02:13.280 align:start position:0%
senate and
 
01:02:15.589 --> 01:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
in the committee of conference died and
 
01:02:18.150 --> 01:02:18.160 align:start position:0%
then last year there was some
 
01:02:21.829 --> 01:02:21.839 align:start position:0%
some minor alterations um
 
01:02:25.589 --> 01:02:25.599 align:start position:0%
and ended up not not passing so i have
 
01:02:28.309 --> 01:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
submitted again today and the main gist
 
01:02:31.270 --> 01:02:31.280 align:start position:0%
of the bill is to
 
01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:32.390 align:start position:0%
of the bill is to
allow

01:02:32.390 --> 01:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
allow
 
01:02:36.309 --> 01:02:36.319 align:start position:0%
for at least five days of
 
01:02:36.319 --> 01:02:38.470 align:start position:0%
for at least five days of
uh

01:02:38.470 --> 01:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:02:41.030 --> 01:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
that evidence being submitted in divorce
 
01:02:43.349 --> 01:02:43.359 align:start position:0%
proceedings be submitted at least five
 
01:02:45.589 --> 01:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
days prior to the hearing so that people
 
01:02:49.190 --> 01:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity to um
 
01:02:51.109 --> 01:02:51.119 align:start position:0%
gather evidence to
 
01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
support their defense so that they are
 
01:02:56.309 --> 01:02:56.319 align:start position:0%
not ambushed at the last second with you
 
01:02:57.910 --> 01:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
know hundreds of
 
01:02:59.990 --> 01:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
pages of
 
01:03:01.430 --> 01:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
evidence that they
 
01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:03.430 align:start position:0%
evidence that they
are

01:03:03.430 --> 01:03:03.440 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:03:09.430 --> 01:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:12.309 --> 01:03:12.319 align:start position:0%
address in the hearing
 
01:03:16.470 --> 01:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
and the amendment last time was to allow
 
01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:18.470 align:start position:0%
and the amendment last time was to allow
for

01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:03:20.069 --> 01:03:20.079 align:start position:0%
in addition to
 
01:03:22.150 --> 01:03:22.160 align:start position:0%
de minimis evidence
 
01:03:24.069 --> 01:03:24.079 align:start position:0%
also to
 
01:03:26.710 --> 01:03:26.720 align:start position:0%
allow an exception to
 
01:03:29.589 --> 01:03:29.599 align:start position:0%
a requested
 
01:03:32.950 --> 01:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
continuance um if such evidence was not
 
01:03:34.549 --> 01:03:34.559 align:start position:0%
available to the party submitting the
 
01:03:37.510 --> 01:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
evidence pre the um five days prior to
 
01:03:39.990 --> 01:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
the hearing so that
 
01:03:45.990 --> 01:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:48.390 --> 01:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
any activities or evidence of activities
 
01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
that happened during that five
 
01:03:55.349 --> 01:03:55.359 align:start position:0%
days prior or it wasn't just available
 
01:03:55.359 --> 01:03:57.270 align:start position:0%
days prior or it wasn't just available
for

01:03:57.270 --> 01:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:03:59.349 --> 01:03:59.359 align:start position:0%
any other reasons so let's say you know
 
01:04:01.430 --> 01:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
what you didn't get it
 
01:04:04.390 --> 01:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
uh in the mail from you know the irs or
 
01:04:06.230 --> 01:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
whatever until the day before the
 
01:04:09.190 --> 01:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
hearing and you want to submit that
 
01:04:12.789 --> 01:04:12.799 align:start position:0%
and uh so what the the point of this
 
01:04:15.670 --> 01:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
bill is is to allow for an automatic
 
01:04:18.390 --> 01:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
continuance if you didn't get those fi
 
01:04:21.270 --> 01:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
that evidence in that five day window
 
01:04:23.510 --> 01:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
so that you have an opportunity to look
 
01:04:24.829 --> 01:04:24.839 align:start position:0%
over it
 
01:04:24.839 --> 01:04:26.470 align:start position:0%
over it
and

01:04:26.470 --> 01:04:26.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:04:29.190 --> 01:04:29.200 align:start position:0%
if the the court denies that
 
01:04:30.710 --> 01:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
that they
 
01:04:33.109 --> 01:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
write down why they're denying it so
 
01:04:34.950 --> 01:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
that you have the reasons that you can
 
01:04:37.029 --> 01:04:37.039 align:start position:0%
appeal based on
 
01:04:39.349 --> 01:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
so i hope you will support this and i'm
 
01:04:45.029 --> 01:04:45.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:55.589 --> 01:04:55.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:58.390 --> 01:04:58.400 align:start position:0%
representative ultra fault shiller you
 
01:04:58.400 --> 01:04:59.349 align:start position:0%
representative ultra fault shiller you
can

01:04:59.349 --> 01:04:59.359 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:05:06.710 --> 01:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:08.470 --> 01:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
01:05:10.309 --> 01:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
representative yokela for taking my
 
01:05:10.319 --> 01:05:11.430 align:start position:0%
representative yokela for taking my
question

01:05:11.430 --> 01:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:05:14.309 --> 01:05:14.319 align:start position:0%
um you just mentioned in your testimony
 
01:05:16.150 --> 01:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
that the in the
 
01:05:18.549 --> 01:05:18.559 align:start position:0%
inspiration for doing this if i
 
01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
understand you was to
 
01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
um to make sure that everyone gets all
 
01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
of the information they need ahead of
 
01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:26.549 align:start position:0%
of the information they need ahead of
time

01:05:26.549 --> 01:05:26.559 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:05:28.309 --> 01:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
before a hearing
 
01:05:31.190 --> 01:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
so that they aren't ambushed i think you
 
01:05:35.109 --> 01:05:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:37.349 --> 01:05:37.359 align:start position:0%
but right now um
 
01:05:41.589 --> 01:05:41.599 align:start position:0%
i believe the time frame is 10 days your
 
01:05:44.549 --> 01:05:44.559 align:start position:0%
this bill would shorten it to five days
 
01:05:46.549 --> 01:05:46.559 align:start position:0%
um but there's nothing
 
01:05:51.430 --> 01:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
here that stops somebody who doesn't
 
01:05:53.109 --> 01:05:53.119 align:start position:0%
abide by
 
01:05:56.309 --> 01:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
any deadline 10 days 12 days 5 days it
 
01:05:56.319 --> 01:05:57.430 align:start position:0%
any deadline 10 days 12 days 5 days it
doesn't

01:05:57.430 --> 01:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
01:05:59.910 --> 01:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
it doesn't stop them and there's no
 
01:06:02.710 --> 01:06:02.720 align:start position:0%
penalty for showing up to court on your
 
01:06:05.190 --> 01:06:05.200 align:start position:0%
court date with a stack of documents yay
 
01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:06.230 align:start position:0%
court date with a stack of documents yay
high

01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
high
 
01:06:07.910 --> 01:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:09.430 align:start position:0%
and then
force

01:06:09.430 --> 01:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
force
 
01:06:11.990 --> 01:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
the other party into making a decision
 
01:06:13.990 --> 01:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
as to whether to continue
 
01:06:15.829 --> 01:06:15.839 align:start position:0%
um because
 
01:06:17.510 --> 01:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
they have waited for months and months
 
01:06:21.270 --> 01:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
and months for a hearing or
 
01:06:24.069 --> 01:06:24.079 align:start position:0%
in continuing the moment or wait yet
 
01:06:27.349 --> 01:06:27.359 align:start position:0%
another 90 days
 
01:06:27.359 --> 01:06:28.710 align:start position:0%
another 90 days
for

01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:06:31.270 --> 01:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
some relief and it seems that this would
 
01:06:33.910 --> 01:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
really negatively impact
 
01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:35.349 align:start position:0%
really negatively impact
um

01:06:35.349 --> 01:06:35.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:37.589 --> 01:06:37.599 align:start position:0%
victims who are
 
01:06:40.390 --> 01:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
you know who are low-income
 
01:06:43.270 --> 01:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
members of our community um because it
 
01:06:45.029 --> 01:06:45.039 align:start position:0%
would it just
 
01:06:46.710 --> 01:06:46.720 align:start position:0%
it puts them between a rock and a hard
 
01:06:48.309 --> 01:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
place anyway
 
01:06:48.319 --> 01:06:49.510 align:start position:0%
place anyway
um

01:06:49.510 --> 01:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:51.750 --> 01:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
and i feel like
 
01:06:54.789 --> 01:06:54.799 align:start position:0%
in cases of alimony and child support
 
01:06:57.750 --> 01:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
that this is an opportunity it's a wedge
 
01:07:00.630 --> 01:07:00.640 align:start position:0%
for abusers to be able to
 
01:07:03.109 --> 01:07:03.119 align:start position:0%
manipulate that system do you have a
 
01:07:05.029 --> 01:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
is there
 
01:07:08.470 --> 01:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
so my question my question is was this
 
01:07:10.870 --> 01:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
part did you consider this
 
01:07:12.549 --> 01:07:12.559 align:start position:0%
when you wrote this and did you have an
 
01:07:14.950 --> 01:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
intention or an amendment forthcoming
 
01:07:19.029 --> 01:07:19.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:21.349 --> 01:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so
 
01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
as you as you stated um there is
 
01:07:27.750 --> 01:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
currently court rules that require
 
01:07:30.870 --> 01:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
them to submit it even even prior to the
 
01:07:33.029 --> 01:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
five days so
 
01:07:33.039 --> 01:07:34.230 align:start position:0%
five days so
so

01:07:34.230 --> 01:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:35.910 align:start position:0%
so
if

01:07:35.910 --> 01:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:07:38.549 --> 01:07:38.559 align:start position:0%
the problem is that exactly as you
 
01:07:40.829 --> 01:07:40.839 align:start position:0%
stated that if people don't abide by
 
01:07:44.710 --> 01:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
that currently there is no
 
01:07:47.829 --> 01:07:47.839 align:start position:0%
punishment necessarily given by the
 
01:07:47.839 --> 01:07:48.789 align:start position:0%
punishment necessarily given by the
judge

01:07:48.789 --> 01:07:48.799 align:start position:0%
judge
 
01:07:50.549 --> 01:07:50.559 align:start position:0%
i mean it's definitely within their
 
01:07:53.829 --> 01:07:53.839 align:start position:0%
prerogative because they're
 
01:07:56.230 --> 01:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
not abiding by court rules but it
 
01:07:57.910 --> 01:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily
 
01:07:59.349 --> 01:07:59.359 align:start position:0%
give any
 
01:07:59.359 --> 01:08:00.470 align:start position:0%
give any
uh

01:08:00.470 --> 01:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:08:02.390 --> 01:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
there is no definitely no punishment
 
01:08:05.670 --> 01:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
automatic uh in that case and it's
 
01:08:07.829 --> 01:08:07.839 align:start position:0%
potentially possible that the judge
 
01:08:08.829 --> 01:08:08.839 align:start position:0%
could wave
 
01:08:12.470 --> 01:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
all uh waive that rule and not put any
 
01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:14.870 align:start position:0%
all uh waive that rule and not put any
uh

01:08:14.870 --> 01:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:18.789 --> 01:08:18.799 align:start position:0%
requirement or grant any recess and
 
01:08:20.950 --> 01:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
insist that the hearing go on at that
 
01:08:24.229 --> 01:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
point and so i think that this bill
 
01:08:26.709 --> 01:08:26.719 align:start position:0%
actually says okay if you've broke the
 
01:08:28.470 --> 01:08:28.480 align:start position:0%
rule so much that you're all the way
 
01:08:30.789 --> 01:08:30.799 align:start position:0%
down to five days
 
01:08:33.510 --> 01:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
and you're giving that testimony or that
 
01:08:35.030 --> 01:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
that submitting that evidence at that
 
01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:36.070 align:start position:0%
that submitting that evidence at that
time

01:08:36.070 --> 01:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
i want to give the person
 
01:08:41.110 --> 01:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
um that is being essentially ambushed
 
01:08:43.349 --> 01:08:43.359 align:start position:0%
yes um
 
01:08:45.349 --> 01:08:45.359 align:start position:0%
the opportunity that they're not
 
01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:47.199 align:start position:0%
currently given
 
01:08:49.990 --> 01:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily by the court to
 
01:08:53.269 --> 01:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
to um continue so i think that this is
 
01:08:54.870 --> 01:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
bill is actually
 
01:08:57.189 --> 01:08:57.199 align:start position:0%
increasing the opportunity and
 
01:08:58.709 --> 01:08:58.719 align:start position:0%
increasing the rights for the person
 
01:09:01.990 --> 01:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
being ambushed and not
 
01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
um reducing their rights
 
01:09:07.189 --> 01:09:07.199 align:start position:0%
i think it's putting you know those that
 
01:09:07.199 --> 01:09:08.390 align:start position:0%
i think it's putting you know those that
uh

01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:09:11.269 --> 01:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
kind of a stop gap in between and saying
 
01:09:13.910 --> 01:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
okay the judge can can waive it if it
 
01:09:16.550 --> 01:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
was six days they can waive their court
 
01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:17.749 align:start position:0%
was six days they can waive their court
rules

01:09:17.749 --> 01:09:17.759 align:start position:0%
rules
 
01:09:20.709 --> 01:09:20.719 align:start position:0%
but if it's four days they really need
 
01:09:24.789 --> 01:09:24.799 align:start position:0%
to give the option to that the person uh
 
01:09:24.799 --> 01:09:25.669 align:start position:0%
to give the option to that the person uh
to

01:09:25.669 --> 01:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
continue the hearing if they need time
 
01:09:30.550 --> 01:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
to prepare their defense or
 
01:09:32.870 --> 01:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
and so i think this is actually helping
 
01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:35.030 align:start position:0%
and so i think this is actually helping
not

01:09:35.030 --> 01:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:09:36.709 --> 01:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
limiting it even further but thank you
 
01:09:42.070 --> 01:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:43.990 --> 01:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative all chiller we
 
01:09:46.070 --> 01:09:46.080 align:start position:0%

representative yokela for bringing this
forward

01:09:53.590 --> 01:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:09:55.669 --> 01:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
um i'm not sure if you're familiar with
 
01:09:58.630 --> 01:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
the court process but um
 
01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
when filing an initial motion for any
 
01:10:02.470 --> 01:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
court proceeding
 
01:10:04.709 --> 01:10:04.719 align:start position:0%
is there a
 
01:10:07.430 --> 01:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
is there a wait time or an expected
 
01:10:09.990 --> 01:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
response requirement
 
01:10:11.910 --> 01:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
before the court can move forward with
 
01:10:14.709 --> 01:10:14.719 align:start position:0%
making a motion
 
01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
excuse me making a decision on that
 
01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:20.709 align:start position:0%
excuse me making a decision on that
motion

01:10:20.709 --> 01:10:20.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:23.910 --> 01:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that i am the best person
 
01:10:26.950 --> 01:10:26.960 align:start position:0%
to answer that question no okay follow
 
01:10:29.110 --> 01:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
up madam chair
 
01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:30.630 align:start position:0%
up madam chair
follow-up

01:10:30.630 --> 01:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:10:31.910 --> 01:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:10:33.590 --> 01:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
and i do have a question here so i
 
01:10:35.350 --> 01:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
apologize and i will keep this part
 
01:10:37.750 --> 01:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
brief but yes there is when you file an
 
01:10:39.910 --> 01:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
initial motion there is a respect of 10
 
01:10:42.550 --> 01:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
days that the other party
 
01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:45.350 align:start position:0%
days that the other party
may

01:10:45.350 --> 01:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
before a court may make a decision on
 
01:10:50.229 --> 01:10:50.239 align:start position:0%
the original motion the other party has
 
01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
at least 10 days before the court can
 
01:10:53.830 --> 01:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
make that decision so
 
01:10:56.950 --> 01:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
if i understand your bill correctly this
 
01:10:59.590 --> 01:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
that is essentially what this is doing
 
01:11:01.830 --> 01:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
um when submitting evidence into court
 
01:11:04.709 --> 01:11:04.719 align:start position:0%
giving them a five or ten day grace
 
01:11:04.719 --> 01:11:05.830 align:start position:0%
giving them a five or ten day grace
period

01:11:05.830 --> 01:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
period
 
01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:06.709 align:start position:0%
period
for

01:11:06.709 --> 01:11:06.719 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:11:08.550 --> 01:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
responding to the evidence presented to
 
01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:10.830 align:start position:0%
responding to the evidence presented to
the

01:11:10.830 --> 01:11:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:13.189 --> 01:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
court thank you
 
01:11:14.950 --> 01:11:14.960 align:start position:0%
for the question
 
01:11:16.229 --> 01:11:16.239 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that that was a question
 
01:11:18.709 --> 01:11:18.719 align:start position:0%
but i will i will address it
 
01:11:22.149 --> 01:11:22.159 align:start position:0%
anyways thank you um i think that so
 
01:11:24.070 --> 01:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
this is only for
 
01:11:27.990 --> 01:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
um not necessarily for um
 
01:11:30.709 --> 01:11:30.719 align:start position:0%
motions this is for in in preparation
 
01:11:33.350 --> 01:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
for a hearing and so it's possible that
 
01:11:35.590 --> 01:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
you could submit a motion you know
 
01:11:37.669 --> 01:11:37.679 align:start position:0%
outside of a hearing but prior to a
 
01:11:37.679 --> 01:11:39.110 align:start position:0%
outside of a hearing but prior to a
hearing

01:11:39.110 --> 01:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:11:42.950 --> 01:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:44.870 --> 01:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
one sure
 
01:11:46.870 --> 01:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
okay sorry so yes it was a question i
 
01:11:49.270 --> 01:11:49.280 align:start position:0%
was asking if your bill
 
01:11:51.669 --> 01:11:51.679 align:start position:0%
pertaining to hearings
 
01:11:51.679 --> 01:11:52.870 align:start position:0%
pertaining to hearings
um

01:11:52.870 --> 01:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:54.950 --> 01:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
is essentially the same is what you're
 
01:11:57.590 --> 01:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish um with the 10-day
 
01:12:02.470 --> 01:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:03.430 --> 01:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:12:05.669 --> 01:12:05.679 align:start position:0%
for the clarification
 
01:12:05.679 --> 01:12:06.390 align:start position:0%
for the clarification
so

01:12:06.390 --> 01:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:12:09.669 --> 01:12:09.679 align:start position:0%
there are rules that say that
 
01:12:12.229 --> 01:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
you're supposed to have just like in the
 
01:12:15.350 --> 01:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
um 10 days to respond to emotion you're
 
01:12:18.630 --> 01:12:18.640 align:start position:0%
supposed to submit um your evidence 10
 
01:12:20.709 --> 01:12:20.719 align:start position:0%
days prior to the hearing that you're
 
01:12:21.990 --> 01:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
going to be submitting to the hearing
 
01:12:23.830 --> 01:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
but that is not always followed and the
 
01:12:25.669 --> 01:12:25.679 align:start position:0%
judge doesn't always
 
01:12:28.470 --> 01:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
give the opportunity for
 
01:12:31.270 --> 01:12:31.280 align:start position:0%
the respondent to be able to adequately
 
01:12:33.910 --> 01:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
adequately prepare to
 
01:12:36.470 --> 01:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
address those that evidence and so this
 
01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
is providing the opportunity
 
01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:41.330 align:start position:0%
for that person to
 
01:12:41.330 --> 01:12:42.550 align:start position:0%
for that person to
[Music]

01:12:42.550 --> 01:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:12:45.430 --> 01:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
have some relief and say i
 
01:12:47.110 --> 01:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
need time to prepare
 
01:12:49.510 --> 01:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of evidence that i am not
 
01:12:51.350 --> 01:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
that i haven't haven't had time to
 
01:12:53.189 --> 01:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
prepare and let's say i'm a pro se
 
01:12:55.189 --> 01:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
litigant and so
 
01:12:58.709 --> 01:12:58.719 align:start position:0%
i need as much time as i can but
 
01:13:00.790 --> 01:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
the the court
 
01:13:03.910 --> 01:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
is required to have that continuance
 
01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:05.669 align:start position:0%
is required to have that continuance
within

01:13:05.669 --> 01:13:05.679 align:start position:0%
within
 
01:13:07.510 --> 01:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
the 90 days and so it's not going to be
 
01:13:10.149 --> 01:13:10.159 align:start position:0%
pushed out at least 90 days it has to be
 
01:13:10.159 --> 01:13:11.270 align:start position:0%
pushed out at least 90 days it has to be
happening

01:13:11.270 --> 01:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
happening
 
01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:12.550 align:start position:0%
happening
um

01:13:12.550 --> 01:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:15.510 --> 01:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
within 90 days so i don't think that
 
01:13:17.189 --> 01:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
it's going to
 
01:13:18.390 --> 01:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
push the
 
01:13:20.390 --> 01:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
hearing out
 
01:13:23.110 --> 01:13:23.120 align:start position:0%
super far it will just give the it's
 
01:13:24.950 --> 01:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
kind of a balance between
 
01:13:27.590 --> 01:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
um originally it was um
 
01:13:29.270 --> 01:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
the continuance would be not more than
 
01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
30 days but the court
 
01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
requested that it be 90 days so that
 
01:13:36.709 --> 01:13:36.719 align:start position:0%
they have time to schedule it and so
 
01:13:38.470 --> 01:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:13:40.630 --> 01:13:40.640 align:start position:0%
not be bogged down so i don't think that
 
01:13:41.669 --> 01:13:41.679 align:start position:0%
is gonna
 
01:13:41.679 --> 01:13:44.630 align:start position:0%
is gonna
um

01:13:44.630 --> 01:13:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:47.110 --> 01:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
i don't think that it is exactly what
 
01:13:48.550 --> 01:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
you're asking
 
01:13:50.709 --> 01:13:50.719 align:start position:0%
but i think it's just
 
01:13:53.350 --> 01:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
them it's meant to give a stop gap and
 
01:13:55.990 --> 01:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
say this person needs these right this
 
01:13:58.830 --> 01:13:58.840 align:start position:0%
right to prepare for their their
 
01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:00.390 align:start position:0%
right to prepare for their their
hearing

01:14:00.390 --> 01:14:00.400 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:14:02.630 --> 01:14:02.640 align:start position:0%
but thank you for the question
 
01:14:03.910 --> 01:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for answering the question
 
01:14:06.950 --> 01:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:09.189 --> 01:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
thank you we have one more question
 
01:14:10.790 --> 01:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
would you be willing to take that
 
01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:12.830 align:start position:0%
would you be willing to take that
question

01:14:12.830 --> 01:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:14.630 align:start position:0%
question
absolutely

01:14:14.630 --> 01:14:14.640 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
representative long go ahead thank you
 
01:14:20.470 --> 01:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
madam chair with respect to the uh
 
01:14:22.630 --> 01:14:22.640 align:start position:0%
with respect to the court
 
01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:25.830 align:start position:0%
with respect to the court
um

01:14:25.830 --> 01:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:28.070 --> 01:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
basis for its you know document that the
 
01:14:29.910 --> 01:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
basis for its finding could it could
 
01:14:31.910 --> 01:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
that basis be uh
 
01:14:33.110 --> 01:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
the minimum
 
01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:36.310 align:start position:0%
the minimum
nature

01:14:36.310 --> 01:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:37.510 --> 01:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:14:41.270 --> 01:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
yes i think that is so yes it could be
 
01:14:43.669 --> 01:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
de minimis and say you know this is the
 
01:14:46.390 --> 01:14:46.400 align:start position:0%
reason why and then you would be able to
 
01:14:48.870 --> 01:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
appeal and say hey it's not the minimus
 
01:14:51.590 --> 01:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
for these xyz reasons and therefore
 
01:14:54.870 --> 01:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
have a motion for uh be able to you know
 
01:14:59.350 --> 01:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
logically argue why why the continuance
 
01:15:01.750 --> 01:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
should have been granted and that they
 
01:15:03.830 --> 01:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
have been you know
 
01:15:05.830 --> 01:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
this this is a miscarriage of justice
 
01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:06.950 align:start position:0%
this this is a miscarriage of justice
essentially

01:15:06.950 --> 01:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
01:15:09.189 --> 01:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
the main reason for having it written is
 
01:15:11.510 --> 01:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
so that you have uh something to base
 
01:15:13.510 --> 01:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
your appeal on
 
01:15:16.630 --> 01:15:16.640 align:start position:0%
i think okay so follow up for me uh
 
01:15:17.830 --> 01:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:18.950 align:start position:0%
madam chair
certainly

01:15:18.950 --> 01:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:19.990 align:start position:0%
certainly
so

01:15:19.990 --> 01:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:15:22.550 --> 01:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
so the um the document can just read the
 
01:15:26.550 --> 01:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:29.510 --> 01:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh in nature and that's that's that's
 
01:15:32.709 --> 01:15:32.719 align:start position:0%
the judge's um
 
01:15:35.110 --> 01:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
document for the basis of his finding
 
01:15:36.950 --> 01:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
that then that's that's sad that the
 
01:15:39.590 --> 01:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
year this bill is okay with
 
01:15:43.110 --> 01:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
thank you we now have uh aaron jacina to
 
01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:47.990 align:start position:0%
thank you we now have uh aaron jacina to
testify

01:15:47.990 --> 01:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
testify
 
01:15:50.070 --> 01:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
can you unmute yourself please miss
 
01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:54.229 align:start position:0%
can you unmute yourself please miss
justina

01:15:54.229 --> 01:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:56.550 --> 01:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam vice chair
 
01:15:59.030 --> 01:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
um so again my name is aaron jusina and
 
01:16:01.189 --> 01:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
i direct the domestic violence advocacy
 
01:16:02.870 --> 01:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
project at new hampshire legal
 
01:16:05.669 --> 01:16:05.679 align:start position:0%
assistance and i'm here today to testify
 
01:16:08.790 --> 01:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
in opposition to house bill 147.
 
01:16:11.830 --> 01:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
as representative yokela mentioned there
 
01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
was an identical or near identical bill
 
01:16:16.470 --> 01:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
proposed last session that was house
 
01:16:18.709 --> 01:16:18.719 align:start position:0%
bill 1103
 
01:16:20.630 --> 01:16:20.640 align:start position:0%
and this committee voted to itl that
 
01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:22.070 align:start position:0%
and this committee voted to itl that
bill

01:16:22.070 --> 01:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:16:24.390 --> 01:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
um so while this bill is well intended
 
01:16:26.310 --> 01:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
and seeks to level the playing field for
 
01:16:28.950 --> 01:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
litigants uh there would be unintended
 
01:16:31.910 --> 01:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
consequences as uh representative alt
 
01:16:34.630 --> 01:16:34.640 align:start position:0%
shiller uh mentioned
 
01:16:37.030 --> 01:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
so if you're thinking about two parties
 
01:16:39.990 --> 01:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
that are scheduled for
 
01:16:42.070 --> 01:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
let's say a temporary hearing
 
01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:43.669 align:start position:0%
let's say a temporary hearing
and

01:16:43.669 --> 01:16:43.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:16:45.030 --> 01:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
one party
 
01:16:46.709 --> 01:16:46.719 align:start position:0%
is a victim of domestic violence the
 
01:16:49.270 --> 01:16:49.280 align:start position:0%
other party is her abuser
 
01:16:53.110 --> 01:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
um he reads this law and says okay well
 
01:16:55.830 --> 01:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
i know how i'm going to continue abusing
 
01:16:57.910 --> 01:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
her and through the court system can't
 
01:17:00.630 --> 01:17:00.640 align:start position:0%
do it in person anymore so i'm going to
 
01:17:03.430 --> 01:17:03.440 align:start position:0%
abuse her through the court system so
 
01:17:05.990 --> 01:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
i've been holding on to this stack of
 
01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
financial records
 
01:17:10.390 --> 01:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to show up to the hearing
 
01:17:12.790 --> 01:17:12.800 align:start position:0%
and i'm unrepresented
 
01:17:14.470 --> 01:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
so the court is really going to give me
 
01:17:16.390 --> 01:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
some extra leeway
 
01:17:17.669 --> 01:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
but i'm going to show up for this
 
01:17:19.350 --> 01:17:19.360 align:start position:0%
hearing with my stack of financial
 
01:17:21.510 --> 01:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
documents because i know she's seeking
 
01:17:24.470 --> 01:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
alimony and child support
 
01:17:25.750 --> 01:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
so she's not going to have time to
 
01:17:27.750 --> 01:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
review any of these records
 
01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:28.630 align:start position:0%
review any of these records
so

01:17:28.630 --> 01:17:28.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:17:30.390 --> 01:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
as representative all chiller said
 
01:17:32.149 --> 01:17:32.159 align:start position:0%
you're really stuck between a rock and a
 
01:17:33.990 --> 01:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
hard place at that point
 
01:17:35.750 --> 01:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
because the victim shows up to court
 
01:17:38.630 --> 01:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
most likely also unrepresented and is
 
01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
just given this stack of financial
 
01:17:44.310 --> 01:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
records and you're not going to be able
 
01:17:46.630 --> 01:17:46.640 align:start position:0%
to go through those and digest those
 
01:17:49.910 --> 01:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
records um five minutes before a hearing
 
01:17:51.270 --> 01:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
you're certainly not going to be able to
 
01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
run a child support calculation or
 
01:17:55.830 --> 01:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
figure out what a temporary alimony
 
01:17:57.350 --> 01:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
award should be
 
01:17:59.189 --> 01:17:59.199 align:start position:0%
um so then you're faced with the fact of
 
01:18:01.590 --> 01:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
okay well i could just go with what i
 
01:18:04.550 --> 01:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
prepared um and ignore what was just
 
01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
handed to me or take his word for it
 
01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
or i can request a continuance which is
 
01:18:12.470 --> 01:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
likely going to be granted if this
 
01:18:14.550 --> 01:18:14.560 align:start position:0%
bill were to become law
 
01:18:16.630 --> 01:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
and now we're looking at a period of not
 
01:18:18.470 --> 01:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
more than 90 days
 
01:18:21.350 --> 01:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
so even if you go out the three months
 
01:18:23.910 --> 01:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
that means for those three months that
 
01:18:25.990 --> 01:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
victim is potentially without child
 
01:18:27.830 --> 01:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
support that victim is potentially
 
01:18:30.870 --> 01:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
without alimony so she's not able to pay
 
01:18:33.030 --> 01:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
her rent she may not be able to pay for
 
01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
her car she's not able to take care of
 
01:18:39.110 --> 01:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
her kids and this is all intentional
 
01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:40.709 align:start position:0%
her kids and this is all intentional
um

01:18:40.709 --> 01:18:40.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:43.669 --> 01:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
from the abuser uh and i do also want to
 
01:18:46.310 --> 01:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
point out that because we're in covid 19
 
01:18:48.950 --> 01:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
right now we're dealing with coping 19
 
01:18:52.390 --> 01:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
the court has issued emergency orders
 
01:18:55.189 --> 01:18:55.199 align:start position:0%
which allows them to extend certain
 
01:18:58.070 --> 01:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
deadlines so right now we're talking
 
01:19:00.229 --> 01:19:00.239 align:start position:0%
about 90 days but
 
01:19:02.310 --> 01:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
for however long these emergency court
 
01:19:04.709 --> 01:19:04.719 align:start position:0%
orders in effect those that 90 days
 
01:19:06.229 --> 01:19:06.239 align:start position:0%
could be out the window and we don't
 
01:19:08.310 --> 01:19:08.320 align:start position:0%
know how long that will be so she may
 
01:19:10.390 --> 01:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
not get a hearing now for six months and
 
01:19:12.790 --> 01:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
that's far too long for a low income
 
01:19:14.790 --> 01:19:14.800 align:start position:0%
person or any person
 
01:19:16.950 --> 01:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
to have to go without some sort of
 
01:19:19.590 --> 01:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
financial relief
 
01:19:22.470 --> 01:19:22.480 align:start position:0%
so that's my concern with the 90 days
 
01:19:24.149 --> 01:19:24.159 align:start position:0%
but then there are other practical
 
01:19:27.030 --> 01:19:27.040 align:start position:0%
considerations related to this bill
 
01:19:28.790 --> 01:19:28.800 align:start position:0%
this bill is seeking to set evidence
 
01:19:31.350 --> 01:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
requirements in the divorce statute but
 
01:19:33.590 --> 01:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
it is not addressing
 
01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:34.950 align:start position:0%
it is not addressing
um

01:19:34.950 --> 01:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:37.830 --> 01:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
evidence requirements under 461a which
 
01:19:38.790 --> 01:19:38.800 align:start position:0%
is the parental rights and
 
01:19:40.950 --> 01:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
responsibility statute
 
01:19:44.149 --> 01:19:44.159 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't address what happens in
 
01:19:46.630 --> 01:19:46.640 align:start position:0%
those emergency type cases
 
01:19:50.550 --> 01:19:50.560 align:start position:0%
where someone files an ex parte motion
 
01:19:52.630 --> 01:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
the court has to
 
01:19:54.709 --> 01:19:54.719 align:start position:0%
have a hearing on those cases within 30
 
01:19:54.719 --> 01:19:55.669 align:start position:0%
have a hearing on those cases within 30
days

01:19:55.669 --> 01:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
days
 
01:19:57.510 --> 01:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
but the respondent has a right to
 
01:20:00.709 --> 01:20:00.719 align:start position:0%
request a hearing within five days so a
 
01:20:02.830 --> 01:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
hearing could be scheduled within two
 
01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:04.390 align:start position:0%
hearing could be scheduled within two
days

01:20:04.390 --> 01:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
days
 
01:20:06.229 --> 01:20:06.239 align:start position:0%
so how does this
 
01:20:09.750 --> 01:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh bill interact with
 
01:20:11.830 --> 01:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
those requirements that are already in
 
01:20:14.950 --> 01:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
place it also would
 
01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:15.830 align:start position:0%
place it also would
trump

01:20:15.830 --> 01:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
trump
 
01:20:18.390 --> 01:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
a number of family court rules which are
 
01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
already in place related to
 
01:20:25.270 --> 01:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
submission of evidence prior to hearings
 
01:20:27.270 --> 01:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
so for those reasons i respectfully
 
01:20:29.270 --> 01:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
request this committee vote in expedient
 
01:20:31.270 --> 01:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
to legislate and i'm happy to take any
 
01:20:35.270 --> 01:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:37.910 --> 01:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
representative alice saying do you have
 
01:20:42.630 --> 01:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:59.189 --> 01:20:59.199 align:start position:0%
okay can you hear me now
 
01:21:01.110 --> 01:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am go ahead
 
01:21:02.630 --> 01:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
it's not a question it's just a
 
01:21:05.189 --> 01:21:05.199 align:start position:0%
statement for the record um the last
 
01:21:07.830 --> 01:21:07.840 align:start position:0%

01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:09.110 align:start position:0%
speaker aaron justina at the very
beginning

01:21:09.110 --> 01:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
beginning
 
01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
beginning of the testimony for
 
01:21:14.950 --> 01:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
139 she stayed at 547
 
01:21:16.709 --> 01:21:16.719 align:start position:0%
but she did speak on
 
01:21:19.830 --> 01:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
but this one was 139 so i just wanted to
 
01:21:21.110 --> 01:21:21.120 align:start position:0%

representative was the year did you have
 
01:21:32.550 --> 01:21:32.560 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
01:21:43.910 --> 01:21:43.920 align:start position:0%

seeing none
 
01:21:46.310 --> 01:21:46.320 align:start position:0%

do you want to testify i sure do
 
01:23:20.149 --> 01:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
my name is alice giordano and i am
 
01:23:22.390 --> 01:23:22.400 align:start position:0%
appalled at some of the things that i
 
01:23:24.390 --> 01:23:24.400 align:start position:0%
heard earlier i have been raising my
 
01:23:27.270 --> 01:23:27.280 align:start position:0%
hand since the beginning of 139
 
01:23:29.669 --> 01:23:29.679 align:start position:0%
um the gross misrepresentation that i've
 
01:23:32.070 --> 01:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
heard in what's really going on in the
 
01:23:35.350 --> 01:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
family courts right now is baffling
 
01:23:37.910 --> 01:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
let's i know that you've passed 139 so
 
01:23:39.830 --> 01:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
i'll be brief i do not have any formal
 
01:23:41.669 --> 01:23:41.679 align:start position:0%
statement i just actually learned of
 
01:23:44.390 --> 01:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
these bills uh this morning
 
01:23:47.510 --> 01:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
um in terms of evidentiary hearings
 
01:23:49.270 --> 01:23:49.280 align:start position:0%
there was a speaker he's absolutely
 
01:23:52.149 --> 01:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
right that is the most fundamental due
 
01:23:54.470 --> 01:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
process right afforded to every american
 
01:23:56.790 --> 01:23:56.800 align:start position:0%
citizen in the united states in a court
 
01:23:57.750 --> 01:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
of law
 
01:23:59.590 --> 01:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
unfortunately in the state of new
 
01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:00.629 align:start position:0%
unfortunately in the state of new
hampshire

01:24:00.629 --> 01:24:00.639 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:24:03.189 --> 01:24:03.199 align:start position:0%
the family court judges have decided on
 
01:24:05.910 --> 01:24:05.920 align:start position:0%
their own that that due process right is
 
01:24:07.270 --> 01:24:07.280 align:start position:0%
an option
 
01:24:09.030 --> 01:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
and if you and if you want to take
 
01:24:11.430 --> 01:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
what's on paper and what's really going
 
01:24:12.950 --> 01:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
on in the courts
 
01:24:15.750 --> 01:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
the difference is mind-blowing it should
 
01:24:17.590 --> 01:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
shock the conscience
 
01:24:19.990 --> 01:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
you have family court judges that are
 
01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.310 align:start position:0%
you have family court judges that are
denying

01:24:22.310 --> 01:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
denying
 
01:24:25.910 --> 01:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
multiple requests people begging for
 
01:24:27.830 --> 01:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
evidentiary hearings
 
01:24:30.790 --> 01:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
and the courts are waving their magic
 
01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:32.550 align:start position:0%
and the courts are waving their magic
wand

01:24:32.550 --> 01:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
wand
 
01:24:35.669 --> 01:24:35.679 align:start position:0%
their judiciary magic wand in a court
 
01:24:37.590 --> 01:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
system that is so unchecked and
 
01:24:40.629 --> 01:24:40.639 align:start position:0%
unbridled that there are crimes literal
 
01:24:42.870 --> 01:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
crimes and i'm not a crackbot i have a
 
01:24:44.470 --> 01:24:44.480 align:start position:0%
background i was a reporter for the
 
01:24:46.790 --> 01:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
national press my child actually
 
01:24:49.430 --> 01:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
attended school with aaron gezina
 
01:24:51.910 --> 01:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
she knows what's going on in the courts
 
01:24:53.590 --> 01:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
she certainly knows that there's
 
01:24:56.950 --> 01:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
problems with due process in my case
 
01:24:59.430 --> 01:24:59.440 align:start position:0%
i had four separate motions for an
 
01:25:01.590 --> 01:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
evidentiary hearing denied you can look
 
01:25:03.750 --> 01:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
at my case the court the judge even
 
01:25:05.990 --> 01:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
quoted himself i'm not interested in
 
01:25:07.669 --> 01:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
hearing any evidence
 
01:25:09.350 --> 01:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
you'll be hearing later in the day about
 
01:25:11.350 --> 01:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
what they're really interested in what
 
01:25:13.510 --> 01:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
they're really interested in in this is
 
01:25:16.390 --> 01:25:16.400 align:start position:0%
this thing called reunification therapy
 
01:25:19.669 --> 01:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
that is lining the pockets excuse me all
 
01:25:22.550 --> 01:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
the appointees excuse me
 
01:25:27.030 --> 01:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
excuse me we're um hearing testimony on
 
01:25:30.470 --> 01:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
um house bill 139 if you want to talk
 
01:25:32.790 --> 01:25:32.800 align:start position:0%
about reunification you're going to have
 
01:25:35.590 --> 01:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
to wait until that bill comes before us
 
01:25:38.070 --> 01:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
so do you have any further comments on
 
01:25:42.390 --> 01:25:42.400 align:start position:0%
house bill 139 yes yes yes i do
 
01:25:44.310 --> 01:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
thank you i'll give you another minute
 
01:25:46.070 --> 01:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
or so thank you
 
01:25:48.709 --> 01:25:48.719 align:start position:0%
this bill is critical to pass because
 
01:25:50.149 --> 01:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
the problem is
 
01:25:52.310 --> 01:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
if it's not explicit
 
01:25:54.310 --> 01:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
then the judges aren't going to do it
 
01:25:56.390 --> 01:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
and sadly in the state of new hampshire
 
01:25:57.990 --> 01:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
you're going to start needing to spell
 
01:26:01.430 --> 01:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
out every little right in writing
 
01:26:03.750 --> 01:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
and and by the way this idea that you
 
01:26:06.629 --> 01:26:06.639 align:start position:0%
can appeal is is just nonsense
 
01:26:09.189 --> 01:26:09.199 align:start position:0%
the only appeal process in the state of
 
01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire unlike other states is in
 
01:26:13.430 --> 01:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
fact the new hampshire state supreme
 
01:26:15.750 --> 01:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
court so the only bite of the apple that
 
01:26:17.189 --> 01:26:17.199 align:start position:0%
families have
 
01:26:19.110 --> 01:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
at getting evidence
 
01:26:21.030 --> 01:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
into the court system
 
01:26:23.830 --> 01:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
is in fact through the due process of
 
01:26:26.070 --> 01:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
the right to submit evidence which is
 
01:26:30.070 --> 01:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
being denied repeatedly and grossly
 
01:26:32.790 --> 01:26:32.800 align:start position:0%
it's rampant it's a rampant problem
 
01:26:34.629 --> 01:26:34.639 align:start position:0%
there are there are cases i know of a
 
01:26:34.639 --> 01:26:35.590 align:start position:0%
there are there are cases i know of a
case

01:26:35.590 --> 01:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
case
 
01:26:37.669 --> 01:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
where the woman showed up with all her
 
01:26:40.390 --> 01:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
her expert witnesses and the judge won't
 
01:26:41.910 --> 01:26:41.920 align:start position:0%
even let him in
 
01:26:44.390 --> 01:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
they are they are grossly denying due
 
01:26:47.110 --> 01:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
process i i i
 
01:26:49.830 --> 01:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
urge this committee to look further into
 
01:26:52.390 --> 01:26:52.400 align:start position:0%
this matter i'm happy i'm an open book i
 
01:26:54.709 --> 01:26:54.719 align:start position:0%
know many many parents who will who will
 
01:26:57.270 --> 01:26:57.280 align:start position:0%
share their records with you to show we
 
01:26:58.870 --> 01:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
even have it in writing that these
 
01:27:00.709 --> 01:27:00.719 align:start position:0%
judges are denying
 
01:27:03.189 --> 01:27:03.199 align:start position:0%
our right our most fundamental right
 
01:27:05.750 --> 01:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
could you imagine being accused of
 
01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:06.870 align:start position:0%
could you imagine being accused of
murder

01:27:06.870 --> 01:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
murder
 
01:27:09.110 --> 01:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
and you go to trial the judge says yeah
 
01:27:10.950 --> 01:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
i don't want to hear any evidence i'm
 
01:27:13.030 --> 01:27:13.040 align:start position:0%
just going to make up my own mind and
 
01:27:14.790 --> 01:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what's happening in the
 
01:27:15.990 --> 01:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
court system in the state of new
 
01:27:17.510 --> 01:27:17.520 align:start position:0%

01:28:59.990 --> 01:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:01.270 align:start position:0%
 
hello

01:29:01.270 --> 01:29:01.280 align:start position:0%
hello
 
01:29:03.750 --> 01:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
go ahead mr marquel thank you
 
01:29:05.270 --> 01:29:05.280 align:start position:0%
typically you have what are called
 
01:29:06.950 --> 01:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
scheduling uh
 
01:29:08.830 --> 01:29:08.840 align:start position:0%
typically when you have temporary
 
01:29:10.550 --> 01:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
hearings uh
 
01:29:12.310 --> 01:29:12.320 align:start position:0%
typically courts will do what they're
 
01:29:14.070 --> 01:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
called is jointly
 
01:29:16.070 --> 01:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
01:29:17.910 --> 01:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
temporary hearings and scheduling
 
01:29:20.790 --> 01:29:20.800 align:start position:0%
conference hearings and this is typical
 
01:29:23.030 --> 01:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
and this is typically where courts
 
01:29:25.110 --> 01:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
listen to the parties try to determine
 
01:29:27.669 --> 01:29:27.679 align:start position:0%
what the issues are in the case
 
01:29:31.030 --> 01:29:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh and then issue discovery deadlines
 
01:29:33.669 --> 01:29:33.679 align:start position:0%
and then also issue usually timing and
 
01:29:36.790 --> 01:29:36.800 align:start position:0%
sequence of exhibits uh and things like
 
01:29:39.590 --> 01:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
that uh typically they're adhered to
 
01:29:41.510 --> 01:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
what this bill i think is well
 
01:29:43.990 --> 01:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
intentioned but it tries to
 
01:29:46.629 --> 01:29:46.639 align:start position:0%
micromanage a court's docket reports
 
01:29:49.110 --> 01:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
typically are able to manage their own
 
01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:50.310 align:start position:0%
typically are able to manage their own
dockets

01:29:50.310 --> 01:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
dockets
 
01:29:53.430 --> 01:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
so uh what you have here is if and the
 
01:29:55.030 --> 01:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
other thing is
 
01:29:56.709 --> 01:29:56.719 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
01:30:00.070 --> 01:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
i i just want to talk to miss wormy okay
 
01:30:03.590 --> 01:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:06.629 --> 01:30:06.639 align:start position:0%
can you hear me
 
01:30:08.709 --> 01:30:08.719 align:start position:0%
she's obviously having technical
 
01:30:11.110 --> 01:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
difficulties i'm going to mute her again
 
01:30:13.350 --> 01:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
and you can go ahead mr markell thank
 
01:30:15.990 --> 01:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
you madam uh so what typically happens
 
01:30:18.390 --> 01:30:18.400 align:start position:0%
is this and i i think what this bill is
 
01:30:20.790 --> 01:30:20.800 align:start position:0%
well intentioned but what i'm hearing
 
01:30:24.390 --> 01:30:24.400 align:start position:0%
here is is that the committee uh is
 
01:30:27.030 --> 01:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
probably maybe asking itself
 
01:30:29.430 --> 01:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
what is the tru what is the trial
 
01:30:31.350 --> 01:30:31.360 align:start position:0%
process like and this is an attempt to
 
01:30:33.990 --> 01:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
manage the trial scheduling process
 
01:30:35.430 --> 01:30:35.440 align:start position:0%
which is typically
 
01:30:37.510 --> 01:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
when it's done correctly
 
01:30:39.910 --> 01:30:39.920 align:start position:0%
is done by the court itself it manages
 
01:30:41.910 --> 01:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
the case from beginning to end so back
 
01:30:44.070 --> 01:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
to the scheduling conference order you
 
01:30:45.910 --> 01:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
can typically find them online on the
 
01:30:47.669 --> 01:30:47.679 align:start position:0%
judicial website and you fill them in
 
01:30:49.669 --> 01:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
and you submit them to the court or the
 
01:30:52.310 --> 01:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
court administers its adminis admits its
 
01:30:54.950 --> 01:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
own so when you look at you'll also find
 
01:30:56.950 --> 01:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
the courts will include timing and
 
01:30:59.189 --> 01:30:59.199 align:start position:0%
sequence of discovery and the court
 
01:31:01.669 --> 01:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
frequently will issue
 
01:31:03.910 --> 01:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
an order for the timing and exchange of
 
01:31:06.790 --> 01:31:06.800 align:start position:0%
exhibits so the parties are to exchange
 
01:31:09.510 --> 01:31:09.520 align:start position:0%
an exhibit by a certain date number one
 
01:31:12.470 --> 01:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
and if they don't then then the and if
 
01:31:15.189 --> 01:31:15.199 align:start position:0%
somebody tries to pay fast and loose
 
01:31:16.790 --> 01:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
with the timing and sequence and
 
01:31:19.270 --> 01:31:19.280 align:start position:0%
exchange of exhibits and the filing of
 
01:31:22.070 --> 01:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
exhibits with the court the remedy can
 
01:31:24.870 --> 01:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
be frequently a
 
01:31:26.790 --> 01:31:26.800 align:start position:0%
motion in lemony which means that's a
 
01:31:29.830 --> 01:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
gatekeeping motion which says judge due
 
01:31:33.110 --> 01:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
to certain prejudice that i'm seeing uh
 
01:31:35.270 --> 01:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
this person submitted these exhibits
 
01:31:38.229 --> 01:31:38.239 align:start position:0%
late and now i'm prejudiced in my
 
01:31:41.510 --> 01:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
ability to pre to uh present my case
 
01:31:44.229 --> 01:31:44.239 align:start position:0%
because because because because they
 
01:31:46.950 --> 01:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
were late because they result uh because
 
01:31:49.590 --> 01:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
they were the result of issues that were
 
01:31:51.590 --> 01:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
either not discussed or previously
 
01:31:54.470 --> 01:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
discussed or not exchanged timely my
 
01:31:56.550 --> 01:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
prejudice is thus and such and such and
 
01:31:59.030 --> 01:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
such and such so then the court looks at
 
01:32:02.550 --> 01:32:02.560 align:start position:0%
it and uh the court decides on the
 
01:32:04.790 --> 01:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
motion whether or not there's prejudice
 
01:32:06.950 --> 01:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
to the other party's case so in other
 
01:32:10.149 --> 01:32:10.159 align:start position:0%
words you could actually be within
 
01:32:13.430 --> 01:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
assuming the bill within that five days
 
01:32:15.030 --> 01:32:15.040 align:start position:0%
but if there's no prejudice to the
 
01:32:17.270 --> 01:32:17.280 align:start position:0%
person's case
 
01:32:19.830 --> 01:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
then it really shouldn't matter
 
01:32:21.669 --> 01:32:21.679 align:start position:0%
and this is typically the way the new
 
01:32:23.669 --> 01:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
hampshire supreme court is going to look
 
01:32:25.910 --> 01:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
at it since courts generally are
 
01:32:28.149 --> 01:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
managing their own trial dockets when
 
01:32:30.229 --> 01:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
you go up on appeal with submission of
 
01:32:33.110 --> 01:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
evidence then the court on appeal is
 
01:32:34.629 --> 01:32:34.639 align:start position:0%
going to look at whether or not it
 
01:32:37.350 --> 01:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
constituted an unsustainable exercise of
 
01:32:39.990 --> 01:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
discretion and within that unsustainable
 
01:32:42.550 --> 01:32:42.560 align:start position:0%
exercise of discretion the new hampshire
 
01:32:44.709 --> 01:32:44.719 align:start position:0%
supreme court would look at it and say
 
01:32:47.990 --> 01:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
okay was there an objective basis in
 
01:32:51.110 --> 01:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
fact or law for the ruling below
 
01:32:53.189 --> 01:32:53.199 align:start position:0%
which said well okay the court decided
 
01:32:54.870 --> 01:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
this and decided this and there was a
 
01:32:57.669 --> 01:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
basis for it that being the case the
 
01:33:00.709 --> 01:33:00.719 align:start position:0%
ruling would be affirmed uh
 
01:33:02.390 --> 01:33:02.400 align:start position:0%
and when you're dealing with the
 
01:33:05.110 --> 01:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
unsustainable exercise of discretion by
 
01:33:07.270 --> 01:33:07.280 align:start position:0%
way of further submitting this to you
 
01:33:08.709 --> 01:33:08.719 align:start position:0%
the question is whether or not you had
 
01:33:10.709 --> 01:33:10.719 align:start position:0%
any prejudice to your case
 
01:33:13.669 --> 01:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
so if somebody walks in with a stack of
 
01:33:15.910 --> 01:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
documents that i heard uh mention you
 
01:33:18.070 --> 01:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
know the morning of trial
 
01:33:20.629 --> 01:33:20.639 align:start position:0%
you know well your honor uh
 
01:33:22.070 --> 01:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
you know just going through this i'm
 
01:33:23.990 --> 01:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
looking at this and i'm prejudiced and
 
01:33:26.790 --> 01:33:26.800 align:start position:0%
if you have a a a good judge and this
 
01:33:29.030 --> 01:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
stuff is all relevant then the judge is
 
01:33:31.270 --> 01:33:31.280 align:start position:0%
going to say that's not coming in
 
01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:32.149 align:start position:0%
going to say that's not coming in
okay

01:33:32.149 --> 01:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:33:32.159 --> 01:33:33.110 align:start position:0%
okay
uh

01:33:33.110 --> 01:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:33:35.270 --> 01:33:35.280 align:start position:0%
you know i'm gonna you know and remember
 
01:33:37.110 --> 01:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
motions can be made
 
01:33:39.430 --> 01:33:39.440 align:start position:0%
written motions have a 10-day threshold
 
01:33:42.390 --> 01:33:42.400 align:start position:0%
as a general's general rule but courts
 
01:33:45.030 --> 01:33:45.040 align:start position:0%
can entertain oral emotions made right
 
01:33:47.030 --> 01:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
on the spot so
 
01:33:48.790 --> 01:33:48.800 align:start position:0%
what we're doing here is that we're
 
01:33:51.830 --> 01:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
looking to manage the court's docket
 
01:33:54.709 --> 01:33:54.719 align:start position:0%
um and manage the courts and manage the
 
01:33:56.709 --> 01:33:56.719 align:start position:0%
courts daca then which has traditionally
 
01:33:58.950 --> 01:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
been an area of regulation by the for
 
01:34:00.390 --> 01:34:00.400 align:start position:0%
the court
 
01:34:03.030 --> 01:34:03.040 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to entertain and offer any
 
01:34:05.030 --> 01:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
experience i have to the committee so
 
01:34:06.709 --> 01:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
the committee can further study this
 
01:34:08.950 --> 01:34:08.960 align:start position:0%
bill or the committee can make a
 
01:34:10.950 --> 01:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
decision on it because this is the kind
 
01:34:13.189 --> 01:34:13.199 align:start position:0%
of thing that i think requires somebody
 
01:34:13.199 --> 01:34:13.990 align:start position:0%
of thing that i think requires somebody
with

01:34:13.990 --> 01:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:34:16.950 --> 01:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
some knowledge a trial
 
01:34:20.070 --> 01:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
how the system is managed uh judicial
 
01:34:22.390 --> 01:34:22.400 align:start position:0%
experience case management and so forth
 
01:34:25.030 --> 01:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
so taken in isolation i don't see where
 
01:34:27.189 --> 01:34:27.199 align:start position:0%
it helps no matter how well but i get
 
01:34:29.910 --> 01:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
how well intentioned it is and i get the
 
01:34:31.750 --> 01:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
the frustration in it i certainly can
 
01:34:34.470 --> 01:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
see that um if there are any questions
 
01:34:36.550 --> 01:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to answer
 
01:34:39.830 --> 01:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr markell i currently do not
 
01:34:42.629 --> 01:34:42.639 align:start position:0%

richard would you like to testify on uh
 
01:36:42.070 --> 01:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
house bill 139
 
01:36:44.950 --> 01:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
i would um thank you madam chair for the
 
01:36:46.629 --> 01:36:46.639 align:start position:0%
record my name is richard head i'm the
 
01:36:48.629 --> 01:36:48.639 align:start position:0%
government affairs coordinator for the
 
01:36:51.910 --> 01:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
judicial branch i do it before i testify
 
01:36:53.430 --> 01:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
though i do have a question regarding
 
01:36:55.669 --> 01:36:55.679 align:start position:0%
the registration because i did register
 
01:36:57.910 --> 01:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
yesterday for
 
01:37:01.270 --> 01:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
um the last bill 547 this one and the
 
01:37:02.950 --> 01:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
next three
 
01:37:05.350 --> 01:37:05.360 align:start position:0%
and that appears not to have made it to
 
01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:06.550 align:start position:0%
and that appears not to have made it to
your

01:37:06.550 --> 01:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:37:08.229 --> 01:37:08.239 align:start position:0%
to your list
 
01:37:08.239 --> 01:37:10.229 align:start position:0%
to your list
so

01:37:10.229 --> 01:37:10.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:37:12.629 --> 01:37:12.639 align:start position:0%
i'll keep you in mind as we get to those
 
01:37:15.109 --> 01:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
bills please stay tuned
 
01:37:16.070 --> 01:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:17.189 align:start position:0%
thank you
and

01:37:17.189 --> 01:37:17.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:37:19.270 --> 01:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
i've had a couple issues with the
 
01:37:21.189 --> 01:37:21.199 align:start position:0%
registration where i've registered and
 
01:37:23.430 --> 01:37:23.440 align:start position:0%
it's not made the list but thank you for
 
01:37:25.030 --> 01:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
the consideration
 
01:37:27.350 --> 01:37:27.360 align:start position:0%
um again my name is richard head
 
01:37:31.590 --> 01:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
testifying on house bill 139
 
01:37:33.590 --> 01:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
we do have uh it and we're testifying
 
01:37:35.350 --> 01:37:35.360 align:start position:0%
for information we do have some concerns
 
01:37:37.350 --> 01:37:37.360 align:start position:0%
though with this bill it does create
 
01:37:39.669 --> 01:37:39.679 align:start position:0%
direct conflicts with existing court
 
01:37:39.679 --> 01:37:40.629 align:start position:0%
direct conflicts with existing court
rules

01:37:40.629 --> 01:37:40.639 align:start position:0%
rules
 
01:37:43.910 --> 01:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh in the timing of of evidence
 
01:37:46.229 --> 01:37:46.239 align:start position:0%
evidentiary disclosure
 
01:37:48.790 --> 01:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
as attorney markell had mentioned there
 
01:37:51.910 --> 01:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
are currently rules that set up
 
01:37:55.669 --> 01:37:55.679 align:start position:0%
deadlines um within the court process
 
01:37:57.990 --> 01:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
uh final pre-trials are scheduled where
 
01:37:59.750 --> 01:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
witness and exhibit lists are to be
 
01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:01.590 align:start position:0%
witness and exhibit lists are to be
exchanged

01:38:01.590 --> 01:38:01.600 align:start position:0%
exchanged
 
01:38:04.229 --> 01:38:04.239 align:start position:0%
this bill would conflict with existing
 
01:38:05.590 --> 01:38:05.600 align:start position:0%
court rules
 
01:38:08.629 --> 01:38:08.639 align:start position:0%
and in in general as as you would
 
01:38:11.590 --> 01:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
have probably heard in in other years
 
01:38:13.590 --> 01:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
you know there are concerns
 
01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:14.950 align:start position:0%
you know there are concerns
with

01:38:14.950 --> 01:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:38:18.870 --> 01:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
legislating court rules we do have
 
01:38:20.470 --> 01:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
a rules committee in which two
 
01:38:22.790 --> 01:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
legislators sit a senator and a
 
01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:24.470 align:start position:0%
legislators sit a senator and a
representative

01:38:24.470 --> 01:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:38:26.629 --> 01:38:26.639 align:start position:0%
and really if there are
 
01:38:28.709 --> 01:38:28.719 align:start position:0%
rule changes that
 
01:38:31.590 --> 01:38:31.600 align:start position:0%
legislators are interested in presenting
 
01:38:34.870 --> 01:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
it's really through that rules committee
 
01:38:37.030 --> 01:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
that court rules are established so
 
01:38:38.070 --> 01:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
things that
 
01:38:40.629 --> 01:38:40.639 align:start position:0%
set deadlines within the court system
 
01:38:40.639 --> 01:38:41.430 align:start position:0%
set deadlines within the court system
for

01:38:41.430 --> 01:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:38:44.709 --> 01:38:44.719 align:start position:0%
exhibits witnesses things like that are
 
01:38:47.669 --> 01:38:47.679 align:start position:0%
are really within the purview of the
 
01:38:50.070 --> 01:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
court rules process
 
01:38:52.310 --> 01:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
um but we do have of some significant
 
01:38:54.950 --> 01:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
concerns relative to conflicts as to
 
01:38:54.960 --> 01:38:55.990 align:start position:0%
concerns relative to conflicts as to
which

01:38:55.990 --> 01:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:38:58.950 --> 01:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
would apply a statute or a rule
 
01:39:00.950 --> 01:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
and this would create some some direct
 
01:39:03.350 --> 01:39:03.360 align:start position:0%
conflicts with existing rules
 
01:39:04.950 --> 01:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
and as you also heard from a prior
 
01:39:07.109 --> 01:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
speaker you know once you set a rule
 
01:39:09.590 --> 01:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
like this it can be then used
 
01:39:12.070 --> 01:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
to manipulate the process
 
01:39:13.910 --> 01:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
and we would have some concerns about
 
01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:15.109 align:start position:0%
and we would have some concerns about
that

01:39:15.109 --> 01:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:39:15.119 --> 01:39:15.910 align:start position:0%
that
where

01:39:15.910 --> 01:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:39:19.030 --> 01:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
an exhibit or evidence may be
 
01:39:21.270 --> 01:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
delayed deliberately by a party
 
01:39:25.109 --> 01:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
in order to effect a delay of proceeding
 
01:39:26.629 --> 01:39:26.639 align:start position:0%
so with that i'd be happy to answer any
 
01:39:26.639 --> 01:39:27.830 align:start position:0%
so with that i'd be happy to answer any
questions

01:39:27.830 --> 01:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:39:29.430 --> 01:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
and i appreciate your time today thank
 
01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:32.550 align:start position:0%
and i appreciate your time today thank
you

01:39:32.550 --> 01:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:35.109 --> 01:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
thank you representative long you have a
 
01:39:35.119 --> 01:39:37.830 align:start position:0%
thank you representative long you have a
question

01:39:37.830 --> 01:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:39.669 --> 01:39:39.679 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh
 
01:39:41.590 --> 01:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
thank you uh mr head
 
01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:42.870 align:start position:0%
thank you uh mr head
um

01:39:42.870 --> 01:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:44.709 --> 01:39:44.719 align:start position:0%
i mean we're here in testimony and we've
 
01:39:47.030 --> 01:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
heard testimony and
 
01:39:48.950 --> 01:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
other uh
 
01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:52.310 align:start position:0%
other uh
um

01:39:52.310 --> 01:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:54.709 --> 01:39:54.719 align:start position:0%
you know and on other bills with respect
 
01:39:57.350 --> 01:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
to the judges not allowing
 
01:39:57.360 --> 01:39:58.070 align:start position:0%
to the judges not allowing
um

01:39:58.070 --> 01:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:00.870 --> 01:40:00.880 align:start position:0%
do you have a percentage or an estimate
 
01:40:02.229 --> 01:40:02.239 align:start position:0%
has to
 
01:40:03.590 --> 01:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
how many
 
01:40:08.629 --> 01:40:08.639 align:start position:0%
um how many of these requests are denied
 
01:40:10.390 --> 01:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
so not something that would be tracked
 
01:40:12.470 --> 01:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
specifically as as you can imagine you
 
01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:13.189 align:start position:0%
specifically as as you can imagine you
know

01:40:13.189 --> 01:40:13.199 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:40:15.510 --> 01:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
these are very very busy
 
01:40:15.520 --> 01:40:17.430 align:start position:0%
these are very very busy
court

01:40:17.430 --> 01:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
court
 
01:40:18.390 --> 01:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
so the
 
01:40:18.400 --> 01:40:19.189 align:start position:0%
so the
the

01:40:19.189 --> 01:40:19.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:40:21.030 --> 01:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
and evidence is
 
01:40:23.669 --> 01:40:23.679 align:start position:0%
is being you know evidentiary
 
01:40:25.590 --> 01:40:25.600 align:start position:0%
admission is are being asked all the
 
01:40:27.109 --> 01:40:27.119 align:start position:0%
time you know you get it within the
 
01:40:29.510 --> 01:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
context of the precise rules
 
01:40:32.070 --> 01:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
or you get people who show up and for
 
01:40:35.430 --> 01:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
the first time at a at a final hearing
 
01:40:38.149 --> 01:40:38.159 align:start position:0%
are coming in with with various
 
01:40:40.790 --> 01:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
pieces of evidence or witnesses
 
01:40:43.270 --> 01:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
that you know are not within
 
01:40:46.229 --> 01:40:46.239 align:start position:0%
the way the court had laid out the case
 
01:40:48.550 --> 01:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
so those are you know those can be
 
01:40:50.470 --> 01:40:50.480 align:start position:0%
denied they can be granted depending on
 
01:40:52.149 --> 01:40:52.159 align:start position:0%
the circumstances a great deal of
 
01:40:52.159 --> 01:40:53.350 align:start position:0%
the circumstances a great deal of
discretion

01:40:53.350 --> 01:40:53.360 align:start position:0%
discretion
 
01:40:55.910 --> 01:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
is afforded
 
01:40:57.510 --> 01:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
because you really have to take into
 
01:40:59.590 --> 01:40:59.600 align:start position:0%
consideration the nature of the evidence
 
01:41:01.430 --> 01:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
when it was produced
 
01:41:03.510 --> 01:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
what is the
 
01:41:05.350 --> 01:41:05.360 align:start position:0%
what is the schedule that all the
 
01:41:07.910 --> 01:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
parties are required to abide by that
 
01:41:10.550 --> 01:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
was set by the court
 
01:41:13.109 --> 01:41:13.119 align:start position:0%
how often have there been violations of
 
01:41:13.119 --> 01:41:13.990 align:start position:0%
how often have there been violations of
that

01:41:13.990 --> 01:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:41:16.070 --> 01:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
so the short answer to your question is
 
01:41:18.390 --> 01:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
we do not track individual
 
01:41:21.109 --> 01:41:21.119 align:start position:0%
evidentiary decisions
 
01:41:24.229 --> 01:41:24.239 align:start position:0%
on on each case
 
01:41:27.590 --> 01:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
just by sheer volume and
 
01:41:29.590 --> 01:41:29.600 align:start position:0%
the speed at which these decisions are
 
01:41:32.070 --> 01:41:32.080 align:start position:0%
being made
 
01:41:32.080 --> 01:41:33.350 align:start position:0%
being made
but

01:41:33.350 --> 01:41:33.360 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:41:36.070 --> 01:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
if evidence is being presented within
 
01:41:40.229 --> 01:41:40.239 align:start position:0%
the structuring conference order the
 
01:41:44.629 --> 01:41:44.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:46.790 --> 01:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
presentation of witnesses and exhibits
 
01:41:48.470 --> 01:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
and they're appropriately before the
 
01:41:51.109 --> 01:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
court they're typically heard
 
01:41:55.189 --> 01:41:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:56.310 --> 01:41:56.320 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
01:41:58.790 --> 01:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
thank you i yeah it would be very
 
01:42:00.950 --> 01:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
helpful to this committee because as you
 
01:42:00.960 --> 01:42:01.830 align:start position:0%
helpful to this committee because as you
hear

01:42:01.830 --> 01:42:01.840 align:start position:0%
hear
 
01:42:03.590 --> 01:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
in testimony
 
01:42:05.109 --> 01:42:05.119 align:start position:0%
it is never
 
01:42:05.119 --> 01:42:06.229 align:start position:0%
it is never
allowed

01:42:06.229 --> 01:42:06.239 align:start position:0%
allowed
 
01:42:08.310 --> 01:42:08.320 align:start position:0%
i you know we have people saying that
 
01:42:09.510 --> 01:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
saying that it
 
01:42:11.430 --> 01:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
they are never allowed so
 
01:42:13.430 --> 01:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
it would help me in determining some
 
01:42:15.109 --> 01:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
determining some of this
 
01:42:17.350 --> 01:42:17.360 align:start position:0%
um what
 
01:42:18.709 --> 01:42:18.719 align:start position:0%
what it you know
 
01:42:20.550 --> 01:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
i i gotta weigh both sides i got
 
01:42:23.990 --> 01:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
constituents coming to testify saying
 
01:42:25.750 --> 01:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
it never happens
 
01:42:27.750 --> 01:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
and and then i've got the court the
 
01:42:29.750 --> 01:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
judicial branch saying
 
01:42:31.109 --> 01:42:31.119 align:start position:0%
well yeah you know what happens
 
01:42:33.750 --> 01:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes and but i'm not sure how often
 
01:42:36.790 --> 01:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
uh so it really would be helpful to try
 
01:42:39.750 --> 01:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
to get that balance um and i you know i
 
01:42:42.070 --> 01:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
understand that it's short notice for
 
01:42:45.189 --> 01:42:45.199 align:start position:0%
you to have the answer today but
 
01:42:47.510 --> 01:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
that that would be nice to know
 
01:42:50.470 --> 01:42:50.480 align:start position:0%
um that there are
 
01:42:52.629 --> 01:42:52.639 align:start position:0%
there are predominantly uh
 
01:42:54.149 --> 01:42:54.159 align:start position:0%
you know uh
 
01:42:54.159 --> 01:42:54.950 align:start position:0%
you know uh
uh

01:42:54.950 --> 01:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:42:56.790 --> 01:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
emotions being heard
 
01:42:59.510 --> 01:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
01:43:01.910 --> 01:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
and and thank you for that i to the
 
01:43:03.830 --> 01:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
extent we can drill down and certainly
 
01:43:06.470 --> 01:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
you know we just simply don't have
 
01:43:09.270 --> 01:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
evidentiary decision tracking
 
01:43:09.280 --> 01:43:10.629 align:start position:0%
evidentiary decision tracking
capacity

01:43:10.629 --> 01:43:10.639 align:start position:0%
capacity
 
01:43:14.070 --> 01:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
our system just simply doesn't do that
 
01:43:16.229 --> 01:43:16.239 align:start position:0%
i would i would significantly dispute
 
01:43:18.709 --> 01:43:18.719 align:start position:0%
that never happened certainly people are
 
01:43:22.070 --> 01:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
upset at times with decisions being made
 
01:43:22.080 --> 01:43:22.830 align:start position:0%
upset at times with decisions being made
by

01:43:22.830 --> 01:43:22.840 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:43:24.870 --> 01:43:24.880 align:start position:0%
courts and
 
01:43:27.270 --> 01:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
may extrapolate out from that that their
 
01:43:29.430 --> 01:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
experience is the way
 
01:43:31.590 --> 01:43:31.600 align:start position:0%
the courts always act
 
01:43:35.189 --> 01:43:35.199 align:start position:0%
which is not correct we you know
 
01:43:38.229 --> 01:43:38.239 align:start position:0%
very very much follow the court the
 
01:43:40.790 --> 01:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
rules the procedures that are set out
 
01:43:43.189 --> 01:43:43.199 align:start position:0%
and the orders that are issued in each
 
01:43:45.590 --> 01:43:45.600 align:start position:0%
case in terms of procedure and those are
 
01:43:48.390 --> 01:43:48.400 align:start position:0%
followed and evidence is being presented
 
01:43:50.870 --> 01:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
every day in family court witnesses are
 
01:43:53.189 --> 01:43:53.199 align:start position:0%
being heard every day in family court
 
01:43:53.199 --> 01:43:54.070 align:start position:0%
being heard every day in family court
and

01:43:54.070 --> 01:43:54.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:43:55.590 --> 01:43:55.600 align:start position:0%
you know the normal practice and
 
01:43:55.600 --> 01:43:57.109 align:start position:0%
you know the normal practice and
procedure

01:43:57.109 --> 01:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
01:44:00.070 --> 01:44:00.080 align:start position:0%
applies there are circumstances where
 
01:44:01.990 --> 01:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
somebody believes they're being treated
 
01:44:04.550 --> 01:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
unfairly when in fact you know they the
 
01:44:04.560 --> 01:44:05.750 align:start position:0%
unfairly when in fact you know they the
rules

01:44:05.750 --> 01:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
rules
 
01:44:07.750 --> 01:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
were not being followed and
 
01:44:11.030 --> 01:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
you know it just happens sometimes um
 
01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:12.229 align:start position:0%
you know it just happens sometimes um
and

01:44:12.229 --> 01:44:12.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:44:15.189 --> 01:44:15.199 align:start position:0%
into you those individual cases
 
01:44:18.550 --> 01:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
um are not representative of all of the
 
01:44:22.070 --> 01:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
cases really each circumstance is very
 
01:44:25.510 --> 01:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
fact specific and very timing specific
 
01:44:27.430 --> 01:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
in each one of those circumstances has
 
01:44:33.350 --> 01:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:36.149 --> 01:44:36.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr head uh
 
01:44:40.070 --> 01:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
any further questions from mr head
 
01:44:42.470 --> 01:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
representative lewicki uh madame chad
 
01:44:45.109 --> 01:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
this is more of a point of information
 
01:44:47.910 --> 01:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
but uh ms wermer sent us testimony on
 
01:44:50.629 --> 01:44:50.639 align:start position:0%
547 and as part of that she included the
 
01:44:52.870 --> 01:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
form which includes scheduling and a
 
01:44:54.070 --> 01:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
whole lot of other stuff and i think
 
01:44:55.430 --> 01:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
that would be very informative to the
 
01:44:55.440 --> 01:44:57.189 align:start position:0%
that would be very informative to the
committee

01:44:57.189 --> 01:44:57.199 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:45:00.950 --> 01:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:03.669 --> 01:45:03.679 align:start position:0%
so it has come to my attention obviously
 
01:45:03.679 --> 01:45:04.470 align:start position:0%
so it has come to my attention obviously
that

01:45:04.470 --> 01:45:04.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:45:06.950 --> 01:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
some of the people who are attendees
 
01:45:08.470 --> 01:45:08.480 align:start position:0%
that would like
 
01:45:11.910 --> 01:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
to testify on certain bills
 
01:45:14.229 --> 01:45:14.239 align:start position:0%
are not on my list
 
01:45:17.189 --> 01:45:17.199 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason their testimony and
 
01:45:20.149 --> 01:45:20.159 align:start position:0%
your testimony is very important to all
 
01:45:21.350 --> 01:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
of us
 
01:45:23.830 --> 01:45:23.840 align:start position:0%
please if you choose to
 
01:45:26.709 --> 01:45:26.719 align:start position:0%
testify on a particular bill and i do
 
01:45:29.189 --> 01:45:29.199 align:start position:0%
not call your name please raise your
 
01:45:32.709 --> 01:45:32.719 align:start position:0%
hand and i will call on you
 
01:45:34.950 --> 01:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
we cannot make proper
 
01:45:37.910 --> 01:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh decisions on any bill without hearing
 
01:45:41.270 --> 01:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
all sides of the testimony so i ask you
 
01:45:43.750 --> 01:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
to indulge me and please raise your hand
 
01:45:45.430 --> 01:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
if we're on a particular bill and you
 
01:45:48.229 --> 01:45:48.239 align:start position:0%
would like to testify you cannot ask
 
01:45:52.950 --> 01:45:52.960 align:start position:0%
questions again but you can and are
 
01:45:55.750 --> 01:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
hopefully going to testify and please
 
01:45:58.790 --> 01:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
always remember to submit written
 
01:46:01.990 --> 01:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
testimony for our records so we can go
 
01:46:03.590 --> 01:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
over it when we
 
01:46:06.790 --> 01:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
um exec these bills i want to thank you
 
01:46:08.950 --> 01:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
and with that i will close question
 
01:46:10.790 --> 01:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
madam chair with respect to what you
 
01:46:13.430 --> 01:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
said i'm sorry representative long go
 
01:46:15.910 --> 01:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
ahead uh yeah i
 
01:46:17.990 --> 01:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
i mean with respect to the rule reading
 
01:46:21.590 --> 01:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
the covet 19 if people aren't able to
 
01:46:23.430 --> 01:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
um testify
 
01:46:24.950 --> 01:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh then
 
01:46:27.990 --> 01:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
we would have to redo this um and my
 
01:46:29.510 --> 01:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
understanding is that there were people
 
01:46:31.189 --> 01:46:31.199 align:start position:0%
that were signed up to testify that
 
01:46:32.709 --> 01:46:32.719 align:start position:0%
didn't testify
 
01:46:35.109 --> 01:46:35.119 align:start position:0%
um so i don't know if if i just want to
 
01:46:37.430 --> 01:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
make sure we're on the up and up
 
01:46:39.430 --> 01:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
uh when the public's saying that they
 
01:46:41.510 --> 01:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
can't testify
 
01:46:41.520 --> 01:46:42.870 align:start position:0%
can't testify
uh

01:46:42.870 --> 01:46:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:46:45.109 --> 01:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
you know the emergency order says with
 
01:46:47.109 --> 01:46:47.119 align:start position:0%
respect to this remote that we would
 
01:46:50.629 --> 01:46:50.639 align:start position:0%
redo it um so i don't know if mr dyer
 
01:46:54.149 --> 01:46:54.159 align:start position:0%
can just get that clarification for us
 
01:46:56.709 --> 01:46:56.719 align:start position:0%
thank you christina can you clarify that
 
01:47:03.270 --> 01:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:05.669 --> 01:47:05.679 align:start position:0%
i know she's on another working on
 
01:47:07.830 --> 01:47:07.840 align:start position:0%
another committee as well
 
01:47:09.910 --> 01:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
it was my mistake
 
01:47:11.430 --> 01:47:11.440 align:start position:0%
not to
 
01:47:12.790 --> 01:47:12.800 align:start position:0%
hear those
 
01:47:15.590 --> 01:47:15.600 align:start position:0%
because they're not on my list
 
01:47:19.430 --> 01:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh for house bill 139 i had
 
01:47:22.870 --> 01:47:22.880 align:start position:0%
only one person signed up
 
01:47:25.669 --> 01:47:25.679 align:start position:0%
to testify
 
01:47:30.149 --> 01:47:30.159 align:start position:0%
on house bill 547 i only had one person
 
01:47:31.350 --> 01:47:31.360 align:start position:0%
signed up
 
01:47:33.270 --> 01:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
to testify
 
01:47:38.790 --> 01:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
on house bill 142 i only had one person
 
01:47:41.990 --> 01:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
signed up to testify i understand that
 
01:47:43.830 --> 01:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
people's names are in
 
01:47:46.470 --> 01:47:46.480 align:start position:0%
the attendees list
 
01:47:48.870 --> 01:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
but i cannot
 
01:47:51.430 --> 01:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
there's no way for me to discern
 
01:47:54.229 --> 01:47:54.239 align:start position:0%
what bill they want to testify on or not
 
01:47:56.790 --> 01:47:56.800 align:start position:0%
i'm trying my best
 
01:48:00.629 --> 01:48:00.639 align:start position:0%
and i do agree that their testimony is
 
01:48:03.750 --> 01:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
extremely important and they do have a
 
01:48:06.790 --> 01:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
right to testify but they did not sign
 
01:48:08.629 --> 01:48:08.639 align:start position:0%
up prior to
 
01:48:10.070 --> 01:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
01:48:13.270 --> 01:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:15.910 --> 01:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
as soon as i can get in touch with um
 
01:48:15.920 --> 01:48:17.189 align:start position:0%
as soon as i can get in touch with um

01:48:17.189 --> 01:48:17.199 align:start position:0%
christina
 
01:48:19.910 --> 01:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
i will have her discuss that for you
 
01:48:21.910 --> 01:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
does that work for you representative
 
01:48:23.990 --> 01:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
long yeah that's fine it just seems like
 
01:48:25.430 --> 01:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
there's mis
 
01:48:27.350 --> 01:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:48:30.149 --> 01:48:30.159 align:start position:0%
yeah there's miscommunication
 
01:48:31.990 --> 01:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
it's internal is what i'm saying it's
 
01:48:35.350 --> 01:48:35.360 align:start position:0%
internal so it's not that they can't
 
01:48:35.360 --> 01:48:36.310 align:start position:0%
internal so it's not that they can't
uh

01:48:36.310 --> 01:48:36.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:48:39.030 --> 01:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
they can't get into testifying
 
01:48:41.510 --> 01:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
they can get in to testify they just
 
01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:42.310 align:start position:0%
they can get in to testify they just
haven't

01:48:42.310 --> 01:48:42.320 align:start position:0%
haven't
 
01:48:44.950 --> 01:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
signed up right
 
01:48:46.470 --> 01:48:46.480 align:start position:0%
so people
 
01:48:48.629 --> 01:48:48.639 align:start position:0%
people out there need to know that they
 
01:48:50.709 --> 01:48:50.719 align:start position:0%
need to sign up
 
01:48:52.310 --> 01:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
in order to
 
01:48:54.629 --> 01:48:54.639 align:start position:0%
be on my list
 
01:48:56.550 --> 01:48:56.560 align:start position:0%
to testify
 
01:48:59.109 --> 01:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
uh and i'll talk with christina and have
 
01:49:02.070 --> 01:49:02.080 align:start position:0%
her uh discuss that with you after
 
01:49:04.470 --> 01:49:04.480 align:start position:0%
representative ocala
 
01:49:08.229 --> 01:49:08.239 align:start position:0%
yes um so normally at the end after we
 
01:49:10.470 --> 01:49:10.480 align:start position:0%
do all of the people that signed up
 
01:49:13.109 --> 01:49:13.119 align:start position:0%
they they move the chair moves on to
 
01:49:15.430 --> 01:49:15.440 align:start position:0%
hear people that didn't sign up but are
 
01:49:17.590 --> 01:49:17.600 align:start position:0%
raising their hand and i think that was
 
01:49:20.149 --> 01:49:20.159 align:start position:0%
the step that might have been missed in
 
01:49:22.470 --> 01:49:22.480 align:start position:0%
earlier ones and that was the cause of
 
01:49:24.310 --> 01:49:24.320 align:start position:0%
the frustration so as long as we're
 
01:49:26.390 --> 01:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
doing that going forward i think the
 
01:49:29.510 --> 01:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
issue will be resolved thank you i stand
 
01:49:29.520 --> 01:49:34.470 align:start position:0%
issue will be resolved thank you i stand
corrected

01:49:34.470 --> 01:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:41.270 --> 01:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:44.629 --> 01:49:44.639 align:start position:0%
thank you uh in that case we will move
 
01:49:44.639 --> 01:49:45.669 align:start position:0%
thank you uh in that case we will move
on

01:49:45.669 --> 01:49:45.679 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:49:45.679 --> 01:49:46.470 align:start position:0%
on
to

01:49:46.470 --> 01:49:46.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:49:47.870 --> 01:49:47.880 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
01:49:53.669 --> 01:49:53.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:56.790 --> 01:49:56.800 align:start position:0%
state ordered counseling and i'll ask
 
01:50:00.470 --> 01:50:00.480 align:start position:0%

01:50:37.189 --> 01:50:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:39.669 --> 01:50:39.679 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry representative gay i excellent
 
01:50:42.310 --> 01:50:42.320 align:start position:0%
accidentally muted you please go on
 
01:50:45.750 --> 01:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:47.750 --> 01:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
yes you are okay
 
01:50:50.629 --> 01:50:50.639 align:start position:0%
uh yes i was thanking you um
 
01:50:52.550 --> 01:50:52.560 align:start position:0%
this 556
 
01:50:55.990 --> 01:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
was passed last year and it passed it
 
01:50:58.070 --> 01:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
was the second bill we heard on the very
 
01:50:59.669 --> 01:50:59.679 align:start position:0%
last day we met
 
01:51:02.149 --> 01:51:02.159 align:start position:0%
in march and so it never made it to the
 
01:51:02.159 --> 01:51:03.189 align:start position:0%
in march and so it never made it to the
senate

01:51:03.189 --> 01:51:03.199 align:start position:0%
senate
 
01:51:06.470 --> 01:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh this is probably the most all i think
 
01:51:09.109 --> 01:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
all my bills will serve
 
01:51:11.590 --> 01:51:11.600 align:start position:0%
victims of domestic abuse this is
 
01:51:13.669 --> 01:51:13.679 align:start position:0%
probably the most
 
01:51:16.310 --> 01:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
important one
 
01:51:18.950 --> 01:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say reunification therapy
 
01:51:18.960 --> 01:51:20.390 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say reunification therapy
because

01:51:20.390 --> 01:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:51:22.149 --> 01:51:22.159 align:start position:0%
uh you could do the same therapy and
 
01:51:23.910 --> 01:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
call it something else the important
 
01:51:27.270 --> 01:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
thing is that any any kind of counseling
 
01:51:30.629 --> 01:51:30.639 align:start position:0%
that the state uh orders should be one
 
01:51:33.270 --> 01:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
that is legitimate that has training
 
01:51:35.510 --> 01:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
that has certification that has a
 
01:51:39.030 --> 01:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
certified uh cpt uh trying to remember
 
01:51:41.910 --> 01:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
what cpt means but all your medical
 
01:51:44.870 --> 01:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
procedures have a procedure name
 
01:51:50.550 --> 01:51:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:52.229 --> 01:51:52.239 align:start position:0%
let's see
 
01:51:54.149 --> 01:51:54.159 align:start position:0%
if all parties
 
01:51:55.750 --> 01:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
if all let's see
 
01:51:58.310 --> 01:51:58.320 align:start position:0%
child welfare services i'm so sorry i'm
 
01:52:00.070 --> 01:52:00.080 align:start position:0%
so nervous because this is so important
 
01:52:02.310 --> 01:52:02.320 align:start position:0%
to me nothing in this chapter and any
 
01:52:03.990 --> 01:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
other provision of law shall permit a
 
01:52:06.709 --> 01:52:06.719 align:start position:0%
state agency including the state courts
 
01:52:09.109 --> 01:52:09.119 align:start position:0%
or a public or private provider acting
 
01:52:11.910 --> 01:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
on behalf of a state agency to require
 
01:52:14.390 --> 01:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
individuals to participate in counseling
 
01:52:17.669 --> 01:52:17.679 align:start position:0%
that has no cpt medical code and thus is
 
01:52:20.070 --> 01:52:20.080 align:start position:0%
not a recognized form of mental health
 
01:52:22.790 --> 01:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
treatment nor eligible for insurance
 
01:52:25.430 --> 01:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
reimbursements so the victims of abuse
 
01:52:28.390 --> 01:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
suffer in two ways number one there's an
 
01:52:31.350 --> 01:52:31.360 align:start position:0%
rsa that says you are not the state does
 
01:52:34.629 --> 01:52:34.639 align:start position:0%
not force you to be with your abuser
 
01:52:36.470 --> 01:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
but this does
 
01:52:39.270 --> 01:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
uh they'll order what they call
 
01:52:42.149 --> 01:52:42.159 align:start position:0%
reunification therapy which sounds great
 
01:52:44.790 --> 01:52:44.800 align:start position:0%
until you find out it's part of this
 
01:52:47.750 --> 01:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
not our beloved gardener but uh a
 
01:52:50.629 --> 01:52:50.639 align:start position:0%
richard gardner who in 1985
 
01:52:53.189 --> 01:52:53.199 align:start position:0%
convinced an awful lot of people in
 
01:52:56.550 --> 01:52:56.560 align:start position:0%
court to adopt this really sick theory
 
01:52:58.790 --> 01:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
that has been totally debunked
 
01:53:01.990 --> 01:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
repeatedly by professional child
 
01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:03.430 align:start position:0%
repeatedly by professional child
psychologists

01:53:03.430 --> 01:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
psychologists
 
01:53:06.070 --> 01:53:06.080 align:start position:0%
children who are abused do not make up
 
01:53:06.080 --> 01:53:07.109 align:start position:0%
children who are abused do not make up
stories

01:53:07.109 --> 01:53:07.119 align:start position:0%
stories
 
01:53:09.750 --> 01:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
parents may try to get kids to say
 
01:53:09.760 --> 01:53:10.790 align:start position:0%
parents may try to get kids to say
things

01:53:10.790 --> 01:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:53:14.390 --> 01:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
but if some a genuine counselor can talk
 
01:53:16.070 --> 01:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
with that child
 
01:53:18.629 --> 01:53:18.639 align:start position:0%
if they start describing
 
01:53:18.639 --> 01:53:20.149 align:start position:0%
if they start describing
uh

01:53:20.149 --> 01:53:20.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:53:22.070 --> 01:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
well sexual abuse is one of the most
 
01:53:24.390 --> 01:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
awful ones and unfortunately it really
 
01:53:26.709 --> 01:53:26.719 align:start position:0%
happens and some people have a hard time
 
01:53:29.270 --> 01:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
accepting that parents can do
 
01:53:32.149 --> 01:53:32.159 align:start position:0%
something so awful to their children but
 
01:53:33.189 --> 01:53:33.199 align:start position:0%
they do
 
01:53:35.510 --> 01:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
and when children can account that they
 
01:53:37.350 --> 01:53:37.360 align:start position:0%
didn't make it up
 
01:53:40.629 --> 01:53:40.639 align:start position:0%
um so that is very totally accepted
 
01:53:43.589 --> 01:53:43.599 align:start position:0%
among professionals
 
01:53:43.599 --> 01:53:44.830 align:start position:0%
among professionals
counselors

01:53:44.830 --> 01:53:44.840 align:start position:0%
counselors
 
01:53:44.840 --> 01:53:46.629 align:start position:0%
counselors
toxicologists

01:53:46.629 --> 01:53:46.639 align:start position:0%
toxicologists
 
01:53:50.390 --> 01:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
in not only our country this sick theory
 
01:53:50.400 --> 01:53:51.669 align:start position:0%
in not only our country this sick theory
that

01:53:51.669 --> 01:53:51.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:53:53.350 --> 01:53:53.360 align:start position:0%
child abuse
 
01:53:56.629 --> 01:53:56.639 align:start position:0%
of that the parent who reports abuse
 
01:53:58.390 --> 01:53:58.400 align:start position:0%
is the cause
 
01:53:59.750 --> 01:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
and therefore
 
01:54:02.149 --> 01:54:02.159 align:start position:0%
the children aren't believed
 
01:54:04.390 --> 01:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
the parents of
 
01:54:06.870 --> 01:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
asking for help with the courts are not
 
01:54:09.750 --> 01:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
believed are there blamed this is what
 
01:54:12.550 --> 01:54:12.560 align:start position:0%
the worst they're blamed for the child
 
01:54:15.669 --> 01:54:15.679 align:start position:0%
having a bad uh relationship with the
 
01:54:18.709 --> 01:54:18.719 align:start position:0%
abusive parent and sadly this sick
 
01:54:21.350 --> 01:54:21.360 align:start position:0%
theory has spread to england
 
01:54:23.669 --> 01:54:23.679 align:start position:0%
and has spread to australia i have
 
01:54:26.390 --> 01:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
listened online i've listened to
 
01:54:28.390 --> 01:54:28.400 align:start position:0%
professional discussions
 
01:54:30.470 --> 01:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
where some people are hoping that it's
 
01:54:32.229 --> 01:54:32.239 align:start position:0%
going away well it hadn't gone away and
 
01:54:35.189 --> 01:54:35.199 align:start position:0%
it's alive and well here i hope to gosh
 
01:54:37.510 --> 01:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
that it's not prevalent in the state of
 
01:54:39.589 --> 01:54:39.599 align:start position:0%
new hampshire but it certainly is
 
01:54:41.990 --> 01:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
prevalent in the courts that people that
 
01:54:44.070 --> 01:54:44.080 align:start position:0%
i have been trying to help have had to
 
01:54:44.080 --> 01:54:45.830 align:start position:0%
i have been trying to help have had to
endure

01:54:45.830 --> 01:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
endure
 
01:54:49.350 --> 01:54:49.360 align:start position:0%
um let's see um so they they suffer both
 
01:54:51.109 --> 01:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
ways one is that they're forced to be
 
01:54:53.990 --> 01:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
with the abuser and the other horrible
 
01:54:55.109 --> 01:54:55.119 align:start position:0%
thing is
 
01:54:58.149 --> 01:54:58.159 align:start position:0%
they are stripped penniless because this
 
01:55:00.790 --> 01:55:00.800 align:start position:0%
is not a professional accepted form of
 
01:55:00.800 --> 01:55:02.229 align:start position:0%
is not a professional accepted form of
counseling

01:55:02.229 --> 01:55:02.239 align:start position:0%
counseling
 
01:55:05.589 --> 01:55:05.599 align:start position:0%
insurance doesn't cover it but the women
 
01:55:07.669 --> 01:55:07.679 align:start position:0%
mostly it's women but we know there are
 
01:55:10.470 --> 01:55:10.480 align:start position:0%
cases of men being in abusive situations
 
01:55:12.550 --> 01:55:12.560 align:start position:0%
who are working desperately to protect
 
01:55:14.310 --> 01:55:14.320 align:start position:0%
their children
 
01:55:15.750 --> 01:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
they are told
 
01:55:18.629 --> 01:55:18.639 align:start position:0%
if you fight this and if you don't do
 
01:55:22.310 --> 01:55:22.320 align:start position:0%
participate and bring your child to this
 
01:55:22.320 --> 01:55:23.270 align:start position:0%
participate and bring your child to this
this

01:55:23.270 --> 01:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:55:23.280 --> 01:55:25.109 align:start position:0%
this
therapy

01:55:25.109 --> 01:55:25.119 align:start position:0%
therapy
 
01:55:27.750 --> 01:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to give we're going to give
 
01:55:30.310 --> 01:55:30.320 align:start position:0%
custody of these children
 
01:55:33.589 --> 01:55:33.599 align:start position:0%
to the abuser and that is part of the
 
01:55:36.790 --> 01:55:36.800 align:start position:0%
plan that is in writing and uh i will
 
01:55:39.109 --> 01:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
send you the link so if you find
 
01:55:40.790 --> 01:55:40.800 align:start position:0%
whatever time you find
 
01:55:43.510 --> 01:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
you can uh see it in
 
01:55:43.520 --> 01:55:45.669 align:start position:0%
you can uh see it in
in

01:55:45.669 --> 01:55:45.679 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:55:47.589 --> 01:55:47.599 align:start position:0%
on testimony
 
01:55:50.149 --> 01:55:50.159 align:start position:0%
uh where one of the uh richard dakoti is
 
01:55:52.629 --> 01:55:52.639 align:start position:0%
a famous attorney not famous here but in
 
01:55:55.430 --> 01:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
pennsylvania and louisiana uh and he is
 
01:55:57.109 --> 01:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
famous for his writings about dealing
 
01:55:59.990 --> 01:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
with abuse in court and he got one of
 
01:56:01.350 --> 01:56:01.360 align:start position:0%
the followers
 
01:56:03.910 --> 01:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
to spill the beans in court i shouldn't
 
01:56:06.470 --> 01:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
use such a cutesy term but he really
 
01:56:08.390 --> 01:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
spelled it out because this gardener guy
 
01:56:10.790 --> 01:56:10.800 align:start position:0%
really believed in sex with children and
 
01:56:13.030 --> 01:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
then he derived this and a whole lot of
 
01:56:15.910 --> 01:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
abusers loved his his theories about oh
 
01:56:18.310 --> 01:56:18.320 align:start position:0%
it's always the protective parents fault
 
01:56:20.629 --> 01:56:20.639 align:start position:0%
that this child doesn't want to be with
 
01:56:22.390 --> 01:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
the abusive parent
 
01:56:25.109 --> 01:56:25.119 align:start position:0%
and it's because because the
 
01:56:27.910 --> 01:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
parent who reported it obviously is a
 
01:56:30.790 --> 01:56:30.800 align:start position:0%
bad parent then custody goes to the
 
01:56:34.470 --> 01:56:34.480 align:start position:0%
abuser and sadly that's happening here
 
01:56:35.910 --> 01:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:56:38.950 --> 01:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
so they get hurt twice oh some women i
 
01:56:41.189 --> 01:56:41.199 align:start position:0%
know and so many of them are scared to
 
01:56:43.750 --> 01:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
death i've sent you testimony i can send
 
01:56:44.709 --> 01:56:44.719 align:start position:0%
it again
 
01:56:44.719 --> 01:56:45.589 align:start position:0%
it again
five

01:56:45.589 --> 01:56:45.599 align:start position:0%
five
 
01:56:48.310 --> 01:56:48.320 align:start position:0%
five uh testimony type five written
 
01:56:50.470 --> 01:56:50.480 align:start position:0%
testimonies that i gave out last year
 
01:56:50.480 --> 01:56:51.669 align:start position:0%
testimonies that i gave out last year
too

01:56:51.669 --> 01:56:51.679 align:start position:0%
too
 
01:56:53.189 --> 01:56:53.199 align:start position:0%
they can't even say their name because
 
01:56:55.189 --> 01:56:55.199 align:start position:0%
they've been threatened that if they do
 
01:56:57.750 --> 01:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
anything that makes the gal or the
 
01:57:00.310 --> 01:57:00.320 align:start position:0%
therapist or the judge angry
 
01:57:01.589 --> 01:57:01.599 align:start position:0%
they know what's going to happen to them
 
01:57:03.910 --> 01:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
they're going to lose custody so it's
 
01:57:03.920 --> 01:57:05.350 align:start position:0%
they're going to lose custody so it's
coercive

01:57:05.350 --> 01:57:05.360 align:start position:0%
coercive
 
01:57:07.189 --> 01:57:07.199 align:start position:0%
it's threatening it's not like any
 
01:57:08.950 --> 01:57:08.960 align:start position:0%
counseling you've ever heard of it
 
01:57:10.790 --> 01:57:10.800 align:start position:0%
sounds more like
 
01:57:14.229 --> 01:57:14.239 align:start position:0%
being in a north korean prison camp uh
 
01:57:15.830 --> 01:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
in interrogation
 
01:57:17.750 --> 01:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
it's that bad but you can make up your
 
01:57:21.350 --> 01:57:21.360 align:start position:0%
own mind the testimony is there
 
01:57:23.990 --> 01:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
women have said and it was two women who
 
01:57:26.470 --> 01:57:26.480 align:start position:0%
said this to me they said to the court i
 
01:57:28.229 --> 01:57:28.239 align:start position:0%
can't afford this with no insurance
 
01:57:32.030 --> 01:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
coverage it costs anywhere from 150 to
 
01:57:36.070 --> 01:57:36.080 align:start position:0%
350 an hour and it is common for them to
 
01:57:39.270 --> 01:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
be ordered two hours a week
 
01:57:40.709 --> 01:57:40.719 align:start position:0%
for months
 
01:57:42.790 --> 01:57:42.800 align:start position:0%
so they've said
 
01:57:44.470 --> 01:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
i can't afford this
 
01:57:46.390 --> 01:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
and they were told
 
01:57:49.109 --> 01:57:49.119 align:start position:0%
not on the record they were told your
 
01:57:50.629 --> 01:57:50.639 align:start position:0%
parents can
 
01:57:53.430 --> 01:57:53.440 align:start position:0%
there's one woman who would i'm sure
 
01:57:55.910 --> 01:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
she'd love to testify and i'll make sure
 
01:57:57.830 --> 01:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
she sends you hers
 
01:57:59.350 --> 01:57:59.360 align:start position:0%
her testimony
 
01:58:02.270 --> 01:58:02.280 align:start position:0%
her parents have paid out over
 
01:58:07.109 --> 01:58:07.119 align:start position:0%
500 000 dollars
 
01:58:10.229 --> 01:58:10.239 align:start position:0%
because they are so afraid of letting
 
01:58:12.709 --> 01:58:12.719 align:start position:0%
the their grandchildren be
 
01:58:15.350 --> 01:58:15.360 align:start position:0%
removed to their abusive parent other
 
01:58:17.270 --> 01:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
parents home
 
01:58:17.280 --> 01:58:18.709 align:start position:0%
parents home

i i'll send you testimony because you
 
01:58:23.910 --> 01:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
know this could go this could go on
 
01:58:26.310 --> 01:58:26.320 align:start position:0%
forever but this is a cancer in our
 
01:58:28.310 --> 01:58:28.320 align:start position:0%
courts which is what one of the women
 
01:58:30.229 --> 01:58:30.239 align:start position:0%
who is in the house of lords of england
 
01:58:31.669 --> 01:58:31.679 align:start position:0%
called it
 
01:58:33.910 --> 01:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
so i will take questions and i know
 
01:58:35.270 --> 01:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
there are people who are wanting to
 
01:58:38.310 --> 01:58:38.320 align:start position:0%

02:00:14.870 --> 02:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
who is ordered it's the families that
 
02:00:18.629 --> 02:00:18.639 align:start position:0%

representatives they've never heard of
 
02:00:29.589 --> 02:00:29.599 align:start position:0%
this because everybody is scared to
 
02:00:32.470 --> 02:00:32.480 align:start position:0%
death to talk about it
 
02:00:34.550 --> 02:00:34.560 align:start position:0%
you will hear from one person
 
02:00:36.310 --> 02:00:36.320 align:start position:0%
one person who testified a couple of
 
02:00:38.390 --> 02:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
years ago and has already testified
 
02:00:38.400 --> 02:00:39.589 align:start position:0%
years ago and has already testified
today

02:00:39.589 --> 02:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:00:41.830 --> 02:00:41.840 align:start position:0%
she had to leave the state
 
02:00:44.950 --> 02:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
and hide her child when her
 
02:00:46.229 --> 02:00:46.239 align:start position:0%

he doesn't even live in new hampshire he
 
02:00:54.390 --> 02:00:54.400 align:start position:0%
refused to come to the first two
 
02:00:56.070 --> 02:00:56.080 align:start position:0%
uh hearings
 
02:00:57.910 --> 02:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
but they knew there was money there so
 
02:00:59.910 --> 02:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
they kept letting him
 
02:01:01.430 --> 02:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
you know giving him another hearing to
 
02:01:02.550 --> 02:01:02.560 align:start position:0%

and she's the one who testified she was
 
02:01:06.149 --> 02:01:06.159 align:start position:0%
never granted an evidentiary hearing

02:01:52.310 --> 02:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:55.189 --> 02:01:55.199 align:start position:0%
i submitted a written testimony
 
02:01:57.589 --> 02:01:57.599 align:start position:0%
yesterday and in case i wasn't able to
 
02:01:59.910 --> 02:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
join this part of the meeting
 
02:01:59.920 --> 02:02:01.510 align:start position:0%
join this part of the meeting
um

02:02:01.510 --> 02:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:04.470 --> 02:02:04.480 align:start position:0%
this bill uh to me is incredibly
 
02:02:06.790 --> 02:02:06.800 align:start position:0%
important i would echo everything that
 
02:02:11.109 --> 02:02:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:14.229 --> 02:02:14.239 align:start position:0%
feeling in fear of
 
02:02:16.870 --> 02:02:16.880 align:start position:0%
the retaliation that i could face for
 
02:02:18.870 --> 02:02:18.880 align:start position:0%
testifying and
 
02:02:21.830 --> 02:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
kind of calling out some of the
 
02:02:24.149 --> 02:02:24.159 align:start position:0%
misinformation um
 
02:02:27.109 --> 02:02:27.119 align:start position:0%
and orders um that are given by the
 
02:02:27.119 --> 02:02:28.149 align:start position:0%
and orders um that are given by the
court

02:02:28.149 --> 02:02:28.159 align:start position:0%
court
 
02:02:28.159 --> 02:02:29.589 align:start position:0%
court
um

02:02:29.589 --> 02:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:31.990 --> 02:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
my situation is a little different right
 
02:02:34.149 --> 02:02:34.159 align:start position:0%
now and that
 
02:02:36.310 --> 02:02:36.320 align:start position:0%
we've been court ordered to co-parenting
 
02:02:36.320 --> 02:02:38.790 align:start position:0%
we've been court ordered to co-parenting
therapy

02:02:38.790 --> 02:02:38.800 align:start position:0%
therapy
 
02:02:40.470 --> 02:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
which again
 
02:02:42.470 --> 02:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
if you read my testimony
 
02:02:44.149 --> 02:02:44.159 align:start position:0%
is not
 
02:02:46.709 --> 02:02:46.719 align:start position:0%
a supported form of therapy
 
02:02:48.550 --> 02:02:48.560 align:start position:0%

process of trying to
 
02:02:57.760 --> 02:03:00.790 align:start position:0%
process of trying to
um

02:03:00.790 --> 02:03:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:03.270 --> 02:03:03.280 align:start position:0%

02:03:06.149 --> 02:03:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:06.159 --> 02:03:06.950 align:start position:0%
 
i

02:03:06.950 --> 02:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:03:09.430 --> 02:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
called 46 licensed mental health

practitioners in new hampshire
 
02:03:15.430 --> 02:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
the majority of them do not um conduct
 
02:03:17.669 --> 02:03:17.679 align:start position:0%
court-ordered therapy and furthermore
 
02:03:20.470 --> 02:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
they don't do court or co-parenting
 
02:03:20.480 --> 02:03:21.750 align:start position:0%
they don't do court or co-parenting

02:03:21.750 --> 02:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
therapy

um

02:03:22.550 --> 02:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:24.470 --> 02:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
many of them had no idea what i was
 
02:03:26.830 --> 02:03:26.840 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
02:03:26.840 --> 02:03:28.790 align:start position:0%
talking about
um

02:03:28.790 --> 02:03:28.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:28.800 --> 02:03:29.910 align:start position:0%
um
and

02:03:29.910 --> 02:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:03:32.390 --> 02:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
to kind of complicate matters the few
 
02:03:35.189 --> 02:03:35.199 align:start position:0%
that i did find who provided that
 
02:03:35.199 --> 02:03:36.470 align:start position:0%
that i did find who provided that
service

02:03:36.470 --> 02:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
service
 
02:03:39.510 --> 02:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
um it wasn't a billable code
 
02:03:41.990 --> 02:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
um or they were very
 
02:03:44.390 --> 02:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
ambiguous about well it may or may not
 
02:03:46.550 --> 02:03:46.560 align:start position:0%
be covered by insurance
 
02:03:46.560 --> 02:03:47.990 align:start position:0%
be covered by insurance
um

02:03:47.990 --> 02:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:50.390 --> 02:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
my child's pediatrician who tried to
 
02:03:54.149 --> 02:03:54.159 align:start position:0%
help with the search to find someone to
 
02:03:58.229 --> 02:03:58.239 align:start position:0%
facilitate this court order um
 
02:04:00.149 --> 02:04:00.159 align:start position:0%
said quote
 
02:04:02.229 --> 02:04:02.239 align:start position:0%
that said putting it all together right
 
02:04:05.109 --> 02:04:05.119 align:start position:0%
now after the recent search effort
 
02:04:06.870 --> 02:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
i think we're at an interesting place
 
02:04:09.109 --> 02:04:09.119 align:start position:0%
for what is needed is clarification from
 
02:04:12.149 --> 02:04:12.159 align:start position:0%
the court on what exactly the intent is
 
02:04:14.950 --> 02:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
with the term co-parenting therapy
 
02:04:17.430 --> 02:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
keeping in mind what is and is not
 
02:04:19.589 --> 02:04:19.599 align:start position:0%
available as options within the
 
02:04:21.109 --> 02:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
counseling world
 
02:04:26.070 --> 02:04:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:29.350 --> 02:04:29.360 align:start position:0%
complicating this whole matter for me is
 
02:04:31.430 --> 02:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
that our case does involve domestic
 
02:04:34.149 --> 02:04:34.159 align:start position:0%
violence and
 
02:04:38.070 --> 02:04:38.080 align:start position:0%
doing therapy with my abuser is also not
 
02:04:41.589 --> 02:04:41.599 align:start position:0%
a supported form of
 
02:04:43.669 --> 02:04:43.679 align:start position:0%
it's not recommended by our domestic
 
02:04:47.109 --> 02:04:47.119 align:start position:0%
violence agencies within the state
 
02:04:50.390 --> 02:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
the gal knows this on our case yet he
 
02:04:52.470 --> 02:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
continued to recommend it
 
02:04:55.510 --> 02:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
stating that well perhaps i can do it
 
02:04:57.430 --> 02:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
virtually instead
 
02:04:57.440 --> 02:04:58.470 align:start position:0%
virtually instead
uh

02:04:58.470 --> 02:04:58.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:05:01.109 --> 02:05:01.119 align:start position:0%
that's that's not the point um
 
02:05:03.510 --> 02:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
you know of domestic violence or or
 
02:05:06.629 --> 02:05:06.639 align:start position:0%
feeling a power and control differential
 
02:05:08.149 --> 02:05:08.159 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:05:10.550 --> 02:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
you know this bill is important
 
02:05:12.310 --> 02:05:12.320 align:start position:0%
for one aspect of it but i feel like
 
02:05:14.470 --> 02:05:14.480 align:start position:0%
continued education and domestic
 
02:05:14.480 --> 02:05:15.589 align:start position:0%
continued education and domestic
violence

02:05:15.589 --> 02:05:15.599 align:start position:0%
violence
 
02:05:18.550 --> 02:05:18.560 align:start position:0%
for all of our um support professionals
 
02:05:20.629 --> 02:05:20.639 align:start position:0%
is incredibly
 
02:05:22.390 --> 02:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
um needed
 
02:05:22.400 --> 02:05:24.149 align:start position:0%
um needed
um

02:05:24.149 --> 02:05:24.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:26.870 --> 02:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
my my own primary care physician also
 
02:05:26.880 --> 02:05:28.070 align:start position:0%
my my own primary care physician also
stated

02:05:28.070 --> 02:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
stated
 
02:05:30.149 --> 02:05:30.159 align:start position:0%
uh when i asked them for assistance in
 
02:05:30.159 --> 02:05:31.189 align:start position:0%
uh when i asked them for assistance in
finding

02:05:31.189 --> 02:05:31.199 align:start position:0%
finding
 
02:05:34.390 --> 02:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
a therapist said quote and unfortunately
 
02:05:36.229 --> 02:05:36.239 align:start position:0%
i don't have
 
02:05:37.990 --> 02:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
essentially any recommendations for a
 
02:05:40.629 --> 02:05:40.639 align:start position:0%
co-parenting therapist i recently saw a
 
02:05:42.550 --> 02:05:42.560 align:start position:0%
thread about a similar situation in
 
02:05:43.990 --> 02:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
which the therapists were saying that
 
02:05:45.910 --> 02:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
this is a challenge this is challenging
 
02:05:48.070 --> 02:05:48.080 align:start position:0%
to navigate and the importance of
 
02:05:50.070 --> 02:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
educating judges
 
02:05:51.990 --> 02:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
in these cases
 
02:05:54.229 --> 02:05:54.239 align:start position:0%
end quote um
 
02:05:54.239 --> 02:05:55.189 align:start position:0%
end quote um
so

02:05:55.189 --> 02:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:05:57.109 --> 02:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
again um
 
02:05:58.950 --> 02:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
it kind of goes back to the judicial
 
02:06:00.629 --> 02:06:00.639 align:start position:0%
system and
 
02:06:00.639 --> 02:06:03.510 align:start position:0%
system and
um

02:06:03.510 --> 02:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:06.149 --> 02:06:06.159 align:start position:0%
as part of the court order in our case
 
02:06:08.470 --> 02:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
the judge also
 
02:06:08.480 --> 02:06:09.430 align:start position:0%
the judge also
um

02:06:09.430 --> 02:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:12.390 --> 02:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
in my opinion threatened me by
 
02:06:14.390 --> 02:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
saying that
 
02:06:16.709 --> 02:06:16.719 align:start position:0%
if the co-parenting therapist recommends
 
02:06:19.990 --> 02:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
a psychological evaluation just for me
 
02:06:22.629 --> 02:06:22.639 align:start position:0%
then i was responsible for it for paying
 
02:06:24.310 --> 02:06:24.320 align:start position:0%
it out of pocket whether it was covered
 
02:06:26.950 --> 02:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
by medical expense by medical insurance
 
02:06:28.070 --> 02:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
or not
 
02:06:31.189 --> 02:06:31.199 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:06:31.199 --> 02:06:31.910 align:start position:0%
and um
i

02:06:31.910 --> 02:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:06:34.390 --> 02:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
took that as you know a slap across the
 
02:06:36.390 --> 02:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
face because
 
02:06:38.629 --> 02:06:38.639 align:start position:0%
if the judge was so worried about my
 
02:06:41.270 --> 02:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
mental health wouldn't he
 
02:06:43.669 --> 02:06:43.679 align:start position:0%
you know have removed my child from my
 
02:06:43.679 --> 02:06:44.629 align:start position:0%
you know have removed my child from my
care

02:06:44.629 --> 02:06:44.639 align:start position:0%
care
 
02:06:44.639 --> 02:06:45.589 align:start position:0%
care
um

02:06:45.589 --> 02:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:47.430 --> 02:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
that's not the case
 
02:06:47.440 --> 02:06:48.390 align:start position:0%
that's not the case
um

02:06:48.390 --> 02:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:50.550 --> 02:06:50.560 align:start position:0%
but it kind of goes back to what
 
02:06:53.669 --> 02:06:53.679 align:start position:0%
representative gay was stating about
 
02:06:53.679 --> 02:06:55.189 align:start position:0%
representative gay was stating about
um

02:06:55.189 --> 02:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:58.709 --> 02:06:58.719 align:start position:0%
you know targeting certain parents
 
02:07:01.669 --> 02:07:01.679 align:start position:0%
who may have

some ability to pay for these services
 
02:07:04.400 --> 02:07:05.430 align:start position:0%
some ability to pay for these services
and

02:07:05.430 --> 02:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:07:09.189 --> 02:07:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:11.109 --> 02:07:11.119 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:07:13.350 --> 02:07:13.360 align:start position:0%
what the court feels like they want the
 
02:07:14.870 --> 02:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
outcome to be
 
02:07:14.880 --> 02:07:15.750 align:start position:0%
outcome to be
um

02:07:15.750 --> 02:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:18.149 --> 02:07:18.159 align:start position:0%
really narrowing um
 
02:07:20.629 --> 02:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
my ability to
 
02:07:20.639 --> 02:07:22.629 align:start position:0%
my ability to
um

02:07:22.629 --> 02:07:22.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:25.270 --> 02:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
put the facts on the table and just let
 
02:07:25.280 --> 02:07:26.390 align:start position:0%
put the facts on the table and just let
the

02:07:26.390 --> 02:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:07:29.350 --> 02:07:29.360 align:start position:0%
system see the facts instead of kind of
 
02:07:31.030 --> 02:07:31.040 align:start position:0%
shuttling us through all of these
 
02:07:33.270 --> 02:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
different interventions that that aren't
 
02:07:34.950 --> 02:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
medically proven
 
02:07:38.790 --> 02:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
so i'm sure i've over stated or over
 
02:07:40.550 --> 02:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
talked my time but um

02:09:08.629 --> 02:09:08.639 align:start position:0%
um again my name is aaron jusina and i
 
02:09:10.709 --> 02:09:10.719 align:start position:0%
direct the domestic violence advocacy
 
02:09:12.149 --> 02:09:12.159 align:start position:0%
project at new hampshire legal
 
02:09:14.629 --> 02:09:14.639 align:start position:0%
assistance and i'm here to testify in
 
02:09:18.310 --> 02:09:18.320 align:start position:0%
opposition to house bill 556
 
02:09:20.709 --> 02:09:20.719 align:start position:0%
as representative gate mentioned this
 
02:09:22.550 --> 02:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
bill was proposed
 
02:09:24.470 --> 02:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
last session a similar bill was proposed
 
02:09:25.669 --> 02:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
last session
 
02:09:29.669 --> 02:09:29.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:32.870 --> 02:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
and that bill did die in chamber on june
 
02:09:35.430 --> 02:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
16 2020.
 
02:09:38.069 --> 02:09:38.079 align:start position:0%
so this bill seeks to stop reunification
 
02:09:41.030 --> 02:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
therapy which i agree can be completely
 
02:09:43.350 --> 02:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
triggering and further traumatic for
 
02:09:45.350 --> 02:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
victims of domestic violence and their
 
02:09:45.360 --> 02:09:46.790 align:start position:0%
victims of domestic violence and their
children

02:09:46.790 --> 02:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
children
 
02:09:48.950 --> 02:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
but this bill unfortunately passed will
 
02:09:51.430 --> 02:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
not accomplish that goal
 
02:09:53.750 --> 02:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
therapists under this bill if it was
 
02:09:53.760 --> 02:09:54.950 align:start position:0%
therapists under this bill if it was
passed

02:09:54.950 --> 02:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
passed
 
02:09:56.870 --> 02:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
could still provide reunion
 
02:09:56.880 --> 02:09:57.910 align:start position:0%
could still provide reunion
therapy

02:09:57.910 --> 02:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
therapy
 
02:09:59.750 --> 02:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
while billing to a proper medical
 
02:10:01.189 --> 02:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
medical code
 
02:10:02.950 --> 02:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
they could just bill it as the generic
 
02:10:05.669 --> 02:10:05.679 align:start position:0%
code for individual therapy
 
02:10:07.109 --> 02:10:07.119 align:start position:0%
which would be considered a form of
 
02:10:09.750 --> 02:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
mental health treatment and eligible for
 
02:10:12.830 --> 02:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
insurance reimbursement
 
02:10:15.669 --> 02:10:15.679 align:start position:0%
um uh members of this committee who uh
 
02:10:18.390 --> 02:10:18.400 align:start position:0%
were here last year may remember that um
 
02:10:20.950 --> 02:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
there was a working session on this bill
 
02:10:23.750 --> 02:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
i believe it was in february um and it
 
02:10:26.550 --> 02:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
was recommended that the bill be itled
 
02:10:28.709 --> 02:10:28.719 align:start position:0%
and discussed that if reunification
 
02:10:32.550 --> 02:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
therapy is the problem which i think
 
02:10:33.990 --> 02:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
that is the issue raised by
 
02:10:35.669 --> 02:10:35.679 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
02:10:37.510 --> 02:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
i also share concerns about
 
02:10:39.669 --> 02:10:39.679 align:start position:0%
reunification therapy and its effects on
 
02:10:42.550 --> 02:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
domestic violence victims and children
 
02:10:45.589 --> 02:10:45.599 align:start position:0%
so if reunification therapy is in fact
 
02:10:48.310 --> 02:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
the problem then that is what needs to
 
02:10:50.709 --> 02:10:50.719 align:start position:0%
be addressed by a bill and this bill
 
02:10:53.990 --> 02:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
does not do that it doesn't prevent it
 
02:10:56.709 --> 02:10:56.719 align:start position:0%
it will not stop these situations that
 
02:10:59.270 --> 02:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
representative gay uh mentioned in her
 
02:10:59.280 --> 02:11:00.629 align:start position:0%
representative gay uh mentioned in her
testimony

02:11:00.629 --> 02:11:00.639 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:11:02.470 --> 02:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
so i just urged the committee to
 
02:11:04.629 --> 02:11:04.639 align:start position:0%
reconsider that as you considered it
 
02:11:07.189 --> 02:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
back in february of last year
 
02:11:09.510 --> 02:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
um consider that
 
02:11:12.390 --> 02:11:12.400 align:start position:0%
as the issue and vote in expedient to
 
02:11:19.990 --> 02:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:22.550 --> 02:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
thank you do we have any questions for
 
02:11:28.950 --> 02:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:31.750 --> 02:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
seeing none we'll move on to the next
 
02:11:34.709 --> 02:11:34.719 align:start position:0%
person on the list of people who would
 
02:11:37.350 --> 02:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
like to testify
 
02:11:39.510 --> 02:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
the next speaker is miss rhonda hodge
 
02:11:44.069 --> 02:11:44.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:46.229 --> 02:11:46.239 align:start position:0%

02:11:53.589 --> 02:11:53.599 align:start position:0%
um i have a 20-year history i'm a
 
02:11:55.189 --> 02:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
licensed mental health therapist but i

02:11:58.320 --> 02:11:59.589 align:start position:0%
am also board certified in psychiatry um
so

02:11:59.589 --> 02:11:59.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:12:01.990 --> 02:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
under that i'm dr rhonda hodge
 
02:12:03.669 --> 02:12:03.679 align:start position:0%
i've been working
 
02:12:05.270 --> 02:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
with children
 
02:12:06.950 --> 02:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
and families for
 
02:12:09.030 --> 02:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
forever um i started my work actually
 
02:12:11.109 --> 02:12:11.119 align:start position:0%
working with foster children who were in
 
02:12:12.709 --> 02:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
trauma situations
 
02:12:15.350 --> 02:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
i met betty um when i reached out to her
 
02:12:17.510 --> 02:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
about a personal situation so i'm going
 
02:12:18.950 --> 02:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
to speak to you kind of both clinically
 
02:12:20.310 --> 02:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
and i think some of the answers some of
 
02:12:22.229 --> 02:12:22.239 align:start position:0%
the questions that came about i might be
 
02:12:23.830 --> 02:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
able to answer because i am doing
 
02:12:26.310 --> 02:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
billing i as i own my own business i do
 
02:12:29.109 --> 02:12:29.119 align:start position:0%
all of it um from start to finish and i
 
02:12:30.790 --> 02:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
think it's important to mention that
 
02:12:33.109 --> 02:12:33.119 align:start position:0%
there's no icd code for abandonment and
 
02:12:35.350 --> 02:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
there's no ic decode for
 
02:12:36.550 --> 02:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
child abuse
 
02:12:38.470 --> 02:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
and when you're billing for a family
 
02:12:41.270 --> 02:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
session um yes we could say maybe post
 
02:12:43.030 --> 02:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
traumatic stress disorder
 
02:12:44.870 --> 02:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
but you know it's really hard to say
 
02:12:46.790 --> 02:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
that when the child is five or six years
 
02:12:48.550 --> 02:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
old um
 
02:12:50.470 --> 02:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
you're kind of creating things just to
 
02:12:52.790 --> 02:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
be able to bill for something like this
 
02:12:54.149 --> 02:12:54.159 align:start position:0%
and i actually agree with the last
 
02:12:56.149 --> 02:12:56.159 align:start position:0%
speaker that the idea of unification
 
02:12:58.550 --> 02:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
therapy is
 
02:13:01.669 --> 02:13:01.679 align:start position:0%
disgusting um to say the least i
 
02:13:03.669 --> 02:13:03.679 align:start position:0%
always trusted the system and i always
 
02:13:05.589 --> 02:13:05.599 align:start position:0%
trusted the state of new hampshire in
 
02:13:07.109 --> 02:13:07.119 align:start position:0%
court and i'm from new hampshire and i
 
02:13:09.510 --> 02:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
went to started my education at flemish
 
02:13:11.669 --> 02:13:11.679 align:start position:0%
state but some of the things that i'm
 
02:13:14.149 --> 02:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
seeing have just been so horrifying to
 
02:13:14.159 --> 02:13:15.030 align:start position:0%
seeing have just been so horrifying to
me

02:13:15.030 --> 02:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
me
 
02:13:18.629 --> 02:13:18.639 align:start position:0%
um reunification therapy is attention is
 
02:13:22.310 --> 02:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
um it's it's child abuse it's telling a
 
02:13:24.709 --> 02:13:24.719 align:start position:0%
child and i would not say that like i
 
02:13:24.719 --> 02:13:25.510 align:start position:0%
child and i would not say that like i
don't

02:13:25.510 --> 02:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
don't
 
02:13:27.669 --> 02:13:27.679 align:start position:0%
speak that strongly
 
02:13:29.589 --> 02:13:29.599 align:start position:0%
but it needs to be heard that it is
 
02:13:31.189 --> 02:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
you're essentially
 
02:13:33.750 --> 02:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
taking a child who has been abused
 
02:13:35.750 --> 02:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
and you are telling them to never trust
 
02:13:38.709 --> 02:13:38.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:41.350 --> 02:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
i have never had a patient come in that
 
02:13:43.669 --> 02:13:43.679 align:start position:0%
i would want that to be the outcome
 
02:13:47.270 --> 02:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
i want them to know that yeah bud like
 
02:13:49.350 --> 02:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
what you know is true so if you see
 
02:13:51.669 --> 02:13:51.679 align:start position:0%
somebody down the line and you get that
 
02:13:53.669 --> 02:13:53.679 align:start position:0%
same feeling that you got
 
02:13:55.189 --> 02:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
with that person
 
02:13:56.470 --> 02:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to convince you it's not
 
02:13:58.149 --> 02:13:58.159 align:start position:0%
true just because a judge told me that
 
02:14:00.390 --> 02:14:00.400 align:start position:0%
you have to be around that person i will
 
02:14:00.400 --> 02:14:01.350 align:start position:0%
you have to be around that person i will
never

02:14:01.350 --> 02:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
never
 
02:14:01.360 --> 02:14:02.310 align:start position:0%
never
ever

02:14:02.310 --> 02:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
ever
 
02:14:05.589 --> 02:14:05.599 align:start position:0%
ever take part in something like that
 
02:14:06.950 --> 02:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
there will never be
 
02:14:09.510 --> 02:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
a family that comes into my practice
 
02:14:09.520 --> 02:14:10.310 align:start position:0%
a family that comes into my practice
that

02:14:10.310 --> 02:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:14:13.030 --> 02:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
i'm going to reunify them
 
02:14:17.109 --> 02:14:17.119 align:start position:0%
with their physical or emotional abuser
 
02:14:19.830 --> 02:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
i it goes against it's it's immoral and
 
02:14:21.750 --> 02:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
it's unethical now of course there are
 
02:14:23.430 --> 02:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
situations where reunification does make
 
02:14:25.669 --> 02:14:25.679 align:start position:0%
sense right like there are going to be
 
02:14:28.069 --> 02:14:28.079 align:start position:0%
situations where that looks healthy and
 
02:14:29.750 --> 02:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
that could be okay
 
02:14:31.270 --> 02:14:31.280 align:start position:0%
the situations the things that i've
 
02:14:33.350 --> 02:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
heard of it's just such a broad spectrum
 
02:14:35.510 --> 02:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
that it it doesn't make sense
 
02:14:38.390 --> 02:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
um you have a female girl for example
 
02:14:40.709 --> 02:14:40.719 align:start position:0%
who at seven eight years old was
 
02:14:42.870 --> 02:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
physically or sexually abused and i used
 
02:14:44.629 --> 02:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
female because
 
02:14:46.069 --> 02:14:46.079 align:start position:0%
most of the uh
 
02:14:49.109 --> 02:14:49.119 align:start position:0%
the abuse that you might see um
 
02:14:50.550 --> 02:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
unfortunately happens to females but i
 
02:14:52.629 --> 02:14:52.639 align:start position:0%
will not again um
 
02:14:54.790 --> 02:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
like betty did i will not leave out
 
02:14:57.669 --> 02:14:57.679 align:start position:0%
lgbtq or men this happens to everybody
 
02:14:59.270 --> 02:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
but you take that child into
 
02:14:59.280 --> 02:15:00.790 align:start position:0%
but you take that child into
reunification

02:15:00.790 --> 02:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
reunification
 
02:15:02.470 --> 02:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
with her mom or dad
 
02:15:04.709 --> 02:15:04.719 align:start position:0%
and you tell her that that was okay and
 
02:15:06.950 --> 02:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
she should have to be around them again
 
02:15:09.109 --> 02:15:09.119 align:start position:0%
then what happens when that kiddo is a
 
02:15:11.510 --> 02:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
freshman in college what happens when
 
02:15:13.189 --> 02:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
they are in us i'm gonna start crying
 
02:15:14.550 --> 02:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
because it's just like
 
02:15:16.629 --> 02:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
it's so hard to hear
 
02:15:18.709 --> 02:15:18.719 align:start position:0%
that this is what's happening and also i
 
02:15:20.870 --> 02:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
didn't actually hear betty mention
 
02:15:22.709 --> 02:15:22.719 align:start position:0%
these reunification therapists aren't
 
02:15:25.350 --> 02:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
necessarily me they're not clinical
 
02:15:27.589 --> 02:15:27.599 align:start position:0%
most of them don't have licenses
 
02:15:29.510 --> 02:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
i have a situation and i have to be
 
02:15:31.589 --> 02:15:31.599 align:start position:0%
careful with because i have um a
 
02:15:33.270 --> 02:15:33.280 align:start position:0%
personal situation too
 
02:15:35.430 --> 02:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
of somebody who it's really a business
 
02:15:39.030 --> 02:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
model they don't have a history of they
 
02:15:40.790 --> 02:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
don't know about child development
 
02:15:42.229 --> 02:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
they don't know about personality
 
02:15:43.750 --> 02:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
disorders and most abusers have
 
02:15:45.109 --> 02:15:45.119 align:start position:0%
personality disorders they don't have
 
02:15:47.430 --> 02:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
the clinical skills they didn't go to
 
02:15:49.270 --> 02:15:49.280 align:start position:0%
school for it
 
02:15:51.109 --> 02:15:51.119 align:start position:0%
that's another reason the icd codes
 
02:15:52.149 --> 02:15:52.159 align:start position:0%
won't work
 
02:15:54.709 --> 02:15:54.719 align:start position:0%
is because they're not therapists
 
02:15:56.310 --> 02:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
they're not licensed in the state of new
 
02:15:59.229 --> 02:15:59.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire as an lmhc or
 
02:16:01.189 --> 02:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
licsw and they
 
02:16:03.669 --> 02:16:03.679 align:start position:0%
they didn't do the work they created a
 
02:16:03.679 --> 02:16:04.790 align:start position:0%
they didn't do the work they created a
business

02:16:04.790 --> 02:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
business
 
02:16:07.270 --> 02:16:07.280 align:start position:0%
based on something and they might have
 
02:16:10.550 --> 02:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
like a supervising going along with it
 
02:16:12.629 --> 02:16:12.639 align:start position:0%
i also spoke to a state rep because this
 
02:16:14.790 --> 02:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
has been really heavy on my heart lately
 
02:16:16.550 --> 02:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
as as i learned a little bit more about
 
02:16:18.470 --> 02:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
it and
 
02:16:20.390 --> 02:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
similar to what betty said he said to me
 
02:16:21.830 --> 02:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
when i was telling him about a case he
 
02:16:25.189 --> 02:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
said i bet you that mom has money
 
02:16:27.270 --> 02:16:27.280 align:start position:0%
now the the facts of the case are that
 
02:16:29.669 --> 02:16:29.679 align:start position:0%
the child the father has a 20-year
 
02:16:31.589 --> 02:16:31.599 align:start position:0%
history of domestic violence
 
02:16:35.270 --> 02:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
the father abandoned two children
 
02:16:36.790 --> 02:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
abused the child that we were talking
 
02:16:39.190 --> 02:16:39.200 align:start position:0%
about now
 
02:16:41.509 --> 02:16:41.519 align:start position:0%
went missing for a while during the case
 
02:16:43.030 --> 02:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
for over six months which in new
 
02:16:44.230 --> 02:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire state of new hampshire is
 
02:16:44.240 --> 02:16:45.509 align:start position:0%
hampshire state of new hampshire is
abandonment

02:16:45.509 --> 02:16:45.519 align:start position:0%
abandonment
 
02:16:49.030 --> 02:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
um he beat the mother of his first child
 
02:16:50.150 --> 02:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
twice while she was pregnant to the
 
02:16:52.469 --> 02:16:52.479 align:start position:0%
point of incarceration now abusers don't
 
02:16:53.750 --> 02:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
get incarcerated so you have to know
 
02:16:55.270 --> 02:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
it's pretty significant
 
02:16:58.070 --> 02:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
and the judge ordered them it was the
 
02:16:59.509 --> 02:16:59.519 align:start position:0%
mother's fault that she had a stalking
 
02:16:59.519 --> 02:17:00.790 align:start position:0%
mother's fault that she had a stalking
order

02:17:00.790 --> 02:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
order
 
02:17:02.870 --> 02:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
in the order it essentially said it was
 
02:17:05.030 --> 02:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
her fault now that is in state that is
 
02:17:06.549 --> 02:17:06.559 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire now so
 
02:17:07.910 --> 02:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
that's definitely something to look out
 
02:17:09.429 --> 02:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
for that is a case that went through the
 
02:17:11.030 --> 02:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
supreme court
 
02:17:11.040 --> 02:17:11.910 align:start position:0%
supreme court
um

02:17:11.910 --> 02:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:13.589 --> 02:17:13.599 align:start position:0%
so again as a provider i don't even know
 
02:17:15.110 --> 02:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
what to tell my patients anymore when
 
02:17:17.190 --> 02:17:17.200 align:start position:0%
they're in these situations
 
02:17:17.200 --> 02:17:17.990 align:start position:0%
they're in these situations
but

02:17:17.990 --> 02:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:17:20.389 --> 02:17:20.399 align:start position:0%
what the the person the state rep said
 
02:17:21.429 --> 02:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
to me was
 
02:17:23.429 --> 02:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
i promise you it's because that mom had
 
02:17:23.439 --> 02:17:24.309 align:start position:0%
i promise you it's because that mom had
money

02:17:24.309 --> 02:17:24.319 align:start position:0%
money
 
02:17:24.319 --> 02:17:25.270 align:start position:0%
money
and

02:17:25.270 --> 02:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:17:26.629 --> 02:17:26.639 align:start position:0%
they know that she's going to put my
 
02:17:28.469 --> 02:17:28.479 align:start position:0%
money into the judicial system
 
02:17:30.150 --> 02:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
so i mean this is just like a super
 
02:17:32.230 --> 02:17:32.240 align:start position:0%
layer cake but i i think that it's
 
02:17:34.230 --> 02:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
really really important that
 
02:17:36.389 --> 02:17:36.399 align:start position:0%
you understand that it's not moral it's
 
02:17:37.669 --> 02:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
not clinical
 
02:17:40.389 --> 02:17:40.399 align:start position:0%
there's no psychological basis behind it
 
02:17:43.349 --> 02:17:43.359 align:start position:0%
and essentially it's making a kiddo
 
02:17:45.509 --> 02:17:45.519 align:start position:0%
not believe themselves not feel like
 
02:17:47.589 --> 02:17:47.599 align:start position:0%
they can protect themselves
 
02:17:50.070 --> 02:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
um i actually i mean i would like i said
 
02:17:51.910 --> 02:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
i was horrified i've
 
02:17:53.349 --> 02:17:53.359 align:start position:0%
i have three master's degrees in
 
02:17:54.950 --> 02:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
psychology a doctorate i've been doing
 
02:17:57.910 --> 02:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
this forever i wouldn't even believe it
 
02:18:00.070 --> 02:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
if you if i didn't hear from betty i
 
02:18:01.270 --> 02:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
never would have believed that this was
 
02:18:02.549 --> 02:18:02.559 align:start position:0%
actually happening it sounds like
 
02:18:05.589 --> 02:18:05.599 align:start position:0%
something that came out of the 50s or
 
02:18:08.389 --> 02:18:08.399 align:start position:0%
or 60s and
 
02:18:11.669 --> 02:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
i don't know it's it's horrifying but i
 
02:18:13.190 --> 02:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
definitely can answer any questions you
 
02:18:14.629 --> 02:18:14.639 align:start position:0%
guys have about billing and what that
 
02:18:19.429 --> 02:18:19.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:21.110 --> 02:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
do we have any questions from the
 
02:18:21.120 --> 02:18:25.429 align:start position:0%
do we have any questions from the
committee

02:18:25.429 --> 02:18:25.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:27.429 --> 02:18:27.439 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
02:18:29.589 --> 02:18:29.599 align:start position:0%
testimony and we will move on to the
 
02:18:35.589 --> 02:18:35.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:37.750 --> 02:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
so that was the last on the list but i
 
02:18:37.760 --> 02:18:40.469 align:start position:0%
so that was the last on the list but i
have

02:18:40.469 --> 02:18:40.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:40.479 --> 02:18:41.589 align:start position:0%
 
paula

02:18:41.589 --> 02:18:41.599 align:start position:0%
paula
 
02:18:50.830 --> 02:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:53.270 --> 02:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
okay hi
 
02:18:55.190 --> 02:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
it's very weird every time i unmute it
 
02:18:57.990 --> 02:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
seems the program mutes me again
 
02:19:00.309 --> 02:19:00.319 align:start position:0%
um i have submitted written testimony on
 
02:19:02.309 --> 02:19:02.319 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:19:06.549 --> 02:19:06.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:08.309 --> 02:19:08.319 align:start position:0%
she's accurately describing what is
 
02:19:11.830 --> 02:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
going on in new hampshire courts right
 
02:19:11.840 --> 02:19:12.790 align:start position:0%
going on in new hampshire courts right
um

02:19:12.790 --> 02:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:14.870 --> 02:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
everybody knows about the case that was
 
02:19:17.750 --> 02:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
in portsmouth and in foley's court
 
02:19:21.190 --> 02:19:21.200 align:start position:0%
it was eventually transferred to lemire
 
02:19:21.200 --> 02:19:22.070 align:start position:0%
it was eventually transferred to lemire
and

02:19:22.070 --> 02:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:19:22.080 --> 02:19:23.349 align:start position:0%
and
after

02:19:23.349 --> 02:19:23.359 align:start position:0%
after
 
02:19:24.950 --> 02:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
and by the way there's there was no
 
02:19:26.549 --> 02:19:26.559 align:start position:0%
subject matter jurisdiction for that
 
02:19:29.030 --> 02:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
divorce i don't consider this woman to
 
02:19:30.709 --> 02:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
be divorced
 
02:19:30.719 --> 02:19:32.230 align:start position:0%
be divorced
because

02:19:32.230 --> 02:19:32.240 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:19:32.240 --> 02:19:33.110 align:start position:0%
because
the

02:19:33.110 --> 02:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:19:35.990 --> 02:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
father who filed the petition for
 
02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:37.030 align:start position:0%
father who filed the petition for
divorce

02:19:37.030 --> 02:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
divorce
 
02:19:39.110 --> 02:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
was from washington d.c
 
02:19:40.549 --> 02:19:40.559 align:start position:0%
he hasn't lived in new hampshire during
 
02:19:42.230 --> 02:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
the entire
 
02:19:44.150 --> 02:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
length of the case and the mother moved
 
02:19:47.030 --> 02:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
out of state long enough to establish
 
02:19:48.469 --> 02:19:48.479 align:start position:0%
child custody jurisdiction in
 
02:19:50.630 --> 02:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
connecticut before the judge changed
 
02:19:50.640 --> 02:19:52.469 align:start position:0%
connecticut before the judge changed
custody

02:19:52.469 --> 02:19:52.479 align:start position:0%
custody
 
02:19:52.479 --> 02:19:54.469 align:start position:0%
custody
um

02:19:54.469 --> 02:19:54.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:57.030 --> 02:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is
 
02:19:59.510 --> 02:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
i think the bill does need to be amended
 
02:19:59.520 --> 02:20:00.389 align:start position:0%
i think the bill does need to be amended
to

02:20:00.389 --> 02:20:00.399 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:20:03.590 --> 02:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
specifically prohibit
 
02:20:05.670 --> 02:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
reunification therapy
 
02:20:08.150 --> 02:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
um i
 
02:20:10.230 --> 02:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
it has to be called out and judges have
 
02:20:13.190 --> 02:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
to know that this is a no-no
 
02:20:15.670 --> 02:20:15.680 align:start position:0%
reunification therapy is unethical for
 
02:20:18.150 --> 02:20:18.160 align:start position:0%
psychologists to engage in
 
02:20:18.160 --> 02:20:19.510 align:start position:0%
psychologists to engage in
so

02:20:19.510 --> 02:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:20:21.510 --> 02:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
the last speaker is right the ones that
 
02:20:22.389 --> 02:20:22.399 align:start position:0%
do the
 
02:20:24.710 --> 02:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
do engage in it
 
02:20:27.349 --> 02:20:27.359 align:start position:0%
are licensed clinical social workers and
 
02:20:31.349 --> 02:20:31.359 align:start position:0%
they don't have the extensive training
 
02:20:33.510 --> 02:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
and she's also right that many many
 
02:20:35.830 --> 02:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
abusers have
 
02:20:38.790 --> 02:20:38.800 align:start position:0%
personality disorders and that includes
 
02:20:42.469 --> 02:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
malignant narcissism and sociopathy
 
02:20:45.030 --> 02:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
so you know the judges under the guise
 
02:20:47.270 --> 02:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
of saying kids need two parents are
 
02:20:50.309 --> 02:20:50.319 align:start position:0%
forcing these kids to be with terribly
 
02:20:53.910 --> 02:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
terribly sick abusive people
 
02:20:53.920 --> 02:20:55.510 align:start position:0%
terribly sick abusive people
um

02:20:55.510 --> 02:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:58.389 --> 02:20:58.399 align:start position:0%
also the national council of juvenile
 
02:21:01.030 --> 02:21:01.040 align:start position:0%
and family court judges have stated
 
02:21:01.040 --> 02:21:01.990 align:start position:0%
and family court judges have stated
that

02:21:01.990 --> 02:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:03.110 align:start position:0%
that
um

02:21:03.110 --> 02:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:05.030 --> 02:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
courts shouldn't even take testimony on
 
02:21:07.510 --> 02:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
parental alienation
 
02:21:07.520 --> 02:21:08.389 align:start position:0%
parental alienation
and

02:21:08.389 --> 02:21:08.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:21:10.830 --> 02:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
you've got more fully
 
02:21:14.870 --> 02:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
um the information from them
 
02:21:14.880 --> 02:21:15.830 align:start position:0%
um the information from them
but

02:21:15.830 --> 02:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:21:15.840 --> 02:21:16.710 align:start position:0%
but
they

02:21:16.710 --> 02:21:16.720 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:21:19.510 --> 02:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh you know it says basically i'm sorry
 
02:21:21.830 --> 02:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
my dog is bothering me right now
 
02:21:21.840 --> 02:21:24.710 align:start position:0%
my dog is bothering me right now
um

02:21:24.710 --> 02:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:27.429 --> 02:21:27.439 align:start position:0%
you know testimony about parental
 
02:21:27.439 --> 02:21:29.110 align:start position:0%
you know testimony about parental
alienation

02:21:29.110 --> 02:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
alienation
 
02:21:30.870 --> 02:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
also needs to be
 
02:21:33.270 --> 02:21:33.280 align:start position:0%
uh prohibited in new hampshire courts
 
02:21:34.950 --> 02:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
and the courts aren't doing it so the
 
02:21:37.750 --> 02:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
legislature has to do that
 
02:21:37.760 --> 02:21:39.110 align:start position:0%
legislature has to do that
um

02:21:39.110 --> 02:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:39.120 --> 02:21:41.190 align:start position:0%
um
and

02:21:41.190 --> 02:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:21:43.190 --> 02:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
the claim of parental alienation is
 
02:21:45.349 --> 02:21:45.359 align:start position:0%
almost always made
 
02:21:45.359 --> 02:21:46.630 align:start position:0%
almost always made
after

02:21:46.630 --> 02:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
after
 
02:21:49.190 --> 02:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
an allegation of abuse
 
02:21:52.830 --> 02:21:52.840 align:start position:0%
domestic abuse or child abuse
 
02:21:57.590 --> 02:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
um you know and you know disgustingly
 
02:22:00.230 --> 02:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
uh judge foley actually wrote in an
 
02:22:00.240 --> 02:22:02.150 align:start position:0%
uh judge foley actually wrote in an
order

02:22:02.150 --> 02:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
order
 
02:22:04.630 --> 02:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
well i i i'd considered giving you an
 
02:22:06.389 --> 02:22:06.399 align:start position:0%
evidentiary hearing
 
02:22:08.550 --> 02:22:08.560 align:start position:0%
but um
 
02:22:11.190 --> 02:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
i decided not to because the gal says
 
02:22:13.349 --> 02:22:13.359 align:start position:0%
there's no evidence of abuse
 
02:22:15.670 --> 02:22:15.680 align:start position:0%
the gal lied
 
02:22:17.429 --> 02:22:17.439 align:start position:0%
i know bill breen
 
02:22:20.150 --> 02:22:20.160 align:start position:0%
she said that the uh dcyf report was
 
02:22:22.469 --> 02:22:22.479 align:start position:0%
unfounded i've seen it
 
02:22:24.790 --> 02:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
it was an incomplete assessment because
 
02:22:27.270 --> 02:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
the man went back home to washington dc
 
02:22:30.870 --> 02:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:33.349 --> 02:22:33.359 align:start position:0%
the gal also lied about contacting other
 
02:22:34.790 --> 02:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
witnesses and she had a stack of
 
02:22:36.469 --> 02:22:36.479 align:start position:0%
affidavits on her desk from people that
 
02:22:38.950 --> 02:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
had seen this man abuse the child
 
02:22:41.590 --> 02:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
and and the child made a disclosure of
 
02:22:44.150 --> 02:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
abuse to her which she was re required
 
02:22:46.230 --> 02:22:46.240 align:start position:0%
to report to dcyf
 
02:22:49.030 --> 02:22:49.040 align:start position:0%
and she did not do that
 
02:22:52.469 --> 02:22:52.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:54.150 --> 02:22:54.160 align:start position:0%
and then she wrote in the gal report
 
02:22:58.630 --> 02:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
there's there's no uh evidence of abuse
 
02:22:58.640 --> 02:23:00.230 align:start position:0%
there's there's no uh evidence of abuse
so

02:23:00.230 --> 02:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:23:02.309 --> 02:23:02.319 align:start position:0%
it's disgusting she told me in her
 
02:23:02.319 --> 02:23:03.270 align:start position:0%
it's disgusting she told me in her
office

02:23:03.270 --> 02:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
office
 
02:23:05.110 --> 02:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
we're going to do reunification because
 
02:23:07.270 --> 02:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
it's what the judge wants this and by
 
02:23:08.870 --> 02:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
the way there was never an evidentiary
 
02:23:10.550 --> 02:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
hearing in this case
 
02:23:13.910 --> 02:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
not any it was denied
 
02:23:13.920 --> 02:23:14.790 align:start position:0%
not any it was denied
um

02:23:14.790 --> 02:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:16.469 --> 02:23:16.479 align:start position:0%
and you know i'll tell you what the
 
02:23:19.910 --> 02:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
reason is it was denied because this
 
02:23:21.590 --> 02:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
woman wouldn't go
 
02:23:21.600 --> 02:23:22.389 align:start position:0%
woman wouldn't go
for

02:23:22.389 --> 02:23:22.399 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:23:24.389 --> 02:23:24.399 align:start position:0%
the alienation assessment with someone
 
02:23:26.070 --> 02:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
that was known
 
02:23:26.080 --> 02:23:27.349 align:start position:0%
that was known
to

02:23:27.349 --> 02:23:27.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:23:30.309 --> 02:23:30.319 align:start position:0%
diagnose parental alienation
 
02:23:33.110 --> 02:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
practically all the time
 
02:23:35.190 --> 02:23:35.200 align:start position:0%
um and you know if the judge couldn't
 
02:23:37.590 --> 02:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
have his choice of witnesses he wasn't
 
02:23:39.750 --> 02:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
going to let any in
 
02:23:42.790 --> 02:23:42.800 align:start position:0%
um at some point there was
 
02:23:45.190 --> 02:23:45.200 align:start position:0%
a psychological evaluation of this kid
 
02:23:47.110 --> 02:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
and the psychologist
 
02:23:49.750 --> 02:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
recommended no contact with the abusive
 
02:23:49.760 --> 02:23:51.990 align:start position:0%
recommended no contact with the abusive
parent

02:23:51.990 --> 02:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
parent
 
02:23:55.190 --> 02:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
the judge before that report was written
 
02:23:56.870 --> 02:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
prohibited it from being introduced as
 
02:23:56.880 --> 02:23:58.950 align:start position:0%
prohibited it from being introduced as
evidence

02:23:58.950 --> 02:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
02:24:00.870 --> 02:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
so of course he never had a hearing so
 
02:24:02.469 --> 02:24:02.479 align:start position:0%
there was no chance to introduce it as
 
02:24:02.479 --> 02:24:04.630 align:start position:0%
there was no chance to introduce it as
evidence

02:24:04.630 --> 02:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
02:24:04.640 --> 02:24:06.950 align:start position:0%
evidence
um

02:24:06.950 --> 02:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:09.349 --> 02:24:09.359 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire courts are a mess
 
02:24:10.630 --> 02:24:10.640 align:start position:0%
but with resp
 
02:24:14.230 --> 02:24:14.240 align:start position:0%
with respect to reunification therapy
 
02:24:16.950 --> 02:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
i absolutely agree that this is child
 
02:24:16.960 --> 02:24:19.670 align:start position:0%
i absolutely agree that this is child
abuse

02:24:19.670 --> 02:24:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:21.830 --> 02:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
countries like the uk have gone to a
 
02:24:23.670 --> 02:24:23.680 align:start position:0%
different model there's been so much
 
02:24:26.830 --> 02:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
research on child abuse
 
02:24:31.510 --> 02:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
um in the last 20 years and our laws are
 
02:24:33.910 --> 02:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
so far behind
 
02:24:36.870 --> 02:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
the uk model is now called the
 
02:24:39.910 --> 02:24:39.920 align:start position:0%
coercive control model
 
02:24:42.389 --> 02:24:42.399 align:start position:0%
and i did attend i think it was in
 
02:24:42.399 --> 02:24:43.590 align:start position:0%
and i did attend i think it was in
december

02:24:43.590 --> 02:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
december
 
02:24:46.309 --> 02:24:46.319 align:start position:0%
a zoom seminar
 
02:24:49.830 --> 02:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
uh by the dc superior court judges and
 
02:24:51.670 --> 02:24:51.680 align:start position:0%
they are in the process of training all
 
02:24:53.349 --> 02:24:53.359 align:start position:0%
their family court judges on the
 
02:24:59.670 --> 02:24:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:01.349 --> 02:25:01.359 align:start position:0%
i think that's going to better serve
 
02:25:03.110 --> 02:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
people and i think that's the direction
 
02:25:06.950 --> 02:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:08.389 --> 02:25:08.399 align:start position:0%
and the other thing is is with my
 
02:25:11.190 --> 02:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
written testimony i also submitted for
 
02:25:12.550 --> 02:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
the record the national council of
 
02:25:14.150 --> 02:25:14.160 align:start position:0%
juvenile and family court judges
 
02:25:17.270 --> 02:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
judicial guide to child safety
 
02:25:20.710 --> 02:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
and i submitted a scholarly article
 
02:25:23.990 --> 02:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
written by a man on parental alienation
 
02:25:26.230 --> 02:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
that basically
 
02:25:28.070 --> 02:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
says that reunification therapy is
 
02:25:28.080 --> 02:25:29.030 align:start position:0%
says that reunification therapy is
terrible

02:25:29.030 --> 02:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
terrible
 
02:25:30.950 --> 02:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
i happened to get a hold of him
 
02:25:32.870 --> 02:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
yesterday in preparation for the
 
02:25:32.880 --> 02:25:34.389 align:start position:0%
yesterday in preparation for the
testimony

02:25:34.389 --> 02:25:34.399 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:25:37.830 --> 02:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
and he wished me luck he said you know
 
02:25:39.349 --> 02:25:39.359 align:start position:0%
please make sure the legislature
 
02:25:42.389 --> 02:25:42.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:42.399 --> 02:25:44.630 align:start position:0%
 
questions

02:25:44.630 --> 02:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:25:48.790 --> 02:25:48.800 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions for um
 
02:25:53.270 --> 02:25:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:56.630 --> 02:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
i do see one representative grossman you
 
02:26:00.630 --> 02:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:02.469 --> 02:26:02.479 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
02:26:04.550 --> 02:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sure who can answer this
 
02:26:04.560 --> 02:26:06.150 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sure who can answer this
question

02:26:06.150 --> 02:26:06.160 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:26:07.190 --> 02:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
this is
 
02:26:10.790 --> 02:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
currently reunification therapy
 
02:26:15.429 --> 02:26:15.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:18.070 --> 02:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
um actually oh i i meant to mention this
 
02:26:19.349 --> 02:26:19.359 align:start position:0%
and i forgot
 
02:26:22.630 --> 02:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
cpt codes are for medical diagnoses
 
02:26:25.190 --> 02:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
in the mental health field
 
02:26:27.270 --> 02:26:27.280 align:start position:0%
it's the diagnostic and statistical
 
02:26:30.389 --> 02:26:30.399 align:start position:0%
manual so it's actually a dsm code and
 
02:26:31.830 --> 02:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
that is true
 
02:26:34.389 --> 02:26:34.399 align:start position:0%
i believe for close to 20 years
 
02:26:36.870 --> 02:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
proponents of parental alienation have
 
02:26:39.670 --> 02:26:39.680 align:start position:0%
tried to get that code into the dsm
 
02:26:42.150 --> 02:26:42.160 align:start position:0%
and they have failed every time they are
 
02:26:44.710 --> 02:26:44.720 align:start position:0%
it is flat out rejected
 
02:26:46.830 --> 02:26:46.840 align:start position:0%
and you know i think the last
 
02:26:48.950 --> 02:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
dsm uh
 
02:26:48.960 --> 02:26:49.990 align:start position:0%
dsm uh
revision

02:26:49.990 --> 02:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
revision
 
02:26:52.150 --> 02:26:52.160 align:start position:0%
was i can't remember precisely when but
 
02:26:53.750 --> 02:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
it was within the last five years they
 
02:26:56.710 --> 02:26:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:59.270 --> 02:26:59.280 align:start position:0%
have a follow-up
 
02:27:00.710 --> 02:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
okay follow up
 
02:27:03.990 --> 02:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
thank you so
 
02:27:05.270 --> 02:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
how are
 
02:27:06.710 --> 02:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
if people are being ordered to
 
02:27:09.590 --> 02:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
reunification therapy
 
02:27:09.600 --> 02:27:10.389 align:start position:0%
reunification therapy
it's

02:27:10.389 --> 02:27:10.399 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:27:13.510 --> 02:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
and i've i've heard
 
02:27:17.349 --> 02:27:17.359 align:start position:0%
about why it's not a good idea um
 
02:27:19.670 --> 02:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
how are they billing it is it always out
 
02:27:21.990 --> 02:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
of pocket or
 
02:27:23.670 --> 02:27:23.680 align:start position:0%
are they able to get
 
02:27:23.680 --> 02:27:26.070 align:start position:0%
are they able to get
providers

02:27:26.070 --> 02:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
providers
 
02:27:27.830 --> 02:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
i mean i think that that's sort of the
 
02:27:30.389 --> 02:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
issue in this as well but i'm just
 
02:27:32.630 --> 02:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
curious right now if somebody's ordered
 
02:27:35.750 --> 02:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
to reunification therapy
 
02:27:35.760 --> 02:27:38.309 align:start position:0%
to reunification therapy
and

02:27:38.309 --> 02:27:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:38.319 --> 02:27:39.990 align:start position:0%
 
well

02:27:39.990 --> 02:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:27:42.790 --> 02:27:42.800 align:start position:0%
okay the statute authorizes judges to
 
02:27:45.990 --> 02:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
order therapy taking into consideration
 
02:27:48.550 --> 02:27:48.560 align:start position:0%
the party's insurance
 
02:27:50.070 --> 02:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
they very well know that this
 
02:27:52.870 --> 02:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
reunification therapy is not covered by
 
02:27:52.880 --> 02:27:54.070 align:start position:0%
reunification therapy is not covered by
insurance

02:27:54.070 --> 02:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
02:27:54.080 --> 02:27:55.110 align:start position:0%
insurance
but

02:27:55.110 --> 02:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:27:57.429 --> 02:27:57.439 align:start position:0%
as they say when there's money to be had
 
02:28:00.150 --> 02:28:00.160 align:start position:0%
they order it anyway
 
02:28:01.990 --> 02:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
um and and
 
02:28:05.030 --> 02:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
you know people have gone broke they
 
02:28:08.309 --> 02:28:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:10.550 --> 02:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
and by the way there's no statutory
 
02:28:12.389 --> 02:28:12.399 align:start position:0%
authorization for judges to order
 
02:28:12.399 --> 02:28:13.590 align:start position:0%
authorization for judges to order
parental

02:28:13.590 --> 02:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
parental
 
02:28:13.600 --> 02:28:14.630 align:start position:0%
parental
um

02:28:14.630 --> 02:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:16.950 --> 02:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
you know assessments
 
02:28:19.990 --> 02:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
in the context of discovery in my mind
 
02:28:21.750 --> 02:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
that is the judge hand-picking his own
 
02:28:21.760 --> 02:28:22.950 align:start position:0%
that is the judge hand-picking his own
witnesses

02:28:22.950 --> 02:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
witnesses
 
02:28:25.429 --> 02:28:25.439 align:start position:0%
and it is wrong it doesn't happen in any
 
02:28:28.389 --> 02:28:28.399 align:start position:0%
other area of law even dcyf doesn't
 
02:28:31.750 --> 02:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
accept the judge's choice of witnesses
 
02:28:33.510 --> 02:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
which is mostly what i practiced when i
 
02:28:38.150 --> 02:28:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:40.389 --> 02:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
but people are just paying out of pocket
 
02:28:41.990 --> 02:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
and and
 
02:28:44.389 --> 02:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
you know in particular with judge foley
 
02:28:46.630 --> 02:28:46.640 align:start position:0%
i'm perfectly aware that he has he
 
02:28:48.070 --> 02:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
stated to people
 
02:28:49.910 --> 02:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
um you won't like the order if you don't
 
02:28:50.950 --> 02:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
do this
 
02:28:52.550 --> 02:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
and you know i
 
02:28:55.990 --> 02:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
i quoted i one supreme court case
 
02:28:58.630 --> 02:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
where judge foley was the judge and the
 
02:29:01.349 --> 02:29:01.359 align:start position:0%
wording at the very top of the opinion
 
02:29:04.070 --> 02:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
was the parties agreed to an assessment
 
02:29:05.990 --> 02:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
by dr ben garber
 
02:29:08.309 --> 02:29:08.319 align:start position:0%
um you know blah blah blah and then they
 
02:29:10.630 --> 02:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
went on to have the opinion well if
 
02:29:13.270 --> 02:29:13.280 align:start position:0%
foley's the judge i can tell you
 
02:29:14.790 --> 02:29:14.800 align:start position:0%
the mother agreed because she was afraid
 
02:29:17.190 --> 02:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
the kid was going to be placed with the
 
02:29:18.950 --> 02:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
abusive parent
 
02:29:18.960 --> 02:29:20.630 align:start position:0%
abusive parent
um

02:29:20.630 --> 02:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:22.469 --> 02:29:22.479 align:start position:0%
it's it's not
 
02:29:24.309 --> 02:29:24.319 align:start position:0%
it's not an agreement
 
02:29:26.150 --> 02:29:26.160 align:start position:0%
it's it's coercion by the court
 
02:29:27.830 --> 02:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
threatening to take your kids and hand
 
02:29:29.429 --> 02:29:29.439 align:start position:0%
them to the abusive parent if you don't
 
02:29:30.630 --> 02:29:30.640 align:start position:0%
do this
 
02:29:33.110 --> 02:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
and and it's happened
 
02:29:34.469 --> 02:29:34.479 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:29:38.230 --> 02:29:38.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative belanger do you
 
02:29:40.070 --> 02:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
02:29:43.429 --> 02:29:43.439 align:start position:0%
i do madam chair thank you um
 
02:29:45.910 --> 02:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
my question is to um
 
02:29:47.349 --> 02:29:47.359 align:start position:0%
miss wormy
 
02:29:47.359 --> 02:29:49.110 align:start position:0%
miss wormy
um

02:29:49.110 --> 02:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:52.070 --> 02:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
how is dcyf billing for reunification
 
02:29:52.080 --> 02:29:54.950 align:start position:0%
how is dcyf billing for reunification
therapy

02:29:54.950 --> 02:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:58.550 --> 02:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
dcyf has a statutory mandate to reunify
 
02:29:58.560 --> 02:30:00.389 align:start position:0%
dcyf has a statutory mandate to reunify
families

02:30:00.389 --> 02:30:00.399 align:start position:0%
families
 
02:30:03.670 --> 02:30:03.680 align:start position:0%
they don't call it reunification therapy
 
02:30:06.550 --> 02:30:06.560 align:start position:0%
what they have parents do is get therapy
 
02:30:08.870 --> 02:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
to address the reasons that they abused
 
02:30:11.030 --> 02:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
or neglected their kids
 
02:30:13.030 --> 02:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
and then they wait for a recommendation
 
02:30:14.630 --> 02:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
from the therapist to say yeah this
 
02:30:16.150 --> 02:30:16.160 align:start position:0%
parent understands that what they did
 
02:30:17.190 --> 02:30:17.200 align:start position:0%
was wrong
 
02:30:19.670 --> 02:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
the the parent has to own up to his
 
02:30:19.680 --> 02:30:21.349 align:start position:0%
the the parent has to own up to his
behavior

02:30:21.349 --> 02:30:21.359 align:start position:0%
behavior
 
02:30:23.270 --> 02:30:23.280 align:start position:0%
and take steps
 
02:30:26.550 --> 02:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
to address their behavior
 
02:30:29.510 --> 02:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
the the current model in custody cases
 
02:30:31.830 --> 02:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
is there's no requirement that an
 
02:30:33.349 --> 02:30:33.359 align:start position:0%
abusive parent
 
02:30:35.349 --> 02:30:35.359 align:start position:0%
own up to the behavior admit it
 
02:30:35.359 --> 02:30:36.950 align:start position:0%
own up to the behavior admit it
apologize

02:30:36.950 --> 02:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
apologize
 
02:30:38.469 --> 02:30:38.479 align:start position:0%
nothing like that
 
02:30:40.309 --> 02:30:40.319 align:start position:0%
they're just forcing these kids to go
 
02:30:42.389 --> 02:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
with people and by the way some of these
 
02:30:44.309 --> 02:30:44.319 align:start position:0%
personality disorders
 
02:30:47.830 --> 02:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
are completely intractable
 
02:30:48.790 --> 02:30:48.800 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:30:51.990 --> 02:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
malignant narcissism and sociopathy
 
02:30:53.190 --> 02:30:53.200 align:start position:0%
none of these
 
02:30:53.200 --> 02:30:54.550 align:start position:0%
none of these
conditions

02:30:54.550 --> 02:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
02:30:56.469 --> 02:30:56.479 align:start position:0%
are amenable to therapy these are
 
02:30:58.710 --> 02:30:58.720 align:start position:0%
basically lifelong conditions it's it's
 
02:31:00.150 --> 02:31:00.160 align:start position:0%
not going to help these parents aren't
 
02:31:02.950 --> 02:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
going to learn to not be abusive
 
02:31:04.550 --> 02:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
follow-up manager
 
02:31:06.790 --> 02:31:06.800 align:start position:0%
one follow-up yes
 
02:31:09.429 --> 02:31:09.439 align:start position:0%
so because you didn't technically answer
 
02:31:10.630 --> 02:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
the question
 
02:31:12.870 --> 02:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
so but if i understand this correctly
 
02:31:14.950 --> 02:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
you're saying dcyf doesn't bill for
 
02:31:16.790 --> 02:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
reunification therapy
 
02:31:20.389 --> 02:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
oh no it's it's not done in dcyf it
 
02:31:22.469 --> 02:31:22.479 align:start position:0%
that's not what they call it at all
 
02:31:26.389 --> 02:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:28.870 --> 02:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
thank you next we have uh representative
 
02:31:32.469 --> 02:31:32.479 align:start position:0%
petrigno has a question
 
02:31:34.630 --> 02:31:34.640 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair thank you for
 
02:31:36.230 --> 02:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
taking my question i just have a point
 
02:31:38.630 --> 02:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
of clarification i thought i heard you
 
02:31:42.469 --> 02:31:42.479 align:start position:0%
uh mentioned earlier that the cpt code
 
02:31:45.510 --> 02:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
is for physical uh conditions but it
 
02:31:47.830 --> 02:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate to have the dsm
 
02:31:51.510 --> 02:31:51.520 align:start position:0%
code for uh reunification therapy if if
 
02:31:53.510 --> 02:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
that's the case in your opinion
 
02:31:55.349 --> 02:31:55.359 align:start position:0%
with this legislation
 
02:31:57.349 --> 02:31:57.359 align:start position:0%
as written addressed the issue of
 
02:32:00.950 --> 02:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:00.960 --> 02:32:03.429 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:32:03.429 --> 02:32:03.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:05.990 --> 02:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
well there is no dsm code for parental
 
02:32:08.710 --> 02:32:08.720 align:start position:0%
alienation because they refuse to put it
 
02:32:11.590 --> 02:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
in the dsm
 
02:32:13.910 --> 02:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
but no i think the bill does have to be
 
02:32:16.309 --> 02:32:16.319 align:start position:0%
amended in my written testimony states
 
02:32:19.710 --> 02:32:19.720 align:start position:0%
that i i think the legislature needs to
 
02:32:22.230 --> 02:32:22.240 align:start position:0%
unambiguously prohibit
 
02:32:25.270 --> 02:32:25.280 align:start position:0%
reunification therapy or even i i
 
02:32:26.710 --> 02:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
actually think it would be a good idea
 
02:32:29.030 --> 02:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
if the legislature
 
02:32:29.040 --> 02:32:30.710 align:start position:0%
if the legislature
uh

02:32:30.710 --> 02:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:32:32.870 --> 02:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
prohibited testimony on parental
 
02:32:34.790 --> 02:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
alienation the national council of
 
02:32:36.389 --> 02:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
juvenile and family court judges
 
02:32:39.110 --> 02:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
recommends that any references to
 
02:32:40.710 --> 02:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
parental alienation be struck from the
 
02:32:43.270 --> 02:32:43.280 align:start position:0%
record because it's junk science
 
02:32:45.670 --> 02:32:45.680 align:start position:0%
yes thank you i understand that dsm
 
02:32:47.910 --> 02:32:47.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a code for that as well so
 
02:32:50.150 --> 02:32:50.160 align:start position:0%
i apologize but you get the gist of my
 
02:32:57.030 --> 02:32:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:58.550 --> 02:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
thank you will you take another question
 
02:32:58.560 --> 02:33:00.469 align:start position:0%
thank you will you take another question
please

02:33:00.469 --> 02:33:00.479 align:start position:0%
please
 
02:33:00.479 --> 02:33:01.590 align:start position:0%
please
yes

02:33:01.590 --> 02:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:33:05.270 --> 02:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:07.030 --> 02:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
yes thank you and thank you for taking
 
02:33:08.550 --> 02:33:08.560 align:start position:0%
my question
 
02:33:08.560 --> 02:33:09.510 align:start position:0%
my question
um

02:33:09.510 --> 02:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:11.110 --> 02:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
would you
 
02:33:11.120 --> 02:33:12.710 align:start position:0%
would you
consider

02:33:12.710 --> 02:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
consider
 
02:33:17.110 --> 02:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
uh that this issue might be addressed by
 
02:33:19.910 --> 02:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh restricting
 
02:33:23.030 --> 02:33:23.040 align:start position:0%
the therapies that
 
02:33:26.230 --> 02:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
can be ordered by the court to
 
02:33:31.270 --> 02:33:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:34.309 --> 02:33:34.319 align:start position:0%
no because so licensed clinical social
 
02:33:36.389 --> 02:33:36.399 align:start position:0%
workers are licensed
 
02:33:38.150 --> 02:33:38.160 align:start position:0%
and and they are permitted in new
 
02:33:40.389 --> 02:33:40.399 align:start position:0%
hampshire to do therapy
 
02:33:40.399 --> 02:33:41.349 align:start position:0%
hampshire to do therapy
um

02:33:41.349 --> 02:33:41.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:43.190 --> 02:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
i i think i mentioned that it's
 
02:33:45.590 --> 02:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
unethical for psychologists to engage in
 
02:33:48.790 --> 02:33:48.800 align:start position:0%
it so the vast majority of them
 
02:33:48.800 --> 02:33:50.230 align:start position:0%
it so the vast majority of them
are

02:33:50.230 --> 02:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:33:52.469 --> 02:33:52.479 align:start position:0%
licensed clinical social workers
 
02:33:55.030 --> 02:33:55.040 align:start position:0%
i do know that
 
02:33:57.910 --> 02:33:57.920 align:start position:0%
one therapist that judge foley ordered
 
02:33:59.190 --> 02:33:59.200 align:start position:0%
the woman
 
02:34:01.270 --> 02:34:01.280 align:start position:0%
from portsmouth to go to
 
02:34:03.910 --> 02:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
uh turned in her license
 
02:34:06.630 --> 02:34:06.640 align:start position:0%
uh within days of of the judge's order
 
02:34:09.670 --> 02:34:09.680 align:start position:0%
to go there and we recently discovered
 
02:34:12.950 --> 02:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
that she's back in business calling it
 
02:34:14.870 --> 02:34:14.880 align:start position:0%
you know family coaching or something
 
02:34:17.990 --> 02:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
like that so she's just
 
02:34:19.750 --> 02:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
gone right along and she's still doing
 
02:34:23.910 --> 02:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:26.790 --> 02:34:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:32.150 --> 02:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:34.630 --> 02:34:34.640 align:start position:0%
seeing none will go to the next person
 
02:34:42.950 --> 02:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:42.960 --> 02:34:43.670 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:34:43.670 --> 02:34:43.680 align:start position:0%

02:34:45.349 --> 02:34:45.359 align:start position:0%

speak would be
 
02:34:53.190 --> 02:34:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:56.389 --> 02:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:59.349 --> 02:34:59.359 align:start position:0%

important issue
 
02:35:08.080 --> 02:35:08.950 align:start position:0%
important issue
um

02:35:08.950 --> 02:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:11.590 --> 02:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
this again is alex giordano i spoke
 
02:35:11.600 --> 02:35:12.790 align:start position:0%
this again is alex giordano i spoke
earlier

02:35:12.790 --> 02:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
02:35:15.510 --> 02:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
i also testified on this very issue a
 
02:35:17.590 --> 02:35:17.600 align:start position:0%
couple years ago i just want to make
 
02:35:18.870 --> 02:35:18.880 align:start position:0%
some really quick points of
 
02:35:22.950 --> 02:35:22.960 align:start position:0%
clarification if i may i'll be brief
 
02:35:22.960 --> 02:35:24.469 align:start position:0%
clarification if i may i'll be brief
um

02:35:24.469 --> 02:35:24.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:27.990 --> 02:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
first and foremost um i actually never
 
02:35:30.389 --> 02:35:30.399 align:start position:0%
did or my child rather was never
 
02:35:32.630 --> 02:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
fortunately um
 
02:35:32.640 --> 02:35:33.590 align:start position:0%
fortunately um
uh

02:35:33.590 --> 02:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:35:35.590 --> 02:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
forced to suffer through so-called
 
02:35:37.670 --> 02:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
reunification therapy
 
02:35:40.950 --> 02:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
um in my case um
 
02:35:43.910 --> 02:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
the father also wasn't interested in it
 
02:35:43.920 --> 02:35:44.870 align:start position:0%
the father also wasn't interested in it
because

02:35:44.870 --> 02:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:35:47.190 --> 02:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
in my case he found out that he would
 
02:35:49.670 --> 02:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
also have to pay for it and he he that
 
02:35:51.349 --> 02:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
didn't sit well with him so
 
02:35:53.429 --> 02:35:53.439 align:start position:0%
uh and then the other and combined with
 
02:35:53.439 --> 02:35:55.030 align:start position:0%
uh and then the other and combined with
that

02:35:55.030 --> 02:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:35:57.670 --> 02:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
the reunification therapist who's a
 
02:35:59.510 --> 02:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
who's the most frequently appointed
 
02:36:01.270 --> 02:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
therapist i think in the entire state of
 
02:36:04.070 --> 02:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire she's out of exeter
 
02:36:06.710 --> 02:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
she withdrew she voluntarily withdrew
 
02:36:10.389 --> 02:36:10.399 align:start position:0%
from the case um in part because
 
02:36:13.590 --> 02:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
um i busted up to her and i said we're
 
02:36:15.910 --> 02:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
going to bring this matter to an ethical
 
02:36:17.270 --> 02:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
board and we're going to have you
 
02:36:19.190 --> 02:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
investigated because this is what's
 
02:36:21.270 --> 02:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
happening with her and what the courts
 
02:36:23.990 --> 02:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
do and the judges actually
 
02:36:25.510 --> 02:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
uh push this
 
02:36:27.110 --> 02:36:27.120 align:start position:0%
is they have the reunification
 
02:36:29.910 --> 02:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
therapists decide on their own without
 
02:36:32.070 --> 02:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
even meeting the child by the way
 
02:36:34.230 --> 02:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
whether or not their very expensive
 
02:36:37.270 --> 02:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
reunification therapy is needed
 
02:36:39.910 --> 02:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
and the national assoc association of
 
02:36:41.990 --> 02:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
social workers uh executive director
 
02:36:43.670 --> 02:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
came right out and said
 
02:36:46.469 --> 02:36:46.479 align:start position:0%
what that's crazy that's you know that's
 
02:36:48.550 --> 02:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
that's completely unethical
 
02:36:51.910 --> 02:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
um so combined with that she voluntarily
 
02:36:54.309 --> 02:36:54.319 align:start position:0%
withdrew the father
 
02:36:56.230 --> 02:36:56.240 align:start position:0%
who sent me a text message saying we
 
02:36:58.950 --> 02:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
both know uh therapy is bs
 
02:37:01.270 --> 02:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
would not contact her
 
02:37:01.280 --> 02:37:02.070 align:start position:0%
would not contact her
so

02:37:02.070 --> 02:37:02.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:37:02.080 --> 02:37:03.270 align:start position:0%
so
um

02:37:03.270 --> 02:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:37:06.070 --> 02:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
i did not we didn't we never engaged in
 
02:37:08.070 --> 02:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
reunification therapy
 
02:37:09.990 --> 02:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
um also another really quick
 
02:37:11.590 --> 02:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
clarification before i want before i
 
02:37:13.429 --> 02:37:13.439 align:start position:0%
make my statement on this bill
 
02:37:13.439 --> 02:37:15.910 align:start position:0%
make my statement on this bill
um

02:37:15.910 --> 02:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:19.910 --> 02:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
i legally redomiciled in another state
 
02:37:21.830 --> 02:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
because there was never any hearings or
 
02:37:24.070 --> 02:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
trial because there was always this
 
02:37:24.080 --> 02:37:25.910 align:start position:0%
trial because there was always this
drive

02:37:25.910 --> 02:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
drive
 
02:37:29.030 --> 02:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
by the judges not by the parents by the
 
02:37:29.040 --> 02:37:30.070 align:start position:0%
by the judges not by the parents by the
judge

02:37:30.070 --> 02:37:30.080 align:start position:0%
judge
 
02:37:32.870 --> 02:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
to force this reunification therapy
 
02:37:34.790 --> 02:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to use that as a segue into
 
02:37:37.190 --> 02:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
my testimony now on this bill
 
02:37:39.190 --> 02:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
what this uh
 
02:37:41.510 --> 02:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
committee really needs to grasp
 
02:37:43.590 --> 02:37:43.600 align:start position:0%
is this is being
 
02:37:45.750 --> 02:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
reunification therapy is is being
 
02:37:45.760 --> 02:37:47.030 align:start position:0%
reunification therapy is is being
weaponized

02:37:47.030 --> 02:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
weaponized
 
02:37:49.190 --> 02:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
they are using it in fact to weaponize
 
02:37:50.870 --> 02:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
the abuser
 
02:37:53.830 --> 02:37:53.840 align:start position:0%
against the abused child and in some
 
02:37:56.150 --> 02:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
respects you know the the the women who
 
02:37:57.270 --> 02:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
are abused
 
02:38:00.710 --> 02:38:00.720 align:start position:0%
so if you're a protective parent
 
02:38:02.150 --> 02:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
and you
 
02:38:02.160 --> 02:38:04.710 align:start position:0%
and you
assert

02:38:04.710 --> 02:38:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:07.110 --> 02:38:07.120 align:start position:0%
abuse and in my case also very important
 
02:38:08.790 --> 02:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
to point out
 
02:38:10.710 --> 02:38:10.720 align:start position:0%
all the abuse
 
02:38:12.309 --> 02:38:12.319 align:start position:0%
evidence was
 
02:38:12.319 --> 02:38:13.429 align:start position:0%
evidence was
existed

02:38:13.429 --> 02:38:13.439 align:start position:0%
existed
 
02:38:13.439 --> 02:38:14.790 align:start position:0%
existed
long

02:38:14.790 --> 02:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
long
 
02:38:18.630 --> 02:38:18.640 align:start position:0%
and i stressed long before
 
02:38:20.469 --> 02:38:20.479 align:start position:0%
the father filed for divorce in the
 
02:38:22.070 --> 02:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
02:38:25.190 --> 02:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
so there is absolutely no way to ever to
 
02:38:27.349 --> 02:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
even remotely with a straight face try
 
02:38:29.750 --> 02:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
to translate this into
 
02:38:32.950 --> 02:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
so-called parental alienation
 
02:38:35.190 --> 02:38:35.200 align:start position:0%
essentially what the courts are doing is
 
02:38:37.990 --> 02:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
they are redefining protection of a
 
02:38:43.429 --> 02:38:43.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:45.429 --> 02:38:45.439 align:start position:0%
and they are using renification therapy
 
02:38:47.110 --> 02:38:47.120 align:start position:0%
in a sense that is
 
02:38:47.120 --> 02:38:48.070 align:start position:0%
in a sense that is
fairly

02:38:48.070 --> 02:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
fairly
 
02:38:50.469 --> 02:38:50.479 align:start position:0%
tantamount to taking a
 
02:38:52.870 --> 02:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
rape victim
 
02:38:55.910 --> 02:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
and forcing them to go out on a dinner
 
02:38:58.309 --> 02:38:58.319 align:start position:0%
date with their attacker
 
02:38:59.190 --> 02:38:59.200 align:start position:0%
it is
 
02:39:02.230 --> 02:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
no less demented
 
02:39:04.950 --> 02:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
it's criminal in fact
 
02:39:04.960 --> 02:39:06.309 align:start position:0%
it's criminal in fact
um

02:39:06.309 --> 02:39:06.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:09.349 --> 02:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
as many other folks earlier spoke
 
02:39:11.190 --> 02:39:11.200 align:start position:0%
there's a you know
 
02:39:13.429 --> 02:39:13.439 align:start position:0%
i don't really so much get myself
 
02:39:15.910 --> 02:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
involved in the lack of training
 
02:39:17.270 --> 02:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
certainly there's a lack of training a
 
02:39:19.510 --> 02:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
woman in exeter i think she uh
 
02:39:22.230 --> 02:39:22.240 align:start position:0%
specializes in eating disorders with
 
02:39:25.190 --> 02:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
with adults you know but it's it's
 
02:39:27.190 --> 02:39:27.200 align:start position:0%
whoever will unethically take on these
 
02:39:29.190 --> 02:39:29.200 align:start position:0%
jobs because they you know
 
02:39:30.870 --> 02:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
making a lot of money you're making 200
 
02:39:32.950 --> 02:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
bucks an hour and by the way it's per
 
02:39:35.190 --> 02:39:35.200 align:start position:0%
head it's not per family so if you've
 
02:39:37.349 --> 02:39:37.359 align:start position:0%
got three kids
 
02:39:38.950 --> 02:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
that and you're going
 
02:39:42.870 --> 02:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
that's 800 an hour i know moms that um
 
02:39:45.270 --> 02:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
ended up we had one mom in our group
 
02:39:47.990 --> 02:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
actually that ended up dying
 
02:39:49.510 --> 02:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
um and her family has given me
 
02:39:51.510 --> 02:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
permission they gave me her case anna
 
02:39:54.150 --> 02:39:54.160 align:start position:0%
korlikova died
 
02:39:56.070 --> 02:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
while fighting judge foley's order of
 
02:39:57.830 --> 02:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
reunification therapy so she could get
 
02:39:59.510 --> 02:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
her three kids back
 
02:40:01.349 --> 02:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
she was getting a treatment for breast
 
02:40:01.359 --> 02:40:03.030 align:start position:0%
she was getting a treatment for breast
cancer

02:40:03.030 --> 02:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
cancer
 
02:40:04.630 --> 02:40:04.640 align:start position:0%
and she stopped going to her treatments
 
02:40:07.349 --> 02:40:07.359 align:start position:0%
to pay for the reunification therapy
 
02:40:09.750 --> 02:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
that foley had ordered again with no
 
02:40:12.150 --> 02:40:12.160 align:start position:0%
hearing of evidence for trial
 
02:40:12.160 --> 02:40:13.110 align:start position:0%
hearing of evidence for trial
um

02:40:13.110 --> 02:40:13.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:16.550 --> 02:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
and this is this is kind of how it works
 
02:40:16.560 --> 02:40:17.349 align:start position:0%
and this is this is kind of how it works
the

02:40:17.349 --> 02:40:17.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:40:19.110 --> 02:40:19.120 align:start position:0%
arbitrary order
 
02:40:21.429 --> 02:40:21.439 align:start position:0%
of reunification therapy almost comes
 
02:40:23.670 --> 02:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
you could say before the judge even
 
02:40:25.190 --> 02:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
meets you or even looks at your case
 
02:40:27.349 --> 02:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
it's it's really a predetermination that
 
02:40:29.349 --> 02:40:29.359 align:start position:0%
this is what's going to happen
 
02:40:31.670 --> 02:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
um as i said earlier they declare they
 
02:40:32.790 --> 02:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
don't want to hear any evidence they
 
02:40:34.150 --> 02:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
just want to go into reunification
 
02:40:34.160 --> 02:40:35.270 align:start position:0%
just want to go into reunification
therapy

02:40:35.270 --> 02:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
therapy
 
02:40:37.270 --> 02:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
um i've never been in the sessions i've
 
02:40:38.710 --> 02:40:38.720 align:start position:0%
heard about them i know they're
 
02:40:41.270 --> 02:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
expensive um i cannot tell you how
 
02:40:43.510 --> 02:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
grateful i am that we didn't have to
 
02:40:44.950 --> 02:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
suffer through that
 
02:40:49.190 --> 02:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
um i know attorney wermer had mentioned
 
02:40:50.309 --> 02:40:50.319 align:start position:0%
that the
 
02:40:50.319 --> 02:40:52.550 align:start position:0%
that the
unethical

02:40:52.550 --> 02:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
unethical
 
02:40:55.030 --> 02:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
level of this is to such an extreme that
 
02:40:57.670 --> 02:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
they are willing to use
 
02:40:59.990 --> 02:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
therapists that are under investigation
 
02:41:02.550 --> 02:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
for unethical uh contact or professional
 
02:41:05.590 --> 02:41:05.600 align:start position:0%
misconduct uh one of those uh was
 
02:41:07.990 --> 02:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
actually in the process of losing her
 
02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:09.110 align:start position:0%
actually in the process of losing her
license

02:41:09.110 --> 02:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
license
 
02:41:11.030 --> 02:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
to the state of new hampshire
 
02:41:13.510 --> 02:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
ultimately voluntarily agreed to
 
02:41:15.190 --> 02:41:15.200 align:start position:0%
surrender it as part of a sort of a
 
02:41:17.030 --> 02:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
secret settlement if you will with the
 
02:41:17.040 --> 02:41:18.230 align:start position:0%
secret settlement if you will with the
state

02:41:18.230 --> 02:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:41:22.469 --> 02:41:22.479 align:start position:0%
and in my case um even though we had
 
02:41:23.990 --> 02:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
both parents
 
02:41:25.429 --> 02:41:25.439 align:start position:0%
that were not interested in this
 
02:41:27.830 --> 02:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
reunification therapy
 
02:41:30.389 --> 02:41:30.399 align:start position:0%
um here's judge foley he's just not
 
02:41:32.469 --> 02:41:32.479 align:start position:0%
going to take no for an answer you've
 
02:41:34.389 --> 02:41:34.399 align:start position:0%
got the other therapist who has
 
02:41:36.630 --> 02:41:36.640 align:start position:0%
withdrawn because she recognizes the
 
02:41:39.590 --> 02:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
unethical ramifications for her
 
02:41:40.790 --> 02:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
but you know
 
02:41:42.230 --> 02:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
don't let a little thing like that get
 
02:41:44.950 --> 02:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
in the way of judge foley he appoints
 
02:41:46.870 --> 02:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
this this therapist who's under
 
02:41:49.110 --> 02:41:49.120 align:start position:0%
investigation and threatens me
 
02:41:51.110 --> 02:41:51.120 align:start position:0%
personally that if i don't
 
02:41:54.389 --> 02:41:54.399 align:start position:0%
he says i recognize it as an option
 
02:41:56.070 --> 02:41:56.080 align:start position:0%
but if you don't recognize that option
 
02:41:58.309 --> 02:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
mrs giordano you're not going to like
 
02:42:02.150 --> 02:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
the consequences one minute please
 
02:42:02.160 --> 02:42:02.870 align:start position:0%
the consequences one minute please
so

02:42:02.870 --> 02:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:42:05.990 --> 02:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
yes i appreciate that so
 
02:42:08.389 --> 02:42:08.399 align:start position:0%
what you need to understand is this is
 
02:42:11.590 --> 02:42:11.600 align:start position:0%
being used to it's usually essentially a
 
02:42:13.429 --> 02:42:13.439 align:start position:0%
theft by extortion
 
02:42:15.750 --> 02:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
if you don't jump through our hoops and
 
02:42:17.590 --> 02:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
you pay the money
 
02:42:19.429 --> 02:42:19.439 align:start position:0%
we're gonna take your kid away doesn't
 
02:42:20.790 --> 02:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
matter evidence doesn't have anything to
 
02:42:21.910 --> 02:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
do with it
 
02:42:21.920 --> 02:42:22.710 align:start position:0%
do with it
your

02:42:22.710 --> 02:42:22.720 align:start position:0%
your
 
02:42:25.030 --> 02:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
you know earlier uh rhonda spoke she
 
02:42:27.670 --> 02:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
broke my heart because i couldn't have
 
02:42:30.389 --> 02:42:30.399 align:start position:0%
agreed with her testimony more
 
02:42:32.309 --> 02:42:32.319 align:start position:0%
they are essentially this is just
 
02:42:34.630 --> 02:42:34.640 align:start position:0%
another form of abuse you are trying to
 
02:42:36.070 --> 02:42:36.080 align:start position:0%
tell a child
 
02:42:38.389 --> 02:42:38.399 align:start position:0%
that their normal fear of somebody who
 
02:42:40.630 --> 02:42:40.640 align:start position:0%
beat them up is not normal
 
02:42:42.230 --> 02:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
and i want to touch really quickly i
 
02:42:43.590 --> 02:42:43.600 align:start position:0%
know there's been a lot of discussion of
 
02:42:45.910 --> 02:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
how effective this bill is
 
02:42:47.429 --> 02:42:47.439 align:start position:0%
a couple years ago the state of new
 
02:42:50.870 --> 02:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire made uh the news by
 
02:42:53.270 --> 02:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
passing the first gay
 
02:42:55.590 --> 02:42:55.600 align:start position:0%
conversion therapy bill
 
02:42:57.830 --> 02:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
and if you look at that bill
 
02:42:59.510 --> 02:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
that bill will guide you to how this
 
02:43:01.110 --> 02:43:01.120 align:start position:0%
bill should be amended
 
02:43:04.230 --> 02:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
what that bill did is it prohibited
 
02:43:04.240 --> 02:43:05.910 align:start position:0%
what that bill did is it prohibited
therapists

02:43:05.910 --> 02:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
therapists
 
02:43:08.469 --> 02:43:08.479 align:start position:0%
from administering gay conversion
 
02:43:08.479 --> 02:43:09.670 align:start position:0%

coordinator for the judicial branch and
 
02:44:32.630 --> 02:44:32.640 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to speak briefly to the
 
02:44:33.990 --> 02:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
bill as written
 
02:44:36.710 --> 02:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
which would prohibit
 
02:44:40.870 --> 02:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
any counseling for anybody or for to
 
02:44:43.030 --> 02:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
for counseling that does not have a cpt
 
02:44:45.110 --> 02:44:45.120 align:start position:0%
medical code
 
02:44:46.389 --> 02:44:46.399 align:start position:0%
and my concern
 
02:44:48.790 --> 02:44:48.800 align:start position:0%
is really an unintended consequences and
 
02:44:50.630 --> 02:44:50.640 align:start position:0%
tying the court's hands relative to
 
02:44:54.710 --> 02:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
counseling um without sort of having
 
02:44:56.550 --> 02:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
heard testimony as just sort of the
 
02:44:59.030 --> 02:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
extent of that other than perhaps cpt
 
02:45:01.349 --> 02:45:01.359 align:start position:0%
codes are not even the appropriate codes
 
02:45:03.750 --> 02:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
that that were contemplated in the
 
02:45:05.910 --> 02:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
purpose behind this bill we have
 
02:45:08.230 --> 02:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
significant concerns that there may be
 
02:45:10.950 --> 02:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
some significant unintended consequences
 
02:45:10.960 --> 02:45:12.630 align:start position:0%
some significant unintended consequences
that

02:45:12.630 --> 02:45:12.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:45:15.110 --> 02:45:15.120 align:start position:0%
would limit the scope of of counseling
 
02:45:15.120 --> 02:45:16.070 align:start position:0%
would limit the scope of of counseling
and

02:45:16.070 --> 02:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:45:17.590 --> 02:45:17.600 align:start position:0%
uh therapies
 
02:45:19.670 --> 02:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
that are appropriate and are are
 
02:45:19.680 --> 02:45:21.110 align:start position:0%
that are appropriate and are are
necessary

02:45:21.110 --> 02:45:21.120 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
02:45:21.120 --> 02:45:22.469 align:start position:0%
necessary
um

02:45:22.469 --> 02:45:22.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:45:24.469 --> 02:45:24.479 align:start position:0%
so we have we just have significant
 
02:45:28.150 --> 02:45:28.160 align:start position:0%
concerns with with that
 
02:45:29.910 --> 02:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
and also
 
02:45:29.920 --> 02:45:30.630 align:start position:0%
and also
well

02:45:30.630 --> 02:45:30.640 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:45:32.150 --> 02:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
with that i would be happy to take any
 
02:45:36.710 --> 02:45:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:43.670 --> 02:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:45.510 --> 02:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
seeing none i'm just

02:45:51.670 --> 02:45:51.680 align:start position:0%
question from representative altschiller
 
02:45:55.750 --> 02:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:58.230 --> 02:45:58.240 align:start position:0%
thank you i'll lower my hand in the
 
02:46:01.269 --> 02:46:01.279 align:start position:0%
participants list now um mr had thank

you very much for being with us today um
 
02:46:06.309 --> 02:46:06.319 align:start position:0%
you just met you just mentioned that um
 
02:46:08.389 --> 02:46:08.399 align:start position:0%
this bill could limit the scope of
 
02:46:11.590 --> 02:46:11.600 align:start position:0%
counseling services that are available
 
02:46:14.710 --> 02:46:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:15.750 --> 02:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
a little bit
 
02:46:17.830 --> 02:46:17.840 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to use in and
 
02:46:17.840 --> 02:46:18.870 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to use in and
uh

02:46:18.870 --> 02:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:46:21.030 --> 02:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
and thank you for the question um what i
 
02:46:23.510 --> 02:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
was meaning is that so for example and
 
02:46:25.590 --> 02:46:25.600 align:start position:0%
i'm talking about the bill as written it
 
02:46:25.600 --> 02:46:26.710 align:start position:0%
i'm talking about the bill as written it
would

02:46:26.710 --> 02:46:26.720 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:46:26.720 --> 02:46:28.469 align:start position:0%
would
uh

02:46:28.469 --> 02:46:28.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:46:31.429 --> 02:46:31.439 align:start position:0%
would not allow referrals to counseling
 
02:46:34.469 --> 02:46:34.479 align:start position:0%
that has no cpt medical code
 
02:46:35.910 --> 02:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
and what what
 
02:46:37.990 --> 02:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
is concerning is that the i don't know
 
02:46:40.230 --> 02:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
that the committee really has a sense of
 
02:46:41.590 --> 02:46:41.600 align:start position:0%
what is
 
02:46:45.269 --> 02:46:45.279 align:start position:0%
or is not a cpt medical code and that
 
02:46:47.670 --> 02:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
the court if this bill were to pass is
 
02:46:47.680 --> 02:46:48.790 align:start position:0%
the court if this bill were to pass is
written

02:46:48.790 --> 02:46:48.800 align:start position:0%
written
 
02:46:51.110 --> 02:46:51.120 align:start position:0%
may find that some and
 
02:46:54.469 --> 02:46:54.479 align:start position:0%
one that is universally acknowledged is
 
02:46:56.309 --> 02:46:56.319 align:start position:0%
a inappropriate
 
02:46:58.389 --> 02:46:58.399 align:start position:0%
uh counseling service under a particular
 
02:47:01.349 --> 02:47:01.359 align:start position:0%
circumstance does not have a cpt code
 
02:47:03.349 --> 02:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
that would be prohibited
 
02:47:05.510 --> 02:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
um and i think we also heard you know
 
02:47:07.830 --> 02:47:07.840 align:start position:0%
the cpt codes may not even be the
 
02:47:10.070 --> 02:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate one when we're talking about
 
02:47:11.990 --> 02:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
certain mental health counseling it may
 
02:47:14.469 --> 02:47:14.479 align:start position:0%
be a different coding
 
02:47:17.110 --> 02:47:17.120 align:start position:0%
um so that you know if this were to pass
 
02:47:19.349 --> 02:47:19.359 align:start position:0%
you may unintentionally
 
02:47:23.110 --> 02:47:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:24.950 --> 02:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
counseling or therapy
 
02:47:27.190 --> 02:47:27.200 align:start position:0%
that is not in dispute the way some of
 
02:47:28.950 --> 02:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
the others are that were referenced in
 
02:47:30.230 --> 02:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
in today's
 
02:47:30.240 --> 02:47:39.269 align:start position:0%
in today's
testimony

02:47:39.269 --> 02:47:39.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:41.510 --> 02:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
thank you uh mr head is it your
 
02:47:44.230 --> 02:47:44.240 align:start position:0%
experience in working with the courts
 
02:47:46.469 --> 02:47:46.479 align:start position:0%
that um
 
02:47:49.269 --> 02:47:49.279 align:start position:0%
they're that a code of
 
02:47:51.910 --> 02:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
individual counseling
 
02:47:54.630 --> 02:47:54.640 align:start position:0%
can be used
 
02:47:56.469 --> 02:47:56.479 align:start position:0%
to throw an umbrella over a lot of
 
02:47:56.479 --> 02:48:00.550 align:start position:0%
to throw an umbrella over a lot of
things

02:48:00.550 --> 02:48:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:01.670 --> 02:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
i think
 
02:48:04.790 --> 02:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
so if i understand your question
 
02:48:06.150 --> 02:48:06.160 align:start position:0%
actually i may not understand your
 
02:48:10.870 --> 02:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
question i apologize um i can rephrase
 
02:48:13.429 --> 02:48:13.439 align:start position:0%
there is there is a code that's called
 
02:48:15.349 --> 02:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
individual counseling
 
02:48:19.269 --> 02:48:19.279 align:start position:0%
i see in your experience with the courts
 
02:48:22.550 --> 02:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
have you seen or would this bill allow
 
02:48:24.550 --> 02:48:24.560 align:start position:0%
for that umbrella
 
02:48:26.630 --> 02:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
to just shield all of these things that
 
02:48:29.750 --> 02:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
we've been talking about today
 
02:48:31.429 --> 02:48:31.439 align:start position:0%
you know i don't know the answer to that
 
02:48:33.110 --> 02:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
i think there was earlier testimony that
 
02:48:35.910 --> 02:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
it does happen uh and certainly i can
 
02:48:38.230 --> 02:48:38.240 align:start position:0%
see it happening but i i do not know
 
02:48:40.230 --> 02:48:40.240 align:start position:0%
specifically so i would i don't have
 
02:48:41.670 --> 02:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
personal knowledge that would be able to
 
02:48:43.110 --> 02:48:43.120 align:start position:0%
answer that question
 
02:48:52.309 --> 02:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:53.910 --> 02:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any further
 
02:49:00.469 --> 02:49:00.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:02.710 --> 02:49:02.720 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thank you for taking my
 
02:49:04.710 --> 02:49:04.720 align:start position:0%
question i wanted to kind of follow up
 
02:49:06.870 --> 02:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
on uh representative altschuler's
 
02:49:06.880 --> 02:49:08.550 align:start position:0%
on uh representative altschuler's
question

02:49:08.550 --> 02:49:08.560 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:49:11.590 --> 02:49:11.600 align:start position:0%
in in kind of going at a different um
 
02:49:11.600 --> 02:49:13.110 align:start position:0%
in in kind of going at a different um
angle

02:49:13.110 --> 02:49:13.120 align:start position:0%
angle
 
02:49:13.120 --> 02:49:13.910 align:start position:0%
angle
d

02:49:13.910 --> 02:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
d
 
02:49:16.389 --> 02:49:16.399 align:start position:0%
are you aware of any
 
02:49:16.399 --> 02:49:17.190 align:start position:0%
are you aware of any
uh

02:49:17.190 --> 02:49:17.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:49:17.200 --> 02:49:18.309 align:start position:0%
uh
or

02:49:18.309 --> 02:49:18.319 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:49:18.319 --> 02:49:19.269 align:start position:0%
or
what

02:49:19.269 --> 02:49:19.279 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:49:23.750 --> 02:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
counselings might be requested by the
 
02:49:25.750 --> 02:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
courts that
 
02:49:27.190 --> 02:49:27.200 align:start position:0%
are not
 
02:49:27.200 --> 02:49:28.389 align:start position:0%
are not
uh

02:49:28.389 --> 02:49:28.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:49:32.790 --> 02:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:35.830 --> 02:49:35.840 align:start position:0%
i don't i decide again on personal
 
02:49:38.630 --> 02:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
knowledge i don't have sort of a list
 
02:49:40.790 --> 02:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
certainly there are
 
02:49:43.670 --> 02:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
times when when insurance will not
 
02:49:45.750 --> 02:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
covered or or other parties simply don't
 
02:49:47.510 --> 02:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
have insurance which is also not that
 
02:49:47.520 --> 02:49:48.630 align:start position:0%
have insurance which is also not that
uncommon

02:49:48.630 --> 02:49:48.640 align:start position:0%
uncommon
 
02:49:51.349 --> 02:49:51.359 align:start position:0%
um where you where you have uninsured
 
02:49:54.790 --> 02:49:54.800 align:start position:0%
parties before before the court
 
02:49:56.950 --> 02:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
so you know whether or not insurance is
 
02:49:59.830 --> 02:49:59.840 align:start position:0%
paying for a particular
 
02:50:02.070 --> 02:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
service as was noted earlier is a
 
02:50:02.080 --> 02:50:03.990 align:start position:0%
service as was noted earlier is a
consideration

02:50:03.990 --> 02:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
02:50:07.990 --> 02:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
but i don't have data on that
 
02:50:10.389 --> 02:50:10.399 align:start position:0%
but that that is a that is as was noted
 
02:50:12.150 --> 02:50:12.160 align:start position:0%
earlier one of the considerations for
 
02:50:14.870 --> 02:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
the court to take into account when
 
02:50:18.710 --> 02:50:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:21.030 --> 02:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
so i think it's it's less of an issue of
 
02:50:23.670 --> 02:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
whether or not it has a code for
 
02:50:25.429 --> 02:50:25.439 align:start position:0%
insurance billing as opposed to whether
 
02:50:27.990 --> 02:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
or not the party actually has insurance
 
02:50:29.750 --> 02:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
and or whether or not
 
02:50:35.990 --> 02:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:41.190 --> 02:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:44.230 --> 02:50:44.240 align:start position:0%
thank you we have uh one more person to
 
02:50:44.240 --> 02:50:49.510 align:start position:0%
thank you we have uh one more person to
speak

02:50:49.510 --> 02:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:53.670 --> 02:50:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:57.190 --> 02:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:59.510 --> 02:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
great eric angarelli i'm the director
 
02:51:01.269 --> 02:51:01.279 align:start position:0%
for the bureau for children's behavioral
 
02:51:02.710 --> 02:51:02.720 align:start position:0%
health at the department of health and
 
02:51:05.510 --> 02:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
human services um just a couple of
 
02:51:07.670 --> 02:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
comments and i'm available for questions
 
02:51:10.870 --> 02:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
if you have any to help clarify anything
 
02:51:12.710 --> 02:51:12.720 align:start position:0%
most of the
 
02:51:14.469 --> 02:51:14.479 align:start position:0%
commentary that i would have made has
 
02:51:16.630 --> 02:51:16.640 align:start position:0%
already been discussed here today in
 
02:51:19.190 --> 02:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
that the cpt codes are
 
02:51:23.750 --> 02:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
sort of groupings of procedures um
 
02:51:23.760 --> 02:51:24.550 align:start position:0%
sort of groupings of procedures um
that

02:51:24.550 --> 02:51:24.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:51:26.150 --> 02:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
lots of different things could fall
 
02:51:28.469 --> 02:51:28.479 align:start position:0%
under uh to representative all
 
02:51:31.190 --> 02:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
schiller's question yes a lot of things
 
02:51:34.070 --> 02:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
could be grouped under individual
 
02:51:36.790 --> 02:51:36.800 align:start position:0%
family or group counseling without an
 
02:51:39.349 --> 02:51:39.359 align:start position:0%
identifier that gets to the actual model
 
02:51:41.429 --> 02:51:41.439 align:start position:0%
that's being used and this is what i
 
02:51:44.230 --> 02:51:44.240 align:start position:0%
think this is uh being discussed here
 
02:51:46.790 --> 02:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
today is an actual model of therapy that
 
02:51:49.110 --> 02:51:49.120 align:start position:0%
is in use so under the right
 
02:51:52.150 --> 02:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
circumstances by the right provider this
 
02:51:54.950 --> 02:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
could be billed to any one of those
 
02:51:57.510 --> 02:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
individual group or family
 
02:52:00.790 --> 02:52:00.800 align:start position:0%
therapies using those cpt codes so cpt
 
02:52:02.630 --> 02:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
codes may not be
 
02:52:05.030 --> 02:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
the way in which uh this becomes
 
02:52:08.150 --> 02:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
addressed i also just want to clarify
 
02:52:11.429 --> 02:52:11.439 align:start position:0%
um i don't represent dcyf but i've been
 
02:52:13.030 --> 02:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
having a little bit of back and forth
 
02:52:15.269 --> 02:52:15.279 align:start position:0%
listening to the testimony here today i
 
02:52:16.950 --> 02:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
just want to clarify
 
02:52:19.910 --> 02:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
the reunification work that is done with
 
02:52:22.070 --> 02:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
regard to the child welfare system in
 
02:52:24.469 --> 02:52:24.479 align:start position:0%
dcyf is different than what is being
 
02:52:26.309 --> 02:52:26.319 align:start position:0%
discussed here today
 
02:52:30.070 --> 02:52:30.080 align:start position:0%
again this is a model of therapy and the
 
02:52:33.190 --> 02:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
work that dcyf does under their
 
02:52:36.070 --> 02:52:36.080 align:start position:0%
reunification mandate is different and
 
02:52:38.630 --> 02:52:38.640 align:start position:0%
does not necessarily employ something
 
02:52:40.469 --> 02:52:40.479 align:start position:0%
like this
 
02:52:42.070 --> 02:52:42.080 align:start position:0%
and i'm available for questions if
 
02:52:43.429 --> 02:52:43.439 align:start position:0%
anybody has any
 
02:52:46.790 --> 02:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
thank you ms angrily did you um submit
 
02:52:49.269 --> 02:52:49.279 align:start position:0%
written test testimony
 
02:52:51.750 --> 02:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
i did not submit anywhere if you could
 
02:52:53.750 --> 02:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
please uh send that
 
02:52:58.870 --> 02:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:04.550 --> 02:53:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:08.469 --> 02:53:08.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:11.269 --> 02:53:11.279 align:start position:0%
and also seeing no further
 
02:53:14.309 --> 02:53:14.319 align:start position:0%
hands up to testify
 
02:53:19.510 --> 02:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:20.950 --> 02:53:20.960 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
02:53:27.110 --> 02:53:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:30.389 --> 02:53:30.399 align:start position:0%
we'll be closing the hearing on
 
02:53:33.190 --> 02:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
uh house bill 556.
 
02:53:37.190 --> 02:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
we have 15 people on my sheet
 
02:53:41.590 --> 02:53:41.600 align:start position:0%
that are supporting one opposing
 
02:53:44.230 --> 02:53:44.240 align:start position:0%
i think that opposition is
 
02:53:46.630 --> 02:53:46.640 align:start position:0%
probably going to go higher
 
02:53:48.230 --> 02:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
and we had
 
02:53:53.349 --> 02:53:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:55.030 --> 02:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
so with that
 
02:53:57.750 --> 02:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
we will close the hearing
 
02:54:01.750 --> 02:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
and uh we will break for lunch
 
02:54:03.910 --> 02:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
i'd ask you to be back a few minutes

before one o'clock
 
02:54:07.590 --> 02:54:07.600 align:start position:0%
so that we can begin the hearing on
 
02:54:11.750 --> 02:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:24.150 --> 02:54:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:27.110 --> 02:54:27.120 align:start position:0%

02:55:56.630 --> 02:55:56.640 align:start position:0%

[Music]

02:56:14.070 --> 02:56:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:30.309 --> 02:56:30.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:30.319 --> 03:55:58.550 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:55:58.550 --> 03:55:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:58.560 --> 03:56:34.469 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:56:34.469 --> 03:56:34.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:40.309 --> 03:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:43.510 --> 03:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
oh i can't hear oh god

03:56:49.830 --> 03:56:49.840 align:start position:0%
looks like the room is still muted
 
03:56:51.910 --> 03:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
so the room will have to be unmuted if
 
03:56:53.750 --> 03:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
you just go to the computer and hit the
 
03:56:56.550 --> 03:56:56.560 align:start position:0%
other cody's doing that perfect
 
03:56:58.870 --> 03:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
03:57:02.550 --> 03:57:02.560 align:start position:0%
i had a technical question not a um
 
03:57:05.110 --> 03:57:05.120 align:start position:0%
question referencing any of the
 
03:57:09.429 --> 03:57:09.439 align:start position:0%
bills is it okay to ask it
 
03:57:09.439 --> 03:57:10.469 align:start position:0%

03:57:19.429 --> 03:57:19.439 align:start position:0%
so someone asked me earlier if i had the
 
03:57:21.510 --> 03:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
blue sheets i don't have the blue sheets
 
03:57:24.790 --> 03:57:24.800 align:start position:0%

so that they have the information
 
03:57:41.030 --> 03:57:41.040 align:start position:0%

03:57:43.750 --> 03:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
tad amount to the blue sheet is the
 
03:57:45.910 --> 03:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
information that i read
 
03:57:45.920 --> 03:57:47.110 align:start position:0%
information that i read
um

03:57:47.110 --> 03:57:47.120 align:start position:0%

i'm not able to do that
 
03:58:02.389 --> 03:58:02.399 align:start position:0%
that that was one thing and the second
 
03:58:05.110 --> 03:58:05.120 align:start position:0%
thing is um
 
03:58:08.070 --> 03:58:08.080 align:start position:0%
what was the second thing uh
 
03:58:10.550 --> 03:58:10.560 align:start position:0%
in the past
 
03:58:12.710 --> 03:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
um the assistant
 
03:58:14.790 --> 03:58:14.800 align:start position:0%
used to get all of the
 
03:58:17.670 --> 03:58:17.680 align:start position:0%
testimonies and all the information
 
03:58:19.910 --> 03:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
and send them out or print them and give
 
03:58:21.510 --> 03:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
them to us
 
03:58:23.750 --> 03:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
so to have people send them to me and
 
03:58:25.990 --> 03:58:26.000 align:start position:0%
make it my responsibility i'm not
 
03:58:27.750 --> 03:58:27.760 align:start position:0%
getting paid to do that
 
03:58:30.389 --> 03:58:30.399 align:start position:0%
so unless it's changed
 
03:58:33.030 --> 03:58:33.040 align:start position:0%
and i wasn't aware if it's changed and
 
03:58:35.030 --> 03:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
that's what i'm supposed to do
 
03:58:37.670 --> 03:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
i will do that you can just forward
 
03:58:40.070 --> 03:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
forward the email to children and family
 
03:58:40.080 --> 03:58:41.590 align:start position:0%
forward the email to children and family
law

03:58:41.590 --> 03:58:41.600 align:start position:0%
law
 
03:58:43.670 --> 03:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
that's the way it used to be forward
 
03:58:45.590 --> 03:58:45.600 align:start position:0%
everything to children and family law
 
03:58:47.910 --> 03:58:47.920 align:start position:0%

03:58:51.910 --> 03:58:51.920 align:start position:0%

03:59:08.070 --> 03:59:08.080 align:start position:0%
understand their names
 
03:59:10.550 --> 03:59:10.560 align:start position:0%

where they're from
 
03:59:15.269 --> 03:59:15.279 align:start position:0%

issue in any proceeding under this

issue in any proceeding under this
chapter

04:07:16.870 --> 04:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
chapter
 
04:07:18.950 --> 04:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
either between the parties or between
 
04:07:22.070 --> 04:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
one or both parties and a child or
 
04:07:24.550 --> 04:07:24.560 align:start position:0%

to the complex case docket or high
 
04:07:29.670 --> 04:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
conflict docket the case
 
04:07:31.030 --> 04:07:31.040 align:start position:0%
is criminal
 
04:07:32.870 --> 04:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
and shall be assigned to the circuit
 
04:07:35.269 --> 04:07:35.279 align:start position:0%
court district division or superior
 
04:07:37.590 --> 04:07:37.600 align:start position:0%
court and of course that needs to be
 
04:07:39.510 --> 04:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
modified because i'm not an attorney and
 
04:07:41.030 --> 04:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
after getting told by an attorney it
 
04:07:42.790 --> 04:07:42.800 align:start position:0%
needs to be changed
 
04:07:45.110 --> 04:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
the wording needs to be changed so that
 
04:07:47.590 --> 04:07:47.600 align:start position:0%
the case shall be assigned to the
 
04:07:49.269 --> 04:07:49.279 align:start position:0%
circuit court district division our
 
04:07:51.750 --> 04:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
superior court and be eligible for a
 
04:07:53.189 --> 04:07:53.199 align:start position:0%
trial by jury
 
04:07:55.830 --> 04:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
we have a strange situation in new
 
04:07:58.469 --> 04:07:58.479 align:start position:0%
hampshire it feels strange to me
 
04:08:01.189 --> 04:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
if you commit a crime against someone
 
04:08:03.510 --> 04:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
who is not in your family
 
04:08:06.550 --> 04:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
it's handled in superior court
 
04:08:08.790 --> 04:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
with an with a jury
 
04:08:11.590 --> 04:08:11.600 align:start position:0%
if you commit that same crime on a
 
04:08:13.510 --> 04:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
family member
 
04:08:15.830 --> 04:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
it goes to family court
 
04:08:18.790 --> 04:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
the rules there are different and a lot
 
04:08:22.389 --> 04:08:22.399 align:start position:0%
of times the results and the findings
 
04:08:23.750 --> 04:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
are different
 
04:08:24.870 --> 04:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
and usually
 
04:08:26.870 --> 04:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
not so punitive
 
04:08:29.830 --> 04:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
and not so protective of the victims
 
04:08:29.840 --> 04:08:30.790 align:start position:0%
and not so protective of the victims
so

04:08:30.790 --> 04:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:08:33.030 --> 04:08:33.040 align:start position:0%
i realize this is a big
 
04:08:34.790 --> 04:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
a big ask
 
04:08:36.790 --> 04:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
and i'm also cons
 
04:08:39.670 --> 04:08:39.680 align:start position:0%
expecting that two people who keep
 
04:08:41.830 --> 04:08:41.840 align:start position:0%
refusing to acknowledge
 
04:08:43.830 --> 04:08:43.840 align:start position:0%
our bills are any good
 
04:08:46.070 --> 04:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
because they're defending the way things
 
04:08:48.950 --> 04:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
are i understand that but the way things
 
04:08:51.830 --> 04:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
are need to be changed and so this may
 
04:08:54.550 --> 04:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
take multiple steps to make it happen
 
04:08:57.750 --> 04:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
but i need your support that victims of
 
04:09:01.670 --> 04:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
abuse domestic abuse need to be treated
 
04:09:05.110 --> 04:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
in a same way that victims who are not
 
04:09:06.870 --> 04:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
in that same family
 
04:09:12.830 --> 04:09:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:16.389 --> 04:09:16.399 align:start position:0%
i'm may have to uh guide me in saying
 
04:09:18.870 --> 04:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
this but some of the people who speak
 
04:09:18.880 --> 04:09:19.830 align:start position:0%
this but some of the people who speak
against

04:09:19.830 --> 04:09:19.840 align:start position:0%
against
 
04:09:22.469 --> 04:09:22.479 align:start position:0%
against my bills and of course i don't
 
04:09:25.110 --> 04:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
have a chance to rebut them but of
 
04:09:25.120 --> 04:09:26.229 align:start position:0%
have a chance to rebut them but of
course

04:09:26.229 --> 04:09:26.239 align:start position:0%
course
 
04:09:27.590 --> 04:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
of course they're going to defend the
 
04:09:29.189 --> 04:09:29.199 align:start position:0%
way things are
 
04:09:31.349 --> 04:09:31.359 align:start position:0%
and uh it's really a shocker when you
 
04:09:32.870 --> 04:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
find out the people who are supposed to
 
04:09:35.750 --> 04:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
be helping victims of domestic abuse
 
04:09:38.469 --> 04:09:38.479 align:start position:0%
don't offer any way to strengthen the
 
04:09:41.830 --> 04:09:41.840 align:start position:0%
laws i've asked them
 
04:09:44.710 --> 04:09:44.720 align:start position:0%
face to face for suggestions on laws
 
04:09:47.349 --> 04:09:47.359 align:start position:0%
that would strengthen their victims
 
04:09:50.070 --> 04:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh in court and i was told that they
 
04:09:52.710 --> 04:09:52.720 align:start position:0%
were too busy just reviewing bills
 
04:09:55.429 --> 04:09:55.439 align:start position:0%
so with that in mind please ask me any
 
04:09:57.670 --> 04:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
questions or give me
 
04:09:59.670 --> 04:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
give me questions that have information
 
04:10:01.030 --> 04:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
in them to help me
 
04:10:02.870 --> 04:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:10:04.790 --> 04:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representative gage do we have
 
04:10:10.710 --> 04:10:10.720 align:start position:0%

representative

04:10:14.550 --> 04:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:10:16.790 --> 04:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh one of the things that i kind of
 
04:10:18.950 --> 04:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
jumped out at me is it looked to me as
 
04:10:20.550 --> 04:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
if this would could possibly be
 
04:10:22.309 --> 04:10:22.319 align:start position:0%
weaponized by putting people into
 
04:10:23.510 --> 04:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
criminal court
 
04:10:26.309 --> 04:10:26.319 align:start position:0%
i could you perhaps clarify
 
04:10:26.319 --> 04:10:27.910 align:start position:0%
i could you perhaps clarify
um

04:10:27.910 --> 04:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:30.790 --> 04:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
saying the case is criminal because
 
04:10:33.030 --> 04:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
or is it always criminal and if it is
 
04:10:34.950 --> 04:10:34.960 align:start position:0%
criminal then why is it not tried
 
04:10:36.830 --> 04:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
separately as a criminal
 
04:10:39.189 --> 04:10:39.199 align:start position:0%
case i don't know
 
04:10:39.199 --> 04:10:40.070 align:start position:0%
case i don't know
why

04:10:40.070 --> 04:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
why
 
04:10:42.150 --> 04:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
it's not tried separately
 
04:10:45.189 --> 04:10:45.199 align:start position:0%
and of course nobody goes to court until
 
04:10:47.030 --> 04:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
they've had a um
 
04:10:49.429 --> 04:10:49.439 align:start position:0%
let's see what is it called
 
04:10:49.439 --> 04:10:50.070 align:start position:0%
let's see what is it called
a

04:10:50.070 --> 04:10:50.080 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:10:52.309 --> 04:10:52.319 align:start position:0%
true bill true bill or no bill is that
 
04:10:55.349 --> 04:10:55.359 align:start position:0%
term used here in new hampshire
 
04:10:56.950 --> 04:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
it was in texas
 
04:10:58.790 --> 04:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
you went before grand theory and they
 
04:11:01.990 --> 04:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
decided whether you should uh even go
 
04:11:04.950 --> 04:11:04.960 align:start position:0%
and be charged so i would assume that if
 
04:11:07.910 --> 04:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
somebody is charging somebody or fi
 
04:11:10.070 --> 04:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
against people they would go through the
 
04:11:12.070 --> 04:11:12.080 align:start position:0%
whole process they wouldn't just be put
 
04:11:14.950 --> 04:11:14.960 align:start position:0%
on trial they'd have to the grand jury
 
04:11:16.790 --> 04:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
would have to assess whether they
 
04:11:18.870 --> 04:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
thought there was enough evidence there
 
04:11:20.630 --> 04:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
to make it worthwhile
 
04:11:23.590 --> 04:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
but what's horrible is that in the cases
 
04:11:23.600 --> 04:11:24.389 align:start position:0%
but what's horrible is that in the cases
of

04:11:24.389 --> 04:11:24.399 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:11:27.030 --> 04:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
domestic child rape
 
04:11:29.189 --> 04:11:29.199 align:start position:0%
you can't make it much worse than that
 
04:11:29.199 --> 04:11:30.550 align:start position:0%
you can't make it much worse than that
besides

04:11:30.550 --> 04:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
besides
 
04:11:32.309 --> 04:11:32.319 align:start position:0%
trying to blow your children up which
 
04:11:35.030 --> 04:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
has happened in new hampshire um
 
04:11:38.389 --> 04:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
those cases are are heard in family
 
04:11:38.399 --> 04:11:39.910 align:start position:0%
those cases are are heard in family
court

04:11:39.910 --> 04:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
court
 
04:11:42.630 --> 04:11:42.640 align:start position:0%
that's not the right place for them
 
04:11:45.030 --> 04:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
and so this is my attempt to start the
 
04:11:48.790 --> 04:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
ball rolling that we get uh the victims
 
04:11:51.269 --> 04:11:51.279 align:start position:0%
of horrendous crimes
 
04:11:54.469 --> 04:11:54.479 align:start position:0%
to uh have the same rights as a person
 
04:11:55.990 --> 04:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
in superior court
 
04:11:58.630 --> 04:11:58.640 align:start position:0%
after going through the correct steps
 
04:12:02.870 --> 04:12:02.880 align:start position:0%

04:12:45.269 --> 04:12:45.279 align:start position:0%
don't disagree um that perhaps this
 
04:12:46.870 --> 04:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
should be a separate issue and maybe we
 
04:12:49.189 --> 04:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
could amend that to happen
 
04:12:49.199 --> 04:12:50.630 align:start position:0%
could amend that to happen
um

04:12:50.630 --> 04:12:50.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:50.640 --> 04:12:51.910 align:start position:0%
um
but

04:12:51.910 --> 04:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:12:53.750 --> 04:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
correct me if i'm wrong but this bill
 
04:12:58.070 --> 04:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
states that if domestic violence which
 
04:12:59.590 --> 04:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
suffice to say
 
04:13:02.229 --> 04:13:02.239 align:start position:0%
off can often tend to happen
 
04:13:04.950 --> 04:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
um with these families
 
04:13:07.590 --> 04:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
that are impacted
 
04:13:09.349 --> 04:13:09.359 align:start position:0%
this would take
 
04:13:12.469 --> 04:13:12.479 align:start position:0%
the case completely away from family
 
04:13:14.950 --> 04:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
court am i wrong to assume that
 
04:13:18.550 --> 04:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:21.670 --> 04:13:21.680 align:start position:0%
not all family court cases have horrible
 
04:13:23.750 --> 04:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
things like that so it wouldn't get rid
 
04:13:25.990 --> 04:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
of the need for family court it would
 
04:13:27.670 --> 04:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
just take out
 
04:13:29.670 --> 04:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
violent criminal acts
 
04:13:32.710 --> 04:13:32.720 align:start position:0%
and put them where they should be
 
04:13:34.950 --> 04:13:34.960 align:start position:0%
follow up representative belanger thank
 
04:13:35.830 --> 04:13:35.840 align:start position:0%

04:13:43.750 --> 04:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
do you have you spoken with the
 
04:13:43.760 --> 04:13:44.870 align:start position:0%
do you have you spoken with the
department

04:13:44.870 --> 04:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
department
 
04:13:46.630 --> 04:13:46.640 align:start position:0%
of um
 
04:13:48.469 --> 04:13:48.479 align:start position:0%
youth and family services
 
04:13:48.479 --> 04:13:49.429 align:start position:0%
youth and family services
to

04:13:49.429 --> 04:13:49.439 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:13:51.510 --> 04:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
get data on how many families are
 
04:13:56.309 --> 04:13:56.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:58.469 --> 04:13:58.479 align:start position:0%
no and
 
04:14:00.229 --> 04:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
you know they
 
04:14:02.389 --> 04:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
let's see how to say this
 
04:14:05.830 --> 04:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
it seems like in our in our court system
 
04:14:10.550 --> 04:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
we have systems that handle dcyf cases
 
04:14:13.590 --> 04:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
and a lot of different things happen
 
04:14:13.600 --> 04:14:14.630 align:start position:0%
and a lot of different things happen
in

04:14:14.630 --> 04:14:14.640 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:14:18.630 --> 04:14:18.640 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure how to call it private
 
04:14:20.550 --> 04:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
divorce proceedings
 
04:14:23.510 --> 04:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
that you know are not involved with uh
 
04:14:27.510 --> 04:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
dcyf at all just like the cases the the
 
04:14:29.830 --> 04:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
bills that we talked about before
 
04:14:31.189 --> 04:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
going through
 
04:14:31.199 --> 04:14:32.389 align:start position:0%
going through
uh

04:14:32.389 --> 04:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:14:33.830 --> 04:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
the counseling that's not real
 
04:14:33.840 --> 04:14:36.070 align:start position:0%
the counseling that's not real
counseling

04:14:36.070 --> 04:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
counseling
 
04:14:36.080 --> 04:14:37.429 align:start position:0%
counseling
that

04:14:37.429 --> 04:14:37.439 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:14:39.750 --> 04:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
that's just totally not something that
 
04:14:44.950 --> 04:14:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:48.389 --> 04:14:48.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:50.469 --> 04:14:50.479 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions for
 
04:14:55.510 --> 04:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:58.309 --> 04:14:58.319 align:start position:0%

um
 
04:15:25.750 --> 04:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
i would like to address representative
 
04:15:28.070 --> 04:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
gay's comments about defending the way
 
04:15:29.750 --> 04:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
that things are
 
04:15:29.760 --> 04:15:30.710 align:start position:0%
that things are
um

04:15:30.710 --> 04:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:33.590 --> 04:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
i am here today to testify
 
04:15:36.070 --> 04:15:36.080 align:start position:0%
um against these bills
 
04:15:39.110 --> 04:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
because they don't correct the problems
 
04:15:41.429 --> 04:15:41.439 align:start position:0%
on behalf of domestic violence victims
 
04:15:43.349 --> 04:15:43.359 align:start position:0%
they don't make things safer or better
 
04:15:45.990 --> 04:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
for victims i'm certainly willing to
 
04:15:48.149 --> 04:15:48.159 align:start position:0%
listen to potential amendments and
 
04:15:53.110 --> 04:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
solutions but these bills do not do that
 
04:15:53.120 --> 04:15:54.149 align:start position:0%
solutions but these bills do not do that
um

04:15:54.149 --> 04:15:54.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:56.870 --> 04:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
then i would like to say that uh there
 
04:15:58.870 --> 04:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
was a similar bill which was proposed by
 
04:16:01.510 --> 04:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
representative gay last session that was
 
04:16:04.389 --> 04:16:04.399 align:start position:0%
house bill 1626
 
04:16:06.790 --> 04:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
and this committee voted unanimously to
 
04:16:10.229 --> 04:16:10.239 align:start position:0%
itl that bill 19-0
 
04:16:12.389 --> 04:16:12.399 align:start position:0%
so there are really two things uh with
 
04:16:14.950 --> 04:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
this particular bill and i'll address
 
04:16:17.189 --> 04:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
them each separately the first one is i
 
04:16:19.269 --> 04:16:19.279 align:start position:0%
think there is some confusion around the
 
04:16:21.510 --> 04:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
complex case docket
 
04:16:24.229 --> 04:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
uh when this bill was first drafted that
 
04:16:26.149 --> 04:16:26.159 align:start position:0%
docket looked very different in our
 
04:16:26.159 --> 04:16:27.349 align:start position:0%
docket looked very different in our
state

04:16:27.349 --> 04:16:27.359 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:16:30.710 --> 04:16:30.720 align:start position:0%
it was really one statewide
 
04:16:33.189 --> 04:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
case docket that has now been
 
04:16:33.199 --> 04:16:34.710 align:start position:0%
case docket that has now been
regionalized

04:16:34.710 --> 04:16:34.720 align:start position:0%
regionalized
 
04:16:37.590 --> 04:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
and it is up to each region to determine
 
04:16:39.750 --> 04:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
how those cases are handled
 
04:16:41.349 --> 04:16:41.359 align:start position:0%
but i believe there may be i think
 
04:16:44.229 --> 04:16:44.239 align:start position:0%
richard had the court representative
 
04:16:46.229 --> 04:16:46.239 align:start position:0%
hopefully he's still
 
04:16:48.630 --> 04:16:48.640 align:start position:0%
on the zoom so i will let him speak
 
04:16:51.110 --> 04:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
further to that point
 
04:16:53.269 --> 04:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
next i would like to address the issue
 
04:16:54.790 --> 04:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
of making this
 
04:16:56.710 --> 04:16:56.720 align:start position:0%
these cases where there's a finding of
 
04:16:56.720 --> 04:16:57.750 align:start position:0%
these cases where there's a finding of
abuse

04:16:57.750 --> 04:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
abuse
 
04:16:59.269 --> 04:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
criminal and sending them over to
 
04:17:02.469 --> 04:17:02.479 align:start position:0%
district division or to superior court
 
04:17:05.189 --> 04:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
so if there is a finding of abuse made
 
04:17:07.910 --> 04:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
in a parenting case that does not
 
04:17:10.870 --> 04:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily make the case criminal
 
04:17:12.870 --> 04:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
some of you may know that domestic abuse
 
04:17:15.510 --> 04:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
can take many different forms it can be
 
04:17:17.670 --> 04:17:17.680 align:start position:0%
emotional abuse it can be
 
04:17:20.149 --> 04:17:20.159 align:start position:0%
psychological abuse it can be financial
 
04:17:20.159 --> 04:17:21.990 align:start position:0%
psychological abuse it can be financial
abuse

04:17:21.990 --> 04:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
abuse
 
04:17:22.000 --> 04:17:23.349 align:start position:0%
abuse
physical

04:17:23.349 --> 04:17:23.359 align:start position:0%
physical
 
04:17:26.149 --> 04:17:26.159 align:start position:0%
assault physical abuse is not i think
 
04:17:27.910 --> 04:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
that's what many people think of when
 
04:17:29.830 --> 04:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
they think of domestic violence that
 
04:17:32.149 --> 04:17:32.159 align:start position:0%
there has to be bruises um there has to
 
04:17:34.229 --> 04:17:34.239 align:start position:0%
be broken bones that is not the case
 
04:17:36.630 --> 04:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
abuse can take on many many different
 
04:17:39.429 --> 04:17:39.439 align:start position:0%
forms which unfortunately not all
 
04:17:43.189 --> 04:17:43.199 align:start position:0%
situations rises to a criminal level
 
04:17:45.670 --> 04:17:45.680 align:start position:0%
our law regarding domestic violence does
 
04:17:48.070 --> 04:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
not encompass all of those things that i
 
04:17:51.189 --> 04:17:51.199 align:start position:0%
just described to you so somebody may be
 
04:17:53.670 --> 04:17:53.680 align:start position:0%
belittling their partner maybe
 
04:17:55.510 --> 04:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
putting them down and making them feel
 
04:17:55.520 --> 04:17:57.349 align:start position:0%
putting them down and making them feel
worthless

04:17:57.349 --> 04:17:57.359 align:start position:0%
worthless
 
04:18:00.389 --> 04:18:00.399 align:start position:0%
that is abuse but it may not rise to the
 
04:18:03.030 --> 04:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
level of a criminal act under our law
 
04:18:05.110 --> 04:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
and so we don't want these family court
 
04:18:08.149 --> 04:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
cases which are not criminal
 
04:18:10.469 --> 04:18:10.479 align:start position:0%
to be transferred over to a superior
 
04:18:13.269 --> 04:18:13.279 align:start position:0%
court where judges aren't trained on
 
04:18:15.750 --> 04:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
family dynamics or divorce and parenting
 
04:18:15.760 --> 04:18:17.429 align:start position:0%
family dynamics or divorce and parenting
law

04:18:17.429 --> 04:18:17.439 align:start position:0%
law
 
04:18:20.149 --> 04:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
so in terms of cases being referred to
 
04:18:25.750 --> 04:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:28.469 --> 04:18:28.479 align:start position:0%
and that i think the issue is that um
 
04:18:30.070 --> 04:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
and i've heard this in other bills is
 
04:18:32.389 --> 04:18:32.399 align:start position:0%
that there may be a concern about some
 
04:18:34.630 --> 04:18:34.640 align:start position:0%
of the judges that are hearing these
 
04:18:37.510 --> 04:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
cases so let's get them out of family
 
04:18:39.189 --> 04:18:39.199 align:start position:0%
court let's get them away from those
 
04:18:39.199 --> 04:18:40.550 align:start position:0%
court let's get them away from those
judges

04:18:40.550 --> 04:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
judges
 
04:18:43.510 --> 04:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
to a different division or to a
 
04:18:44.870 --> 04:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
different court
 
04:18:47.269 --> 04:18:47.279 align:start position:0%
well in terms of district division that
 
04:18:49.030 --> 04:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't correct the problem if in fact
 
04:18:50.550 --> 04:18:50.560 align:start position:0%
that was a problem
 
04:18:53.349 --> 04:18:53.359 align:start position:0%
because the district so district
 
04:18:56.070 --> 04:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
division and family division are all
 
04:18:58.550 --> 04:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
part of circuit court so
 
04:19:00.309 --> 04:19:00.319 align:start position:0%
there's the circuit court and then under
 
04:19:02.149 --> 04:19:02.159 align:start position:0%
that is family division and district
 
04:19:05.590 --> 04:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
division so the district court judges
 
04:19:07.670 --> 04:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
are the same judges that are also
 
04:19:09.830 --> 04:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
hearing family court cases
 
04:19:12.229 --> 04:19:12.239 align:start position:0%
so that would not correct the problem if
 
04:19:15.110 --> 04:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
that in fact was a problem
 
04:19:17.750 --> 04:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
so for those reasons i'm asking the
 
04:19:19.429 --> 04:19:19.439 align:start position:0%
committee to vote inexpedient to
 
04:19:19.439 --> 04:19:20.870 align:start position:0%
committee to vote inexpedient to
legislate

04:19:20.870 --> 04:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
04:19:23.830 --> 04:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
and i will just add that i am happy to
 
04:19:25.910 --> 04:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
at any point meet with any
 
04:19:28.309 --> 04:19:28.319 align:start position:0%
representative who is sponsoring a bill
 
04:19:30.469 --> 04:19:30.479 align:start position:0%
to provide any sort of feedback and
 
04:19:32.469 --> 04:19:32.479 align:start position:0%
amendments which is exactly what i did
 
04:19:34.070 --> 04:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
with these bills when they were brought
 
04:19:39.990 --> 04:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:43.590 --> 04:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
thank you miss messina any questions uh
 
04:19:48.630 --> 04:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:51.189 --> 04:19:51.199 align:start position:0%
can you out unmute yourself yes can you
 
04:19:52.790 --> 04:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
hear me
 
04:19:54.070 --> 04:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am
 
04:19:55.990 --> 04:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
04:19:56.000 --> 04:19:57.750 align:start position:0%
thank you um
so

04:19:57.750 --> 04:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:19:59.990 --> 04:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
miss justina could you
 
04:20:02.950 --> 04:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
in your um description of
 
04:20:05.429 --> 04:20:05.439 align:start position:0%
the differentiations between the courts
 
04:20:07.670 --> 04:20:07.680 align:start position:0%
um i think it right at the front end of
 
04:20:10.790 --> 04:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
that you mentioned
 
04:20:12.870 --> 04:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
the um
 
04:20:14.229 --> 04:20:14.239 align:start position:0%
that in
 
04:20:16.950 --> 04:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
some cases of domestic violence
 
04:20:19.429 --> 04:20:19.439 align:start position:0%
it doesn't rise to the level of a
 
04:20:19.439 --> 04:20:20.790 align:start position:0%
it doesn't rise to the level of a
criminal

04:20:20.790 --> 04:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
criminal
 
04:20:20.800 --> 04:20:24.149 align:start position:0%
criminal
um

04:20:24.149 --> 04:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:26.790 --> 04:20:26.800 align:start position:0%
finding or a criminal
 
04:20:26.800 --> 04:20:27.910 align:start position:0%
finding or a criminal
um

04:20:27.910 --> 04:20:27.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:30.309 --> 04:20:30.319 align:start position:0%
a criminal case
 
04:20:30.319 --> 04:20:31.510 align:start position:0%
a criminal case
so

04:20:31.510 --> 04:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:20:34.070 --> 04:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
could you could you just
 
04:20:36.149 --> 04:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
could you just go over that one more
 
04:20:38.790 --> 04:20:38.800 align:start position:0%
time before absolutely that's my that's
 
04:20:41.030 --> 04:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
my question is a repeat of that piece of
 
04:20:42.950 --> 04:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
04:20:44.149 --> 04:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you for the question
 
04:20:46.950 --> 04:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to do that yeah so
 
04:20:50.710 --> 04:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
in the example i gave you have two um
 
04:20:53.830 --> 04:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
parents they share a child
 
04:20:56.630 --> 04:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
one parent is abusive to the other
 
04:20:56.640 --> 04:20:58.149 align:start position:0%
one parent is abusive to the other
parent

04:20:58.149 --> 04:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
parent
 
04:21:00.790 --> 04:21:00.800 align:start position:0%
is putting that person down is saying i
 
04:21:01.990 --> 04:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
wish you were
 
04:21:04.870 --> 04:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
dead i hate you you're so fat
 
04:21:06.870 --> 04:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
um you're ugly you're worthless you do
 
04:21:08.710 --> 04:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
nothing for this house i contribute
 
04:21:11.189 --> 04:21:11.199 align:start position:0%
everything financially you do nothing
 
04:21:13.269 --> 04:21:13.279 align:start position:0%
what do you do for this family
 
04:21:16.550 --> 04:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
that's horrible and that's abusive
 
04:21:19.189 --> 04:21:19.199 align:start position:0%
and that is uncalled for and i think we
 
04:21:20.950 --> 04:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
can all agree that that is not
 
04:21:22.550 --> 04:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
appropriate behavior
 
04:21:24.950 --> 04:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
but if that person in this case let's
 
04:21:25.910 --> 04:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
just say
 
04:21:27.030 --> 04:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
the mom
 
04:21:29.910 --> 04:21:29.920 align:start position:0%
takes that to a police department the
 
04:21:32.149 --> 04:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
police department is not going to charge
 
04:21:35.110 --> 04:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
that person with a criminal act not
 
04:21:37.030 --> 04:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
they're not going to say we're going to
 
04:21:38.790 --> 04:21:38.800 align:start position:0%
arrest you we're going to charge you
 
04:21:40.070 --> 04:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to bring this to the county
 
04:21:42.630 --> 04:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
attorneys because how are they going to
 
04:21:45.510 --> 04:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
charge that our law doesn't really
 
04:21:48.389 --> 04:21:48.399 align:start position:0%
um account for that
 
04:21:50.070 --> 04:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
if there was some criminal threatening
 
04:21:53.429 --> 04:21:53.439 align:start position:0%
involved yes perhaps in that situation
 
04:21:56.070 --> 04:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
um but the the reality is the police are
 
04:21:58.309 --> 04:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
not going to charge that person
 
04:21:58.319 --> 04:21:59.189 align:start position:0%
not going to charge that person
um

04:21:59.189 --> 04:21:59.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:02.630 --> 04:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
so it's not a criminal case and we don't
 
04:22:04.630 --> 04:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
want those cases
 
04:22:05.830 --> 04:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
to go
 
04:22:08.389 --> 04:22:08.399 align:start position:0%
to superior court where they do handle
 
04:22:11.590 --> 04:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
criminal cases we want these cases to be
 
04:22:11.600 --> 04:22:13.030 align:start position:0%
criminal cases we want these cases to be
heard

04:22:13.030 --> 04:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
heard
 
04:22:15.910 --> 04:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
by judges who are trained and we want
 
04:22:17.670 --> 04:22:17.680 align:start position:0%
them to be heard by judges who
 
04:22:22.070 --> 04:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
understand rsa 458 and 461a
 
04:22:22.080 --> 04:22:22.950 align:start position:0%
understand rsa 458 and 461a
um

04:22:22.950 --> 04:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:25.590 --> 04:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
and honestly we don't want people
 
04:22:28.229 --> 04:22:28.239 align:start position:0%
involved in family court cases to feel
 
04:22:28.239 --> 04:22:29.269 align:start position:0%
involved in family court cases to feel
like

04:22:29.269 --> 04:22:29.279 align:start position:0%
like
 
04:22:32.950 --> 04:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
they're involved in a criminal situation
 
04:22:35.349 --> 04:22:35.359 align:start position:0%
we want to support families we don't
 
04:22:36.870 --> 04:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
want to make them feel like they're
 
04:22:39.349 --> 04:22:39.359 align:start position:0%
doing something wrong that's not to say
 
04:22:41.110 --> 04:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
that there is not inappropriate and
 
04:22:43.429 --> 04:22:43.439 align:start position:0%
abusive behavior going on in family
 
04:22:44.950 --> 04:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
court and with
 
04:22:46.710 --> 04:22:46.720 align:start position:0%
litigants involved in the family court
 
04:22:49.030 --> 04:22:49.040 align:start position:0%
system there absolutely is and there are
 
04:22:53.590 --> 04:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:57.590 --> 04:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:58.870 --> 04:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:23:03.670 --> 04:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:05.830 --> 04:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you and thank you for
 
04:23:07.670 --> 04:23:07.680 align:start position:0%
taking the question it seemed
 
04:23:09.830 --> 04:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
i just uh wanted to clarify it seemed
 
04:23:11.189 --> 04:23:11.199 align:start position:0%
that you
 
04:23:11.199 --> 04:23:12.550 align:start position:0%
that you
um

04:23:12.550 --> 04:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:14.469 --> 04:23:14.479 align:start position:0%
on one hand said that you were
 
04:23:18.469 --> 04:23:18.479 align:start position:0%
advocating for this to not be moved um
 
04:23:21.349 --> 04:23:21.359 align:start position:0%
to the circuit court um because those
 
04:23:23.910 --> 04:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
judges weren't trained but then in the
 
04:23:26.870 --> 04:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
next sentence you said that um if they
 
04:23:28.550 --> 04:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
were moved to the circuit court it would
 
04:23:30.550 --> 04:23:30.560 align:start position:0%
be the same judge that hears it so can
 
04:23:34.630 --> 04:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:36.550 --> 04:23:36.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question no it's too
 
04:23:39.510 --> 04:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
different so superior court is separate
 
04:23:41.510 --> 04:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
from circuit court
 
04:23:44.469 --> 04:23:44.479 align:start position:0%
completely separate so within circuit
 
04:23:46.870 --> 04:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
court you have family division and you
 
04:23:49.110 --> 04:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
have the district division
 
04:23:49.120 --> 04:23:49.830 align:start position:0%
have the district division
so

04:23:49.830 --> 04:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:23:52.389 --> 04:23:52.399 align:start position:0%
the judges most times there's overlap
 
04:23:53.990 --> 04:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
between the district court judges and
 
04:23:55.670 --> 04:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
the family division judges they are
 
04:23:55.680 --> 04:23:57.269 align:start position:0%
the family division judges they are
hearing

04:23:57.269 --> 04:23:57.279 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
04:23:59.590 --> 04:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
both kinds of cases within the circuit
 
04:23:59.600 --> 04:24:00.550 align:start position:0%
both kinds of cases within the circuit
court

04:24:00.550 --> 04:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
court
 
04:24:02.149 --> 04:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
does that make sense
 
04:24:03.110 --> 04:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
i can
 
04:24:04.389 --> 04:24:04.399 align:start position:0%
explain that a little better if
 
04:24:04.399 --> 04:24:06.309 align:start position:0%
explain that a little better if
necessary

04:24:06.309 --> 04:24:06.319 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
04:24:07.990 --> 04:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
but i don't think they should be
 
04:24:09.990 --> 04:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
referred to superior court because those
 
04:24:13.269 --> 04:24:13.279 align:start position:0%
judges don't handle family law cases
 
04:24:15.189 --> 04:24:15.199 align:start position:0%
but within the circuit court you might
 
04:24:17.990 --> 04:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
have a district court judge who also
 
04:24:19.990 --> 04:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
hears family court cases because they
 
04:24:23.189 --> 04:24:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:26.149 --> 04:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:31.110 --> 04:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:33.189 --> 04:24:33.199 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you mr
 
04:24:35.110 --> 04:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
cena for coming today and sharing your
 
04:24:35.120 --> 04:24:36.550 align:start position:0%
cena for coming today and sharing your
testimony

04:24:36.550 --> 04:24:36.560 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
04:24:38.469 --> 04:24:38.479 align:start position:0%
i just have a question regarding the
 
04:24:41.510 --> 04:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
definition of domestic violence
 
04:24:41.520 --> 04:24:43.030 align:start position:0%
definition of domestic violence
so

04:24:43.030 --> 04:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:24:45.189 --> 04:24:45.199 align:start position:0%
how does it get defined
 
04:24:45.199 --> 04:24:47.670 align:start position:0%
how does it get defined
um

04:24:47.670 --> 04:24:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:51.269 --> 04:24:51.279 align:start position:0%
and is emotional or psychological abuse
 
04:24:53.910 --> 04:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
part of our definition
 
04:24:56.309 --> 04:24:56.319 align:start position:0%
and then i do have a follow-up if other
 
04:24:56.319 --> 04:24:58.229 align:start position:0%
and then i do have a follow-up if other
states

04:24:58.229 --> 04:24:58.239 align:start position:0%
states
 
04:25:00.950 --> 04:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
do include emotional and psychological
 
04:25:02.550 --> 04:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
abuse as part of
 
04:25:05.189 --> 04:25:05.199 align:start position:0%
domestic violence cases if there is any
 
04:25:07.910 --> 04:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not very familiar so
 
04:25:07.920 --> 04:25:08.870 align:start position:0%
i'm not very familiar so
sure

04:25:08.870 --> 04:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
sure
 
04:25:11.389 --> 04:25:11.399 align:start position:0%
so thank you for your question so under
 
04:25:16.070 --> 04:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
173 b which is the law that we use
 
04:25:18.149 --> 04:25:18.159 align:start position:0%
um to help a victim get a protective
 
04:25:20.710 --> 04:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
order from domestic violence
 
04:25:22.550 --> 04:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
the definition abuse means the
 
04:25:24.950 --> 04:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
commission or attempted commission of
 
04:25:27.910 --> 04:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
one or more of the acts described below
 
04:25:29.910 --> 04:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
and those acts include assault or
 
04:25:32.870 --> 04:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
reckless conduct criminal threatening
 
04:25:35.750 --> 04:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
sexual assault interference with freedom
 
04:25:38.389 --> 04:25:38.399 align:start position:0%
destruction of property unauthorized
 
04:25:40.870 --> 04:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
entry and harassment
 
04:25:43.980 --> 04:25:43.990 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't explicitly say
 
04:25:43.990 --> 04:25:45.189 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't explicitly say
[Music]

04:25:45.189 --> 04:25:45.199 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:25:47.670 --> 04:25:47.680 align:start position:0%
psychological abuse mental abuse any of
 
04:25:51.030 --> 04:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
those things certainly you know you
 
04:25:53.750 --> 04:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
could make a case um
 
04:25:54.710 --> 04:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:25:57.269 --> 04:25:57.279 align:start position:0%
there may be some criminal threatening
 
04:26:00.149 --> 04:26:00.159 align:start position:0%
um in a situation that i you know the
 
04:26:03.189 --> 04:26:03.199 align:start position:0%
one the example that i provided um
 
04:26:05.189 --> 04:26:05.199 align:start position:0%
that there could have been some criminal
 
04:26:05.199 --> 04:26:06.309 align:start position:0%
that there could have been some criminal
threatening

04:26:06.309 --> 04:26:06.319 align:start position:0%
threatening
 
04:26:09.030 --> 04:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
um within some of that psychological
 
04:26:11.429 --> 04:26:11.439 align:start position:0%
abuse but for the most part it doesn't
 
04:26:13.590 --> 04:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
encompass those things
 
04:26:13.600 --> 04:26:15.750 align:start position:0%
encompass those things
um

04:26:15.750 --> 04:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:18.229 --> 04:26:18.239 align:start position:0%
so that's what we're left with at the
 
04:26:18.239 --> 04:26:19.429 align:start position:0%
so that's what we're left with at the
moment

04:26:19.429 --> 04:26:19.439 align:start position:0%
moment
 
04:26:21.590 --> 04:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
um and i'm sorry what was the other
 
04:26:23.670 --> 04:26:23.680 align:start position:0%
part of your question
 
04:26:23.680 --> 04:26:24.790 align:start position:0%
part of your question
whether

04:26:24.790 --> 04:26:24.800 align:start position:0%
whether
 
04:26:27.830 --> 04:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
if there's any other kids law like our
 
04:26:30.710 --> 04:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
other states
 
04:26:32.710 --> 04:26:32.720 align:start position:0%
is there any movement towards that
 
04:26:34.950 --> 04:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
emotional and psychological piece being
 
04:26:36.469 --> 04:26:36.479 align:start position:0%
included in
 
04:26:36.479 --> 04:26:37.429 align:start position:0%
included in
cases

04:26:37.429 --> 04:26:37.439 align:start position:0%
cases
 
04:26:39.429 --> 04:26:39.439 align:start position:0%
so i don't have the statistics in front
 
04:26:41.750 --> 04:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
of me it's certainly um something that
 
04:26:44.870 --> 04:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
we talk about kind of in the um
 
04:26:47.269 --> 04:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
domestic violence advocacy arena is
 
04:26:48.950 --> 04:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
whether or not and i think some states
 
04:26:50.309 --> 04:26:50.319 align:start position:0%
have probably moved to do this to
 
04:26:52.550 --> 04:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
include psychological abuse within the
 
04:26:54.790 --> 04:26:54.800 align:start position:0%
definition of abuse
 
04:26:57.429 --> 04:26:57.439 align:start position:0%
because we that's frustrating because we
 
04:27:00.550 --> 04:27:00.560 align:start position:0%
know that that is abusive and coercive
 
04:27:02.229 --> 04:27:02.239 align:start position:0%
controlling behavior
 
04:27:04.730 --> 04:27:04.740 align:start position:0%
but our laws don't always
 
04:27:04.740 --> 04:27:05.910 align:start position:0%
but our laws don't always
[Music]

04:27:05.910 --> 04:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:27:07.910 --> 04:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
include those things
 
04:27:07.920 --> 04:27:08.710 align:start position:0%
include those things
so

04:27:08.710 --> 04:27:08.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:27:10.790 --> 04:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
i can't answer your question directly as
 
04:27:12.790 --> 04:27:12.800 align:start position:0%
to which states i think there are some i
 
04:27:15.110 --> 04:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
could certainly get that information for
 
04:27:15.120 --> 04:27:16.229 align:start position:0%
could certainly get that information for
you

04:27:16.229 --> 04:27:16.239 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:27:18.149 --> 04:27:18.159 align:start position:0%
i just don't have it at the tip of my
 
04:27:22.710 --> 04:27:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:25.670 --> 04:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:27.910 --> 04:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
04:27:30.070 --> 04:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
from mr cena
 
04:27:33.429 --> 04:27:33.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr cena thank you
 
04:27:36.630 --> 04:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
uh we'll now go to our next
 
04:27:41.910 --> 04:27:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:45.910 --> 04:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:47.910 --> 04:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
hi again um i hope you guys had a nice
 
04:27:47.920 --> 04:27:48.870 align:start position:0%
hi again um i hope you guys had a nice
lunch

04:27:48.870 --> 04:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
lunch
 
04:27:50.870 --> 04:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
um so i just wanted to speak to a couple
 
04:27:53.030 --> 04:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
things that were brought up um and i
 
04:27:55.429 --> 04:27:55.439 align:start position:0%
didn't i didn't hear her name um but
 
04:27:56.950 --> 04:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
from the coalition against domestic
 
04:27:58.389 --> 04:27:58.399 align:start position:0%
violence i mean she brings up a lot of
 
04:28:00.550 --> 04:28:00.560 align:start position:0%
really great points um
 
04:28:03.269 --> 04:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
but they're one of the first comments um
 
04:28:05.030 --> 04:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
there's not going to be any data and
 
04:28:06.950 --> 04:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
unless you're working for the coalition
 
04:28:08.950 --> 04:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
or you're working or you have a passion
 
04:28:10.469 --> 04:28:10.479 align:start position:0%
for really helping this particular
 
04:28:10.479 --> 04:28:11.830 align:start position:0%
for really helping this particular
population

04:28:11.830 --> 04:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
population
 
04:28:13.269 --> 04:28:13.279 align:start position:0%
there isn't going to be any data because
 
04:28:17.189 --> 04:28:17.199 align:start position:0%
it's ignored right so if um
 
04:28:19.670 --> 04:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
for example i have one case right now
 
04:28:21.030 --> 04:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
that's one of my patients that i'm
 
04:28:23.189 --> 04:28:23.199 align:start position:0%
working with and i'm honestly
 
04:28:25.030 --> 04:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
the coalition doesn't have enough people
 
04:28:27.510 --> 04:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
or enough time to be able to help as
 
04:28:29.189 --> 04:28:29.199 align:start position:0%
many people so i try to help as much as
 
04:28:30.950 --> 04:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
possible as well
 
04:28:32.710 --> 04:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
who a judge just told her she's in a
 
04:28:34.469 --> 04:28:34.479 align:start position:0%
domestic violence situation she's been
 
04:28:36.149 --> 04:28:36.159 align:start position:0%
unable to get a restraining order we've
 
04:28:37.830 --> 04:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
shown pictures of
 
04:28:39.110 --> 04:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
her having
 
04:28:39.120 --> 04:28:39.990 align:start position:0%
her having
the

04:28:39.990 --> 04:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:28:41.990 --> 04:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
the uh the ex having
 
04:28:43.990 --> 04:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
guns saying he's going to he's going to
 
04:28:46.070 --> 04:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
kill them um
 
04:28:46.080 --> 04:28:48.070 align:start position:0%
kill them um
there's

04:28:48.070 --> 04:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
there's
 
04:28:49.750 --> 04:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
pictures of abuse this man has never
 
04:28:51.590 --> 04:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
been arrested i mean i think it's really
 
04:28:53.510 --> 04:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
important that we point to the fact of
 
04:28:56.070 --> 04:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
how bad it really is and how nothing is
 
04:28:58.309 --> 04:28:58.319 align:start position:0%
really actually being done even if this
 
04:28:59.590 --> 04:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
particular person was to have a
 
04:29:01.349 --> 04:29:01.359 align:start position:0%
restraining oh in family court the point
 
04:29:02.630 --> 04:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
i was trying to make is that the judge
 
04:29:04.710 --> 04:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
actually called her a spoiled brat
 
04:29:08.630 --> 04:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
um and they're allowed to be abused so
 
04:29:10.229 --> 04:29:10.239 align:start position:0%
that's i mean that's one point but the
 
04:29:11.990 --> 04:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
other point is that even if she had a
 
04:29:14.710 --> 04:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
restraining order or even on that family
 
04:29:16.469 --> 04:29:16.479 align:start position:0%
parenting order there is a restraining
 
04:29:19.990 --> 04:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
order it is civil and it doesn't mean
 
04:29:20.000 --> 04:29:21.269 align:start position:0%
order it is civil and it doesn't mean
anything

04:29:21.269 --> 04:29:21.279 align:start position:0%
anything
 
04:29:22.950 --> 04:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
um so even if she was to have a
 
04:29:24.630 --> 04:29:24.640 align:start position:0%
restraining order speaking about another
 
04:29:27.590 --> 04:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
patient whose tires were slashed and she
 
04:29:29.349 --> 04:29:29.359 align:start position:0%
called the police and the police said
 
04:29:31.750 --> 04:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
well we can't prove it's him so
 
04:29:33.269 --> 04:29:33.279 align:start position:0%
there's nothing they can do
 
04:29:35.510 --> 04:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
so these people aren't being arrested um
 
04:29:37.189 --> 04:29:37.199 align:start position:0%
there's criminal threatening happening
 
04:29:38.950 --> 04:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
there's physical abuse
 
04:29:41.110 --> 04:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
it's not being treated as criminal they
 
04:29:42.870 --> 04:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
go into the family court and it's almost
 
04:29:44.710 --> 04:29:44.720 align:start position:0%
as if in when they're in the family
 
04:29:46.149 --> 04:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
court and they're talking about custody
 
04:29:47.510 --> 04:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
and divorce and all of these different
 
04:29:47.520 --> 04:29:48.389 align:start position:0%
and divorce and all of these different
things

04:29:48.389 --> 04:29:48.399 align:start position:0%
things
 
04:29:51.110 --> 04:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
it's well this happens in families right
 
04:29:53.349 --> 04:29:53.359 align:start position:0%
this is what it looks like if i have the
 
04:29:56.149 --> 04:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
most horrifying pictures from some of my
 
04:29:57.910 --> 04:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
patients and i help them like i said i
 
04:29:59.590 --> 04:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
help them kind of put it together so
 
04:30:01.750 --> 04:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
that when they go to a an attorney or
 
04:30:03.910 --> 04:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
they go to the police they're able to
 
04:30:05.990 --> 04:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
speak because these
 
04:30:07.990 --> 04:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
men and women but mostly women are
 
04:30:09.670 --> 04:30:09.680 align:start position:0%
speaking will their voices completely
 
04:30:09.680 --> 04:30:10.950 align:start position:0%
speaking will their voices completely
shaking

04:30:10.950 --> 04:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
shaking
 
04:30:12.229 --> 04:30:12.239 align:start position:0%
they're having to go to court they're
 
04:30:15.670 --> 04:30:15.680 align:start position:0%
having to face their abuser and
 
04:30:17.429 --> 04:30:17.439 align:start position:0%
one that's not fair
 
04:30:19.189 --> 04:30:19.199 align:start position:0%
they're expected they're going to look
 
04:30:20.710 --> 04:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
weak they're going to look like it's
 
04:30:23.030 --> 04:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
their fault
 
04:30:25.030 --> 04:30:25.040 align:start position:0%
their abuser the state of new hampshire
 
04:30:26.469 --> 04:30:26.479 align:start position:0%
is telling them that
 
04:30:27.910 --> 04:30:27.920 align:start position:0%
they didn't do anything wrong right when
 
04:30:29.429 --> 04:30:29.439 align:start position:0%
you do something wrong you get arrested
 
04:30:31.510 --> 04:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
or you're held accountable for it
 
04:30:33.030 --> 04:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
um i think that's the biggest part that
 
04:30:34.630 --> 04:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
betty's trying to make from this is that
 
04:30:36.469 --> 04:30:36.479 align:start position:0%
there's no accountability in family
 
04:30:39.349 --> 04:30:39.359 align:start position:0%
court um and like i said there's not
 
04:30:40.870 --> 04:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
gonna be any data because there just
 
04:30:40.880 --> 04:30:42.389 align:start position:0%
gonna be any data because there just
isn't

04:30:42.389 --> 04:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
isn't
 
04:30:44.710 --> 04:30:44.720 align:start position:0%
there isn't any there just isn't any
 
04:30:46.630 --> 04:30:46.640 align:start position:0%
accountability i think one of the very
 
04:30:49.269 --> 04:30:49.279 align:start position:0%
first comments too um is i don't know
 
04:30:51.269 --> 04:30:51.279 align:start position:0%
who it was that said it and i'm
 
04:30:54.630 --> 04:30:54.640 align:start position:0%
i just want to bring up the bias um i'm
 
04:30:56.229 --> 04:30:56.239 align:start position:0%
definitely not trying here to hurt
 
04:30:57.910 --> 04:30:57.920 align:start position:0%
anybody's feelings but
 
04:30:59.670 --> 04:30:59.680 align:start position:0%
the very first question that said is
 
04:31:02.870 --> 04:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
can't this be used as a weapon so if we
 
04:31:05.510 --> 04:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
bring this over to family court um over
 
04:31:08.070 --> 04:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
to criminal court couldn't this be used
 
04:31:09.590 --> 04:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
as a weapon
 
04:31:11.429 --> 04:31:11.439 align:start position:0%
that is the reason that i am speaking
 
04:31:12.550 --> 04:31:12.560 align:start position:0%
right now
 
04:31:12.560 --> 04:31:13.670 align:start position:0%
right now
women

04:31:13.670 --> 04:31:13.680 align:start position:0%
women
 
04:31:16.630 --> 04:31:16.640 align:start position:0%
specifically mostly they don't lie do
 
04:31:18.630 --> 04:31:18.640 align:start position:0%
you know how hard it is
 
04:31:20.550 --> 04:31:20.560 align:start position:0%
that's the first thought is that women
 
04:31:21.990 --> 04:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
are lying
 
04:31:24.389 --> 04:31:24.399 align:start position:0%
they're using this as a weapon
 
04:31:24.399 --> 04:31:25.670 align:start position:0%
they're using this as a weapon
and

04:31:25.670 --> 04:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:31:27.590 --> 04:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
they are at they have to be able to
 
04:31:29.750 --> 04:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
prove it more than their
 
04:31:31.990 --> 04:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
abuser has to prove they didn't do it
 
04:31:34.469 --> 04:31:34.479 align:start position:0%
that's just society that's what we go to
 
04:31:37.670 --> 04:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
is that parental alienation it's it's in
 
04:31:39.429 --> 04:31:39.439 align:start position:0%
us it's in our society it's how we're
 
04:31:42.070 --> 04:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
raised i promise you
 
04:31:44.870 --> 04:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
that going to family court or going to
 
04:31:47.590 --> 04:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
court and saying that you were raped
 
04:31:49.830 --> 04:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
saying that you were physically abused
 
04:31:52.710 --> 04:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
these people are so vulnerable it is so
 
04:31:55.590 --> 04:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
scary even if it even if it was barely
 
04:31:57.110 --> 04:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
anything just walking into court and
 
04:31:58.870 --> 04:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
nothing happened to you
 
04:32:02.149 --> 04:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
you probably get nervous
 
04:32:03.349 --> 04:32:03.359 align:start position:0%
people aren't going to go to those
 
04:32:05.349 --> 04:32:05.359 align:start position:0%
lengths unless they are
 
04:32:09.189 --> 04:32:09.199 align:start position:0%
i mean a very extreme sociopath
 
04:32:11.110 --> 04:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
so i think that that assumption the very
 
04:32:12.469 --> 04:32:12.479 align:start position:0%
first assumption is that people are
 
04:32:14.309 --> 04:32:14.319 align:start position:0%
lying and they're they're weaponizing it
 
04:32:16.790 --> 04:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
against in within their divorce case i
 
04:32:19.110 --> 04:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
just really need like this this group to
 
04:32:21.510 --> 04:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
hear that that's not true
 
04:32:23.349 --> 04:32:23.359 align:start position:0%
i want the assumption to be that people
 
04:32:25.510 --> 04:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
are telling the truth
 
04:32:27.590 --> 04:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
not that they're lying we can look to
 
04:32:29.590 --> 04:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
find out right but the assumption would
 
04:32:31.429 --> 04:32:31.439 align:start position:0%
be that they're telling the truth
 
04:32:33.269 --> 04:32:33.279 align:start position:0%
and that is just something that societal
 
04:32:35.590 --> 04:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
is inbred in us is that they that it's
 
04:32:37.910 --> 04:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
used as a weapon is that they're lying
 
04:32:39.830 --> 04:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
um and then like i said that the
 
04:32:41.189 --> 04:32:41.199 align:start position:0%
restraining orders and the stalking
 
04:32:43.349 --> 04:32:43.359 align:start position:0%
orders like nothing happens anyways so
 
04:32:44.550 --> 04:32:44.560 align:start position:0%
there isn't going to be any data there
 
04:32:46.630 --> 04:32:46.640 align:start position:0%
isn't it's not considered criminal
 
04:32:49.030 --> 04:32:49.040 align:start position:0%
families fight right people get there
 
04:32:51.510 --> 04:32:51.520 align:start position:0%
people get get hurt kids get hurt when
 
04:32:54.389 --> 04:32:54.399 align:start position:0%
they're in toxic relationships and
 
04:32:56.149 --> 04:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
that's the frame of mind
 
04:32:58.229 --> 04:32:58.239 align:start position:0%
i've never actually had
 
04:33:00.070 --> 04:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
one of my the people that i've been
 
04:33:01.510 --> 04:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
working with
 
04:33:03.670 --> 04:33:03.680 align:start position:0%
in some of the most horrific stories
 
04:33:05.510 --> 04:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
including sexual abuse
 
04:33:05.520 --> 04:33:06.869 align:start position:0%
including sexual abuse
from

04:33:06.869 --> 04:33:06.879 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:33:08.789 --> 04:33:08.799 align:start position:0%
a mother and boyfriend nobody's ever
 
04:33:10.551 --> 04:33:10.561 align:start position:0%
been arrested
 
04:33:12.709 --> 04:33:12.719 align:start position:0%
so it's never been treated as a criminal
 
04:33:14.230 --> 04:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
case and
 
04:33:16.709 --> 04:33:16.719 align:start position:0%
those people the abusers typically get
 
04:33:16.719 --> 04:33:19.830 align:start position:0%
those people the abusers typically get
custody

04:33:19.830 --> 04:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:22.070 --> 04:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
so that's all
 
04:33:23.990 --> 04:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
i also sent some clarification on
 
04:33:26.310 --> 04:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
billing and icd codes during the break
 
04:33:27.670 --> 04:33:27.680 align:start position:0%
because i knew that that was confusing
 
04:33:31.510 --> 04:33:31.520 align:start position:0%
about the last one at the end
 
04:33:34.709 --> 04:33:34.719 align:start position:0%
thank you do you have written testimony
 
04:33:37.189 --> 04:33:37.199 align:start position:0%

04:33:37.199 --> 04:33:37.910 align:start position:0%

please send that to the children and
 
04:33:42.830 --> 04:33:42.840 align:start position:0%

family law site

04:33:50.629 --> 04:33:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:53.349 --> 04:33:53.359 align:start position:0%
seeing none i will let you know that ms
 
04:33:56.230 --> 04:33:56.240 align:start position:0%
hodge is the last person on my written
 
04:33:58.390 --> 04:33:58.400 align:start position:0%
list to testify
 
04:34:00.949 --> 04:34:00.959 align:start position:0%
although i do see a couple of hands up
 
04:34:02.709 --> 04:34:02.719 align:start position:0%
and i believe it's for
 
04:34:05.429 --> 04:34:05.439 align:start position:0%
people who
 
04:34:08.629 --> 04:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
want to testify and the next person with
 
04:34:15.590 --> 04:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:17.590 --> 04:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
could you please state your name where
 
04:34:18.789 --> 04:34:18.799 align:start position:0%
you're from
 
04:34:20.629 --> 04:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
who you're representing and whether
 
04:34:24.310 --> 04:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
you're in support or not in support
 
04:34:26.230 --> 04:34:26.240 align:start position:0%
i'm in support of the bill with an
 
04:34:29.189 --> 04:34:29.199 align:start position:0%
amendment um
 
04:34:31.590 --> 04:34:31.600 align:start position:0%
and i i do believe that the language
 
04:34:33.750 --> 04:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
needs to come out um
 
04:34:36.150 --> 04:34:36.160 align:start position:0%
and where are you from and who are you
 
04:34:36.160 --> 04:34:37.830 align:start position:0%

i'm representing myself
 
04:34:42.869 --> 04:34:42.879 align:start position:0%
and i respectfully decline to tell you
 
04:34:46.789 --> 04:34:46.799 align:start position:0%
where i'm from because i am also afraid
 
04:34:49.029 --> 04:34:49.039 align:start position:0%
of one of the losers that we're talking
 
04:34:50.869 --> 04:34:50.879 align:start position:0%
about okay
 
04:34:52.709 --> 04:34:52.719 align:start position:0%
i don't live in new hampshire anymore
 
04:34:54.869 --> 04:34:54.879 align:start position:0%
but i practiced my entire legal career
 
04:34:56.070 --> 04:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
04:34:56.080 --> 04:34:57.189 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
okay

04:34:57.189 --> 04:34:57.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:34:57.199 --> 04:35:00.789 align:start position:0%
okay
um

04:35:00.789 --> 04:35:00.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:02.150 --> 04:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
with respect
 
04:35:04.629 --> 04:35:04.639 align:start position:0%
you know i had a kid
 
04:35:06.629 --> 04:35:06.639 align:start position:0%
that was uh
 
04:35:08.949 --> 04:35:08.959 align:start position:0%
in a very abusive relationship in her
 
04:35:08.959 --> 04:35:10.709 align:start position:0%
in a very abusive relationship in her
twenties

04:35:10.709 --> 04:35:10.719 align:start position:0%
twenties
 
04:35:13.830 --> 04:35:13.840 align:start position:0%
and at the time my husband and i were
 
04:35:16.230 --> 04:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
estranged from her
 
04:35:19.590 --> 04:35:19.600 align:start position:0%
but we knew about the abuse because in
 
04:35:21.349 --> 04:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
uh two years
 
04:35:23.990 --> 04:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh we watched the insurance pay out a
 
04:35:27.750 --> 04:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars in the er bills
 
04:35:29.990 --> 04:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh you know i
 
04:35:31.830 --> 04:35:31.840 align:start position:0%
at this point it was many years ago and
 
04:35:34.830 --> 04:35:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:38.470 --> 04:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
um i i forget precisely how many trips
 
04:35:40.949 --> 04:35:40.959 align:start position:0%
that represented
 
04:35:40.959 --> 04:35:42.551 align:start position:0%
that represented
um

04:35:42.551 --> 04:35:42.561 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:45.990 --> 04:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
i do believe that these cases need to be
 
04:35:46.000 --> 04:35:47.269 align:start position:0%
i do believe that these cases need to be
heard

04:35:47.269 --> 04:35:47.279 align:start position:0%
heard
 
04:35:48.830 --> 04:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
in a different
 
04:35:51.510 --> 04:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
court and
 
04:35:55.429 --> 04:35:55.439 align:start position:0%
my thought is that superior court judges
 
04:35:57.830 --> 04:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
are the best trained
 
04:36:00.869 --> 04:36:00.879 align:start position:0%
with respect to the rules of evidence
 
04:36:02.830 --> 04:36:02.840 align:start position:0%
and that's because the criminal defense
 
04:36:06.709 --> 04:36:06.719 align:start position:0%
bar uh files a lot of emotions you know
 
04:36:06.719 --> 04:36:09.109 align:start position:0%
bar uh files a lot of emotions you know
um

04:36:09.109 --> 04:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:11.269 --> 04:36:11.279 align:start position:0%
there's there are many many evidentiary
 
04:36:14.470 --> 04:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
motions in criminal cases
 
04:36:14.480 --> 04:36:16.310 align:start position:0%
motions in criminal cases
um

04:36:16.310 --> 04:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:18.150 --> 04:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
and i i don't think the family court
 
04:36:20.150 --> 04:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
judges are well trained on the rules of
 
04:36:20.160 --> 04:36:21.109 align:start position:0%
judges are well trained on the rules of
evidence

04:36:21.109 --> 04:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
04:36:23.990 --> 04:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
and i'll just give you know aside
 
04:36:25.670 --> 04:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
again i'm supplementing my written
 
04:36:28.070 --> 04:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
testimony that you people should have
 
04:36:30.230 --> 04:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
had from before
 
04:36:30.240 --> 04:36:34.070 align:start position:0%
had from before
um

04:36:34.070 --> 04:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:35.910 --> 04:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
we've you know we've talked about there
 
04:36:37.590 --> 04:36:37.600 align:start position:0%
actually is a new hampshire case law
 
04:36:38.629 --> 04:36:38.639 align:start position:0%
that says
 
04:36:41.109 --> 04:36:41.119 align:start position:0%
a parent that alienates a kid should not
 
04:36:43.429 --> 04:36:43.439 align:start position:0%
benefit from the behavior
 
04:36:45.429 --> 04:36:45.439 align:start position:0%
and therefore it was okay to give
 
04:36:48.150 --> 04:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
custody to the other parent
 
04:36:50.150 --> 04:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
um the facts of the case were pretty
 
04:36:50.160 --> 04:36:51.269 align:start position:0%
um the facts of the case were pretty
clear

04:36:51.269 --> 04:36:51.279 align:start position:0%
clear
 
04:36:51.279 --> 04:36:52.949 align:start position:0%
clear
that

04:36:52.949 --> 04:36:52.959 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:36:52.959 --> 04:36:53.830 align:start position:0%
that
what

04:36:53.830 --> 04:36:53.840 align:start position:0%
what
 
04:36:56.789 --> 04:36:56.799 align:start position:0%
the one parent that lost custody did was
 
04:36:58.789 --> 04:36:58.799 align:start position:0%
kind of turn her kids against the father
 
04:37:02.150 --> 04:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
after the divorce was filed
 
04:37:03.750 --> 04:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
let me tell you what there is not a case
 
04:37:05.750 --> 04:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
on there isn't a case on parental
 
04:37:05.760 --> 04:37:07.830 align:start position:0%
on there isn't a case on parental
alienation

04:37:07.830 --> 04:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
alienation
 
04:37:09.349 --> 04:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
whether it meets the evidentiary
 
04:37:11.349 --> 04:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
standards for admissibility i think it
 
04:37:12.629 --> 04:37:12.639 align:start position:0%
would be
 
04:37:14.869 --> 04:37:14.879 align:start position:0%
an easy case to say that a superior
 
04:37:18.230 --> 04:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
court judge if somebody said let's have
 
04:37:19.429 --> 04:37:19.439 align:start position:0%
a hearing
 
04:37:19.439 --> 04:37:20.390 align:start position:0%
a hearing
on

04:37:20.390 --> 04:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:37:22.070 --> 04:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
04:37:24.150 --> 04:37:24.160 align:start position:0%
uh parental alienation is even
 
04:37:24.160 --> 04:37:25.429 align:start position:0%
uh parental alienation is even
admissible

04:37:25.429 --> 04:37:25.439 align:start position:0%
admissible
 
04:37:27.109 --> 04:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
which by the way is probably by the time
 
04:37:28.629 --> 04:37:28.639 align:start position:0%
you pull in experts a fifty thousand
 
04:37:31.189 --> 04:37:31.199 align:start position:0%
dollar hearing not anybody can afford
 
04:37:32.709 --> 04:37:32.719 align:start position:0%
one of those
 
04:37:32.719 --> 04:37:34.310 align:start position:0%
one of those
um

04:37:34.310 --> 04:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:35.990 --> 04:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
you know it involves expert witnesses
 
04:37:37.429 --> 04:37:37.439 align:start position:0%
and probably a lot of them would be
 
04:37:40.629 --> 04:37:40.639 align:start position:0%
coming from outside the state
 
04:37:40.639 --> 04:37:42.310 align:start position:0%
coming from outside the state
um

04:37:42.310 --> 04:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:44.230 --> 04:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
but a superior court judge would get
 
04:37:44.240 --> 04:37:45.670 align:start position:0%
but a superior court judge would get
that

04:37:45.670 --> 04:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:37:47.189 --> 04:37:47.199 align:start position:0%
and and would would go ahead and
 
04:37:48.551 --> 04:37:48.561 align:start position:0%
schedule the hearing and have the
 
04:37:50.709 --> 04:37:50.719 align:start position:0%
hearing and listen to both sides of the
 
04:37:50.719 --> 04:37:52.230 align:start position:0%
hearing and listen to both sides of the
argument

04:37:52.230 --> 04:37:52.240 align:start position:0%
argument
 
04:37:52.240 --> 04:37:53.269 align:start position:0%
argument
um

04:37:53.269 --> 04:37:53.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:55.109 --> 04:37:55.119 align:start position:0%
you know but but that said something
 
04:37:58.789 --> 04:37:58.799 align:start position:0%
like parental alienation is um
 
04:37:58.799 --> 04:38:00.390 align:start position:0%
like parental alienation is um
highly

04:38:00.390 --> 04:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
highly
 
04:38:00.400 --> 04:38:01.510 align:start position:0%
highly
um

04:38:01.510 --> 04:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:03.189 --> 04:38:03.199 align:start position:0%
you know it's been it's been struck down
 
04:38:06.070 --> 04:38:06.080 align:start position:0%
and declared inadmissible
 
04:38:08.869 --> 04:38:08.879 align:start position:0%
because it's junk science
 
04:38:08.879 --> 04:38:10.789 align:start position:0%
because it's junk science
um

04:38:10.789 --> 04:38:10.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:13.029 --> 04:38:13.039 align:start position:0%
and and i have to tell you
 
04:38:15.029 --> 04:38:15.039 align:start position:0%
you know when a family court judge and i
 
04:38:16.789 --> 04:38:16.799 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to read from my testimony
 
04:38:19.510 --> 04:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
for a minute um
 
04:38:21.189 --> 04:38:21.199 align:start position:0%
judge foley stated
 
04:38:24.709 --> 04:38:24.719 align:start position:0%
in his order dated january 10 2019 in a
 
04:38:24.719 --> 04:38:25.590 align:start position:0%
in his order dated january 10 2019 in a
case

04:38:25.590 --> 04:38:25.600 align:start position:0%
case
 
04:38:27.349 --> 04:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
i've considered the idea of setting an
 
04:38:29.349 --> 04:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
evidentiary hearing on the issue of
 
04:38:30.869 --> 04:38:30.879 align:start position:0%
whether mr
 
04:38:33.429 --> 04:38:33.439 align:start position:0%
whatever abused the child the gal said
 
04:38:36.150 --> 04:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
there was no objective evidence of abuse
 
04:38:39.349 --> 04:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
if i found abuse by mr
 
04:38:40.709 --> 04:38:40.719 align:start position:0%
it would do little to alter my
 
04:38:42.789 --> 04:38:42.799 align:start position:0%
obligation to reunite him with the child
 
04:38:44.789 --> 04:38:44.799 align:start position:0%
after he addressed his abusive behaviors
 
04:38:46.709 --> 04:38:46.719 align:start position:0%
in some way in an appropriate
 
04:38:48.629 --> 04:38:48.639 align:start position:0%
therapeutic setting
 
04:38:53.990 --> 04:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
rsa 169 c19 and rsa 169 c23
 
04:38:56.709 --> 04:38:56.719 align:start position:0%
he's absolutely wrong on the law
 
04:38:59.830 --> 04:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
this you know a custody case is not a
 
04:39:03.029 --> 04:39:03.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:04.709 --> 04:39:04.719 align:start position:0%
and frankly he might as well have
 
04:39:06.551 --> 04:39:06.561 align:start position:0%
written i considered the idea of
 
04:39:08.470 --> 04:39:08.480 align:start position:0%
affording you due process but i decided
 
04:39:10.869 --> 04:39:10.879 align:start position:0%
against it i always mandate kids spend
 
04:39:14.070 --> 04:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
time with their abusive parents anyway
 
04:39:16.949 --> 04:39:16.959 align:start position:0%
his his entire judicial philosophy and
 
04:39:19.910 --> 04:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
mind you he was the only complex case
 
04:39:21.510 --> 04:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
docket judge for
 
04:39:25.429 --> 04:39:25.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:27.830 --> 04:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
it can it conflicts directly
 
04:39:27.840 --> 04:39:28.949 align:start position:0%
it can it conflicts directly
with

04:39:28.949 --> 04:39:28.959 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:39:32.390 --> 04:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
the factors of he has to identify abuse
 
04:39:34.629 --> 04:39:34.639 align:start position:0%
and how it's impacted the child
 
04:39:36.470 --> 04:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
on the relationship between the child
 
04:39:38.070 --> 04:39:38.080 align:start position:0%
and the abusing parent in making a
 
04:39:39.590 --> 04:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
custody decision
 
04:39:42.868 --> 04:39:42.878 align:start position:0%
that's rsa 461 a6
 
04:39:46.470 --> 04:39:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh roman numeral 1j
 
04:39:49.190 --> 04:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
excuse me miss burma are we still
 
04:39:52.390 --> 04:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
talking about house bill 577
 
04:39:52.400 --> 04:39:53.910 align:start position:0%
talking about house bill 577
yes

04:39:53.910 --> 04:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:39:54.868 --> 04:39:54.878 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:39:54.878 --> 04:39:55.590 align:start position:0%
thank you
so

04:39:55.590 --> 04:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:39:57.350 --> 04:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
you know i
 
04:39:58.788 --> 04:39:58.798 align:start position:0%
i don't think family court judges are
 
04:40:01.030 --> 04:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
well trained i i think
 
04:40:04.628 --> 04:40:04.638 align:start position:0%
sending a case to a superior court
 
04:40:06.310 --> 04:40:06.320 align:start position:0%
would be a much better thing to do in
 
04:40:09.190 --> 04:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
cases of abuse i i think it would be a
 
04:40:11.030 --> 04:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
good idea to amend the bill and also
 
04:40:12.788 --> 04:40:12.798 align:start position:0%
state that these people are entitled to
 
04:40:15.270 --> 04:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
a jury trial on the issue of abuse
 
04:40:17.430 --> 04:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
perhaps not the other issues identified
 
04:40:18.948 --> 04:40:18.958 align:start position:0%
in the divorce
 
04:40:18.958 --> 04:40:19.990 align:start position:0%
in the divorce
but

04:40:19.990 --> 04:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:40:21.830 --> 04:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
in particular now
 
04:40:23.830 --> 04:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
with the current
 
04:40:23.840 --> 04:40:25.270 align:start position:0%
with the current
um

04:40:25.270 --> 04:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:27.430 --> 04:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
system of the judges picking the gals
 
04:40:28.708 --> 04:40:28.718 align:start position:0%
and the judges
 
04:40:28.718 --> 04:40:29.590 align:start position:0%
and the judges
picking

04:40:29.590 --> 04:40:29.600 align:start position:0%
picking
 
04:40:29.600 --> 04:40:30.470 align:start position:0%
picking
these

04:40:30.470 --> 04:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
these
 
04:40:33.110 --> 04:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
alienation evaluators
 
04:40:35.430 --> 04:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
they're picking their own witnesses
 
04:40:38.310 --> 04:40:38.320 align:start position:0%
and i'd i don't think a superior court
 
04:40:39.670 --> 04:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
judge would do that or he would
 
04:40:42.070 --> 04:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
certainly be much less likely to
 
04:40:45.590 --> 04:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:47.830 --> 04:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
04:40:49.430 --> 04:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
it's been helpful
 
04:40:52.470 --> 04:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
04:40:54.868 --> 04:40:54.878 align:start position:0%
representative belanger will you take
 
04:40:58.948 --> 04:40:58.958 align:start position:0%
questions ms warma oh yes thank you
 
04:41:03.030 --> 04:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:05.670 --> 04:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
i have two yes ma'am thank you um
 
04:41:07.510 --> 04:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
i will ask one at a time and then follow
 
04:41:08.788 --> 04:41:08.798 align:start position:0%
up yes ma'am
 
04:41:08.798 --> 04:41:11.030 align:start position:0%
up yes ma'am
um

04:41:11.030 --> 04:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:13.110 --> 04:41:13.120 align:start position:0%
when you referred to judges picking
 
04:41:14.708 --> 04:41:14.718 align:start position:0%
gil's are you familiar with the
 
04:41:16.948 --> 04:41:16.958 align:start position:0%
situation that you can petition for your
 
04:41:18.628 --> 04:41:18.638 align:start position:0%
own gil you do not have to have it
 
04:41:21.110 --> 04:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
appointed by the court
 
04:41:22.948 --> 04:41:22.958 align:start position:0%
i am not aware of that
 
04:41:24.830 --> 04:41:24.840 align:start position:0%
and i have never seen it happen
 
04:41:27.990 --> 04:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
although the last case i involve i was
 
04:41:30.070 --> 04:41:30.080 align:start position:0%
involved with was the case in portsmouth
 
04:41:32.708 --> 04:41:32.718 align:start position:0%
and foley's and lemire's court
 
04:41:34.788 --> 04:41:34.798 align:start position:0%
and i actually had not
 
04:41:36.628 --> 04:41:36.638 align:start position:0%
done a custody case for years before
 
04:41:36.638 --> 04:41:37.510 align:start position:0%
done a custody case for years before
that

04:41:37.510 --> 04:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:41:37.520 --> 04:41:38.628 align:start position:0%
that
but

04:41:38.628 --> 04:41:38.638 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:41:40.868 --> 04:41:40.878 align:start position:0%
this case was an education for me
 
04:41:40.878 --> 04:41:42.788 align:start position:0%
this case was an education for me
re-education

04:41:42.788 --> 04:41:42.798 align:start position:0%
re-education
 
04:41:44.708 --> 04:41:44.718 align:start position:0%
follow-up madam chair
 
04:41:46.868 --> 04:41:46.878 align:start position:0%
and just for clarification i have a gal
 
04:41:48.708 --> 04:41:48.718 align:start position:0%
in my guardianship case that i asked to
 
04:41:50.310 --> 04:41:50.320 align:start position:0%
be appointed the judge
 
04:41:52.868 --> 04:41:52.878 align:start position:0%
uh did not appoint him um
 
04:41:55.350 --> 04:41:55.360 align:start position:0%
appoint the gal himself um when you
 
04:41:57.990 --> 04:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
refer to judges aren't trained in family
 
04:41:59.830 --> 04:41:59.840 align:start position:0%
court can you provide the data that you
 
04:42:02.230 --> 04:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
have on that
 
04:42:04.150 --> 04:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
well when they're making
 
04:42:06.070 --> 04:42:06.080 align:start position:0%
you know they're they're appointing
 
04:42:07.510 --> 04:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
these evaluators that they aren't
 
04:42:07.520 --> 04:42:09.190 align:start position:0%
these evaluators that they aren't
statutorily

04:42:09.190 --> 04:42:09.200 align:start position:0%
statutorily
 
04:42:14.788 --> 04:42:14.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:15.910 --> 04:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
and and
 
04:42:17.750 --> 04:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
you know the direct answer is no i don't
 
04:42:20.230 --> 04:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
have data because i did a right to know
 
04:42:22.868 --> 04:42:22.878 align:start position:0%
with the judicial system and they told
 
04:42:22.878 --> 04:42:23.830 align:start position:0%
with the judicial system and they told
me

04:42:23.830 --> 04:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
me
 
04:42:25.510 --> 04:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
that um
 
04:42:27.430 --> 04:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
i asked for a table of contents for
 
04:42:29.190 --> 04:42:29.200 align:start position:0%
judicial training for family law court
 
04:42:30.788 --> 04:42:30.798 align:start position:0%
judges and they declined to give it to
 
04:42:30.798 --> 04:42:31.670 align:start position:0%
judges and they declined to give it to
me

04:42:31.670 --> 04:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
me
 
04:42:34.310 --> 04:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
now i will say that i have not
 
04:42:37.110 --> 04:42:37.120 align:start position:0%
reissued that request for information
 
04:42:38.788 --> 04:42:38.798 align:start position:0%
since the new hampshire supreme court
 
04:42:38.798 --> 04:42:39.910 align:start position:0%
since the new hampshire supreme court
case

04:42:39.910 --> 04:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
case
 
04:42:42.070 --> 04:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
about the right to know law last year i
 
04:42:44.390 --> 04:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
think it was
 
04:42:46.390 --> 04:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
but but they refused to give me the name
 
04:42:48.868 --> 04:42:48.878 align:start position:0%
of the trainers any out any contract
 
04:42:51.190 --> 04:42:51.200 align:start position:0%
trainers they refuse to give me a table
 
04:42:52.788 --> 04:42:52.798 align:start position:0%
of contents of how they're trained they
 
04:42:54.788 --> 04:42:54.798 align:start position:0%
refuse to give me any any information on
 
04:42:56.948 --> 04:42:56.958 align:start position:0%
how judges are trained
 
04:42:59.430 --> 04:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
no more followers
 
04:43:01.670 --> 04:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions from

seeing none thank you miss worma
 
04:43:11.350 --> 04:43:11.360 align:start position:0%
and we have one more hand up uh

sorry about that i thought i clicked on
 
04:43:37.760 --> 04:43:45.670 align:start position:0%
sorry about that i thought i clicked on
it

04:43:47.670 --> 04:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
mr head let's try that again let's try
 
04:43:50.390 --> 04:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
that how's that
 
04:43:51.750 --> 04:43:51.760 align:start position:0%

had you know in terms of of background
 
04:44:17.110 --> 04:44:17.120 align:start position:0%
um as i think you heard before from ms
 
04:44:17.120 --> 04:44:18.390 align:start position:0%
um as i think you heard before from ms
justina

04:44:18.390 --> 04:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
justina
 
04:44:21.430 --> 04:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
the circuit court is made up of three
 
04:44:23.430 --> 04:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
divisions the family division district
 
04:44:25.590 --> 04:44:25.600 align:start position:0%
division and probate division and this
 
04:44:28.868 --> 04:44:28.878 align:start position:0%
occurred in 2011 when district courts
 
04:44:33.110 --> 04:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
were eliminated and uh and consolidated
 
04:44:34.948 --> 04:44:34.958 align:start position:0%
into the circuit division or a circuit
 
04:44:36.788 --> 04:44:36.798 align:start position:0%
court system
 
04:44:39.910 --> 04:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
and as you heard before there were in
 
04:44:41.750 --> 04:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
previously there was a system of marital
 
04:44:44.470 --> 04:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
masters that with the creation of the
 
04:44:46.628 --> 04:44:46.638 align:start position:0%
circuit court system
 
04:44:49.350 --> 04:44:49.360 align:start position:0%
have been have been fading so as marital
 
04:44:51.430 --> 04:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
masters retire they are not being
 
04:44:53.910 --> 04:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
replaced with marital masters but they
 
04:44:55.510 --> 04:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
are being replaced with circuit court
 
04:44:55.520 --> 04:44:57.270 align:start position:0%
are being replaced with circuit court
judges

04:44:57.270 --> 04:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
judges
 
04:44:58.470 --> 04:44:58.480 align:start position:0%
and as
 
04:45:01.270 --> 04:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
and i believe there are only two masters
 
04:45:03.830 --> 04:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
still in the system
 
04:45:05.750 --> 04:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
and as those two retire they will not be
 
04:45:07.670 --> 04:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
replaced with other masters but again
 
04:45:10.150 --> 04:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
with circuit court judges circuit court
 
04:45:11.510 --> 04:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
judges are
 
04:45:14.230 --> 04:45:14.240 align:start position:0%
incredibly busy they're incredibly
 
04:45:16.550 --> 04:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable of rules of evidence in
 
04:45:18.628 --> 04:45:18.638 align:start position:0%
rules of court
 
04:45:20.788 --> 04:45:20.798 align:start position:0%
and they do
 
04:45:22.868 --> 04:45:22.878 align:start position:0%
you know there are some that focus more
 
04:45:24.470 --> 04:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
obviously on family
 
04:45:28.310 --> 04:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
um and some do it uh i don't know if any
 
04:45:29.350 --> 04:45:29.360 align:start position:0%
of them i don't know how much we're
 
04:45:31.830 --> 04:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
doing exclusively but there is with the
 
04:45:33.670 --> 04:45:33.680 align:start position:0%
circuit court system
 
04:45:36.628 --> 04:45:36.638 align:start position:0%
um cross training and and in district
 
04:45:38.390 --> 04:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
division and
 
04:45:40.708 --> 04:45:40.718 align:start position:0%
family division types of cases
 
04:45:42.230 --> 04:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
so you have these
 
04:45:43.670 --> 04:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
very knowledgeable
 
04:45:46.470 --> 04:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
judges in
 
04:45:47.910 --> 04:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
evident rules of evidence rules of
 
04:45:47.920 --> 04:45:48.948 align:start position:0%
evident rules of evidence rules of
procedure

04:45:48.948 --> 04:45:48.958 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
04:45:51.430 --> 04:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
who are hearing cases both in the
 
04:45:53.350 --> 04:45:53.360 align:start position:0%
district division and in the family
 
04:45:53.360 --> 04:45:55.110 align:start position:0%
district division and in the family
division

04:45:55.110 --> 04:45:55.120 align:start position:0%
division
 
04:45:58.628 --> 04:45:58.638 align:start position:0%
when domestic and just rough numbers um
 
04:46:00.788 --> 04:46:00.798 align:start position:0%
family court family division
 
04:46:04.868 --> 04:46:04.878 align:start position:0%
in 2020 had about 15 000 cases
 
04:46:10.470 --> 04:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
of those about 3 600 had some 36 3 700
 
04:46:12.550 --> 04:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
of those had some allegations of
 
04:46:15.510 --> 04:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
domestic violence um involving the
 
04:46:16.948 --> 04:46:16.958 align:start position:0%
involved in the case
 
04:46:19.110 --> 04:46:19.120 align:start position:0%
and these are these are not criminal
 
04:46:22.150 --> 04:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
cases um so unlike
 
04:46:24.150 --> 04:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
as the sponsor said and i get
 
04:46:25.670 --> 04:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
what she was saying
 
04:46:27.670 --> 04:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
when representative gay was saying that
 
04:46:29.510 --> 04:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
in superior court
 
04:46:31.910 --> 04:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
the you know when it's not a family
 
04:46:33.910 --> 04:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
member involved they're in superior
 
04:46:36.868 --> 04:46:36.878 align:start position:0%
court and they're being
 
04:46:38.628 --> 04:46:38.638 align:start position:0%
charged criminally
 
04:46:41.030 --> 04:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
family court is not a criminal court it
 
04:46:43.270 --> 04:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
is a family court and it's governed by
 
04:46:45.750 --> 04:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
the rules and the statutes that govern
 
04:46:48.150 --> 04:46:48.160 align:start position:0%
family uh
 
04:46:50.150 --> 04:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
parenting divorce whatever the issues
 
04:46:51.350 --> 04:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
may be
 
04:46:54.150 --> 04:46:54.160 align:start position:0%
that would not change if it's filed in
 
04:46:55.750 --> 04:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
superior court
 
04:46:57.750 --> 04:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
the same rules apply the same statutes
 
04:47:00.470 --> 04:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
apply the same
 
04:47:02.470 --> 04:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
procedures would apply
 
04:47:05.670 --> 04:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
um so simply moving it to superior court
 
04:47:07.430 --> 04:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
is the only the only impact is that
 
04:47:09.430 --> 04:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
you're moving it to judges who do not
 
04:47:11.670 --> 04:47:11.680 align:start position:0%
hear these types of cases every day
 
04:47:14.470 --> 04:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
do not have the depth of knowledge of
 
04:47:16.550 --> 04:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
family practice and procedure
 
04:47:19.110 --> 04:47:19.120 align:start position:0%
and it's a very complicated area of law
 
04:47:21.590 --> 04:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
so you you would not have that level of
 
04:47:21.600 --> 04:47:23.350 align:start position:0%
so you you would not have that level of
experience

04:47:23.350 --> 04:47:23.360 align:start position:0%
experience
 
04:47:25.430 --> 04:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
if you moved these into the superior
 
04:47:28.390 --> 04:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
court system and that's a significant
 
04:47:28.400 --> 04:47:29.430 align:start position:0%
court system and that's a significant
concern

04:47:29.430 --> 04:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
concern
 
04:47:31.430 --> 04:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
the other aspect of
 
04:47:33.190 --> 04:47:33.200 align:start position:0%
the bill itself
 
04:47:35.990 --> 04:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
which would be you know basically
 
04:47:38.070 --> 04:47:38.080 align:start position:0%
it's it really is fairly simple it
 
04:47:39.670 --> 04:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
simply says the case shall not be
 
04:47:41.590 --> 04:47:41.600 align:start position:0%
assigned to the complex case docket or
 
04:47:42.830 --> 04:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
high conflict
 
04:47:46.948 --> 04:47:46.958 align:start position:0%
docket that type of case assignment is
 
04:47:49.110 --> 04:47:49.120 align:start position:0%
you know essentially a court function of
 
04:47:50.948 --> 04:47:50.958 align:start position:0%
how do you allocate the resources and
 
04:47:53.030 --> 04:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
the very limited resources
 
04:47:55.110 --> 04:47:55.120 align:start position:0%
of the of the judicial branch in terms
 
04:47:57.510 --> 04:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
of hearing what are in fact
 
04:47:58.470 --> 04:47:58.480 align:start position:0%
you know they tend to be more
 
04:48:00.948 --> 04:48:00.958 align:start position:0%
complicated cases they tend to have more
 
04:48:03.750 --> 04:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
issues they tend to
 
04:48:06.628 --> 04:48:06.638 align:start position:0%
involve a great deal more time and in
 
04:48:09.350 --> 04:48:09.360 align:start position:0%
the just sort of efficient management as
 
04:48:11.590 --> 04:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
efficient as we can be the efficient
 
04:48:13.670 --> 04:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
management of cases
 
04:48:18.070 --> 04:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
um those are are allocated within you
 
04:48:21.430 --> 04:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
know the family division uh the regular
 
04:48:23.110 --> 04:48:23.120 align:start position:0%
the sort of regular track and then the
 
04:48:26.470 --> 04:48:26.480 align:start position:0%
complex track in order to sort of keep
 
04:48:29.590 --> 04:48:29.600 align:start position:0%
the more complex cases from
 
04:48:32.230 --> 04:48:32.240 align:start position:0%
slowing down all of the other cases
 
04:48:34.708 --> 04:48:34.718 align:start position:0%
uh in in sort of an essential management
 
04:48:37.030 --> 04:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
tool that the circuit court has
 
04:48:37.040 --> 04:48:38.550 align:start position:0%
tool that the circuit court has
developed

04:48:38.550 --> 04:48:38.560 align:start position:0%
developed
 
04:48:40.628 --> 04:48:40.638 align:start position:0%
and also as you heard um
 
04:48:42.948 --> 04:48:42.958 align:start position:0%
from from ms justina our attorney
 
04:48:45.030 --> 04:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
justina this is not
 
04:48:47.510 --> 04:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
um current it's no longer a single
 
04:48:50.310 --> 04:48:50.320 align:start position:0%
statewide um but it is regionalized and
 
04:48:51.910 --> 04:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
mostly within you know the various
 
04:48:53.990 --> 04:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
circuit courts
 
04:48:56.310 --> 04:48:56.320 align:start position:0%
and there's essentially it's assigned to
 
04:48:58.070 --> 04:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
a more
 
04:49:00.708 --> 04:49:00.718 align:start position:0%
seasoned and experienced judge
 
04:49:03.430 --> 04:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
uh in these areas so the you know those
 
04:49:06.230 --> 04:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
essential functions of the management of
 
04:49:09.030 --> 04:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
the court docket are
 
04:49:09.040 --> 04:49:10.310 align:start position:0%
the court docket are
uh

04:49:10.310 --> 04:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:49:12.550 --> 04:49:12.560 align:start position:0%
are why we have an administrative judge
 
04:49:14.868 --> 04:49:14.878 align:start position:0%
and why judge king is is
 
04:49:17.430 --> 04:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
you know works very hard in terms of
 
04:49:21.190 --> 04:49:21.200 align:start position:0%
managing how these dockets work
 
04:49:23.670 --> 04:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
and then the the bill also says the case
 
04:49:25.510 --> 04:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
is criminal and shall be assigned to the
 
04:49:28.550 --> 04:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
circuit um court district division or
 
04:49:31.110 --> 04:49:31.120 align:start position:0%
superior court and in fact these are
 
04:49:34.310 --> 04:49:34.320 align:start position:0%
marital cases they're not criminal cases
 
04:49:36.390 --> 04:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
um so criminal cases are brought by
 
04:49:38.628 --> 04:49:38.638 align:start position:0%
prosecutors and i and i understand and i
 
04:49:40.550 --> 04:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
get the issue of whether or not
 
04:49:42.628 --> 04:49:42.638 align:start position:0%
prosecutors are filing these
 
04:49:46.390 --> 04:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
uh or police are charging but these are
 
04:49:46.400 --> 04:49:47.510 align:start position:0%
uh or police are charging but these are
family

04:49:47.510 --> 04:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
family
 
04:49:49.510 --> 04:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
and and marital matters
 
04:49:51.750 --> 04:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
they are not criminal matters held to a
 
04:49:53.590 --> 04:49:53.600 align:start position:0%
criminal standard of proof
 
04:49:55.910 --> 04:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
where somebody is going to go to prison
 
04:49:58.070 --> 04:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
or have a criminal penalty at the end of
 
04:49:59.190 --> 04:49:59.200 align:start position:0%
the day
 
04:50:00.948 --> 04:50:00.958 align:start position:0%
these are these are marital cases that
 
04:50:03.270 --> 04:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
are governed by the by the statutes and
 
04:50:05.990 --> 04:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
the rules um of the court the statutes
 
04:50:09.270 --> 04:50:09.280 align:start position:0%
that you all have laid out relative to
 
04:50:11.270 --> 04:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
parenting divorce
 
04:50:11.280 --> 04:50:12.230 align:start position:0%
parenting divorce
um

04:50:12.230 --> 04:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:12.240 --> 04:50:13.190 align:start position:0%
um
and

04:50:13.190 --> 04:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:50:15.990 --> 04:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh and reunification so
 
04:50:17.990 --> 04:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
i don't think this would accomplish what
 
04:50:21.030 --> 04:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
the sponsor wants um and in fact would
 
04:50:23.750 --> 04:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
be substantially detrimental to those
 
04:50:25.350 --> 04:50:25.360 align:start position:0%
cases because
 
04:50:28.150 --> 04:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
um they would be moved into
 
04:50:30.150 --> 04:50:30.160 align:start position:0%
if it stays within the district division
 
04:50:30.160 --> 04:50:31.190 align:start position:0%
if it stays within the district division
essentially

04:50:31.190 --> 04:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
04:50:32.788 --> 04:50:32.798 align:start position:0%
the same judges
 
04:50:35.270 --> 04:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
um and two it's moved into the superior
 
04:50:37.990 --> 04:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
court you are talking about a a system
 
04:50:40.390 --> 04:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
that does not have
 
04:50:41.990 --> 04:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
you know the same number of judges the
 
04:50:44.550 --> 04:50:44.560 align:start position:0%
same experience in in marital matters
 
04:50:47.830 --> 04:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
and would ultimately
 
04:50:50.230 --> 04:50:50.240 align:start position:0%
create significant management problems
 
04:50:53.590 --> 04:50:53.600 align:start position:0%
both in the docket but also in
 
04:50:55.670 --> 04:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
04:50:58.470 --> 04:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
the the outcome of these cases
 
04:51:00.390 --> 04:51:00.400 align:start position:0%
so i do think while it may be well
 
04:51:03.030 --> 04:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
intended uh and i appreciate that i
 
04:51:04.310 --> 04:51:04.320 align:start position:0%
think the the
 
04:51:06.230 --> 04:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
the bill itself creates
 
04:51:08.868 --> 04:51:08.878 align:start position:0%
significant issues and concerns relative
 
04:51:08.878 --> 04:51:10.070 align:start position:0%
significant issues and concerns relative
to

04:51:10.070 --> 04:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:51:13.510 --> 04:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:15.990 --> 04:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
you're really implementing a docketing
 
04:51:18.868 --> 04:51:18.878 align:start position:0%
system for the for the court which
 
04:51:20.868 --> 04:51:20.878 align:start position:0%
which it's doing to
 
04:51:24.230 --> 04:51:24.240 align:start position:0%
to manage a very heavy caseload
 
04:51:27.270 --> 04:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
of of these types of cases
 
04:51:27.280 --> 04:51:30.788 align:start position:0%
of of these types of cases
um

04:51:30.788 --> 04:51:30.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:30.798 --> 04:51:31.670 align:start position:0%
 
the

04:51:31.670 --> 04:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:51:33.910 --> 04:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
again i guess i'll i'll rest with that
 
04:51:35.030 --> 04:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
and i'll be happy to answer any
 
04:51:36.550 --> 04:51:36.560 align:start position:0%
questions thank you
 
04:51:39.110 --> 04:51:39.120 align:start position:0%

yeah um and answering all of our
questions

04:51:59.110 --> 04:51:59.120 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:52:00.150 --> 04:52:00.160 align:start position:0%
i want to
 
04:52:02.070 --> 04:52:02.080 align:start position:0%
i want to go back and ask i have two
 
04:52:03.670 --> 04:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
questions for you one is could you
 
04:52:03.680 --> 04:52:04.868 align:start position:0%
questions for you one is could you
clarify

04:52:04.868 --> 04:52:04.878 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
04:52:06.628 --> 04:52:06.638 align:start position:0%
you just mentioned
 
04:52:12.070 --> 04:52:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:16.270 --> 04:52:16.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:16.280 --> 04:52:17.910 align:start position:0%
 
identified

04:52:17.910 --> 04:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
identified
 
04:52:21.110 --> 04:52:21.120 align:start position:0%
in a court proceeding then
 
04:52:22.948 --> 04:52:22.958 align:start position:0%
instead of the
 
04:52:25.270 --> 04:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
what this bill seeks to do instead of
 
04:52:28.628 --> 04:52:28.638 align:start position:0%
the referring it to a different docket
 
04:52:30.070 --> 04:52:30.080 align:start position:0%
it would require this bill would
 
04:52:33.270 --> 04:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
actually require that it be referred to
 
04:52:35.430 --> 04:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
county prosecutor county attorneys for
 
04:52:35.440 --> 04:52:37.510 align:start position:0%
county prosecutor county attorneys for
prosecution

04:52:37.510 --> 04:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
prosecution
 
04:52:39.510 --> 04:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
to draw up charges is that what you're
 
04:52:39.520 --> 04:52:40.788 align:start position:0%
to draw up charges is that what you're
saying

04:52:40.788 --> 04:52:40.798 align:start position:0%
saying
 
04:52:43.270 --> 04:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
no i thank you for the question so i
 
04:52:45.510 --> 04:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate that because i obviously was
 
04:52:46.948 --> 04:52:46.958 align:start position:0%
not clear
 
04:52:49.670 --> 04:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
what what i'm saying is that
 
04:52:49.680 --> 04:52:51.190 align:start position:0%
what what i'm saying is that
um

04:52:51.190 --> 04:52:51.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:52:53.110 --> 04:52:53.120 align:start position:0%
not every domestic violence case goes
 
04:52:53.120 --> 04:52:54.150 align:start position:0%
not every domestic violence case goes
into

04:52:54.150 --> 04:52:54.160 align:start position:0%
into
 
04:52:54.160 --> 04:52:55.110 align:start position:0%
into
the

04:52:55.110 --> 04:52:55.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:52:57.110 --> 04:52:57.120 align:start position:0%
complex case docket that is an element
 
04:52:58.550 --> 04:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
that is considered
 
04:53:00.708 --> 04:53:00.718 align:start position:0%
in the complex case docket assignments
 
04:53:03.270 --> 04:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
but not they don't all go there
 
04:53:06.070 --> 04:53:06.080 align:start position:0%
what i'm suggesting is that
 
04:53:09.030 --> 04:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
by virtue of of what this case is which
 
04:53:10.708 --> 04:53:10.718 align:start position:0%
is a family case
 
04:53:13.110 --> 04:53:13.120 align:start position:0%
it is not a criminal case as it is
 
04:53:15.510 --> 04:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
before that family court judge
 
04:53:18.390 --> 04:53:18.400 align:start position:0%
and that would not change if it is moved
 
04:53:20.230 --> 04:53:20.240 align:start position:0%
into the superior court it is still a
 
04:53:20.240 --> 04:53:21.670 align:start position:0%
into the superior court it is still a
family

04:53:21.670 --> 04:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
family
 
04:53:24.150 --> 04:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
court case it is still a family case and
 
04:53:27.270 --> 04:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
it is always going to be governed by
 
04:53:27.280 --> 04:53:28.230 align:start position:0%
it is always going to be governed by
um

04:53:28.230 --> 04:53:28.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:30.390 --> 04:53:30.400 align:start position:0%
by the by the family court
 
04:53:33.590 --> 04:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
or the family law statutes and rules
 
04:53:35.990 --> 04:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
what what i am saying is that
 
04:53:38.628 --> 04:53:38.638 align:start position:0%
these are not cases that are being filed
 
04:53:40.788 --> 04:53:40.798 align:start position:0%
by prosecutors
 
04:53:43.590 --> 04:53:43.600 align:start position:0%
or law enforcement these are cases being
 
04:53:46.390 --> 04:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
filed by private individuals involved in
 
04:53:50.788 --> 04:53:50.798 align:start position:0%
in family matters so if a prosecutor
 
04:53:52.470 --> 04:53:52.480 align:start position:0%
files the case
 
04:53:54.708 --> 04:53:54.718 align:start position:0%
as a criminal case which is what not
 
04:53:56.470 --> 04:53:56.480 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about here
 
04:53:59.190 --> 04:53:59.200 align:start position:0%
if a prosecutor files then depending on
 
04:54:00.948 --> 04:54:00.958 align:start position:0%
on the nature of that charge whether it
 
04:54:03.190 --> 04:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
be a misdemeanor or a felony
 
04:54:05.190 --> 04:54:05.200 align:start position:0%
it would be filed in either the district
 
04:54:06.948 --> 04:54:06.958 align:start position:0%
division or the superior court and
 
04:54:09.830 --> 04:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
handled as a criminal case
 
04:54:11.670 --> 04:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
and sometimes you can have a criminal
 
04:54:15.670 --> 04:54:15.680 align:start position:0%
case involving a party involved in a in
 
04:54:17.990 --> 04:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
a marital case
 
04:54:19.430 --> 04:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
so the
 
04:54:21.990 --> 04:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
the the claims are different the types
 
04:54:23.670 --> 04:54:23.680 align:start position:0%
of cases are different
 
04:54:25.750 --> 04:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
the burden of proof is different and the
 
04:54:25.760 --> 04:54:26.708 align:start position:0%
the burden of proof is different and the
outcome

04:54:26.708 --> 04:54:26.718 align:start position:0%
outcome
 
04:54:28.150 --> 04:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
is different these cases that we're
 
04:54:31.350 --> 04:54:31.360 align:start position:0%
talking about today are our family court
 
04:54:34.070 --> 04:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
in without regard to who what judge is
 
04:54:37.350 --> 04:54:37.360 align:start position:0%
deciding it the outcomes are family
 
04:54:39.590 --> 04:54:39.600 align:start position:0%
related outcomes they do not result in
 
04:54:41.750 --> 04:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
prison time they do not result in
 
04:54:43.750 --> 04:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
criminal penalties
 
04:54:46.628 --> 04:54:46.638 align:start position:0%
those are reserved for
 
04:54:49.430 --> 04:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
cases that are filed by prosecutors as
 
04:54:51.110 --> 04:54:51.120 align:start position:0%
criminal cases
 
04:54:52.550 --> 04:54:52.560 align:start position:0%
and that's not what we're talking about
 
04:54:52.560 --> 04:54:54.390 align:start position:0%
and that's not what we're talking about
here

04:54:54.390 --> 04:54:54.400 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:54:56.230 --> 04:54:56.240 align:start position:0%
may i follow up madam chair
 
04:54:59.510 --> 04:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
yes follow-up so mr head when there are
 
04:55:01.430 --> 04:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
criminal cases
 
04:55:01.440 --> 04:55:02.708 align:start position:0%
criminal cases
that

04:55:02.708 --> 04:55:02.718 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:55:05.590 --> 04:55:05.600 align:start position:0%
involve parties who are also
 
04:55:08.708 --> 04:55:08.718 align:start position:0%
subsequently concurrently
 
04:55:11.430 --> 04:55:11.440 align:start position:0%
in with a family court case
 
04:55:14.550 --> 04:55:14.560 align:start position:0%
does a criminal court case or finding
 
04:55:18.070 --> 04:55:18.080 align:start position:0%
inform the family court
 
04:55:20.390 --> 04:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
case it could yes
 
04:55:23.350 --> 04:55:23.360 align:start position:0%
it could okay and one last question
 
04:55:25.190 --> 04:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
madam chair if i might
 
04:55:29.190 --> 04:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
sure um in a family court case if there
 
04:55:30.310 --> 04:55:30.320 align:start position:0%
is no
 
04:55:34.310 --> 04:55:34.320 align:start position:0%
if a parties are involved in a just
 
04:55:36.948 --> 04:55:36.958 align:start position:0%
strictly a family court case
 
04:55:41.430 --> 04:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
and there are allegations of domestic
 
04:55:44.948 --> 04:55:44.958 align:start position:0%
violence that don't rise to the level of
 
04:55:47.910 --> 04:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
what our statutes have
 
04:55:51.270 --> 04:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
at what our laws have as a criminal
 
04:55:51.280 --> 04:55:52.788 align:start position:0%
at what our laws have as a criminal
prosecution

04:55:52.788 --> 04:55:52.798 align:start position:0%
prosecution
 
04:55:55.430 --> 04:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
within the family court structure
 
04:55:55.440 --> 04:55:56.230 align:start position:0%
within the family court structure
is

04:55:56.230 --> 04:55:56.240 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:55:57.580 --> 04:55:57.590 align:start position:0%
the um
 
04:55:57.590 --> 04:55:59.110 align:start position:0%
the um
[Music]

04:55:59.110 --> 04:55:59.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:56:02.230 --> 04:56:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:04.550 --> 04:56:04.560 align:start position:0%
the um what is the word i'm looking for
 
04:56:06.708 --> 04:56:06.718 align:start position:0%
do we not have to just rise to the
 
04:56:09.350 --> 04:56:09.360 align:start position:0%
preponderance of the evidence versus
 
04:56:11.990 --> 04:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
clear and convincing
 
04:56:14.470 --> 04:56:14.480 align:start position:0%
yep the beyond reasonable doubt and and
 
04:56:16.550 --> 04:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
clear and convincing are all the higher
 
04:56:18.708 --> 04:56:18.718 align:start position:0%
standards that a criminal court and
 
04:56:18.718 --> 04:56:19.830 align:start position:0%
standards that a criminal court and
sometimes

04:56:19.830 --> 04:56:19.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
04:56:21.910 --> 04:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
that's why you may not see a criminal
 
04:56:24.070 --> 04:56:24.080 align:start position:0%
case filed
 
04:56:25.830 --> 04:56:25.840 align:start position:0%
because the prosecutor may have reviewed
 
04:56:27.990 --> 04:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
the evidence and for whatever reason
 
04:56:30.150 --> 04:56:30.160 align:start position:0%
decided that at that very high level of
 
04:56:31.830 --> 04:56:31.840 align:start position:0%
proof um
 
04:56:35.030 --> 04:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
whether it be the the victim or
 
04:56:36.948 --> 04:56:36.958 align:start position:0%
the way the the victim didn't want to
 
04:56:39.350 --> 04:56:39.360 align:start position:0%
pursue a criminal case even though it it
 
04:56:41.910 --> 04:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
may be an element in the family case
 
04:56:41.920 --> 04:56:43.110 align:start position:0%
may be an element in the family case
um

04:56:43.110 --> 04:56:43.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:44.708 --> 04:56:44.718 align:start position:0%
there are a whole host of reasons why
 
04:56:46.470 --> 04:56:46.480 align:start position:0%
but there is a different burden of proof
 
04:56:48.550 --> 04:56:48.560 align:start position:0%
and a much higher burden of proof
 
04:56:50.788 --> 04:56:50.798 align:start position:0%
on a prosecutor in a criminal case than
 
04:56:53.030 --> 04:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
what you see
 
04:56:56.470 --> 04:56:56.480 align:start position:0%
before in a in a family law case
 
04:56:58.150 --> 04:56:58.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for the clarification thank
 
04:56:58.160 --> 04:56:59.350 align:start position:0%
thank you for the clarification thank
you

04:56:59.350 --> 04:56:59.360 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:57:01.590 --> 04:57:01.600 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative yo kelly you
 
04:57:04.470 --> 04:57:04.480 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
04:57:06.788 --> 04:57:06.798 align:start position:0%
yes thank you uh thank you for taking
 
04:57:08.948 --> 04:57:08.958 align:start position:0%
the question um a previous speaker
 
04:57:11.990 --> 04:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
talked about um the training for
 
04:57:13.510 --> 04:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
family court
 
04:57:17.270 --> 04:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
judges and would you be able to
 
04:57:19.830 --> 04:57:19.840 align:start position:0%
send the committee some
 
04:57:19.840 --> 04:57:21.270 align:start position:0%
send the committee some
uh

04:57:21.270 --> 04:57:21.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:57:24.390 --> 04:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
information on what what trainings the
 
04:57:27.670 --> 04:57:27.680 align:start position:0%
uh family courts have
 
04:57:30.150 --> 04:57:30.160 align:start position:0%
um i'll see i'll i'm happy to ask judge
 
04:57:33.110 --> 04:57:33.120 align:start position:0%
king his uh and i i'll i'll follow up
 
04:57:35.430 --> 04:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
with him uh he had as you may have seen
 
04:57:37.270 --> 04:57:37.280 align:start position:0%
in the paper death in the family
 
04:57:40.310 --> 04:57:40.320 align:start position:0%
um so he's not here today but um i will
 
04:57:42.628 --> 04:57:42.638 align:start position:0%
i'll follow up with him and let you know
 
04:57:43.990 --> 04:57:44.000 align:start position:0%
i don't know i i just don't know what's
 
04:57:45.830 --> 04:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
available so i'm not trying to avoid the
 
04:57:47.190 --> 04:57:47.200 align:start position:0%
question i just don't know what he has
 
04:57:48.390 --> 04:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
that would be available for me to give
 
04:57:53.190 --> 04:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:56.310 --> 04:57:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:59.030 --> 04:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
i have one more question representative
 
04:57:59.040 --> 04:58:01.990 align:start position:0%
i have one more question representative
long

04:58:01.990 --> 04:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:04.070 --> 04:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh yeah thank you
 
04:58:06.390 --> 04:58:06.400 align:start position:0%
mr head i could
 
04:58:08.070 --> 04:58:08.080 align:start position:0%
could you give me a little bit of a
 
04:58:11.110 --> 04:58:11.120 align:start position:0%
experience with respect to
 
04:58:12.230 --> 04:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
pro se
 
04:58:14.390 --> 04:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
litigants i you know a lot of these
 
04:58:16.230 --> 04:58:16.240 align:start position:0%
bills i'm looking at this one this one
 
04:58:17.830 --> 04:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
also is
 
04:58:20.230 --> 04:58:20.240 align:start position:0%
you know for the low to moderate income
 
04:58:23.830 --> 04:58:23.840 align:start position:0%
person who cannot afford attorneys
 
04:58:26.948 --> 04:58:26.958 align:start position:0%
how how would this affect their
 
04:58:26.958 --> 04:58:28.470 align:start position:0%
how how would this affect their
um

04:58:28.470 --> 04:58:28.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:30.550 --> 04:58:30.560 align:start position:0%
you know and this is on both sides the
 
04:58:33.510 --> 04:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
one accused and the one accusing um if
 
04:58:35.270 --> 04:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
neither one of them have the uh
 
04:58:37.030 --> 04:58:37.040 align:start position:0%
wherewithal to pay for some of this
 
04:58:39.910 --> 04:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
stuff how does this affect
 
04:58:43.670 --> 04:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
how does this affect their case
 
04:58:43.680 --> 04:58:44.868 align:start position:0%
how does this affect their case
i

04:58:44.868 --> 04:58:44.878 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:58:47.750 --> 04:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm not sure it would in the
 
04:58:50.150 --> 04:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
sense as i said before
 
04:58:52.470 --> 04:58:52.480 align:start position:0%
you no matter who the judge is and what
 
04:58:54.230 --> 04:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
the building is you're walking into
 
04:58:55.830 --> 04:58:55.840 align:start position:0%
whether it be a superior court building
 
04:58:57.910 --> 04:58:57.920 align:start position:0%
or a circuit court building
 
04:58:57.920 --> 04:58:58.788 align:start position:0%
or a circuit court building
um

04:58:58.788 --> 04:58:58.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:58.798 --> 04:58:59.910 align:start position:0%
um
the

04:58:59.910 --> 04:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:59:03.430 --> 04:59:03.440 align:start position:0%
the rules are the same you have fewer
 
04:59:06.470 --> 04:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
superior court judges so you you may
 
04:59:08.390 --> 04:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
have a greater backup
 
04:59:11.910 --> 04:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
in in circuit court to be more direct
 
04:59:14.550 --> 04:59:14.560 align:start position:0%
the vast vast majority of people are
 
04:59:14.560 --> 04:59:15.990 align:start position:0%
the vast vast majority of people are
unrepresented

04:59:15.990 --> 04:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
unrepresented
 
04:59:18.310 --> 04:59:18.320 align:start position:0%
um you have relatively
 
04:59:20.150 --> 04:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
in terms of the total you you certainly
 
04:59:23.030 --> 04:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
have judge or lawyers in in the circuit
 
04:59:27.990 --> 04:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
court um but there is a huge percentage
 
04:59:30.550 --> 04:59:30.560 align:start position:0%
of of parties in circuit court who are
 
04:59:30.560 --> 04:59:32.150 align:start position:0%
of of parties in circuit court who are
unrepresented

04:59:32.150 --> 04:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
unrepresented
 
04:59:32.160 --> 04:59:33.910 align:start position:0%
unrepresented
um

04:59:33.910 --> 04:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:33.920 --> 04:59:35.430 align:start position:0%
um
and

04:59:35.430 --> 04:59:35.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:59:36.628 --> 04:59:36.638 align:start position:0%
you know i think
 
04:59:36.638 --> 04:59:39.270 align:start position:0%
you know i think
by

04:59:39.270 --> 04:59:39.280 align:start position:0%
by
 
04:59:41.430 --> 04:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
moving it into superior court is just
 
04:59:43.510 --> 04:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
physically different it feels different
 
04:59:45.830 --> 04:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
i think it may be more intimidating
 
04:59:45.840 --> 04:59:47.510 align:start position:0%
i think it may be more intimidating
um

04:59:47.510 --> 04:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:49.510 --> 04:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
but it's also hard for me to just to
 
04:59:50.390 --> 04:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
really know that because i've been
 
04:59:53.190 --> 04:59:53.200 align:start position:0%
practicing for 30 years so it's it's
 
04:59:55.510 --> 04:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
more familiar to me but i think
 
04:59:57.910 --> 04:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
that atmosphere is certainly different
 
05:00:00.230 --> 05:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
than the circuit court and i think the
 
05:00:02.390 --> 05:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
circuit court is
 
05:00:05.670 --> 05:00:05.680 align:start position:0%
better has greater experience
 
05:00:05.680 --> 05:00:06.470 align:start position:0%
better has greater experience
uh

05:00:06.470 --> 05:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:00:08.390 --> 05:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
in dealing with
 
05:00:10.470 --> 05:00:10.480 align:start position:0%
pro se parties i think you just see a
 
05:00:12.390 --> 05:00:12.400 align:start position:0%
greater percentage of pro se parties in
 
05:00:13.750 --> 05:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
circuit court
 
05:00:16.070 --> 05:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
where the the clerks are more familiar
 
05:00:18.550 --> 05:00:18.560 align:start position:0%
with that environment the judges are
 
05:00:20.628 --> 05:00:20.638 align:start position:0%
more familiar
 
05:00:23.910 --> 05:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
and as i said before this subject matter
 
05:00:23.920 --> 05:00:24.868 align:start position:0%
and as i said before this subject matter
is

05:00:24.868 --> 05:00:24.878 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:00:26.868 --> 05:00:26.878 align:start position:0%
is a circuit court subject matter not a
 
05:00:28.550 --> 05:00:28.560 align:start position:0%
spirit court subject matter so i think
 
05:00:30.310 --> 05:00:30.320 align:start position:0%
you would you would have greater
 
05:00:30.320 --> 05:00:31.750 align:start position:0%
you would you would have greater
difficulty

05:00:31.750 --> 05:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
difficulty
 
05:00:35.030 --> 05:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
with pro se parties in a superior court
 
05:00:35.040 --> 05:00:35.990 align:start position:0%
with pro se parties in a superior court
setting

05:00:35.990 --> 05:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
setting
 
05:00:38.070 --> 05:00:38.080 align:start position:0%
but i i that's that's my personal view i
 
05:00:39.670 --> 05:00:39.680 align:start position:0%
don't have any
 
05:00:41.830 --> 05:00:41.840 align:start position:0%
any evidence of that okay so a quick
 
05:00:44.070 --> 05:00:44.080 align:start position:0%
follow for me uh madam chair
 
05:00:47.270 --> 05:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
yes a quick one the um
 
05:00:49.510 --> 05:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
yeah so i've heard from constituents who
 
05:00:51.670 --> 05:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
have said that in circuit court the
 
05:00:53.910 --> 05:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
clerks do help out quite a bit
 
05:00:55.350 --> 05:00:55.360 align:start position:0%
um so
 
05:00:57.750 --> 05:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
i'm hearing that in superior court that
 
05:01:01.590 --> 05:01:01.600 align:start position:0%
luxury may be less of
 
05:01:01.600 --> 05:01:02.470 align:start position:0%
luxury may be less of
less

05:01:02.470 --> 05:01:02.480 align:start position:0%
less
 
05:01:02.480 --> 05:01:03.590 align:start position:0%
less
have

05:01:03.590 --> 05:01:03.600 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:01:03.600 --> 05:01:04.550 align:start position:0%
have
less

05:01:04.550 --> 05:01:04.560 align:start position:0%
less
 
05:01:05.910 --> 05:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
to happen
 
05:01:07.990 --> 05:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
i think not by any fault of anybody but
 
05:01:10.070 --> 05:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
i think the experience level is much
 
05:01:11.830 --> 05:01:11.840 align:start position:0%
different in spirit court than circuit
 
05:01:15.110 --> 05:01:15.120 align:start position:0%
court given sort of the the volume of
 
05:01:16.788 --> 05:01:16.798 align:start position:0%
cases and
 
05:01:19.510 --> 05:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
the numbers that are represented by
 
05:01:21.270 --> 05:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
lawyers and those that are not and i
 
05:01:23.030 --> 05:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
think it's just a more
 
05:01:25.030 --> 05:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
familiar experience for the for the
 
05:01:27.670 --> 05:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
clerks and staff in the circuit courts
 
05:01:29.910 --> 05:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
um than you see in superior court and
 
05:01:30.948 --> 05:01:30.958 align:start position:0%
and again
 
05:01:33.430 --> 05:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
it it comes in part down to
 
05:01:35.430 --> 05:01:35.440 align:start position:0%
just sheer volume
 
05:01:36.788 --> 05:01:36.798 align:start position:0%
very good thank you
 
05:01:39.030 --> 05:01:39.040 align:start position:0%

05:01:40.868 --> 05:01:40.878 align:start position:0%

so with that we'll open
 
05:02:26.310 --> 05:02:26.320 align:start position:0%
the hearing on house bill 548 with
 
05:02:27.990 --> 05:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
05:02:32.070 --> 05:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:33.510 --> 05:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:02:35.590 --> 05:02:35.600 align:start position:0%
and i really appreciate you giving
 
05:02:38.628 --> 05:02:38.638 align:start position:0%
people time to to testify it's
 
05:02:40.948 --> 05:02:40.958 align:start position:0%
nerve-racking as we all know
 
05:02:45.430 --> 05:02:45.440 align:start position:0%
um okay this is on 548 and the gist of
 
05:02:48.390 --> 05:02:48.400 align:start position:0%
it is when a guardian ad litem is
 
05:02:51.510 --> 05:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
appointed to a parenting case in which
 
05:02:53.990 --> 05:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
domestic violence is suspected or
 
05:02:56.230 --> 05:02:56.240 align:start position:0%
alleged the guardian at lydem shall
 
05:02:58.948 --> 05:02:58.958 align:start position:0%
promptly refer the relevant party to a
 
05:03:01.910 --> 05:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
local crisis center or assessment by a
 
05:03:04.230 --> 05:03:04.240 align:start position:0%
domestic violence counselor as defined
 
05:03:09.190 --> 05:03:09.200 align:start position:0%
in rsa 173 c1 roman numeral 3
 
05:03:11.830 --> 05:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
and in appropriate cases comply with
 
05:03:13.990 --> 05:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
mandatory reporting requirements for
 
05:03:19.350 --> 05:03:19.360 align:start position:0%
child abuse under rsa 169 c 29
 
05:03:22.070 --> 05:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
the guardian item shall also determine
 
05:03:24.310 --> 05:03:24.320 align:start position:0%
whether law enforcement completed a
 
05:03:27.750 --> 05:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
lethality assessment protocol regarding
 
05:03:31.270 --> 05:03:31.280 align:start position:0%
any party to the proceeding
 
05:03:34.230 --> 05:03:34.240 align:start position:0%
when i've talked about this before
 
05:03:37.670 --> 05:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
i was told that uh it wasn't fair to
 
05:03:41.830 --> 05:03:41.840 align:start position:0%
to uh refer a party a demand a victim of
 
05:03:44.150 --> 05:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
domestic violence it wasn't a good idea
 
05:03:48.390 --> 05:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
to refer them to a domestic um
 
05:03:50.788 --> 05:03:50.798 align:start position:0%
uh crisis center
 
05:03:53.350 --> 05:03:53.360 align:start position:0%
and i'm thinking if they choose not to
 
05:03:53.360 --> 05:03:54.150 align:start position:0%
and i'm thinking if they choose not to
go

05:03:54.150 --> 05:03:54.160 align:start position:0%
go
 
05:03:55.910 --> 05:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
that's their choice
 
05:03:58.390 --> 05:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
this is not forcing them to go but this
 
05:04:00.628 --> 05:04:00.638 align:start position:0%
is where they're going to find people
 
05:04:03.110 --> 05:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
who know what the situation is who can
 
05:04:04.788 --> 05:04:04.798 align:start position:0%
advise them
 
05:04:06.788 --> 05:04:06.798 align:start position:0%
that's why they're there
 
05:04:09.830 --> 05:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
and uh so i'm i'm prepared for the same
 
05:04:12.470 --> 05:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
person to criticize that again
 
05:04:14.628 --> 05:04:14.638 align:start position:0%
and then the other somebody said they
 
05:04:16.868 --> 05:04:16.878 align:start position:0%
didn't like this idea about telling the
 
05:04:18.948 --> 05:04:18.958 align:start position:0%
guardian at lightham that they should be
 
05:04:21.190 --> 05:04:21.200 align:start position:0%
checking on the if there is any
 
05:04:23.590 --> 05:04:23.600 align:start position:0%
lethality assessments police are
 
05:04:25.750 --> 05:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
supposed to write up a lethality
 
05:04:28.230 --> 05:04:28.240 align:start position:0%
assessment when they go to uh
 
05:04:28.240 --> 05:04:29.350 align:start position:0%
assessment when they go to uh
domestic

05:04:29.350 --> 05:04:29.360 align:start position:0%
domestic
 
05:04:31.350 --> 05:04:31.360 align:start position:0%
disturbance but
 
05:04:33.750 --> 05:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that's not done very much
 
05:04:35.670 --> 05:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
perhaps if they started getting asked
 
05:04:38.470 --> 05:04:38.480 align:start position:0%
about it they would and certainly those
 
05:04:41.350 --> 05:04:41.360 align:start position:0%
who have done it the information is
 
05:04:41.360 --> 05:04:42.470 align:start position:0%
who have done it the information is
helpful

05:04:42.470 --> 05:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
05:04:42.480 --> 05:04:43.750 align:start position:0%
helpful
because

05:04:43.750 --> 05:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:04:45.590 --> 05:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
the people um
 
05:04:45.600 --> 05:04:46.948 align:start position:0%
the people um
it's

05:04:46.948 --> 05:04:46.958 align:start position:0%
it's
 
05:04:49.030 --> 05:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
one of the problems is
 
05:04:49.040 --> 05:04:49.830 align:start position:0%
one of the problems is
that

05:04:49.830 --> 05:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:04:52.788 --> 05:04:52.798 align:start position:0%
under this this mindset that has been
 
05:04:54.948 --> 05:04:54.958 align:start position:0%
imposed on courts that we're trying to
 
05:04:58.230 --> 05:04:58.240 align:start position:0%
overturn about alienating parents being
 
05:05:00.708 --> 05:05:00.718 align:start position:0%
alienating and
 
05:05:01.910 --> 05:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
is that
 
05:05:05.590 --> 05:05:05.600 align:start position:0%
the person who says there's violence or
 
05:05:07.270 --> 05:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
abuse going on
 
05:05:09.590 --> 05:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
is automatically suspect for making it
 
05:05:09.600 --> 05:05:10.628 align:start position:0%
is automatically suspect for making it
up

05:05:10.628 --> 05:05:10.638 align:start position:0%
up
 
05:05:12.708 --> 05:05:12.718 align:start position:0%
and so i was hoping
 
05:05:15.350 --> 05:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
but i that didn't work i was hoping that
 
05:05:17.910 --> 05:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
if they went to the crisis center got uh
 
05:05:17.920 --> 05:05:19.190 align:start position:0%
if they went to the crisis center got uh
interviewed

05:05:19.190 --> 05:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
interviewed
 
05:05:22.150 --> 05:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
assessed by a specialist domestic
 
05:05:24.070 --> 05:05:24.080 align:start position:0%
violence specialist they would have
 
05:05:27.590 --> 05:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
somebody a report to to cite
 
05:05:29.750 --> 05:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
but that's not the way our crisis
 
05:05:31.510 --> 05:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
centers are set up
 
05:05:33.350 --> 05:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
and i do appreciate representative
 
05:05:35.590 --> 05:05:35.600 align:start position:0%
altschiller trying to explain to me how
 
05:05:36.628 --> 05:05:36.638 align:start position:0%
the system
 
05:05:38.868 --> 05:05:38.878 align:start position:0%
how the system works because we know the
 
05:05:42.550 --> 05:05:42.560 align:start position:0%
crisis centers do a huge amount of good
 
05:05:42.560 --> 05:05:43.350 align:start position:0%
crisis centers do a huge amount of good
for

05:05:43.350 --> 05:05:43.360 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:05:46.868 --> 05:05:46.878 align:start position:0%
victims of abuse but they cannot testify
 
05:05:46.878 --> 05:05:47.830 align:start position:0%
victims of abuse but they cannot testify
so

05:05:47.830 --> 05:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:05:49.990 --> 05:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
uh i figured well the police are
 
05:05:52.150 --> 05:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
supposed to be writing these lethality
 
05:05:54.230 --> 05:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
assessments so at least the guardian at
 
05:05:56.230 --> 05:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
lightning could see if there are any
 
05:05:59.190 --> 05:05:59.200 align:start position:0%
because that would be useful
 
05:05:59.200 --> 05:06:00.628 align:start position:0%
because that would be useful
um

05:06:00.628 --> 05:06:00.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:01.910 --> 05:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
what's really
 
05:06:04.150 --> 05:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
disappointing to me is to find out that
 
05:06:05.910 --> 05:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire at least and i
 
05:06:08.230 --> 05:06:08.240 align:start position:0%
understand that in many
 
05:06:09.750 --> 05:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
it's standard practice around the
 
05:06:09.760 --> 05:06:11.190 align:start position:0%
it's standard practice around the
country

05:06:11.190 --> 05:06:11.200 align:start position:0%
country
 
05:06:13.830 --> 05:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
here you have guardian at lightums gals
 
05:06:13.840 --> 05:06:15.590 align:start position:0%
here you have guardian at lightums gals
gals

05:06:15.590 --> 05:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
gals
 
05:06:15.600 --> 05:06:17.430 align:start position:0%
gals
appointed

05:06:17.430 --> 05:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
appointed
 
05:06:18.868 --> 05:06:18.878 align:start position:0%
for and
 
05:06:21.030 --> 05:06:21.040 align:start position:0%
uh representative belanger was lucky if
 
05:06:23.030 --> 05:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
i understood him to say he did get to
 
05:06:25.830 --> 05:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
choose his guardian at lightham
 
05:06:28.628 --> 05:06:28.638 align:start position:0%
you can shake your head yes or no
 
05:06:31.110 --> 05:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
yes so that was great but all the people
 
05:06:33.670 --> 05:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
that i've met and have suffered terribly
 
05:06:36.390 --> 05:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
in court they didn't have a choice and
 
05:06:38.470 --> 05:06:38.480 align:start position:0%
the gal said oh
 
05:06:40.310 --> 05:06:40.320 align:start position:0%
you you've you've alleged there's
 
05:06:42.868 --> 05:06:42.878 align:start position:0%
domestic violence or domestic abuse so
 
05:06:45.190 --> 05:06:45.200 align:start position:0%
your children have to be
 
05:06:45.200 --> 05:06:46.070 align:start position:0%
your children have to be
uh

05:06:46.070 --> 05:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:06:48.788 --> 05:06:48.798 align:start position:0%
they have to go and have these sessions
 
05:06:50.310 --> 05:06:50.320 align:start position:0%
with the parent that they don't want to
 
05:06:51.750 --> 05:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
be with
 
05:06:53.750 --> 05:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
and yet we find out that here the gals
 
05:06:57.110 --> 05:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
have a tremendous responsibility and a
 
05:06:58.868 --> 05:06:58.878 align:start position:0%
lot of credibility
 
05:07:01.910 --> 05:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
with the judges who appoint them
 
05:07:03.910 --> 05:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
only they're not required to have any
 
05:07:07.030 --> 05:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
kind of psychological education
 
05:07:09.670 --> 05:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
and they darn sure don't have any legal
 
05:07:11.510 --> 05:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
training either they might have a
 
05:07:13.110 --> 05:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
smattering a couple of courses here and
 
05:07:15.750 --> 05:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
there but they are not psychologists and
 
05:07:19.670 --> 05:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
they are not attorneys and yet the child
 
05:07:23.110 --> 05:07:23.120 align:start position:0%
their the child's future depends upon
 
05:07:24.390 --> 05:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
these people
 
05:07:27.430 --> 05:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
so um some people would just really
 
05:07:30.470 --> 05:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh really like to do away with gals so
 
05:07:32.150 --> 05:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
maybe we ought to just make sure they
 
05:07:33.670 --> 05:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
have a lot more training than what they
 
05:07:36.070 --> 05:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
have now
 
05:07:37.750 --> 05:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
the child one of the things that's
 
05:07:39.830 --> 05:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
really upsetting to find out
 
05:07:41.990 --> 05:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
children are automatically assumed to be
 
05:07:44.868 --> 05:07:44.878 align:start position:0%
unbelievable they are not permitted to
 
05:07:44.878 --> 05:07:46.868 align:start position:0%
unbelievable they are not permitted to
speak

05:07:46.868 --> 05:07:46.878 align:start position:0%
speak
 
05:07:49.990 --> 05:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
so in a famous case in california the
 
05:07:51.990 --> 05:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
daughter of a famous wealthy attorney
 
05:07:53.830 --> 05:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
was forced to live with him they
 
05:07:55.510 --> 05:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
followed all those awful rules we've
 
05:07:57.350 --> 05:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
been talking about so they took her away
 
05:07:59.590 --> 05:07:59.600 align:start position:0%
from her protective parent and gave her
 
05:08:00.788 --> 05:08:00.798 align:start position:0%
to him
 
05:08:03.030 --> 05:08:03.040 align:start position:0%
despite all the allegations of abuse by
 
05:08:05.110 --> 05:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
both the daughter and the mother
 
05:08:08.390 --> 05:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
the girl's gal refused to report the
 
05:08:08.400 --> 05:08:10.788 align:start position:0%
the girl's gal refused to report the
abuse

05:08:10.788 --> 05:08:10.798 align:start position:0%
abuse
 
05:08:13.350 --> 05:08:13.360 align:start position:0%
after two years the girl was now she was
 
05:08:16.788 --> 05:08:16.798 align:start position:0%
11 when she was awarded to him after two
 
05:08:19.750 --> 05:08:19.760 align:start position:0%
years the girl was able to run away
 
05:08:21.910 --> 05:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
when she was picked up she was put in
 
05:08:25.110 --> 05:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
the juvenile section uh
 
05:08:28.948 --> 05:08:28.958 align:start position:0%
what do you call the juvenile legal
 
05:08:31.590 --> 05:08:31.600 align:start position:0%
a program for the state
 
05:08:36.868 --> 05:08:36.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:39.350 --> 05:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
and about the abuse
 
05:08:42.230 --> 05:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
and she was placed back with her mother
 
05:08:44.868 --> 05:08:44.878 align:start position:0%
and there is a fabulous article that she
 
05:08:44.878 --> 05:08:45.670 align:start position:0%
and there is a fabulous article that she
wrote

05:08:45.670 --> 05:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
wrote
 
05:08:47.430 --> 05:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
at the age of 16
 
05:08:49.430 --> 05:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
that is you would never guess it was a
 
05:08:51.590 --> 05:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
teenager who wrote it it was excellent
 
05:08:54.070 --> 05:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
and if i can find the the link i will
 
05:08:56.310 --> 05:08:56.320 align:start position:0%
include that in my testimony
 
05:08:59.350 --> 05:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
just yesterday i wish i could show you
 
05:09:00.628 --> 05:09:00.638 align:start position:0%
this but
 
05:09:02.948 --> 05:09:02.958 align:start position:0%
you know i'm not a panelist
 
05:09:05.110 --> 05:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
this is just published on the 2nd of
 
05:09:05.120 --> 05:09:05.990 align:start position:0%
this is just published on the 2nd of
march

05:09:05.990 --> 05:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
march
 
05:09:08.628 --> 05:09:08.638 align:start position:0%
31 missouri judges recused themselves
 
05:09:10.628 --> 05:09:10.638 align:start position:0%
from lawsuit alleging family court
 
05:09:13.190 --> 05:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
guardian and psychologist orchestrated
 
05:09:15.670 --> 05:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
money making scheme gee where did we
 
05:09:17.830 --> 05:09:17.840 align:start position:0%
hear about that before
 
05:09:21.110 --> 05:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
so it's just sad that our system allows
 
05:09:24.310 --> 05:09:24.320 align:start position:0%
very untrained people to be
 
05:09:24.320 --> 05:09:25.350 align:start position:0%
very untrained people to be
such

05:09:25.350 --> 05:09:25.360 align:start position:0%
such
 
05:09:25.360 --> 05:09:26.470 align:start position:0%
such
uh

05:09:26.470 --> 05:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:09:28.708 --> 05:09:28.718 align:start position:0%
to be such legally
 
05:09:31.990 --> 05:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
representing children who aren't ever
 
05:09:34.948 --> 05:09:34.958 align:start position:0%
allowed to testify or to be interviewed
 
05:09:37.430 --> 05:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
and have their testimony ordered the
 
05:09:40.550 --> 05:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
only the only persons who can speak on
 
05:09:42.628 --> 05:09:42.638 align:start position:0%
behalf of the child are the ones who are
 
05:09:45.110 --> 05:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
appointed by the judge
 
05:09:49.190 --> 05:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
so that just is totally needs to change
 
05:09:49.200 --> 05:09:50.550 align:start position:0%
so that just is totally needs to change
so

05:09:50.550 --> 05:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:09:52.948 --> 05:09:52.958 align:start position:0%
all i did in my bill all i could see
 
05:09:55.990 --> 05:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
that i could do was ask them to
 
05:09:58.550 --> 05:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
recommend that the victims
 
05:10:00.150 --> 05:10:00.160 align:start position:0%
the alleged victims
 
05:10:02.390 --> 05:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
they have to say alleged uh
 
05:10:04.628 --> 05:10:04.638 align:start position:0%
recommend that they go to place that is
 
05:10:06.868 --> 05:10:06.878 align:start position:0%
set up to help them
 
05:10:09.190 --> 05:10:09.200 align:start position:0%
and the other is to
 
05:10:12.230 --> 05:10:12.240 align:start position:0%
call the police find out wasn't a was a
 
05:10:16.310 --> 05:10:16.320 align:start position:0%

that
 
05:12:20.708 --> 05:12:20.718 align:start position:0%
have been brought to my attention where
 
05:12:22.948 --> 05:12:22.958 align:start position:0%
they weren't there's nothing that says
 
05:12:24.470 --> 05:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
they can't be
 
05:12:27.750 --> 05:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
and they are paid by the parents
 
05:12:29.910 --> 05:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
and one of the problems is
 
05:12:31.670 --> 05:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
in the cases that i've been made aware
 
05:12:34.470 --> 05:12:34.480 align:start position:0%

05:12:36.550 --> 05:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
they're representing the parent who's
 
05:12:37.990 --> 05:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
paying for them
 
05:12:39.510 --> 05:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
much more so than they are the
 
05:12:41.670 --> 05:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
children's best interests that doesn't
 
05:12:44.150 --> 05:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
mean that all of them are doing that
 
05:12:47.110 --> 05:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
it's just that that's what i'm trying to
 
05:12:52.628 --> 05:12:52.638 align:start position:0%

assistance
 
05:14:23.830 --> 05:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
i'm here today to testify in opposition
 
05:14:27.030 --> 05:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
to house bill 548
 
05:14:29.590 --> 05:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned previously
 
05:14:29.600 --> 05:14:30.550 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned previously
this

05:14:30.550 --> 05:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:14:32.788 --> 05:14:32.798 align:start position:0%
bill is also similar to a bill that was
 
05:14:35.030 --> 05:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
proposed by representative gay last
 
05:14:35.040 --> 05:14:36.070 align:start position:0%
proposed by representative gay last
session

05:14:36.070 --> 05:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
session
 
05:14:40.470 --> 05:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
that was house bill 1626
 
05:14:42.708 --> 05:14:42.718 align:start position:0%
and this committee voted unanimously to
 
05:14:46.830 --> 05:14:46.840 align:start position:0%
itl that bill 19-0
 
05:14:49.830 --> 05:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
respectfully this bill is well intended
 
05:14:52.150 --> 05:14:52.160 align:start position:0%
and meant to protect victims of domestic
 
05:14:54.868 --> 05:14:54.878 align:start position:0%
violence but it does have potential to
 
05:14:57.750 --> 05:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
cause even greater harm to victims
 
05:15:00.628 --> 05:15:00.638 align:start position:0%
this bill would require a gal to refer a
 
05:15:03.430 --> 05:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
party that they suspect is a victim
 
05:15:05.750 --> 05:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
of domestic violence to a local crisis
 
05:15:05.760 --> 05:15:06.788 align:start position:0%
of domestic violence to a local crisis
center

05:15:06.788 --> 05:15:06.798 align:start position:0%
center
 
05:15:09.030 --> 05:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
this can create three issues and i'm
 
05:15:11.190 --> 05:15:11.200 align:start position:0%
going to walk you through those three
 
05:15:11.200 --> 05:15:12.628 align:start position:0%
going to walk you through those three
issues

05:15:12.628 --> 05:15:12.638 align:start position:0%
issues
 
05:15:15.110 --> 05:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
the first one is that without proper
 
05:15:18.230 --> 05:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
training or screening techniques the gal
 
05:15:20.628 --> 05:15:20.638 align:start position:0%
may misidentify the victim in the case
 
05:15:22.948 --> 05:15:22.958 align:start position:0%
and instead refer the abuser to the
 
05:15:24.550 --> 05:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
crisis center
 
05:15:26.628 --> 05:15:26.638 align:start position:0%
so if the crisis center then starts
 
05:15:29.430 --> 05:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
providing services to that person the
 
05:15:31.430 --> 05:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
actual abuser
 
05:15:34.470 --> 05:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
in some cases it may preclude the crisis
 
05:15:36.628 --> 05:15:36.638 align:start position:0%
center from providing services to the
 
05:15:40.230 --> 05:15:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:42.070 --> 05:15:42.080 align:start position:0%
it's possible in that situation that a
 
05:15:44.310 --> 05:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
victim could then the victim in that
 
05:15:46.788 --> 05:15:46.798 align:start position:0%
situation could be referred to another
 
05:15:49.270 --> 05:15:49.280 align:start position:0%
crisis center but it may not be the
 
05:15:51.590 --> 05:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
crisis center that is anywhere close to
 
05:15:53.350 --> 05:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
them and it would be more difficult for
 
05:15:55.830 --> 05:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
the victim to access those services
 
05:15:57.430 --> 05:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
which we certainly don't want to make
 
05:16:01.350 --> 05:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
things more difficult for victims
 
05:16:02.788 --> 05:16:02.798 align:start position:0%
issue number two
 
05:16:05.030 --> 05:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
is that choosing to seek services from a
 
05:16:07.350 --> 05:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
crisis center is empowering one should
 
05:16:10.150 --> 05:16:10.160 align:start position:0%
not be required to seek them well this
 
05:16:12.628 --> 05:16:12.638 align:start position:0%
bill does not require a victim to accept
 
05:16:14.708 --> 05:16:14.718 align:start position:0%
services from the crisis center the
 
05:16:17.270 --> 05:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
victim may feel obligated to do so
 
05:16:20.628 --> 05:16:20.638 align:start position:0%
because a gal a court appointed official
 
05:16:23.190 --> 05:16:23.200 align:start position:0%
is asking it of them and maybe may be
 
05:16:25.590 --> 05:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
concerned that non-compliance will look
 
05:16:28.550 --> 05:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
uncooperative in the gal's eyes
 
05:16:31.670 --> 05:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
and lastly so the third issue
 
05:16:33.510 --> 05:16:33.520 align:start position:0%
is that this bill has potential to
 
05:16:35.750 --> 05:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
inadvertently waive the privilege under
 
05:16:37.910 --> 05:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
173 c
 
05:16:40.150 --> 05:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
which is the
 
05:16:42.070 --> 05:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
statute that protects the privilege
 
05:16:42.080 --> 05:16:43.430 align:start position:0%
statute that protects the privilege
between

05:16:43.430 --> 05:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
between
 
05:16:45.350 --> 05:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
the victim who is accessing crisis
 
05:16:48.070 --> 05:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
center services and the crisis center
 
05:16:51.350 --> 05:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
counselor or advocate
 
05:16:53.590 --> 05:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
so if the party starts receiving
 
05:16:55.670 --> 05:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
services from a crisis center and
 
05:16:58.150 --> 05:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
discusses those services with the gal
 
05:17:00.628 --> 05:17:00.638 align:start position:0%
who then uses that information
 
05:17:02.868 --> 05:17:02.878 align:start position:0%
to make a report to the court
 
05:17:05.350 --> 05:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
that maybe it considered a waiver of the
 
05:17:07.430 --> 05:17:07.440 align:start position:0%
privilege and then all communication
 
05:17:09.270 --> 05:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
that victim has had with the crisis
 
05:17:09.280 --> 05:17:10.150 align:start position:0%
that victim has had with the crisis
center

05:17:10.150 --> 05:17:10.160 align:start position:0%
center
 
05:17:12.470 --> 05:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
may be considered fair game
 
05:17:15.110 --> 05:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
and we certainly do not want to risk
 
05:17:18.550 --> 05:17:18.560 align:start position:0%
that safe space becoming another avenue
 
05:17:21.270 --> 05:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
to further the abuse of that victim
 
05:17:23.110 --> 05:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
so for all of these reasons i
 
05:17:25.110 --> 05:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
respectfully ask this committee to vote
 
05:17:27.510 --> 05:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
an expedient to legislate on house bill
 
05:17:31.510 --> 05:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
548 thank you so much
 
05:17:39.030 --> 05:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:41.750 --> 05:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
05:17:43.430 --> 05:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh testimony
 
05:17:45.670 --> 05:17:45.680 align:start position:0%
take a deep breath
 
05:17:47.750 --> 05:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
you've been awesome today
 
05:17:51.350 --> 05:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
and we will go on to the next person
 
05:17:53.430 --> 05:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
we don't have anybody else on the list
 
05:17:57.030 --> 05:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
however i do see two hands raised
 
05:18:03.110 --> 05:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:07.110 --> 05:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
and i will give her two minutes
 
05:18:07.120 --> 05:18:14.230 align:start position:0%
and i will give her two minutes
okay

05:18:14.230 --> 05:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:16.470 --> 05:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry my computer keeps remuting me
 
05:18:19.190 --> 05:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
after i unmute i don't have a lot to say
 
05:18:21.750 --> 05:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
about this um i was actually pretty
 
05:18:23.670 --> 05:18:23.680 align:start position:0%
impressed with the
 
05:18:26.708 --> 05:18:26.718 align:start position:0%
testimony of ms justina
 
05:18:29.510 --> 05:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
i think the bill could be amended
 
05:18:29.520 --> 05:18:30.948 align:start position:0%
i think the bill could be amended
easily

05:18:30.948 --> 05:18:30.958 align:start position:0%
easily
 
05:18:33.110 --> 05:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
to require
 
05:18:36.390 --> 05:18:36.400 align:start position:0%
the judge to give a victim of domestic
 
05:18:36.400 --> 05:18:37.910 align:start position:0%
the judge to give a victim of domestic
violence

05:18:37.910 --> 05:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
violence
 
05:18:41.750 --> 05:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
um information about a crisis center
 
05:18:41.760 --> 05:18:42.868 align:start position:0%
um information about a crisis center
um

05:18:42.868 --> 05:18:42.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:44.390 --> 05:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
but again
 
05:18:46.550 --> 05:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
you know you still have the worry that
 
05:18:48.550 --> 05:18:48.560 align:start position:0%
if the person doesn't do it
 
05:18:50.230 --> 05:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
the other thing you people need to know
 
05:18:52.150 --> 05:18:52.160 align:start position:0%
is that
 
05:18:54.948 --> 05:18:54.958 align:start position:0%
statistically nationwide
 
05:18:58.310 --> 05:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
when abusers fight for custody 70 of the
 
05:18:58.320 --> 05:18:59.350 align:start position:0%
when abusers fight for custody 70 of the
time

05:18:59.350 --> 05:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:19:01.270 --> 05:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
they get it
 
05:19:03.190 --> 05:19:03.200 align:start position:0%
and new hampshire is no different in
 
05:19:04.948 --> 05:19:04.958 align:start position:0%
that respect
 
05:19:04.958 --> 05:19:05.990 align:start position:0%
that respect
um

05:19:05.990 --> 05:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:08.470 --> 05:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
it's a very hard problem
 
05:19:10.788 --> 05:19:10.798 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
05:19:12.628 --> 05:19:12.638 align:start position:0%
might do something about it but i i
 
05:19:14.948 --> 05:19:14.958 align:start position:0%
think it does need to be amended
 
05:19:14.958 --> 05:19:17.110 align:start position:0%
think it does need to be amended
um

05:19:17.110 --> 05:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:17.120 --> 05:19:18.708 align:start position:0%
um
so

05:19:18.708 --> 05:19:18.718 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:19:20.390 --> 05:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
it's an intractable problem and it's an
 
05:19:21.910 --> 05:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
attractable problem in new hampshire
 
05:19:21.920 --> 05:19:28.470 align:start position:0%
attractable problem in new hampshire
courts

05:19:28.470 --> 05:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:36.150 --> 05:19:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:38.868 --> 05:19:38.878 align:start position:0%
seeing none we'll go to the
 
05:19:41.590 --> 05:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
final person on our list
 
05:19:47.990 --> 05:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:49.830 --> 05:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam chair just to
 
05:19:53.030 --> 05:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
make sure can you hear me okay
 
05:19:55.190 --> 05:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
yes i can excellent thank you for the
 
05:19:56.628 --> 05:19:56.638 align:start position:0%
record my name is richard head i'm the
 
05:19:58.550 --> 05:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
government affairs coordinator for the
 
05:20:00.708 --> 05:20:00.718 align:start position:0%
judicial branch you should have received
 
05:20:03.270 --> 05:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
yesterday uh written testimony from me
 
05:20:05.190 --> 05:20:05.200 align:start position:0%
uh regarding this bill
 
05:20:05.200 --> 05:20:06.150 align:start position:0%
uh regarding this bill
um

05:20:06.150 --> 05:20:06.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:20:08.150 --> 05:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
and and i'm happy if if you ask i'm
 
05:20:12.708 --> 05:20:12.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:14.948 --> 05:20:14.958 align:start position:0%
the um the one of the primary concerns
 
05:20:17.590 --> 05:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
that we have with this bill is
 
05:20:20.310 --> 05:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
the conflict that this creates with the
 
05:20:23.510 --> 05:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
statutory role of a guardian ad litem
 
05:20:26.788 --> 05:20:26.798 align:start position:0%
which the statute of 461 a16
 
05:20:28.788 --> 05:20:28.798 align:start position:0%
says is to gather information to assist
 
05:20:30.390 --> 05:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
the court in determining the best
 
05:20:32.070 --> 05:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
interest of the child
 
05:20:37.670 --> 05:20:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:41.270 --> 05:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
suspect of having a bias one way or the
 
05:20:43.750 --> 05:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
other and and it's sort of an inevitable
 
05:20:46.070 --> 05:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
aspect of the job and these are
 
05:20:49.990 --> 05:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
typically very high conflict situations
 
05:20:53.030 --> 05:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh in which a gal is being appointed
 
05:20:54.708 --> 05:20:54.718 align:start position:0%
um and they have
 
05:20:58.230 --> 05:20:58.240 align:start position:0%
there's there's a history there is
 
05:21:00.788 --> 05:21:00.798 align:start position:0%
they're difficult cases um
 
05:21:02.868 --> 05:21:02.878 align:start position:0%
uh to say the least
 
05:21:06.070 --> 05:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
one if you if you ask the guardian of
 
05:21:08.150 --> 05:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
items to start taking
 
05:21:10.628 --> 05:21:10.638 align:start position:0%
what at some level even if it's a minor
 
05:21:14.230 --> 05:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
level an advocacy position which is
 
05:21:14.240 --> 05:21:15.270 align:start position:0%
level an advocacy position which is
uh

05:21:15.270 --> 05:21:15.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:21:17.270 --> 05:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
which is essentially making an
 
05:21:21.430 --> 05:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
evaluation of of is violence suspected
 
05:21:24.230 --> 05:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
or even alleged and this gets to to the
 
05:21:26.310 --> 05:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
point that was described earlier the
 
05:21:31.110 --> 05:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
mere allegation of domestic violence
 
05:21:34.628 --> 05:21:34.638 align:start position:0%
would require a referral to a local
 
05:21:36.788 --> 05:21:36.798 align:start position:0%
crisis center or assessment
 
05:21:39.350 --> 05:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
by a domestic violence counselor
 
05:21:41.190 --> 05:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
and that is not the job of the guardian
 
05:21:43.670 --> 05:21:43.680 align:start position:0%
enlightenment the guardian advice job is
 
05:21:45.590 --> 05:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
to assist the court to gather
 
05:21:45.600 --> 05:21:46.788 align:start position:0%
to assist the court to gather
information

05:21:46.788 --> 05:21:46.798 align:start position:0%
information
 
05:21:49.750 --> 05:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
and to provide data to the court and in
 
05:21:51.670 --> 05:21:51.680 align:start position:0%
order to be able to do that
 
05:21:54.470 --> 05:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
has to appear and be objective and
 
05:21:54.480 --> 05:21:56.070 align:start position:0%
has to appear and be objective and
independent

05:21:56.070 --> 05:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
independent
 
05:22:01.030 --> 05:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
and we have a concern that in a in a
 
05:22:03.190 --> 05:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
atmosphere that is already
 
05:22:04.788 --> 05:22:04.798 align:start position:0%
full of conflict
 
05:22:06.948 --> 05:22:06.958 align:start position:0%
we're putting a duty on the guardian ad
 
05:22:06.958 --> 05:22:07.990 align:start position:0%
we're putting a duty on the guardian ad
litem

05:22:07.990 --> 05:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
litem
 
05:22:11.590 --> 05:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
that may appear to one of the parties to
 
05:22:14.628 --> 05:22:14.638 align:start position:0%
be a bias towards the other by referring
 
05:22:17.350 --> 05:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
somebody to counseling
 
05:22:20.708 --> 05:22:20.718 align:start position:0%
that is a step towards um
 
05:22:23.350 --> 05:22:23.360 align:start position:0%
having a more active role in the case
 
05:22:23.360 --> 05:22:24.310 align:start position:0%
having a more active role in the case
itself

05:22:24.310 --> 05:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
itself
 
05:22:26.708 --> 05:22:26.718 align:start position:0%
as opposed to that statutory role
 
05:22:28.150 --> 05:22:28.160 align:start position:0%
that's described that i mentioned
 
05:22:28.160 --> 05:22:31.510 align:start position:0%
that's described that i mentioned
earlier

05:22:31.510 --> 05:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:33.590 --> 05:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
and then with regard to the to the
 
05:22:35.830 --> 05:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
lethality assessment in addition to
 
05:22:38.150 --> 05:22:38.160 align:start position:0%
whatever confidentiality questions that
 
05:22:40.390 --> 05:22:40.400 align:start position:0%
may exist as to the content of that
 
05:22:42.708 --> 05:22:42.718 align:start position:0%
lethality assessment
 
05:22:45.350 --> 05:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
um it does create another burden on the
 
05:22:45.360 --> 05:22:46.628 align:start position:0%
um it does create another burden on the
gal

05:22:46.628 --> 05:22:46.638 align:start position:0%
gal
 
05:22:50.150 --> 05:22:50.160 align:start position:0%
it does create an expense
 
05:22:53.190 --> 05:22:53.200 align:start position:0%
and and really the the information that
 
05:22:55.350 --> 05:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
is contained within that lethality
 
05:22:55.360 --> 05:22:56.628 align:start position:0%
is contained within that lethality
assessment

05:22:56.628 --> 05:22:56.638 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
05:22:59.190 --> 05:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
is a tool for the police to make a
 
05:23:02.708 --> 05:23:02.718 align:start position:0%
determination on a very short-term basis
 
05:23:06.390 --> 05:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
on on uh what are some risks
 
05:23:08.708 --> 05:23:08.718 align:start position:0%
involved in a particular situation the
 
05:23:11.110 --> 05:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
content of it is is typically if you
 
05:23:13.190 --> 05:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
have a good gal the gil is going to
 
05:23:15.430 --> 05:23:15.440 align:start position:0%
obtain that information anyway
 
05:23:18.550 --> 05:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
and be reporting to the to the court um
 
05:23:20.550 --> 05:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
you know that and more
 
05:23:23.030 --> 05:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
in terms of of the information
 
05:23:23.040 --> 05:23:24.948 align:start position:0%
in terms of of the information
um

05:23:24.948 --> 05:23:24.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:27.990 --> 05:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
so i i i think it one is not necessary
 
05:23:30.470 --> 05:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
and two adds a burden and an expense to
 
05:23:33.350 --> 05:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
a guardian ad litem uh and and is an
 
05:23:36.390 --> 05:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
additional delay in a in a proceeding
 
05:23:38.628 --> 05:23:38.638 align:start position:0%
um with that i'll i'll be happy to take
 
05:23:40.708 --> 05:23:40.718 align:start position:0%
any questions and refer you to my
 
05:23:43.190 --> 05:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
written testimony filed yesterday
 
05:23:46.310 --> 05:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr head i do have one question
 
05:23:46.320 --> 05:23:47.110 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
05:23:56.868 --> 05:23:56.878 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question um
 
05:24:00.310 --> 05:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
it was mentioned before that um
 
05:24:02.628 --> 05:24:02.638 align:start position:0%
gals may be
 
05:24:04.708 --> 05:24:04.718 align:start position:0%
requested by
 
05:24:04.718 --> 05:24:05.750 align:start position:0%
requested by
um

05:24:05.750 --> 05:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:09.910 --> 05:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:12.230 --> 05:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
applicants um
 
05:24:12.240 --> 05:24:13.270 align:start position:0%
applicants um
i

05:24:13.270 --> 05:24:13.280 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:24:13.280 --> 05:24:14.948 align:start position:0%
i
wanted

05:24:14.948 --> 05:24:14.958 align:start position:0%
wanted
 
05:24:17.910 --> 05:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
to see if you could um expound on that
 
05:24:20.628 --> 05:24:20.638 align:start position:0%
and how often that happens and
 
05:24:22.550 --> 05:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
um just
 
05:24:22.560 --> 05:24:23.590 align:start position:0%
um just
sure

05:24:23.590 --> 05:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
sure
 
05:24:26.550 --> 05:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
so frequency i honestly don't know that
 
05:24:27.830 --> 05:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
i i don't
 
05:24:30.628 --> 05:24:30.638 align:start position:0%
dive into those details certainly if the
 
05:24:34.868 --> 05:24:34.878 align:start position:0%
if there if there is a guardian item
 
05:24:37.350 --> 05:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
that is qualified uh that party that the
 
05:24:40.628 --> 05:24:40.638 align:start position:0%
parties want that is who would be
 
05:24:40.638 --> 05:24:42.150 align:start position:0%
parties want that is who would be
um

05:24:42.150 --> 05:24:42.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:43.430 --> 05:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
who would be the guardian headliner for
 
05:24:44.868 --> 05:24:44.878 align:start position:0%
the case so
 
05:24:47.430 --> 05:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
it does happen the frequency
 
05:24:49.030 --> 05:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
that's the preference
 
05:24:49.040 --> 05:24:50.948 align:start position:0%
that's the preference
um

05:24:50.948 --> 05:24:50.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:54.390 --> 05:24:54.400 align:start position:0%
but i truthfully i don't i don't um
 
05:24:55.990 --> 05:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
practice in the family law and i haven't
 
05:24:58.310 --> 05:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
seen sort of data on
 
05:25:01.510 --> 05:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
how guardian of items ultimately are
 
05:25:05.030 --> 05:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
being identified and and put into a case
 
05:25:07.270 --> 05:25:07.280 align:start position:0%
but preference would be obviously if if
 
05:25:07.280 --> 05:25:08.150 align:start position:0%
but preference would be obviously if if
the

05:25:08.150 --> 05:25:08.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:25:10.150 --> 05:25:10.160 align:start position:0%
if the party select a guardian of the ad
 
05:25:12.708 --> 05:25:12.718 align:start position:0%
litem that's
 
05:25:14.550 --> 05:25:14.560 align:start position:0%
some level into a better route
 
05:25:19.350 --> 05:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:21.670 --> 05:25:21.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:25:23.510 --> 05:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
the next question will come from
 
05:25:27.030 --> 05:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:28.708 --> 05:25:28.718 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and uh thank you
 
05:25:31.590 --> 05:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
mr head for taking my question
 
05:25:32.868 --> 05:25:32.878 align:start position:0%
you alluded
 
05:25:32.878 --> 05:25:35.590 align:start position:0%
you alluded
to

05:25:35.590 --> 05:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:38.628 --> 05:25:38.638 align:start position:0%
unintentional bias from guardian items
 
05:25:40.310 --> 05:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
which i have seen
 
05:25:41.670 --> 05:25:41.680 align:start position:0%
as well
 
05:25:45.030 --> 05:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
in their decision-making process
 
05:25:47.350 --> 05:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
you said their job is to assist the
 
05:25:50.470 --> 05:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
court and gather gather data and must
 
05:25:52.230 --> 05:25:52.240 align:start position:0%
appear objective
 
05:25:52.240 --> 05:25:55.030 align:start position:0%
appear objective
um

05:25:55.030 --> 05:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:58.868 --> 05:25:58.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:00.310 --> 05:26:00.320 align:start position:0%
how often are you seeing this and how
 
05:26:04.230 --> 05:26:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:07.190 --> 05:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
i guess my point was as to this bill
 
05:26:11.030 --> 05:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:13.350 --> 05:26:13.360 align:start position:0%
as to this bill which would
 
05:26:13.360 --> 05:26:14.628 align:start position:0%
as to this bill which would
require

05:26:14.628 --> 05:26:14.638 align:start position:0%
require
 
05:26:18.788 --> 05:26:18.798 align:start position:0%
the guardian litem to be the the one to
 
05:26:18.798 --> 05:26:20.708 align:start position:0%
the guardian litem to be the the one to
um

05:26:20.708 --> 05:26:20.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:22.788 --> 05:26:22.798 align:start position:0%
to direct or or to
 
05:26:25.350 --> 05:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
refer i guess it's the word
 
05:26:29.350 --> 05:26:29.360 align:start position:0%
the the party making the allegation or
 
05:26:32.470 --> 05:26:32.480 align:start position:0%
or when the guardian item suspects it is
 
05:26:35.190 --> 05:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
is taking an affirmative step which
 
05:26:37.510 --> 05:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
would appear to the other side
 
05:26:40.830 --> 05:26:40.840 align:start position:0%
to be taking a position which is i've
 
05:26:42.788 --> 05:26:42.798 align:start position:0%
now um
 
05:26:43.990 --> 05:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:26:46.070 --> 05:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
i've i've now i as the guardian ad
 
05:26:47.510 --> 05:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
litems suspect
 
05:26:49.510 --> 05:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
um that domestic violence has occurred
 
05:26:49.520 --> 05:26:50.628 align:start position:0%
um that domestic violence has occurred
here

05:26:50.628 --> 05:26:50.638 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:26:50.638 --> 05:26:51.670 align:start position:0%
here
and

05:26:51.670 --> 05:26:51.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:26:53.830 --> 05:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
i'm going to take the affirmative step
 
05:26:57.510 --> 05:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
of referring that person to counseling
 
05:26:59.750 --> 05:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
it very well intended i'm not i'm not
 
05:27:01.430 --> 05:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
saying it's not
 
05:27:02.788 --> 05:27:02.798 align:start position:0%
but what i'm saying is that the other
 
05:27:02.798 --> 05:27:03.670 align:start position:0%
but what i'm saying is that the other
party

05:27:03.670 --> 05:27:03.680 align:start position:0%
party
 
05:27:03.680 --> 05:27:05.110 align:start position:0%
party
who

05:27:05.110 --> 05:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
who
 
05:27:07.030 --> 05:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
very well may be challenging domestic
 
05:27:07.040 --> 05:27:08.230 align:start position:0%
very well may be challenging domestic
violence

05:27:08.230 --> 05:27:08.240 align:start position:0%
violence
 
05:27:13.030 --> 05:27:13.040 align:start position:0%
is going to see that act as taking sides
 
05:27:15.590 --> 05:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
certainly in the report to the court
 
05:27:18.470 --> 05:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
um there is there are there's data that
 
05:27:20.150 --> 05:27:20.160 align:start position:0%
that has
 
05:27:22.310 --> 05:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:27:25.430 --> 05:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
that presents um
 
05:27:28.470 --> 05:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
a view on the situation
 
05:27:30.628 --> 05:27:30.638 align:start position:0%
um but the the
 
05:27:32.230 --> 05:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
investigation itself and this would
 
05:27:33.830 --> 05:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
really be triggered during the
 
05:27:33.840 --> 05:27:35.510 align:start position:0%
really be triggered during the
investigation

05:27:35.510 --> 05:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
05:27:38.310 --> 05:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
um because it's if it's alleged then
 
05:27:40.948 --> 05:27:40.958 align:start position:0%
there's a referral or if it's suspected
 
05:27:42.788 --> 05:27:42.798 align:start position:0%
so if during the course of the
 
05:27:45.830 --> 05:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
investigation itself the guardian of
 
05:27:48.708 --> 05:27:48.718 align:start position:0%
item suspects domestic violence that
 
05:27:48.718 --> 05:27:49.590 align:start position:0%
item suspects domestic violence that
would

05:27:49.590 --> 05:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
would
 
05:27:52.628 --> 05:27:52.638 align:start position:0%
have to re require a referral and that
 
05:27:54.788 --> 05:27:54.798 align:start position:0%
act is
 
05:27:56.948 --> 05:27:56.958 align:start position:0%
is essentially a
 
05:27:59.990 --> 05:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
an act in the midst of a
 
05:28:00.000 --> 05:28:01.830 align:start position:0%
an act in the midst of a
independent

05:28:01.830 --> 05:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
independent
 
05:28:04.230 --> 05:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
and unbiased
 
05:28:04.240 --> 05:28:05.350 align:start position:0%
and unbiased
process

05:28:05.350 --> 05:28:05.360 align:start position:0%
process
 
05:28:07.750 --> 05:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
so i think it's creating an opportunity
 
05:28:09.750 --> 05:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
for just further
 
05:28:12.470 --> 05:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
friction um in a in a difficult
 
05:28:12.480 --> 05:28:16.628 align:start position:0%
friction um in a in a difficult
situation

05:28:16.628 --> 05:28:16.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:18.868 --> 05:28:18.878 align:start position:0%
thank you representative altschiller do
 
05:28:23.030 --> 05:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:25.670 --> 05:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
thank you chair and uh thank you mr head
 
05:28:27.510 --> 05:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
05:28:30.628 --> 05:28:30.638 align:start position:0%
um i'm wondering if you could
 
05:28:35.590 --> 05:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
give me your opinion as to on um
 
05:28:38.948 --> 05:28:38.958 align:start position:0%
miss justina's assertion that this bill
 
05:28:41.670 --> 05:28:41.680 align:start position:0%
as written could possibly breach
 
05:28:45.350 --> 05:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:48.788 --> 05:28:48.798 align:start position:0%
of a crisis center advocate and a
 
05:28:48.798 --> 05:28:52.708 align:start position:0%
of a crisis center advocate and a
survivor

05:28:52.708 --> 05:28:52.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:55.590 --> 05:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
if this referral were to come from a gal
 
05:28:57.190 --> 05:28:57.200 align:start position:0%
and then further
 
05:29:02.628 --> 05:29:02.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:05.430 --> 05:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
i guess so i don't have an opinion on
 
05:29:07.190 --> 05:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
that i i don't
 
05:29:07.200 --> 05:29:10.548 align:start position:0%
that i i don't
um

05:29:10.548 --> 05:29:10.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:11.990 --> 05:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to think it through what
 
05:29:13.430 --> 05:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
would be the circumstance where that
 
05:29:17.270 --> 05:29:17.280 align:start position:0%
would occur certainly if the
 
05:29:17.280 --> 05:29:19.430 align:start position:0%
would occur certainly if the
um

05:29:19.430 --> 05:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:29:23.990 --> 05:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:26.070 --> 05:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
or counselor became
 
05:29:28.868 --> 05:29:28.878 align:start position:0%
a witness that because you know
 
05:29:30.788 --> 05:29:30.798 align:start position:0%
essentially is identified as a person
 
05:29:33.430 --> 05:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
now with knowledge and a witness
 
05:29:35.750 --> 05:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
that creates some conflict but i i
 
05:29:37.990 --> 05:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
honestly don't i'm not sure uh i think
 
05:29:40.310 --> 05:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
it's it's probably a better question for
 
05:29:44.708 --> 05:29:44.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:50.070 --> 05:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:52.548 --> 05:29:52.558 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:29:53.990 --> 05:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
great thank you
 
05:29:56.390 --> 05:29:56.400 align:start position:0%
seeing no more hands and having nobody
 
05:29:58.390 --> 05:29:58.400 align:start position:0%
else on the list
 
05:30:02.390 --> 05:30:02.400 align:start position:0%
and no more questions i will close
 
05:30:02.400 --> 05:30:04.948 align:start position:0%
and no more questions i will close
um

05:30:04.948 --> 05:30:04.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:07.310 --> 05:30:07.320 align:start position:0%

the within the city of manchester
 
05:31:29.750 --> 05:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
um house bill 460
 
05:31:32.230 --> 05:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
came throughout the um throughout the
 
05:31:34.310 --> 05:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
years on this committee
 
05:31:34.320 --> 05:31:35.750 align:start position:0%
years on this committee
of

05:31:35.750 --> 05:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:31:38.868 --> 05:31:38.878 align:start position:0%
trying to get our fingers on
 
05:31:40.948 --> 05:31:40.958 align:start position:0%
how would this bill affect the other
 
05:31:40.958 --> 05:31:42.150 align:start position:0%
how would this bill affect the other
cases

05:31:42.150 --> 05:31:42.160 align:start position:0%
cases
 
05:31:42.160 --> 05:31:43.270 align:start position:0%
cases
um

05:31:43.270 --> 05:31:43.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:31:45.990 --> 05:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
you know we you know we hear of we hear
 
05:31:48.390 --> 05:31:48.400 align:start position:0%
of issues that we're looking to fix
 
05:31:51.270 --> 05:31:51.280 align:start position:0%
however when we fix those issues the
 
05:31:54.150 --> 05:31:54.160 align:start position:0%
following term we hear
 
05:31:56.470 --> 05:31:56.480 align:start position:0%
different issues that came from that
 
05:32:01.270 --> 05:32:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:05.110 --> 05:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
so the study would be working with um
 
05:32:07.350 --> 05:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
with the circuit court to
 
05:32:09.030 --> 05:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
see if we can't
 
05:32:12.230 --> 05:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
get more information when we need it a
 
05:32:14.470 --> 05:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
lot of times we'll hear bills
 
05:32:14.480 --> 05:32:15.430 align:start position:0%
lot of times we'll hear bills
and

05:32:15.430 --> 05:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:32:16.868 --> 05:32:16.878 align:start position:0%
we need information we're going to
 
05:32:18.788 --> 05:32:18.798 align:start position:0%
execute in three days
 
05:32:20.708 --> 05:32:20.718 align:start position:0%
and we just don't get that i know when i
 
05:32:23.990 --> 05:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
first started on children of family law
 
05:32:27.430 --> 05:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
there was a circuit court person
 
05:32:27.440 --> 05:32:28.788 align:start position:0%
there was a circuit court person
assigned

05:32:28.788 --> 05:32:28.798 align:start position:0%
assigned
 
05:32:30.230 --> 05:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
to us
 
05:32:32.230 --> 05:32:32.240 align:start position:0%
that had all the information that we
 
05:32:34.070 --> 05:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
needed even
 
05:32:36.470 --> 05:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
even on information that they don't
 
05:32:39.270 --> 05:32:39.280 align:start position:0%
relatively keep data of uh but they
 
05:32:39.280 --> 05:32:40.230 align:start position:0%
relatively keep data of uh but they
would

05:32:40.230 --> 05:32:40.240 align:start position:0%
would
 
05:32:42.150 --> 05:32:42.160 align:start position:0%
they would go and look up some of the
 
05:32:45.670 --> 05:32:45.680 align:start position:0%
data maybe take a 25 reading of it and
 
05:32:47.350 --> 05:32:47.360 align:start position:0%
give us an example
 
05:32:49.830 --> 05:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
um so that were they there we we
 
05:32:51.270 --> 05:32:51.280 align:start position:0%
you know we could have a little bit of a
 
05:32:53.110 --> 05:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
pulse on the bills that affect the other
 
05:32:53.120 --> 05:32:54.150 align:start position:0%
pulse on the bills that affect the other
cases

05:32:54.150 --> 05:32:54.160 align:start position:0%
cases
 
05:32:56.230 --> 05:32:56.240 align:start position:0%
uh in
 
05:32:58.470 --> 05:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
how it would reduce or increase
 
05:33:01.990 --> 05:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
conflicts i i know myself for years on
 
05:33:03.910 --> 05:33:03.920 align:start position:0%
this committee i i've always tried to
 
05:33:05.350 --> 05:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
look at every bill
 
05:33:08.230 --> 05:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
on the possibility of increasing
 
05:33:08.240 --> 05:33:09.030 align:start position:0%
on the possibility of increasing
um

05:33:09.030 --> 05:33:09.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:33:11.670 --> 05:33:11.680 align:start position:0%
or or decreasing conflicts those are
 
05:33:11.680 --> 05:33:13.030 align:start position:0%
or or decreasing conflicts those are
something

05:33:13.030 --> 05:33:13.040 align:start position:0%
something
 
05:33:16.390 --> 05:33:16.400 align:start position:0%
as as a representative um i i want to be
 
05:33:18.390 --> 05:33:18.400 align:start position:0%
sure i'm not passing
 
05:33:21.030 --> 05:33:21.040 align:start position:0%
legislation that increases conflicts
 
05:33:21.040 --> 05:33:22.470 align:start position:0%
legislation that increases conflicts
because

05:33:22.470 --> 05:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:33:24.708 --> 05:33:24.718 align:start position:0%
that that's not what i want to do
 
05:33:27.430 --> 05:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
um so this is relative to determination
 
05:33:29.990 --> 05:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
of parental rights and responsibilities
 
05:33:33.750 --> 05:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
um you know uh you know for example uh
 
05:33:36.788 --> 05:33:36.798 align:start position:0%
bills with respect to co-parenting
 
05:33:40.830 --> 05:33:40.840 align:start position:0%
you know how many are there um you know
 
05:33:44.310 --> 05:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
how how difficult is this you know i
 
05:33:45.190 --> 05:33:45.200 align:start position:0%
mean i
 
05:33:47.350 --> 05:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
suspect that there are a lot of
 
05:33:50.070 --> 05:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
co-parenting issues um but i don't know
 
05:33:52.390 --> 05:33:52.400 align:start position:0%
that it's just what i guess from talking
 
05:33:54.470 --> 05:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
to constituents or whatever and that may
 
05:33:57.350 --> 05:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
not be the case um so
 
05:33:59.590 --> 05:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
although this this is
 
05:34:01.190 --> 05:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
with respect to determining parental
 
05:34:03.190 --> 05:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
rights and responsibilities you know
 
05:34:05.910 --> 05:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
have we heard as we heard today
 
05:34:05.920 --> 05:34:06.948 align:start position:0%
have we heard as we heard today
um

05:34:06.948 --> 05:34:06.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:08.310 --> 05:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
you know there's a lot of questions that
 
05:34:10.948 --> 05:34:10.958 align:start position:0%
we have and you know i'm grateful for mr
 
05:34:12.390 --> 05:34:12.400 align:start position:0%
head being here
 
05:34:12.400 --> 05:34:13.830 align:start position:0%
head being here
um

05:34:13.830 --> 05:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:16.310 --> 05:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
you know because that is also helpful to
 
05:34:18.628 --> 05:34:18.638 align:start position:0%
have a representative here but
 
05:34:21.030 --> 05:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
uh to you know to to work with the
 
05:34:23.350 --> 05:34:23.360 align:start position:0%
circuit court to see if we can't come up
 
05:34:25.030 --> 05:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
with a way
 
05:34:26.070 --> 05:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
to get
 
05:34:28.150 --> 05:34:28.160 align:start position:0%
uh in my mind some imperative
 
05:34:30.310 --> 05:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
information with respect to decision
 
05:34:32.470 --> 05:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
making that we have in this in this
 
05:34:35.270 --> 05:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
committee to you know not only
 
05:34:37.750 --> 05:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
help us to make informed decisions
 
05:34:42.548 --> 05:34:42.558 align:start position:0%
but to relieve the circuit court of
 
05:34:46.470 --> 05:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
you know of of issues that they have in
 
05:34:46.480 --> 05:34:47.670 align:start position:0%
you know of of issues that they have in
judging

05:34:47.670 --> 05:34:47.680 align:start position:0%
judging
 
05:34:49.510 --> 05:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
you know i mean i'm sure they would much
 
05:34:53.510 --> 05:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
rather have it clear and concise then
 
05:34:55.270 --> 05:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
you know because what happens is other
 
05:34:57.430 --> 05:34:57.440 align:start position:0%
you know judges deter you know judges
 
05:34:59.350 --> 05:34:59.360 align:start position:0%
determine different
 
05:35:01.830 --> 05:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
um you know read the law differently and
 
05:35:01.840 --> 05:35:02.628 align:start position:0%
um you know read the law differently and
so

05:35:02.628 --> 05:35:02.638 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:35:04.470 --> 05:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
you know we've heard over time where you
 
05:35:06.868 --> 05:35:06.878 align:start position:0%
know one couple you know one parent will
 
05:35:07.910 --> 05:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
come in
 
05:35:09.590 --> 05:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
with an issue
 
05:35:12.070 --> 05:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
where another judge in another court
 
05:35:15.110 --> 05:35:15.120 align:start position:0%
totally took that differently um so
 
05:35:16.070 --> 05:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:35:18.470 --> 05:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
helping both the circuit court and
 
05:35:20.788 --> 05:35:20.798 align:start position:0%
children of family law
 
05:35:23.430 --> 05:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
come together with a um
 
05:35:26.948 --> 05:35:26.958 align:start position:0%
you know with with a uh conclusive
 
05:35:30.230 --> 05:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
uh informed decisions for us and a
 
05:35:31.830 --> 05:35:31.840 align:start position:0%
better managed
 
05:35:34.548 --> 05:35:34.558 align:start position:0%
um circuit court for them is why this
 
05:35:38.470 --> 05:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:41.110 --> 05:35:41.120 align:start position:0%

question
um

05:35:56.070 --> 05:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:35:57.110 --> 05:35:57.120 align:start position:0%
i see
 
05:35:58.868 --> 05:35:58.878 align:start position:0%
the three members of the house of
 
05:36:01.670 --> 05:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
representatives appointed by the speaker
 
05:36:03.430 --> 05:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
and two members of the senate appointed
 
05:36:05.990 --> 05:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
by the senate president
 
05:36:06.000 --> 05:36:07.590 align:start position:0%
by the senate president
um

05:36:07.590 --> 05:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:36:09.590 --> 05:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
when taking into consideration
 
05:36:11.430 --> 05:36:11.440 align:start position:0%
establishing this bill that would
 
05:36:12.948 --> 05:36:12.958 align:start position:0%
establish a committee
 
05:36:16.628 --> 05:36:16.638 align:start position:0%
um did you take into consideration
 
05:36:16.638 --> 05:36:17.990 align:start position:0%
um did you take into consideration
judges

05:36:17.990 --> 05:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
judges
 
05:36:20.470 --> 05:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
as i feel they may imply a good
 
05:36:22.628 --> 05:36:22.638 align:start position:0%
uh excuse me they may be able to provide
 
05:36:26.390 --> 05:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:28.150 --> 05:36:28.160 align:start position:0%
well committees that normally uh thank
 
05:36:30.230 --> 05:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
you for the question uh uh
 
05:36:31.990 --> 05:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
representative blander
 
05:36:35.590 --> 05:36:35.600 align:start position:0%
committees are normally uh legislatures
 
05:36:37.590 --> 05:36:37.600 align:start position:0%
um the senate more than likely is gonna
 
05:36:39.190 --> 05:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
say one member
 
05:36:40.948 --> 05:36:40.958 align:start position:0%
you know um
 
05:36:43.190 --> 05:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
so it's usually legislatures on
 
05:36:44.708 --> 05:36:44.718 align:start position:0%
committees and commissions then you
 
05:36:46.470 --> 05:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
would invite every i mean the commission
 
05:36:47.910 --> 05:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
would be great if we could even invite
 
05:36:49.270 --> 05:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
fam you know
 
05:36:51.510 --> 05:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
parents that have been involved um but i
 
05:36:51.520 --> 05:36:52.548 align:start position:0%
parents that have been involved um but i
think

05:36:52.548 --> 05:36:52.558 align:start position:0%
think
 
05:36:55.030 --> 05:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
i you know i think that's on a broader
 
05:36:58.150 --> 05:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
base uh but with respect to uh parental
 
05:37:01.030 --> 05:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
rights and responsibilities i think um
 
05:37:03.190 --> 05:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
you know i think the legislature
 
05:37:03.200 --> 05:37:04.788 align:start position:0%
you know i think the legislature
um

05:37:04.788 --> 05:37:04.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:37:05.750 --> 05:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:37:06.788 --> 05:37:06.798 align:start position:0%
i know
 
05:37:09.510 --> 05:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
mr head will sit with us i know
 
05:37:12.390 --> 05:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
uh judge um
 
05:37:15.110 --> 05:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
judge king is it uh would sit with us
 
05:37:17.670 --> 05:37:17.680 align:start position:0%
um you know you know because it it it'll
 
05:37:20.230 --> 05:37:20.240 align:start position:0%
help both of us then it'll help them as
 
05:37:26.070 --> 05:37:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:30.708 --> 05:37:30.718 align:start position:0%
thank you um representative yokela
 
05:37:32.230 --> 05:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking the
 
05:37:35.590 --> 05:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:38.470 --> 05:37:38.480 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding thus far this
 
05:37:40.390 --> 05:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
session that um people are
 
05:37:40.400 --> 05:37:41.350 align:start position:0%
session that um people are
uh

05:37:41.350 --> 05:37:41.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:37:44.708 --> 05:37:44.718 align:start position:0%
not willing to establish committees that
 
05:37:47.190 --> 05:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
are going to uh report
 
05:37:48.470 --> 05:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
this year
 
05:37:51.270 --> 05:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
due to the lack of
 
05:37:54.628 --> 05:37:54.638 align:start position:0%
um ability to meet in person uh this
 
05:37:54.638 --> 05:37:55.510 align:start position:0%
um ability to meet in person uh this
year

05:37:55.510 --> 05:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:37:59.510 --> 05:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
and um it seems like this is also a
 
05:38:02.070 --> 05:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
perennial issue so
 
05:38:04.310 --> 05:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
it seemed that you would be in favor of
 
05:38:06.548 --> 05:38:06.558 align:start position:0%
creating this more of a standing
 
05:38:08.150 --> 05:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
commission to
 
05:38:09.910 --> 05:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
you know hear issues
 
05:38:12.150 --> 05:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
uh in the
 
05:38:14.150 --> 05:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
family court would you
 
05:38:14.160 --> 05:38:15.990 align:start position:0%
family court would you
um

05:38:15.990 --> 05:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:38:18.150 --> 05:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
would you be amenable to an amendment
 
05:38:20.230 --> 05:38:20.240 align:start position:0%
such such as that
 
05:38:21.830 --> 05:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh so thank you for the question uh
 
05:38:24.708 --> 05:38:24.718 align:start position:0%
representative keller um i i'm not privy
 
05:38:26.788 --> 05:38:26.798 align:start position:0%
to what's
 
05:38:27.990 --> 05:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:38:29.670 --> 05:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
what's gonna make it or not gonna make
 
05:38:31.510 --> 05:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
it so maybe you could have your people
 
05:38:35.110 --> 05:38:35.120 align:start position:0%
call my people and we could uh
 
05:38:38.390 --> 05:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
um so but i i you know i think a
 
05:38:38.400 --> 05:38:39.590 align:start position:0%
um so but i i you know i think a
commission

05:38:39.590 --> 05:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
commission
 
05:38:41.510 --> 05:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
i mean this was
 
05:38:43.830 --> 05:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
when when i put this in it was parental
 
05:38:46.070 --> 05:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
rights and responsibility only i figured
 
05:38:48.470 --> 05:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
i'd take a bite instead of going after
 
05:38:51.430 --> 05:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
the whole pitcher um so i mean a
 
05:38:53.510 --> 05:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
commission i you know commission would
 
05:38:56.788 --> 05:38:56.798 align:start position:0%
take longer i think i i i think this is
 
05:38:59.590 --> 05:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
going to be relatively
 
05:39:02.868 --> 05:39:02.878 align:start position:0%
um simple and expedited because you know
 
05:39:04.390 --> 05:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
the circuit court knows what they want
 
05:39:06.868 --> 05:39:06.878 align:start position:0%
and the legislator knows what they want
 
05:39:08.948 --> 05:39:08.958 align:start position:0%
um so it's just a matter of where we're
 
05:39:11.590 --> 05:39:11.600 align:start position:0%
going to compromise and get it done so
 
05:39:13.430 --> 05:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh but yeah a commission
 
05:39:15.350 --> 05:39:15.360 align:start position:0%
i i mean i'm open to whatever the
 
05:39:16.868 --> 05:39:16.878 align:start position:0%
committee thinks would be in the best
 
05:39:20.708 --> 05:39:20.718 align:start position:0%
interests of uh the family court and
 
05:39:23.750 --> 05:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:26.708 --> 05:39:26.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:27.750 --> 05:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:39:30.548 --> 05:39:30.558 align:start position:0%
and then we will move on to
 
05:39:30.558 --> 05:39:32.868 align:start position:0%
and then we will move on to
um

05:39:32.868 --> 05:39:32.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:39:35.750 --> 05:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
one more person wants to testify
 
05:39:38.070 --> 05:39:38.080 align:start position:0%
uh mr richard head
 
05:39:42.948 --> 05:39:42.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:44.788 --> 05:39:44.798 align:start position:0%

05:40:02.788 --> 05:40:02.798 align:start position:0%
you should uh in in hearing what
 
05:40:04.868 --> 05:40:04.878 align:start position:0%

free to use me as a resource if you need

05:40:07.670 --> 05:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
data
 
05:40:10.788 --> 05:40:10.798 align:start position:0%
um preferably before a hearing
 
05:40:14.070 --> 05:40:14.080 align:start position:0%
i can ask people to extract data out of
 
05:40:16.868 --> 05:40:16.878 align:start position:0%
our odyssey database if it exists
 
05:40:16.878 --> 05:40:17.750 align:start position:0%
our odyssey database if it exists
or

05:40:17.750 --> 05:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:40:19.910 --> 05:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
get you know more general information
 
05:40:21.990 --> 05:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
from people with experience so one i
 
05:40:24.628 --> 05:40:24.638 align:start position:0%
just offer to the extent without regard
 
05:40:26.868 --> 05:40:26.878 align:start position:0%
to what happens on this bill
 
05:40:28.788 --> 05:40:28.798 align:start position:0%
if it passes or doesn't pass feel free
 
05:40:30.868 --> 05:40:30.878 align:start position:0%
to use me as a resource if you need data
 
05:40:33.510 --> 05:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
um and i'm i'm happy to do that
 
05:40:36.868 --> 05:40:36.878 align:start position:0%
secondly the covit has has affected sort
 
05:40:39.910 --> 05:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
of normal processes i think normally um
 
05:40:42.310 --> 05:40:42.320 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch and and depending on
 
05:40:43.590 --> 05:40:43.600 align:start position:0%
the committees
 
05:40:46.310 --> 05:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
um there's usually a introduction and
 
05:40:48.708 --> 05:40:48.718 align:start position:0%
and discussion of of issues and topics
 
05:40:51.270 --> 05:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of of the first
 
05:40:53.670 --> 05:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
year of a of a session
 
05:40:55.510 --> 05:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
um and that didn't happen this this year
 
05:40:57.030 --> 05:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
and i think it's incredibly productive
 
05:40:58.070 --> 05:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
and useful
 
05:41:00.470 --> 05:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
um and maybe if this bill does not go
 
05:41:02.390 --> 05:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
forward um
 
05:41:04.230 --> 05:41:04.240 align:start position:0%
and if there are in-person meetings
 
05:41:05.830 --> 05:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
going on at the beginning of next
 
05:41:08.070 --> 05:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
session maybe there'll be a delayed
 
05:41:09.750 --> 05:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to to do that with this
 
05:41:09.760 --> 05:41:10.868 align:start position:0%
opportunity to to do that with this
committee

05:41:10.868 --> 05:41:10.878 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:41:11.990 --> 05:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
but other than that i'd be happy to
 
05:41:17.030 --> 05:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:21.510 --> 05:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
