thank you the uh

the committee is a packet which is
 
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
intended to give you literally an agency
 
00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:37.380 align:start position:0%
overview in the highest level I could
 
00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:39.660 align:start position:0%
contemplate as well as a second document
 
00:07:41.689 --> 00:07:41.699 align:start position:0%
which should be no surprise that the
 
00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
agency has been aggressively at working
 
00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:46.020 align:start position:0%
on our Recruitment and Retention efforts
 
00:07:47.629 --> 00:07:47.639 align:start position:0%
because Staffing is our most critical
 
00:07:47.639 --> 00:07:48.909 align:start position:0%
because Staffing is our most critical
resource

00:07:48.909 --> 00:07:48.919 align:start position:0%
resource
 
00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:52.380 align:start position:0%
on the second page of the larger handout
 
00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:55.080 align:start position:0%
that has our logo on it
 
00:07:58.249 --> 00:07:58.259 align:start position:0%
defines our mission as well as our
 
00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:00.300 align:start position:0%
statute that creates the department I
 
00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:02.340 align:start position:0%
know you will read it and enjoy those
 
00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:04.860 align:start position:0%
references but in short we provide safe
 
00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:06.780 align:start position:0%

Hampshire
 
00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
on page two I give an overview of the
 
00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:16.860 align:start position:0%
three Correctional Facilities that we
 
00:08:19.369 --> 00:08:19.379 align:start position:0%
have what our current population is at
 
00:08:21.469 --> 00:08:21.479 align:start position:0%
those facilities and then on the bottom
 
00:08:23.809 --> 00:08:23.819 align:start position:0%
of the page a citation to the secure
 
00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:25.740 align:start position:0%
psychiatric unit and the separate unit
 
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
within that unit the residential
 
00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:28.860 align:start position:0%
treatment unit
 
00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:31.620 align:start position:0%
I'll point out the population the spu is
 
00:08:33.649 --> 00:08:33.659 align:start position:0%
I'll call flip-flopped
 
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
um where we have more civilly committed
 
00:08:38.149 --> 00:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
than sentenced individuals but that
 
00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:40.200 align:start position:0%
number does adjust
 
00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:43.260 align:start position:0%
um and has had no uh trended pattern to
 
00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:44.580 align:start position:0%
it if you will over the time that I've
 
00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:48.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:50.100 align:start position:0%
on the third page
 
00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
we have one transitional work center
 
00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:53.769 align:start position:0%
we have one transitional work center
um

00:08:53.769 --> 00:08:53.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:56.820 align:start position:0%
off okay let me explain that we have one
 
00:08:59.210 --> 00:08:59.220 align:start position:0%
transitional work center for men that is
 
00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:01.620 align:start position:0%
not behind the secure perimeter that is
 
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
different for women when the women's
 
00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
prison facility was built their
 
00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:07.620 align:start position:0%
transitional work center is within the
 
00:09:09.889 --> 00:09:09.899 align:start position:0%
secure perimeter of that facility on the
 
00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:11.160 align:start position:0%
same grounds as the New Hampshire state
 
00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:12.660 align:start position:0%
prison for men
 
00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
we have three transitional housing units
 
00:09:17.509 --> 00:09:17.519 align:start position:0%
again indicates where they are in the
 
00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:23.100 align:start position:0%
on page four
 
00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:25.320 align:start position:0%
we list our 11 probation and parole
 
00:09:27.949 --> 00:09:27.959 align:start position:0%
district offices and the current
 
00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:30.260 align:start position:0%
supervision caseload for those offices
 
00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:33.320 align:start position:0%
we have as of today
 
00:09:36.769 --> 00:09:36.779 align:start position:0%
362 people that are in fugitive status
 
00:09:38.269 --> 00:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
that have absconded from their
 
00:09:38.279 --> 00:09:39.410 align:start position:0%
that have absconded from their
supervision

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:39.420 align:start position:0%
supervision
 
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
and within the division of field
 
00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:43.740 align:start position:0%
services we also have a central office
 
00:09:45.769 --> 00:09:45.779 align:start position:0%
as we refer to it that is a Collections
 
00:09:48.769 --> 00:09:48.779 align:start position:0%
Unit and collects fines and obligations
 
00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:51.720 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the sentencings sentencing
 
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
documents as well as the obligations
 
00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
they create through destruction of state
 
00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
property during incarceration on average
 
00:09:59.930 --> 00:09:59.940 align:start position:0%
that unit collects approximately two
 
00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:01.560 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year
 
00:10:03.829 --> 00:10:03.839 align:start position:0%
we have three other uh we'll reference
 
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
facilities our headquarters facility is
 
00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:10.260 align:start position:0%
a few floors and a building owned and
 
00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:12.860 align:start position:0%
managed uh by Health and Human Services
 
00:10:15.829 --> 00:10:15.839 align:start position:0%
as well as administrative Services we
 
00:10:17.509 --> 00:10:17.519 align:start position:0%
have a warehouse and we have our
 
00:10:21.949 --> 00:10:21.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:23.700 align:start position:0%
commission I have just a quick question
 
00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:26.940 align:start position:0%
question we've had a number of hearings
 
00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
on the sununu center and what's going to
 
00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:30.540 align:start position:0%
be done with it which should be done
 
00:10:32.269 --> 00:10:32.279 align:start position:0%
with it
 
00:10:33.889 --> 00:10:33.899 align:start position:0%
um a number of us I'm sure you've been
 
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:36.240 align:start position:0%
down there to the more modern secure
 
00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:39.240 align:start position:0%
unit which is you know again relatively
 
00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:41.100 align:start position:0%
you know is is any of that space
 
00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:43.260 align:start position:0%
something you could use instead of at
 
00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:45.240 align:start position:0%
the stage just abandoning that facility
 
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
like I'm I was looking at your secure
 
00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:51.660 align:start position:0%
psychiatric unit with the sununu center
 
00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
work for you there or or some other
 
00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
facility just it seems like a a very
 
00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:00.060 align:start position:0%
nice the the modern part of the facility
 
00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:01.860 align:start position:0%
seems like something that certainly
 
00:11:05.329 --> 00:11:05.339 align:start position:0%
could be used by Corrections represent
 
00:11:07.069 --> 00:11:07.079 align:start position:0%
leishman that's a great question we were
 
00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:09.300 align:start position:0%
asked that question pre the design and
 
00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:11.100 align:start position:0%
build of the women's prison we went down
 
00:11:13.009 --> 00:11:13.019 align:start position:0%
and that was my opportunity to see that
 
00:11:13.019 --> 00:11:14.269 align:start position:0%
and that was my opportunity to see that
space

00:11:14.269 --> 00:11:14.279 align:start position:0%
space
 
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
um we opted that that was not going to
 
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
be suitable space for adults in a
 
00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:21.420 align:start position:0%
correctional environment and as it
 
00:11:23.449 --> 00:11:23.459 align:start position:0%
pertains to the secure psychiatric unit
 
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
my apprehension at this point giving our
 
00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:28.260 align:start position:0%
staffing and resources to create another
 
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:30.720 align:start position:0%
geographically disparate location and
 
00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:32.820 align:start position:0%
try to staff that with all of the
 
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
disciplines we need to run nursing staff
 
00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:37.380 align:start position:0%
mental health staff security staff so on
 
00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:39.240 align:start position:0%
and so forth would just increase the
 
00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
challenges the Department's facing at
 
00:11:43.449 --> 00:11:43.459 align:start position:0%
this point all right thanks thank you
 
00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:49.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so related to that
 
00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:52.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't aren't there current staff at
 
00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
at the youth center that might be let go
 
00:11:57.889 --> 00:11:57.899 align:start position:0%
when it's closed that could be usable in
 
00:12:00.949 --> 00:12:00.959 align:start position:0%
your organization represent McGuire I'm
 
00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:03.300 align:start position:0%
not sure I know that their census is
 
00:12:06.949 --> 00:12:06.959 align:start position:0%
very small and that facility would house
 
00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
a lot larger of a population and if we
 
00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
were going to use it the population
 
00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
would be significantly larger I don't
 
00:12:15.769 --> 00:12:15.779 align:start position:0%
know the cadrea staff they have down
 
00:12:17.389 --> 00:12:17.399 align:start position:0%
there but if it's for a smaller
 
00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:19.620 align:start position:0%
population I would have to times that by
 
00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
possibly six
 
00:12:24.949 --> 00:12:24.959 align:start position:0%
but I appreciate that further question
 
00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
thank you any for where we have a little
 
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
break any action
 
00:12:33.769 --> 00:12:33.779 align:start position:0%
thank you on page five um I start to I
 
00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:35.700 align:start position:0%
want I want to provide you some basic
 
00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
what I would call demographics in a
 
00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:39.240 align:start position:0%
broad sense of that term
 
00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:41.100 align:start position:0%
when people come into our facility they
 
00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:43.620 align:start position:0%
self-report their race this is the
 
00:12:45.769 --> 00:12:45.779 align:start position:0%
collection of that information the state
 
00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:46.980 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire predominantly
 
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
incarcerates white uh individuals
 
00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:51.540 align:start position:0%
um you'll see their self-reported
 
00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:55.009 align:start position:0%
um you'll see their self-reported
breakouts

00:12:55.009 --> 00:12:55.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:59.090 --> 00:12:59.100 align:start position:0%
on page six oh yeah so the the yellow
 
00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
pie is missing a number
 
00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:10.330 align:start position:0%
it is squashed we'll fix that for you
 
00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:13.030 align:start position:0%
it is squashed we'll fix that for you
[Laughter]

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
yeah because there's a different point
 
00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:16.310 align:start position:0%
yeah because there's a different point
board

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:13:21.889 --> 00:13:21.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:24.949 --> 00:13:24.959 align:start position:0%
on page six we also uh predominantly
 
00:13:27.769 --> 00:13:27.779 align:start position:0%
incarcerate uh biological males at the
 
00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:30.060 align:start position:0%
rate of 93 percent and seven percent of
 
00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:32.220 align:start position:0%
our population are women as of today
 
00:13:34.009 --> 00:13:34.019 align:start position:0%
just to give you a numerical reflection
 
00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:42.829 --> 00:13:42.839 align:start position:0%
that does not include the women at Shea
 
00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:45.420 align:start position:0%
Farm in that number that is 120 for
 
00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
women in the New Hampshire correctional
 
00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:49.260 align:start position:0%
facility for women
 
00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
on page seven
 
00:13:53.569 --> 00:13:53.579 align:start position:0%
with that statistics knowing that 120 of
 
00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:55.260 align:start position:0%
these individuals on page seven in this
 
00:13:58.670 --> 00:13:58.680 align:start position:0%
Adrian or age range are women we wanted
 
00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
to show you that most of the people
 
00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:02.700 align:start position:0%
incarcerated are between the ages of 30
 
00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:10.500 align:start position:0%
so why is that it's
 
00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
that's a great question
 
00:14:15.889 --> 00:14:15.899 align:start position:0%
I would share with you a lot of the
 
00:14:18.769 --> 00:14:18.779 align:start position:0%
research says that as individuals who
 
00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:20.940 align:start position:0%
have been impacted or involved in the
 
00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:23.160 align:start position:0%
justice system as they get over the age
 
00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:26.820 align:start position:0%
of 45 they essentially start to I'll say
 
00:14:29.569 --> 00:14:29.579 align:start position:0%
mature in a basic sense and age out of
 
00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:31.740 align:start position:0%
the system and truly want to change
 
00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:34.260 align:start position:0%
their pattern of behaviors we have a lot
 
00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
of impulsivity in the corrections
 
00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
population Justice involved in these age
 
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.970 align:start position:0%
population Justice involved in these age
ranges

00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:40.980 align:start position:0%
ranges
 
00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:42.540 align:start position:0%
um it's also interesting to point out to
 
00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:44.100 align:start position:0%
you because you'll often hear people say
 
00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
that the corrections uh department has a
 
00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:49.980 align:start position:0%
lot of aged individuals and what I would
 
00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
share with you is it's not their age it
 
00:14:55.009 --> 00:14:55.019 align:start position:0%
is their lifestyle choices that have
 
00:14:57.949 --> 00:14:57.959 align:start position:0%
adversely affected their health care and
 
00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
their health outcomes so you'll see this
 
00:15:02.629 --> 00:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
yes between the ages of 50 and over 60
 
00:15:05.329 --> 00:15:05.339 align:start position:0%
we have a larger pup we have a large
 
00:15:07.189 --> 00:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
population but it is not the largest
 
00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
population of people incarcerated and um
 
00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:12.540 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll share with you in a an
 
00:15:14.509 --> 00:15:14.519 align:start position:0%
additional slide when opioid use
 
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
disorder and substance use disorder in
 
00:15:19.129 --> 00:15:19.139 align:start position:0%
general is one of the primary diseases
 
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
that we're treating in incarceration
 
00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:24.060 align:start position:0%
including IV drug use all of those
 
00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:25.860 align:start position:0%
things then blend into other public
 
00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
health issues including hepatitis C HIV
 
00:15:31.069 --> 00:15:31.079 align:start position:0%
and other deteriorations of the human
 
00:15:34.269 --> 00:15:34.279 align:start position:0%
body so we're dealing with a very ill
 
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
group of individuals medically ill and
 
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:39.240 align:start position:0%
that's obviously why our medical
 
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
expenses are as high as they are
 
00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:47.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:49.860 align:start position:0%
um do you segregate the population by
 
00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:52.680 align:start position:0%
age keep them together when there's
 
00:15:55.129 --> 00:15:55.139 align:start position:0%
similar ages representative McGuire no
 
00:15:57.949 --> 00:15:57.959 align:start position:0%
the way individuals are triaged is by
 
00:15:59.569 --> 00:15:59.579 align:start position:0%
what's called a classification system
 
00:16:02.329 --> 00:16:02.339 align:start position:0%
and that classification system is
 
00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:03.720 align:start position:0%
outlined in our state administrative
 
00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:05.220 align:start position:0%
rule if you want to dive into that
 
00:16:08.389 --> 00:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
further but in simple terms we examine
 
00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
their crime we examine the information
 
00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
that we know about their actions during
 
00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:15.420 align:start position:0%
their crime to assess for levels of
 
00:16:17.389 --> 00:16:17.399 align:start position:0%
violence and things of that nature we
 
00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:19.500 align:start position:0%
assess their mental health needs their
 
00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
medical needs and Frailty as well as
 
00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:25.380 align:start position:0%
other elements common across Corrections
 
00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:27.720 align:start position:0%
and then we create class classification
 
00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:30.300 align:start position:0%
scores and that is the determination of
 
00:16:32.509 --> 00:16:32.519 align:start position:0%
their housing so it's not it's not just
 
00:16:33.949 --> 00:16:33.959 align:start position:0%
primarily their age
 
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
we have as an organization definitely
 
00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
I've been before the legislature and at
 
00:16:41.329 --> 00:16:41.339 align:start position:0%
one time we had enough individuals who
 
00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
were aged but also medically informed
 
00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:45.720 align:start position:0%
that we even contemplated do we try to
 
00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
take over a space up at glencliffe but
 
00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
that's changed significantly since then
 
00:16:52.129 --> 00:16:52.139 align:start position:0%
we've really leveraged obviously our
 
00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
medical parole statute but the numbers
 
00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:55.980 align:start position:0%
and how we provide care and Corrections
 
00:16:58.610 --> 00:16:58.620 align:start position:0%
has changed in advanced and quite
 
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
frankly our Health Care staff do one
 
00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
heck of a job providing Health Care
 
00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:05.220 align:start position:0%
during someone's incarceration
 
00:17:08.689 --> 00:17:08.699 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:10.909 --> 00:17:10.919 align:start position:0%
I apologize that I keep clearing my
 
00:17:12.169 --> 00:17:12.179 align:start position:0%
throat but that cold air definitely
 
00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
triggered something in my lungs
 
00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:18.780 align:start position:0%
on page eight we do a Breakout by crime
 
00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
type these are high level
 
00:17:22.669 --> 00:17:22.679 align:start position:0%
um categorical descriptions that
 
00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:25.079 align:start position:0%
Correctional agencies compare across
 
00:17:27.409 --> 00:17:27.419 align:start position:0%
States so that names might not be
 
00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:29.340 align:start position:0%
indicative of what they are there are
 
00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:31.380 align:start position:0%
some that are very clear alcohol related
 
00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:33.620 align:start position:0%
drug-related drugs and alcohol related
 
00:17:36.289 --> 00:17:36.299 align:start position:0%
but underneath that large paragraph what
 
00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:38.820 align:start position:0%
you'll see is the term personal means a
 
00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:40.620 align:start position:0%
crime associated with violence that
 
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
means the crime involved a bodily damage
 
00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:46.020 align:start position:0%
to a person the majority of our male
 
00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
population are incarcerated for felonies
 
00:17:51.049 --> 00:17:51.059 align:start position:0%
under the crime statute of aggravated
 
00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:53.100 align:start position:0%
felony sexual assault and felony sexual
 
00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
assault in the state of New Hampshire so
 
00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
our smaller population
 
00:17:59.930 --> 00:17:59.940 align:start position:0%
are people who have become incarcerated
 
00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:01.860 align:start position:0%
for possession of
 
00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
um and violations of the controlled Drug
 
00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:06.289 align:start position:0%
um and violations of the controlled Drug
Act

00:18:06.289 --> 00:18:06.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
are there any questions on page eight
 
00:18:13.549 --> 00:18:13.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
on page nine I think it's important to
 
00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:18.660 align:start position:0%
share with you that luckily for this
 
00:18:22.549 --> 00:18:22.559 align:start position:0%
department who has a staffing issue that
 
00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
our population has gone down absent that
 
00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:27.780 align:start position:0%
population reduction I could not be
 
00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:29.580 align:start position:0%
sitting here before you achieving the
 
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
mission we have today and we still are
 
00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:33.660 align:start position:0%
struggling with the Staffing deficit but
 
00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
it also shows you that our staffing
 
00:18:39.049 --> 00:18:39.059 align:start position:0%
excuse me our population decline was not
 
00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:41.100 align:start position:0%
the result of covid-19 which is what
 
00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
other Corrections agencies across the
 
00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:45.480 align:start position:0%
country have identified ours is because
 
00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:47.580 align:start position:0%
our state implemented things like Drug
 
00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
Court mental health court veterans court
 
00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:51.900 align:start position:0%
and really looked further down the
 
00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:53.480 align:start position:0%
criminal justice
 
00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:55.860 align:start position:0%
intercepts if you will and try to
 
00:18:57.409 --> 00:18:57.419 align:start position:0%
appropriately divert people from
 
00:18:59.270 --> 00:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
incarceration if it was safe for Public
 
00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
Safety and I think the state of New
 
00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:03.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire should be proud of the support
 
00:19:04.669 --> 00:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
they've provided for those type of
 
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
interventions and this graphic
 
00:19:09.289 --> 00:19:09.299 align:start position:0%
definitely demonstrates that
 
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
so I guess I'd like to back up just a
 
00:19:15.289 --> 00:19:15.299 align:start position:0%
little bit you mentioned drugs now
 
00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:17.340 align:start position:0%
obviously it's been a huge debate in the
 
00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:19.320 align:start position:0%
legislature about marijuana
 
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
do you have a number of people
 
00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:23.000 align:start position:0%
incarcerated for marijuana crimes
 
00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:25.380 align:start position:0%
representative Leachman my favorite
 
00:19:27.049 --> 00:19:27.059 align:start position:0%
question my favorite question because
 
00:19:28.789 --> 00:19:28.799 align:start position:0%
I've been asked it now for the last
 
00:19:31.909 --> 00:19:31.919 align:start position:0%
three years we have one person whose
 
00:19:34.909 --> 00:19:34.919 align:start position:0%
sole charge is for possession and
 
00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
distribution of marijuana from the 1980s
 
00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
but that individual had such a
 
00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
significant quantity that they were
 
00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:43.740 align:start position:0%
trying to push through the U.S Postal
 
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
Service that I'm not even sure why
 
00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:47.100 align:start position:0%
they're in our custody not in federal
 
00:19:49.669 --> 00:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
custody but other than that the state of
 
00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:52.740 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is really only from our
 
00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:55.500 align:start position:0%
Vantage Point based on the controlled
 
00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:56.940 align:start position:0%
Drug Act crimes we have incarcerated
 
00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:00.740 align:start position:0%
focusing on opioid fentanyl
 
00:20:03.169 --> 00:20:03.179 align:start position:0%
methamphetamines cocaine those
 
00:20:03.179 --> 00:20:04.450 align:start position:0%
methamphetamines cocaine those
significant

00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:04.460 align:start position:0%
significant
 
00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
charges if I have I think I I have maybe
 
00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:10.380 align:start position:0%
two or three people who are incarcerated
 
00:20:13.549 --> 00:20:13.559 align:start position:0%
with possession of cannabis charges but
 
00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:15.660 align:start position:0%
they have other charges associated with
 
00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
again cocaine fentanyl much more
 
00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:22.020 align:start position:0%
significantly tangible exposure outcome
 
00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
being death
 
00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:25.980 align:start position:0%
interesting thanks yes yes sure
 
00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:28.200 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire thank you so I
 
00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
missed when you you mentioned what what
 
00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
to what do you attribute this large
 
00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:34.860 align:start position:0%
decline of The Last Five Years thank you
 
00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:37.140 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire it is the state's
 
00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:39.720 align:start position:0%
support of entity um of interventions
 
00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:41.460 align:start position:0%
such as Drug Court mental health court
 
00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
veterans court really uh rebuilding our
 
00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
mental health system and not looking at
 
00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:49.380 align:start position:0%
this is not meant to say that the
 
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
legislature have done this but
 
00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:52.500 align:start position:0%
Corrections had become really the last
 
00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:54.780 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Resource when the mental
 
00:20:56.169 --> 00:20:56.179 align:start position:0%
health system had been deterior
 
00:20:59.270 --> 00:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
deteriorated now we're seeing and have
 
00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:01.740 align:start position:0%
been seeing a lot more opportunity if
 
00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:03.780 align:start position:0%
it's again appropriate for Public Safety
 
00:21:06.169 --> 00:21:06.179 align:start position:0%
to divert people from incarceration even
 
00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
the use of probation is a is an
 
00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:10.860 align:start position:0%
opportunity to divert from incarceration
 
00:21:13.549 --> 00:21:13.559 align:start position:0%
but really the wide implementation of
 
00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
drug court The increased implementation
 
00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:16.500 align:start position:0%
of mental health court and other
 
00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
specialty courts that recognize the
 
00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:20.460 align:start position:0%
correlation between some criminal acts
 
00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:22.500 align:start position:0%
and a mental health disorder or trauma
 
00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
from serving as a veteran have been
 
00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
smart and wise choices the state has
 
00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:27.770 align:start position:0%
smart and wise choices the state has
made

00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:27.780 align:start position:0%
made
 
00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:31.620 align:start position:0%
College yeah so what you're saying is
 
00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:34.020 align:start position:0%
the the number of crimes committed at
 
00:21:36.409 --> 00:21:36.419 align:start position:0%
the beginning is roughly is maybe the
 
00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
same but they're getting some of some of
 
00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
the criminals are getting diverted into
 
00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:44.820 align:start position:0%
other kinds of programs before they wind
 
00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:47.460 align:start position:0%
up with you is that is that right I
 
00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
would not affirm that the number of
 
00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
crimes have gone up or decreased I'm
 
00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:53.700 align:start position:0%
telling you that I definitely know that
 
00:21:55.549 --> 00:21:55.559 align:start position:0%
many are being diverted and what that
 
00:21:57.049 --> 00:21:57.059 align:start position:0%
many is I I don't know what the base
 
00:22:00.169 --> 00:22:00.179 align:start position:0%
number is okay so we don't really know
 
00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
if if the origin of of crime is up or
 
00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:05.580 align:start position:0%
down or whatever yeah well we know that
 
00:22:07.909 --> 00:22:07.919 align:start position:0%
um as a state we've been ranked uh
 
00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:09.780 align:start position:0%
number one for the last several years
 
00:22:12.529 --> 00:22:12.539 align:start position:0%
for uh our safety and our correction
 
00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
system based on Publications from U.S
 
00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
news who does do a review of States we
 
00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:20.580 align:start position:0%
should be very proud of that the crime
 
00:22:23.149 --> 00:22:23.159 align:start position:0%
rate I think we actually scored an A or
 
00:22:27.169 --> 00:22:27.179 align:start position:0%
a plus something to that effect uh at
 
00:22:28.789 --> 00:22:28.799 align:start position:0%
least last year and I think we all
 
00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:30.780 align:start position:0%
continue to watch I think it's also the
 
00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:32.340 align:start position:0%
level of crime you have to monitor
 
00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
because certainly violent crime compared
 
00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:37.380 align:start position:0%
to other again those crime categories
 
00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
make it all make your question very
 
00:22:41.029 --> 00:22:41.039 align:start position:0%
challenging for me to try to answer
 
00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:43.460 align:start position:0%
right now thank you yeah
 
00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
representative evil or Griffin any
 
00:22:52.789 --> 00:22:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:54.900 align:start position:0%
for all
 
00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
on the women's prison we were over in
 
00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
public works I we really appreciated the
 
00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:01.980 align:start position:0%
extent to which legislators were
 
00:23:04.909 --> 00:23:04.919 align:start position:0%
included in the process and my question
 
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure when to ask it I just
 
00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
remember when we were talking about the
 
00:23:12.649 --> 00:23:12.659 align:start position:0%
women's prison one of the big focuses
 
00:23:15.289 --> 00:23:15.299 align:start position:0%
was the programming that was available
 
00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
to women and to make sure that it was at
 
00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
least parallel to what the men had for
 
00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
opportunities and also to give them a
 
00:23:25.549 --> 00:23:25.559 align:start position:0%
more centralized place so you could
 
00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
provide those opportunities and I just
 
00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:30.780 align:start position:0%
wondered how that was going
 
00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
anything that you could shed light on
 
00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
has it really benefited the women that
 
00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
are there
 
00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:41.220 align:start position:0%
that's a and first I appreciate your
 
00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
support and other members of the
 
00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
legislation support and seeing that
 
00:23:46.909 --> 00:23:46.919 align:start position:0%
project to where it is today and the
 
00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:48.900 align:start position:0%
additional support for the funding to
 
00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
create a Vocational Center that was not
 
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
we were not able to fund in the initial
 
00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
build I will sneak peek preview let you
 
00:23:59.210 --> 00:23:59.220 align:start position:0%
know that based on the apologize but I
 
00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:01.620 align:start position:0%
call it covet economics at the time that
 
00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:04.799 align:start position:0%
amount is now not enough and we'll come
 
00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:07.500 align:start position:0%
back in our capital budget projects list
 
00:24:09.169 --> 00:24:09.179 align:start position:0%
to ask for an additional appropriation
 
00:24:12.289 --> 00:24:12.299 align:start position:0%
to see that to its fruition now in the
 
00:24:13.909 --> 00:24:13.919 align:start position:0%
existing infrastructure of the building
 
00:24:18.049 --> 00:24:18.059 align:start position:0%
we have advanced a lot of that area and
 
00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:19.500 align:start position:0%
we continue to work with New Hampshire
 
00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:21.240 align:start position:0%
legal assistance in a collaborative
 
00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
effort to avoid any litigation to
 
00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:26.460 align:start position:0%
identify the programs and interventions
 
00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:28.020 align:start position:0%
that we've engaged in really on the
 
00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:29.400 align:start position:0%
vocational side
 
00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:31.500 align:start position:0%
I do have a slide in here that I think
 
00:24:33.409 --> 00:24:33.419 align:start position:0%
also helps answer that question across
 
00:24:36.409 --> 00:24:36.419 align:start position:0%
the whole agency but we do have some
 
00:24:39.289 --> 00:24:39.299 align:start position:0%
more work on the women's side to do and
 
00:24:40.909 --> 00:24:40.919 align:start position:0%
that build and that building will help
 
00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:42.900 align:start position:0%
us attain it but there are a lot of
 
00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:44.460 align:start position:0%
different unique opportunities we're
 
00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:46.200 align:start position:0%
delivering there and I'll just highlight
 
00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
at least one we implemented What's
 
00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
called the pathways program and that
 
00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
program is a combination of called the
 
00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:56.340 align:start position:0%
multifaceted areas of life whether it's
 
00:24:58.130 --> 00:24:58.140 align:start position:0%
your mental health your physical
 
00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:01.320 align:start position:0%
wellness your vocational opportunities
 
00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:03.780 align:start position:0%
your educational opportunities we
 
00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:05.460 align:start position:0%
created a modified therapeutic
 
00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:07.620 align:start position:0%
environment and we layered over a
 
00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:10.020 align:start position:0%
program called the if project
 
00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:13.260 align:start position:0%
where we paid for and partnered with a
 
00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:16.200 align:start position:0%
group to come in and teach journaling to
 
00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:18.900 align:start position:0%
help women in many instances forgive
 
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
themselves first because many have not
 
00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:23.820 align:start position:0%
done that and then to move forward and
 
00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:25.980 align:start position:0%
figure out how to then develop a life
 
00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:28.500 align:start position:0%
path that is free from the justice
 
00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
system post their release and many of
 
00:25:33.049 --> 00:25:33.059 align:start position:0%
the women also are now giving back by
 
00:25:35.269 --> 00:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
attending Juvenile Diversion sessions
 
00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:37.260 align:start position:0%
and talking about their stories with the
 
00:25:39.769 --> 00:25:39.779 align:start position:0%
hope that it will help impact juveniles
 
00:25:42.529 --> 00:25:42.539 align:start position:0%
just starting out touching the justice
 
00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
system so they do not end up having a
 
00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
life of incarceration
 
00:25:50.029 --> 00:25:50.039 align:start position:0%
thanks you're welcome
 
00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:52.380 align:start position:0%
represent Griffin
 
00:25:54.649 --> 00:25:54.659 align:start position:0%
commissioner I know years ago when we
 
00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
were looking at the design of the
 
00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
women's prison a lot of legislatures had
 
00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
concern about uh
 
00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:05.400 align:start position:0%
the number of uh
 
00:26:07.669 --> 00:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
guides that it took
 
00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:09.900 align:start position:0%
because of the physical layout of the
 
00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:12.900 align:start position:0%
building they they anticipated that the
 
00:26:15.049 --> 00:26:15.059 align:start position:0%
number of personnel would be higher than
 
00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
might otherwise be the case as that
 
00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:20.580 align:start position:0%
turned out to be the case and if so how
 
00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:22.500 align:start position:0%
have you solved that problem
 
00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:23.580 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question
 
00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:25.860 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin and I I remember
 
00:26:28.669 --> 00:26:28.679 align:start position:0%
those days and I've remembered that
 
00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:31.620 align:start position:0%
there were 11 a designs that were being
 
00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
conceptualized and uh with the support
 
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
of director Hanson and myself in
 
00:26:37.490 --> 00:26:37.500 align:start position:0%
different roles at the time we brought
 
00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:40.020 align:start position:0%
it all back into what I would call scope
 
00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
um instead of Designing and building a
 
00:26:44.330 --> 00:26:44.340 align:start position:0%
campus style uh building we brought it
 
00:26:48.169 --> 00:26:48.179 align:start position:0%
into a central building we moved into
 
00:26:50.810 --> 00:26:50.820 align:start position:0%
that building in 2018 knowing we did not
 
00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:53.580 align:start position:0%
have enough Corrections Officers in the
 
00:26:55.549 --> 00:26:55.559 align:start position:0%
capacity and it was going to evoke the
 
00:26:58.130 --> 00:26:58.140 align:start position:0%
use of overtime the unfortunate story is
 
00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
that status has not changed so even with
 
00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
the authorized number we have not been
 
00:27:06.409 --> 00:27:06.419 align:start position:0%
able to hire to that authorized number I
 
00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:07.980 align:start position:0%
think the design makes sense and what we
 
00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:09.720 align:start position:0%
asked for makes sense I think the
 
00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:11.640 align:start position:0%
challenge we continue to face is having
 
00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:13.620 align:start position:0%
people understand what choosing a career
 
00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
in Corrections is and I also have a
 
00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
slide to show you that financially why
 
00:27:20.269 --> 00:27:20.279 align:start position:0%
we have not overcome that barrier as far
 
00:27:22.909 --> 00:27:22.919 align:start position:0%
as our base pay so the agency is still
 
00:27:24.649 --> 00:27:24.659 align:start position:0%
costing the state significant amounts of
 
00:27:27.529 --> 00:27:27.539 align:start position:0%
overtime for that we apologize but in
 
00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:28.860 align:start position:0%
the same regard we don't because we're
 
00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
achieving that mission with even fewer
 
00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:33.240 align:start position:0%
staff today than we did the last budget
 
00:27:35.269 --> 00:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
cycle and I'm proud of the team for
 
00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:36.900 align:start position:0%
accomplishing that
 
00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:40.380 align:start position:0%
thank you for that answer thank you
 
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
not to wander too far away from your
 
00:27:46.390 --> 00:27:46.400 align:start position:0%
presentation but uh I'm here for you sir
 
00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:49.140 align:start position:0%
representative evil touched on something
 
00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:50.700 align:start position:0%
and thank you for bringing the
 
00:27:52.810 --> 00:27:52.820 align:start position:0%
legislature into the process and
 
00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:55.500 align:start position:0%
oversight of the
 
00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
construction of a woman's prison I guess
 
00:27:59.930 --> 00:27:59.940 align:start position:0%
is the best way of saying it you also
 
00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:02.700 align:start position:0%
must have used what Das and other
 
00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:04.620 align:start position:0%
agencies because you know to be quite
 
00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
Keen we're looking at a parking garage
 
00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:08.220 align:start position:0%
and kind of there's some debate about
 
00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
oversight so you had your own Personnel
 
00:28:15.289 --> 00:28:15.299 align:start position:0%
Das any other suggestions that you might
 
00:28:16.909 --> 00:28:16.919 align:start position:0%
offer us to
 
00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:19.620 align:start position:0%
the oversight of such a project that's a
 
00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:22.380 align:start position:0%
great question for director Hansen
 
00:28:24.409 --> 00:28:24.419 align:start position:0%
so as representative people and some of
 
00:28:26.269 --> 00:28:26.279 align:start position:0%
the others here remember
 
00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:28.440 align:start position:0%
so during the women's prison project we
 
00:28:30.049 --> 00:28:30.059 align:start position:0%
followed the state law which requires us
 
00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:31.740 align:start position:0%
to use administrative Services Public
 
00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:34.620 align:start position:0%
Works division to help us oversee that
 
00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
process we did something very unique
 
00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
it's the first and possibly the last
 
00:28:40.909 --> 00:28:40.919 align:start position:0%
construction manager risk project when
 
00:28:42.649 --> 00:28:42.659 align:start position:0%
we did the women's prison so we
 
00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:44.580 align:start position:0%
basically acted the owning agency acted
 
00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:47.100 align:start position:0%
like the owner of a piece of property
 
00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:48.360 align:start position:0%
and you're going to sub out the
 
00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
foundation work the drainage the framing
 
00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:52.740 align:start position:0%
and we scoped everything so that was
 
00:28:54.049 --> 00:28:54.059 align:start position:0%
very unique
 
00:28:57.230 --> 00:28:57.240 align:start position:0%
we did save money that way we did not
 
00:28:59.269 --> 00:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
based on square footage costs have quite
 
00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
enough money to do everything we needed
 
00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
so we spent an inordinate amount of time
 
00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:04.980 align:start position:0%
as some remember doing uh value
 
00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
engineering because at first we went in
 
00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
saying okay we can build it but we can't
 
00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:10.620 align:start position:0%
build the gymnasium we can build it but
 
00:29:12.289 --> 00:29:12.299 align:start position:0%
we can't do the ball field so let's
 
00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:15.720 align:start position:0%
let's do our job costing in such a way
 
00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
and as as the commissioner pointed out
 
00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
we ended up building phase or design 11a
 
00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:23.700 align:start position:0%
by taking two feet off the front of the
 
00:29:25.490 --> 00:29:25.500 align:start position:0%
building which has shortened everything
 
00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:28.260 align:start position:0%
up and it worked based on the the about
 
00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
500 a square foot Costa so getting back
 
00:29:33.049 --> 00:29:33.059 align:start position:0%
to your question though representative
 
00:29:36.049 --> 00:29:36.059 align:start position:0%
leishman Das was a great partner in that
 
00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:37.860 align:start position:0%
project we had actually a new person
 
00:29:41.149 --> 00:29:41.159 align:start position:0%
come on board a very talented architect
 
00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:43.500 align:start position:0%
um named Tim Smith who worked with us we
 
00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
were locked at the hip for a couple
 
00:29:49.789 --> 00:29:49.799 align:start position:0%
years and uh so that did work out very
 
00:29:53.330 --> 00:29:53.340 align:start position:0%
well for us all right thanks that's I
 
00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:55.020 align:start position:0%
figured that might stimulate a question
 
00:29:59.510 --> 00:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:04.669 --> 00:30:04.679 align:start position:0%
chance buildings that uh you weren't
 
00:30:06.169 --> 00:30:06.179 align:start position:0%
exactly sure where you even going to
 
00:30:08.149 --> 00:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
build it to start with because I
 
00:30:11.389 --> 00:30:11.399 align:start position:0%
remember it was lawsuit related and the
 
00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
money was put into the budget and
 
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.269 align:start position:0%
money was put into the budget and
uh

00:30:17.269 --> 00:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:20.340 align:start position:0%
so I appreciate again the involvement
 
00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:23.700 align:start position:0%
that we had and and um and we toured it
 
00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:25.260 align:start position:0%
and it was really exciting but I
 
00:30:27.409 --> 00:30:27.419 align:start position:0%
actually have another question on The
 
00:30:30.049 --> 00:30:30.059 align:start position:0%
Vocational Center so the uh is that a
 
00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:31.620 align:start position:0%
place where you're going to try to start
 
00:30:34.789 --> 00:30:34.799 align:start position:0%
consolidating the vocational programs
 
00:30:37.549 --> 00:30:37.559 align:start position:0%
for the men and the women like in one
 
00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
building or step well no I mean in in
 
00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:43.090 align:start position:0%
building or step well no I mean in in
Cycles

00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:43.100 align:start position:0%
Cycles
 
00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
we will it's just for women it's just
 
00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
for women just for women thank you for
 
00:30:50.149 --> 00:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
the mild heart attack
 
00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:52.440 align:start position:0%
um we will not be having incarcerated
 
00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
men come into the incarcerated women's
 
00:30:58.909 --> 00:30:58.919 align:start position:0%
facility but we need a separate facility
 
00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:00.600 align:start position:0%
on the grounds and within the secure
 
00:31:01.789 --> 00:31:01.799 align:start position:0%
perimeter of the New Hampshire
 
00:31:03.769 --> 00:31:03.779 align:start position:0%
correctional facility for women to make
 
00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:06.440 align:start position:0%
sure we have what I would call a robust
 
00:31:09.289 --> 00:31:09.299 align:start position:0%
skill Development building so that
 
00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:10.740 align:start position:0%
traditionally that had been
 
00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
non-traditional occupations can be
 
00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
provided so that women can go out and
 
00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
fill the voids in our our communities in
 
00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
areas of manufacturing and other trades
 
00:31:24.409 --> 00:31:24.419 align:start position:0%
it's really to help have a robust trades
 
00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:28.200 align:start position:0%
type school that starts the process and
 
00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
we've done a lot of things within this
 
00:31:31.789 --> 00:31:31.799 align:start position:0%
square footage of what we have we have a
 
00:31:33.889 --> 00:31:33.899 align:start position:0%
manufacturing program more like an
 
00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
Amazon style skill set we have a
 
00:31:38.690 --> 00:31:38.700 align:start position:0%
sublimation program where you put the
 
00:31:40.610 --> 00:31:40.620 align:start position:0%
images on everything you could imagine
 
00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
and allow people to learn design and
 
00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:46.620 align:start position:0%
marketing we have and it
 
00:31:48.909 --> 00:31:48.919 align:start position:0%
yep we have commercial driver's license
 
00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:52.200 align:start position:0%
program an opportunity for women to
 
00:31:54.049 --> 00:31:54.059 align:start position:0%
attain their CDL and have done some
 
00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:55.500 align:start position:0%
Partnerships on how to move that forward
 
00:31:57.529 --> 00:31:57.539 align:start position:0%
even more successfully with the DMV and
 
00:32:00.649 --> 00:32:00.659 align:start position:0%
Dot when we have our state agency
 
00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
Partnerships we've released individuals
 
00:32:06.529 --> 00:32:06.539 align:start position:0%
from our facilities to state employment
 
00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:08.580 align:start position:0%
jobs and that's been a wonderful success
 
00:32:10.669 --> 00:32:10.679 align:start position:0%
in many instances but we really
 
00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
understand we need to have a physical
 
00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
space to do more on the women's prison
 
00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:17.269 align:start position:0%
space to do more on the women's prison
side

00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
side
 
00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
I just have one other follow-up so of
 
00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
course part of the idea there is to help
 
00:32:23.389 --> 00:32:23.399 align:start position:0%
these women live successful lives
 
00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:26.460 align:start position:0%
outside of the prison system right have
 
00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:28.200 align:start position:0%
you seen
 
00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:31.980 align:start position:0%
um success and in recidivism issue you
 
00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:34.140 align:start position:0%
know that sort of thing that's a great
 
00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:37.740 align:start position:0%
question uh and not directly related to
 
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:40.020 align:start position:0%
vocation and employment skilled building
 
00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:43.980 align:start position:0%
but in 2018 I took the opportunity to
 
00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
request from our partner agency Health
 
00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
and Human Services application of funds
 
00:32:50.529 --> 00:32:50.539 align:start position:0%
under the state opioid response dollars
 
00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:53.820 align:start position:0%
implementing what we piloted at that
 
00:32:55.370 --> 00:32:55.380 align:start position:0%
point point called re-entry care
 
00:32:58.130 --> 00:32:58.140 align:start position:0%
coordination and also harm reduction
 
00:33:00.049 --> 00:33:00.059 align:start position:0%
principles for people with opioid use
 
00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:03.480 align:start position:0%
disorder which is voluntarily at time of
 
00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
release we offer people naloxone and
 
00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:08.940 align:start position:0%
then the re-entry care coordination is
 
00:33:10.789 --> 00:33:10.799 align:start position:0%
assertive case management 12 months
 
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
post-release that one pilot with women
 
00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
we started with women demonstrated that
 
00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:17.640 align:start position:0%
we helped women navigate through through
 
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
life's challenges Post Release from
 
00:33:21.169 --> 00:33:21.179 align:start position:0%
incarceration and reduce their
 
00:33:23.769 --> 00:33:23.779 align:start position:0%
recidivism rate in the first 12 months
 
00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
that proving concept we then asked in
 
00:33:30.289 --> 00:33:30.299 align:start position:0%
2019 to add two for men and continued to
 
00:33:32.930 --> 00:33:32.940 align:start position:0%
demonstrate its success then this magic
 
00:33:35.389 --> 00:33:35.399 align:start position:0%
year 2020 came along
 
00:33:39.289 --> 00:33:39.299 align:start position:0%
and 2021 and it created some hiccups in
 
00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:41.880 align:start position:0%
the flow of that funding so we have had
 
00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:44.100 align:start position:0%
a hard time retaining those Grant funded
 
00:33:46.669 --> 00:33:46.679 align:start position:0%
positions and have actually asked in the
 
00:33:48.049 --> 00:33:48.059 align:start position:0%
budget process that those become
 
00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:49.740 align:start position:0%
full-time positions because it is
 
00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
definitely an effective tool to help
 
00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
people Post Release which is one of
 
00:33:56.029 --> 00:33:56.039 align:start position:0%
those most stressful times in that first
 
00:33:58.970 --> 00:33:58.980 align:start position:0%
12 months to navigate things I don't
 
00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
know about all of you but I know when I
 
00:34:02.389 --> 00:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
have an issue with my health care and
 
00:34:05.269 --> 00:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
I'm a very resilient person there are a
 
00:34:06.649 --> 00:34:06.659 align:start position:0%
lot of phone calls that you can have to
 
00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:09.419 align:start position:0%
make now put that same small scenario in
 
00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:11.220 align:start position:0%
the hands of somebody who's overcome a
 
00:34:12.829 --> 00:34:12.839 align:start position:0%
lot of those challenges this person is
 
00:34:15.589 --> 00:34:15.599 align:start position:0%
meant to be the partner for that whether
 
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
it's Child Care Resources connectivity
 
00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:19.800 align:start position:0%
to a primary care provider which is
 
00:34:21.470 --> 00:34:21.480 align:start position:0%
almost impossible these days in other
 
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
elements so that is a an answer I will
 
00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:26.820 align:start position:0%
provide you with regard to impacting
 
00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
recidivism absent having that trades
 
00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:30.589 align:start position:0%
recidivism absent having that trades
program

00:34:30.589 --> 00:34:30.599 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
thank you so on page 10
 
00:34:39.409 --> 00:34:39.419 align:start position:0%
um again some more statistics what we
 
00:34:41.149 --> 00:34:41.159 align:start position:0%
provide for you here is the population
 
00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
by maximum sentence what's important in
 
00:34:46.490 --> 00:34:46.500 align:start position:0%
this data is I am not able to calculate
 
00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
those with consecutive sense that means
 
00:34:50.930 --> 00:34:50.940 align:start position:0%
a sentence that they will serve
 
00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:53.220 align:start position:0%
post-completion of what the sentence
 
00:34:55.129 --> 00:34:55.139 align:start position:0%
they're in and they can sometimes be
 
00:34:56.990 --> 00:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
paroled into that consecutive sentence
 
00:34:58.910 --> 00:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
so there's no predictability of when
 
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
they'll be granted that opportunity to
 
00:35:02.329 --> 00:35:02.339 align:start position:0%
Parole in there so it is a
 
00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:04.200 align:start position:0%
straightforward statistic of the
 
00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
sentences people are in now their
 
00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:08.940 align:start position:0%
maximum sentence structure so you'll see
 
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
that the area of between five and ten
 
00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
years and 10 and 20 is indicative of
 
00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:16.980 align:start position:0%
that graphic where I show you the
 
00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:18.060 align:start position:0%
highest percentage of people
 
00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:21.960 align:start position:0%
incarcerated or in for violent crimes
 
00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:23.829 align:start position:0%
incarcerated or in for violent crimes
foreign

00:35:23.829 --> 00:35:23.839 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
McGuire thank you so why is the total on
 
00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:28.980 align:start position:0%
this page different from the total for
 
00:35:31.730 --> 00:35:31.740 align:start position:0%
2021 on the other page very intuitive
 
00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:33.420 align:start position:0%
and smart question representative
 
00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
McGuire because this number includes uh
 
00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:37.980 align:start position:0%
approximately 200 plus individuals that
 
00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:39.780 align:start position:0%
we have housed out of state and we
 
00:35:41.329 --> 00:35:41.339 align:start position:0%
maintain about an average of that number
 
00:35:42.650 --> 00:35:42.660 align:start position:0%
every year
 
00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:44.460 align:start position:0%
the other numbers are physical
 
00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:46.440 align:start position:0%
population and those that we're managing
 
00:35:48.170 --> 00:35:48.180 align:start position:0%
in our care and custody in our New
 
00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:50.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire facilities so let me ask about
 
00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:53.220 align:start position:0%
that so aren't the out-of-state ones a
 
00:35:55.490 --> 00:35:55.500 align:start position:0%
trade you give them one of ours and take
 
00:35:57.410 --> 00:35:57.420 align:start position:0%
one of theirs kind of thing or is it not
 
00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:00.680 align:start position:0%
usually we don't always trade equitably
 
00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:03.660 align:start position:0%
usually and in some of those trades
 
00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
we're actually trading and helping
 
00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
support people on parole through the
 
00:36:10.490 --> 00:36:10.500 align:start position:0%
interstate compact process but we do owe
 
00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
some states some and some States owe us
 
00:36:15.349 --> 00:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
some so it's a it's a distribution
 
00:36:17.569 --> 00:36:17.579 align:start position:0%
system that's not as a perfect art of
 
00:36:17.579 --> 00:36:19.810 align:start position:0%
system that's not as a perfect art of
intent

00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:19.820 align:start position:0%
intent
 
00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
so uh yeah may I follow up so so are you
 
00:36:24.589 --> 00:36:24.599 align:start position:0%
saying we have
 
00:36:27.950 --> 00:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
an extra 200 from out of state or no
 
00:36:30.349 --> 00:36:30.359 align:start position:0%
you're saying an hour 200 or somewhere
 
00:36:31.609 --> 00:36:31.619 align:start position:0%
else yes
 
00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:34.680 align:start position:0%
okay all right thank you and those are
 
00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
almost always related to protective
 
00:36:39.589 --> 00:36:39.599 align:start position:0%
custody issues or uh the amount of
 
00:36:41.569 --> 00:36:41.579 align:start position:0%
violent conduct they've engaged and they
 
00:36:43.870 --> 00:36:43.880 align:start position:0%
need to be in a bigger
 
00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
organization the larger Correctional
 
00:36:49.069 --> 00:36:49.079 align:start position:0%
Facility yeah so when this was explained
 
00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:51.300 align:start position:0%
to me years ago they said when you have
 
00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:53.880 align:start position:0%
a gang who commits a crime you want to
 
00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
put one member of the gang in each div
 
00:36:57.770 --> 00:36:57.780 align:start position:0%
in different prisons you don't have to
 
00:36:59.870 --> 00:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
put them together and that's why some go
 
00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:01.560 align:start position:0%
out of state does that that's a great
 
00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
example yeah
 
00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:37:07.609 --> 00:37:07.619 align:start position:0%
any other questions on page 10.
 
00:37:10.069 --> 00:37:10.079 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:37:10.079 --> 00:37:11.630 align:start position:0%
all right
challenges

00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:11.640 align:start position:0%
challenges
 
00:37:15.290 --> 00:37:15.300 align:start position:0%
page 11 is to highlight our challenges
 
00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:16.190 align:start position:0%
page 11 is to highlight our challenges
um

00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:16.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:19.380 align:start position:0%
our challenges increase significantly in
 
00:37:23.569 --> 00:37:23.579 align:start position:0%
uh 2022 and that was post I would call
 
00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:25.500 align:start position:0%
it a decline of the height of the
 
00:37:28.609 --> 00:37:28.619 align:start position:0%
covid-19 pandemic we had a significant
 
00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
number of our employees choose to retire
 
00:37:33.770 --> 00:37:33.780 align:start position:0%
deservedly they were quite frankly
 
00:37:35.930 --> 00:37:35.940 align:start position:0%
exhausted and had given you know greater
 
00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:38.940 align:start position:0%
than 20 usually greater than 25 years so
 
00:37:42.109 --> 00:37:42.119 align:start position:0%
you'll see that blue hashed column that
 
00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
is pointing downward that number
 
00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:46.680 align:start position:0%
negative 44. so when you look at the
 
00:37:48.290 --> 00:37:48.300 align:start position:0%
previous trended line
 
00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
we started to see a high level of
 
00:37:55.490 --> 00:37:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:58.130 --> 00:37:58.140 align:start position:0%
we track it this way because we want to
 
00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
see the bar graph go above the zero line
 
00:38:04.069 --> 00:38:04.079 align:start position:0%
and you can see that in 2023 we've
 
00:38:06.650 --> 00:38:06.660 align:start position:0%
recruited to date 22 new Corrections
 
00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:07.750 align:start position:0%
recruited to date 22 new Corrections
Officers

00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
Officers
 
00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:10.500 align:start position:0%
we're still challenged I was very proud
 
00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:13.500 align:start position:0%
of us for still recruiting 34 in 2022
 
00:38:15.650 --> 00:38:15.660 align:start position:0%
because recruiting during covid was very
 
00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:17.940 align:start position:0%
difficult but when we were already
 
00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
behind in our staffing Recruitment and
 
00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:22.200 align:start position:0%
challenged with recruiting this did not
 
00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:25.380 align:start position:0%
help this agency and hence why we did at
 
00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:27.240 align:start position:0%
least on two occasions with the support
 
00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
of the governor have the National Guard
 
00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:34.200 align:start position:0%
um there are other positions within the
 
00:38:36.589 --> 00:38:36.599 align:start position:0%
agency that may be smaller in number but
 
00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
their resource is significant and those
 
00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:40.440 align:start position:0%
are our chefs our plumbers our
 
00:38:42.349 --> 00:38:42.359 align:start position:0%
electricians and they've had varying
 
00:38:44.510 --> 00:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
rates of vacancy between 30 and 50
 
00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:45.530 align:start position:0%
rates of vacancy between 30 and 50
percent

00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:45.540 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:38:48.050 --> 00:38:48.060 align:start position:0%
the corrections officer vacancy right
 
00:38:50.329 --> 00:38:50.339 align:start position:0%
now across the whole organization is 50
 
00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:53.820 align:start position:0%
that's the highest I've ever seen it and
 
00:38:56.450 --> 00:38:56.460 align:start position:0%
we are constantly monitoring what we're
 
00:38:58.910 --> 00:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
doing and how we're doing business to
 
00:38:59.870 --> 00:38:59.880 align:start position:0%
make sure we're running a safe
 
00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:01.310 align:start position:0%
make sure we're running a safe
environment

00:39:01.310 --> 00:39:01.320 align:start position:0%
environment
 
00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
one of the challenges we experience as
 
00:39:04.970 --> 00:39:04.980 align:start position:0%
an agency trying to attract new
 
00:39:06.650 --> 00:39:06.660 align:start position:0%
employees is quite frankly the Hampshire
 
00:39:08.210 --> 00:39:08.220 align:start position:0%
state prison for men our largest
 
00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
facility built in 1878.
 
00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am
 
00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:14.220 align:start position:0%
um It's A Hard Sell to sell that
 
00:39:16.970 --> 00:39:16.980 align:start position:0%
facility to people entering law
 
00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:18.540 align:start position:0%
enforcement in their beginning of their
 
00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:19.500 align:start position:0%
career because they interview
 
00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:21.300 align:start position:0%
requirements to be a corrections officer
 
00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
and I'm not advocating to reduce those
 
00:39:24.890 --> 00:39:24.900 align:start position:0%
requirements are the same as a community
 
00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
police officer are now essentially the
 
00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
same as becoming a new state trooper and
 
00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
try to sell being in New Hampshire
 
00:39:34.609 --> 00:39:34.619 align:start position:0%
communities in a lovely new car and
 
00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
engaging in public safety and I'll use
 
00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:39.420 align:start position:0%
myself maybe pulling me over and saying
 
00:39:42.530 --> 00:39:42.540 align:start position:0%
slow down versus come work in the New
 
00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:45.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state prison for men where in
 
00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
our reception and diagnostic area you're
 
00:39:51.349 --> 00:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
you're one the lever away from not being
 
00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
able to open the doors you have no as a
 
00:39:57.050 --> 00:39:57.060 align:start position:0%
staff person no control over your HVAC
 
00:39:59.750 --> 00:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
in the summer it's as hot in your area
 
00:40:01.609 --> 00:40:01.619 align:start position:0%
as it is where the residents live and
 
00:40:02.569 --> 00:40:02.579 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying it should be
 
00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:04.920 align:start position:0%
disproportionate but the reality and
 
00:40:07.490 --> 00:40:07.500 align:start position:0%
what I have heard a lot is these people
 
00:40:09.650 --> 00:40:09.660 align:start position:0%
are incarcerated well the Corrections
 
00:40:11.569 --> 00:40:11.579 align:start position:0%
Officers are not incarcerated and we
 
00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
should be running a Humane Correctional
 
00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:16.020 align:start position:0%
institution and until we can create an
 
00:40:18.530 --> 00:40:18.540 align:start position:0%
environment that Fosters a healthy
 
00:40:20.810 --> 00:40:20.820 align:start position:0%
environment for our staff and as well as
 
00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
those we put into custody we're going to
 
00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:25.260 align:start position:0%
continue to have challenges especially
 
00:40:27.589 --> 00:40:27.599 align:start position:0%
given that's our largest facility so you
 
00:40:29.210 --> 00:40:29.220 align:start position:0%
will see on our capital budget request
 
00:40:30.890 --> 00:40:30.900 align:start position:0%
approximately two and a half million
 
00:40:34.250 --> 00:40:34.260 align:start position:0%
dollars asking to design and find a
 
00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:35.940 align:start position:0%
conceptual Financial path through the
 
00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:37.740 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire to build a new
 
00:40:40.010 --> 00:40:40.020 align:start position:0%
correctional facility for men
 
00:40:42.410 --> 00:40:42.420 align:start position:0%
I go into further detail on those fiscal
 
00:40:45.230 --> 00:40:45.240 align:start position:0%
plant challenges on another slide and
 
00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
quite frankly we built the North Country
 
00:40:50.810 --> 00:40:50.820 align:start position:0%
facility in 2000 so we will need to be
 
00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
mindful to keep that infrastructure
 
00:40:55.250 --> 00:40:55.260 align:start position:0%
stable so we're not you know decades
 
00:40:57.410 --> 00:40:57.420 align:start position:0%
from now in the same place because the
 
00:41:00.829 --> 00:41:00.839 align:start position:0%
approximate cost was 350 million dollars
 
00:41:03.650 --> 00:41:03.660 align:start position:0%
for a new prison and coveted economics
 
00:41:05.690 --> 00:41:05.700 align:start position:0%
that number is no longer the same number
 
00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
it's closer to 500 million dollars
 
00:41:10.910 --> 00:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
we and I have appreciated the support
 
00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
because it is a recognition of this
 
00:41:14.450 --> 00:41:14.460 align:start position:0%
legislature's knowledge of the
 
00:41:15.650 --> 00:41:15.660 align:start position:0%
infrastructure challenges of
 
00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
approximately 10 million 12 million
 
00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:20.220 align:start position:0%
dollars in capital budget Appropriations
 
00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:22.440 align:start position:0%
I'm a basic homeowner that sort of
 
00:41:23.810 --> 00:41:23.820 align:start position:0%
sounds like a mortgage payment for me
 
00:41:26.569 --> 00:41:26.579 align:start position:0%
and a better investment so I just put
 
00:41:29.329 --> 00:41:29.339 align:start position:0%
that out for your awareness and can I
 
00:41:30.770 --> 00:41:30.780 align:start position:0%
answer any questions representative
 
00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:32.930 align:start position:0%
answer any questions representative
hatch

00:41:32.930 --> 00:41:32.940 align:start position:0%
hatch
 
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner and um
 
00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
the North Country facility and the
 
00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:42.060 align:start position:0%
concrete facility is the uh vacancy rate
 
00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:45.960 align:start position:0%
for employees that is uh the same or how
 
00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:47.640 align:start position:0%
much of an interchange is there between
 
00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:51.240 align:start position:0%
the two prisons to address that or is
 
00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:53.160 align:start position:0%
there representative that's a great
 
00:41:55.609 --> 00:41:55.619 align:start position:0%
question and I will talk about some of
 
00:41:57.410 --> 00:41:57.420 align:start position:0%
recruitment strategies we piloted up
 
00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:00.060 align:start position:0%
there they're in a slightly better place
 
00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
but it is not where it should be I won't
 
00:42:05.569 --> 00:42:05.579 align:start position:0%
give you specific vacancy rates by site
 
00:42:07.130 --> 00:42:07.140 align:start position:0%
because that is a safety risk for my
 
00:42:08.930 --> 00:42:08.940 align:start position:0%
institutions but it's an intuitive
 
00:42:11.210 --> 00:42:11.220 align:start position:0%
question and I'll explain in another
 
00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:13.260 align:start position:0%
page okay why they're in a slightly
 
00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:15.240 align:start position:0%
better place I'm sorry to Jump Ahead
 
00:42:17.450 --> 00:42:17.460 align:start position:0%
thank you no chair you you're welcome to
 
00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:21.180 align:start position:0%
do it representative McGuire thank you
 
00:42:25.250 --> 00:42:25.260 align:start position:0%
um The Gray Line here what is that that
 
00:42:27.290 --> 00:42:27.300 align:start position:0%
line is referred to as termed they've
 
00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:29.640 align:start position:0%
terminated their employment with us or
 
00:42:31.370 --> 00:42:31.380 align:start position:0%
we've terminated their employment with
 
00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:33.480 align:start position:0%
us and so what we've been studying for
 
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
several years now is for someone who is
 
00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
making the choice to leave why are they
 
00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
leaving they're leaving in many
 
00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
instances because they're being
 
00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:43.320 align:start position:0%
recruited by other law enforcement
 
00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:47.160 align:start position:0%
departments including the liquor the
 
00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:49.380 align:start position:0%
Sheriff's Department the community
 
00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
police departments and that's one
 
00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:55.020 align:start position:0%
primary recruitment path the other is
 
00:42:57.349 --> 00:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
because of the fiscal plant and the
 
00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:00.540 align:start position:0%
inordinate overtime so that bar we also
 
00:43:02.930 --> 00:43:02.940 align:start position:0%
need that to decrease and the
 
00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:05.220 align:start position:0%
recruitment number to increase so that
 
00:43:08.410 --> 00:43:08.420 align:start position:0%
it equalizes itself
 
00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
yeah so I assume the the um the retirees
 
00:43:15.349 --> 00:43:15.359 align:start position:0%
are somewhere approximately 20 years
 
00:43:18.109 --> 00:43:18.119 align:start position:0%
maybe a little more right right
 
00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
um do you have an average for the termed
 
00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:22.200 align:start position:0%
how many how long they stay
 
00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
yeah we found that if we can get someone
 
00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:26.700 align:start position:0%
to stay greater than three years they
 
00:43:28.849 --> 00:43:28.859 align:start position:0%
generally stay they're leaving within
 
00:43:31.309 --> 00:43:31.319 align:start position:0%
the first and third year in that column
 
00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:36.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
on the following page I think it's
 
00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:40.920 align:start position:0%
important to describe the corrections
 
00:43:43.370 --> 00:43:43.380 align:start position:0%
officer's job because it is a
 
00:43:45.170 --> 00:43:45.180 align:start position:0%
significant job we are asking people to
 
00:43:47.930 --> 00:43:47.940 align:start position:0%
do it is a powerful Mission but it is
 
00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:49.190 align:start position:0%
do it is a powerful Mission but it is
literally

00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
literally
 
00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:52.740 align:start position:0%
um an understated job we ask individuals
 
00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:54.900 align:start position:0%
to go into a Corrections Facility to
 
00:43:56.930 --> 00:43:56.940 align:start position:0%
work with pre-identified people with
 
00:43:56.940 --> 00:43:58.010 align:start position:0%
work with pre-identified people with
felonies

00:43:58.010 --> 00:43:58.020 align:start position:0%
felonies
 
00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:00.060 align:start position:0%
they have felonies they are not
 
00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
Community citizens my Correctional force
 
00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:04.880 align:start position:0%
my Correctional law enforcement group
 
00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
handcuffs people more literally more
 
00:44:11.349 --> 00:44:11.359 align:start position:0%
than our community law enforcement
 
00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
indicative of the environment that
 
00:44:16.069 --> 00:44:16.079 align:start position:0%
they're in and the stress that they are
 
00:44:19.309 --> 00:44:19.319 align:start position:0%
under to be hyper Vigilant every day all
 
00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
day is real and tangible and so I
 
00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:24.300 align:start position:0%
provided some hyperlinks because I think
 
00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:25.560 align:start position:0%
that is an important piece of
 
00:44:27.290 --> 00:44:27.300 align:start position:0%
information that has never truly been
 
00:44:30.130 --> 00:44:30.140 align:start position:0%
imparted up to our legislative members
 
00:44:33.109 --> 00:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
and in fact the life expectancy of a
 
00:44:34.970 --> 00:44:34.980 align:start position:0%
corrections officer is 59 years old
 
00:44:38.450 --> 00:44:38.460 align:start position:0%
compared to the national average of 75.
 
00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:39.829 align:start position:0%
compared to the national average of 75.
yep

00:44:39.829 --> 00:44:39.839 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
so that is why it is so important to
 
00:44:44.809 --> 00:44:44.819 align:start position:0%
have functional
 
00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
Correctional Facilities that are
 
00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
responsive to the staff that we're
 
00:44:51.109 --> 00:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
bringing in there because they're rising
 
00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
to the occasion and I will also share
 
00:44:56.630 --> 00:44:56.640 align:start position:0%
with you and it is not a a dig on
 
00:44:58.849 --> 00:44:58.859 align:start position:0%
anything anyone has said but to refer to
 
00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:01.800 align:start position:0%
a corrections officer as a guard is is a
 
00:45:04.370 --> 00:45:04.380 align:start position:0%
term we have to extinguish it gone are
 
00:45:06.290 --> 00:45:06.300 align:start position:0%
the days that we're just walking through
 
00:45:08.690 --> 00:45:08.700 align:start position:0%
and Counting people they are literally
 
00:45:10.490 --> 00:45:10.500 align:start position:0%
Corrections Officers because they're
 
00:45:13.490 --> 00:45:13.500 align:start position:0%
engaged 24 hours a day and correcting
 
00:45:15.950 --> 00:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
and mentoring people whose patterns in
 
00:45:19.250 --> 00:45:19.260 align:start position:0%
life are not healthy and so I would
 
00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
impart if you could pass that education
 
00:45:24.290 --> 00:45:24.300 align:start position:0%
on we would greatly appreciate it they
 
00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
are professionals and they do a one heck
 
00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:27.960 align:start position:0%
of a job on behalf of the State of New
 
00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:29.030 align:start position:0%
of a job on behalf of the State of New
Hampshire

00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:45:32.270 --> 00:45:32.280 align:start position:0%
and I hope that that number changed I
 
00:45:33.530 --> 00:45:33.540 align:start position:0%
would also share with you as an
 
00:45:36.349 --> 00:45:36.359 align:start position:0%
opportunity we've done a lot now that
 
00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
we're out of the protect against the
 
00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
invisible enemy covid-19 to move forward
 
00:45:43.849 --> 00:45:43.859 align:start position:0%
initiatives around our employee health
 
00:45:46.609 --> 00:45:46.619 align:start position:0%
and wellness program so we've got to
 
00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
have our first Comfort dog operator we
 
00:45:51.650 --> 00:45:51.660 align:start position:0%
have a family service organization a non
 
00:45:54.109 --> 00:45:54.119 align:start position:0%
a non-profit that's been formed we've
 
00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
created employee spaces within our
 
00:45:58.670 --> 00:45:58.680 align:start position:0%
Correctional Facilities that don't look
 
00:46:00.109 --> 00:46:00.119 align:start position:0%
like they're in a correctional facility
 
00:46:02.089 --> 00:46:02.099 align:start position:0%
that give them a place of calm where
 
00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
they can go and decompress laugh if you
 
00:46:08.589 --> 00:46:08.599 align:start position:0%
will we're doing a lot of things
 
00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
I provided in a more colorful packet
 
00:46:13.730 --> 00:46:13.740 align:start position:0%
separate packet a list of every
 
00:46:15.349 --> 00:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and Retention effort we've
 
00:46:17.930 --> 00:46:17.940 align:start position:0%
engaged in and two of the most important
 
00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
things we did was create a recruitment
 
00:46:21.290 --> 00:46:21.300 align:start position:0%
and retention Committee in our North
 
00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
Country representative hatch that'll
 
00:46:25.250 --> 00:46:25.260 align:start position:0%
help explain your question earlier and
 
00:46:27.410 --> 00:46:27.420 align:start position:0%
one in our Southern Tier and that's a
 
00:46:28.970 --> 00:46:28.980 align:start position:0%
mix of not just our corrections officer
 
00:46:30.829 --> 00:46:30.839 align:start position:0%
but all the other Corrections
 
00:46:33.170 --> 00:46:33.180 align:start position:0%
professionals it takes for us to run a
 
00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
community set of services in a
 
00:46:36.290 --> 00:46:36.300 align:start position:0%
correctional facility and we're building
 
00:46:38.569 --> 00:46:38.579 align:start position:0%
off of their ideas and one of those
 
00:46:40.130 --> 00:46:40.140 align:start position:0%
ideas that first started at the North
 
00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
country was to partner any applicant
 
00:46:43.849 --> 00:46:43.859 align:start position:0%
especially in the corrections officer
 
00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
field with another corrections officer
 
00:46:48.230 --> 00:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
so that they can communicate through
 
00:46:49.849 --> 00:46:49.859 align:start position:0%
that law enforcement background check
 
00:46:52.370 --> 00:46:52.380 align:start position:0%
that that takes the time it takes and
 
00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
also keep them engaged and that's worked
 
00:46:57.290 --> 00:46:57.300 align:start position:0%
incredibly well so that's why the North
 
00:46:59.089 --> 00:46:59.099 align:start position:0%
country is slightly ahead we've
 
00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
implemented that in our Southern
 
00:47:03.050 --> 00:47:03.060 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and Retention committee and
 
00:47:05.150 --> 00:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
the leaders on that committee on the
 
00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
security Rank and file have already put
 
00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
10 new people through the physical
 
00:47:10.970 --> 00:47:10.980 align:start position:0%
training process and that's really
 
00:47:12.829 --> 00:47:12.839 align:start position:0%
working so we're hoping to see that tide
 
00:47:14.210 --> 00:47:14.220 align:start position:0%
change here across the whole
 
00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:15.950 align:start position:0%
change here across the whole
organization

00:47:15.950 --> 00:47:15.960 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:47:18.170 --> 00:47:18.180 align:start position:0%
so I share that with you because it's a
 
00:47:20.569 --> 00:47:20.579 align:start position:0%
pretty robust packet that you have you
 
00:47:22.329 --> 00:47:22.339 align:start position:0%
can see we've tried to leave no stone
 
00:47:25.849 --> 00:47:25.859 align:start position:0%
unturned and as you go through it if you
 
00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
have ideas please share them back with
 
00:47:29.270 --> 00:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
the organization we really appreciate
 
00:47:31.370 --> 00:47:31.380 align:start position:0%
everyone's involvement in helping us to
 
00:47:33.410 --> 00:47:33.420 align:start position:0%
find a solution
 
00:47:36.109 --> 00:47:36.119 align:start position:0%
were there questions on the page that I
 
00:47:37.970 --> 00:47:37.980 align:start position:0%
gave the references to on page 12 before
 
00:47:41.690 --> 00:47:41.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:44.569 --> 00:47:44.579 align:start position:0%
I guess the statistics are kind of
 
00:47:48.290 --> 00:47:48.300 align:start position:0%
shocking 59 years versus 75 years as far
 
00:47:50.990 --> 00:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
as life expectancy now you mentioned
 
00:47:53.569 --> 00:47:53.579 align:start position:0%
your Capital request as far as getting
 
00:47:56.329 --> 00:47:56.339 align:start position:0%
the process going for a new Men's prison
 
00:47:59.030 --> 00:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
that's obviously going to take some time
 
00:48:02.569 --> 00:48:02.579 align:start position:0%
but in the short term if you were you
 
00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
know Queen for the day or what would you
 
00:48:09.349 --> 00:48:09.359 align:start position:0%
do to make things better if you had
 
00:48:11.569 --> 00:48:11.579 align:start position:0%
anything one thing that you could do to
 
00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
for retention making things better for
 
00:48:16.550 --> 00:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
the officers Corrections Officers
 
00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
that's a x a question I appreciate the
 
00:48:20.809 --> 00:48:20.819 align:start position:0%
intent in which it was asked
 
00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
I know that the there's a sunset on the
 
00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:26.940 align:start position:0%
state's ability to recruit and create
 
00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
retention incentives on June 30th of
 
00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:32.640 align:start position:0%
2023 I would suggest that that not
 
00:48:36.109 --> 00:48:36.119 align:start position:0%
Sunset I would also suggest that as a
 
00:48:38.349 --> 00:48:38.359 align:start position:0%
state agency and as a state I understand
 
00:48:41.990 --> 00:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
the historical civil role we all play
 
00:48:44.569 --> 00:48:44.579 align:start position:0%
but it is hard to compete with private
 
00:48:44.579 --> 00:48:46.210 align:start position:0%
but it is hard to compete with private
organizations

00:48:46.210 --> 00:48:46.220 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
00:48:49.609 --> 00:48:49.619 align:start position:0%
in trying to recognize our employees I'm
 
00:48:51.589 --> 00:48:51.599 align:start position:0%
not allowed to use State dollars I'm not
 
00:48:54.050 --> 00:48:54.060 align:start position:0%
allowed to throw a barbecue I'm not
 
00:48:56.510 --> 00:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
allowed to do the simple thank yous that
 
00:48:58.609 --> 00:48:58.619 align:start position:0%
our Corrections team needs and I'll give
 
00:49:01.609 --> 00:49:01.619 align:start position:0%
you a great example even if the first
 
00:49:03.650 --> 00:49:03.660 align:start position:0%
week of May if you don't know it every
 
00:49:05.690 --> 00:49:05.700 align:start position:0%
year the first full week of May is
 
00:49:07.790 --> 00:49:07.800 align:start position:0%
Corrections Officers and now Corrections
 
00:49:10.970 --> 00:49:10.980 align:start position:0%
professional week that week is always
 
00:49:12.890 --> 00:49:12.900 align:start position:0%
funded out of the pockets of my
 
00:49:15.109 --> 00:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
leadership which again we do it without
 
00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
complaint we want to support our team
 
00:49:20.510 --> 00:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
our unions step up but no State funds
 
00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
can be used to say thank you I really
 
00:49:25.250 --> 00:49:25.260 align:start position:0%
believe that has to change something
 
00:49:27.650 --> 00:49:27.660 align:start position:0%
reasonable it can just be that one week
 
00:49:29.630 --> 00:49:29.640 align:start position:0%
would say a lot to the corrections
 
00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:31.020 align:start position:0%
professional with regard to the
 
00:49:32.809 --> 00:49:32.819 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and investment that the
 
00:49:34.849 --> 00:49:34.859 align:start position:0%
legislature has made we have to continue
 
00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
to invest in the fiscal plan
 
00:49:40.309 --> 00:49:40.319 align:start position:0%
one of the projects funded through the
 
00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
arpa opportunities is going to actually
 
00:49:45.230 --> 00:49:45.240 align:start position:0%
finally resolve the HVAC system in two
 
00:49:47.390 --> 00:49:47.400 align:start position:0%
of our largest general population units
 
00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
the medium custody north and south and
 
00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
that will actually create equalized air
 
00:49:55.490 --> 00:49:55.500 align:start position:0%
conditioning and airflow during the hot
 
00:49:58.190 --> 00:49:58.200 align:start position:0%
and cold months and that that benefits
 
00:50:01.309 --> 00:50:01.319 align:start position:0%
our staff so those small things make a
 
00:50:01.319 --> 00:50:02.109 align:start position:0%
our staff so those small things make a
difference

00:50:02.109 --> 00:50:02.119 align:start position:0%
difference
 
00:50:05.150 --> 00:50:05.160 align:start position:0%
investing in our training budget our
 
00:50:07.490 --> 00:50:07.500 align:start position:0%
actual Fleet budget all of those things
 
00:50:10.550 --> 00:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
make a difference we have I would say
 
00:50:12.890 --> 00:50:12.900 align:start position:0%
under asked in the last decade for our
 
00:50:15.050 --> 00:50:15.060 align:start position:0%
training resources and the budget I put
 
00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
forward this year asks for what we need
 
00:50:20.750 --> 00:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
to develop our employees and to get our
 
00:50:23.450 --> 00:50:23.460 align:start position:0%
physical items in a place that we're not
 
00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
saying do we use this expired stab
 
00:50:27.589 --> 00:50:27.599 align:start position:0%
resistant vest because we don't have
 
00:50:29.930 --> 00:50:29.940 align:start position:0%
enough money to buy a new one that
 
00:50:31.309 --> 00:50:31.319 align:start position:0%
sounds like the most absurd question
 
00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:33.480 align:start position:0%
someone's ever asked me no we buy a new
 
00:50:35.089 --> 00:50:35.099 align:start position:0%
one because the safety of our staff
 
00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
should be the first and most important
 
00:50:39.109 --> 00:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
thing at the end of the day
 
00:50:41.690 --> 00:50:41.700 align:start position:0%
so I have a question going back to not
 
00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
being able to hold it like a cookout or
 
00:50:47.329 --> 00:50:47.339 align:start position:0%
something I know other agencies and
 
00:50:47.339 --> 00:50:48.890 align:start position:0%
something I know other agencies and
departments

00:50:48.890 --> 00:50:48.900 align:start position:0%
departments
 
00:50:51.530 --> 00:50:51.540 align:start position:0%
do have do they fund that themselves
 
00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
like you've been doing or how does that
 
00:50:56.210 --> 00:50:56.220 align:start position:0%
work that's a great question I know that
 
00:50:58.970 --> 00:50:58.980 align:start position:0%
some have a non-profit partner who's
 
00:51:01.790 --> 00:51:01.800 align:start position:0%
paying for it but other than that I I
 
00:51:04.849 --> 00:51:04.859 align:start position:0%
don't know how they do their finances
 
00:51:07.490 --> 00:51:07.500 align:start position:0%
so is there a Prohibition in the law
 
00:51:09.170 --> 00:51:09.180 align:start position:0%
somewhere that prevents you from doing
 
00:51:12.890 --> 00:51:12.900 align:start position:0%
that yes and in the manual procedures
 
00:51:15.290 --> 00:51:15.300 align:start position:0%
you see we um we have certain events
 
00:51:16.730 --> 00:51:16.740 align:start position:0%
that we can if we bring in an outside
 
00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
speaker and we have an attendance list
 
00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
and that sort of thing it's difficult
 
00:51:21.890 --> 00:51:21.900 align:start position:0%
when we just want to celebrate our own
 
00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
staff for those types of things what the
 
00:51:25.490 --> 00:51:25.500 align:start position:0%
commissioner is getting at when we get
 
00:51:27.710 --> 00:51:27.720 align:start position:0%
when we have a program for instance we
 
00:51:30.650 --> 00:51:30.660 align:start position:0%
can celebrate you know the employees in
 
00:51:31.849 --> 00:51:31.859 align:start position:0%
that way but we have to have an outside
 
00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:33.900 align:start position:0%
speaker we have attendance list and then
 
00:51:35.630 --> 00:51:35.640 align:start position:0%
we might be able to get some pizzas or
 
00:51:36.829 --> 00:51:36.839 align:start position:0%
something like that but there are some
 
00:51:38.390 --> 00:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
rules that we need to follow under the
 
00:51:40.549 --> 00:51:40.559 align:start position:0%
manual procedures that the saddle us
 
00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
with and is that specific to Corrections
 
00:51:46.069 --> 00:51:46.079 align:start position:0%
or to look at that Statewide Statewide
 
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
in uh prior life I worked in the
 
00:51:49.609 --> 00:51:49.619 align:start position:0%
department of transportation we found a
 
00:51:51.410 --> 00:51:51.420 align:start position:0%
way around that with having things like
 
00:51:52.790 --> 00:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
plow rallies you've probably heard of
 
00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
that and other things where we have
 
00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
outside entities come in and there's a
 
00:51:58.130 --> 00:51:58.140 align:start position:0%
lot of volunteer money that comes in
 
00:51:59.829 --> 00:51:59.839 align:start position:0%
from outside entities as well
 
00:52:02.270 --> 00:52:02.280 align:start position:0%
interesting uh kind of look at that I
 
00:52:05.690 --> 00:52:05.700 align:start position:0%
guess yeah if that's in rules the rule
 
00:52:07.609 --> 00:52:07.619 align:start position:0%
would have would
 
00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
reference an RSA probably right where
 
00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:12.720 align:start position:0%
where it generates that we can make sure
 
00:52:15.770 --> 00:52:15.780 align:start position:0%
we send you the citation there yeah I'll
 
00:52:18.170 --> 00:52:18.180 align:start position:0%
give you an example our Teamsters Union
 
00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
I I manage five different unions within
 
00:52:22.970 --> 00:52:22.980 align:start position:0%
the Department of Corrections uh they
 
00:52:25.849 --> 00:52:25.859 align:start position:0%
have negotiated language that allows the
 
00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
department to pay for overtime meals for
 
00:52:31.849 --> 00:52:31.859 align:start position:0%
those working overtime but our SCA
 
00:52:33.890 --> 00:52:33.900 align:start position:0%
sergeants and above don't have the same
 
00:52:36.470 --> 00:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
parallel language so I could buy outside
 
00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:40.200 align:start position:0%
food to say thank you for now providing
 
00:52:44.450 --> 00:52:44.460 align:start position:0%
your 100 150 000 hour of overtime to the
 
00:52:47.089 --> 00:52:47.099 align:start position:0%
teamsters but on the sca sergeants and
 
00:52:50.329 --> 00:52:50.339 align:start position:0%
above I would say you can have what the
 
00:52:52.670 --> 00:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
incarcerated people are eating today
 
00:52:55.790 --> 00:52:55.800 align:start position:0%
seems a little strange
 
00:52:57.890 --> 00:52:57.900 align:start position:0%
Mike and Melissa I saw you writing
 
00:52:59.630 --> 00:52:59.640 align:start position:0%
things down so I'm sure you'll get these
 
00:53:02.569 --> 00:53:02.579 align:start position:0%
references to us and you can take a look
 
00:53:04.490 --> 00:53:04.500 align:start position:0%
I'll also give you the
 
00:53:06.829 --> 00:53:06.839 align:start position:0%
example I have our agency suffered a
 
00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:24.349 align:start position:0%
 
yep

00:53:24.349 --> 00:53:24.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:26.030 --> 00:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
on duty
 
00:53:29.089 --> 00:53:29.099 align:start position:0%
oh take your time I will say we just had
 
00:53:30.770 --> 00:53:30.780 align:start position:0%
in Services yesterday thank you for
 
00:53:34.010 --> 00:53:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:36.230 --> 00:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
we have navigated things as an
 
00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:37.670 align:start position:0%
we have navigated things as an
organization

00:53:37.670 --> 00:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:53:41.030 --> 00:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
through volunteers through generous
 
00:53:44.809 --> 00:53:44.819 align:start position:0%
donations that I believe
 
00:53:47.390 --> 00:53:47.400 align:start position:0%
the state should and could respond
 
00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:48.410 align:start position:0%
the state should and could respond
better

00:53:48.410 --> 00:53:48.420 align:start position:0%
better
 
00:53:50.930 --> 00:53:50.940 align:start position:0%
and making sure funeral services were
 
00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
paid for the honor that we engaged in
 
00:53:55.609 --> 00:53:55.619 align:start position:0%
yesterday with a law enforcement walk
 
00:53:59.150 --> 00:53:59.160 align:start position:0%
through to allow the staff at the
 
00:54:01.549 --> 00:54:01.559 align:start position:0%
department of corrections to grieve and
 
00:54:03.770 --> 00:54:03.780 align:start position:0%
respect and honor this person who gave
 
00:54:03.780 --> 00:54:05.210 align:start position:0%
respect and honor this person who gave
all

00:54:05.210 --> 00:54:05.220 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:54:07.790 --> 00:54:07.800 align:start position:0%
and it is the most poignant example of
 
00:54:10.670 --> 00:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
things should not be this difficult in
 
00:54:13.730 --> 00:54:13.740 align:start position:0%
the most obvious situations and I have
 
00:54:15.349 --> 00:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
followed the statute to the letter as
 
00:54:17.450 --> 00:54:17.460 align:start position:0%
you would expect me to and written a
 
00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
letter to commissioner Quinn to review
 
00:54:22.250 --> 00:54:22.260 align:start position:0%
this as a line of duty death I've also
 
00:54:23.750 --> 00:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
written to commissioner Maryfield under
 
00:54:25.730 --> 00:54:25.740 align:start position:0%
that section of law with the attempt to
 
00:54:28.910 --> 00:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
get the funeral paid for and I sit now
 
00:54:31.309 --> 00:54:31.319 align:start position:0%
and I wait and we have already completed
 
00:54:33.890 --> 00:54:33.900 align:start position:0%
our tasks today I do not think that's
 
00:54:36.650 --> 00:54:36.660 align:start position:0%
just and I do not think that's right
 
00:54:39.710 --> 00:54:39.720 align:start position:0%
no it isn't Michael and Melissa's look
 
00:54:42.410 --> 00:54:42.420 align:start position:0%
at that too please
 
00:54:44.450 --> 00:54:44.460 align:start position:0%
so I thank you for being patient with me
 
00:54:47.390 --> 00:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
no not at all sorry for you appreciate
 
00:54:50.089 --> 00:54:50.099 align:start position:0%
Department's loss thank you and at age
 
00:54:54.109 --> 00:54:54.119 align:start position:0%
43 let me point you back to this age 59
 
00:54:56.030 --> 00:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
that that is just not the lightning
 
00:54:57.710 --> 00:54:57.720 align:start position:0%
strike that should be happening to a 43
 
00:55:01.130 --> 00:55:01.140 align:start position:0%
year old who started with us in 2017 and
 
00:55:03.230 --> 00:55:03.240 align:start position:0%
now as 19 and 16 year old daughter
 
00:55:06.829 --> 00:55:06.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:06.839 --> 00:55:08.089 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:55:08.089 --> 00:55:08.099 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:55:10.190 --> 00:55:10.200 align:start position:0%
changing emotional gears take a minute
 
00:55:12.410 --> 00:55:12.420 align:start position:0%
no I'm gonna push through like I do and
 
00:55:15.609 --> 00:55:15.619 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that offer uh on page 13
 
00:55:18.410 --> 00:55:18.420 align:start position:0%
I'll say you know I've known you but
 
00:55:21.609 --> 00:55:21.619 align:start position:0%
since you took over from Ren and the
 
00:55:24.230 --> 00:55:24.240 align:start position:0%
Department's in such good hands you're
 
00:55:25.790 --> 00:55:25.800 align:start position:0%
one of those department heads that I
 
00:55:28.670 --> 00:55:28.680 align:start position:0%
often Rave about thank you sir again I
 
00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
it's probably a good time to say that
 
00:55:32.089 --> 00:55:32.099 align:start position:0%
that you know we're very fortunate to
 
00:55:33.770 --> 00:55:33.780 align:start position:0%
have you and the staff that you've
 
00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
pulled together and we've seen such a
 
00:55:37.790 --> 00:55:37.800 align:start position:0%
turnaround in correction so we want to
 
00:55:39.470 --> 00:55:39.480 align:start position:0%
make things a little easier here not
 
00:55:41.809 --> 00:55:41.819 align:start position:0%
have you uh go through what you've gone
 
00:55:43.730 --> 00:55:43.740 align:start position:0%
through well I appreciate you for that
 
00:55:45.710 --> 00:55:45.720 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate your accolades it means
 
00:55:47.030 --> 00:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
a lot to me
 
00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:48.170 align:start position:0%
a lot to me
thanks

00:55:48.170 --> 00:55:48.180 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
00:55:50.630 --> 00:55:50.640 align:start position:0%
I want to show you on page 13 one of the
 
00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:51.589 align:start position:0%
I want to show you on page 13 one of the
most

00:55:51.589 --> 00:55:51.599 align:start position:0%
most
 
00:55:55.430 --> 00:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
simple examples of why our agency has
 
00:55:57.890 --> 00:55:57.900 align:start position:0%
not been able to be competitive on the
 
00:56:00.170 --> 00:56:00.180 align:start position:0%
front line base salary
 
00:56:04.549 --> 00:56:04.559 align:start position:0%
these are as of July 15 2022
 
00:56:04.559 --> 00:56:06.049 align:start position:0%
these are as of July 15 2022
the

00:56:06.049 --> 00:56:06.059 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:08.640 align:start position:0%
prevailing wages for all state law
 
00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:10.549 align:start position:0%
prevailing wages for all state law
enforcement

00:56:10.549 --> 00:56:10.559 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
00:56:13.790 --> 00:56:13.800 align:start position:0%
the lowest paid state law enforcement is
 
00:56:15.710 --> 00:56:15.720 align:start position:0%
a corrections officer trainee only
 
00:56:17.210 --> 00:56:17.220 align:start position:0%
second two of fully certified
 
00:56:18.829 --> 00:56:18.839 align:start position:0%
corrections officer
 
00:56:21.470 --> 00:56:21.480 align:start position:0%
I don't share this with you to disparage
 
00:56:24.170 --> 00:56:24.180 align:start position:0%
or attempt to say that the other members
 
00:56:25.849 --> 00:56:25.859 align:start position:0%
of state law enforcement should not be
 
00:56:27.950 --> 00:56:27.960 align:start position:0%
paid what they're paid but I share this
 
00:56:29.390 --> 00:56:29.400 align:start position:0%
with you because
 
00:56:31.010 --> 00:56:31.020 align:start position:0%
previous administration owed the
 
00:56:33.109 --> 00:56:33.119 align:start position:0%
responsibility of taking care of this
 
00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
through the state reallocation process
 
00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:37.670 align:start position:0%
through the state reallocation process
and

00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:56:40.010 --> 00:56:40.020 align:start position:0%
my staff should not be having to work
 
00:56:42.109 --> 00:56:42.119 align:start position:0%
overtime to try to make up the
 
00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
difference right and in addition to the
 
00:56:46.130 --> 00:56:46.140 align:start position:0%
overtime they're having to do because
 
00:56:49.010 --> 00:56:49.020 align:start position:0%
we're Staffing deficient but at the base
 
00:56:52.190 --> 00:56:52.200 align:start position:0%
recruitment we're not even competitive
 
00:56:55.250 --> 00:56:55.260 align:start position:0%
and when the campus Patrol Lieutenant on
 
00:56:58.849 --> 00:56:58.859 align:start position:0%
the State campus is making more than a
 
00:57:02.990 --> 00:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
doc Captain who is overseeing 1100
 
00:57:05.569 --> 00:57:05.579 align:start position:0%
people's lives who are incarcerated and
 
00:57:08.750 --> 00:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
then some hundred plus employees that's
 
00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:11.290 align:start position:0%
then some hundred plus employees that's
disproportionate

00:57:11.290 --> 00:57:11.300 align:start position:0%
disproportionate
 
00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
significantly disproportionate
 
00:57:16.970 --> 00:57:16.980 align:start position:0%
my the warden at the New Hampshire state
 
00:57:19.970 --> 00:57:19.980 align:start position:0%
prison for men who has the largest scope
 
00:57:23.630 --> 00:57:23.640 align:start position:0%
of responsibility makes the same
 
00:57:25.849 --> 00:57:25.859 align:start position:0%
makes less actually as an unclassified
 
00:57:28.130 --> 00:57:28.140 align:start position:0%
employee than the executive major at
 
00:57:29.990 --> 00:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
State Police
 
00:57:32.089 --> 00:57:32.099 align:start position:0%
so I share this with you because I've
 
00:57:33.950 --> 00:57:33.960 align:start position:0%
put forward a reallocation packet to the
 
00:57:36.349 --> 00:57:36.359 align:start position:0%
division of personnel I have to remit to
 
00:57:39.290 --> 00:57:39.300 align:start position:0%
them the series of the major and our
 
00:57:41.410 --> 00:57:41.420 align:start position:0%
Internal Affairs investigator because
 
00:57:43.849 --> 00:57:43.859 align:start position:0%
the state needs to
 
00:57:46.849 --> 00:57:46.859 align:start position:0%
work with the agency to rectify this
 
00:57:50.270 --> 00:57:50.280 align:start position:0%
base problem when I put the wage up
 
00:57:52.490 --> 00:57:52.500 align:start position:0%
the environment up and everything else
 
00:57:54.950 --> 00:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
up those that step forward are really
 
00:57:56.030 --> 00:57:56.040 align:start position:0%
The Honorable
 
00:57:59.329 --> 00:57:59.339 align:start position:0%
and I need to be able to the state needs
 
00:58:01.730 --> 00:58:01.740 align:start position:0%
to be able to recruit equitably those
 
00:58:03.470 --> 00:58:03.480 align:start position:0%
that have to meet the same standards as
 
00:58:05.390 --> 00:58:05.400 align:start position:0%
I referenced before to become based law
 
00:58:07.549 --> 00:58:07.559 align:start position:0%
enforcement with at least the same base
 
00:58:07.559 --> 00:58:08.510 align:start position:0%
enforcement with at least the same base
pay

00:58:08.510 --> 00:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
pay
 
00:58:11.630 --> 00:58:11.640 align:start position:0%
and we don't have that ability today
 
00:58:14.030 --> 00:58:14.040 align:start position:0%
and I have I've heard critics say to me
 
00:58:16.430 --> 00:58:16.440 align:start position:0%
well you have an employee who made 280
 
00:58:18.530 --> 00:58:18.540 align:start position:0%
000 last year yeah they worked five
 
00:58:21.650 --> 00:58:21.660 align:start position:0%
doubles they worked five doubles for 52
 
00:58:24.049 --> 00:58:24.059 align:start position:0%
weeks that is not house one should be
 
00:58:25.910 --> 00:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
making their income I don't know how
 
00:58:28.250 --> 00:58:28.260 align:start position:0%
they do it I know they're awake but
 
00:58:30.650 --> 00:58:30.660 align:start position:0%
that's not healthy and that goes back to
 
00:58:32.510 --> 00:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
those other statistics
 
00:58:34.490 --> 00:58:34.500 align:start position:0%
I think this is a
 
00:58:36.950 --> 00:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
a very transparent way to say we have to
 
00:58:38.390 --> 00:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
fix this problem
 
00:58:42.890 --> 00:58:42.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:45.730 --> 00:58:45.740 align:start position:0%
um do you know how your wage
 
00:58:49.370 --> 00:58:49.380 align:start position:0%
situation relates to counties because I
 
00:58:52.010 --> 00:58:52.020 align:start position:0%
know a lot of counties have similar
 
00:58:55.010 --> 00:58:55.020 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and Retention problems and
 
00:58:57.109 --> 00:58:57.119 align:start position:0%
it's a sad statement but you're probably
 
00:58:59.390 --> 00:58:59.400 align:start position:0%
all kind of competing with each other I
 
00:59:01.250 --> 00:59:01.260 align:start position:0%
just wondered if you had a sense of that
 
00:59:02.809 --> 00:59:02.819 align:start position:0%
representative evil that's a great
 
00:59:04.609 --> 00:59:04.619 align:start position:0%
question the interesting part that
 
00:59:07.130 --> 00:59:07.140 align:start position:0%
separates that recruitment is the County
 
00:59:09.470 --> 00:59:09.480 align:start position:0%
Corrections Officers do not have to meet
 
00:59:12.829 --> 00:59:12.839 align:start position:0%
the entry level requirements that police
 
00:59:14.569 --> 00:59:14.579 align:start position:0%
standards and training Council has
 
00:59:16.130 --> 00:59:16.140 align:start position:0%
established so they don't have to meet
 
00:59:18.289 --> 00:59:18.299 align:start position:0%
the physical training requirements they
 
00:59:19.549 --> 00:59:19.559 align:start position:0%
don't have to meet the background check
 
00:59:21.650 --> 00:59:21.660 align:start position:0%
requirements and they don't have to go
 
00:59:23.930 --> 00:59:23.940 align:start position:0%
through a police standards and training
 
00:59:27.710 --> 00:59:27.720 align:start position:0%
Council Academy and pass that they under
 
00:59:29.089 --> 00:59:29.099 align:start position:0%
police stands and training Council
 
00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
approve the curriculum and it's all
 
00:59:32.630 --> 00:59:32.640 align:start position:0%
managed through the county
 
00:59:34.849 --> 00:59:34.859 align:start position:0%
I think the difference between that
 
00:59:36.770 --> 00:59:36.780 align:start position:0%
recruitment pool is the State Health
 
00:59:38.450 --> 00:59:38.460 align:start position:0%
Benefit is different than the
 
00:59:39.970 --> 00:59:39.980 align:start position:0%
county-based benefit
 
00:59:43.010 --> 00:59:43.020 align:start position:0%
during covid I was definitely competing
 
00:59:44.510 --> 00:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
with the counties because they were
 
00:59:47.089 --> 00:59:47.099 align:start position:0%
quicker on giving covid stipends and
 
00:59:49.849 --> 00:59:49.859 align:start position:0%
things of that nature to I would work on
 
00:59:51.470 --> 00:59:51.480 align:start position:0%
the retention side I'm not sure they
 
00:59:53.349 --> 00:59:53.359 align:start position:0%
were getting a lot of recruitment
 
00:59:57.049 --> 00:59:57.059 align:start position:0%
but those previous differences have at
 
00:59:58.490 --> 00:59:58.500 align:start position:0%
least created that separation of
 
01:00:01.609 --> 01:00:01.619 align:start position:0%
competition everyone is in negotiation
 
01:00:03.890 --> 01:00:03.900 align:start position:0%
across the state I am aware of what some
 
01:00:05.630 --> 01:00:05.640 align:start position:0%
counties have negotiated for base pay
 
01:00:08.630 --> 01:00:08.640 align:start position:0%
and in some of counties negotiate as
 
01:00:11.329 --> 01:00:11.339 align:start position:0%
high as 27 an hour
 
01:00:12.710 --> 01:00:12.720 align:start position:0%
um obviously those numbers will come
 
01:00:14.270 --> 01:00:14.280 align:start position:0%
before the legislature on the state side
 
01:00:16.430 --> 01:00:16.440 align:start position:0%
and someone asked me how will that help
 
01:00:18.530 --> 01:00:18.540 align:start position:0%
your agency I said it moves Us in the
 
01:00:20.690 --> 01:00:20.700 align:start position:0%
same shifting pattern right here it's
 
01:00:22.430 --> 01:00:22.440 align:start position:0%
just a higher number and the same
 
01:00:26.030 --> 01:00:26.040 align:start position:0%
disproportion so again using the state
 
01:00:27.770 --> 01:00:27.780 align:start position:0%
Personnel rule we've put those
 
01:00:29.569 --> 01:00:29.579 align:start position:0%
reallocation packets to the division of
 
01:00:31.609 --> 01:00:31.619 align:start position:0%
personnel who will have to analyze and
 
01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:34.440 align:start position:0%
determine where that labor grade sits
 
01:00:37.010 --> 01:00:37.020 align:start position:0%
um but that's a it's a very frequent
 
01:00:39.530 --> 01:00:39.540 align:start position:0%
question I'm asked thank you
 
01:00:41.930 --> 01:00:41.940 align:start position:0%
any other questions on 13. I guess just
 
01:00:45.049 --> 01:00:45.059 align:start position:0%
to follow up if I could commissioner one
 
01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
thing representative evil and I I'm sure
 
01:00:49.490 --> 01:00:49.500 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin and hatch for me
 
01:00:52.450 --> 01:00:52.460 align:start position:0%
recall this and being here and maybe
 
01:00:54.890 --> 01:00:54.900 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire as well there
 
01:00:56.809 --> 01:00:56.819 align:start position:0%
have been requests by Corrections in the
 
01:00:59.210 --> 01:00:59.220 align:start position:0%
past to lower if you will the standards
 
01:01:01.970 --> 01:01:01.980 align:start position:0%
but we've always resisted that feeling
 
01:01:04.430 --> 01:01:04.440 align:start position:0%
that Corrections offices should be at
 
01:01:05.650 --> 01:01:05.660 align:start position:0%
the same
 
01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
expertise training as corrections I mean
 
01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
as police officers out in the field of
 
01:01:13.549 --> 01:01:13.559 align:start position:0%
course what we need to do is bring them
 
01:01:15.650 --> 01:01:15.660 align:start position:0%
up to the same level of pay to the
 
01:01:18.589 --> 01:01:18.599 align:start position:0%
people up in the field so but that has
 
01:01:19.670 --> 01:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
come before us I don't know if
 
01:01:21.170 --> 01:01:21.180 align:start position:0%
commissioner Hanks has done that I know
 
01:01:23.089 --> 01:01:23.099 align:start position:0%
Rand had requested that on many
 
01:01:26.089 --> 01:01:26.099 align:start position:0%
occasions and we had said no I
 
01:01:28.370 --> 01:01:28.380 align:start position:0%
saw a little history thank you for that
 
01:01:31.010 --> 01:01:31.020 align:start position:0%
history representative McGuire thank you
 
01:01:33.230 --> 01:01:33.240 align:start position:0%
Mr chair where do these numbers come
 
01:01:35.270 --> 01:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
from isn't this a collective bargaining
 
01:01:37.910 --> 01:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
process or something like that so these
 
01:01:40.130 --> 01:01:40.140 align:start position:0%
numbers thank you for that question I
 
01:01:41.930 --> 01:01:41.940 align:start position:0%
pulled these from the state wage
 
01:01:44.030 --> 01:01:44.040 align:start position:0%
schedules and we put them right off the
 
01:01:46.910 --> 01:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
wage schedules there's two ways in which
 
01:01:49.370 --> 01:01:49.380 align:start position:0%
uh wages are established yes through
 
01:01:51.589 --> 01:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining the other is what
 
01:01:53.270 --> 01:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
is referenced in Personnel rule called
 
01:01:55.549 --> 01:01:55.559 align:start position:0%
the reallocation process what is
 
01:01:57.950 --> 01:01:57.960 align:start position:0%
supposed to happen is every year as a
 
01:01:59.329 --> 01:01:59.339 align:start position:0%
state employee you're supposed to have
 
01:02:01.609 --> 01:02:01.619 align:start position:0%
your evaluation completed you're
 
01:02:04.430 --> 01:02:04.440 align:start position:0%
provided your job description and you're
 
01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
supposed to indicate if that job
 
01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
description matches the scope of work
 
01:02:09.470 --> 01:02:09.480 align:start position:0%
that you're doing
 
01:02:12.349 --> 01:02:12.359 align:start position:0%
this agency I've owned this before and
 
01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
taking on this leadership role has not
 
01:02:16.309 --> 01:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
done a good job at that and has never
 
01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
reflected the changes of these security
 
01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
Rank and file through that internal
 
01:02:23.030 --> 01:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
process that's allowed so this is again
 
01:02:24.650 --> 01:02:24.660 align:start position:0%
a decades-long problem that I've
 
01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
identified and I'm trying to rectify
 
01:02:28.789 --> 01:02:28.799 align:start position:0%
through that process so there's two
 
01:02:30.710 --> 01:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
paths to have this type of situation
 
01:02:31.910 --> 01:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
worked but
 
01:02:34.190 --> 01:02:34.200 align:start position:0%
yeah I guess so
 
01:02:36.049 --> 01:02:36.059 align:start position:0%
so I guess you're saying as part of the
 
01:02:38.410 --> 01:02:38.420 align:start position:0%
classification process
 
01:02:42.049 --> 01:02:42.059 align:start position:0%
each job says are you a supervisor or
 
01:02:45.170 --> 01:02:45.180 align:start position:0%
not are you this and that and and that
 
01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
gives us sort of salary range to each
 
01:02:49.549 --> 01:02:49.559 align:start position:0%
job is that is that kind of right and
 
01:02:51.950 --> 01:02:51.960 align:start position:0%
and and Corrections hasn't
 
01:02:54.349 --> 01:02:54.359 align:start position:0%
kind of pushed up these let these
 
01:02:57.109 --> 01:02:57.119 align:start position:0%
particular jobs a little higher is that
 
01:02:59.390 --> 01:02:59.400 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire it's it's an
 
01:03:01.250 --> 01:03:01.260 align:start position:0%
interesting question you asked that took
 
01:03:02.870 --> 01:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
me I think seven years to get an answer
 
01:03:04.910 --> 01:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
to when I started here as a supervisor
 
01:03:07.490 --> 01:03:07.500 align:start position:0%
there is literally an algorithm used by
 
01:03:10.430 --> 01:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
the division of personnel that ranks and
 
01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
scores different areas of everyone's job
 
01:03:16.130 --> 01:03:16.140 align:start position:0%
and that score equals a certain labor
 
01:03:18.410 --> 01:03:18.420 align:start position:0%
grade so the department has to put
 
01:03:20.930 --> 01:03:20.940 align:start position:0%
together a 13-page packet called a
 
01:03:22.609 --> 01:03:22.619 align:start position:0%
reallocation packet
 
01:03:25.130 --> 01:03:25.140 align:start position:0%
submit an updated job description that
 
01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:27.480 align:start position:0%
adjusts and reflects the actual usually
 
01:03:29.210 --> 01:03:29.220 align:start position:0%
there's 10 accountabilities in the scope
 
01:03:31.069 --> 01:03:31.079 align:start position:0%
of your work and the division of
 
01:03:33.829 --> 01:03:33.839 align:start position:0%
personnel's classification unit analyzes
 
01:03:35.870 --> 01:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
that and provides a recommendation back
 
01:03:37.970 --> 01:03:37.980 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the state for what your ask
 
01:03:40.190 --> 01:03:40.200 align:start position:0%
is as an organization so they do that
 
01:03:42.589 --> 01:03:42.599 align:start position:0%
it's not as simple as you described they
 
01:03:44.870 --> 01:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
do a reflective analysis within their
 
01:03:48.349 --> 01:03:48.359 align:start position:0%
scoring grid of your knowledge skills
 
01:03:50.750 --> 01:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
ability Education certification all of
 
01:03:53.630 --> 01:03:53.640 align:start position:0%
those things to affirm what your labor
 
01:03:55.609 --> 01:03:55.619 align:start position:0%
grade and pay should be
 
01:03:55.619 --> 01:03:57.230 align:start position:0%
grade and pay should be
follow

01:03:57.230 --> 01:03:57.240 align:start position:0%
follow
 
01:03:59.690 --> 01:03:59.700 align:start position:0%
yeah so maybe we need a category of
 
01:04:02.690 --> 01:04:02.700 align:start position:0%
stress or something like that right that
 
01:04:05.870 --> 01:04:05.880 align:start position:0%
adds to the to the categories work
 
01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
environment yeah working something like
 
01:04:11.870 --> 01:04:11.880 align:start position:0%
that yeah hazardous yeah
 
01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
so who serves on this classification
 
01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:15.950 align:start position:0%
so who serves on this classification
unit

01:04:15.950 --> 01:04:15.960 align:start position:0%
unit
 
01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
so it is a unit within administrative
 
01:04:21.589 --> 01:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
services division of personnel the state
 
01:04:23.569 --> 01:04:23.579 align:start position:0%
through the division of personnel is
 
01:04:26.089 --> 01:04:26.099 align:start position:0%
working on a larger proposal to change
 
01:04:28.069 --> 01:04:28.079 align:start position:0%
our whole state classification system
 
01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
and as part of that complete proposal
 
01:04:33.890 --> 01:04:33.900 align:start position:0%
that will come before the legislature uh
 
01:04:35.809 --> 01:04:35.819 align:start position:0%
I've remitted those reallocation packets
 
01:04:38.510 --> 01:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
on purpose in tandem so that this can be
 
01:04:40.430 --> 01:04:40.440 align:start position:0%
rectified my goal is through that whole
 
01:04:43.010 --> 01:04:43.020 align:start position:0%
process but it is a unit within the
 
01:04:44.450 --> 01:04:44.460 align:start position:0%
division of personnel under the
 
01:04:47.270 --> 01:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
supervision of director Lori rudis
 
01:04:49.849 --> 01:04:49.859 align:start position:0%
oh interesting
 
01:04:55.010 --> 01:04:55.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:57.109 --> 01:04:57.119 align:start position:0%
um we occasionally have an outside
 
01:05:00.950 --> 01:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
entity coming in and assess the state
 
01:05:02.930 --> 01:05:02.940 align:start position:0%
employees pay I think that was done
 
01:05:05.809 --> 01:05:05.819 align:start position:0%
about four or five years ago
 
01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
um are these wages reflected as part of
 
01:05:10.210 --> 01:05:10.220 align:start position:0%
that or they were not part of that
 
01:05:12.770 --> 01:05:12.780 align:start position:0%
assessment represent match that's a
 
01:05:14.210 --> 01:05:14.220 align:start position:0%
great question there's a published
 
01:05:16.910 --> 01:05:16.920 align:start position:0%
review that was conducted in the last
 
01:05:18.530 --> 01:05:18.540 align:start position:0%
two years and published on the division
 
01:05:20.809 --> 01:05:20.819 align:start position:0%
of personnel's website right what I
 
01:05:22.849 --> 01:05:22.859 align:start position:0%
don't know is what they what did they
 
01:05:25.309 --> 01:05:25.319 align:start position:0%
use to analyze what they believed the
 
01:05:28.370 --> 01:05:28.380 align:start position:0%
difference was was it a comparison of
 
01:05:30.890 --> 01:05:30.900 align:start position:0%
state corrections and Community County
 
01:05:32.690 --> 01:05:32.700 align:start position:0%
Corrections that would be a
 
01:05:34.670 --> 01:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
disproportionate comparison
 
01:05:35.990 --> 01:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
um I don't have any I've asked that
 
01:05:37.250 --> 01:05:37.260 align:start position:0%
question I don't have an answer to it
 
01:05:39.770 --> 01:05:39.780 align:start position:0%
yeah it was only two years ago okay it
 
01:05:41.329 --> 01:05:41.339 align:start position:0%
was and it's published in a PowerPoint
 
01:05:43.549 --> 01:05:43.559 align:start position:0%
right out on their website oh thank you
 
01:05:46.430 --> 01:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:48.530 --> 01:05:48.540 align:start position:0%
while we're talking about money a little
 
01:05:51.710 --> 01:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
more historic fact and Melissa or Mike
 
01:05:53.329 --> 01:05:53.339 align:start position:0%
will correct me if I'm wrong but I
 
01:05:57.049 --> 01:05:57.059 align:start position:0%
believe this uh Department within
 
01:05:59.089 --> 01:05:59.099 align:start position:0%
division one has the largest general
 
01:05:59.099 --> 01:06:00.710 align:start position:0%
division one has the largest general
fund

01:06:00.710 --> 01:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:06:03.950 --> 01:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
grab if you will so this is that's why
 
01:06:05.990 --> 01:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
we spend so much time because it really
 
01:06:12.650 --> 01:06:12.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:14.510 --> 01:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
all right I know you thought I'd never
 
01:06:16.670 --> 01:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
get here but page 14 is about
 
01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:18.410 align:start position:0%
get here but page 14 is about
accomplishments

01:06:18.410 --> 01:06:18.420 align:start position:0%
accomplishments
 
01:06:18.420 --> 01:06:23.329 align:start position:0%
accomplishments
foreign

01:06:23.329 --> 01:06:23.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:25.549 --> 01:06:25.559 align:start position:0%
we are proud that we have made great
 
01:06:27.410 --> 01:06:27.420 align:start position:0%
strides to create an employee specific
 
01:06:29.329 --> 01:06:29.339 align:start position:0%
wellness program
 
01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
um that some of that is described in the
 
01:06:33.770 --> 01:06:33.780 align:start position:0%
secondary packet we've increased our
 
01:06:35.690 --> 01:06:35.700 align:start position:0%
capacity to provide substance use
 
01:06:37.490 --> 01:06:37.500 align:start position:0%
disorder treatment at the highest level
 
01:06:41.150 --> 01:06:41.160 align:start position:0%
of care based on the American Society of
 
01:06:43.849 --> 01:06:43.859 align:start position:0%
addiction medicine because substance use
 
01:06:45.589 --> 01:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
disorder is the number one driver to
 
01:06:48.410 --> 01:06:48.420 align:start position:0%
reincarceration or recidivism
 
01:06:50.630 --> 01:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
we've been always proactive starting as
 
01:06:53.270 --> 01:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
early as 2011 in our engagement in the
 
01:06:55.970 --> 01:06:55.980 align:start position:0%
tree treatment of opioid use disorder at
 
01:06:57.170 --> 01:06:57.180 align:start position:0%
the time referred to as
 
01:06:58.849 --> 01:06:58.859 align:start position:0%
medication-assisted treatment that
 
01:07:00.770 --> 01:07:00.780 align:start position:0%
acronym and statement has changed and
 
01:07:02.510 --> 01:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
the more common reference in the field
 
01:07:04.670 --> 01:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
is the treatment of opioid use disorder
 
01:07:05.930 --> 01:07:05.940 align:start position:0%
through medication
 
01:07:08.569 --> 01:07:08.579 align:start position:0%
we have a multi-level treatment path
 
01:07:11.870 --> 01:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
um we as I mentioned still and do
 
01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:12.910 align:start position:0%
um we as I mentioned still and do
provide

01:07:12.910 --> 01:07:12.920 align:start position:0%
provide
 
01:07:15.349 --> 01:07:15.359 align:start position:0%
naloxone as a voluntary opportunity
 
01:07:17.569 --> 01:07:17.579 align:start position:0%
post-release because the statistics have
 
01:07:19.010 --> 01:07:19.020 align:start position:0%
affirmed in the first 72 hours
 
01:07:21.230 --> 01:07:21.240 align:start position:0%
post-release from incarceration that's
 
01:07:23.630 --> 01:07:23.640 align:start position:0%
the highest risk for overdose for people
 
01:07:25.329 --> 01:07:25.339 align:start position:0%
with this affliction
 
01:07:27.770 --> 01:07:27.780 align:start position:0%
we've been accepted and I'm very proud
 
01:07:30.470 --> 01:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
to representative Evil's questioning and
 
01:07:33.230 --> 01:07:33.240 align:start position:0%
others into the federal Second Chance
 
01:07:35.809 --> 01:07:35.819 align:start position:0%
Pell Grant reinitiative we have
 
01:07:37.370 --> 01:07:37.380 align:start position:0%
partnered with white Mountain Community
 
01:07:41.089 --> 01:07:41.099 align:start position:0%
College as well as nhti I included in
 
01:07:42.829 --> 01:07:42.839 align:start position:0%
this page a graphic that investing in
 
01:07:45.289 --> 01:07:45.299 align:start position:0%
education is one of the and I'm sorry
 
01:07:47.089 --> 01:07:47.099 align:start position:0%
that the visual is not as wonderful I'll
 
01:07:49.370 --> 01:07:49.380 align:start position:0%
send you the whole document investing in
 
01:07:50.930 --> 01:07:50.940 align:start position:0%
education is one of the best things we
 
01:07:53.630 --> 01:07:53.640 align:start position:0%
can do to reduce recidivism so we're
 
01:07:55.130 --> 01:07:55.140 align:start position:0%
creating significant Pathways for
 
01:07:57.289 --> 01:07:57.299 align:start position:0%
post-secondary courses for those who are
 
01:07:59.390 --> 01:07:59.400 align:start position:0%
under our care and custody we've been
 
01:08:01.910 --> 01:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
heavily involved with prisons evolving
 
01:08:04.309 --> 01:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
as connected communities because we have
 
01:08:06.230 --> 01:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
to progress as a Corrections institution
 
01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
and recognize we have to create safe
 
01:08:10.069 --> 01:08:10.079 align:start position:0%
pathways through the internet for people
 
01:08:12.230 --> 01:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
to engage in in and out like college
 
01:08:15.470 --> 01:08:15.480 align:start position:0%
courses so we're heavily involved with
 
01:08:17.570 --> 01:08:17.580 align:start position:0%
that group in addition to participating
 
01:08:19.849 --> 01:08:19.859 align:start position:0%
with the New England Commission on the
 
01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
future of higher education behind bars I
 
01:08:24.169 --> 01:08:24.179 align:start position:0%
myself and my director of rehabilitative
 
01:08:24.179 --> 01:08:25.150 align:start position:0%
myself and my director of rehabilitative
services

01:08:25.150 --> 01:08:25.160 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:08:27.050 --> 01:08:27.060 align:start position:0%
participated in numerous meetings
 
01:08:29.930 --> 01:08:29.940 align:start position:0%
regionally and continue to move the the
 
01:08:31.910 --> 01:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
pathway forward for education and
 
01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:33.110 align:start position:0%
pathway forward for education and
Corrections

01:08:33.110 --> 01:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
Corrections
 
01:08:35.209 --> 01:08:35.219 align:start position:0%
we've also taken the Choose Love
 
01:08:37.550 --> 01:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
programming that's been common in our
 
01:08:39.769 --> 01:08:39.779 align:start position:0%
school systems across the state and
 
01:08:42.229 --> 01:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
worked with a cast who's a organization
 
01:08:44.689 --> 01:08:44.699 align:start position:0%
out of Massachusetts to create this in a
 
01:08:47.269 --> 01:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
Universal Design learning environment
 
01:08:49.729 --> 01:08:49.739 align:start position:0%
for adults and modified this curriculum
 
01:08:52.789 --> 01:08:52.799 align:start position:0%
for corrections to help adults use that
 
01:08:55.309 --> 01:08:55.319 align:start position:0%
same model again to find their own
 
01:08:57.890 --> 01:08:57.900 align:start position:0%
healing and path forward to reduce
 
01:08:59.329 --> 01:08:59.339 align:start position:0%
recidivism and create healthier
 
01:09:02.510 --> 01:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
individuals we've also remitted and I've
 
01:09:04.189 --> 01:09:04.199 align:start position:0%
partnered with director Henry Henry
 
01:09:07.669 --> 01:09:07.679 align:start position:0%
Littman of our Medicaid director ask in
 
01:09:10.189 --> 01:09:10.199 align:start position:0%
our state's 1115a waiver to strengthen
 
01:09:12.650 --> 01:09:12.660 align:start position:0%
the re-entry efforts for people exiting
 
01:09:15.289 --> 01:09:15.299 align:start position:0%
incarcerated settings and again be happy
 
01:09:17.510 --> 01:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
to send you the details of that our goal
 
01:09:19.789 --> 01:09:19.799 align:start position:0%
and hope in the state of California just
 
01:09:22.070 --> 01:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
received approval for their ask from the
 
01:09:24.950 --> 01:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
CMS centers for Medicare and Medicaid
 
01:09:27.410 --> 01:09:27.420 align:start position:0%
services is for there to be some
 
01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
coverage through Medicaid at least 45
 
01:09:32.689 --> 01:09:32.699 align:start position:0%
days prior to release so we can make
 
01:09:34.669 --> 01:09:34.679 align:start position:0%
face-to-face face or Telehealth
 
01:09:37.490 --> 01:09:37.500 align:start position:0%
face-to-face encounters between exiting
 
01:09:39.950 --> 01:09:39.960 align:start position:0%
people their Primary Care Providers and
 
01:09:42.229 --> 01:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
peer-to-peer programming to reduce the
 
01:09:44.349 --> 01:09:44.359 align:start position:0%
use of emergency rooms in Urgent Care
 
01:09:47.090 --> 01:09:47.100 align:start position:0%
the state the legislature did a
 
01:09:48.289 --> 01:09:48.299 align:start position:0%
wonderful thing when you adopted
 
01:09:50.269 --> 01:09:50.279 align:start position:0%
expanded medicaid because it affected
 
01:09:53.209 --> 01:09:53.219 align:start position:0%
the incarcerated population in such a
 
01:09:55.189 --> 01:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
positive way they did not have a barrier
 
01:09:58.070 --> 01:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
Cliff anymore now we've worked for years
 
01:10:00.290 --> 01:10:00.300 align:start position:0%
and years with Medicaid to get people
 
01:10:02.030 --> 01:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
enrolled in their Medicaid prior to
 
01:10:04.550 --> 01:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
release and this effort just strengthens
 
01:10:07.130 --> 01:10:07.140 align:start position:0%
that continuity
 
01:10:08.930 --> 01:10:08.940 align:start position:0%
any questions on this page these are
 
01:10:09.950 --> 01:10:09.960 align:start position:0%
just some highlights of those
 
01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:11.990 align:start position:0%
just some highlights of those
accomplishments

01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
accomplishments
 
01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:10:15.830 --> 01:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
another quick a quick question I I know
 
01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:17.090 align:start position:0%
another quick a quick question I I know
that

01:10:17.090 --> 01:10:17.100 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:10:19.729 --> 01:10:19.739 align:start position:0%
HIPAA and all that prevent all this but
 
01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
there are so many people that are
 
01:10:24.590 --> 01:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
incarcerated for drug issues and then
 
01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
they're released and I like what you're
 
01:10:28.310 --> 01:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
saying here as far as getting them
 
01:10:30.410 --> 01:10:30.420 align:start position:0%
enrolled and so forth
 
01:10:33.169 --> 01:10:33.179 align:start position:0%
you don't ever I know it's allegedly
 
01:10:35.149 --> 01:10:35.159 align:start position:0%
against the rules but you never reach
 
01:10:37.490 --> 01:10:37.500 align:start position:0%
out to a family and say that your son or
 
01:10:39.950 --> 01:10:39.960 align:start position:0%
daughter is being released tomorrow and
 
01:10:41.930 --> 01:10:41.940 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to give you a heads up or
 
01:10:45.770 --> 01:10:45.780 align:start position:0%
I know that's probably so represent
 
01:10:47.689 --> 01:10:47.699 align:start position:0%
leishman that's a great question we've
 
01:10:49.790 --> 01:10:49.800 align:start position:0%
had for greater than 25 years of family
 
01:10:51.890 --> 01:10:51.900 align:start position:0%
connection center program that's really
 
01:10:54.770 --> 01:10:54.780 align:start position:0%
targeted youth who have a an
 
01:10:57.229 --> 01:10:57.239 align:start position:0%
incarcerated parent and we're trying to
 
01:11:00.050 --> 01:11:00.060 align:start position:0%
expand our I'll call it um reintegration
 
01:11:02.390 --> 01:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
with family efforts and I think your
 
01:11:04.490 --> 01:11:04.500 align:start position:0%
question is well stated and we're not
 
01:11:06.050 --> 01:11:06.060 align:start position:0%
quite there yet but it's another area
 
01:11:07.790 --> 01:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
we're trying to kind of flip the stone
 
01:11:10.790 --> 01:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
over we can share that information if we
 
01:11:12.830 --> 01:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
preemptively received a release so that
 
01:11:14.810 --> 01:11:14.820 align:start position:0%
we can engage with who they're going to
 
01:11:17.930 --> 01:11:17.940 align:start position:0%
go live with and help that process I
 
01:11:19.790 --> 01:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
think there's another opportunity to
 
01:11:22.189 --> 01:11:22.199 align:start position:0%
come back during the sooner than the
 
01:11:23.810 --> 01:11:23.820 align:start position:0%
next budget cycle with an accomplishment
 
01:11:25.850 --> 01:11:25.860 align:start position:0%
that helps adults reconnect with the
 
01:11:27.590 --> 01:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
family adult system that they have as
 
01:11:31.490 --> 01:11:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:33.950 --> 01:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
other accomplishments we've seen more
 
01:11:37.189 --> 01:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
recently is our non-corrections officer
 
01:11:38.990 --> 01:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
positions we are
 
01:11:41.330 --> 01:11:41.340 align:start position:0%
attempting the tide on that better this
 
01:11:43.610 --> 01:11:43.620 align:start position:0%
fiscal year so I have the same graphic
 
01:11:46.790 --> 01:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
here that includes everyone who's not
 
01:11:48.709 --> 01:11:48.719 align:start position:0%
certified law enforcement in this graph
 
01:11:51.229 --> 01:11:51.239 align:start position:0%
and that would mean our Behavioral
 
01:11:53.510 --> 01:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
Health clinicians our counselor case
 
01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:55.130 align:start position:0%
Health clinicians our counselor case
managers

01:11:55.130 --> 01:11:55.140 align:start position:0%
managers
 
01:11:55.140 --> 01:11:56.630 align:start position:0%
managers
um

01:11:56.630 --> 01:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:59.689 --> 01:11:59.699 align:start position:0%
our spiritual leaders there's a whole
 
01:12:01.550 --> 01:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
Cadre of individuals Incorporated in
 
01:12:03.590 --> 01:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
here we do have some challenges still on
 
01:12:06.229 --> 01:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
the logistics but we're starting to see
 
01:12:10.310 --> 01:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
a steady increase in those other areas I
 
01:12:11.930 --> 01:12:11.940 align:start position:0%
did include a hyperlink we'll make sure
 
01:12:13.550 --> 01:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
you get this electronically so you can
 
01:12:15.770 --> 01:12:15.780 align:start position:0%
click on it but I did purposely type it
 
01:12:18.770 --> 01:12:18.780 align:start position:0%
all out that last annual report gives
 
01:12:20.750 --> 01:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
some deep dive into all the things we've
 
01:12:23.330 --> 01:12:23.340 align:start position:0%
been doing and doing well including the
 
01:12:25.250 --> 01:12:25.260 align:start position:0%
diversity of mental health groups that
 
01:12:27.410 --> 01:12:27.420 align:start position:0%
we offer and other areas that are
 
01:12:29.270 --> 01:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
significant importance
 
01:12:32.810 --> 01:12:32.820 align:start position:0%
uh including Civic uh volunteerism with
 
01:12:34.669 --> 01:12:34.679 align:start position:0%
those that are under our custody at
 
01:12:36.290 --> 01:12:36.300 align:start position:0%
lower levels of classification that are
 
01:12:38.990 --> 01:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
really helping New Hampshire communities
 
01:12:47.770 --> 01:12:47.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:50.450 --> 01:12:50.460 align:start position:0%
I tried not to use orange in case
 
01:12:55.970 --> 01:12:55.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:57.530 --> 01:12:57.540 align:start position:0%
I wanted to be different than the
 
01:13:03.470 --> 01:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:05.209 --> 01:13:05.219 align:start position:0%
yeah representative McGuire you were
 
01:13:08.209 --> 01:13:08.219 align:start position:0%
always on your toes
 
01:13:10.669 --> 01:13:10.679 align:start position:0%
um on page 16 and if you think of your
 
01:13:13.910 --> 01:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
question please feel free to ask me uh I
 
01:13:16.070 --> 01:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
list all the primary infrastructure
 
01:13:17.689 --> 01:13:17.699 align:start position:0%
challenges specifically for the New
 
01:13:19.669 --> 01:13:19.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state prison for men
 
01:13:21.890 --> 01:13:21.900 align:start position:0%
um I can go into detail there if you
 
01:13:24.470 --> 01:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
would like but uh it's it's a tough
 
01:13:27.970 --> 01:13:27.980 align:start position:0%
situation it's a tough situation
 
01:13:30.770 --> 01:13:30.780 align:start position:0%
representative evil
 
01:13:32.870 --> 01:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
I just want to
 
01:13:35.390 --> 01:13:35.400 align:start position:0%
size what you've said I've seen pictures
 
01:13:38.990 --> 01:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
and we've toured the place and um
 
01:13:42.229 --> 01:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
some of it's just scary yeah some of it
 
01:13:45.470 --> 01:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
is historically scary yeah some we want
 
01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
to show Engineers now how they did it
 
01:13:50.390 --> 01:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
so will we be seeing anything on this
 
01:13:55.010 --> 01:13:55.020 align:start position:0%
list when you come forward I know
 
01:13:56.930 --> 01:13:56.940 align:start position:0%
there's a obviously you already
 
01:14:00.850 --> 01:14:00.860 align:start position:0%
mentioned the plans for the
 
01:14:03.709 --> 01:14:03.719 align:start position:0%
1878 prison but any of these other
 
01:14:06.530 --> 01:14:06.540 align:start position:0%
short-term fixes uh on your list when
 
01:14:08.510 --> 01:14:08.520 align:start position:0%
you come to see us
 
01:14:10.430 --> 01:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
so there's a multitude of challenges
 
01:14:12.830 --> 01:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
here one is we already have 19 million
 
01:14:14.570 --> 01:14:14.580 align:start position:0%
dollars worth of capital budget money
 
01:14:17.270 --> 01:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
right now that currently hasn't been put
 
01:14:19.330 --> 01:14:19.340 align:start position:0%
out to bid someone's in Stillman design
 
01:14:21.709 --> 01:14:21.719 align:start position:0%
that's just for the Concord prison
 
01:14:21.719 --> 01:14:23.270 align:start position:0%
that's just for the Concord prison
itself

01:14:23.270 --> 01:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
itself
 
01:14:25.070 --> 01:14:25.080 align:start position:0%
um what we've seen during covet is the
 
01:14:27.229 --> 01:14:27.239 align:start position:0%
prices just become astronomically high
 
01:14:28.970 --> 01:14:28.980 align:start position:0%
and of course another challenge that we
 
01:14:31.070 --> 01:14:31.080 align:start position:0%
have is that in order to work inside a
 
01:14:34.250 --> 01:14:34.260 align:start position:0%
confined space inside a prison all those
 
01:14:36.350 --> 01:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
staff members need to be for the
 
01:14:37.610 --> 01:14:37.620 align:start position:0%
contractors need to be background
 
01:14:40.850 --> 01:14:40.860 align:start position:0%
checked and a typical day that they work
 
01:14:43.610 --> 01:14:43.620 align:start position:0%
out in a other building outside of a
 
01:14:46.130 --> 01:14:46.140 align:start position:0%
prison might be 10 hours long it's
 
01:14:47.990 --> 01:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
narrowed down to six and seven hours so
 
01:14:49.970 --> 01:14:49.980 align:start position:0%
the bidders are looking at renovation
 
01:14:52.370 --> 01:14:52.380 align:start position:0%
costs approaching two thousand dollars a
 
01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
square foot per square uh per foot
 
01:14:58.070 --> 01:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
that's that's really hurting us at this
 
01:14:59.990 --> 01:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
point so we we do have a number of
 
01:15:01.310 --> 01:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
projects that you're going and you're
 
01:15:03.290 --> 01:15:03.300 align:start position:0%
going to see some more come forward on
 
01:15:06.590 --> 01:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
this list uh we
 
01:15:08.570 --> 01:15:08.580 align:start position:0%
this this is it was a quick bullet
 
01:15:10.250 --> 01:15:10.260 align:start position:0%
points of the ones that we're dealing
 
01:15:12.050 --> 01:15:12.060 align:start position:0%
with right now some of them
 
01:15:13.669 --> 01:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
are worth mentioning
 
01:15:15.350 --> 01:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
this this is the oldest correctional
 
01:15:17.209 --> 01:15:17.219 align:start position:0%
facility in the state 1878 the
 
01:15:18.890 --> 01:15:18.900 align:start position:0%
remodeling was finally complete in the
 
01:15:20.810 --> 01:15:20.820 align:start position:0%
80s the last building was the age
 
01:15:24.229 --> 01:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
building in 1990 that was built for 964
 
01:15:26.390 --> 01:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
inmates as soon as we got in there as
 
01:15:27.709 --> 01:15:27.719 align:start position:0%
commissioner Hanks is alluded to this
 
01:15:29.689 --> 01:15:29.699 align:start position:0%
population started to climb we
 
01:15:31.790 --> 01:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
immediately double bunked everything so
 
01:15:34.370 --> 01:15:34.380 align:start position:0%
the doors locks and windows and floors
 
01:15:37.490 --> 01:15:37.500 align:start position:0%
and bathroom fixtures became overused to
 
01:15:39.350 --> 01:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
a point where we keep coming back and
 
01:15:41.149 --> 01:15:41.159 align:start position:0%
hitting the operating budget for higher
 
01:15:43.610 --> 01:15:43.620 align:start position:0%
and higher amounts to do repairs to all
 
01:15:46.070 --> 01:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
that those facilities uh all that
 
01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
facility so the Concord Men's prison is
 
01:15:50.390 --> 01:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
our biggest challenge right now and as
 
01:15:52.390 --> 01:15:52.400 align:start position:0%
as commissioner Hanks mentioned the
 
01:15:55.669 --> 01:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
hvacc system is not balanced so this
 
01:15:58.010 --> 01:15:58.020 align:start position:0%
morning's call we have a Awards call
 
01:16:01.010 --> 01:16:01.020 align:start position:0%
three times a week and the emphasis is
 
01:16:01.020 --> 01:16:01.850 align:start position:0%
three times a week and the emphasis is
to

01:16:01.850 --> 01:16:01.860 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:16:04.370 --> 01:16:04.380 align:start position:0%
make sure that windows are closed even
 
01:16:06.830 --> 01:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
the top floors were maybe 80 degrees up
 
01:16:09.470 --> 01:16:09.480 align:start position:0%
in those areas yes it's nice to open a
 
01:16:10.970 --> 01:16:10.980 align:start position:0%
window and let it cool down a little bit
 
01:16:12.890 --> 01:16:12.900 align:start position:0%
on days like we have coming right now
 
01:16:14.750 --> 01:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to freeze some pipes so we
 
01:16:15.950 --> 01:16:15.960 align:start position:0%
have a
 
01:16:18.709 --> 01:16:18.719 align:start position:0%
Entourage of people ready to to come in
 
01:16:20.570 --> 01:16:20.580 align:start position:0%
to fix those things over the next couple
 
01:16:22.970 --> 01:16:22.980 align:start position:0%
of days if we do get some freezing it's
 
01:16:25.130 --> 01:16:25.140 align:start position:0%
just not an energy efficient facility we
 
01:16:27.530 --> 01:16:27.540 align:start position:0%
spend over 1.1 million dollars in
 
01:16:30.430 --> 01:16:30.440 align:start position:0%
electricity a year we spend over
 
01:16:33.290 --> 01:16:33.300 align:start position:0%
755 thousand dollars in natural gas a
 
01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:34.010 align:start position:0%
755 thousand dollars in natural gas a
year

01:16:34.010 --> 01:16:34.020 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:16:38.090 --> 01:16:38.100 align:start position:0%
uh that's you know 63 000 a month for
 
01:16:40.189 --> 01:16:40.199 align:start position:0%
water and sewer that and that's because
 
01:16:43.310 --> 01:16:43.320 align:start position:0%
it's just inefficient to that point with
 
01:16:45.950 --> 01:16:45.960 align:start position:0%
60 million gallons of water a year in
 
01:16:48.350 --> 01:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
that facility we use nowhere near that
 
01:16:50.450 --> 01:16:50.460 align:start position:0%
in the women's facility or in Berlin
 
01:16:52.610 --> 01:16:52.620 align:start position:0%
because we just have so many leaks and
 
01:16:54.470 --> 01:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
so many things to take care of
 
01:16:56.510 --> 01:16:56.520 align:start position:0%
and as I put in some of the I look down
 
01:16:58.970 --> 01:16:58.980 align:start position:0%
through here and I use some some
 
01:17:01.729 --> 01:17:01.739 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire lingo there the arch brick
 
01:17:03.950 --> 01:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
systems that I have camera views on
 
01:17:07.610 --> 01:17:07.620 align:start position:0%
that's comes from the old systems that
 
01:17:09.229 --> 01:17:09.239 align:start position:0%
were put in place off North State Street
 
01:17:10.729 --> 01:17:10.739 align:start position:0%
which was farmland
 
01:17:13.669 --> 01:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
and basically we put a prison there and
 
01:17:15.370 --> 01:17:15.380 align:start position:0%
until 1910 there was no electricity
 
01:17:17.689 --> 01:17:17.699 align:start position:0%
that's the era we're talking about in
 
01:17:21.110 --> 01:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
comparison 1908 the naval prison was
 
01:17:23.510 --> 01:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
built in Portsmouth and you can see that
 
01:17:26.209 --> 01:17:26.219 align:start position:0%
now we're older than Olive
 
01:17:28.490 --> 01:17:28.500 align:start position:0%
that information is provided it's very
 
01:17:30.530 --> 01:17:30.540 align:start position:0%
helpful could you not to give you
 
01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
anything else to do but give us like a
 
01:17:34.750 --> 01:17:34.760 align:start position:0%
breakdown like you mentioned the
 
01:17:37.790 --> 01:17:37.800 align:start position:0%
electrical cost the propane costs and
 
01:17:40.550 --> 01:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
maybe the comparison between the
 
01:17:43.189 --> 01:17:43.199 align:start position:0%
millions of gallons that you you know
 
01:17:45.470 --> 01:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
take in but don't seem to get out of the
 
01:17:47.390 --> 01:17:47.400 align:start position:0%
system type of thing but just that would
 
01:17:49.370 --> 01:17:49.380 align:start position:0%
be a very good fact sheet for us that's
 
01:17:50.930 --> 01:17:50.940 align:start position:0%
probably going to prepare it For Your
 
01:17:53.630 --> 01:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
Right presentation to public works at
 
01:17:58.250 --> 01:17:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:00.830 --> 01:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
all right on page 17
 
01:18:02.570 --> 01:18:02.580 align:start position:0%
um again some highlights but the packet
 
01:18:04.729 --> 01:18:04.739 align:start position:0%
I provided you as a separate really
 
01:18:07.250 --> 01:18:07.260 align:start position:0%
dives into it the unique things we have
 
01:18:10.010 --> 01:18:10.020 align:start position:0%
done is to create a Corrections uh level
 
01:18:12.130 --> 01:18:12.140 align:start position:0%
high school curricula that is
 
01:18:14.990 --> 01:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
implemented in the Berlin high school as
 
01:18:16.790 --> 01:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
well as now Groveton and we're hoping
 
01:18:19.370 --> 01:18:19.380 align:start position:0%
that we can find a southern tiered High
 
01:18:20.810 --> 01:18:20.820 align:start position:0%
School partner to again teach what
 
01:18:23.209 --> 01:18:23.219 align:start position:0%
Corrections is and what Corrections is
 
01:18:26.649 --> 01:18:26.659 align:start position:0%
not we are not reality TV we are not
 
01:18:29.149 --> 01:18:29.159 align:start position:0%
many of the shows that get pushed out
 
01:18:32.450 --> 01:18:32.460 align:start position:0%
through our digital media outlets and
 
01:18:36.350 --> 01:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
and movies so it was very important and
 
01:18:38.390 --> 01:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
to represent the hatch previous question
 
01:18:41.270 --> 01:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
that's been another pathway post high
 
01:18:44.750 --> 01:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
school for mature ready high school
 
01:18:46.550 --> 01:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
graduates to come and work at the
 
01:18:49.550 --> 01:18:49.560 align:start position:0%
northern Correctional Facility in 2022
 
01:18:52.490 --> 01:18:52.500 align:start position:0%
we did 63 job fairs and speaking
 
01:18:55.030 --> 01:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
engagements and we've already done 91
 
01:18:59.090 --> 01:18:59.100 align:start position:0%
year-to-date calendar year today in 2023
 
01:19:01.490 --> 01:19:01.500 align:start position:0%
uh so we're really pushing that forward
 
01:19:04.669 --> 01:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
I've reallocated uh temporarily a
 
01:19:07.729 --> 01:19:07.739 align:start position:0%
sergeant to do recruitment as a pilot to
 
01:19:09.830 --> 01:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
see if that was helping us it has helped
 
01:19:12.530 --> 01:19:12.540 align:start position:0%
us so I will look to make that a more
 
01:19:14.270 --> 01:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
stable intervention and resource for the
 
01:19:16.550 --> 01:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
department and make that more part-time
 
01:19:20.149 --> 01:19:20.159 align:start position:0%
full-time and expand the use of that we
 
01:19:22.310 --> 01:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
did also create actual part-time
 
01:19:24.530 --> 01:19:24.540 align:start position:0%
certification to be a corrections
 
01:19:26.689 --> 01:19:26.699 align:start position:0%
officer that is not a retiree coming
 
01:19:28.310 --> 01:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
back with the support of police stands
 
01:19:30.410 --> 01:19:30.420 align:start position:0%
and training Council but it creates a
 
01:19:32.649 --> 01:19:32.659 align:start position:0%
limited Duty opportunity
 
01:19:35.930 --> 01:19:35.940 align:start position:0%
to be part-time maybe a college student
 
01:19:38.750 --> 01:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
maybe someone that's not sure this is a
 
01:19:41.689 --> 01:19:41.699 align:start position:0%
29 hour a week certification that would
 
01:19:44.030 --> 01:19:44.040 align:start position:0%
put them in non-direct supervision but
 
01:19:45.590 --> 01:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
opportunities to help us with our post
 
01:19:47.570 --> 01:19:47.580 align:start position:0%
requirement and hopefully turn that
 
01:19:49.370 --> 01:19:49.380 align:start position:0%
part-time employee into a full-time
 
01:19:51.590 --> 01:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
employee so we're hoping to see that
 
01:19:54.050 --> 01:19:54.060 align:start position:0%
program come to fruition we have the
 
01:19:55.850 --> 01:19:55.860 align:start position:0%
permission for the curriculum and
 
01:19:57.530 --> 01:19:57.540 align:start position:0%
certification through police stands and
 
01:19:58.669 --> 01:19:58.679 align:start position:0%
training Council
 
01:20:01.370 --> 01:20:01.380 align:start position:0%
we also uh if you haven't liked us
 
01:20:04.070 --> 01:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
hearted us care handed us on all those
 
01:20:05.930 --> 01:20:05.940 align:start position:0%
social media Outlets some of which I
 
01:20:07.310 --> 01:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
don't even know the names of but
 
01:20:10.669 --> 01:20:10.679 align:start position:0%
LinkedIn Facebook Twitter you name it
 
01:20:12.470 --> 01:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
um we're putting things out there I
 
01:20:14.030 --> 01:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
share that with you with a little
 
01:20:16.130 --> 01:20:16.140 align:start position:0%
comedic just because even I can grow in
 
01:20:18.350 --> 01:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
that space But I think there's also a
 
01:20:19.790 --> 01:20:19.800 align:start position:0%
lot of great information we're putting
 
01:20:21.050 --> 01:20:21.060 align:start position:0%
out there about what the department is
 
01:20:23.630 --> 01:20:23.640 align:start position:0%
doing uh doing well and what we're up to
 
01:20:26.030 --> 01:20:26.040 align:start position:0%
so we've been using those I think a lot
 
01:20:28.669 --> 01:20:28.679 align:start position:0%
more effectively we did a complete
 
01:20:30.290 --> 01:20:30.300 align:start position:0%
quality improvement analysis of the
 
01:20:32.209 --> 01:20:32.219 align:start position:0%
hiring process to make sure we've taken
 
01:20:34.790 --> 01:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
out all unnecessary stops and steps and
 
01:20:37.010 --> 01:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
things that slow things down and that's
 
01:20:40.729 --> 01:20:40.739 align:start position:0%
making great strides
 
01:20:43.370 --> 01:20:43.380 align:start position:0%
on page eight oh any questions on that
 
01:20:44.990 --> 01:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
page again there's a robust document
 
01:20:47.689 --> 01:20:47.699 align:start position:0%
that gets into details even further
 
01:20:51.649 --> 01:20:51.659 align:start position:0%
on page 18 uh this is our overtime spend
 
01:20:53.510 --> 01:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
I think the important thing to point out
 
01:20:56.030 --> 01:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
in 2023 even though that number is
 
01:20:58.910 --> 01:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
projected to be 18.5 we're doing that
 
01:21:01.070 --> 01:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
with less people than we did in the year
 
01:21:03.709 --> 01:21:03.719 align:start position:0%
prior and the year prior to that in
 
01:21:06.169 --> 01:21:06.179 align:start position:0%
addition to I've safely created training
 
01:21:07.790 --> 01:21:07.800 align:start position:0%
opportunities for our Correctional line
 
01:21:10.310 --> 01:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
Personnel those are individuals who work
 
01:21:13.550 --> 01:21:13.560 align:start position:0%
in our 24 7 facilities as Corrections
 
01:21:15.290 --> 01:21:15.300 align:start position:0%
professionals who have group two law
 
01:21:17.450 --> 01:21:17.460 align:start position:0%
enforcement retirement entitlement who
 
01:21:19.790 --> 01:21:19.800 align:start position:0%
are being trained to also voluntarily
 
01:21:23.030 --> 01:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
pick posts that we've identified such as
 
01:21:26.149 --> 01:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
non-arm control rooms triaging and doing
 
01:21:29.630 --> 01:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
observation for people who are in a
 
01:21:33.290 --> 01:21:33.300 align:start position:0%
mental health watch to help decrease the
 
01:21:35.390 --> 01:21:35.400 align:start position:0%
burden on our certified law enforcement
 
01:21:38.390 --> 01:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
staff in addition to that we've just
 
01:21:40.669 --> 01:21:40.679 align:start position:0%
recently threw some guidance with the
 
01:21:42.050 --> 01:21:42.060 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office created a
 
01:21:44.510 --> 01:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
release for our other corrections
 
01:21:46.729 --> 01:21:46.739 align:start position:0%
employees to again be trained in those
 
01:21:49.189 --> 01:21:49.199 align:start position:0%
safe areas and choose to voluntarily
 
01:21:51.470 --> 01:21:51.480 align:start position:0%
fill posts if they so choose to so we're
 
01:21:53.570 --> 01:21:53.580 align:start position:0%
trying to maximize our whole staff who
 
01:21:55.610 --> 01:21:55.620 align:start position:0%
want to participate in reducing the
 
01:21:57.770 --> 01:21:57.780 align:start position:0%
burden on our certified Corrections
 
01:21:57.780 --> 01:21:59.950 align:start position:0%
burden on our certified Corrections
Officers

01:21:59.950 --> 01:21:59.960 align:start position:0%
Officers
 
01:22:03.110 --> 01:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
we did take the opportunity in July of
 
01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:05.030 align:start position:0%
we did take the opportunity in July of
2021

01:22:05.030 --> 01:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
2021
 
01:22:08.390 --> 01:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
in July of 2021 to shut down the second
 
01:22:11.149 --> 01:22:11.159 align:start position:0%
floor of Hancock building because of the
 
01:22:13.189 --> 01:22:13.199 align:start position:0%
reduction in population I was able to
 
01:22:15.890 --> 01:22:15.900 align:start position:0%
say we don't need to use those 194 beds
 
01:22:19.310 --> 01:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
we will move people around and maximize
 
01:22:21.530 --> 01:22:21.540 align:start position:0%
other spaces and that helped us reduce
 
01:22:24.649 --> 01:22:24.659 align:start position:0%
our post requirement daily by 14 posts
 
01:22:26.750 --> 01:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
so we took to maximize many of those
 
01:22:28.669 --> 01:22:28.679 align:start position:0%
opportunities including at the women's
 
01:22:30.669 --> 01:22:30.679 align:start position:0%
prison our population was low enough
 
01:22:33.229 --> 01:22:33.239 align:start position:0%
that's not the fact today but it was for
 
01:22:35.450 --> 01:22:35.460 align:start position:0%
some time we were able to shut down one
 
01:22:38.030 --> 01:22:38.040 align:start position:0%
of the 56 bed general population units
 
01:22:39.890 --> 01:22:39.900 align:start position:0%
and again that reduced that Daily Post
 
01:22:42.290 --> 01:22:42.300 align:start position:0%
requirement by five so we've we've
 
01:22:45.050 --> 01:22:45.060 align:start position:0%
leveraged the population reduction to
 
01:22:47.990 --> 01:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
try to balance our staffing reduction
 
01:22:52.130 --> 01:22:52.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:54.890 --> 01:22:54.900 align:start position:0%
um any questions on that page
 
01:22:56.990 --> 01:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
the very oh go ahead
 
01:22:59.149 --> 01:22:59.159 align:start position:0%
do you recall how many times you've had
 
01:23:01.669 --> 01:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
to come to fiscal for a transfer to
 
01:23:04.490 --> 01:23:04.500 align:start position:0%
handle over time I know it's best we try
 
01:23:06.290 --> 01:23:06.300 align:start position:0%
to give you enough money for overtime we
 
01:23:09.709 --> 01:23:09.719 align:start position:0%
never seem to do that or how much money
 
01:23:12.110 --> 01:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
perhaps well represent policeman that's
 
01:23:13.910 --> 01:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
a great question because what we asked
 
01:23:16.310 --> 01:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
for several budget Cycles ago was a
 
01:23:18.950 --> 01:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
footnote that allowed us to move within
 
01:23:21.649 --> 01:23:21.659 align:start position:0%
the lines that are funded for for vacant
 
01:23:23.990 --> 01:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
positions that's been a very successful
 
01:23:26.410 --> 01:23:26.420 align:start position:0%
footnote for us to use that balance
 
01:23:29.209 --> 01:23:29.219 align:start position:0%
instead of saying we the agency are
 
01:23:31.310 --> 01:23:31.320 align:start position:0%
going to ask for 18 million dollars it's
 
01:23:34.250 --> 01:23:34.260 align:start position:0%
almost a hopeless ask to our staff it
 
01:23:35.689 --> 01:23:35.699 align:start position:0%
like says we're never going to try to
 
01:23:38.030 --> 01:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
fix the problem but when the legislature
 
01:23:40.189 --> 01:23:40.199 align:start position:0%
supported the other methodology has
 
01:23:42.950 --> 01:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
allowed us to make those balances we
 
01:23:45.890 --> 01:23:45.900 align:start position:0%
have generally come twice a year through
 
01:23:48.050 --> 01:23:48.060 align:start position:0%
that process and we will be coming in
 
01:23:50.810 --> 01:23:50.820 align:start position:0%
March to make a large transfer
 
01:23:56.030 --> 01:23:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:57.709 --> 01:23:57.719 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:24:00.410 --> 01:24:00.420 align:start position:0%
so on page 19 knowing today was an
 
01:24:02.689 --> 01:24:02.699 align:start position:0%
agency overview day I did give you a
 
01:24:04.850 --> 01:24:04.860 align:start position:0%
glimpse of what we had asked for through
 
01:24:06.770 --> 01:24:06.780 align:start position:0%
the governor's phase of the budget I do
 
01:24:08.209 --> 01:24:08.219 align:start position:0%
want to point out some areas of
 
01:24:11.209 --> 01:24:11.219 align:start position:0%
significance the medical payments to
 
01:24:13.490 --> 01:24:13.500 align:start position:0%
Providers we do expect to come back
 
01:24:15.709 --> 01:24:15.719 align:start position:0%
before fiscal this year because the
 
01:24:17.450 --> 01:24:17.460 align:start position:0%
forecasting on medical in the last
 
01:24:20.689 --> 01:24:20.699 align:start position:0%
bienum budget was far too low and costs
 
01:24:22.610 --> 01:24:22.620 align:start position:0%
for health care has increased
 
01:24:25.010 --> 01:24:25.020 align:start position:0%
significantly areas such as having
 
01:24:27.050 --> 01:24:27.060 align:start position:0%
enough nursing staff as well as our
 
01:24:29.149 --> 01:24:29.159 align:start position:0%
contract with our contracted medical and
 
01:24:31.250 --> 01:24:31.260 align:start position:0%
psychiatric provider did result in
 
01:24:33.350 --> 01:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
significant increases and other things
 
01:24:34.970 --> 01:24:34.980 align:start position:0%
that will spell out when I'm before
 
01:24:37.970 --> 01:24:37.980 align:start position:0%
fiscal so we try to recognize that in
 
01:24:39.590 --> 01:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
our medical payments to provide our line
 
01:24:42.050 --> 01:24:42.060 align:start position:0%
You'll see that go up as well as our
 
01:24:44.810 --> 01:24:44.820 align:start position:0%
impacts on heat electricity and water
 
01:24:47.330 --> 01:24:47.340 align:start position:0%
new to us as we move forward through the
 
01:24:50.450 --> 01:24:50.460 align:start position:0%
financing process will be a footnote ask
 
01:24:52.729 --> 01:24:52.739 align:start position:0%
regarding coming back if our utilities
 
01:24:54.830 --> 01:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
line is not sufficient given what
 
01:24:57.290 --> 01:24:57.300 align:start position:0%
director Hansen just shared with you and
 
01:25:00.590 --> 01:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
this escalating costs on utilities
 
01:25:02.689 --> 01:25:02.699 align:start position:0%
the other thing you'll see is the
 
01:25:04.310 --> 01:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
equipment line higher than it's been
 
01:25:07.490 --> 01:25:07.500 align:start position:0%
before we have depreciated equipment and
 
01:25:09.590 --> 01:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
we need to rectify that and give our
 
01:25:11.390 --> 01:25:11.400 align:start position:0%
staff the equipment resources they need
 
01:25:13.790 --> 01:25:13.800 align:start position:0%
to be successful so those are some key
 
01:25:16.250 --> 01:25:16.260 align:start position:0%
lines I bring to your attention based on
 
01:25:18.350 --> 01:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
the information and the process I've
 
01:25:20.209 --> 01:25:20.219 align:start position:0%
gone through so far
 
01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
I didn't know if you wanted to go dive
 
01:25:23.630 --> 01:25:23.640 align:start position:0%
any more deeper or wait till I come back
 
01:25:26.450 --> 01:25:26.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:29.689 --> 01:25:29.699 align:start position:0%
all right I'll save that representative
 
01:25:32.570 --> 01:25:32.580 align:start position:0%
McGuire thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:25:35.090 --> 01:25:35.100 align:start position:0%
um on the salary and benefits line do
 
01:25:37.490 --> 01:25:37.500 align:start position:0%
you do you have an idea of roughly how
 
01:25:40.430 --> 01:25:40.440 align:start position:0%
much of that what percentage of that is
 
01:25:43.610 --> 01:25:43.620 align:start position:0%
salary and retirement costs
 
01:25:46.189 --> 01:25:46.199 align:start position:0%
versus other Medical
 
01:25:48.350 --> 01:25:48.360 align:start position:0%
I guess would be the main other part of
 
01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:52.010 align:start position:0%
I guess would be the main other part of
that

01:25:52.010 --> 01:25:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:54.530 --> 01:25:54.540 align:start position:0%
we'll get that answered okay because the
 
01:25:56.570 --> 01:25:56.580 align:start position:0%
reason I'm thinking about that is
 
01:25:58.669 --> 01:25:58.679 align:start position:0%
because when there's overtime the
 
01:26:00.709 --> 01:26:00.719 align:start position:0%
medical doesn't change but the other
 
01:26:03.229 --> 01:26:03.239 align:start position:0%
things do change right yeah right okay
 
01:26:04.790 --> 01:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
we'll get that bridge there all right
 
01:26:07.010 --> 01:26:07.020 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:26:09.709 --> 01:26:09.719 align:start position:0%
so with that I'm sure I possibly didn't
 
01:26:12.050 --> 01:26:12.060 align:start position:0%
cover everything I appreciated your
 
01:26:14.030 --> 01:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
questions and I will Avail myself to any
 
01:26:18.189 --> 01:26:18.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:22.070 --> 01:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
I wrote down a couple of them so
 
01:26:27.649 --> 01:26:27.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:32.330 --> 01:26:32.340 align:start position:0%
which is the the crime term yeah the
 
01:26:35.149 --> 01:26:35.159 align:start position:0%
distribution by crime so when we heard
 
01:26:38.030 --> 01:26:38.040 align:start position:0%
from the Judiciary drug I asked them the
 
01:26:40.490 --> 01:26:40.500 align:start position:0%
question what fraction of cases involved
 
01:26:42.950 --> 01:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
drugs and it was something like I don't
 
01:26:46.010 --> 01:26:46.020 align:start position:0%
remember it was 60 or 80 percent it was
 
01:26:48.470 --> 01:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
some very large number but on your page
 
01:26:51.649 --> 01:26:51.659 align:start position:0%
here they're 11 so what's why is that
 
01:26:54.050 --> 01:26:54.060 align:start position:0%
different I I believe it's the drug
 
01:26:56.209 --> 01:26:56.219 align:start position:0%
court and implementation they're not
 
01:26:58.370 --> 01:26:58.380 align:start position:0%
always turning to incarceration as the
 
01:27:00.010 --> 01:27:00.020 align:start position:0%
intervention in the case
 
01:27:02.390 --> 01:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
and they also could be turning to
 
01:27:04.610 --> 01:27:04.620 align:start position:0%
probation and probation wouldn't show up
 
01:27:06.169 --> 01:27:06.179 align:start position:0%
on this chart because this represents
 
01:27:08.149 --> 01:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
people who are sentenced and
 
01:27:11.270 --> 01:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
incarcerated in a facility
 
01:27:13.910 --> 01:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
so this big blue line there were no
 
01:27:16.669 --> 01:27:16.679 align:start position:0%
drugs at all involved in the case or
 
01:27:19.250 --> 01:27:19.260 align:start position:0%
it's just not the main thing they were
 
01:27:21.410 --> 01:27:21.420 align:start position:0%
they were you know like I understand
 
01:27:22.430 --> 01:27:22.440 align:start position:0%
what you're saying because you can be
 
01:27:23.990 --> 01:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
charged with multiple offenses right
 
01:27:26.030 --> 01:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
that you could be a drug dealer who
 
01:27:27.709 --> 01:27:27.719 align:start position:0%
kills another drug dealer so that's
 
01:27:30.470 --> 01:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
murder right then therefore
 
01:27:32.689 --> 01:27:32.699 align:start position:0%
so the answer is it's the it is the
 
01:27:35.149 --> 01:27:35.159 align:start position:0%
latter so your primary index offense is
 
01:27:38.149 --> 01:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
how you're coded in this chart again so
 
01:27:39.770 --> 01:27:39.780 align:start position:0%
to give you a point of reference there
 
01:27:42.770 --> 01:27:42.780 align:start position:0%
are almost 600 men incarcerated for
 
01:27:45.950 --> 01:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
uh acts against uh aggravated sexual
 
01:27:47.950 --> 01:27:47.960 align:start position:0%
assault felony sexual assault we have a
 
01:27:51.110 --> 01:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
180 approximate individuals that are in
 
01:27:54.169 --> 01:27:54.179 align:start position:0%
war murder uh second degree things that
 
01:27:56.930 --> 01:27:56.940 align:start position:0%
not assault but homicide things of that
 
01:27:56.940 --> 01:27:58.129 align:start position:0%
not assault but homicide things of that
nature

01:27:58.129 --> 01:27:58.139 align:start position:0%
nature
 
01:28:02.450 --> 01:28:02.460 align:start position:0%
okay it's a mess yeah thank you so 600
 
01:28:06.350 --> 01:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
sexual assault is is that included
 
01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:08.209 align:start position:0%

adults versus children or yep it does
 
01:28:14.270 --> 01:28:14.280 align:start position:0%
and but I will let you know through my
 
01:28:16.970 --> 01:28:16.980 align:start position:0%
analysis of the those cases it's most a
 
01:28:18.350 --> 01:28:18.360 align:start position:0%
higher percentage are against minors
 
01:28:20.990 --> 01:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
than adults wow all right thank you
 
01:28:25.970 --> 01:28:25.980 align:start position:0%

cost of taxpayers in a manner that
 
03:04:24.410 --> 03:04:24.420 align:start position:0%

on the third slide in terms of taxpayer
 
03:04:42.650 --> 03:04:42.660 align:start position:0%

rims in a few more slides
 
03:06:28.610 --> 03:06:28.620 align:start position:0%
page six the audit division a lot of
 
03:06:30.230 --> 03:06:30.240 align:start position:0%

an in-state Bureau which audits uh New
 
03:06:49.910 --> 03:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire only taxpayers so your smaller
 
03:06:53.469 --> 03:06:53.479 align:start position:0%
mom and pop type businesses a
 
03:06:56.330 --> 03:06:56.340 align:start position:0%
multi-entity bureau that Bureau is
 
03:06:58.130 --> 03:06:58.140 align:start position:0%
responsible for more of the regional
 
03:06:59.990 --> 03:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
businesses so say a business that
 
03:07:02.690 --> 03:07:02.700 align:start position:0%
operates within New England
 
03:07:04.790 --> 03:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
um the multi-entity Auditors will audit
 
03:07:06.349 --> 03:07:06.359 align:start position:0%
that business and then we have our
 
03:07:08.990 --> 03:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
multi-state Bureau and their audits are
 
03:07:10.790 --> 03:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
primarily focused on the large Fortune
 
03:07:12.950 --> 03:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
500 companies
 
03:07:15.170 --> 03:07:15.180 align:start position:0%
we also have a tobacco and Nexus unit
 
03:07:17.750 --> 03:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
and those folks research federal and
 
03:07:22.490 --> 03:07:22.500 align:start position:0%
state filings to identify non-filers so
 
03:07:24.590 --> 03:07:24.600 align:start position:0%
um we'll use some federal data or state
 
03:07:26.510 --> 03:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
data from other agencies to identify
 
03:07:28.130 --> 03:07:28.140 align:start position:0%
folks who may have an obligation with
 
03:07:30.469 --> 03:07:30.479 align:start position:0%
the dra for which we don't have a return
 
03:07:32.929 --> 03:07:32.939 align:start position:0%
and we'll reach out to them and try to
 
03:07:34.370 --> 03:07:34.380 align:start position:0%
make sure that they file a return if
 
03:07:37.550 --> 03:07:37.560 align:start position:0%
need be commissioner I think last
 
03:07:40.070 --> 03:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
session we gave you more money for
 
03:07:42.650 --> 03:07:42.660 align:start position:0%
Auditors like to the audit the larger
 
03:07:44.690 --> 03:07:44.700 align:start position:0%
businesses were you able to hire folks
 
03:07:46.790 --> 03:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
and how did that work out we have hired
 
03:07:48.590 --> 03:07:48.600 align:start position:0%
some although we do have some vacancies
 
03:07:50.750 --> 03:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
as everyone knows we have our facing
 
03:07:53.330 --> 03:07:53.340 align:start position:0%
hiring challenges like anyone else and
 
03:07:55.309 --> 03:07:55.319 align:start position:0%
those are really our top level Auditors
 
03:07:57.469 --> 03:07:57.479 align:start position:0%
so they can be a little bit harder to
 
03:07:59.210 --> 03:07:59.220 align:start position:0%
hire but we've picked up at least two or
 
03:08:01.670 --> 03:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
three over the past couple years so that
 
03:08:04.070 --> 03:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
is good and you're correct there is with
 
03:08:07.190 --> 03:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
those multi-state Auditors there is
 
03:08:09.590 --> 03:08:09.600 align:start position:0%
um typically a return on investment for
 
03:08:11.269 --> 03:08:11.279 align:start position:0%
the additional position does also bring
 
03:08:13.429 --> 03:08:13.439 align:start position:0%
in Revenue to offset the cost of the
 
03:08:13.439 --> 03:08:14.210 align:start position:0%
in Revenue to offset the cost of the
position

03:08:14.210 --> 03:08:14.220 align:start position:0%
position
 
03:08:16.250 --> 03:08:16.260 align:start position:0%
now you touched on something as far as
 
03:08:19.130 --> 03:08:19.140 align:start position:0%
your ability to hire people are you down
 
03:08:21.469 --> 03:08:21.479 align:start position:0%
like a significant number of folks at
 
03:08:23.929 --> 03:08:23.939 align:start position:0%
your department our vacancy rate has
 
03:08:27.170 --> 03:08:27.180 align:start position:0%
kind of hovered around 15 percent we
 
03:08:28.730 --> 03:08:28.740 align:start position:0%
have had some successes as I've
 
03:08:30.230 --> 03:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned with hiring and then you'll
 
03:08:32.450 --> 03:08:32.460 align:start position:0%
also hear in some of the later slides
 
03:08:33.889 --> 03:08:33.899 align:start position:0%
when we talk about our new technology
 
03:08:36.469 --> 03:08:36.479 align:start position:0%
system rims has allowed us to kind of
 
03:08:39.410 --> 03:08:39.420 align:start position:0%
still do a very efficient job even with
 
03:08:42.170 --> 03:08:42.180 align:start position:0%
those those vacancies so we've been able
 
03:08:43.910 --> 03:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
to continue our operations I don't
 
03:08:45.769 --> 03:08:45.779 align:start position:0%
believe we've seen a significant impact
 
03:08:47.809 --> 03:08:47.819 align:start position:0%
our folks are working really hard
 
03:08:50.269 --> 03:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
certainly additional if we were to fill
 
03:08:51.830 --> 03:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
some vacancies it would relieve a little
 
03:08:54.110 --> 03:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
bit of pressure but we're able to
 
03:08:55.969 --> 03:08:55.979 align:start position:0%
function at this point
 
03:08:59.510 --> 03:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
any other questions as we move along no
 
03:09:01.849 --> 03:09:01.859 align:start position:0%
okay thank you okay sure
 
03:09:04.490 --> 03:09:04.500 align:start position:0%
on slide seven the collections division
 
03:09:06.530 --> 03:09:06.540 align:start position:0%
so this division initiates collection
 
03:09:09.050 --> 03:09:09.060 align:start position:0%
activities in pursuit of delinquent tax
 
03:09:11.090 --> 03:09:11.100 align:start position:0%
returns and outstanding payments for all
 
03:09:14.090 --> 03:09:14.100 align:start position:0%
the taxes that we administer so after a
 
03:09:16.130 --> 03:09:16.140 align:start position:0%
taxpayer's appeal rights
 
03:09:18.950 --> 03:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
um have passed and the the debt is final
 
03:09:20.929 --> 03:09:20.939 align:start position:0%
the collections division are the folks
 
03:09:22.309 --> 03:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
that will contact them and try to
 
03:09:25.370 --> 03:09:25.380 align:start position:0%
negotiate payment plans and the like in
 
03:09:27.410 --> 03:09:27.420 align:start position:0%
order to collect the revenue
 
03:09:29.570 --> 03:09:29.580 align:start position:0%
this division also monitors the monthly
 
03:09:31.190 --> 03:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
filings of the meals and rentals tax
 
03:09:34.250 --> 03:09:34.260 align:start position:0%
returns they issue tobacco licenses and
 
03:09:36.769 --> 03:09:36.779 align:start position:0%
meals or rentals tax licenses and also
 
03:09:39.769 --> 03:09:39.779 align:start position:0%
sells tobacco tax stamps question from
 
03:09:48.010 --> 03:09:48.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:50.769 --> 03:09:50.779 align:start position:0%
of airbnbs
 
03:09:54.230 --> 03:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
and other individuals that are renting
 
03:09:57.290 --> 03:09:57.300 align:start position:0%
primary homes for weekends that seems to
 
03:09:59.389 --> 03:09:59.399 align:start position:0%
be more and more prevalent how do you
 
03:10:01.490 --> 03:10:01.500 align:start position:0%
track those
 
03:10:04.550 --> 03:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
so there's kind of two options if you um
 
03:10:05.870 --> 03:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
own a home
 
03:10:08.030 --> 03:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
um that you rent on the weekends
 
03:10:10.790 --> 03:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
um if you own if you rent that
 
03:10:13.429 --> 03:10:13.439 align:start position:0%
um home you know on your own say through
 
03:10:15.830 --> 03:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
Facebook posts or newspaper listings you
 
03:10:17.090 --> 03:10:17.100 align:start position:0%
would need a meals and rentals tax
 
03:10:19.130 --> 03:10:19.140 align:start position:0%
license and you would collect the tax
 
03:10:20.870 --> 03:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
from the people staying at your home and
 
03:10:23.210 --> 03:10:23.220 align:start position:0%
remit it to us on a monthly basis
 
03:10:25.790 --> 03:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
if you rent your property through either
 
03:10:28.190 --> 03:10:28.200 align:start position:0%
a rental agent or through an online
 
03:10:31.309 --> 03:10:31.319 align:start position:0%
platform like an Airbnb or a verbo
 
03:10:33.889 --> 03:10:33.899 align:start position:0%
something like that typically those
 
03:10:36.110 --> 03:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
operators will collect and remit the tax
 
03:10:38.809 --> 03:10:38.819 align:start position:0%
on your behalf so you don't have to do
 
03:10:40.730 --> 03:10:40.740 align:start position:0%
that individually and you would operate
 
03:10:43.070 --> 03:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
under their own license
 
03:10:45.349 --> 03:10:45.359 align:start position:0%
so I guess if I may Mr chair a little
 
03:10:46.910 --> 03:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
more interested in those that do it on
 
03:10:51.290 --> 03:10:51.300 align:start position:0%
their own without uh Airbnb Airbnb type
 
03:10:54.410 --> 03:10:54.420 align:start position:0%
so how how do you monitor those because
 
03:10:57.110 --> 03:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
there's no formal entity that they're
 
03:10:59.929 --> 03:10:59.939 align:start position:0%
working through so so the advertisements
 
03:11:02.090 --> 03:11:02.100 align:start position:0%
there is a requirement in the statute
 
03:11:03.889 --> 03:11:03.899 align:start position:0%
that the advertisements should show
 
03:11:06.830 --> 03:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
their m r license number that went into
 
03:11:09.830 --> 03:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
place a few years ago as a way an easier
 
03:11:12.230 --> 03:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
way for us and other folks to identify
 
03:11:15.230 --> 03:11:15.240 align:start position:0%
that that operator is operating under
 
03:11:18.110 --> 03:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
the laws and statutes of the state so if
 
03:11:20.389 --> 03:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
I may are you still month and you
 
03:11:23.330 --> 03:11:23.340 align:start position:0%
monitor app for ads We Will We Will okay
 
03:11:25.610 --> 03:11:25.620 align:start position:0%
and we also have and I'll show this a
 
03:11:27.530 --> 03:11:27.540 align:start position:0%
little bit later too but there is um
 
03:11:30.290 --> 03:11:30.300 align:start position:0%
ways that we have a tax fraud
 
03:11:32.389 --> 03:11:32.399 align:start position:0%
um online form for people to fill out
 
03:11:34.670 --> 03:11:34.680 align:start position:0%
anonymously so if there's a concern that
 
03:11:36.590 --> 03:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
your neighbor might be renting out their
 
03:11:38.570 --> 03:11:38.580 align:start position:0%
property and not following the laws you
 
03:11:40.849 --> 03:11:40.859 align:start position:0%
can submit um Anonymous referrals and we
 
03:11:43.790 --> 03:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
get those from time to time as well
 
03:11:47.330 --> 03:11:47.340 align:start position:0%
sure so how often does that happen did
 
03:11:49.550 --> 03:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
you get a neighbor saying that someone
 
03:11:53.150 --> 03:11:53.160 align:start position:0%
it happens with somewhat regularly yep
 
03:11:55.550 --> 03:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
it's a nice easy online form
 
03:11:58.130 --> 03:11:58.140 align:start position:0%
um and
 
03:11:58.140 --> 03:11:58.790 align:start position:0%
um and
um

03:11:58.790 --> 03:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:01.490 --> 03:12:01.500 align:start position:0%
and and we we will follow up and pursue
 
03:12:03.170 --> 03:12:03.180 align:start position:0%
those to make sure
 
03:12:06.110 --> 03:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
um that it is either licensed properly
 
03:12:07.610 --> 03:12:07.620 align:start position:0%
or not and if it's not we'll work with
 
03:12:12.290 --> 03:12:12.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:16.130 --> 03:12:16.140 align:start position:0%
okay moving on to slide eight
 
03:12:18.889 --> 03:12:18.899 align:start position:0%
the municipal and property division so
 
03:12:20.809 --> 03:12:20.819 align:start position:0%
the division establishes and improves
 
03:12:23.150 --> 03:12:23.160 align:start position:0%
Municipal School County and Village
 
03:12:26.389 --> 03:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
District tax rates so we set all tax
 
03:12:28.910 --> 03:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
rates uh proper local property tax rates
 
03:12:31.190 --> 03:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire we also
 
03:12:33.050 --> 03:12:33.060 align:start position:0%
provide technical assistance in training
 
03:12:35.389 --> 03:12:35.399 align:start position:0%
in Municipal and budgeting and finance
 
03:12:37.429 --> 03:12:37.439 align:start position:0%
for municipalities
 
03:12:41.030 --> 03:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
we Monitor reappraisals and certify tax
 
03:12:43.370 --> 03:12:43.380 align:start position:0%
assessors the folks that are out in your
 
03:12:45.050 --> 03:12:45.060 align:start position:0%
communities determining the assessed
 
03:12:47.150 --> 03:12:47.160 align:start position:0%
value of your properties
 
03:12:49.870 --> 03:12:49.880 align:start position:0%
we equalize locally assessed values of
 
03:12:53.330 --> 03:12:53.340 align:start position:0%
municipalities to full level so this is
 
03:12:54.830 --> 03:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
something that's come up frequently in
 
03:12:56.630 --> 03:12:56.640 align:start position:0%
the past couple years of as we've seen
 
03:12:59.830 --> 03:12:59.840 align:start position:0%
such dramatic changes in property values
 
03:13:02.269 --> 03:13:02.279 align:start position:0%
municipalities are only required to
 
03:13:03.950 --> 03:13:03.960 align:start position:0%
reassess properties do a full
 
03:13:06.710 --> 03:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
revaluation every five years
 
03:13:08.990 --> 03:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
when we've seen what we have in the in
 
03:13:10.849 --> 03:13:10.859 align:start position:0%
the recent years where within a
 
03:13:12.769 --> 03:13:12.779 align:start position:0%
five-year period values can change
 
03:13:15.290 --> 03:13:15.300 align:start position:0%
rather dramatically the point of this
 
03:13:17.690 --> 03:13:17.700 align:start position:0%
Equalization process is to bring all
 
03:13:19.309 --> 03:13:19.319 align:start position:0%
properties within the state to full
 
03:13:21.650 --> 03:13:21.660 align:start position:0%
market value
 
03:13:23.929 --> 03:13:23.939 align:start position:0%
we also appraise public utilities and
 
03:13:25.610 --> 03:13:25.620 align:start position:0%
railroad property for the administration
 
03:13:28.370 --> 03:13:28.380 align:start position:0%
of those taxes we administer the
 
03:13:30.769 --> 03:13:30.779 align:start position:0%
Timberland the Graver Timber and gravel
 
03:13:32.990 --> 03:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
taxes also known as Sticks and Stones
 
03:13:35.929 --> 03:13:35.939 align:start position:0%
those are two taxes that are collected
 
03:13:39.530 --> 03:13:39.540 align:start position:0%
uh Baidu municipalities but the dra has
 
03:13:41.630 --> 03:13:41.640 align:start position:0%
experts in both of those areas and so we
 
03:13:43.370 --> 03:13:43.380 align:start position:0%
assist the municipalities in the
 
03:13:46.070 --> 03:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
administration of those taxes
 
03:13:48.590 --> 03:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
and we provide a statutory support to
 
03:13:50.690 --> 03:13:50.700 align:start position:0%
two different administratively attached
 
03:13:52.849 --> 03:13:52.859 align:start position:0%
boards the assessing Standards Board and
 
03:13:56.030 --> 03:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:58.490 --> 03:13:58.500 align:start position:0%
on slide 9 our taxpayer services
 
03:14:01.130 --> 03:14:01.140 align:start position:0%
division this is the division that kind
 
03:14:04.550 --> 03:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
of handles all routine interactions for
 
03:14:06.650 --> 03:14:06.660 align:start position:0%
taxpayers in the department so they
 
03:14:08.750 --> 03:14:08.760 align:start position:0%

03:14:10.610 --> 03:14:10.620 align:start position:0%
documents so they process all of the
 
03:14:12.469 --> 03:14:12.479 align:start position:0%
returns that come in and a lot
 
03:14:14.929 --> 03:14:14.939 align:start position:0%
electronic transactions and payments
 
03:14:17.750 --> 03:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
they manage our forms development for
 
03:14:19.969 --> 03:14:19.979 align:start position:0%
forms that are filed with the dra and
 
03:14:21.650 --> 03:14:21.660 align:start position:0%

03:14:40.849 --> 03:14:40.859 align:start position:0%
about their accounts they perform the
 
03:14:42.650 --> 03:14:42.660 align:start position:0%
account maintenance
 
03:14:44.630 --> 03:14:44.640 align:start position:0%
the last area that I wanted to highlight
 
03:14:45.830 --> 03:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
is the Department of Information
 
03:14:49.730 --> 03:14:49.740 align:start position:0%
Technology we have embedded Personnel at
 
03:14:52.429 --> 03:14:52.439 align:start position:0%
the dra that are critical obviously to
 
03:14:54.530 --> 03:14:54.540 align:start position:0%
the technology and functions that we
 
03:14:54.540 --> 03:14:57.650 align:start position:0%
the technology and functions that we
perform

03:14:57.650 --> 03:14:57.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:01.250 --> 03:15:01.260 align:start position:0%
on slide 10 we are the primary tax
 
03:15:04.190 --> 03:15:04.200 align:start position:0%
collector for the state so taxes
 
03:15:06.469 --> 03:15:06.479 align:start position:0%
administered by the dra we collected
 
03:15:08.990 --> 03:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
collect just under three billion dollars
 
03:15:11.690 --> 03:15:11.700 align:start position:0%
in Revenue I've listed out I won't walk
 
03:15:12.950 --> 03:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
through all of them but for easy
 
03:15:14.690 --> 03:15:14.700 align:start position:0%
reference I've listed out all of the
 
03:15:16.969 --> 03:15:16.979 align:start position:0%
taxes that we administer the current
 
03:15:19.190 --> 03:15:19.200 align:start position:0%
rate of that tax and then the associated
 
03:15:22.250 --> 03:15:22.260 align:start position:0%
statute I will just mention we do not
 
03:15:24.710 --> 03:15:24.720 align:start position:0%
collect the insurance premium tax the
 
03:15:27.349 --> 03:15:27.359 align:start position:0%
beer tax or the road toll also known as
 
03:15:28.849 --> 03:15:28.859 align:start position:0%
the gas tax
 
03:15:31.130 --> 03:15:31.140 align:start position:0%
but basically everything else runs
 
03:15:37.670 --> 03:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:41.510 --> 03:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
2.9 billion is this a um biennium or an
 
03:15:44.809 --> 03:15:44.819 align:start position:0%
annual annual I see all right thank you
 
03:15:48.050 --> 03:15:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:50.389 --> 03:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
that 2.9 billion is broken out on slide
 
03:15:54.590 --> 03:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
11 so you can see by tax type how we
 
03:15:56.809 --> 03:15:56.819 align:start position:0%
arrived at that number business taxes
 
03:15:59.870 --> 03:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
are obviously the largest portion but
 
03:16:02.630 --> 03:16:02.640 align:start position:0%
we've included everything here again as
 
03:16:05.389 --> 03:16:05.399 align:start position:0%
an easy reference and then on slide 12
 
03:16:07.490 --> 03:16:07.500 align:start position:0%
there's a nice pie chart if you prefer
 
03:16:10.969 --> 03:16:10.979 align:start position:0%
to look at things that way as well
 
03:16:13.429 --> 03:16:13.439 align:start position:0%
um that 2.9
 
03:16:13.439 --> 03:16:14.110 align:start position:0%
um that 2.9
um

03:16:14.110 --> 03:16:14.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:16:17.389 --> 03:16:17.399 align:start position:0%
2.9 billion is roughly 80 percent of the
 
03:16:19.790 --> 03:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
general and education trust fund
 
03:16:22.490 --> 03:16:22.500 align:start position:0%
um so again we are the primary revenue
 
03:16:25.610 --> 03:16:25.620 align:start position:0%
collectors for the general and education
 
03:16:28.370 --> 03:16:28.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:31.010 --> 03:16:31.020 align:start position:0%
on slide 13 we'll talk a little bit
 
03:16:34.250 --> 03:16:34.260 align:start position:0%
about rims so rims is our Revenue
 
03:16:37.130 --> 03:16:37.140 align:start position:0%
information management system
 
03:16:40.429 --> 03:16:40.439 align:start position:0%
we received a 30 million one hundred and
 
03:16:41.750 --> 03:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
sixty thousand dollar Capital
 
03:16:44.330 --> 03:16:44.340 align:start position:0%
appropriation through General funds and
 
03:16:47.330 --> 03:16:47.340 align:start position:0%
other funds funds to replace our aging
 
03:16:50.630 --> 03:16:50.640 align:start position:0%
tax information management system also
 
03:16:52.309 --> 03:16:52.319 align:start position:0%
known as Tims
 
03:16:56.809 --> 03:16:56.819 align:start position:0%
Tim's was implemented in 1990 it was a
 
03:17:00.530 --> 03:17:00.540 align:start position:0%
black screen green flashing cursor no
 
03:17:02.630 --> 03:17:02.640 align:start position:0%
ability to use a mouse it was all
 
03:17:06.170 --> 03:17:06.180 align:start position:0%
function keys so it it had served us
 
03:17:08.389 --> 03:17:08.399 align:start position:0%
well for many years but it had certainly
 
03:17:11.210 --> 03:17:11.220 align:start position:0%
reached the end of its life it was
 
03:17:14.570 --> 03:17:14.580 align:start position:0%
limited in in its functionality it was
 
03:17:16.010 --> 03:17:16.020 align:start position:0%
um causing some concerns about
 
03:17:18.710 --> 03:17:18.720 align:start position:0%
reliability usefulness and security of
 
03:17:22.370 --> 03:17:22.380 align:start position:0%
taxpayer data so we went forward with
 
03:17:25.429 --> 03:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
modernizing with rims rims is used not
 
03:17:28.010 --> 03:17:28.020 align:start position:0%
only by the dra but also with tax
 
03:17:32.030 --> 03:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
practitioners and taxpayers as well
 
03:17:35.450 --> 03:17:35.460 align:start position:0%
we implemented rims in partnership with
 
03:17:38.269 --> 03:17:38.279 align:start position:0%
doit and it is a complete back-end
 
03:17:40.490 --> 03:17:40.500 align:start position:0%
technology system which houses and
 
03:17:43.309 --> 03:17:43.319 align:start position:0%
Consolidated all of our taxpayer data so
 
03:17:45.469 --> 03:17:45.479 align:start position:0%
Tim's when we were operating under that
 
03:17:48.170 --> 03:17:48.180 align:start position:0%
system only had our largest tax types
 
03:17:50.929 --> 03:17:50.939 align:start position:0%
and the other taxes lived in disparate
 
03:17:54.769 --> 03:17:54.779 align:start position:0%
systems access databases Etc rims now
 
03:17:57.050 --> 03:17:57.060 align:start position:0%
brings everything together into one
 
03:17:57.060 --> 03:17:58.429 align:start position:0%
brings everything together into one
place

03:17:58.429 --> 03:17:58.439 align:start position:0%
place
 
03:18:00.889 --> 03:18:00.899 align:start position:0%
fast Enterprises was selected through an
 
03:18:03.110 --> 03:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
RFP process to implement and support
 
03:18:05.030 --> 03:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
their commercial off-the-shelf product
 
03:18:08.809 --> 03:18:08.819 align:start position:0%
called gen tax so rims is the New
 
03:18:11.090 --> 03:18:11.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire version of gentax gentax
 
03:18:13.870 --> 03:18:13.880 align:start position:0%
operates in many many many States
 
03:18:16.910 --> 03:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
cities and counties across the country
 
03:18:20.809 --> 03:18:20.819 align:start position:0%
so it is a very well-versed system
 
03:18:22.429 --> 03:18:22.439 align:start position:0%
um implementation consisted of three
 
03:18:25.190 --> 03:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
phases each one took about a year and
 
03:18:27.110 --> 03:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
the contract also included support and
 
03:18:29.230 --> 03:18:29.240 align:start position:0%
maintenance of the system for four years
 
03:18:33.110 --> 03:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
the total cost for that system was 29
 
03:18:33.120 --> 03:18:35.150 align:start position:0%
the total cost for that system was 29
550

03:18:35.150 --> 03:18:35.160 align:start position:0%
550
 
03:18:35.160 --> 03:18:40.190 align:start position:0%
550
000.

03:18:40.190 --> 03:18:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:42.889 --> 03:18:42.899 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh what year was it
 
03:18:45.110 --> 03:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
implemented in so if you flip to the
 
03:18:47.230 --> 03:18:47.240 align:start position:0%
next slide sorry short note no worries
 
03:18:50.210 --> 03:18:50.220 align:start position:0%
thank you um I'd walk through here the
 
03:18:52.790 --> 03:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
three rollouts that we used to implement
 
03:18:56.030 --> 03:18:56.040 align:start position:0%
the system so the first rollout went
 
03:18:58.969 --> 03:18:58.979 align:start position:0%
live on October 28th of 2019 that
 
03:19:01.190 --> 03:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
included our meals and rentals tax and
 
03:19:02.929 --> 03:19:02.939 align:start position:0%
then the Medicaid enhancement tax and
 
03:19:04.870 --> 03:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
the nursing facility quality assessment
 
03:19:07.790 --> 03:19:07.800 align:start position:0%
rollout 2 went live on October 5th of
 
03:19:10.309 --> 03:19:10.319 align:start position:0%
2020 included both of our business taxes
 
03:19:11.870 --> 03:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
interest and dividends tax and
 
03:19:14.570 --> 03:19:14.580 align:start position:0%
communication Services tax and then the
 
03:19:16.309 --> 03:19:16.319 align:start position:0%
final rollout went live about a year and
 
03:19:19.730 --> 03:19:19.740 align:start position:0%
a half ago on August 9th of 2021 and
 
03:19:21.590 --> 03:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
included our tobacco tax real estate
 
03:19:23.690 --> 03:19:23.700 align:start position:0%
transfer tax utility property tax
 
03:19:25.570 --> 03:19:25.580 align:start position:0%
railroad Private Car
 
03:19:28.730 --> 03:19:28.740 align:start position:0%
sticks and stones and also the low and
 
03:19:28.740 --> 03:19:30.010 align:start position:0%
sticks and stones and also the low and
moderate

03:19:30.010 --> 03:19:30.020 align:start position:0%
moderate
 
03:19:33.110 --> 03:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
homeowners relief program
 
03:19:35.330 --> 03:19:35.340 align:start position:0%
I will point out these all of these
 
03:19:38.210 --> 03:19:38.220 align:start position:0%
rollouts were on time and on budget we
 
03:19:40.309 --> 03:19:40.319 align:start position:0%
had no additional costs everything went
 
03:19:42.650 --> 03:19:42.660 align:start position:0%
live as planned even during a global
 
03:19:45.050 --> 03:19:45.060 align:start position:0%
pandemic with shifts to everyone working
 
03:19:46.849 --> 03:19:46.859 align:start position:0%
from home
 
03:19:49.370 --> 03:19:49.380 align:start position:0%
um it was quite an undertaking it was a
 
03:19:51.530 --> 03:19:51.540 align:start position:0%
lot of hard work and I'm very very proud
 
03:19:54.469 --> 03:19:54.479 align:start position:0%
of the work that the dra doit and our
 
03:19:56.870 --> 03:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
vendor fast did in order to get this up
 
03:19:58.670 --> 03:19:58.680 align:start position:0%
and running
 
03:20:01.550 --> 03:20:01.560 align:start position:0%
you'll see on slide 15 this is a
 
03:20:03.830 --> 03:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
screenshot of what Granite tax connect
 
03:20:06.710 --> 03:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
looks like so Granite tax connect is the
 
03:20:11.330 --> 03:20:11.340 align:start position:0%
public portal option of rims so if you
 
03:20:13.490 --> 03:20:13.500 align:start position:0%
go to the Granite tax connect website
 
03:20:16.730 --> 03:20:16.740 align:start position:0%
you will see these various options where
 
03:20:18.769 --> 03:20:18.779 align:start position:0%
either you can sign into your account up
 
03:20:21.950 --> 03:20:21.960 align:start position:0%
at the top or you can do a variety of
 
03:20:24.130 --> 03:20:24.140 align:start position:0%
functions down below
 
03:20:27.170 --> 03:20:27.180 align:start position:0%
you can register or apply for an
 
03:20:29.150 --> 03:20:29.160 align:start position:0%
application say for a meals and rentals
 
03:20:31.610 --> 03:20:31.620 align:start position:0%
license if you were operating or
 
03:20:33.590 --> 03:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
deciding to rent out your property and
 
03:20:35.389 --> 03:20:35.399 align:start position:0%
needed an m r license you could apply
 
03:20:37.730 --> 03:20:37.740 align:start position:0%
for one right here on the home page you
 
03:20:39.710 --> 03:20:39.720 align:start position:0%
can make a payment you can find file
 
03:20:41.150 --> 03:20:41.160 align:start position:0%
documents related to the real estate
 
03:20:43.849 --> 03:20:43.859 align:start position:0%
transfer tax you can find a previous
 
03:20:46.130 --> 03:20:46.140 align:start position:0%
submission or you'll see in that second
 
03:20:48.110 --> 03:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
box down all the way on the left that's
 
03:20:50.090 --> 03:20:50.100 align:start position:0%
where you would report tax fraud or
 
03:20:52.670 --> 03:20:52.680 align:start position:0%
concerns about tax fraud
 
03:20:55.010 --> 03:20:55.020 align:start position:0%
you can submit certification requests if
 
03:20:56.510 --> 03:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
you're looking say for a certificate of
 
03:20:57.889 --> 03:20:57.899 align:start position:0%
good standing or something of the
 
03:21:00.410 --> 03:21:00.420 align:start position:0%
similar and then on the bottom right is
 
03:21:02.330 --> 03:21:02.340 align:start position:0%
reporting so you can look up meals and
 
03:21:04.490 --> 03:21:04.500 align:start position:0%
rentals tax licenses tobacco tax
 
03:21:08.750 --> 03:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
licenses Etc so nothing existed like
 
03:21:11.809 --> 03:21:11.819 align:start position:0%
this before rims there was no ability
 
03:21:14.570 --> 03:21:14.580 align:start position:0%
for taxpayers to log into their account
 
03:21:17.389 --> 03:21:17.399 align:start position:0%
and see if their payment had posted or
 
03:21:19.969 --> 03:21:19.979 align:start position:0%
processed you know if you sent in a
 
03:21:21.349 --> 03:21:21.359 align:start position:0%
check and it looked like it hadn't been
 
03:21:23.570 --> 03:21:23.580 align:start position:0%
cached yet you'd have to call us we're
 
03:21:25.429 --> 03:21:25.439 align:start position:0%
very nice we answer the phones I promise
 
03:21:28.070 --> 03:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
but it's an added headache right now you
 
03:21:30.110 --> 03:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
can create an account your practitioner
 
03:21:32.030 --> 03:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
can have access to your account if you
 
03:21:34.250 --> 03:21:34.260 align:start position:0%
so choose and they can monitor your
 
03:21:35.929 --> 03:21:35.939 align:start position:0%
account for you or you can log in and
 
03:21:37.250 --> 03:21:37.260 align:start position:0%
make sure that that check was actually
 
03:21:39.290 --> 03:21:39.300 align:start position:0%
cast cached and that payment was
 
03:21:43.010 --> 03:21:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:45.469 --> 03:21:45.479 align:start position:0%
on slide 16 I just wanted to highlight
 
03:21:47.809 --> 03:21:47.819 align:start position:0%
something interesting about the
 
03:21:51.530 --> 03:21:51.540 align:start position:0%
financing of rims so we received the
 
03:21:53.510 --> 03:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
capital appropriation during the 2012
 
03:21:55.670 --> 03:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
legislative session 2017 excuse me
 
03:21:57.469 --> 03:21:57.479 align:start position:0%
legislative session
 
03:22:00.530 --> 03:22:00.540 align:start position:0%
and we received the 30 million one
 
03:22:02.570 --> 03:22:02.580 align:start position:0%
hundred and sixty thousand dollars for
 
03:22:04.730 --> 03:22:04.740 align:start position:0%
rims and then the front-end taxpayer
 
03:22:06.530 --> 03:22:06.540 align:start position:0%
portal of granite tax connect which I
 
03:22:08.929 --> 03:22:08.939 align:start position:0%
showed you on the prior slide
 
03:22:12.050 --> 03:22:12.060 align:start position:0%
24 million one hundred and sixty
 
03:22:13.849 --> 03:22:13.859 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars of that appropriation
 
03:22:16.010 --> 03:22:16.020 align:start position:0%
was financed through the issuance of
 
03:22:16.020 --> 03:22:17.090 align:start position:0%
was financed through the issuance of
bonds

03:22:17.090 --> 03:22:17.100 align:start position:0%
bonds
 
03:22:21.950 --> 03:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
and those are to be the be paid for by a
 
03:22:23.590 --> 03:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing revenue information
 
03:22:26.990 --> 03:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
management system account
 
03:22:30.950 --> 03:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
so we at the dra can transfer up to four
 
03:22:33.469 --> 03:22:33.479 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year of Revenue that
 
03:22:36.730 --> 03:22:36.740 align:start position:0%
we receive into this non-lapsing account
 
03:22:39.290 --> 03:22:39.300 align:start position:0%
in order to pay the principal and
 
03:22:42.889 --> 03:22:42.899 align:start position:0%
interest on the bond the 24 million one
 
03:22:44.450 --> 03:22:44.460 align:start position:0%
hundred and sixty thousand dollars of
 
03:22:48.410 --> 03:22:48.420 align:start position:0%
bonds so the capital budget really only
 
03:22:51.230 --> 03:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
funded the six million dollars the
 
03:22:53.929 --> 03:22:53.939 align:start position:0%
difference between the 30 million and
 
03:22:56.330 --> 03:22:56.340 align:start position:0%
the 24 million one hundred and sixty
 
03:22:58.190 --> 03:22:58.200 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in this rims Revenue
 
03:23:01.730 --> 03:23:01.740 align:start position:0%
uplift is going to finance the remaining
 
03:23:05.269 --> 03:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
on slide 17 I show you what we have
 
03:23:08.809 --> 03:23:08.819 align:start position:0%
transferred into that rims information
 
03:23:11.450 --> 03:23:11.460 align:start position:0%
management system account in fiscal year
 
03:23:13.370 --> 03:23:13.380 align:start position:0%
2020 we didn't transfer anything we were
 
03:23:15.349 --> 03:23:15.359 align:start position:0%
not yet fully up and running
 
03:23:19.010 --> 03:23:19.020 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 21 we transferred 2.2
 
03:23:22.130 --> 03:23:22.140 align:start position:0%
million and then in fiscal year 22 we
 
03:23:24.950 --> 03:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
transferred the full 4 million you'll
 
03:23:27.650 --> 03:23:27.660 align:start position:0%
see in the table at the bottom that we
 
03:23:30.290 --> 03:23:30.300 align:start position:0%
actually generated 5.3 million in
 
03:23:32.570 --> 03:23:32.580 align:start position:0%
Revenue uplift however per the statute
 
03:23:35.269 --> 03:23:35.279 align:start position:0%
were capped at the 4 million maximum so
 
03:23:37.610 --> 03:23:37.620 align:start position:0%
we kind of prorated the amount to be
 
03:23:37.620 --> 03:23:38.750 align:start position:0%
we kind of prorated the amount to be
transferred

03:23:38.750 --> 03:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
transferred
 
03:23:41.389 --> 03:23:41.399 align:start position:0%
this Revenue uplift
 
03:23:44.809 --> 03:23:44.819 align:start position:0%
um to date is generated by a reminder to
 
03:23:48.170 --> 03:23:48.180 align:start position:0%
pay letters so before rims if we sent
 
03:23:50.210 --> 03:23:50.220 align:start position:0%
you a tax notice because you owed us
 
03:23:52.790 --> 03:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
money we would never have we didn't have
 
03:23:54.469 --> 03:23:54.479 align:start position:0%
the ability to follow up with you to
 
03:23:56.750 --> 03:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
remind you and the next communication
 
03:23:58.190 --> 03:23:58.200 align:start position:0%
you would get for us was that your
 
03:23:59.809 --> 03:23:59.819 align:start position:0%
appeal rights had expired and you were
 
03:24:01.969 --> 03:24:01.979 align:start position:0%
now in collections
 
03:24:04.670 --> 03:24:04.680 align:start position:0%
we now send you a reminder after 30 days
 
03:24:06.889 --> 03:24:06.899 align:start position:0%
because we understand people are busy we
 
03:24:08.809 --> 03:24:08.819 align:start position:0%
understand that mail can get lost in the
 
03:24:11.150 --> 03:24:11.160 align:start position:0%
shuffle so after 30 days we send you a
 
03:24:11.160 --> 03:24:12.170 align:start position:0%
shuffle so after 30 days we send you a
reminder

03:24:12.170 --> 03:24:12.180 align:start position:0%
reminder
 
03:24:15.349 --> 03:24:15.359 align:start position:0%
by just sending that reminder we have
 
03:24:17.750 --> 03:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
generated over two million dollars of
 
03:24:19.370 --> 03:24:19.380 align:start position:0%
Revenue that we hadn't received
 
03:24:19.380 --> 03:24:21.530 align:start position:0%
Revenue that we hadn't received
previously

03:24:21.530 --> 03:24:21.540 align:start position:0%
previously
 
03:24:24.110 --> 03:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
we also now have a greater ability to
 
03:24:26.570 --> 03:24:26.580 align:start position:0%
use federal tax information so I
 
03:24:27.889 --> 03:24:27.899 align:start position:0%
mentioned that earlier one of the
 
03:24:30.010 --> 03:24:30.020 align:start position:0%
functions of our audit division is to
 
03:24:32.530 --> 03:24:32.540 align:start position:0%
identify either
 
03:24:35.570 --> 03:24:35.580 align:start position:0%
non-filers or discrepancies between
 
03:24:38.030 --> 03:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
Federal filings and state filings this
 
03:24:40.130 --> 03:24:40.140 align:start position:0%
the state business tax returns starting
 
03:24:42.469 --> 03:24:42.479 align:start position:0%
point is the Federal Business is federal
 
03:24:46.370 --> 03:24:46.380 align:start position:0%
return We but for rims we didn't have
 
03:24:47.870 --> 03:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
the ability to make a lot of those
 
03:24:50.570 --> 03:24:50.580 align:start position:0%
connections so we have the ability now
 
03:24:53.330 --> 03:24:53.340 align:start position:0%
to have greater use of the data that we
 
03:24:56.450 --> 03:24:56.460 align:start position:0%
receive from the IRS to make sure that
 
03:25:00.050 --> 03:25:00.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:03.070 --> 03:25:03.080 align:start position:0%
so if I could Commission
 
03:25:06.469 --> 03:25:06.479 align:start position:0%
compliance how do we rank as far as
 
03:25:09.429 --> 03:25:09.439 align:start position:0%
maybe other states or are you having
 
03:25:12.410 --> 03:25:12.420 align:start position:0%
problems uh collecting in any particular
 
03:25:15.650 --> 03:25:15.660 align:start position:0%
tax bracket area
 
03:25:17.030 --> 03:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
the question
 
03:25:17.040 --> 03:25:17.750 align:start position:0%
the question
um

03:25:17.750 --> 03:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:19.490 --> 03:25:19.500 align:start position:0%
I would say
 
03:25:21.469 --> 03:25:21.479 align:start position:0%
a pretty good job with our compliance
 
03:25:23.030 --> 03:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
it's hard to compare to other states
 
03:25:25.429 --> 03:25:25.439 align:start position:0%
because if if Massachusetts was sitting
 
03:25:27.530 --> 03:25:27.540 align:start position:0%
here their primary concern would be
 
03:25:29.690 --> 03:25:29.700 align:start position:0%
personal income tax we don't have a
 
03:25:32.570 --> 03:25:32.580 align:start position:0%
personal income tax so our you know
 
03:25:35.809 --> 03:25:35.819 align:start position:0%
concerns are a smaller population of
 
03:25:35.819 --> 03:25:37.849 align:start position:0%
concerns are a smaller population of
taxes

03:25:37.849 --> 03:25:37.859 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
03:25:40.550 --> 03:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
um but we
 
03:25:42.889 --> 03:25:42.899 align:start position:0%
um use the data that's provided to us as
 
03:25:44.630 --> 03:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
I mentioned either through federal tax
 
03:25:46.910 --> 03:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
information or through information from
 
03:25:48.530 --> 03:25:48.540 align:start position:0%
other state agencies like Employment
 
03:25:51.469 --> 03:25:51.479 align:start position:0%
Security or for instance um The Liquor
 
03:25:53.809 --> 03:25:53.819 align:start position:0%
Commission when they issue a liquor
 
03:25:55.790 --> 03:25:55.800 align:start position:0%
license they'll let us know so we can
 
03:25:57.469 --> 03:25:57.479 align:start position:0%
make sure that the operator also has a
 
03:25:59.090 --> 03:25:59.100 align:start position:0%
meals and rentals license because they
 
03:26:00.410 --> 03:26:00.420 align:start position:0%
would they are going to be selling
 
03:26:02.929 --> 03:26:02.939 align:start position:0%
taxable items
 
03:26:05.269 --> 03:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
um and so I think we do we do a nice job
 
03:26:05.279 --> 03:26:06.290 align:start position:0%
um and so I think we do we do a nice job
we

03:26:06.290 --> 03:26:06.300 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:26:08.330 --> 03:26:08.340 align:start position:0%
um I believe our Communications are
 
03:26:10.490 --> 03:26:10.500 align:start position:0%
courteous so if we reach out to you and
 
03:26:12.290 --> 03:26:12.300 align:start position:0%
we believe you have a filing obligation
 
03:26:14.690 --> 03:26:14.700 align:start position:0%
but we don't see a return we don't
 
03:26:16.429 --> 03:26:16.439 align:start position:0%
immediately just send you a tax notice
 
03:26:18.710 --> 03:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
that says hey we did the math for you
 
03:26:20.450 --> 03:26:20.460 align:start position:0%
you know here's the amount that you owe
 
03:26:22.309 --> 03:26:22.319 align:start position:0%
we'll reach out and say we believe you
 
03:26:24.710 --> 03:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
have a filing obligation and we'd like
 
03:26:26.090 --> 03:26:26.100 align:start position:0%
to just understand why we haven't
 
03:26:28.309 --> 03:26:28.319 align:start position:0%
received a return and sometimes there is
 
03:26:31.309 --> 03:26:31.319 align:start position:0%
a reason and other times the taxpayer
 
03:26:33.349 --> 03:26:33.359 align:start position:0%
will say I wasn't aware that I had a
 
03:26:35.150 --> 03:26:35.160 align:start position:0%
filing obligation and will work with
 
03:26:37.490 --> 03:26:37.500 align:start position:0%
them to get into compliance yeah I
 
03:26:38.870 --> 03:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate that you know you've always
 
03:26:41.330 --> 03:26:41.340 align:start position:0%
heard that nobody likes to tax man we
 
03:26:41.340 --> 03:26:43.070 align:start position:0%
heard that nobody likes to tax man we
try

03:26:43.070 --> 03:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
try
 
03:26:44.690 --> 03:26:44.700 align:start position:0%
but in your case I guess they probably
 
03:26:46.370 --> 03:26:46.380 align:start position:0%
like the tax woman better than they've
 
03:26:49.250 --> 03:26:49.260 align:start position:0%
like yeah in the past but no thanks any
 
03:26:51.349 --> 03:26:51.359 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative thank you
 
03:26:54.410 --> 03:26:54.420 align:start position:0%
hi thank you thanks for coming
 
03:26:56.690 --> 03:26:56.700 align:start position:0%
um I was just curious I know that we're
 
03:27:00.349 --> 03:27:00.359 align:start position:0%
uh changing the way we're uh handling uh
 
03:27:02.809 --> 03:27:02.819 align:start position:0%
business profits tax to the single sales
 
03:27:06.790 --> 03:27:06.800 align:start position:0%
Factor how does that affect your agency
 
03:27:09.769 --> 03:27:09.779 align:start position:0%
operationally when they're a such big
 
03:27:12.229 --> 03:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
changes so
 
03:27:15.229 --> 03:27:15.239 align:start position:0%
I would say the biggest impact to our
 
03:27:17.690 --> 03:27:17.700 align:start position:0%
agency will use the single sales Factor
 
03:27:20.630 --> 03:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
as an example so previously there were
 
03:27:22.969 --> 03:27:22.979 align:start position:0%
three factors that a business and the
 
03:27:25.190 --> 03:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
dra would look to
 
03:27:27.650 --> 03:27:27.660 align:start position:0%
um when reviewing a business's
 
03:27:30.170 --> 03:27:30.180 align:start position:0%
operations if they operated in multiple
 
03:27:32.870 --> 03:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
States so the the single sales Factor
 
03:27:35.570 --> 03:27:35.580 align:start position:0%
comes in with how does Acme Corporation
 
03:27:37.490 --> 03:27:37.500 align:start position:0%
decide how much of their profit should
 
03:27:39.469 --> 03:27:39.479 align:start position:0%
go to Massachusetts versus New Hampshire
 
03:27:42.410 --> 03:27:42.420 align:start position:0%
versus Vermont versus Maine
 
03:27:46.729 --> 03:27:46.739 align:start position:0%
so when we used three factors we all
 
03:27:48.590 --> 03:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
understood how that worked now we're
 
03:27:51.530 --> 03:27:51.540 align:start position:0%
just looking at this the sales Factor so
 
03:27:54.349 --> 03:27:54.359 align:start position:0%
it's not a huge change for us it's just
 
03:27:56.750 --> 03:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
a slight change in methodology but I
 
03:27:59.450 --> 03:27:59.460 align:start position:0%
would say more of the impact is it's
 
03:28:00.950 --> 03:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
going to depend on what year we're
 
03:28:03.170 --> 03:28:03.180 align:start position:0%
looking at in terms of if we're under
 
03:28:04.849 --> 03:28:04.859 align:start position:0%
audit or if we're working with a
 
03:28:07.610 --> 03:28:07.620 align:start position:0%
taxpayer to come into compliance we need
 
03:28:08.809 --> 03:28:08.819 align:start position:0%
to look at what tax year they're
 
03:28:11.269 --> 03:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
operating in to determine how they
 
03:28:12.469 --> 03:28:12.479 align:start position:0%
should be calculating their
 
03:28:14.389 --> 03:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
apportionment so it kind of takes a
 
03:28:16.370 --> 03:28:16.380 align:start position:0%
couple of years you know you'll you'll
 
03:28:17.630 --> 03:28:17.640 align:start position:0%
hear employees be like okay wait a
 
03:28:19.550 --> 03:28:19.560 align:start position:0%
second am I looking at three single
 
03:28:21.530 --> 03:28:21.540 align:start position:0%
sales factor or am I looking at three
 
03:28:23.330 --> 03:28:23.340 align:start position:0%
Factor apportionment
 
03:28:24.950 --> 03:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
um it was a pretty easy change to make
 
03:28:26.929 --> 03:28:26.939 align:start position:0%
within our new system which is another
 
03:28:26.939 --> 03:28:28.550 align:start position:0%
within our new system which is another
benefit

03:28:28.550 --> 03:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
03:28:30.790 --> 03:28:30.800 align:start position:0%
um so it's really just kind of
 
03:28:33.349 --> 03:28:33.359 align:start position:0%
remembering that the change has occurred
 
03:28:35.510 --> 03:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
and what you need to do in what year if
 
03:28:38.870 --> 03:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:41.090 --> 03:28:41.100 align:start position:0%
question representative McGuire thank
 
03:28:42.910 --> 03:28:42.920 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you
 
03:28:46.370 --> 03:28:46.380 align:start position:0%
what fraction of taxes collected end up
 
03:28:47.750 --> 03:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
going to the collections department
 
03:28:50.090 --> 03:28:50.100 align:start position:0%
because they're not paid
 
03:28:52.849 --> 03:28:52.859 align:start position:0%
oh that's a good question we can get you
 
03:28:56.030 --> 03:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
that information it would depend on
 
03:28:59.750 --> 03:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
um on the tax type so meals and rentals
 
03:29:01.429 --> 03:29:01.439 align:start position:0%
operators right they file on a monthly
 
03:29:05.090 --> 03:29:05.100 align:start position:0%
basis we look returns are due on the
 
03:29:08.389 --> 03:29:08.399 align:start position:0%
15th by about the 20th of the month if
 
03:29:10.550 --> 03:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
we don't have a return for you we'll
 
03:29:13.010 --> 03:29:13.020 align:start position:0%
send you a reminder
 
03:29:16.070 --> 03:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
um so that that tax we're kind of
 
03:29:19.070 --> 03:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
dealing with and on an ongoing basis so
 
03:29:21.769 --> 03:29:21.779 align:start position:0%
in theory unless they can't pay the
 
03:29:24.469 --> 03:29:24.479 align:start position:0%
amount we've kind of are keeping them on
 
03:29:25.790 --> 03:29:25.800 align:start position:0%
their toes to make sure they file and
 
03:29:28.370 --> 03:29:28.380 align:start position:0%
pay business taxes interest in dividends
 
03:29:30.110 --> 03:29:30.120 align:start position:0%
tax it's only you know due on a yearly
 
03:29:30.120 --> 03:29:31.790 align:start position:0%
tax it's only you know due on a yearly
basis

03:29:31.790 --> 03:29:31.800 align:start position:0%
basis
 
03:29:34.429 --> 03:29:34.439 align:start position:0%
um there might be more amounts that end
 
03:29:36.050 --> 03:29:36.060 align:start position:0%
up in collections but we can get you
 
03:29:39.170 --> 03:29:39.180 align:start position:0%
that information that's a good question
 
03:29:41.030 --> 03:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
um yes thank you so
 
03:29:43.190 --> 03:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
and what and I'd also like to know what
 
03:29:46.729 --> 03:29:46.739 align:start position:0%
fraction of those end up going to legal
 
03:29:49.030 --> 03:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
action or whatever you do
 
03:29:51.950 --> 03:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
the next steps that when the collection
 
03:29:54.050 --> 03:29:54.060 align:start position:0%
says I can't find this person or
 
03:29:55.849 --> 03:29:55.859 align:start position:0%
whatever yeah yep we can definitely get
 
03:29:57.650 --> 03:29:57.660 align:start position:0%
you that information I would assume it's
 
03:30:01.010 --> 03:30:01.020 align:start position:0%
small right the one percent or some tiny
 
03:30:02.750 --> 03:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
number do you know or I don't know off
 
03:30:04.250 --> 03:30:04.260 align:start position:0%
the top of my head or do you know off
 
03:30:06.110 --> 03:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
the top of your head
 
03:30:06.120 --> 03:30:06.710 align:start position:0%
the top of your head
um

03:30:06.710 --> 03:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:30:09.710 --> 03:30:09.720 align:start position:0%
no as far as enforcement action I think
 
03:30:11.830 --> 03:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
it's wrong 80
 
03:30:14.690 --> 03:30:14.700 align:start position:0%
collections enforcement which is usually
 
03:30:17.330 --> 03:30:17.340 align:start position:0%
after about two years period
 
03:30:19.610 --> 03:30:19.620 align:start position:0%
but the other question how much it
 
03:30:22.250 --> 03:30:22.260 align:start position:0%
actually gets the collections yeah
 
03:30:25.550 --> 03:30:25.560 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
03:30:27.110 --> 03:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
it's nice to hear though that you're
 
03:30:29.269 --> 03:30:29.279 align:start position:0%
sending out a reminder notice instead of
 
03:30:31.190 --> 03:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
the next note is being a certified
 
03:30:33.170 --> 03:30:33.180 align:start position:0%
letter or something like that but you're
 
03:30:36.170 --> 03:30:36.180 align:start position:0%
at least making a strong effort to get
 
03:30:38.269 --> 03:30:38.279 align:start position:0%
the word out that something is owed or
 
03:30:39.769 --> 03:30:39.779 align:start position:0%
do or whatever
 
03:30:42.050 --> 03:30:42.060 align:start position:0%
so obviously we operate somewhat in a
 
03:30:44.870 --> 03:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
voluntary compliance system right and a
 
03:30:46.969 --> 03:30:46.979 align:start position:0%
tax administrator in the state of New
 
03:30:49.790 --> 03:30:49.800 align:start position:0%
York told me years ago about this
 
03:30:52.670 --> 03:30:52.680 align:start position:0%
concept of like a compliance Continuum
 
03:30:56.510 --> 03:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
and the more that you can do
 
03:30:58.969 --> 03:30:58.979 align:start position:0%
um to re to collect the money and
 
03:31:01.370 --> 03:31:01.380 align:start position:0%
receive it and the information up front
 
03:31:04.130 --> 03:31:04.140 align:start position:0%
the lower cost it is not only to the
 
03:31:06.410 --> 03:31:06.420 align:start position:0%
department but also to the taxpayers so
 
03:31:09.110 --> 03:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
whatever we can do do to avoid the more
 
03:31:10.750 --> 03:31:10.760 align:start position:0%
advanced collection
 
03:31:12.830 --> 03:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
actions is going to not only be better
 
03:31:14.450 --> 03:31:14.460 align:start position:0%
for the taxpayer but also better for us
 
03:31:17.690 --> 03:31:17.700 align:start position:0%
so a simple reminder letter is really
 
03:31:20.809 --> 03:31:20.819 align:start position:0%
relatively low cost gentle reminder to
 
03:31:23.929 --> 03:31:23.939 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer can generate revenue and
 
03:31:27.950 --> 03:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
everybody wins so another question so
 
03:31:32.090 --> 03:31:32.100 align:start position:0%
when the tax is late is there a certain
 
03:31:35.990 --> 03:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh percentage charge or something uh
 
03:31:38.269 --> 03:31:38.279 align:start position:0%
late fee and is it the same across all
 
03:31:40.910 --> 03:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
sets of taxes or or different it can be
 
03:31:43.370 --> 03:31:43.380 align:start position:0%
different across um sets of taxes there
 
03:31:45.889 --> 03:31:45.899 align:start position:0%
are penalties and interests uh penalties
 
03:31:48.110 --> 03:31:48.120 align:start position:0%
and interest Associated
 
03:31:50.030 --> 03:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
um with any late payments or late
 
03:31:50.040 --> 03:31:51.530 align:start position:0%
um with any late payments or late
filings

03:31:51.530 --> 03:31:51.540 align:start position:0%
filings
 
03:31:52.849 --> 03:31:52.859 align:start position:0%
um I as the commissioner do have the
 
03:31:54.830 --> 03:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
authority to Abate those for good cause
 
03:31:57.650 --> 03:31:57.660 align:start position:0%
and we routinely work with taxpayers and
 
03:31:59.750 --> 03:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
if it is an honest mistake we're not
 
03:32:02.389 --> 03:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
going to stick you with a large bill
 
03:32:04.729 --> 03:32:04.739 align:start position:0%
um for you know being a couple days late
 
03:32:08.870 --> 03:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:11.990 --> 03:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
any further questions as we move along
 
03:32:13.729 --> 03:32:13.739 align:start position:0%
no okay
 
03:32:17.150 --> 03:32:17.160 align:start position:0%
uh slide 18 just some highlights of our
 
03:32:19.090 --> 03:32:19.100 align:start position:0%
24 25
 
03:32:21.710 --> 03:32:21.720 align:start position:0%
agency budget that will be back before
 
03:32:24.769 --> 03:32:24.779 align:start position:0%
you again in a few weeks to present
 
03:32:26.450 --> 03:32:26.460 align:start position:0%
um our current position count is
 
03:32:29.809 --> 03:32:29.819 align:start position:0%
maintained at 156 full-time classified
 
03:32:32.210 --> 03:32:32.220 align:start position:0%
and unclassified employees and four
 
03:32:36.610 --> 03:32:36.620 align:start position:0%
part-time positions so we administer 2.9
 
03:32:39.950 --> 03:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
billion dollars in Revenue with 160
 
03:32:42.769 --> 03:32:42.779 align:start position:0%
people so we're a pretty efficient shop
 
03:32:45.769 --> 03:32:45.779 align:start position:0%
our general fund operating budget is 70
 
03:32:48.410 --> 03:32:48.420 align:start position:0%
75 salaries and benefits we are a
 
03:32:50.269 --> 03:32:50.279 align:start position:0%
department of people and not things or
 
03:32:52.670 --> 03:32:52.680 align:start position:0%
programs so primarily salaries and
 
03:32:53.929 --> 03:32:53.939 align:start position:0%
benefits when you're looking at our
 
03:32:53.939 --> 03:32:54.830 align:start position:0%
benefits when you're looking at our
budget

03:32:54.830 --> 03:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
budget
 
03:32:56.990 --> 03:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
our budget request includes sufficient
 
03:32:58.690 --> 03:32:58.700 align:start position:0%
funding for employee training
 
03:33:01.490 --> 03:33:01.500 align:start position:0%
out-of-state travel for audits overtime
 
03:33:03.530 --> 03:33:03.540 align:start position:0%
for Peak periods and taxpayer services
 
03:33:06.050 --> 03:33:06.060 align:start position:0%
and in collections and maintaining a
 
03:33:08.150 --> 03:33:08.160 align:start position:0%
free fleet of state-owned cars that our
 
03:33:10.250 --> 03:33:10.260 align:start position:0%
in-state auditor use use and also our
 
03:33:13.010 --> 03:33:13.020 align:start position:0%
property appraisal staff and postage for
 
03:33:16.250 --> 03:33:16.260 align:start position:0%
Dra Communications to taxpayers the
 
03:33:18.710 --> 03:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
additional reminder to pay letters Etc
 
03:33:20.690 --> 03:33:20.700 align:start position:0%
that we're sending have increased our
 
03:33:22.910 --> 03:33:22.920 align:start position:0%
postage costs over the the past couple
 
03:33:26.750 --> 03:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
years but obviously to great benefit
 
03:33:28.790 --> 03:33:28.800 align:start position:0%
um there are no budget increases for
 
03:33:31.130 --> 03:33:31.140 align:start position:0%
one-time State Workforce efficiency
 
03:33:33.889 --> 03:33:33.899 align:start position:0%
enhancement program or sweep projects
 
03:33:36.769 --> 03:33:36.779 align:start position:0%
the dra received funding for three of
 
03:33:38.809 --> 03:33:38.819 align:start position:0%
these sweep projects where we will be
 
03:33:41.510 --> 03:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
using arpa funds in order to make
 
03:33:44.990 --> 03:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
enhancements and upgrades to systems at
 
03:33:47.809 --> 03:33:47.819 align:start position:0%
dra we're going to get a new brand new
 
03:33:50.809 --> 03:33:50.819 align:start position:0%
high-speed scanner that helps us process
 
03:33:53.450 --> 03:33:53.460 align:start position:0%
the mail we're going to make upgrades to
 
03:33:56.929 --> 03:33:56.939 align:start position:0%
rims and also upgrades to our property
 
03:33:59.030 --> 03:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
appraisal software those are all
 
03:34:01.309 --> 03:34:01.319 align:start position:0%
one-time costs so there's no you won't
 
03:34:03.530 --> 03:34:03.540 align:start position:0%
see any requests in our operating budget
 
03:34:05.150 --> 03:34:05.160 align:start position:0%
in order to
 
03:34:05.160 --> 03:34:05.769 align:start position:0%
in order to
um

03:34:05.769 --> 03:34:05.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:08.870 --> 03:34:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh sustain any costs related to those
 
03:34:12.110 --> 03:34:12.120 align:start position:0%
individual projects over the biennium
 
03:34:13.969 --> 03:34:13.979 align:start position:0%
the division directors business office
 
03:34:16.370 --> 03:34:16.380 align:start position:0%
and other managers work well
 
03:34:18.290 --> 03:34:18.300 align:start position:0%
um together and we work hard to budget
 
03:34:20.750 --> 03:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
conservatively and accurately really for
 
03:34:23.690 --> 03:34:23.700 align:start position:0%
just we what we need we try to limit our
 
03:34:26.030 --> 03:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
wants and just come up with the budget
 
03:34:28.969 --> 03:34:28.979 align:start position:0%
that's going to work for us
 
03:34:34.729 --> 03:34:34.739 align:start position:0%
on slide 19 our prioritize needs so our
 
03:34:36.410 --> 03:34:36.420 align:start position:0%
efficiency budget as submitted
 
03:34:38.030 --> 03:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
maintained all current operations
 
03:34:40.370 --> 03:34:40.380 align:start position:0%
however there were areas where the dra
 
03:34:42.170 --> 03:34:42.180 align:start position:0%
has requested additional funding in
 
03:34:45.469 --> 03:34:45.479 align:start position:0%
terms of prioritized needs the first is
 
03:34:47.389 --> 03:34:47.399 align:start position:0%
the low and moderate income hardship
 
03:34:50.330 --> 03:34:50.340 align:start position:0%
grants so these are paid for out of the
 
03:34:54.590 --> 03:34:54.600 align:start position:0%
education trust fund and chapter 95 from
 
03:34:57.889 --> 03:34:57.899 align:start position:0%
2021 increased the income limitations
 
03:35:00.889 --> 03:35:00.899 align:start position:0%
and the amount of Maximum relief that is
 
03:35:02.870 --> 03:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
paid out under l m
 
03:35:06.469 --> 03:35:06.479 align:start position:0%
and so that resulted in an increase in
 
03:35:09.170 --> 03:35:09.180 align:start position:0%
the number of claims and an increase of
 
03:35:11.389 --> 03:35:11.399 align:start position:0%
the amount of money that we paid out so
 
03:35:16.729 --> 03:35:16.739 align:start position:0%
for the April 1st 2021 tax year we had
 
03:35:18.410 --> 03:35:18.420 align:start position:0%
just under
 
03:35:22.429 --> 03:35:22.439 align:start position:0%
um 6 000 claims for 1.4 million compared
 
03:35:26.269 --> 03:35:26.279 align:start position:0%
to roughly 5 500 claims for 800 000 for
 
03:35:29.630 --> 03:35:29.640 align:start position:0%
the prior year so our prioritized need
 
03:35:32.870 --> 03:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
does ask for an additional 700 000 in
 
03:35:36.290 --> 03:35:36.300 align:start position:0%
order to fund those additional claims
 
03:35:42.469 --> 03:35:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:46.010 --> 03:35:46.020 align:start position:0%
questions on that okay on page 20 we
 
03:35:47.809 --> 03:35:47.819 align:start position:0%
also have an additional
 
03:35:52.250 --> 03:35:52.260 align:start position:0%
um prioritized need for our Rim system
 
03:35:54.170 --> 03:35:54.180 align:start position:0%
um the 30 million one hundred and sixty
 
03:35:55.790 --> 03:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar Capital appropriation
 
03:35:57.469 --> 03:35:57.479 align:start position:0%
includes hardware and software
 
03:36:01.610 --> 03:36:01.620 align:start position:0%
maintenance through 2025 but does not
 
03:36:03.530 --> 03:36:03.540 align:start position:0%
include software maintenance or consult
 
03:36:06.229 --> 03:36:06.239 align:start position:0%
oh and only and also I'm sorry and also
 
03:36:07.910 --> 03:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
include software maintenance Consulting
 
03:36:10.969 --> 03:36:10.979 align:start position:0%
through the first quarter of 24. we are
 
03:36:13.729 --> 03:36:13.739 align:start position:0%
requesting to maintain that level of
 
03:36:15.950 --> 03:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
consulting services from our vendor
 
03:36:18.710 --> 03:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
through 2025.
 
03:36:21.170 --> 03:36:21.180 align:start position:0%
so that will allow us to continue to
 
03:36:24.530 --> 03:36:24.540 align:start position:0%
operate at our current levels with rims
 
03:36:26.990 --> 03:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
the reason why we're asking for it now
 
03:36:28.969 --> 03:36:28.979 align:start position:0%
and we didn't put it in the original
 
03:36:31.849 --> 03:36:31.859 align:start position:0%
capital budget request is because we
 
03:36:34.010 --> 03:36:34.020 align:start position:0%
weren't sure of the amount of consulting
 
03:36:37.010 --> 03:36:37.020 align:start position:0%
services that we would need and because
 
03:36:40.190 --> 03:36:40.200 align:start position:0%
we hadn't implemented the system yet and
 
03:36:42.790 --> 03:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
I didn't at the time want us to either
 
03:36:47.150 --> 03:36:47.160 align:start position:0%
underfund or over fund those services so
 
03:36:48.830 --> 03:36:48.840 align:start position:0%
we waited until we were through
 
03:36:51.889 --> 03:36:51.899 align:start position:0%
implementation and we now feel like we
 
03:36:53.990 --> 03:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
have a good handle on the on the level
 
03:36:56.150 --> 03:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
of service that we need so that's why
 
03:36:57.590 --> 03:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
that amount was not in the original
 
03:36:59.990 --> 03:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
capital appropriation
 
03:37:02.030 --> 03:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
we are also requesting funding for two
 
03:37:04.309 --> 03:37:04.319 align:start position:0%
years oh sure thank you
 
03:37:07.130 --> 03:37:07.140 align:start position:0%
um do you have a dollar amount for that
 
03:37:07.140 --> 03:37:08.510 align:start position:0%
um do you have a dollar amount for that
um

03:37:08.510 --> 03:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:10.729 --> 03:37:10.739 align:start position:0%
we'll come back with what's in the
 
03:37:14.990 --> 03:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:16.969 --> 03:37:16.979 align:start position:0%
um we're also requesting funding for two
 
03:37:18.950 --> 03:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
doit positions that are currently
 
03:37:21.469 --> 03:37:21.479 align:start position:0%
unfunded I mentioned at the beginning of
 
03:37:22.969 --> 03:37:22.979 align:start position:0%
the presentation we obviously have
 
03:37:26.030 --> 03:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
embedded staff at dra
 
03:37:28.490 --> 03:37:28.500 align:start position:0%
um 40 to 60 of them are eligible to
 
03:37:33.110 --> 03:37:33.120 align:start position:0%
retire so we are looking to
 
03:37:36.050 --> 03:37:36.060 align:start position:0%
add some additional positions get some
 
03:37:38.809 --> 03:37:38.819 align:start position:0%
new bodies have the knowledge transfer
 
03:37:42.110 --> 03:37:42.120 align:start position:0%
occur before the retirements happen so
 
03:37:43.910 --> 03:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
that's what those two positions are for
 
03:37:46.729 --> 03:37:46.739 align:start position:0%
a little bit um secession planning and
 
03:37:48.590 --> 03:37:48.600 align:start position:0%
knowledge transfer
 
03:37:52.190 --> 03:37:52.200 align:start position:0%
and then lastly on slide 21 just some
 
03:37:54.769 --> 03:37:54.779 align:start position:0%
updates on our budget
 
03:37:57.710 --> 03:37:57.720 align:start position:0%
um our 2223 budget
 
03:37:57.720 --> 03:37:58.550 align:start position:0%
um our 2223 budget
um

03:37:58.550 --> 03:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:00.769 --> 03:38:00.779 align:start position:0%
we as I mentioned went live with our
 
03:38:04.070 --> 03:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
final rollout of rims I mentioned at the
 
03:38:05.450 --> 03:38:05.460 align:start position:0%
beginning that the efficiency of the
 
03:38:08.150 --> 03:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
system really helped us maintain our
 
03:38:10.250 --> 03:38:10.260 align:start position:0%
level of operations during a period of
 
03:38:12.610 --> 03:38:12.620 align:start position:0%
time when we've seen a roughly 15
 
03:38:16.610 --> 03:38:16.620 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate so certainly the system is
 
03:38:19.309 --> 03:38:19.319 align:start position:0%
proving to be quite valuable
 
03:38:22.130 --> 03:38:22.140 align:start position:0%
um I mentioned the amounts that we have
 
03:38:24.410 --> 03:38:24.420 align:start position:0%
been able to generate from revenue
 
03:38:24.420 --> 03:38:25.670 align:start position:0%
been able to generate from revenue
uplift

03:38:25.670 --> 03:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
uplift
 
03:38:27.769 --> 03:38:27.779 align:start position:0%
and then lastly this was a topic of
 
03:38:29.389 --> 03:38:29.399 align:start position:0%
conversation kind of during the during
 
03:38:31.370 --> 03:38:31.380 align:start position:0%
the last budget process so just updates
 
03:38:33.229 --> 03:38:33.239 align:start position:0%
on kind of customer service I've alluded
 
03:38:36.769 --> 03:38:36.779 align:start position:0%
to it a bit as we've talked today
 
03:38:41.510 --> 03:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
um it is a priority at dra in 22 FY 22
 
03:38:43.490 --> 03:38:43.500 align:start position:0%
and 23 to date
 
03:38:45.469 --> 03:38:45.479 align:start position:0%
um we have a survey that if you call
 
03:38:47.389 --> 03:38:47.399 align:start position:0%
into our call center at the end of the
 
03:38:49.010 --> 03:38:49.020 align:start position:0%
call you're asked to fill out a survey
 
03:38:50.690 --> 03:38:50.700 align:start position:0%
if you'd like to stay on a lot on the
 
03:38:53.929 --> 03:38:53.939 align:start position:0%
line we've received a rating of three or
 
03:38:56.990 --> 03:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
higher on a scale of one to five in 98
 
03:38:59.269 --> 03:38:59.279 align:start position:0%
of the calls
 
03:38:59.279 --> 03:38:59.929 align:start position:0%
of the calls
um

03:38:59.929 --> 03:38:59.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:02.210 --> 03:39:02.220 align:start position:0%
callers also have the opportunity to
 
03:39:04.729 --> 03:39:04.739 align:start position:0%
leave a message if they would like and
 
03:39:07.250 --> 03:39:07.260 align:start position:0%
they typically say things like thank you
 
03:39:09.290 --> 03:39:09.300 align:start position:0%
so much for answering your phones I
 
03:39:12.410 --> 03:39:12.420 align:start position:0%
tried to call the IRS no one answered I
 
03:39:14.030 --> 03:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
really appreciate someone taking the
 
03:39:16.550 --> 03:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
time to to walk me through what I needed
 
03:39:16.560 --> 03:39:18.050 align:start position:0%
time to to walk me through what I needed
today

03:39:18.050 --> 03:39:18.060 align:start position:0%
today
 
03:39:18.060 --> 03:39:18.650 align:start position:0%
today
um

03:39:18.650 --> 03:39:18.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:22.250 --> 03:39:22.260 align:start position:0%
obviously the online portal of granite
 
03:39:23.530 --> 03:39:23.540 align:start position:0%
tax connect
 
03:39:26.450 --> 03:39:26.460 align:start position:0%
allowing taxpayers and practitioners to
 
03:39:28.610 --> 03:39:28.620 align:start position:0%
make payments check account statuses Etc
 
03:39:30.889 --> 03:39:30.899 align:start position:0%
has been a huge customer service benefit
 
03:39:35.690 --> 03:39:35.700 align:start position:0%
for us we have over 30 000 GTC users so
 
03:39:37.969 --> 03:39:37.979 align:start position:0%
we have over 30 000 people that use that
 
03:39:40.670 --> 03:39:40.680 align:start position:0%
online portal to interact with us and it
 
03:39:42.889 --> 03:39:42.899 align:start position:0%
certainly made their lives easier we
 
03:39:44.809 --> 03:39:44.819 align:start position:0%
also have the ability that if you call
 
03:39:47.570 --> 03:39:47.580 align:start position:0%
into our call center and you're in GTC
 
03:39:49.729 --> 03:39:49.739 align:start position:0%
and you're stuck you can't figure out
 
03:39:51.469 --> 03:39:51.479 align:start position:0%
where you're supposed to click next or
 
03:39:52.670 --> 03:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
where you're supposed to enter the
 
03:39:55.070 --> 03:39:55.080 align:start position:0%
information there's a little number that
 
03:39:57.110 --> 03:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
shows up and if you give that number to
 
03:39:59.750 --> 03:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
our call center agent we can see what
 
03:40:01.370 --> 03:40:01.380 align:start position:0%
you're doing and we can help you walk
 
03:40:03.349 --> 03:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
walk you through the program and so
 
03:40:06.110 --> 03:40:06.120 align:start position:0%
that's also been a huge benefit of the
 
03:40:07.849 --> 03:40:07.859 align:start position:0%
system as well
 
03:40:07.859 --> 03:40:08.990 align:start position:0%
system as well
foreign

03:40:08.990 --> 03:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
03:40:11.929 --> 03:40:11.939 align:start position:0%
so that's what I have for today so you
 
03:40:14.330 --> 03:40:14.340 align:start position:0%
mentioned the users and the program in
 
03:40:16.490 --> 03:40:16.500 align:start position:0%
about what thirty thousand three one
 
03:40:19.190 --> 03:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
thousand what percent of the folks
 
03:40:21.410 --> 03:40:21.420 align:start position:0%
paying taxes in the state use that
 
03:40:24.590 --> 03:40:24.600 align:start position:0%
portal so I have those numbers for you
 
03:40:27.110 --> 03:40:27.120 align:start position:0%
and I can definitely get them the vast
 
03:40:29.389 --> 03:40:29.399 align:start position:0%
majority of our users are our meals and
 
03:40:32.870 --> 03:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
rentals tax operators they in order to
 
03:40:35.210 --> 03:40:35.220 align:start position:0%
keep their three percent commission they
 
03:40:37.190 --> 03:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
need to file electronically and so they
 
03:40:40.010 --> 03:40:40.020 align:start position:0%
do through via do so via GTC
 
03:40:44.570 --> 03:40:44.580 align:start position:0%
our business tax filers it depends
 
03:40:47.510 --> 03:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
um if they are a smaller business they
 
03:40:50.690 --> 03:40:50.700 align:start position:0%
tend to use GTC if they are a larger
 
03:40:52.490 --> 03:40:52.500 align:start position:0%
business that may have their own tax
 
03:40:54.950 --> 03:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
operation within the business or may
 
03:40:57.469 --> 03:40:57.479 align:start position:0%
contract most of that work out to a CPA
 
03:41:00.650 --> 03:41:00.660 align:start position:0%
or the like they may not utilize GTC as
 
03:41:03.830 --> 03:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
much our interest in dividends taxpayers
 
03:41:05.990 --> 03:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
it can depend
 
03:41:09.290 --> 03:41:09.300 align:start position:0%
um obviously you all know a lot of those
 
03:41:12.349 --> 03:41:12.359 align:start position:0%
interest and dividends taxpayers
 
03:41:12.359 --> 03:41:13.010 align:start position:0%
interest and dividends taxpayers
um

03:41:13.010 --> 03:41:13.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:14.929 --> 03:41:14.939 align:start position:0%
our elderly
 
03:41:17.269 --> 03:41:17.279 align:start position:0%
um they file paper returns they don't
 
03:41:19.250 --> 03:41:19.260 align:start position:0%
have much interest in GTC and that's
 
03:41:21.290 --> 03:41:21.300 align:start position:0%
totally fine by us we would never force
 
03:41:23.809 --> 03:41:23.819 align:start position:0%
them to use that so it's nice to have it
 
03:41:25.729 --> 03:41:25.739 align:start position:0%
as an option for folks that want to use
 
03:41:25.739 --> 03:41:26.870 align:start position:0%
as an option for folks that want to use
it

03:41:26.870 --> 03:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:41:28.849 --> 03:41:28.859 align:start position:0%
um but it is definitely not mandated we
 
03:41:31.309 --> 03:41:31.319 align:start position:0%
still accept paper returns we accept
 
03:41:35.929 --> 03:41:35.939 align:start position:0%
term returns through software providers
 
03:41:38.630 --> 03:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
um so I feel like we have a pretty good
 
03:41:41.030 --> 03:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
uptake with GTC we've been happy with
 
03:41:44.389 --> 03:41:44.399 align:start position:0%
the number of users that we've seen
 
03:41:47.570 --> 03:41:47.580 align:start position:0%
so my final question flood control I was
 
03:41:50.389 --> 03:41:50.399 align:start position:0%
surprised I didn't see it how is that
 
03:41:53.269 --> 03:41:53.279 align:start position:0%
really was there a settlement there was
 
03:41:55.370 --> 03:41:55.380 align:start position:0%
a settlement yes so I didn't include
 
03:41:58.190 --> 03:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
flood control because with the help of
 
03:42:00.229 --> 03:42:00.239 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office we reached
 
03:42:01.429 --> 03:42:01.439 align:start position:0%
a settlement with the state of
 
03:42:03.650 --> 03:42:03.660 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts we have not yet received
 
03:42:05.690 --> 03:42:05.700 align:start position:0%
payment but we anticipate receiving the
 
03:42:07.969 --> 03:42:07.979 align:start position:0%
payment for the years that have been
 
03:42:11.210 --> 03:42:11.220 align:start position:0%
outstanding so at least for one year I
 
03:42:12.969 --> 03:42:12.979 align:start position:0%
left it out of the presentation
 
03:42:15.530 --> 03:42:15.540 align:start position:0%
here for those of you that know it they
 
03:42:18.229 --> 03:42:18.239 align:start position:0%
oversee the flood control payments we
 
03:42:20.870 --> 03:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
have a compact along with Vermont and
 
03:42:23.750 --> 03:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
Connecticut and mass that they provide
 
03:42:25.969 --> 03:42:25.979 align:start position:0%
the towns and the state for the land
 
03:42:28.490 --> 03:42:28.500 align:start position:0%
that was taken for flood control and
 
03:42:31.010 --> 03:42:31.020 align:start position:0%
Mass has been somewhat
 
03:42:33.410 --> 03:42:33.420 align:start position:0%
limited as far as some of the payments
 
03:42:35.570 --> 03:42:35.580 align:start position:0%
yes so that is a very nice way to put it
 
03:42:38.090 --> 03:42:38.100 align:start position:0%
yeah the state is actually made up the
 
03:42:40.250 --> 03:42:40.260 align:start position:0%
holes in the past with General funds to
 
03:42:42.530 --> 03:42:42.540 align:start position:0%
make those communities whole so it's
 
03:42:45.769 --> 03:42:45.779 align:start position:0%
been kind of a nagging problem but the
 
03:42:47.030 --> 03:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner has been very good in
 
03:42:49.729 --> 03:42:49.739 align:start position:0%
trying to keep that together yes so it's
 
03:42:49.739 --> 03:42:50.809 align:start position:0%
trying to keep that together yes so it's
we

03:42:50.809 --> 03:42:50.819 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:42:53.030 --> 03:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
you're okay for this year okay
 
03:42:55.870 --> 03:42:55.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:58.910 --> 03:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
it's not so much a question as it is
 
03:43:01.429 --> 03:43:01.439 align:start position:0%
just a comment so I remember really well
 
03:43:04.370 --> 03:43:04.380 align:start position:0%
the 30 million dollar discussion for the
 
03:43:06.769 --> 03:43:06.779 align:start position:0%
for the rooms I mean I think we've had
 
03:43:09.250 --> 03:43:09.260 align:start position:0%
like this push-pull whether a software
 
03:43:12.229 --> 03:43:12.239 align:start position:0%
update really is an operating issue
 
03:43:14.990 --> 03:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
versus a capital issue but we've
 
03:43:17.630 --> 03:43:17.640 align:start position:0%
reconciled that it it it's going into
 
03:43:20.630 --> 03:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
the capital budget but we I just
 
03:43:22.790 --> 03:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
remember when working on these things
 
03:43:27.110 --> 03:43:27.120 align:start position:0%
the I.T expenses are just enormous and
 
03:43:29.870 --> 03:43:29.880 align:start position:0%
were capped for bonding for General
 
03:43:32.710 --> 03:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
funds at something like
 
03:43:37.790 --> 03:43:37.800 align:start position:0%
120 million and you know 30 million was
 
03:43:40.729 --> 03:43:40.739 align:start position:0%
a huge chunk and it was a really so
 
03:43:42.769 --> 03:43:42.779 align:start position:0%
we've I know that they've really
 
03:43:45.010 --> 03:43:45.020 align:start position:0%
struggled on the capital budget sort of
 
03:43:49.130 --> 03:43:49.140 align:start position:0%
uh weighing the I.T needs against the
 
03:43:52.969 --> 03:43:52.979 align:start position:0%
actual you know Sticks and Bricks or
 
03:43:52.979 --> 03:43:54.050 align:start position:0%
actual you know Sticks and Bricks or
whatever

03:43:54.050 --> 03:43:54.060 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
03:43:56.389 --> 03:43:56.399 align:start position:0%
so yeah right so you know the leaking
 
03:43:59.690 --> 03:43:59.700 align:start position:0%
roofs it's it it creates um
 
03:44:03.969 --> 03:44:03.979 align:start position:0%
creates challenges but obviously the I.T
 
03:44:07.130 --> 03:44:07.140 align:start position:0%
improvements had a huge effect for your
 
03:44:09.410 --> 03:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
age a huge effect
 
03:44:12.889 --> 03:44:12.899 align:start position:0%
um it really has you know brought us
 
03:44:15.290 --> 03:44:15.300 align:start position:0%
into current times
 
03:44:18.410 --> 03:44:18.420 align:start position:0%
um it allows our employees and our
 
03:44:20.809 --> 03:44:20.819 align:start position:0%
managers to operate more efficiently and
 
03:44:23.630 --> 03:44:23.640 align:start position:0%
effectively and you know the benefits to
 
03:44:26.150 --> 03:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers and the tax practitioner
 
03:44:28.130 --> 03:44:28.140 align:start position:0%
Community is there as well so it's
 
03:44:30.110 --> 03:44:30.120 align:start position:0%
really beneficial all around and like I
 
03:44:32.389 --> 03:44:32.399 align:start position:0%
said it was a lot of hard work
 
03:44:34.670 --> 03:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
um but I'm very proud of what we what
 
03:44:38.150 --> 03:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:40.370 --> 03:44:40.380 align:start position:0%
further questions representative McGuire
 
03:44:42.769 --> 03:44:42.779 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman commissioner um
 
03:44:44.090 --> 03:44:44.100 align:start position:0%
did I hear you say at the beginning that
 
03:44:47.150 --> 03:44:47.160 align:start position:0%
15 of the positions are unfilled
 
03:44:50.210 --> 03:44:50.220 align:start position:0%
so instead of these two new positions
 
03:44:52.910 --> 03:44:52.920 align:start position:0%
for experience couldn't you fill a
 
03:44:54.889 --> 03:44:54.899 align:start position:0%
couple of those and and use them in that
 
03:44:59.510 --> 03:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
way so the 15 vacancy rate is for my dra
 
03:44:59.520 --> 03:45:00.710 align:start position:0%
way so the 15 vacancy rate is for my dra
positions

03:45:00.710 --> 03:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
positions
 
03:45:03.950 --> 03:45:03.960 align:start position:0%
two new ones are really doit positions
 
03:45:07.910 --> 03:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
that sit at dra I see okay thank you
 
03:45:09.530 --> 03:45:09.540 align:start position:0%
very much we're worthy of discussion
 
03:45:11.389 --> 03:45:11.399 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah and and
 
03:45:15.170 --> 03:45:15.180 align:start position:0%
um similarly uh call center you said so
 
03:45:17.450 --> 03:45:17.460 align:start position:0%
we now have more online does that mean
 
03:45:20.210 --> 03:45:20.220 align:start position:0%
you've been able to reassign call center
 
03:45:22.790 --> 03:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
people to do other tasks or whatever we
 
03:45:25.490 --> 03:45:25.500 align:start position:0%
do so our five-person call center their
 
03:45:28.030 --> 03:45:28.040 align:start position:0%
primary function is to answer the phones
 
03:45:30.590 --> 03:45:30.600 align:start position:0%
in a time where we don't get a lot of
 
03:45:32.269 --> 03:45:32.279 align:start position:0%
phone calls they are also trained to do
 
03:45:34.010 --> 03:45:34.020 align:start position:0%
other account maintenance work so if
 
03:45:35.450 --> 03:45:35.460 align:start position:0%
times are slow they're not just sitting
 
03:45:36.650 --> 03:45:36.660 align:start position:0%
there twiddling in their thumbs waiting
 
03:45:38.269 --> 03:45:38.279 align:start position:0%
for the phone call to come in they have
 
03:45:40.790 --> 03:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
other work to do alternatively there are
 
03:45:42.170 --> 03:45:42.180 align:start position:0%
times like during tax filing season
 
03:45:43.790 --> 03:45:43.800 align:start position:0%
where five people would never be enough
 
03:45:45.349 --> 03:45:45.359 align:start position:0%
to answer all the calls and we would
 
03:45:47.690 --> 03:45:47.700 align:start position:0%
have really long wait times so we also
 
03:45:49.610 --> 03:45:49.620 align:start position:0%
have other members of staff that are
 
03:45:51.710 --> 03:45:51.720 align:start position:0%
trained to supplement the call center
 
03:45:55.130 --> 03:45:55.140 align:start position:0%
during those higher peak times so it but
 
03:45:56.870 --> 03:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
again rims is one of the things that has
 
03:45:59.330 --> 03:45:59.340 align:start position:0%
allowed us to better do that because
 
03:46:01.670 --> 03:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
there's simple things in rims there's a
 
03:46:03.889 --> 03:46:03.899 align:start position:0%
button that says get next task
 
03:46:05.570 --> 03:46:05.580 align:start position:0%
so you don't have to go searching for
 
03:46:07.250 --> 03:46:07.260 align:start position:0%
work if you have a couple of slow
 
03:46:09.349 --> 03:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
minutes on the phones you can log into
 
03:46:10.790 --> 03:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
rims and just say give me something to
 
03:46:12.710 --> 03:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
do and it pops something up for you to
 
03:46:14.330 --> 03:46:14.340 align:start position:0%
do yeah
 
03:46:16.910 --> 03:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
yeah may I ask one more sure what's the
 
03:46:19.610 --> 03:46:19.620 align:start position:0%
least efficient tax to collect in the
 
03:46:22.490 --> 03:46:22.500 align:start position:0%
sense that the collection cost is is a
 
03:46:24.290 --> 03:46:24.300 align:start position:0%
higher percentage of the amount
 
03:46:24.300 --> 03:46:28.309 align:start position:0%
higher percentage of the amount
collected

03:46:28.309 --> 03:46:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:31.610 --> 03:46:31.620 align:start position:0%
I would probably just by Logic be those
 
03:46:33.950 --> 03:46:33.960 align:start position:0%
taxes that
 
03:46:35.690 --> 03:46:35.700 align:start position:0%
um generate the smallest amount of
 
03:46:35.700 --> 03:46:37.429 align:start position:0%
um generate the smallest amount of
Revenue

03:46:37.429 --> 03:46:37.439 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
03:46:41.210 --> 03:46:41.220 align:start position:0%
um so if you look on slide 11
 
03:46:41.220 --> 03:46:42.550 align:start position:0%
um so if you look on slide 11
um

03:46:42.550 --> 03:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:45.530 --> 03:46:45.540 align:start position:0%
the you know communication Services tax
 
03:46:49.130 --> 03:46:49.140 align:start position:0%
is just under 30 million I mean you know
 
03:46:52.309 --> 03:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
you'll see when you get our uh
 
03:46:54.530 --> 03:46:54.540 align:start position:0%
our operating budget we're nowhere near
 
03:46:56.210 --> 03:46:56.220 align:start position:0%
30 million
 
03:46:59.750 --> 03:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
um dollars spent in total at dra so I
 
03:47:01.610 --> 03:47:01.620 align:start position:0%
don't think there's anything that
 
03:47:02.870 --> 03:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:47:04.910 --> 03:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
flips the wrong way where it costs more
 
03:47:07.969 --> 03:47:07.979 align:start position:0%
to collect it than we generate but those
 
03:47:12.229 --> 03:47:12.239 align:start position:0%
smaller taxes maybe the one most
 
03:47:12.239 --> 03:47:13.849 align:start position:0%
smaller taxes maybe the one most
um

03:47:13.849 --> 03:47:13.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:16.429 --> 03:47:16.439 align:start position:0%
that would fall into that category
 
03:47:18.950 --> 03:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
would be and will be the interest in
 
03:47:22.309 --> 03:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
dividends tax as it phases out and it
 
03:47:25.429 --> 03:47:25.439 align:start position:0%
gets to that you know two percent one
 
03:47:25.439 --> 03:47:27.170 align:start position:0%
gets to that you know two percent one
percent

03:47:27.170 --> 03:47:27.180 align:start position:0%
percent
 
03:47:30.769 --> 03:47:30.779 align:start position:0%
um tax rate there are 70 roughly 70 to
 
03:47:33.410 --> 03:47:33.420 align:start position:0%
75 000 taxpayers of the interest in
 
03:47:36.950 --> 03:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
dividends tax they file a five-page form
 
03:47:39.469 --> 03:47:39.479 align:start position:0%
with us every year
 
03:47:42.110 --> 03:47:42.120 align:start position:0%
um so there is a lot of administration
 
03:47:44.929 --> 03:47:44.939 align:start position:0%
that goes into that tax and when that
 
03:47:47.450 --> 03:47:47.460 align:start position:0%
tax rate gets quite low granted it's
 
03:47:48.889 --> 03:47:48.899 align:start position:0%
only going to be for a brief period of
 
03:47:50.990 --> 03:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
time but as that tax rate gets quite low
 
03:47:54.710 --> 03:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
we're doing a lot of work for not a lot
 
03:47:56.750 --> 03:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
of paper there it's a lot of paper for a
 
03:47:58.910 --> 03:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
lot of not a lot of Revenue
 
03:48:00.170 --> 03:48:00.180 align:start position:0%
I was hoping you're going to say the
 
03:48:00.180 --> 03:48:01.130 align:start position:0%
I was hoping you're going to say the
railroad

03:48:01.130 --> 03:48:01.140 align:start position:0%
railroad
 
03:48:01.140 --> 03:48:02.389 align:start position:0%
railroad
[Laughter]

03:48:02.389 --> 03:48:02.399 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
03:48:07.730 --> 03:48:07.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:07.740 --> 03:48:09.349 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

03:48:09.349 --> 03:48:09.359 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
03:48:12.110 --> 03:48:12.120 align:start position:0%
Ed so you said about 75 000 interest in
 
03:48:14.150 --> 03:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
dividends that that many taxpayers yeah
 
03:48:16.429 --> 03:48:16.439 align:start position:0%
and a lot of those are zero returns
 
03:48:19.010 --> 03:48:19.020 align:start position:0%
right so they currently meet the filing
 
03:48:22.010 --> 03:48:22.020 align:start position:0%
threshold but there is also an exemption
 
03:48:24.290 --> 03:48:24.300 align:start position:0%
that's equal to the filing threshold so
 
03:48:26.450 --> 03:48:26.460 align:start position:0%
they have to file but they don't have to
 
03:48:29.990 --> 03:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
pay so they file a five-page return with
 
03:48:32.030 --> 03:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
no money
 
03:48:34.490 --> 03:48:34.500 align:start position:0%
well seeing no more questions
 
03:48:36.650 --> 03:48:36.660 align:start position:0%
um Lindsay's one of our my favorite
 
03:48:40.130 --> 03:48:40.140 align:start position:0%
Commissioners she had a huge shoes to
 
03:48:43.550 --> 03:48:43.560 align:start position:0%
fill when John beardmore left and you're
 
03:48:45.530 --> 03:48:45.540 align:start position:0%
you've more than filled his shoes you do
 
03:48:46.910 --> 03:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
great job thank you very much great
 
03:48:49.070 --> 03:48:49.080 align:start position:0%
confidence thank you
 
03:48:52.670 --> 03:48:52.680 align:start position:0%
all right I did receive uh
 
03:48:55.670 --> 03:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
a communication from the speaker that
 
03:48:58.309 --> 03:48:58.319 align:start position:0%
it's now over 15 below zero air
 
03:49:01.190 --> 03:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
temperature outside so if anyone is down
 
03:49:03.950 --> 03:49:03.960 align:start position:0%
at stores they are welcome to go get
 
03:49:05.690 --> 03:49:05.700 align:start position:0%
their vehicle and bring them into the
 
03:49:07.729 --> 03:49:07.739 align:start position:0%
LLB parking garage there's plenty of
 
03:49:10.429 --> 03:49:10.439 align:start position:0%
spaces so any of you that are down at
 
03:49:13.550 --> 03:49:13.560 align:start position:0%
stores yeah yeah
 
03:49:15.710 --> 03:49:15.720 align:start position:0%
you're welcome to go and get your car
 
03:49:17.210 --> 03:49:17.220 align:start position:0%
and bring them up because it's only
 
03:49:19.070 --> 03:49:19.080 align:start position:0%
going to get colder so
 
03:49:22.010 --> 03:49:22.020 align:start position:0%
and we do have a good 10 minutes before
 
03:49:23.870 --> 03:49:23.880 align:start position:0%
we start again
 
03:49:25.550 --> 03:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
thanks Lindsay thank you all very much
 
04:01:08.510 --> 04:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:15.410 --> 04:01:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:17.510 --> 04:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
well I think it would be better if you
 
04:01:19.969 --> 04:01:19.979 align:start position:0%
sat by yourself no you're absolutely
 
04:01:24.650 --> 04:01:24.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:26.929 --> 04:01:26.939 align:start position:0%
and if you turn you know there you go hi
 
04:01:28.429 --> 04:01:28.439 align:start position:0%
I'm Charlie arlinghaus I'm the
 
04:01:30.110 --> 04:01:30.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner of
 
04:01:33.590 --> 04:01:33.600 align:start position:0%
um administrative services
 
04:01:36.229 --> 04:01:36.239 align:start position:0%
of something
 
04:01:40.429 --> 04:01:40.439 align:start position:0%
and a constituent of one of yours
 
04:01:42.769 --> 04:01:42.779 align:start position:0%
so because I live in Canterbury
 
04:01:44.809 --> 04:01:44.819 align:start position:0%
there you go
 
04:01:44.819 --> 04:01:46.670 align:start position:0%
there you go
um

04:01:46.670 --> 04:01:46.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:01:48.830 --> 04:01:48.840 align:start position:0%
so I'm sorry with me Cassie Keane is our
 
04:01:50.750 --> 04:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner Karen rentomaki is
 
04:01:51.889 --> 04:01:51.899 align:start position:0%
our director of plant and property
 
04:01:53.330 --> 04:01:53.340 align:start position:0%
because I figured we might get into
 
04:01:55.070 --> 04:01:55.080 align:start position:0%
property issues
 
04:01:56.689 --> 04:01:56.699 align:start position:0%
um and Sherry Rockburn who's our
 
04:01:58.010 --> 04:01:58.020 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner would have been
 
04:02:01.490 --> 04:02:01.500 align:start position:0%
here but um as you may know that this is
 
04:02:03.950 --> 04:02:03.960 align:start position:0%
High season for the budget and I believe
 
04:02:06.170 --> 04:02:06.180 align:start position:0%
that she's connected at the hip to the
 
04:02:08.630 --> 04:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
governor's budget director this week so
 
04:02:12.170 --> 04:02:12.180 align:start position:0%
I excused her for being here I wanted to
 
04:02:13.790 --> 04:02:13.800 align:start position:0%
talk to you a little bit about
 
04:02:15.530 --> 04:02:15.540 align:start position:0%
um I thought about this presentation a
 
04:02:16.309 --> 04:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
04:02:17.510 --> 04:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
um before
 
04:02:19.250 --> 04:02:19.260 align:start position:0%
that's a good sign right that I thought
 
04:02:21.410 --> 04:02:21.420 align:start position:0%
about it before I came here
 
04:02:23.450 --> 04:02:23.460 align:start position:0%
um I thought about a little bit and what
 
04:02:25.969 --> 04:02:25.979 align:start position:0%
what was a good thing to do when and uh
 
04:02:27.530 --> 04:02:27.540 align:start position:0%
most of the numbers have been removed
 
04:02:28.790 --> 04:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
from the presentation because I think
 
04:02:30.410 --> 04:02:30.420 align:start position:0%
that would be useful
 
04:02:32.990 --> 04:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
um who are we and what do we do uh or
 
04:02:34.910 --> 04:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
who are we and why are we here that's an
 
04:02:36.710 --> 04:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
another question
 
04:02:36.720 --> 04:02:37.670 align:start position:0%
another question
um

04:02:37.670 --> 04:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:02:39.530 --> 04:02:39.540 align:start position:0%
I want to talk about who we are more
 
04:02:41.210 --> 04:02:41.220 align:start position:0%
broadly speaking though I'm going to get
 
04:02:42.830 --> 04:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
into a little bit about how we're sort
 
04:02:45.170 --> 04:02:45.180 align:start position:0%
of two different pieces of agency and
 
04:02:46.910 --> 04:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
I'll it'll be the one number I talk
 
04:02:48.889 --> 04:02:48.899 align:start position:0%
about we're essentially retiree health
 
04:02:51.469 --> 04:02:51.479 align:start position:0%
and we're an agency and I'm going to
 
04:02:52.969 --> 04:02:52.979 align:start position:0%
talk to you at first about the agency
 
04:02:54.769 --> 04:02:54.779 align:start position:0%
administrative Services is kind of a
 
04:02:56.870 --> 04:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
weird thing when you think about it it's
 
04:02:59.210 --> 04:02:59.220 align:start position:0%
not descriptive in most particular ways
 
04:03:01.370 --> 04:03:01.380 align:start position:0%
like if banking is here you'll probably
 
04:03:03.410 --> 04:03:03.420 align:start position:0%
understand that they do banking
 
04:03:05.389 --> 04:03:05.399 align:start position:0%
and that if the Liquor Commission is
 
04:03:06.950 --> 04:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
here you probably would guess that they
 
04:03:08.750 --> 04:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
sell liquor and if Insurance were here
 
04:03:11.750 --> 04:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
you would think anybody Insurance
 
04:03:13.610 --> 04:03:13.620 align:start position:0%
um and you'd be right and administrative
 
04:03:16.389 --> 04:03:16.399 align:start position:0%
Services people like oh so you service
 
04:03:19.570 --> 04:03:19.580 align:start position:0%
administrative things or it's not clear
 
04:03:22.910 --> 04:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
we're uh we're a diverse agency that's
 
04:03:24.590 --> 04:03:24.600 align:start position:0%
often difficult to describe but if you
 
04:03:25.550 --> 04:03:25.560 align:start position:0%
think about it we have eight major
 
04:03:27.530 --> 04:03:27.540 align:start position:0%
divisions um that we do and I'm going to
 
04:03:29.090 --> 04:03:29.100 align:start position:0%
go into them in more depth but a quick
 
04:03:31.849 --> 04:03:31.859 align:start position:0%
overview the state budget office is part
 
04:03:34.550 --> 04:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
of our agency and it's um you know to
 
04:03:36.170 --> 04:03:36.180 align:start position:0%
say budget is obviously a big thing
 
04:03:38.929 --> 04:03:38.939 align:start position:0%
probably this committee is aware of that
 
04:03:41.330 --> 04:03:41.340 align:start position:0%
um accounting services is one of our
 
04:03:42.950 --> 04:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
agencies in some states the Comptroller
 
04:03:45.110 --> 04:03:45.120 align:start position:0%
is an elected official
 
04:03:46.790 --> 04:03:46.800 align:start position:0%
um in New Hampshire it's it's one of our
 
04:03:49.370 --> 04:03:49.380 align:start position:0%
division directors in this agency we do
 
04:03:50.870 --> 04:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
the state's books we don't do the books
 
04:03:52.910 --> 04:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
every year we we couldn't open for
 
04:03:54.410 --> 04:03:54.420 align:start position:0%
business the next year which would be
 
04:03:56.990 --> 04:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
awkward being a state government
 
04:03:58.670 --> 04:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
um to say the least purchasing one of
 
04:04:00.290 --> 04:04:00.300 align:start position:0%
the oldest pieces of our agency is
 
04:04:03.349 --> 04:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
actually purchasing started in 1915
 
04:04:05.150 --> 04:04:05.160 align:start position:0%
the state hired a purchasing agent but
 
04:04:07.250 --> 04:04:07.260 align:start position:0%
we buy things we we do Statewide
 
04:04:09.590 --> 04:04:09.600 align:start position:0%
procurement a lot of ancillary functions
 
04:04:11.510 --> 04:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
that are associated but that's that's
 
04:04:13.010 --> 04:04:13.020 align:start position:0%
one of them
 
04:04:14.570 --> 04:04:14.580 align:start position:0%
um what used to be called fdm and it's
 
04:04:16.309 --> 04:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
now called eam which is the state's
 
04:04:17.750 --> 04:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
computer system we don't do the hardware
 
04:04:20.689 --> 04:04:20.699 align:start position:0%
that's the oit but the giant piece of
 
04:04:22.250 --> 04:04:22.260 align:start position:0%
software the enterprise system that
 
04:04:24.950 --> 04:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
governs everything we do Budget Finance
 
04:04:27.469 --> 04:04:27.479 align:start position:0%
the payment of more than 12 000 people
 
04:04:29.210 --> 04:04:29.220 align:start position:0%
every two weeks
 
04:04:31.729 --> 04:04:31.739 align:start position:0%
um their paycheck is within our agency
 
04:04:33.469 --> 04:04:33.479 align:start position:0%
that's a really big function that's
 
04:04:37.729 --> 04:04:37.739 align:start position:0%
often not noticed we do risks and
 
04:04:39.170 --> 04:04:39.180 align:start position:0%
benefits the state's health care plan
 
04:04:41.809 --> 04:04:41.819 align:start position:0%
various insurance policies Etc it's a
 
04:04:44.090 --> 04:04:44.100 align:start position:0%
very important thing the paycheck may be
 
04:04:45.469 --> 04:04:45.479 align:start position:0%
the most important thing to most state
 
04:04:46.969 --> 04:04:46.979 align:start position:0%
employees their health insurance is
 
04:04:50.510 --> 04:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
probably almost certainly the second
 
04:04:52.610 --> 04:04:52.620 align:start position:0%
um and and that's a big function very
 
04:04:55.090 --> 04:04:55.100 align:start position:0%
complicated function that we perform
 
04:04:58.490 --> 04:04:58.500 align:start position:0%
Statewide Personnel offices are is part
 
04:05:00.490 --> 04:05:00.500 align:start position:0%
of our agency the division of personnel
 
04:05:03.050 --> 04:05:03.060 align:start position:0%
Public Works is one of the pieces of our
 
04:05:05.030 --> 04:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
agency see we don't build roads and
 
04:05:07.309 --> 04:05:07.319 align:start position:0%
bridges that's dot but everything else
 
04:05:08.990 --> 04:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
we're responsible for building we have a
 
04:05:11.330 --> 04:05:11.340 align:start position:0%
team of Architects and Engineers who any
 
04:05:12.830 --> 04:05:12.840 align:start position:0%
project over twenty five thousand
 
04:05:12.840 --> 04:05:14.450 align:start position:0%
project over twenty five thousand
dollars

04:05:14.450 --> 04:05:14.460 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:05:16.370 --> 04:05:16.380 align:start position:0%
so save that thought because we have
 
04:05:18.710 --> 04:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
some questions on Public Works projects
 
04:05:23.570 --> 04:05:23.580 align:start position:0%
I bet you will so and then uh somewhat
 
04:05:25.070 --> 04:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
related to that is plant and property
 
04:05:26.450 --> 04:05:26.460 align:start position:0%
it's actually our largest division it's
 
04:05:28.309 --> 04:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
Karen by the way
 
04:05:29.990 --> 04:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
um is uh
 
04:05:33.110 --> 04:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
um and Karen is an engineer Cassie's a
 
04:05:34.849 --> 04:05:34.859 align:start position:0%
lawyer and I I have no discernible
 
04:05:38.030 --> 04:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
talent and so that's that's why I'm here
 
04:05:41.150 --> 04:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
um and so we uh we manage more than 91
 
04:05:43.550 --> 04:05:43.560 align:start position:0%
state buildings and we manage them
 
04:05:45.650 --> 04:05:45.660 align:start position:0%
within the appropriation which with
 
04:05:48.469 --> 04:05:48.479 align:start position:0%
which were granted which is to say that
 
04:05:50.450 --> 04:05:50.460 align:start position:0%
we do the best we can with the money we
 
04:05:52.790 --> 04:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
have and if you've been in some state
 
04:05:54.590 --> 04:05:54.600 align:start position:0%
buildings you walk around and go it's
 
04:05:56.269 --> 04:05:56.279 align:start position:0%
pretty nice
 
04:05:57.769 --> 04:05:57.779 align:start position:0%
if you've been in other state buildings
 
04:05:59.870 --> 04:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
that's not what you say
 
04:06:01.969 --> 04:06:01.979 align:start position:0%
um and we can have a meeting sometime in
 
04:06:03.650 --> 04:06:03.660 align:start position:0%
the conference room that I use most days
 
04:06:06.290 --> 04:06:06.300 align:start position:0%
in our basement and everybody from the
 
04:06:08.330 --> 04:06:08.340 align:start position:0%
outside who comes in goes like this oh
 
04:06:10.790 --> 04:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
this is
 
04:06:10.800 --> 04:06:12.530 align:start position:0%
this is
scary

04:06:12.530 --> 04:06:12.540 align:start position:0%
scary
 
04:06:14.630 --> 04:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
um but but like I say we do the best we
 
04:06:16.610 --> 04:06:16.620 align:start position:0%
can and we do and a great staff that
 
04:06:18.769 --> 04:06:18.779 align:start position:0%
does a really good job it's a lot of
 
04:06:20.870 --> 04:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
diverse functions and there there's a
 
04:06:22.250 --> 04:06:22.260 align:start position:0%
weirdness to it if you think of that
 
04:06:24.410 --> 04:06:24.420 align:start position:0%
Spectrum I'm going to use two examples
 
04:06:27.469 --> 04:06:27.479 align:start position:0%
Public Works and personnel
 
04:06:30.410 --> 04:06:30.420 align:start position:0%
nobody I feel confident in saying this
 
04:06:31.910 --> 04:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
has ever applied to both of those
 
04:06:33.530 --> 04:06:33.540 align:start position:0%
divisions for a job
 
04:06:34.969 --> 04:06:34.979 align:start position:0%
and it's thinking well I was going to go
 
04:06:36.349 --> 04:06:36.359 align:start position:0%
with architect but I'm thinking to do an
 
04:06:38.150 --> 04:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
HR instead
 
04:06:40.130 --> 04:06:40.140 align:start position:0%
um and so why are they both part of
 
04:06:42.830 --> 04:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
administrative Services it's weird
 
04:06:44.210 --> 04:06:44.220 align:start position:0%
um what we have in common is that we're
 
04:06:46.130 --> 04:06:46.140 align:start position:0%
a central Service Agency
 
04:06:47.750 --> 04:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
we don't regulate Banks we don't sell
 
04:06:49.849 --> 04:06:49.859 align:start position:0%
liquor we don't we don't run the lottery
 
04:06:51.290 --> 04:06:51.300 align:start position:0%
we don't run the state's Medicaid
 
04:06:53.389 --> 04:06:53.399 align:start position:0%
Program but none of those people can do
 
04:06:55.070 --> 04:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
their job if we don't do ours not a
 
04:06:57.410 --> 04:06:57.420 align:start position:0%
single one every day in every way
 
04:07:00.290 --> 04:07:00.300 align:start position:0%
everything that we do impacts the entire
 
04:07:02.870 --> 04:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
rest of state government we deal on a
 
04:07:05.389 --> 04:07:05.399 align:start position:0%
daily basis with with essentially every
 
04:07:07.790 --> 04:07:07.800 align:start position:0%
other department some not daily but
 
04:07:09.469 --> 04:07:09.479 align:start position:0%
there's none that we don't deal with at
 
04:07:11.809 --> 04:07:11.819 align:start position:0%
least once a week and there's an
 
04:07:13.550 --> 04:07:13.560 align:start position:0%
enormous responsibility in that there's
 
04:07:15.229 --> 04:07:15.239 align:start position:0%
a there's an honor in that a privilege
 
04:07:18.349 --> 04:07:18.359 align:start position:0%
in it too and it's a privileged um I
 
04:07:20.210 --> 04:07:20.220 align:start position:0%
talk about it actually when we when we
 
04:07:22.130 --> 04:07:22.140 align:start position:0%
do hiring I do a I do a final interview
 
04:07:25.189 --> 04:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
with um everybody that we hire and it's
 
04:07:26.689 --> 04:07:26.699 align:start position:0%
one of the things I talk about there's a
 
04:07:28.790 --> 04:07:28.800 align:start position:0%
there's an honor it's a lot of work it's
 
04:07:30.229 --> 04:07:30.239 align:start position:0%
a ton of work and it's a ton of work
 
04:07:32.030 --> 04:07:32.040 align:start position:0%
that we that we try to do the best we
 
04:07:34.189 --> 04:07:34.199 align:start position:0%
can with the resources that we have but
 
04:07:35.929 --> 04:07:35.939 align:start position:0%
you know that every day people are
 
04:07:38.750 --> 04:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
relying on you and and
 
04:07:41.090 --> 04:07:41.100 align:start position:0%
um I like that some people like to work
 
04:07:43.670 --> 04:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
in a closet by themselves I'm not one of
 
04:07:45.950 --> 04:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
those we're part of a team
 
04:07:47.929 --> 04:07:47.939 align:start position:0%
Richard Petty doesn't win the race by
 
04:07:50.450 --> 04:07:50.460 align:start position:0%
driving left all day right and and I
 
04:07:51.889 --> 04:07:51.899 align:start position:0%
hope everybody knows who Richard Petty
 
04:07:51.899 --> 04:07:52.729 align:start position:0%
hope everybody knows who Richard Petty
is

04:07:52.729 --> 04:07:52.739 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:07:55.309 --> 04:07:55.319 align:start position:0%
um the crew uh is critically important
 
04:07:56.570 --> 04:07:56.580 align:start position:0%
to that the people who tune the engine
 
04:07:58.010 --> 04:07:58.020 align:start position:0%
the people change the tires and people
 
04:08:00.050 --> 04:08:00.060 align:start position:0%
put gas in the car and that's who we are
 
04:08:01.849 --> 04:08:01.859 align:start position:0%
we're the crew
 
04:08:01.859 --> 04:08:03.170 align:start position:0%
we're the crew
um

04:08:03.170 --> 04:08:03.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:05.570 --> 04:08:05.580 align:start position:0%
I'll mention I went through the
 
04:08:07.610 --> 04:08:07.620 align:start position:0%
divisions and and I'm happy to talk in
 
04:08:09.889 --> 04:08:09.899 align:start position:0%
in a greater detail
 
04:08:11.929 --> 04:08:11.939 align:start position:0%
um about some of them but
 
04:08:14.150 --> 04:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
um just some of the high points Health
 
04:08:17.630 --> 04:08:17.640 align:start position:0%
Care risk and benefits uh it's a 500 500
 
04:08:19.370 --> 04:08:19.380 align:start position:0%
million dollar per biennium health care
 
04:08:21.469 --> 04:08:21.479 align:start position:0%
plan it's a big spend it's a big piece
 
04:08:22.610 --> 04:08:22.620 align:start position:0%
of what you do
 
04:08:24.349 --> 04:08:24.359 align:start position:0%
but one of the biggest chunks of that is
 
04:08:26.450 --> 04:08:26.460 align:start position:0%
retiree health and I'll talk to you in a
 
04:08:28.010 --> 04:08:28.020 align:start position:0%
minute about how
 
04:08:30.110 --> 04:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
retiree health is a benefit that's paid
 
04:08:31.849 --> 04:08:31.859 align:start position:0%
it's not an operation of the department
 
04:08:35.030 --> 04:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
it's something that we operate but when
 
04:08:37.250 --> 04:08:37.260 align:start position:0%
we budget like like you you don't look
 
04:08:38.689 --> 04:08:38.699 align:start position:0%
at it and go I need you to lapse more
 
04:08:40.729 --> 04:08:40.739 align:start position:0%
out of retiree health I need you to cut
 
04:08:42.349 --> 04:08:42.359 align:start position:0%
you know four percent across the board
 
04:08:44.689 --> 04:08:44.699 align:start position:0%
and eliminate positions now it's half of
 
04:08:47.150 --> 04:08:47.160 align:start position:0%
our Department's budget but it's a it's
 
04:08:49.370 --> 04:08:49.380 align:start position:0%
a big uh it's a big thing it's a big
 
04:08:51.590 --> 04:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
benefit that we provide
 
04:08:54.410 --> 04:08:54.420 align:start position:0%
um accounting the department was created
 
04:08:55.849 --> 04:08:55.859 align:start position:0%
um although pieces of a date back
 
04:08:58.370 --> 04:08:58.380 align:start position:0%
further was created as the office of the
 
04:09:00.830 --> 04:09:00.840 align:start position:0%
Comptroller and before that the state
 
04:09:03.590 --> 04:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
didn't have a budget in 1931 and what
 
04:09:04.910 --> 04:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
would happen is agencies would run out
 
04:09:06.110 --> 04:09:06.120 align:start position:0%
of money three quarters his way through
 
04:09:07.790 --> 04:09:07.800 align:start position:0%
a year and would come back to the
 
04:09:09.590 --> 04:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
legislature and go hey we're out can we
 
04:09:10.729 --> 04:09:10.739 align:start position:0%
have some more
 
04:09:12.590 --> 04:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
and somebody decided that wasn't an
 
04:09:13.910 --> 04:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate way to do business and that
 
04:09:16.490 --> 04:09:16.500 align:start position:0%
we should have a budget that function if
 
04:09:18.050 --> 04:09:18.060 align:start position:0%
you read the original Law the state
 
04:09:19.610 --> 04:09:19.620 align:start position:0%
budget law hasn't really changed
 
04:09:21.710 --> 04:09:21.720 align:start position:0%
dramatically there's some important
 
04:09:23.510 --> 04:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
differences but not dramatically since
 
04:09:26.389 --> 04:09:26.399 align:start position:0%
then but we pre-audit payments to make
 
04:09:27.590 --> 04:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
sure that when you write a check you
 
04:09:29.689 --> 04:09:29.699 align:start position:0%
have money in your budget to pay the
 
04:09:31.550 --> 04:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
check that's a very important thing it's
 
04:09:33.229 --> 04:09:33.239 align:start position:0%
not something that was done before that
 
04:09:36.889 --> 04:09:36.899 align:start position:0%
and um you know we process more than 200
 
04:09:39.110 --> 04:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
000 audited payments a year which is you
 
04:09:40.790 --> 04:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
know kind of a lot
 
04:09:42.769 --> 04:09:42.779 align:start position:0%
um and that in that division oversees
 
04:09:46.189 --> 04:09:46.199 align:start position:0%
State Payroll which is you know always
 
04:09:47.750 --> 04:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
it's not a matter of sitting down
 
04:09:49.610 --> 04:09:49.620 align:start position:0%
writing a couple of paychecks it's as a
 
04:09:52.670 --> 04:09:52.680 align:start position:0%
complicated accounting process involved
 
04:09:53.750 --> 04:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
in that
 
04:09:55.849 --> 04:09:55.859 align:start position:0%
um software like I say the state the
 
04:09:57.769 --> 04:09:57.779 align:start position:0%
piece of software that runs state
 
04:09:57.779 --> 04:09:58.790 align:start position:0%
piece of software that runs state
government

04:09:58.790 --> 04:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
government
 
04:10:00.710 --> 04:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
um is managed by eam
 
04:10:02.630 --> 04:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
the facility management I talked about
 
04:10:05.269 --> 04:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
91 buildings more than 4 million square
 
04:10:07.550 --> 04:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
feet of office space
 
04:10:09.290 --> 04:10:09.300 align:start position:0%
um probably more than 3 million square
 
04:10:11.389 --> 04:10:11.399 align:start position:0%
feet in the city of Concord alone we
 
04:10:13.130 --> 04:10:13.140 align:start position:0%
manage Court facilities we manage this
 
04:10:16.910 --> 04:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
building we manage a lot of buildings in
 
04:10:19.130 --> 04:10:19.140 align:start position:0%
Concord and all across the state that is
 
04:10:21.290 --> 04:10:21.300 align:start position:0%
a complicated process and it's why I
 
04:10:24.469 --> 04:10:24.479 align:start position:0%
talked to Karen more than
 
04:10:26.389 --> 04:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
almost anybody because there's always
 
04:10:26.399 --> 04:10:27.830 align:start position:0%
almost anybody because there's always
something

04:10:27.830 --> 04:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
something
 
04:10:29.990 --> 04:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
breaking I was gonna say braking
 
04:10:31.969 --> 04:10:31.979 align:start position:0%
um that we're improving how about that
 
04:10:34.729 --> 04:10:34.739 align:start position:0%
there's always something getting better
 
04:10:37.130 --> 04:10:37.140 align:start position:0%
um like this weekend I haven't I have an
 
04:10:39.469 --> 04:10:39.479 align:start position:0%
email in my inbox about what we're doing
 
04:10:42.110 --> 04:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
uh to make sure that negative 15 degree
 
04:10:43.670 --> 04:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
weather doesn't
 
04:10:45.349 --> 04:10:45.359 align:start position:0%
mess us up
 
04:10:48.229 --> 04:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
um and I would say a lot purchasing is a
 
04:10:50.630 --> 04:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
big thing that everyone's aware of
 
04:10:52.429 --> 04:10:52.439 align:start position:0%
um the state buys things and buying
 
04:10:55.189 --> 04:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
things for the state is very different
 
04:10:56.809 --> 04:10:56.819 align:start position:0%
um we manage all the Statewide contracts
 
04:10:58.370 --> 04:10:58.380 align:start position:0%
and we also manage all Commodities
 
04:11:04.189 --> 04:11:04.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:06.349 --> 04:11:06.359 align:start position:0%
it's it's an important function for two
 
04:11:08.269 --> 04:11:08.279 align:start position:0%
reasons one is that you know we we
 
04:11:11.389 --> 04:11:11.399 align:start position:0%
typically almost always bid projects a
 
04:11:13.370 --> 04:11:13.380 align:start position:0%
to get a good price but B so that
 
04:11:15.769 --> 04:11:15.779 align:start position:0%
everyone in the state has a shot at the
 
04:11:17.570 --> 04:11:17.580 align:start position:0%
state's business because we're the
 
04:11:21.170 --> 04:11:21.180 align:start position:0%
government because it's taxpayer dollars
 
04:11:24.290 --> 04:11:24.300 align:start position:0%
um we don't get to say at some point I
 
04:11:26.030 --> 04:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
like Tony we should make sure we let's
 
04:11:27.590 --> 04:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
give tony the contract he's a good guy
 
04:11:29.090 --> 04:11:29.100 align:start position:0%
he'll do a good job
 
04:11:30.830 --> 04:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
Tony doesn't get the contract Tony has
 
04:11:33.170 --> 04:11:33.180 align:start position:0%
to Bid And so can Bob and so can Karen
 
04:11:35.689 --> 04:11:35.699 align:start position:0%
and so can Sally everybody gets to bid
 
04:11:38.150 --> 04:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
and that's a very important function and
 
04:11:39.670 --> 04:11:39.680 align:start position:0%
some responsibility
 
04:11:42.830 --> 04:11:42.840 align:start position:0%
Personnel is a is a big thing everyone
 
04:11:45.950 --> 04:11:45.960 align:start position:0%
knows the challenges right now in hiring
 
04:11:48.650 --> 04:11:48.660 align:start position:0%
um large vacancy rates hiring you know
 
04:11:50.570 --> 04:11:50.580 align:start position:0%
labor labor markets across the country
 
04:11:53.269 --> 04:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
are very tight and it's a problem here
 
04:11:56.689 --> 04:11:56.699 align:start position:0%
we also manage the collective bargaining
 
04:11:58.729 --> 04:11:58.739 align:start position:0%
process it is the governor who signs
 
04:12:00.889 --> 04:12:00.899 align:start position:0%
with the Union I'm sorry what's 15
 
04:12:06.530 --> 04:12:06.540 align:start position:0%
unions 15 14 14. it keeps going up it
 
04:12:07.969 --> 04:12:07.979 align:start position:0%
would be a lot easier if there if there
 
04:12:10.670 --> 04:12:10.680 align:start position:0%
weren't 14 but um
 
04:12:12.410 --> 04:12:12.420 align:start position:0%
um but but we do that that's a big part
 
04:12:14.750 --> 04:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
of the process
 
04:12:18.950 --> 04:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
so since we're on Personnel now I
 
04:12:22.130 --> 04:12:22.140 align:start position:0%
embedded in that division
 
04:12:24.650 --> 04:12:24.660 align:start position:0%
I believe you have a group that looks at
 
04:12:27.170 --> 04:12:27.180 align:start position:0%
salaries and we just heard from Helen
 
04:12:29.570 --> 04:12:29.580 align:start position:0%
Hanks the commissioner of of course you
 
04:12:32.570 --> 04:12:32.580 align:start position:0%
know Corrections and the incoming
 
04:12:34.790 --> 04:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
Corrections Officers are like the lowest
 
04:12:34.800 --> 04:12:35.929 align:start position:0%
Corrections Officers are like the lowest
paid

04:12:35.929 --> 04:12:35.939 align:start position:0%
paid
 
04:12:39.229 --> 04:12:39.239 align:start position:0%
and I believe she's reached out to your
 
04:12:40.849 --> 04:12:40.859 align:start position:0%
group to look at that where does that
 
04:12:42.290 --> 04:12:42.300 align:start position:0%
all stand because as you know that's
 
04:12:44.510 --> 04:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
just one of the many many agencies that
 
04:12:47.570 --> 04:12:47.580 align:start position:0%
are being forced to into long overtime
 
04:12:50.269 --> 04:12:50.279 align:start position:0%
shifts and losing people left and right
 
04:12:53.210 --> 04:12:53.220 align:start position:0%
so where does all that stand well um let
 
04:12:54.950 --> 04:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
me talk more broadly about about
 
04:12:56.450 --> 04:12:56.460 align:start position:0%
personnel and then a little bit about
 
04:12:59.450 --> 04:12:59.460 align:start position:0%
corrections um
 
04:13:02.510 --> 04:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
the state operates in in in two two
 
04:13:02.520 --> 04:13:03.830 align:start position:0%
the state operates in in in two two
different

04:13:03.830 --> 04:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
different
 
04:13:03.840 --> 04:13:05.050 align:start position:0%
different
um

04:13:05.050 --> 04:13:05.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:07.189 --> 04:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
environments that that limit to some
 
04:13:09.830 --> 04:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
extent flexibility and on purpose uh the
 
04:13:12.290 --> 04:13:12.300 align:start position:0%
one is a classification system and the
 
04:13:14.809 --> 04:13:14.819 align:start position:0%
other is a set of Union contracts which
 
04:13:16.790 --> 04:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
which are all designed to say that I
 
04:13:18.830 --> 04:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
can't pay you what I want to pay you I
 
04:13:20.030 --> 04:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
can't say well I think you're doing a
 
04:13:21.710 --> 04:13:21.720 align:start position:0%
good job so I'm gonna I'm gonna give you
 
04:13:23.750 --> 04:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
ten Grand more than I then I give Cassie
 
04:13:26.030 --> 04:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
because she's okay
 
04:13:28.130 --> 04:13:28.140 align:start position:0%
um and uh everybody gets the same amount
 
04:13:30.769 --> 04:13:30.779 align:start position:0%
so in the classification system you are
 
04:13:32.750 --> 04:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
meant to in any large organization in
 
04:13:34.910 --> 04:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
all governments are like this you are
 
04:13:36.410 --> 04:13:36.420 align:start position:0%
meant to analyze every position in
 
04:13:37.670 --> 04:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
government according to a set of
 
04:13:40.309 --> 04:13:40.319 align:start position:0%
criteria that we establish in our case
 
04:13:42.530 --> 04:13:42.540 align:start position:0%
it's a nine Factor plan that was first
 
04:13:46.189 --> 04:13:46.199 align:start position:0%
established in roughly 1950
 
04:13:46.199 --> 04:13:46.870 align:start position:0%
established in roughly 1950
um

04:13:46.870 --> 04:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:50.150 --> 04:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
and you evaluate every position against
 
04:13:52.070 --> 04:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
that and decide what where the position
 
04:13:54.410 --> 04:13:54.420 align:start position:0%
should fall what labor grade and then
 
04:13:56.990 --> 04:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
you assign salaries by steps Etc
 
04:13:59.090 --> 04:13:59.100 align:start position:0%
and in addition to that collective
 
04:14:00.590 --> 04:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
bargaining influences how much people
 
04:14:02.990 --> 04:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
get paid and so Corrections Officers if
 
04:14:04.729 --> 04:14:04.739 align:start position:0%
you will would be classified according
 
04:14:07.849 --> 04:14:07.859 align:start position:0%
to job content is the way to think about
 
04:14:09.830 --> 04:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
that and then they would be placed in
 
04:14:11.689 --> 04:14:11.699 align:start position:0%
the grid but collective bargaining
 
04:14:13.550 --> 04:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
effects that correction officers I think
 
04:14:15.469 --> 04:14:15.479 align:start position:0%
everyone knows this have their salaries
 
04:14:17.630 --> 04:14:17.640 align:start position:0%
have gone up significantly more than
 
04:14:20.090 --> 04:14:20.100 align:start position:0%
average state workers over the last six
 
04:14:23.510 --> 04:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
years and a very large increase in in
 
04:14:25.490 --> 04:14:25.500 align:start position:0%
the 18 collective bargaining I think
 
04:14:27.410 --> 04:14:27.420 align:start position:0%
some don't hold me to something like
 
04:14:29.210 --> 04:14:29.220 align:start position:0%
nine percent when everybody else was got
 
04:14:30.349 --> 04:14:30.359 align:start position:0%
three and a half
 
04:14:32.950 --> 04:14:32.960 align:start position:0%
and then um
 
04:14:37.370 --> 04:14:37.380 align:start position:0%
and then the next year I think they got
 
04:14:39.170 --> 04:14:39.180 align:start position:0%
I think was 14 months but I think that's
 
04:14:43.070 --> 04:14:43.080 align:start position:0%
over three years yeah and so they got a
 
04:14:44.510 --> 04:14:44.520 align:start position:0%
raise one year when nobody else got a
 
04:14:45.889 --> 04:14:45.899 align:start position:0%
raise and then the last year everybody
 
04:14:47.510 --> 04:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
else got the same amount so their
 
04:14:49.070 --> 04:14:49.080 align:start position:0%
salaries have been going up but I know
 
04:14:51.530 --> 04:14:51.540 align:start position:0%
that that it's a challenge because
 
04:14:51.540 --> 04:14:52.130 align:start position:0%
that that it's a challenge because
um

04:14:52.130 --> 04:14:52.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:54.469 --> 04:14:54.479 align:start position:0%
I gather you go through the academy and
 
04:14:56.450 --> 04:14:56.460 align:start position:0%
you're then qualified to do police
 
04:14:59.090 --> 04:14:59.100 align:start position:0%
service and you could do something else
 
04:15:01.189 --> 04:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
in let's just say a town or somewhere
 
04:15:04.429 --> 04:15:04.439 align:start position:0%
else where you might make more money and
 
04:15:06.650 --> 04:15:06.660 align:start position:0%
you don't have to work inside a prison
 
04:15:09.710 --> 04:15:09.720 align:start position:0%
which is occasionally a uh selling point
 
04:15:11.929 --> 04:15:11.939 align:start position:0%
for those jobs so
 
04:15:15.229 --> 04:15:15.239 align:start position:0%
so that's there okay so it's well in
 
04:15:17.570 --> 04:15:17.580 align:start position:0%
your radar I guess well and so one of
 
04:15:18.950 --> 04:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
the things you you can do with any
 
04:15:20.630 --> 04:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
position is any group of employees can
 
04:15:22.790 --> 04:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
position uh petition or a supervisor
 
04:15:25.250 --> 04:15:25.260 align:start position:0%
hiring manager can look at a
 
04:15:27.229 --> 04:15:27.239 align:start position:0%
classification right because it's never
 
04:15:29.330 --> 04:15:29.340 align:start position:0%
a position I mean it can be opposition
 
04:15:31.490 --> 04:15:31.500 align:start position:0%
that's misaligned and you ask them to
 
04:15:33.050 --> 04:15:33.060 align:start position:0%
look at it and say is it correctly
 
04:15:35.389 --> 04:15:35.399 align:start position:0%
aligned is it correctly allocated or
 
04:15:37.790 --> 04:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
classified classified as a word we
 
04:15:39.229 --> 04:15:39.239 align:start position:0%
typically use for a group of them we
 
04:15:41.389 --> 04:15:41.399 align:start position:0%
often say an allocation and there is a
 
04:15:43.849 --> 04:15:43.859 align:start position:0%
reallocation analysis being done on that
 
04:15:45.950 --> 04:15:45.960 align:start position:0%
I don't actually know where the status
 
04:15:47.389 --> 04:15:47.399 align:start position:0%
of it but I could look it up you don't
 
04:15:50.990 --> 04:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
know do you I don't so that's that yeah
 
04:15:53.030 --> 04:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
if you could get back to Mr Hoffman or
 
04:15:55.130 --> 04:15:55.140 align:start position:0%
Melissa yeah I'll let you know where we
 
04:15:58.490 --> 04:15:58.500 align:start position:0%
stand early on our radar absolutely to
 
04:16:00.410 --> 04:16:00.420 align:start position:0%
say one more thing on the Personnel
 
04:16:02.389 --> 04:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
issue well we're there yes
 
04:16:05.750 --> 04:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
so a year or so maybe less ago you came
 
04:16:08.570 --> 04:16:08.580 align:start position:0%
to fiscal for an incentive package to
 
04:16:11.990 --> 04:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
try to keep people here and how is that
 
04:16:13.550 --> 04:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
going is that
 
04:16:16.670 --> 04:16:16.680 align:start position:0%
helped at all or I think I don't know
 
04:16:18.170 --> 04:16:18.180 align:start position:0%
that I don't want to claim we've done a
 
04:16:22.910 --> 04:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:25.010 --> 04:16:25.020 align:start position:0%
there's an incent there are a set of
 
04:16:26.689 --> 04:16:26.699 align:start position:0%
incentive payments that have been passed
 
04:16:28.849 --> 04:16:28.859 align:start position:0%
for for various groups of people one is
 
04:16:30.950 --> 04:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
correction officers and and some other
 
04:16:33.830 --> 04:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
people who work at 24 7 facilities in an
 
04:16:35.689 --> 04:16:35.699 align:start position:0%
attempt to retain that
 
04:16:38.330 --> 04:16:38.340 align:start position:0%
staff and um
 
04:16:41.150 --> 04:16:41.160 align:start position:0%
we I would
 
04:16:43.130 --> 04:16:43.140 align:start position:0%
add this we performed a ministerial
 
04:16:44.809 --> 04:16:44.819 align:start position:0%
function that is to say we carried the
 
04:16:46.910 --> 04:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
paperwork to you yeah
 
04:16:49.370 --> 04:16:49.380 align:start position:0%
who who got the who got the incentive
 
04:16:52.370 --> 04:16:52.380 align:start position:0%
payments for example not a single person
 
04:16:54.110 --> 04:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
who works for me
 
04:16:56.570 --> 04:16:56.580 align:start position:0%
um was not necessarily our choice
 
04:16:58.250 --> 04:16:58.260 align:start position:0%
um and that's a discussion in state
 
04:16:59.630 --> 04:16:59.640 align:start position:0%
government and with people who allocate
 
04:17:01.790 --> 04:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
arpa funding and whatnot
 
04:17:04.429 --> 04:17:04.439 align:start position:0%
um I think that most of those agencies
 
04:17:07.910 --> 04:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
it's a better question for the agency so
 
04:17:09.769 --> 04:17:09.779 align:start position:0%
um I know that at one point commissioner
 
04:17:12.050 --> 04:17:12.060 align:start position:0%
Sheehan before she left at dot because
 
04:17:13.969 --> 04:17:13.979 align:start position:0%
there have been some there that was one
 
04:17:15.290 --> 04:17:15.300 align:start position:0%
of the groups affected by incentive
 
04:17:17.809 --> 04:17:17.819 align:start position:0%
payments particularly winter maintenance
 
04:17:19.969 --> 04:17:19.979 align:start position:0%
um thought that it was
 
04:17:19.979 --> 04:17:20.769 align:start position:0%
um thought that it was
um

04:17:20.769 --> 04:17:20.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:23.269 --> 04:17:23.279 align:start position:0%
stabilizing their decline
 
04:17:25.309 --> 04:17:25.319 align:start position:0%
of employees right which is a thing
 
04:17:27.349 --> 04:17:27.359 align:start position:0%
right did I get more employees was I
 
04:17:29.389 --> 04:17:29.399 align:start position:0%
going to anyway did I do have the same
 
04:17:30.769 --> 04:17:30.779 align:start position:0%
number was I going to lose employees
 
04:17:32.630 --> 04:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
it's what makes the analysis of it hard
 
04:17:34.670 --> 04:17:34.680 align:start position:0%
and I think they would they would argue
 
04:17:36.590 --> 04:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
that that particularly at that point in
 
04:17:38.150 --> 04:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
time when other agencies were offering
 
04:17:40.910 --> 04:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
incentives that they were relatively
 
04:17:43.670 --> 04:17:43.680 align:start position:0%
successful in in keeping it but I don't
 
04:17:44.929 --> 04:17:44.939 align:start position:0%
have data on that and those agencies
 
04:17:46.910 --> 04:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
probably would okay I was just curious
 
04:17:48.710 --> 04:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
if you had a number I know is a real
 
04:17:52.010 --> 04:17:52.020 align:start position:0%
concern of the past year of fiscal uh on
 
04:17:54.769 --> 04:17:54.779 align:start position:0%
burger that so we needed to do something
 
04:17:54.779 --> 04:17:55.849 align:start position:0%
burger that so we needed to do something
and

04:17:55.849 --> 04:17:55.859 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:17:59.689 --> 04:17:59.699 align:start position:0%
hopefully this would help minimize the
 
04:18:03.349 --> 04:18:03.359 align:start position:0%
blow out and keep them in if I'm if I'm
 
04:18:05.689 --> 04:18:05.699 align:start position:0%
honest and I'm seeking for myself here I
 
04:18:07.070 --> 04:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
think the
 
04:18:07.080 --> 04:18:08.689 align:start position:0%
think the
the

04:18:08.689 --> 04:18:08.699 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:18:11.269 --> 04:18:11.279 align:start position:0%
state government has an uh easier time
 
04:18:13.250 --> 04:18:13.260 align:start position:0%
recruiting when when labor markets are
 
04:18:16.189 --> 04:18:16.199 align:start position:0%
loose and when the economy is bad and
 
04:18:17.750 --> 04:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
has a harder time recruiting when the
 
04:18:19.969 --> 04:18:19.979 align:start position:0%
economy is strong and the labor market
 
04:18:21.650 --> 04:18:21.660 align:start position:0%
is really tight that that's been true
 
04:18:24.530 --> 04:18:24.540 align:start position:0%
probably for 30 or 40 years and and I
 
04:18:26.330 --> 04:18:26.340 align:start position:0%
think that's and I I don't want to say
 
04:18:27.590 --> 04:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
to somebody wait for the next recession
 
04:18:29.389 --> 04:18:29.399 align:start position:0%
we won't have a problem hiring yeah I
 
04:18:31.070 --> 04:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
was hoping you weren't suggesting not at
 
04:18:33.349 --> 04:18:33.359 align:start position:0%
all but um
 
04:18:35.030 --> 04:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
um although there's a kernel of Truth
 
04:18:37.070 --> 04:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
and that that silliness right that that
 
04:18:39.410 --> 04:18:39.420 align:start position:0%
there is something about that
 
04:18:43.729 --> 04:18:43.739 align:start position:0%
um over time you know uh
 
04:18:45.650 --> 04:18:45.660 align:start position:0%
you know broadly speaking if you compare
 
04:18:48.830 --> 04:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
CPI and and average wage
 
04:18:50.330 --> 04:18:50.340 align:start position:0%
um you know our our selling point is
 
04:18:52.490 --> 04:18:52.500 align:start position:0%
really but the benefit package but that
 
04:18:53.809 --> 04:18:53.819 align:start position:0%
leave that aside you compare average
 
04:18:56.809 --> 04:18:56.819 align:start position:0%
wage over time we have kept up in recent
 
04:18:58.490 --> 04:18:58.500 align:start position:0%
years particularly because of the the
 
04:19:00.950 --> 04:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
significant inflation
 
04:19:02.389 --> 04:19:02.399 align:start position:0%
um of a kind that most of us don't
 
04:19:04.189 --> 04:19:04.199 align:start position:0%
remember very well
 
04:19:06.469 --> 04:19:06.479 align:start position:0%
um of recent years we've Fallen a bit
 
04:19:08.450 --> 04:19:08.460 align:start position:0%
further behind I think the biggest
 
04:19:13.910 --> 04:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
obstacle is that in some sectors outside
 
04:19:13.920 --> 04:19:15.469 align:start position:0%
obstacle is that in some sectors outside
um

04:19:15.469 --> 04:19:15.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:17.090 --> 04:19:17.100 align:start position:0%
private employers have kept up better
 
04:19:21.229 --> 04:19:21.239 align:start position:0%
with CPI than the state has the the and
 
04:19:22.849 --> 04:19:22.859 align:start position:0%
apparently there's a tentative agreement
 
04:19:24.530 --> 04:19:24.540 align:start position:0%
on a
 
04:19:26.750 --> 04:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
um the wage increase it would be 10 in
 
04:19:28.550 --> 04:19:28.560 align:start position:0%
the first year which is significant it
 
04:19:29.990 --> 04:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't make up for the entirety of the
 
04:19:32.929 --> 04:19:32.939 align:start position:0%
CPI loss but I think what it is is I
 
04:19:34.550 --> 04:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
think that will have a much more
 
04:19:37.670 --> 04:19:37.680 align:start position:0%
dramatic impact because it will it will
 
04:19:40.309 --> 04:19:40.319 align:start position:0%
reduce the the gap between well you know
 
04:19:42.229 --> 04:19:42.239 align:start position:0%
I'd like to start at 120 well we're
 
04:19:44.870 --> 04:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
looking for somebody between 48 and 62.
 
04:19:48.110 --> 04:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
and and you can't compete with that you
 
04:19:50.269 --> 04:19:50.279 align:start position:0%
can compete with you know we're going to
 
04:19:52.130 --> 04:19:52.140 align:start position:0%
pay 70 but there's work-life balance we
 
04:19:53.929 --> 04:19:53.939 align:start position:0%
have terrific benefits it's a great
 
04:19:55.849 --> 04:19:55.859 align:start position:0%
place to work and public service and
 
04:19:57.710 --> 04:19:57.720 align:start position:0%
these kind of things and so I think
 
04:19:59.030 --> 04:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
that's going to have a more dramatic
 
04:20:01.969 --> 04:20:01.979 align:start position:0%
impact than than one-time bonuses I also
 
04:20:04.670 --> 04:20:04.680 align:start position:0%
if I'm honest I worry about
 
04:20:06.650 --> 04:20:06.660 align:start position:0%
I worry about what I I understand the
 
04:20:08.330 --> 04:20:08.340 align:start position:0%
reason for doing a lot of bonuses the
 
04:20:11.570 --> 04:20:11.580 align:start position:0%
last year or two and I and I get them I
 
04:20:13.250 --> 04:20:13.260 align:start position:0%
think on a going forward basis I'm
 
04:20:14.809 --> 04:20:14.819 align:start position:0%
always concerned about disparate
 
04:20:17.210 --> 04:20:17.220 align:start position:0%
treatment of employees because anytime
 
04:20:19.550 --> 04:20:19.560 align:start position:0%
you're you're particularly nice to one
 
04:20:20.990 --> 04:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
group of people
 
04:20:22.729 --> 04:20:22.739 align:start position:0%
there's a you've drawn a line and
 
04:20:24.050 --> 04:20:24.060 align:start position:0%
there's a second group of people that
 
04:20:27.170 --> 04:20:27.180 align:start position:0%
you're less nice to and feel like
 
04:20:30.950 --> 04:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
oh why him what's wrong with me am I not
 
04:20:32.990 --> 04:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
a valuable employee and you the answer
 
04:20:35.030 --> 04:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
can't be yeah no we're just going to
 
04:20:37.010 --> 04:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
take you for granted and I and there's
 
04:20:38.510 --> 04:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
always that danger right where you're
 
04:20:40.550 --> 04:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
you're trying to balance that like I
 
04:20:42.950 --> 04:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
have an I have an issue here but I don't
 
04:20:44.030 --> 04:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
want to
 
04:20:46.130 --> 04:20:46.140 align:start position:0%
you know we couldn't give everyone a ten
 
04:20:47.870 --> 04:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar retention bonus right
 
04:20:49.550 --> 04:20:49.560 align:start position:0%
and so I guess I get that that's why we
 
04:20:51.290 --> 04:20:51.300 align:start position:0%
didn't do it but there are a whole lot
 
04:20:53.090 --> 04:20:53.100 align:start position:0%
of people who are going
 
04:20:55.189 --> 04:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
well which where am I on the which side
 
04:20:57.410 --> 04:20:57.420 align:start position:0%
of the line am I on and why and I think
 
04:20:59.389 --> 04:20:59.399 align:start position:0%
that's always difficult
 
04:21:01.309 --> 04:21:01.319 align:start position:0%
uh representative McGuire I believe has
 
04:21:02.389 --> 04:21:02.399 align:start position:0%
a question
 
04:21:05.090 --> 04:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman to follow up on
 
04:21:07.910 --> 04:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
what um our chairman asked
 
04:21:10.990 --> 04:21:11.000 align:start position:0%
um on the classification system
 
04:21:14.710 --> 04:21:14.720 align:start position:0%
is one of the categories the the
 
04:21:17.570 --> 04:21:17.580 align:start position:0%
hazardousness of the conditions under
 
04:21:20.630 --> 04:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
which the employee is working and
 
04:21:22.250 --> 04:21:22.260 align:start position:0%
therefore something like a corrections
 
04:21:24.950 --> 04:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
officer would be a number five and
 
04:21:27.110 --> 04:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
somebody whose conference room ceiling
 
04:21:29.150 --> 04:21:29.160 align:start position:0%
might fall on them as a number one or
 
04:21:31.429 --> 04:21:31.439 align:start position:0%
something like that does that well I'll
 
04:21:33.349 --> 04:21:33.359 align:start position:0%
start by saying we took down the ceiling
 
04:21:35.090 --> 04:21:35.100 align:start position:0%
files that are falling so we've
 
04:21:37.070 --> 04:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
corrected that I think it's important to
 
04:21:37.080 --> 04:21:38.389 align:start position:0%
corrected that I think it's important to
note

04:21:38.389 --> 04:21:38.399 align:start position:0%
note
 
04:21:41.330 --> 04:21:41.340 align:start position:0%
um and um and they never fell in
 
04:21:42.590 --> 04:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
anyone's head
 
04:21:45.229 --> 04:21:45.239 align:start position:0%
um the uh yes one of the one of the
 
04:21:47.630 --> 04:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
criteria is work environment and so
 
04:21:50.450 --> 04:21:50.460 align:start position:0%
they're um you know that that is a very
 
04:21:53.269 --> 04:21:53.279 align:start position:0%
significant thing and and you know on
 
04:21:54.650 --> 04:21:54.660 align:start position:0%
some level you know people are gonna
 
04:21:56.090 --> 04:21:56.100 align:start position:0%
have to work outside
 
04:21:58.729 --> 04:21:58.739 align:start position:0%
tonight and tomorrow that's a thing and
 
04:22:00.830 --> 04:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
Hazard is it and it has to be absolutely
 
04:22:03.290 --> 04:22:03.300 align:start position:0%
so we will received this particular
 
04:22:07.250 --> 04:22:07.260 align:start position:0%
chart from Corrections and I don't know
 
04:22:10.010 --> 04:22:10.020 align:start position:0%
if Mike can give you a copy or whatever
 
04:22:12.769 --> 04:22:12.779 align:start position:0%
but it shows that the Corrections
 
04:22:16.309 --> 04:22:16.319 align:start position:0%
Officers are the lowest paid of all the
 
04:22:19.670 --> 04:22:19.680 align:start position:0%
groups of officers on this list and so
 
04:22:21.590 --> 04:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
this is what was concerning so I was
 
04:22:24.290 --> 04:22:24.300 align:start position:0%
wondering if your department could could
 
04:22:27.469 --> 04:22:27.479 align:start position:0%
verify that this is a correct chart
 
04:22:29.389 --> 04:22:29.399 align:start position:0%
um and or maybe there's other officers
 
04:22:31.250 --> 04:22:31.260 align:start position:0%
that aren't listed or something to make
 
04:22:34.189 --> 04:22:34.199 align:start position:0%
it look worse who knows but it's
 
04:22:35.570 --> 04:22:35.580 align:start position:0%
something it's certainly something that
 
04:22:37.309 --> 04:22:37.319 align:start position:0%
that we can take back and look at and
 
04:22:39.889 --> 04:22:39.899 align:start position:0%
and if if you have a can I keep this
 
04:22:43.610 --> 04:22:43.620 align:start position:0%
yeah or we can make a copy or either way
 
04:22:45.769 --> 04:22:45.779 align:start position:0%
um and I can take back and look at it I
 
04:22:49.370 --> 04:22:49.380 align:start position:0%
I do know that you know from on a broad
 
04:22:51.530 --> 04:22:51.540 align:start position:0%
um look I know state troopers make more
 
04:22:54.410 --> 04:22:54.420 align:start position:0%
than correction officers and I I uh
 
04:22:55.729 --> 04:22:55.739 align:start position:0%
wouldn't surprise me to find the
 
04:22:58.429 --> 04:22:58.439 align:start position:0%
correction officers are not among the
 
04:23:01.269 --> 04:23:01.279 align:start position:0%
group two positions are not among the
 
04:23:04.010 --> 04:23:04.020 align:start position:0%
top two or three highest paid but I
 
04:23:06.710 --> 04:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
don't know all of the details and um or
 
04:23:09.290 --> 04:23:09.300 align:start position:0%
the analysis that that leads to that so
 
04:23:11.030 --> 04:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
but we can look it up and I can get you
 
04:23:12.950 --> 04:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
some sort of answer about why
 
04:23:15.410 --> 04:23:15.420 align:start position:0%
oh because some numbers inside the
 
04:23:17.990 --> 04:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
classification system push state
 
04:23:20.030 --> 04:23:20.040 align:start position:0%
troopers one way and correction officer
 
04:23:22.130 --> 04:23:22.140 align:start position:0%
the other way is that well that so that
 
04:23:23.809 --> 04:23:23.819 align:start position:0%
could happen at some point I mean if you
 
04:23:26.510 --> 04:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
if you you know uh correction officers
 
04:23:28.729 --> 04:23:28.739 align:start position:0%
and state police are different uh unions
 
04:23:30.769 --> 04:23:30.779 align:start position:0%
and so different bargaining units and
 
04:23:33.410 --> 04:23:33.420 align:start position:0%
some some things could change that I
 
04:23:36.469 --> 04:23:36.479 align:start position:0%
would be surprised if the disparity was
 
04:23:38.689 --> 04:23:38.699 align:start position:0%
over dramatic
 
04:23:41.450 --> 04:23:41.460 align:start position:0%
um given that I think correction officer
 
04:23:43.250 --> 04:23:43.260 align:start position:0%
raises have been significantly higher
 
04:23:43.260 --> 04:23:44.510 align:start position:0%
raises have been significantly higher
than

04:23:44.510 --> 04:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
than
 
04:23:46.309 --> 04:23:46.319 align:start position:0%
um state trooper raises in recent years
 
04:23:48.229 --> 04:23:48.239 align:start position:0%
but we may have started there I don't
 
04:23:50.689 --> 04:23:50.699 align:start position:0%
know but let me uh again again let me
 
04:23:53.330 --> 04:23:53.340 align:start position:0%
look into it and see
 
04:23:55.670 --> 04:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
um kind of where things stand
 
04:23:58.309 --> 04:23:58.319 align:start position:0%
um I just I have no expertise on whether
 
04:24:00.889 --> 04:24:00.899 align:start position:0%
these numbers are good or bad but I mean
 
04:24:02.929 --> 04:24:02.939 align:start position:0%
if I'm honest like Corrections gave them
 
04:24:03.830 --> 04:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
to him
 
04:24:05.570 --> 04:24:05.580 align:start position:0%
pretty sure they got them out of the
 
04:24:07.790 --> 04:24:07.800 align:start position:0%
system somewhere all right let me let me
 
04:24:10.490 --> 04:24:10.500 align:start position:0%
continue on this just slightly sure you
 
04:24:12.650 --> 04:24:12.660 align:start position:0%
may remember years ago you and I talked
 
04:24:12.660 --> 04:24:14.330 align:start position:0%
may remember years ago you and I talked
about

04:24:14.330 --> 04:24:14.340 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:24:17.389 --> 04:24:17.399 align:start position:0%
um supervision right because the one of
 
04:24:18.830 --> 04:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
the categories that creates a
 
04:24:20.389 --> 04:24:20.399 align:start position:0%
classification is whether somebody
 
04:24:23.210 --> 04:24:23.220 align:start position:0%
supervised is a supervisor and we had
 
04:24:25.729 --> 04:24:25.739 align:start position:0%
discovered that something like 60
 
04:24:27.710 --> 04:24:27.720 align:start position:0%
percent of all positions or all
 
04:24:29.990 --> 04:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
employees had a classification of
 
04:24:32.750 --> 04:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
supervisor when most of them had no
 
04:24:34.910 --> 04:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
direct reports at all has anything ever
 
04:24:38.389 --> 04:24:38.399 align:start position:0%
been done about that I don't I I don't
 
04:24:40.250 --> 04:24:40.260 align:start position:0%
think that uh so there are a couple
 
04:24:42.349 --> 04:24:42.359 align:start position:0%
things there there's a there's a broad
 
04:24:45.410 --> 04:24:45.420 align:start position:0%
Legend with some truth in it about oh
 
04:24:46.849 --> 04:24:46.859 align:start position:0%
you know the way you get the way you get
 
04:24:48.530 --> 04:24:48.540 align:start position:0%
more money in the system is to is to
 
04:24:49.910 --> 04:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
become a supervisor and then they bump
 
04:24:52.429 --> 04:24:52.439 align:start position:0%
you a labor grade and it's in and it
 
04:24:54.650 --> 04:24:54.660 align:start position:0%
isn't true and and in in theory that
 
04:24:57.530 --> 04:24:57.540 align:start position:0%
that shouldn't affect uh things your
 
04:25:00.550 --> 04:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
position needn't be supervisory to be
 
04:25:03.769 --> 04:25:03.779 align:start position:0%
more complicated and more demanding
 
04:25:06.349 --> 04:25:06.359 align:start position:0%
and the fact that you supervise someone
 
04:25:08.570 --> 04:25:08.580 align:start position:0%
is not in and of itself
 
04:25:12.349 --> 04:25:12.359 align:start position:0%
a reason to to increase the the number
 
04:25:14.030 --> 04:25:14.040 align:start position:0%
of points what happens is the rating
 
04:25:16.370 --> 04:25:16.380 align:start position:0%
factors are assigned points
 
04:25:19.250 --> 04:25:19.260 align:start position:0%
um and it increases that there I know
 
04:25:21.769 --> 04:25:21.779 align:start position:0%
that there have been times when when uh
 
04:25:22.849 --> 04:25:22.859 align:start position:0%
when that was true when there were
 
04:25:24.469 --> 04:25:24.479 align:start position:0%
positions but I I don't think it is
 
04:25:28.610 --> 04:25:28.620 align:start position:0%
today true to say that 60 of the people
 
04:25:30.710 --> 04:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
um are supervisors in the system I don't
 
04:25:32.510 --> 04:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
I don't know that but that's something I
 
04:25:34.250 --> 04:25:34.260 align:start position:0%
could look up yeah let's let's and I
 
04:25:36.830 --> 04:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
will get back to you
 
04:25:39.410 --> 04:25:39.420 align:start position:0%
um and unrelated questions I would add
 
04:25:40.790 --> 04:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
to that
 
04:25:43.309 --> 04:25:43.319 align:start position:0%
um one of the I think there's an
 
04:25:44.870 --> 04:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
awareness some members of the committee
 
04:25:46.189 --> 04:25:46.199 align:start position:0%
will be more aware of this in some less
 
04:25:49.250 --> 04:25:49.260 align:start position:0%
that we are undergoing
 
04:25:49.260 --> 04:25:50.809 align:start position:0%
that we are undergoing
um

04:25:50.809 --> 04:25:50.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:52.429 --> 04:25:52.439 align:start position:0%
you know the governor's had a lot of
 
04:25:54.050 --> 04:25:54.060 align:start position:0%
first everybody has had a lot of
 
04:25:55.250 --> 04:25:55.260 align:start position:0%
frustration about the classification
 
04:25:57.290 --> 04:25:57.300 align:start position:0%
system and and I said it was designed in
 
04:25:59.450 --> 04:25:59.460 align:start position:0%
1950 and and I don't want to say no
 
04:26:01.309 --> 04:26:01.319 align:start position:0%
changes have been made to it since 1950
 
04:26:01.319 --> 04:26:02.389 align:start position:0%
changes have been made to it since 1950
but

04:26:02.389 --> 04:26:02.399 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:26:05.090 --> 04:26:05.100 align:start position:0%
frankly I read the 1950 handbook and
 
04:26:07.309 --> 04:26:07.319 align:start position:0%
it's remarkably
 
04:26:09.290 --> 04:26:09.300 align:start position:0%
um relevant today like much more so than
 
04:26:11.149 --> 04:26:11.159 align:start position:0%
it should be
 
04:26:13.490 --> 04:26:13.500 align:start position:0%
um we're making significant changes to
 
04:26:15.410 --> 04:26:15.420 align:start position:0%
the to the system
 
04:26:16.910 --> 04:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
um with lots of stakeholder groups
 
04:26:18.410 --> 04:26:18.420 align:start position:0%
including unions including Commissioners
 
04:26:21.170 --> 04:26:21.180 align:start position:0%
including employees and broader groups
 
04:26:24.050 --> 04:26:24.060 align:start position:0%
to try to simplify the system make it
 
04:26:27.229 --> 04:26:27.239 align:start position:0%
easier to understand make the uh rating
 
04:26:30.530 --> 04:26:30.540 align:start position:0%
factors fewer and more flexible and to
 
04:26:33.349 --> 04:26:33.359 align:start position:0%
include for example compensation like
 
04:26:33.359 --> 04:26:34.910 align:start position:0%
include for example compensation like
today

04:26:34.910 --> 04:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
today
 
04:26:36.830 --> 04:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
today the system New Hampshire's
 
04:26:39.050 --> 04:26:39.060 align:start position:0%
classification system many states you
 
04:26:41.689 --> 04:26:41.699 align:start position:0%
may not under any circumstances take the
 
04:26:43.729 --> 04:26:43.739 align:start position:0%
market compensation into account
 
04:26:47.149 --> 04:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
so you evaluate a nurse for example and
 
04:26:48.710 --> 04:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
you say based on job points and
 
04:26:50.269 --> 04:26:50.279 align:start position:0%
complexity this is where they fall in
 
04:26:53.510 --> 04:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
the system and it is it is therefore
 
04:26:56.630 --> 04:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
labor grade 16. and somebody says to you
 
04:26:59.149 --> 04:26:59.159 align:start position:0%
well yeah but you can't hire a nurse at
 
04:27:01.910 --> 04:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
half of that or double that right and so
 
04:27:04.309 --> 04:27:04.319 align:start position:0%
you should and no people don't look into
 
04:27:06.349 --> 04:27:06.359 align:start position:0%
that system is meant to take that into
 
04:27:09.590 --> 04:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
account become some uh more simpler
 
04:27:11.689 --> 04:27:11.699 align:start position:0%
easier to understand for employees and
 
04:27:14.809 --> 04:27:14.819 align:start position:0%
managers alike and to link to nationally
 
04:27:16.189 --> 04:27:16.199 align:start position:0%
Norm standards the federal government
 
04:27:19.189 --> 04:27:19.199 align:start position:0%
has data through um they have data
 
04:27:21.290 --> 04:27:21.300 align:start position:0%
through onet and a classification set of
 
04:27:23.450 --> 04:27:23.460 align:start position:0%
codes through something called sock
 
04:27:25.490 --> 04:27:25.500 align:start position:0%
and the OC and sock stands for
 
04:27:27.769 --> 04:27:27.779 align:start position:0%
classification or occupational codes and
 
04:27:29.929 --> 04:27:29.939 align:start position:0%
I don't know what the S stands for but
 
04:27:31.429 --> 04:27:31.439 align:start position:0%
the idea is to link to nationally known
 
04:27:33.530 --> 04:27:33.540 align:start position:0%
standards and one of the goals of that
 
04:27:36.889 --> 04:27:36.899 align:start position:0%
is to reduce judgment calls
 
04:27:38.450 --> 04:27:38.460 align:start position:0%
and I think that would address some of
 
04:27:41.389 --> 04:27:41.399 align:start position:0%
that as well okay now an unrelated
 
04:27:44.330 --> 04:27:44.340 align:start position:0%
Factor um you said that one of the big
 
04:27:46.450 --> 04:27:46.460 align:start position:0%
things your department does is health
 
04:27:49.250 --> 04:27:49.260 align:start position:0%
insurance right does that include
 
04:27:52.309 --> 04:27:52.319 align:start position:0%
municipalities at all or not no it does
 
04:27:54.649 --> 04:27:54.659 align:start position:0%
not we provide a
 
04:27:56.870 --> 04:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
we provide a health benefit for state
 
04:27:58.910 --> 04:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
employees and a health benefit for State
 
04:28:03.349 --> 04:28:03.359 align:start position:0%
retirees and and it is it's uh I would
 
04:28:05.750 --> 04:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
hasten to say it's uh we're self-insured
 
04:28:07.670 --> 04:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
so we're not buying an insurance policy
 
04:28:09.649 --> 04:28:09.659 align:start position:0%
that's a change that was made roughly 20
 
04:28:13.490 --> 04:28:13.500 align:start position:0%
years ago O2 I think 03 maybe when Craig
 
04:28:14.870 --> 04:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
Benson was governor I don't remember
 
04:28:18.229 --> 04:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
when that was anymore exactly
 
04:28:19.969 --> 04:28:19.979 align:start position:0%
um so one of those years is when that
 
04:28:21.889 --> 04:28:21.899 align:start position:0%
happened and so we administered the
 
04:28:23.149 --> 04:28:23.159 align:start position:0%
program ourselves we have a third party
 
04:28:26.510 --> 04:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
administrator but um the state is the uh
 
04:28:28.670 --> 04:28:28.680 align:start position:0%
State of the State has the risk not to
 
04:28:30.290 --> 04:28:30.300 align:start position:0%
ensure but it's just for state workers
 
04:28:32.689 --> 04:28:32.699 align:start position:0%
not for municipalities too it would be
 
04:28:34.490 --> 04:28:34.500 align:start position:0%
I'm going to throw this out there
 
04:28:35.870 --> 04:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
because I've been discussion in the past
 
04:28:39.110 --> 04:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
about well why don't you do everybody
 
04:28:41.450 --> 04:28:41.460 align:start position:0%
it's not the business we're in and it's
 
04:28:43.550 --> 04:28:43.560 align:start position:0%
not what we're set up to do and it would
 
04:28:45.469 --> 04:28:45.479 align:start position:0%
dramatically change
 
04:28:48.349 --> 04:28:48.359 align:start position:0%
how we operate what it costs and
 
04:28:49.610 --> 04:28:49.620 align:start position:0%
probably what it costs to the state
 
04:28:51.469 --> 04:28:51.479 align:start position:0%
because they're different risk pools and
 
04:28:54.290 --> 04:28:54.300 align:start position:0%
all of that that goes along with that
 
04:28:57.830 --> 04:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:57.840 --> 04:28:59.809 align:start position:0%
 
probably

04:28:59.809 --> 04:28:59.819 align:start position:0%
probably
 
04:29:02.750 --> 04:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
dude I I did testify in opposition to
 
04:29:04.670 --> 04:29:04.680 align:start position:0%
bills but most ly because of the things
 
04:29:07.729 --> 04:29:07.739 align:start position:0%
that Charlie's saying is uh we have 18
 
04:29:09.410 --> 04:29:09.420 align:start position:0%
people to run the state health benefit
 
04:29:11.990 --> 04:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
plan so we are talking about a different
 
04:29:12.000 --> 04:29:13.790 align:start position:0%
plan so we are talking about a different
magnitude

04:29:13.790 --> 04:29:13.800 align:start position:0%
magnitude
 
04:29:17.750 --> 04:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
um and and complexities that I'm sure we
 
04:29:20.389 --> 04:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
could figure out but they are
 
04:29:22.309 --> 04:29:22.319 align:start position:0%
um sort of mind-boggling if you think
 
04:29:25.429 --> 04:29:25.439 align:start position:0%
about it different collective bargaining
 
04:29:27.889 --> 04:29:27.899 align:start position:0%
agreements for the State versus the
 
04:29:29.570 --> 04:29:29.580 align:start position:0%
municipality the next one the next one
 
04:29:32.210 --> 04:29:32.220 align:start position:0%
the next one different contract terms
 
04:29:34.429 --> 04:29:34.439 align:start position:0%
with what well who's providing their
 
04:29:36.469 --> 04:29:36.479 align:start position:0%
coverage today is it fully insured
 
04:29:39.769 --> 04:29:39.779 align:start position:0%
self-insured what's that term so how do
 
04:29:41.210 --> 04:29:41.220 align:start position:0%
you how do you put the puzzle together
 
04:29:43.670 --> 04:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
is really kind of how we've discussed it
 
04:29:46.429 --> 04:29:46.439 align:start position:0%
so just food for thought thank you
 
04:29:48.349 --> 04:29:48.359 align:start position:0%
Cassie was director of risk and benefits
 
04:29:50.090 --> 04:29:50.100 align:start position:0%
until I asked her to be Deputy
 
04:29:52.490 --> 04:29:52.500 align:start position:0%
Commissioner a few years ago
 
04:29:58.010 --> 04:29:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:00.229 --> 04:30:00.239 align:start position:0%
because I think it I think it'd be uh
 
04:30:02.570 --> 04:30:02.580 align:start position:0%
questions are actually much better
 
04:30:04.910 --> 04:30:04.920 align:start position:0%
um for this I'm going to talk about
 
04:30:04.920 --> 04:30:05.689 align:start position:0%
um for this I'm going to talk about
um

04:30:05.689 --> 04:30:05.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:07.849 --> 04:30:07.859 align:start position:0%
well let me let me do slide three why
 
04:30:09.290 --> 04:30:09.300 align:start position:0%
you should care
 
04:30:10.790 --> 04:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
I mean literally I wrote on the slide
 
04:30:12.769 --> 04:30:12.779 align:start position:0%
why should you care
 
04:30:12.779 --> 04:30:13.910 align:start position:0%
why should you care
um

04:30:13.910 --> 04:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:16.189 --> 04:30:16.199 align:start position:0%
every agency in the state relies upon
 
04:30:19.010 --> 04:30:19.020 align:start position:0%
the processes and approvals we do
 
04:30:20.950 --> 04:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
um every agency in the state not some
 
04:30:24.710 --> 04:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
not most but everybody and
 
04:30:24.720 --> 04:30:26.870 align:start position:0%
not most but everybody and
um

04:30:26.870 --> 04:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:29.269 --> 04:30:29.279 align:start position:0%
we no matter how big or how small and we
 
04:30:30.469 --> 04:30:30.479 align:start position:0%
treat everybody the same we don't have
 
04:30:32.149 --> 04:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
one set of rules for HHS and a different
 
04:30:34.309 --> 04:30:34.319 align:start position:0%
set of rules for the board of tax and
 
04:30:36.469 --> 04:30:36.479 align:start position:0%
land appeals or anything like that and
 
04:30:38.510 --> 04:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
it's it is a constant thing that we do
 
04:30:41.450 --> 04:30:41.460 align:start position:0%
and it puts us in touch with with
 
04:30:43.670 --> 04:30:43.680 align:start position:0%
um with every agency and with the
 
04:30:45.889 --> 04:30:45.899 align:start position:0%
operations of every agency and the
 
04:30:48.110 --> 04:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
challenges of the of the broad running
 
04:30:50.210 --> 04:30:50.220 align:start position:0%
of state government
 
04:30:50.220 --> 04:30:51.530 align:start position:0%
of state government
um

04:30:51.530 --> 04:30:51.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:52.969 --> 04:30:52.979 align:start position:0%
and and I wrote here at the state it's
 
04:30:54.889 --> 04:30:54.899 align:start position:0%
policymakers and it's Auditors rely on
 
04:30:56.630 --> 04:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
us to implement and support policies and
 
04:30:58.610 --> 04:30:58.620 align:start position:0%
procedures to ensure the Integrity of
 
04:31:00.410 --> 04:31:00.420 align:start position:0%
the budget the systems the laws and
 
04:31:02.630 --> 04:31:02.640 align:start position:0%
rules of the state that sounds like a
 
04:31:04.550 --> 04:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
mission statementy thing but if you
 
04:31:07.370 --> 04:31:07.380 align:start position:0%
think about it at its most basic it is
 
04:31:08.809 --> 04:31:08.819 align:start position:0%
what we do
 
04:31:08.819 --> 04:31:09.830 align:start position:0%
what we do
um

04:31:09.830 --> 04:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:13.010 --> 04:31:13.020 align:start position:0%
uh people over here and people across
 
04:31:15.050 --> 04:31:15.060 align:start position:0%
the street and including the one corner
 
04:31:15.060 --> 04:31:16.070 align:start position:0%
the street and including the one corner
office

04:31:16.070 --> 04:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
office
 
04:31:18.410 --> 04:31:18.420 align:start position:0%
um constantly have ideas and things that
 
04:31:20.750 --> 04:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
they do and they usually pass in a
 
04:31:23.870 --> 04:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
sheets of paper and and they need them
 
04:31:25.969 --> 04:31:25.979 align:start position:0%
to be done and you need you need them to
 
04:31:27.710 --> 04:31:27.720 align:start position:0%
know that you need to know that there's
 
04:31:29.630 --> 04:31:29.640 align:start position:0%
not some agency going yeah I don't know
 
04:31:31.070 --> 04:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
that was a stupid idea we're not doing
 
04:31:33.290 --> 04:31:33.300 align:start position:0%
that that uh that we're actually doing
 
04:31:35.809 --> 04:31:35.819 align:start position:0%
it it is spelled out actually in our
 
04:31:39.050 --> 04:31:39.060 align:start position:0%
statute that um
 
04:31:40.969 --> 04:31:40.979 align:start position:0%
it describes the role of the
 
04:31:42.950 --> 04:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner as the state's Chief fiscal
 
04:31:45.649 --> 04:31:45.659 align:start position:0%
and policy control officer and control
 
04:31:47.750 --> 04:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
not in an old-fashioned like you know I
 
04:31:52.070 --> 04:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
get a bull whip and a hat but um in in
 
04:31:54.950 --> 04:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
internal audit controls and and we
 
04:31:56.809 --> 04:31:56.819 align:start position:0%
monitor things we audit things and and
 
04:31:59.750 --> 04:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
we make sure that that payments and
 
04:32:01.670 --> 04:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
actions are taken in accordance with law
 
04:32:04.490 --> 04:32:04.500 align:start position:0%
and you know fundamentally we are we are
 
04:32:06.349 --> 04:32:06.359 align:start position:0%
we are a state of laws
 
04:32:08.809 --> 04:32:08.819 align:start position:0%
um not of not of random people making
 
04:32:10.670 --> 04:32:10.680 align:start position:0%
judgment calls and we're the people who
 
04:32:11.630 --> 04:32:11.640 align:start position:0%
do that
 
04:32:13.969 --> 04:32:13.979 align:start position:0%
We Do It
 
04:32:15.349 --> 04:32:15.359 align:start position:0%
um frankly with significant staff
 
04:32:17.330 --> 04:32:17.340 align:start position:0%
reductions if you if you look at budgets
 
04:32:18.950 --> 04:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh over the last 10 years we've gone
 
04:32:22.250 --> 04:32:22.260 align:start position:0%
down 41 positions we have and to give
 
04:32:25.670 --> 04:32:25.680 align:start position:0%
you an idea we have about 305 uh
 
04:32:27.889 --> 04:32:27.899 align:start position:0%
um full-time staff in in the budget and
 
04:32:31.189 --> 04:32:31.199 align:start position:0%
and a couple hundred part-time staff
 
04:32:33.670 --> 04:32:33.680 align:start position:0%
um a lot of them are Karen's Karen has
 
04:32:37.269 --> 04:32:37.279 align:start position:0%
220-ish staff so
 
04:32:40.189 --> 04:32:40.199 align:start position:0%
so right so like our biggest division
 
04:32:42.830 --> 04:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
has 225 staff and I'm like so Karen will
 
04:32:43.790 --> 04:32:43.800 align:start position:0%
be meeting with another division
 
04:32:46.010 --> 04:32:46.020 align:start position:0%
director who's like yeah I've got 23.
 
04:32:47.630 --> 04:32:47.640 align:start position:0%
and it's like she's we have slightly
 
04:32:49.189 --> 04:32:49.199 align:start position:0%
different issues
 
04:32:51.830 --> 04:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
um I want to uh hit one thing on on
 
04:32:53.210 --> 04:32:53.220 align:start position:0%
slide four
 
04:32:54.530 --> 04:32:54.540 align:start position:0%
um and we'll talk about this a lot when
 
04:32:55.790 --> 04:32:55.800 align:start position:0%
we do our budget presentation because
 
04:32:57.170 --> 04:32:57.180 align:start position:0%
there's some changes that that we're
 
04:32:58.370 --> 04:32:58.380 align:start position:0%
making but
 
04:33:01.070 --> 04:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
when I say that um we're we're two
 
04:33:02.870 --> 04:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
agencies retiree health and then
 
04:33:04.789 --> 04:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
everything else everything else being
 
04:33:07.189 --> 04:33:07.199 align:start position:0%
the operating administrative Services
 
04:33:07.199 --> 04:33:08.869 align:start position:0%
the operating administrative Services
Department

04:33:08.869 --> 04:33:08.879 align:start position:0%
Department
 
04:33:10.250 --> 04:33:10.260 align:start position:0%
um you can see that financially that's
 
04:33:13.310 --> 04:33:13.320 align:start position:0%
almost literally true half and half
 
04:33:13.320 --> 04:33:14.631 align:start position:0%
almost literally true half and half
um

04:33:14.631 --> 04:33:14.641 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:16.369 --> 04:33:16.379 align:start position:0%
um we're gonna have a double counting
 
04:33:18.170 --> 04:33:18.180 align:start position:0%
thing called Central facilities expense
 
04:33:20.150 --> 04:33:20.160 align:start position:0%
where we're going to more accurately
 
04:33:21.949 --> 04:33:21.959 align:start position:0%
account for facilities and you'll see
 
04:33:25.490 --> 04:33:25.500 align:start position:0%
that when we do our budget presentation
 
04:33:28.970 --> 04:33:28.980 align:start position:0%
I we have 30 or 40 priorities that we're
 
04:33:31.730 --> 04:33:31.740 align:start position:0%
working on and actually in the process
 
04:33:34.551 --> 04:33:34.561 align:start position:0%
with with all eight divisions and a
 
04:33:37.310 --> 04:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
couple of other offices of doing that
 
04:33:39.949 --> 04:33:39.959 align:start position:0%
strategic planning right now and I have
 
04:33:41.990 --> 04:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
eight uh emails in my inbox from the
 
04:33:43.730 --> 04:33:43.740 align:start position:0%
last two days because they were they're
 
04:33:45.949 --> 04:33:45.959 align:start position:0%
meant to be to me this week
 
04:33:48.170 --> 04:33:48.180 align:start position:0%
um but if you're looking at um page five
 
04:33:50.029 --> 04:33:50.039 align:start position:0%
this is the Where Do We Go From Here
 
04:33:50.039 --> 04:33:50.990 align:start position:0%
this is the Where Do We Go From Here
slide

04:33:50.990 --> 04:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
slide
 
04:33:53.269 --> 04:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
I want to mention a couple of things one
 
04:33:55.189 --> 04:33:55.199 align:start position:0%
is the cloud
 
04:33:59.330 --> 04:33:59.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:01.670 --> 04:34:01.680 align:start position:0%
the state enterprise system the State
 
04:34:04.029 --> 04:34:04.039 align:start position:0%
Management computer management system
 
04:34:07.310 --> 04:34:07.320 align:start position:0%
back in the day we had a we had a series
 
04:34:08.750 --> 04:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
of computer systems a lot of them
 
04:34:10.369 --> 04:34:10.379 align:start position:0%
actually started in the late 70s and
 
04:34:12.650 --> 04:34:12.660 align:start position:0%
early 80s and what we typically did is
 
04:34:14.631 --> 04:34:14.641 align:start position:0%
stop updating them at some point because
 
04:34:17.090 --> 04:34:17.100 align:start position:0%
it's you know keeping them current and
 
04:34:18.769 --> 04:34:18.779 align:start position:0%
so you know we're running you know it's
 
04:34:21.709 --> 04:34:21.719 align:start position:0%
you know 2012 and we're running you know
 
04:34:25.551 --> 04:34:25.561 align:start position:0%
with Windows 79 Word Perfect 5.1 you
 
04:34:27.470 --> 04:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
know whatever and not those but we had a
 
04:34:28.849 --> 04:34:28.859 align:start position:0%
system and we decided instead of
 
04:34:30.349 --> 04:34:30.359 align:start position:0%
upgrading it we're going to home grow it
 
04:34:32.689 --> 04:34:32.699 align:start position:0%
and at some point you run out of paper
 
04:34:35.150 --> 04:34:35.160 align:start position:0%
clips and duct tape and and that
 
04:34:38.029 --> 04:34:38.039 align:start position:0%
happened in in 2008 and and the state
 
04:34:40.131 --> 04:34:40.141 align:start position:0%
moved to a new Erp it's it's run by a
 
04:34:42.349 --> 04:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
company called infor we're at a stage
 
04:34:44.750 --> 04:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
right now where the next major
 
04:34:46.551 --> 04:34:46.561 align:start position:0%
um we do upgrades all the time we made a
 
04:34:48.230 --> 04:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
decision state government policy to
 
04:34:51.289 --> 04:34:51.299 align:start position:0%
upgrade not to not upgrade to keep keep
 
04:34:53.209 --> 04:34:53.219 align:start position:0%
up to date um I'm sure there are cyber
 
04:34:55.730 --> 04:34:55.740 align:start position:0%
security reasons for that too
 
04:34:57.830 --> 04:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
um and we're at an inflection point
 
04:35:00.470 --> 04:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
where the next upgrade is a big one in
 
04:35:02.449 --> 04:35:02.459 align:start position:0%
part storage on the cloud people will
 
04:35:04.609 --> 04:35:04.619 align:start position:0%
talk about the cloud instead of running
 
04:35:07.189 --> 04:35:07.199 align:start position:0%
a bank of servers in a closet in a room
 
04:35:08.810 --> 04:35:08.820 align:start position:0%
in the basement right because it's
 
04:35:08.820 --> 04:35:10.010 align:start position:0%
in the basement right because it's
cooler

04:35:10.010 --> 04:35:10.020 align:start position:0%
cooler
 
04:35:12.590 --> 04:35:12.600 align:start position:0%
um and uh and having like oh we have one
 
04:35:14.990 --> 04:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
back up here you know the state state is
 
04:35:17.269 --> 04:35:17.279 align:start position:0%
kept in in one spot on one side of the
 
04:35:19.369 --> 04:35:19.379 align:start position:0%
river in another spot another another
 
04:35:20.869 --> 04:35:20.879 align:start position:0%
side of the river but you know God
 
04:35:22.670 --> 04:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
forbid all of Concord went down we're
 
04:35:24.410 --> 04:35:24.420 align:start position:0%
just out of luck
 
04:35:26.029 --> 04:35:26.039 align:start position:0%
um and you put it in the cloud and it's
 
04:35:27.470 --> 04:35:27.480 align:start position:0%
where things are and it's probably you
 
04:35:29.269 --> 04:35:29.279 align:start position:0%
know Amazon Cloud is probably where it
 
04:35:32.090 --> 04:35:32.100 align:start position:0%
ends up but it's also a major update to
 
04:35:34.131 --> 04:35:34.141 align:start position:0%
the to the system to the financials of
 
04:35:35.929 --> 04:35:35.939 align:start position:0%
the system to the budget software the
 
04:35:38.209 --> 04:35:38.219 align:start position:0%
the payroll software the purchasing
 
04:35:42.051 --> 04:35:42.061 align:start position:0%
software the accounting software the HR
 
04:35:43.609 --> 04:35:43.619 align:start position:0%
software I'm sure I left something out
 
04:35:45.529 --> 04:35:45.539 align:start position:0%
but everything that we do that runs
 
04:35:47.269 --> 04:35:47.279 align:start position:0%
every process that we have
 
04:35:49.070 --> 04:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
that is a major thing we're actually
 
04:35:51.109 --> 04:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
going to be at fiscal on
 
04:35:53.689 --> 04:35:53.699 align:start position:0%
whichever Friday that is
 
04:35:56.269 --> 04:35:56.279 align:start position:0%
um to um for the first 15 million
 
04:35:58.250 --> 04:35:58.260 align:start position:0%
dollars of funding of a project that's
 
04:36:01.010 --> 04:36:01.020 align:start position:0%
going to cost about 25 million total and
 
04:36:02.510 --> 04:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
it's a significant upgrade that's going
 
04:36:03.529 --> 04:36:03.539 align:start position:0%
to take
 
04:36:05.209 --> 04:36:05.219 align:start position:0%
um well over a year
 
04:36:08.269 --> 04:36:08.279 align:start position:0%
we hope to finish by the end of 2024
 
04:36:08.279 --> 04:36:10.189 align:start position:0%
we hope to finish by the end of 2024
ballpark

04:36:10.189 --> 04:36:10.199 align:start position:0%
ballpark
 
04:36:10.199 --> 04:36:11.689 align:start position:0%
ballpark
um

04:36:11.689 --> 04:36:11.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:13.789 --> 04:36:13.799 align:start position:0%
if all goes well you won't know what
 
04:36:13.799 --> 04:36:14.869 align:start position:0%
if all goes well you won't know what
happened

04:36:14.869 --> 04:36:14.879 align:start position:0%
happened
 
04:36:17.209 --> 04:36:17.219 align:start position:0%
that's our goal right nothing that you
 
04:36:18.349 --> 04:36:18.359 align:start position:0%
just won't even know it happened
 
04:36:20.269 --> 04:36:20.279 align:start position:0%
there'll be a lot of people who do you
 
04:36:22.730 --> 04:36:22.740 align:start position:0%
know AP and AR and things like that
 
04:36:24.650 --> 04:36:24.660 align:start position:0%
who'll be really happy
 
04:36:24.660 --> 04:36:25.390 align:start position:0%
who'll be really happy
um

04:36:25.390 --> 04:36:25.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:27.470 --> 04:36:27.480 align:start position:0%
relatively happy
 
04:36:29.750 --> 04:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
and everyone hates their Erp right but
 
04:36:32.209 --> 04:36:32.219 align:start position:0%
but that's the goal um it's significant
 
04:36:35.029 --> 04:36:35.039 align:start position:0%
it's dramatic and it and it's something
 
04:36:36.650 --> 04:36:36.660 align:start position:0%
where we want to get to a point where
 
04:36:39.470 --> 04:36:39.480 align:start position:0%
there aren't I.T pigs in the python
 
04:36:42.769 --> 04:36:42.779 align:start position:0%
where every every six to 12 years you
 
04:36:45.349 --> 04:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
have a giant pig you have to swallow in
 
04:36:46.910 --> 04:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
terms of budgeting standpoint we're
 
04:36:48.470 --> 04:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
we're trying to
 
04:36:50.150 --> 04:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
um get to where instead of these giant
 
04:36:52.429 --> 04:36:52.439 align:start position:0%
cat-backs periodically as a standard
 
04:36:55.510 --> 04:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
operating aspect and that's what this is
 
04:36:57.650 --> 04:36:57.660 align:start position:0%
procurement standardization is another
 
04:36:59.209 --> 04:36:59.219 align:start position:0%
thing that I hope you won't notice
 
04:36:59.219 --> 04:37:00.051 align:start position:0%
thing that I hope you won't notice
either

04:37:00.051 --> 04:37:00.061 align:start position:0%
either
 
04:37:02.689 --> 04:37:02.699 align:start position:0%
we the state has some
 
04:37:04.250 --> 04:37:04.260 align:start position:0%
we need to get to a point where there's
 
04:37:06.170 --> 04:37:06.180 align:start position:0%
one website you click a button and if
 
04:37:07.849 --> 04:37:07.859 align:start position:0%
you sell teacups you can go and see
 
04:37:09.410 --> 04:37:09.420 align:start position:0%
every teacup contractor every
 
04:37:11.750 --> 04:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity you have to bid the state's
 
04:37:13.970 --> 04:37:13.980 align:start position:0%
business what can I do I sell carpeting
 
04:37:16.250 --> 04:37:16.260 align:start position:0%
who can I sell it to how can I sell it
 
04:37:18.410 --> 04:37:18.420 align:start position:0%
right now there's we have a centralized
 
04:37:19.551 --> 04:37:19.561 align:start position:0%
one but there are a lot of other ones
 
04:37:21.730 --> 04:37:21.740 align:start position:0%
and we're working on standardizing that
 
04:37:25.070 --> 04:37:25.080 align:start position:0%
and and creating a module called
 
04:37:27.170 --> 04:37:27.180 align:start position:0%
strategic sourcing but as part of the
 
04:37:29.330 --> 04:37:29.340 align:start position:0%
Erp that allows us to better track these
 
04:37:31.490 --> 04:37:31.500 align:start position:0%
things and
 
04:37:34.070 --> 04:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
some of this is the governor right the
 
04:37:36.769 --> 04:37:36.779 align:start position:0%
governor like uh some of us the governor
 
04:37:38.390 --> 04:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
some of it's the executive Council some
 
04:37:40.369 --> 04:37:40.379 align:start position:0%
of it's the legislature at some point
 
04:37:43.070 --> 04:37:43.080 align:start position:0%
everybody's come to me and said I I know
 
04:37:46.609 --> 04:37:46.619 align:start position:0%
a guy who sells cups
 
04:37:48.470 --> 04:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
we don't actually buy a lot of teacups I
 
04:37:50.390 --> 04:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
I should come up with a better vacuum
 
04:37:52.849 --> 04:37:52.859 align:start position:0%
cleaners and he wants to sell them to
 
04:37:54.890 --> 04:37:54.900 align:start position:0%
the state where can he look and I don't
 
04:37:57.470 --> 04:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
want to give him 25 places to go and for
 
04:37:59.090 --> 04:37:59.100 align:start position:0%
God's sakes can it be something I can
 
04:38:02.510 --> 04:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
understand and search and the answer to
 
04:38:04.250 --> 04:38:04.260 align:start position:0%
that is well we're getting there but
 
04:38:06.051 --> 04:38:06.061 align:start position:0%
we're getting better and and that's
 
04:38:09.709 --> 04:38:09.719 align:start position:0%
something we're working on and uh the
 
04:38:11.510 --> 04:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
way the way Dennis put it Dennis school
 
04:38:14.150 --> 04:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
he put it to me is I think we're I think
 
04:38:16.789 --> 04:38:16.799 align:start position:0%
our first iteration can be 80 of what we
 
04:38:17.750 --> 04:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
need to do
 
04:38:19.551 --> 04:38:19.561 align:start position:0%
and make an enormous difference almost
 
04:38:22.189 --> 04:38:22.199 align:start position:0%
immediately and so so I think that's a
 
04:38:23.150 --> 04:38:23.160 align:start position:0%
big thing
 
04:38:24.890 --> 04:38:24.900 align:start position:0%
I think about purchasing every day
 
04:38:27.170 --> 04:38:27.180 align:start position:0%
because I'd spend half my life signing
 
04:38:29.990 --> 04:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
documents the other half in meetings but
 
04:38:32.330 --> 04:38:32.340 align:start position:0%
signing documents and and you know
 
04:38:35.750 --> 04:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
septic services and snow plows and snow
 
04:38:38.090 --> 04:38:38.100 align:start position:0%
plow services and teacups and gasoline
 
04:38:40.970 --> 04:38:40.980 align:start position:0%
and pick something and I'm like I have
 
04:38:43.510 --> 04:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
more emails in my inbox about toilets
 
04:38:46.310 --> 04:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
than anyone ever should
 
04:38:47.929 --> 04:38:47.939 align:start position:0%
um and that's but it's something that we
 
04:38:49.970 --> 04:38:49.980 align:start position:0%
do it's something that is very important
 
04:38:51.590 --> 04:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
and that you don't think about but it's
 
04:38:54.051 --> 04:38:54.061 align:start position:0%
the backbone of the state
 
04:38:54.061 --> 04:38:55.990 align:start position:0%
the backbone of the state
um

04:38:55.990 --> 04:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:58.551 --> 04:38:58.561 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire thank you Mr
 
04:39:00.470 --> 04:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
chairman so
 
04:39:02.929 --> 04:39:02.939 align:start position:0%
is there any opportunity on something
 
04:39:06.250 --> 04:39:06.260 align:start position:0%
like that say diesel fuel where
 
04:39:09.289 --> 04:39:09.299 align:start position:0%
cooperation with other states in New
 
04:39:14.390 --> 04:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
England might gain some efficiency
 
04:39:16.250 --> 04:39:16.260 align:start position:0%
we've looked into into that a little bit
 
04:39:18.051 --> 04:39:18.061 align:start position:0%
I'm going to use road salt as an example
 
04:39:20.631 --> 04:39:20.641 align:start position:0%
we bid we did a an actually a reverse
 
04:39:23.330 --> 04:39:23.340 align:start position:0%
auction on road salt uh maybe three
 
04:39:26.750 --> 04:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
years ago right before covet I think and
 
04:39:30.529 --> 04:39:30.539 align:start position:0%
um or the state of emergency and um
 
04:39:32.929 --> 04:39:32.939 align:start position:0%
we bid jointly with them they dropped
 
04:39:34.490 --> 04:39:34.500 align:start position:0%
out halfway through because they'd saved
 
04:39:35.631 --> 04:39:35.641 align:start position:0%
enough money
 
04:39:40.730 --> 04:39:40.740 align:start position:0%
and um and so was it a good deal yeah
 
04:39:42.530 --> 04:39:42.540 align:start position:0%
not bad was really good for Vermont
 
04:39:44.990 --> 04:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
because they hadn't been in a while and
 
04:39:47.448 --> 04:39:47.458 align:start position:0%
so they saved a ton of money
 
04:39:49.550 --> 04:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
um we we got a good deal and we saved a
 
04:39:51.110 --> 04:39:51.120 align:start position:0%
little bit of money and and it was good
 
04:39:53.330 --> 04:39:53.340 align:start position:0%
for us so we try to do that whenever we
 
04:39:56.150 --> 04:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
can and our in our purchasing staff
 
04:39:59.330 --> 04:39:59.340 align:start position:0%
um is routinely in in contact with
 
04:40:00.770 --> 04:40:00.780 align:start position:0%
actually teams has been great because
 
04:40:02.510 --> 04:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
you don't have to have to worry about
 
04:40:03.948 --> 04:40:03.958 align:start position:0%
going to a conference or something so
 
04:40:05.930 --> 04:40:05.940 align:start position:0%
people can do that but you know what are
 
04:40:06.948 --> 04:40:06.958 align:start position:0%
you guys doing what are you bidding
 
04:40:08.930 --> 04:40:08.940 align:start position:0%
there's some national contracts through
 
04:40:11.990 --> 04:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
an organization called naspo the P is
 
04:40:14.208 --> 04:40:14.218 align:start position:0%
for purchasing National Association of
 
04:40:14.218 --> 04:40:15.470 align:start position:0%
for purchasing National Association of
State

04:40:15.470 --> 04:40:15.480 align:start position:0%
State
 
04:40:18.410 --> 04:40:18.420 align:start position:0%
purchasing some things officers
 
04:40:20.810 --> 04:40:20.820 align:start position:0%
um and so we've we've looked at a lot of
 
04:40:20.820 --> 04:40:21.850 align:start position:0%
um and so we've we've looked at a lot of
that

04:40:21.850 --> 04:40:21.860 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:40:24.170 --> 04:40:24.180 align:start position:0%
so sometimes there is sometimes there
 
04:40:26.330 --> 04:40:26.340 align:start position:0%
isn't and so um
 
04:40:28.368 --> 04:40:28.378 align:start position:0%
we'll talk to them the New Hampshire is
 
04:40:30.170 --> 04:40:30.180 align:start position:0%
more aggressive than a lot of states are
 
04:40:32.690 --> 04:40:32.700 align:start position:0%
in how we
 
04:40:32.700 --> 04:40:33.708 align:start position:0%
in how we
um

04:40:33.708 --> 04:40:33.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:35.030 --> 04:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
part of this is the council process
 
04:40:36.650 --> 04:40:36.660 align:start position:0%
right every contract has to go through
 
04:40:40.310 --> 04:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
Council like of over 10 grand and in a
 
04:40:41.630 --> 04:40:41.640 align:start position:0%
lot of States
 
04:40:41.640 --> 04:40:42.530 align:start position:0%
lot of States
um

04:40:42.530 --> 04:40:42.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:45.530 --> 04:40:45.540 align:start position:0%
and I know a guy once who did
 
04:40:49.788 --> 04:40:49.798 align:start position:0%
Hardware in New Jersey and and I'm not
 
04:40:51.470 --> 04:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
going to be overly specific about all of
 
04:40:52.490 --> 04:40:52.500 align:start position:0%
this but
 
04:40:54.708 --> 04:40:54.718 align:start position:0%
he had the and I have some details wrong
 
04:40:57.948 --> 04:40:57.958 align:start position:0%
but I had the contract for 40 years
 
04:40:57.958 --> 04:40:59.208 align:start position:0%
but I had the contract for 40 years
and

04:40:59.208 --> 04:40:59.218 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:41:00.770 --> 04:41:00.780 align:start position:0%
you know there are obligations on you at
 
04:41:02.270 --> 04:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
Christmas to make sure everybody gets
 
04:41:03.708 --> 04:41:03.718 align:start position:0%
what they want
 
04:41:05.690 --> 04:41:05.700 align:start position:0%
and you just make sure that you know you
 
04:41:07.730 --> 04:41:07.740 align:start position:0%
check in periodically with Bob and and
 
04:41:10.550 --> 04:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
and you got to do a good job but Bob
 
04:41:11.690 --> 04:41:11.700 align:start position:0%
likes you he's not going to bid the
 
04:41:13.910 --> 04:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
contract because we want to do the
 
04:41:15.410 --> 04:41:15.420 align:start position:0%
business with Fred
 
04:41:17.570 --> 04:41:17.580 align:start position:0%
we don't do that we rebid
 
04:41:19.970 --> 04:41:19.980 align:start position:0%
and and so there's some of that so some
 
04:41:23.570 --> 04:41:23.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:23.580 --> 04:41:24.170 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:41:24.170 --> 04:41:24.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:26.810 --> 04:41:26.820 align:start position:0%
strategic facility management well we've
 
04:41:28.850 --> 04:41:28.860 align:start position:0%
we've spent a lot of time looking at
 
04:41:28.860 --> 04:41:30.050 align:start position:0%
we've spent a lot of time looking at
facilities

04:41:30.050 --> 04:41:30.060 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
04:41:32.270 --> 04:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
um Karen spends her life looking at
 
04:41:32.280 --> 04:41:33.948 align:start position:0%
um Karen spends her life looking at
facilities

04:41:33.948 --> 04:41:33.958 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
04:41:38.208 --> 04:41:38.218 align:start position:0%
um and uh uh Karen started with ndas as
 
04:41:40.788 --> 04:41:40.798 align:start position:0%
a state energy manager and so it's
 
04:41:42.050 --> 04:41:42.060 align:start position:0%
actually a really good experience for
 
04:41:43.788 --> 04:41:43.798 align:start position:0%
being for managing all of the facilities
 
04:41:45.708 --> 04:41:45.718 align:start position:0%
and figuring them out because you're
 
04:41:47.750 --> 04:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
looking you're looking you know broadly
 
04:41:49.368 --> 04:41:49.378 align:start position:0%
speaking at everything and you have to
 
04:41:51.590 --> 04:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
prioritize and triage and figure out
 
04:41:53.810 --> 04:41:53.820 align:start position:0%
what what we can do
 
04:41:55.368 --> 04:41:55.378 align:start position:0%
um we'll have some discussion in our
 
04:41:57.110 --> 04:41:57.120 align:start position:0%
budget about a change we're making about
 
04:41:59.270 --> 04:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
how we allocate facility costs around
 
04:42:02.448 --> 04:42:02.458 align:start position:0%
the state where you know period in the
 
04:42:04.610 --> 04:42:04.620 align:start position:0%
past we used to sort of try we we took
 
04:42:06.170 --> 04:42:06.180 align:start position:0%
and use General Services we took the
 
04:42:07.610 --> 04:42:07.620 align:start position:0%
highest paid employee and assigned them
 
04:42:09.288 --> 04:42:09.298 align:start position:0%
to the biggest accounting unit
 
04:42:11.208 --> 04:42:11.218 align:start position:0%
and the second highest paid employee and
 
04:42:12.288 --> 04:42:12.298 align:start position:0%
assign them to the second highest
 
04:42:13.490 --> 04:42:13.500 align:start position:0%
accounting unit regardless of where they
 
04:42:16.330 --> 04:42:16.340 align:start position:0%
did their work and it was it was
 
04:42:19.670 --> 04:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
administratively simpler
 
04:42:22.610 --> 04:42:22.620 align:start position:0%
um and it approximated fairness in a
 
04:42:26.570 --> 04:42:26.580 align:start position:0%
very approximative way and so now we're
 
04:42:27.650 --> 04:42:27.660 align:start position:0%
gonna we're gonna track that more
 
04:42:29.208 --> 04:42:29.218 align:start position:0%
efficiently with some things I mean you
 
04:42:31.010 --> 04:42:31.020 align:start position:0%
know a utility bill is obviously
 
04:42:33.110 --> 04:42:33.120 align:start position:0%
assigned to a building and people know
 
04:42:34.910 --> 04:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
that most buildings are one accounting
 
04:42:37.788 --> 04:42:37.798 align:start position:0%
unit and it's how we track how much
 
04:42:40.250 --> 04:42:40.260 align:start position:0%
you know dra is an accounting unit right
 
04:42:41.990 --> 04:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
and in their budget they have a facility
 
04:42:44.510 --> 04:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
charge and that you know on some level
 
04:42:46.250 --> 04:42:46.260 align:start position:0%
that that's how much it costs to collect
 
04:42:46.260 --> 04:42:47.690 align:start position:0%
that that's how much it costs to collect
taxes

04:42:47.690 --> 04:42:47.700 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
04:42:49.970 --> 04:42:49.980 align:start position:0%
the cost of the facility they sit in is
 
04:42:52.368 --> 04:42:52.378 align:start position:0%
part of that cost and then they pay us
 
04:42:54.170 --> 04:42:54.180 align:start position:0%
and it's a it's a it's a double charge
 
04:42:55.850 --> 04:42:55.860 align:start position:0%
in the budget but it's a it's not double
 
04:42:58.850 --> 04:42:58.860 align:start position:0%
spend it just appears in two places
 
04:43:00.230 --> 04:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
um and so we're trying to do that better
 
04:43:01.970 --> 04:43:01.980 align:start position:0%
we're looking at some long-range
 
04:43:04.128 --> 04:43:04.138 align:start position:0%
planning the state in infrastructure I
 
04:43:05.628 --> 04:43:05.638 align:start position:0%
would describe it as aging but I think
 
04:43:07.128 --> 04:43:07.138 align:start position:0%
that would have been accurate 30 years
 
04:43:09.410 --> 04:43:09.420 align:start position:0%
ago and there's a different word to use
 
04:43:12.650 --> 04:43:12.660 align:start position:0%
for now and somebody said to me
 
04:43:14.390 --> 04:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
um six months ago
 
04:43:16.250 --> 04:43:16.260 align:start position:0%
like when do you decide to tear down a
 
04:43:16.260 --> 04:43:17.390 align:start position:0%
like when do you decide to tear down a
building

04:43:17.390 --> 04:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
building
 
04:43:19.610 --> 04:43:19.620 align:start position:0%
we don't because there are a lot of
 
04:43:21.410 --> 04:43:21.420 align:start position:0%
buildings that you would in an ordinary
 
04:43:23.090 --> 04:43:23.100 align:start position:0%
you might tear down but you know we keep
 
04:43:27.170 --> 04:43:27.180 align:start position:0%
using and uh and uh because it's what we
 
04:43:29.150 --> 04:43:29.160 align:start position:0%
have and we use what we have you know we
 
04:43:32.810 --> 04:43:32.820 align:start position:0%
we're driving the the 69 Vega
 
04:43:34.730 --> 04:43:34.740 align:start position:0%
um and just getting a new muffler on it
 
04:43:37.850 --> 04:43:37.860 align:start position:0%
um even if it's starting to burn oil and
 
04:43:39.470 --> 04:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
but we're trying to make some strategic
 
04:43:41.930 --> 04:43:41.940 align:start position:0%
decisions on that and the
 
04:43:43.850 --> 04:43:43.860 align:start position:0%
um this Committee in the past saw fit to
 
04:43:46.070 --> 04:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
establish a maintenance fund where we
 
04:43:48.110 --> 04:43:48.120 align:start position:0%
where we take a small surcharge on the
 
04:43:50.990 --> 04:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
on the charges we we assess agencies I
 
04:43:53.330 --> 04:43:53.340 align:start position:0%
think it's 75 dollars a square foot and
 
04:43:55.010 --> 04:43:55.020 align:start position:0%
there's a cumulative fund that's meant
 
04:43:57.230 --> 04:43:57.240 align:start position:0%
to to hit
 
04:43:59.628 --> 04:43:59.638 align:start position:0%
um items that are not capital
 
04:44:01.430 --> 04:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
they're not so big that it's a you know
 
04:44:04.788 --> 04:44:04.798 align:start position:0%
a 500 000 Capital item and it's not so
 
04:44:06.530 --> 04:44:06.540 align:start position:0%
small that it's regular maintenance you
 
04:44:08.990 --> 04:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
know updating the elevators uh uh fire
 
04:44:10.490 --> 04:44:10.500 align:start position:0%
extinguisher maintenance stuff like that
 
04:44:12.890 --> 04:44:12.900 align:start position:0%
it's somewhere in between and we're
 
04:44:14.570 --> 04:44:14.580 align:start position:0%
trying to use that strategically where
 
04:44:16.250 --> 04:44:16.260 align:start position:0%
we hope to get to over the next two to
 
04:44:19.490 --> 04:44:19.500 align:start position:0%
four years is a sense of
 
04:44:21.948 --> 04:44:21.958 align:start position:0%
the long-term needs of every building on
 
04:44:24.708 --> 04:44:24.718 align:start position:0%
a much more granular level our deferred
 
04:44:26.150 --> 04:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
maintenance list the last time we did it
 
04:44:29.868 --> 04:44:29.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:31.490 --> 04:44:31.500 align:start position:0%
not because that's our deferred
 
04:44:34.070 --> 04:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
maintenance but because we had an arpa
 
04:44:36.050 --> 04:44:36.060 align:start position:0%
request the arpa committee or whatever
 
04:44:38.330 --> 04:44:38.340 align:start position:0%
that was said can you send us a deferred
 
04:44:40.310 --> 04:44:40.320 align:start position:0%
maintenance list and so so Karen had to
 
04:44:42.948 --> 04:44:42.958 align:start position:0%
do it at some point she said to me how
 
04:44:44.510 --> 04:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
much do you want on this
 
04:44:48.288 --> 04:44:48.298 align:start position:0%
like do you want to and I said I said
 
04:44:50.208 --> 04:44:50.218 align:start position:0%
don't go nuts but
 
04:44:52.910 --> 04:44:52.920 align:start position:0%
um I said I want to give them about 250
 
04:44:55.850 --> 04:44:55.860 align:start position:0%
to 300 million dollars so do that don't
 
04:44:58.550 --> 04:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
do a billion because we
 
04:45:00.708 --> 04:45:00.718 align:start position:0%
at some point it's gratuitous right you
 
04:45:01.850 --> 04:45:01.860 align:start position:0%
don't track everything because you're
 
04:45:03.230 --> 04:45:03.240 align:start position:0%
like we're gonna spend a million dollars
 
04:45:04.850 --> 04:45:04.860 align:start position:0%
a year we're not going to have a list of
 
04:45:06.110 --> 04:45:06.120 align:start position:0%
a billion we're gonna make sure we hit
 
04:45:08.510 --> 04:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
the hit the big stuff
 
04:45:09.708 --> 04:45:09.718 align:start position:0%
so we're trying to do that and then
 
04:45:11.150 --> 04:45:11.160 align:start position:0%
trying to manage efficiencies with our
 
04:45:13.070 --> 04:45:13.080 align:start position:0%
Operations Division of personnel is
 
04:45:14.330 --> 04:45:14.340 align:start position:0%
making a lot of changes I mentioned the
 
04:45:16.190 --> 04:45:16.200 align:start position:0%
classification system because I think
 
04:45:18.770 --> 04:45:18.780 align:start position:0%
most agencies would find that a um a
 
04:45:20.270 --> 04:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
choke point that they would like fixed
 
04:45:22.670 --> 04:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
we looked at as always talk about
 
04:45:24.410 --> 04:45:24.420 align:start position:0%
centralizing or decentralizing
 
04:45:24.420 --> 04:45:25.788 align:start position:0%
centralizing or decentralizing
operations

04:45:25.788 --> 04:45:25.798 align:start position:0%
operations
 
04:45:27.590 --> 04:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
we decided to do something different
 
04:45:30.470 --> 04:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
large agencies have large HR staffs
 
04:45:33.590 --> 04:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
small agencies have no HR staff and
 
04:45:35.510 --> 04:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
we've been experimenting with it with
 
04:45:37.730 --> 04:45:37.740 align:start position:0%
what we call an hrsu a human resources
 
04:45:39.590 --> 04:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
Service Unit
 
04:45:41.570 --> 04:45:41.580 align:start position:0%
um oh I'm sorry support we change it to
 
04:45:43.190 --> 04:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
support not service we're supporting
 
04:45:43.200 --> 04:45:44.628 align:start position:0%
support not service we're supporting
people

04:45:44.628 --> 04:45:44.638 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:45:47.628 --> 04:45:47.638 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
04:45:49.128 --> 04:45:49.138 align:start position:0%
because if you you know just because you
 
04:45:51.110 --> 04:45:51.120 align:start position:0%
work at HHS or safety doesn't mean you
 
04:45:53.208 --> 04:45:53.218 align:start position:0%
should have better service than if you
 
04:45:54.890 --> 04:45:54.900 align:start position:0%
happen to work at you know the board of
 
04:45:56.628 --> 04:45:56.638 align:start position:0%
tax and land appeals not to pick on them
 
04:45:58.670 --> 04:45:58.680 align:start position:0%
where they don't have an HR position so
 
04:46:00.890 --> 04:46:00.900 align:start position:0%
it's very different
 
04:46:02.330 --> 04:46:02.340 align:start position:0%
um so that's a model last thing I want
 
04:46:03.650 --> 04:46:03.660 align:start position:0%
to mention is Paid Family and Medical
 
04:46:05.868 --> 04:46:05.878 align:start position:0%
Leave This is a program that was in the
 
04:46:08.330 --> 04:46:08.340 align:start position:0%
budget and it's an example of things I
 
04:46:11.090 --> 04:46:11.100 align:start position:0%
talked before about staff reductions and
 
04:46:13.070 --> 04:46:13.080 align:start position:0%
the Staffing I don't want to say issues
 
04:46:16.190 --> 04:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
that we have but but we have a smaller
 
04:46:19.490 --> 04:46:19.500 align:start position:0%
staff than we did six eight years ago
 
04:46:21.770 --> 04:46:21.780 align:start position:0%
um when a significant priority is placed
 
04:46:24.230 --> 04:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
upon us everyone working on this project
 
04:46:25.868 --> 04:46:25.878 align:start position:0%
stopped doing
 
04:46:28.310 --> 04:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
their other work
 
04:46:30.410 --> 04:46:30.420 align:start position:0%
and and I'm going to use Cassie as an
 
04:46:30.420 --> 04:46:31.368 align:start position:0%
and and I'm going to use Cassie as an
example

04:46:31.368 --> 04:46:31.378 align:start position:0%
example
 
04:46:32.330 --> 04:46:32.340 align:start position:0%
um it's not like she wasn't doing
 
04:46:32.340 --> 04:46:33.530 align:start position:0%
um it's not like she wasn't doing
anything

04:46:33.530 --> 04:46:33.540 align:start position:0%
anything
 
04:46:36.288 --> 04:46:36.298 align:start position:0%
right we had before she started working
 
04:46:38.330 --> 04:46:38.340 align:start position:0%
on pfml I had this conversation with her
 
04:46:40.310 --> 04:46:40.320 align:start position:0%
about about your goal for next year
 
04:46:43.070 --> 04:46:43.080 align:start position:0%
needs to be to average a departure time
 
04:46:46.850 --> 04:46:46.860 align:start position:0%
earlier than seven o'clock at night
 
04:46:49.850 --> 04:46:49.860 align:start position:0%
um not that she was winning that battle
 
04:46:51.770 --> 04:46:51.780 align:start position:0%
um but and then this gets placed upon us
 
04:46:55.190 --> 04:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
and it and it and it it's crushing and
 
04:46:57.650 --> 04:46:57.660 align:start position:0%
not it's not about this program the team
 
04:46:59.868 --> 04:46:59.878 align:start position:0%
that's worked on it has done a really
 
04:47:02.510 --> 04:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
good job and it's multiple agencies and
 
04:47:05.270 --> 04:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
in taking an amorphous blob and turning
 
04:47:08.690 --> 04:47:08.700 align:start position:0%
it into a program but
 
04:47:10.850 --> 04:47:10.860 align:start position:0%
I would ask you that when you think of
 
04:47:13.550 --> 04:47:13.560 align:start position:0%
something that's really good and
 
04:47:16.610 --> 04:47:16.620 align:start position:0%
interesting and that you want to do when
 
04:47:18.650 --> 04:47:18.660 align:start position:0%
you assign it to us because you think
 
04:47:21.050 --> 04:47:21.060 align:start position:0%
that we do a great job and we have the
 
04:47:22.730 --> 04:47:22.740 align:start position:0%
best people in the state working for us
 
04:47:24.890 --> 04:47:24.900 align:start position:0%
which I firmly believe
 
04:47:26.390 --> 04:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
I think all the best people in the state
 
04:47:29.330 --> 04:47:29.340 align:start position:0%
work for admin services or or will soon
 
04:47:29.340 --> 04:47:30.890 align:start position:0%
work for admin services or or will soon
and

04:47:30.890 --> 04:47:30.900 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:47:30.900 --> 04:47:32.390 align:start position:0%
and
um

04:47:32.390 --> 04:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:32.400 --> 04:47:34.610 align:start position:0%
um
right

04:47:34.610 --> 04:47:34.620 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:47:36.948 --> 04:47:36.958 align:start position:0%
um and uh
 
04:47:39.850 --> 04:47:39.860 align:start position:0%
no I was I I tried once
 
04:47:42.230 --> 04:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
but it didn't work
 
04:47:42.240 --> 04:47:44.090 align:start position:0%
but it didn't work
um

04:47:44.090 --> 04:47:44.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:47.448 --> 04:47:47.458 align:start position:0%
um when you do that we're very happy to
 
04:47:50.150 --> 04:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
to you know we're here to serve we are
 
04:47:52.850 --> 04:47:52.860 align:start position:0%
we are administrators who implement the
 
04:47:54.708 --> 04:47:54.718 align:start position:0%
policy choices that policy makers make
 
04:47:58.128 --> 04:47:58.138 align:start position:0%
but I I just want to caution people that
 
04:47:58.138 --> 04:47:59.390 align:start position:0%
but I I just want to caution people that
um

04:47:59.390 --> 04:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:01.670 --> 04:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
the greatest resource that we don't have
 
04:48:03.050 --> 04:48:03.060 align:start position:0%
is time
 
04:48:05.208 --> 04:48:05.218 align:start position:0%
and and I just want everyone to be aware
 
04:48:09.050 --> 04:48:09.060 align:start position:0%
of that and I I spend every day thinking
 
04:48:10.368 --> 04:48:10.378 align:start position:0%
about the
 
04:48:12.708 --> 04:48:12.718 align:start position:0%
time pressures on a lot of people that I
 
04:48:15.590 --> 04:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
have and and how to how to mute them so
 
04:48:17.390 --> 04:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
that they don't eventually burn on a
 
04:48:19.368 --> 04:48:19.378 align:start position:0%
ball of flames and take a
 
04:48:21.708 --> 04:48:21.718 align:start position:0%
a better paying job with worse benefits
 
04:48:23.690 --> 04:48:23.700 align:start position:0%
somewhere else
 
04:48:25.190 --> 04:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
but I I'm happy to talk to you about
 
04:48:26.690 --> 04:48:26.700 align:start position:0%
anything that we do but I want you to
 
04:48:29.030 --> 04:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
think of us as the people the people who
 
04:48:32.570 --> 04:48:32.580 align:start position:0%
can help no matter what the question is
 
04:48:32.580 --> 04:48:34.208 align:start position:0%
can help no matter what the question is
questions

04:48:34.208 --> 04:48:34.218 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:48:37.610 --> 04:48:37.620 align:start position:0%
representative brills
 
04:48:41.208 --> 04:48:41.218 align:start position:0%
uh yes going back to the uh purchasing
 
04:48:43.788 --> 04:48:43.798 align:start position:0%
unit you
 
04:48:46.970 --> 04:48:46.980 align:start position:0%
do you use just everything is it
 
04:48:48.530 --> 04:48:48.540 align:start position:0%
everything based just on the lowest cost
 
04:48:51.170 --> 04:48:51.180 align:start position:0%
or do you also look for Value in the
 
04:48:54.410 --> 04:48:54.420 align:start position:0%
things that you're purchasing it um so
 
04:48:59.208 --> 04:48:59.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:01.850 --> 04:49:01.860 align:start position:0%
we on on so I want to separate out
 
04:49:03.830 --> 04:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
Commodities and services right so on
 
04:49:05.448 --> 04:49:05.458 align:start position:0%
Commodities generally speaking as long
 
04:49:06.890 --> 04:49:06.900 align:start position:0%
as you meet the spec the idea is that we
 
04:49:09.890 --> 04:49:09.900 align:start position:0%
put a spec in and if you meet it lowest
 
04:49:12.590 --> 04:49:12.600 align:start position:0%
price wins I don't on some level I don't
 
04:49:14.150 --> 04:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
get to go I'm pretty sure that you know
 
04:49:16.250 --> 04:49:16.260 align:start position:0%
WB Mason does a better job or whatever
 
04:49:19.368 --> 04:49:19.378 align:start position:0%
and so we do that on we have rfps for
 
04:49:21.350 --> 04:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
for things that are services or Services
 
04:49:23.510 --> 04:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
combined with commodities and there's
 
04:49:25.368 --> 04:49:25.378 align:start position:0%
typically a component where where we can
 
04:49:28.250 --> 04:49:28.260 align:start position:0%
look at things like track record and
 
04:49:28.260 --> 04:49:28.970 align:start position:0%
look at things like track record and
um

04:49:28.970 --> 04:49:28.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:31.250 --> 04:49:31.260 align:start position:0%
um and and and the you know the quality
 
04:49:33.650 --> 04:49:33.660 align:start position:0%
and the ability and what they do
 
04:49:35.990 --> 04:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
typically the financial component on
 
04:49:38.390 --> 04:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
everything is the is the highest I
 
04:49:41.270 --> 04:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
I can't imagine going to the executive
 
04:49:44.628 --> 04:49:44.638 align:start position:0%
Council and defending a bid where the
 
04:49:47.050 --> 04:49:47.060 align:start position:0%
finance portion is less than 50 percent
 
04:49:50.448 --> 04:49:50.458 align:start position:0%
but I'm going to use as an example
 
04:49:50.458 --> 04:49:51.890 align:start position:0%
but I'm going to use as an example
um

04:49:51.890 --> 04:49:51.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:53.990 --> 04:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
the State Health this uh State third
 
04:49:55.490 --> 04:49:55.500 align:start position:0%
party administrator contract on Health
 
04:49:55.500 --> 04:49:57.350 align:start position:0%
party administrator contract on Health
Care

04:49:57.350 --> 04:49:57.360 align:start position:0%
Care
 
04:49:59.150 --> 04:49:59.160 align:start position:0%
um it happens to be that the person that
 
04:50:00.708 --> 04:50:00.718 align:start position:0%
the company has won the last couple bids
 
04:50:04.430 --> 04:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
is lower Anthem and a lot lower but
 
04:50:06.470 --> 04:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
um but there's a actually Cassie why
 
04:50:07.368 --> 04:50:07.378 align:start position:0%
don't you talk a little bit about that
 
04:50:09.350 --> 04:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
because I think it's a good example like
 
04:50:11.810 --> 04:50:11.820 align:start position:0%
it's was it 50 percent
 
04:50:14.208 --> 04:50:14.218 align:start position:0%
um what Charlie's saying is we develop
 
04:50:17.990 --> 04:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
factors to uh evaluate a bid and cost is
 
04:50:20.150 --> 04:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
one of those factors and we typically do
 
04:50:22.970 --> 04:50:22.980 align:start position:0%
it at 50 percent
 
04:50:24.708 --> 04:50:24.718 align:start position:0%
um sometimes a little higher and then
 
04:50:27.590 --> 04:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
it's a we we set up sort of a sliding
 
04:50:29.510 --> 04:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
scale so every percentage you're off
 
04:50:31.788 --> 04:50:31.798 align:start position:0%
from the lowest bid you you lose a
 
04:50:33.890 --> 04:50:33.900 align:start position:0%
certain amount of points and and it
 
04:50:35.570 --> 04:50:35.580 align:start position:0%
tends to escalate
 
04:50:37.788 --> 04:50:37.798 align:start position:0%
um we often ask ourselves the question
 
04:50:39.530 --> 04:50:39.540 align:start position:0%
and we have in the health benefit plan
 
04:50:41.810 --> 04:50:41.820 align:start position:0%
many times because
 
04:50:45.530 --> 04:50:45.540 align:start position:0%
um quality of service is very very
 
04:50:48.530 --> 04:50:48.540 align:start position:0%
important and would we would we ever go
 
04:50:50.570 --> 04:50:50.580 align:start position:0%
to governor and council with a bid where
 
04:50:52.670 --> 04:50:52.680 align:start position:0%
it wasn't the lowest bid because we were
 
04:50:55.550 --> 04:50:55.560 align:start position:0%
concerned about quality and
 
04:50:58.368 --> 04:50:58.378 align:start position:0%
um and we've been lucky quite frankly
 
04:51:01.910 --> 04:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
that we haven't actually had to do that
 
04:51:01.920 --> 04:51:03.050 align:start position:0%
that we haven't actually had to do that
um

04:51:03.050 --> 04:51:03.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:05.208 --> 04:51:05.218 align:start position:0%
I think it's a really important question
 
04:51:07.550 --> 04:51:07.560 align:start position:0%
because sometimes quality of service can
 
04:51:09.890 --> 04:51:09.900 align:start position:0%
be so frustrating we spend so much time
 
04:51:11.868 --> 04:51:11.878 align:start position:0%
trying to correct the performance of a
 
04:51:13.910 --> 04:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
vendor and
 
04:51:16.730 --> 04:51:16.740 align:start position:0%
um and with little satisfaction and we
 
04:51:19.190 --> 04:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
we kind of chuckle in-house because
 
04:51:21.948 --> 04:51:21.958 align:start position:0%
um I I have a Playbook with some vendors
 
04:51:25.368 --> 04:51:25.378 align:start position:0%
and it's um it's 12 reasons I I don't
 
04:51:28.490 --> 04:51:28.500 align:start position:0%
like you okay and it's my agenda I pull
 
04:51:32.510 --> 04:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
it out and I I force them to endure the
 
04:51:34.610 --> 04:51:34.620 align:start position:0%
meeting where we go through what what it
 
04:51:36.410 --> 04:51:36.420 align:start position:0%
is that are our concerns with your
 
04:51:39.708 --> 04:51:39.718 align:start position:0%
performance and and lo and behold three
 
04:51:41.510 --> 04:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
years later I can almost take the same
 
04:51:43.730 --> 04:51:43.740 align:start position:0%
agenda out you know and at some point
 
04:51:48.288 --> 04:51:48.298 align:start position:0%
that gets so frustrating for us as as
 
04:51:50.990 --> 04:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
planned administrators for our members
 
04:51:54.110 --> 04:51:54.120 align:start position:0%
who are the recipients of the service
 
04:51:57.470 --> 04:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
um yet are I I actually think and I
 
04:51:59.448 --> 04:51:59.458 align:start position:0%
think Charlie does too that Cost
 
04:52:02.690 --> 04:52:02.700 align:start position:0%
Containment keeping costs down is one of
 
04:52:05.930 --> 04:52:05.940 align:start position:0%
our biggest responsibilities so I I
 
04:52:07.550 --> 04:52:07.560 align:start position:0%
can't give you a straight answer other
 
04:52:09.590 --> 04:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
than to say it's really really important
 
04:52:13.990 --> 04:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
factor and it's something we do consider
 
04:52:17.150 --> 04:52:17.160 align:start position:0%
one question one exception I'll just add
 
04:52:19.490 --> 04:52:19.500 align:start position:0%
there's a state law for the hiring of
 
04:52:21.948 --> 04:52:21.958 align:start position:0%
Engineers Architects and surveyors and
 
04:52:24.050 --> 04:52:24.060 align:start position:0%
it's I'm going to say it's 21 High 18
 
04:52:25.970 --> 04:52:25.980 align:start position:0%
but I'm probably wrong I'm just
 
04:52:28.490 --> 04:52:28.500 align:start position:0%
somewhere in 21i which establishes a
 
04:52:30.650 --> 04:52:30.660 align:start position:0%
process when you're hiring think of a
 
04:52:32.990 --> 04:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
consultant on a public works project and
 
04:52:34.430 --> 04:52:34.440 align:start position:0%
you're hiring an engineering firm to
 
04:52:36.890 --> 04:52:36.900 align:start position:0%
provide a specific set of services that
 
04:52:39.650 --> 04:52:39.660 align:start position:0%
tends to be qualification based rather
 
04:52:39.660 --> 04:52:40.430 align:start position:0%
tends to be qualification based rather
than

04:52:40.430 --> 04:52:40.440 align:start position:0%
than
 
04:52:44.570 --> 04:52:44.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:46.490 --> 04:52:46.500 align:start position:0%
represent Maguire
 
04:52:49.010 --> 04:52:49.020 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah we're this committee is
 
04:52:49.020 --> 04:52:50.448 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah we're this committee is
struggling

04:52:50.448 --> 04:52:50.458 align:start position:0%
struggling
 
04:52:52.250 --> 04:52:52.260 align:start position:0%
um on something very similar to what you
 
04:52:54.170 --> 04:52:54.180 align:start position:0%
just talked about there's a situation
 
04:52:57.110 --> 04:52:57.120 align:start position:0%
with DOT where we have a choice between
 
04:53:00.890 --> 04:53:00.900 align:start position:0%
the cheapest and the best right and and
 
04:53:03.050 --> 04:53:03.060 align:start position:0%
uh you know there's three quarters of a
 
04:53:05.750 --> 04:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
million dollars involved and you know we
 
04:53:07.368 --> 04:53:07.378 align:start position:0%
may very well go with the best instead
 
04:53:09.170 --> 04:53:09.180 align:start position:0%
of the cheapest on that one all right
 
04:53:10.730 --> 04:53:10.740 align:start position:0%
but let me ask you this
 
04:53:14.208 --> 04:53:14.218 align:start position:0%
um we're work how is the trend the
 
04:53:17.150 --> 04:53:17.160 align:start position:0%
latest Trend to work from home affecting
 
04:53:22.250 --> 04:53:22.260 align:start position:0%
State Personnel is it can we
 
04:53:24.368 --> 04:53:24.378 align:start position:0%
um consolidate some of our office space
 
04:53:26.868 --> 04:53:26.878 align:start position:0%
because there's more people working from
 
04:53:26.878 --> 04:53:28.730 align:start position:0%
because there's more people working from
home

04:53:28.730 --> 04:53:28.740 align:start position:0%
home
 
04:53:28.740 --> 04:53:29.288 align:start position:0%
home
um

04:53:29.288 --> 04:53:29.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:31.550 --> 04:53:31.560 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to start by saying I'm at
 
04:53:33.170 --> 04:53:33.180 align:start position:0%
one end of the spectrum I'm working from
 
04:53:35.570 --> 04:53:35.580 align:start position:0%
home which is that I don't like it and
 
04:53:39.590 --> 04:53:39.600 align:start position:0%
and I know I'm old and Luddite in my
 
04:53:39.600 --> 04:53:41.208 align:start position:0%
and I know I'm old and Luddite in my
Tendencies

04:53:41.208 --> 04:53:41.218 align:start position:0%
Tendencies
 
04:53:41.218 --> 04:53:42.170 align:start position:0%
Tendencies
um

04:53:42.170 --> 04:53:42.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:44.750 --> 04:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
born on me the other day the guy in the
 
04:53:47.090 --> 04:53:47.100 align:start position:0%
elevator with me and uh who who looked
 
04:53:48.708 --> 04:53:48.718 align:start position:0%
like he was about 80 going up to watch
 
04:53:50.448 --> 04:53:50.458 align:start position:0%
the house session
 
04:53:51.830 --> 04:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
um said I've never seen anybody with
 
04:53:54.470 --> 04:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
penny loafers in there since I was a kid
 
04:53:56.090 --> 04:53:56.100 align:start position:0%
and I'm like well they're not nickel
 
04:53:59.690 --> 04:53:59.700 align:start position:0%
loafers and um but the uh so so I have
 
04:54:02.270 --> 04:54:02.280 align:start position:0%
our some archaic thoughts I get that
 
04:54:02.280 --> 04:54:02.990 align:start position:0%
our some archaic thoughts I get that
um

04:54:02.990 --> 04:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:06.770 --> 04:54:06.780 align:start position:0%
so put that in in that most agencies are
 
04:54:08.270 --> 04:54:08.280 align:start position:0%
not having people work from home
 
04:54:10.128 --> 04:54:10.138 align:start position:0%
significant there are some people who
 
04:54:11.530 --> 04:54:11.540 align:start position:0%
work four or five days a week from home
 
04:54:13.970 --> 04:54:13.980 align:start position:0%
and and under the new standard you have
 
04:54:15.830 --> 04:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
to work at least one day every two weeks
 
04:54:19.010 --> 04:54:19.020 align:start position:0%
and and there are there are uh legal
 
04:54:20.930 --> 04:54:20.940 align:start position:0%
reasons for that
 
04:54:23.810 --> 04:54:23.820 align:start position:0%
um one day or two weeks in the office
 
04:54:26.150 --> 04:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
um in our agency we we allow divisions
 
04:54:27.948 --> 04:54:27.958 align:start position:0%
if they've so chosen to work one day a
 
04:54:29.330 --> 04:54:29.340 align:start position:0%
week from home for some people that
 
04:54:30.830 --> 04:54:30.840 align:start position:0%
works and for others for others it
 
04:54:32.270 --> 04:54:32.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't I don't think Karen's team is
 
04:54:34.010 --> 04:54:34.020 align:start position:0%
doing that for example
 
04:54:35.690 --> 04:54:35.700 align:start position:0%
um certainly and certainly not the guys
 
04:54:37.430 --> 04:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
who mow The Lawns
 
04:54:37.440 --> 04:54:38.810 align:start position:0%
who mow The Lawns
um

04:54:38.810 --> 04:54:38.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:42.770 --> 04:54:42.780 align:start position:0%
no but nobody is uh if I'm coming in
 
04:54:45.650 --> 04:54:45.660 align:start position:0%
three days a week I still need a desk
 
04:54:48.110 --> 04:54:48.120 align:start position:0%
if I'm coming in one day a week
 
04:54:50.390 --> 04:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
I still wanna desk I don't know that you
 
04:54:53.330 --> 04:54:53.340 align:start position:0%
need a desk uh my understanding is doit
 
04:54:55.310 --> 04:54:55.320 align:start position:0%
has done significant experiments with
 
04:54:58.190 --> 04:54:58.200 align:start position:0%
hoteling as it's called where which is
 
04:55:00.288 --> 04:55:00.298 align:start position:0%
basically you know we're gonna who's
 
04:55:02.448 --> 04:55:02.458 align:start position:0%
here what day you get you know pick an
 
04:55:04.250 --> 04:55:04.260 align:start position:0%
available desk that that happens to be
 
04:55:06.530 --> 04:55:06.540 align:start position:0%
there and I think they're looking at
 
04:55:08.810 --> 04:55:08.820 align:start position:0%
sort of a three to one ratio
 
04:55:10.970 --> 04:55:10.980 align:start position:0%
so today that's not affecting things I'm
 
04:55:12.470 --> 04:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
hoping it will because we have some
 
04:55:13.910 --> 04:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
space planning issues we're trying to
 
04:55:15.350 --> 04:55:15.360 align:start position:0%
sort through with
 
04:55:17.208 --> 04:55:17.218 align:start position:0%
I'm going to use an example you do any
 
04:55:18.650 --> 04:55:18.660 align:start position:0%
renovation of a building and we're
 
04:55:19.610 --> 04:55:19.620 align:start position:0%
probably going to do some work in the
 
04:55:21.470 --> 04:55:21.480 align:start position:0%
annex fairly shortly
 
04:55:22.788 --> 04:55:22.798 align:start position:0%
um I hope
 
04:55:26.030 --> 04:55:26.040 align:start position:0%
um it becomes impossible you know uh how
 
04:55:28.190 --> 04:55:28.200 align:start position:0%
about we get we fix this room while you
 
04:55:30.110 --> 04:55:30.120 align:start position:0%
move next door it doesn't really work
 
04:55:32.090 --> 04:55:32.100 align:start position:0%
that way got to move lots of people out
 
04:55:33.948 --> 04:55:33.958 align:start position:0%
and around and we don't have a lot of
 
04:55:35.930 --> 04:55:35.940 align:start position:0%
space to do it with in addition to that
 
04:55:38.810 --> 04:55:38.820 align:start position:0%
so much of our space is so substandard
 
04:55:41.150 --> 04:55:41.160 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to overemphasize that
 
04:55:43.910 --> 04:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's not like three quarters of the
 
04:55:46.128 --> 04:55:46.138 align:start position:0%
buildings are about to fall down
 
04:55:47.868 --> 04:55:47.878 align:start position:0%
but I would say more than half the
 
04:55:49.730 --> 04:55:49.740 align:start position:0%
buildings need significant remediation
 
04:55:52.490 --> 04:55:52.500 align:start position:0%
of some kind and so that becomes a space
 
04:55:54.650 --> 04:55:54.660 align:start position:0%
concern but it's not really reducing our
 
04:56:04.788 --> 04:56:04.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:04.798 --> 04:56:07.490 align:start position:0%
 
well

04:56:07.490 --> 04:56:07.500 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:56:09.650 --> 04:56:09.660 align:start position:0%
let me let me take the
 
04:56:12.110 --> 04:56:12.120 align:start position:0%
the skirt off of it
 
04:56:12.120 --> 04:56:13.550 align:start position:0%
the skirt off of it
um

04:56:13.550 --> 04:56:13.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:16.070 --> 04:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
according to the state law
 
04:56:19.610 --> 04:56:19.620 align:start position:0%
in approximately 23 days it's going to
 
04:56:22.970 --> 04:56:22.980 align:start position:0%
be necessary for a place called The John
 
04:56:26.270 --> 04:56:26.280 align:start position:0%
F sonunu Youth Development Center or
 
04:56:29.390 --> 04:56:29.400 align:start position:0%
whatever the actual acronym is
 
04:56:31.788 --> 04:56:31.798 align:start position:0%
to close
 
04:56:31.798 --> 04:56:33.650 align:start position:0%
to close
and

04:56:33.650 --> 04:56:33.660 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:56:36.050 --> 04:56:36.060 align:start position:0%
there is significant legislation pending
 
04:56:38.270 --> 04:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
that mostly in the finance committee I
 
04:56:39.948 --> 04:56:39.958 align:start position:0%
guess right now
 
04:56:39.958 --> 04:56:40.850 align:start position:0%
guess right now
um

04:56:40.850 --> 04:56:40.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:43.490 --> 04:56:43.500 align:start position:0%
one is Senate bill one and another is a
 
04:56:45.470 --> 04:56:45.480 align:start position:0%
bill that's before us
 
04:56:48.948 --> 04:56:48.958 align:start position:0%
and we're faced with the conundrum of
 
04:56:52.310 --> 04:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
having to do something about this
 
04:56:55.190 --> 04:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
um because there are how many kids are
 
04:56:59.090 --> 04:56:59.100 align:start position:0%
there now what 12 some 12 12 kids there
 
04:57:02.448 --> 04:57:02.458 align:start position:0%
and we've visited that facility I
 
04:57:04.368 --> 04:57:04.378 align:start position:0%
visited a few years ago with the
 
04:57:04.378 --> 04:57:05.570 align:start position:0%
visited a few years ago with the
committee

04:57:05.570 --> 04:57:05.580 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:57:08.090 --> 04:57:08.100 align:start position:0%
and obviously something needs to be done
 
04:57:09.708 --> 04:57:09.718 align:start position:0%
the question the question is not what
 
04:57:11.628 --> 04:57:11.638 align:start position:0%
are you going to do but how soon are you
 
04:57:13.368 --> 04:57:13.378 align:start position:0%
going to get rid of it
 
04:57:13.378 --> 04:57:14.090 align:start position:0%
going to get rid of it
um

04:57:14.090 --> 04:57:14.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:57:16.368 --> 04:57:16.378 align:start position:0%
have you had any contact with anybody
 
04:57:19.850 --> 04:57:19.860 align:start position:0%
who's been inquiring about uh what what
 
04:57:21.590 --> 04:57:21.600 align:start position:0%
you what your thoughts might be about
 
04:57:24.470 --> 04:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
which way to go where to go no never
 
04:57:27.230 --> 04:57:27.240 align:start position:0%
mind about where to go I usually people
 
04:57:28.850 --> 04:57:28.860 align:start position:0%
tell me where to go
 
04:57:31.550 --> 04:57:31.560 align:start position:0%
um I spent an hour and a half
 
04:57:34.190 --> 04:57:34.200 align:start position:0%
um this morning across the hall was
 
04:57:36.410 --> 04:57:36.420 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards
 
04:57:38.990 --> 04:57:39.000 align:start position:0%
um I think it's House Bill 49 and um as
 
04:57:41.090 --> 04:57:41.100 align:start position:0%
you know he's very interested in this
 
04:57:42.830 --> 04:57:42.840 align:start position:0%
um we have we have estimates that we've
 
04:57:45.530 --> 04:57:45.540 align:start position:0%
provided to to well house finance at
 
04:57:46.670 --> 04:57:46.680 align:start position:0%
this point
 
04:57:48.170 --> 04:57:48.180 align:start position:0%
um and I and I think the Senate
 
04:57:49.550 --> 04:57:49.560 align:start position:0%
president's office about what we think
 
04:57:51.410 --> 04:57:51.420 align:start position:0%
things would cost
 
04:57:53.810 --> 04:57:53.820 align:start position:0%
um we were close enough to a contract
 
04:57:56.030 --> 04:57:56.040 align:start position:0%
we've selected an engineering firm that
 
04:57:59.150 --> 04:57:59.160 align:start position:0%
we could do a contract anytime to build
 
04:58:02.628 --> 04:58:02.638 align:start position:0%
um a new uh 18 bed facility 12 beds that
 
04:58:05.090 --> 04:58:05.100 align:start position:0%
could Flex up to 18 which is from a
 
04:58:06.590 --> 04:58:06.600 align:start position:0%
construction standpoint an 18 bed
 
04:58:06.600 --> 04:58:07.610 align:start position:0%
construction standpoint an 18 bed
facility

04:58:07.610 --> 04:58:07.620 align:start position:0%
facility
 
04:58:10.550 --> 04:58:10.560 align:start position:0%
of about 25 000 square feet
 
04:58:13.510 --> 04:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
um if we went to contract in in
 
04:58:15.948 --> 04:58:15.958 align:start position:0%
immediately ish
 
04:58:19.430 --> 04:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
um it's about a year of design work so
 
04:58:22.368 --> 04:58:22.378 align:start position:0%
uh you know I think from today to you
 
04:58:24.650 --> 04:58:24.660 align:start position:0%
know uh we could have bidable documents
 
04:58:27.170 --> 04:58:27.180 align:start position:0%
by let's say March or April of next year
 
04:58:31.788 --> 04:58:31.798 align:start position:0%
and then probably not two years but
 
04:58:31.798 --> 04:58:32.930 align:start position:0%
and then probably not two years but
um

04:58:32.930 --> 04:58:32.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:34.850 --> 04:58:34.860 align:start position:0%
a little more than 18 months to build a
 
04:58:37.610 --> 04:58:37.620 align:start position:0%
new facility uh at a cost of something
 
04:58:40.250 --> 04:58:40.260 align:start position:0%
like 21.5 million dollars I know that's
 
04:58:41.570 --> 04:58:41.580 align:start position:0%
not the number that's in one of the
 
04:58:45.650 --> 04:58:45.660 align:start position:0%
bills but um so I've had uh engineers
 
04:58:47.270 --> 04:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
and Architects going over numbers over
 
04:58:49.430 --> 04:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
the last uh last few weeks and so we
 
04:58:51.650 --> 04:58:51.660 align:start position:0%
have good numbers on it we we've been
 
04:58:54.170 --> 04:58:54.180 align:start position:0%
and we've I've spoken directly in the
 
04:58:55.310 --> 04:58:55.320 align:start position:0%
last couple of days along with the
 
04:58:57.590 --> 04:58:57.600 align:start position:0%
director of Public Works to um
 
04:58:59.510 --> 04:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
speaker Senator president
 
04:59:01.788 --> 04:59:01.798 align:start position:0%
um house finance
 
04:59:04.850 --> 04:59:04.860 align:start position:0%
and somebody else but they were in the
 
04:59:07.128 --> 04:59:07.138 align:start position:0%
room with all of those people so we have
 
04:59:09.288 --> 04:59:09.298 align:start position:0%
a sense of what's going on and and what
 
04:59:11.570 --> 04:59:11.580 align:start position:0%
I said is in terms of programming etc
 
04:59:11.580 --> 04:59:12.830 align:start position:0%
I said is in terms of programming etc
etc

04:59:12.830 --> 04:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
etc
 
04:59:15.410 --> 04:59:15.420 align:start position:0%
um you tell us what you want to build
 
04:59:17.330 --> 04:59:17.340 align:start position:0%
um and and we can build it but if you
 
04:59:20.270 --> 04:59:20.280 align:start position:0%
say an 18-bed facility of this sort this
 
04:59:21.770 --> 04:59:21.780 align:start position:0%
is a sort of facility that's built
 
04:59:24.050 --> 04:59:24.060 align:start position:0%
around the country right and we know we
 
04:59:25.970 --> 04:59:25.980 align:start position:0%
have a good sense of what that costs and
 
04:59:28.670 --> 04:59:28.680 align:start position:0%
and call it 21 and a half is a good
 
04:59:28.680 --> 04:59:29.510 align:start position:0%
and call it 21 and a half is a good
number

04:59:29.510 --> 04:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
number
 
04:59:29.520 --> 04:59:31.750 align:start position:0%
number
okay

04:59:31.750 --> 04:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:59:36.230 --> 04:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:38.208 --> 04:59:38.218 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and thank you for
 
04:59:42.230 --> 04:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
coming here uh all of you
 
04:59:45.590 --> 04:59:45.600 align:start position:0%
um so I have just uh I guess
 
04:59:49.610 --> 04:59:49.620 align:start position:0%
several questions as far as process and
 
04:59:52.430 --> 04:59:52.440 align:start position:0%
and financing streams and things of that
 
04:59:55.788 --> 04:59:55.798 align:start position:0%
nature so you have the legislative
 
04:59:59.390 --> 04:59:59.400 align:start position:0%
branch and you have d-e-d-a-s and I come
 
05:00:02.628 --> 05:00:02.638 align:start position:0%
from public works I was there for 10
 
05:00:07.128 --> 05:00:07.138 align:start position:0%
years and so I'm really used to a
 
05:00:09.708 --> 05:00:09.718 align:start position:0%
situation where you have a capital
 
05:00:12.288 --> 05:00:12.298 align:start position:0%
project that comes through that process
 
05:00:14.868 --> 05:00:14.878 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of discussion with Ted
 
05:00:17.030 --> 05:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
copper and and you know we're sort of
 
05:00:19.670 --> 05:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
testing versus different theories and
 
05:00:22.850 --> 05:00:22.860 align:start position:0%
now we have um a situation where we have
 
05:00:24.708 --> 05:00:24.718 align:start position:0%
the sununu center we have the
 
05:00:27.288 --> 05:00:27.298 align:start position:0%
legislative parking garage where it's
 
05:00:31.430 --> 05:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
coming through the finance committee and
 
05:00:32.830 --> 05:00:32.840 align:start position:0%
some of those
 
05:00:36.350 --> 05:00:36.360 align:start position:0%
methodologies that I'm used to from
 
05:00:39.310 --> 05:00:39.320 align:start position:0%
Public Works don't seem to
 
05:00:43.730 --> 05:00:43.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:46.550 --> 05:00:46.560 align:start position:0%
and so in a situation where you have a
 
05:00:51.170 --> 05:00:51.180 align:start position:0%
legislative project a capital project I
 
05:00:54.970 --> 05:00:54.980 align:start position:0%
guess I'm trying to understand the
 
05:00:58.970 --> 05:00:58.980 align:start position:0%
interface between Das and the
 
05:01:01.610 --> 05:01:01.620 align:start position:0%
legislature just in a sort of a generic
 
05:01:01.620 --> 05:01:03.050 align:start position:0%
legislature just in a sort of a generic
way

05:01:03.050 --> 05:01:03.060 align:start position:0%
way
 
05:01:05.448 --> 05:01:05.458 align:start position:0%
as far as process
 
05:01:09.230 --> 05:01:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:12.410 --> 05:01:12.420 align:start position:0%
it's a good question and so I'm gonna
 
05:01:14.510 --> 05:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
you know depends on the project and all
 
05:01:15.708 --> 05:01:15.718 align:start position:0%
that and I'm going to leave aside
 
05:01:18.170 --> 05:01:18.180 align:start position:0%
Capital because you understand that it's
 
05:01:20.270 --> 05:01:20.280 align:start position:0%
a very defined process
 
05:01:22.310 --> 05:01:22.320 align:start position:0%
you picked two
 
05:01:25.310 --> 05:01:25.320 align:start position:0%
projects that are weird right the
 
05:01:26.810 --> 05:01:26.820 align:start position:0%
parking garage is weird and the synonym
 
05:01:29.750 --> 05:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
Center is weird that in the in the
 
05:01:31.788 --> 05:01:31.798 align:start position:0%
ordinary course of events
 
05:01:34.128 --> 05:01:34.138 align:start position:0%
um things of this nature Construction
 
05:01:37.490 --> 05:01:37.500 align:start position:0%
would be part of a capital budget it's a
 
05:01:38.930 --> 05:01:38.940 align:start position:0%
process there's a capital budget
 
05:01:40.730 --> 05:01:40.740 align:start position:0%
overview committee and long or which one
 
05:01:41.930 --> 05:01:41.940 align:start position:0%
are you on your own capital budget
 
05:01:41.940 --> 05:01:42.770 align:start position:0%
are you on your own capital budget
overview

05:01:42.770 --> 05:01:42.780 align:start position:0%
overview
 
05:01:45.110 --> 05:01:45.120 align:start position:0%
oh she's on long range I think Ted's on
 
05:01:47.030 --> 05:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
capital budget overview but so the
 
05:01:48.530 --> 05:01:48.540 align:start position:0%
Committees that look at it and examine
 
05:01:48.540 --> 05:01:50.090 align:start position:0%
Committees that look at it and examine
everything

05:01:50.090 --> 05:01:50.100 align:start position:0%
everything
 
05:01:50.100 --> 05:01:51.288 align:start position:0%
everything
um

05:01:51.288 --> 05:01:51.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:53.868 --> 05:01:53.878 align:start position:0%
periodically the legislature will pass a
 
05:01:56.208 --> 05:01:56.218 align:start position:0%
bill and lately there's a whole arpa
 
05:01:58.128 --> 05:01:58.138 align:start position:0%
thing that's weird too which is similar
 
05:01:59.810 --> 05:01:59.820 align:start position:0%
where it doesn't go through that process
 
05:02:02.208 --> 05:02:02.218 align:start position:0%
but a bill will come somebody has an
 
05:02:04.850 --> 05:02:04.860 align:start position:0%
idea somebody has an appropriation
 
05:02:07.010 --> 05:02:07.020 align:start position:0%
in the capital budget there are a series
 
05:02:09.890 --> 05:02:09.900 align:start position:0%
of steps to get to a number that's an
 
05:02:11.690 --> 05:02:11.700 align:start position:0%
estimate based on decisions that have
 
05:02:13.970 --> 05:02:13.980 align:start position:0%
been made and people have reviewed
 
05:02:16.670 --> 05:02:16.680 align:start position:0%
often with legislation
 
05:02:19.510 --> 05:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
um there's some fog of war that goes on
 
05:02:21.770 --> 05:02:21.780 align:start position:0%
where different people are talking about
 
05:02:23.990 --> 05:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
different things and there's a little
 
05:02:26.030 --> 05:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
bit of a well I think somebody told me
 
05:02:28.490 --> 05:02:28.500 align:start position:0%
that it would only cost 15 million to
 
05:02:30.230 --> 05:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
build a and that's what I heard well
 
05:02:31.730 --> 05:02:31.740 align:start position:0%
does that include does that include the
 
05:02:33.410 --> 05:02:33.420 align:start position:0%
engineering well I thought so maybe it
 
05:02:35.570 --> 05:02:35.580 align:start position:0%
doesn't and there's no sense of what the
 
05:02:36.830 --> 05:02:36.840 align:start position:0%
all-in cost is and then a piece of
 
05:02:38.868 --> 05:02:38.878 align:start position:0%
legislation gets passed and then there's
 
05:02:41.810 --> 05:02:41.820 align:start position:0%
this rumor out there that becomes well I
 
05:02:43.550 --> 05:02:43.560 align:start position:0%
thought that's what it was going to cost
 
05:02:46.128 --> 05:02:46.138 align:start position:0%
and and and you know I know I think
 
05:02:47.690 --> 05:02:47.700 align:start position:0%
Tuesday we'll talk about this a little
 
05:02:50.030 --> 05:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
bit with the parking garage and
 
05:02:50.040 --> 05:02:51.170 align:start position:0%
bit with the parking garage and
um

05:02:51.170 --> 05:02:51.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:52.788 --> 05:02:52.798 align:start position:0%
you know how many spaces is the parking
 
05:02:55.550 --> 05:02:55.560 align:start position:0%
garage and it's like well I heard and
 
05:02:59.030 --> 05:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
then it was you know 600 or 412 or 396
 
05:03:02.628 --> 05:03:02.638 align:start position:0%
or 1004 and um and I know which one of
 
05:03:04.310 --> 05:03:04.320 align:start position:0%
those my staff hopes because we would
 
05:03:05.930 --> 05:03:05.940 align:start position:0%
like a few spaces and we're not going to
 
05:03:09.350 --> 05:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
get any but um but there's all of that
 
05:03:12.708 --> 05:03:12.718 align:start position:0%
and so what I try to do
 
05:03:17.030 --> 05:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
so I said to division three this morning
 
05:03:19.490 --> 05:03:19.500 align:start position:0%
I said I I can't tell you whether you
 
05:03:21.050 --> 05:03:21.060 align:start position:0%
should move the Center Minnesota or not
 
05:03:22.490 --> 05:03:22.500 align:start position:0%
I can't tell you what you should do but
 
05:03:24.830 --> 05:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
what I can tell you is that if you want
 
05:03:26.930 --> 05:03:26.940 align:start position:0%
to build a building that's 12 beds that
 
05:03:28.670 --> 05:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
can Flex to 18.
 
05:03:31.010 --> 05:03:31.020 align:start position:0%
which is a 25 000 square foot facility
 
05:03:33.350 --> 05:03:33.360 align:start position:0%
of this nature according to modern
 
05:03:35.930 --> 05:03:35.940 align:start position:0%
techniques this is how much it will cost
 
05:03:38.448 --> 05:03:38.458 align:start position:0%
this is our estimate this is what Ted
 
05:03:40.250 --> 05:03:40.260 align:start position:0%
and Tim have come up with and we feel
 
05:03:41.868 --> 05:03:41.878 align:start position:0%
confident in that number and in this
 
05:03:41.878 --> 05:03:43.250 align:start position:0%
confident in that number and in this
timeline

05:03:43.250 --> 05:03:43.260 align:start position:0%
timeline
 
05:03:45.230 --> 05:03:45.240 align:start position:0%
at that point
 
05:03:47.690 --> 05:03:47.700 align:start position:0%
if somebody says well what if it's six
 
05:03:49.610 --> 05:03:49.620 align:start position:0%
it's not going to cost that much not the
 
05:03:49.620 --> 05:03:50.930 align:start position:0%
it's not going to cost that much not the
question

05:03:50.930 --> 05:03:50.940 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:03:53.390 --> 05:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
if you want to know what 12-18 this is
 
05:03:54.650 --> 05:03:54.660 align:start position:0%
the question you want six I'll come back
 
05:03:56.628 --> 05:03:56.638 align:start position:0%
and answer that and so what happens
 
05:03:58.430 --> 05:03:58.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes with
 
05:04:00.590 --> 05:04:00.600 align:start position:0%
I mean I I have to think that that one
 
05:04:01.970 --> 05:04:01.980 align:start position:0%
point the reason I created a capital
 
05:04:04.730 --> 05:04:04.740 align:start position:0%
budget was to take things of this nature
 
05:04:06.650 --> 05:04:06.660 align:start position:0%
where there's a there's a big estimate
 
05:04:08.930 --> 05:04:08.940 align:start position:0%
right that has to go along with it
 
05:04:11.930 --> 05:04:11.940 align:start position:0%
and say we want a different level of
 
05:04:14.510 --> 05:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
scrutiny on it when you think about the
 
05:04:15.708 --> 05:04:15.718 align:start position:0%
difference between what house Public
 
05:04:17.350 --> 05:04:17.360 align:start position:0%
Works does and what house finance does
 
05:04:20.270 --> 05:04:20.280 align:start position:0%
and and the
 
05:04:22.550 --> 05:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
you know just the nature of the kind of
 
05:04:24.170 --> 05:04:24.180 align:start position:0%
Investigation they do
 
05:04:26.510 --> 05:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
in each case more thorough than what the
 
05:04:28.128 --> 05:04:28.138 align:start position:0%
other one does but in different ways
 
05:04:31.850 --> 05:04:31.860 align:start position:0%
right and so when some things are one
 
05:04:33.890 --> 05:04:33.900 align:start position:0%
off in a piece of legislation it's
 
05:04:35.628 --> 05:04:35.638 align:start position:0%
occasionally odd
 
05:04:38.930 --> 05:04:38.940 align:start position:0%
but um our hope is that through enough
 
05:04:41.868 --> 05:04:41.878 align:start position:0%
questioning and back and forth
 
05:04:43.788 --> 05:04:43.798 align:start position:0%
um you know we try to make clear the
 
05:04:45.650 --> 05:04:45.660 align:start position:0%
question that we're answering when we
 
05:04:48.590 --> 05:04:48.600 align:start position:0%
give a number and sometimes that's not
 
05:04:48.600 --> 05:04:50.510 align:start position:0%
give a number and sometimes that's not
relayed

05:04:50.510 --> 05:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
relayed
 
05:04:52.368 --> 05:04:52.378 align:start position:0%
you know the telephone game right and
 
05:04:54.530 --> 05:04:54.540 align:start position:0%
well you know I tell you you tell him he
 
05:04:56.570 --> 05:04:56.580 align:start position:0%
tells him and and pretty soon someone
 
05:04:58.970 --> 05:04:58.980 align:start position:0%
said well I heard it's about 30 million
 
05:05:01.010 --> 05:05:01.020 align:start position:0%
for four beds or two and a half million
 
05:05:03.050 --> 05:05:03.060 align:start position:0%
a bit and you're like wait I don't think
 
05:05:04.490 --> 05:05:04.500 align:start position:0%
we said that did we
 
05:05:06.170 --> 05:05:06.180 align:start position:0%
and so
 
05:05:07.850 --> 05:05:07.860 align:start position:0%
I don't have a good solution to that by
 
05:05:10.390 --> 05:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:13.670 --> 05:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
so just talking then about
 
05:05:13.680 --> 05:05:16.070 align:start position:0%
so just talking then about
um

05:05:16.070 --> 05:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:19.250 --> 05:05:19.260 align:start position:0%
legislative process project
 
05:05:19.260 --> 05:05:21.350 align:start position:0%
legislative process project
the

05:05:21.350 --> 05:05:21.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:05:25.310 --> 05:05:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:28.490 --> 05:05:28.500 align:start position:0%
the state how it gets very confusing for
 
05:05:30.410 --> 05:05:30.420 align:start position:0%
us as we're trying to administer all
 
05:05:33.170 --> 05:05:33.180 align:start position:0%
these things understanding who owns what
 
05:05:35.628 --> 05:05:35.638 align:start position:0%
building and who's responsible for what
 
05:05:40.310 --> 05:05:40.320 align:start position:0%
so like you guys own and operate the
 
05:05:41.750 --> 05:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
State House
 
05:05:45.708 --> 05:05:45.718 align:start position:0%
right the Legislative Office Building is
 
05:05:48.670 --> 05:05:48.680 align:start position:0%
owned and operated by the Legislative
 
05:05:53.270 --> 05:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
no so how does that work you you own
 
05:05:53.280 --> 05:05:55.788 align:start position:0%
no so how does that work you you own
everything

05:05:55.788 --> 05:05:55.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:57.530 --> 05:05:57.540 align:start position:0%
um State owns everything I want to say
 
05:06:00.170 --> 05:06:00.180 align:start position:0%
that up front and and from literally
 
05:06:01.670 --> 05:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
from an accounting standpoint at one
 
05:06:02.990 --> 05:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
point it was a
 
05:06:05.570 --> 05:06:05.580 align:start position:0%
building being transferred from the
 
05:06:07.310 --> 05:06:07.320 align:start position:0%
owned by
 
05:06:09.948 --> 05:06:09.958 align:start position:0%
safety to the whatever it was and the
 
05:06:11.628 --> 05:06:11.638 align:start position:0%
Comptroller is like doesn't matter we're
 
05:06:13.910 --> 05:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
not booking an entry State still owns it
 
05:06:15.830 --> 05:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
different agency controls it so there's
 
05:06:19.128 --> 05:06:19.138 align:start position:0%
that typically I'll give an example up
 
05:06:20.868 --> 05:06:20.878 align:start position:0%
on Walker when it was donated to the
 
05:06:22.850 --> 05:06:22.860 align:start position:0%
state by
 
05:06:25.070 --> 05:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
Upham or Walker I don't know which one
 
05:06:27.288 --> 05:06:27.298 align:start position:0%
but one but but literally one of them I
 
05:06:29.750 --> 05:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
know that much was accepted by the
 
05:06:31.070 --> 05:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
department of administrative services
 
05:06:34.970 --> 05:06:34.980 align:start position:0%
and that's who it was donated to
 
05:06:38.448 --> 05:06:38.458 align:start position:0%
uh nobody lets us have any say we we fix
 
05:06:39.948 --> 05:06:39.958 align:start position:0%
the boiler we do all of that kind of
 
05:06:42.948 --> 05:06:42.958 align:start position:0%
stuff but um we can't book it right
 
05:06:46.010 --> 05:06:46.020 align:start position:0%
that's you got to call Terry and um and
 
05:06:48.910 --> 05:06:48.920 align:start position:0%
that's sort of how that works the
 
05:06:52.910 --> 05:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
in almost every building
 
05:06:56.270 --> 05:06:56.280 align:start position:0%
we own the building and dra is a tenant
 
05:06:58.610 --> 05:06:58.620 align:start position:0%
of the building it's not really how we
 
05:07:00.890 --> 05:07:00.900 align:start position:0%
approach it and with the legislature
 
05:07:02.570 --> 05:07:02.580 align:start position:0%
it's much more so because
 
05:07:02.580 --> 05:07:03.350 align:start position:0%
it's much more so because
um

05:07:03.350 --> 05:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:07:05.570 --> 05:07:05.580 align:start position:0%
because you're more intimidating
 
05:07:08.330 --> 05:07:08.340 align:start position:0%
and at some point your your people can
 
05:07:10.670 --> 05:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
go you know this is this is the way it's
 
05:07:13.730 --> 05:07:13.740 align:start position:0%
going to be and it it isn't it's a we
 
05:07:15.470 --> 05:07:15.480 align:start position:0%
have a very collaborative relationship
 
05:07:18.170 --> 05:07:18.180 align:start position:0%
and Karen's staff and the and and the
 
05:07:20.448 --> 05:07:20.458 align:start position:0%
people who who have offices over here
 
05:07:22.910 --> 05:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
who do some maintenance things
 
05:07:25.610 --> 05:07:25.620 align:start position:0%
um work very well together but um let's
 
05:07:26.750 --> 05:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
just say it's not a partnership of
 
05:07:28.788 --> 05:07:28.798 align:start position:0%
equals and the way it is with a with a
 
05:07:30.890 --> 05:07:30.900 align:start position:0%
department but you want to talk a little
 
05:07:33.948 --> 05:07:33.958 align:start position:0%
bit about about how we
 
05:07:36.350 --> 05:07:36.360 align:start position:0%
how we manage a building in cooperation
 
05:07:42.890 --> 05:07:42.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:45.890 --> 05:07:45.900 align:start position:0%
the way that our costs are budgeted and
 
05:07:48.730 --> 05:07:48.740 align:start position:0%
that the agency that occupies that space
 
05:07:51.050 --> 05:07:51.060 align:start position:0%
reimburses us for the cost that we spend
 
05:07:52.550 --> 05:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
on a building so if it's a utility bill
 
05:07:55.190 --> 05:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
we pay the electric bill and then each
 
05:07:56.810 --> 05:07:56.820 align:start position:0%
quarter we we tell them what the
 
05:07:59.510 --> 05:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
expenses were and they pay that back
 
05:08:01.910 --> 05:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
um so and that's the way it happens in
 
05:08:03.650 --> 05:08:03.660 align:start position:0%
most facilities other than some I think
 
05:08:05.750 --> 05:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
like this one is generally funded and so
 
05:08:07.850 --> 05:08:07.860 align:start position:0%
we have a bucket of money that we have
 
05:08:09.470 --> 05:08:09.480 align:start position:0%
to to provide maintenance and care for
 
05:08:12.170 --> 05:08:12.180 align:start position:0%
that building we do everything
 
05:08:14.330 --> 05:08:14.340 align:start position:0%
um in collaboration with the folks that
 
05:08:16.850 --> 05:08:16.860 align:start position:0%
occupy and use the building so certainly
 
05:08:17.990 --> 05:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to pay the electric bill
 
05:08:20.448 --> 05:08:20.458 align:start position:0%
every month but if it comes to like oh
 
05:08:22.730 --> 05:08:22.740 align:start position:0%
well we really need carpet in these four
 
05:08:24.350 --> 05:08:24.360 align:start position:0%
areas we'll work with you to say all
 
05:08:26.510 --> 05:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
right well we can do this much this year
 
05:08:27.830 --> 05:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
and we can do the rest next year what's
 
05:08:29.270 --> 05:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
your priority what would you like to do
 
05:08:31.430 --> 05:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
first and so that's kind of how we
 
05:08:33.110 --> 05:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
approach things so they're they're like
 
05:08:34.490 --> 05:08:34.500 align:start position:0%
Charlie said they're the states building
 
05:08:36.708 --> 05:08:36.718 align:start position:0%
so we were there to get the work done
 
05:08:39.110 --> 05:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
we're there to advise if we think you
 
05:08:40.368 --> 05:08:40.378 align:start position:0%
know this might be a better idea than
 
05:08:41.930 --> 05:08:41.940 align:start position:0%
that but in the end at the end of the
 
05:08:43.368 --> 05:08:43.378 align:start position:0%
day we want to work with the people that
 
05:08:47.628 --> 05:08:47.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:51.788 --> 05:08:51.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:53.990 --> 05:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
in all the rest of the buildings in
 
05:08:55.850 --> 05:08:55.860 align:start position:0%
state government there is a there's a
 
05:08:57.708 --> 05:08:57.718 align:start position:0%
there's a budgeted charge right the bill
 
05:09:00.410 --> 05:09:00.420 align:start position:0%
collecting Karen talked about
 
05:09:03.830 --> 05:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
there are two except three exceptions to
 
05:09:03.840 --> 05:09:04.550 align:start position:0%
there are two except three exceptions to
that

05:09:04.550 --> 05:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:09:06.350 --> 05:09:06.360 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State for the space
 
05:09:08.510 --> 05:09:08.520 align:start position:0%
they have in the state house but not the
 
05:09:09.910 --> 05:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
space they have in the annex
 
05:09:11.930 --> 05:09:11.940 align:start position:0%
corporations and securities receive
 
05:09:14.628 --> 05:09:14.638 align:start position:0%
bills the governor's office we don't
 
05:09:16.570 --> 05:09:16.580 align:start position:0%
send a bill to
 
05:09:27.650 --> 05:09:27.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:29.810 --> 05:09:29.820 align:start position:0%
knows where there's the capital budget
 
05:09:33.410 --> 05:09:33.420 align:start position:0%
overview committee that's sort of set up
 
05:09:36.590 --> 05:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
for capital projects that come through
 
05:09:40.310 --> 05:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
the capital budget process but just
 
05:09:42.170 --> 05:09:42.180 align:start position:0%
because something doesn't come through
 
05:09:44.750 --> 05:09:44.760 align:start position:0%
the capital budget process it doesn't
 
05:09:47.448 --> 05:09:47.458 align:start position:0%
mean it's not a capital
 
05:09:53.390 --> 05:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
project right so if you have a capital
 
05:09:56.090 --> 05:09:56.100 align:start position:0%
project that the state undertakes that's
 
05:09:58.690 --> 05:09:58.700 align:start position:0%
not part of the capital budget process
 
05:10:04.368 --> 05:10:04.378 align:start position:0%
what is the ongoing oversight that that
 
05:10:07.788 --> 05:10:07.798 align:start position:0%
project gets that it would otherwise
 
05:10:12.288 --> 05:10:12.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:15.350 --> 05:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
if you understand what I'm saying yeah
 
05:10:17.090 --> 05:10:17.100 align:start position:0%
um things are done regularly have an
 
05:10:18.590 --> 05:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
oversight process and things that are
 
05:10:23.448 --> 05:10:23.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:23.458 --> 05:10:24.050 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:10:24.050 --> 05:10:24.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:26.330 --> 05:10:26.340 align:start position:0%
I could put a period there
 
05:10:31.128 --> 05:10:31.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:34.128 --> 05:10:34.138 align:start position:0%
we like to think that for example the
 
05:10:35.868 --> 05:10:35.878 align:start position:0%
parking garage is going to be a project
 
05:10:35.878 --> 05:10:37.970 align:start position:0%
parking garage is going to be a project
where

05:10:37.970 --> 05:10:37.980 align:start position:0%
where
 
05:10:40.788 --> 05:10:40.798 align:start position:0%
Public Works will be involved and and
 
05:10:43.010 --> 05:10:43.020 align:start position:0%
you know part of the the rsas in 21
 
05:10:46.788 --> 05:10:46.798 align:start position:0%
either in the uh upper 70s and low 80s
 
05:10:48.770 --> 05:10:48.780 align:start position:0%
involved capital projects and some of
 
05:10:49.970 --> 05:10:49.980 align:start position:0%
the right rules and regulations around
 
05:10:51.830 --> 05:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
them and are the roles we perform and
 
05:10:54.050 --> 05:10:54.060 align:start position:0%
the oversight and meeting building codes
 
05:10:57.410 --> 05:10:57.420 align:start position:0%
and um and energy codes and a renewable
 
05:10:59.150 --> 05:10:59.160 align:start position:0%
energy component and all those sorts of
 
05:10:59.160 --> 05:11:00.190 align:start position:0%
energy component and all those sorts of
things

05:11:00.190 --> 05:11:00.200 align:start position:0%
things
 
05:11:03.288 --> 05:11:03.298 align:start position:0%
and so because of that there's that
 
05:11:04.850 --> 05:11:04.860 align:start position:0%
oversight that legal oversight that
 
05:11:07.490 --> 05:11:07.500 align:start position:0%
they're required to provide
 
05:11:07.500 --> 05:11:08.090 align:start position:0%
they're required to provide
um

05:11:08.090 --> 05:11:08.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:11.330 --> 05:11:11.340 align:start position:0%
because we're currently considered the
 
05:11:13.850 --> 05:11:13.860 align:start position:0%
using agency administrative Services we
 
05:11:15.230 --> 05:11:15.240 align:start position:0%
would do the normal things that we do
 
05:11:17.150 --> 05:11:17.160 align:start position:0%
where we have our staff and Karen people
 
05:11:18.770 --> 05:11:18.780 align:start position:0%
working for Karen who are looking and
 
05:11:19.788 --> 05:11:19.798 align:start position:0%
they're going what are we doing what are
 
05:11:23.150 --> 05:11:23.160 align:start position:0%
we considering and and the the the check
 
05:11:25.070 --> 05:11:25.080 align:start position:0%
on us is that if we're going to have to
 
05:11:27.470 --> 05:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
manage it long term we care a lot about
 
05:11:29.868 --> 05:11:29.878 align:start position:0%
how it's built and and there's a concern
 
05:11:32.270 --> 05:11:32.280 align:start position:0%
there with how it's built
 
05:11:35.150 --> 05:11:35.160 align:start position:0%
um so those pieces are in it and and in
 
05:11:37.670 --> 05:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
this particular case uh
 
05:11:40.730 --> 05:11:40.740 align:start position:0%
the legislature my understanding is
 
05:11:40.740 --> 05:11:41.570 align:start position:0%
the legislature my understanding is
um

05:11:41.570 --> 05:11:41.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:44.270 --> 05:11:44.280 align:start position:0%
is not going to be particularly hands
 
05:11:44.280 --> 05:11:45.170 align:start position:0%
is not going to be particularly hands
off

05:11:45.170 --> 05:11:45.180 align:start position:0%
off
 
05:11:48.110 --> 05:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
this project and so I would anticipate
 
05:11:50.868 --> 05:11:50.878 align:start position:0%
lots and lots of questions like that but
 
05:11:52.550 --> 05:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have to be and I'm going to
 
05:11:54.890 --> 05:11:54.900 align:start position:0%
use an example the steps to the
 
05:11:58.448 --> 05:11:58.458 align:start position:0%
legislature were rebuilt at some point
 
05:12:02.090 --> 05:12:02.100 align:start position:0%
and that project was removed from the
 
05:12:06.708 --> 05:12:06.718 align:start position:0%
executive branch budget and as a result
 
05:12:06.718 --> 05:12:07.610 align:start position:0%
executive branch budget and as a result
um

05:12:07.610 --> 05:12:07.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:09.830 --> 05:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
you know I used to get
 
05:12:11.990 --> 05:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
um at least I get teased by the governor
 
05:12:13.730 --> 05:12:13.740 align:start position:0%
right because he's got a he'd look out
 
05:12:16.368 --> 05:12:16.378 align:start position:0%
his window and see it hmm yeah
 
05:12:19.610 --> 05:12:19.620 align:start position:0%
exactly and I every time I came up I'm
 
05:12:21.530 --> 05:12:21.540 align:start position:0%
like I got nothing to do with that and
 
05:12:23.810 --> 05:12:23.820 align:start position:0%
neither does anybody else over here and
 
05:12:25.670 --> 05:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
that's that and it's
 
05:12:27.288 --> 05:12:27.298 align:start position:0%
and it was important for me to say that
 
05:12:28.730 --> 05:12:28.740 align:start position:0%
because I was like I don't I don't know
 
05:12:29.810 --> 05:12:29.820 align:start position:0%
what's going on I can't answer any
 
05:12:32.750 --> 05:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
questions and so that can happen if a
 
05:12:36.288 --> 05:12:36.298 align:start position:0%
project is of particular importance and
 
05:12:37.910 --> 05:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
the legislature signs off on it being
 
05:12:40.128 --> 05:12:40.138 align:start position:0%
removed from any oversight but that's
 
05:12:40.138 --> 05:12:41.690 align:start position:0%
removed from any oversight but that's
rare

05:12:41.690 --> 05:12:41.700 align:start position:0%
rare
 
05:12:46.368 --> 05:12:46.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:49.368 --> 05:12:49.378 align:start position:0%
so I'll have the governor call you
 
05:12:51.230 --> 05:12:51.240 align:start position:0%
so fortunately the governor can't see
 
05:12:53.208 --> 05:12:53.218 align:start position:0%
the rest of us from his window but
 
05:12:53.218 --> 05:12:55.310 align:start position:0%
the rest of us from his window but
anyway

05:12:55.310 --> 05:12:55.320 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
05:12:55.320 --> 05:12:56.208 align:start position:0%
anyway
um

05:12:56.208 --> 05:12:56.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:58.430 --> 05:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
so does to follow up on Karen's Point
 
05:12:58.440 --> 05:13:01.128 align:start position:0%
so does to follow up on Karen's Point
yes

05:13:01.128 --> 05:13:01.138 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:13:03.530 --> 05:13:03.540 align:start position:0%
we've heard and use the example well the
 
05:13:05.750 --> 05:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
bed's going to cost a million dollars or
 
05:13:07.128 --> 05:13:07.138 align:start position:0%
maybe I thought it was two million
 
05:13:09.830 --> 05:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
dollars or whatever we've heard all each
 
05:13:12.050 --> 05:13:12.060 align:start position:0%
parking space is going to cost thirty
 
05:13:14.628 --> 05:13:14.638 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars and up to fifty
 
05:13:16.430 --> 05:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars and my colleague to the
 
05:13:18.948 --> 05:13:18.958 align:start position:0%
left said why should we pay fifty
 
05:13:20.448 --> 05:13:20.458 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for a parking space
 
05:13:22.910 --> 05:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
when my car is worth fourteen thousand
 
05:13:23.890 --> 05:13:23.900 align:start position:0%
or whatever
 
05:13:26.690 --> 05:13:26.700 align:start position:0%
but the concern I have and I think
 
05:13:28.730 --> 05:13:28.740 align:start position:0%
you'll see this next Tuesday so just
 
05:13:30.170 --> 05:13:30.180 align:start position:0%
giving you a heads up
 
05:13:32.690 --> 05:13:32.700 align:start position:0%
the division wants to see at least most
 
05:13:35.448 --> 05:13:35.458 align:start position:0%
of us I believe oversight and we want to
 
05:13:38.530 --> 05:13:38.540 align:start position:0%
see your involvement because as you said
 
05:13:41.150 --> 05:13:41.160 align:start position:0%
it's going to be your problem after it's
 
05:13:41.160 --> 05:13:42.230 align:start position:0%
it's going to be your problem after it's
built

05:13:42.230 --> 05:13:42.240 align:start position:0%
built
 
05:13:45.410 --> 05:13:45.420 align:start position:0%
we have 25 million dollars as you know
 
05:13:47.208 --> 05:13:47.218 align:start position:0%
and we don't want to exceed that amount
 
05:13:48.708 --> 05:13:48.718 align:start position:0%
but we don't want to get to a point that
 
05:13:50.510 --> 05:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
oh that's only going to buy us 200
 
05:13:50.520 --> 05:13:52.190 align:start position:0%
oh that's only going to buy us 200
spaces

05:13:52.190 --> 05:13:52.200 align:start position:0%
spaces
 
05:13:55.128 --> 05:13:55.138 align:start position:0%
so I hope that you and representative
 
05:13:57.890 --> 05:13:57.900 align:start position:0%
evil perhaps working together can come
 
05:14:00.050 --> 05:14:00.060 align:start position:0%
up with some language
 
05:14:02.990 --> 05:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
that you will have oversight so there'll
 
05:14:05.170 --> 05:14:05.180 align:start position:0%
be discussion there'll be participation
 
05:14:07.850 --> 05:14:07.860 align:start position:0%
whether it's a group of people or some
 
05:14:10.970 --> 05:14:10.980 align:start position:0%
existing oversight group but we want you
 
05:14:13.550 --> 05:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
involved and as the legislation is
 
05:14:15.948 --> 05:14:15.958 align:start position:0%
written now there is no involvement
 
05:14:18.890 --> 05:14:18.900 align:start position:0%
required so we want to make that kind of
 
05:14:21.230 --> 05:14:21.240 align:start position:0%
clear that we don't want people looking
 
05:14:23.690 --> 05:14:23.700 align:start position:0%
out of their window and saying wow 1.8
 
05:14:27.830 --> 05:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
million dollars for stairs so that's
 
05:14:29.390 --> 05:14:29.400 align:start position:0%
where we're going with this I want to
 
05:14:31.550 --> 05:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
give you an opportunity in advance of
 
05:14:33.830 --> 05:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
Tuesday to maybe sit down with
 
05:14:35.510 --> 05:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
representative evil and others on the
 
05:14:37.670 --> 05:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
division to come up with some language
 
05:14:40.910 --> 05:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
so there is some clear Direction and
 
05:14:42.948 --> 05:14:42.958 align:start position:0%
then we stay within 25 million and we
 
05:14:44.868 --> 05:14:44.878 align:start position:0%
get the spaces we need not only for the
 
05:14:47.868 --> 05:14:47.878 align:start position:0%
legislature but maybe some for you too
 
05:14:50.750 --> 05:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
I um I I think it'd be great and I'd be
 
05:14:53.628 --> 05:14:53.638 align:start position:0%
more than happy to and what we had said
 
05:14:55.310 --> 05:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
um I had a meeting the other day with
 
05:14:56.868 --> 05:14:56.878 align:start position:0%
the with the director of Public Works
 
05:14:59.390 --> 05:14:59.400 align:start position:0%
and and with the speaker and assorted
 
05:15:00.890 --> 05:15:00.900 align:start position:0%
other people
 
05:15:02.810 --> 05:15:02.820 align:start position:0%
um including the operating officer for
 
05:15:06.948 --> 05:15:06.958 align:start position:0%
the uh for the house for the legislature
 
05:15:09.230 --> 05:15:09.240 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
05:15:11.990 --> 05:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
talk to him about the the rough estimate
 
05:15:14.030 --> 05:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
we have today why that rough estimate
 
05:15:16.190 --> 05:15:16.200 align:start position:0%
was where it is what the what the
 
05:15:17.868 --> 05:15:17.878 align:start position:0%
inflection points in that estimate are
 
05:15:21.110 --> 05:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
and and one of the things I said is is I
 
05:15:24.530 --> 05:15:24.540 align:start position:0%
will understand when a bill passes that
 
05:15:25.970 --> 05:15:25.980 align:start position:0%
you're not putting down a down payment
 
05:15:28.250 --> 05:15:28.260 align:start position:0%
that you're giving an appropriation
 
05:15:31.970 --> 05:15:31.980 align:start position:0%
that's a budget and that we must do the
 
05:15:34.670 --> 05:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
task you have commanded within that
 
05:15:37.850 --> 05:15:37.860 align:start position:0%
budget and a garage is a little bit
 
05:15:40.310 --> 05:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
easier to do that with because there are
 
05:15:43.128 --> 05:15:43.138 align:start position:0%
and go up and down on spaces and and
 
05:15:46.190 --> 05:15:46.200 align:start position:0%
there's some ability to that but I from
 
05:15:48.230 --> 05:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
our standpoint
 
05:15:50.270 --> 05:15:50.280 align:start position:0%
um this is not just true on property or
 
05:15:52.368 --> 05:15:52.378 align:start position:0%
construction it's for an accounting and
 
05:15:54.230 --> 05:15:54.240 align:start position:0%
it's true on Personnel
 
05:15:56.270 --> 05:15:56.280 align:start position:0%
um we're happy to have oversight I said
 
05:15:58.310 --> 05:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
to someone once who people are sometimes
 
05:16:00.230 --> 05:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
nervous about going to I'm going to say
 
05:16:02.390 --> 05:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
governor and Council will pick them and
 
05:16:04.190 --> 05:16:04.200 align:start position:0%
I said I'm not nervous going to governor
 
05:16:06.170 --> 05:16:06.180 align:start position:0%
and Council because I don't care what
 
05:16:07.910 --> 05:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
question they ask because I know what we
 
05:16:10.610 --> 05:16:10.620 align:start position:0%
did I know why we did it and all they're
 
05:16:11.868 --> 05:16:11.878 align:start position:0%
going to ask is what did you do and why
 
05:16:13.128 --> 05:16:13.138 align:start position:0%
did you do it and I have an answer to
 
05:16:14.690 --> 05:16:14.700 align:start position:0%
that they may like it they may not like
 
05:16:16.250 --> 05:16:16.260 align:start position:0%
it but I know that we made the best
 
05:16:18.350 --> 05:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
decision we thought we should make at
 
05:16:20.208 --> 05:16:20.218 align:start position:0%
the time and that we had and that it
 
05:16:21.650 --> 05:16:21.660 align:start position:0%
wasn't capricious
 
05:16:23.150 --> 05:16:23.160 align:start position:0%
because you and I had very good
 
05:16:25.550 --> 05:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
discussions about the Steam Plant and
 
05:16:28.070 --> 05:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
for those of you that don't know it it
 
05:16:29.448 --> 05:16:29.458 align:start position:0%
was very important to Charlie to make
 
05:16:31.930 --> 05:16:31.940 align:start position:0%
sure that the facility fit the community
 
05:16:34.250 --> 05:16:34.260 align:start position:0%
and you go by it looks like it's been
 
05:16:35.930 --> 05:16:35.940 align:start position:0%
there 100 years like Charlie said and I
 
05:16:37.250 --> 05:16:37.260 align:start position:0%
think we want something that looks good
 
05:16:38.948 --> 05:16:38.958 align:start position:0%
but also is
 
05:16:42.590 --> 05:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
Falls within the budget guidelines of 25
 
05:16:45.550 --> 05:16:45.560 align:start position:0%
million dollars and and again I'm
 
05:16:47.510 --> 05:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
concerned because we don't have anything
 
05:16:51.530 --> 05:16:51.540 align:start position:0%
even on a napkin about what the parking
 
05:16:53.750 --> 05:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
space has cost and how many it does
 
05:16:56.868 --> 05:16:56.878 align:start position:0%
really give us so I again I appreciate
 
05:16:59.390 --> 05:16:59.400 align:start position:0%
you working with representative Ebel in
 
05:17:00.708 --> 05:17:00.718 align:start position:0%
the next couple of days that come up
 
05:17:02.270 --> 05:17:02.280 align:start position:0%
with something that gives us some
 
05:17:04.850 --> 05:17:04.860 align:start position:0%
insurance and I can try to get you I can
 
05:17:06.650 --> 05:17:06.660 align:start position:0%
try to get you all a better a better
 
05:17:09.110 --> 05:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
napkin that would be great yeah I mean I
 
05:17:11.208 --> 05:17:11.218 align:start position:0%
and I I don't mean that facetiously but
 
05:17:13.730 --> 05:17:13.740 align:start position:0%
if you uh we gave a sheet and it's a
 
05:17:16.190 --> 05:17:16.200 align:start position:0%
it's a page and it's it's you know 35
 
05:17:19.490 --> 05:17:19.500 align:start position:0%
lines-ish that I gave to the uh house
 
05:17:22.730 --> 05:17:22.740 align:start position:0%
finance Hub division three on um on why
 
05:17:25.788 --> 05:17:25.798 align:start position:0%
we think an 18 bed facility would cost
 
05:17:27.770 --> 05:17:27.780 align:start position:0%
21.6 million dollars or whatever the
 
05:17:30.530 --> 05:17:30.540 align:start position:0%
numbers 21 point something and I think
 
05:17:32.690 --> 05:17:32.700 align:start position:0%
we can get to that level of detail on a
 
05:17:34.970 --> 05:17:34.980 align:start position:0%
on a garage difference is that we
 
05:17:36.350 --> 05:17:36.360 align:start position:0%
haven't we haven't really started
 
05:17:39.170 --> 05:17:39.180 align:start position:0%
talking to a consultant yet and we're on
 
05:17:40.788 --> 05:17:40.798 align:start position:0%
the verge of Contracting so I don't
 
05:17:43.190 --> 05:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
think we know anything
 
05:17:45.288 --> 05:17:45.298 align:start position:0%
I don't think so because we really need
 
05:17:47.390 --> 05:17:47.400 align:start position:0%
you know there's no question no matter
 
05:17:48.948 --> 05:17:48.958 align:start position:0%
who you talk to that we need a new
 
05:17:50.810 --> 05:17:50.820 align:start position:0%
garage you know we shouldn't have people
 
05:17:53.208 --> 05:17:53.218 align:start position:0%
of any age walking up from stores or
 
05:17:56.090 --> 05:17:56.100 align:start position:0%
running under hanging netting to catch
 
05:17:58.490 --> 05:17:58.500 align:start position:0%
concrete that's falling so it's a
 
05:18:01.070 --> 05:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
but we need to have it done I just want
 
05:18:01.080 --> 05:18:01.850 align:start position:0%
but we need to have it done I just want
to

05:18:01.850 --> 05:18:01.860 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:18:04.670 --> 05:18:04.680 align:start position:0%
um are you responsible for the netting
 
05:18:07.310 --> 05:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
wait right that's us isn't it yeah okay
 
05:18:09.590 --> 05:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah
 
05:18:11.448 --> 05:18:11.458 align:start position:0%
representative hatch I believe has a
 
05:18:13.550 --> 05:18:13.560 align:start position:0%
questions thanks Charlie so even though
 
05:18:15.830 --> 05:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
this is out of order I mean
 
05:18:17.330 --> 05:18:17.340 align:start position:0%
normally if this was done through the
 
05:18:19.368 --> 05:18:19.378 align:start position:0%
capital budget there would be specs made
 
05:18:21.670 --> 05:18:21.680 align:start position:0%
there would be uh State Engineers
 
05:18:26.090 --> 05:18:26.100 align:start position:0%
involved prior to plans being drawn and
 
05:18:28.910 --> 05:18:28.920 align:start position:0%
we're we're not using that model
 
05:18:32.690 --> 05:18:32.700 align:start position:0%
um but I guess I the my concern is that
 
05:18:35.270 --> 05:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
we're not using that model and we're
 
05:18:37.850 --> 05:18:37.860 align:start position:0%
circumventing the normal process
 
05:18:39.530 --> 05:18:39.540 align:start position:0%
we're building something that I think is
 
05:18:43.910 --> 05:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
pretty damn major and and how we how
 
05:18:45.410 --> 05:18:45.420 align:start position:0%
will we handle
 
05:18:48.708 --> 05:18:48.718 align:start position:0%
that aspect of it um normally if in my
 
05:18:50.868 --> 05:18:50.878 align:start position:0%
business I built buildings I would just
 
05:18:53.090 --> 05:18:53.100 align:start position:0%
get a contractor I'd consult with an
 
05:18:55.070 --> 05:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
engineer we'd come up with a plan and
 
05:18:56.990 --> 05:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
rebuild it and that's kind of what we're
 
05:18:58.448 --> 05:18:58.458 align:start position:0%
doing for this
 
05:19:02.030 --> 05:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
going to outside resources do you see a
 
05:19:03.890 --> 05:19:03.900 align:start position:0%
problem in doing that or do you think we
 
05:19:06.550 --> 05:19:06.560 align:start position:0%
should back up
 
05:19:10.490 --> 05:19:10.500 align:start position:0%
and and this was my delay up but utilize
 
05:19:13.070 --> 05:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
the resources we have within the state
 
05:19:16.490 --> 05:19:16.500 align:start position:0%
in terms of engineering and otherwise to
 
05:19:18.110 --> 05:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
do this or does it make any I don't
 
05:19:19.670 --> 05:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
think it makes any difference myself but
 
05:19:21.230 --> 05:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
that's me
 
05:19:24.288 --> 05:19:24.298 align:start position:0%
I think I I want to I want to hasten to
 
05:19:26.750 --> 05:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
say that um
 
05:19:29.030 --> 05:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
while the appropriation process is
 
05:19:30.590 --> 05:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
slightly different that we are going to
 
05:19:33.288 --> 05:19:33.298 align:start position:0%
use a normal process We There were
 
05:19:35.390 --> 05:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
meetings a very long time ago when there
 
05:19:37.190 --> 05:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
and when it wasn't clear whether there'd
 
05:19:39.250 --> 05:19:39.260 align:start position:0%
be any money I wouldn't say in 2019
 
05:19:42.050 --> 05:19:42.060 align:start position:0%
to select an architect when and I think
 
05:19:44.150 --> 05:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
at the time there was talk of it being
 
05:19:47.750 --> 05:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
um half garage half office and so we
 
05:19:48.948 --> 05:19:48.958 align:start position:0%
went through we selected an architect
 
05:19:51.170 --> 05:19:51.180 align:start position:0%
when when uh when there was discussion
 
05:19:53.270 --> 05:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
at the end of last session to go forward
 
05:19:54.948 --> 05:19:54.958 align:start position:0%
one of the things I asked is I said you
 
05:19:57.590 --> 05:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
know we went through a process we we got
 
05:19:59.810 --> 05:19:59.820 align:start position:0%
letters of uh qualifications we had we
 
05:20:01.850 --> 05:20:01.860 align:start position:0%
had Ford firms come in an interview they
 
05:20:03.288 --> 05:20:03.298 align:start position:0%
went through a whole lot of it's a lot
 
05:20:05.690 --> 05:20:05.700 align:start position:0%
of work to do a presentation and we
 
05:20:07.490 --> 05:20:07.500 align:start position:0%
picked somebody and I want to use that
 
05:20:08.868 --> 05:20:08.878 align:start position:0%
person because I don't want to just say
 
05:20:10.730 --> 05:20:10.740 align:start position:0%
oh we rolled that out and we're going to
 
05:20:12.530 --> 05:20:12.540 align:start position:0%
pick you know somebody's not somebody's
 
05:20:13.850 --> 05:20:13.860 align:start position:0%
friend I don't I mean that wouldn't
 
05:20:15.530 --> 05:20:15.540 align:start position:0%
happen but somebody's going to go yeah I
 
05:20:17.628 --> 05:20:17.638 align:start position:0%
know a guy we'll do it we don't ever do
 
05:20:19.730 --> 05:20:19.740 align:start position:0%
I know a guy so we had a process we suck
 
05:20:22.070 --> 05:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
with it that's the person we want to use
 
05:20:24.110 --> 05:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
we've not contracted with them but we're
 
05:20:26.650 --> 05:20:26.660 align:start position:0%
on the verge of it so what we would do
 
05:20:29.270 --> 05:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
and again you know there's there's a
 
05:20:30.890 --> 05:20:30.900 align:start position:0%
financial component to it obviously but
 
05:20:32.390 --> 05:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
what we would do is what we would
 
05:20:34.368 --> 05:20:34.378 align:start position:0%
normally do is as part of that
 
05:20:37.010 --> 05:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
qualification based process we would
 
05:20:40.190 --> 05:20:40.200 align:start position:0%
select in this case an architect uh the
 
05:20:41.570 --> 05:20:41.580 align:start position:0%
company I think people know Scotland
 
05:20:44.990 --> 05:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
partners and uh happens to be and the
 
05:20:46.850 --> 05:20:46.860 align:start position:0%
people who the architect who designed
 
05:20:48.368 --> 05:20:48.378 align:start position:0%
the Boiler House
 
05:20:50.930 --> 05:20:50.940 align:start position:0%
that's not the only reason he got the
 
05:20:53.150 --> 05:20:53.160 align:start position:0%
but it made me think he could probably
 
05:20:54.590 --> 05:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
do a garage that would fit in
 
05:20:57.410 --> 05:20:57.420 align:start position:0%
historically they would then do that
 
05:20:59.030 --> 05:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
process there would be a lot of meetings
 
05:21:00.650 --> 05:21:00.660 align:start position:0%
with both the legislature and without
 
05:21:03.288 --> 05:21:03.298 align:start position:0%
admin services to discuss it and there
 
05:21:04.448 --> 05:21:04.458 align:start position:0%
would be people
 
05:21:08.330 --> 05:21:08.340 align:start position:0%
from from your side of the fence as part
 
05:21:10.190 --> 05:21:10.200 align:start position:0%
of that process and particularly as the
 
05:21:12.110 --> 05:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
as the biggest user and we would go
 
05:21:14.150 --> 05:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
through that process and lots of updates
 
05:21:17.270 --> 05:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
but um we could even we could even just
 
05:21:19.368 --> 05:21:19.378 align:start position:0%
say capital budget overview can
 
05:21:22.610 --> 05:21:22.620 align:start position:0%
has oversight of it it's something that
 
05:21:26.150 --> 05:21:26.160 align:start position:0%
simple frankly right well
 
05:21:28.070 --> 05:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
that's the question though like when you
 
05:21:29.868 --> 05:21:29.878 align:start position:0%
when you said like I was in the speed 's
 
05:21:31.190 --> 05:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
office that
 
05:21:32.330 --> 05:21:32.340 align:start position:0%
that when I was working with speaker
 
05:21:34.250 --> 05:21:34.260 align:start position:0%
sure and I was in a lot of those
 
05:21:35.990 --> 05:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
meetings so
 
05:21:38.448 --> 05:21:38.458 align:start position:0%
um so I remember all this but what I
 
05:21:40.128 --> 05:21:40.138 align:start position:0%
don't remember so like that's the
 
05:21:42.708 --> 05:21:42.718 align:start position:0%
question if somebody's hiring an
 
05:21:45.170 --> 05:21:45.180 align:start position:0%
architect or a consultant or whatever
 
05:21:49.010 --> 05:21:49.020 align:start position:0%
for a legislative process a pro a
 
05:21:52.128 --> 05:21:52.138 align:start position:0%
project is it you who does the selecting
 
05:21:55.128 --> 05:21:55.138 align:start position:0%
or ultimately the legislature that does
 
05:21:58.730 --> 05:21:58.740 align:start position:0%
the selecting what happens with with
 
05:22:00.650 --> 05:22:00.660 align:start position:0%
um every Public Works project is there's
 
05:22:03.590 --> 05:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
a committee formed that does a set of
 
05:22:05.390 --> 05:22:05.400 align:start position:0%
interviews and there's a there's a panel
 
05:22:09.890 --> 05:22:09.900 align:start position:0%
in this case that panel in 2019 included
 
05:22:09.900 --> 05:22:10.910 align:start position:0%
in this case that panel in 2019 included
um

05:22:10.910 --> 05:22:10.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:12.708 --> 05:22:12.718 align:start position:0%
the director of Public Works the deputy
 
05:22:14.750 --> 05:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
director of Public Works and included me
 
05:22:17.570 --> 05:22:17.580 align:start position:0%
the city manager for Concord
 
05:22:17.580 --> 05:22:19.010 align:start position:0%
the city manager for Concord
um

05:22:19.010 --> 05:22:19.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:20.810 --> 05:22:20.820 align:start position:0%
somebody else from the legislature and I
 
05:22:22.368 --> 05:22:22.378 align:start position:0%
don't remember it might have been David
 
05:22:22.378 --> 05:22:24.590 align:start position:0%
don't remember it might have been David
alaconis

05:22:24.590 --> 05:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
alaconis
 
05:22:27.110 --> 05:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
um uh Terry paff
 
05:22:29.810 --> 05:22:29.820 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure there's somebody else who
 
05:22:31.730 --> 05:22:31.740 align:start position:0%
I'm not thinking of but so it's a group
 
05:22:34.310 --> 05:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
of people who then listen to all four
 
05:22:37.250 --> 05:22:37.260 align:start position:0%
presentations and score them and uh in
 
05:22:39.890 --> 05:22:39.900 align:start position:0%
the in the high score wins and so and
 
05:22:42.170 --> 05:22:42.180 align:start position:0%
that happens to be what happened
 
05:22:43.128 --> 05:22:43.138 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if it was everybody
 
05:22:44.930 --> 05:22:44.940 align:start position:0%
everybody's First Choice it happened so
 
05:22:47.510 --> 05:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
been mine although frankly there were
 
05:22:50.170 --> 05:22:50.180 align:start position:0%
two or three that were all really good
 
05:22:52.310 --> 05:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
and they all had parking Consultants
 
05:22:54.170 --> 05:22:54.180 align:start position:0%
attached to them so
 
05:22:56.750 --> 05:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
that's a good process and that contract
 
05:22:59.868 --> 05:22:59.878 align:start position:0%
would have to go to government Council
 
05:23:02.288 --> 05:23:02.298 align:start position:0%
so that's that's another
 
05:23:07.788 --> 05:23:07.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:09.770 --> 05:23:09.780 align:start position:0%
see in this case that probably wouldn't
 
05:23:09.780 --> 05:23:12.650 align:start position:0%
see in this case that probably wouldn't
happen

05:23:12.650 --> 05:23:12.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:14.810 --> 05:23:14.820 align:start position:0%
that's why we need you know some
 
05:23:17.570 --> 05:23:17.580 align:start position:0%
language for oversight because it is a
 
05:23:19.250 --> 05:23:19.260 align:start position:0%
legislative thing so really the governor
 
05:23:20.990 --> 05:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
like he said looked out the window and
 
05:23:24.890 --> 05:23:24.900 align:start position:0%
yeah well the the construct now just so
 
05:23:26.690 --> 05:23:26.700 align:start position:0%
you're aware based on the bill that
 
05:23:28.128 --> 05:23:28.138 align:start position:0%
passed last year with the original
 
05:23:30.230 --> 05:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
design work the the 9 million or
 
05:23:31.788 --> 05:23:31.798 align:start position:0%
whatever it was
 
05:23:31.798 --> 05:23:32.930 align:start position:0%
whatever it was
um

05:23:32.930 --> 05:23:32.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:36.110 --> 05:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
the way this will work right now
 
05:23:38.288 --> 05:23:38.298 align:start position:0%
um and I don't believe that the the the
 
05:23:41.208 --> 05:23:41.218 align:start position:0%
garage Bill appropriation that you're
 
05:23:43.310 --> 05:23:43.320 align:start position:0%
considering changes us is it will
 
05:23:46.010 --> 05:23:46.020 align:start position:0%
function as a normal
 
05:23:48.170 --> 05:23:48.180 align:start position:0%
as any normal capital budget Public
 
05:23:50.208 --> 05:23:50.218 align:start position:0%
Works project does and it will go
 
05:23:51.890 --> 05:23:51.900 align:start position:0%
through all of those things the one
 
05:23:53.990 --> 05:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
exception of that is that because it's
 
05:23:55.430 --> 05:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
not in the capital budget it's capital
 
05:23:57.770 --> 05:23:57.780 align:start position:0%
budget oversight involved and and that's
 
05:24:00.350 --> 05:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
easily rectified but but the process
 
05:24:02.750 --> 05:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
will be just as
 
05:24:05.750 --> 05:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
um you know does annex renovation or the
 
05:24:07.550 --> 05:24:07.560 align:start position:0%
new roof on the
 
05:24:11.150 --> 05:24:11.160 align:start position:0%
um on the on something at Spalding thank
 
05:24:13.850 --> 05:24:13.860 align:start position:0%
you on Spalding for example it'll go
 
05:24:17.208 --> 05:24:17.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:19.490 --> 05:24:19.500 align:start position:0%
Mr Hoffman
 
05:24:21.830 --> 05:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
thank you I just wanted to ask a quick
 
05:24:24.830 --> 05:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
question does it matter
 
05:24:27.050 --> 05:24:27.060 align:start position:0%
as far as this process goes whether the
 
05:24:29.270 --> 05:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
appropriation in the bill is to the
 
05:24:31.310 --> 05:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
legislative branch to administrative
 
05:24:31.320 --> 05:24:33.350 align:start position:0%
legislative branch to administrative
services

05:24:33.350 --> 05:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
services
 
05:24:33.360 --> 05:24:37.310 align:start position:0%
services
yes

05:24:37.310 --> 05:24:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:40.010 --> 05:24:40.020 align:start position:0%
I didn't see that if it's appropriated
 
05:24:41.990 --> 05:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
to the legislative branch there is an
 
05:24:46.030 --> 05:24:46.040 align:start position:0%
ability at any point in the process for
 
05:24:49.730 --> 05:24:49.740 align:start position:0%
legislative staff to um
 
05:24:52.490 --> 05:24:52.500 align:start position:0%
decide to change the process without
 
05:24:55.128 --> 05:24:55.138 align:start position:0%
oversight if it were appropriated to us
 
05:25:00.830 --> 05:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:04.010 --> 05:25:04.020 align:start position:0%
as I noticed uh in the 9.3 million
 
05:25:06.530 --> 05:25:06.540 align:start position:0%
appropriation the design and Engineering
 
05:25:10.128 --> 05:25:10.138 align:start position:0%
money went to das and not to the
 
05:25:11.570 --> 05:25:11.580 align:start position:0%
legislative brand I don't want to speak
 
05:25:13.070 --> 05:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
for people who aren't here but my
 
05:25:16.010 --> 05:25:16.020 align:start position:0%
understanding at the time was that one
 
05:25:18.110 --> 05:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
of the Senators and I forget his name
 
05:25:20.288 --> 05:25:20.298 align:start position:0%
but he was the president
 
05:25:23.390 --> 05:25:23.400 align:start position:0%
decided that um
 
05:25:25.850 --> 05:25:25.860 align:start position:0%
that would lead to Greater oversight of
 
05:25:28.190 --> 05:25:28.200 align:start position:0%
the process
 
05:25:30.170 --> 05:25:30.180 align:start position:0%
if I could I'm just looking back at the
 
05:25:32.090 --> 05:25:32.100 align:start position:0%
fiscal note and our memory Services
 
05:25:35.270 --> 05:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
correctly that the appropriation is to
 
05:25:38.330 --> 05:25:38.340 align:start position:0%
the legislative branch
 
05:25:40.010 --> 05:25:40.020 align:start position:0%
so that would reduce our involvement
 
05:25:41.750 --> 05:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
significantly and that's why I'd like
 
05:25:43.730 --> 05:25:43.740 align:start position:0%
you to talk to
 
05:25:46.190 --> 05:25:46.200 align:start position:0%
a good representative from
 
05:25:49.670 --> 05:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
Sunapee right no no London New London
 
05:25:51.530 --> 05:25:51.540 align:start position:0%
well close you represent just for the
 
05:25:53.570 --> 05:25:53.580 align:start position:0%
record I I knew I knew that you
 
05:25:53.580 --> 05:26:02.770 align:start position:0%
record I I knew I knew that you
represent

05:26:02.770 --> 05:26:02.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:05.330 --> 05:26:05.340 align:start position:0%
I believe Mr chairman you were thinking
 
05:26:07.970 --> 05:26:07.980 align:start position:0%
of Lake Sunapee yeah there you go I was
 
05:26:11.090 --> 05:26:11.100 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah Lakeside
 
05:26:12.948 --> 05:26:12.958 align:start position:0%
well that'd be
 
05:26:16.490 --> 05:26:16.500 align:start position:0%
I think we're uh close to done uh
 
05:26:16.500 --> 05:26:17.628 align:start position:0%
I think we're uh close to done uh
hopefully

05:26:17.628 --> 05:26:17.638 align:start position:0%
hopefully
 
05:26:19.910 --> 05:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
anyone has any questions at any time by
 
05:26:21.948 --> 05:26:21.958 align:start position:0%
the way and I'm we're always happy to
 
05:26:23.390 --> 05:26:23.400 align:start position:0%
talk so
 
05:26:23.400 --> 05:26:24.708 align:start position:0%
talk so
and

05:26:24.708 --> 05:26:24.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:26:26.448 --> 05:26:26.458 align:start position:0%
I don't have another meeting till four
 
05:26:28.910 --> 05:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
how long you've been commissioner now
 
05:26:28.920 --> 05:26:31.910 align:start position:0%
how long you've been commissioner now
um

05:26:31.910 --> 05:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:33.530 --> 05:26:33.540 align:start position:0%
five and a half
 
05:26:36.470 --> 05:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
July 2017. I remember we used to write
 
05:26:38.628 --> 05:26:38.638 align:start position:0%
those conservative columns
 
05:26:41.810 --> 05:26:41.820 align:start position:0%
it's a different uh I will note that
 
05:26:44.150 --> 05:26:44.160 align:start position:0%
when my the last of those columns I
 
05:26:44.160 --> 05:26:44.868 align:start position:0%
when my the last of those columns I
wrote

05:26:44.868 --> 05:26:44.878 align:start position:0%
wrote
 
05:26:48.590 --> 05:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
I discussed um how every career is not
 
05:26:50.750 --> 05:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
like the one that preceded it
 
05:26:52.788 --> 05:26:52.798 align:start position:0%
and that my current job does not lend
 
05:26:55.070 --> 05:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
itself to having opinions I've been
 
05:26:56.868 --> 05:26:56.878 align:start position:0%
watching I haven't watched the news in
 
05:26:58.910 --> 05:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
seven years and it's a wonderful
 
05:27:01.430 --> 05:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
wonderful thing
 
05:27:03.470 --> 05:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
well again thanks so much we're lucky to
 
05:27:05.030 --> 05:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
have you Charlie and your staff thank
 
05:27:06.590 --> 05:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
you I'm happy to be here anytime and
 
05:27:14.288 --> 05:27:14.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:50.868 --> 05:27:50.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:50.878 --> 05:27:52.878 align:start position:0%
 
okay
