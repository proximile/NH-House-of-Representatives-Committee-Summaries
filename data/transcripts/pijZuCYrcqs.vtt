I want to thank everybody for being
 
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 align:start position:0%
flexible there was quite a bit of
 
00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 align:start position:0%
juggling Logistics to line this full day
 
00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 align:start position:0%
up but I'm extremely pleased and want to
 
00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 align:start position:0%
give some praise and appreciation to Gen
 
00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 align:start position:0%
4 who I think has been a terrific
 
00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 align:start position:0%
communicator and everybody who's here as
 
00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 align:start position:0%
we have scheduled a half hour for each
 
00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 align:start position:0%
group and I'm confident that that will
 
00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 align:start position:0%
allow for a presentation as you've
 
00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 align:start position:0%
planned and then a good robust round of
 
00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 align:start position:0%
questioning and we'll take the questions
 
00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 align:start position:0%
one at a time around the circle we do
 
00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 align:start position:0%
have two other members who I'm hoping
 
00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 align:start position:0%
will join us and but we're going to
 
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 align:start position:0%
proceed this is being live streamed so
 
00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
it'll be recorded and available for
 
00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 align:start position:0%
anyone who wants to go back and view any
 
00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 align:start position:0%
part of it on YouTube on the New

also a number of our guests are coming
 
00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
to us remotely so we have a video hookup
 
00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 align:start position:0%
as well and
 
00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 align:start position:0%
I think we've got everything dialed in
 
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 align:start position:0%
as far as the technology to go smoothly
 
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
because we have a whole array of guests
 
00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 align:start position:0%

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 align:start position:0%

business tax issues for the Department

of Revenue Administration in the 1980s
 
00:07:10.969 --> 00:07:10.979 align:start position:0%
and 1990s each of whom will speak after
 
00:07:10.979 --> 00:07:13.790 align:start position:0%
and 1990s each of whom will speak after
me

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:16.969 --> 00:07:16.979 align:start position:0%
in the 1999 caterpillar decision
 
00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:18.900 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Supreme Court spotted
 
00:07:20.749 --> 00:07:20.759 align:start position:0%
the basic issue facing this commission
 
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
today when it wrote and I quote
 
00:07:25.309 --> 00:07:25.319 align:start position:0%
we point out that the water's edge
 
00:07:27.529 --> 00:07:27.539 align:start position:0%
method was adopted for the benefit of
 
00:07:29.689 --> 00:07:29.699 align:start position:0%
foreign businesses
 
00:07:31.309 --> 00:07:31.319 align:start position:0%
and the very next sentence in that
 
00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:33.060 align:start position:0%
decision makes it clear that ending
 
00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
Waters Edge and adopting worldwide
 
00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:36.900 align:start position:0%
combined reporting is hardly
 
00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:38.450 align:start position:0%
combined reporting is hardly
unprecedented

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:38.460 align:start position:0%
unprecedented
 
00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:40.500 align:start position:0%
the Court's decision noted that and
 
00:07:41.809 --> 00:07:41.819 align:start position:0%
again I quote
 
00:07:44.689 --> 00:07:44.699 align:start position:0%
prior to 1986 New Hampshire utilized
 
00:07:47.689 --> 00:07:47.699 align:start position:0%
worldwide combined reporting
 
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
so the fundamental question this
 
00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:51.300 align:start position:0%
commission should ask itself
 
00:07:53.029 --> 00:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
is why New Hampshire businesses
 
00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:55.800 align:start position:0%
contractors store owners craft breweries
 
00:07:58.129 --> 00:07:58.139 align:start position:0%
or any other domestic company
 
00:07:59.749 --> 00:07:59.759 align:start position:0%
should be treated differently when it
 
00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:01.560 align:start position:0%
comes to their business tax liability
 
00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:04.380 align:start position:0%
compared to foreign Enterprises
 
00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:06.660 align:start position:0%
obviously we welcome all business to the
 
00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:09.300 align:start position:0%
state whether domestic or foreign
 
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
but why should New Hampshire's business
 
00:08:12.589 --> 00:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
tax structure privilege foreign
 
00:08:12.599 --> 00:08:14.210 align:start position:0%
tax structure privilege foreign
companies

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:14.220 align:start position:0%
companies
 
00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
domestic companies employ more than 9
 
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
out of ten Granite Staters and that's
 
00:08:20.749 --> 00:08:20.759 align:start position:0%
using Global business alliance's own
 
00:08:20.759 --> 00:08:21.770 align:start position:0%
using Global business alliance's own
figures

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:21.780 align:start position:0%
figures
 
00:08:23.689 --> 00:08:23.699 align:start position:0%
so why should those 9 out of 10
 
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:25.800 align:start position:0%
employees and the owners of those
 
00:08:29.029 --> 00:08:29.039 align:start position:0%
companies be forced to operate at an
 
00:08:31.309 --> 00:08:31.319 align:start position:0%
economic disadvantage
 
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
and now the New Hampshire has moved to a
 
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
single sales factor in determining
 
00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:36.959 align:start position:0%
business tax liability it is very likely
 
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:39.240 align:start position:0%
that the competitive disadvantage for
 
00:08:40.969 --> 00:08:40.979 align:start position:0%
domestic businesses for those mom and
 
00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:44.060 align:start position:0%
pop stores could become worse
 
00:08:45.949 --> 00:08:45.959 align:start position:0%
multinationals as you know have the
 
00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:47.940 align:start position:0%
capacity the global operations and the
 
00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
financial incentives to use accounting
 
00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:52.860 align:start position:0%
techniques paper transactions and other
 
00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:55.320 align:start position:0%
tactics all perfectly legal to shift
 
00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:57.180 align:start position:0%
profits to lower tax jurisdictions
 
00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:58.550 align:start position:0%
profits to lower tax jurisdictions
overseas

Water's Edge Provisions obscure the full
 
00:09:02.329 --> 00:09:02.339 align:start position:0%
picture of their activities in New
 
00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from dra because companies are
 
00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:06.180 align:start position:0%
not required to account for their

water's edge
 
00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:12.540 align:start position:0%
as I said these techniques are legal but
 
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
they're anti-competitive and create a
 
00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:16.260 align:start position:0%
two-tier tax system
 
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
the disadvantages homegrown businesses
 
00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:21.060 align:start position:0%
who act whose activities are limited to
 
00:09:24.769 --> 00:09:24.779 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire and the U.S
 
00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:27.420 align:start position:0%
domestic businesses do not share the

accounting capacity or overseas
 
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
resources as a result
 
00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:32.700 align:start position:0%
these companies pay more than their fair
 
00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
share to support state operations funded
 
00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:36.360 align:start position:0%
by business taxes
 
00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:38.820 align:start position:0%
or the state is shortchanged of Revenue
 
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
in a taxation system a Level Playing
 
00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
Field would provide
 
00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:46.620 align:start position:0%
or finally and this is the most likely
 
00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:49.260 align:start position:0%
outcome we get a little each a little
 
00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
bit of each bad outcome
 
00:09:53.389 --> 00:09:53.399 align:start position:0%
and frankly that's already happening a
 
00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
joint January 2019 study by the American
 
00:09:58.790 --> 00:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
sustainable Business Council U.S perg
 
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
and the institute on Taxation and
 
00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:03.180 align:start position:0%
economic policy approximated the cost of
 
00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:05.519 align:start position:0%
multinational multinational profit
 
00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:08.120 align:start position:0%

177 million dollars in Lost Revenue
 
00:10:14.269 --> 00:10:14.279 align:start position:0%
annually just to the state of New
 
00:10:14.279 --> 00:10:15.290 align:start position:0%
annually just to the state of New
Hampshire

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:15.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:17.279 align:start position:0%
this is revenue that could be used to
 
00:10:18.889 --> 00:10:18.899 align:start position:0%
relieve taxpayers either through direct
 
00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:21.420 align:start position:0%
tax cuts or by increasing Aid to cities
 
00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
and towns to relieve property taxes or
 
00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
to provide other services
 
00:10:29.329 --> 00:10:29.339 align:start position:0%
such as support for public schools
 
00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:31.740 align:start position:0%
with Worldwide reporting companies must
 
00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
do for their entire Enterprise without
 
00:10:35.329 --> 00:10:35.339 align:start position:0%
regard to borders
 
00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
this is what they do now for operations
 
00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:38.940 align:start position:0%
in every state in the U.S
 
00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:40.980 align:start position:0%
and obviously any well-run business is
 
00:10:42.769 --> 00:10:42.779 align:start position:0%
doing this in every jurisdiction across
 
00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:45.540 align:start position:0%
the globe although they're not sharing
 
00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:47.100 align:start position:0%
this data with New Hampshire
 
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
or at least they don't have to
 
00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:51.240 align:start position:0%
without worldwide combined reporting new
 
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire-based businesses and the
 
00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
overwhelming number of granted state
 
00:10:56.449 --> 00:10:56.459 align:start position:0%
workers they employ operate at a
 
00:10:58.970 --> 00:10:58.980 align:start position:0%
significant competitive disadvantage
 
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
and those are the companies who employ
 
00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:02.700 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of workers workers and
 
00:11:04.009 --> 00:11:04.019 align:start position:0%
companies who are committed to their
 
00:11:05.509 --> 00:11:05.519 align:start position:0%
communities and are critical
 
00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:07.260 align:start position:0%
contributors to the economic health and
 
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
quality of life in our state
 
00:11:11.389 --> 00:11:11.399 align:start position:0%
Dan Collins who's run his own business
 
00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:13.260 align:start position:0%
for nearly 30 years can speak to that
 
00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:14.389 align:start position:0%
for nearly 30 years can speak to that
impact

00:11:14.389 --> 00:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
impact
 
00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:16.380 align:start position:0%
and Pete Garr can explain how adopting
 
00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
worldwide combined reporting and ending
 
00:11:20.509 --> 00:11:20.519 align:start position:0%
Waters Edge rather than being some novel
 
00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:22.620 align:start position:0%
or even radical scheme will simply
 
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
return New Hampshire businesses to the
 
00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:27.300 align:start position:0%
structure that existed prior to 1986 and
 
00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:28.980 align:start position:0%
so I'll give
 
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:37.860 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone
 
00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:40.620 align:start position:0%
thank you for having me as Thomas said
 
00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:43.260 align:start position:0%
uh my name is Dan Collins
 
00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:45.420 align:start position:0%
I am a 50 year old self-employed
 
00:11:47.509 --> 00:11:47.519 align:start position:0%
residential painting contractor based in
 
00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
the Upper Valley here in New Hampshire
 
00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:51.420 align:start position:0%
I sit before you today as a
 
00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:54.240 align:start position:0%
representative of small business owners
 
00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:55.740 align:start position:0%
I've been a house painter full time
 
00:11:58.550 --> 00:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
since I was in my mid-teens
 
00:12:00.889 --> 00:12:00.899 align:start position:0%
by the age of 18.
 
00:12:03.769 --> 00:12:03.779 align:start position:0%
I was promoted to job site Foreman
 
00:12:05.389 --> 00:12:05.399 align:start position:0%
and that's when I realized that my
 
00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:08.279 align:start position:0%
career was going to be as a Tradesman
 
00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:11.820 align:start position:0%
at 24 I started working for myself
 
00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:14.100 align:start position:0%
I spent the last 26 years building a
 
00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
small business here in the granite state
 
00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:18.180 align:start position:0%
in that time
 
00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
I've had upwards of a hundred people
 
00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:22.860 align:start position:0%
worked with me and beside me
 
00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
I have built a home
 
00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
I've raised a family
 
00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:29.820 align:start position:0%
I've sent my daughter to college
 
00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:33.060 align:start position:0%
and I've taught my son a trade
 
00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:35.220 align:start position:0%
and for all of those 26 years I've
 
00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:37.860 align:start position:0%
always paid my taxes
 
00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:40.620 align:start position:0%
as a locally based small business
 
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
I've never been afforded the opportunity
 
00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:44.700 align:start position:0%
to shift my profits elsewhere to reduce
 
00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
my tax bill
 
00:12:49.069 --> 00:12:49.079 align:start position:0%
that puts me in an economic disadvantage
 
00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
with foreign companies and
 
00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
multinationals that can take advantage
 
00:12:57.769 --> 00:12:57.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
in our local municipality
 
00:13:02.269 --> 00:13:02.279 align:start position:0%
I'm fortunate enough to sit on the
 
00:13:04.009 --> 00:13:04.019 align:start position:0%
select board
 
00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:06.420 align:start position:0%
I serve on the planning board
 
00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:08.940 align:start position:0%
a preservation committee as well as
 
00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:10.740 align:start position:0%
several subcommittees such as updating
 
00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
our master plan for economic growth
 
00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:16.500 align:start position:0%
and exploring options for a community
 
00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:18.170 align:start position:0%
and exploring options for a community
center

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:18.180 align:start position:0%
center
 
00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
I have also as a select board
 
00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.470 align:start position:0%
I have also as a select board
representative

00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:23.160 align:start position:0%
had the opportunity to serve on our
 
00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:25.620 align:start position:0%
budget committee
 
00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
as a public official
 
00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:30.180 align:start position:0%
I have both the honor and the burden
 
00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:33.720 align:start position:0%
of setting a local tax rate
 
00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
I feel it is my responsibility as an
 
00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
elected official
 
00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:39.720 align:start position:0%
to work as hard as I can to keep all
 
00:13:41.389 --> 00:13:41.399 align:start position:0%
residents of our community on the same
 
00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
playing field
 
00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:45.540 align:start position:0%
we have a Level Playing Field in regard
 
00:13:47.569 --> 00:13:47.579 align:start position:0%
to property taxes
 
00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
I would suggest we need a Level Playing
 
00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:51.300 align:start position:0%
Field with regard to business tax as
 
00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:52.970 align:start position:0%
Field with regard to business tax as
well

00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:52.980 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:13:56.329 --> 00:13:56.339 align:start position:0%
with the potential Revenue loss of 177
 
00:13:58.190 --> 00:13:58.200 align:start position:0%
million dollars per year in the state of
 
00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:00.300 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:14:02.329 --> 00:14:02.339 align:start position:0%
I'm sure there are many municipalities
 
00:14:03.769 --> 00:14:03.779 align:start position:0%
in the granite state that would benefit
 
00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
from revenue that is now being shifted
 
00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:08.210 align:start position:0%
from revenue that is now being shifted
elsewhere

00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:08.220 align:start position:0%
elsewhere
 
00:14:09.769 --> 00:14:09.779 align:start position:0%
I would ask this commission to report
 
00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:13.200 align:start position:0%
favorably to the legislature on ending
 
00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
Waters Edge
 
00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:17.160 align:start position:0%
and adopting worldwide combined
 
00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
reporting as the right step to create
 
00:14:22.129 --> 00:14:22.139 align:start position:0%
that Level Playing Field
 
00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:24.060 align:start position:0%
I thank you for your consideration this
 
00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:24.710 align:start position:0%
I thank you for your consideration this
morning

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:14:26.629 --> 00:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate the opportunity to sit
 
00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
my name is Peter Garr
 
00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:41.940 align:start position:0%
I submitted the only Amicus brief and
 
00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
the caterpillar case
 
00:14:47.449 --> 00:14:47.459 align:start position:0%
my Amicus was over 30 pages
 
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
my testimony today is six now six and a
 
00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:52.980 align:start position:0%
half pages long
 
00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:55.620 align:start position:0%
I trust I will be afforded the time to
 
00:14:58.670 --> 00:14:58.680 align:start position:0%
read it to the commission
 
00:15:00.949 --> 00:15:00.959 align:start position:0%
I was the business profits tax auditor
 
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Revenue from 1980
 
00:15:05.629 --> 00:15:05.639 align:start position:0%
to 1997.
 
00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:07.860 align:start position:0%
during that time I traveled around the
 
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
country to the headquarters of
 
00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
corporations that had operations in New
 
00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.970 align:start position:0%
corporations that had operations in New
Hampshire

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:13.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:15:16.069 --> 00:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
most of the corporations that I visited
 
00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:18.740 align:start position:0%
were multiform with a parent Corporation
 
00:15:21.769 --> 00:15:21.779 align:start position:0%
and any number of subsidiaries operating
 
00:15:26.389 --> 00:15:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
when I started in 1980 the audits were
 
00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:30.660 align:start position:0%
conducted on separate accounting
 
00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:33.180 align:start position:0%
separate entity tax returns
 
00:15:35.569 --> 00:15:35.579 align:start position:0%
for example if the corporation that had
 
00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:37.260 align:start position:0%
operations in New Hampshire had a
 
00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:38.329 align:start position:0%
operations in New Hampshire had a
subsidiary

00:15:38.329 --> 00:15:38.339 align:start position:0%
subsidiary
 
00:15:41.629 --> 00:15:41.639 align:start position:0%
I audited only that subsidiary as if it
 
00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:44.220 align:start position:0%
was a standalone Corporation with no
 
00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:46.740 align:start position:0%
connections to related subsidiaries
 
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
or the parent Corporation
 
00:15:51.769 --> 00:15:51.779 align:start position:0%
in these audits few adjustments were
 
00:15:53.509 --> 00:15:53.519 align:start position:0%
made to the tax base
 
00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
most of the audit adjustments concerned
 
00:15:58.730 --> 00:15:58.740 align:start position:0%
the apportionment formula the percent of
 
00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:01.320 align:start position:0%
sales payroll and real property in New
 
00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:03.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to total sales payroll and
 
00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
real property
 
00:16:08.449 --> 00:16:08.459 align:start position:0%
then the law changed in 1981 that
 
00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:10.260 align:start position:0%
allowed the department or corporations
 
00:16:14.569 --> 00:16:14.579 align:start position:0%
to employ the unitary combined method
 
00:16:17.389 --> 00:16:17.399 align:start position:0%
of course corporations that benefited
 
00:16:20.629 --> 00:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
while unitary tax returns to pay lesser
 
00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
amounts of business profits tax
 
00:16:26.329 --> 00:16:26.339 align:start position:0%
however it was only upon audits that
 
00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:28.860 align:start position:0%
combined corporations paid more business
 
00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:32.820 align:start position:0%
profits taxed under the unitary method
 
00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
it should be noted that the new that New
 
00:16:36.829 --> 00:16:36.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire adopted the unitary worldwide
 
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
combined method before it had been
 
00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:41.100 align:start position:0%
tested in a lawsuit
 
00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:43.740 align:start position:0%
that lawsuit container Corp V California
 
00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:50.749 --> 00:16:50.759 align:start position:0%
purpose of the unitary combined method
 
00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:52.740 align:start position:0%
was to counteract The Profit shifting
 
00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:55.380 align:start position:0%
that occurs between corporate members of
 
00:16:58.249 --> 00:16:58.259 align:start position:0%
a group of Corporations controlled by a
 
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
parent Corporation
 
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
enter company transactions occur at
 
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
prices determined determined by internal
 
00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
corporate accounting departments and
 
00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
international accounting firms
 
00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
referred to as transfer pricing
 
00:17:16.429 --> 00:17:16.439 align:start position:0%
the big four worldwide accounting firms
 
00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:18.540 align:start position:0%
are based in Britain and tax avoidance
 
00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
as their specialty
 
00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:23.720 align:start position:0%
a good example of profit shifting
 
00:17:25.789 --> 00:17:25.799 align:start position:0%
transfer pricing within the United
 
00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:28.079 align:start position:0%
States is Home Depot
 
00:17:30.169 --> 00:17:30.179 align:start position:0%
which formed a subsidiary in the state
 
00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
of Delaware
 
00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:34.740 align:start position:0%
it was revealed in an Arizona lawsuit
 
00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
that the Delaware subsidiary had just
 
00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:38.700 align:start position:0%
four employees
 
00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
but reported profits of about 4.7
 
00:17:45.529 --> 00:17:45.539 align:start position:0%
billion dollars over three years
 
00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:47.940 align:start position:0%
compared to 3.8 billion over the same
 
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
period for Home Depot the parent
 
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.669 align:start position:0%
period for Home Depot the parent
Corporation

00:17:52.669 --> 00:17:52.679 align:start position:0%
Corporation
 
00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:55.620 align:start position:0%
profit shifting like this was and is a
 
00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:57.240 align:start position:0%
huge loss for separate accounting
 
00:17:58.909 --> 00:17:58.919 align:start position:0%
separate energy states
 
00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
that utilize the arm's length principle
 
00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:05.160 align:start position:0%
where inner company transactions are
 
00:18:07.029 --> 00:18:07.039 align:start position:0%
supposed to be the same as between
 
00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
after New Hampshire adopted the unitary
 
00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:16.740 align:start position:0%
business principle in 1981
 
00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:19.860 align:start position:0%
it was the policy of Lloyd Price
 
00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:22.440 align:start position:0%
the Dre commissioner that we would not
 
00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
employ unitary combined reporting that
 
00:18:27.169 --> 00:18:27.179 align:start position:0%
the subsidiary was owned by a foreign
 
00:18:27.179 --> 00:18:29.150 align:start position:0%
the subsidiary was owned by a foreign
parent

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
parent
 
00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:32.340 align:start position:0%
as a result of this policy Barn owned
 
00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:34.500 align:start position:0%
corporations were allowed to continue to
 
00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:35.270 align:start position:0%
corporations were allowed to continue to
file

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
file
 
00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:37.020 align:start position:0%
separate accounting separate entity
 
00:18:40.549 --> 00:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
business profits tax returns
 
00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:43.500 align:start position:0%
I thought that this policy was wrong
 
00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
the letterhead of the Department of
 
00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
Revenue is the old man in the mountains
 
00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:51.660 align:start position:0%
surrounded by the words equity for all
 
00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:53.700 align:start position:0%
treating U.S subsidiaries owned by
 
00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:55.980 align:start position:0%
Foreign parents one way on a separate
 
00:18:57.289 --> 00:18:57.299 align:start position:0%
entity basis
 
00:18:59.390 --> 00:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
and U.S subsidiaries owned by U.S
 
00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
parents another way on a worldwide basis
 
00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
was and is not equity for all it does
 
00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
not ring true
 
00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:11.220 align:start position:0%
in 1994 the U.S Supreme Court and the
 
00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:13.380 align:start position:0%
Barclays Bank decision found that it was
 
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
constitutional for a state to employ the
 
00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:18.660 align:start position:0%
unitary worldwide method with a foreign
 
00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:19.610 align:start position:0%
unitary worldwide method with a foreign
parent

00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:19.620 align:start position:0%
parent
 
00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
the vote was seven to two in favor of
 
00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:23.390 align:start position:0%
the vote was seven to two in favor of
California

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
California
 
00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
in the companion case where the U.S
 
00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
parent Colgate Palmolive the vote was
 
00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:34.380 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire attorney general at that
 
00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:37.140 align:start position:0%
time Jeffrey Howard joined an amicus
 
00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:43.500 align:start position:0%
in support of the worldwide method also
 
00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:46.200 align:start position:0%
filing an amicus and support were United
 
00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:49.380 align:start position:0%
States Senator Senators Byron dorgan Ted
 
00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
Stevens Frank murkowski Judd Gregg and
 
00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:54.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
I just realized I missed the page so I
 
00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:00.660 align:start position:0%
have to back up a little bit I apologize
 
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
regarding Home Depot
 
00:20:04.789 --> 00:20:04.799 align:start position:0%
if Home Depot was a foreign parent and
 
00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
had similar had a similar subsidiary in
 
00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:10.380 align:start position:0%
Bermuda or Luxembourg most likely no
 
00:20:12.409 --> 00:20:12.419 align:start position:0%
profits or diminished profits would be
 
00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:15.900 align:start position:0%
reported to and taxable by Uncle Sam or
 
00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
any state
 
00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:20.340 align:start position:0%
there are a number of documentaries that
 
00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:22.140 align:start position:0%
explain how multinational corporations
 
00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:24.660 align:start position:0%
avoid income taxes by shifting profits
 
00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:26.220 align:start position:0%
to tax Havens
 
00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:28.860 align:start position:0%
I recommend watching too
 
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
the town that took on the tax man a
 
00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
British production
 
00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
and the tax-free tour a Dutch production
 
00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:39.240 align:start position:0%
both are available free on YouTube and
 
00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:41.460 align:start position:0%
it's best to watch with closed captions
 
00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:44.570 align:start position:0%
it's best to watch with closed captions
on

00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:44.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:46.980 align:start position:0%
I do not know why the business profits
 
00:20:49.669 --> 00:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
tax law was changed in 1981 but I
 
00:20:51.409 --> 00:20:51.419 align:start position:0%
suspect it was due to the U.S Supreme
 
00:20:55.549 --> 00:20:55.559 align:start position:0%
Court's 1980 Mobile Oil V Vermont and
 
00:20:58.730 --> 00:20:58.740 align:start position:0%
Exxon V Wisconsin decisions
 
00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:01.020 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire attorney general Tom Rath
 
00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
joined other states in an amicus brief
 
00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:05.400 align:start position:0%
that supported both Vermont and
 
00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:07.190 align:start position:0%
that supported both Vermont and
Wisconsin

00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
Wisconsin
 
00:21:09.529 --> 00:21:09.539 align:start position:0%
if you haven't read these decisions I
 
00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
encourage you to do so
 
00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:14.100 align:start position:0%
both cases concerned separate entity tax
 
00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
returns filed by mobile and Exxon
 
00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:19.620 align:start position:0%
although mobile and Exxon were very
 
00:21:21.529 --> 00:21:21.539 align:start position:0%
profit profitable for the years in
 
00:21:21.539 --> 00:21:22.430 align:start position:0%
profit profitable for the years in
question

00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:25.020 align:start position:0%
mobile reported zero separate entity
 
00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:27.780 align:start position:0%
profits for two of the three years and
 
00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
Exxon reported no separate energy
 
00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:31.620 align:start position:0%
profits for all four
 
00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
of the years in question
 
00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:37.400 align:start position:0%
in both cases the Vermont and Wisconsin
 
00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:40.140 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue employ the unitary
 
00:21:42.169 --> 00:21:42.179 align:start position:0%
business principle which the court
 
00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:44.100 align:start position:0%
stated was the linchpin of
 
00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:46.010 align:start position:0%
stated was the linchpin of
apportionability

00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:46.020 align:start position:0%
apportionability
 
00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
both States won their case against these
 
00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:50.280 align:start position:0%
oil companies that had made millions
 
00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:52.740 align:start position:0%
that had made hundreds of billions in
 
00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:00.649 --> 00:22:00.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
or not Vermont did not adopt
 
00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:05.940 align:start position:0%
unitary combination
 
00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:11.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:14.149 --> 00:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
but they did State their reason which
 
00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
was described in a well and a
 
00:22:18.409 --> 00:22:18.419 align:start position:0%
well-written statement of intent which
 
00:22:21.490 --> 00:22:21.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
Vermont's separate accounting system is
 
00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
inadequate to measure the income of a
 
00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
corporation with non-vermont affiliates
 
00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:32.700 align:start position:0%
and creates tax disadvantages for
 
00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
Vermont corporations which compete with
 
00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
multi-state and multinational
 
00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:40.500 align:start position:0%
corporations doing business in Vermont
 
00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:43.260 align:start position:0%
it is the intent of the general assembly
 
00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
and adopting a unitary combined
 
00:22:46.669 --> 00:22:46.679 align:start position:0%
reporting system
 
00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
to put all corporations doing business
 
00:22:51.649 --> 00:22:51.659 align:start position:0%
in Vermont on an equal income tax
 
00:22:51.659 --> 00:22:57.350 align:start position:0%
in Vermont on an equal income tax
footing

00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:59.750 --> 00:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
however for some unknown reason Mr
 
00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
Garrett yes if I can please interrupt
 
00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:05.940 align:start position:0%
we have your written comments and I see
 
00:23:07.549 --> 00:23:07.559 align:start position:0%
they are extensive and the time that
 
00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:09.480 align:start position:0%
it's taking to read them in full is
 
00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
eating up the time that
 
00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
um that your panel has so I'm not going
 
00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:16.980 align:start position:0%
to stop it at exactly 10 o'clock but I
 
00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:19.020 align:start position:0%
wonder if you can summarize allow us to
 
00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:20.090 align:start position:0%
wonder if you can summarize allow us to
read

00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
read
 
00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
the comments in detail which we will do
 
00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:26.940 align:start position:0%
and and that will leave some time for
 
00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
questions of the panel
 
00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:31.320 align:start position:0%
excuse me Mr
 
00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
determine we started at 9 36 with Mr
 
00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:38.220 align:start position:0%
opal yes that's why I tend to be lenient
 
00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:40.740 align:start position:0%
on thank you sir but I do think that
 
00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
reading the entire thing will not serve
 
00:23:45.289 --> 00:23:45.299 align:start position:0%
you the best
 
00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:47.820 align:start position:0%
I'll try my best
 
00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:50.460 align:start position:0%
in 1983 the U.S Supreme Court decided
 
00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:52.440 align:start position:0%
that Container Corporation case
 
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
which which concerned employment of the
 
00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
unitary business principle across a
 
00:23:59.090 --> 00:23:59.100 align:start position:0%
group of related corporations
 
00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
container was a U.S based parent with
 
00:24:03.289 --> 00:24:03.299 align:start position:0%
both domestic and foreign subsidiaries
 
00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:05.039 align:start position:0%
this was the first time that the court
 
00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
approved unitary combined reporting on a
 
00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
worldwide basis
 
00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:10.860 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the court did not address
 
00:24:13.610 --> 00:24:13.620 align:start position:0%
unitary worldwide combined reporting but
 
00:24:15.289 --> 00:24:15.299 align:start position:0%
the foreign parent
 
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
with U.S operations
 
00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire attorney general at
 
00:24:21.649 --> 00:24:21.659 align:start position:0%
that time Gregory Smith joined with
 
00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:23.940 align:start position:0%
other states in an amicus brief in
 
00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:26.100 align:start position:0%
support of California and worldwide
 
00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:27.720 align:start position:0%

associations and foreign governments
 
00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:34.860 align:start position:0%
filed amicus briefs in opposition
 
00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
foreign objections and a lawsuit
 
00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:39.720 align:start position:0%
concerning a u.s-based multinational

concerning a u.s-based multinational
corporation

00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:47.640 align:start position:0%
I would like to read two short sections
 
00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire AGS Amicus
 
00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:55.020 align:start position:0%
and the Barclays Bank case
 
00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
quote to believe that a multinational
 
00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:59.029 align:start position:0%
quote to believe that a multinational

00:24:59.029 --> 00:24:59.039 align:start position:0%
corporations
 
00:25:00.409 --> 00:25:00.419 align:start position:0%
that to believe that multinational
 
00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
corporations do not maintain an
 
00:25:04.789 --> 00:25:04.799 align:start position:0%
advantage over independent corporations
 
00:25:06.649 --> 00:25:06.659 align:start position:0%
operating within a similar business
 
00:25:09.529 --> 00:25:09.539 align:start position:0%
sphere is to ignore the economic and
 
00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:11.100 align:start position:0%
political strength of the multinational
 
00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:12.590 align:start position:0%
political strength of the multinational
Giants

00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
Giants
 
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
by attempting to treat those businesses
 
00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:17.400 align:start position:0%
which are in fact unitary as independent
 
00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:20.220 align:start position:0%
entities separate accounting operates in
 
00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:22.440 align:start position:0%
a university of pretense
 
00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
as an Alice in Wonderland it turns
 
00:25:27.529 --> 00:25:27.539 align:start position:0%
reality into fancy and then pretends it
 
00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
is the real world
 
00:25:33.529 --> 00:25:33.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
the unitary method of tax accounting is
 
00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:38.820 align:start position:0%
an integrated consent conceptually Fair
 
00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:41.340 align:start position:0%
basis of Taxation which seeks to negate
 
00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:43.980 align:start position:0%
the intense complexities of injured
 
00:25:45.769 --> 00:25:45.779 align:start position:0%
corporate international tax accounting
 
00:25:48.529 --> 00:25:48.539 align:start position:0%
embodied in the arm's length method
 
00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:51.240 align:start position:0%
the arms like method treats each legal
 
00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:53.340 align:start position:0%
corporate entity as if it were real
 
00:25:55.789 --> 00:25:55.799 align:start position:0%
while ignoring the identity of the whole
 
00:25:55.799 --> 00:25:57.110 align:start position:0%
while ignoring the identity of the whole
Enterprise

00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
Enterprise
 
00:25:59.510 --> 00:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
the unitary method identifies the income
 
00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:01.320 align:start position:0%
of the whole and then apportions that
 
00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:03.900 align:start position:0%
income according to the proportionate
 
00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
contribution to the taxing state
 
00:26:09.409 --> 00:26:09.419 align:start position:0%
after the Supreme Court's 1994 decision
 
00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:11.580 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire did not repeal the water's
 
00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:13.860 align:start position:0%
edge method and return to the worldwide
 
00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:16.070 align:start position:0%
edge method and return to the worldwide
method

00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
method
 
00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:17.820 align:start position:0%
after I left the Department of Revenue
 
00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:20.580 align:start position:0%
in 1997 I felt compelled to file an
 
00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
amicus brief in caterpillar's lawsuit
 
00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
against the department
 
00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:26.220 align:start position:0%
I disagreed with the department and I
 
00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:29.100 align:start position:0%
disagreed with caterpillar's position
 
00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:30.900 align:start position:0%
caterpillar argued that royalty and
 
00:26:32.269 --> 00:26:32.279 align:start position:0%
interest income from as far as
 
00:26:34.549 --> 00:26:34.559 align:start position:0%
subsidiaries should not be taxable in
 
00:26:36.289 --> 00:26:36.299 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:26:37.909 --> 00:26:37.919 align:start position:0%
and in other words should not be in
 
00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:40.140 align:start position:0%
their pre-apportionment tax base and the
 
00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:41.940 align:start position:0%
alternative caterpillar wanted more
 
00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:43.380 align:start position:0%
weight in the apportionment factors
 
00:26:45.769 --> 00:26:45.779 align:start position:0%
either way caterpillar wanted to reduce
 
00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:47.340 align:start position:0%
the amount that they owed in business
 
00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:48.900 align:start position:0%
profits tax
 
00:26:51.289 --> 00:26:51.299 align:start position:0%
I argued that the remedy was the
 
00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
worldwide combined reporting method that
 
00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
the U.S Supreme Court said was
 
00:26:57.169 --> 00:26:57.179 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional was constitutional
 
00:27:03.169 --> 00:27:03.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:05.400 align:start position:0%
I do not know if my Amicus brief paid
 
00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:07.980 align:start position:0%
any port part in the Court's a unanimous
 
00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:10.200 align:start position:0%
decision where it stated we point out
 
00:27:12.649 --> 00:27:12.659 align:start position:0%
that the waters method was adopted for
 
00:27:15.049 --> 00:27:15.059 align:start position:0%
the benefit of foreign businesses
 
00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:17.400 align:start position:0%
how else can you interpret or restate
 
00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:19.740 align:start position:0%
for the benefit of foreign businesses
 
00:27:22.909 --> 00:27:22.919 align:start position:0%
this is preferential trap tax treatment
 
00:27:24.890 --> 00:27:24.900 align:start position:0%
not for New Hampshire or Vermont or
 
00:27:27.049 --> 00:27:27.059 align:start position:0%
California corporations but British
 
00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:28.980 align:start position:0%
French and German corporations operating
 
00:27:31.669 --> 00:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
in our state and throughout our country
 
00:27:33.529 --> 00:27:33.539 align:start position:0%
it would be like a meals and rooms tax
 
00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:35.400 align:start position:0%
that offered a reduced tax rate or
 
00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:37.260 align:start position:0%
exemption for visitors from Canada or
 
00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:38.269 align:start position:0%
exemption for visitors from Canada or
Spain

00:27:38.269 --> 00:27:38.279 align:start position:0%
Spain
 
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
the legislature could pass this in order
 
00:27:42.169 --> 00:27:42.179 align:start position:0%
to attract more out of country visitors
 
00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:44.100 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire but would it be
 
00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:47.090 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire but would it be
constitutional

00:27:47.090 --> 00:27:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
I suspect this is why the waters this
 
00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:50.820 align:start position:0%
method was not changed back to the
 
00:27:53.049 --> 00:27:53.059 align:start position:0%
worldwide method after the Court's
 
00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:55.260 align:start position:0%
Barclays Bank decision
 
00:27:57.409 --> 00:27:57.419 align:start position:0%
the state wanted to attract foreign
 
00:27:59.750 --> 00:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
corporations to New Hampshire but at
 
00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:01.260 align:start position:0%
what expense
 
00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:03.900 align:start position:0%
the dra did not know what effect going
 
00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:05.580 align:start position:0%
from worldwide to Water's Edge would
 
00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:08.520 align:start position:0%
have and business profits tax revenues
 
00:28:10.669 --> 00:28:10.679 align:start position:0%
the dra does not know what effect going
 
00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:12.360 align:start position:0%
from Water's Edge back to worldwide
 
00:28:13.789 --> 00:28:13.799 align:start position:0%
would have on business profits tax
 
00:28:13.799 --> 00:28:14.990 align:start position:0%
would have on business profits tax
revenues

00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
00:28:17.029 --> 00:28:17.039 align:start position:0%
all we know is that foreign corporations
 
00:28:20.269 --> 00:28:20.279 align:start position:0%
do not like the worldwide method
 
00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:23.220 align:start position:0%
and House Bill 121 FN representative
 
00:28:25.549 --> 00:28:25.559 align:start position:0%
Shambrook said that the 1986 change to
 
00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:28.200 align:start position:0%
the water's edge method was a mistake
 
00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
I would go further and say that the
 
00:28:33.169 --> 00:28:33.179 align:start position:0%
change was and is unconstitutional
 
00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:35.340 align:start position:0%
the waterset's method violates equal
 
00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:37.860 align:start position:0%
protection on the 14th Amendment it is
 
00:28:42.289 --> 00:28:42.299 align:start position:0%
unlawful a bad law that discriminates
 
00:28:44.029 --> 00:28:44.039 align:start position:0%
in Prior cases the courts have
 
00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
determined that corporations are persons
 
00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
and subject to equal protection under
 
00:28:49.789 --> 00:28:49.799 align:start position:0%
the 14th Amendment
 
00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:51.960 align:start position:0%
I think of the watersets method as
 
00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:53.340 align:start position:0%
affirmative action for foreign

affirmative action is also referred to
 
00:29:00.769 --> 00:29:00.779 align:start position:0%
as positive discrimination
 
00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
the watersets method is positive

on the other side of that same coin is

negative discrimination for our

homegrown U.S corporations
 
00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:14.820 align:start position:0%
it is discrimination pure and simple
 
00:29:17.029 --> 00:29:17.039 align:start position:0%
the U.S Supreme Court ruled earlier that
 
00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
that affirmative action in college

what would our founding fathers say
 
00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:25.260 align:start position:0%
about the state of New Hampshire one of

the original 13 British colonies that
 
00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:29.100 align:start position:0%

Britain's Parliament

00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
an American state that passed a law that
 
00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:44.940 align:start position:0%
granted preferential track preferential

tax treatment to a foreign corporations

to British French German corporations
 
00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:52.200 align:start position:0%

extra advantage in the U.S Marketplace
 
00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
competing against U.S corporations what
 
00:29:58.789 --> 00:29:58.799 align:start position:0%
would they say
 
00:30:01.370 --> 00:30:01.380 align:start position:0%
make known mistake multinational
 
00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:03.720 align:start position:0%
corporations of all Stripes work to
 
00:30:06.049 --> 00:30:06.059 align:start position:0%
avoid corporate income taxes they
 
00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:08.940 align:start position:0%
lobbied to lawyer to lower tax rates to
 
00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:10.740 align:start position:0%
change the approximate formula in their
 
00:30:14.389 --> 00:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
favor and above all reduce the tax base
 
00:30:16.909 --> 00:30:16.919 align:start position:0%
the tax base can be reduced to zero then
 
00:30:18.529 --> 00:30:18.539 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter what the tax rate is
 
00:30:21.769 --> 00:30:21.779 align:start position:0%
or what the apportionment formula is
 
00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
I'd be willing to bet that there are a
 
00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
number of foreign-based corporations
 
00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
that operate New Hampshire that have
 
00:30:29.269 --> 00:30:29.279 align:start position:0%
never paid any business profits tax
 
00:30:31.549 --> 00:30:31.559 align:start position:0%
the GAO the federal government's General
 
00:30:33.649 --> 00:30:33.659 align:start position:0%
accountability office has reported that
 
00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
over 70 percent of foreign controlled
 
00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:38.460 align:start position:0%
corporations corporations in the US have
 
00:30:41.330 --> 00:30:41.340 align:start position:0%
paid zero income taxes
 
00:30:43.549 --> 00:30:43.559 align:start position:0%
this is why a number of U.S based
 
00:30:45.409 --> 00:30:45.419 align:start position:0%
multinational corporations have moved to
 
00:30:48.289 --> 00:30:48.299 align:start position:0%
a foreign country and a tax inversion
 
00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:50.340 align:start position:0%
multinational corporations go to Great
 
00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:53.100 align:start position:0%
Lengths to avoid taxes
 
00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:55.140 align:start position:0%
the business profits tax playing field
 
00:30:57.110 --> 00:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
is not level
 
00:30:59.090 --> 00:30:59.100 align:start position:0%
the law has to change to make it level
 
00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:01.380 align:start position:0%
it has to be changed to move forward
 
00:31:03.889 --> 00:31:03.899 align:start position:0%
with unitary worldwide combined
 
00:31:05.810 --> 00:31:05.820 align:start position:0%
reporting for all corporations big and
 
00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:08.460 align:start position:0%
small U.S or Farm based
 
00:31:11.389 --> 00:31:11.399 align:start position:0%
or it has to move backwards to the way
 
00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:14.220 align:start position:0%
it was from 1970 to 1981 where
 
00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
corporations filed separate accounting
 
00:31:18.649 --> 00:31:18.659 align:start position:0%
separate entity tax returns and the arms
 
00:31:20.570 --> 00:31:20.580 align:start position:0%
length principle ruled over the unitary
 
00:31:22.669 --> 00:31:22.679 align:start position:0%
business principle
 
00:31:24.649 --> 00:31:24.659 align:start position:0%
big business would like that a full
 
00:31:27.649 --> 00:31:27.659 align:start position:0%
return to the arms length method if New
 
00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:29.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire did that it would be the most
 
00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
tax-friendly state in the entire country
 
00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:34.500 align:start position:0%
no general sales tax no income no earned
 
00:31:36.529 --> 00:31:36.539 align:start position:0%
income tax and the best possible
 
00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:38.340 align:start position:0%
corporate income tax
 
00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:40.380 align:start position:0%
the new and improved New Hampshire
 
00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:42.049 align:start position:0%
the new and improved New Hampshire
advantage

00:31:42.049 --> 00:31:42.059 align:start position:0%
advantage
 
00:31:43.970 --> 00:31:43.980 align:start position:0%
imagine being a clerk at the Vermont
 
00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:47.100 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue in the 1970s when
 
00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
Harry she opens a letter from the mole
 
00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
Oil Corporation and finds the check made
 
00:31:52.549 --> 00:31:52.559 align:start position:0%
out to the state of New Hampshire for 25
 
00:31:52.559 --> 00:31:53.690 align:start position:0%
out to the state of New Hampshire for 25
dollars

00:31:53.690 --> 00:31:53.700 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:31:55.789 --> 00:31:55.799 align:start position:0%
the initial reaction of that per person
 
00:31:57.529 --> 00:31:57.539 align:start position:0%
must be thinking that this is some kind
 
00:31:58.430 --> 00:31:58.440 align:start position:0%
of joke
 
00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
Mobile Oil has gas stations in Vermont
 
00:32:02.389 --> 00:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
and many states and is making hundreds
 
00:32:04.549 --> 00:32:04.559 align:start position:0%
of billions in corporate profits
 
00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
and yet here's a check for twenty five
 
00:32:09.049 --> 00:32:09.059 align:start position:0%
dollars from the oil company to help pay
 
00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:10.860 align:start position:0%
for Vermont's Public Schools public
 
00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:13.260 align:start position:0%
roads public health and many other
 
00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
functions that the Vermont government
 
00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:16.310 align:start position:0%
functions that the Vermont government
provides

00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
provides
 
00:32:18.289 --> 00:32:18.299 align:start position:0%
clerk enters the check into their system
 
00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
and sees that Mobile Oil also paid 25
 
00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
dollars in the previous year at that
 
00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:25.620 align:start position:0%
time Vermont had a minimum corporate
 
00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:28.380 align:start position:0%
income tax in 12 of 25 dollars and that
 
00:32:30.409 --> 00:32:30.419 align:start position:0%
is what Mobile Oil pay to Vermont for
 
00:32:32.389 --> 00:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
each of the two years
 
00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
the Vermont Department of Revenue
 
00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:35.640 align:start position:0%
conducted an audit
 
00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:38.220 align:start position:0%
plus another one 1970 and they found
 
00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:40.980 align:start position:0%
that that they should have paid over
 
00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:43.620 align:start position:0%
seventy six thousand dollars Vermont oil
 
00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
protested maintained the Vermont tax
 
00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:47.880 align:start position:0%
returns were correct and filed a lawsuit
 
00:32:49.370 --> 00:32:49.380 align:start position:0%
that went all the way up to the U.S
 
00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:50.940 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court
 
00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:52.860 align:start position:0%
the court records show that Mobile Oil
 
00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
had millions in Vermont sales and owned
 
00:32:57.710 --> 00:32:57.720 align:start position:0%
millions in Vermont property
 
00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:00.360 align:start position:0%
from Mobile Oil lost his case and it was
 
00:33:02.029 --> 00:33:02.039 align:start position:0%
in that decision where the court stated
 
00:33:04.669 --> 00:33:04.679 align:start position:0%
the linchpin of apportionability and the
 
00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:07.140 align:start position:0%
field of state income taxation is the
 
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
unitary business principle
 
00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:11.820 align:start position:0%
it is that principle that overrules the
 
00:33:14.210 --> 00:33:14.220 align:start position:0%
arm's length principle the arm's length
 
00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
principle allows multinational
 
00:33:18.049 --> 00:33:18.059 align:start position:0%
corporations to shift profits from one
 
00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:20.820 align:start position:0%
state or one country to another
 
00:33:22.789 --> 00:33:22.799 align:start position:0%
The Waters Edge method retains the
 
00:33:24.769 --> 00:33:24.779 align:start position:0%
arms-like principle but only for
 
00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:26.700 align:start position:0%
multinational corporations
 
00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:28.860 align:start position:0%
the worldwide method is the only way to
 
00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:32.100 align:start position:0%
overcome the arm's length method
 
00:33:34.190 --> 00:33:34.200 align:start position:0%
in my caterpillar brief I argued that
 
00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
the Commerce Clause has the bulldozer
 
00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:37.740 align:start position:0%
that can and should make the playing
 
00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
field level and then it is up to the New
 
00:33:41.509 --> 00:33:41.519 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court to decide
 
00:33:43.850 --> 00:33:43.860 align:start position:0%
whether or not that bulldozer will be
 
00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
fired up and operated to flatten down
 
00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
this terribly uneven unlevel and unjust
 
00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
playing field of Taxation in the global
 
00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:53.570 align:start position:0%
playing field of Taxation in the global
economy

00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:53.580 align:start position:0%
economy
 
00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:55.500 align:start position:0%
in hindsight I think I should have also
 
00:33:57.049 --> 00:33:57.059 align:start position:0%
ordered that the watersets method
 
00:33:59.149 --> 00:33:59.159 align:start position:0%
violates equal protection under the 14th
 
00:33:59.159 --> 00:34:00.350 align:start position:0%
violates equal protection under the 14th
Amendment

00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:00.360 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
00:34:02.029 --> 00:34:02.039 align:start position:0%
if the state of New Hampshire does not
 
00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:03.720 align:start position:0%
return to the worldwide method I can
 
00:34:06.049 --> 00:34:06.059 align:start position:0%
only hope that a lawsuit will occur to
 
00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:08.220 align:start position:0%
test the watersets method and find that
 
00:34:10.490 --> 00:34:10.500 align:start position:0%
it violates equal protection and or the
 
00:34:12.290 --> 00:34:12.300 align:start position:0%
Commerce Clause
 
00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
a lawsuit like the 1997 case against the
 
00:34:18.409 --> 00:34:18.419 align:start position:0%
state's interest in dividends tax
 
00:34:20.450 --> 00:34:20.460 align:start position:0%
Ernest Smith was a lead plaintiff in a
 
00:34:22.849 --> 00:34:22.859 align:start position:0%
successful lawsuit against the 70 year
 
00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
old tax
 
00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:26.820 align:start position:0%
his Loyals his lawyers argued that the
 
00:34:29.389 --> 00:34:29.399 align:start position:0%
IND tax was flawed and violated the
 
00:34:32.149 --> 00:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
Commerce Clause and equal protection
 
00:34:34.669 --> 00:34:34.679 align:start position:0%
for the Court's decision prior to oil
 
00:34:36.349 --> 00:34:36.359 align:start position:0%
argument before this court the state
 
00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
withdrew its Commerce Clause defenses
 
00:34:40.430 --> 00:34:40.440 align:start position:0%
based upon the U.S Supreme Court's
 
00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:42.540 align:start position:0%
recent decision and Fulton Court fee
 
00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:45.060 align:start position:0%

the New Hampshire Supreme Court decided

Smith case on just the Commerce Clause
 
00:34:56.210 --> 00:34:56.220 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it did not rule on the
 
00:34:58.730 --> 00:34:58.740 align:start position:0%
equal protection argument
 
00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:00.540 align:start position:0%
finally I would like to quote Adam
 
00:35:02.450 --> 00:35:02.460 align:start position:0%
Looney at Dartmouth grad and former
 
00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:04.680 align:start position:0%

Department
 
00:35:10.069 --> 00:35:10.079 align:start position:0%
he said that in effect the United States
 
00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:13.740 align:start position:0%
is paying foreign investors to take over
 
00:35:15.890 --> 00:35:15.900 align:start position:0%
our own companies with our own tax
 
00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:17.569 align:start position:0%
our own companies with our own tax
dollars

00:35:17.569 --> 00:35:17.579 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much gentlemen are there
 
00:35:26.530 --> 00:35:26.540 align:start position:0%
questions representative Hillary welcome
 
00:35:29.089 --> 00:35:29.099 align:start position:0%
thank you excuse me for walking in a few
 
00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
minutes late but
 
00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:34.550 align:start position:0%
minutes late but
um

00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
for this the uh the lobbyist to answer
 
00:35:39.349 --> 00:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
for both of you could New Hampshire has
 
00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
a unique system where the business
 
00:35:44.329 --> 00:35:44.339 align:start position:0%
profits tax and the business Enterprise
 
00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
tax work together and offset each other
 
00:35:49.970 --> 00:35:49.980 align:start position:0%
under Supreme Court rule
 
00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
I really don't understand how what has
 
00:35:56.089 --> 00:35:56.099 align:start position:0%
been suggested thus far applies in New
 
00:35:56.099 --> 00:35:57.950 align:start position:0%
been suggested thus far applies in New
Hampshire

00:35:57.950 --> 00:35:57.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
um so regarding Equitable treatment
 
00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:03.300 align:start position:0%
because every
 
00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:06.540 align:start position:0%
entity and every business entity is
 
00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
required to pay the business Enterprise
 
00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:12.780 align:start position:0%
tax and then that tax is offset against
 
00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
the profit tax of every entity and under
 
00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
our rules or under our constitution
 
00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
each class is taxed the same each class
 
00:36:26.930 --> 00:36:26.940 align:start position:0%
of entity is taxed the same
 
00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
even though they can have several
 
00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:31.500 align:start position:0%
different classes within a one appearing
 
00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:33.720 align:start position:0%
to be this a similar group
 
00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:35.270 align:start position:0%
to be this a similar group
so

00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:36.950 align:start position:0%
so
where

00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:39.170 align:start position:0%
where
just

00:36:39.170 --> 00:36:39.180 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:36:40.849 --> 00:36:40.859 align:start position:0%
can you
 
00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
address that for me please
 
00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
well sir I I'm not the the tax expert
 
00:36:49.609 --> 00:36:49.619 align:start position:0%
but fundamentally under the current law
 
00:36:50.990 --> 00:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
00:36:54.410 --> 00:36:54.420 align:start position:0%
we do not consider activities beyond the
 
00:36:57.109 --> 00:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
water's edge Beyond U.S boundaries
 
00:37:00.410 --> 00:37:00.420 align:start position:0%
in any case for either for the BPT or
 
00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:02.220 align:start position:0%
the Enterprise tax we simply do not
 
00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
consider activities so that if you're as
 
00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
Mr Garr pointed out if you're a
 
00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
multinational or a foreign owned company
 
00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
um you have the ability again perfectly
 
00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
legal but uh putting New Hampshire
 
00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
businesses at a competitive disadvantage
 
00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
essentially you have the ability to
 
00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:24.050 align:start position:0%
essentially you have the ability to
shift

00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:24.060 align:start position:0%
shift
 
00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
uh your profits around
 
00:37:29.470 --> 00:37:29.480 align:start position:0%
through accounting techniques or or
 
00:37:31.870 --> 00:37:31.880 align:start position:0%
other tactics
 
00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
that enable you to reduce your liability
 
00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
to the state of New Hampshire and the
 
00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire does not have the
 
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:39.910 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire does not have the
ability

00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
ability
 
00:37:44.450 --> 00:37:44.460 align:start position:0%
to audit activities overseas there's no
 
00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:49.190 align:start position:0%
to audit activities overseas there's no
reporting

00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:51.829 --> 00:37:51.839 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead
 
00:37:53.810 --> 00:37:53.820 align:start position:0%
taking a very large company in New
 
00:37:55.609 --> 00:37:55.619 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I think it's number one or
 
00:37:58.550 --> 00:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:00.650 --> 00:38:00.660 align:start position:0%
what do we care
 
00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:06.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:09.890 --> 00:38:09.900 align:start position:0%
what we care about Sir is having a Level
 
00:38:12.589 --> 00:38:12.599 align:start position:0%
Playing Field so that a New Hampshire
 
00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
business a hardware store for example
 
00:38:18.050 --> 00:38:18.060 align:start position:0%
um an independent bookstore competing
 
00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:20.820 align:start position:0%
against Amazon a Craft brewery competing
 
00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:22.680 align:start position:0%
against Anheuser-Busch
 
00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
they are paying
 
00:38:28.609 --> 00:38:28.619 align:start position:0%
their full tax liability they report a
 
00:38:30.910 --> 00:38:30.920 align:start position:0%
hundred percent of their sales
 
00:38:33.890 --> 00:38:33.900 align:start position:0%
uh and then pay a hundred percent of
 
00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
their tax liability based on that sales
 
00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:39.780 align:start position:0%
a multinational corporation
 
00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:43.800 align:start position:0%
may or may not be reporting a hundred
 
00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:45.480 align:start position:0%
percent of their sales activity in New
 
00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:46.630 align:start position:0%
percent of their sales activity in New
Hampshire

00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:46.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:38:49.370 --> 00:38:49.380 align:start position:0%
they certainly have the ability through
 
00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
accounting techniques
 
00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
to shift what would rightfully be sales
 
00:38:56.990 --> 00:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
activity in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:38:59.630 --> 00:38:59.640 align:start position:0%
to other jurisdictions
 
00:39:02.210 --> 00:39:02.220 align:start position:0%
and thereby reduce their tax liability
 
00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:04.200 align:start position:0%
and what that means is
 
00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
that a New Hampshire company is paying
 
00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
100 of its tax liability
 
00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
foreign owned companies or
 
00:39:11.930 --> 00:39:11.940 align:start position:0%
multinationals are paying less
 
00:39:14.690 --> 00:39:14.700 align:start position:0%
potentially paying less than 100 percent
 
00:39:17.089 --> 00:39:17.099 align:start position:0%
that's creating a competitive
 
00:39:17.099 --> 00:39:19.089 align:start position:0%
that's creating a competitive
disadvantage

00:39:19.089 --> 00:39:19.099 align:start position:0%
disadvantage
 
00:39:23.569 --> 00:39:23.579 align:start position:0%
it's you know as as Mr Garr pointed out
 
00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
it's not just unfair it frankly should
 
00:39:31.730 --> 00:39:31.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:37.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:38.329 --> 00:39:38.339 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you for your
 
00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:42.180 align:start position:0%
testimony uh this is a first question if
 
00:39:45.829 --> 00:39:45.839 align:start position:0%
if um if I may uh in your testimony you
 
00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned this
 
00:39:50.930 --> 00:39:50.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
study this 2019 January 2019 joint study
 
00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
by the American sustainable Business
 
00:39:58.550 --> 00:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
Council I'm not sure if if the com
 
00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
commission received the um has a copy of
 
00:40:04.490 --> 00:40:04.500 align:start position:0%
that study and I'm and I'm sorry my uh
 
00:40:07.310 --> 00:40:07.320 align:start position:0%
my personal printer quit on me last
 
00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:10.200 align:start position:0%
night after I was printing out a bunch
 
00:40:12.349 --> 00:40:12.359 align:start position:0%
of our the testimony
 
00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
um I did email a copy of that study to
 
00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
Jennifer okay this morning so the com
 
00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
the commission will have access to it
 
00:40:21.770 --> 00:40:21.780 align:start position:0%
and again I apologize for not having it
 
00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:23.960 align:start position:0%
in advance that's fine thank you
 
00:40:27.290 --> 00:40:27.300 align:start position:0%
my my second question is that you you
 
00:40:29.329 --> 00:40:29.339 align:start position:0%
mentioned just now that uh potentially
 
00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
the multinational corporations could
 
00:40:33.109 --> 00:40:33.119 align:start position:0%
potentially shift
 
00:40:35.150 --> 00:40:35.160 align:start position:0%
their U.S up sorry the New Hampshire
 
00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
sales activity to outside of New
 
00:40:40.310 --> 00:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can you just explain further
 
00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:41.329 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can you just explain further
on

00:40:41.329 --> 00:40:41.339 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
potentially how that mechanism is
 
00:40:45.589 --> 00:40:45.599 align:start position:0%
Shifting sales that's in New Hampshire
 
00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
how's that shifted outside of New
 
00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:49.730 align:start position:0%
how's that shifted outside of New
Hampshire

00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:49.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:52.250 --> 00:40:52.260 align:start position:0%
um sure uh let me give you an example of
 
00:40:54.650 --> 00:40:54.660 align:start position:0%
a of a pharmaceutical company
 
00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:55.569 align:start position:0%
a of a pharmaceutical company
um

00:40:55.569 --> 00:40:55.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:58.190 --> 00:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
uh pharmaceutical companies do a lot of
 
00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:01.380 align:start position:0%
research in the U.S and they you know
 
00:41:03.770 --> 00:41:03.780 align:start position:0%
we've all seen the the advert you know
 
00:41:06.589 --> 00:41:06.599 align:start position:0%
advertisements for Jordans and various
 
00:41:09.829 --> 00:41:09.839 align:start position:0%
and Sundry other uh you know medicines
 
00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
for diabetes or or you know rheumatoid
 
00:41:16.190 --> 00:41:16.200 align:start position:0%
arthritis Etc
 
00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:17.089 align:start position:0%
arthritis Etc
um

00:41:17.089 --> 00:41:17.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:21.480 align:start position:0%
what has happened uh in the past
 
00:41:24.109 --> 00:41:24.119 align:start position:0%
um is prescriptions get written in New
 
00:41:26.270 --> 00:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for one of those medications
 
00:41:28.849 --> 00:41:28.859 align:start position:0%
and that achieves obviously a certain
 
00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
sales level
 
00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
um but what happens is the
 
00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:33.960 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical company transfers the
 
00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:35.089 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical company transfers the
patent

00:41:35.089 --> 00:41:35.099 align:start position:0%
patent
 
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
for that medicine
 
00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:39.720 align:start position:0%
to a subsidiary or
 
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
a a another company
 
00:41:45.829 --> 00:41:45.839 align:start position:0%
in a lower tax jurisdiction the Cayman
 
00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
Islands Ireland wherever
 
00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:50.089 align:start position:0%
Islands Ireland wherever
um

00:41:50.089 --> 00:41:50.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
and what happens is that
 
00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:54.720 align:start position:0%
the pharmaceutical company represents
 
00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
let's say
 
00:41:59.870 --> 00:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
a million dollars in sales of a medicine
 
00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
00:42:05.329 --> 00:42:05.339 align:start position:0%
but is required to pay a licensing fee
 
00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:08.220 align:start position:0%
to the Cayman Islands subsidiary and
 
00:42:10.849 --> 00:42:10.859 align:start position:0%
that licensing fee significantly reduces
 
00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
that company's profits
 
00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
as as reflected based on New Hampshire
 
00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:18.650 align:start position:0%
as as reflected based on New Hampshire
sales

00:42:18.650 --> 00:42:18.660 align:start position:0%
sales
 
00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:30.349 --> 00:42:30.359 align:start position:0%
um thank you I believe
 
00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
the the New Hampshire sales most likely
 
00:42:35.089 --> 00:42:35.099 align:start position:0%
it would still remain as the amount of
 
00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
gross sales in New Hampshire probably
 
00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:39.300 align:start position:0%
what's being I think what you're
 
00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:41.160 align:start position:0%
mentioning is what's being moved outside
 
00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:45.540 align:start position:0%
is just the shifting of the profits of
 
00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
the company in general as opposed to the
 
00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:49.140 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire sales I think New
 
00:42:50.450 --> 00:42:50.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire sales will still remain as New
 
00:42:53.950 --> 00:42:53.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:56.569 --> 00:42:56.579 align:start position:0%
except that it's my understanding and
 
00:42:58.190 --> 00:42:58.200 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong it's my
 
00:42:59.630 --> 00:42:59.640 align:start position:0%
understanding that
 
00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:02.460 align:start position:0%
a a foreign company multinational
 
00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
company is under no obligation
 
00:43:07.010 --> 00:43:07.020 align:start position:0%
uh to provide the same kind of reporting
 
00:43:10.010 --> 00:43:10.020 align:start position:0%
that U.S based companies have to provide
 
00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
we have combined reporting within the
 
00:43:15.589 --> 00:43:15.599 align:start position:0%
U.S so that if if I'm a company that
 
00:43:17.210 --> 00:43:17.220 align:start position:0%
does business in New Hampshire and the
 
00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
other 50 states I have to report to dra
 
00:43:22.609 --> 00:43:22.619 align:start position:0%
what I'm doing not just in New Hampshire
 
00:43:24.589 --> 00:43:24.599 align:start position:0%
what activities what sales activities I
 
00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:26.220 align:start position:0%
have in New Hampshire but in the other
 
00:43:29.809 --> 00:43:29.819 align:start position:0%
49 states I do not have to do that
 
00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
for activities beyond the water's edge
 
00:43:35.950 --> 00:43:35.960 align:start position:0%
which enables a company to
 
00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
use all sorts of accounting techniques
 
00:43:40.609 --> 00:43:40.619 align:start position:0%
to reduce their liability in the end
 
00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
it's the tax liability it's not so much
 
00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:50.329 --> 00:43:50.339 align:start position:0%
yes Senator Murphy
 
00:43:51.770 --> 00:43:51.780 align:start position:0%
thanks chairman
 
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
I'm holding in my hands that testimony
 
00:43:57.109 --> 00:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
from the global business Alliance little
 
00:44:00.410 --> 00:44:00.420 align:start position:0%
prepaid handout if I could sum up what's
 
00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
in front of me what it says basically is
 
00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:04.680 align:start position:0%
this would be new this is the only we'd
 
00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:06.720 align:start position:0%
be the only state that does this every
 
00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
state that even
 
00:44:10.849 --> 00:44:10.859 align:start position:0%
allows for it it's only an option
 
00:44:13.309 --> 00:44:13.319 align:start position:0%
each allows for a Water's Edge Edge
 
00:44:13.319 --> 00:44:14.510 align:start position:0%
each allows for a Water's Edge Edge
designation

00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
designation
 
00:44:16.250 --> 00:44:16.260 align:start position:0%
and every state that studied it has said
 
00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:18.410 align:start position:0%
and every state that studied it has said
no

00:44:18.410 --> 00:44:18.420 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:44:20.329 --> 00:44:20.339 align:start position:0%
and states don't like to be outliers we
 
00:44:22.190 --> 00:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
don't like to be first and what I'm
 
00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
hearing now I'm reading in the testimony
 
00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
is this would actually be going back to
 
00:44:28.010 --> 00:44:28.020 align:start position:0%
a prior policy so
 
00:44:30.050 --> 00:44:30.060 align:start position:0%
what would your answer be to the global
 
00:44:32.270 --> 00:44:32.280 align:start position:0%
business Alliance
 
00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:33.410 align:start position:0%
business Alliance
please

00:44:33.410 --> 00:44:33.420 align:start position:0%
please
 
00:44:36.109 --> 00:44:36.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is an outlier State we
 
00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:38.700 align:start position:0%
have no personal earned income
 
00:44:43.150 --> 00:44:43.160 align:start position:0%
tax we have no general sales tax
 
00:44:46.010 --> 00:44:46.020 align:start position:0%
the only other state that's comparable I
 
00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
believe is Alaska
 
00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
but of course they are rich and
 
00:44:53.930 --> 00:44:53.940 align:start position:0%
energy resources
 
00:44:56.930 --> 00:44:56.940 align:start position:0%
so we're already there as an outlier we
 
00:44:58.849 --> 00:44:58.859 align:start position:0%
have the New Hampshire Advantage we're
 
00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
supposedly famous for it
 
00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:03.349 align:start position:0%
supposedly famous for it
so

00:45:03.349 --> 00:45:03.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:45:03.359 --> 00:45:06.950 align:start position:0%
so
I've

00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:08.809 --> 00:45:08.819 align:start position:0%
funding a government has to come from
 
00:45:08.819 --> 00:45:11.930 align:start position:0%
funding a government has to come from
somewhere

00:45:11.930 --> 00:45:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:13.970 --> 00:45:13.980 align:start position:0%
if if we want to be the most business
 
00:45:16.970 --> 00:45:16.980 align:start position:0%
friendly state in the country
 
00:45:19.990 --> 00:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
then go back to the way it was between
 
00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
1970 and 1981 when New Hampshire was a
 
00:45:24.829 --> 00:45:24.839 align:start position:0%
separate accounting separate entity
 
00:45:24.839 --> 00:45:27.170 align:start position:0%
separate accounting separate entity
state

00:45:27.170 --> 00:45:27.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:30.349 --> 00:45:30.359 align:start position:0%
revenues will drop and whoever wants a
 
00:45:32.270 --> 00:45:32.280 align:start position:0%
general sales tax in this state whoever
 
00:45:35.390 --> 00:45:35.400 align:start position:0%
wants a personal income tax or an income
 
00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
tax they will have their time they'll
 
00:45:40.010 --> 00:45:40.020 align:start position:0%
have their chance because BBT revenues
 
00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:42.180 align:start position:0%
are going to drop like a
 
00:45:47.390 --> 00:45:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:49.069 --> 00:45:49.079 align:start position:0%
let me just say we're not advocating
 
00:45:51.910 --> 00:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
that but um
 
00:45:54.170 --> 00:45:54.180 align:start position:0%
let me also point out that New Hampshire
 
00:45:56.510 --> 00:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
was an outlier in 1963 when we were the
 
00:45:59.329 --> 00:45:59.339 align:start position:0%
first state to adopt a state lottery
 
00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
um so we've we've done things I I think
 
00:46:04.550 --> 00:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
the answer is pretty unique in a lot of
 
00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:05.940 align:start position:0%
different ways and we've done things in
 
00:46:08.450 --> 00:46:08.460 align:start position:0%
the past I'll also say that
 
00:46:10.370 --> 00:46:10.380 align:start position:0%
there are a number of other states that
 
00:46:12.170 --> 00:46:12.180 align:start position:0%
have looked at worldwide combined
 
00:46:15.730 --> 00:46:15.740 align:start position:0%
reporting and ending the water's edge
 
00:46:18.490 --> 00:46:18.500 align:start position:0%
and very honestly senator
 
00:46:21.970 --> 00:46:21.980 align:start position:0%
it's tough to compete with the money
 
00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:24.540 align:start position:0%
that big multinational corporations
 
00:46:27.770 --> 00:46:27.780 align:start position:0%
bring to these uh bring to these
 
00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:29.390 align:start position:0%
bring to these uh bring to these
campaigns

00:46:29.390 --> 00:46:29.400 align:start position:0%
campaigns
 
00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:31.800 align:start position:0%
um the folks the folks who are looking
 
00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
for equity
 
00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
folks who are looking for a Level
 
00:46:35.809 --> 00:46:35.819 align:start position:0%
Playing Field
 
00:46:38.290 --> 00:46:38.300 align:start position:0%
can't compete financially
 
00:46:43.490 --> 00:46:43.500 align:start position:0%
with Exxon with Anheuser-Busch with Home
 
00:46:45.490 --> 00:46:45.500 align:start position:0%
Depot with Amazon
 
00:46:48.670 --> 00:46:48.680 align:start position:0%
I know in Oregon for example
 
00:46:53.390 --> 00:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
Nike spent a lot of money to defeat this
 
00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
proposal which came pretty close to
 
00:46:59.510 --> 00:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
passing in the Oregon legislature until
 
00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:01.370 align:start position:0%
passing in the Oregon legislature until
um

00:47:01.370 --> 00:47:01.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:03.710 --> 00:47:03.720 align:start position:0%
until Nike weighed in let's just say
 
00:47:06.430 --> 00:47:06.440 align:start position:0%
that I know the state of Minnesota
 
00:47:10.309 --> 00:47:10.319 align:start position:0%
just this past year looked just a few
 
00:47:12.890 --> 00:47:12.900 align:start position:0%
months ago actually came again very very
 
00:47:15.069 --> 00:47:15.079 align:start position:0%
close to passing this
 
00:47:17.569 --> 00:47:17.579 align:start position:0%
until there was some significant
 
00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
activity by the multinationals toward
 
00:47:23.410 --> 00:47:23.420 align:start position:0%
the end of that legislative session
 
00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
so again it's you know there I'm not
 
00:47:30.530 --> 00:47:30.540 align:start position:0%
suggesting anybody acted outside the law
 
00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
they didn't
 
00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:32.750 align:start position:0%
they didn't
um

00:47:32.750 --> 00:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:39.069 align:start position:0%
 
ERS

00:47:39.069 --> 00:47:39.079 align:start position:0%
ERS
 
00:47:40.970 --> 00:47:40.980 align:start position:0%
hopefully this will be the last question
 
00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:46.069 --> 00:47:46.079 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is adopted a single sales
 
00:47:46.079 --> 00:47:47.569 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is adopted a single sales
Factor

00:47:47.569 --> 00:47:47.579 align:start position:0%
Factor
 
00:47:47.579 --> 00:47:49.730 align:start position:0%
Factor
uh

00:47:49.730 --> 00:47:49.740 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:47:51.650 --> 00:47:51.660 align:start position:0%
without any
 
00:47:54.650 --> 00:47:54.660 align:start position:0%
study being done beforehand or
 
00:47:57.710 --> 00:47:57.720 align:start position:0%
comparison study before it was adopted
 
00:47:59.809 --> 00:47:59.819 align:start position:0%
with the proportionality approach that
 
00:48:01.069 --> 00:48:01.079 align:start position:0%
we used
 
00:48:05.150 --> 00:48:05.160 align:start position:0%
what in your opinion
 
00:48:07.250 --> 00:48:07.260 align:start position:0%
would be the effect of a single sales
 
00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:09.480 align:start position:0%
Factor now being used have on the
 
00:48:11.210 --> 00:48:11.220 align:start position:0%
possible revenues for the State of New
 
00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:15.950 align:start position:0%
possible revenues for the State of New
Hampshire

00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:18.770 --> 00:48:18.780 align:start position:0%
I think it's going to be a disaster
 
00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
where a population of
 
00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
1.3 million people
 
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:25.609 align:start position:0%
1.3 million people
so

00:48:25.609 --> 00:48:25.619 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:48:29.210 --> 00:48:29.220 align:start position:0%
how big can the sales Factor be
 
00:48:31.550 --> 00:48:31.560 align:start position:0%
and only the sales Factor
 
00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:32.870 align:start position:0%
and only the sales Factor
of

00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
items that are sold services that are
 
00:48:37.130 --> 00:48:37.140 align:start position:0%
sold in New Hampshire
 
00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:39.660 align:start position:0%
without recognition of payroll and
 
00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:41.030 align:start position:0%
without recognition of payroll and
property

00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
property
 
00:48:44.390 --> 00:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
the corporations that have big plants
 
00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
employ a lot of people
 
00:48:48.650 --> 00:48:48.660 align:start position:0%
use our roads
 
00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
you lose the let the rational
 
00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
relationship between sales payment
 
00:48:55.490 --> 00:48:55.500 align:start position:0%
property and the activity that's taking
 
00:48:56.930 --> 00:48:56.940 align:start position:0%
place in this state
 
00:48:58.849 --> 00:48:58.859 align:start position:0%
you're moving you're moving away from
 
00:49:02.329 --> 00:49:02.339 align:start position:0%
that relationship going to a pure single
 
00:49:04.309 --> 00:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
sales factor I think it's a terrible
 
00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
mistake and I think revenues are going
 
00:49:09.609 --> 00:49:09.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:12.890 --> 00:49:12.900 align:start position:0%
thank you I have three very brief
 
00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
clarifying questions
 
00:49:16.609 --> 00:49:16.619 align:start position:0%
um first it's my understanding that
 
00:49:18.349 --> 00:49:18.359 align:start position:0%
you're not advocating going back to what
 
00:49:20.690 --> 00:49:20.700 align:start position:0%
prevailed from 1970 to 81 but rather
 
00:49:23.089 --> 00:49:23.099 align:start position:0%
what prevailed from 81 to 86. that is
 
00:49:24.490 --> 00:49:24.500 align:start position:0%
correct correct sir
 
00:49:26.809 --> 00:49:26.819 align:start position:0%
second is my understanding that the
 
00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
report that you forwarded this morning
 
00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
which we'll see is the one that
 
00:49:35.210 --> 00:49:35.220 align:start position:0%
establishes the claim of 177 million
 
00:49:36.970 --> 00:49:36.980 align:start position:0%
dollars of lost Revenue
 
00:49:39.589 --> 00:49:39.599 align:start position:0%
and uh in contrast to the way it's
 
00:49:41.450 --> 00:49:41.460 align:start position:0%
written in the testimony I believe
 
00:49:43.130 --> 00:49:43.140 align:start position:0%
you're saying that that's the impact on
 
00:49:44.690 --> 00:49:44.700 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire alone
 
00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
the the report which is called the the
 
00:49:50.930 --> 00:49:50.940 align:start position:0%
title of which is a simple fix
 
00:49:53.870 --> 00:49:53.880 align:start position:0%
um looked uh nationally looked across
 
00:49:56.270 --> 00:49:56.280 align:start position:0%
you know every state and so there is a
 
00:49:59.089 --> 00:49:59.099 align:start position:0%
chart in there that identifies the
 
00:50:01.730 --> 00:50:01.740 align:start position:0%
potential loss in Revenue to every state
 
00:50:04.309 --> 00:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
because of Water's Edge Provisions so
 
00:50:06.829 --> 00:50:06.839 align:start position:0%
it's describing 177 million dollars to
 
00:50:09.950 --> 00:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire citizens yes sir in the
 
00:50:12.290 --> 00:50:12.300 align:start position:0%
chart you'll see New Hampshire and 177
 
00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:14.640 align:start position:0%
million ascribed as the estimated impact
 
00:50:18.589 --> 00:50:18.599 align:start position:0%
okay and third it's my understanding
 
00:50:21.290 --> 00:50:21.300 align:start position:0%
that you're not
 
00:50:25.270 --> 00:50:25.280 align:start position:0%
picking who the villain is here between
 
00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:28.680 align:start position:0%
us-based multinationals and Forest
 
00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:30.540 align:start position:0%
foreign-based multinationals doing
 
00:50:33.349 --> 00:50:33.359 align:start position:0%
business here they are equally a problem
 
00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:35.160 align:start position:0%
in the way you've described the issue am
 
00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
I correct that's correct you know any
 
00:50:40.430 --> 00:50:40.440 align:start position:0%
any multinational corporation regardless
 
00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
of where it's based
 
00:50:45.410 --> 00:50:45.420 align:start position:0%
has this accounting ability
 
00:50:49.670 --> 00:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
um and and again the lack of uh required
 
00:50:52.250 --> 00:50:52.260 align:start position:0%
reporting that would give New Hampshire
 
00:50:55.390 --> 00:50:55.400 align:start position:0%
dra for example the ability to audit
 
00:50:58.430 --> 00:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
globally their activities and compare
 
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
them to what they do in New Hampshire as
 
00:51:03.109 --> 00:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
opposed to the way they do it today
 
00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:05.640 align:start position:0%
which is we can you know we can audit
 
00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:06.730 align:start position:0%
which is we can you know we can audit
activities

00:51:06.730 --> 00:51:06.740 align:start position:0%
activities
 
00:51:10.309 --> 00:51:10.319 align:start position:0%
in other states we simply can't
 
00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
you know have any any International
 
00:51:16.130 --> 00:51:16.140 align:start position:0%
aspect yes it's the international aspect
 
00:51:18.049 --> 00:51:18.059 align:start position:0%
completely yes sir okay
 
00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much and Mr Garr
 
00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
thanks for the extensive history which I
 
00:51:25.069 --> 00:51:25.079 align:start position:0%
found very helpful
 
00:51:26.990 --> 00:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:51:30.049 --> 00:51:30.059 align:start position:0%
we'll dismiss this panel and before we
 
00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
go on I just want to say of course we've
 
00:51:34.370 --> 00:51:34.380 align:start position:0%
run well over the time allotted don't
 
00:51:37.790 --> 00:51:37.800 align:start position:0%
fret I'm aware we might shorten our
 
00:51:39.890 --> 00:51:39.900 align:start position:0%
lunch break and we'll just see how it
 
00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
Paces along
 
00:51:45.530 --> 00:51:45.540 align:start position:0%
um so thank you gentlemen thank you
 
00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:46.790 align:start position:0%
um so thank you gentlemen thank you
so

00:51:46.790 --> 00:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:48.650 align:start position:0%
so
yes

00:51:48.650 --> 00:51:48.660 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:51:50.569 --> 00:51:50.579 align:start position:0%
uh before we go to the the next speaker
 
00:51:53.809 --> 00:51:53.819 align:start position:0%
uh allegation was uh or a statement was
 
00:51:56.690 --> 00:51:56.700 align:start position:0%
made that uh uh raised a question in my
 
00:51:58.190 --> 00:51:58.200 align:start position:0%
mind regarding
 
00:52:01.370 --> 00:52:01.380 align:start position:0%
how businesses are report and dra is
 
00:52:04.250 --> 00:52:04.260 align:start position:0%
here and I was hoping that uh we could
 
00:52:05.690 --> 00:52:05.700 align:start position:0%
probably get
 
00:52:08.450 --> 00:52:08.460 align:start position:0%
so the dra will testify at the end of
 
00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
the line and I just
 
00:52:14.170 --> 00:52:14.180 align:start position:0%
um a quick insight
 
00:52:17.829 --> 00:52:17.839 align:start position:0%
the plan for this progression
 
00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
anticipated that we would lead off as we
 
00:52:23.950 --> 00:52:23.960 align:start position:0%
just have with some new hampshire-based
 
00:52:26.569 --> 00:52:26.579 align:start position:0%
businesses who are advocates for this
 
00:52:26.579 --> 00:52:27.770 align:start position:0%
businesses who are advocates for this
proposal

00:52:27.770 --> 00:52:27.780 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
00:52:29.930 --> 00:52:29.940 align:start position:0%
and we're going to go through a variety
 
00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
of different uh spokesmen and
 
00:52:36.290 --> 00:52:36.300 align:start position:0%
perspectives including practitioners and
 
00:52:39.650 --> 00:52:39.660 align:start position:0%
academic but we are going to conclude
 
00:52:41.809 --> 00:52:41.819 align:start position:0%
with the dra and that's very much with
 
00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:44.640 align:start position:0%
the idea that we end up on a practical
 
00:52:47.510 --> 00:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
note in terms of what the actual hurdles
 
00:52:49.970 --> 00:52:49.980 align:start position:0%
of implementation audit and enforcement
 
00:52:54.650 --> 00:52:54.660 align:start position:0%
will be okay so there's a method
 
00:52:58.069 --> 00:52:58.079 align:start position:0%
um so I'd like to uh welcome Meredith

concerns with mandatory worldwide
 
00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
combined reporting that you all have
 
00:53:46.309 --> 00:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
been tasked with studying thank you for

the opportunity to share a perspective
 
00:53:50.150 --> 00:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
on the negative impacts that a mandatory
 
00:53:52.730 --> 00:53:52.740 align:start position:0%
tax policy such as this would have on
 
00:53:53.930 --> 00:53:53.940 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:53:56.569 --> 00:53:56.579 align:start position:0%

are allied with the United States and in

fact among all International employers
 
00:54:11.329 --> 00:54:11.339 align:start position:0%

largest number of jobs
 
00:54:15.540 --> 00:54:16.670 align:start position:0%
largest number of jobs
here

00:54:16.670 --> 00:54:16.680 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:54:19.730 --> 00:54:19.740 align:start position:0%
the mission of GBA is to defend and
 
00:54:21.770 --> 00:54:21.780 align:start position:0%
promote an open economy that welcomes
 
00:54:23.390 --> 00:54:23.400 align:start position:0%
International companies to invest in
 
00:54:25.970 --> 00:54:25.980 align:start position:0%
America our members help grow New
 
00:54:27.770 --> 00:54:27.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's economy and provide high
 
00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
quality jobs in local communities across
 
00:54:33.890 --> 00:54:33.900 align:start position:0%
the state in fact on average U.S workers
 
00:54:36.049 --> 00:54:36.059 align:start position:0%
at International companies earn seven
 
00:54:37.910 --> 00:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
percent more than the economy-wide
 
00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
average over 50 000 people in New
 
00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:42.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are employed by International
 
00:54:45.170 --> 00:54:45.180 align:start position:0%
companies and almost half of those jobs
 
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
are in the manufacturing sector and
 
00:54:49.130 --> 00:54:49.140 align:start position:0%
another great statistic is that
 
00:54:50.930 --> 00:54:50.940 align:start position:0%
employment from foreign direct
 
00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
investment or FDI has increased by 22
 
00:54:56.390 --> 00:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
percent in the state while the state's
 
00:54:58.970 --> 00:54:58.980 align:start position:0%
overall private sector employment has
 
00:55:01.549 --> 00:55:01.559 align:start position:0%
sadly decreased by one
 
00:55:04.910 --> 00:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
it is clear that International companies
 
00:55:07.190 --> 00:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
are a vital part in creating a resilient
 
00:55:09.890 --> 00:55:09.900 align:start position:0%
economy economy but our members also
 
00:55:12.770 --> 00:55:12.780 align:start position:0%
rely heavily on small businesses across
 
00:55:14.329 --> 00:55:14.339 align:start position:0%
the state that provide essential
 
00:55:17.450 --> 00:55:17.460 align:start position:0%
Services equipment and products I
 
00:55:19.190 --> 00:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
submitted a fact sheet for you all to
 
00:55:20.210 --> 00:55:20.220 align:start position:0%
learn more about our members
 
00:55:23.030 --> 00:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
contributions to the state so let's now
 
00:55:25.190 --> 00:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
talk about mandatory worldwide combined
 
00:55:27.710 --> 00:55:27.720 align:start position:0%
reporting no other state in the Union
 
00:55:29.630 --> 00:55:29.640 align:start position:0%
has taken this approach
 
00:55:32.390 --> 00:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
making a single tax approach mandatory
 
00:55:34.730 --> 00:55:34.740 align:start position:0%
like worldwide reporting can cause a lot
 
00:55:37.130 --> 00:55:37.140 align:start position:0%
of volatility volatility and shifts in
 
00:55:39.770 --> 00:55:39.780 align:start position:0%
Revenue about half of states have
 
00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
adopted some form of what is called
 
00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
combined reporting however again none
 
00:55:46.549 --> 00:55:46.559 align:start position:0%
have imposed mandatory worldwide
 
00:55:48.349 --> 00:55:48.359 align:start position:0%
combined reporting
 
00:55:50.809 --> 00:55:50.819 align:start position:0%
in our work here in New Hampshire and in
 
00:55:52.069 --> 00:55:52.079 align:start position:0%
other states that have looked at this
 
00:55:54.049 --> 00:55:54.059 align:start position:0%
mandatory worldwide approach we've
 
00:55:55.309 --> 00:55:55.319 align:start position:0%
actually heard from some of our
 
00:55:57.530 --> 00:55:57.540 align:start position:0%
companies that their liability would
 
00:55:59.630 --> 00:55:59.640 align:start position:0%
decrease leaving the state with less
 
00:56:02.270 --> 00:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
revenue and more volatility but more on
 
00:56:03.530 --> 00:56:03.540 align:start position:0%
that in a bit
 
00:56:05.750 --> 00:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
states that have considered this tax
 
00:56:07.549 --> 00:56:07.559 align:start position:0%
policy have decided against it for a
 
00:56:09.530 --> 00:56:09.540 align:start position:0%
number of reasons including the lack of
 
00:56:11.690 --> 00:56:11.700 align:start position:0%
predictable Revenue this worldwide
 
00:56:13.329 --> 00:56:13.339 align:start position:0%
policy could also have international
 
00:56:15.890 --> 00:56:15.900 align:start position:0%
ramifications and create unnecessary
 
00:56:17.630 --> 00:56:17.640 align:start position:0%
disputes with countries that are key
 
00:56:19.569 --> 00:56:19.579 align:start position:0%
trading partners with the United States
 
00:56:21.770 --> 00:56:21.780 align:start position:0%
this is at a time when Global
 
00:56:23.750 --> 00:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
Connections are needed most
 
00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
worldwide reporting as was mentioned was
 
00:56:29.210 --> 00:56:29.220 align:start position:0%
first debated in the states in the 1980s
 
00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
and some foreign governments even
 
00:56:33.230 --> 00:56:33.240 align:start position:0%
threatened to retaliate against the
 
00:56:35.390 --> 00:56:35.400 align:start position:0%
United States companies if these
 
00:56:37.790 --> 00:56:37.800 align:start position:0%
policies were adopted their concerns
 
00:56:39.950 --> 00:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
were that these policies would unfairly
 
00:56:42.530 --> 00:56:42.540 align:start position:0%
tax International companies and as a
 
00:56:45.970 --> 00:56:45.980 align:start position:0%
response States created a filing option
 
00:56:47.930 --> 00:56:47.940 align:start position:0%
allowing for what is called the true
 
00:56:50.690 --> 00:56:50.700 align:start position:0%
Waters Edge system this generally means
 
00:56:52.970 --> 00:56:52.980 align:start position:0%
including only U.S companies in the
 
00:56:55.910 --> 00:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
combined group every single state that
 
00:56:58.730 --> 00:56:58.740 align:start position:0%
offers worldwide as a filing option make
 
00:57:01.010 --> 00:57:01.020 align:start position:0%
sure to have this Water's Edge approach
 
00:57:03.770 --> 00:57:03.780 align:start position:0%
and whenever a state considers any form
 
00:57:06.290 --> 00:57:06.300 align:start position:0%
of combined reporting GBA Advocates
 
00:57:08.510 --> 00:57:08.520 align:start position:0%
generally for only the inclusion of U.S
 
00:57:11.630 --> 00:57:11.640 align:start position:0%
companies in the tax filing group this
 
00:57:13.130 --> 00:57:13.140 align:start position:0%
is what New Hampshire currently does
 
00:57:15.530 --> 00:57:15.540 align:start position:0%
this allows for fair Taxation and
 
00:57:17.930 --> 00:57:17.940 align:start position:0%
respects the principles of tax treaties
 
00:57:21.410 --> 00:57:21.420 align:start position:0%
by contrast worldwide combined reporting
 
00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
looks to tax a portion of the income of
 
00:57:26.809 --> 00:57:26.819 align:start position:0%
an entire Global Group again not a
 
00:57:28.730 --> 00:57:28.740 align:start position:0%
single state has mandated worldwide
 
00:57:30.890 --> 00:57:30.900 align:start position:0%
combined reporting and if New Hampshire
 
00:57:33.109 --> 00:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
adopts this mandatory approach it will
 
00:57:35.630 --> 00:57:35.640 align:start position:0%
make the state a complete outlier
 
00:57:38.569 --> 00:57:38.579 align:start position:0%
if this changes taxpayers and state tax
 
00:57:40.549 --> 00:57:40.559 align:start position:0%
administrators alike are faced with
 
00:57:42.950 --> 00:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
considerable challenges issues like
 
00:57:45.290 --> 00:57:45.300 align:start position:0%
managing currency conversions different
 
00:57:48.049 --> 00:57:48.059 align:start position:0%
Accounting Standards various reporting
 
00:57:50.089 --> 00:57:50.099 align:start position:0%
requirements and even language barriers
 
00:57:52.010 --> 00:57:52.020 align:start position:0%
to name a few
 
00:57:54.109 --> 00:57:54.119 align:start position:0%
as I stated at the beginning and of
 
00:57:55.849 --> 00:57:55.859 align:start position:0%
particular importance to everyone here
 
00:57:57.770 --> 00:57:57.780 align:start position:0%
that helps set the state's budget
 
00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
mandatory worldwide combined reporting
 
00:58:02.230 --> 00:58:02.240 align:start position:0%
creates Revenue volatility
 
00:58:05.150 --> 00:58:05.160 align:start position:0%
unpredictable revenue is a byproduct of
 
00:58:07.370 --> 00:58:07.380 align:start position:0%
any kind of combined reporting which
 
00:58:09.770 --> 00:58:09.780 align:start position:0%
could increase or decrease the revenues
 
00:58:11.930 --> 00:58:11.940 align:start position:0%
collected by the states
 
00:58:14.150 --> 00:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
states such as Virginia and Maryland
 
00:58:16.730 --> 00:58:16.740 align:start position:0%
explored regular combined reporting but
 
00:58:19.849 --> 00:58:19.859 align:start position:0%
neither adopted any form of it so for a
 
00:58:21.589 --> 00:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
mandatory worldwide approach that
 
00:58:23.930 --> 00:58:23.940 align:start position:0%
Revenue uncertainty is exponentially
 
00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
greater Not only would it require
 
00:58:29.030 --> 00:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
foreign company profits but also Global
 
00:58:31.010 --> 00:58:31.020 align:start position:0%
losses to be included in a combined
 
00:58:33.890 --> 00:58:33.900 align:start position:0%
return proponents of mandatory worldwide
 
00:58:35.930 --> 00:58:35.940 align:start position:0%
policies say it will bring in
 
00:58:37.609 --> 00:58:37.619 align:start position:0%
unprecedented Revenue but their
 
00:58:39.710 --> 00:58:39.720 align:start position:0%
methodology uses several troubling
 
00:58:42.109 --> 00:58:42.119 align:start position:0%
assumptions many of these studies for
 
00:58:44.089 --> 00:58:44.099 align:start position:0%
example were done before major federal
 
00:58:46.549 --> 00:58:46.559 align:start position:0%
tax reform even went into effect and are
 
00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
not accurate
 
00:58:51.470 --> 00:58:51.480 align:start position:0%
if the state adopts mandatory worldwide
 
00:58:53.089 --> 00:58:53.099 align:start position:0%
combined reporting unpredictable
 
00:58:55.849 --> 00:58:55.859 align:start position:0%
revenues are not the only issue the
 
00:58:57.770 --> 00:58:57.780 align:start position:0%
state could see a dramatic increase in
 
00:58:59.809 --> 00:58:59.819 align:start position:0%
audit activity and prolonged litigation
 
00:59:02.210 --> 00:59:02.220 align:start position:0%
exposure which creates risk
 
00:59:04.609 --> 00:59:04.619 align:start position:0%
if this policy is imposed it will hurt
 
00:59:06.470 --> 00:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
efforts to attract and retain
 
00:59:08.870 --> 00:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
International companies and damage the
 
00:59:11.630 --> 00:59:11.640 align:start position:0%
state's overall economic competitiveness
 
00:59:14.510 --> 00:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
so to recap my thoughts again no other
 
00:59:16.670 --> 00:59:16.680 align:start position:0%
state in the Union has taken this
 
00:59:18.710 --> 00:59:18.720 align:start position:0%
approach while regular combined
 
00:59:20.510 --> 00:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
reporting has been implemented in New
 
00:59:23.210 --> 00:59:23.220 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and many states not a single
 
00:59:25.670 --> 00:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
one has imposed mandatory worldwide
 
00:59:28.069 --> 00:59:28.079 align:start position:0%
reporting the state should preserve
 
00:59:30.049 --> 00:59:30.059 align:start position:0%
their current approach and avoid double
 
00:59:32.930 --> 00:59:32.940 align:start position:0%
taxation of income or retaliation from
 
00:59:35.630 --> 00:59:35.640 align:start position:0%
foreign governments if imposed worldwide
 
00:59:37.849 --> 00:59:37.859 align:start position:0%
combined reporting could not only cause
 
00:59:39.890 --> 00:59:39.900 align:start position:0%
erratic Revenue but could reduce
 
00:59:42.289 --> 00:59:42.299 align:start position:0%
corporate tax collections which is
 
00:59:43.849 --> 00:59:43.859 align:start position:0%
dangerous when funding the state's
 
00:59:43.859 --> 00:59:45.770 align:start position:0%
dangerous when funding the state's
priorities

00:59:45.770 --> 00:59:45.780 align:start position:0%
priorities
 
00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
please consider how this policy could
 
00:59:49.370 --> 00:59:49.380 align:start position:0%
damage future growth and hurt
 
00:59:52.010 --> 00:59:52.020 align:start position:0%
relationships with key trade allies
 
00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to speak
 
00:59:56.030 --> 00:59:56.040 align:start position:0%
today I will now turn it over to my
 
00:59:58.430 --> 00:59:58.440 align:start position:0%
colleague Alan pazetsky to to provide
 
01:00:02.089 --> 01:00:02.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:04.190 --> 01:00:04.200 align:start position:0%
thanks Meredith I hope you all can hear
 
01:00:06.890 --> 01:00:06.900 align:start position:0%
me uh hello chair spilsbury members of
 
01:00:08.510 --> 01:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
the commission good morning you're loud
 
01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:13.309 --> 01:00:13.319 align:start position:0%
we are still very members of the
 
01:00:15.530 --> 01:00:15.540 align:start position:0%
commission my name is Alan passetsky and
 
01:00:18.770 --> 01:00:18.780 align:start position:0%
I'm a tax policy advisor for gbda
 
01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
I have a unique perspective of working
 
01:00:23.510 --> 01:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
as a federal and state tax leader for a
 
01:00:25.329 --> 01:00:25.339 align:start position:0%
large corporation for over 30 years
 
01:00:28.010 --> 01:00:28.020 align:start position:0%
which included dealing with all aspects
 
01:00:30.530 --> 01:00:30.540 align:start position:0%
of taxes including Audits and compliance
 
01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
I cannot emphasize enough to this
 
01:00:34.910 --> 01:00:34.920 align:start position:0%
commission the Myriad of issues that
 
01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
mandatory worldwide combined reporting
 
01:00:38.809 --> 01:00:38.819 align:start position:0%
will create the New Hampshire
 
01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
this state has prided itself on good tax
 
01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
policy for individuals and businesses
 
01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:46.319 align:start position:0%
and is often ranked as a favorable
 
01:00:49.250 --> 01:00:49.260 align:start position:0%
destination for investment in fact I was
 
01:00:51.770 --> 01:00:51.780 align:start position:0%
up in Concord in April testifying in
 
01:00:54.289 --> 01:00:54.299 align:start position:0%
support of SB 189 which allows
 
01:00:56.510 --> 01:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
corporations to take a tax deduction for
 
01:00:58.490 --> 01:00:58.500 align:start position:0%
interest on loans that can be used to
 
01:01:00.049 --> 01:01:00.059 align:start position:0%
invest in the state
 
01:01:02.150 --> 01:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
this bill passed unanimously and was
 
01:01:03.950 --> 01:01:03.960 align:start position:0%
signed by the governor because this
 
01:01:05.990 --> 01:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
state continues to acknowledge that
 
01:01:07.970 --> 01:01:07.980 align:start position:0%
taxes should not be an impediment to job
 
01:01:10.370 --> 01:01:10.380 align:start position:0%
growth I would like to thank all of you
 
01:01:13.250 --> 01:01:13.260 align:start position:0%
for support on that very important bill
 
01:01:15.170 --> 01:01:15.180 align:start position:0%
but if you were to implement mandatory
 
01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
worldwide combined reporting now the
 
01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
state would be going backwards and it
 
01:01:21.349 --> 01:01:21.359 align:start position:0%
would undo all of the Goodwill New
 
01:01:23.569 --> 01:01:23.579 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has built up to encourage the
 
01:01:25.370 --> 01:01:25.380 align:start position:0%
business and the community to invest and
 
01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
create jobs
 
01:01:29.089 --> 01:01:29.099 align:start position:0%
worldwide combining is not a new concept
 
01:01:31.490 --> 01:01:31.500 align:start position:0%
as you have heard when the states first
 
01:01:33.650 --> 01:01:33.660 align:start position:0%
started started to adopt these proposals
 
01:01:36.589 --> 01:01:36.599 align:start position:0%
decades ago it was insanely complicated
 
01:01:39.589 --> 01:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
and produced long drawn-out audits as
 
01:01:41.390 --> 01:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
well as other issues which Meredith has
 
01:01:42.650 --> 01:01:42.660 align:start position:0%
raised earlier
 
01:01:44.750 --> 01:01:44.760 align:start position:0%
other than perhaps the good music of the
 
01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
1980s there is no reason to go back in
 
01:01:49.789 --> 01:01:49.799 align:start position:0%
time and revisit tax policies that were
 
01:01:51.770 --> 01:01:51.780 align:start position:0%
deemed harmful to Americans and American
 
01:01:54.890 --> 01:01:54.900 align:start position:0%
workers it should be noted though that
 
01:01:57.190 --> 01:01:57.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire unlike many states already
 
01:01:59.930 --> 01:01:59.940 align:start position:0%
taxes certain foreign income including
 
01:02:03.170 --> 01:02:03.180 align:start position:0%
dividends some of this Revenue collected
 
01:02:05.150 --> 01:02:05.160 align:start position:0%
from that foreign income could actually
 
01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:07.500 align:start position:0%
be compromised with a change to
 
01:02:10.910 --> 01:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
mandatory worldwide combined reporting
 
01:02:13.069 --> 01:02:13.079 align:start position:0%
another thing I could speak to firsthand
 
01:02:15.829 --> 01:02:15.839 align:start position:0%
is the huge administrative burden to do
 
01:02:18.530 --> 01:02:18.540 align:start position:0%
calculations for a worldwide tax return
 
01:02:20.809 --> 01:02:20.819 align:start position:0%
you may hear from others later today who
 
01:02:22.370 --> 01:02:22.380 align:start position:0%
have never worked internally for a
 
01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
business but these worldwide
 
01:02:26.030 --> 01:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
calculations are extremely complicated
 
01:02:28.370 --> 01:02:28.380 align:start position:0%
think about it is the person that's
 
01:02:30.530 --> 01:02:30.540 align:start position:0%
doing taxes for business based in
 
01:02:32.809 --> 01:02:32.819 align:start position:0%
Manchester supposed to reach out to
 
01:02:35.210 --> 01:02:35.220 align:start position:0%
company contacts around the globe
 
01:02:37.190 --> 01:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
International companies may not be
 
01:02:40.549 --> 01:02:40.559 align:start position:0%
willing or be able to share private data
 
01:02:43.370 --> 01:02:43.380 align:start position:0%
not knowing where it may end up
 
01:02:46.309 --> 01:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
the relevant profit and loss data that
 
01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
will need to be collected will not be
 
01:02:51.289 --> 01:02:51.299 align:start position:0%
calculated in U.S currency U.S
 
01:02:53.930 --> 01:02:53.940 align:start position:0%
accounting or U.S tax principles
 
01:02:56.089 --> 01:02:56.099 align:start position:0%
this complexity will not only be
 
01:02:57.770 --> 01:02:57.780 align:start position:0%
challenging for companies but for the
 
01:02:59.990 --> 01:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
state requiring additional audit staff
 
01:03:02.690 --> 01:03:02.700 align:start position:0%
and resources not to mention the
 
01:03:04.730 --> 01:03:04.740 align:start position:0%
eventual onslaught of litigation that
 
01:03:06.230 --> 01:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
will result
 
01:03:08.569 --> 01:03:08.579 align:start position:0%
in addition to almost complexity as
 
01:03:10.190 --> 01:03:10.200 align:start position:0%
Meredith indicated one of the biggest
 
01:03:12.049 --> 01:03:12.059 align:start position:0%
issues you should consider is the
 
01:03:13.789 --> 01:03:13.799 align:start position:0%
unpredictable impact this may have on
 
01:03:16.430 --> 01:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
your Revenue no one can honestly tell
 
01:03:18.289 --> 01:03:18.299 align:start position:0%
you what the income or loss of
 
01:03:20.030 --> 01:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
international companies around the world
 
01:03:22.789 --> 01:03:22.799 align:start position:0%
will be annually or the impact on New
 
01:03:25.069 --> 01:03:25.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's revenues the bottom line is
 
01:03:27.109 --> 01:03:27.119 align:start position:0%
that the impact will be dependent upon
 
01:03:29.809 --> 01:03:29.819 align:start position:0%
the global facts for each company's
 
01:03:32.329 --> 01:03:32.339 align:start position:0%
group and which company is globally are
 
01:03:34.370 --> 01:03:34.380 align:start position:0%
allowed to be included in the group
 
01:03:36.710 --> 01:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
again this policy would make New
 
01:03:39.170 --> 01:03:39.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a complete outlier and I urge
 
01:03:41.390 --> 01:03:41.400 align:start position:0%
you not to gamble with a controversial
 
01:03:43.309 --> 01:03:43.319 align:start position:0%
tax system that is unknown Revenue
 
01:03:46.250 --> 01:03:46.260 align:start position:0%
results creates complexity and deters
 
01:03:48.890 --> 01:03:48.900 align:start position:0%
investment thank you and we are happy to
 
01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:51.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:54.890 --> 01:03:54.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:58.549 --> 01:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:00.950 --> 01:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair Jordan ulery Hudson
 
01:04:04.010 --> 01:04:04.020 align:start position:0%
uh representing Hudson
 
01:04:06.109 --> 01:04:06.119 align:start position:0%
listening to the testimony that you've
 
01:04:08.150 --> 01:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
given thus far into the uh the
 
01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:15.650 --> 01:04:15.660 align:start position:0%
I'm a little concerned that using that
 
01:04:18.049 --> 01:04:18.059 align:start position:0%
that large employer here in New
 
01:04:18.059 --> 01:04:19.490 align:start position:0%
that large employer here in New
Hampshire

01:04:19.490 --> 01:04:19.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:04:23.630 --> 01:04:23.640 align:start position:0%
if that company were to have a loss in
 
01:04:27.770 --> 01:04:27.780 align:start position:0%
say shipbuilding and
 
01:04:30.470 --> 01:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
Northern England
 
01:04:33.170 --> 01:04:33.180 align:start position:0%
could they not then just shift as a
 
01:04:35.089 --> 01:04:35.099 align:start position:0%
business cost
 
01:04:37.490 --> 01:04:37.500 align:start position:0%
anything that the profits that were made
 
01:04:39.589 --> 01:04:39.599 align:start position:0%
from selling
 
01:04:42.410 --> 01:04:42.420 align:start position:0%
avionics in New Hampshire
 
01:04:48.470 --> 01:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:50.569 --> 01:04:50.579 align:start position:0%
in England and that would be under
 
01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:53.400 align:start position:0%
worldwide reporting a legitimate shift
 
01:04:56.510 --> 01:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
of funds to cover business expenses so
 
01:04:58.730 --> 01:04:58.740 align:start position:0%
there would be no taxation in New
 
01:04:59.870 --> 01:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because it's a business
 
01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:02.270 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because it's a business
expense

01:05:02.270 --> 01:05:02.280 align:start position:0%
expense
 
01:05:05.089 --> 01:05:05.099 align:start position:0%
it it was that a scenario that could
 
01:05:05.099 --> 01:05:07.970 align:start position:0%
it it was that a scenario that could
exist

01:05:07.970 --> 01:05:07.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:09.950 --> 01:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
I'll start it off Alan and then you can
 
01:05:12.650 --> 01:05:12.660 align:start position:0%
chime in I think one of the things that
 
01:05:14.569 --> 01:05:14.579 align:start position:0%
I wanted to underscore in our testimony
 
01:05:17.089 --> 01:05:17.099 align:start position:0%
was that the idea of global losses
 
01:05:20.089 --> 01:05:20.099 align:start position:0%
aren't often accounted for when the
 
01:05:21.410 --> 01:05:21.420 align:start position:0%
proponents are talking about the
 
01:05:23.930 --> 01:05:23.940 align:start position:0%
estimations of Revenue included so
 
01:05:25.670 --> 01:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
you're exactly right if you mandate all
 
01:05:27.470 --> 01:05:27.480 align:start position:0%
of these subsidiaries or foreign parent
 
01:05:29.450 --> 01:05:29.460 align:start position:0%
to be included into a combined group
 
01:05:33.410 --> 01:05:33.420 align:start position:0%
without any connection to New Hampshire
 
01:05:36.589 --> 01:05:36.599 align:start position:0%
operations you could change the
 
01:05:39.770 --> 01:05:39.780 align:start position:0%
apportionment of how a company would
 
01:05:42.410 --> 01:05:42.420 align:start position:0%
need to file or be liable for taxes paid
 
01:05:43.789 --> 01:05:43.799 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire right so it could
 
01:05:46.730 --> 01:05:46.740 align:start position:0%
reduce that Revenue that the state
 
01:05:49.130 --> 01:05:49.140 align:start position:0%
eventually collects because there's
 
01:05:51.710 --> 01:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
Global losses being folded into a group
 
01:05:54.770 --> 01:05:54.780 align:start position:0%
than just the single sales Factor
 
01:05:57.470 --> 01:05:57.480 align:start position:0%
Alan anything to add on that
 
01:05:59.089 --> 01:05:59.099 align:start position:0%
no I think that's just a good point
 
01:06:00.589 --> 01:06:00.599 align:start position:0%
people think about this as it's
 
01:06:02.510 --> 01:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
worldwide it's the entire world group
 
01:06:05.270 --> 01:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
first of all it is only certain members
 
01:06:07.250 --> 01:06:07.260 align:start position:0%
of the group that meet certain criteria
 
01:06:09.829 --> 01:06:09.839 align:start position:0%
the dra can comment on that later but
 
01:06:11.809 --> 01:06:11.819 align:start position:0%
there has to be a connection of some
 
01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
sort between the foreign company and the
 
01:06:17.450 --> 01:06:17.460 align:start position:0%
U.S company whether it be ownership of I
 
01:06:19.910 --> 01:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
mean common officers a shipment of goods
 
01:06:23.630 --> 01:06:23.640 align:start position:0%
or is a whole plethora of of issues that
 
01:06:26.210 --> 01:06:26.220 align:start position:0%
could get you included and those rules
 
01:06:28.910 --> 01:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
are very subjective so first like you
 
01:06:30.710 --> 01:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
said representative
 
01:06:33.109 --> 01:06:33.119 align:start position:0%
you could bring in losses you could
 
01:06:35.089 --> 01:06:35.099 align:start position:0%
bring in losses of certain companies and
 
01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
not others this is a Pandora's Box that
 
01:06:41.029 --> 01:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
would be reopened for basically no
 
01:06:42.589 --> 01:06:42.599 align:start position:0%
reason because as Meredith said the
 
01:06:44.750 --> 01:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
revenue and certainty drives the
 
01:06:51.230 --> 01:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:53.990 --> 01:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
representative chamber
 
01:06:57.170 --> 01:06:57.180 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Tom Schamberg
 
01:07:00.410 --> 01:07:00.420 align:start position:0%
uh Merrimack six
 
01:07:06.410 --> 01:07:06.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:06.420 --> 01:07:07.970 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:07:07.970 --> 01:07:07.980 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:07:09.650 --> 01:07:09.660 align:start position:0%
first question for you
 
01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:11.029 align:start position:0%
first question for you
uh

01:07:11.029 --> 01:07:11.039 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:07:14.270 --> 01:07:14.280 align:start position:0%
do you know what the purpose of our
 
01:07:16.730 --> 01:07:16.740 align:start position:0%
tax uh
 
01:07:20.750 --> 01:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
policy is for New Hampshire
 
01:07:24.650 --> 01:07:24.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:24.660 --> 01:07:25.510 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:28.069 --> 01:07:28.079 align:start position:0%
what is the first I'm not trying to
 
01:07:29.930 --> 01:07:29.940 align:start position:0%
understand that question well I I just
 
01:07:32.630 --> 01:07:32.640 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that that
 
01:07:34.430 --> 01:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
we understand what we're trying to do
 
01:07:36.410 --> 01:07:36.420 align:start position:0%
for the citizens of New Hampshire Our
 
01:07:38.569 --> 01:07:38.579 align:start position:0%
obligation to the citizens of New
 
01:07:38.579 --> 01:07:39.670 align:start position:0%
obligation to the citizens of New
Hampshire

01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:07:43.250 --> 01:07:43.260 align:start position:0%
is to assure a fair and Level Playing
 
01:07:47.450 --> 01:07:47.460 align:start position:0%
Field for its taxpayers and our tax laws
 
01:07:50.210 --> 01:07:50.220 align:start position:0%
have to make sure that they are fair and
 
01:07:52.569 --> 01:07:52.579 align:start position:0%
level and this is probably the only one
 
01:07:55.370 --> 01:07:55.380 align:start position:0%
that really really
 
01:07:59.750 --> 01:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
has some deficits to it
 
01:08:02.450 --> 01:08:02.460 align:start position:0%
for policy I know
 
01:08:05.089 --> 01:08:05.099 align:start position:0%
so let me let me try to answer the
 
01:08:05.099 --> 01:08:05.930 align:start position:0%
so let me let me try to answer the
question

01:08:05.930 --> 01:08:05.940 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:08:08.630 --> 01:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
the policy you currently have let's look
 
01:08:09.890 --> 01:08:09.900 align:start position:0%
at this whole country and then we'll
 
01:08:12.289 --> 01:08:12.299 align:start position:0%
focus on New Hampshire okay as earlier
 
01:08:14.450 --> 01:08:14.460 align:start position:0%
testimony indicated companies can file
 
01:08:16.910 --> 01:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
basically in two ways as a separate
 
01:08:19.130 --> 01:08:19.140 align:start position:0%
company each U.S company files a return
 
01:08:22.189 --> 01:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire or is a group You a New
 
01:08:24.410 --> 01:08:24.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire chosen combined reporting
 
01:08:27.289 --> 01:08:27.299 align:start position:0%
of those U.S companies about 27 States
 
01:08:29.150 --> 01:08:29.160 align:start position:0%
sold roughly about half of the country
 
01:08:31.669 --> 01:08:31.679 align:start position:0%
had that kind of reporting it has been
 
01:08:33.289 --> 01:08:33.299 align:start position:0%
determined by almost all these states
 
01:08:35.510 --> 01:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
that that is an appropriate method of
 
01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:36.709 align:start position:0%
that that is an appropriate method of
reporting

01:08:36.709 --> 01:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
you can argue both ways what's exactly
 
01:08:40.789 --> 01:08:40.799 align:start position:0%
the right amount of tax we don't know
 
01:08:42.890 --> 01:08:42.900 align:start position:0%
but as far as not creating a playing
 
01:08:44.809 --> 01:08:44.819 align:start position:0%
field globally
 
01:08:47.329 --> 01:08:47.339 align:start position:0%
global companies and earlier testimonial
 
01:08:48.950 --> 01:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
represented uh mentioned Home Depot
 
01:08:50.809 --> 01:08:50.819 align:start position:0%
which is a U.S company again
 
01:08:53.930 --> 01:08:53.940 align:start position:0%
International but U.S based we all had
 
01:08:56.450 --> 01:08:56.460 align:start position:0%
the same tax returns to file we all have
 
01:08:58.669 --> 01:08:58.679 align:start position:0%
the same calculation of income and loss
 
01:09:01.130 --> 01:09:01.140 align:start position:0%
to come down to taxable income with the
 
01:09:03.050 --> 01:09:03.060 align:start position:0%
same New Hampshire tax rate
 
01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:05.400 align:start position:0%
do certain companies have advantages
 
01:09:06.769 --> 01:09:06.779 align:start position:0%
because they have foreign Affiliates
 
01:09:09.890 --> 01:09:09.900 align:start position:0%
well they have they have a situation
 
01:09:11.990 --> 01:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
where they could pay expenses to a
 
01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
foreign affiliate because that's where
 
01:09:15.530 --> 01:09:15.540 align:start position:0%
they're Incorporated that's where they
 
01:09:17.150 --> 01:09:17.160 align:start position:0%
are set up the company I used to work
 
01:09:19.789 --> 01:09:19.799 align:start position:0%
for was established long before there
 
01:09:22.070 --> 01:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
was a federal income tax code
 
01:09:24.289 --> 01:09:24.299 align:start position:0%
and one it was an earlier testimony
 
01:09:25.729 --> 01:09:25.739 align:start position:0%
again I'll keep referring to where it
 
01:09:27.950 --> 01:09:27.960 align:start position:0%
talked about paying a licensing fee of
 
01:09:30.229 --> 01:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
Pharma companies because they transfer a
 
01:09:33.050 --> 01:09:33.060 align:start position:0%
patent well if it's an abusive situation
 
01:09:36.169 --> 01:09:36.179 align:start position:0%
it can be dealt with the auto level or
 
01:09:38.450 --> 01:09:38.460 align:start position:0%
in the federal audit level but if that
 
01:09:40.669 --> 01:09:40.679 align:start position:0%
company established that patent because
 
01:09:42.650 --> 01:09:42.660 align:start position:0%
it was incorporated in the Netherlands
 
01:09:45.890 --> 01:09:45.900 align:start position:0%
in 1845 at all of their patents are
 
01:09:49.070 --> 01:09:49.080 align:start position:0%
there and now that company has to pay a
 
01:09:51.650 --> 01:09:51.660 align:start position:0%
license fee to use that patent that is
 
01:09:53.269 --> 01:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
legitimate business expense and doesn't
 
01:09:55.490 --> 01:09:55.500 align:start position:0%
create an unleaval field because for the
 
01:09:57.729 --> 01:09:57.739 align:start position:0%
companies that are us-based companies
 
01:10:00.410 --> 01:10:00.420 align:start position:0%
Pharma companies and the like they would
 
01:10:02.270 --> 01:10:02.280 align:start position:0%
have the patent in the U.S and they
 
01:10:04.729 --> 01:10:04.739 align:start position:0%
would receive that licensing income it's
 
01:10:07.390 --> 01:10:07.400 align:start position:0%
really a matter of General business
 
01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:08.950 align:start position:0%
really a matter of General business
setups

01:10:08.950 --> 01:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
setups
 
01:10:11.870 --> 01:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
organization that is established that
 
01:10:14.570 --> 01:10:14.580 align:start position:0%
way and again I think to representative
 
01:10:16.490 --> 01:10:16.500 align:start position:0%
Shamrock a lot of the focus is going to
 
01:10:19.790 --> 01:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
be on abusive transactions and we don't
 
01:10:21.649 --> 01:10:21.659 align:start position:0%
shut down a street because a few people
 
01:10:24.950 --> 01:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
are jaywalking I think those abuses if
 
01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
they're out there need to be addressed
 
01:10:28.550 --> 01:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
by Auditors at the state and federal
 
01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:30.229 align:start position:0%
by Auditors at the state and federal
level

01:10:30.229 --> 01:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
level
 
01:10:32.450 --> 01:10:32.460 align:start position:0%
may I follow up with another question
 
01:10:35.689 --> 01:10:35.699 align:start position:0%
either for Meredith or for Alan
 
01:10:35.699 --> 01:10:37.130 align:start position:0%
either for Meredith or for Alan
um

01:10:37.130 --> 01:10:37.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:40.250 --> 01:10:40.260 align:start position:0%
regarding the statement about the
 
01:10:40.260 --> 01:10:41.570 align:start position:0%
regarding the statement about the
uh

01:10:41.570 --> 01:10:41.580 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:10:44.810 --> 01:10:44.820 align:start position:0%
complexity of trying to
 
01:10:49.270 --> 01:10:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:53.510 --> 01:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
does the dra
 
01:10:55.850 --> 01:10:55.860 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire would you say they have
 
01:10:57.169 --> 01:10:57.179 align:start position:0%
the authority to require the
 
01:10:59.590 --> 01:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
corporations to report
 
01:11:02.689 --> 01:11:02.699 align:start position:0%
that information that we we need to
 
01:11:08.110 --> 01:11:08.120 align:start position:0%
determine their tax liability uh
 
01:11:10.250 --> 01:11:10.260 align:start position:0%
directly on their New Hampshire
 
01:11:13.430 --> 01:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
Corporation corporate tax returns
 
01:11:15.229 --> 01:11:15.239 align:start position:0%
could that be done
 
01:11:18.290 --> 01:11:18.300 align:start position:0%
and follow-up on that one is you talk
 
01:11:20.630 --> 01:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
about complexity of languages and things
 
01:11:21.790 --> 01:11:21.800 align:start position:0%
like this
 
01:11:24.410 --> 01:11:24.420 align:start position:0%
what is the basic language that we use
 
01:11:24.420 --> 01:11:25.729 align:start position:0%
what is the basic language that we use
in

01:11:25.729 --> 01:11:25.739 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:11:27.970 --> 01:11:27.980 align:start position:0%
across the world today
 
01:11:33.110 --> 01:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:35.570 --> 01:11:35.580 align:start position:0%
uh so uh representative Schamberg I'll
 
01:11:37.310 --> 01:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
take a first pass you know I definitely
 
01:11:39.530 --> 01:11:39.540 align:start position:0%
want the department to speak on I don't
 
01:11:41.090 --> 01:11:41.100 align:start position:0%
want to speak on the Department's behalf
 
01:11:43.250 --> 01:11:43.260 align:start position:0%
I think they can require certain
 
01:11:45.470 --> 01:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
information but again I think it is
 
01:11:47.149 --> 01:11:47.159 align:start position:0%
challenging for companies when you're
 
01:11:48.890 --> 01:11:48.900 align:start position:0%
managing conversions and different
 
01:11:52.310 --> 01:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
accounting standards across multiple
 
01:11:54.709 --> 01:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
different countries and languages do
 
01:11:56.990 --> 01:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
still vary I I'm not as familiar and
 
01:11:59.330 --> 01:11:59.340 align:start position:0%
I'll turn it over to Alan to to take it
 
01:12:02.030 --> 01:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
from a a Global Perspective but I do
 
01:12:03.890 --> 01:12:03.900 align:start position:0%
think that there's still various
 
01:12:07.070 --> 01:12:07.080 align:start position:0%
different tax return information like
 
01:12:09.229 --> 01:12:09.239 align:start position:0%
different governments don't have the
 
01:12:11.870 --> 01:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
same type of lines that we do at the I
 
01:12:14.570 --> 01:12:14.580 align:start position:0%
you know Internal Revenue code and when
 
01:12:17.090 --> 01:12:17.100 align:start position:0%
a federal tax reform is or federal tax
 
01:12:19.850 --> 01:12:19.860 align:start position:0%
filing is done here it looks different
 
01:12:22.910 --> 01:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
than a Swiss tax return or a Canadian
 
01:12:25.070 --> 01:12:25.080 align:start position:0%
tax return and that's not just language
 
01:12:31.310 --> 01:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:33.590 --> 01:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
yeah Meredith I I would agree I mean
 
01:12:35.450 --> 01:12:35.460 align:start position:0%
think about it again
 
01:12:37.850 --> 01:12:37.860 align:start position:0%
your foreign parented headquarters
 
01:12:40.370 --> 01:12:40.380 align:start position:0%
you're likely representative Shamrock to
 
01:12:41.810 --> 01:12:41.820 align:start position:0%
help me language that everyone speaks
 
01:12:44.510 --> 01:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
maybe English depends on the country but
 
01:12:45.590 --> 01:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
that's not what we're talking about it
 
01:12:46.850 --> 01:12:46.860 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
01:12:49.070 --> 01:12:49.080 align:start position:0%
a company in the U.S in New Hampshire
 
01:12:52.070 --> 01:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
now having to decide which of its
 
01:12:54.169 --> 01:12:54.179 align:start position:0%
Affiliates around the world belong in
 
01:12:56.510 --> 01:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
its group based on the facts
 
01:12:59.030 --> 01:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
of that affiliate and it's interplay
 
01:13:01.430 --> 01:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
with the U.S company which means I'm
 
01:13:03.350 --> 01:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
gonna have to have my state tax person
 
01:13:06.709 --> 01:13:06.719 align:start position:0%
reach out to say someone in South Africa
 
01:13:10.430 --> 01:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
or in you know Brazil or in any country
 
01:13:13.189 --> 01:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
and have a thorough discussion on
 
01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
whether that company perhaps should be
 
01:13:17.570 --> 01:13:17.580 align:start position:0%
in the group and if it should be in the
 
01:13:20.450 --> 01:13:20.460 align:start position:0%
group how to get their income which will
 
01:13:22.010 --> 01:13:22.020 align:start position:0%
be computed on a completely different
 
01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:23.450 align:start position:0%
be computed on a completely different
principles

01:13:23.450 --> 01:13:23.460 align:start position:0%
principles
 
01:13:25.070 --> 01:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
tax returns in other countries are
 
01:13:26.930 --> 01:13:26.940 align:start position:0%
nothing like ours every country has
 
01:13:28.490 --> 01:13:28.500 align:start position:0%
their own different system they don't
 
01:13:30.350 --> 01:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
even stop at the sales often they start
 
01:13:33.050 --> 01:13:33.060 align:start position:0%
at different levels and build up to
 
01:13:36.169 --> 01:13:36.179 align:start position:0%
translate that into a consistent Apples
 
01:13:38.810 --> 01:13:38.820 align:start position:0%
to Apples calculation to be used in a
 
01:13:40.490 --> 01:13:40.500 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire tax return
 
01:13:44.390 --> 01:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
so it is a very complicated calculation
 
01:13:48.649 --> 01:13:48.659 align:start position:0%
and then the dra will have to audit that
 
01:13:50.450 --> 01:13:50.460 align:start position:0%
and I don't know how they have the
 
01:13:52.189 --> 01:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
resources to determine
 
01:13:54.890 --> 01:13:54.900 align:start position:0%
if those numbers are even remotely
 
01:13:54.900 --> 01:13:56.990 align:start position:0%
if those numbers are even remotely
accurate

01:13:56.990 --> 01:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
accurate
 
01:13:58.850 --> 01:13:58.860 align:start position:0%
thank you for that answer in the last
 
01:14:02.290 --> 01:14:02.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:04.430 --> 01:14:04.440 align:start position:0%
I have my third question I don't want to
 
01:14:07.550 --> 01:14:07.560 align:start position:0%
lose strength do either one of you know
 
01:14:09.830 --> 01:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
if there was ever a secret Arrangement
 
01:14:11.930 --> 01:14:11.940 align:start position:0%
between the US government through the
 
01:14:13.910 --> 01:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
White House with Great Britain to move
 
01:14:16.149 --> 01:14:16.159 align:start position:0%
away from worldwide combined reporting
 
01:14:18.709 --> 01:14:18.719 align:start position:0%
uh with States like New Hampshire and
 
01:14:18.719 --> 01:14:20.990 align:start position:0%
uh with States like New Hampshire and
California

01:14:20.990 --> 01:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
California
 
01:14:22.610 --> 01:14:22.620 align:start position:0%
representative Schamberg I'm not
 
01:14:24.530 --> 01:14:24.540 align:start position:0%
personally familiar with that I do know
 
01:14:27.110 --> 01:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of countries threaten to retaliate
 
01:14:30.470 --> 01:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
if states did pass bills so there was uh
 
01:14:32.810 --> 01:14:32.820 align:start position:0%
you know if measures were they were
 
01:14:34.669 --> 01:14:34.679 align:start position:0%
waiting in the wings if States moved
 
01:14:35.990 --> 01:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
forward with Worldwide combined
 
01:14:37.669 --> 01:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
reporting so I hope that answers your
 
01:14:41.149 --> 01:14:41.159 align:start position:0%
question it sort of answers it
 
01:14:43.850 --> 01:14:43.860 align:start position:0%
thank you yep
 
01:14:46.970 --> 01:14:46.980 align:start position:0%
questions from other members
 
01:14:50.390 --> 01:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
I'm one question Ms Beason you mentioned
 
01:14:53.330 --> 01:14:53.340 align:start position:0%
that you have 200 members I imagine if I
 
01:14:54.890 --> 01:14:54.900 align:start position:0%
went to the website I might find a list
 
01:14:56.570 --> 01:14:56.580 align:start position:0%
but can you provide us a list of the
 
01:14:59.090 --> 01:14:59.100 align:start position:0%
members yes absolutely thank you yeah
 
01:15:02.090 --> 01:15:02.100 align:start position:0%
thank you um I I have a question yes Mr
 
01:15:04.850 --> 01:15:04.860 align:start position:0%
Kennedy relative to the issue of
 
01:15:07.130 --> 01:15:07.140 align:start position:0%
retaliation from the foreign entities
 
01:15:09.169 --> 01:15:09.179 align:start position:0%
and things like that
 
01:15:11.149 --> 01:15:11.159 align:start position:0%
um do you have any
 
01:15:11.159 --> 01:15:12.729 align:start position:0%
um do you have any
anything

01:15:12.729 --> 01:15:12.739 align:start position:0%
anything
 
01:15:16.250 --> 01:15:16.260 align:start position:0%
even speculative as to like what that
 
01:15:18.169 --> 01:15:18.179 align:start position:0%
looks like in terms of potentially
 
01:15:20.750 --> 01:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
businesses not coming in or leaving the
 
01:15:23.510 --> 01:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
the state because we move to to this and
 
01:15:27.350 --> 01:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
and in conjunction with that assuming
 
01:15:29.750 --> 01:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
companies didn't retaliate didn't leave
 
01:15:31.370 --> 01:15:31.380 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:15:32.870 --> 01:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
um there have been numbers that have
 
01:15:35.090 --> 01:15:35.100 align:start position:0%
been indicated that if we move to
 
01:15:38.630 --> 01:15:38.640 align:start position:0%
worldwide reporting uh revenues would
 
01:15:41.570 --> 01:15:41.580 align:start position:0%
increase by a significant amount
 
01:15:44.149 --> 01:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
um is it your sense that if there wasn't
 
01:15:47.209 --> 01:15:47.219 align:start position:0%
a retaliation that moving to worldwide
 
01:15:50.149 --> 01:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
reporting would increase revenues to the
 
01:15:53.570 --> 01:15:53.580 align:start position:0%
state and and then I presume your
 
01:15:56.149 --> 01:15:56.159 align:start position:0%
argument is that yeah might potentially
 
01:15:57.830 --> 01:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
it would go revenues might go up if
 
01:16:00.229 --> 01:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
nobody left but the the offset to that
 
01:16:02.390 --> 01:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
is companies would leave so revenues
 
01:16:04.250 --> 01:16:04.260 align:start position:0%
would go down I'm just trying to to
 
01:16:07.070 --> 01:16:07.080 align:start position:0%
understand your your position on the the
 
01:16:09.770 --> 01:16:09.780 align:start position:0%
controversy between those two ideas yes
 
01:16:11.390 --> 01:16:11.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I think it's
 
01:16:13.729 --> 01:16:13.739 align:start position:0%
worth clarifying that when we use
 
01:16:15.590 --> 01:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
retaliation it was actually retaliation
 
01:16:17.870 --> 01:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
by other governments against U.S
 
01:16:19.550 --> 01:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
companies who do business in those
 
01:16:22.729 --> 01:16:22.739 align:start position:0%
places right so I'm not saying on behalf
 
01:16:24.530 --> 01:16:24.540 align:start position:0%
of our members that individual companies
 
01:16:26.930 --> 01:16:26.940 align:start position:0%
would retaliate or choose to leave I
 
01:16:29.149 --> 01:16:29.159 align:start position:0%
think they might might have a lot of
 
01:16:31.070 --> 01:16:31.080 align:start position:0%
complexity and additional burdens when
 
01:16:32.510 --> 01:16:32.520 align:start position:0%
they're putting together these worldwide
 
01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:34.010 align:start position:0%
they're putting together these worldwide
calculations

01:16:34.010 --> 01:16:34.020 align:start position:0%
calculations
 
01:16:37.610 --> 01:16:37.620 align:start position:0%
but I want to underscore that U.S
 
01:16:39.830 --> 01:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
companies might be hurt by all the other
 
01:16:41.810 --> 01:16:41.820 align:start position:0%
countries that try to respond and do
 
01:16:44.149 --> 01:16:44.159 align:start position:0%
something similar right so that is that
 
01:16:47.570 --> 01:16:47.580 align:start position:0%
notion of the retaliation piece and I
 
01:16:49.370 --> 01:16:49.380 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question on Revenue
 
01:16:51.830 --> 01:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
you know I wanted to underscore that
 
01:16:53.870 --> 01:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
some of our members actually like a
 
01:16:56.030 --> 01:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
worldwide approach they like it as an
 
01:16:59.510 --> 01:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
option and that goes directly to the
 
01:17:01.970 --> 01:17:01.980 align:start position:0%
point of potential revenues could
 
01:17:05.030 --> 01:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
decrease here in the state if this is
 
01:17:07.430 --> 01:17:07.440 align:start position:0%
imposed because it does pick winners and
 
01:17:09.709 --> 01:17:09.719 align:start position:0%
losers so some companies would pay more
 
01:17:12.110 --> 01:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
in liability While others would see a
 
01:17:14.030 --> 01:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
reduction in their tax liability and I
 
01:17:15.350 --> 01:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
think that surprises a lot of people
 
01:17:17.870 --> 01:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
because they assume by mandating a
 
01:17:19.610 --> 01:17:19.620 align:start position:0%
worldwide group that it's just going to
 
01:17:21.770 --> 01:17:21.780 align:start position:0%
bring in all these profits which again
 
01:17:21.780 --> 01:17:23.330 align:start position:0%
bring in all these profits which again
are

01:17:23.330 --> 01:17:23.340 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:17:25.970 --> 01:17:25.980 align:start position:0%
not being it's not being considered that
 
01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
Global losses would also be part of them
 
01:17:31.550 --> 01:17:31.560 align:start position:0%
um one more question relative to the
 
01:17:33.229 --> 01:17:33.239 align:start position:0%
complexity and certainly I think it's
 
01:17:35.510 --> 01:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
understood that there would be various
 
01:17:37.729 --> 01:17:37.739 align:start position:0%
levels of complexity by moving to to
 
01:17:39.110 --> 01:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
this but
 
01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:39.770 align:start position:0%
this but
um

01:17:39.770 --> 01:17:39.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:43.550 --> 01:17:43.560 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of information gathering
 
01:17:46.970 --> 01:17:46.980 align:start position:0%
the federal return requires a lot of
 
01:17:49.850 --> 01:17:49.860 align:start position:0%
foreign reporting whether it's a 5471
 
01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
and Reporting your subsidiary activity
 
01:17:55.570 --> 01:17:55.580 align:start position:0%
or foreign companies with U.S operations
 
01:17:58.130 --> 01:17:58.140 align:start position:0%
I'm interested in your response when
 
01:17:59.810 --> 01:17:59.820 align:start position:0%
people say well no that information is
 
01:18:01.990 --> 01:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
already available on the federal return
 
01:18:06.229 --> 01:18:06.239 align:start position:0%
so the state would have less issues with
 
01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
kind of compiling that information for
 
01:18:09.950 --> 01:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
worldwide reporting what's what's your
 
01:18:11.990 --> 01:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
response to when when people are
 
01:18:14.330 --> 01:18:14.340 align:start position:0%
thinking relative to the reporting
 
01:18:16.610 --> 01:18:16.620 align:start position:0%
Associated on the federal return
 
01:18:19.610 --> 01:18:19.620 align:start position:0%
great question I think and I'll let Alan
 
01:18:21.950 --> 01:18:21.960 align:start position:0%
back me up but the federal Consolidated
 
01:18:23.930 --> 01:18:23.940 align:start position:0%
group is a very different group than
 
01:18:27.590 --> 01:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
would be required under a state combined
 
01:18:29.689 --> 01:18:29.699 align:start position:0%
return or World mandatory worldwide
 
01:18:35.630 --> 01:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
return and I think it's a lot of moving
 
01:18:37.490 --> 01:18:37.500 align:start position:0%
pieces right when you think of a federal
 
01:18:40.250 --> 01:18:40.260 align:start position:0%
return as a company's usual Federal
 
01:18:43.910 --> 01:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
Consolidated group and so a state tax
 
01:18:45.950 --> 01:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
return what is connected effectively
 
01:18:49.010 --> 01:18:49.020 align:start position:0%
connected income or what is connected to
 
01:18:50.990 --> 01:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
activities here in the state it looks
 
01:18:52.390 --> 01:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
different that group will look different
 
01:18:55.070 --> 01:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
but you're right that any federal
 
01:18:57.410 --> 01:18:57.420 align:start position:0%
amended return is also going to be
 
01:18:59.810 --> 01:18:59.820 align:start position:0%
reflected on the state side right so if
 
01:19:01.490 --> 01:19:01.500 align:start position:0%
an adjusted return is done at the
 
01:19:04.370 --> 01:19:04.380 align:start position:0%
federal level then you've also got that
 
01:19:05.930 --> 01:19:05.940 align:start position:0%
as a starting point with a New Hampshire
 
01:19:08.689 --> 01:19:08.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:10.490 --> 01:19:10.500 align:start position:0%
anything to add
 
01:19:13.010 --> 01:19:13.020 align:start position:0%
yeah let me add a little bit yeah it's a
 
01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
great question by the way um you know
 
01:19:18.649 --> 01:19:18.659 align:start position:0%
you mentioned 5471 it's 5471s are formed
 
01:19:20.330 --> 01:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
that certain companies file that have
 
01:19:22.910 --> 01:19:22.920 align:start position:0%
foreign subsidiaries right so there will
 
01:19:25.850 --> 01:19:25.860 align:start position:0%
be some data on those forms that perhaps
 
01:19:27.530 --> 01:19:27.540 align:start position:0%
could be used here I guess we don't know
 
01:19:29.209 --> 01:19:29.219 align:start position:0%
what the language would be what would be
 
01:19:30.530 --> 01:19:30.540 align:start position:0%
required but
 
01:19:33.649 --> 01:19:33.659 align:start position:0%
we are also talking about a much larger
 
01:19:35.390 --> 01:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
group of companies that are not foreign
 
01:19:37.850 --> 01:19:37.860 align:start position:0%
subsidiaries they're not on under the
 
01:19:39.169 --> 01:19:39.179 align:start position:0%
U.S group
 
01:19:41.450 --> 01:19:41.460 align:start position:0%
there will be no information or very
 
01:19:43.970 --> 01:19:43.980 align:start position:0%
limited information in a U.S tax return
 
01:19:46.669 --> 01:19:46.679 align:start position:0%
related to those companies
 
01:19:49.970 --> 01:19:49.980 align:start position:0%
so it's two different groups of foreign
 
01:19:52.010 --> 01:19:52.020 align:start position:0%
companies that we'd be looking at once
 
01:19:56.209 --> 01:19:56.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:58.550 --> 01:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
so if I can just follow up that
 
01:20:01.910 --> 01:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
anticipated question I wanted to ask the
 
01:20:03.709 --> 01:20:03.719 align:start position:0%
audit challenge
 
01:20:07.310 --> 01:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
when an issue arises it's likely to
 
01:20:10.310 --> 01:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
require reach into Data that goes beyond
 
01:20:11.810 --> 01:20:11.820 align:start position:0%
what would be found in the federal
 
01:20:14.510 --> 01:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
income tax return is that correct
 
01:20:20.209 --> 01:20:20.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:23.330 --> 01:20:23.340 align:start position:0%
okay see no more uh questions excellent
 
01:20:25.070 --> 01:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you very much both of
 
01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:27.910 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you very much both of
you

01:20:27.910 --> 01:20:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:29.770 --> 01:20:29.780 align:start position:0%
thanks for
 
01:20:31.430 --> 01:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
dialing in
 
01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:32.750 align:start position:0%
dialing in
okay

01:20:32.750 --> 01:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:20:36.410 --> 01:20:36.420 align:start position:0%
um our next presentation is from Walter
 
01:20:38.870 --> 01:20:38.880 align:start position:0%

here
 
01:21:16.370 --> 01:21:16.380 align:start position:0%
and uh I guess as I'm listening to the
 
01:21:18.770 --> 01:21:18.780 align:start position:0%
earlier testimony I'm sort of reminded
 
01:21:21.770 --> 01:21:21.780 align:start position:0%
of of where I've been actually I want to
 
01:21:26.390 --> 01:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:28.430 --> 01:21:28.440 align:start position:0%
hit the button for them they're coming
 
01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:29.290 align:start position:0%
hit the button for them they're coming
up

01:21:29.290 --> 01:21:29.300 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:21:32.630 --> 01:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
your slide is looking good yeah I know I
 
01:21:37.070 --> 01:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:42.709 --> 01:21:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:44.270 --> 01:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
get rid of that
 
01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:46.550 align:start position:0%
get rid of that
yes

01:21:46.550 --> 01:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:21:48.169 --> 01:21:48.179 align:start position:0%
like I'm not sure I really need to go
 
01:21:50.110 --> 01:21:50.120 align:start position:0%
beyond my first sentence
 
01:21:54.110 --> 01:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
which is the it's my my favorite quote
 
01:21:56.209 --> 01:21:56.219 align:start position:0%
from the U.S Supreme Court Justice
 
01:21:58.010 --> 01:21:58.020 align:start position:0%
Oliver Wendell Holmes and
 
01:21:59.810 --> 01:21:59.820 align:start position:0%
the longer history I live the more I
 
01:22:02.450 --> 01:22:02.460 align:start position:0%
realize this is this is this is true
 
01:22:05.270 --> 01:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
um that the history here
 
01:22:11.090 --> 01:22:11.100 align:start position:0%
uh and the logic uh are not exactly on
 
01:22:12.290 --> 01:22:12.300 align:start position:0%
the same page and I think it's really
 
01:22:13.790 --> 01:22:13.800 align:start position:0%
important to understand how we got to
 
01:22:14.890 --> 01:22:14.900 align:start position:0%
where we are
 
01:22:19.729 --> 01:22:19.739 align:start position:0%
why we're here and uh you know maybe
 
01:22:22.250 --> 01:22:22.260 align:start position:0%
what's the right way to approach this
 
01:22:24.350 --> 01:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
and I want to say another thing these
 
01:22:25.790 --> 01:22:25.800 align:start position:0%
are things I've been doing this for so
 
01:22:28.370 --> 01:22:28.380 align:start position:0%
long that I you know I've said to
 
01:22:29.689 --> 01:22:29.699 align:start position:0%
somebody else earlier that you know when
 
01:22:31.130 --> 01:22:31.140 align:start position:0%
I get a call
 
01:22:31.140 --> 01:22:31.910 align:start position:0%
I get a call
um

01:22:31.910 --> 01:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:33.410 --> 01:22:33.420 align:start position:0%
a professor would you like to be an
 
01:22:34.790 --> 01:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
expert witness I mean I've done I've
 
01:22:36.110 --> 01:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
argued before The Supreme Court I've
 
01:22:37.669 --> 01:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
represented clients and at this point I
 
01:22:38.750 --> 01:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
say well
 
01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:39.470 align:start position:0%
say well
um

01:22:39.470 --> 01:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:42.110 --> 01:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
you know what am I going to say when I'm
 
01:22:44.390 --> 01:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
you know testifying under oath
 
01:22:47.030 --> 01:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
and uh I'm asked on cross-examination
 
01:22:48.649 --> 01:22:48.659 align:start position:0%
well Professor didn't you say something
 
01:22:50.090 --> 01:22:50.100 align:start position:0%
a little bit different in your Treatise
 
01:22:51.830 --> 01:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
and I said oh yes your honor but I think
 
01:22:55.370 --> 01:22:55.380 align:start position:0%
better for money oh the point I'm I'm
 
01:22:58.370 --> 01:22:58.380 align:start position:0%
really here I'm hoping sir I don't you
 
01:23:01.250 --> 01:23:01.260 align:start position:0%
know I think this is a complicated issue
 
01:23:04.189 --> 01:23:04.199 align:start position:0%
um there are we've already heard two two
 
01:23:05.810 --> 01:23:05.820 align:start position:0%
sides to this issue but I really believe
 
01:23:07.189 --> 01:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
that one thing that may be very
 
01:23:10.669 --> 01:23:10.679 align:start position:0%
informative and I realize you know my
 
01:23:12.649 --> 01:23:12.659 align:start position:0%
time will be up pretty soon is just to
 
01:23:13.930 --> 01:23:13.940 align:start position:0%
go through that history without
 
01:23:16.010 --> 01:23:16.020 align:start position:0%
completely repeating what everybody said
 
01:23:18.050 --> 01:23:18.060 align:start position:0%
but just to understand how we got to
 
01:23:21.970 --> 01:23:21.980 align:start position:0%
where we are and what we might do given
 
01:23:27.110 --> 01:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:28.370 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:23:28.370 --> 01:23:28.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:30.530 --> 01:23:30.540 align:start position:0%
the history it is the history that you
 
01:23:32.270 --> 01:23:32.280 align:start position:0%
know that I think many of us sitting
 
01:23:33.770 --> 01:23:33.780 align:start position:0%
around this table looking at gray hair
 
01:23:38.390 --> 01:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
are familiar with uh you know is that
 
01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:39.169 align:start position:0%
are familiar with uh you know is that
um

01:23:39.169 --> 01:23:39.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:42.950 --> 01:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
the the very notion of combined
 
01:23:46.310 --> 01:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
reporting both on a domestic and a
 
01:23:48.830 --> 01:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
global basis
 
01:23:50.810 --> 01:23:50.820 align:start position:0%
was you know was something that
 
01:23:52.189 --> 01:23:52.199 align:start position:0%
developed over the years in fact again
 
01:23:54.890 --> 01:23:54.900 align:start position:0%
we take we take a step back when
 
01:23:56.870 --> 01:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
everybody thought that
 
01:23:59.270 --> 01:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
a separate entity meant
 
01:24:02.570 --> 01:24:02.580 align:start position:0%
they work to be respected fully and not
 
01:24:04.430 --> 01:24:04.440 align:start position:0%
uh you know don't tamper with what the
 
01:24:07.370 --> 01:24:07.380 align:start position:0%
lawyers did don't tamper with where the
 
01:24:10.250 --> 01:24:10.260 align:start position:0%
uh separate entity may be best based
 
01:24:12.530 --> 01:24:12.540 align:start position:0%
whether it's in Delaware with a nice tax
 
01:24:14.450 --> 01:24:14.460 align:start position:0%
Haven or in Ireland if you want to do it
 
01:24:14.460 --> 01:24:16.310 align:start position:0%
Haven or in Ireland if you want to do it
globally

01:24:16.310 --> 01:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
globally
 
01:24:20.990 --> 01:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
um and the standard for deciding where
 
01:24:23.750 --> 01:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
income is earned was something that we
 
01:24:25.430 --> 01:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
all I think familiar with particularly
 
01:24:27.950 --> 01:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
at the federal level the arms length
 
01:24:30.350 --> 01:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
separate accounting standard well again
 
01:24:32.630 --> 01:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
to sort of fast forward I think we all
 
01:24:35.090 --> 01:24:35.100 align:start position:0%
know that the States before we even got
 
01:24:38.090 --> 01:24:38.100 align:start position:0%
to worldwide combined reporting
 
01:24:40.310 --> 01:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
um they quickly understood first of all
 
01:24:41.510 --> 01:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
they understood that formulary
 
01:24:45.410 --> 01:24:45.420 align:start position:0%
apportionment rather than uh arm's
 
01:24:48.169 --> 01:24:48.179 align:start position:0%
length separate accounting was the
 
01:24:50.510 --> 01:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate way to approach this and
 
01:24:53.390 --> 01:24:53.400 align:start position:0%
again for much of my life I go over to
 
01:24:55.430 --> 01:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
Europe and I I was explaining to the
 
01:24:57.950 --> 01:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
oecd Jeffrey Owens who's you know good
 
01:25:01.070 --> 01:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
friend of mine chairman of the the tax
 
01:25:03.649 --> 01:25:03.659 align:start position:0%
part of the oecd explaining we'd have
 
01:25:05.750 --> 01:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
debates formulary apportionment versus
 
01:25:07.850 --> 01:25:07.860 align:start position:0%
separate accounting and I would explain
 
01:25:09.470 --> 01:25:09.480 align:start position:0%
the history of formulary apportionment
 
01:25:11.390 --> 01:25:11.400 align:start position:0%
and why maybe it made more sense because
 
01:25:13.310 --> 01:25:13.320 align:start position:0%
that meant that businesses couldn't just
 
01:25:15.530 --> 01:25:15.540 align:start position:0%
put their entity in particular
 
01:25:18.890 --> 01:25:18.900 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction and pay fewer taxes and he
 
01:25:20.030 --> 01:25:20.040 align:start position:0%
would say look this is the global
 
01:25:22.729 --> 01:25:22.739 align:start position:0%
standard everybody understands its arm's
 
01:25:24.890 --> 01:25:24.900 align:start position:0%
length pricing and it works pretty well
 
01:25:26.510 --> 01:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
again let's fast forward then through
 
01:25:29.030 --> 01:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
the through the fact that the states all
 
01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:30.590 align:start position:0%
the through the fact that the states all
developed

01:25:30.590 --> 01:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
developed
 
01:25:33.229 --> 01:25:33.239 align:start position:0%
adopted embrace the notion that
 
01:25:35.930 --> 01:25:35.940 align:start position:0%
formulary a portion we do it by formula
 
01:25:37.970 --> 01:25:37.980 align:start position:0%
we don't try to pretend that if I sell
 
01:25:40.010 --> 01:25:40.020 align:start position:0%
something from New York into New Jersey
 
01:25:42.110 --> 01:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
we're going to figure out what would be
 
01:25:44.270 --> 01:25:44.280 align:start position:0%
the if you had two unrelated entities
 
01:25:46.189 --> 01:25:46.199 align:start position:0%
what would be the price of that sale we
 
01:25:48.830 --> 01:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
we put them all together fine and then
 
01:25:51.709 --> 01:25:51.719 align:start position:0%
we get to the point of the mid-1970s and
 
01:25:55.790 --> 01:25:55.800 align:start position:0%
the 1990s when it's states started to
 
01:25:57.649 --> 01:25:57.659 align:start position:0%
realize that wait a minute
 
01:26:00.290 --> 01:26:00.300 align:start position:0%
as the universe expanded
 
01:26:04.790 --> 01:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
um the system we have some nationally
 
01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:05.810 align:start position:0%
um the system we have some nationally
um

01:26:05.810 --> 01:26:05.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:09.169 --> 01:26:09.179 align:start position:0%
or at least the system we have uh you
 
01:26:10.550 --> 01:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
know within the states the formulary
 
01:26:12.350 --> 01:26:12.360 align:start position:0%
apportionment that everybody accepted by
 
01:26:13.669 --> 01:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
the you know there was no question about
 
01:26:16.430 --> 01:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
that by the 1950s they didn't have or 60
 
01:26:18.350 --> 01:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
States didn't have arms line separate
 
01:26:20.209 --> 01:26:20.219 align:start position:0%
accounting but now the question is how
 
01:26:22.070 --> 01:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
far does that go when you're dealing
 
01:26:23.870 --> 01:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
with lots of related corporations and
 
01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:24.890 align:start position:0%
with lots of related corporations and
again

01:26:24.890 --> 01:26:24.900 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:26:26.689 --> 01:26:26.699 align:start position:0%
not to you know repeat too much
 
01:26:28.669 --> 01:26:28.679 align:start position:0%
everybody knows about container that was
 
01:26:31.250 --> 01:26:31.260 align:start position:0%
the sort of them and I think one thing I
 
01:26:32.750 --> 01:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to point out I look through there
 
01:26:36.110 --> 01:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
the if you look at the the dates of the
 
01:26:38.090 --> 01:26:38.100 align:start position:0%
cases that actually litigated this the
 
01:26:43.090 --> 01:26:43.100 align:start position:0%
dates were 1983 for container and 1994
 
01:26:43.100 --> 01:26:44.890 align:start position:0%
dates were 1983 for container and 1994
for

01:26:44.890 --> 01:26:44.900 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:26:49.129 --> 01:26:49.139 align:start position:0%
Barclays but in fact the actual tax
 
01:26:51.590 --> 01:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
periods were much earlier for example uh
 
01:26:55.250 --> 01:26:55.260 align:start position:0%
the the tax date in Barclays was 1977.
 
01:26:58.070 --> 01:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
so the point is in some ways the the
 
01:26:59.990 --> 01:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
universe had already moved by the time
 
01:27:01.430 --> 01:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
the court decided these cases but
 
01:27:04.370 --> 01:27:04.380 align:start position:0%
basically in both container uh you know
 
01:27:07.669 --> 01:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
in the 70s and 80s uh
 
01:27:12.649 --> 01:27:12.659 align:start position:0%
States realize that they should include
 
01:27:14.510 --> 01:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
all related entities that are engaged in
 
01:27:15.950 --> 01:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
a unitary business I don't need to
 
01:27:17.930 --> 01:27:17.940 align:start position:0%
explain that to anybody and we shouldn't
 
01:27:20.810 --> 01:27:20.820 align:start position:0%
just stop because I've happened to set
 
01:27:23.390 --> 01:27:23.400 align:start position:0%
up a a business in the Grand Cayman
 
01:27:26.390 --> 01:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
Islands rather than in Delaware
 
01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:27.110 align:start position:0%
Islands rather than in Delaware
um

01:27:27.110 --> 01:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:28.550 align:start position:0%
um
let's

01:27:28.550 --> 01:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
let's
 
01:27:31.970 --> 01:27:31.980 align:start position:0%
well so the um again the
 
01:27:33.290 --> 01:27:33.300 align:start position:0%
I think we've already heard some of this
 
01:27:36.050 --> 01:27:36.060 align:start position:0%
today uh multinational corporations very
 
01:27:37.610 --> 01:27:37.620 align:start position:0%
understandably said this is going to be
 
01:27:39.770 --> 01:27:39.780 align:start position:0%
this is terrible you're now you're
 
01:27:41.330 --> 01:27:41.340 align:start position:0%
you're putting everything into the same
 
01:27:44.209 --> 01:27:44.219 align:start position:0%
pot we have this well-accepted standard
 
01:27:45.649 --> 01:27:45.659 align:start position:0%
of arms line separate accounting that
 
01:27:46.850 --> 01:27:46.860 align:start position:0%
everybody knows how to deal with at
 
01:27:48.530 --> 01:27:48.540 align:start position:0%
least everybody in the global context
 
01:27:50.510 --> 01:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
and now you're you're creating all these
 
01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:51.830 align:start position:0%
and now you're you're creating all these
problems

01:27:51.830 --> 01:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
problems
 
01:27:52.970 --> 01:27:52.980 align:start position:0%
um you're going to create a risk of
 
01:27:55.550 --> 01:27:55.560 align:start position:0%
international multiple taxation you're
 
01:27:57.530 --> 01:27:57.540 align:start position:0%
going to prevent the United States I'm
 
01:27:59.689 --> 01:27:59.699 align:start position:0%
speaking with one voice remember we're
 
01:28:02.450 --> 01:28:02.460 align:start position:0%
talking sub-nationally globally
 
01:28:04.729 --> 01:28:04.739 align:start position:0%
globally it's honestly in separate
 
01:28:06.530 --> 01:28:06.540 align:start position:0%
accounting and has been but again just
 
01:28:08.149 --> 01:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
to fast forward Beyond My Testimony
 
01:28:10.430 --> 01:28:10.440 align:start position:0%
guess what folks there's a huge debate
 
01:28:14.090 --> 01:28:14.100 align:start position:0%
going on globally about how businesses
 
01:28:16.250 --> 01:28:16.260 align:start position:0%
should be taxed and maybe the arms Lane
 
01:28:19.729 --> 01:28:19.739 align:start position:0%
separate accounting will be maybe along
 
01:28:23.030 --> 01:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
when I'm gone you know buy something a
 
01:28:24.830 --> 01:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
little bit different perhaps what we're
 
01:28:27.169 --> 01:28:27.179 align:start position:0%
talking about now or you have the oecd
 
01:28:29.510 --> 01:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
and the world talking about formulary
 
01:28:32.510 --> 01:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
apportionment for part of a tax base uh
 
01:28:34.850 --> 01:28:34.860 align:start position:0%
and understanding that maybe the the
 
01:28:36.530 --> 01:28:36.540 align:start position:0%
pre-existing arms length separate
 
01:28:40.070 --> 01:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
accounting Norm is you know whether
 
01:28:43.070 --> 01:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
maybe a thing of the past at some point
 
01:28:44.750 --> 01:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
not yet we're still at the position
 
01:28:46.910 --> 01:28:46.920 align:start position:0%
where orange Lane separate accounting is
 
01:28:48.709 --> 01:28:48.719 align:start position:0%
the norm globally but I think it's
 
01:28:49.729 --> 01:28:49.739 align:start position:0%
important to understand this difference
 
01:28:51.530 --> 01:28:51.540 align:start position:0%
what's going on sub-nationally and
 
01:28:54.709 --> 01:28:54.719 align:start position:0%
internationally so when we early on said
 
01:28:56.990 --> 01:28:57.000 align:start position:0%
it was a problem creates the risk of
 
01:28:58.729 --> 01:28:58.739 align:start position:0%
international multiple taxation because
 
01:29:00.410 --> 01:29:00.420 align:start position:0%
states are doing things that are
 
01:29:02.450 --> 01:29:02.460 align:start position:0%
different from what the global community
 
01:29:04.850 --> 01:29:04.860 align:start position:0%
is doing these are arguments that were
 
01:29:08.330 --> 01:29:08.340 align:start position:0%
made I'll keep going here and in
 
01:29:10.310 --> 01:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
container the court looked at that and
 
01:29:11.810 --> 01:29:11.820 align:start position:0%
said you know
 
01:29:11.820 --> 01:29:12.470 align:start position:0%
said you know
um

01:29:12.470 --> 01:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:14.990 --> 01:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
these are good arguments the people who
 
01:29:16.610 --> 01:29:16.620 align:start position:0%
go by the hour make them and they make
 
01:29:18.590 --> 01:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
them well but
 
01:29:20.149 --> 01:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
um the risk of international multiple
 
01:29:22.189 --> 01:29:22.199 align:start position:0%
taxation was not inevitable indeed if
 
01:29:24.129 --> 01:29:24.139 align:start position:0%
you look at different different
 
01:29:26.870 --> 01:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
determinations of the arms lengths
 
01:29:28.250 --> 01:29:28.260 align:start position:0%
price and two different jurisdictions
 
01:29:30.410 --> 01:29:30.420 align:start position:0%
you could have multiple taxation
 
01:29:33.530 --> 01:29:33.540 align:start position:0%
um uh should California give up one
 
01:29:35.030 --> 01:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
method in other words neither is perfect
 
01:29:36.830 --> 01:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
I think that's something that maybe some
 
01:29:38.270 --> 01:29:38.280 align:start position:0%
of the folks behind you are going to be
 
01:29:40.490 --> 01:29:40.500 align:start position:0%
nothing formulary abortionment is not
 
01:29:42.169 --> 01:29:42.179 align:start position:0%
perfect but neither is arms line
 
01:29:43.850 --> 01:29:43.860 align:start position:0%
separate accounting
 
01:29:46.610 --> 01:29:46.620 align:start position:0%
um although again if I'm a tax now
 
01:29:48.169 --> 01:29:48.179 align:start position:0%
billing by the hour and I say yes I'm
 
01:29:49.370 --> 01:29:49.380 align:start position:0%
going to set up just to give you another
 
01:29:51.410 --> 01:29:51.420 align:start position:0%
example of the one I've lived through uh
 
01:29:53.330 --> 01:29:53.340 align:start position:0%
you know you know I like Jeffrey
 
01:29:55.310 --> 01:29:55.320 align:start position:0%
remember Jeffrey the giraffe
 
01:29:58.550 --> 01:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
okay Jeffrey uh you want you went into
 
01:30:00.470 --> 01:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
the Toys R Us and you bought something
 
01:30:02.930 --> 01:30:02.940 align:start position:0%
from Jeffrey and guess what there was
 
01:30:04.610 --> 01:30:04.620 align:start position:0%
um you know money was made including
 
01:30:06.290 --> 01:30:06.300 align:start position:0%
royalties paid for that very nice
 
01:30:08.209 --> 01:30:08.219 align:start position:0%
picture of the giraffe well guess where
 
01:30:11.330 --> 01:30:11.340 align:start position:0%
all the world he's repaid to Delaware
 
01:30:13.970 --> 01:30:13.980 align:start position:0%
Delaware which didn't tax so I've said
 
01:30:15.649 --> 01:30:15.659 align:start position:0%
it was separate subsidiary to make sure
 
01:30:18.470 --> 01:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
that none of the other states could tax
 
01:30:19.790 --> 01:30:19.800 align:start position:0%
a piece of the royalties that wouldn't
 
01:30:22.010 --> 01:30:22.020 align:start position:0%
exist that you hadn't made the sale into
 
01:30:24.229 --> 01:30:24.239 align:start position:0%
the state where they were purchased well
 
01:30:26.689 --> 01:30:26.699 align:start position:0%
we got over that we realized at the
 
01:30:28.550 --> 01:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
subnational level that we can deal with
 
01:30:30.229 --> 01:30:30.239 align:start position:0%
that whether it's through combined
 
01:30:32.149 --> 01:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
reporting or by by the way saying that
 
01:30:35.149 --> 01:30:35.159 align:start position:0%
there's there's Nexus over the the
 
01:30:37.490 --> 01:30:37.500 align:start position:0%
company that is directing all this
 
01:30:39.350 --> 01:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
attention to Toys R Us in the state of
 
01:30:40.729 --> 01:30:40.739 align:start position:0%
Georgia but just
 
01:30:42.530 --> 01:30:42.540 align:start position:0%
moving on
 
01:30:44.689 --> 01:30:44.699 align:start position:0%
um the court rejected the possibility
 
01:30:47.209 --> 01:30:47.219 align:start position:0%
they're real they're not made up there
 
01:30:48.709 --> 01:30:48.719 align:start position:0%
are problems foreign retaliation
 
01:30:50.750 --> 01:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
frustration of federal policy arms think
 
01:30:52.629 --> 01:30:52.639 align:start position:0%
but the court said look
 
01:30:55.370 --> 01:30:55.380 align:start position:0%
this is National we we we're dealing
 
01:30:57.830 --> 01:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
with constitutional issues we don't if
 
01:30:59.570 --> 01:30:59.580 align:start position:0%
Congress tomorrow persuaded by the
 
01:31:01.610 --> 01:31:01.620 align:start position:0%
business Community wants to say that
 
01:31:04.490 --> 01:31:04.500 align:start position:0%
it's a violation of the foreign commerce
 
01:31:07.129 --> 01:31:07.139 align:start position:0%
clause which is congress's power to to
 
01:31:08.810 --> 01:31:08.820 align:start position:0%
have the states do anything other than
 
01:31:10.189 --> 01:31:10.199 align:start position:0%
arm's line separate accounting they can
 
01:31:11.209 --> 01:31:11.219 align:start position:0%
do it
 
01:31:13.790 --> 01:31:13.800 align:start position:0%
but Congress court has to say that so
 
01:31:16.490 --> 01:31:16.500 align:start position:0%
when Barclays again becomes even more uh
 
01:31:19.490 --> 01:31:19.500 align:start position:0%
the case involving a foreign based
 
01:31:21.470 --> 01:31:21.480 align:start position:0%
company not at least containers the U.S
 
01:31:24.290 --> 01:31:24.300 align:start position:0%
company same questions were raised that
 
01:31:27.169 --> 01:31:27.179 align:start position:0%
the uh you know if California can
 
01:31:29.209 --> 01:31:29.219 align:start position:0%
require arm's length separate accounting
 
01:31:32.149 --> 01:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
it's going to create all kinds of havoc
 
01:31:35.030 --> 01:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of how States comply and
 
01:31:36.950 --> 01:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
very expensive and these are not made up
 
01:31:39.229 --> 01:31:39.239 align:start position:0%
at the end of my I'm going to tell you
 
01:31:41.629 --> 01:31:41.639 align:start position:0%
now to skip to my conclusion I'm not
 
01:31:42.950 --> 01:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
coming in on one side or the other but
 
01:31:44.689 --> 01:31:44.699 align:start position:0%
just understand how we got to where we
 
01:31:46.850 --> 01:31:46.860 align:start position:0%
are and why we have this debate and it's
 
01:31:48.590 --> 01:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
a real debate and I'm not sure either
 
01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:50.510 align:start position:0%
a real debate and I'm not sure either
side

01:31:50.510 --> 01:31:50.520 align:start position:0%
side
 
01:31:52.370 --> 01:31:52.380 align:start position:0%
you know I wouldn't take you this hour
 
01:31:54.530 --> 01:31:54.540 align:start position:0%
on a contingency let's put it that way
 
01:31:56.570 --> 01:31:56.580 align:start position:0%
um move on
 
01:31:59.570 --> 01:31:59.580 align:start position:0%
uh okay and Barclays again we all all
 
01:32:00.890 --> 01:32:00.900 align:start position:0%
the issues that are being raised here
 
01:32:04.250 --> 01:32:04.260 align:start position:0%
were addressed by the U.S Supreme Court
 
01:32:06.350 --> 01:32:06.360 align:start position:0%
um and again they dismissed them not
 
01:32:08.629 --> 01:32:08.639 align:start position:0%
because they were frivolous but just
 
01:32:12.410 --> 01:32:12.420 align:start position:0%
because these General requirements that
 
01:32:13.790 --> 01:32:13.800 align:start position:0%
states must abide about they can't
 
01:32:15.350 --> 01:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
discriminate against interstate commerce
 
01:32:17.270 --> 01:32:17.280 align:start position:0%
we can't say in Georgia that anything
 
01:32:19.070 --> 01:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
made in South Carolina that's sold in
 
01:32:22.310 --> 01:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
Georgia is taxable or anything I would
 
01:32:23.870 --> 01:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
probably like to but anything made in
 
01:32:25.610 --> 01:32:25.620 align:start position:0%
Georgia Southern Georgia isn't can't do
 
01:32:25.620 --> 01:32:26.629 align:start position:0%
Georgia Southern Georgia isn't can't do
that

01:32:26.629 --> 01:32:26.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:32:29.090 --> 01:32:29.100 align:start position:0%
um but the point is these General
 
01:32:31.090 --> 01:32:31.100 align:start position:0%
constitutional restraints which are
 
01:32:33.950 --> 01:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
understandable the court said we are we
 
01:32:37.010 --> 01:32:37.020 align:start position:0%
are we cannot we can't impose those
 
01:32:39.530 --> 01:32:39.540 align:start position:0%
sorts of requirements on the states
 
01:32:41.090 --> 01:32:41.100 align:start position:0%
um Congress obviously has the power to
 
01:32:41.990 --> 01:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
do that
 
01:32:43.669 --> 01:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
keep going
 
01:32:45.830 --> 01:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
um then what happened and here's my page
 
01:32:47.450 --> 01:32:47.460 align:start position:0%
of History right so the U.S Supreme
 
01:32:49.850 --> 01:32:49.860 align:start position:0%
Court says you know there are issues
 
01:32:52.970 --> 01:32:52.980 align:start position:0%
here but we think the states are acting
 
01:32:55.129 --> 01:32:55.139 align:start position:0%
reasonably at least they're acting
 
01:32:59.390 --> 01:32:59.400 align:start position:0%
within constitutional parameters to be
 
01:33:01.189 --> 01:33:01.199 align:start position:0%
doing what they're doing
 
01:33:03.590 --> 01:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
and to have not just
 
01:33:07.970 --> 01:33:07.980 align:start position:0%
combination but worldwide combination
 
01:33:10.550 --> 01:33:10.560 align:start position:0%
if someone can show that this worldwide
 
01:33:10.560 --> 01:33:11.990 align:start position:0%
if someone can show that this worldwide
combination

01:33:11.990 --> 01:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
combination
 
01:33:14.450 --> 01:33:14.460 align:start position:0%
imposes a tax that's out of complete
 
01:33:15.830 --> 01:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
proportion to what's going on in the
 
01:33:18.709 --> 01:33:18.719 align:start position:0%
state taxpayer wins because that
 
01:33:20.149 --> 01:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
violates the Commerce Clause and
 
01:33:21.830 --> 01:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
probably they do Process Clause but to
 
01:33:24.050 --> 01:33:24.060 align:start position:0%
say as a general principle that states
 
01:33:26.390 --> 01:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
can't do whatever the federal government
 
01:33:27.709 --> 01:33:27.719 align:start position:0%
has done
 
01:33:30.290 --> 01:33:30.300 align:start position:0%
under federal law that we're not in a
 
01:33:31.910 --> 01:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
position to do anything about it so now
 
01:33:34.790 --> 01:33:34.800 align:start position:0%
let's get to where we are now
 
01:33:38.030 --> 01:33:38.040 align:start position:0%
we after after container what happened
 
01:33:40.490 --> 01:33:40.500 align:start position:0%
and here I the best thing I could do I
 
01:33:42.110 --> 01:33:42.120 align:start position:0%
hadn't looked at this through this on my
 
01:33:44.209 --> 01:33:44.219 align:start position:0%
shelf haven't read this stuff for
 
01:33:46.010 --> 01:33:46.020 align:start position:0%
hold it up to the people on the screen
 
01:33:49.189 --> 01:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
too this is the final report of the
 
01:33:51.530 --> 01:33:51.540 align:start position:0%
worldwide unitary
 
01:33:54.610 --> 01:33:54.620 align:start position:0%
unitary taxation working group August
 
01:33:57.229 --> 01:33:57.239 align:start position:0%
1984 right time flies when you're having
 
01:33:57.239 --> 01:33:58.430 align:start position:0%
1984 right time flies when you're having
fun

01:33:58.430 --> 01:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
fun
 
01:34:02.510 --> 01:34:02.520 align:start position:0%
um and by the way remember this was 84.
 
01:34:06.010 --> 01:34:06.020 align:start position:0%
container was 83. this is one year after
 
01:34:10.370 --> 01:34:10.380 align:start position:0%
container and long before Barclays and
 
01:34:13.250 --> 01:34:13.260 align:start position:0%
there there is a and again I don't have
 
01:34:14.689 --> 01:34:14.699 align:start position:0%
three hours but I think this is
 
01:34:18.290 --> 01:34:18.300 align:start position:0%
something worth reading bottom line
 
01:34:19.610 --> 01:34:19.620 align:start position:0%
um the
 
01:34:19.620 --> 01:34:21.110 align:start position:0%
um the
the

01:34:21.110 --> 01:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:34:23.149 --> 01:34:23.159 align:start position:0%
world this group which was a federally
 
01:34:25.850 --> 01:34:25.860 align:start position:0%
created group under Ronald Reagan
 
01:34:25.860 --> 01:34:26.629 align:start position:0%
created group under Ronald Reagan
um

01:34:26.629 --> 01:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:28.910 --> 01:34:28.920 align:start position:0%
said we really need to deal with this
 
01:34:28.920 --> 01:34:30.229 align:start position:0%
said we really need to deal with this
problem

01:34:30.229 --> 01:34:30.239 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:34:32.090 --> 01:34:32.100 align:start position:0%
through Federal legislation and that
 
01:34:33.649 --> 01:34:33.659 align:start position:0%
that makes sense right Court said we're
 
01:34:34.910 --> 01:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
not going to do anything so what are you
 
01:34:35.990 --> 01:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
going to do you got to you go to the
 
01:34:39.110 --> 01:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
legislature what should happen is this
 
01:34:40.910 --> 01:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
Water's Edge we should have we should
 
01:34:42.850 --> 01:34:42.860 align:start position:0%
have Water's Edge combination that means
 
01:34:44.870 --> 01:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
combination's fine we're not rejecting
 
01:34:48.229 --> 01:34:48.239 align:start position:0%
that but if you're if one of the
 
01:34:50.830 --> 01:34:50.840 align:start position:0%
entities does much of its business
 
01:34:54.890 --> 01:34:54.900 align:start position:0%
abroad 80 80 percent
 
01:34:56.930 --> 01:34:56.940 align:start position:0%
they're they're not going to be you
 
01:34:58.430 --> 01:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
shouldn't really include them because it
 
01:34:59.510 --> 01:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
creates a lot of the problems we've
 
01:35:01.610 --> 01:35:01.620 align:start position:0%
heard the business Community talk about
 
01:35:03.890 --> 01:35:03.900 align:start position:0%
um what we also should have is increased
 
01:35:05.390 --> 01:35:05.400 align:start position:0%
federal administrative cooperation with
 
01:35:07.430 --> 01:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
the states let's all work together
 
01:35:08.990 --> 01:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
states in the federal government to
 
01:35:11.450 --> 01:35:11.460 align:start position:0%
create a nice good system nationally and
 
01:35:11.460 --> 01:35:12.950 align:start position:0%
create a nice good system nationally and
sub-nationally

01:35:12.950 --> 01:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
sub-nationally
 
01:35:14.930 --> 01:35:14.940 align:start position:0%
um and let's have competitive balance we
 
01:35:16.430 --> 01:35:16.440 align:start position:0%
don't want to you know foreign
 
01:35:17.990 --> 01:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
multinational shouldn't should be
 
01:35:20.629 --> 01:35:20.639 align:start position:0%
treated no no better no worse than
 
01:35:22.850 --> 01:35:22.860 align:start position:0%
purely domestic businesses
 
01:35:24.890 --> 01:35:24.900 align:start position:0%
um and of course guess what there is a
 
01:35:27.229 --> 01:35:27.239 align:start position:0%
failure to to re to reach agreement no
 
01:35:28.610 --> 01:35:28.620 align:start position:0%
big surprise
 
01:35:30.470 --> 01:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
and by the way I have to
 
01:35:33.229 --> 01:35:33.239 align:start position:0%
um I was in 1985 I just
 
01:35:37.850 --> 01:35:37.860 align:start position:0%
um uh again the the 84 report says uh
 
01:35:39.590 --> 01:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
States should adopt
 
01:35:42.890 --> 01:35:42.900 align:start position:0%
um legislation uh but there is a certain
 
01:35:44.629 --> 01:35:44.639 align:start position:0%
uncertainty about this I thought one
 
01:35:45.709 --> 01:35:45.719 align:start position:0%
thing that was very interesting and I
 
01:35:46.870 --> 01:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
don't know how many of you remember
 
01:35:50.090 --> 01:35:50.100 align:start position:0%
Byron L dorgan who is a senator from
 
01:35:52.330 --> 01:35:52.340 align:start position:0%
North Dakota and North Dakota was a very
 
01:35:56.450 --> 01:35:56.460 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of Taxation it was I would
 
01:35:59.629 --> 01:35:59.639 align:start position:0%
say I don't know uh it was on the front
 
01:36:02.209 --> 01:36:02.219 align:start position:0%
end of doing what states might be
 
01:36:04.430 --> 01:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
businesses might complain about them and
 
01:36:06.410 --> 01:36:06.420 align:start position:0%
dorgan wanted to know because he kind of
 
01:36:07.669 --> 01:36:07.679 align:start position:0%
liked what he saw
 
01:36:10.010 --> 01:36:10.020 align:start position:0%
he said uh
 
01:36:12.830 --> 01:36:12.840 align:start position:0%
dude I just remember the response from
 
01:36:14.450 --> 01:36:14.460 align:start position:0%
the GAO the government kind of this
 
01:36:16.070 --> 01:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
request this report responds to your
 
01:36:17.990 --> 01:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
request for information on California's
 
01:36:20.030 --> 01:36:20.040 align:start position:0%
experience in conducting formulary
 
01:36:21.050 --> 01:36:21.060 align:start position:0%
enforcement of multinational
 
01:36:23.090 --> 01:36:23.100 align:start position:0%
corporations and issues that would have
 
01:36:25.010 --> 01:36:25.020 align:start position:0%
to be considered before adopting a
 
01:36:27.830 --> 01:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
formulary system at the federal level
 
01:36:29.510 --> 01:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
you know some people in the federal
 
01:36:31.010 --> 01:36:31.020 align:start position:0%
government thought what the states are
 
01:36:33.110 --> 01:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
doing makes a lot of sense why arms Lane
 
01:36:34.370 --> 01:36:34.380 align:start position:0%
separate accounting formulary
 
01:36:36.890 --> 01:36:36.900 align:start position:0%
apportionment understands you got to an
 
01:36:40.010 --> 01:36:40.020 align:start position:0%
economic unit and maybe we should assign
 
01:36:41.629 --> 01:36:41.639 align:start position:0%
this based on
 
01:36:45.169 --> 01:36:45.179 align:start position:0%
where the activity takes place under the
 
01:36:46.729 --> 01:36:46.739 align:start position:0%
state system would have been a where
 
01:36:48.950 --> 01:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
your people are your property is or your
 
01:36:50.810 --> 01:36:50.820 align:start position:0%
payroll where your where your where your
 
01:36:53.090 --> 01:36:53.100 align:start position:0%
people are labor or your property is
 
01:36:55.970 --> 01:36:55.980 align:start position:0%
capital and where your sales are that
 
01:36:57.350 --> 01:36:57.360 align:start position:0%
was the notion that is the notion under
 
01:36:59.149 --> 01:36:59.159 align:start position:0%
the three-factor formula well what's
 
01:37:00.890 --> 01:37:00.900 align:start position:0%
happened since then again
 
01:37:02.750 --> 01:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
I think maybe even though I may not be
 
01:37:04.010 --> 01:37:04.020 align:start position:0%
talking directly about a lot of this
 
01:37:06.050 --> 01:37:06.060 align:start position:0%
stuff this is really relevant a lot of
 
01:37:07.910 --> 01:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
things have happened first of all
 
01:37:10.850 --> 01:37:10.860 align:start position:0%
in response to let's just get the
 
01:37:13.370 --> 01:37:13.380 align:start position:0%
response to the to the working group
 
01:37:13.380 --> 01:37:15.530 align:start position:0%
response to the to the working group
um

01:37:15.530 --> 01:37:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:17.510 --> 01:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
and that's why we're here
 
01:37:20.570 --> 01:37:20.580 align:start position:0%
um in in response to the threat of
 
01:37:23.330 --> 01:37:23.340 align:start position:0%
federal legislation state after state
 
01:37:26.750 --> 01:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
after State basically repealed or
 
01:37:30.169 --> 01:37:30.179 align:start position:0%
limited worldwide combined reporting
 
01:37:32.330 --> 01:37:32.340 align:start position:0%
um and I'll get to the this is the this
 
01:37:34.430 --> 01:37:34.440 align:start position:0%
is the key key slide right with the
 
01:37:37.129 --> 01:37:37.139 align:start position:0%
highlight of New Hampshire
 
01:37:40.010 --> 01:37:40.020 align:start position:0%
um they all essentially depending on
 
01:37:41.270 --> 01:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
what side of the street you're on you
 
01:37:43.729 --> 01:37:43.739 align:start position:0%
know they caved in to the pressure from
 
01:37:45.110 --> 01:37:45.120 align:start position:0%
whether it's Japan or the federal
 
01:37:47.270 --> 01:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
government or good business lobbyists
 
01:37:50.629 --> 01:37:50.639 align:start position:0%
and they all with a very few exceptions
 
01:37:52.610 --> 01:37:52.620 align:start position:0%
uh adopted
 
01:37:56.570 --> 01:37:56.580 align:start position:0%
legislation that restrained worldwide
 
01:37:59.270 --> 01:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
combined reporting was this a matter of
 
01:38:01.930 --> 01:38:01.940 align:start position:0%
you know thoughtful academic
 
01:38:04.010 --> 01:38:04.020 align:start position:0%
determination no I think it was a it was
 
01:38:07.189 --> 01:38:07.199 align:start position:0%
it was lobbying there were real issues
 
01:38:09.050 --> 01:38:09.060 align:start position:0%
um but I think that's to where that's
 
01:38:12.169 --> 01:38:12.179 align:start position:0%
whereby by by 19 you know interesting by
 
01:38:15.649 --> 01:38:15.659 align:start position:0%
1991 all states had adopted Waters Edge
 
01:38:18.709 --> 01:38:18.719 align:start position:0%
legislation I think someone ironically
 
01:38:22.729 --> 01:38:22.739 align:start position:0%
it was in 1993 that the
 
01:38:26.090 --> 01:38:26.100 align:start position:0%
Court in Barclays actually addressed the
 
01:38:28.070 --> 01:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
constitutionality of what the states
 
01:38:30.110 --> 01:38:30.120 align:start position:0%
have been doing in the past but we're
 
01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:31.310 align:start position:0%
have been doing in the past but we're
now

01:38:31.310 --> 01:38:31.320 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:38:33.350 --> 01:38:33.360 align:start position:0%
um had now voluntarily and I put that in
 
01:38:35.450 --> 01:38:35.460 align:start position:0%
quotes decided
 
01:38:37.490 --> 01:38:37.500 align:start position:0%
um they did not did not want to do and
 
01:38:41.030 --> 01:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
again I want to get uh get get get back
 
01:38:42.290 --> 01:38:42.300 align:start position:0%
to where
 
01:38:44.149 --> 01:38:44.159 align:start position:0%
um you know where we are now and then
 
01:38:47.450 --> 01:38:47.460 align:start position:0%
take any questions I hope some uh as to
 
01:38:48.830 --> 01:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
what what we might do and there's one
 
01:38:51.709 --> 01:38:51.719 align:start position:0%
other thing I want to refer to again the
 
01:38:54.470 --> 01:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
the states basically adopted no the
 
01:38:56.030 --> 01:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
state's abandoned worldwide combination
 
01:38:57.770 --> 01:38:57.780 align:start position:0%
for reasons that I've suggested I think
 
01:39:00.050 --> 01:39:00.060 align:start position:0%
largely for political reasons not that
 
01:39:02.390 --> 01:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
not that the political arguments are all
 
01:39:04.550 --> 01:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
nonsense but just that that was they
 
01:39:06.350 --> 01:39:06.360 align:start position:0%
were motivated by that rather than I
 
01:39:09.169 --> 01:39:09.179 align:start position:0%
think saying what's the best way indeed
 
01:39:10.550 --> 01:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
if the federal government had listened
 
01:39:12.229 --> 01:39:12.239 align:start position:0%
to Byron dorgan maybe we would all have
 
01:39:13.610 --> 01:39:13.620 align:start position:0%
formulary apportionment at the national
 
01:39:15.110 --> 01:39:15.120 align:start position:0%
level and wouldn't be talking about this
 
01:39:16.669 --> 01:39:16.679 align:start position:0%
and by the way just to say this again
 
01:39:18.770 --> 01:39:18.780 align:start position:0%
International level they're thinking
 
01:39:20.629 --> 01:39:20.639 align:start position:0%
about that right formulary apportionment
 
01:39:22.729 --> 01:39:22.739 align:start position:0%
is now part of the global
 
01:39:24.290 --> 01:39:24.300 align:start position:0%
pillow I know how many people know
 
01:39:26.390 --> 01:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
pillar one pillar two how we should
 
01:39:28.729 --> 01:39:28.739 align:start position:0%
apportion income at the global level and
 
01:39:29.930 --> 01:39:29.940 align:start position:0%
there's a big debate about that
 
01:39:31.490 --> 01:39:31.500 align:start position:0%
including that market States ought to
 
01:39:33.410 --> 01:39:33.420 align:start position:0%
get a piece of the piece of the of the
 
01:39:35.209 --> 01:39:35.219 align:start position:0%
pie as it were even if you're not doing
 
01:39:37.070 --> 01:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
if you're not physically there so maybe
 
01:39:40.189 --> 01:39:40.199 align:start position:0%
if and pillar two how you know how do we
 
01:39:41.750 --> 01:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
really how do we deal with all these
 
01:39:43.970 --> 01:39:43.980 align:start position:0%
problems and finally
 
01:39:46.610 --> 01:39:46.620 align:start position:0%
now I I come back to where I sort of
 
01:39:46.620 --> 01:39:47.870 align:start position:0%
now I I come back to where I sort of
started

01:39:47.870 --> 01:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
started
 
01:39:50.629 --> 01:39:50.639 align:start position:0%
um the the rush for for you know to
 
01:39:52.250 --> 01:39:52.260 align:start position:0%
restrict combined reporting didn't grow
 
01:39:54.530 --> 01:39:54.540 align:start position:0%
out of the philosophical conversion from
 
01:39:55.910 --> 01:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
formulary apportionment to severity
 
01:39:57.470 --> 01:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
accounting you know I think they yielded
 
01:39:59.510 --> 01:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
to economic and political pressures
 
01:40:01.310 --> 01:40:01.320 align:start position:0%
which may be
 
01:40:03.649 --> 01:40:03.659 align:start position:0%
somewhat legitimate but I think that's
 
01:40:05.570 --> 01:40:05.580 align:start position:0%
that's really where we are today and I
 
01:40:06.890 --> 01:40:06.900 align:start position:0%
think it's important to hear obviously
 
01:40:09.050 --> 01:40:09.060 align:start position:0%
for both sides but also maybe maybe from
 
01:40:10.610 --> 01:40:10.620 align:start position:0%
the middle and here's what I want to end
 
01:40:10.620 --> 01:40:12.050 align:start position:0%
the middle and here's what I want to end
with

01:40:12.050 --> 01:40:12.060 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:40:13.850 --> 01:40:13.860 align:start position:0%
leaving maybe too much time for
 
01:40:15.410 --> 01:40:15.420 align:start position:0%
questions but I thought as I was going
 
01:40:16.910 --> 01:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
through my files that's what I do these
 
01:40:19.250 --> 01:40:19.260 align:start position:0%
days uh in some way almost one of the
 
01:40:21.770 --> 01:40:21.780 align:start position:0%
most interesting pieces of documents
 
01:40:23.689 --> 01:40:23.699 align:start position:0%
that I think everybody should read uh
 
01:40:26.750 --> 01:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
how not how many here know about the the
 
01:40:30.410 --> 01:40:30.420 align:start position:0%
combined reporting study of Indiana
 
01:40:32.750 --> 01:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
anybody familiar with that okay
 
01:40:35.629 --> 01:40:35.639 align:start position:0%
um it's because Indiana
 
01:40:37.790 --> 01:40:37.800 align:start position:0%
in October 2016 and what's good about
 
01:40:40.910 --> 01:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
this this is a this is a more you know
 
01:40:43.490 --> 01:40:43.500 align:start position:0%
we're 20 years later when the Universe I
 
01:40:44.990 --> 01:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
think is that we live in is more
 
01:40:48.350 --> 01:40:48.360 align:start position:0%
understandable and they wanted to
 
01:40:50.629 --> 01:40:50.639 align:start position:0%
consider since Indiana was they were
 
01:40:53.149 --> 01:40:53.159 align:start position:0%
just definitely unlike most States they
 
01:40:56.270 --> 01:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
didn't even use combined reporting it's
 
01:40:58.910 --> 01:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
separate company reporting and what this
 
01:41:00.830 --> 01:41:00.840 align:start position:0%
study does
 
01:41:06.229 --> 01:41:06.239 align:start position:0%
it analyzes the costs and benefits of
 
01:41:07.610 --> 01:41:07.620 align:start position:0%
combined reporting and that's I think
 
01:41:09.950 --> 01:41:09.960 align:start position:0%
what we that's what you guys need to do
 
01:41:11.689 --> 01:41:11.699 align:start position:0%
what are the obviously some costs and
 
01:41:13.370 --> 01:41:13.380 align:start position:0%
there are obviously some benefits and I
 
01:41:13.380 --> 01:41:14.350 align:start position:0%
there are obviously some benefits and I
think

01:41:14.350 --> 01:41:14.360 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:41:17.450 --> 01:41:17.460 align:start position:0%
the answer is not clear
 
01:41:19.070 --> 01:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
um I'm just going I'll just read your
 
01:41:22.550 --> 01:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
part the executive summary is uh while
 
01:41:24.410 --> 01:41:24.420 align:start position:0%
combined reporting neutralizes several
 
01:41:25.790 --> 01:41:25.800 align:start position:0%
planning strategies like the use of
 
01:41:27.410 --> 01:41:27.420 align:start position:0%
intellectual property holding companies
 
01:41:29.530 --> 01:41:29.540 align:start position:0%
transfer pricing to captive real estate
 
01:41:31.790 --> 01:41:31.800 align:start position:0%
captive for good it could also create
 
01:41:33.290 --> 01:41:33.300 align:start position:0%
different complexities in the
 
01:41:35.390 --> 01:41:35.400 align:start position:0%
determination of the unitary group
 
01:41:36.530 --> 01:41:36.540 align:start position:0%
um again I'm not going to read them all
 
01:41:37.910 --> 01:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
to you I just wanted to get to the I
 
01:41:40.129 --> 01:41:40.139 align:start position:0%
mean I think the the the the ultimate
 
01:41:40.139 --> 01:41:41.750 align:start position:0%
mean I think the the the the ultimate
conclusion

01:41:41.750 --> 01:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
conclusion
 
01:41:43.669 --> 01:41:43.679 align:start position:0%
and this is what I maybe where I'm going
 
01:41:45.709 --> 01:41:45.719 align:start position:0%
to end for the moment yeah we use
 
01:41:48.530 --> 01:41:48.540 align:start position:0%
economic techniques to examine how state
 
01:41:50.510 --> 01:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
tax policies including combined
 
01:41:53.209 --> 01:41:53.219 align:start position:0%
reporting influence state corporate
 
01:41:55.550 --> 01:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
income tax revenue this method controls
 
01:41:57.890 --> 01:41:57.900 align:start position:0%
for variation of the tax base related to
 
01:41:59.510 --> 01:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
the economic cycle and other tax
 
01:42:01.910 --> 01:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
policies and the impact from combined
 
01:42:04.270 --> 01:42:04.280 align:start position:0%
reporting the economic results suggest
 
01:42:07.010 --> 01:42:07.020 align:start position:0%
that combine that combined reporting may
 
01:42:09.470 --> 01:42:09.480 align:start position:0%
have an initial positive impact on
 
01:42:11.930 --> 01:42:11.940 align:start position:0%
corporate income tax revenue but that
 
01:42:14.390 --> 01:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
this impact is not lasting we estimate
 
01:42:16.550 --> 01:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
that the positive initial positive
 
01:42:18.109 --> 01:42:18.119 align:start position:0%
impact could potentially be economically
 
01:42:19.970 --> 01:42:19.980 align:start position:0%
significant however we also estimate
 
01:42:21.890 --> 01:42:21.900 align:start position:0%
that the impact will only be short-term
 
01:42:23.750 --> 01:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
and will decline to zero in the long run
 
01:42:26.570 --> 01:42:26.580 align:start position:0%
so again I'm not weighing in on that but
 
01:42:29.270 --> 01:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
I just think what everybody around this
 
01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
table ought to do is read look at the
 
01:42:33.590 --> 01:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
history and again I think this 2016
 
01:42:35.689 --> 01:42:35.699 align:start position:0%
report is pretty interesting because
 
01:42:37.310 --> 01:42:37.320 align:start position:0%
that's just saying should Indiana even
 
01:42:39.050 --> 01:42:39.060 align:start position:0%
just go to combined reporting
 
01:42:40.850 --> 01:42:40.860 align:start position:0%
and as I say at the end of testimony
 
01:42:42.590 --> 01:42:42.600 align:start position:0%
when I used to give it further Affy and
 
01:42:47.870 --> 01:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:50.689 --> 01:42:50.699 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
 
01:42:53.030 --> 01:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
can you send us a link to that study the
 
01:42:55.550 --> 01:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
Indiana one oh yeah yeah I mean and the
 
01:42:58.010 --> 01:42:58.020 align:start position:0%
1984 working group well oh well this
 
01:42:59.689 --> 01:42:59.699 align:start position:0%
okay yeah sure I can send you links to
 
01:43:02.450 --> 01:43:02.460 align:start position:0%
to everything yeah good good on that
 
01:43:04.250 --> 01:43:04.260 align:start position:0%
before we leave I'll talk to somebody
 
01:43:05.629 --> 01:43:05.639 align:start position:0%
who just I'll just give you show you the
 
01:43:07.189 --> 01:43:07.199 align:start position:0%
representative already has a question
 
01:43:07.199 --> 01:43:08.390 align:start position:0%
representative already has a question
yeah

01:43:08.390 --> 01:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:43:11.209 --> 01:43:11.219 align:start position:0%
actually three questions oh good three
 
01:43:16.189 --> 01:43:16.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:17.750 --> 01:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
oh this question is the same one that I
 
01:43:19.910 --> 01:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
asked previously regarding legitimate
 
01:43:23.390 --> 01:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
business expenses and transfer funds uh
 
01:43:25.850 --> 01:43:25.860 align:start position:0%
from this company because of the loss
 
01:43:27.890 --> 01:43:27.900 align:start position:0%
and another division
 
01:43:30.169 --> 01:43:30.179 align:start position:0%
somewhere around the world
 
01:43:32.570 --> 01:43:32.580 align:start position:0%
that would under combined reporting
 
01:43:32.580 --> 01:43:34.250 align:start position:0%
that would under combined reporting
could

01:43:34.250 --> 01:43:34.260 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:43:36.530 --> 01:43:36.540 align:start position:0%
the revenue that would be due to the
 
01:43:39.290 --> 01:43:39.300 align:start position:0%
operations within New Hampshire be
 
01:43:43.010 --> 01:43:43.020 align:start position:0%
transferred to pay for a lost lead
 
01:43:45.290 --> 01:43:45.300 align:start position:0%
because of some developmental process
 
01:43:47.030 --> 01:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
taking place
 
01:43:51.430 --> 01:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
uh in India or England or wherever
 
01:43:53.629 --> 01:43:53.639 align:start position:0%
under combined reporting that the point
 
01:43:56.030 --> 01:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
is that you would you would ignore you
 
01:43:58.129 --> 01:43:58.139 align:start position:0%
would you would treat you would combine
 
01:43:59.450 --> 01:43:59.460 align:start position:0%
that's why it's called combined
 
01:44:02.090 --> 01:44:02.100 align:start position:0%
reporting you would basically combine
 
01:44:04.070 --> 01:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
all the income
 
01:44:05.209 --> 01:44:05.219 align:start position:0%
you'd have to have a standard for
 
01:44:07.850 --> 01:44:07.860 align:start position:0%
determining the income of
 
01:44:11.090 --> 01:44:11.100 align:start position:0%
all the related companies
 
01:44:13.729 --> 01:44:13.739 align:start position:0%
and then you would say where that income
 
01:44:16.490 --> 01:44:16.500 align:start position:0%
earned based on your formula again
 
01:44:19.010 --> 01:44:19.020 align:start position:0%
looking back to the
 
01:44:22.010 --> 01:44:22.020 align:start position:0%
earlier time when States refused some
 
01:44:23.709 --> 01:44:23.719 align:start position:0%
where's the property where's the payroll
 
01:44:27.770 --> 01:44:27.780 align:start position:0%
uh where where are the sales or today
 
01:44:30.109 --> 01:44:30.119 align:start position:0%
where are the sales I mean you use a
 
01:44:32.149 --> 01:44:32.159 align:start position:0%
formula to take the combining so you
 
01:44:33.410 --> 01:44:33.420 align:start position:0%
wouldn't worry inter-company
 
01:44:35.930 --> 01:44:35.940 align:start position:0%
transactions would not you wouldn't have
 
01:44:37.129 --> 01:44:37.139 align:start position:0%
arms Lane separate accounting
 
01:44:39.530 --> 01:44:39.540 align:start position:0%
determining did they lease to their
 
01:44:41.930 --> 01:44:41.940 align:start position:0%
Grand Cayman Island subsidiary at a
 
01:44:45.530 --> 01:44:45.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:48.229 --> 01:44:48.239 align:start position:0%
so okay so under this combined reporting
 
01:44:50.570 --> 01:44:50.580 align:start position:0%
would be the entire but you'd still have
 
01:44:52.430 --> 01:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
to have some sort of Nexus within New
 
01:44:53.930 --> 01:44:53.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as to what New Hampshire you
 
01:44:55.669 --> 01:44:55.679 align:start position:0%
would only only one you would only have
 
01:44:57.530 --> 01:44:57.540 align:start position:0%
to have only one
 
01:44:59.450 --> 01:44:59.460 align:start position:0%
of your
 
01:45:01.790 --> 01:45:01.800 align:start position:0%
entities would have to have Nexus so you
 
01:45:04.609 --> 01:45:04.619 align:start position:0%
could have one entity with a bunch of
 
01:45:07.669 --> 01:45:07.679 align:start position:0%
you know people and property in New
 
01:45:10.129 --> 01:45:10.139 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and everything else
 
01:45:12.590 --> 01:45:12.600 align:start position:0%
abroad but everything they were doing
 
01:45:13.910 --> 01:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
was intricately related to what was
 
01:45:16.310 --> 01:45:16.320 align:start position:0%
going on in New Hampshire and they would
 
01:45:18.590 --> 01:45:18.600 align:start position:0%
the apportionment formula would include
 
01:45:20.810 --> 01:45:20.820 align:start position:0%
the income of the combined group
 
01:45:22.669 --> 01:45:22.679 align:start position:0%
assigned to New Hampshire based on the
 
01:45:26.330 --> 01:45:26.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:30.470 --> 01:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:32.930 --> 01:45:32.940 align:start position:0%
regarding Hampshire which changed
 
01:45:37.189 --> 01:45:37.199 align:start position:0%
the perception of Nexus to point of this
 
01:45:38.990 --> 01:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
well it didn't real here's okay it's
 
01:45:40.490 --> 01:45:40.500 align:start position:0%
good this is my page of History which is
 
01:45:41.870 --> 01:45:41.880 align:start position:0%
good um remember I told you about the
 
01:45:45.229 --> 01:45:45.239 align:start position:0%
Jeffrey case uh the Wayfair no I know
 
01:45:46.490 --> 01:45:46.500 align:start position:0%
you're saying wait for I'm talking
 
01:45:48.229 --> 01:45:48.239 align:start position:0%
Jeffrey Jeffrey is the case involving
 
01:45:50.990 --> 01:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
the giraffe and and actually involved
 
01:45:53.629 --> 01:45:53.639 align:start position:0%
whether or not there is a connection if
 
01:45:56.270 --> 01:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
all I do Jeffrey said hey all I'm doing
 
01:45:58.330 --> 01:45:58.340 align:start position:0%
is is licensing my
 
01:46:03.109 --> 01:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
licensing my uh image to folks and and
 
01:46:04.790 --> 01:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
the court said that's enough what you're
 
01:46:06.830 --> 01:46:06.840 align:start position:0%
talking about is a Wayfair where the
 
01:46:09.350 --> 01:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
court early on decided that for income
 
01:46:11.629 --> 01:46:11.639 align:start position:0%
tax purposes okay income tax purposes
 
01:46:13.070 --> 01:46:13.080 align:start position:0%
you don't have to have a physical
 
01:46:16.609 --> 01:46:16.619 align:start position:0%
presence quill said you did okay and
 
01:46:19.669 --> 01:46:19.679 align:start position:0%
then when when the court then when the
 
01:46:21.470 --> 01:46:21.480 align:start position:0%
court reconsidered the case they said no
 
01:46:22.850 --> 01:46:22.860 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:46:24.490 --> 01:46:24.500 align:start position:0%
um we are not
 
01:46:27.530 --> 01:46:27.540 align:start position:0%
we're not holding everybody to the
 
01:46:30.950 --> 01:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
physical president we're not holding uh
 
01:46:34.010 --> 01:46:34.020 align:start position:0%
income tax jurisdiction to the physical
 
01:46:36.649 --> 01:46:36.659 align:start position:0%
presence standard and then Wayfair came
 
01:46:38.629 --> 01:46:38.639 align:start position:0%
along and finally said oh of course we
 
01:46:39.830 --> 01:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
mean the same thing that we said about
 
01:46:41.990 --> 01:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
income taxation for sales and use
 
01:46:43.850 --> 01:46:43.860 align:start position:0%
taxation so in fact the physical
 
01:46:45.890 --> 01:46:45.900 align:start position:0%
presence standard in the indirect tax
 
01:46:50.450 --> 01:46:50.460 align:start position:0%
concept sales tax vat uh has long that's
 
01:46:53.570 --> 01:46:53.580 align:start position:0%
that's all a matter of History
 
01:46:55.250 --> 01:46:55.260 align:start position:0%
if I can
 
01:46:58.189 --> 01:46:58.199 align:start position:0%
if you understand what I'm saying no why
 
01:46:59.570 --> 01:46:59.580 align:start position:0%
in other words
 
01:47:01.430 --> 01:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
um the
 
01:47:01.440 --> 01:47:02.270 align:start position:0%
um the
um

01:47:02.270 --> 01:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:05.090 --> 01:47:05.100 align:start position:0%
the quill the case that the case that
 
01:47:05.100 --> 01:47:07.189 align:start position:0%
the quill the case that the case that
reaffirmed

01:47:07.189 --> 01:47:07.199 align:start position:0%
reaffirmed
 
01:47:10.010 --> 01:47:10.020 align:start position:0%
the physical presence concept
 
01:47:12.530 --> 01:47:12.540 align:start position:0%
in the quilt case I've got you know
 
01:47:16.070 --> 01:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
cited here it basically said it said
 
01:47:17.629 --> 01:47:17.639 align:start position:0%
because there was an attack on the
 
01:47:19.330 --> 01:47:19.340 align:start position:0%
physical presence concept long before
 
01:47:22.010 --> 01:47:22.020 align:start position:0%
Wayfair case they said you know we're
 
01:47:23.689 --> 01:47:23.699 align:start position:0%
not saying this applies everywhere but
 
01:47:25.609 --> 01:47:25.619 align:start position:0%
in the sales and use tax context it does
 
01:47:28.970 --> 01:47:28.980 align:start position:0%
so in the income tax context there has
 
01:47:31.609 --> 01:47:31.619 align:start position:0%
long been what I'll call an economic
 
01:47:33.950 --> 01:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
presence rather than a physical presence
 
01:47:36.290 --> 01:47:36.300 align:start position:0%
concept at the sub-national level at the
 
01:47:38.090 --> 01:47:38.100 align:start position:0%
international level of course if you've
 
01:47:39.709 --> 01:47:39.719 align:start position:0%
got you know need to have a permanent
 
01:47:41.330 --> 01:47:41.340 align:start position:0%
establishment or whatever the whatever
 
01:47:42.830 --> 01:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
your global standard is depending on
 
01:47:44.090 --> 01:47:44.100 align:start position:0%
whether you've got a treaty with the U.S
 
01:47:46.129 --> 01:47:46.139 align:start position:0%
or not that may be different
 
01:47:49.010 --> 01:47:49.020 align:start position:0%
okay I I
 
01:47:50.810 --> 01:47:50.820 align:start position:0%
sorry that's just the way the law
 
01:47:54.350 --> 01:47:54.360 align:start position:0%
developed yeah yeah it's an ongoing
 
01:47:56.209 --> 01:47:56.219 align:start position:0%
discussion when we've had it in ways and
 
01:47:59.629 --> 01:47:59.639 align:start position:0%
means repeal to hear uh yeah which leads
 
01:48:01.910 --> 01:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
up to the next question
 
01:48:01.920 --> 01:48:02.750 align:start position:0%
up to the next question
um

01:48:02.750 --> 01:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:05.689 --> 01:48:05.699 align:start position:0%
just based upon your research
 
01:48:09.530 --> 01:48:09.540 align:start position:0%
uh business tax revenues under the
 
01:48:13.250 --> 01:48:13.260 align:start position:0%
condition 1981 to 1986 were X
 
01:48:16.970 --> 01:48:16.980 align:start position:0%
did they uh business revenues to the
 
01:48:19.609 --> 01:48:19.619 align:start position:0%
states increase or decrease after 1980.
 
01:48:21.649 --> 01:48:21.659 align:start position:0%
I I have no I cannot I don't I don't
 
01:48:23.209 --> 01:48:23.219 align:start position:0%
know and I think maybe I think this
 
01:48:26.629 --> 01:48:26.639 align:start position:0%
Indiana study may be very useful for you
 
01:48:26.639 --> 01:48:28.370 align:start position:0%
Indiana study may be very useful for you
yeah

01:48:28.370 --> 01:48:28.380 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:48:32.629 --> 01:48:32.639 align:start position:0%
very good other questions yeah
 
01:48:36.050 --> 01:48:36.060 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned the oecd in kind of the
 
01:48:37.910 --> 01:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
international yeah you know so I spend
 
01:48:39.590 --> 01:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
most of my time these days yeah that's
 
01:48:41.990 --> 01:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
going on and I was hoping
 
01:48:43.490 --> 01:48:43.500 align:start position:0%
um you could help us just kind of
 
01:48:45.950 --> 01:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
understand worldwide Water's Edge
 
01:48:48.890 --> 01:48:48.900 align:start position:0%
inbound companies in outbound companies
 
01:48:51.830 --> 01:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
right and the taxation thereof
 
01:48:53.270 --> 01:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
um as a result of this right so
 
01:48:55.790 --> 01:48:55.800 align:start position:0%
outbounds now we do have guilty
 
01:48:57.770 --> 01:48:57.780 align:start position:0%
that comes into play and we have kind of
 
01:48:59.870 --> 01:48:59.880 align:start position:0%
a charge coming up a dividend that's
 
01:49:01.870 --> 01:49:01.880 align:start position:0%
coming up that's in the tax base
 
01:49:04.370 --> 01:49:04.380 align:start position:0%
obviously for inbounds where we have a
 
01:49:06.350 --> 01:49:06.360 align:start position:0%
lot of related Affiliates that aren't in
 
01:49:08.030 --> 01:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
the group currently that would be
 
01:49:09.830 --> 01:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
exposed if you could just kind of
 
01:49:11.810 --> 01:49:11.820 align:start position:0%
educate us on that just to make sure
 
01:49:14.149 --> 01:49:14.159 align:start position:0%
we're all no but all I can say yeah no I
 
01:49:15.770 --> 01:49:15.780 align:start position:0%
I can't I can't I can educate you in the
 
01:49:17.689 --> 01:49:17.699 align:start position:0%
one sense for what's going on in terms
 
01:49:17.699 --> 01:49:18.470 align:start position:0%
one sense for what's going on in terms
of

01:49:18.470 --> 01:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:19.550 align:start position:0%
of
um

01:49:19.550 --> 01:49:19.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:23.450 align:start position:0%
um
domestic

01:49:23.450 --> 01:49:23.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:26.149 --> 01:49:26.159 align:start position:0%
National direct taxis not you know
 
01:49:28.129 --> 01:49:28.139 align:start position:0%
federal income taxation how that affects
 
01:49:30.770 --> 01:49:30.780 align:start position:0%
foreign Commerce that's all a question
 
01:49:34.310 --> 01:49:34.320 align:start position:0%
for Congress and and some of the things
 
01:49:37.129 --> 01:49:37.139 align:start position:0%
that are going on are not going on are a
 
01:49:38.510 --> 01:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
matter of
 
01:49:40.189 --> 01:49:40.199 align:start position:0%
um you know intense debate but that's
 
01:49:42.350 --> 01:49:42.360 align:start position:0%
quite different from the debate that's
 
01:49:45.169 --> 01:49:45.179 align:start position:0%
going on globally at the oecd where I
 
01:49:47.270 --> 01:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
think there again I I like to say this
 
01:49:48.410 --> 01:49:48.420 align:start position:0%
because I think there's better
 
01:49:48.420 --> 01:49:50.030 align:start position:0%
because I think there's better
recognition

01:49:50.030 --> 01:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
recognition
 
01:49:52.310 --> 01:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
at least by not by every country and not
 
01:49:55.250 --> 01:49:55.260 align:start position:0%
by ever but a recognition that the
 
01:49:57.590 --> 01:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
pre-existing system
 
01:50:01.370 --> 01:50:01.380 align:start position:0%
does not fairly attribute income to
 
01:50:02.629 --> 01:50:02.639 align:start position:0%
where it's earned I'll give you even the
 
01:50:03.649 --> 01:50:03.659 align:start position:0%
probably the best example they always
 
01:50:06.350 --> 01:50:06.360 align:start position:0%
say if if a company makes this Facebook
 
01:50:08.689 --> 01:50:08.699 align:start position:0%
makes its money by when I log on or
 
01:50:10.490 --> 01:50:10.500 align:start position:0%
whoever it is by knowing where I am I
 
01:50:11.629 --> 01:50:11.639 align:start position:0%
say oh Walter I say you're in New
 
01:50:12.410 --> 01:50:12.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire how would you like to buy
 
01:50:12.420 --> 01:50:13.189 align:start position:0%
Hampshire how would you like to buy
something

01:50:13.189 --> 01:50:13.199 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:50:14.330 --> 01:50:14.340 align:start position:0%
how do you know I'm in New Hampshire
 
01:50:16.370 --> 01:50:16.380 align:start position:0%
because I've just logged on to something
 
01:50:19.510 --> 01:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
and my eyeballs have been sold
 
01:50:21.590 --> 01:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
guess what
 
01:50:23.149 --> 01:50:23.159 align:start position:0%
um so now the question is and then of
 
01:50:25.430 --> 01:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
course I buy something and what's going
 
01:50:28.310 --> 01:50:28.320 align:start position:0%
on globally is understanding that you
 
01:50:32.209 --> 01:50:32.219 align:start position:0%
know even if a company is only selling
 
01:50:35.330 --> 01:50:35.340 align:start position:0%
eyeballs in some jurisdiction some of
 
01:50:36.410 --> 01:50:36.420 align:start position:0%
their income
 
01:50:37.370 --> 01:50:37.380 align:start position:0%
ought to be attributed to that
 
01:50:39.169 --> 01:50:39.179 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction not all
 
01:50:41.689 --> 01:50:41.699 align:start position:0%
some I mean I'm just giving it so that
 
01:50:43.970 --> 01:50:43.980 align:start position:0%
that's the there's pillar one and pillar
 
01:50:47.270 --> 01:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
two so so under one of the pillars we
 
01:50:51.709 --> 01:50:51.719 align:start position:0%
understand that there ought to be some
 
01:50:53.750 --> 01:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
income attributed to Market
 
01:50:55.129 --> 01:50:55.139 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions even without physical
 
01:50:55.139 --> 01:50:56.750 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions even without physical
presence

01:50:56.750 --> 01:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
presence
 
01:50:58.990 --> 01:50:59.000 align:start position:0%
um and that's and then the rest of the
 
01:51:02.570 --> 01:51:02.580 align:start position:0%
balances should be again the national
 
01:51:04.250 --> 01:51:04.260 align:start position:0%
the international
 
01:51:06.290 --> 01:51:06.300 align:start position:0%
uh regimes are trying to figure out
 
01:51:08.890 --> 01:51:08.900 align:start position:0%
what's what's the best way for
 
01:51:11.870 --> 01:51:11.880 align:start position:0%
traditional income based on where people
 
01:51:13.490 --> 01:51:13.500 align:start position:0%
are located you know arms Lane separate
 
01:51:14.689 --> 01:51:14.699 align:start position:0%
accounting or do we need to vary that
 
01:51:16.669 --> 01:51:16.679 align:start position:0%
and make changes but that's all a moving
 
01:51:18.709 --> 01:51:18.719 align:start position:0%
Target now it means there's not there's
 
01:51:20.330 --> 01:51:20.340 align:start position:0%
not uniformed agreement I'm sure that'll
 
01:51:22.310 --> 01:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
be long gone when they when as and if
 
01:51:23.990 --> 01:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
they finally decide what the right
 
01:51:25.609 --> 01:51:25.619 align:start position:0%
answer is and then the question is
 
01:51:28.850 --> 01:51:28.860 align:start position:0%
whether or not you know the U.S agrees
 
01:51:31.070 --> 01:51:31.080 align:start position:0%
um but anyway that's where we are it's
 
01:51:32.930 --> 01:51:32.940 align:start position:0%
you know it's great for lawyers or for
 
01:51:34.250 --> 01:51:34.260 align:start position:0%
people who are involved in this but
 
01:51:36.050 --> 01:51:36.060 align:start position:0%
there's no you know you're not going to
 
01:51:38.209 --> 01:51:38.219 align:start position:0%
find an answer there yet
 
01:51:39.649 --> 01:51:39.659 align:start position:0%
but you will find at least the questions
 
01:51:41.390 --> 01:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
are being every question is being asked
 
01:51:42.950 --> 01:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
here today is a question that's being
 
01:51:45.530 --> 01:51:45.540 align:start position:0%
asked all globally uh particularly
 
01:51:47.270 --> 01:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
whether regard to income fortunately I
 
01:51:49.370 --> 01:51:49.380 align:start position:0%
just have to say this when I go to oecd
 
01:51:51.229 --> 01:51:51.239 align:start position:0%
I'm dealing with what's really the easy
 
01:51:56.209 --> 01:51:56.219 align:start position:0%
issue it's sales vat we all know how vit
 
01:51:58.250 --> 01:51:58.260 align:start position:0%
ought to work and we all know that
 
01:52:00.050 --> 01:52:00.060 align:start position:0%
destination based is right and then the
 
01:52:01.430 --> 01:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
only question is how to do it in a way
 
01:52:03.470 --> 01:52:03.480 align:start position:0%
that's you know that makes sense to
 
01:52:04.850 --> 01:52:04.860 align:start position:0%
other jurisdictions but there's not a
 
01:52:06.490 --> 01:52:06.500 align:start position:0%
debate as to where
 
01:52:09.290 --> 01:52:09.300 align:start position:0%
the uh consumption ought to be taxed
 
01:52:10.669 --> 01:52:10.679 align:start position:0%
consumption to be tax per consumption
 
01:52:12.649 --> 01:52:12.659 align:start position:0%
occurs it's consumption tax if you have
 
01:52:17.030 --> 01:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:20.270 --> 01:52:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:21.590 --> 01:52:21.600 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you for taking my
 
01:52:21.600 --> 01:52:22.910 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you for taking my
question

01:52:22.910 --> 01:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:52:25.490 --> 01:52:25.500 align:start position:0%
um now I believe that the one of the
 
01:52:28.910 --> 01:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
main concerns is that the uh the local
 
01:52:31.550 --> 01:52:31.560 align:start position:0%
domestic companies are competing with
 
01:52:35.390 --> 01:52:35.400 align:start position:0%
multinational companies that has
 
01:52:37.850 --> 01:52:37.860 align:start position:0%
uh CFC so foreign subsidiaries and
 
01:52:40.189 --> 01:52:40.199 align:start position:0%
therefore there's this risk of Base
 
01:52:43.189 --> 01:52:43.199 align:start position:0%
erosion and profit shifting now New
 
01:52:45.649 --> 01:52:45.659 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is conforming to the tax cuts
 
01:52:48.950 --> 01:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
and jobs act and specifically we are we
 
01:52:50.930 --> 01:52:50.940 align:start position:0%
adopt a guilty
 
01:52:50.940 --> 01:52:51.530 align:start position:0%
adopt a guilty
um

01:52:51.530 --> 01:52:51.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:53.890 --> 01:52:53.900 align:start position:0%
for taxable income purposes
 
01:52:58.669 --> 01:52:58.679 align:start position:0%
what is your thoughts on the mechanism
 
01:53:01.250 --> 01:53:01.260 align:start position:0%
of guilty in terms of trying to Abate
 
01:53:03.890 --> 01:53:03.900 align:start position:0%
the business uh the the base erosion and
 
01:53:06.530 --> 01:53:06.540 align:start position:0%
profit shifting well very it's a great
 
01:53:08.330 --> 01:53:08.340 align:start position:0%
question and I think it depends and
 
01:53:10.729 --> 01:53:10.739 align:start position:0%
often do we say a terrible answer but
 
01:53:13.129 --> 01:53:13.139 align:start position:0%
that's that's the right answer I mean to
 
01:53:15.590 --> 01:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
what it what are you to what are you
 
01:53:17.330 --> 01:53:17.340 align:start position:0%
conforming to are you conforming to
 
01:53:22.129 --> 01:53:22.139 align:start position:0%
something that would attribute income to
 
01:53:25.070 --> 01:53:25.080 align:start position:0%
U.S sub-national jurisdictions
 
01:53:27.410 --> 01:53:27.420 align:start position:0%
um are you and you have to look and how
 
01:53:29.330 --> 01:53:29.340 align:start position:0%
does it flow through what's going on and
 
01:53:33.290 --> 01:53:33.300 align:start position:0%
again we just just had a recent uh issue
 
01:53:35.450 --> 01:53:35.460 align:start position:0%
about you know should the should should
 
01:53:37.729 --> 01:53:37.739 align:start position:0%
States conform to whatever the most
 
01:53:42.050 --> 01:53:42.060 align:start position:0%
recent uh Federal development is and
 
01:53:44.930 --> 01:53:44.940 align:start position:0%
again it's com it depends and I think a
 
01:53:46.129 --> 01:53:46.139 align:start position:0%
lot of it depends
 
01:53:48.410 --> 01:53:48.420 align:start position:0%
at the federal level all they're talking
 
01:53:50.330 --> 01:53:50.340 align:start position:0%
about or not all that at the federal
 
01:53:51.890 --> 01:53:51.900 align:start position:0%
they're talking about what's in the tax
 
01:53:55.010 --> 01:53:55.020 align:start position:0%
base they're not talking about where the
 
01:53:56.870 --> 01:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
tax base goes that's the arms Lane
 
01:53:59.149 --> 01:53:59.159 align:start position:0%
separate accounting so I mean we talk
 
01:54:01.310 --> 01:54:01.320 align:start position:0%
about whether it's guilty or talk about
 
01:54:04.790 --> 01:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
other uh developments that are that are
 
01:54:06.590 --> 01:54:06.600 align:start position:0%
at the federal level I think one has to
 
01:54:09.290 --> 01:54:09.300 align:start position:0%
sort of translate that into
 
01:54:10.669 --> 01:54:10.679 align:start position:0%
if you're just talking about the base
 
01:54:12.410 --> 01:54:12.420 align:start position:0%
does the federal does the state think
 
01:54:14.270 --> 01:54:14.280 align:start position:0%
that they like that change in the base
 
01:54:15.830 --> 01:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
they normally would because States
 
01:54:17.930 --> 01:54:17.940 align:start position:0%
normally conform to the federal unless
 
01:54:19.189 --> 01:54:19.199 align:start position:0%
they decide not to so it's it's
 
01:54:21.410 --> 01:54:21.420 align:start position:0%
complicated but you know
 
01:54:23.450 --> 01:54:23.460 align:start position:0%
I think some of these materials would
 
01:54:23.460 --> 01:54:28.070 align:start position:0%
I think some of these materials would
help

01:54:28.070 --> 01:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:30.229 --> 01:54:30.239 align:start position:0%
yes representative chamber I'll try to
 
01:54:32.270 --> 01:54:32.280 align:start position:0%
make this one short thank you Professor
 
01:54:32.280 --> 01:54:34.070 align:start position:0%
make this one short thank you Professor
alerson

01:54:34.070 --> 01:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
alerson
 
01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:35.330 align:start position:0%
alerson
um

01:54:35.330 --> 01:54:35.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:38.270 --> 01:54:38.280 align:start position:0%
Virginia undertook a study like I didn't
 
01:54:40.970 --> 01:54:40.980 align:start position:0%
know about the 2016 Indiana yeah you did
 
01:54:43.070 --> 01:54:43.080 align:start position:0%
I until you know so we're both in the
 
01:54:45.129 --> 01:54:45.139 align:start position:0%
same class yeah all right
 
01:54:49.070 --> 01:54:49.080 align:start position:0%
and they're doing a comparison study
 
01:54:52.250 --> 01:54:52.260 align:start position:0%
of what their present tax system is and
 
01:54:54.830 --> 01:54:54.840 align:start position:0%
worldwide combined reporting and it's a
 
01:54:56.450 --> 01:54:56.460 align:start position:0%
five-year program that they're running
 
01:54:58.970 --> 01:54:58.980 align:start position:0%
so maybe you can look that up sometime
 
01:55:01.070 --> 01:55:01.080 align:start position:0%
oh yeah but did they bait but I mean
 
01:55:02.870 --> 01:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
they based on a hypo I mean based on
 
01:55:05.990 --> 01:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
their existing existing with
 
01:55:07.850 --> 01:55:07.860 align:start position:0%
hypothetical what would have happened if
 
01:55:09.649 --> 01:55:09.659 align:start position:0%
you've done this interesting that's very
 
01:55:13.490 --> 01:55:13.500 align:start position:0%
important okay uh the GAO
 
01:55:16.810 --> 01:55:16.820 align:start position:0%
in 1993
 
01:55:19.669 --> 01:55:19.679 align:start position:0%
so you're not talking okay GAO yeah the
 
01:55:22.609 --> 01:55:22.619 align:start position:0%
GAO it's just a question about would we
 
01:55:25.490 --> 01:55:25.500 align:start position:0%
have been better off will we will we
 
01:55:28.550 --> 01:55:28.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't we be better off moving to the
 
01:55:32.149 --> 01:55:32.159 align:start position:0%
worldwide combined reporting versus what
 
01:55:34.189 --> 01:55:34.199 align:start position:0%
we are presently doing because of what
 
01:55:39.169 --> 01:55:39.179 align:start position:0%
they said then uh in their 18 and 1989
 
01:55:42.350 --> 01:55:42.360 align:start position:0%
to 1990 tax data they
 
01:55:44.689 --> 01:55:44.699 align:start position:0%
72 percent of foreign control
 
01:55:47.750 --> 01:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
corporations pay no income tax and I
 
01:55:50.390 --> 01:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
think that same thing is happening today
 
01:55:50.400 --> 01:55:52.010 align:start position:0%
think that same thing is happening today
uh

01:55:52.010 --> 01:55:52.020 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:55:55.310 --> 01:55:55.320 align:start position:0%
the IRS experiences problems in dealing
 
01:55:58.250 --> 01:55:58.260 align:start position:0%
with transfer pricing issues
 
01:55:58.260 --> 01:55:59.030 align:start position:0%
with transfer pricing issues
um

01:55:59.030 --> 01:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:00.530 --> 01:56:00.540 align:start position:0%
even though they've moved to different
 
01:56:03.830 --> 01:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
tools of the challenges of section 482
 
01:56:09.590 --> 01:56:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:13.189 --> 01:56:13.199 align:start position:0%
with global economy why wouldn't we want
 
01:56:16.250 --> 01:56:16.260 align:start position:0%
to move toward a worldwide combined
 
01:56:18.550 --> 01:56:18.560 align:start position:0%
reporting versus what we're seeing now
 
01:56:22.010 --> 01:56:22.020 align:start position:0%
I'm in violent agreement with York with
 
01:56:24.709 --> 01:56:24.719 align:start position:0%
your comment I think the answer is
 
01:56:28.070 --> 01:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
um in a perfect world maybe even an
 
01:56:30.109 --> 01:56:30.119 align:start position:0%
imperfect World
 
01:56:32.810 --> 01:56:32.820 align:start position:0%
um the notion that we're going to
 
01:56:35.270 --> 01:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
look at every separate transfer price to
 
01:56:36.470 --> 01:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
determine where the income is earned I
 
01:56:38.450 --> 01:56:38.460 align:start position:0%
think we've learned again a page of
 
01:56:39.770 --> 01:56:39.780 align:start position:0%
History's worth of volume of logic
 
01:56:41.750 --> 01:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't work very well I'm not saying
 
01:56:43.310 --> 01:56:43.320 align:start position:0%
formula reapportionment works perfectly
 
01:56:46.370 --> 01:56:46.380 align:start position:0%
but I think it works better and more
 
01:56:48.109 --> 01:56:48.119 align:start position:0%
effectively given what's happened to the
 
01:56:50.450 --> 01:56:50.460 align:start position:0%
economy and I do think it's fair to say
 
01:56:52.970 --> 01:56:52.980 align:start position:0%
the global community at least you know
 
01:56:55.729 --> 01:56:55.739 align:start position:0%
part of it not everybody from the
 
01:56:56.990 --> 01:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
business Community but you look at it
 
01:56:58.850 --> 01:56:58.860 align:start position:0%
there's been a recognition
 
01:57:01.370 --> 01:57:01.380 align:start position:0%
given with the oecd governments at least
 
01:57:03.770 --> 01:57:03.780 align:start position:0%
the goal on the government side that we
 
01:57:07.270 --> 01:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
need a better way involving perhaps
 
01:57:09.050 --> 01:57:09.060 align:start position:0%
formulary apportionment for at least
 
01:57:11.030 --> 01:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
part of the tax base to assign it and
 
01:57:12.589 --> 01:57:12.599 align:start position:0%
that arm's length separate accounting
 
01:57:16.310 --> 01:57:16.320 align:start position:0%
well fine for the for the 20th century
 
01:57:18.290 --> 01:57:18.300 align:start position:0%
let's say maybe not be the answer for
 
01:57:19.669 --> 01:57:19.679 align:start position:0%
the 21st
 
01:57:22.490 --> 01:57:22.500 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
 
01:57:24.950 --> 01:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
yes Mr Kennedy thank you Professor
 
01:57:28.790 --> 01:57:28.800 align:start position:0%
um relative to the erosion base that we
 
01:57:31.129 --> 01:57:31.139 align:start position:0%
talked about and Mr Wong referred to the
 
01:57:33.530 --> 01:57:33.540 align:start position:0%
federal government's kind of partly
 
01:57:36.470 --> 01:57:36.480 align:start position:0%
responding to this transferring of
 
01:57:40.010 --> 01:57:40.020 align:start position:0%
profits overseas and the guilty tax
 
01:57:44.629 --> 01:57:44.639 align:start position:0%
um do you know if suppose that excluding
 
01:57:46.550 --> 01:57:46.560 align:start position:0%
the the way New Hampshire treats guilty
 
01:57:48.950 --> 01:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
but that there were Provisions in the
 
01:57:50.689 --> 01:57:50.699 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire laws that basically
 
01:57:54.050 --> 01:57:54.060 align:start position:0%
addressed this erosion-based issue or
 
01:57:56.750 --> 01:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
transfer pricing rules or
 
01:58:00.470 --> 01:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
um arm's length where they say if you're
 
01:58:02.629 --> 01:58:02.639 align:start position:0%
a company in New Hampshire and your
 
01:58:05.570 --> 01:58:05.580 align:start position:0%
costs include shipping things either
 
01:58:08.390 --> 01:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
overseas expenses overseas or to another
 
01:58:12.770 --> 01:58:12.780 align:start position:0%
state that we're going to do something
 
01:58:15.010 --> 01:58:15.020 align:start position:0%
different and I know there's a lot of
 
01:58:18.109 --> 01:58:18.119 align:start position:0%
equity issues in our state constitution
 
01:58:21.050 --> 01:58:21.060 align:start position:0%
but if they simply say that you know
 
01:58:23.450 --> 01:58:23.460 align:start position:0%
let's say you can only have have five
 
01:58:26.030 --> 01:58:26.040 align:start position:0%
percent royalties as an expense and so
 
01:58:28.729 --> 01:58:28.739 align:start position:0%
we're going to decouple maybe from the
 
01:58:30.890 --> 01:58:30.900 align:start position:0%
the regular amount does that create any
 
01:58:33.050 --> 01:58:33.060 align:start position:0%
sort of constitutional issues that you
 
01:58:34.790 --> 01:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
can Envision if if New Hampshire's
 
01:58:37.669 --> 01:58:37.679 align:start position:0%
decided to instead of going to worldwide
 
01:58:39.709 --> 01:58:39.719 align:start position:0%
but look for a compromise that kind of
 
01:58:39.719 --> 01:58:41.450 align:start position:0%
but look for a compromise that kind of
addressed

01:58:41.450 --> 01:58:41.460 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
01:58:44.450 --> 01:58:44.460 align:start position:0%
um uh this this exportation of profits
 
01:58:46.250 --> 01:58:46.260 align:start position:0%
and simply kind of isolate it to
 
01:58:47.870 --> 01:58:47.880 align:start position:0%
specific things does that create any
 
01:58:49.609 --> 01:58:49.619 align:start position:0%
sort of I would say absolutely not
 
01:58:53.209 --> 01:58:53.219 align:start position:0%
unless again unless unlike just a
 
01:58:55.189 --> 01:58:55.199 align:start position:0%
general approach again states of adopted
 
01:58:57.410 --> 01:58:57.420 align:start position:0%
formulary apportionment while the
 
01:58:58.310 --> 01:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
federal government had an online
 
01:58:59.870 --> 01:58:59.880 align:start position:0%
separate accounting and no one suggested
 
01:59:01.910 --> 01:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
that the methodology a different
 
01:59:04.729 --> 01:59:04.739 align:start position:0%
methodology at the subnational level is
 
01:59:07.250 --> 01:59:07.260 align:start position:0%
per se inconsistent with what's going on
 
01:59:08.990 --> 01:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
at the national level and indeed the one
 
01:59:11.390 --> 01:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
case they that might support that the
 
01:59:14.330 --> 01:59:14.340 align:start position:0%
idea a case called Japan line where the
 
01:59:16.729 --> 01:59:16.739 align:start position:0%
question of whether a property could be
 
01:59:19.430 --> 01:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
taxed both in the U.S and in Japan where
 
01:59:20.810 --> 01:59:20.820 align:start position:0%
it was taxed
 
01:59:23.149 --> 01:59:23.159 align:start position:0%
um if there's a if there's a complete
 
01:59:24.649 --> 01:59:24.659 align:start position:0%
inconsistency between what the states
 
01:59:26.330 --> 01:59:26.340 align:start position:0%
are doing what's happening
 
01:59:28.070 --> 01:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
nationally and I would say should be
 
01:59:29.209 --> 01:59:29.219 align:start position:0%
sub-national because what's going on
 
01:59:30.649 --> 01:59:30.659 align:start position:0%
nationally shouldn't affect what's going
 
01:59:32.689 --> 01:59:32.699 align:start position:0%
on subnationally you know maybe there
 
01:59:34.310 --> 01:59:34.320 align:start position:0%
could be but not when you're in the more
 
01:59:36.350 --> 01:59:36.360 align:start position:0%
general question you're asking
 
01:59:38.750 --> 01:59:38.760 align:start position:0%
um is whether or not you know something
 
01:59:40.970 --> 01:59:40.980 align:start position:0%
if whether
 
01:59:44.689 --> 01:59:44.699 align:start position:0%
what's some rule for assigning income or
 
01:59:46.850 --> 01:59:46.860 align:start position:0%
taxing income at the federal level does
 
01:59:49.850 --> 01:59:49.860 align:start position:0%
not in no way binds the states unless
 
01:59:51.890 --> 01:59:51.900 align:start position:0%
the federal government through its
 
01:59:54.589 --> 01:59:54.599 align:start position:0%
legislative Authority decides that it
 
01:59:56.030 --> 01:59:56.040 align:start position:0%
should be that's why we have a Commerce
 
01:59:56.040 --> 01:59:57.890 align:start position:0%
should be that's why we have a Commerce
Clause

01:59:57.890 --> 01:59:57.900 align:start position:0%
Clause
 
01:59:59.990 --> 02:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:00:03.109 --> 02:00:03.119 align:start position:0%
thank you very much so
 
02:00:05.390 --> 02:00:05.400 align:start position:0%
there was suggestion earlier that there
 
02:00:07.189 --> 02:00:07.199 align:start position:0%
could be lingering commerce clause or
 
02:00:10.189 --> 02:00:10.199 align:start position:0%
even 14th Amendment issues but none has
 
02:00:13.370 --> 02:00:13.380 align:start position:0%
been raised and I'd like to please
 
02:00:14.990 --> 02:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
confirm to me if this is an accurate
 
02:00:16.850 --> 02:00:16.860 align:start position:0%
summary of what you've told us it's not
 
02:00:20.510 --> 02:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
not in my no in my view again my gold
 
02:00:23.270 --> 02:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
standard I would never go near you
 
02:00:25.430 --> 02:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't take it on a contingency a
 
02:00:27.290 --> 02:00:27.300 align:start position:0%
because all you need for equal
 
02:00:30.410 --> 02:00:30.420 align:start position:0%
protection is rational basis yes
 
02:00:32.570 --> 02:00:32.580 align:start position:0%
certainly rational
 
02:00:35.030 --> 02:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
um I I agree with you I just I wanted to
 
02:00:38.629 --> 02:00:38.639 align:start position:0%
cut so so as it stands in terms of the
 
02:00:41.149 --> 02:00:41.159 align:start position:0%
body of Supreme Court case law
 
02:00:43.370 --> 02:00:43.380 align:start position:0%
and the various actions of the United
 
02:00:46.370 --> 02:00:46.380 align:start position:0%
States Congress there is nothing from a
 
02:00:48.470 --> 02:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
constitutional perspective or from a
 
02:00:50.450 --> 02:00:50.460 align:start position:0%
preemption perspective that currently
 
02:00:53.930 --> 02:00:53.940 align:start position:0%
binds our hands the legislature of New
 
02:00:56.330 --> 02:00:56.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire effectively is free to make a
 
02:00:59.270 --> 02:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
judgment call perhaps in in the context
 
02:01:01.010 --> 02:01:01.020 align:start position:0%
of the Indiana study we need to
 
02:01:03.129 --> 02:01:03.139 align:start position:0%
recognize that there are pros and cons
 
02:01:05.750 --> 02:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
mitigating against each other but
 
02:01:07.850 --> 02:01:07.860 align:start position:0%
ultimately it's a judgment call it's a
 
02:01:10.129 --> 02:01:10.139 align:start position:0%
matter of Economic and tax policy I I
 
02:01:12.350 --> 02:01:12.360 align:start position:0%
think that is precisely right on the
 
02:01:14.390 --> 02:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
Assumption again that in that in the
 
02:01:16.250 --> 02:01:16.260 align:start position:0%
legislation in the hypothetical
 
02:01:19.790 --> 02:01:19.800 align:start position:0%
legislation there's no wrinkle that says
 
02:01:22.609 --> 02:01:22.619 align:start position:0%
that provides any specific Advantage
 
02:01:24.470 --> 02:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
formulary apportionment versus orange
 
02:01:26.330 --> 02:01:26.340 align:start position:0%
Lane separate accounting fine
 
02:01:29.209 --> 02:01:29.219 align:start position:0%
but formulary apportionment that you
 
02:01:31.370 --> 02:01:31.380 align:start position:0%
know doesn't count
 
02:01:35.149 --> 02:01:35.159 align:start position:0%
um you know out-of-state people problem
 
02:01:38.930 --> 02:01:38.940 align:start position:0%
okay understood yeah so we can only be
 
02:01:41.149 --> 02:01:41.159 align:start position:0%
so adventurous
 
02:01:43.729 --> 02:01:43.739 align:start position:0%
very good thank you that was extremely
 
02:01:45.350 --> 02:01:45.360 align:start position:0%
thorough very interesting and I'm going
 
02:01:46.970 --> 02:01:46.980 align:start position:0%
to read a lot more carefully what you've
 
02:01:48.229 --> 02:01:48.239 align:start position:0%
submitted oh no thank you very much and
 
02:01:51.109 --> 02:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
I will give the you know the
 
02:01:53.390 --> 02:01:53.400 align:start position:0%
links to to these documents but the
 
02:01:55.910 --> 02:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
Indiana thing was most important one
 
02:01:58.490 --> 02:01:58.500 align:start position:0%
there sorry thank you bye yes very good
 
02:02:01.370 --> 02:02:01.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman yes sir
 
02:02:04.550 --> 02:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
um we've been using some jargon uh and
 
02:02:07.010 --> 02:02:07.020 align:start position:0%
this is open to the public so maybe we
 
02:02:10.550 --> 02:02:10.560 align:start position:0%
should explain what the jargon is uh so
 
02:02:13.550 --> 02:02:13.560 align:start position:0%
one of the accounts would like to
 
02:02:15.709 --> 02:02:15.719 align:start position:0%
which particular jargon are you I was
 
02:02:18.010 --> 02:02:18.020 align:start position:0%
just thinking of guilty because
 
02:02:22.790 --> 02:02:22.800 align:start position:0%
Global uh unitary intangible intangible
 
02:02:25.370 --> 02:02:25.380 align:start position:0%
yeah guilty is so it's it's a new
 
02:02:27.109 --> 02:02:27.119 align:start position:0%
provision you know relatively new
 
02:02:30.770 --> 02:02:30.780 align:start position:0%
provision from the 2017. from 2017 okay
 
02:02:34.910 --> 02:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
it's Global intangible low taxed income
 
02:02:38.870 --> 02:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
um and it it uh relates to controlled
 
02:02:40.550 --> 02:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
foreign corporations so these are
 
02:02:43.310 --> 02:02:43.320 align:start position:0%
corporations that are owned uh greater
 
02:02:46.189 --> 02:02:46.199 align:start position:0%
than 50 percent by U.S shareholders we
 
02:02:48.169 --> 02:02:48.179 align:start position:0%
got a further definition here so a U.S
 
02:02:50.689 --> 02:02:50.699 align:start position:0%
shareholder is a U.S person which can be
 
02:02:52.790 --> 02:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
a company an individual a partnership
 
02:02:54.770 --> 02:02:54.780 align:start position:0%
you name it that's a person right under
 
02:02:57.109 --> 02:02:57.119 align:start position:0%
the tax code in the aggregate they have
 
02:02:58.910 --> 02:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
to own more than 50 percent
 
02:03:01.910 --> 02:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
what this provision does is to the
 
02:03:04.310 --> 02:03:04.320 align:start position:0%
extent that you own a controlled foreign
 
02:03:06.890 --> 02:03:06.900 align:start position:0%
corporation one you have an obligation
 
02:03:09.950 --> 02:03:09.960 align:start position:0%
to file of 54.71 okay we've heard this
 
02:03:11.750 --> 02:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
form already this is an informational
 
02:03:14.570 --> 02:03:14.580 align:start position:0%
filing that I spent this weekend working
 
02:03:17.089 --> 02:03:17.099 align:start position:0%
on for clients and I wanted to put my
 
02:03:19.609 --> 02:03:19.619 align:start position:0%
head through the wall uh it's very long
 
02:03:22.010 --> 02:03:22.020 align:start position:0%
form it can be upwards of 20 30 pages
 
02:03:24.950 --> 02:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
very robust reporting on this and so
 
02:03:26.570 --> 02:03:26.580 align:start position:0%
when we talk about information being
 
02:03:29.089 --> 02:03:29.099 align:start position:0%
available to the New Hampshire dra it is
 
02:03:31.189 --> 02:03:31.199 align:start position:0%
important to acknowledge that these are
 
02:03:33.530 --> 02:03:33.540 align:start position:0%
in that file but anyway so we have this
 
02:03:37.010 --> 02:03:37.020 align:start position:0%
form and you calculate its profits on a
 
02:03:38.689 --> 02:03:38.699 align:start position:0%
U.S tax base
 
02:03:40.850 --> 02:03:40.860 align:start position:0%
and that is if it's a positive number
 
02:03:43.550 --> 02:03:43.560 align:start position:0%
that's your tested income okay
 
02:03:46.490 --> 02:03:46.500 align:start position:0%
you're also attributed a portion of kind
 
02:03:48.830 --> 02:03:48.840 align:start position:0%
of their assets that are used hard
 
02:03:51.470 --> 02:03:51.480 align:start position:0%
Assets in a Trader business taxes
 
02:03:54.109 --> 02:03:54.119 align:start position:0%
if it was a loss it'd be a tested loss
 
02:03:57.290 --> 02:03:57.300 align:start position:0%
okay it'd be a test of loss I then as a
 
02:04:00.109 --> 02:04:00.119 align:start position:0%
US person you know either the
 
02:04:02.149 --> 02:04:02.159 align:start position:0%
corporation the partnership what have
 
02:04:04.790 --> 02:04:04.800 align:start position:0%
you that has these interest Aggregates
 
02:04:07.669 --> 02:04:07.679 align:start position:0%
all of my tested income and tested
 
02:04:09.470 --> 02:04:09.480 align:start position:0%
losses and that determines what my
 
02:04:12.229 --> 02:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
guilty is global and tangible low-text
 
02:04:15.410 --> 02:04:15.420 align:start position:0%
income I'm taxed on that that's in my
 
02:04:16.430 --> 02:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
tax base
 
02:04:18.410 --> 02:04:18.420 align:start position:0%
and so if I own foreign corporations
 
02:04:20.750 --> 02:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
that are subject to transfer pricing and
 
02:04:22.010 --> 02:04:22.020 align:start position:0%
the separate accounting that we've heard
 
02:04:24.350 --> 02:04:24.360 align:start position:0%
about and all this at the end of the day
 
02:04:25.910 --> 02:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
the net of everything at this point the
 
02:04:28.850 --> 02:04:28.860 align:start position:0%
intention is get smashed together and
 
02:04:31.129 --> 02:04:31.139 align:start position:0%
flows up to the owners
 
02:04:33.229 --> 02:04:33.239 align:start position:0%
so as we think about that portion of the
 
02:04:34.970 --> 02:04:34.980 align:start position:0%
separate accounting that's important to
 
02:04:37.370 --> 02:04:37.380 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that's the intent of this
 
02:04:38.870 --> 02:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
guilty provision
 
02:04:41.089 --> 02:04:41.099 align:start position:0%
that's what it is in a nutshell two
 
02:04:43.669 --> 02:04:43.679 align:start position:0%
minutes or less
 
02:04:46.250 --> 02:04:46.260 align:start position:0%
very clear explanation thank you
 
02:04:49.609 --> 02:04:49.619 align:start position:0%
okay just to preview where we're at so
 
02:04:51.430 --> 02:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
we have
 
02:04:55.490 --> 02:04:55.500 align:start position:0%
two presenters who are both linking in
 
02:04:57.669 --> 02:04:57.679 align:start position:0%
through the video connection
 
02:05:00.350 --> 02:05:00.360 align:start position:0%
they are scheduled for 11 11 30 and
 
02:05:02.450 --> 02:05:02.460 align:start position:0%
we're just going to make it 11 30 and
 
02:05:05.149 --> 02:05:05.159 align:start position:0%
noon and I'm afraid our lunch I think
 
02:05:07.609 --> 02:05:07.619 align:start position:0%
should just be cut shorter to 15 minutes
 
02:05:11.689 --> 02:05:11.699 align:start position:0%
we'll take a break at 12 30. and we'll
 
02:05:16.310 --> 02:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
resume per the schedule at 12 45 so uh
 
02:05:19.189 --> 02:05:19.199 align:start position:0%
I'm going to invite onto the screen next

the governor on the adoption of a
 
02:07:56.089 --> 02:07:56.099 align:start position:0%

02:08:03.890 --> 02:08:03.900 align:start position:0%
Dakota I also uh want to thank uh
 
02:08:06.950 --> 02:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
Professor colorstein who preceded me
 
02:08:09.169 --> 02:08:09.179 align:start position:0%
here for presenting a very thorough
 
02:08:10.910 --> 02:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
presentation on the history and I'm
 
02:08:13.129 --> 02:08:13.139 align:start position:0%
going to refer to that it's been very
 
02:08:14.870 --> 02:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
helpful here and I'm going to refer to
 
02:08:20.270 --> 02:08:20.280 align:start position:0%
that in my remarks here let me say out
 
02:08:23.089 --> 02:08:23.099 align:start position:0%
of that history and I think the the most
 
02:08:26.990 --> 02:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
important piece overall is that in both
 
02:08:31.189 --> 02:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
the container decision in 1983
 
02:08:34.790 --> 02:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
and the Barclays decision in 1994 which
 
02:08:37.070 --> 02:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
incidentally covered two tax cases
 
02:08:39.890 --> 02:08:39.900 align:start position:0%
Barclays and Colgate Palmolive
 
02:08:43.729 --> 02:08:43.739 align:start position:0%
um the in both of those decisions
 
02:08:47.870 --> 02:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
the U.S Supreme Court found that the
 
02:08:50.750 --> 02:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
that worldwide combined reporting
 
02:08:55.550 --> 02:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
as a required method was proper and fair
 
02:08:57.410 --> 02:08:57.420 align:start position:0%
under the Constitution of the United
 
02:08:57.420 --> 02:08:58.609 align:start position:0%
under the Constitution of the United
States

02:08:58.609 --> 02:08:58.619 align:start position:0%
States
 
02:09:02.510 --> 02:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
and it applied test tests not simply a
 
02:09:05.330 --> 02:09:05.340 align:start position:0%
kind of legal constitutionality but they
 
02:09:08.030 --> 02:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
applied the tests of fairness of
 
02:09:11.689 --> 02:09:11.699 align:start position:0%
Taxation that the court has laid out in
 
02:09:15.169 --> 02:09:15.179 align:start position:0%
the 1977 Complete Auto Transit case
 
02:09:17.930 --> 02:09:17.940 align:start position:0%
and so that that I think you should be
 
02:09:20.950 --> 02:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
the Touchstone of any deliberations
 
02:09:25.729 --> 02:09:25.739 align:start position:0%
worldwide combined reporting is a an
 
02:09:28.850 --> 02:09:28.860 align:start position:0%
entirely proper and fair method of
 
02:09:28.860 --> 02:09:30.050 align:start position:0%
entirely proper and fair method of
reporting

02:09:30.050 --> 02:09:30.060 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
02:09:32.270 --> 02:09:32.280 align:start position:0%
I'd also want to say
 
02:09:34.189 --> 02:09:34.199 align:start position:0%
uh and you've had some vigorous
 
02:09:37.310 --> 02:09:37.320 align:start position:0%
discussion earlier on administrability
 
02:09:40.189 --> 02:09:40.199 align:start position:0%
that in the Barclays case and I'm going
 
02:09:41.930 --> 02:09:41.940 align:start position:0%
to skip ahead in my remarks a little bit
 
02:09:44.689 --> 02:09:44.699 align:start position:0%
here because I just want to make sure we
 
02:09:47.510 --> 02:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
we get at this point in the Barclays
 
02:09:47.520 --> 02:09:48.350 align:start position:0%
we get at this point in the Barclays
case

02:09:48.350 --> 02:09:48.360 align:start position:0%
case
 
02:09:51.890 --> 02:09:51.900 align:start position:0%
the court looked in particular at the
 
02:09:54.589 --> 02:09:54.599 align:start position:0%
issue of whether or not worldwide
 
02:09:57.770 --> 02:09:57.780 align:start position:0%
combined reporting created an excessive
 
02:10:01.070 --> 02:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
administrative burden and and Barclays
 
02:10:03.470 --> 02:10:03.480 align:start position:0%
in particular said that oh it would cost
 
02:10:06.890 --> 02:10:06.900 align:start position:0%
them millions of dollars a year uh to
 
02:10:10.910 --> 02:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
file the returns uh to comply with
 
02:10:13.550 --> 02:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
Worldwide combined reporting in
 
02:10:13.560 --> 02:10:14.870 align:start position:0%
Worldwide combined reporting in
California

02:10:14.870 --> 02:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
California
 
02:10:18.709 --> 02:10:18.719 align:start position:0%
in the end the court found the Supreme
 
02:10:21.229 --> 02:10:21.239 align:start position:0%
Court of the United States found that it
 
02:10:24.169 --> 02:10:24.179 align:start position:0%
would that would cost Barclays at the
 
02:10:31.010 --> 02:10:31.020 align:start position:0%
time about 900 to 1200 900 to 1 200 not
 
02:10:32.629 --> 02:10:32.639 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars
 
02:10:36.109 --> 02:10:36.119 align:start position:0%
to file the required reports for
 
02:10:38.689 --> 02:10:38.699 align:start position:0%
worldwide combined reporting and indeed
 
02:10:40.669 --> 02:10:40.679 align:start position:0%
there was not an excessive burden but
 
02:10:42.830 --> 02:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
that it was entirely administerable on
 
02:10:45.229 --> 02:10:45.239 align:start position:0%
the part of the company to comply with
 
02:10:48.530 --> 02:10:48.540 align:start position:0%
the other thing I would know and and I
 
02:10:51.770 --> 02:10:51.780 align:start position:0%
was at that point in 1994 it was with
 
02:10:51.780 --> 02:10:52.910 align:start position:0%
was at that point in 1994 it was with
the

02:10:52.910 --> 02:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:10:54.530 --> 02:10:54.540 align:start position:0%
um the Morley State Tax Commission we
 
02:10:56.629 --> 02:10:56.639 align:start position:0%
had filed an abacus brief in support of
 
02:10:58.490 --> 02:10:58.500 align:start position:0%
California's position
 
02:11:01.550 --> 02:11:01.560 align:start position:0%
and we have discovered on the last day
 
02:11:03.109 --> 02:11:03.119 align:start position:0%
when we could file the brief and we
 
02:11:05.209 --> 02:11:05.219 align:start position:0%
included it into the brief and brought
 
02:11:07.129 --> 02:11:07.139 align:start position:0%
to the attention of the U.S Supreme
 
02:11:11.589 --> 02:11:11.599 align:start position:0%
Court that Barclays had actually entered
 
02:11:15.890 --> 02:11:15.900 align:start position:0%
a uh an advanced pricing agreement with
 
02:11:17.570 --> 02:11:17.580 align:start position:0%
the federal government
 
02:11:21.290 --> 02:11:21.300 align:start position:0%
uh just that year as that case was
 
02:11:24.010 --> 02:11:24.020 align:start position:0%
proceeding that was premised on
 
02:11:27.229 --> 02:11:27.239 align:start position:0%
worldwide combined reporting formula
 
02:11:29.930 --> 02:11:29.940 align:start position:0%
apportionment so the
 
02:11:32.570 --> 02:11:32.580 align:start position:0%
Barclays had already agreed to do
 
02:11:35.930 --> 02:11:35.940 align:start position:0%
worldwide reporting had him I guess had
 
02:11:37.609 --> 02:11:37.619 align:start position:0%
found an administerable from the
 
02:11:40.129 --> 02:11:40.139 align:start position:0%
standpoint of the federal taxes but then
 
02:11:43.250 --> 02:11:43.260 align:start position:0%
was arguing that it was unadminist rule
 
02:11:45.530 --> 02:11:45.540 align:start position:0%
from the standpoint of a state
 
02:11:49.070 --> 02:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
requirement and the court rejected that
 
02:11:53.689 --> 02:11:53.699 align:start position:0%
I urge you to read the container and the
 
02:11:56.149 --> 02:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
Barclays decisions those are the
 
02:11:58.250 --> 02:11:58.260 align:start position:0%
preeminent guideposts for decision
 
02:12:01.669 --> 02:12:01.679 align:start position:0%
making in my judgment for any state and
 
02:12:04.490 --> 02:12:04.500 align:start position:0%
lays out why it is proper and fair in
 
02:12:07.189 --> 02:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
terms of income reporting and why it is
 
02:12:08.990 --> 02:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
in the case of the Barclays case
 
02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:10.790 align:start position:0%
in the case of the Barclays case
administrual

02:12:10.790 --> 02:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
administrual
 
02:12:14.510 --> 02:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
that worldwide combined reporting is the
 
02:12:17.589 --> 02:12:17.599 align:start position:0%
only method of income taxation that
 
02:12:20.709 --> 02:12:20.719 align:start position:0%
pre-preets businesses of different sizes
 
02:12:24.350 --> 02:12:24.360 align:start position:0%
types and Geographic scale on an
 
02:12:28.550 --> 02:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
absolutely equal basis it requires all
 
02:12:31.490 --> 02:12:31.500 align:start position:0%
entities again regardless of type
 
02:12:35.030 --> 02:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
regardless of size regardless of
 
02:12:38.810 --> 02:12:38.820 align:start position:0%
geographic operations to require that a
 
02:12:41.030 --> 02:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
hundred percent of the income that is
 
02:12:42.950 --> 02:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
earned in the state that can be
 
02:12:44.930 --> 02:12:44.940 align:start position:0%
reasonably assumed as earned being
 
02:12:47.390 --> 02:12:47.400 align:start position:0%
earned in the state is reported to that
 
02:12:47.400 --> 02:12:48.530 align:start position:0%
earned in the state is reported to that
state

02:12:48.530 --> 02:12:48.540 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:12:50.270 --> 02:12:50.280 align:start position:0%
now I want to just say there was
 
02:12:52.430 --> 02:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
criticism earlier about oh nobody
 
02:12:55.609 --> 02:12:55.619 align:start position:0%
requires mandatory worldwide reporting
 
02:12:57.770 --> 02:12:57.780 align:start position:0%
that's not right
 
02:13:01.310 --> 02:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
every state in this country to the best
 
02:13:03.169 --> 02:13:03.179 align:start position:0%
of my knowledge that Levy's a business
 
02:13:05.750 --> 02:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
profits tax a corporate income tax a
 
02:13:07.729 --> 02:13:07.739 align:start position:0%
corporate Franchise Tax based upon
 
02:13:07.739 --> 02:13:09.370 align:start position:0%
corporate Franchise Tax based upon
income

02:13:09.370 --> 02:13:09.380 align:start position:0%
income
 
02:13:13.970 --> 02:13:13.980 align:start position:0%
requires the businesses that operate in
 
02:13:16.189 --> 02:13:16.199 align:start position:0%
the united that operate in their state
 
02:13:18.290 --> 02:13:18.300 align:start position:0%
small businesses that operate in their
 
02:13:20.270 --> 02:13:20.280 align:start position:0%
state and if they use Waters Edge
 
02:13:22.910 --> 02:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
reporting every business that operates
 
02:13:25.010 --> 02:13:25.020 align:start position:0%
entirely within the boundaries of the
 
02:13:27.770 --> 02:13:27.780 align:start position:0%
United States to report a hundred
 
02:13:31.010 --> 02:13:31.020 align:start position:0%
percent of their income to that state
 
02:13:34.129 --> 02:13:34.139 align:start position:0%
for tax purposes that's mandatory
 
02:13:37.189 --> 02:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
worldwide reporting for small businesses
 
02:13:39.770 --> 02:13:39.780 align:start position:0%
and if your water's edge for National
 
02:13:43.250 --> 02:13:43.260 align:start position:0%
businesses the only ones that have a
 
02:13:44.810 --> 02:13:44.820 align:start position:0%
special privilege
 
02:13:47.990 --> 02:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
do not report all of their income are
 
02:13:50.270 --> 02:13:50.280 align:start position:0%
multinational corporations if you don't
 
02:13:52.910 --> 02:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
have worldwide reporting if you don't
 
02:13:56.330 --> 02:13:56.340 align:start position:0%
apply the worldwide principle uh to them
 
02:13:59.569 --> 02:13:59.579 align:start position:0%
as you are requiring the worldwide
 
02:14:02.930 --> 02:14:02.940 align:start position:0%
principle to be applied to to small and
 
02:14:04.850 --> 02:14:04.860 align:start position:0%
National businesses
 
02:14:07.129 --> 02:14:07.139 align:start position:0%
and so that's I think that's important
 
02:14:08.750 --> 02:14:08.760 align:start position:0%
to understand
 
02:14:12.069 --> 02:14:12.079 align:start position:0%
that that really a Water's Edge report
 
02:14:15.350 --> 02:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
gives multinational corporations a
 
02:14:18.770 --> 02:14:18.780 align:start position:0%
special privilege to report less than a
 
02:14:20.390 --> 02:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
hundred percent of the income that
 
02:14:24.709 --> 02:14:24.719 align:start position:0%
they've uh earn in your state and and
 
02:14:27.830 --> 02:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
not to pay a fair share of taxes that
 
02:14:30.169 --> 02:14:30.179 align:start position:0%
they should for the services that they
 
02:14:33.050 --> 02:14:33.060 align:start position:0%
enjoy the services that you provide that
 
02:14:36.410 --> 02:14:36.420 align:start position:0%
benefit them and therefore they're able
 
02:14:38.870 --> 02:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
to shift the burden of Taxation from
 
02:14:38.880 --> 02:14:40.129 align:start position:0%
to shift the burden of Taxation from
themselves

02:14:40.129 --> 02:14:40.139 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
02:14:42.470 --> 02:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
to your local businesses and to the
 
02:14:44.810 --> 02:14:44.820 align:start position:0%
National businesses that are operating
 
02:14:46.550 --> 02:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
within your state
 
02:14:46.560 --> 02:14:47.870 align:start position:0%
within your state
now

02:14:47.870 --> 02:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:14:50.450 --> 02:14:50.460 align:start position:0%
it is the only the reason that Mali
 
02:14:52.069 --> 02:14:52.079 align:start position:0%
National corporations
 
02:14:54.950 --> 02:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
don't like worldwide combined reporting
 
02:14:58.910 --> 02:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
is it it is the is that it is the only
 
02:15:02.030 --> 02:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
proven and effective method
 
02:15:05.810 --> 02:15:05.820 align:start position:0%
for stopping the shifting of income to
 
02:15:09.229 --> 02:15:09.239 align:start position:0%
tax Havens to low tax jurisdictions it's
 
02:15:12.229 --> 02:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
the only method that works and the
 
02:15:13.910 --> 02:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
states prove that
 
02:15:17.810 --> 02:15:17.820 align:start position:0%
and the when when they when they when
 
02:15:20.510 --> 02:15:20.520 align:start position:0%
they had the tax uh the worldwide
 
02:15:22.970 --> 02:15:22.980 align:start position:0%
reporting method in effect for
 
02:15:25.129 --> 02:15:25.139 align:start position:0%
multinational corporations
 
02:15:28.430 --> 02:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
now profit shifting is a huge problem in
 
02:15:29.750 --> 02:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
today's world
 
02:15:33.410 --> 02:15:33.420 align:start position:0%
and the world as Professor palerstein
 
02:15:35.990 --> 02:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
related to you the world is now paying
 
02:15:39.410 --> 02:15:39.420 align:start position:0%
attention to it today as it never did in
 
02:15:42.470 --> 02:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
the 1980s that it is the world is
 
02:15:45.109 --> 02:15:45.119 align:start position:0%
increasingly recognizing that it is a
 
02:15:47.270 --> 02:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
problem that needs to be addressed and
 
02:15:50.629 --> 02:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
is increasingly looking at formula
 
02:15:52.850 --> 02:15:52.860 align:start position:0%
apportionment methods and indeed I would
 
02:15:56.770 --> 02:15:56.780 align:start position:0%
say guilty for outbound uh transactions
 
02:16:00.649 --> 02:16:00.659 align:start position:0%
uh in the United States guilty is a
 
02:16:05.089 --> 02:16:05.099 align:start position:0%
rough form of uh and partial rough
 
02:16:07.250 --> 02:16:07.260 align:start position:0%
partial form of formula apportionment
 
02:16:10.250 --> 02:16:10.260 align:start position:0%
that says you have to bring back a half
 
02:16:12.530 --> 02:16:12.540 align:start position:0%
of your income that you've shifted to
 
02:16:15.530 --> 02:16:15.540 align:start position:0%
low tax jurisdictions and bring it back
 
02:16:17.390 --> 02:16:17.400 align:start position:0%
to the United States so the federal
 
02:16:20.930 --> 02:16:20.940 align:start position:0%
government is is has already opened the
 
02:16:23.750 --> 02:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
door to a formula of apportionment type
 
02:16:26.450 --> 02:16:26.460 align:start position:0%
method on a very rough basis and much
 
02:16:30.890 --> 02:16:30.900 align:start position:0%
less much less precise and again than
 
02:16:32.870 --> 02:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
this then the state's formula
 
02:16:34.310 --> 02:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
apportionment system
 
02:16:37.910 --> 02:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
and in addition as again Professor
 
02:16:42.230 --> 02:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
hellstein emphasized that the that uh
 
02:16:44.830 --> 02:16:44.840 align:start position:0%
the world now through the uh
 
02:16:47.750 --> 02:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
organization of economic cooperation and
 
02:16:51.110 --> 02:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
development is now looking at formula
 
02:16:54.889 --> 02:16:54.899 align:start position:0%
style methods uh in in the pillar to
 
02:16:57.770 --> 02:16:57.780 align:start position:0%
what they call pillar two of the of the
 
02:16:59.570 --> 02:16:59.580 align:start position:0%
their deliberations
 
02:17:02.690 --> 02:17:02.700 align:start position:0%
which is just a a label they've applied
 
02:17:05.750 --> 02:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
to a set of recommendations uh they've
 
02:17:09.049 --> 02:17:09.059 align:start position:0%
recommended a global minimum tax and on
 
02:17:12.290 --> 02:17:12.300 align:start position:0%
top of that they put a possible
 
02:17:15.589 --> 02:17:15.599 align:start position:0%
compensatory tax system where if a
 
02:17:18.530 --> 02:17:18.540 align:start position:0%
corporation has shifted income to low
 
02:17:21.349 --> 02:17:21.359 align:start position:0%
tax jurisdictions to tax Havens they
 
02:17:24.830 --> 02:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
must pay a compensatory tax back to the
 
02:17:26.450 --> 02:17:26.460 align:start position:0%
source of that income to the nation
 
02:17:29.629 --> 02:17:29.639 align:start position:0%
where the income was actually earned a a
 
02:17:33.049 --> 02:17:33.059 align:start position:0%
a a tax to compensate for the profits
 
02:17:34.790 --> 02:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
that they shifted overseas
 
02:17:38.089 --> 02:17:38.099 align:start position:0%
now what is that that is nothing more
 
02:17:40.610 --> 02:17:40.620 align:start position:0%
than a form of worldwide combined
 
02:17:43.549 --> 02:17:43.559 align:start position:0%
reporting operating not at the taxable
 
02:17:46.429 --> 02:17:46.439 align:start position:0%
income level of a return but at the tax
 
02:17:48.110 --> 02:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
liability level
 
02:17:51.650 --> 02:17:51.660 align:start position:0%
now some business organization
 
02:17:54.349 --> 02:17:54.359 align:start position:0%
Representatives say all the oecd has
 
02:17:56.810 --> 02:17:56.820 align:start position:0%
rejected worldwide unitary well that's
 
02:18:00.250 --> 02:18:00.260 align:start position:0%
because the oecd spent several decades
 
02:18:02.870 --> 02:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
denouncing worldwide unitary as
 
02:18:05.450 --> 02:18:05.460 align:start position:0%
practiced by States until they realize
 
02:18:07.910 --> 02:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
that their arms length system was an
 
02:18:09.530 --> 02:18:09.540 align:start position:0%
abject failure
 
02:18:12.469 --> 02:18:12.479 align:start position:0%
and now they're moving towards in fact
 
02:18:15.169 --> 02:18:15.179 align:start position:0%
formula apportionment methods and they
 
02:18:17.450 --> 02:18:17.460 align:start position:0%
don't want to say directly and lose
 
02:18:19.429 --> 02:18:19.439 align:start position:0%
Space by saying oh we're going to do
 
02:18:21.410 --> 02:18:21.420 align:start position:0%
what the states in the United States did
 
02:18:23.810 --> 02:18:23.820 align:start position:0%
instead we'll do it we'll we'll do
 
02:18:25.730 --> 02:18:25.740 align:start position:0%
something else but that something else
 
02:18:28.370 --> 02:18:28.380 align:start position:0%
is the same thing in a different form it
 
02:18:31.849 --> 02:18:31.859 align:start position:0%
only it it operates a compensatory tax
 
02:18:34.310 --> 02:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
system operates with Worldwide
 
02:18:36.889 --> 02:18:36.899 align:start position:0%
calculations at the tax liability level
 
02:18:39.650 --> 02:18:39.660 align:start position:0%
instead of the taxable income level so
 
02:18:41.570 --> 02:18:41.580 align:start position:0%
their saving phase and when you hear
 
02:18:44.150 --> 02:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
that they've rejected it that's not true
 
02:18:47.150 --> 02:18:47.160 align:start position:0%
because in fact as the professor before
 
02:18:50.150 --> 02:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
me indicated uh they are in fact
 
02:18:52.549 --> 02:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
seriously considering moving in that
 
02:18:56.110 --> 02:18:56.120 align:start position:0%
particular uh Direction the arm's length
 
02:19:00.349 --> 02:19:00.359 align:start position:0%
method of accounting for tax purposes is
 
02:19:03.169 --> 02:19:03.179 align:start position:0%
essentially dying and is judged as a
 
02:19:05.270 --> 02:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
failure because of the massive nature of
 
02:19:06.889 --> 02:19:06.899 align:start position:0%
the profit shifting that has occurred
 
02:19:09.650 --> 02:19:09.660 align:start position:0%
now I'm going to
 
02:19:12.770 --> 02:19:12.780 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to try to short-circuit my
 
02:19:15.770 --> 02:19:15.780 align:start position:0%
comments here a little bit uh but just
 
02:19:18.650 --> 02:19:18.660 align:start position:0%
talk about the nature of the extent of
 
02:19:21.830 --> 02:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
the profit shifting that is occurring
 
02:19:24.950 --> 02:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
in the world and the and the size of the
 
02:19:27.589 --> 02:19:27.599 align:start position:0%
inequity that is occurring we don't know
 
02:19:30.290 --> 02:19:30.300 align:start position:0%
exactly what the what it is because
 
02:19:32.929 --> 02:19:32.939 align:start position:0%
there's not sufficient disclosure
 
02:19:36.770 --> 02:19:36.780 align:start position:0%
required of of uh tax return information
 
02:19:39.589 --> 02:19:39.599 align:start position:0%
to do an exact calculation although I'm
 
02:19:41.810 --> 02:19:41.820 align:start position:0%
going to cite some that is beginning to
 
02:19:45.049 --> 02:19:45.059 align:start position:0%
come out from tax disputes and and that
 
02:19:47.349 --> 02:19:47.359 align:start position:0%
had have been studied here in a minute
 
02:19:50.570 --> 02:19:50.580 align:start position:0%
the Congressional budget office has
 
02:19:54.830 --> 02:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
estimated that uh 300 billion dollars in
 
02:19:58.910 --> 02:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
profit is shifted annually uh to over uh
 
02:20:02.150 --> 02:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
to uh other jurisdictions where it goes
 
02:20:05.210 --> 02:20:05.220 align:start position:0%
untaxed and that correcting that would
 
02:20:08.270 --> 02:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
amount to about 60 billion dollars a
 
02:20:11.510 --> 02:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
year in federal revenue and if you uh
 
02:20:14.270 --> 02:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
extrapolate to the states that would be
 
02:20:16.610 --> 02:20:16.620 align:start position:0%
about 12 billion dollars in state taxes
 
02:20:18.590 --> 02:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
annually that's on the low side
 
02:20:21.410 --> 02:20:21.420 align:start position:0%
estimates other organizations have
 
02:20:24.530 --> 02:20:24.540 align:start position:0%
estimated that it's up to a hundred and
 
02:20:28.190 --> 02:20:28.200 align:start position:0%
nearly a 180 billion dollars in federal
 
02:20:31.610 --> 02:20:31.620 align:start position:0%
taxes lost with a much larger uh part
 
02:20:35.330 --> 02:20:35.340 align:start position:0%
accordingly being lost to the States now
 
02:20:36.770 --> 02:20:36.780 align:start position:0%
so along comes some business
 
02:20:39.469 --> 02:20:39.479 align:start position:0%
organizations who say well because no
 
02:20:41.270 --> 02:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
one can agree on what the number is
 
02:20:43.490 --> 02:20:43.500 align:start position:0%
there really isn't a problem those are
 
02:20:45.410 --> 02:20:45.420 align:start position:0%
not reliable estimates well they're not
 
02:20:47.270 --> 02:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
as reliable as we'd like them to be
 
02:20:49.910 --> 02:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
because the tax returns have not been
 
02:20:52.450 --> 02:20:52.460 align:start position:0%
sufficiently disclosed to do a precise
 
02:20:55.670 --> 02:20:55.680 align:start position:0%
calculation at least as on a general
 
02:20:59.809 --> 02:20:59.819 align:start position:0%
basis but that is changing Australia is
 
02:21:01.969 --> 02:21:01.979 align:start position:0%
now requiring Company by company
 
02:21:06.770 --> 02:21:06.780 align:start position:0%
reporting the financial uh uh Accounting
 
02:21:09.349 --> 02:21:09.359 align:start position:0%
Standards Board is requiring increased
 
02:21:13.250 --> 02:21:13.260 align:start position:0%
disclosure of uh of uh of tax
 
02:21:17.650 --> 02:21:17.660 align:start position:0%
information and the uh and in addition
 
02:21:21.950 --> 02:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
some Enterprise using tax economists and
 
02:21:23.530 --> 02:21:23.540 align:start position:0%
and accountants of international
 
02:21:26.690 --> 02:21:26.700 align:start position:0%
standing have begun to calculate from
 
02:21:31.370 --> 02:21:31.380 align:start position:0%
tax uh uh dispute data the extent of the
 
02:21:34.870 --> 02:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
problem and I commend to you an article
 
02:21:39.349 --> 02:21:39.359 align:start position:0%
uh by uh Ruben aviona David Chamberlain
 
02:21:42.410 --> 02:21:42.420 align:start position:0%
Stephen Curtis and Jeffrey Cadet in tax
 
02:21:47.630 --> 02:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
notes Federal of May 22nd 2023 in which
 
02:21:50.650 --> 02:21:50.660 align:start position:0%
they indicate and they they add to this
 
02:21:53.510 --> 02:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh tax penalties and interest and I'm
 
02:21:56.270 --> 02:21:56.280 align:start position:0%
not that a set of six companies and
 
02:21:58.849 --> 02:21:58.859 align:start position:0%
they're named in the report
 
02:22:02.690 --> 02:22:02.700 align:start position:0%
over a multi-period year period uh avoid
 
02:22:02.700 --> 02:22:04.750 align:start position:0%
over a multi-period year period uh avoid
avoided

02:22:04.750 --> 02:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
avoided
 
02:22:09.110 --> 02:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
277 billion dollars in federal taxes and
 
02:22:11.690 --> 02:22:11.700 align:start position:0%
those are a portion of those taxes
 
02:22:14.270 --> 02:22:14.280 align:start position:0%
avoided were avoided in New Hampshire
 
02:22:17.330 --> 02:22:17.340 align:start position:0%
incidentally and not successfully return
 
02:22:20.630 --> 02:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
uh to your state at least not yet
 
02:22:23.450 --> 02:22:23.460 align:start position:0%
uh so the problem is huge and they when
 
02:22:24.770 --> 02:22:24.780 align:start position:0%
the business Community says well they
 
02:22:26.690 --> 02:22:26.700 align:start position:0%
can't agree on the estimates all the
 
02:22:28.670 --> 02:22:28.680 align:start position:0%
estimates are from the range of being an
 
02:22:30.910 --> 02:22:30.920 align:start position:0%
enormous problem to being a
 
02:22:34.309 --> 02:22:34.319 align:start position:0%
catastrophically enormous problem and so
 
02:22:36.710 --> 02:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
somewhere in between enormous and
 
02:22:39.349 --> 02:22:39.359 align:start position:0%
catastrophically enormous problem is the
 
02:22:41.990 --> 02:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
problem that you face and I would urge
 
02:22:43.730 --> 02:22:43.740 align:start position:0%
you to solve with the adoption of
 
02:22:46.130 --> 02:22:46.140 align:start position:0%
worldwide unitary finally I'm just going
 
02:22:48.050 --> 02:22:48.060 align:start position:0%
to say this is a general matter to you
 
02:22:51.950 --> 02:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:55.330 --> 02:22:55.340 align:start position:0%
I presided over the administration
 
02:23:00.050 --> 02:23:00.060 align:start position:0%
of of worldwide taxes a worldwide
 
02:23:05.270 --> 02:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
reporting uh taxes uh in uh Montana
 
02:23:07.969 --> 02:23:07.979 align:start position:0%
uh we were still having remaining audits
 
02:23:10.070 --> 02:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
when I was executive director of The
 
02:23:12.710 --> 02:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
multi-state Tax Commission uh that
 
02:23:15.050 --> 02:23:15.060 align:start position:0%
covered worldwide reporting years for
 
02:23:18.250 --> 02:23:18.260 align:start position:0%
States when I was uh uh head of the
 
02:23:20.330 --> 02:23:20.340 align:start position:0%
multi-state tax commission and we were
 
02:23:23.830 --> 02:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
auditing corporations at that time
 
02:23:28.490 --> 02:23:28.500 align:start position:0%
and again uh we uh when I was director
 
02:23:31.550 --> 02:23:31.560 align:start position:0%
of Revenue Montana in the most recent E
 
02:23:35.750 --> 02:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
Period of 2005 to 2013 we had a tax
 
02:23:35.760 --> 02:23:37.190 align:start position:0%
Period of 2005 to 2013 we had a tax
Haven

02:23:37.190 --> 02:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
Haven
 
02:23:40.969 --> 02:23:40.979 align:start position:0%
um uh statute that combined tax Haven
 
02:23:44.690 --> 02:23:44.700 align:start position:0%
income uh into the tax returns at that
 
02:23:48.469 --> 02:23:48.479 align:start position:0%
particular point in time uh and uh in
 
02:23:51.710 --> 02:23:51.720 align:start position:0%
all of those cases those laws those
 
02:23:54.590 --> 02:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
worldwide and tax Haven laws were
 
02:23:56.750 --> 02:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
entirely administerable and readily
 
02:23:58.969 --> 02:23:58.979 align:start position:0%
administrable you do while there is
 
02:24:01.309 --> 02:24:01.319 align:start position:0%
information from Federal Tax Returns
 
02:24:03.170 --> 02:24:03.180 align:start position:0%
that is helpful and from State returns
 
02:24:06.050 --> 02:24:06.060 align:start position:0%
that is helpful the fact is in that you
 
02:24:07.790 --> 02:24:07.800 align:start position:0%
had these earlier questions about is
 
02:24:10.490 --> 02:24:10.500 align:start position:0%
there information on those returns to
 
02:24:13.309 --> 02:24:13.319 align:start position:0%
enable you to do uh the worldwide
 
02:24:15.530 --> 02:24:15.540 align:start position:0%
reporting the answer is
 
02:24:18.770 --> 02:24:18.780 align:start position:0%
not entirely but the information is
 
02:24:21.650 --> 02:24:21.660 align:start position:0%
there in the public financial reporting
 
02:24:24.170 --> 02:24:24.180 align:start position:0%
of the companies that is utilized for
 
02:24:26.510 --> 02:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
this purposes and some of the smallest
 
02:24:28.429 --> 02:24:28.439 align:start position:0%
states in the country including New
 
02:24:31.550 --> 02:24:31.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire North Dakota Montana and
 
02:24:33.830 --> 02:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
Alaska which incidentally requires
 
02:24:36.830 --> 02:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
worldwide reporting for oil companies
 
02:24:39.349 --> 02:24:39.359 align:start position:0%
still to this day some of the smallest
 
02:24:41.750 --> 02:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
states in this country successfully
 
02:24:44.809 --> 02:24:44.819 align:start position:0%
administered uh the the worldwide system
 
02:24:48.530 --> 02:24:48.540 align:start position:0%
and successfully audited uh corporations
 
02:24:51.950 --> 02:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
for that purposes over a long period of
 
02:24:54.710 --> 02:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
years California began worldwide
 
02:24:57.230 --> 02:24:57.240 align:start position:0%
combined reporting their first case of
 
02:25:00.110 --> 02:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
that was in 1939
 
02:25:02.990 --> 02:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
and it was entirely administrable and
 
02:25:05.090 --> 02:25:05.100 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to stop there and say
 
02:25:07.330 --> 02:25:07.340 align:start position:0%
simply again that the operative words
 
02:25:10.969 --> 02:25:10.979 align:start position:0%
are from the U.S Supreme Court uh
 
02:25:13.790 --> 02:25:13.800 align:start position:0%
worldwide combined reporting is proper
 
02:25:17.750 --> 02:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
and fair for the states to employ to do
 
02:25:20.030 --> 02:25:20.040 align:start position:0%
justice to their citizens every other
 
02:25:22.849 --> 02:25:22.859 align:start position:0%
taxpayer has to report a hundred percent
 
02:25:25.370 --> 02:25:25.380 align:start position:0%
of their income and so should
 
02:25:28.730 --> 02:25:28.740 align:start position:0%
multinational corporations thank you Mr
 
02:25:30.230 --> 02:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
chairman members of the commission I'm
 
02:25:32.090 --> 02:25:32.100 align:start position:0%
going to stop there I have a lot of
 
02:25:33.290 --> 02:25:33.300 align:start position:0%
things I'd like to say about the
 
02:25:35.630 --> 02:25:35.640 align:start position:0%
worldwide working group report Etc but
 
02:25:37.370 --> 02:25:37.380 align:start position:0%
you can just ask me questions and I'll
 
02:25:39.290 --> 02:25:39.300 align:start position:0%
try to be as responsive and as helpful
 
02:25:42.130 --> 02:25:42.140 align:start position:0%
as I can be thank you
 
02:25:44.690 --> 02:25:44.700 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and I don't know
 
02:25:46.370 --> 02:25:46.380 align:start position:0%
that I have it yet so if you could send
 
02:25:48.830 --> 02:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
us the link for the tax notes article
 
02:25:51.710 --> 02:25:51.720 align:start position:0%
that you mentioned that would be helpful
 
02:25:54.770 --> 02:25:54.780 align:start position:0%
yes yes I will I'm and I apologize for
 
02:25:57.469 --> 02:25:57.479 align:start position:0%
not having uh submitted that earlier
 
02:26:02.990 --> 02:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:05.150 --> 02:26:05.160 align:start position:0%
Mr Kennedy
 
02:26:08.389 --> 02:26:08.399 align:start position:0%
a couple quick questions regarding the
 
02:26:11.030 --> 02:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
opposition to worldwide reporting so it
 
02:26:12.950 --> 02:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
appears clear based on your testimony
 
02:26:15.650 --> 02:26:15.660 align:start position:0%
that the state certainly could move to
 
02:26:18.410 --> 02:26:18.420 align:start position:0%
worldwide reporting without
 
02:26:21.170 --> 02:26:21.180 align:start position:0%
um uh suits or I mean there might be
 
02:26:22.849 --> 02:26:22.859 align:start position:0%
suits anyway but they'd have a good
 
02:26:25.010 --> 02:26:25.020 align:start position:0%
premise from the Supreme Court that
 
02:26:27.410 --> 02:26:27.420 align:start position:0%
they're allowed to move to that but this
 
02:26:30.110 --> 02:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
might open up the gate for um other
 
02:26:32.150 --> 02:26:32.160 align:start position:0%
suits like what entities should be
 
02:26:33.770 --> 02:26:33.780 align:start position:0%
included how do you apportion income
 
02:26:37.130 --> 02:26:37.140 align:start position:0%
what about aggregation of ownership
 
02:26:39.950 --> 02:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
um and so this could lead to additional
 
02:26:43.490 --> 02:26:43.500 align:start position:0%
costs for companies and the state when
 
02:26:45.290 --> 02:26:45.300 align:start position:0%
these sorts of disputes come up by
 
02:26:46.910 --> 02:26:46.920 align:start position:0%
moving to worldwide reporting so I'm
 
02:26:48.830 --> 02:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
curious as to what kind of response you
 
02:26:52.010 --> 02:26:52.020 align:start position:0%
have to that and and the second to that
 
02:26:55.070 --> 02:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
is the another opposition is that
 
02:26:58.130 --> 02:26:58.140 align:start position:0%
foreign entities will the word when you
 
02:27:00.710 --> 02:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
say is retaliate or perhaps the state
 
02:27:03.410 --> 02:27:03.420 align:start position:0%
will lose business because
 
02:27:05.150 --> 02:27:05.160 align:start position:0%
um worldwide reporting would mean
 
02:27:06.950 --> 02:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
International companies would no longer
 
02:27:08.750 --> 02:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
do business in New Hampshire so I'm
 
02:27:10.610 --> 02:27:10.620 align:start position:0%
curious as to what your thoughts and
 
02:27:14.870 --> 02:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
response are to those opposition points
 
02:27:19.250 --> 02:27:19.260 align:start position:0%
uh yes uh and when I was saying that the
 
02:27:22.250 --> 02:27:22.260 align:start position:0%
tax uh was administerable
 
02:27:25.070 --> 02:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
uh I was including within that a
 
02:27:26.929 --> 02:27:26.939 align:start position:0%
judgment as to the determination of the
 
02:27:29.510 --> 02:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
unitary business group because that is
 
02:27:32.210 --> 02:27:32.220 align:start position:0%
the beginning point with regard to any
 
02:27:35.389 --> 02:27:35.399 align:start position:0%
kind of combined reporting we did that
 
02:27:38.929 --> 02:27:38.939 align:start position:0%
we did that successfully in the 70s and
 
02:27:43.610 --> 02:27:43.620 align:start position:0%
80s in a in a in a wide range of states
 
02:27:46.910 --> 02:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
in a dozen States including again the
 
02:27:48.889 --> 02:27:48.899 align:start position:0%
smallest states in the country
 
02:27:52.190 --> 02:27:52.200 align:start position:0%
we did there is no record of inordinate
 
02:27:55.490 --> 02:27:55.500 align:start position:0%
disputes in our in those small states
 
02:27:57.830 --> 02:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
over the composition of the unitary
 
02:28:00.710 --> 02:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
groups we did not have any more
 
02:28:03.050 --> 02:28:03.060 align:start position:0%
difficulty with regard to multinational
 
02:28:05.330 --> 02:28:05.340 align:start position:0%
as opposed to nationally based companies
 
02:28:07.750 --> 02:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
or foreign corporations versus U.S
 
02:28:09.889 --> 02:28:09.899 align:start position:0%
multinationals to my knowledge that's
 
02:28:12.349 --> 02:28:12.359 align:start position:0%
the best of my recollection because we
 
02:28:15.650 --> 02:28:15.660 align:start position:0%
just did not have inordinate cases uh
 
02:28:18.410 --> 02:28:18.420 align:start position:0%
California did some rather sophisticated
 
02:28:23.150 --> 02:28:23.160 align:start position:0%
methods of of uh of uh uh late in the
 
02:28:25.969 --> 02:28:25.979 align:start position:0%
stage of their practices of de-combining
 
02:28:27.889 --> 02:28:27.899 align:start position:0%
Etc some of the rest of us thought that
 
02:28:30.410 --> 02:28:30.420 align:start position:0%
they were uh getting a little bit fancy
 
02:28:33.710 --> 02:28:33.720 align:start position:0%
at that time that was more uh of a A
 
02:28:36.590 --> 02:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
variation of that time that I think uh
 
02:28:39.950 --> 02:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
was not uh uh necessarily consistent
 
02:28:42.950 --> 02:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
with the longer term practices that both
 
02:28:44.809 --> 02:28:44.819 align:start position:0%
that state and the smaller States had
 
02:28:46.570 --> 02:28:46.580 align:start position:0%
engaged in and that was I think was an
 
02:28:49.730 --> 02:28:49.740 align:start position:0%
idiosyncratic kind of situation that
 
02:28:54.230 --> 02:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
arose late in the uh process of of their
 
02:28:57.110 --> 02:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
use of combined reporting uh and I don't
 
02:28:59.750 --> 02:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
think that was typical we hadn't we had
 
02:29:01.730 --> 02:29:01.740 align:start position:0%
no greater difficulty applying the
 
02:29:04.969 --> 02:29:04.979 align:start position:0%
unitary principle to form to foreign
 
02:29:07.130 --> 02:29:07.140 align:start position:0%
multinationals than we did to U.S
 
02:29:09.410 --> 02:29:09.420 align:start position:0%
multinationals or to National companies
 
02:29:12.349 --> 02:29:12.359 align:start position:0%
operating within the United States
 
02:29:14.690 --> 02:29:14.700 align:start position:0%
um as to retaliation
 
02:29:17.150 --> 02:29:17.160 align:start position:0%
the last slide that Professor helenstein
 
02:29:19.250 --> 02:29:19.260 align:start position:0%
had up referred to the fact that the
 
02:29:20.690 --> 02:29:20.700 align:start position:0%
state's receipt it was not a pretty
 
02:29:23.630 --> 02:29:23.640 align:start position:0%
picture in the 1980s when the states
 
02:29:27.190 --> 02:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
were receded from Water's Edge
 
02:29:31.190 --> 02:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
they were threatened with economic
 
02:29:35.090 --> 02:29:35.100 align:start position:0%
damage by Foreign corporations saying we
 
02:29:37.610 --> 02:29:37.620 align:start position:0%
will not locate we will not invest in
 
02:29:40.250 --> 02:29:40.260 align:start position:0%
your States anymore if you don't repeal
 
02:29:42.950 --> 02:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
Waters Edge now I will give you the term
 
02:29:45.110 --> 02:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
that I apply to it others would find it
 
02:29:47.929 --> 02:29:47.939 align:start position:0%
too strong but I considered that I was
 
02:29:50.750 --> 02:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
present when that was message was issued
 
02:29:53.570 --> 02:29:53.580 align:start position:0%
to the Montana legislature and I was
 
02:29:55.670 --> 02:29:55.680 align:start position:0%
representing the department as deputy
 
02:29:58.190 --> 02:29:58.200 align:start position:0%
director on legislative relations
 
02:30:00.710 --> 02:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
I considered that then and I consider it
 
02:30:03.110 --> 02:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
now to have been economic blackmail
 
02:30:05.510 --> 02:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
and let me give you evidence of that I
 
02:30:07.849 --> 02:30:07.859 align:start position:0%
was referred the letter that came to the
 
02:30:10.370 --> 02:30:10.380 align:start position:0%
governor of the state at that time that
 
02:30:16.309 --> 02:30:16.319 align:start position:0%
came from the um uh uh Mr Akio Morita
 
02:30:20.150 --> 02:30:20.160 align:start position:0%
the head of the Sony Corporation and he
 
02:30:22.610 --> 02:30:22.620 align:start position:0%
was also writing on behalf of the
 
02:30:25.130 --> 02:30:25.140 align:start position:0%
Japanese business Confederate Federation
 
02:30:29.510 --> 02:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
which is I've got a uh the the kadaran
 
02:30:31.910 --> 02:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
the kaidanron I may not be pronouncing
 
02:30:33.110 --> 02:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
that right but that's the Japanese
 
02:30:35.570 --> 02:30:35.580 align:start position:0%
business Federation and he wrote this
 
02:30:35.580 --> 02:30:36.349 align:start position:0%
business Federation and he wrote this
letter

02:30:36.349 --> 02:30:36.359 align:start position:0%
letter
 
02:30:40.870 --> 02:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
that said basically that if you do not
 
02:30:44.870 --> 02:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
repeal worldwide unitary and adopt
 
02:30:48.290 --> 02:30:48.300 align:start position:0%
Water's Edge reporting instead you will
 
02:30:52.429 --> 02:30:52.439 align:start position:0%
not get any new investment from Japanese
 
02:30:56.090 --> 02:30:56.100 align:start position:0%
companies in your state but if but the
 
02:30:59.690 --> 02:30:59.700 align:start position:0%
implication was if you did repeal it
 
02:31:03.650 --> 02:31:03.660 align:start position:0%
um you would get Investments and and so
 
02:31:05.870 --> 02:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
they laid out the prospect
 
02:31:08.809 --> 02:31:08.819 align:start position:0%
of computer chip plants and high-tech
 
02:31:11.210 --> 02:31:11.220 align:start position:0%
Electronics plants of other kinds and
 
02:31:13.309 --> 02:31:13.319 align:start position:0%
automobile plants that would arrive in
 
02:31:16.490 --> 02:31:16.500 align:start position:0%
our state if only we would repeal
 
02:31:18.349 --> 02:31:18.359 align:start position:0%
worldwide unitary
 
02:31:20.510 --> 02:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
and under the threat of no investment
 
02:31:23.270 --> 02:31:23.280 align:start position:0%
from those Japanese companies the state
 
02:31:26.809 --> 02:31:26.819 align:start position:0%
of Montana the legislature receded to
 
02:31:31.490 --> 02:31:31.500 align:start position:0%
the water's edge as they had urged
 
02:31:35.330 --> 02:31:35.340 align:start position:0%
well it's 35 years later
 
02:31:37.309 --> 02:31:37.319 align:start position:0%
we're still waiting for those computer
 
02:31:40.010 --> 02:31:40.020 align:start position:0%
chip factories we're still waiting for
 
02:31:42.889 --> 02:31:42.899 align:start position:0%
those automobile plants they never came
 
02:31:47.150 --> 02:31:47.160 align:start position:0%
that was a phony threat it was I I just
 
02:31:50.870 --> 02:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
it was a Despicable campaign that was
 
02:31:55.150 --> 02:31:55.160 align:start position:0%
undertaken against the a an entirely
 
02:31:58.490 --> 02:31:58.500 align:start position:0%
constitutional proper and fair practice
 
02:32:02.630 --> 02:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
of the states that only asks a
 
02:32:06.349 --> 02:32:06.359 align:start position:0%
multinational corporation to pay taxes
 
02:32:10.309 --> 02:32:10.319 align:start position:0%
on the on the same basis as a small
 
02:32:12.889 --> 02:32:12.899 align:start position:0%
business in a state as a national
 
02:32:17.389 --> 02:32:17.399 align:start position:0%
business in a a pays taxes in a com
 
02:32:20.690 --> 02:32:20.700 align:start position:0%
Water's Edge combined reporting state it
 
02:32:24.410 --> 02:32:24.420 align:start position:0%
only requires equal compliance is all it
 
02:32:24.420 --> 02:32:25.610 align:start position:0%
only requires equal compliance is all it
does

02:32:25.610 --> 02:32:25.620 align:start position:0%
does
 
02:32:27.590 --> 02:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
and to say that you want getting
 
02:32:30.469 --> 02:32:30.479 align:start position:0%
investment for treating the company in
 
02:32:31.969 --> 02:32:31.979 align:start position:0%
the same way that every other business
 
02:32:33.950 --> 02:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
is treated isn't like in my judgment
 
02:32:33.960 --> 02:32:35.690 align:start position:0%
is treated isn't like in my judgment
reprehensible

02:32:35.690 --> 02:32:35.700 align:start position:0%
reprehensible
 
02:32:41.990 --> 02:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:45.950 --> 02:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
yes representative ulery yeah rep Jordan
 
02:32:48.349 --> 02:32:48.359 align:start position:0%
ullery from Hudson New Hampshire uh I've
 
02:32:49.790 --> 02:32:49.800 align:start position:0%
asked this question of others you've
 
02:32:51.950 --> 02:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
probably heard it regarding
 
02:32:54.530 --> 02:32:54.540 align:start position:0%
um a company an international company in
 
02:32:58.250 --> 02:32:58.260 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire with a loss overseas and
 
02:32:59.990 --> 02:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
then turn just transferring the profits
 
02:33:02.809 --> 02:33:02.819 align:start position:0%
over there and and showing uh uh uh
 
02:33:04.910 --> 02:33:04.920 align:start position:0%
business loss therefore not having to
 
02:33:09.290 --> 02:33:09.300 align:start position:0%
pay any taxes at all under either uh uh
 
02:33:11.990 --> 02:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
business profits tax or uh I mean then
 
02:33:14.210 --> 02:33:14.220 align:start position:0%
subject only to our business Enterprise
 
02:33:17.809 --> 02:33:17.819 align:start position:0%
tax which is a tax on hiring people
 
02:33:21.849 --> 02:33:21.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:25.070 --> 02:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
how how would New Hampshire benefit from
 
02:33:28.250 --> 02:33:28.260 align:start position:0%
a worldwide unitary uh taxation
 
02:33:31.130 --> 02:33:31.140 align:start position:0%
if a business can just
 
02:33:33.110 --> 02:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
write off their profits
 
02:33:36.110 --> 02:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
to another division
 
02:33:39.849 --> 02:33:39.859 align:start position:0%
well uh uh uh
 
02:33:43.250 --> 02:33:43.260 align:start position:0%
Miss Sharon commission member I said I'm
 
02:33:43.260 --> 02:33:46.929 align:start position:0%
Miss Sharon commission member I said I'm
sorry

02:33:46.929 --> 02:33:46.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:50.389 --> 02:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
02:33:53.210 --> 02:33:53.220 align:start position:0%
the the answer is this is that if you if
 
02:33:55.730 --> 02:33:55.740 align:start position:0%
you have a if you have a business that
 
02:33:58.910 --> 02:33:58.920 align:start position:0%
is truly losing money in terms of the uh
 
02:34:01.429 --> 02:34:01.439 align:start position:0%
if you if they're conducting a unitary
 
02:34:04.190 --> 02:34:04.200 align:start position:0%
business in your state be it onshore or
 
02:34:07.790 --> 02:34:07.800 align:start position:0%
offshore and they're truly uh uh losing
 
02:34:10.370 --> 02:34:10.380 align:start position:0%
money in total
 
02:34:14.450 --> 02:34:14.460 align:start position:0%
on on a real true basis yes they will
 
02:34:17.030 --> 02:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
have that they will not pay taxes in
 
02:34:18.770 --> 02:34:18.780 align:start position:0%
your state in that particular year
 
02:34:21.670 --> 02:34:21.680 align:start position:0%
that's true because they are actually
 
02:34:24.290 --> 02:34:24.300 align:start position:0%
truly losing money
 
02:34:27.050 --> 02:34:27.060 align:start position:0%
but the and and that's fair in that
 
02:34:30.050 --> 02:34:30.060 align:start position:0%
instance that yeah I'm talking about and
 
02:34:34.070 --> 02:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
to uh if if that is truly the case but
 
02:34:36.050 --> 02:34:36.060 align:start position:0%
what the reality is
 
02:34:40.490 --> 02:34:40.500 align:start position:0%
is that uh and the reason why uh there's
 
02:34:43.849 --> 02:34:43.859 align:start position:0%
a revenue gain and the reason why there
 
02:34:46.550 --> 02:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
will not be Revenue volatility
 
02:34:48.830 --> 02:34:48.840 align:start position:0%
is that that is not the typical
 
02:34:51.770 --> 02:34:51.780 align:start position:0%
circumstance that is occurring
 
02:34:54.710 --> 02:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
what is happening right now is that
 
02:34:58.389 --> 02:34:58.399 align:start position:0%
states that the multinational foreign
 
02:35:00.530 --> 02:35:00.540 align:start position:0%
multinationals both U.S and foreign
 
02:35:04.070 --> 02:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
multinationals are generating artificial
 
02:35:04.080 --> 02:35:05.630 align:start position:0%
multinationals are generating artificial
losses

02:35:05.630 --> 02:35:05.640 align:start position:0%
losses
 
02:35:09.710 --> 02:35:09.720 align:start position:0%
uh deductions against their U.S income
 
02:35:14.090 --> 02:35:14.100 align:start position:0%
by by shifting profits overseas through
 
02:35:16.070 --> 02:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
various mechanisms
 
02:35:17.990 --> 02:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes they involve intangible
 
02:35:20.090 --> 02:35:20.100 align:start position:0%
sometimes they involve other mechanisms
 
02:35:22.670 --> 02:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
to tax Havens
 
02:35:25.929 --> 02:35:25.939 align:start position:0%
and that those are artificial losses
 
02:35:30.849 --> 02:35:30.859 align:start position:0%
that that are being deducted against
 
02:35:35.210 --> 02:35:35.220 align:start position:0%
your tax returns today and what what
 
02:35:38.750 --> 02:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
combined reporting does is end the
 
02:35:41.270 --> 02:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
fictional losses and brings that money
 
02:35:45.230 --> 02:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
back into the worldwide group and and
 
02:35:48.050 --> 02:35:48.060 align:start position:0%
makes it taxable you're not going to
 
02:35:51.650 --> 02:35:51.660 align:start position:0%
have a massive loss of Revenue because
 
02:35:53.870 --> 02:35:53.880 align:start position:0%
of the situation that you've just
 
02:35:56.450 --> 02:35:56.460 align:start position:0%
described businesses go up and down they
 
02:35:58.370 --> 02:35:58.380 align:start position:0%
have profits and losses that's the
 
02:36:01.490 --> 02:36:01.500 align:start position:0%
normal that normal business activity is
 
02:36:03.349 --> 02:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
not going to generate overwhelming
 
02:36:06.410 --> 02:36:06.420 align:start position:0%
losses in a given State what is
 
02:36:08.870 --> 02:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
generating overwhelming losses right now
 
02:36:11.929 --> 02:36:11.939 align:start position:0%
is the artificial shifting of profits
 
02:36:13.550 --> 02:36:13.560 align:start position:0%
that they are earning in New Hampshire
 
02:36:16.190 --> 02:36:16.200 align:start position:0%
right now and they're shifting it
 
02:36:16.200 --> 02:36:17.590 align:start position:0%
right now and they're shifting it
overseas

02:36:17.590 --> 02:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
overseas
 
02:36:21.290 --> 02:36:21.300 align:start position:0%
uh and into tax Havens and what
 
02:36:23.510 --> 02:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
worldwide combined reporting does is it
 
02:36:26.389 --> 02:36:26.399 align:start position:0%
puts an end to that profit shifting and
 
02:36:29.690 --> 02:36:29.700 align:start position:0%
you will have a net it I don't recommend
 
02:36:32.150 --> 02:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
this on the basis that you're trying to
 
02:36:34.309 --> 02:36:34.319 align:start position:0%
gain more Revenue you're only trying to
 
02:36:36.469 --> 02:36:36.479 align:start position:0%
tax the revenue that you should fairly
 
02:36:39.710 --> 02:36:39.720 align:start position:0%
tax and when you do that in the context
 
02:36:41.349 --> 02:36:41.359 align:start position:0%
of the extensive
 
02:36:43.910 --> 02:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
unacceptable profit shifting that is
 
02:36:45.950 --> 02:36:45.960 align:start position:0%
occurring artificial profit shifting
 
02:36:48.349 --> 02:36:48.359 align:start position:0%
that is occurring overseas there will be
 
02:36:50.990 --> 02:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
a revenue gain produced and there will
 
02:36:53.809 --> 02:36:53.819 align:start position:0%
be an anchor to your revenues that
 
02:36:56.570 --> 02:36:56.580 align:start position:0%
decrease the revenue the effect of any
 
02:36:59.150 --> 02:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
Revenue uh volatility because of the
 
02:37:01.030 --> 02:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
normal business cycle
 
02:37:03.590 --> 02:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
the profits that are being stashed
 
02:37:06.650 --> 02:37:06.660 align:start position:0%
overseas and hidden from taxation are
 
02:37:10.010 --> 02:37:10.020 align:start position:0%
enormous and they and it's a it's a it's
 
02:37:12.530 --> 02:37:12.540 align:start position:0%
a practice that needs to be stopped and
 
02:37:16.429 --> 02:37:16.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:20.090 --> 02:37:20.100 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much Mr bucks
 
02:37:22.490 --> 02:37:22.500 align:start position:0%
um we have one further presenter before
 
02:37:25.010 --> 02:37:25.020 align:start position:0%
we take our brief break
 
02:37:27.110 --> 02:37:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
02:37:29.030 --> 02:37:29.040 align:start position:0%

has been a previous flyer with the New
Hampshire

02:37:42.730 --> 02:37:42.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:37:45.110 --> 02:37:45.120 align:start position:0%
legislature and provided advice so
 
02:37:47.630 --> 02:37:47.640 align:start position:0%
welcome back again even though your last
 
02:37:51.290 --> 02:37:51.300 align:start position:0%
visit was preceding me
 
02:37:53.450 --> 02:37:53.460 align:start position:0%
well it's great to be back
 
02:37:55.250 --> 02:37:55.260 align:start position:0%
um having grown up on the east coast and
 
02:37:56.929 --> 02:37:56.939 align:start position:0%
been to New Hampshire I missed the fall
 
02:37:59.270 --> 02:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
and I would I wish I were there in
 
02:37:59.280 --> 02:38:00.469 align:start position:0%
and I would I wish I were there in
person

02:38:00.469 --> 02:38:00.479 align:start position:0%
person
 
02:38:02.990 --> 02:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
um can I share my some slides is that
 
02:38:05.570 --> 02:38:05.580 align:start position:0%
how Professor college team did it
 
02:38:25.670 --> 02:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:29.690 --> 02:38:29.700 align:start position:0%
you guys do slides yes we do
 
02:38:33.110 --> 02:38:33.120 align:start position:0%
you do oh terrific uh we've got a
 
02:38:34.849 --> 02:38:34.859 align:start position:0%
smaller image of you in the upper left
 
02:38:36.950 --> 02:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
and a prominent image we also have a
 
02:38:41.330 --> 02:38:41.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:41.340 --> 02:38:50.570 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:38:50.570 --> 02:38:50.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:54.349 --> 02:38:54.359 align:start position:0%
okay so yeah I apologize my only issue
 
02:38:56.929 --> 02:38:56.939 align:start position:0%
is I'm not seeing the slides myself so I
 
02:39:00.590 --> 02:39:00.600 align:start position:0%
don't but I will just begin and build
 
02:39:03.230 --> 02:39:03.240 align:start position:0%
them knowing where I'm at and hopefully
 
02:39:05.990 --> 02:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
let me know so it's an honor to be here
 
02:39:08.450 --> 02:39:08.460 align:start position:0%
I will go quickly I try to come up with
 
02:39:11.809 --> 02:39:11.819 align:start position:0%
an agenda um that reflects
 
02:39:13.730 --> 02:39:13.740 align:start position:0%
um the fact that I knew I'd be following
 
02:39:15.950 --> 02:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
people who I want to say a lot of other
 
02:39:19.730 --> 02:39:19.740 align:start position:0%
things I still manage to duplicate a lot
 
02:39:21.410 --> 02:39:21.420 align:start position:0%
of what you've said I've been said
 
02:39:23.330 --> 02:39:23.340 align:start position:0%
already so I want to leave as much time
 
02:39:26.450 --> 02:39:26.460 align:start position:0%
as possible to answer questions so I
 
02:39:28.309 --> 02:39:28.319 align:start position:0%
want to talk a little bit about New
 
02:39:28.319 --> 02:39:29.210 align:start position:0%
want to talk a little bit about New
Hampshire

02:39:29.210 --> 02:39:29.220 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:39:31.010 --> 02:39:31.020 align:start position:0%
um which most of course you know a
 
02:39:32.570 --> 02:39:32.580 align:start position:0%
little bit about profit shifting about
 
02:39:34.730 --> 02:39:34.740 align:start position:0%
the policy behind worldwide combination
 
02:39:38.990 --> 02:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
and then mostly focus on responses to
 
02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:42.650 align:start position:0%
and then mostly focus on responses to
objections

02:39:42.650 --> 02:39:42.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:45.230 --> 02:39:45.240 align:start position:0%
okay so if you see this live about New
 
02:39:46.910 --> 02:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire expenditures is that what am I
 
02:39:49.849 --> 02:39:49.859 align:start position:0%
am I on say you're on uh the caption
 
02:39:54.889 --> 02:39:54.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:56.270 --> 02:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
ay sounds like you want to move ahead
 
02:39:56.280 --> 02:39:57.469 align:start position:0%
ay sounds like you want to move ahead
too

02:39:57.469 --> 02:39:57.479 align:start position:0%
too
 
02:39:57.479 --> 02:39:58.670 align:start position:0%
too
right

02:39:58.670 --> 02:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:40:01.849 --> 02:40:01.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:01.859 --> 02:40:03.349 align:start position:0%
 
just

02:40:03.349 --> 02:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:40:06.010 --> 02:40:06.020 align:start position:0%
embarrassed at this point in
 
02:40:08.389 --> 02:40:08.399 align:start position:0%
virtual world that I'm not able to
 
02:40:10.429 --> 02:40:10.439 align:start position:0%
operate teams and fashion effectively
 
02:40:22.010 --> 02:40:22.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:24.950 --> 02:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you what I would suggest just
 
02:40:27.770 --> 02:40:27.780 align:start position:0%
go ahead because we do have uh just go
 
02:40:37.790 --> 02:40:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:39.290 --> 02:40:39.300 align:start position:0%
you have to slash in front of you so
 
02:40:41.330 --> 02:40:41.340 align:start position:0%
I'll just go quickly so I have some
 
02:40:42.650 --> 02:40:42.660 align:start position:0%
information just about New Hampshire
 
02:40:45.290 --> 02:40:45.300 align:start position:0%
expenditures and revenues um from the
 
02:40:47.090 --> 02:40:47.100 align:start position:0%
urban Institute from a high quality
 
02:40:48.770 --> 02:40:48.780 align:start position:0%
report a lot of these reports are not
 
02:40:49.969 --> 02:40:49.979 align:start position:0%
that high quality but the urban
 
02:40:53.570 --> 02:40:53.580 align:start position:0%
Institute is so in New Hampshire is you
 
02:40:55.550 --> 02:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
know slightly below average both in
 
02:40:58.670 --> 02:40:58.680 align:start position:0%
taxes and revenues more interesting
 
02:41:00.950 --> 02:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
um if you look at the um the the chart
 
02:41:03.650 --> 02:41:03.660 align:start position:0%
on the third page is it actually shows
 
02:41:05.090 --> 02:41:05.100 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire in terms of its
 
02:41:07.130 --> 02:41:07.140 align:start position:0%
physical capacity
 
02:41:09.170 --> 02:41:09.180 align:start position:0%
um doesn't raise nearly as much as it
 
02:41:11.090 --> 02:41:11.100 align:start position:0%
might so the hash is not really a low
 
02:41:13.370 --> 02:41:13.380 align:start position:0%
tax state but it is a Frugal State uh
 
02:41:15.590 --> 02:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
right one that punches um above its
 
02:41:18.349 --> 02:41:18.359 align:start position:0%
weight and something that I presume um
 
02:41:20.809 --> 02:41:20.819 align:start position:0%
you'd like to continue
 
02:41:22.910 --> 02:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire state taxes as I know
 
02:41:24.410 --> 02:41:24.420 align:start position:0%
you've already talked about this is the
 
02:41:26.630 --> 02:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
on the next slide
 
02:41:29.330 --> 02:41:29.340 align:start position:0%
um has an unusual tax structure right
 
02:41:31.550 --> 02:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
there's no General personal income tax
 
02:41:33.889 --> 02:41:33.899 align:start position:0%
there's no general sales tax what New
 
02:41:35.030 --> 02:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does have is the business
 
02:41:36.950 --> 02:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
profits tax the business entities tax
 
02:41:39.110 --> 02:41:39.120 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire raises twice the
 
02:41:40.490 --> 02:41:40.500 align:start position:0%
national average
 
02:41:43.190 --> 02:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
um from its uh property tax
 
02:41:46.070 --> 02:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
um the next slide is uh from your
 
02:41:48.590 --> 02:41:48.600 align:start position:0%
Consolidated financial statements
 
02:41:51.230 --> 02:41:51.240 align:start position:0%
showing that the BPT raises you know
 
02:41:53.210 --> 02:41:53.220 align:start position:0%
something on the order of 700 million
 
02:41:54.950 --> 02:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
dollars and as you know
 
02:41:58.070 --> 02:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
is the largest single Revenue source for
 
02:41:59.990 --> 02:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
the state
 
02:42:03.110 --> 02:42:03.120 align:start position:0%
um it's also the next slide of the best
 
02:42:05.270 --> 02:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
designed corporate income tax in the
 
02:42:05.280 --> 02:42:06.410 align:start position:0%
designed corporate income tax in the
country

02:42:06.410 --> 02:42:06.420 align:start position:0%
country
 
02:42:07.849 --> 02:42:07.859 align:start position:0%
um in part because it's the only
 
02:42:09.170 --> 02:42:09.180 align:start position:0%
corporate income tax that doesn't just
 
02:42:10.969 --> 02:42:10.979 align:start position:0%
tax corporate corporations
 
02:42:13.010 --> 02:42:13.020 align:start position:0%
um there's no reason to not tax large
 
02:42:15.830 --> 02:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
businesses the same as corporations I
 
02:42:18.050 --> 02:42:18.060 align:start position:0%
tell that to other state legislatures
 
02:42:19.730 --> 02:42:19.740 align:start position:0%
all around the country
 
02:42:23.090 --> 02:42:23.100 align:start position:0%
um and at no success but but you are
 
02:42:25.130 --> 02:42:25.140 align:start position:0%
doing um the right thing
 
02:42:26.750 --> 02:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire's business Enterprise
 
02:42:29.270 --> 02:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
taxes in addition addition method
 
02:42:32.210 --> 02:42:32.220 align:start position:0%
sub-national value added tax which is
 
02:42:35.030 --> 02:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
also terrific and I talk about across um
 
02:42:37.910 --> 02:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
of the country and so in lots of ways
 
02:42:41.389 --> 02:42:41.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has got its own way wisely
 
02:42:43.849 --> 02:42:43.859 align:start position:0%
in order to raise money
 
02:42:43.859 --> 02:42:45.349 align:start position:0%
in order to raise money
um efficiently

02:42:45.349 --> 02:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
um efficiently
 
02:42:47.870 --> 02:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
so I I think that's at least for me
 
02:42:50.150 --> 02:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
important context in terms of what we're
 
02:42:51.590 --> 02:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
02:42:53.330 --> 02:42:53.340 align:start position:0%
next slide I talk a little bit about
 
02:42:55.010 --> 02:42:55.020 align:start position:0%
what profit shifting is I know this has
 
02:42:56.389 --> 02:42:56.399 align:start position:0%
been addressed there are questions right
 
02:42:58.969 --> 02:42:58.979 align:start position:0%
how does money get abroad um and the
 
02:43:00.349 --> 02:43:00.359 align:start position:0%
answer is
 
02:43:02.929 --> 02:43:02.939 align:start position:0%
uh Corporation with operations abroad
 
02:43:05.510 --> 02:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
which is a simple example can shift
 
02:43:07.370 --> 02:43:07.380 align:start position:0%
their intellectual property to a low tax
 
02:43:09.650 --> 02:43:09.660 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction the low tax jurisdiction
 
02:43:12.650 --> 02:43:12.660 align:start position:0%
charges royalties and profits are out of
 
02:43:15.950 --> 02:43:15.960 align:start position:0%
the U.S tax base and into a foreign tax
 
02:43:18.410 --> 02:43:18.420 align:start position:0%
Haven now the question is right how much
 
02:43:21.290 --> 02:43:21.300 align:start position:0%
is it how big is the problem including
 
02:43:23.570 --> 02:43:23.580 align:start position:0%
how big is the problem now after the tax
 
02:43:25.610 --> 02:43:25.620 align:start position:0%
costs of jobs apps to the extent people
 
02:43:27.889 --> 02:43:27.899 align:start position:0%
perceive that that act had Provisions
 
02:43:29.389 --> 02:43:29.399 align:start position:0%
meant to counter
 
02:43:30.889 --> 02:43:30.899 align:start position:0%
um tax shifting and so this is the next
 
02:43:33.110 --> 02:43:33.120 align:start position:0%
slide so the current estimate is that
 
02:43:35.990 --> 02:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
it's about 300 billion
 
02:43:38.090 --> 02:43:38.100 align:start position:0%
um and that's again current right so
 
02:43:40.010 --> 02:43:40.020 align:start position:0%
this is not historic so this is despite
 
02:43:42.530 --> 02:43:42.540 align:start position:0%
the tax cuts and jobs act
 
02:43:44.210 --> 02:43:44.220 align:start position:0%
um now the question is that well how
 
02:43:45.950 --> 02:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
much would that mean
 
02:43:47.510 --> 02:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
um for instance if that money were
 
02:43:49.250 --> 02:43:49.260 align:start position:0%
brought back into the tax base how much
 
02:43:50.570 --> 02:43:50.580 align:start position:0%
could that raise
 
02:43:52.309 --> 02:43:52.319 align:start position:0%
um for New Hampshire the back of the
 
02:43:53.870 --> 02:43:53.880 align:start position:0%
envelope calculation is working
 
02:43:56.870 --> 02:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
backwards as to how much the percentage
 
02:43:58.910 --> 02:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire's tax base would
 
02:44:02.690 --> 02:44:02.700 align:start position:0%
increase it gives us a number around 140
 
02:44:05.570 --> 02:44:05.580 align:start position:0%
million dollars per year which I think
 
02:44:08.690 --> 02:44:08.700 align:start position:0%
not surprisingly is about the same rough
 
02:44:11.389 --> 02:44:11.399 align:start position:0%
estimate as the itap study arrived at
 
02:44:13.370 --> 02:44:13.380 align:start position:0%
okay this is all back of the envelope I
 
02:44:15.290 --> 02:44:15.300 align:start position:0%
miss providing this to you so you
 
02:44:17.590 --> 02:44:17.600 align:start position:0%
understand that these are reasonable
 
02:44:21.349 --> 02:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
estimates you a question arose well
 
02:44:23.990 --> 02:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
shouldn't the IRS be doing something
 
02:44:25.429 --> 02:44:25.439 align:start position:0%
um about this 300 billion dollars
 
02:44:28.190 --> 02:44:28.200 align:start position:0%
leaving the U.S tax base yes
 
02:44:29.630 --> 02:44:29.640 align:start position:0%
um they are failing
 
02:44:31.550 --> 02:44:31.560 align:start position:0%
um of course it's not just the U.S
 
02:44:33.230 --> 02:44:33.240 align:start position:0%
national tax Authority that's fairly
 
02:44:35.210 --> 02:44:35.220 align:start position:0%
that's why the whole oecd is a flutter
 
02:44:37.790 --> 02:44:37.800 align:start position:0%
about this issue but
 
02:44:40.849 --> 02:44:40.859 align:start position:0%
but yes they should but they're not
 
02:44:43.070 --> 02:44:43.080 align:start position:0%
next slide I have a couple of pictures
 
02:44:46.490 --> 02:44:46.500 align:start position:0%
of just to show what tax shifting looks
 
02:44:48.770 --> 02:44:48.780 align:start position:0%
like it means and if you look at the
 
02:44:51.469 --> 02:44:51.479 align:start position:0%
first picture that in this case U.S
 
02:44:53.330 --> 02:44:53.340 align:start position:0%
multinationals are booking enormous
 
02:44:55.490 --> 02:44:55.500 align:start position:0%
profits in a head full of low-tax
 
02:44:58.309 --> 02:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions and the profits are out of
 
02:45:00.889 --> 02:45:00.899 align:start position:0%
all proportion onto the Assets in those
 
02:45:00.899 --> 02:45:02.450 align:start position:0%
all proportion onto the Assets in those
jurisdictions

02:45:02.450 --> 02:45:02.460 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions
 
02:45:04.490 --> 02:45:04.500 align:start position:0%
um if you go to the next slide called a
 
02:45:07.690 --> 02:45:07.700 align:start position:0%
more evocative debt slide
 
02:45:10.790 --> 02:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
shows for instance that U.S
 
02:45:13.250 --> 02:45:13.260 align:start position:0%
multinationals book profits in foreign
 
02:45:15.710 --> 02:45:15.720 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions that are multiples of
 
02:45:18.410 --> 02:45:18.420 align:start position:0%
those entire countries gdps and what
 
02:45:20.030 --> 02:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
that illustrates right is that it's
 
02:45:24.050 --> 02:45:24.060 align:start position:0%
clearly impossible for a foreign
 
02:45:26.870 --> 02:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
corporations to be having profits larger
 
02:45:28.670 --> 02:45:28.680 align:start position:0%
than the entire gross domestic product
 
02:45:30.650 --> 02:45:30.660 align:start position:0%
of the jurisdiction in which those
 
02:45:33.530 --> 02:45:33.540 align:start position:0%
profits are booked
 
02:45:36.469 --> 02:45:36.479 align:start position:0%
final table is called picture of
 
02:45:39.530 --> 02:45:39.540 align:start position:0%
opportunity shows a slide that about the
 
02:45:42.830 --> 02:45:42.840 align:start position:0%
percentage of business profits that are
 
02:45:46.010 --> 02:45:46.020 align:start position:0%
actually being successfully taxed
 
02:45:48.650 --> 02:45:48.660 align:start position:0%
and you'll see it's a sad number right
 
02:45:50.570 --> 02:45:50.580 align:start position:0%
that the federal government isn't doing
 
02:45:52.670 --> 02:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
very well and the states are doing even
 
02:45:52.680 --> 02:45:53.870 align:start position:0%
very well and the states are doing even
worse

02:45:53.870 --> 02:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
worse
 
02:45:55.309 --> 02:45:55.319 align:start position:0%
um I call it a picture of opportunity
 
02:45:57.830 --> 02:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
because it also indicates that if states
 
02:46:01.969 --> 02:46:01.979 align:start position:0%
only do as well as they did in 1993 that
 
02:46:04.550 --> 02:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
would be a gigantic increase to their
 
02:46:06.710 --> 02:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
corporate tasks
 
02:46:10.190 --> 02:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
okay so now to think about some
 
02:46:13.250 --> 02:46:13.260 align:start position:0%
objections one common one right is well
 
02:46:15.290 --> 02:46:15.300 align:start position:0%
nobody else is doing it and so the next
 
02:46:15.300 --> 02:46:16.490 align:start position:0%
nobody else is doing it and so the next
slide

02:46:16.490 --> 02:46:16.500 align:start position:0%
slide
 
02:46:18.469 --> 02:46:18.479 align:start position:0%
um is a quote from Charles McClure whose
 
02:46:20.270 --> 02:46:20.280 align:start position:0%
many ways the preeminent um tax
 
02:46:24.349 --> 02:46:24.359 align:start position:0%
Economist of last decades and I've heard
 
02:46:26.510 --> 02:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
him say use this analogy many times in
 
02:46:27.950 --> 02:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
connection with trying to get states to
 
02:46:29.450 --> 02:46:29.460 align:start position:0%
do the right thing about the sales tax
 
02:46:32.450 --> 02:46:32.460 align:start position:0%
totally different issue at his point
 
02:46:35.030 --> 02:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
right is that just because inexplicably
 
02:46:37.070 --> 02:46:37.080 align:start position:0%
every other state is doing something
 
02:46:39.770 --> 02:46:39.780 align:start position:0%
foolish uh doesn't mean that you should
 
02:46:41.750 --> 02:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
as well and I would think again going
 
02:46:44.090 --> 02:46:44.100 align:start position:0%
back to our introduction this argument
 
02:46:45.590 --> 02:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
should be particularly appealing in New
 
02:46:46.429 --> 02:46:46.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire well you've already
 
02:46:48.469 --> 02:46:48.479 align:start position:0%
demonstrated some interest in not just
 
02:46:50.389 --> 02:46:50.399 align:start position:0%
doing the same foolish thing that every
 
02:46:52.490 --> 02:46:52.500 align:start position:0%
other state is doing
 
02:46:54.170 --> 02:46:54.180 align:start position:0%
um we need to ask right now what every
 
02:46:55.550 --> 02:46:55.560 align:start position:0%
other state is doing but whether this
 
02:46:57.770 --> 02:46:57.780 align:start position:0%
makes sex so if you go to the next slide
 
02:47:00.410 --> 02:47:00.420 align:start position:0%
there's a picture of a building
 
02:47:02.270 --> 02:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
um from England
 
02:47:04.490 --> 02:47:04.500 align:start position:0%
um and it has the strange characteristic
 
02:47:07.190 --> 02:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
and If This Were a law school class I'd
 
02:47:08.690 --> 02:47:08.700 align:start position:0%
really draw this out but I'm not going
 
02:47:10.190 --> 02:47:10.200 align:start position:0%
to waste your time
 
02:47:12.290 --> 02:47:12.300 align:start position:0%
um that it's a picture of a way of a
 
02:47:14.690 --> 02:47:14.700 align:start position:0%
building with blocked windows and you
 
02:47:15.650 --> 02:47:15.660 align:start position:0%
know you don't need to know a lot about
 
02:47:17.330 --> 02:47:17.340 align:start position:0%
England to know that doesn't make a lot
 
02:47:19.910 --> 02:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
of sense um to build a building and then
 
02:47:22.309 --> 02:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
not have Windows and the question is why
 
02:47:24.770 --> 02:47:24.780 align:start position:0%
and the answer is that King William III
 
02:47:26.929 --> 02:47:26.939 align:start position:0%
thought it'd be a good idea to compose a
 
02:47:30.170 --> 02:47:30.180 align:start position:0%
tax on Windows and his theory and he can
 
02:47:32.150 --> 02:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
watch Downton Abbey you know it's not a
 
02:47:34.550 --> 02:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
crazy Theory rich people have to have
 
02:47:36.290 --> 02:47:36.300 align:start position:0%
more windows
 
02:47:37.730 --> 02:47:37.740 align:start position:0%
um it's easy to walk around and count
 
02:47:40.010 --> 02:47:40.020 align:start position:0%
the windows it seemed like a good idea
 
02:47:43.809 --> 02:47:43.819 align:start position:0%
for attacks but the problem is
 
02:47:46.250 --> 02:47:46.260 align:start position:0%
it's obvious people don't like paying
 
02:47:48.710 --> 02:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
taxes and they will engage in crazy
 
02:47:48.720 --> 02:47:49.969 align:start position:0%
taxes and they will engage in crazy
behavior

02:47:49.969 --> 02:47:49.979 align:start position:0%
behavior
 
02:47:52.969 --> 02:47:52.979 align:start position:0%
in order to avoid them which is why the
 
02:47:55.730 --> 02:47:55.740 align:start position:0%
first principle of sound tax policy is
 
02:47:58.190 --> 02:47:58.200 align:start position:0%
to have as broad a base as possible and
 
02:48:00.950 --> 02:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
the problem with having a Water's Edge
 
02:48:03.650 --> 02:48:03.660 align:start position:0%
regime is you're basically inviting
 
02:48:05.750 --> 02:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
these multinational corporations to
 
02:48:07.670 --> 02:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
shift income out right it just violates
 
02:48:11.030 --> 02:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
the basics of of tax policy not the tax
 
02:48:14.570 --> 02:48:14.580 align:start position:0%
as broad a base as possible
 
02:48:17.030 --> 02:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
so next slide um well okay well maybe
 
02:48:19.490 --> 02:48:19.500 align:start position:0%
it's it's Common Sense policy but won't
 
02:48:21.710 --> 02:48:21.720 align:start position:0%
all the businesses leave
 
02:48:24.410 --> 02:48:24.420 align:start position:0%
um important to talk about this um and I
 
02:48:25.730 --> 02:48:25.740 align:start position:0%
know it's been addressed already but
 
02:48:28.190 --> 02:48:28.200 align:start position:0%
just to be clear New Hampshire opposes
 
02:48:30.230 --> 02:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
its business profits tax not based on
 
02:48:31.969 --> 02:48:31.979 align:start position:0%
physical presence but on economic
 
02:48:33.950 --> 02:48:33.960 align:start position:0%
activity in the state New Hampshire
 
02:48:36.349 --> 02:48:36.359 align:start position:0%
currently abortions the business profit
 
02:48:38.630 --> 02:48:38.640 align:start position:0%
Stacks based on sales not based on
 
02:48:40.910 --> 02:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
property or payroll in the state and so
 
02:48:44.090 --> 02:48:44.100 align:start position:0%
there's no real economic thing that a
 
02:48:47.809 --> 02:48:47.819 align:start position:0%
big multinational taxpayer can do
 
02:48:49.910 --> 02:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
um to avoid paying these taxes other
 
02:48:51.889 --> 02:48:51.899 align:start position:0%
than stop making profitable sales in the
 
02:48:51.899 --> 02:48:52.610 align:start position:0%
than stop making profitable sales in the
state

02:48:52.610 --> 02:48:52.620 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:48:52.620 --> 02:48:53.809 align:start position:0%
state
okay

02:48:53.809 --> 02:48:53.819 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:48:55.610 --> 02:48:55.620 align:start position:0%
okay next slide
 
02:49:00.110 --> 02:49:00.120 align:start position:0%
um is a excerpt from a blog post which
 
02:49:01.250 --> 02:49:01.260 align:start position:0%
you might have seen from the tax
 
02:49:03.530 --> 02:49:03.540 align:start position:0%
Foundation talking about what a huge
 
02:49:03.540 --> 02:49:04.790 align:start position:0%
Foundation talking about what a huge
burden

02:49:04.790 --> 02:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
burden
 
02:49:06.830 --> 02:49:06.840 align:start position:0%
um worldwide combined reporting would be
 
02:49:09.110 --> 02:49:09.120 align:start position:0%
and I just wanted to pick apart this
 
02:49:10.730 --> 02:49:10.740 align:start position:0%
slide just the argument just a little
 
02:49:13.010 --> 02:49:13.020 align:start position:0%
bit right first of all there's a claim
 
02:49:15.110 --> 02:49:15.120 align:start position:0%
right that there's a massive increase in
 
02:49:18.050 --> 02:49:18.060 align:start position:0%
compliance burden but you know uncited
 
02:49:19.730 --> 02:49:19.740 align:start position:0%
no support
 
02:49:21.410 --> 02:49:21.420 align:start position:0%
um and the description is well look
 
02:49:22.490 --> 02:49:22.500 align:start position:0%
here's what you're going to have to do
 
02:49:24.590 --> 02:49:24.600 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to combine all
 
02:49:26.990 --> 02:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
these different International Accounting
 
02:49:28.849 --> 02:49:28.859 align:start position:0%
rules and you're going to have to do it
 
02:49:30.410 --> 02:49:30.420 align:start position:0%
and bring it into line with how New
 
02:49:32.750 --> 02:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would do it sounds pretty bad
 
02:49:34.730 --> 02:49:34.740 align:start position:0%
sounds pretty burdensome
 
02:49:35.870 --> 02:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
um and on top of that there are all
 
02:49:36.770 --> 02:49:36.780 align:start position:0%
these other things you're going to have
 
02:49:39.050 --> 02:49:39.060 align:start position:0%
to keep track of like payroll which you
 
02:49:40.910 --> 02:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to do but of course we
 
02:49:42.650 --> 02:49:42.660 align:start position:0%
just talked about that New Hampshire
 
02:49:44.750 --> 02:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
uses the sales Factor so actually all
 
02:49:46.730 --> 02:49:46.740 align:start position:0%
you have to do is keep track of sales
 
02:49:49.250 --> 02:49:49.260 align:start position:0%
if you go to the next slide I'm going to
 
02:49:51.410 --> 02:49:51.420 align:start position:0%
try to provide you some evidence such as
 
02:49:53.389 --> 02:49:53.399 align:start position:0%
there is about compliance costs because
 
02:49:55.250 --> 02:49:55.260 align:start position:0%
the argument was already made in the
 
02:49:57.050 --> 02:49:57.060 align:start position:0%
context of the Barclays case that
 
02:49:59.030 --> 02:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
worldwide component reporting
 
02:50:01.190 --> 02:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
is burdensome that
 
02:50:03.770 --> 02:50:03.780 align:start position:0%
argument was subjected to a trial and
 
02:50:05.990 --> 02:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
actually the Supreme Court in Barclay
 
02:50:07.610 --> 02:50:07.620 align:start position:0%
who cites the lower courts in California
 
02:50:10.730 --> 02:50:10.740 align:start position:0%
is finding that the cost was not very
 
02:50:13.250 --> 02:50:13.260 align:start position:0%
significant right that's the next Slide
 
02:50:16.070 --> 02:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
the site from Barclays the Supreme Court
 
02:50:19.330 --> 02:50:19.340 align:start position:0%
you go to the next slide titled also
 
02:50:22.670 --> 02:50:22.680 align:start position:0%
also explains why that's so the reason
 
02:50:25.490 --> 02:50:25.500 align:start position:0%
is that the California regulations
 
02:50:29.210 --> 02:50:29.220 align:start position:0%
permitted reasonable approximations of
 
02:50:31.730 --> 02:50:31.740 align:start position:0%
foreign income and sales and that those
 
02:50:33.469 --> 02:50:33.479 align:start position:0%
days the other factors
 
02:50:35.870 --> 02:50:35.880 align:start position:0%
and didn't require all these sort of
 
02:50:39.770 --> 02:50:39.780 align:start position:0%
crazy transfer of foreign income
 
02:50:43.309 --> 02:50:43.319 align:start position:0%
practices um into California practices
 
02:50:47.389 --> 02:50:47.399 align:start position:0%
the important Point California did give
 
02:50:49.490 --> 02:50:49.500 align:start position:0%
up mandatory worldwide combined
 
02:50:54.730 --> 02:50:54.740 align:start position:0%
reporting since I'm in 1987. however
 
02:50:57.770 --> 02:50:57.780 align:start position:0%
California's new situation is earns new
 
02:51:00.290 --> 02:51:00.300 align:start position:0%
since 1987 is worldwide combined
 
02:51:02.450 --> 02:51:02.460 align:start position:0%
reporting is still the default Rule and
 
02:51:04.429 --> 02:51:04.439 align:start position:0%
corporations can choose a Water's Edge
 
02:51:04.439 --> 02:51:05.510 align:start position:0%
corporations can choose a Water's Edge
election

02:51:05.510 --> 02:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
election
 
02:51:07.309 --> 02:51:07.319 align:start position:0%
that means these regulations are still
 
02:51:08.270 --> 02:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
in effect
 
02:51:10.730 --> 02:51:10.740 align:start position:0%
and that means that many tax
 
02:51:12.410 --> 02:51:12.420 align:start position:0%
pay particularly taxpayers to have
 
02:51:14.210 --> 02:51:14.220 align:start position:0%
losses abroad and want to take advantage
 
02:51:16.370 --> 02:51:16.380 align:start position:0%
of that and will benefit from worldwide
 
02:51:18.469 --> 02:51:18.479 align:start position:0%
combined reporting have been filing
 
02:51:20.450 --> 02:51:20.460 align:start position:0%
using the worldwide combined reporting
 
02:51:22.849 --> 02:51:22.859 align:start position:0%
method continuously over the preceding
 
02:51:25.670 --> 02:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
decades and has been administered by the
 
02:51:28.250 --> 02:51:28.260 align:start position:0%
by the franchise tax board and if you go
 
02:51:30.590 --> 02:51:30.600 align:start position:0%
down this route and I would recommend
 
02:51:32.270 --> 02:51:32.280 align:start position:0%
having your Department contact the
 
02:51:34.370 --> 02:51:34.380 align:start position:0%
franchise tax board about how they've
 
02:51:37.550 --> 02:51:37.560 align:start position:0%
been able to administer the tax and I
 
02:51:39.309 --> 02:51:39.319 align:start position:0%
will just say because I can't speak
 
02:51:41.929 --> 02:51:41.939 align:start position:0%
formally about this that they have not
 
02:51:44.150 --> 02:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
had a lot of difficulty because this is
 
02:51:46.550 --> 02:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
what what Dan box just told you but but
 
02:51:48.170 --> 02:51:48.180 align:start position:0%
as for yourself
 
02:51:48.180 --> 02:51:49.070 align:start position:0%
as for yourself
um

02:51:49.070 --> 02:51:49.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:51.290 --> 02:51:51.300 align:start position:0%
so go to the next slide write more
 
02:51:54.050 --> 02:51:54.060 align:start position:0%
fundamentally it just doesn't make a lot
 
02:51:55.370 --> 02:51:55.380 align:start position:0%
of sense
 
02:51:56.690 --> 02:51:56.700 align:start position:0%
um for these large multinational
 
02:51:58.610 --> 02:51:58.620 align:start position:0%
corporations to say they just have it's
 
02:52:00.889 --> 02:52:00.899 align:start position:0%
just too hard to figure out what their
 
02:52:03.650 --> 02:52:03.660 align:start position:0%
income is or where their sales are
 
02:52:06.710 --> 02:52:06.720 align:start position:0%
um interestingly and importantly perhaps
 
02:52:08.150 --> 02:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
if you're really worried about this
 
02:52:10.490 --> 02:52:10.500 align:start position:0%
compliance issue for purposes of the new
 
02:52:13.309 --> 02:52:13.319 align:start position:0%
corporate Alternative Minimum Tax the
 
02:52:15.230 --> 02:52:15.240 align:start position:0%
largest taxpayers are going to have to
 
02:52:17.690 --> 02:52:17.700 align:start position:0%
use financial statement income including
 
02:52:20.030 --> 02:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
of their foreign subsidiaries to create
 
02:52:22.309 --> 02:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
an aggregate picture of the financial
 
02:52:24.550 --> 02:52:24.560 align:start position:0%
state of the income of the whole group
 
02:52:26.389 --> 02:52:26.399 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:52:29.450 --> 02:52:29.460 align:start position:0%
if the concern is that this would be too
 
02:52:29.460 --> 02:52:30.830 align:start position:0%
if the concern is that this would be too
burdensome

02:52:30.830 --> 02:52:30.840 align:start position:0%
burdensome
 
02:52:33.830 --> 02:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
um for for smaller taxpayers then just
 
02:52:35.690 --> 02:52:35.700 align:start position:0%
say if you're subject to the corporate
 
02:52:38.389 --> 02:52:38.399 align:start position:0%
Alternative Minimum Tax then you're have
 
02:52:40.370 --> 02:52:40.380 align:start position:0%
to file at a worldwide basis because
 
02:52:41.809 --> 02:52:41.819 align:start position:0%
you're already doing something very
 
02:52:44.269 --> 02:52:44.279 align:start position:0%
similar um at the federal level if you
 
02:52:47.210 --> 02:52:47.220 align:start position:0%
go to the next slide titled really right
 
02:52:49.130 --> 02:52:49.140 align:start position:0%
that's just again I'm trying to provide
 
02:52:52.190 --> 02:52:52.200 align:start position:0%
you with evidence here's an example uh
 
02:52:54.469 --> 02:52:54.479 align:start position:0%
from Amazon's annual report or it's
 
02:52:56.630 --> 02:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
breaking out sales by geographic
 
02:52:58.070 --> 02:52:58.080 align:start position:0%
location and that's basically all we
 
02:52:59.809 --> 02:52:59.819 align:start position:0%
need to know right once we know Amazon
 
02:53:02.210 --> 02:53:02.220 align:start position:0%
sells in the US
 
02:53:04.130 --> 02:53:04.140 align:start position:0%
now you can just break it down in terms
 
02:53:05.630 --> 02:53:05.640 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire right so it's already
 
02:53:07.190 --> 02:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
out there
 
02:53:08.809 --> 02:53:08.819 align:start position:0%
um for as a matter of financial
 
02:53:10.670 --> 02:53:10.680 align:start position:0%
accounting and compliance with the
 
02:53:12.110 --> 02:53:12.120 align:start position:0%
Securities laws
 
02:53:14.929 --> 02:53:14.939 align:start position:0%
um for many of these countries
 
02:53:16.910 --> 02:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
um again this is just repeating what
 
02:53:18.950 --> 02:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
Professor um Palestine just talked about
 
02:53:21.710 --> 02:53:21.720 align:start position:0%
if you go to the rest of the world
 
02:53:21.720 --> 02:53:23.210 align:start position:0%
if you go to the rest of the world
um

02:53:23.210 --> 02:53:23.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:53:25.969 --> 02:53:25.979 align:start position:0%
a couple of points right the notion that
 
02:53:28.910 --> 02:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
the face erosion is a problem right it's
 
02:53:32.090 --> 02:53:32.100 align:start position:0%
not just something that um a handful of
 
02:53:34.730 --> 02:53:34.740 align:start position:0%
people have noticed and perceived um as
 
02:53:38.210 --> 02:53:38.220 align:start position:0%
a as a problem of both fairness and a
 
02:53:38.220 --> 02:53:39.469 align:start position:0%
a as a problem of both fairness and a
drab

02:53:39.469 --> 02:53:39.479 align:start position:0%
drab
 
02:53:41.450 --> 02:53:41.460 align:start position:0%
um in some ways on the whole
 
02:53:44.809 --> 02:53:44.819 align:start position:0%
International economy and tax system
 
02:53:47.510 --> 02:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
um it's a big issue with the oecd both
 
02:53:50.330 --> 02:53:50.340 align:start position:0%
pillar one and pillar two
 
02:53:53.090 --> 02:53:53.100 align:start position:0%
um have worldwide add formulary
 
02:53:56.210 --> 02:53:56.220 align:start position:0%
components that go to the next slide
 
02:53:58.309 --> 02:53:58.319 align:start position:0%
um and it makes sense right so if you're
 
02:54:00.530 --> 02:54:00.540 align:start position:0%
concerned about a big multinational
 
02:54:03.889 --> 02:54:03.899 align:start position:0%
company pay a 15 minimum tax that's
 
02:54:06.710 --> 02:54:06.720 align:start position:0%
pillar two then you need to know what's
 
02:54:09.110 --> 02:54:09.120 align:start position:0%
in the group and what's not in the group
 
02:54:11.030 --> 02:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
um so that's just worldwide combined
 
02:54:12.530 --> 02:54:12.540 align:start position:0%
reporting and if you go to the next
 
02:54:14.570 --> 02:54:14.580 align:start position:0%
slide here is
 
02:54:19.010 --> 02:54:19.020 align:start position:0%
um an excerpt I'm from the oecd
 
02:54:22.010 --> 02:54:22.020 align:start position:0%
um rules uh at least current proposed
 
02:54:24.969 --> 02:54:24.979 align:start position:0%
rules relating to pillar two again
 
02:54:30.710 --> 02:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:30.720 --> 02:54:32.230 align:start position:0%
 
um final

02:54:32.230 --> 02:54:32.240 align:start position:0%
um final
 
02:54:35.389 --> 02:54:35.399 align:start position:0%
critique that I will address before uh
 
02:54:37.849 --> 02:54:37.859 align:start position:0%
stopping for questions right again Pull
 
02:54:39.650 --> 02:54:39.660 align:start position:0%
It in the tax Foundation this is the
 
02:54:41.690 --> 02:54:41.700 align:start position:0%
slide but there's no money there the
 
02:54:45.530 --> 02:54:45.540 align:start position:0%
idea is that the itap estimate of 177
 
02:54:48.530 --> 02:54:48.540 align:start position:0%
million is totally unsound the argument
 
02:54:50.150 --> 02:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
is that it's unsound because it doesn't
 
02:54:52.250 --> 02:54:52.260 align:start position:0%
take into account that you have to
 
02:54:54.230 --> 02:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
reduce New Hampshire's apportional
 
02:54:56.330 --> 02:54:56.340 align:start position:0%
percentage as well
 
02:54:56.340 --> 02:54:57.290 align:start position:0%
percentage as well
um

02:54:57.290 --> 02:54:57.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:55:00.110 --> 02:55:00.120 align:start position:0%
and the the
 
02:55:03.590 --> 02:55:03.600 align:start position:0%
critique is itself unsound because the
 
02:55:05.990 --> 02:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
whole premise is that this is income
 
02:55:08.269 --> 02:55:08.279 align:start position:0%
that's been shifted out and so there's
 
02:55:10.370 --> 02:55:10.380 align:start position:0%
no reason to dilute the state factors
 
02:55:12.290 --> 02:55:12.300 align:start position:0%
and taking it into account how much the
 
02:55:13.849 --> 02:55:13.859 align:start position:0%
state would raise if the income were
 
02:55:16.790 --> 02:55:16.800 align:start position:0%
added back in it is true if if New
 
02:55:18.349 --> 02:55:18.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire goes to worldwide combined
 
02:55:21.230 --> 02:55:21.240 align:start position:0%
reporting that there would be undilution
 
02:55:23.630 --> 02:55:23.640 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire's um factors
 
02:55:24.830 --> 02:55:24.840 align:start position:0%
um and there would be some winners and
 
02:55:27.230 --> 02:55:27.240 align:start position:0%
losers and some corporations that have
 
02:55:28.910 --> 02:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
big losses might pay less than they
 
02:55:31.849 --> 02:55:31.859 align:start position:0%
currently pay but that's entirely um
 
02:55:31.859 --> 02:55:33.170 align:start position:0%
currently pay but that's entirely um
appropriate

02:55:33.170 --> 02:55:33.180 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
02:55:35.630 --> 02:55:35.640 align:start position:0%
um and on balance again as
 
02:55:38.030 --> 02:55:38.040 align:start position:0%
um Dan box explained because of the
 
02:55:40.370 --> 02:55:40.380 align:start position:0%
significance of income shifting it's
 
02:55:42.469 --> 02:55:42.479 align:start position:0%
very likely on New Hampshire
 
02:55:44.090 --> 02:55:44.100 align:start position:0%
um would come out ahead there was a
 
02:55:45.590 --> 02:55:45.600 align:start position:0%
question raised about the interaction
 
02:55:48.110 --> 02:55:48.120 align:start position:0%
with guilty
 
02:55:51.230 --> 02:55:51.240 align:start position:0%
um a federal provision that a limited
 
02:55:52.910 --> 02:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
slightly different way
 
02:55:56.030 --> 02:55:56.040 align:start position:0%
um brings back some uh presumed shift to
 
02:55:58.490 --> 02:55:58.500 align:start position:0%
income it is a good thing that New
 
02:56:00.650 --> 02:56:00.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire conforms to guilty
 
02:56:00.660 --> 02:56:01.490 align:start position:0%
Hampshire conforms to guilty
um

02:56:01.490 --> 02:56:01.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:56:03.889 --> 02:56:03.899 align:start position:0%
the interaction between worldwide
 
02:56:05.870 --> 02:56:05.880 align:start position:0%
combined important and guilty is is
 
02:56:09.410 --> 02:56:09.420 align:start position:0%
complicated it probably means that the
 
02:56:11.870 --> 02:56:11.880 align:start position:0%
amount that New Hampshire would
 
02:56:15.830 --> 02:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
um gain of is somewhat less than the
 
02:56:17.510 --> 02:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
current estimates whatever they might be
 
02:56:19.370 --> 02:56:19.380 align:start position:0%
because New Hampshire is getting some
 
02:56:21.590 --> 02:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
that income back in its basis in its tax
 
02:56:23.510 --> 02:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
base through guilty
 
02:56:25.610 --> 02:56:25.620 align:start position:0%
um it's very hard to say exactly how
 
02:56:27.889 --> 02:56:27.899 align:start position:0%
much I have you know some you know some
 
02:56:29.630 --> 02:56:29.640 align:start position:0%
rough intuitions about it that I'd be
 
02:56:31.730 --> 02:56:31.740 align:start position:0%
happy to talk more about or talk to the
 
02:56:33.710 --> 02:56:33.720 align:start position:0%
revenue authorities about
 
02:56:36.410 --> 02:56:36.420 align:start position:0%
um final slide upshots no state has as
 
02:56:38.450 --> 02:56:38.460 align:start position:0%
much to gain from getting their business
 
02:56:40.870 --> 02:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
taxation right as New Hampshire
 
02:56:43.610 --> 02:56:43.620 align:start position:0%
the primary Arguments for worldwide
 
02:56:45.410 --> 02:56:45.420 align:start position:0%
combiner for the other that's editions
 
02:56:48.469 --> 02:56:48.479 align:start position:0%
and fair it also turns out that it's
 
02:56:51.230 --> 02:56:51.240 align:start position:0%
likely to raise revenue but you could
 
02:56:52.969 --> 02:56:52.979 align:start position:0%
use that Revenue obviously as you want
 
02:56:54.530 --> 02:56:54.540 align:start position:0%
you could use it to reduce some less
 
02:56:57.110 --> 02:56:57.120 align:start position:0%
efficient tax you could use it to help
 
02:56:57.120 --> 02:56:58.010 align:start position:0%
efficient tax you could use it to help
address

02:56:58.010 --> 02:56:58.020 align:start position:0%
address
 
02:56:59.750 --> 02:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
um the issue with property tax
 
02:57:01.429 --> 02:57:01.439 align:start position:0%
Equalization that I know is an issue in
 
02:57:04.010 --> 02:57:04.020 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire fun sidebar
 
02:57:06.050 --> 02:57:06.060 align:start position:0%
Texas has something called the margin
 
02:57:09.349 --> 02:57:09.359 align:start position:0%
tax which is a less good mashup of your
 
02:57:11.090 --> 02:57:11.100 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise tax and your
 
02:57:12.410 --> 02:57:12.420 align:start position:0%
business profits tax that everybody
 
02:57:15.170 --> 02:57:15.180 align:start position:0%
hates why does Texas have this tax it
 
02:57:17.510 --> 02:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
has this tax to address taxi um property
 
02:57:19.550 --> 02:57:19.560 align:start position:0%
tax Equalization issues
 
02:57:22.309 --> 02:57:22.319 align:start position:0%
um so you know just an interesting of
 
02:57:24.830 --> 02:57:24.840 align:start position:0%
where these things go and then finally I
 
02:57:26.090 --> 02:57:26.100 align:start position:0%
just wanted to just make myself
 
02:57:28.550 --> 02:57:28.560 align:start position:0%
available at as things progress I'm
 
02:57:31.309 --> 02:57:31.319 align:start position:0%
happy to be a resource in the future
 
02:57:34.190 --> 02:57:34.200 align:start position:0%
about any questions and the final slide
 
02:57:37.010 --> 02:57:37.020 align:start position:0%
just has some additional sources that
 
02:57:38.690 --> 02:57:38.700 align:start position:0%
you can refer to
 
02:57:40.730 --> 02:57:40.740 align:start position:0%
um so that that's it happy to take
 
02:57:40.740 --> 02:57:41.809 align:start position:0%
um so that that's it happy to take
questions

02:57:41.809 --> 02:57:41.819 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:57:44.090 --> 02:57:44.100 align:start position:0%
excellent thank you very useful slides
 
02:57:45.650 --> 02:57:45.660 align:start position:0%
the version we have are kind of
 
02:57:48.349 --> 02:57:48.359 align:start position:0%
microscopic but Jen we'll get these uh
 
02:57:50.510 --> 02:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
as a computer link so we'll have the
 
02:57:52.309 --> 02:57:52.319 align:start position:0%
luxury of looking them at them in a
 
02:57:54.910 --> 02:57:54.920 align:start position:0%
large format at home
 
02:57:57.170 --> 02:57:57.180 align:start position:0%
they were readable but there were some I
 
02:57:59.389 --> 02:57:59.399 align:start position:0%
had to really squint at
 
02:58:01.190 --> 02:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
okay questions
 
02:58:04.790 --> 02:58:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:06.889 --> 02:58:06.899 align:start position:0%
I'll just ask one so if I if I
 
02:58:08.630 --> 02:58:08.640 align:start position:0%
understand you're saying in effect the
 
02:58:10.730 --> 02:58:10.740 align:start position:0%
guilty is
 
02:58:12.410 --> 02:58:12.420 align:start position:0%
effectively like a partial
 
02:58:15.650 --> 02:58:15.660 align:start position:0%
implementation already in place and
 
02:58:18.110 --> 02:58:18.120 align:start position:0%
therefore mitigates the potential to
 
02:58:20.870 --> 02:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
gain but maybe also illustrates where
 
02:58:23.150 --> 02:58:23.160 align:start position:0%
the potential is
 
02:58:25.370 --> 02:58:25.380 align:start position:0%
yes that's right I mean it illustrates
 
02:58:27.230 --> 02:58:27.240 align:start position:0%
that it's a
 
02:58:29.210 --> 02:58:29.220 align:start position:0%
big problem that the International
 
02:58:31.790 --> 02:58:31.800 align:start position:0%
Community and the federal government is
 
02:58:33.710 --> 02:58:33.720 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
02:58:35.929 --> 02:58:35.939 align:start position:0%
um it also illustrates that these big
 
02:58:38.510 --> 02:58:38.520 align:start position:0%
taxpayers are already calculating
 
02:58:39.889 --> 02:58:39.899 align:start position:0%
um the foreign income of their
 
02:58:42.349 --> 02:58:42.359 align:start position:0%
subsidiaries for purposes of guilty not
 
02:58:44.630 --> 02:58:44.640 align:start position:0%
exactly the same calculation clearly
 
02:58:46.730 --> 02:58:46.740 align:start position:0%
they're already played in the sandbox um
 
02:58:49.490 --> 02:58:49.500 align:start position:0%
and so it's not a big deal I don't think
 
02:58:52.490 --> 02:58:52.500 align:start position:0%
I'm reasonably to say uh it'll be it
 
02:58:52.500 --> 02:58:53.690 align:start position:0%
I'm reasonably to say uh it'll be it
would

02:58:53.690 --> 02:58:53.700 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:58:56.210 --> 02:58:56.220 align:start position:0%
um be overly burdensome and yes in terms
 
02:58:57.830 --> 02:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
of Revenue estimated something to to
 
02:58:59.950 --> 02:58:59.960 align:start position:0%
keep in mind I mean I
 
02:59:02.570 --> 02:59:02.580 align:start position:0%
suspect you're you are making a
 
02:59:05.510 --> 02:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable you are drawing a non-trivial
 
02:59:07.490 --> 02:59:07.500 align:start position:0%
amount of of this income back through
 
02:59:10.610 --> 02:59:10.620 align:start position:0%
guilty but not at as much as you would
 
02:59:12.530 --> 02:59:12.540 align:start position:0%
do the worldwide combine the point I
 
02:59:15.530 --> 02:59:15.540 align:start position:0%
understood um one further question in a
 
02:59:18.469 --> 02:59:18.479 align:start position:0%
prior slide you referred to one of the
 
02:59:20.990 --> 02:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
elements of the Supreme Court's Barclay
 
02:59:21.000 --> 02:59:22.070 align:start position:0%
elements of the Supreme Court's Barclay
decision

02:59:22.070 --> 02:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
decision
 
02:59:25.210 --> 02:59:25.220 align:start position:0%
yeah was that they if I understood this
 
02:59:28.550 --> 02:59:28.560 align:start position:0%
they took note of the California
 
02:59:31.849 --> 02:59:31.859 align:start position:0%
regulations use of the term reasonable
 
02:59:35.269 --> 02:59:35.279 align:start position:0%
approximations and they blessed that
 
02:59:37.790 --> 02:59:37.800 align:start position:0%
so effectively aren't you essentially
 
02:59:40.550 --> 02:59:40.560 align:start position:0%
endorsing the idea that any action by
 
02:59:42.230 --> 02:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire and its
 
02:59:44.090 --> 02:59:44.100 align:start position:0%
subsequent regulations
 
02:59:45.769 --> 02:59:45.779 align:start position:0%
would allow for reasonable
 
02:59:48.530 --> 02:59:48.540 align:start position:0%
approximations that it's
 
02:59:48.540 --> 02:59:50.750 align:start position:0%
approximations that it's
a

02:59:50.750 --> 02:59:50.760 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:59:53.330 --> 02:59:53.340 align:start position:0%
a policy choice
 
02:59:56.150 --> 02:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
that would make the statute more
 
02:59:56.160 --> 02:59:58.490 align:start position:0%
that would make the statute more
workable

02:59:58.490 --> 02:59:58.500 align:start position:0%
workable
 
03:00:00.349 --> 03:00:00.359 align:start position:0%
yes yeah I mean it certainly it's about
 
03:00:02.090 --> 03:00:02.100 align:start position:0%
a federal constitutional law New
 
03:00:03.950 --> 03:00:03.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has a huge amount of latitude
 
03:00:06.410 --> 03:00:06.420 align:start position:0%
I think it could probably have something
 
03:00:09.410 --> 03:00:09.420 align:start position:0%
stricter than California had but
 
03:00:09.420 --> 03:00:10.750 align:start position:0%
stricter than California had but
California

03:00:10.750 --> 03:00:10.760 align:start position:0%
California
 
03:00:14.030 --> 03:00:14.040 align:start position:0%
had reasonable approximation
 
03:00:16.610 --> 03:00:16.620 align:start position:0%
it was an issue in the case because the
 
03:00:19.690 --> 03:00:19.700 align:start position:0%
taxpayers insisted that um the the
 
03:00:21.710 --> 03:00:21.720 align:start position:0%
worldwide combined reporting was two
 
03:00:23.389 --> 03:00:23.399 align:start position:0%
burdensome so there was actually
 
03:00:26.269 --> 03:00:26.279 align:start position:0%
evidence taken about this and this is a
 
03:00:29.510 --> 03:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
time right where California was also
 
03:00:31.690 --> 03:00:31.700 align:start position:0%
asking for foreign property and payroll
 
03:00:34.370 --> 03:00:34.380 align:start position:0%
uh this is and this was obviously a time
 
03:00:36.170 --> 03:00:36.180 align:start position:0%
when you know Computing was not what it
 
03:00:39.469 --> 03:00:39.479 align:start position:0%
is today and still the Court's balance
 
03:00:42.110 --> 03:00:42.120 align:start position:0%
upon actually looking at evidence that
 
03:00:43.849 --> 03:00:43.859 align:start position:0%
for a big corporation like Barclays it
 
03:00:45.469 --> 03:00:45.479 align:start position:0%
wasn't such a big deal
 
03:00:46.610 --> 03:00:46.620 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:00:48.469 --> 03:00:48.479 align:start position:0%
I'm not telling New Hampshire exactly
 
03:00:50.030 --> 03:00:50.040 align:start position:0%
how to approach
 
03:00:52.070 --> 03:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
um you know I'm combining um with these
 
03:00:54.469 --> 03:00:54.479 align:start position:0%
foreign corporations I think
 
03:00:56.929 --> 03:00:56.939 align:start position:0%
um adopting the California approach as
 
03:00:59.090 --> 03:00:59.100 align:start position:0%
both blessed by the Supreme Court and as
 
03:01:01.670 --> 03:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
a methodology that clearly works and
 
03:01:03.590 --> 03:01:03.600 align:start position:0%
that these big businesses are familiar
 
03:01:05.690 --> 03:01:05.700 align:start position:0%
with how to use in California and will
 
03:01:08.269 --> 03:01:08.279 align:start position:0%
use when it's to their benefit
 
03:01:12.230 --> 03:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:14.630 --> 03:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
representative Schaumburg thank you Mr
 
03:01:14.640 --> 03:01:16.130 align:start position:0%
representative Schaumburg thank you Mr
chairman

03:01:16.130 --> 03:01:16.140 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
03:01:16.140 --> 03:01:17.210 align:start position:0%
chairman
um

03:01:17.210 --> 03:01:17.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:01:25.010 --> 03:01:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:28.070 --> 03:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
what you're saying is that
 
03:01:30.650 --> 03:01:30.660 align:start position:0%
is it all public or is it all private
 
03:01:34.610 --> 03:01:34.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:34.620 --> 03:01:38.269 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:01:38.269 --> 03:01:38.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:41.330 --> 03:01:41.340 align:start position:0%
a professor of accounting um so my
 
03:01:43.790 --> 03:01:43.800 align:start position:0%
understanding is that
 
03:01:43.800 --> 03:01:44.690 align:start position:0%
understanding is that
um

03:01:44.690 --> 03:01:44.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:01:47.690 --> 03:01:47.700 align:start position:0%
this would be for public corporations I
 
03:01:50.750 --> 03:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
don't that certainly uh to be governed
 
03:01:54.230 --> 03:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
by fast beyond the SEC I'm
 
03:01:56.269 --> 03:01:56.279 align:start position:0%
don't want to speculate exactly on how
 
03:01:58.550 --> 03:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
we work for a private entity although
 
03:02:00.889 --> 03:02:00.899 align:start position:0%
again it'll be pretty stunning right if
 
03:02:02.929 --> 03:02:02.939 align:start position:0%
big investors and private entities were
 
03:02:05.210 --> 03:02:05.220 align:start position:0%
willing to like not get something right
 
03:02:07.910 --> 03:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
analogous but I don't want to speculate
 
03:02:10.910 --> 03:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
about that I should have asked my
 
03:02:13.550 --> 03:02:13.560 align:start position:0%
Two Gentlemen to the left of me
 
03:02:15.950 --> 03:02:15.960 align:start position:0%
for that question but I was hoping to
 
03:02:18.530 --> 03:02:18.540 align:start position:0%
get yeah I could do that next Monday
 
03:02:21.469 --> 03:02:21.479 align:start position:0%
well this is this is just corporate
 
03:02:23.690 --> 03:02:23.700 align:start position:0%
Alternative Minimum Tax is a barometer
 
03:02:23.700 --> 03:02:25.070 align:start position:0%
Alternative Minimum Tax is a barometer
and

03:02:25.070 --> 03:02:25.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:02:27.769 --> 03:02:27.779 align:start position:0%
um happily I've forgotten the thresholds
 
03:02:30.290 --> 03:02:30.300 align:start position:0%
for it because my clients are not in
 
03:02:32.269 --> 03:02:32.279 align:start position:0%
that base but it's only like a couple
 
03:02:34.550 --> 03:02:34.560 align:start position:0%
hundred companies that are going to be
 
03:02:37.429 --> 03:02:37.439 align:start position:0%
subject to this as it's been rolled out
 
03:02:39.349 --> 03:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
um someone else in the crowd may may
 
03:02:39.359 --> 03:02:40.309 align:start position:0%
um someone else in the crowd may may
know

03:02:40.309 --> 03:02:40.319 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:02:42.410 --> 03:02:42.420 align:start position:0%
better on the threshold but it's only
 
03:02:44.809 --> 03:02:44.819 align:start position:0%
going to apply to a very small subset of
 
03:02:47.690 --> 03:02:47.700 align:start position:0%
businesses based on billions of book
 
03:02:51.230 --> 03:02:51.240 align:start position:0%
income based on kind of governed you
 
03:02:53.330 --> 03:02:53.340 align:start position:0%
know public accounting standards what
 
03:02:58.250 --> 03:02:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:59.510 --> 03:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
yeah that
 
03:03:01.010 --> 03:03:01.020 align:start position:0%
that's true I can't
 
03:03:02.570 --> 03:03:02.580 align:start position:0%
see the exact universe but it's a
 
03:03:06.110 --> 03:03:06.120 align:start position:0%
relatively small number of companies but
 
03:03:08.630 --> 03:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
the overlap between those companies and
 
03:03:10.429 --> 03:03:10.439 align:start position:0%
the super normal profits and income
 
03:03:13.190 --> 03:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
shifting is very very high so someone
 
03:03:15.650 --> 03:03:15.660 align:start position:0%
would have to do the estimates
 
03:03:18.590 --> 03:03:18.600 align:start position:0%
um and on that this again I don't think
 
03:03:21.650 --> 03:03:21.660 align:start position:0%
it's burdens it just means I'm not
 
03:03:24.050 --> 03:03:24.060 align:start position:0%
necessarily saying that this is
 
03:03:25.490 --> 03:03:25.500 align:start position:0%
something a compliance person that
 
03:03:27.769 --> 03:03:27.779 align:start position:0%
smaller companies couldn't handle just
 
03:03:31.130 --> 03:03:31.140 align:start position:0%
fine but if the concern is that you have
 
03:03:33.110 --> 03:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
to start somewhere
 
03:03:36.309 --> 03:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
um and which companies right can most
 
03:03:38.690 --> 03:03:38.700 align:start position:0%
clearly handle it because they're doing
 
03:03:41.389 --> 03:03:41.399 align:start position:0%
something similar and which companies
 
03:03:43.610 --> 03:03:43.620 align:start position:0%
are have the biggest potential to ship
 
03:03:51.530 --> 03:03:51.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:55.190 --> 03:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
okay all right thank you very very much
 
03:03:57.650 --> 03:03:57.660 align:start position:0%
I appreciate your patience and waiting
 
03:04:00.070 --> 03:04:00.080 align:start position:0%
uh waiting your turn
 
03:04:04.309 --> 03:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
uh so the the commission will take a
 
03:04:10.790 --> 03:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:14.750 --> 03:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
yes I I I'm I'm going to basically uh
 
03:04:16.910 --> 03:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
postpone lunch
 
03:04:20.870 --> 03:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
um and so we'll proceed Carl uh freedom
 
03:04:22.730 --> 03:04:22.740 align:start position:0%
I believe is here in the room
 
03:04:24.590 --> 03:04:24.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for your patience if we're a
 
03:04:26.809 --> 03:04:26.819 align:start position:0%
couple of minutes past 12 45 I think
 
03:04:29.510 --> 03:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
we're good okay so we're in recess
 
03:04:29.520 --> 03:04:52.190 align:start position:0%
we're good okay so we're in recess
briefly

03:04:52.190 --> 03:04:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:52.200 --> 03:04:53.769 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:04:53.769 --> 03:04:53.779 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:05:18.670 --> 03:05:18.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:05.349 --> 03:21:05.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:08.570 --> 03:21:08.580 align:start position:0%
I'm going to call the commission's
 
03:21:13.070 --> 03:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
meeting back into session it's uh 12 51.
 
03:21:15.290 --> 03:21:15.300 align:start position:0%
and I hope everybody got at least an
 
03:21:17.090 --> 03:21:17.100 align:start position:0%
energy bar or something along those
 
03:21:17.100 --> 03:21:19.490 align:start position:0%
energy bar or something along those
lines

03:21:19.490 --> 03:21:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:19.500 --> 03:21:22.490 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:21:22.490 --> 03:21:22.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:24.530 --> 03:21:24.540 align:start position:0%
multiple forms of energy including
 
03:21:24.540 --> 03:21:25.969 align:start position:0%
multiple forms of energy including
chocolate

03:21:25.969 --> 03:21:25.979 align:start position:0%
chocolate
 
03:21:28.190 --> 03:21:28.200 align:start position:0%

like that you want to actually hear me
 
03:21:54.110 --> 03:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:56.290 --> 03:21:56.300 align:start position:0%
to start again chairman Spielberg

engaged in interstate and international
 
03:22:18.769 --> 03:22:18.779 align:start position:0%
business you can pretty much think of
 
03:22:21.110 --> 03:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
you know 500 of the largest thousand
 
03:22:23.469 --> 03:22:23.479 align:start position:0%
companies in the world
 
03:22:26.510 --> 03:22:26.520 align:start position:0%

preserve and promote what we consider to
 
03:22:34.190 --> 03:22:34.200 align:start position:0%
be Equitable balanced and
 
03:22:35.990 --> 03:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
non-discriminatory state and local
 
03:22:38.469 --> 03:22:38.479 align:start position:0%
taxation a multi-jurisdictional
 
03:22:41.210 --> 03:22:41.220 align:start position:0%
businesses we generally and this is an
 
03:22:42.650 --> 03:22:42.660 align:start position:0%
important point we generally don't weigh
 
03:22:44.990 --> 03:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
in on things like tax rates or how much
 
03:22:47.150 --> 03:22:47.160 align:start position:0%
how much you want to raise in taxes
 
03:22:48.830 --> 03:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
those are you know your Sovereign
 
03:22:51.230 --> 03:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
decisions but we do weigh in on issues
 
03:22:53.150 --> 03:22:53.160 align:start position:0%
like worldwide combined reporting that
 
03:22:56.710 --> 03:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
we think are bad tax policy a bad design
 
03:23:00.650 --> 03:23:00.660 align:start position:0%
as I'll explain both unfair overly
 
03:23:02.469 --> 03:23:02.479 align:start position:0%
complex and and potentially
 
03:23:04.330 --> 03:23:04.340 align:start position:0%
discriminatory against
 
03:23:05.690 --> 03:23:05.700 align:start position:0%
multi-jurisdictional businesses
 
03:23:08.269 --> 03:23:08.279 align:start position:0%
depending on the way they're done I've
 
03:23:10.490 --> 03:23:10.500 align:start position:0%
got five slides there that I think will
 
03:23:13.370 --> 03:23:13.380 align:start position:0%
kind of give our perspective the
 
03:23:15.650 --> 03:23:15.660 align:start position:0%
business perspective you might say on
 
03:23:17.269 --> 03:23:17.279 align:start position:0%
why New Hampshire and I'm going to
 
03:23:18.769 --> 03:23:18.779 align:start position:0%
really focus on New Hampshire there's a
 
03:23:19.969 --> 03:23:19.979 align:start position:0%
much broader debate around the world
 
03:23:22.090 --> 03:23:22.100 align:start position:0%
than what the world should do with
 
03:23:24.110 --> 03:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
multinationals now they should tax them
 
03:23:27.290 --> 03:23:27.300 align:start position:0%
but why New Hampshire should not adopt
 
03:23:29.269 --> 03:23:29.279 align:start position:0%
mandatory worldwide combined reporting I
 
03:23:31.969 --> 03:23:31.979 align:start position:0%
think is the issue in this hearing not
 
03:23:34.010 --> 03:23:34.020 align:start position:0%
what other states should do or not and
 
03:23:35.570 --> 03:23:35.580 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to really Zone in on that a
 
03:23:37.490 --> 03:23:37.500 align:start position:0%
few of the speakers Did drill down on a
 
03:23:39.769 --> 03:23:39.779 align:start position:0%
couple elements of New Hampshire but I'm
 
03:23:42.110 --> 03:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
going to go much further to show you
 
03:23:43.929 --> 03:23:43.939 align:start position:0%
know why your current
 
03:23:46.309 --> 03:23:46.319 align:start position:0%
tax structure is one that doesn't
 
03:23:49.010 --> 03:23:49.020 align:start position:0%
require worldwide combined reporting but
 
03:23:50.990 --> 03:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
as an overview before I get into those
 
03:23:53.990 --> 03:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
five slides just as I listen today what
 
03:23:56.269 --> 03:23:56.279 align:start position:0%
I heard was sort of the following from
 
03:23:58.969 --> 03:23:58.979 align:start position:0%
the three proponents of worldwide
 
03:24:01.309 --> 03:24:01.319 align:start position:0%
combined reporting one worldwide
 
03:24:03.769 --> 03:24:03.779 align:start position:0%
combined reporting is constitutional
 
03:24:06.110 --> 03:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
two there's widespread International
 
03:24:08.330 --> 03:24:08.340 align:start position:0%
profit shifting by multinational
 
03:24:11.389 --> 03:24:11.399 align:start position:0%
companies that deprives New Hampshire of
 
03:24:13.490 --> 03:24:13.500 align:start position:0%
its appropriate share of corporate tax
 
03:24:16.250 --> 03:24:16.260 align:start position:0%
revenues three worldwide combined
 
03:24:16.260 --> 03:24:17.389 align:start position:0%
revenues three worldwide combined
reporting

03:24:17.389 --> 03:24:17.399 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
03:24:21.170 --> 03:24:21.180 align:start position:0%
is the best perhaps the only method for
 
03:24:23.090 --> 03:24:23.100 align:start position:0%
addressing this and getting the
 
03:24:25.370 --> 03:24:25.380 align:start position:0%
appropriate foreign Source income into
 
03:24:27.710 --> 03:24:27.720 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire business profits tax
 
03:24:27.720 --> 03:24:28.790 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire business profits tax
base

03:24:28.790 --> 03:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
base
 
03:24:31.370 --> 03:24:31.380 align:start position:0%
or worldwide combined reporting is
 
03:24:34.130 --> 03:24:34.140 align:start position:0%
manageable I think uh Dan Buck said it's
 
03:24:37.070 --> 03:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
only 900 or a thousand dollars a year to
 
03:24:38.809 --> 03:24:38.819 align:start position:0%
file for it according to the Barclays
 
03:24:41.570 --> 03:24:41.580 align:start position:0%
case in five and I think this is a
 
03:24:43.610 --> 03:24:43.620 align:start position:0%
really important underlying issue here
 
03:24:45.889 --> 03:24:45.899 align:start position:0%
which is that implicitly this is from
 
03:24:48.530 --> 03:24:48.540 align:start position:0%
the proponent's perspective
 
03:24:50.570 --> 03:24:50.580 align:start position:0%
corporations aren't paying their fair
 
03:24:53.389 --> 03:24:53.399 align:start position:0%
share of taxes in New Hampshire and this
 
03:24:55.729 --> 03:24:55.739 align:start position:0%
would be one way to address that as well
 
03:24:58.190 --> 03:24:58.200 align:start position:0%
so let me before I go into my slides
 
03:25:00.769 --> 03:25:00.779 align:start position:0%
which will I will do sort of quickly but
 
03:25:02.630 --> 03:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
then and these are leave behinds and and
 
03:25:04.370 --> 03:25:04.380 align:start position:0%
drill down on some of the points I'm
 
03:25:06.590 --> 03:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
going to make let me respond
 
03:25:09.349 --> 03:25:09.359 align:start position:0%
somewhat succinctly to those five points
 
03:25:11.450 --> 03:25:11.460 align:start position:0%
and then I'll drill down on with a with
 
03:25:13.550 --> 03:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
with some details there first of all
 
03:25:15.530 --> 03:25:15.540 align:start position:0%
yeah of course worldwide combined
 
03:25:17.090 --> 03:25:17.100 align:start position:0%
reporting as long as it's appropriately
 
03:25:17.100 --> 03:25:18.950 align:start position:0%
reporting as long as it's appropriately
structured

03:25:18.950 --> 03:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
structured
 
03:25:21.290 --> 03:25:21.300 align:start position:0%
um is constitutional Supreme Court said
 
03:25:24.229 --> 03:25:24.239 align:start position:0%
it twice we have no disagreement there
 
03:25:26.929 --> 03:25:26.939 align:start position:0%
we do have a disagreement as to just
 
03:25:28.750 --> 03:25:28.760 align:start position:0%
because something's constitutional
 
03:25:32.570 --> 03:25:32.580 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean it's the right tax policy
 
03:25:35.330 --> 03:25:35.340 align:start position:0%
and and I think Dan bucks went quite a
 
03:25:37.130 --> 03:25:37.140 align:start position:0%
little bit well quite a little overboard
 
03:25:39.410 --> 03:25:39.420 align:start position:0%
and suggesting almost an endorsement by
 
03:25:40.910 --> 03:25:40.920 align:start position:0%
the U.S Supreme Court of worldwide
 
03:25:42.590 --> 03:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
combined reporting what they said in
 
03:25:44.870 --> 03:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
container in Barclays was it was
 
03:25:46.790 --> 03:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
constitutional it was a method the
 
03:25:49.849 --> 03:25:49.859 align:start position:0%
states could use as long as others they
 
03:25:51.769 --> 03:25:51.779 align:start position:0%
they never endorse it it was the method
 
03:25:53.630 --> 03:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
or the the fairest method they never
 
03:25:55.809 --> 03:25:55.819 align:start position:0%
said anything
 
03:25:58.010 --> 03:25:58.020 align:start position:0%
like that but there's lots of things
 
03:25:59.510 --> 03:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
that are constitutional that you
 
03:26:00.830 --> 03:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't necessarily want to do you
 
03:26:03.229 --> 03:26:03.239 align:start position:0%
could double your business profits tax
 
03:26:05.450 --> 03:26:05.460 align:start position:0%
rate right now that's constitutional but
 
03:26:07.309 --> 03:26:07.319 align:start position:0%
I'm certainly not suggesting you do that
 
03:26:09.290 --> 03:26:09.300 align:start position:0%
so that's the first point we agree on
 
03:26:11.990 --> 03:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
the first point the second point is a
 
03:26:13.610 --> 03:26:13.620 align:start position:0%
very important one that there's
 
03:26:15.469 --> 03:26:15.479 align:start position:0%
extensive profit shifting that's
 
03:26:17.690 --> 03:26:17.700 align:start position:0%
depriving New Hampshire of its revenues
 
03:26:19.370 --> 03:26:19.380 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to kind of combine the
 
03:26:20.809 --> 03:26:20.819 align:start position:0%
second point and the third one I'm going
 
03:26:22.790 --> 03:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
to make and they're certainly there
 
03:26:24.590 --> 03:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
could be no question that you know I
 
03:26:27.590 --> 03:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
mean I think the oecd the federal
 
03:26:29.630 --> 03:26:29.640 align:start position:0%
government with guilty there's a lot of
 
03:26:32.210 --> 03:26:32.220 align:start position:0%
Nations around the world not just states
 
03:26:34.070 --> 03:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
that are focused on how to appropriately
 
03:26:36.469 --> 03:26:36.479 align:start position:0%
tax global companies that have
 
03:26:38.510 --> 03:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
operations and all over and it's gotten
 
03:26:41.150 --> 03:26:41.160 align:start position:0%
much more complicated with intangibles
 
03:26:43.429 --> 03:26:43.439 align:start position:0%
which are easier to move perhaps than
 
03:26:45.410 --> 03:26:45.420 align:start position:0%
people so there's no question that there
 
03:26:47.150 --> 03:26:47.160 align:start position:0%
is some level of profit shifting and
 
03:26:49.550 --> 03:26:49.560 align:start position:0%
it's being dealt with it at a global
 
03:26:51.290 --> 03:26:51.300 align:start position:0%
basis there's
 
03:26:53.929 --> 03:26:53.939 align:start position:0%
a huge dispute as to how much and some
 
03:26:56.570 --> 03:26:56.580 align:start position:0%
of these numbers cited like the 177
 
03:26:58.250 --> 03:26:58.260 align:start position:0%
million that New Hampshire would somehow
 
03:27:00.530 --> 03:27:00.540 align:start position:0%
magically get if it could address as
 
03:27:03.070 --> 03:27:03.080 align:start position:0%
profit shifting or you know in my mind
 
03:27:06.130 --> 03:27:06.140 align:start position:0%
uh you know incredibly almost
 
03:27:08.990 --> 03:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
Preposterous numbers and I you know I
 
03:27:10.250 --> 03:27:10.260 align:start position:0%
could certainly provide you but there
 
03:27:11.809 --> 03:27:11.819 align:start position:0%
have been a number of critiques of some
 
03:27:13.790 --> 03:27:13.800 align:start position:0%
of the underlying data suggesting that
 
03:27:15.469 --> 03:27:15.479 align:start position:0%
some of the data that those numbers are
 
03:27:17.870 --> 03:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
based off for instance are you know
 
03:27:20.990 --> 03:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
exaggerated by two-thirds or more but
 
03:27:22.910 --> 03:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
there is a debate as one of the earlier
 
03:27:25.250 --> 03:27:25.260 align:start position:0%
speakers said it's it's not exact but
 
03:27:27.229 --> 03:27:27.239 align:start position:0%
there clearly is profit Shifting the
 
03:27:29.510 --> 03:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
problem I have with the itep numbers and
 
03:27:31.190 --> 03:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
they were cited in different forms here
 
03:27:33.650 --> 03:27:33.660 align:start position:0%
I have a much bigger problem than sort
 
03:27:35.349 --> 03:27:35.359 align:start position:0%
of the underlying
 
03:27:37.849 --> 03:27:37.859 align:start position:0%
estimates as to how much profit shifting
 
03:27:39.889 --> 03:27:39.899 align:start position:0%
there is four percent or ten percent or
 
03:27:41.870 --> 03:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
thirty percent or whatever the bigger
 
03:27:44.929 --> 03:27:44.939 align:start position:0%
problem is I tip in all of its numbers
 
03:27:47.690 --> 03:27:47.700 align:start position:0%
doesn't take into account what a state
 
03:27:49.670 --> 03:27:49.680 align:start position:0%
is currently doing in terms of taxing
 
03:27:51.229 --> 03:27:51.239 align:start position:0%
foreign Source income so the assumption
 
03:27:54.530 --> 03:27:54.540 align:start position:0%
and the itep numbers is that they're not
 
03:27:56.090 --> 03:27:56.100 align:start position:0%
taxing foreign Source income and all of
 
03:27:58.910 --> 03:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
this would come in and that's a
 
03:28:01.550 --> 03:28:01.560 align:start position:0%
particularly misleading Notions
 
03:28:03.650 --> 03:28:03.660 align:start position:0%
especially given New Hampshire and when
 
03:28:05.389 --> 03:28:05.399 align:start position:0%
I get to it in a minute in the slides
 
03:28:08.030 --> 03:28:08.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire currently is taxing most
 
03:28:10.250 --> 03:28:10.260 align:start position:0%
or All Foreign Source income New
 
03:28:12.710 --> 03:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is taxing more foreign Source
 
03:28:14.510 --> 03:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
income right now than any other state
 
03:28:17.269 --> 03:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
other than Vermont and I'll go into this
 
03:28:19.010 --> 03:28:19.020 align:start position:0%
in a little more detail it's taxing more
 
03:28:20.389 --> 03:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
foreign Source income than the federal
 
03:28:22.490 --> 03:28:22.500 align:start position:0%
government and even though it's a little
 
03:28:25.429 --> 03:28:25.439 align:start position:0%
bit of an Apple's an oranges comparison
 
03:28:27.950 --> 03:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
arguably it's taxing more foreign Source
 
03:28:29.750 --> 03:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
income than any government in the world
 
03:28:31.550 --> 03:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
right now is taxing of its
 
03:28:34.130 --> 03:28:34.140 align:start position:0%
multinationals so somehow this notion
 
03:28:36.290 --> 03:28:36.300 align:start position:0%
that you get 177 million dollars because
 
03:28:38.469 --> 03:28:38.479 align:start position:0%
you're not taxing foreign Source income
 
03:28:41.570 --> 03:28:41.580 align:start position:0%
ignores a very silly in fact which is
 
03:28:45.290 --> 03:28:45.300 align:start position:0%
you actually have most if not all and
 
03:28:46.849 --> 03:28:46.859 align:start position:0%
it's you know it depends on the company
 
03:28:49.070 --> 03:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
but most if not all on either a current
 
03:28:52.130 --> 03:28:52.140 align:start position:0%
or deferred basis of the foreign income
 
03:28:55.309 --> 03:28:55.319 align:start position:0%
in your tax base so you you don't need
 
03:28:58.010 --> 03:28:58.020 align:start position:0%
to do this at all if that's your concern
 
03:29:01.309 --> 03:29:01.319 align:start position:0%
if there's some huge tax cap I'll also
 
03:29:04.429 --> 03:29:04.439 align:start position:0%
comment you know briefly on the the
 
03:29:06.530 --> 03:29:06.540 align:start position:0%
complexity of it and you know there's no
 
03:29:08.929 --> 03:29:08.939 align:start position:0%
question that companies can
 
03:29:11.150 --> 03:29:11.160 align:start position:0%
do worldwide some of them is one of the
 
03:29:12.710 --> 03:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
speakers mentioned are doing it on an
 
03:29:14.690 --> 03:29:14.700 align:start position:0%
elective basis it was done in the past
 
03:29:17.210 --> 03:29:17.220 align:start position:0%
you know for 20 or 30 or 40 years it's
 
03:29:18.710 --> 03:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
not that they can't do it but it is
 
03:29:21.229 --> 03:29:21.239 align:start position:0%
quite a bit more complicated and I'll
 
03:29:23.030 --> 03:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
I'll provide a little bit overview of
 
03:29:25.250 --> 03:29:25.260 align:start position:0%
that and then the final point I'm going
 
03:29:26.389 --> 03:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
to make which is I think a really
 
03:29:28.030 --> 03:29:28.040 align:start position:0%
important one for New Hampshire is
 
03:29:30.889 --> 03:29:30.899 align:start position:0%
ultimately behind all of this is that
 
03:29:32.650 --> 03:29:32.660 align:start position:0%
business is not paying their fair share
 
03:29:35.809 --> 03:29:35.819 align:start position:0%
and it's really interesting and um I
 
03:29:37.729 --> 03:29:37.739 align:start position:0%
didn't submit it yet but I will send in
 
03:29:40.490 --> 03:29:40.500 align:start position:0%
there's a study that Ernst young does
 
03:29:43.429 --> 03:29:43.439 align:start position:0%
for cost every year which is called
 
03:29:46.370 --> 03:29:46.380 align:start position:0%
total state and local business taxes it
 
03:29:48.950 --> 03:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
has estimates for each state on how you
 
03:29:51.530 --> 03:29:51.540 align:start position:0%
compare to the other states and just
 
03:29:53.750 --> 03:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
some quick ones here which I think show
 
03:29:55.610 --> 03:29:55.620 align:start position:0%
that business is paying more than their
 
03:29:58.370 --> 03:29:58.380 align:start position:0%
fair share of taxes compared to other
 
03:30:01.190 --> 03:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
states and this is because of your
 
03:30:02.990 --> 03:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
unique stack structure I mean you don't
 
03:30:04.190 --> 03:30:04.200 align:start position:0%
have a sales tax you don't have a
 
03:30:05.389 --> 03:30:05.399 align:start position:0%
personal income tax so it's not
 
03:30:06.830 --> 03:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
surprising you're collecting more from
 
03:30:08.269 --> 03:30:08.279 align:start position:0%
business but if you just want to look at
 
03:30:09.969 --> 03:30:09.979 align:start position:0%
the overall staff that's
 
03:30:12.889 --> 03:30:12.899 align:start position:0%
on a national average business pays
 
03:30:12.899 --> 03:30:13.690 align:start position:0%
on a national average business pays
about

03:30:13.690 --> 03:30:13.700 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:30:17.030 --> 03:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
43.7 percent of all state local taxes in
 
03:30:20.030 --> 03:30:20.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire it's 47.9 percent and I
 
03:30:21.889 --> 03:30:21.899 align:start position:0%
you know I'll send this report to you
 
03:30:23.570 --> 03:30:23.580 align:start position:0%
but much more importantly for your
 
03:30:25.190 --> 03:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
purposes because you're concerned with
 
03:30:26.630 --> 03:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
state taxes
 
03:30:28.670 --> 03:30:28.680 align:start position:0%
at the state level the difference is
 
03:30:30.889 --> 03:30:30.899 align:start position:0%
even greater New Hampshire is the third
 
03:30:33.590 --> 03:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
highest proportion of all their state
 
03:30:36.469 --> 03:30:36.479 align:start position:0%
taxes it comes from business 62.7
 
03:30:38.570 --> 03:30:38.580 align:start position:0%
percent compared to a national average
 
03:30:41.750 --> 03:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
of 37.8 percent the only two states
 
03:30:43.969 --> 03:30:43.979 align:start position:0%
higher than you are Alaska and Wyoming
 
03:30:46.610 --> 03:30:46.620 align:start position:0%
which are heavily dependent upon oil
 
03:30:49.309 --> 03:30:49.319 align:start position:0%
revenues not surprisingly and and it's
 
03:30:51.349 --> 03:30:51.359 align:start position:0%
again because of the importance of the
 
03:30:52.849 --> 03:30:52.859 align:start position:0%
business profit tax and the business
 
03:30:55.309 --> 03:30:55.319 align:start position:0%
Enterprise the the taxis shouldn't be
 
03:30:57.769 --> 03:30:57.779 align:start position:0%
surprising but they're still relevant
 
03:30:59.150 --> 03:30:59.160 align:start position:0%
and that's collecting from both small
 
03:31:01.190 --> 03:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
and big business but business pays a
 
03:31:03.830 --> 03:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
very large share of the tax base already
 
03:31:06.830 --> 03:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire much larger certainly
 
03:31:10.309 --> 03:31:10.319 align:start position:0%
at the state level than almost any other
 
03:31:12.889 --> 03:31:12.899 align:start position:0%
state and if you break it down by you
 
03:31:14.389 --> 03:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
know your number one in terms of a
 
03:31:16.490 --> 03:31:16.500 align:start position:0%
corporate excise tax as a percentage of
 
03:31:18.710 --> 03:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
overall taxes you know your business
 
03:31:21.349 --> 03:31:21.359 align:start position:0%
profit Stacks or as a percentage of just
 
03:31:23.269 --> 03:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
taxes a business pays you're number one
 
03:31:25.309 --> 03:31:25.319 align:start position:0%
in the country on both of them so this
 
03:31:28.010 --> 03:31:28.020 align:start position:0%
is not a tax my point being that
 
03:31:30.050 --> 03:31:30.060 align:start position:0%
compared to other states you're under
 
03:31:32.870 --> 03:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
utilizing your if anything over
 
03:31:35.809 --> 03:31:35.819 align:start position:0%
utilizing it so let me just get into the
 
03:31:37.610 --> 03:31:37.620 align:start position:0%
charts here because I want to drill down
 
03:31:39.349 --> 03:31:39.359 align:start position:0%
on a couple of those points and then I'd
 
03:31:41.030 --> 03:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
love to entertain questions and I'll try
 
03:31:42.710 --> 03:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
to respond to there were just so many
 
03:31:44.389 --> 03:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
different comments made
 
03:31:47.030 --> 03:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
I can't possibly respond to them all but
 
03:31:48.650 --> 03:31:48.660 align:start position:0%
let me try to respond to the ones I
 
03:31:50.690 --> 03:31:50.700 align:start position:0%
think are more important
 
03:31:52.490 --> 03:31:52.500 align:start position:0%
this is a chart
 
03:31:55.190 --> 03:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
of which states tax the two major
 
03:31:57.229 --> 03:31:57.239 align:start position:0%
sources of foreign income taxed by
 
03:32:00.410 --> 03:32:00.420 align:start position:0%
States now are guilty rough Justice you
 
03:32:01.910 --> 03:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
can think of it as something the federal
 
03:32:03.950 --> 03:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
government started doing in 2018 it's
 
03:32:07.429 --> 03:32:07.439 align:start position:0%
taxing on a current basis 50 percent in
 
03:32:10.130 --> 03:32:10.140 align:start position:0%
some states much less than others but
 
03:32:12.229 --> 03:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
it's it's sort of like roughly 50
 
03:32:14.530 --> 03:32:14.540 align:start position:0%
percent of all of your Global income
 
03:32:19.070 --> 03:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
less uh an amount that allows you a
 
03:32:20.809 --> 03:32:20.819 align:start position:0%
return on investment and you know it
 
03:32:22.070 --> 03:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
could go into the formula if you want
 
03:32:23.690 --> 03:32:23.700 align:start position:0%
but basically for a lot of companies
 
03:32:25.010 --> 03:32:25.020 align:start position:0%
it's fifty percent of their Global
 
03:32:26.690 --> 03:32:26.700 align:start position:0%
income is what's in the New Hampshire
 
03:32:28.550 --> 03:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
tax base and what's in what's in the
 
03:32:31.190 --> 03:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
federal tax base that's one method of
 
03:32:32.809 --> 03:32:32.819 align:start position:0%
taxing foreign income that just started
 
03:32:35.269 --> 03:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
four or five years ago New Hampshire is
 
03:32:37.250 --> 03:32:37.260 align:start position:0%
following the federal method of taxing
 
03:32:39.769 --> 03:32:39.779 align:start position:0%
50 percent of that New Hampshire also
 
03:32:41.809 --> 03:32:41.819 align:start position:0%
taxes a hundred percent of subpartaf
 
03:32:43.130 --> 03:32:43.140 align:start position:0%
which is another
 
03:32:44.870 --> 03:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
thing the federal government does which
 
03:32:47.030 --> 03:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
is a smaller category of a sort of a
 
03:32:49.550 --> 03:32:49.560 align:start position:0%
passive type of income earned abroad but
 
03:32:50.870 --> 03:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
really importantly the federal
 
03:32:53.330 --> 03:32:53.340 align:start position:0%
government for 90 years used to tax a
 
03:32:54.769 --> 03:32:54.779 align:start position:0%
hundred percent of foreign dividends so
 
03:32:56.809 --> 03:32:56.819 align:start position:0%
they would tax All Foreign income
 
03:32:59.690 --> 03:32:59.700 align:start position:0%
less what was taxed abroad but on a
 
03:33:01.610 --> 03:33:01.620 align:start position:0%
deferred basis only when you dividended
 
03:33:04.849 --> 03:33:04.859 align:start position:0%
it back they stopped doing that in 2017.
 
03:33:07.070 --> 03:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is one of only three
 
03:33:11.030 --> 03:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
states that taxes that at 50 or above
 
03:33:13.429 --> 03:33:13.439 align:start position:0%
Vermont and New Hampshire and Vermont
 
03:33:16.550 --> 03:33:16.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire tax at 100 percent and uh
 
03:33:19.610 --> 03:33:19.620 align:start position:0%
Minnesota at 50 percent so just uh you
 
03:33:21.830 --> 03:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
know to sum up the bidding here you've
 
03:33:24.650 --> 03:33:24.660 align:start position:0%
got a state that's now taxing roughly 50
 
03:33:24.660 --> 03:33:25.849 align:start position:0%
got a state that's now taxing roughly 50
percent

03:33:25.849 --> 03:33:25.859 align:start position:0%
percent
 
03:33:28.910 --> 03:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
between subpart F and guilty roughly 50
 
03:33:30.469 --> 03:33:30.479 align:start position:0%
percent of foreign income on a current
 
03:33:33.290 --> 03:33:33.300 align:start position:0%
basis less you know a certain amount for
 
03:33:35.210 --> 03:33:35.220 align:start position:0%
some companies as a return on investment
 
03:33:37.790 --> 03:33:37.800 align:start position:0%
and then what you don't tax
 
03:33:40.090 --> 03:33:40.100 align:start position:0%
most if not all of that comes in later
 
03:33:42.830 --> 03:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
when you tax the dividends that get
 
03:33:45.410 --> 03:33:45.420 align:start position:0%
distributed back now in the past the
 
03:33:46.969 --> 03:33:46.979 align:start position:0%
dividends didn't necessarily used to get
 
03:33:48.469 --> 03:33:48.479 align:start position:0%
distributed back as there was a federal
 
03:33:50.929 --> 03:33:50.939 align:start position:0%
tax on those dividends and companies
 
03:33:53.030 --> 03:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
kind of held on to it now there's much
 
03:33:54.110 --> 03:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
less incentive because the federal
 
03:33:56.269 --> 03:33:56.279 align:start position:0%
government doesn't tax that anymore so
 
03:33:58.490 --> 03:33:58.500 align:start position:0%
that's why New Hampshire's taxing more
 
03:33:59.990 --> 03:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
now than the federal government because
 
03:34:01.849 --> 03:34:01.859 align:start position:0%
you're using their own old system of
 
03:34:03.769 --> 03:34:03.779 align:start position:0%
taxing 100 percent of
 
03:34:06.410 --> 03:34:06.420 align:start position:0%
you know residual foreign income when it
 
03:34:08.090 --> 03:34:08.100 align:start position:0%
gets distributed shareholders and your
 
03:34:10.610 --> 03:34:10.620 align:start position:0%
taxing fifty percent of support F and 50
 
03:34:12.650 --> 03:34:12.660 align:start position:0%
percent are guilty when you look at this
 
03:34:15.110 --> 03:34:15.120 align:start position:0%
chart the companies in La the the states
 
03:34:16.849 --> 03:34:16.859 align:start position:0%
in light blue
 
03:34:19.490 --> 03:34:19.500 align:start position:0%
which is a majority of the states don't
 
03:34:21.830 --> 03:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
tax any foreign Source income and that's
 
03:34:23.150 --> 03:34:23.160 align:start position:0%
some of the largest states in the
 
03:34:24.650 --> 03:34:24.660 align:start position:0%
country now you can question their
 
03:34:26.210 --> 03:34:26.220 align:start position:0%
decision or not they're certainly aware
 
03:34:28.309 --> 03:34:28.319 align:start position:0%
of all these discussions that we're
 
03:34:30.229 --> 03:34:30.239 align:start position:0%
having today on you know profit shifting
 
03:34:31.969 --> 03:34:31.979 align:start position:0%
and all that but more than half the
 
03:34:33.710 --> 03:34:33.720 align:start position:0%
states don't tax any foreign Source
 
03:34:36.170 --> 03:34:36.180 align:start position:0%
income a smattering of the state's tax
 
03:34:38.450 --> 03:34:38.460 align:start position:0%
20 or 30 percent of guilty California
 
03:34:40.849 --> 03:34:40.859 align:start position:0%
has a special method where they tax 25
 
03:34:42.889 --> 03:34:42.899 align:start position:0%
percent of foreign dividends but none of
 
03:34:46.130 --> 03:34:46.140 align:start position:0%
guilty Minnesota now is a new state that
 
03:34:48.050 --> 03:34:48.060 align:start position:0%
sort of taxes 50 percent of foreign
 
03:34:49.670 --> 03:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
dividends and fifty percent of dividend
 
03:34:52.849 --> 03:34:52.859 align:start position:0%
of guilty but basically Vermont and New
 
03:34:55.729 --> 03:34:55.739 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are alone among all the states
 
03:34:57.650 --> 03:34:57.660 align:start position:0%
in taxing as much foreign income as
 
03:34:59.030 --> 03:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
you're talking about so when you talk
 
03:35:00.830 --> 03:35:00.840 align:start position:0%
about profit shifting and this is where
 
03:35:02.389 --> 03:35:02.399 align:start position:0%
this all comes together
 
03:35:04.630 --> 03:35:04.640 align:start position:0%
purpose of worldwide combined reporting
 
03:35:07.610 --> 03:35:07.620 align:start position:0%
is on the premise that there's a lot of
 
03:35:09.469 --> 03:35:09.479 align:start position:0%
profit shifting and the only way you can
 
03:35:11.030 --> 03:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
accurately measure how much New
 
03:35:12.889 --> 03:35:12.899 align:start position:0%
Hampshire should get is its fair share
 
03:35:15.469 --> 03:35:15.479 align:start position:0%
is to bring in that foreign income my
 
03:35:17.150 --> 03:35:17.160 align:start position:0%
point here is that either on a current
 
03:35:19.910 --> 03:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
or a deferred basis New Hampshire is
 
03:35:22.610 --> 03:35:22.620 align:start position:0%
bringing in most for many companies all
 
03:35:24.710 --> 03:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
of that foreign income and certainly
 
03:35:27.050 --> 03:35:27.060 align:start position:0%
more than any other state and certainly
 
03:35:28.849 --> 03:35:28.859 align:start position:0%
more than the federal government so this
 
03:35:31.429 --> 03:35:31.439 align:start position:0%
so-called tax Gap here that needs to be
 
03:35:32.750 --> 03:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
addressed by worldwide combined
 
03:35:35.690 --> 03:35:35.700 align:start position:0%
reporting if any state didn't need to do
 
03:35:37.190 --> 03:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
something about it
 
03:35:39.469 --> 03:35:39.479 align:start position:0%
it's your state and and you know and you
 
03:35:41.210 --> 03:35:41.220 align:start position:0%
know it's discreditary chansky mentioned
 
03:35:42.349 --> 03:35:42.359 align:start position:0%
that a little bit although he just
 
03:35:44.570 --> 03:35:44.580 align:start position:0%
mentioned guilty in the chair had a good
 
03:35:46.370 --> 03:35:46.380 align:start position:0%
question on that but the full scope of
 
03:35:48.530 --> 03:35:48.540 align:start position:0%
what you're taxing and the reason being
 
03:35:50.750 --> 03:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
is that even when you dropped worldwide
 
03:35:52.729 --> 03:35:52.739 align:start position:0%
combined reporting in 1986 you
 
03:35:54.710 --> 03:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
immediately started taxing 100 of
 
03:35:56.870 --> 03:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
foreign dividends which is what the
 
03:35:58.130 --> 03:35:58.140 align:start position:0%
federal government had been doing
 
03:36:01.429 --> 03:36:01.439 align:start position:0%
historically and which very few States
 
03:36:03.469 --> 03:36:03.479 align:start position:0%
ever did I mean even back then very few
 
03:36:05.090 --> 03:36:05.100 align:start position:0%
States ever followed the federal model
 
03:36:07.370 --> 03:36:07.380 align:start position:0%
so it's not as if you ever sort of
 
03:36:09.349 --> 03:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
ignored this even when you transitioned
 
03:36:13.070 --> 03:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
in 86 from uh worldwide to Water's Edge
 
03:36:15.290 --> 03:36:15.300 align:start position:0%
you still have been since that day
 
03:36:19.010 --> 03:36:19.020 align:start position:0%
taxing 100 of foreign dividends in 2019
 
03:36:22.490 --> 03:36:22.500 align:start position:0%
effective for 2020 you added in guilty
 
03:36:24.290 --> 03:36:24.300 align:start position:0%
without taking away as all the other
 
03:36:26.990 --> 03:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
states pretty much except for one did
 
03:36:29.570 --> 03:36:29.580 align:start position:0%
when they got rid of foreign dividend
 
03:36:31.250 --> 03:36:31.260 align:start position:0%
you know when they got guilty they got
 
03:36:32.570 --> 03:36:32.580 align:start position:0%
rid of the foreign dividends so you're
 
03:36:34.130 --> 03:36:34.140 align:start position:0%
taxing it two different ways and that
 
03:36:35.809 --> 03:36:35.819 align:start position:0%
it's nothing unconstitutional about that
 
03:36:38.330 --> 03:36:38.340 align:start position:0%
it's just you're covering it two
 
03:36:40.429 --> 03:36:40.439 align:start position:0%
different ways when you know almost no
 
03:36:43.429 --> 03:36:43.439 align:start position:0%
one else is so that's kind of the
 
03:36:45.170 --> 03:36:45.180 align:start position:0%
importance of that chart is it doesn't
 
03:36:46.250 --> 03:36:46.260 align:start position:0%
mean that
 
03:36:48.469 --> 03:36:48.479 align:start position:0%
you know you couldn't or shouldn't
 
03:36:50.510 --> 03:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
consider worldwide but it does mean that
 
03:36:53.150 --> 03:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
the problem that is
 
03:36:55.490 --> 03:36:55.500 align:start position:0%
um is all the proponents keep saying you
 
03:36:57.469 --> 03:36:57.479 align:start position:0%
need worldwide combined reporting from
 
03:36:59.090 --> 03:36:59.100 align:start position:0%
all this profit shifting and all this
 
03:37:00.889 --> 03:37:00.899 align:start position:0%
these big guys getting away with stuff
 
03:37:02.510 --> 03:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
that they're not paying their fair share
 
03:37:05.150 --> 03:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire doesn't
 
03:37:07.190 --> 03:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
hold up to the facts that you are
 
03:37:09.830 --> 03:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
actually including right now in your tax
 
03:37:11.750 --> 03:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
base either on a current or deferred
 
03:37:14.389 --> 03:37:14.399 align:start position:0%
basis most if not all of this foreign
 
03:37:16.429 --> 03:37:16.439 align:start position:0%
Source income
 
03:37:18.290 --> 03:37:18.300 align:start position:0%
just quickly on this one you've all
 
03:37:20.990 --> 03:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
heard you know the the issues on Water's
 
03:37:23.450 --> 03:37:23.460 align:start position:0%
Edge versus uh separate reporting versus
 
03:37:25.790 --> 03:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
worldwide and and there there's only one
 
03:37:27.830 --> 03:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
state that partially taxes worldwide
 
03:37:29.809 --> 03:37:29.819 align:start position:0%
right now and that's Alaska for oil and
 
03:37:32.210 --> 03:37:32.220 align:start position:0%
gas as you can see from this map all the
 
03:37:34.130 --> 03:37:34.140 align:start position:0%
blue States I think some of them said
 
03:37:37.070 --> 03:37:37.080 align:start position:0%
the number 27 do Water's Edge and again
 
03:37:38.330 --> 03:37:38.340 align:start position:0%
it's been pointed out just because
 
03:37:40.309 --> 03:37:40.319 align:start position:0%
nobody else does it
 
03:37:42.769 --> 03:37:42.779 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that you shouldn't do it
 
03:37:44.929 --> 03:37:44.939 align:start position:0%
but given that you're already taxing a
 
03:37:47.210 --> 03:37:47.220 align:start position:0%
lot of the if not all of the income
 
03:37:50.510 --> 03:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
that's subject to contention here uh to
 
03:37:52.190 --> 03:37:52.200 align:start position:0%
move to a whole other system that nobody
 
03:37:53.929 --> 03:37:53.939 align:start position:0%
else is doing it and I might add you
 
03:37:55.250 --> 03:37:55.260 align:start position:0%
know and there it would would take a
 
03:37:57.950 --> 03:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
much longer discussion but the comments
 
03:38:01.130 --> 03:38:01.140 align:start position:0%
that Dan bucks and Darian made about
 
03:38:03.050 --> 03:38:03.060 align:start position:0%
the rest of the world is looking at
 
03:38:05.269 --> 03:38:05.279 align:start position:0%
things like worldwide apportionment it's
 
03:38:06.950 --> 03:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
certainly true the rest of the world is
 
03:38:09.650 --> 03:38:09.660 align:start position:0%
looking at ways of having global minimum
 
03:38:13.670 --> 03:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
taxes in pillar 2 and in guilty the U.S
 
03:38:15.590 --> 03:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
started this whole thing that are
 
03:38:17.269 --> 03:38:17.279 align:start position:0%
different than the prior methods and
 
03:38:19.370 --> 03:38:19.380 align:start position:0%
that vary from arm's length but that
 
03:38:20.510 --> 03:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean they're the same as
 
03:38:21.710 --> 03:38:21.720 align:start position:0%
worldwide and just to give you an
 
03:38:24.530 --> 03:38:24.540 align:start position:0%
example of the European Union is more
 
03:38:26.510 --> 03:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
seriously than ever considering having
 
03:38:28.910 --> 03:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
formulary apportionment but they're
 
03:38:30.889 --> 03:38:30.899 align:start position:0%
considering having it for a Water's Edge
 
03:38:32.510 --> 03:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
for the European Union they're not
 
03:38:34.630 --> 03:38:34.640 align:start position:0%
talking about doing worldwide so again
 
03:38:37.849 --> 03:38:37.859 align:start position:0%
even though there's lots of Concepts and
 
03:38:40.910 --> 03:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
Global taxation is Shifting doesn't mean
 
03:38:42.769 --> 03:38:42.779 align:start position:0%
that they're moving in the direction of
 
03:38:45.229 --> 03:38:45.239 align:start position:0%
what the states would do with Worldwide
 
03:38:47.510 --> 03:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
combined reporting and the other thing I
 
03:38:50.330 --> 03:38:50.340 align:start position:0%
should point out is that all of these
 
03:38:52.190 --> 03:38:52.200 align:start position:0%
measures that are being considered by
 
03:38:55.010 --> 03:38:55.020 align:start position:0%
the eoecd or by the federal governments
 
03:38:57.469 --> 03:38:57.479 align:start position:0%
around the world in terms of having
 
03:38:59.570 --> 03:38:59.580 align:start position:0%
global minimum taxes and I'd be glad to
 
03:39:01.370 --> 03:39:01.380 align:start position:0%
answer questions I'm quite familiar with
 
03:39:03.469 --> 03:39:03.479 align:start position:0%
what they're proposing all are being
 
03:39:06.410 --> 03:39:06.420 align:start position:0%
done at the national level there's not a
 
03:39:08.630 --> 03:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
single sub-national government other
 
03:39:10.309 --> 03:39:10.319 align:start position:0%
than the US in the world that's really
 
03:39:12.290 --> 03:39:12.300 align:start position:0%
approaching these with a minor exception
 
03:39:15.110 --> 03:39:15.120 align:start position:0%
I mentioned in my slides of Korea taxes
 
03:39:17.330 --> 03:39:17.340 align:start position:0%
a little bit of foreign Source income at
 
03:39:20.450 --> 03:39:20.460 align:start position:0%
the sub-national level but these issues
 
03:39:22.010 --> 03:39:22.020 align:start position:0%
are all being addressed because they're
 
03:39:23.330 --> 03:39:23.340 align:start position:0%
quite complex
 
03:39:25.550 --> 03:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
at the national level and that's not
 
03:39:26.929 --> 03:39:26.939 align:start position:0%
because these countries don't have
 
03:39:28.610 --> 03:39:28.620 align:start position:0%
sub-national governments a lot of them
 
03:39:30.769 --> 03:39:30.779 align:start position:0%
don't but about 20 percent of the oecd
 
03:39:32.990 --> 03:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
G20 Nations have sub-national income
 
03:39:34.969 --> 03:39:34.979 align:start position:0%
taxes Germany Canada and so forth
 
03:39:37.130 --> 03:39:37.140 align:start position:0%
they're not doing this sub-national
 
03:39:40.370 --> 03:39:40.380 align:start position:0%
level so you know in my mind the there
 
03:39:42.309 --> 03:39:42.319 align:start position:0%
is a problem here in terms of
 
03:39:44.590 --> 03:39:44.600 align:start position:0%
modernizing the world's
 
03:39:47.510 --> 03:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
taxing system in an income taxing system
 
03:39:49.910 --> 03:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
to address the ability to in the
 
03:39:52.490 --> 03:39:52.500 align:start position:0%
complexity of Supply chains and Global
 
03:39:54.950 --> 03:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
growth and global trade but it's all at
 
03:39:56.330 --> 03:39:56.340 align:start position:0%
the national level it's a sub-national
 
03:39:57.710 --> 03:39:57.720 align:start position:0%
level and there's there's a reason for
 
03:39:59.150 --> 03:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
that because it's complicated and
 
03:40:02.150 --> 03:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
because if in the U.S and
 
03:40:04.250 --> 03:40:04.260 align:start position:0%
um I can send you my article I wrote on
 
03:40:06.349 --> 03:40:06.359 align:start position:0%
this if in the U.S the U.S does it at
 
03:40:08.690 --> 03:40:08.700 align:start position:0%
the national level and the sub-national
 
03:40:10.790 --> 03:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
level we're going to be taxing arguably
 
03:40:13.070 --> 03:40:13.080 align:start position:0%
our multinationals more than other
 
03:40:15.170 --> 03:40:15.180 align:start position:0%
countries will who are only just taxing
 
03:40:17.269 --> 03:40:17.279 align:start position:0%
it at the national levels one other
 
03:40:19.190 --> 03:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
point I wanted to make out on guilty is
 
03:40:21.710 --> 03:40:21.720 align:start position:0%
I talked about guilty being 50 percent
 
03:40:21.720 --> 03:40:23.090 align:start position:0%
I talked about guilty being 50 percent
roughly

03:40:23.090 --> 03:40:23.100 align:start position:0%
roughly
 
03:40:25.790 --> 03:40:25.800 align:start position:0%
that's true but in 2026 at the federal
 
03:40:27.590 --> 03:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
level it's going to go up to and New
 
03:40:29.570 --> 03:40:29.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would conform it would go up
 
03:40:33.110 --> 03:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
to 62.5 percent so all of a sudden 62.5
 
03:40:34.790 --> 03:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
percent of
 
03:40:37.190 --> 03:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
the current income or the current income
 
03:40:39.650 --> 03:40:39.660 align:start position:0%
less you know return on investment would
 
03:40:41.990 --> 03:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
be taxed federally and in New Hampshire
 
03:40:44.929 --> 03:40:44.939 align:start position:0%
without you doing anything so again this
 
03:40:47.269 --> 03:40:47.279 align:start position:0%
is not an issue that's being ignored by
 
03:40:50.690 --> 03:40:50.700 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire just a couple points
 
03:40:53.030 --> 03:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
on the administrative burden issue and
 
03:40:54.830 --> 03:40:54.840 align:start position:0%
again be glad to answer questions but
 
03:40:56.389 --> 03:40:56.399 align:start position:0%
you know it's certainly true and you
 
03:40:58.929 --> 03:40:58.939 align:start position:0%
know the other speakers you know
 
03:41:01.910 --> 03:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
there's no denying that lots of States
 
03:41:04.370 --> 03:41:04.380 align:start position:0%
had worldwide for a number of years so
 
03:41:07.130 --> 03:41:07.140 align:start position:0%
clearly companies had to comply with it
 
03:41:09.469 --> 03:41:09.479 align:start position:0%
states had to administer it it's
 
03:41:10.849 --> 03:41:10.859 align:start position:0%
certainly true that some companies
 
03:41:12.710 --> 03:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
choose where they can because there's
 
03:41:15.889 --> 03:41:15.899 align:start position:0%
elective worldwide they choose you know
 
03:41:18.170 --> 03:41:18.180 align:start position:0%
obviously probably when they have Global
 
03:41:20.690 --> 03:41:20.700 align:start position:0%
losses or Global profits that are less
 
03:41:22.190 --> 03:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
than their domestic ones they choose
 
03:41:23.570 --> 03:41:23.580 align:start position:0%
worldwide and they go through the
 
03:41:26.030 --> 03:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
administrative headache of that it's not
 
03:41:28.670 --> 03:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
true that it's just a 900 or a thousand
 
03:41:30.229 --> 03:41:30.239 align:start position:0%
dollar return you know we've talked to
 
03:41:32.750 --> 03:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
lots of our members about how burdensome
 
03:41:34.670 --> 03:41:34.680 align:start position:0%
if it is and I'll just give you one
 
03:41:37.130 --> 03:41:37.140 align:start position:0%
example and this is really pertinent to
 
03:41:38.150 --> 03:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
03:41:40.729 --> 03:41:40.739 align:start position:0%
it's certainly true that you tax guilty
 
03:41:43.190 --> 03:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
and foreign dividends now right subpart
 
03:41:45.349 --> 03:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
F so you might say well wait a minute
 
03:41:46.849 --> 03:41:46.859 align:start position:0%
you've already got all this Global
 
03:41:49.429 --> 03:41:49.439 align:start position:0%
income in your tax base don't you
 
03:41:51.710 --> 03:41:51.720 align:start position:0%
already have all these complexities
 
03:41:53.929 --> 03:41:53.939 align:start position:0%
and the answer is no and the reason it's
 
03:41:56.630 --> 03:41:56.640 align:start position:0%
no is because guilty in foreign
 
03:41:59.150 --> 03:41:59.160 align:start position:0%
dividends and subpart all F all of those
 
03:42:01.490 --> 03:42:01.500 align:start position:0%
figures have to be calculated for
 
03:42:04.250 --> 03:42:04.260 align:start position:0%
federal purposes they're on the 5471 or
 
03:42:06.229 --> 03:42:06.239 align:start position:0%
some other return so it's not that you
 
03:42:07.670 --> 03:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
don't have to come up with some
 
03:42:09.469 --> 03:42:09.479 align:start position:0%
adjustments and apportionment for those
 
03:42:10.969 --> 03:42:10.979 align:start position:0%
but they're already on the federal
 
03:42:14.330 --> 03:42:14.340 align:start position:0%
return if you go to worldwide
 
03:42:17.750 --> 03:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
worldwide you know that you do have to
 
03:42:19.490 --> 03:42:19.500 align:start position:0%
and it's not like you have to file a
 
03:42:21.410 --> 03:42:21.420 align:start position:0%
return for your 100 subsidiaries around
 
03:42:23.210 --> 03:42:23.220 align:start position:0%
the world but you do have to look at
 
03:42:25.729 --> 03:42:25.739 align:start position:0%
your worldwide book income you do have
 
03:42:27.830 --> 03:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
to look at adjustments that have to be
 
03:42:30.229 --> 03:42:30.239 align:start position:0%
made just like you make adjustments now
 
03:42:32.150 --> 03:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire versus Federal you'd
 
03:42:33.830 --> 03:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
have to do the same thing for worldwide
 
03:42:35.510 --> 03:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
it is harder to do because there's
 
03:42:37.910 --> 03:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
different Accounting Standards you have
 
03:42:39.469 --> 03:42:39.479 align:start position:0%
different depreciation you treat
 
03:42:41.210 --> 03:42:41.220 align:start position:0%
Partnerships differently than most the
 
03:42:43.070 --> 03:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
world does so there are a number of
 
03:42:46.250 --> 03:42:46.260 align:start position:0%
adjustments that have to be made and
 
03:42:49.190 --> 03:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
make that a much more complicated and
 
03:42:51.410 --> 03:42:51.420 align:start position:0%
again not impossible not something that
 
03:42:53.269 --> 03:42:53.279 align:start position:0%
companies couldn't do or States couldn't
 
03:42:54.769 --> 03:42:54.779 align:start position:0%
administer but quite a bit more
 
03:42:57.830 --> 03:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
difficult and much more expensive than
 
03:42:59.630 --> 03:42:59.640 align:start position:0%
the current system where you're pulling
 
03:43:02.150 --> 03:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
in a lot of foreign Source income based
 
03:43:05.450 --> 03:43:05.460 align:start position:0%
on numbers that are available or largely
 
03:43:07.969 --> 03:43:07.979 align:start position:0%
available for federal purposes and the
 
03:43:09.769 --> 03:43:09.779 align:start position:0%
point of this slide is it's not just a
 
03:43:11.690 --> 03:43:11.700 align:start position:0%
problem for the companies it's a problem
 
03:43:13.729 --> 03:43:13.739 align:start position:0%
for the Department you have to audit
 
03:43:15.710 --> 03:43:15.720 align:start position:0%
this stuff and you're a small state and
 
03:43:17.450 --> 03:43:17.460 align:start position:0%
so you will have to unless you want to
 
03:43:20.210 --> 03:43:20.220 align:start position:0%
just accept the numbers come up with
 
03:43:22.969 --> 03:43:22.979 align:start position:0%
Auditors who understand some of the
 
03:43:24.950 --> 03:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
differences that I was talking about and
 
03:43:26.870 --> 03:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
potentially understand differences
 
03:43:29.150 --> 03:43:29.160 align:start position:0%
between IFRS
 
03:43:30.889 --> 03:43:30.899 align:start position:0%
excuse me in gaap which are
 
03:43:33.950 --> 03:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
International Accounting rules in in U.S
 
03:43:36.290 --> 03:43:36.300 align:start position:0%
counting rules certainly differences you
 
03:43:39.590 --> 03:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
have in your tax base and deductions and
 
03:43:41.269 --> 03:43:41.279 align:start position:0%
the way you treat flow through entities
 
03:43:43.490 --> 03:43:43.500 align:start position:0%
for for New Hampshire versus the rest of
 
03:43:47.030 --> 03:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
the world and so again I'm just like I
 
03:43:48.050 --> 03:43:48.060 align:start position:0%
did with
 
03:43:50.330 --> 03:43:50.340 align:start position:0%
worldwide combined reporting I'm not
 
03:43:51.889 --> 03:43:51.899 align:start position:0%
suggesting at all that you can't do that
 
03:43:53.809 --> 03:43:53.819 align:start position:0%
you certainly can it's constitutional
 
03:43:55.490 --> 03:43:55.500 align:start position:0%
it's not that people couldn't eventually
 
03:43:58.190 --> 03:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
comply with this but it's way harder
 
03:43:59.929 --> 03:43:59.939 align:start position:0%
than your current system whereas I
 
03:44:02.210 --> 03:44:02.220 align:start position:0%
pointed out you're already taxing
 
03:44:06.170 --> 03:44:06.180 align:start position:0%
most if not all foreign Source income
 
03:44:08.389 --> 03:44:08.399 align:start position:0%
final point I wanted to make was just to
 
03:44:10.849 --> 03:44:10.859 align:start position:0%
sum up some of the other points on the
 
03:44:13.309 --> 03:44:13.319 align:start position:0%
on the on the policy concern so you know
 
03:44:15.349 --> 03:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
all things being equal compared to what
 
03:44:16.969 --> 03:44:16.979 align:start position:0%
you're doing now and you know I'm not
 
03:44:18.290 --> 03:44:18.300 align:start position:0%
endorsing necessarily what you're doing
 
03:44:20.269 --> 03:44:20.279 align:start position:0%
now I mean most businesses would say
 
03:44:22.130 --> 03:44:22.140 align:start position:0%
you're taxing way more foreign Source
 
03:44:24.229 --> 03:44:24.239 align:start position:0%
income than you should but given that
 
03:44:27.290 --> 03:44:27.300 align:start position:0%
you are the administrative complexity of
 
03:44:29.150 --> 03:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
switching to worldwide combined
 
03:44:30.710 --> 03:44:30.720 align:start position:0%
reporting instead of doing it the way
 
03:44:35.150 --> 03:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
you are it is significant there is and
 
03:44:36.650 --> 03:44:36.660 align:start position:0%
you may or may not care about being a
 
03:44:38.269 --> 03:44:38.279 align:start position:0%
policy outlier but you know if you did
 
03:44:40.309 --> 03:44:40.319 align:start position:0%
worldwide combine reporting
 
03:44:42.889 --> 03:44:42.899 align:start position:0%
you would be the first state to do it at
 
03:44:45.490 --> 03:44:45.500 align:start position:0%
least in the last 30 or 35 years
 
03:44:47.809 --> 03:44:47.819 align:start position:0%
you'd be the only state to do it right
 
03:44:50.389 --> 03:44:50.399 align:start position:0%
now other than Alaska for for the oil
 
03:44:53.330 --> 03:44:53.340 align:start position:0%
and gas industry uh in some other states
 
03:44:56.030 --> 03:44:56.040 align:start position:0%
on an elective basis the federal
 
03:44:58.550 --> 03:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
government doesn't do it there are some
 
03:45:00.769 --> 03:45:00.779 align:start position:0%
overlapping concepts with what's going
 
03:45:02.690 --> 03:45:02.700 align:start position:0%
on and extremely if you read about
 
03:45:05.510 --> 03:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
pillar one and pillar two it's extremely
 
03:45:07.010 --> 03:45:07.020 align:start position:0%
complicated what they're trying to do
 
03:45:08.690 --> 03:45:08.700 align:start position:0%
but they are doing it the national level
 
03:45:10.910 --> 03:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
and they aren't going all the way to
 
03:45:13.190 --> 03:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
combine reporting they have more minimum
 
03:45:14.990 --> 03:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
tax structures you know if a low tax
 
03:45:17.389 --> 03:45:17.399 align:start position:0%
countries not taxing something we're
 
03:45:19.910 --> 03:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
going to tax it up to 15 percent but
 
03:45:22.190 --> 03:45:22.200 align:start position:0%
again they're all based on either
 
03:45:24.170 --> 03:45:24.180 align:start position:0%
forcing the low tax country to raise
 
03:45:25.849 --> 03:45:25.859 align:start position:0%
their rates or get rid of some of their
 
03:45:27.769 --> 03:45:27.779 align:start position:0%
credits incentives or having the home
 
03:45:30.110 --> 03:45:30.120 align:start position:0%
country of the multinational
 
03:45:33.889 --> 03:45:33.899 align:start position:0%
tax the stuff the tax burden I addressed
 
03:45:35.630 --> 03:45:35.640 align:start position:0%
before I just have one of the stats
 
03:45:37.490 --> 03:45:37.500 align:start position:0%
there but there's some worse ones in the
 
03:45:39.349 --> 03:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
sense of you know if you think business
 
03:45:41.929 --> 03:45:41.939 align:start position:0%
should pay more in New Hampshire which
 
03:45:44.330 --> 03:45:44.340 align:start position:0%
is you know you don't have to be at the
 
03:45:46.550 --> 03:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
national averages or whatever but you
 
03:45:48.170 --> 03:45:48.180 align:start position:0%
know certainly I think that our annual
 
03:45:50.030 --> 03:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
study shows that because of your unique
 
03:45:52.510 --> 03:45:52.520 align:start position:0%
tax structure business is paying
 
03:45:55.030 --> 03:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
particularly at the state level
 
03:45:57.889 --> 03:45:57.899 align:start position:0%
significantly more of all taxes than
 
03:46:00.290 --> 03:46:00.300 align:start position:0%
they do in Most states and that's you
 
03:46:02.570 --> 03:46:02.580 align:start position:0%
know that's appropriate from your
 
03:46:04.130 --> 03:46:04.140 align:start position:0%
perspective but again I don't think you
 
03:46:06.590 --> 03:46:06.600 align:start position:0%
have to add on to that but a new tax
 
03:46:09.050 --> 03:46:09.060 align:start position:0%
system that imposes even potentially
 
03:46:10.969 --> 03:46:10.979 align:start position:0%
more burden and then the revenue
 
03:46:12.950 --> 03:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
estimate in either Department of Revenue
 
03:46:14.870 --> 03:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
could talk to this but
 
03:46:16.849 --> 03:46:16.859 align:start position:0%
some of these numbers like these
 
03:46:18.830 --> 03:46:18.840 align:start position:0%
suggestions that you would just get this
 
03:46:21.469 --> 03:46:21.479 align:start position:0%
you know fantasy 177 million dollars
 
03:46:24.469 --> 03:46:24.479 align:start position:0%
quoted by several of the speakers uh you
 
03:46:26.150 --> 03:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
know they don't back away from the
 
03:46:28.190 --> 03:46:28.200 align:start position:0%
number but you know the number does not
 
03:46:30.650 --> 03:46:30.660 align:start position:0%
take into account
 
03:46:32.990 --> 03:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
let alone critiques of you know whether
 
03:46:35.510 --> 03:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
the the under underlying numbers are
 
03:46:37.969 --> 03:46:37.979 align:start position:0%
valid or not or overstated to start with
 
03:46:39.950 --> 03:46:39.960 align:start position:0%
but far more important doesn't take into
 
03:46:42.290 --> 03:46:42.300 align:start position:0%
account what you're taxing Darian
 
03:46:43.550 --> 03:46:43.560 align:start position:0%
brought something else up which it
 
03:46:45.290 --> 03:46:45.300 align:start position:0%
doesn't take into account apportionment
 
03:46:47.210 --> 03:46:47.220 align:start position:0%
it's not adding the foreign factors
 
03:46:48.830 --> 03:46:48.840 align:start position:0%
which you really would have to add in
 
03:46:50.510 --> 03:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
but even more important than that it is
 
03:46:52.910 --> 03:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
it doesn't take account that New
 
03:46:54.769 --> 03:46:54.779 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is already taxing most if not
 
03:46:57.650 --> 03:46:57.660 align:start position:0%
all of this income so that's
 
03:46:59.870 --> 03:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
the the general presentation I did want
 
03:47:01.729 --> 03:47:01.739 align:start position:0%
to make one point on there was some
 
03:47:03.590 --> 03:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
conflation early on and one of the
 
03:47:05.570 --> 03:47:05.580 align:start position:0%
speakers talking about foreign parented
 
03:47:08.210 --> 03:47:08.220 align:start position:0%
companies versus domestic and you know
 
03:47:10.429 --> 03:47:10.439 align:start position:0%
all of these numbers like 170 million
 
03:47:11.750 --> 03:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
seven million dollars those aren't
 
03:47:14.690 --> 03:47:14.700 align:start position:0%
numbers about profit losses from foreign
 
03:47:16.849 --> 03:47:16.859 align:start position:0%
parented companies those are you know
 
03:47:19.309 --> 03:47:19.319 align:start position:0%
U.S parenting companies the reason for
 
03:47:21.710 --> 03:47:21.720 align:start position:0%
that is because pretty much under the
 
03:47:23.570 --> 03:47:23.580 align:start position:0%
international regime right now each
 
03:47:26.450 --> 03:47:26.460 align:start position:0%
country can tax if it wanted to on a
 
03:47:28.429 --> 03:47:28.439 align:start position:0%
worldwide basis its own multinationals
 
03:47:30.610 --> 03:47:30.620 align:start position:0%
they don't tax other countries
 
03:47:33.650 --> 03:47:33.660 align:start position:0%
multinationals so uh you know I think
 
03:47:35.210 --> 03:47:35.220 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit of red herring there
 
03:47:36.590 --> 03:47:36.600 align:start position:0%
are certainly different rules for
 
03:47:39.469 --> 03:47:39.479 align:start position:0%
foreign parented companies but that's
 
03:47:39.479 --> 03:47:40.429 align:start position:0%
foreign parented companies but that's
not

03:47:40.429 --> 03:47:40.439 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:47:42.830 --> 03:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
by any means the big issue here the big
 
03:47:46.010 --> 03:47:46.020 align:start position:0%
issue is U.S parented companies and
 
03:47:47.630 --> 03:47:47.640 align:start position:0%
should you be imposing worldwide
 
03:47:49.309 --> 03:47:49.319 align:start position:0%
combined reporting on them in addition
 
03:47:50.870 --> 03:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
you could consider imposing it on
 
03:47:53.090 --> 03:47:53.100 align:start position:0%
foreign companies which do have certain
 
03:47:55.969 --> 03:47:55.979 align:start position:0%
different rules but that's you know I
 
03:47:57.950 --> 03:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
for me that's sort of a side issue and
 
03:47:59.330 --> 03:47:59.340 align:start position:0%
that's certainly not the issue that's
 
03:48:01.070 --> 03:48:01.080 align:start position:0%
being addressed with the estimates on
 
03:48:02.570 --> 03:48:02.580 align:start position:0%
profit shifting that has nothing to do
 
03:48:04.429 --> 03:48:04.439 align:start position:0%
with foreign parented countries the
 
03:48:07.190 --> 03:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
companies so let me stop there I would
 
03:48:10.130 --> 03:48:10.140 align:start position:0%
love to you know on any of these topics
 
03:48:11.389 --> 03:48:11.399 align:start position:0%
and you know if anybody has any
 
03:48:12.650 --> 03:48:12.660 align:start position:0%
questions on what's going on with other
 
03:48:14.150 --> 03:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
one or pillar two and why that's
 
03:48:15.530 --> 03:48:15.540 align:start position:0%
different than worldwide combined
 
03:48:17.210 --> 03:48:17.220 align:start position:0%
reporting I'd be glad to answer that
 
03:48:19.429 --> 03:48:19.439 align:start position:0%
there's there's a lot there but I I do
 
03:48:21.469 --> 03:48:21.479 align:start position:0%
think that this issue has to be
 
03:48:23.809 --> 03:48:23.819 align:start position:0%
considered not where whether any state
 
03:48:27.170 --> 03:48:27.180 align:start position:0%
should do it I I I don't think they
 
03:48:29.030 --> 03:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
should but certainly the issue here is
 
03:48:30.590 --> 03:48:30.600 align:start position:0%
whether New Hampshire should do
 
03:48:33.050 --> 03:48:33.060 align:start position:0%
worldwide combined reporting and in my
 
03:48:38.210 --> 03:48:38.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:40.070 --> 03:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:48:44.889 --> 03:48:44.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:49.670 --> 03:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:51.889 --> 03:48:51.899 align:start position:0%
the pre-presentation I appreciated but
 
03:48:54.170 --> 03:48:54.180 align:start position:0%
I've got uh a couple three four
 
03:48:55.729 --> 03:48:55.739 align:start position:0%
questions here
 
03:48:55.739 --> 03:48:56.510 align:start position:0%
questions here
um

03:48:56.510 --> 03:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:58.849 --> 03:48:58.859 align:start position:0%
you talked about the percent of Taxation
 
03:49:01.250 --> 03:49:01.260 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire uh can you provide us
 
03:49:03.650 --> 03:49:03.660 align:start position:0%
with the daily source of that uh
 
03:49:06.530 --> 03:49:06.540 align:start position:0%
yeah so it's it's from this report which
 
03:49:09.110 --> 03:49:09.120 align:start position:0%
is based on Federal and state-specific
 
03:49:10.550 --> 03:49:10.560 align:start position:0%
data so
 
03:49:13.130 --> 03:49:13.140 align:start position:0%
Ernst young has an economic policy unit
 
03:49:15.590 --> 03:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
in to my knowledge nobody's ever
 
03:49:17.929 --> 03:49:17.939 align:start position:0%
criticized their underlying numbers I
 
03:49:19.670 --> 03:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
mean you might say well this is not
 
03:49:21.349 --> 03:49:21.359 align:start position:0%
relevant or you know there's an
 
03:49:23.269 --> 03:49:23.279 align:start position:0%
explanation for it but it's all based on
 
03:49:25.370 --> 03:49:25.380 align:start position:0%
Federal and State data if you could
 
03:49:27.410 --> 03:49:27.420 align:start position:0%
provide that too yeah no I will send
 
03:49:29.269 --> 03:49:29.279 align:start position:0%
tonight I'll just send the whole report
 
03:49:30.889 --> 03:49:30.899 align:start position:0%
and we do it once a year so if you went
 
03:49:32.090 --> 03:49:32.100 align:start position:0%
to our website you could see the
 
03:49:34.370 --> 03:49:34.380 align:start position:0%
information for the last 20 years it's
 
03:49:36.349 --> 03:49:36.359 align:start position:0%
it's very informative I mean our our
 
03:49:38.750 --> 03:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
discussion aside all right I just went
 
03:49:41.210 --> 03:49:41.220 align:start position:0%
to your website and it's not you have to
 
03:49:43.429 --> 03:49:43.439 align:start position:0%
log in and all that stuff well no this
 
03:49:45.050 --> 03:49:45.060 align:start position:0%
this information is available for the
 
03:49:47.450 --> 03:49:47.460 align:start position:0%
public so if you just go to the it's
 
03:49:49.010 --> 03:49:49.020 align:start position:0%
there's some things you have to log in
 
03:49:51.769 --> 03:49:51.779 align:start position:0%
for but all of our studies are publicly
 
03:49:51.779 --> 03:49:53.269 align:start position:0%
for but all of our studies are publicly
available

03:49:53.269 --> 03:49:53.279 align:start position:0%
available
 
03:49:56.150 --> 03:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
do that at home from PC
 
03:49:58.610 --> 03:49:58.620 align:start position:0%
um you also talked about the fact that
 
03:50:01.190 --> 03:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
they're sub-national uh in the United
 
03:50:04.370 --> 03:50:04.380 align:start position:0%
States is generally called federalism uh
 
03:50:07.370 --> 03:50:07.380 align:start position:0%
other places uh uh can as with the
 
03:50:08.929 --> 03:50:08.939 align:start position:0%
different provinces have a little
 
03:50:11.870 --> 03:50:11.880 align:start position:0%
slightly different and Germany is based
 
03:50:13.670 --> 03:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
on the Kingdom so it's slightly
 
03:50:15.110 --> 03:50:15.120 align:start position:0%
different Austria same thing for
 
03:50:17.330 --> 03:50:17.340 align:start position:0%
Australia with the different states they
 
03:50:19.849 --> 03:50:19.859 align:start position:0%
have down there but uh so the question
 
03:50:24.130 --> 03:50:24.140 align:start position:0%
is would worldwide uh combined reporting
 
03:50:26.150 --> 03:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
contribute to
 
03:50:28.429 --> 03:50:28.439 align:start position:0%
um the concept of federalism in the
 
03:50:31.750 --> 03:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
United States under the 10th Amendment
 
03:50:34.849 --> 03:50:34.859 align:start position:0%
reserving rights or would it be
 
03:50:37.130 --> 03:50:37.140 align:start position:0%
detrimental to federalism in a
 
03:50:40.370 --> 03:50:40.380 align:start position:0%
philosophical sense and that yes or no
 
03:50:42.410 --> 03:50:42.420 align:start position:0%
is a good enough answer
 
03:50:44.389 --> 03:50:44.399 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I can answer yes or no I
 
03:50:48.790 --> 03:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
mean it's it's a it's a constitutionally
 
03:50:50.630 --> 03:50:50.640 align:start position:0%
sanctioned by the Supreme Court
 
03:50:53.210 --> 03:50:53.220 align:start position:0%
methodology whether it contributes or
 
03:50:55.990 --> 03:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
not is in the eye of the beholder
 
03:50:58.250 --> 03:50:58.260 align:start position:0%
it's kind of the question the answer I
 
03:51:01.429 --> 03:51:01.439 align:start position:0%
was expecting hoping for actually uh if
 
03:51:04.070 --> 03:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
I might Mr chair a couple more yes go
 
03:51:04.080 --> 03:51:04.910 align:start position:0%
I might Mr chair a couple more yes go
ahead

03:51:04.910 --> 03:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
03:51:07.910 --> 03:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
you also mentioned following up on that
 
03:51:11.450 --> 03:51:11.460 align:start position:0%
uh sub-national taxation
 
03:51:14.990 --> 03:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
if a sub-national entity goes to
 
03:51:16.910 --> 03:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
combined reporting
 
03:51:20.150 --> 03:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
and a sub-national entity or even a
 
03:51:23.210 --> 03:51:23.220 align:start position:0%
nation over there wherever over there is
 
03:51:26.030 --> 03:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
goes to combined reporting and yet
 
03:51:28.729 --> 03:51:28.739 align:start position:0%
they're based basing their taxation on
 
03:51:30.710 --> 03:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
the same Corpus
 
03:51:33.710 --> 03:51:33.720 align:start position:0%
so we're getting our cut
 
03:51:35.929 --> 03:51:35.939 align:start position:0%
they're getting their cut on the same
 
03:51:35.939 --> 03:51:36.910 align:start position:0%
they're getting their cut on the same
dollar

03:51:36.910 --> 03:51:36.920 align:start position:0%
dollar
 
03:51:41.450 --> 03:51:41.460 align:start position:0%
so isn't this double triple quadruple
 
03:51:43.550 --> 03:51:43.560 align:start position:0%
potentially absolutely in the Supreme
 
03:51:45.769 --> 03:51:45.779 align:start position:0%
Court kind of said if you read container
 
03:51:47.870 --> 03:51:47.880 align:start position:0%
Barclay that there could be some double
 
03:51:50.630 --> 03:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
or triple taxation but that's not the
 
03:51:52.550 --> 03:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
point the point is if everybody did this
 
03:51:54.410 --> 03:51:54.420 align:start position:0%
method it would work out okay and I'll
 
03:51:56.510 --> 03:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
give you a great example of that one of
 
03:51:57.950 --> 03:51:57.960 align:start position:0%
the objections the business Community
 
03:52:01.250 --> 03:52:01.260 align:start position:0%
has to guilty really is that for federal
 
03:52:03.889 --> 03:52:03.899 align:start position:0%
purposes you calculate a guilty amount
 
03:52:06.349 --> 03:52:06.359 align:start position:0%
and then you deduct foreign tax credits
 
03:52:08.210 --> 03:52:08.220 align:start position:0%
you deduct what was paid abroad right
 
03:52:09.229 --> 03:52:09.239 align:start position:0%
you're not trying to double tax
 
03:52:11.030 --> 03:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
something for State purposes you don't
 
03:52:13.070 --> 03:52:13.080 align:start position:0%
do that because we don't observe foreign
 
03:52:15.290 --> 03:52:15.300 align:start position:0%
tax credits so you bring in guilty and
 
03:52:17.150 --> 03:52:17.160 align:start position:0%
then you apportion it and that may or
 
03:52:18.950 --> 03:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
may not be a rough justice so there's a
 
03:52:20.330 --> 03:52:20.340 align:start position:0%
lot of that going on and there's a lot
 
03:52:22.010 --> 03:52:22.020 align:start position:0%
of risk of that coming up with global
 
03:52:23.929 --> 03:52:23.939 align:start position:0%
tax reform
 
03:52:26.630 --> 03:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
yeah that there's a whole bunch of
 
03:52:28.610 --> 03:52:28.620 align:start position:0%
questions that just came to mind on that
 
03:52:30.410 --> 03:52:30.420 align:start position:0%
which well
 
03:52:32.269 --> 03:52:32.279 align:start position:0%
we may come back to you well no I got
 
03:52:35.630 --> 03:52:35.640 align:start position:0%
one more question on that okay we talked
 
03:52:37.010 --> 03:52:37.020 align:start position:0%
about earlier
 
03:52:38.570 --> 03:52:38.580 align:start position:0%
um and
 
03:52:41.090 --> 03:52:41.100 align:start position:0%
just from your perspective because we
 
03:52:42.349 --> 03:52:42.359 align:start position:0%
I've asked this question of other
 
03:52:45.830 --> 03:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
individuals other presenters as well
 
03:52:45.840 --> 03:52:46.490 align:start position:0%
individuals other presenters as well
um

03:52:46.490 --> 03:52:46.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:49.550 --> 03:52:49.560 align:start position:0%
the the data on Revenue
 
03:52:56.349 --> 03:52:56.359 align:start position:0%
uh pre-19 or 1981 1986 versus after
 
03:53:00.469 --> 03:53:00.479 align:start position:0%
1986. it's my understanding that the
 
03:53:02.630 --> 03:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
business Revenue not just from New
 
03:53:03.830 --> 03:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but
 
03:53:06.229 --> 03:53:06.239 align:start position:0%
globally has increased with the going
 
03:53:07.550 --> 03:53:07.560 align:start position:0%
away from
 
03:53:10.610 --> 03:53:10.620 align:start position:0%
a combined reporting versus
 
03:53:12.950 --> 03:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
the percentage or the the basis that was
 
03:53:12.960 --> 03:53:14.450 align:start position:0%
the percentage or the the basis that was
there

03:53:14.450 --> 03:53:14.460 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:53:17.210 --> 03:53:17.220 align:start position:0%
at that time do you have any data on
 
03:53:17.220 --> 03:53:18.229 align:start position:0%
at that time do you have any data on
that

03:53:18.229 --> 03:53:18.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:53:21.170 --> 03:53:21.180 align:start position:0%
I I don't I mean I haven't seen a study
 
03:53:23.030 --> 03:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
that's that's looked conclusively at
 
03:53:24.950 --> 03:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
that not not that it doesn't exist but I
 
03:53:26.389 --> 03:53:26.399 align:start position:0%
would mention one thing you brought up
 
03:53:27.950 --> 03:53:27.960 align:start position:0%
the question to several other
 
03:53:27.960 --> 03:53:30.050 align:start position:0%
the question to several other
speakers

03:53:30.050 --> 03:53:30.060 align:start position:0%
speakers
 
03:53:32.929 --> 03:53:32.939 align:start position:0%
um on what about if you have losses and
 
03:53:33.950 --> 03:53:33.960 align:start position:0%
there's an interesting question because
 
03:53:35.330 --> 03:53:35.340 align:start position:0%
it's a valid you know I mean I think
 
03:53:37.070 --> 03:53:37.080 align:start position:0%
overall you're going to have more gains
 
03:53:39.229 --> 03:53:39.239 align:start position:0%
and losses so you know but you know the
 
03:53:41.389 --> 03:53:41.399 align:start position:0%
losses are reflected and you could
 
03:53:42.830 --> 03:53:42.840 align:start position:0%
actually lose money from different
 
03:53:44.990 --> 03:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
companies with combined reporting but
 
03:53:46.309 --> 03:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
you know with Worldwide combined
 
03:53:47.570 --> 03:53:47.580 align:start position:0%
reporting what's interesting though is
 
03:53:50.090 --> 03:53:50.100 align:start position:0%
guilty and foreign Dividends are only
 
03:53:52.550 --> 03:53:52.560 align:start position:0%
positive numbers you don't nor does the
 
03:53:55.070 --> 03:53:55.080 align:start position:0%
federal government allow foreign losses
 
03:53:57.590 --> 03:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
to come into the calculation they you
 
03:53:59.570 --> 03:53:59.580 align:start position:0%
know that they may reduce a given Year's
 
03:54:01.969 --> 03:54:01.979 align:start position:0%
guilty but you don't get a negative
 
03:54:03.590 --> 03:54:03.600 align:start position:0%
number that carries over so the way
 
03:54:04.790 --> 03:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
you're doing it right now is only
 
03:54:06.650 --> 03:54:06.660 align:start position:0%
pulling in positive Revenue you're not
 
03:54:10.790 --> 03:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
pulling in losses from abroad but given
 
03:54:12.410 --> 03:54:12.420 align:start position:0%
your current system a taxing foreign
 
03:54:14.510 --> 03:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
Source income
 
03:54:17.450 --> 03:54:17.460 align:start position:0%
yeah but at the same time that positive
 
03:54:21.349 --> 03:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
member can be reduced by the expenses
 
03:54:23.510 --> 03:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
it can be reduced by losses and the
 
03:54:25.070 --> 03:54:25.080 align:start position:0%
foreign dividend number can't because
 
03:54:26.570 --> 03:54:26.580 align:start position:0%
that's only a positive number it can be
 
03:54:28.070 --> 03:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
reduced in a given year but let's say a
 
03:54:30.889 --> 03:54:30.899 align:start position:0%
company has 100 million dollar loss that
 
03:54:32.929 --> 03:54:32.939 align:start position:0%
it's a current year number that gets
 
03:54:35.210 --> 03:54:35.220 align:start position:0%
lost that doesn't come over to New
 
03:54:38.210 --> 03:54:38.220 align:start position:0%
Hampshire wow you're essentially seeing
 
03:54:39.710 --> 03:54:39.720 align:start position:0%
there's no carry forward there's no
 
03:54:41.750 --> 03:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
carry forward on on guilty it doesn't
 
03:54:44.269 --> 03:54:44.279 align:start position:0%
work that way yeah so that you know
 
03:54:46.910 --> 03:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
well that would let's do do the ship
 
03:54:48.830 --> 03:54:48.840 align:start position:0%
building because like if we're coming up
 
03:54:51.650 --> 03:54:51.660 align:start position:0%
with a new let's say uh that company is
 
03:54:52.969 --> 03:54:52.979 align:start position:0%
coming up with the new ship building
 
03:54:57.710 --> 03:54:57.720 align:start position:0%
design in Norway at one of their yards
 
03:54:59.389 --> 03:54:59.399 align:start position:0%
but they need money
 
03:55:02.750 --> 03:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
because Norway's not financing it
 
03:55:04.429 --> 03:55:04.439 align:start position:0%
uh because it's going to be a commercial
 
03:55:06.710 --> 03:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
ship or something like that super
 
03:55:09.530 --> 03:55:09.540 align:start position:0%
fantastic green ship
 
03:55:09.540 --> 03:55:10.969 align:start position:0%
fantastic green ship
um

03:55:10.969 --> 03:55:10.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:55:12.110 --> 03:55:12.120 align:start position:0%
they're going to need money from
 
03:55:13.610 --> 03:55:13.620 align:start position:0%
somewhere to finance that so they're
 
03:55:14.870 --> 03:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
going to take it from everywhere they
 
03:55:16.729 --> 03:55:16.739 align:start position:0%
can to in order to do that that's just
 
03:55:18.769 --> 03:55:18.779 align:start position:0%
shifting profits from here to there to
 
03:55:20.809 --> 03:55:20.819 align:start position:0%
pay for something else yeah and I mean
 
03:55:23.030 --> 03:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
that would be over a period of time yeah
 
03:55:25.070 --> 03:55:25.080 align:start position:0%
I mean there's a this is this is a you
 
03:55:26.630 --> 03:55:26.640 align:start position:0%
know it's a little esoteric but the big
 
03:55:27.889 --> 03:55:27.899 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest difference one of the
 
03:55:29.689 --> 03:55:29.699 align:start position:0%
biggest differences between pillar 2 and
 
03:55:32.150 --> 03:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
guilty is pillar two is a country by
 
03:55:34.130 --> 03:55:34.140 align:start position:0%
country calculation so they don't take
 
03:55:35.570 --> 03:55:35.580 align:start position:0%
in account losses in other countries
 
03:55:37.969 --> 03:55:37.979 align:start position:0%
guilty as a net calculation but there
 
03:55:40.189 --> 03:55:40.199 align:start position:0%
isn't carryover losses as you said so
 
03:55:43.070 --> 03:55:43.080 align:start position:0%
you know it's not it doesn't mean you'll
 
03:55:44.389 --> 03:55:44.399 align:start position:0%
get more or less out of worldwide
 
03:55:45.769 --> 03:55:45.779 align:start position:0%
combined reporting but it is a
 
03:55:47.870 --> 03:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
difference you're not pulling in sort of
 
03:55:50.450 --> 03:55:50.460 align:start position:0%
net losses from foreign operations right
 
03:55:52.849 --> 03:55:52.859 align:start position:0%
now into your tax system thank you for
 
03:55:55.969 --> 03:55:55.979 align:start position:0%
providing more questions thank you my
 
03:55:55.979 --> 03:55:58.929 align:start position:0%
providing more questions thank you my
pleasure

03:55:58.929 --> 03:55:58.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:02.689 --> 03:56:02.699 align:start position:0%
one question I'd like to ask so we have
 
03:56:05.870 --> 03:56:05.880 align:start position:0%
some states apparently that offer an
 
03:56:05.880 --> 03:56:07.370 align:start position:0%
some states apparently that offer an
option

03:56:07.370 --> 03:56:07.380 align:start position:0%
option
 
03:56:10.550 --> 03:56:10.560 align:start position:0%
and I have to presume that that option
 
03:56:12.889 --> 03:56:12.899 align:start position:0%
is always evaluated in the sense of
 
03:56:16.010 --> 03:56:16.020 align:start position:0%
which methodology results in the lower
 
03:56:17.929 --> 03:56:17.939 align:start position:0%
tax bill
 
03:56:17.939 --> 03:56:19.189 align:start position:0%
tax bill
so

03:56:19.189 --> 03:56:19.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:56:21.170 --> 03:56:21.180 align:start position:0%
based on your experience what's the
 
03:56:23.330 --> 03:56:23.340 align:start position:0%
rationale of those States
 
03:56:27.170 --> 03:56:27.180 align:start position:0%
that say you can if it works better for
 
03:56:31.189 --> 03:56:31.199 align:start position:0%
you file unitary combined reporting but
 
03:56:32.750 --> 03:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
you can also limit it the water's edge
 
03:56:36.170 --> 03:56:36.180 align:start position:0%
if you want well I'm thinking that yeah
 
03:56:37.849 --> 03:56:37.859 align:start position:0%
I mean one qualification and what you
 
03:56:39.830 --> 03:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
just said is most the states that allow
 
03:56:41.689 --> 03:56:41.699 align:start position:0%
the option I think there's like 10 or 8
 
03:56:44.330 --> 03:56:44.340 align:start position:0%
or something require you to do it for a
 
03:56:46.070 --> 03:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
number of years so it's not like you can
 
03:56:49.250 --> 03:56:49.260 align:start position:0%
go back and forth so you know it does
 
03:56:51.349 --> 03:56:51.359 align:start position:0%
give them you know maybe they think it's
 
03:56:54.110 --> 03:56:54.120 align:start position:0%
it's fair I mean if you if you have
 
03:56:57.590 --> 03:56:57.600 align:start position:0%
on a continuous basis less profitable or
 
03:56:59.750 --> 03:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
losing operations abroad than you do in
 
03:57:01.849 --> 03:57:01.859 align:start position:0%
your us it's you know it's a might be
 
03:57:03.830 --> 03:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
perceived as a fair way of income
 
03:57:06.590 --> 03:57:06.600 align:start position:0%
averaging but a lot of it binds you for
 
03:57:09.110 --> 03:57:09.120 align:start position:0%
it for a number of years so I guess you
 
03:57:10.849 --> 03:57:10.859 align:start position:0%
know I I can't answer specifically your
 
03:57:12.229 --> 03:57:12.239 align:start position:0%
question some of it may just be a
 
03:57:14.570 --> 03:57:14.580 align:start position:0%
carryover those are mostly the same
 
03:57:16.610 --> 03:57:16.620 align:start position:0%
States that had it before and they
 
03:57:18.469 --> 03:57:18.479 align:start position:0%
either left it as the default like
 
03:57:20.090 --> 03:57:20.100 align:start position:0%
California and then you can opt into the
 
03:57:22.429 --> 03:57:22.439 align:start position:0%
water's edge that's what happened with a
 
03:57:23.929 --> 03:57:23.939 align:start position:0%
lot of them it just they didn't get rid
 
03:57:25.429 --> 03:57:25.439 align:start position:0%
of it from their system they just gave
 
03:57:28.070 --> 03:57:28.080 align:start position:0%
you the water's edge option
 
03:57:29.929 --> 03:57:29.939 align:start position:0%
that one leaves me curious to dig
 
03:57:32.570 --> 03:57:32.580 align:start position:0%
further but thank you yeah
 
03:57:35.090 --> 03:57:35.100 align:start position:0%
I also wanted to clarify so I've seen
 
03:57:37.010 --> 03:57:37.020 align:start position:0%
the state by state report in the past
 
03:57:40.969 --> 03:57:40.979 align:start position:0%
it's very helpful and I understand the
 
03:57:43.250 --> 03:57:43.260 align:start position:0%
the basis for your
 
03:57:45.950 --> 03:57:45.960 align:start position:0%
uh indication that New Hampshire
 
03:57:50.150 --> 03:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
raises 47.9 obvious state and local
 
03:57:50.160 --> 03:57:51.410 align:start position:0%
raises 47.9 obvious state and local
taxes

03:57:51.410 --> 03:57:51.420 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
03:57:53.929 --> 03:57:53.939 align:start position:0%
through the business taxes
 
03:57:56.929 --> 03:57:56.939 align:start position:0%
compared to 43.6 which is not such a
 
03:57:58.929 --> 03:57:58.939 align:start position:0%
drastic difference
 
03:58:01.670 --> 03:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
to say something else and I'm not sure I
 
03:58:04.910 --> 03:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
picked up on what you were you mentioned
 
03:58:07.210 --> 03:58:07.220 align:start position:0%
something else about there being
 
03:58:10.070 --> 03:58:10.080 align:start position:0%
62.7 percent of New Hampshire's revenue
 
03:58:12.769 --> 03:58:12.779 align:start position:0%
from business so we break the 37 average
 
03:58:15.410 --> 03:58:15.420 align:start position:0%
and I didn't get the distinction it's a
 
03:58:17.389 --> 03:58:17.399 align:start position:0%
great question so and there's just a
 
03:58:18.889 --> 03:58:18.899 align:start position:0%
separate chart in there that you'll see
 
03:58:20.990 --> 03:58:21.000 align:start position:0%
but we break it down the first
 
03:58:23.090 --> 03:58:23.100 align:start position:0%
statistics you mentioned was what
 
03:58:24.889 --> 03:58:24.899 align:start position:0%
portion of all state and local local
 
03:58:27.410 --> 03:58:27.420 align:start position:0%
includes property tax which changes that
 
03:58:30.590 --> 03:58:30.600 align:start position:0%
number significantly but the other stat
 
03:58:32.750 --> 03:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
we break it down what percent of state
 
03:58:35.450 --> 03:58:35.460 align:start position:0%
taxes come from business what percentage
 
03:58:37.370 --> 03:58:37.380 align:start position:0%
of local taxes come from businesses
 
03:58:40.370 --> 03:58:40.380 align:start position:0%
inclusion or exclusion of the local real
 
03:58:42.710 --> 03:58:42.720 align:start position:0%
property tax is the difference yeah yeah
 
03:58:43.870 --> 03:58:43.880 align:start position:0%
I mean
 
03:58:47.330 --> 03:58:47.340 align:start position:0%
absolutely and and since you're you may
 
03:58:49.070 --> 03:58:49.080 align:start position:0%
affect property tax policy but you're
 
03:58:50.929 --> 03:58:50.939 align:start position:0%
more concerned with raising state taxes
 
03:58:52.429 --> 03:58:52.439 align:start position:0%
that that's why I brought up that number
 
03:58:55.250 --> 03:58:55.260 align:start position:0%
was 62 percent versus just like 37 I
 
03:58:57.110 --> 03:58:57.120 align:start position:0%
mean you really raise a lot from
 
03:58:59.330 --> 03:58:59.340 align:start position:0%
business I'm not saying it's good or bad
 
03:59:01.309 --> 03:59:01.319 align:start position:0%
it's just the way your tax policies work
 
03:59:01.319 --> 03:59:02.530 align:start position:0%
it's just the way your tax policies work
out

03:59:02.530 --> 03:59:02.540 align:start position:0%
out
 
03:59:05.389 --> 03:59:05.399 align:start position:0%
so a further question just to clarify on
 
03:59:08.210 --> 03:59:08.220 align:start position:0%
the foreign dividend taxes as I
 
03:59:10.849 --> 03:59:10.859 align:start position:0%
understand and I'm not sure if it was
 
03:59:14.510 --> 03:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
tied this closely but you said that at
 
03:59:16.550 --> 03:59:16.560 align:start position:0%
the time that New Hampshire
 
03:59:21.110 --> 03:59:21.120 align:start position:0%
repealed the combined unitary reporting
 
03:59:24.710 --> 03:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
that's when we implemented the tax on
 
03:59:27.530 --> 03:59:27.540 align:start position:0%
foreign dividends were they tied yeah
 
03:59:29.809 --> 03:59:29.819 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I don't know if before 19
 
03:59:31.790 --> 03:59:31.800 align:start position:0%
well before 1981 you had probably had
 
03:59:33.530 --> 03:59:33.540 align:start position:0%
separate accounting so yeah at the time
 
03:59:37.130 --> 03:59:37.140 align:start position:0%
it happened and to New Hampshire's great
 
03:59:38.990 --> 03:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
credit at the time that the great Stan
 
03:59:41.750 --> 03:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
Arnold you know I remember your great
 
03:59:43.429 --> 03:59:43.439 align:start position:0%
commissioner who was you know beloved on
 
03:59:45.110 --> 03:59:45.120 align:start position:0%
both the private and the public side of
 
03:59:47.750 --> 03:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
it but he did he was one of the only two
 
03:59:50.389 --> 03:59:50.399 align:start position:0%
or three states that not you know as a
 
03:59:51.889 --> 03:59:51.899 align:start position:0%
legislature you decided to tax 100
 
03:59:53.269 --> 03:59:53.279 align:start position:0%
percent of foreign dividends which was
 
03:59:54.889 --> 03:59:54.899 align:start position:0%
what the federal government had been
 
03:59:58.309 --> 03:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
doing for like 90 years but you also
 
04:00:00.710 --> 04:00:00.720 align:start position:0%
then brought in all the factors you did
 
04:00:02.030 --> 04:00:02.040 align:start position:0%
it fairly you said okay we're going to
 
04:00:04.490 --> 04:00:04.500 align:start position:0%
tax 100 of global income when that
 
04:00:05.929 --> 04:00:05.939 align:start position:0%
income comes in we're going to allow
 
04:00:08.510 --> 04:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
those horn factors to come in
 
04:00:08.520 --> 04:00:09.110 align:start position:0%
those horn factors to come in
um

04:00:09.110 --> 04:00:09.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:11.090 --> 04:00:11.100 align:start position:0%
Professor hellerstein's wrote ridden
 
04:00:13.429 --> 04:00:13.439 align:start position:0%
extensively on that is the fair way
 
04:00:14.929 --> 04:00:14.939 align:start position:0%
bringing the income bringing the factors
 
04:00:17.389 --> 04:00:17.399 align:start position:0%
Most states didn't and continue not to
 
04:00:18.830 --> 04:00:18.840 align:start position:0%
do that they don't bring in all the
 
04:00:20.450 --> 04:00:20.460 align:start position:0%
factors so actually when you did it you
 
04:00:22.550 --> 04:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
thought it through better than most
 
04:00:24.710 --> 04:00:24.720 align:start position:0%
States and allowed you to bring in the
 
04:00:27.530 --> 04:00:27.540 align:start position:0%
income and bring in the factors so and
 
04:00:29.750 --> 04:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
so further to clarify when we say
 
04:00:31.969 --> 04:00:31.979 align:start position:0%
foreign dividends I'm not familiar with
 
04:00:35.410 --> 04:00:35.420 align:start position:0%
that provision in the tax code
 
04:00:38.510 --> 04:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
04:00:41.630 --> 04:00:41.640 align:start position:0%
it may include dividends received by
 
04:00:43.790 --> 04:00:43.800 align:start position:0%
individual shareholders who are private
 
04:00:46.130 --> 04:00:46.140 align:start position:0%
individuals but we're talking primarily
 
04:00:49.070 --> 04:00:49.080 align:start position:0%
about dividending between Affiliated
 
04:00:51.710 --> 04:00:51.720 align:start position:0%
corporate entities yeah so just to
 
04:00:53.889 --> 04:00:53.899 align:start position:0%
clarify so just give an example
 
04:00:56.630 --> 04:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
individual taxes are much different and
 
04:00:58.070 --> 04:00:58.080 align:start position:0%
you know so I'm not you know getting to
 
04:00:59.150 --> 04:00:59.160 align:start position:0%
that and I know you don't have a
 
04:01:01.729 --> 04:01:01.739 align:start position:0%
personal income tax but if you had 50
 
04:01:01.739 --> 04:01:03.429 align:start position:0%
personal income tax but if you had 50
U.S

04:01:03.429 --> 04:01:03.439 align:start position:0%
U.S
 
04:01:05.750 --> 04:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
subsidiaries for U.S parented company
 
04:01:08.450 --> 04:01:08.460 align:start position:0%
and 50 foreign ones foreign Dividends
 
04:01:11.090 --> 04:01:11.100 align:start position:0%
are simply all of the income earned by
 
04:01:13.610 --> 04:01:13.620 align:start position:0%
those foreign subsidiaries you don't tax
 
04:01:15.530 --> 04:01:15.540 align:start position:0%
it on a current basis and that now you
 
04:01:17.570 --> 04:01:17.580 align:start position:0%
and the Federal Government taxes a big
 
04:01:19.849 --> 04:01:19.859 align:start position:0%
chunk of it on under guilty but the rest
 
04:01:22.070 --> 04:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
of it you don't tax unless they send it
 
04:01:24.170 --> 04:01:24.180 align:start position:0%
back to the parent so it's getting
 
04:01:26.510 --> 04:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
rolled up dividended back so it means it
 
04:01:28.490 --> 04:01:28.500 align:start position:0%
eventually gets taxed there was a big
 
04:01:30.229 --> 04:01:30.239 align:start position:0%
problem internationally which is one of
 
04:01:31.670 --> 04:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
the reasons the U.S changed it because
 
04:01:33.710 --> 04:01:33.720 align:start position:0%
three trillion dollars was sitting there
 
04:01:35.090 --> 04:01:35.100 align:start position:0%
because what was the incentive to bring
 
04:01:37.070 --> 04:01:37.080 align:start position:0%
it back all I was pointing out was for
 
04:01:38.929 --> 04:01:38.939 align:start position:0%
the handful of states that do still tax
 
04:01:41.210 --> 04:01:41.220 align:start position:0%
dividends probably much less of a
 
04:01:43.370 --> 04:01:43.380 align:start position:0%
disincentive to bring it back now so
 
04:01:44.750 --> 04:01:44.760 align:start position:0%
you're probably getting more money from
 
04:01:46.910 --> 04:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
it because you're not getting federally
 
04:01:48.290 --> 04:01:48.300 align:start position:0%
taxed on anymore because the federal
 
04:01:50.389 --> 04:01:50.399 align:start position:0%
government got rid of that tax phased it
 
04:01:52.309 --> 04:01:52.319 align:start position:0%
out no longer a reason to just pack it
 
04:01:54.290 --> 04:01:54.300 align:start position:0%
in a foreign country correct and so that
 
04:01:55.790 --> 04:01:55.800 align:start position:0%
even though that might not have brought
 
04:01:59.050 --> 04:01:59.060 align:start position:0%
you in as much money between 86 and
 
04:02:06.170 --> 04:02:06.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:08.170 --> 04:02:08.180 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
04:02:10.610 --> 04:02:10.620 align:start position:0%
all right thank you representative
 
04:02:14.090 --> 04:02:14.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:15.530 --> 04:02:15.540 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:02:18.110 --> 04:02:18.120 align:start position:0%
Mr frieden and I have crossed paths
 
04:02:21.650 --> 04:02:21.660 align:start position:0%
before and here back in 2020 and
 
04:02:25.130 --> 04:02:25.140 align:start position:0%
February and uh
 
04:02:27.769 --> 04:02:27.779 align:start position:0%
I hope it was amicable but yeah well
 
04:02:27.779 --> 04:02:29.210 align:start position:0%
I hope it was amicable but yeah well
we've

04:02:29.210 --> 04:02:29.220 align:start position:0%
we've
 
04:02:31.370 --> 04:02:31.380 align:start position:0%
I pulled out some papers that I had from
 
04:02:33.110 --> 04:02:33.120 align:start position:0%
back then but
 
04:02:36.830 --> 04:02:36.840 align:start position:0%
my new questions now good you mentioned
 
04:02:36.840 --> 04:02:37.550 align:start position:0%
my new questions now good you mentioned
that

04:02:37.550 --> 04:02:37.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:02:40.370 --> 04:02:40.380 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire businesses
 
04:02:40.380 --> 04:02:43.130 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire businesses
multinationals

04:02:43.130 --> 04:02:43.140 align:start position:0%
multinationals
 
04:02:45.349 --> 04:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
are really paying more than their fair
 
04:02:46.969 --> 04:02:46.979 align:start position:0%
share but
 
04:02:49.429 --> 04:02:49.439 align:start position:0%
are there businesses in New Hampshire
 
04:02:53.750 --> 04:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
that profit shift to reduce liability
 
04:02:56.210 --> 04:02:56.220 align:start position:0%
here in this state
 
04:02:59.090 --> 04:02:59.100 align:start position:0%
well my point was and I don't know if I
 
04:03:00.710 --> 04:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
said penguin for sure I was just
 
04:03:02.990 --> 04:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
comparing you to other states so it's
 
04:03:04.729 --> 04:03:04.739 align:start position:0%
you know someone could they can decide
 
04:03:08.570 --> 04:03:08.580 align:start position:0%
or not but the point I was making was it
 
04:03:10.729 --> 04:03:10.739 align:start position:0%
certainly profits everything exists as
 
04:03:12.469 --> 04:03:12.479 align:start position:0%
you heard from other speakers certainly
 
04:03:13.910 --> 04:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
the whole world has recognized it
 
04:03:15.769 --> 04:03:15.779 align:start position:0%
there's a big debate as to how much but
 
04:03:18.590 --> 04:03:18.600 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean it doesn't exist but
 
04:03:21.769 --> 04:03:21.779 align:start position:0%
the solution to profit shifting
 
04:03:24.769 --> 04:03:24.779 align:start position:0%
being proposed is to bring the foreign
 
04:03:26.990 --> 04:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
Source income into the base one way to
 
04:03:29.809 --> 04:03:29.819 align:start position:0%
do that is being proposed which is a you
 
04:03:32.290 --> 04:03:32.300 align:start position:0%
know we we think overly complicated and
 
04:03:34.670 --> 04:03:34.680 align:start position:0%
different than anyone else does which is
 
04:03:36.830 --> 04:03:36.840 align:start position:0%
worldwide combined reporting another way
 
04:03:38.450 --> 04:03:38.460 align:start position:0%
to bring it in whether it's profit
 
04:03:39.889 --> 04:03:39.899 align:start position:0%
shifting or not but when you bring in
 
04:03:41.210 --> 04:03:41.220 align:start position:0%
guilty when you bring in foreign
 
04:03:43.010 --> 04:03:43.020 align:start position:0%
dividends you're bringing in the profit
 
04:03:44.510 --> 04:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
shifted foreign income the non-profit
 
04:03:45.650 --> 04:03:45.660 align:start position:0%
children you're bringing in all the
 
04:03:48.410 --> 04:03:48.420 align:start position:0%
global income or most of it and so it's
 
04:03:50.090 --> 04:03:50.100 align:start position:0%
sort of one in the same if you were to
 
04:03:53.150 --> 04:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
say to me that there's some you know
 
04:03:55.849 --> 04:03:55.859 align:start position:0%
there's five multinationals in New
 
04:03:57.229 --> 04:03:57.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and three of them are profit
 
04:03:59.750 --> 04:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
shifting and two of them aren't when you
 
04:04:01.309 --> 04:04:01.319 align:start position:0%
tax their foreign Source income you
 
04:04:02.630 --> 04:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
don't really distinguish guilty
 
04:04:04.490 --> 04:04:04.500 align:start position:0%
distinguishes a little foreign dividends
 
04:04:05.929 --> 04:04:05.939 align:start position:0%
doesn't distinguish at all right it's
 
04:04:08.889 --> 04:04:08.899 align:start position:0%
just bringing in all of the money earned
 
04:04:13.490 --> 04:04:13.500 align:start position:0%
abroad eventually and that's whether it
 
04:04:15.469 --> 04:04:15.479 align:start position:0%
was low taxed High tax whatever you're
 
04:04:17.689 --> 04:04:17.699 align:start position:0%
not really making a distinction between
 
04:04:19.550 --> 04:04:19.560 align:start position:0%
those I mean guilty tries to make a
 
04:04:21.710 --> 04:04:21.720 align:start position:0%
distinction very imperfectly foreign
 
04:04:23.210 --> 04:04:23.220 align:start position:0%
dividends doesn't make a distinction
 
04:04:25.729 --> 04:04:25.739 align:start position:0%
right so
 
04:04:27.410 --> 04:04:27.420 align:start position:0%
does that does it answer your question
 
04:04:27.420 --> 04:04:29.050 align:start position:0%
does that does it answer your question
yeah

04:04:29.050 --> 04:04:29.060 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:04:29.060 --> 04:04:30.710 align:start position:0%
yeah
financer

04:04:30.710 --> 04:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
financer
 
04:04:33.889 --> 04:04:33.899 align:start position:0%
uh I had another question here
 
04:04:36.950 --> 04:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
do you have historically do you remember
 
04:04:39.590 --> 04:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
because you and I were both young way
 
04:04:42.590 --> 04:04:42.600 align:start position:0%
back in this time period in 2020. well
 
04:04:45.849 --> 04:04:45.859 align:start position:0%
I'm going back to 1984 right now
 
04:04:48.110 --> 04:04:48.120 align:start position:0%
do you have any idea why it was so
 
04:04:52.010 --> 04:04:52.020 align:start position:0%
important 1984 or 8586 to change
 
04:04:54.349 --> 04:04:54.359 align:start position:0%
from our
 
04:04:57.729 --> 04:04:57.739 align:start position:0%
worldwide combined reporting slash
 
04:05:02.269 --> 04:05:02.279 align:start position:0%
uh unitary methods that we had then to
 
04:05:05.389 --> 04:05:05.399 align:start position:0%
go to Water's Edge any anything
 
04:05:07.969 --> 04:05:07.979 align:start position:0%
Insight that you can give us well I do
 
04:05:10.729 --> 04:05:10.739 align:start position:0%
remember in 84 and 86 the Celtics won
 
04:05:12.349 --> 04:05:12.359 align:start position:0%
the title right those are those are
 
04:05:14.570 --> 04:05:14.580 align:start position:0%
important the years for Larry Bird as
 
04:05:16.969 --> 04:05:16.979 align:start position:0%
well as 81 as well as 81.
 
04:05:18.650 --> 04:05:18.660 align:start position:0%
and I could give you all their numbers
 
04:05:19.849 --> 04:05:19.859 align:start position:0%
too but
 
04:05:21.590 --> 04:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
um no I mean there's just been a lot
 
04:05:23.990 --> 04:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
written on that topic I mean clearly
 
04:05:25.790 --> 04:05:25.800 align:start position:0%
there was a Supreme Court decision that
 
04:05:28.309 --> 04:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
said you could do it and then there was
 
04:05:30.349 --> 04:05:30.359 align:start position:0%
both some foreign countries many many it
 
04:05:32.210 --> 04:05:32.220 align:start position:0%
wasn't just a banner UK that were upset
 
04:05:34.150 --> 04:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
with that and then there was a Reagan
 
04:05:37.429 --> 04:05:37.439 align:start position:0%
Reagan presidency who through the
 
04:05:39.050 --> 04:05:39.060 align:start position:0%
secretary Reagan had a commission and
 
04:05:40.550 --> 04:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
the commission came up with conclusions
 
04:05:42.590 --> 04:05:42.600 align:start position:0%
that said you shouldn't do Water's Edge
 
04:05:44.450 --> 04:05:44.460 align:start position:0%
and even backed it up a little bit by
 
04:05:46.610 --> 04:05:46.620 align:start position:0%
saying that if you don't voluntarily
 
04:05:48.349 --> 04:05:48.359 align:start position:0%
move away we'll consider Federal
 
04:05:50.630 --> 04:05:50.640 align:start position:0%
legislation to do it so that was sort of
 
04:05:52.250 --> 04:05:52.260 align:start position:0%
it's been well written about that that
 
04:05:54.229 --> 04:05:54.239 align:start position:0%
was the sequence of events that occurred
 
04:05:55.670 --> 04:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
at that time
 
04:05:58.550 --> 04:05:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh well in your comment that they would
 
04:06:00.729 --> 04:06:00.739 align:start position:0%
have done Federal legislation I think
 
04:06:03.410 --> 04:06:03.420 align:start position:0%
Professor hellerstein might disagree
 
04:06:05.809 --> 04:06:05.819 align:start position:0%
with that that New Hampshire can set its
 
04:06:07.910 --> 04:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
own tax policies
 
04:06:10.490 --> 04:06:10.500 align:start position:0%
various things well you know the states
 
04:06:12.170 --> 04:06:12.180 align:start position:0%
have the states have right but the
 
04:06:13.790 --> 04:06:13.800 align:start position:0%
federal government has I'm not saying
 
04:06:15.229 --> 04:06:15.239 align:start position:0%
they would ever should have but they
 
04:06:16.610 --> 04:06:16.620 align:start position:0%
have the right under the Commerce Clause
 
04:06:18.530 --> 04:06:18.540 align:start position:0%
not the negative Commerce Clause but the
 
04:06:20.689 --> 04:06:20.699 align:start position:0%
positive Commerce Clause to decide that
 
04:06:22.610 --> 04:06:22.620 align:start position:0%
something is a violation of Commerce if
 
04:06:24.889 --> 04:06:24.899 align:start position:0%
and they could decide that that was a
 
04:06:26.990 --> 04:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
violation of Commerce to do it but they
 
04:06:29.210 --> 04:06:29.220 align:start position:0%
didn't but they could have
 
04:06:29.220 --> 04:06:31.849 align:start position:0%
didn't but they could have
uh

04:06:31.849 --> 04:06:31.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:33.710 --> 04:06:33.720 align:start position:0%
Professor hellerstein make a comment
 
04:06:35.570 --> 04:06:35.580 align:start position:0%
he's back he's he's been itching he's
 
04:06:39.050 --> 04:06:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:39.060 --> 04:06:43.849 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:06:43.849 --> 04:06:43.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:46.010 --> 04:06:46.020 align:start position:0%
I can't resist this it's neither neither
 
04:06:48.469 --> 04:06:48.479 align:start position:0%
good nor bad but I just think we all
 
04:06:50.870 --> 04:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
there's something when you I if if
 
04:06:50.880 --> 04:06:52.429 align:start position:0%
there's something when you I if if
tomorrow

04:06:52.429 --> 04:06:52.439 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
04:06:55.790 --> 04:06:55.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire decides to have an income
 
04:06:55.800 --> 04:06:56.870 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire decides to have an income
tax

04:06:56.870 --> 04:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
tax
 
04:06:56.880 --> 04:06:58.010 align:start position:0%
tax
with

04:06:58.010 --> 04:06:58.020 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:06:59.809 --> 04:06:59.819 align:start position:0%
one factor
 
04:07:01.910 --> 04:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
two factors three factors that's up to
 
04:07:03.309 --> 04:07:03.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
04:07:06.349 --> 04:07:06.359 align:start position:0%
and the only test as to whether or not I
 
04:07:07.670 --> 04:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
don't think I like this I'm just telling
 
04:07:08.750 --> 04:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
you this is
 
04:07:11.030 --> 04:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
ought to be on the table is whether it
 
04:07:13.610 --> 04:07:13.620 align:start position:0%
is internally consistent in other words
 
04:07:17.150 --> 04:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
the test for the validity of a a new
 
04:07:20.450 --> 04:07:20.460 align:start position:0%
formula a new is if every state did what
 
04:07:23.689 --> 04:07:23.699 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is doing not that they do
 
04:07:25.910 --> 04:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
would it result in double taxation if
 
04:07:28.010 --> 04:07:28.020 align:start position:0%
the answer is no it's okay by contrast
 
04:07:29.450 --> 04:07:29.460 align:start position:0%
when you think about it and this is
 
04:07:31.010 --> 04:07:31.020 align:start position:0%
terrible I think not terrible is not
 
04:07:34.849 --> 04:07:34.859 align:start position:0%
good I mean uh for many years Iowa
 
04:07:36.590 --> 04:07:36.600 align:start position:0%
every state had three factors it makes
 
04:07:38.870 --> 04:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
sense what produces income right Capital
 
04:07:42.769 --> 04:07:42.779 align:start position:0%
they told us way back then and labor
 
04:07:45.170 --> 04:07:45.180 align:start position:0%
and sales that's okay Market
 
04:07:47.510 --> 04:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
and then Iowa decided Well you know we
 
04:07:49.550 --> 04:07:49.560 align:start position:0%
think it's just sales
 
04:07:51.170 --> 04:07:51.180 align:start position:0%
how can you do that you don't count
 
04:07:53.330 --> 04:07:53.340 align:start position:0%
Capital you don't count labor the U.S
 
04:07:56.330 --> 04:07:56.340 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court said you know
 
04:07:58.550 --> 04:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
it's okay they basically say
 
04:07:59.870 --> 04:07:59.880 align:start position:0%
there still is the question as to
 
04:08:01.910 --> 04:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
whether or not Iowa may have taxed too
 
04:08:03.410 --> 04:08:03.420 align:start position:0%
much but I'm just saying when you
 
04:08:06.769 --> 04:08:06.779 align:start position:0%
evaluate this there's in effect the
 
04:08:08.689 --> 04:08:08.699 align:start position:0%
general constitutional test is just
 
04:08:11.630 --> 04:08:11.640 align:start position:0%
whether if everybody else did it
 
04:08:14.330 --> 04:08:14.340 align:start position:0%
would it hurt cross-border taxation if
 
04:08:15.889 --> 04:08:15.899 align:start position:0%
the answer is no
 
04:08:19.250 --> 04:08:19.260 align:start position:0%
uh then that means the basic approach is
 
04:08:21.110 --> 04:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
okay then you still have what keeps us
 
04:08:22.910 --> 04:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
in business people building better it
 
04:08:24.229 --> 04:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
turns out that when you look at the
 
04:08:26.150 --> 04:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
actual facts of the case when Iowa
 
04:08:29.210 --> 04:08:29.220 align:start position:0%
assigns all of the income of General
 
04:08:31.910 --> 04:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
Motors just on the number of the cars
 
04:08:33.469 --> 04:08:33.479 align:start position:0%
that were purchased in Iowa that's
 
04:08:35.269 --> 04:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
disproportionate so I just think that
 
04:08:37.130 --> 04:08:37.140 align:start position:0%
ought to be something you consider when
 
04:08:39.229 --> 04:08:39.239 align:start position:0%
you're thinking about this issue that
 
04:08:41.809 --> 04:08:41.819 align:start position:0%
what may be bad in application may not
 
04:08:43.309 --> 04:08:43.319 align:start position:0%
be bad in terms of anybody thinking
 
04:08:45.110 --> 04:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
about is this
 
04:08:49.130 --> 04:08:49.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:51.229 --> 04:08:51.239 align:start position:0%
okay is there anything that you'd like
 
04:08:53.510 --> 04:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
to add well no just I mean you know ice
 
04:08:55.910 --> 04:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
my first part of my discussion or
 
04:08:58.189 --> 04:08:58.199 align:start position:0%
dialogue was just this is constitutional
 
04:08:59.689 --> 04:08:59.699 align:start position:0%
that's different from whether it's good
 
04:09:01.490 --> 04:09:01.500 align:start position:0%
tax policy for New Hampshire and that's
 
04:09:04.010 --> 04:09:04.020 align:start position:0%
kind of what I focused on I think more
 
04:09:05.510 --> 04:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
than most of the speakers who were kind
 
04:09:07.550 --> 04:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
of more generically talking about this
 
04:09:09.170 --> 04:09:09.180 align:start position:0%
is good tax policy I mean I think you
 
04:09:11.630 --> 04:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
have to look at it not just is this you
 
04:09:13.429 --> 04:09:13.439 align:start position:0%
know generically good tax policy for all
 
04:09:16.010 --> 04:09:16.020 align:start position:0%
states but is it good tax policy for New
 
04:09:18.769 --> 04:09:18.779 align:start position:0%
Hampshire given that you at least in my
 
04:09:21.290 --> 04:09:21.300 align:start position:0%
mind have already largely maybe more
 
04:09:22.610 --> 04:09:22.620 align:start position:0%
than you should have but largely
 
04:09:24.590 --> 04:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
addressed this issue already in terms of
 
04:09:26.030 --> 04:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
foreign Source income being in your
 
04:09:28.910 --> 04:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
income tax base I would just add a
 
04:09:30.530 --> 04:09:30.540 align:start position:0%
further comment on the Constitutional
 
04:09:32.510 --> 04:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
issues so
 
04:09:35.510 --> 04:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
the question of the Commerce Clause has
 
04:09:38.150 --> 04:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
been litigated in these cases and the
 
04:09:39.830 --> 04:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court has blessed what the
 
04:09:41.510 --> 04:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
states were doing given them latitude
 
04:09:43.729 --> 04:09:43.739 align:start position:0%
fair and reasonable
 
04:09:46.309 --> 04:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
the thing that it's never really cropped
 
04:09:49.130 --> 04:09:49.140 align:start position:0%
up but seemed threatening at various
 
04:09:51.290 --> 04:09:51.300 align:start position:0%
junctures was whether the federal
 
04:09:54.050 --> 04:09:54.060 align:start position:0%
Congress would act because of the
 
04:09:57.590 --> 04:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
federal if the federal Congress did
 
04:09:57.600 --> 04:09:58.250 align:start position:0%
federal if the federal Congress did
um

04:09:58.250 --> 04:09:58.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:59.929 --> 04:09:59.939 align:start position:0%
take the step
 
04:10:03.410 --> 04:10:03.420 align:start position:0%
of regulating this area and dictating a
 
04:10:05.750 --> 04:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
particular system that would probably
 
04:10:08.210 --> 04:10:08.220 align:start position:0%
constitute preemption
 
04:10:11.090 --> 04:10:11.100 align:start position:0%
and what I recall of the period of 1983
 
04:10:14.750 --> 04:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
to 86 is that Congress was being urged
 
04:10:18.469 --> 04:10:18.479 align:start position:0%
to act and never took the bait
 
04:10:21.950 --> 04:10:21.960 align:start position:0%
so that just further amplifies that it's
 
04:10:24.590 --> 04:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
a matter of public policy the states are
 
04:10:27.229 --> 04:10:27.239 align:start position:0%
free to do it and Congress has resisted
 
04:10:30.650 --> 04:10:30.660 align:start position:0%
the temptation to Tire hands
 
04:10:34.010 --> 04:10:34.020 align:start position:0%
and I I mean no part of my discussion
 
04:10:35.990 --> 04:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
did I suggest that Congress would step
 
04:10:37.910 --> 04:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
in now or in the times have changed a
 
04:10:40.070 --> 04:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
lot States could certainly
 
04:10:42.830 --> 04:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
do this the question is is it a
 
04:10:46.670 --> 04:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
good idea or not to do it I think that's
 
04:10:47.929 --> 04:10:47.939 align:start position:0%
what we're all you know and I think
 
04:10:49.849 --> 04:10:49.859 align:start position:0%
you've had a terrific discussion on that
 
04:10:49.859 --> 04:10:51.050 align:start position:0%
you've had a terrific discussion on that
today

04:10:51.050 --> 04:10:51.060 align:start position:0%
today
 
04:10:53.870 --> 04:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
well we have and thank you and I had one
 
04:10:56.689 --> 04:10:56.699 align:start position:0%
more oh one more okay I still have the
 
04:11:01.490 --> 04:11:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:01.500 --> 04:11:02.990 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:11:02.990 --> 04:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:11:05.030 --> 04:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
when you were here we talked uh Jason
 
04:11:08.389 --> 04:11:08.399 align:start position:0%
Furman was the professor at uh
 
04:11:10.429 --> 04:11:10.439 align:start position:0%
practice of economic policy at Harvard
 
04:11:14.510 --> 04:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:17.990 --> 04:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
presentation to uh Congress
 
04:11:20.389 --> 04:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
the corporate tax collections are very
 
04:11:22.429 --> 04:11:22.439 align:start position:0%
low in historical perspective and
 
04:11:24.229 --> 04:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
compared with other countries
 
04:11:27.290 --> 04:11:27.300 align:start position:0%
this contributes to overall low level of
 
04:11:27.300 --> 04:11:28.550 align:start position:0%
this contributes to overall low level of
Revenue

04:11:28.550 --> 04:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
04:11:28.560 --> 04:11:30.170 align:start position:0%
Revenue
and

04:11:30.170 --> 04:11:30.180 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:11:32.330 --> 04:11:32.340 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned like with people like Mr
 
04:11:35.090 --> 04:11:35.100 align:start position:0%
Collins over here the private domestic
 
04:11:35.100 --> 04:11:36.769 align:start position:0%
Collins over here the private domestic
company

04:11:36.769 --> 04:11:36.779 align:start position:0%
company
 
04:11:36.779 --> 04:11:38.630 align:start position:0%
company
that

04:11:38.630 --> 04:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:11:40.670 --> 04:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
in this country we have no privileged
 
04:11:45.170 --> 04:11:45.180 align:start position:0%
class either citizens or business
 
04:11:45.180 --> 04:11:48.229 align:start position:0%
class either citizens or business
Arrangements

04:11:48.229 --> 04:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:50.330 --> 04:11:50.340 align:start position:0%
do you feel that
 
04:11:52.969 --> 04:11:52.979 align:start position:0%
this bill is structured it really opens
 
04:11:55.490 --> 04:11:55.500 align:start position:0%
up and my feeling to fairness and
 
04:11:59.150 --> 04:11:59.160 align:start position:0%
equality to all everywhere
 
04:12:01.849 --> 04:12:01.859 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire business structures
 
04:12:06.950 --> 04:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
or if this bill fails in this Commission
 
04:12:09.710 --> 04:12:09.720 align:start position:0%
does it give continued power to a
 
04:12:12.010 --> 04:12:12.020 align:start position:0%
privileged class of businesses
 
04:12:15.410 --> 04:12:15.420 align:start position:0%
multinationals uh over our domestic
 
04:12:15.420 --> 04:12:17.330 align:start position:0%
multinationals uh over our domestic
businesses

04:12:17.330 --> 04:12:17.340 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
04:12:20.210 --> 04:12:20.220 align:start position:0%
just I mean I'm impressed you had notes
 
04:12:21.769 --> 04:12:21.779 align:start position:0%
from that I'll be careful what I say to
 
04:12:23.469 --> 04:12:23.479 align:start position:0%
you in the future
 
04:12:27.710 --> 04:12:27.720 align:start position:0%
2020 whenever it was no I mean I think
 
04:12:29.450 --> 04:12:29.460 align:start position:0%
you know I'm I'm
 
04:12:32.450 --> 04:12:32.460 align:start position:0%
looking at this from the purpose of this
 
04:12:34.309 --> 04:12:34.319 align:start position:0%
commission which is determining whether
 
04:12:36.950 --> 04:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire should do this or not and
 
04:12:39.349 --> 04:12:39.359 align:start position:0%
I don't think everyone's looking to New
 
04:12:41.570 --> 04:12:41.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as the beacon of if they go
 
04:12:43.010 --> 04:12:43.020 align:start position:0%
this way or that way it will change
 
04:12:44.809 --> 04:12:44.819 align:start position:0%
everything so I can't answer your
 
04:12:46.910 --> 04:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
broader question but I do think it's
 
04:12:48.950 --> 04:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
really important and that was if
 
04:12:50.870 --> 04:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
anything that was my major point in my
 
04:12:52.670 --> 04:12:52.680 align:start position:0%
presentation with my first substantive
 
04:12:55.189 --> 04:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
slide second slide in there is that all
 
04:12:56.929 --> 04:12:56.939 align:start position:0%
that you're doing with Worldwide and
 
04:13:00.050 --> 04:13:00.060 align:start position:0%
it's a lot is bringing is suggesting
 
04:13:01.610 --> 04:13:01.620 align:start position:0%
that you can't determine how much is
 
04:13:03.170 --> 04:13:03.180 align:start position:0%
earned in New Hampshire unless you bring
 
04:13:04.670 --> 04:13:04.680 align:start position:0%
in the global income and the global
 
04:13:06.229 --> 04:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
factors of a company that's all
 
04:13:07.849 --> 04:13:07.859 align:start position:0%
worldwide does right you take away the
 
04:13:09.769 --> 04:13:09.779 align:start position:0%
fancy name whereas with Water's Edge
 
04:13:11.450 --> 04:13:11.460 align:start position:0%
you're just looking at all the income in
 
04:13:14.229 --> 04:13:14.239 align:start position:0%
the U.S by the U.S subsidiaries
 
04:13:18.050 --> 04:13:18.060 align:start position:0%
and if you are doing that already you're
 
04:13:20.210 --> 04:13:20.220 align:start position:0%
largely it's not 100 match but if you're
 
04:13:21.769 --> 04:13:21.779 align:start position:0%
largely doing that already in a
 
04:13:23.389 --> 04:13:23.399 align:start position:0%
different way
 
04:13:26.870 --> 04:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
by you know with your taxation of guilty
 
04:13:29.389 --> 04:13:29.399 align:start position:0%
subpart F and foreign dividends
 
04:13:31.550 --> 04:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
you know for me that puts the whole
 
04:13:33.710 --> 04:13:33.720 align:start position:0%
question of profit shifting to the side
 
04:13:35.630 --> 04:13:35.640 align:start position:0%
how much it is is it you know because
 
04:13:37.729 --> 04:13:37.739 align:start position:0%
you're already addressing the issue in a
 
04:13:38.929 --> 04:13:38.939 align:start position:0%
different way and so the choice New
 
04:13:40.790 --> 04:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is even though you're
 
04:13:43.250 --> 04:13:43.260 align:start position:0%
addressing it in bringing in more
 
04:13:43.260 --> 04:13:46.929 align:start position:0%
addressing it in bringing in more
foreign

04:13:46.929 --> 04:13:46.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:49.490 --> 04:13:49.500 align:start position:0%
the federal government but perhaps the
 
04:13:51.110 --> 04:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
way even other countries are thinking
 
04:13:52.910 --> 04:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
about doing under pillar too
 
04:13:54.889 --> 04:13:54.899 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit different but arguably
 
04:13:56.510 --> 04:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
you're you're bringing in more foreign
 
04:13:57.889 --> 04:13:57.899 align:start position:0%
Source income than they're even thinking
 
04:13:58.790 --> 04:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
of doing
 
04:14:01.670 --> 04:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
do you need to go some other methodology
 
04:14:03.349 --> 04:14:03.359 align:start position:0%
to do it now it might be a different
 
04:14:04.550 --> 04:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
question I'm sure we'll have different
 
04:14:06.170 --> 04:14:06.180 align:start position:0%
debates in lots of other states but
 
04:14:10.910 --> 04:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:13.370 --> 04:14:13.380 align:start position:0%
okay thank you second one clarification
 
04:14:16.610 --> 04:14:16.620 align:start position:0%
so therefore it's fair to impute that
 
04:14:19.910 --> 04:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
you believe that if New Hampshire was to
 
04:14:19.920 --> 04:14:21.070 align:start position:0%
you believe that if New Hampshire was to
implement

04:14:21.070 --> 04:14:21.080 align:start position:0%
implement
 
04:14:24.830 --> 04:14:24.840 align:start position:0%
unitary combined reporting then it would
 
04:14:26.990 --> 04:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
be appropriate at that time
 
04:14:29.510 --> 04:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
to do away with the taxation foreign
 
04:14:31.610 --> 04:14:31.620 align:start position:0%
dividends and guilty well you'd have to
 
04:14:33.290 --> 04:14:33.300 align:start position:0%
I mean not just appropriate it would be
 
04:14:35.330 --> 04:14:35.340 align:start position:0%
double taxation if you didn't yeah you'd
 
04:14:37.309 --> 04:14:37.319 align:start position:0%
have to deal away with them and and you
 
04:14:38.870 --> 04:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
know we're you know it's just like the
 
04:14:40.969 --> 04:14:40.979 align:start position:0%
US has credits for you know to make sure
 
04:14:42.950 --> 04:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
they don't double tax stuff but yeah you
 
04:14:44.210 --> 04:14:44.220 align:start position:0%
couldn't do
 
04:14:47.689 --> 04:14:47.699 align:start position:0%
both and you know my point among other
 
04:14:51.050 --> 04:14:51.060 align:start position:0%
points was to switch not only is more
 
04:14:53.269 --> 04:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
administratively complex but there are
 
04:14:55.250 --> 04:14:55.260 align:start position:0%
consequences to do something that nobody
 
04:14:58.510 --> 04:14:58.520 align:start position:0%
else is doing you know both you know
 
04:15:01.910 --> 04:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
Optics of it and and the you know the
 
04:15:03.410 --> 04:15:03.420 align:start position:0%
the breadth of what you're trying to do
 
04:15:05.990 --> 04:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
as well as the complexity so personally
 
04:15:07.250 --> 04:15:07.260 align:start position:0%
I'm saying you shouldn't go in that
 
04:15:09.349 --> 04:15:09.359 align:start position:0%
direction exactly as I understood you
 
04:15:12.590 --> 04:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
then thank you thank you
 
04:15:12.600 --> 04:15:14.570 align:start position:0%
then thank you thank you
okay

04:15:14.570 --> 04:15:14.580 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:15:14.580 --> 04:15:15.950 align:start position:0%
okay
um

04:15:15.950 --> 04:15:15.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:19.969 --> 04:15:19.979 align:start position:0%
so that brings us to our last presenters
 
04:15:24.229 --> 04:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
um and uh I'm we're calling forward Fred
 
04:15:27.110 --> 04:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
cool broth director of audit division at
 
04:15:30.769 --> 04:15:30.779 align:start position:0%
dra and Kian Wong one of our members who
 
04:15:33.229 --> 04:15:33.239 align:start position:0%
of course is tax policy council at the
 
04:15:33.239 --> 04:15:34.309 align:start position:0%
of course is tax policy council at the
dra

04:15:34.309 --> 04:15:34.319 align:start position:0%
dra
 
04:15:38.929 --> 04:15:38.939 align:start position:0%
and um I think this has been a very
 
04:15:38.939 --> 04:15:40.510 align:start position:0%
and um I think this has been a very
balanced

04:15:40.510 --> 04:15:40.520 align:start position:0%
balanced
 
04:15:44.090 --> 04:15:44.100 align:start position:0%
agenda and I'm extremely pleased with
 
04:15:46.990 --> 04:15:47.000 align:start position:0%
the fact that we've had you know robust
 
04:15:49.729 --> 04:15:49.739 align:start position:0%
proponents and opponents and and good
 
04:15:49.739 --> 04:15:50.870 align:start position:0%
proponents and opponents and and good
reasons

04:15:50.870 --> 04:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
04:15:53.210 --> 04:15:53.220 align:start position:0%
the question that I think we really want
 
04:15:55.670 --> 04:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
to focus on now with the dra is as a
 
04:15:58.010 --> 04:15:58.020 align:start position:0%
practical matter if we assume that we
 
04:16:02.030 --> 04:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
actually enact this program for example
 
04:16:06.170 --> 04:16:06.180 align:start position:0%
on representative Schamberg's hb121
 
04:16:08.990 --> 04:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
what would you be dealing with
 
04:16:14.889 --> 04:16:14.899 align:start position:0%
in terms of forms filings audits
 
04:16:18.050 --> 04:16:18.060 align:start position:0%
enforcement and the like
 
04:16:21.889 --> 04:16:21.899 align:start position:0%
so take it away sure and as you said
 
04:16:24.349 --> 04:16:24.359 align:start position:0%
this is Fred cool broth director of
 
04:16:26.809 --> 04:16:26.819 align:start position:0%
audit with my colleague King Wong
 
04:16:30.650 --> 04:16:30.660 align:start position:0%
text YC Council the dra before we start
 
04:16:33.050 --> 04:16:33.060 align:start position:0%
we just want to state that the dra does
 
04:16:36.170 --> 04:16:36.180 align:start position:0%
not have a position on this we take the
 
04:16:37.550 --> 04:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
easy Road out
 
04:16:41.570 --> 04:16:41.580 align:start position:0%
and um thanks everybody for bearing with
 
04:16:43.429 --> 04:16:43.439 align:start position:0%
us here I know we've technically we're
 
04:16:44.630 --> 04:16:44.640 align:start position:0%
in at like negative two minutes
 
04:16:47.150 --> 04:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
according to the agenda so apologies for
 
04:16:50.689 --> 04:16:50.699 align:start position:0%
that and uh I just want to say as a as a
 
04:16:52.790 --> 04:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
student of tax and a self-professed tax
 
04:16:54.889 --> 04:16:54.899 align:start position:0%
nerd this has just been a pleasure for
 
04:16:56.630 --> 04:16:56.640 align:start position:0%
just speaking for myself this has been a
 
04:16:58.670 --> 04:16:58.680 align:start position:0%
pleasure I'm sure for Keen as well just
 
04:17:01.010 --> 04:17:01.020 align:start position:0%
to hear all these experts who are a lot
 
04:17:03.050 --> 04:17:03.060 align:start position:0%
smarter than me talk about these topics
 
04:17:04.670 --> 04:17:04.680 align:start position:0%
it's believe it or not this is fun for
 
04:17:06.889 --> 04:17:06.899 align:start position:0%
me it's why I'm in the world of tax so
 
04:17:07.910 --> 04:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
this has been a pleasure and I
 
04:17:09.590 --> 04:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate the commission's time and
 
04:17:11.330 --> 04:17:11.340 align:start position:0%
given us an opportunity an opportunity
 
04:17:12.950 --> 04:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
to chat here
 
04:17:15.170 --> 04:17:15.180 align:start position:0%
um we can certainly
 
04:17:17.210 --> 04:17:17.220 align:start position:0%
um talk through the the Practical
 
04:17:20.269 --> 04:17:20.279 align:start position:0%
implications for Dra here and but we
 
04:17:21.889 --> 04:17:21.899 align:start position:0%
could also get a little bit into the
 
04:17:23.269 --> 04:17:23.279 align:start position:0%
substance as well but I think everyone
 
04:17:25.309 --> 04:17:25.319 align:start position:0%
did a really good job with that already
 
04:17:27.410 --> 04:17:27.420 align:start position:0%
so we could sort of play that by year
 
04:17:29.330 --> 04:17:29.340 align:start position:0%
and see what the commission's appetite
 
04:17:31.550 --> 04:17:31.560 align:start position:0%
and what the time allows for
 
04:17:34.250 --> 04:17:34.260 align:start position:0%
to to your point chairman
 
04:17:34.260 --> 04:17:35.210 align:start position:0%
to to your point chairman
um

04:17:35.210 --> 04:17:35.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:37.130 --> 04:17:37.140 align:start position:0%
as a practical matter there would just
 
04:17:40.070 --> 04:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
be more of everything I like to say
 
04:17:43.250 --> 04:17:43.260 align:start position:0%
um the there certainly would be more
 
04:17:46.729 --> 04:17:46.739 align:start position:0%
demand placed onto the uh our so-called
 
04:17:50.450 --> 04:17:50.460 align:start position:0%
front-end operations so the
 
04:17:50.460 --> 04:17:51.050 align:start position:0%
front-end operations so the
um

04:17:51.050 --> 04:17:51.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:53.929 --> 04:17:53.939 align:start position:0%
the division of our department that
 
04:17:56.570 --> 04:17:56.580 align:start position:0%
handles tax returns there would just be
 
04:18:00.290 --> 04:18:00.300 align:start position:0%
more tax returns both from the existing
 
04:18:02.389 --> 04:18:02.399 align:start position:0%
combined filing groups that would just
 
04:18:03.769 --> 04:18:03.779 align:start position:0%
have more entities in their group
 
04:18:06.469 --> 04:18:06.479 align:start position:0%
there's just going to be more paper but
 
04:18:08.870 --> 04:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
also potentially new taxpayers so
 
04:18:11.929 --> 04:18:11.939 align:start position:0%
they'll just be a greater volume of tax
 
04:18:13.689 --> 04:18:13.699 align:start position:0%
returns to process
 
04:18:17.689 --> 04:18:17.699 align:start position:0%
that is something the department can can
 
04:18:21.050 --> 04:18:21.060 align:start position:0%
swallow and and administer so that's
 
04:18:22.490 --> 04:18:22.500 align:start position:0%
certainly not something that we couldn't
 
04:18:22.500 --> 04:18:24.590 align:start position:0%
certainly not something that we couldn't
administer

04:18:24.590 --> 04:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
administer
 
04:18:28.729 --> 04:18:28.739 align:start position:0%
from an audit perspective the demands
 
04:18:31.189 --> 04:18:31.199 align:start position:0%
would be greater
 
04:18:32.990 --> 04:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
um as I said there would be more of
 
04:18:35.450 --> 04:18:35.460 align:start position:0%
everything all the much more in the way
 
04:18:37.370 --> 04:18:37.380 align:start position:0%
of documents
 
04:18:40.550 --> 04:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
um from a practical matter
 
04:18:44.030 --> 04:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
the logistical strain would be
 
04:18:45.769 --> 04:18:45.779 align:start position:0%
significant we'd be looking at
 
04:18:48.290 --> 04:18:48.300 align:start position:0%
additional expenses particularly for
 
04:18:48.300 --> 04:18:49.429 align:start position:0%
additional expenses particularly for
travel

04:18:49.429 --> 04:18:49.439 align:start position:0%
travel
 
04:18:52.630 --> 04:18:52.640 align:start position:0%
um the method of auditing
 
04:18:55.429 --> 04:18:55.439 align:start position:0%
these types of taxpayers involves field
 
04:18:58.490 --> 04:18:58.500 align:start position:0%
work so we have to go to their
 
04:18:59.750 --> 04:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
headquarters or if not their
 
04:19:01.550 --> 04:19:01.560 align:start position:0%
headquarters at least where we can
 
04:19:04.130 --> 04:19:04.140 align:start position:0%
reasonably expect a material amount of
 
04:19:06.410 --> 04:19:06.420 align:start position:0%
their documentation and their responsive
 
04:19:08.110 --> 04:19:08.120 align:start position:0%
folks to be
 
04:19:10.610 --> 04:19:10.620 align:start position:0%
normally under a water's edge method
 
04:19:13.490 --> 04:19:13.500 align:start position:0%
that's or always under a wide water's
 
04:19:15.530 --> 04:19:15.540 align:start position:0%
edge method that's somewhere within
 
04:19:17.689 --> 04:19:17.699 align:start position:0%
within the United States
 
04:19:21.070 --> 04:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
if we move to a worldwide methodology
 
04:19:24.650 --> 04:19:24.660 align:start position:0%
the only way to enforce this is to go to
 
04:19:26.150 --> 04:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
where the documents and where the people
 
04:19:30.469 --> 04:19:30.479 align:start position:0%
are so travel would involve going to
 
04:19:33.530 --> 04:19:33.540 align:start position:0%
Japan or China or India
 
04:19:33.540 --> 04:19:34.610 align:start position:0%
Japan or China or India
um

04:19:34.610 --> 04:19:34.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:36.410 --> 04:19:36.420 align:start position:0%
that's going to bring with it obviously
 
04:19:40.189 --> 04:19:40.199 align:start position:0%
the increased cost and and burden of
 
04:19:40.199 --> 04:19:41.210 align:start position:0%
the increased cost and and burden of
travel

04:19:41.210 --> 04:19:41.220 align:start position:0%
travel
 
04:19:43.849 --> 04:19:43.859 align:start position:0%
as some folks already elaborated on
 
04:19:46.550 --> 04:19:46.560 align:start position:0%
there will be some language issues at
 
04:19:49.370 --> 04:19:49.380 align:start position:0%
play here because uh
 
04:19:53.389 --> 04:19:53.399 align:start position:0%
that as uh folks have mentioned Ronald
 
04:19:55.670 --> 04:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
Reagan a couple of times that the thing
 
04:19:57.229 --> 04:19:57.239 align:start position:0%
we'll borrow from an audit perspective
 
04:19:59.210 --> 04:19:59.220 align:start position:0%
there is the whole Credo of trust but
 
04:20:01.910 --> 04:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
verify we're going to need to see Source
 
04:20:04.189 --> 04:20:04.199 align:start position:0%
documentation from taxpayers so that
 
04:20:07.250 --> 04:20:07.260 align:start position:0%
involves seeing what they have prepared
 
04:20:10.070 --> 04:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
in the original language and you know
 
04:20:12.530 --> 04:20:12.540 align:start position:0%
we're lucky to have Keane who is smarter
 
04:20:15.110 --> 04:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
than me and speak several languages but
 
04:20:16.969 --> 04:20:16.979 align:start position:0%
that is a practical reality that we
 
04:20:19.309 --> 04:20:19.319 align:start position:0%
would be looking at we would need
 
04:20:22.070 --> 04:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
um to draw down on foreign language
 
04:20:25.429 --> 04:20:25.439 align:start position:0%
expertise either as part of hiring or
 
04:20:28.070 --> 04:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
Outsourcing that function to some kind
 
04:20:29.750 --> 04:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
of service provider
 
04:20:31.670 --> 04:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
and then as folks have already mentioned
 
04:20:35.210 --> 04:20:35.220 align:start position:0%
there are accounting and
 
04:20:37.969 --> 04:20:37.979 align:start position:0%
um currency exchange exchange rates and
 
04:20:40.969 --> 04:20:40.979 align:start position:0%
processing issues that we would just
 
04:20:43.070 --> 04:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
have to take into account as a part of
 
04:20:44.929 --> 04:20:44.939 align:start position:0%
that that just increase the complexity
 
04:20:46.929 --> 04:20:46.939 align:start position:0%
of the audit process
 
04:20:51.110 --> 04:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
so it it is more complicated I think if
 
04:20:52.189 --> 04:20:52.199 align:start position:0%
this is
 
04:20:55.250 --> 04:20:55.260 align:start position:0%
or I know if this is something that the
 
04:20:57.889 --> 04:20:57.899 align:start position:0%
legislature decides to do it just will
 
04:21:00.110 --> 04:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
be more of a
 
04:21:02.269 --> 04:21:02.279 align:start position:0%
um of a burden on audit or it would be
 
04:21:05.389 --> 04:21:05.399 align:start position:0%
it would demand more resources from
 
04:21:08.450 --> 04:21:08.460 align:start position:0%
audit to give you a current sense for
 
04:21:10.790 --> 04:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
what this looks like we have several
 
04:21:13.790 --> 04:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
different teams uh in the audit division
 
04:21:16.969 --> 04:21:16.979 align:start position:0%
the one that's currently the team that
 
04:21:18.950 --> 04:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
currently audits these types of
 
04:21:21.950 --> 04:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
taxpayers the large multinationals that
 
04:21:23.990 --> 04:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
are filing on a Water's Edge basis right
 
04:21:28.010 --> 04:21:28.020 align:start position:0%
now that we have about 14 or exactly 14
 
04:21:29.990 --> 04:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
of those positions that are fortunately
 
04:21:32.990 --> 04:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
fully funded thank you all
 
04:21:35.450 --> 04:21:35.460 align:start position:0%
um not including their manager so we can
 
04:21:38.750 --> 04:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
kick that up to 15. right now I'm at a
 
04:21:44.330 --> 04:21:44.340 align:start position:0%
vacancy of uh like a third so I I miss I
 
04:21:47.330 --> 04:21:47.340 align:start position:0%
have five vacant positions right now and
 
04:21:48.830 --> 04:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
that will go up to
 
04:21:52.189 --> 04:21:52.199 align:start position:0%
want an additional vacant position for a
 
04:21:54.170 --> 04:21:54.180 align:start position:0%
total of six when one of our best
 
04:21:58.429 --> 04:21:58.439 align:start position:0%
Auditors retires Friday so it's it's a
 
04:22:01.309 --> 04:22:01.319 align:start position:0%
an existing strain on our resources as
 
04:22:03.110 --> 04:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
many of you know
 
04:22:05.330 --> 04:22:05.340 align:start position:0%
um this is a difficult hiring
 
04:22:08.330 --> 04:22:08.340 align:start position:0%
environment for employers and I'm an
 
04:22:11.030 --> 04:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
employer in a sense I I go out into the
 
04:22:14.269 --> 04:22:14.279 align:start position:0%
market and I hire accountants and
 
04:22:14.279 --> 04:22:15.849 align:start position:0%
market and I hire accountants and
lawyers

04:22:15.849 --> 04:22:15.859 align:start position:0%
lawyers
 
04:22:20.150 --> 04:22:20.160 align:start position:0%
who go out into the world and audit
 
04:22:23.030 --> 04:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
these taxpayers and it can be a
 
04:22:27.290 --> 04:22:27.300 align:start position:0%
challenge when these industries are also
 
04:22:31.150 --> 04:22:31.160 align:start position:0%
competing with us and you know
 
04:22:34.370 --> 04:22:34.380 align:start position:0%
hiring with uh with much more
 
04:22:37.130 --> 04:22:37.140 align:start position:0%
competitive compensation packages just
 
04:22:39.229 --> 04:22:39.239 align:start position:0%
to clarify you're saying you have 14
 
04:22:42.229 --> 04:22:42.239 align:start position:0%
authorized billets of which only eight
 
04:22:44.929 --> 04:22:44.939 align:start position:0%
as of Friday will be occupied
 
04:22:47.330 --> 04:22:47.340 align:start position:0%
correct yep
 
04:22:47.340 --> 04:22:48.590 align:start position:0%
correct yep
yep

04:22:48.590 --> 04:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
yep
 
04:22:48.600 --> 04:22:50.689 align:start position:0%
yep
yeah

04:22:50.689 --> 04:22:50.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:54.670 --> 04:22:54.680 align:start position:0%
so um those are the um
 
04:22:59.330 --> 04:22:59.340 align:start position:0%
that's the uh the impact on the audit
 
04:23:01.130 --> 04:23:01.140 align:start position:0%
division which I I know folks who are
 
04:23:02.510 --> 04:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
interested in hearing us talk about how
 
04:23:04.729 --> 04:23:04.739 align:start position:0%
would the department absorb moving from
 
04:23:08.929 --> 04:23:08.939 align:start position:0%
Water's Edge to worldwide so that's my
 
04:23:11.630 --> 04:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
take on it as the audit director at Keen
 
04:23:12.590 --> 04:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you want to add anything
 
04:23:12.600 --> 04:23:13.790 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you want to add anything
further

04:23:13.790 --> 04:23:13.800 align:start position:0%
further
 
04:23:16.610 --> 04:23:16.620 align:start position:0%
not not at this point no
 
04:23:18.710 --> 04:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
so then I unless there are questions on
 
04:23:20.090 --> 04:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
that we could move into some of the
 
04:23:22.070 --> 04:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
substantive oh please I do have a
 
04:23:24.769 --> 04:23:24.779 align:start position:0%
question sure and maybe others
 
04:23:24.779 --> 04:23:25.790 align:start position:0%
question sure and maybe others
um

04:23:25.790 --> 04:23:25.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:29.570 --> 04:23:29.580 align:start position:0%
so recruiting challenges are inherent
 
04:23:31.490 --> 04:23:31.500 align:start position:0%
already even if the law doesn't change
 
04:23:34.130 --> 04:23:34.140 align:start position:0%
totally yes uh resource requirements are
 
04:23:37.729 --> 04:23:37.739 align:start position:0%
going to increase but what about the
 
04:23:41.410 --> 04:23:41.420 align:start position:0%
specific qualifications or background of
 
04:23:45.710 --> 04:23:45.720 align:start position:0%
a adequate candidate does that change
 
04:23:47.689 --> 04:23:47.699 align:start position:0%
that's a great become more challenging
 
04:23:49.969 --> 04:23:49.979 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a great question potentially
 
04:23:52.610 --> 04:23:52.620 align:start position:0%
yes so
 
04:23:55.189 --> 04:23:55.199 align:start position:0%
what one of the
 
04:23:57.349 --> 04:23:57.359 align:start position:0%
we try to be flexible these are all
 
04:23:59.570 --> 04:23:59.580 align:start position:0%
unclassified positions these folks exist
 
04:24:01.189 --> 04:24:01.199 align:start position:0%
outside of the Personnel rules and
 
04:24:02.929 --> 04:24:02.939 align:start position:0%
outside of the collective bargaining
 
04:24:06.229 --> 04:24:06.239 align:start position:0%
agreement and the Union uh that goes a
 
04:24:07.790 --> 04:24:07.800 align:start position:0%
long way and to help make us more
 
04:24:09.590 --> 04:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
competitive and allow us to conduct the
 
04:24:11.809 --> 04:24:11.819 align:start position:0%
work that we do but to your point
 
04:24:11.819 --> 04:24:13.370 align:start position:0%
work that we do but to your point
directly

04:24:13.370 --> 04:24:13.380 align:start position:0%
directly
 
04:24:16.189 --> 04:24:16.199 align:start position:0%
yeah we we are going to have to as I
 
04:24:18.530 --> 04:24:18.540 align:start position:0%
said we're gonna have to find a way to
 
04:24:20.389 --> 04:24:20.399 align:start position:0%
increase our breadth of knowledge
 
04:24:22.630 --> 04:24:22.640 align:start position:0%
particularly with respect to languages
 
04:24:25.429 --> 04:24:25.439 align:start position:0%
and these these other frankly exotic
 
04:24:28.610 --> 04:24:28.620 align:start position:0%
accounting and currency methodologies uh
 
04:24:30.889 --> 04:24:30.899 align:start position:0%
that we will need to somehow onboard
 
04:24:33.050 --> 04:24:33.060 align:start position:0%
that expertise either through direct
 
04:24:36.769 --> 04:24:36.779 align:start position:0%
hiring or the utilization of service
 
04:24:38.809 --> 04:24:38.819 align:start position:0%
providers which as you all know better
 
04:24:40.610 --> 04:24:40.620 align:start position:0%
than me brings its own challenges and
 
04:24:42.349 --> 04:24:42.359 align:start position:0%
from my perspective
 
04:24:44.689 --> 04:24:44.699 align:start position:0%
causes me some concerns with respect to
 
04:24:46.370 --> 04:24:46.380 align:start position:0%
confidentiality respecting the
 
04:24:48.410 --> 04:24:48.420 align:start position:0%
confidentiality of the taxpayers
 
04:24:50.990 --> 04:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
information and protecting the taxpayer
 
04:24:51.000 --> 04:24:51.830 align:start position:0%
information and protecting the taxpayer
which

04:24:51.830 --> 04:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
which
 
04:24:53.510 --> 04:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
they're entitled to under the law and
 
04:24:55.309 --> 04:24:55.319 align:start position:0%
that we have to ensure that we're
 
04:24:57.410 --> 04:24:57.420 align:start position:0%
safeguarding their information
 
04:24:59.030 --> 04:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
representative Ellery
 
04:25:01.849 --> 04:25:01.859 align:start position:0%
yes you had mentioned an exchange rate
 
04:25:05.570 --> 04:25:05.580 align:start position:0%
and just having a passing it sure it
 
04:25:07.490 --> 04:25:07.500 align:start position:0%
seems to me that if you're doing an
 
04:25:10.550 --> 04:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
audit that's over a period of time and
 
04:25:13.010 --> 04:25:13.020 align:start position:0%
yet an exchange rate is over a period of
 
04:25:15.710 --> 04:25:15.720 align:start position:0%
hours correct minutes yeah correct so
 
04:25:17.870 --> 04:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
how do you determine what a dollar is
 
04:25:20.689 --> 04:25:20.699 align:start position:0%
worth it any given time that that's a
 
04:25:21.950 --> 04:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
great question and we would need to
 
04:25:24.290 --> 04:25:24.300 align:start position:0%
bring that expertise on board
 
04:25:26.630 --> 04:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
um you know presumably that would be
 
04:25:28.670 --> 04:25:28.680 align:start position:0%
that would have to be hashed out under
 
04:25:31.790 --> 04:25:31.800 align:start position:0%
audit between the taxpayer and and our
 
04:25:33.170 --> 04:25:33.180 align:start position:0%
Auditors so they're going to have their
 
04:25:34.670 --> 04:25:34.680 align:start position:0%
own they're going to have to hire their
 
04:25:36.229 --> 04:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
own experts if they don't already have
 
04:25:38.990 --> 04:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
that expertise somewhere so they'll get
 
04:25:41.030 --> 04:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
that expertise onboarded we'll have our
 
04:25:43.010 --> 04:25:43.020 align:start position:0%
own people and we'll have to Hash it out
 
04:25:44.570 --> 04:25:44.580 align:start position:0%
to figure out what would be acceptable
 
04:25:46.790 --> 04:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
to both sides and and it might be the
 
04:25:49.550 --> 04:25:49.560 align:start position:0%
case that neither side agrees with the
 
04:25:51.410 --> 04:25:51.420 align:start position:0%
other and that would just be just yet
 
04:25:53.929 --> 04:25:53.939 align:start position:0%
another issue to litigate if it goes to
 
04:25:55.969 --> 04:25:55.979 align:start position:0%
in the in the litigation
 
04:25:59.330 --> 04:25:59.340 align:start position:0%
I think the phraseology in the
 
04:26:01.550 --> 04:26:01.560 align:start position:0%
legislature is a lawyer's employment
 
04:26:01.560 --> 04:26:02.929 align:start position:0%
legislature is a lawyer's employment
bill

04:26:02.929 --> 04:26:02.939 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:26:04.729 --> 04:26:04.739 align:start position:0%
um but that's right the the other
 
04:26:06.050 --> 04:26:06.060 align:start position:0%
question I have is you talked about
 
04:26:08.570 --> 04:26:08.580 align:start position:0%
language problems and translations or
 
04:26:10.610 --> 04:26:10.620 align:start position:0%
transliterations yep
 
04:26:13.189 --> 04:26:13.199 align:start position:0%
even English to English could be
 
04:26:16.849 --> 04:26:16.859 align:start position:0%
difficult sure yep yep
 
04:26:19.429 --> 04:26:19.439 align:start position:0%
um absolutely
 
04:26:19.439 --> 04:26:20.149 align:start position:0%
um absolutely
um

04:26:20.149 --> 04:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:22.370 --> 04:26:22.380 align:start position:0%
but as I said this would
 
04:26:25.729 --> 04:26:25.739 align:start position:0%
um if we're going to enforce this and if
 
04:26:27.290 --> 04:26:27.300 align:start position:0%
certainly if
 
04:26:30.590 --> 04:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
folks are expecting this legislation to
 
04:26:32.630 --> 04:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
perform a revenue raising function there
 
04:26:35.510 --> 04:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
has to be a robust audit enforcement
 
04:26:37.849 --> 04:26:37.859 align:start position:0%
mechanism here and and that's going to
 
04:26:37.859 --> 04:26:39.050 align:start position:0%
mechanism here and and that's going to
require

04:26:39.050 --> 04:26:39.060 align:start position:0%
require
 
04:26:41.689 --> 04:26:41.699 align:start position:0%
um my Auditors to to know what they're
 
04:26:43.849 --> 04:26:43.859 align:start position:0%
seeing from Source documentation so
 
04:26:45.290 --> 04:26:45.300 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to read this stuff
 
04:26:46.670 --> 04:26:46.680 align:start position:0%
directly they're gonna have to be able
 
04:26:49.070 --> 04:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
to talk with someone to be able to gauge
 
04:26:50.750 --> 04:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
if this accountant or if this return
 
04:26:53.030 --> 04:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
preparer is a credible person or not if
 
04:26:55.250 --> 04:26:55.260 align:start position:0%
what what their gut says
 
04:26:56.990 --> 04:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
I thank you and the only reason I
 
04:26:58.610 --> 04:26:58.620 align:start position:0%
brought that I was reading some history
 
04:27:01.910 --> 04:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
last night and this is near the timeline
 
04:27:04.429 --> 04:27:04.439 align:start position:0%
the Gloucester regiment was decimated in
 
04:27:06.769 --> 04:27:06.779 align:start position:0%
Korea and the commander asked for help
 
04:27:09.349 --> 04:27:09.359 align:start position:0%
by saying he was a sticky situation he
 
04:27:11.149 --> 04:27:11.159 align:start position:0%
was under the command of an American he
 
04:27:13.189 --> 04:27:13.199 align:start position:0%
said oh it's just a sticky situation who
 
04:27:15.469 --> 04:27:15.479 align:start position:0%
cares he was being
 
04:27:18.110 --> 04:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
beat up yeah and the Americans said oh
 
04:27:20.990 --> 04:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
no big deal yeah yeah absolutely that I
 
04:27:22.490 --> 04:27:22.500 align:start position:0%
mean that's a that's a great point they
 
04:27:26.149 --> 04:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
the language challenges and the the
 
04:27:28.070 --> 04:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
failure for some of these Concepts to be
 
04:27:31.790 --> 04:27:31.800 align:start position:0%
able to translate easily it is going to
 
04:27:33.170 --> 04:27:33.180 align:start position:0%
be something we'll all have to wrestle
 
04:27:33.180 --> 04:27:35.210 align:start position:0%
be something we'll all have to wrestle
with

04:27:35.210 --> 04:27:35.220 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:27:37.429 --> 04:27:37.439 align:start position:0%
so while we're on audit other questions
 
04:27:42.410 --> 04:27:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:44.149 --> 04:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah
 
04:27:47.630 --> 04:27:47.640 align:start position:0%
uh since we're in the digital age yes
 
04:27:50.090 --> 04:27:50.100 align:start position:0%
not like I am most of the time in the
 
04:27:51.710 --> 04:27:51.720 align:start position:0%
pencil age
 
04:27:51.720 --> 04:27:52.929 align:start position:0%
pencil age
um

04:27:52.929 --> 04:27:52.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:55.429 --> 04:27:55.439 align:start position:0%
these subsidiaries that are located here
 
04:27:57.349 --> 04:27:57.359 align:start position:0%
couldn't they
 
04:27:59.269 --> 04:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
in nearly all cases provide the
 
04:28:03.110 --> 04:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
necessary information to satisfy
 
04:28:05.689 --> 04:28:05.699 align:start position:0%
the audit information that you need here
 
04:28:07.910 --> 04:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
in the state versus I realize you like
 
04:28:12.290 --> 04:28:12.300 align:start position:0%
to travel to London okay uh
 
04:28:15.469 --> 04:28:15.479 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that be when
 
04:28:19.070 --> 04:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
the dra set up some kind of rules
 
04:28:20.929 --> 04:28:20.939 align:start position:0%
adopting requiring the maintenance and
 
04:28:23.630 --> 04:28:23.640 align:start position:0%
availability for audit of taxpayer
 
04:28:25.370 --> 04:28:25.380 align:start position:0%
information relevant to this wouldn't it
 
04:28:27.469 --> 04:28:27.479 align:start position:0%
yes that's a great question so combined
 
04:28:30.469 --> 04:28:30.479 align:start position:0%
here yeah that's a great question so the
 
04:28:33.050 --> 04:28:33.060 align:start position:0%
the ease of transmitting information has
 
04:28:35.630 --> 04:28:35.640 align:start position:0%
definitely got a lot easier
 
04:28:37.969 --> 04:28:37.979 align:start position:0%
um that's a great point and and you're
 
04:28:40.130 --> 04:28:40.140 align:start position:0%
right we utilize that right now with
 
04:28:44.649 --> 04:28:44.659 align:start position:0%
secure file transfer applications and
 
04:28:47.929 --> 04:28:47.939 align:start position:0%
encrypted emails and all of that so
 
04:28:50.149 --> 04:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
that's an actual it's an excellent point
 
04:28:52.250 --> 04:28:52.260 align:start position:0%
and we we use that already and that
 
04:28:54.290 --> 04:28:54.300 align:start position:0%
would have to be
 
04:28:58.670 --> 04:28:58.680 align:start position:0%
um part of any uh audit in a worldwide
 
04:28:58.680 --> 04:29:00.290 align:start position:0%
um part of any uh audit in a worldwide
environment

04:29:00.290 --> 04:29:00.300 align:start position:0%
environment
 
04:29:02.510 --> 04:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
um but there's there's something to be
 
04:29:05.330 --> 04:29:05.340 align:start position:0%
said and and I'm a big advocate of field
 
04:29:08.990 --> 04:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
work it until uh Lindsay someday gets
 
04:29:10.610 --> 04:29:10.620 align:start position:0%
gets tired of me and fires me which is
 
04:29:12.469 --> 04:29:12.479 align:start position:0%
probably tomorrow but I'll always
 
04:29:15.229 --> 04:29:15.239 align:start position:0%
advocate for field work because
 
04:29:16.969 --> 04:29:16.979 align:start position:0%
um I just think
 
04:29:19.370 --> 04:29:19.380 align:start position:0%
as important as the digital tools are
 
04:29:21.290 --> 04:29:21.300 align:start position:0%
and yeah we can get volumes of
 
04:29:24.110 --> 04:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
information on a
 
04:29:26.330 --> 04:29:26.340 align:start position:0%
through a file transfer in us in a
 
04:29:28.610 --> 04:29:28.620 align:start position:0%
second but you don't know what you don't
 
04:29:31.070 --> 04:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
know if you don't go and see their
 
04:29:34.429 --> 04:29:34.439 align:start position:0%
operations with your own eyes someone I
 
04:29:35.750 --> 04:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
think was Carl Friedman from cost
 
04:29:37.610 --> 04:29:37.620 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh former commissioner Stan
 
04:29:39.889 --> 04:29:39.899 align:start position:0%
Arnold and um
 
04:29:42.349 --> 04:29:42.359 align:start position:0%
Stan actually uh I worked with Stan in
 
04:29:44.330 --> 04:29:44.340 align:start position:0%
his subsequent life at in private
 
04:29:44.340 --> 04:29:45.530 align:start position:0%
his subsequent life at in private
practice

04:29:45.530 --> 04:29:45.540 align:start position:0%
practice
 
04:29:47.689 --> 04:29:47.699 align:start position:0%
um and he had a great anecdote that I
 
04:29:49.610 --> 04:29:49.620 align:start position:0%
I've stolen from him and I keep alive
 
04:29:53.149 --> 04:29:53.159 align:start position:0%
because I love it um but uh the the
 
04:29:56.090 --> 04:29:56.100 align:start position:0%
image I like to picture or the image I
 
04:29:58.429 --> 04:29:58.439 align:start position:0%
like people the picture is um from the
 
04:30:01.309 --> 04:30:01.319 align:start position:0%
original Indiana Jones where they kept
 
04:30:03.170 --> 04:30:03.180 align:start position:0%
the the Ark of the Covenant in the in
 
04:30:04.670 --> 04:30:04.680 align:start position:0%
the warehouse at the end I think it was
 
04:30:06.590 --> 04:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
the CIA or whomever
 
04:30:09.410 --> 04:30:09.420 align:start position:0%
um they they've got their top men with
 
04:30:11.389 --> 04:30:11.399 align:start position:0%
the with the Ark of the Covenant in this
 
04:30:13.010 --> 04:30:13.020 align:start position:0%
massive warehouse and it's buried in the
 
04:30:16.550 --> 04:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
back so Stan as some of you know started
 
04:30:18.469 --> 04:30:18.479 align:start position:0%
as a field auditor
 
04:30:21.590 --> 04:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
um and he got sent out to
 
04:30:21.600 --> 04:30:22.630 align:start position:0%
um and he got sent out to
um

04:30:22.630 --> 04:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:25.610 --> 04:30:25.620 align:start position:0%
audit here uh Water's Edge audit but
 
04:30:28.550 --> 04:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
they're um it was I won't say which
 
04:30:30.469 --> 04:30:30.479 align:start position:0%
country just to fully protect the
 
04:30:32.750 --> 04:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
identity of this taxpayer here
 
04:30:34.389 --> 04:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
um but it was uh
 
04:30:37.429 --> 04:30:37.439 align:start position:0%
uh foreign parented company and so he
 
04:30:39.170 --> 04:30:39.180 align:start position:0%
he's auditing them and they've got him
 
04:30:41.149 --> 04:30:41.159 align:start position:0%
in the Ark of the Covenant warehouse and
 
04:30:42.530 --> 04:30:42.540 align:start position:0%
they think they're really sticking it to
 
04:30:44.450 --> 04:30:44.460 align:start position:0%
him because you know oh yeah you can
 
04:30:45.830 --> 04:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
have all our documents we're not going
 
04:30:47.210 --> 04:30:47.220 align:start position:0%
to make them available to you though you
 
04:30:48.889 --> 04:30:48.899 align:start position:0%
have to come to them and we're going to
 
04:30:51.469 --> 04:30:51.479 align:start position:0%
put you here and long story short what
 
04:30:52.910 --> 04:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
they didn't know was that Stan actually
 
04:30:55.550 --> 04:30:55.560 align:start position:0%
spoke their native language he spoke the
 
04:30:57.889 --> 04:30:57.899 align:start position:0%
the parent company's language and so he
 
04:30:59.689 --> 04:30:59.699 align:start position:0%
had no problem rifling through their
 
04:31:02.210 --> 04:31:02.220 align:start position:0%
stuff and he very quickly found a lot of
 
04:31:03.830 --> 04:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
damaging information in there so there
 
04:31:07.610 --> 04:31:07.620 align:start position:0%
there's no uh you just don't know what
 
04:31:09.229 --> 04:31:09.239 align:start position:0%
you don't know until you actually get
 
04:31:11.510 --> 04:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
out there see their operations with your
 
04:31:13.250 --> 04:31:13.260 align:start position:0%
own eyes and we're just going to need to
 
04:31:15.530 --> 04:31:15.540 align:start position:0%
do that just to see what passes muster
 
04:31:18.170 --> 04:31:18.180 align:start position:0%
if we just get a bunch of information
 
04:31:20.929 --> 04:31:20.939 align:start position:0%
from a file transfer that as a practical
 
04:31:23.689 --> 04:31:23.699 align:start position:0%
matter That's How we'll get most of the
 
04:31:26.149 --> 04:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
stuff that we probably end up using but
 
04:31:28.670 --> 04:31:28.680 align:start position:0%
until you get out there you know in
 
04:31:31.309 --> 04:31:31.319 align:start position:0%
China or I'll I'll shut up thank you
 
04:31:32.689 --> 04:31:32.699 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:31:35.450 --> 04:31:35.460 align:start position:0%
I just want to add something to that as
 
04:31:38.269 --> 04:31:38.279 align:start position:0%
well uh even here currently uh in the
 
04:31:41.269 --> 04:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
you for local US audits uh Water's Edge
 
04:31:43.370 --> 04:31:43.380 align:start position:0%
audits there are some situations where
 
04:31:45.410 --> 04:31:45.420 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer says no we're not going to
 
04:31:48.010 --> 04:31:48.020 align:start position:0%
be transmitting those documents um
 
04:31:51.349 --> 04:31:51.359 align:start position:0%
uh online or in a CD or anything like
 
04:31:53.030 --> 04:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
that if you want to see those documents
 
04:31:55.010 --> 04:31:55.020 align:start position:0%
you have to come to our office so those
 
04:31:57.410 --> 04:31:57.420 align:start position:0%
situations have occurred before
 
04:31:59.630 --> 04:31:59.640 align:start position:0%
um and they have their own privacy
 
04:32:02.389 --> 04:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
um policies and um so we just have to uh
 
04:32:04.849 --> 04:32:04.859 align:start position:0%
adhere to that
 
04:32:07.550 --> 04:32:07.560 align:start position:0%
I must follow up on that you mean to
 
04:32:10.309 --> 04:32:10.319 align:start position:0%
tell me the private in the company can
 
04:32:13.309 --> 04:32:13.319 align:start position:0%
tell the New Hampshire dra that they
 
04:32:13.319 --> 04:32:14.570 align:start position:0%
tell the New Hampshire dra that they
cannot

04:32:14.570 --> 04:32:14.580 align:start position:0%
cannot
 
04:32:17.389 --> 04:32:17.399 align:start position:0%
have that information transmitted if the
 
04:32:19.250 --> 04:32:19.260 align:start position:0%
rules and legislation is set down that
 
04:32:21.410 --> 04:32:21.420 align:start position:0%
way so
 
04:32:25.610 --> 04:32:25.620 align:start position:0%
what the what happens under audit is we
 
04:32:28.189 --> 04:32:28.199 align:start position:0%
will ask a taxpayer to provide this
 
04:32:31.250 --> 04:32:31.260 align:start position:0%
information for us and
 
04:32:34.670 --> 04:32:34.680 align:start position:0%
um week to your point we can escalate
 
04:32:37.969 --> 04:32:37.979 align:start position:0%
the tactics that we use as necessary we
 
04:32:40.130 --> 04:32:40.140 align:start position:0%
try not to do that just to preserve the
 
04:32:41.689 --> 04:32:41.699 align:start position:0%
work and relationship between it's
 
04:32:44.149 --> 04:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
whether you're a mom-and-pop pizza shop
 
04:32:46.070 --> 04:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
or the biggest multinational in the
 
04:32:48.170 --> 04:32:48.180 align:start position:0%
world audit is not fun you don't want to
 
04:32:50.210 --> 04:32:50.220 align:start position:0%
see keen and Fred show up to your your
 
04:32:52.130 --> 04:32:52.140 align:start position:0%
doorstep we're nice enough guys but it's
 
04:32:54.410 --> 04:32:54.420 align:start position:0%
not going to be pleasant for anybody so
 
04:32:58.309 --> 04:32:58.319 align:start position:0%
um if they resist but say look we're not
 
04:33:00.710 --> 04:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
going to send you this stuff but you can
 
04:33:03.649 --> 04:33:03.659 align:start position:0%
come and see it we'll we'll accept that
 
04:33:05.390 --> 04:33:05.400 align:start position:0%
and we'll we'll go to their location and
 
04:33:06.849 --> 04:33:06.859 align:start position:0%
we'll see where the documents are
 
04:33:09.051 --> 04:33:09.061 align:start position:0%
particularly if the records are old and
 
04:33:12.349 --> 04:33:12.359 align:start position:0%
haven't been digitized if they don't to
 
04:33:14.929 --> 04:33:14.939 align:start position:0%
your point we do have tactics that can
 
04:33:16.849 --> 04:33:16.859 align:start position:0%
force we can subpoena them we can force
 
04:33:19.670 --> 04:33:19.680 align:start position:0%
depositions it can get it can get nasty
 
04:33:22.070 --> 04:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
so there are tools that we have but we
 
04:33:24.590 --> 04:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
we like to keep the processes collegial
 
04:33:26.449 --> 04:33:26.459 align:start position:0%
as possible for as long as possible
 
04:33:27.769 --> 04:33:27.779 align:start position:0%
before we resort
 
04:33:30.051 --> 04:33:30.061 align:start position:0%
and isn't it also true that in a field
 
04:33:32.869 --> 04:33:32.879 align:start position:0%
audit where you have access directly to
 
04:33:34.609 --> 04:33:34.619 align:start position:0%
Source documents you can make quick
 
04:33:37.310 --> 04:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
checks random searches etc etc look for
 
04:33:39.529 --> 04:33:39.539 align:start position:0%
red flags which is completely different
 
04:33:41.269 --> 04:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
than the kind of fishing Expedition
 
04:33:43.910 --> 04:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
you'd have to go through to have them
 
04:33:46.131 --> 04:33:46.141 align:start position:0%
disclose exhaustively everything they've
 
04:33:48.650 --> 04:33:48.660 align:start position:0%
got that's a that's a really good point
 
04:33:50.510 --> 04:33:50.520 align:start position:0%
it actually becomes a way of limiting
 
04:33:52.551 --> 04:33:52.561 align:start position:0%
the scope yes that's a that's a really
 
04:33:53.929 --> 04:33:53.939 align:start position:0%
good point I was just having this
 
04:33:55.670 --> 04:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
conversation with actually the auditor
 
04:33:58.429 --> 04:33:58.439 align:start position:0%
who's retiring and you know the value of
 
04:34:00.650 --> 04:34:00.660 align:start position:0%
a narrowly tailored request to a
 
04:34:03.131 --> 04:34:03.141 align:start position:0%
taxpayer as opposed to just requesting
 
04:34:06.470 --> 04:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
every single thing they have which for a
 
04:34:09.470 --> 04:34:09.480 align:start position:0%
pizza shop fine but for you know a
 
04:34:11.390 --> 04:34:11.400 align:start position:0%
multinational we're talking trillions of
 
04:34:13.490 --> 04:34:13.500 align:start position:0%
pages here that's not you know how can
 
04:34:14.990 --> 04:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
we be efficient with everybody's time
 
04:34:16.789 --> 04:34:16.799 align:start position:0%
here okay if if you don't have any
 
04:34:18.890 --> 04:34:18.900 align:start position:0%
objection and I'm fine with this I
 
04:34:20.810 --> 04:34:20.820 align:start position:0%
understand that Dan bucks who's still
 
04:34:23.929 --> 04:34:23.939 align:start position:0%
connected with us on online sure has a
 
04:34:25.730 --> 04:34:25.740 align:start position:0%
question narrowly focused on the audit
 
04:34:25.740 --> 04:34:26.990 align:start position:0%
question narrowly focused on the audit
topic

04:34:26.990 --> 04:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
topic
 
04:34:27.000 --> 04:34:32.869 align:start position:0%
topic
yes

04:34:32.869 --> 04:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:35.810 --> 04:34:35.820 align:start position:0%
if I could I I guess I have a question
 
04:34:38.090 --> 04:34:38.100 align:start position:0%
that is after a comment
 
04:34:40.551 --> 04:34:40.561 align:start position:0%
um and I I must say
 
04:34:43.551 --> 04:34:43.561 align:start position:0%
I have a very high regard for the New
 
04:34:44.990 --> 04:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Revenue
 
04:34:47.449 --> 04:34:47.459 align:start position:0%
Administration and I have a special
 
04:34:50.869 --> 04:34:50.879 align:start position:0%
place in my park for water those who
 
04:34:53.570 --> 04:34:53.580 align:start position:0%
have to do very difficult work in some
 
04:34:55.849 --> 04:34:55.859 align:start position:0%
of the most difficult work in in Tax
 
04:34:55.859 --> 04:34:58.131 align:start position:0%
of the most difficult work in in Tax
Administration

04:34:58.131 --> 04:34:58.141 align:start position:0%
Administration
 
04:35:00.470 --> 04:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
um but I I
 
04:35:04.490 --> 04:35:04.500 align:start position:0%
have always been somewhat puzzled by the
 
04:35:07.750 --> 04:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
assumption that worldwide unitary
 
04:35:11.810 --> 04:35:11.820 align:start position:0%
requires any extensive international
 
04:35:11.820 --> 04:35:13.990 align:start position:0%
requires any extensive international
travel

04:35:13.990 --> 04:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
travel
 
04:35:17.929 --> 04:35:17.939 align:start position:0%
and I and I'm I'm not I'm not clear as
 
04:35:19.970 --> 04:35:19.980 align:start position:0%
to why that is the case
 
04:35:23.390 --> 04:35:23.400 align:start position:0%
uh when the states practice worldwide
 
04:35:27.170 --> 04:35:27.180 align:start position:0%
unitary in the 70s and 80s it was at
 
04:35:28.429 --> 04:35:28.439 align:start position:0%
least for the states that I'm most
 
04:35:30.529 --> 04:35:30.539 align:start position:0%
acquainted with the smaller States and
 
04:35:34.789 --> 04:35:34.799 align:start position:0%
and we and we have a uh in that sense
 
04:35:37.670 --> 04:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
um we're very much like New Hampshire it
 
04:35:40.551 --> 04:35:40.561 align:start position:0%
was not necessary to travel uh to
 
04:35:44.090 --> 04:35:44.100 align:start position:0%
foreign lands to acquire the records
 
04:35:47.929 --> 04:35:47.939 align:start position:0%
uh the the corporations that had a a
 
04:35:50.209 --> 04:35:50.219 align:start position:0%
connection with the state such that they
 
04:35:52.010 --> 04:35:52.020 align:start position:0%
had Nexus with the state
 
04:35:55.310 --> 04:35:55.320 align:start position:0%
uh are operating in the United States
 
04:35:58.250 --> 04:35:58.260 align:start position:0%
and they have international accounting
 
04:36:00.289 --> 04:36:00.299 align:start position:0%
firms with offices in the United States
 
04:36:02.750 --> 04:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
that handle their tax filings
 
04:36:04.730 --> 04:36:04.740 align:start position:0%
and the records are were typically
 
04:36:04.740 --> 04:36:06.410 align:start position:0%
and the records are were typically
available

04:36:06.410 --> 04:36:06.420 align:start position:0%
available
 
04:36:08.631 --> 04:36:08.641 align:start position:0%
uh and I must say that auditing
 
04:36:10.429 --> 04:36:10.439 align:start position:0%
continues today
 
04:36:13.551 --> 04:36:13.561 align:start position:0%
in the case of worldwide returns that
 
04:36:15.769 --> 04:36:15.779 align:start position:0%
are voluntarily filed and for a long
 
04:36:17.929 --> 04:36:17.939 align:start position:0%
time after for example the state of
 
04:36:17.939 --> 04:36:19.150 align:start position:0%
time after for example the state of
Montana

04:36:19.150 --> 04:36:19.160 align:start position:0%
Montana
 
04:36:22.490 --> 04:36:22.500 align:start position:0%
uh went to a Watersedge election the
 
04:36:24.650 --> 04:36:24.660 align:start position:0%
vast majority of taxpayers continued to
 
04:36:28.910 --> 04:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
find a file worldwide returns for 15 to
 
04:36:31.490 --> 04:36:31.500 align:start position:0%
20 years it was only in more recent
 
04:36:34.070 --> 04:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
years when profit shifting became more
 
04:36:36.949 --> 04:36:36.959 align:start position:0%
popular that corporations increasingly
 
04:36:40.570 --> 04:36:40.580 align:start position:0%
have chosen to file Water's Edge
 
04:36:44.929 --> 04:36:44.939 align:start position:0%
but in in my tenure as deputy director
 
04:36:51.789 --> 04:36:51.799 align:start position:0%
for from 1981 late 1981 to early 1988
 
04:36:55.070 --> 04:36:55.080 align:start position:0%
and again in the eight years from 2005
 
04:36:59.449 --> 04:36:59.459 align:start position:0%
to 2013 and during my tenure with the
 
04:37:01.789 --> 04:37:01.799 align:start position:0%
Molly State Tax Commission for 17 years
 
04:37:04.310 --> 04:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
where we audited for States for
 
04:37:07.429 --> 04:37:07.439 align:start position:0%
worldwide returns again even after
 
04:37:09.529 --> 04:37:09.539 align:start position:0%
Water's Edge there was a substantial
 
04:37:12.529 --> 04:37:12.539 align:start position:0%
delay in companies switching to Water's
 
04:37:12.539 --> 04:37:13.250 align:start position:0%
delay in companies switching to Water's
Edge

04:37:13.250 --> 04:37:13.260 align:start position:0%
Edge
 
04:37:16.970 --> 04:37:16.980 align:start position:0%
we never had to send our Auditors uh uh
 
04:37:19.910 --> 04:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
overseas to conduct these audits we
 
04:37:22.429 --> 04:37:22.439 align:start position:0%
could always secure the information
 
04:37:26.269 --> 04:37:26.279 align:start position:0%
the only audit that I recall that we had
 
04:37:28.970 --> 04:37:28.980 align:start position:0%
to send someone to London for that was
 
04:37:31.869 --> 04:37:31.879 align:start position:0%
the only trip that was during my tenure
 
04:37:37.609 --> 04:37:37.619 align:start position:0%
in 2003 to to to I mean from 2005 to
 
04:37:42.650 --> 04:37:42.660 align:start position:0%
2013 in Montana the only trip that was
 
04:37:47.090 --> 04:37:47.100 align:start position:0%
taken was to London uh for to look at
 
04:37:48.709 --> 04:37:48.719 align:start position:0%
the board of directors records to
 
04:37:52.429 --> 04:37:52.439 align:start position:0%
establish a unitary relationship under a
 
04:37:54.410 --> 04:37:54.420 align:start position:0%
Water's Edge return
 
04:37:57.410 --> 04:37:57.420 align:start position:0%
so far under a Water's Edge return you
 
04:37:59.390 --> 04:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
you may have a circumstance that would
 
04:38:01.551 --> 04:38:01.561 align:start position:0%
arise or you have some international
 
04:38:04.490 --> 04:38:04.500 align:start position:0%
travel but that's very rare but this was
 
04:38:06.529 --> 04:38:06.539 align:start position:0%
one rare instance where we had to look
 
04:38:08.209 --> 04:38:08.219 align:start position:0%
at board of directors minutes that were
 
04:38:08.219 --> 04:38:09.230 align:start position:0%
at board of directors minutes that were
in

04:38:09.230 --> 04:38:09.240 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:38:11.810 --> 04:38:11.820 align:start position:0%
um in London and that was for a Water's
 
04:38:14.810 --> 04:38:14.820 align:start position:0%
Edge filing not for a worldwide filing
 
04:38:18.289 --> 04:38:18.299 align:start position:0%
so I am puzzled by this because that was
 
04:38:21.470 --> 04:38:21.480 align:start position:0%
not that that that's was not necessary
 
04:38:24.529 --> 04:38:24.539 align:start position:0%
to do an adequate worldwide return it
 
04:38:27.890 --> 04:38:27.900 align:start position:0%
was not necessary to travel overseas to
 
04:38:30.051 --> 04:38:30.061 align:start position:0%
do so with any kind of regularity I
 
04:38:32.269 --> 04:38:32.279 align:start position:0%
would guarantee you those trips would be
 
04:38:34.551 --> 04:38:34.561 align:start position:0%
very noticeable if you were traveling
 
04:38:36.590 --> 04:38:36.600 align:start position:0%
overseas from Montana there were a few
 
04:38:38.390 --> 04:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
trips into Canada next door but that's
 
04:38:40.429 --> 04:38:40.439 align:start position:0%
like going to the next state when you're
 
04:38:43.849 --> 04:38:43.859 align:start position:0%
in Montana New Hampshire too um
 
04:38:47.631 --> 04:38:47.641 align:start position:0%
with the Canadians and three provinces
 
04:38:48.949 --> 04:38:48.959 align:start position:0%
but that was generally for small
 
04:38:50.510 --> 04:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
businesses in Canada that were doing
 
04:38:52.010 --> 04:38:52.020 align:start position:0%
business in the United States and that's
 
04:38:54.051 --> 04:38:54.061 align:start position:0%
not really what we're talking about here
 
04:38:57.170 --> 04:38:57.180 align:start position:0%
so I I'm puzzled by that that judgment
 
04:39:00.830 --> 04:39:00.840 align:start position:0%
and I've I've heard that before and I
 
04:39:02.449 --> 04:39:02.459 align:start position:0%
would be glad to talk with the
 
04:39:04.310 --> 04:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
Department about the requirements and
 
04:39:06.890 --> 04:39:06.900 align:start position:0%
also to break put them in touch with
 
04:39:11.090 --> 04:39:11.100 align:start position:0%
with actual Auditors from the from that
 
04:39:14.689 --> 04:39:14.699 align:start position:0%
have done worldwide audits before and
 
04:39:17.869 --> 04:39:17.879 align:start position:0%
had a very high professional level
 
04:39:21.769 --> 04:39:21.779 align:start position:0%
um and uh people who who've done this so
 
04:39:26.109 --> 04:39:26.119 align:start position:0%
I hate to I say this make these comments
 
04:39:30.170 --> 04:39:30.180 align:start position:0%
with some uh trepidation or or regret to
 
04:39:32.929 --> 04:39:32.939 align:start position:0%
having to do that because I have such a
 
04:39:36.109 --> 04:39:36.119 align:start position:0%
high regard for any tax auditor at the
 
04:39:38.330 --> 04:39:38.340 align:start position:0%
state level who does corporate auditing
 
04:39:41.510 --> 04:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
and I uh and and I have a great deal and
 
04:39:43.970 --> 04:39:43.980 align:start position:0%
respect for the the Department of
 
04:39:45.770 --> 04:39:45.780 align:start position:0%
Revenue Administration in New Hampshire
 
04:39:48.530 --> 04:39:48.540 align:start position:0%
but I guess we just respectively have a
 
04:39:50.448 --> 04:39:50.458 align:start position:0%
different perspective on this matter
 
04:39:54.230 --> 04:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
okay so thank you I think that's helpful
 
04:39:56.270 --> 04:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
to have a counter sure you skeptical
 
04:39:58.250 --> 04:39:58.260 align:start position:0%
view absolutely you don't have to I
 
04:39:59.270 --> 04:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
don't think there was actually a
 
04:40:00.650 --> 04:40:00.660 align:start position:0%
question to answer but it's food for
 
04:40:02.868 --> 04:40:02.878 align:start position:0%
thought and there may be a value in some
 
04:40:04.788 --> 04:40:04.798 align:start position:0%
further communication directly happy to
 
04:40:08.208 --> 04:40:08.218 align:start position:0%
talk with Dan regardless of what you all
 
04:40:09.708 --> 04:40:09.718 align:start position:0%
recommend to the legislature regardless
 
04:40:11.390 --> 04:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
of what very good okay thank you Mr
 
04:40:11.400 --> 04:40:12.770 align:start position:0%
of what very good okay thank you Mr
bucks

04:40:12.770 --> 04:40:12.780 align:start position:0%
bucks
 
04:40:16.070 --> 04:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:19.490 --> 04:40:19.500 align:start position:0%
all right uh yes representative Hillary
 
04:40:23.270 --> 04:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
I've got two things one
 
04:40:26.208 --> 04:40:26.218 align:start position:0%
you haven't done a global um or combined
 
04:40:26.218 --> 04:40:27.470 align:start position:0%
you haven't done a global um or combined
reporting

04:40:27.470 --> 04:40:27.480 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
04:40:31.788 --> 04:40:31.798 align:start position:0%
activity but you do do guilty ones right
 
04:40:33.590 --> 04:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
04:40:36.708 --> 04:40:36.718 align:start position:0%
um is it I mean I think Carl frieden
 
04:40:39.350 --> 04:40:39.360 align:start position:0%
from cost did a nice job of taking us
 
04:40:43.070 --> 04:40:43.080 align:start position:0%
through how New Hampshire taxes
 
04:40:44.630 --> 04:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
um what folks have been calling oh go
 
04:40:46.788 --> 04:40:46.798 align:start position:0%
ahead go ahead yeah I I understand that
 
04:40:49.368 --> 04:40:49.378 align:start position:0%
what I'm asking for is from your from
 
04:40:50.690 --> 04:40:50.700 align:start position:0%
your point of view
 
04:40:53.990 --> 04:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
how would you do an audit on a guilty uh
 
04:40:54.000 --> 04:40:54.910 align:start position:0%
how would you do an audit on a guilty uh
claim

04:40:54.910 --> 04:40:54.920 align:start position:0%
claim
 
04:40:57.770 --> 04:40:57.780 align:start position:0%
so we have a question and I'm not
 
04:41:00.410 --> 04:41:00.420 align:start position:0%
talking about any specific taxpayer yep
 
04:41:02.930 --> 04:41:02.940 align:start position:0%
uh but I do I think it would benefit the
 
04:41:06.110 --> 04:41:06.120 align:start position:0%
the commission if we were to see uh uh
 
04:41:10.368 --> 04:41:10.378 align:start position:0%
cost analysis of doing that as to your
 
04:41:12.650 --> 04:41:12.660 align:start position:0%
practice and yes and procedure for that
 
04:41:14.690 --> 04:41:14.700 align:start position:0%
so is that something that the chair
 
04:41:25.670 --> 04:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:30.230 --> 04:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
um so yeah uh we audit guilty right now
 
04:41:30.240 --> 04:41:31.730 align:start position:0%
um so yeah uh we audit guilty right now
already

04:41:31.730 --> 04:41:31.740 align:start position:0%
already
 
04:41:34.128 --> 04:41:34.138 align:start position:0%
um and it's
 
04:41:36.050 --> 04:41:36.060 align:start position:0%
relatively inexpensive to do because
 
04:41:38.030 --> 04:41:38.040 align:start position:0%
it's part of our existing audit program
 
04:41:40.788 --> 04:41:40.798 align:start position:0%
because as folks have done a really nice
 
04:41:42.610 --> 04:41:42.620 align:start position:0%
job explaining already
 
04:41:46.190 --> 04:41:46.200 align:start position:0%
we dovetail with the federal returns so
 
04:41:49.070 --> 04:41:49.080 align:start position:0%
we pick up the Federal amounts and what
 
04:41:50.868 --> 04:41:50.878 align:start position:0%
we're largely
 
04:41:54.410 --> 04:41:54.420 align:start position:0%
um confirming at our level is just that
 
04:41:57.230 --> 04:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
they have properly reported it on the
 
04:41:59.510 --> 04:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire return they've not you
 
04:42:01.730 --> 04:42:01.740 align:start position:0%
know inadvertently taken the
 
04:42:04.550 --> 04:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts 95 deduction or they've
 
04:42:06.050 --> 04:42:06.060 align:start position:0%
not omitted it completely from the
 
04:42:08.208 --> 04:42:08.218 align:start position:0%
return we're making sure that it's there
 
04:42:10.910 --> 04:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
we're making sure that um they took the
 
04:42:15.288 --> 04:42:15.298 align:start position:0%
50 deduction if to your question is how
 
04:42:17.150 --> 04:42:17.160 align:start position:0%
would we
 
04:42:21.368 --> 04:42:21.378 align:start position:0%
um audit the substance of the guilty
 
04:42:26.150 --> 04:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
calculation yeah it's and I think as
 
04:42:29.570 --> 04:42:29.580 align:start position:0%
maybe someone mentioned already
 
04:42:29.580 --> 04:42:30.230 align:start position:0%
maybe someone mentioned already
um

04:42:30.230 --> 04:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:33.948 --> 04:42:33.958 align:start position:0%
the the thing about guilty is it's not
 
04:42:35.690 --> 04:42:35.700 align:start position:0%
re it's not really an income class I
 
04:42:38.150 --> 04:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
mean we call it guilty income but it's
 
04:42:40.910 --> 04:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
not like some other types of federal
 
04:42:44.150 --> 04:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
Source income where there's something
 
04:42:46.850 --> 04:42:46.860 align:start position:0%
you can kind of grab onto it's you know
 
04:42:49.010 --> 04:42:49.020 align:start position:0%
royalties or it's the payment of a
 
04:42:52.128 --> 04:42:52.138 align:start position:0%
foreign dividend it's just once income
 
04:42:54.190 --> 04:42:54.200 align:start position:0%
of a controlled foreign corporation
 
04:42:57.770 --> 04:42:57.780 align:start position:0%
exceeds a certain threshold that's
 
04:42:59.570 --> 04:42:59.580 align:start position:0%
defined by the Internal Revenue code
 
04:43:02.030 --> 04:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
that amount is guilty so it's it's
 
04:43:04.010 --> 04:43:04.020 align:start position:0%
pretty easy to audit
 
04:43:06.890 --> 04:43:06.900 align:start position:0%
terrible terrible acronym
 
04:43:09.288 --> 04:43:09.298 align:start position:0%
um but that's the point I was trying to
 
04:43:12.350 --> 04:43:12.360 align:start position:0%
get at is that uh your your analysis of
 
04:43:14.448 --> 04:43:14.458 align:start position:0%
guilty is based upon existing required
 
04:43:18.470 --> 04:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh performance by the taxpayer yes as
 
04:43:20.150 --> 04:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
opposed to
 
04:43:22.430 --> 04:43:22.440 align:start position:0%
um something new that is not required
 
04:43:25.910 --> 04:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
yes you got it and the only reason I I
 
04:43:28.270 --> 04:43:28.280 align:start position:0%
mention that is because in a prior life
 
04:43:33.730 --> 04:43:33.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:37.190 --> 04:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
and they required an on-site examination
 
04:43:43.070 --> 04:43:43.080 align:start position:0%
of all sorts of stuff uh I ours in yep
 
04:43:46.490 --> 04:43:46.500 align:start position:0%
in Registries of Deeds looking up
 
04:43:48.770 --> 04:43:48.780 align:start position:0%
property ownership and stuff yep just to
 
04:43:51.530 --> 04:43:51.540 align:start position:0%
make sure and even currently
 
04:43:55.070 --> 04:43:55.080 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy courts do the same thing yes
 
04:43:58.610 --> 04:43:58.620 align:start position:0%
so I I just I'm trying to understand
 
04:44:00.770 --> 04:44:00.780 align:start position:0%
where one is something that's already
 
04:44:03.170 --> 04:44:03.180 align:start position:0%
there and the other one isn't yeah and
 
04:44:04.670 --> 04:44:04.680 align:start position:0%
now we're talking about something else
 
04:44:07.070 --> 04:44:07.080 align:start position:0%
that so
 
04:44:08.990 --> 04:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
would it be I don't even know if they
 
04:44:11.330 --> 04:44:11.340 align:start position:0%
can do it but
 
04:44:13.310 --> 04:44:13.320 align:start position:0%
or if it would be an extra charge or
 
04:44:15.230 --> 04:44:15.240 align:start position:0%
something but
 
04:44:18.430 --> 04:44:18.440 align:start position:0%
could you outline as to how
 
04:44:20.930 --> 04:44:20.940 align:start position:0%
an audit of
 
04:44:23.390 --> 04:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
a combined reporting activity would take
 
04:44:23.400 --> 04:44:24.530 align:start position:0%
a combined reporting activity would take
place

04:44:24.530 --> 04:44:24.540 align:start position:0%
place
 
04:44:26.990 --> 04:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
from your point of view and combine it
 
04:44:29.090 --> 04:44:29.100 align:start position:0%
with Mr bucks uh
 
04:44:32.510 --> 04:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
information as to how you
 
04:44:35.208 --> 04:44:35.218 align:start position:0%
how would you do it how would it be done
 
04:44:37.910 --> 04:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
and so if I could if I can try to
 
04:44:41.150 --> 04:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
clarify are you suggesting that perhaps
 
04:44:43.368 --> 04:44:43.378 align:start position:0%
they would create an outline of the
 
04:44:45.230 --> 04:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
process they might follow
 
04:44:47.448 --> 04:44:47.458 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for putting words in my
 
04:44:49.730 --> 04:44:49.740 align:start position:0%
mouth could you do that yeah at a very
 
04:44:51.948 --> 04:44:51.958 align:start position:0%
high level we can talk about process
 
04:44:54.650 --> 04:44:54.660 align:start position:0%
right we can talk about audit tactics no
 
04:44:56.448 --> 04:44:56.458 align:start position:0%
yes we can talk about the steps you
 
04:45:00.890 --> 04:45:00.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:05.810 --> 04:45:05.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:07.850 --> 04:45:07.860 align:start position:0%
um okay do we have other questions on
 
04:45:09.170 --> 04:45:09.180 align:start position:0%
the audit
 
04:45:12.830 --> 04:45:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:15.050 --> 04:45:15.060 align:start position:0%
you have more force and feel free to go
 
04:45:18.650 --> 04:45:18.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:21.050 --> 04:45:21.060 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm taking notes Here I
 
04:45:21.060 --> 04:45:22.490 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm taking notes Here I
apologize

04:45:22.490 --> 04:45:22.500 align:start position:0%
apologize
 
04:45:23.868 --> 04:45:23.878 align:start position:0%
um well let's can you repeat that
 
04:45:23.878 --> 04:45:24.770 align:start position:0%
um well let's can you repeat that
question

04:45:24.770 --> 04:45:24.780 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:45:28.430 --> 04:45:28.440 align:start position:0%
I I believe you had more uh uh substance
 
04:45:29.628 --> 04:45:29.638 align:start position:0%
you wanted to go through beyond the
 
04:45:32.150 --> 04:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
audit question yes to the extent itself
 
04:45:33.230 --> 04:45:33.240 align:start position:0%
I just want you to be able to resume
 
04:45:35.628 --> 04:45:35.638 align:start position:0%
yeah yep to the extent it's helpful for
 
04:45:37.610 --> 04:45:37.620 align:start position:0%
folks we can talk
 
04:45:39.590 --> 04:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
um a bit about that and maybe just to
 
04:45:39.600 --> 04:45:40.610 align:start position:0%
um a bit about that and maybe just to
get

04:45:40.610 --> 04:45:40.620 align:start position:0%
get
 
04:45:40.620 --> 04:45:41.150 align:start position:0%
get
um

04:45:41.150 --> 04:45:41.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:42.830 --> 04:45:42.840 align:start position:0%
maybe it's appropriate just to really
 
04:45:46.310 --> 04:45:46.320 align:start position:0%
quickly go through and say at a very
 
04:45:47.930 --> 04:45:47.940 align:start position:0%
high level
 
04:45:49.310 --> 04:45:49.320 align:start position:0%
um just maybe to bring it all together
 
04:45:53.090 --> 04:45:53.100 align:start position:0%
because a lot of folks have talked about
 
04:45:55.550 --> 04:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
um how we taxed in the past what the
 
04:45:57.350 --> 04:45:57.360 align:start position:0%
current system looks like and what we
 
04:45:59.868 --> 04:45:59.878 align:start position:0%
would potentially be moving towards so
 
04:46:02.930 --> 04:46:02.940 align:start position:0%
maybe it's just really helpful to at a
 
04:46:04.190 --> 04:46:04.200 align:start position:0%
very high level just to bring it all
 
04:46:06.110 --> 04:46:06.120 align:start position:0%
back together and I was going to talk
 
04:46:08.330 --> 04:46:08.340 align:start position:0%
more about this but again
 
04:46:10.550 --> 04:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
Mr frieden from cost
 
04:46:12.410 --> 04:46:12.420 align:start position:0%
took the wind out of my sales and said a
 
04:46:14.090 --> 04:46:14.100 align:start position:0%
lot of this already
 
04:46:16.368 --> 04:46:16.378 align:start position:0%
um so I'm not gonna get super granular
 
04:46:17.810 --> 04:46:17.820 align:start position:0%
in the interest of time and be
 
04:46:21.170 --> 04:46:21.180 align:start position:0%
respectful for everybody but um just
 
04:46:24.230 --> 04:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
really quickly to summarize so the the
 
04:46:27.350 --> 04:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
business profits tax was adopted in 1970
 
04:46:29.930 --> 04:46:29.940 align:start position:0%
and we taxed on a separate company basis
 
04:46:31.850 --> 04:46:31.860 align:start position:0%
as folks have talked about there was no
 
04:46:33.470 --> 04:46:33.480 align:start position:0%
combined reporting
 
04:46:36.288 --> 04:46:36.298 align:start position:0%
um and it's my understanding and if we
 
04:46:39.170 --> 04:46:39.180 align:start position:0%
had Peter Garr still here
 
04:46:42.650 --> 04:46:42.660 align:start position:0%
um uh he might remember otherwise but my
 
04:46:44.810 --> 04:46:44.820 align:start position:0%
understanding is that we have
 
04:46:44.820 --> 04:46:46.628 align:start position:0%
understanding is that we have
consistently

04:46:46.628 --> 04:46:46.638 align:start position:0%
consistently
 
04:46:49.850 --> 04:46:49.860 align:start position:0%
included foreign dividends in the tax
 
04:46:52.190 --> 04:46:52.200 align:start position:0%
base since
 
04:46:53.948 --> 04:46:53.958 align:start position:0%
um we were
 
04:46:57.530 --> 04:46:57.540 align:start position:0%
requiring separate company filing
 
04:46:59.330 --> 04:46:59.340 align:start position:0%
then as folks went through in a lot of
 
04:47:01.490 --> 04:47:01.500 align:start position:0%
detail I'm not going to beat a dead
 
04:47:05.330 --> 04:47:05.340 align:start position:0%
horse here New Hampshire moved to
 
04:47:10.490 --> 04:47:10.500 align:start position:0%
um worldwide combined filing in 1981 as
 
04:47:14.170 --> 04:47:14.180 align:start position:0%
Peter Garr explained there was
 
04:47:16.788 --> 04:47:16.798 align:start position:0%
inconsistent application of it at the
 
04:47:20.030 --> 04:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
time due to Department policy as as he
 
04:47:21.830 --> 04:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
um said it was the commissioner's policy
 
04:47:26.150 --> 04:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
I I wasn't there but it is it is true
 
04:47:29.470 --> 04:47:29.480 align:start position:0%
that the department was not requiring
 
04:47:32.810 --> 04:47:32.820 align:start position:0%
worldwide combination of foreign
 
04:47:36.708 --> 04:47:36.718 align:start position:0%
parented companies and as Mr Garr and
 
04:47:38.270 --> 04:47:38.280 align:start position:0%
others have said it was because of the
 
04:47:40.850 --> 04:47:40.860 align:start position:0%
perceived litigation risk essentially I
 
04:47:42.830 --> 04:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
think the determination was we don't
 
04:47:44.810 --> 04:47:44.820 align:start position:0%
want to have a bunch of income or a
 
04:47:47.330 --> 04:47:47.340 align:start position:0%
bunch of tax paid in that we'll just
 
04:47:49.310 --> 04:47:49.320 align:start position:0%
have to refund out if this litigation
 
04:47:51.830 --> 04:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
goes south so there was whatever the
 
04:47:54.050 --> 04:47:54.060 align:start position:0%
reason whether that's true or not there
 
04:47:55.970 --> 04:47:55.980 align:start position:0%
was a department policy not to enforce
 
04:47:59.390 --> 04:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
it inconsistent application and then in
 
04:48:03.110 --> 04:48:03.120 align:start position:0%
1986 we uh we moved to the New Hampshire
 
04:48:06.010 --> 04:48:06.020 align:start position:0%
moved to Water's Edge combined reporting
 
04:48:08.990 --> 04:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
which as folks have said we've been
 
04:48:12.590 --> 04:48:12.600 align:start position:0%
there ever since eventually moving from
 
04:48:14.930 --> 04:48:14.940 align:start position:0%
um three Factor apportionment to to just
 
04:48:17.510 --> 04:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
sales not super relevant for what we're
 
04:48:18.948 --> 04:48:18.958 align:start position:0%
talking about today
 
04:48:21.708 --> 04:48:21.718 align:start position:0%
and then as other folks have mentioned
 
04:48:24.288 --> 04:48:24.298 align:start position:0%
we do include
 
04:48:24.298 --> 04:48:25.850 align:start position:0%
we do include
um

04:48:25.850 --> 04:48:25.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:28.490 --> 04:48:28.500 align:start position:0%
income in the tax base that folks are
 
04:48:30.470 --> 04:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
considering foreign Source income this
 
04:48:34.730 --> 04:48:34.740 align:start position:0%
is all income that either right now or
 
04:48:38.350 --> 04:48:38.360 align:start position:0%
at least in the past has been treated as
 
04:48:41.448 --> 04:48:41.458 align:start position:0%
income includable in the domestic base
 
04:48:44.510 --> 04:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
for federal income tax purposes so this
 
04:48:46.670 --> 04:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
is consistent with traditional income
 
04:48:49.128 --> 04:48:49.138 align:start position:0%
tax Concepts as folks said foreign
 
04:48:51.230 --> 04:48:51.240 align:start position:0%
dividends and the simplest way to it's
 
04:48:53.030 --> 04:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
pretty I think it's a pretty simple
 
04:48:55.128 --> 04:48:55.138 align:start position:0%
concept when you break it all down when
 
04:48:57.650 --> 04:48:57.660 align:start position:0%
you've got a company here domestically
 
04:48:59.570 --> 04:48:59.580 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the United States
 
04:49:02.208 --> 04:49:02.218 align:start position:0%
and they receive a dividend from one of
 
04:49:04.788 --> 04:49:04.798 align:start position:0%
their subsidiaries anywhere else in the
 
04:49:07.190 --> 04:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
country that comes into the tax base and
 
04:49:10.010 --> 04:49:10.020 align:start position:0%
we tax it it does get and again that
 
04:49:12.948 --> 04:49:12.958 align:start position:0%
that has been the case in my belief
 
04:49:14.690 --> 04:49:14.700 align:start position:0%
since the enactment of the business
 
04:49:17.868 --> 04:49:17.878 align:start position:0%
profits tax it does get preferential
 
04:49:19.430 --> 04:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
apportionment so it gets better
 
04:49:21.590 --> 04:49:21.600 align:start position:0%
apportionment those foreign dividends
 
04:49:24.470 --> 04:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
get taxpayer favorable apportionment
 
04:49:27.110 --> 04:49:27.120 align:start position:0%
compared to any other source of income
 
04:49:29.030 --> 04:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
they essentially get to use the
 
04:49:31.850 --> 04:49:31.860 align:start position:0%
apportionment factors of the dividend
 
04:49:34.850 --> 04:49:34.860 align:start position:0%
payer they get to use the factors of
 
04:49:38.090 --> 04:49:38.100 align:start position:0%
that foreign affiliate that's paying the
 
04:49:40.250 --> 04:49:40.260 align:start position:0%
dividend to
 
04:49:43.128 --> 04:49:43.138 align:start position:0%
um essentially put those factors into
 
04:49:45.410 --> 04:49:45.420 align:start position:0%
the denominator of the apportionment
 
04:49:47.750 --> 04:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
fraction so you got the the amount that
 
04:49:49.910 --> 04:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
was paid you have to apportion it by a
 
04:49:52.430 --> 04:49:52.440 align:start position:0%
fraction you multiply it by a fraction
 
04:49:55.610 --> 04:49:55.620 align:start position:0%
the denominator gets bigger so the the
 
04:49:57.830 --> 04:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
resulting apportionment is smaller
 
04:49:59.930 --> 04:49:59.940 align:start position:0%
because it takes into consideration
 
04:50:02.150 --> 04:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
those foreign attributes when we're
 
04:50:03.650 --> 04:50:03.660 align:start position:0%
apportioning that so it gets favorable
 
04:50:03.660 --> 04:50:05.330 align:start position:0%
apportioning that so it gets favorable
apportionment

04:50:05.330 --> 04:50:05.340 align:start position:0%
apportionment
 
04:50:07.930 --> 04:50:07.940 align:start position:0%
um and as far as how why New Hampshire
 
04:50:10.910 --> 04:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
still does this as opposed to not
 
04:50:13.310 --> 04:50:13.320 align:start position:0%
again we don't take any positions on
 
04:50:15.470 --> 04:50:15.480 align:start position:0%
what's what you folks should be doing or
 
04:50:19.430 --> 04:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
not the the rationale that you all faced
 
04:50:21.890 --> 04:50:21.900 align:start position:0%
when the
 
04:50:23.570 --> 04:50:23.580 align:start position:0%
um United States at the federal level
 
04:50:27.410 --> 04:50:27.420 align:start position:0%
was uh or had just passed the tax cuts
 
04:50:29.170 --> 04:50:29.180 align:start position:0%
and jobs act in 2018
 
04:50:33.650 --> 04:50:33.660 align:start position:0%
when the the federal income uh the
 
04:50:35.750 --> 04:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
federal Internal Revenue code was
 
04:50:39.410 --> 04:50:39.420 align:start position:0%
reformed the there was a decision for
 
04:50:41.270 --> 04:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to make
 
04:50:44.810 --> 04:50:44.820 align:start position:0%
do we want to conform to what Folks at
 
04:50:47.448 --> 04:50:47.458 align:start position:0%
the time called this deemed repatriation
 
04:50:49.970 --> 04:50:49.980 align:start position:0%
in other words and I I forget if it was
 
04:50:52.430 --> 04:50:52.440 align:start position:0%
uh Carl or whomever Professor
 
04:50:55.310 --> 04:50:55.320 align:start position:0%
hellerstein but um
 
04:50:59.708 --> 04:50:59.718 align:start position:0%
the at the federal level the uh Congress
 
04:51:04.990 --> 04:51:05.000 align:start position:0%
the IRS have retreated from the uh
 
04:51:08.170 --> 04:51:08.180 align:start position:0%
worldwide base to the territorial base
 
04:51:11.628 --> 04:51:11.638 align:start position:0%
and as part of that
 
04:51:12.650 --> 04:51:12.660 align:start position:0%
um as
 
04:51:16.090 --> 04:51:16.100 align:start position:0%
Carl said they would no longer be taxing
 
04:51:18.708 --> 04:51:18.718 align:start position:0%
foreign dividends the idea being to
 
04:51:20.990 --> 04:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
incentivize it to incentivize those
 
04:51:24.590 --> 04:51:24.600 align:start position:0%
companies to bring the cash back to
 
04:51:29.030 --> 04:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
America but to uh reduce the bleeding
 
04:51:31.850 --> 04:51:31.860 align:start position:0%
there would be a one-timed deemed
 
04:51:34.368 --> 04:51:34.378 align:start position:0%
repatriation event where
 
04:51:36.288 --> 04:51:36.298 align:start position:0%
um like the Congress and the IRS are
 
04:51:39.590 --> 04:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
going to say okay sure we know you're
 
04:51:41.868 --> 04:51:41.878 align:start position:0%
not actually paying a foreign dividend
 
04:51:44.150 --> 04:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
we know that cash is not it's not moving
 
04:51:45.890 --> 04:51:45.900 align:start position:0%
out of Ireland or the Caymans or
 
04:51:48.110 --> 04:51:48.120 align:start position:0%
wherever it is China it's still there
 
04:51:50.510 --> 04:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
but we're going to treat that cash as
 
04:51:51.948 --> 04:51:51.958 align:start position:0%
having moved here and we're going to tax
 
04:51:53.628 --> 04:51:53.638 align:start position:0%
it this one time
 
04:51:56.990 --> 04:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
so New Hampshire was faced with a policy
 
04:52:00.288 --> 04:52:00.298 align:start position:0%
decision there do we want to conform to
 
04:52:02.448 --> 04:52:02.458 align:start position:0%
that and glom on to that big pot of
 
04:52:05.570 --> 04:52:05.580 align:start position:0%
money or do we want to keep getting our
 
04:52:07.788 --> 04:52:07.798 align:start position:0%
steady kind of annuity every year of a
 
04:52:09.470 --> 04:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
little bit of foreign dividends every
 
04:52:12.288 --> 04:52:12.298 align:start position:0%
year like we've always got one of the
 
04:52:16.310 --> 04:52:16.320 align:start position:0%
other and I think and I cannot speak for
 
04:52:18.230 --> 04:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
all of you this was a legislative
 
04:52:21.948 --> 04:52:21.958 align:start position:0%
decision I think the the rationale was
 
04:52:25.070 --> 04:52:25.080 align:start position:0%
that from a budget perspective it's
 
04:52:27.948 --> 04:52:27.958 align:start position:0%
harder to manage the general fund with a
 
04:52:31.550 --> 04:52:31.560 align:start position:0%
one-time enormous you know cash payment
 
04:52:34.490 --> 04:52:34.500 align:start position:0%
as opposed to a steady much much much
 
04:52:37.430 --> 04:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
smaller annuity over time and so I think
 
04:52:39.368 --> 04:52:39.378 align:start position:0%
it was just perceived to be a steady
 
04:52:42.350 --> 04:52:42.360 align:start position:0%
Revenue Source over time so that's the
 
04:52:43.610 --> 04:52:43.620 align:start position:0%
reason why New Hampshire did it
 
04:52:48.170 --> 04:52:48.180 align:start position:0%
differently there it's not that we're uh
 
04:52:50.448 --> 04:52:50.458 align:start position:0%
we sort of made up this this concept
 
04:52:52.368 --> 04:52:52.378 align:start position:0%
that doesn't exist we just kept kept
 
04:52:55.010 --> 04:52:55.020 align:start position:0%
what we had because we we foregoed we
 
04:52:56.868 --> 04:52:56.878 align:start position:0%
went without the deemed repatriation and
 
04:52:58.190 --> 04:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
just said we'll get it all as it comes
 
04:52:59.628 --> 04:52:59.638 align:start position:0%
back slowly
 
04:53:01.070 --> 04:53:01.080 align:start position:0%
and then as folks have already talked
 
04:53:03.650 --> 04:53:03.660 align:start position:0%
about we get subpart F we get we get
 
04:53:05.628 --> 04:53:05.638 align:start position:0%
guilty so I'm not gonna you did a much
 
04:53:08.030 --> 04:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
better job summarizing summarizing it
 
04:53:09.288 --> 04:53:09.298 align:start position:0%
than I can and in the interest of time
 
04:53:10.670 --> 04:53:10.680 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to say any more about that
 
04:53:12.530 --> 04:53:12.540 align:start position:0%
so I just thought I would briefly
 
04:53:15.288 --> 04:53:15.298 align:start position:0%
mention all of that and probably the
 
04:53:17.570 --> 04:53:17.580 align:start position:0%
only other thing that's worth getting at
 
04:53:19.670 --> 04:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
um worth mentioning
 
04:53:22.430 --> 04:53:22.440 align:start position:0%
because uh there has been so much talk
 
04:53:22.440 --> 04:53:23.448 align:start position:0%
because uh there has been so much talk
about

04:53:23.448 --> 04:53:23.458 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:53:23.458 --> 04:53:24.230 align:start position:0%
about
um

04:53:24.230 --> 04:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:26.448 --> 04:53:26.458 align:start position:0%
profit shifting and abuses and all of
 
04:53:27.770 --> 04:53:27.780 align:start position:0%
that I guess the only other thing I
 
04:53:30.230 --> 04:53:30.240 align:start position:0%
would put in front of folks is we the
 
04:53:31.970 --> 04:53:31.980 align:start position:0%
dra in particular but New Hampshire
 
04:53:34.610 --> 04:53:34.620 align:start position:0%
generally and through the arm of the dra
 
04:53:37.070 --> 04:53:37.080 align:start position:0%
through through us as your agents
 
04:53:39.890 --> 04:53:39.900 align:start position:0%
um we do have a few other tools that we
 
04:53:43.070 --> 04:53:43.080 align:start position:0%
can use to combat abuses we have these
 
04:53:45.530 --> 04:53:45.540 align:start position:0%
theories called substance over form we
 
04:53:47.690 --> 04:53:47.700 align:start position:0%
have this Theory called economic
 
04:53:49.670 --> 04:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
substance where the the substance of
 
04:53:51.288 --> 04:53:51.298 align:start position:0%
what's going on is gonna is gonna
 
04:53:55.310 --> 04:53:55.320 align:start position:0%
actually govern what what uh matters
 
04:53:58.010 --> 04:53:58.020 align:start position:0%
um although the burden is against us in
 
04:53:59.990 --> 04:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
those situations so normally the
 
04:54:02.090 --> 04:54:02.100 align:start position:0%
taxpayer has Bears the burden under
 
04:54:04.190 --> 04:54:04.200 align:start position:0%
audit if the department wants to assert
 
04:54:06.050 --> 04:54:06.060 align:start position:0%
these theories we have the burden to to
 
04:54:09.650 --> 04:54:09.660 align:start position:0%
prove that no it's in fact the this is
 
04:54:11.208 --> 04:54:11.218 align:start position:0%
the substance of what's Happening not
 
04:54:12.890 --> 04:54:12.900 align:start position:0%
the form so that's the only other thing
 
04:54:14.030 --> 04:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
I think I would put in front of folks
 
04:54:15.890 --> 04:54:15.900 align:start position:0%
that I didn't hear mentioned
 
04:54:17.570 --> 04:54:17.580 align:start position:0%
um and then there are a few other
 
04:54:20.810 --> 04:54:20.820 align:start position:0%
Equitable apportionment theories if we
 
04:54:24.730 --> 04:54:24.740 align:start position:0%
believe that um the taxpayers uh
 
04:54:26.868 --> 04:54:26.878 align:start position:0%
statutorily allowed apportionment
 
04:54:29.150 --> 04:54:29.160 align:start position:0%
somehow doesn't fairly and appropriately
 
04:54:31.490 --> 04:54:31.500 align:start position:0%
reflect their activity here in New
 
04:54:33.890 --> 04:54:33.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we can change it to be
 
04:54:36.530 --> 04:54:36.540 align:start position:0%
completely outside of what the statutes
 
04:54:39.830 --> 04:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
require but again we bear the burden to
 
04:54:41.750 --> 04:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
show that whatever we've come up with is
 
04:54:43.610 --> 04:54:43.620 align:start position:0%
the appropriate methodology and you can
 
04:54:44.628 --> 04:54:44.638 align:start position:0%
bet they're gonna
 
04:54:46.190 --> 04:54:46.200 align:start position:0%
they're going to dispute that and and
 
04:54:49.368 --> 04:54:49.378 align:start position:0%
sue us because you know we're going
 
04:54:50.750 --> 04:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
completely outside of the statute and we
 
04:54:52.550 --> 04:54:52.560 align:start position:0%
bear the burden there so just some
 
04:54:56.750 --> 04:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:59.270 --> 04:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
okay very good guest representative
 
04:54:59.280 --> 04:55:01.490 align:start position:0%
okay very good guest representative
Valerie

04:55:01.490 --> 04:55:01.500 align:start position:0%
Valerie
 
04:55:03.830 --> 04:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
the question I've been asking regarding
 
04:55:05.990 --> 04:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
pre and post
 
04:55:11.810 --> 04:55:11.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:11.820 --> 04:55:14.208 align:start position:0%
 
situation

04:55:14.208 --> 04:55:14.218 align:start position:0%
situation
 
04:55:17.628 --> 04:55:17.638 align:start position:0%
the percentage of the uh taxable Revenue
 
04:55:19.610 --> 04:55:19.620 align:start position:0%
received by the state from business
 
04:55:25.550 --> 04:55:25.560 align:start position:0%
taxes 1981 to 1986 versus after they
 
04:55:28.610 --> 04:55:28.620 align:start position:0%
change that took place in 86. is that
 
04:55:30.288 --> 04:55:30.298 align:start position:0%
something that
 
04:55:35.150 --> 04:55:35.160 align:start position:0%
Dre can come up with is it available or
 
04:55:38.628 --> 04:55:38.638 align:start position:0%
I I don't think so yeah Keen would know
 
04:55:39.948 --> 04:55:39.958 align:start position:0%
better than me so just I was in
 
04:55:42.890 --> 04:55:42.900 align:start position:0%
kindergarten but I'll pass this over to
 
04:55:46.070 --> 04:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:47.750 --> 04:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
um regarding that I'm not really sure if
 
04:55:50.150 --> 04:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
we do have records that go so far back
 
04:55:52.070 --> 04:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
and even so
 
04:55:52.080 --> 04:55:53.448 align:start position:0%
and even so
um

04:55:53.448 --> 04:55:53.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:55.850 --> 04:55:55.860 align:start position:0%
whether were there any calculations that
 
04:55:58.190 --> 04:55:58.200 align:start position:0%
was prepared because there are two ways
 
04:55:59.810 --> 04:55:59.820 align:start position:0%
of getting that information one is if
 
04:56:02.750 --> 04:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
you have the raw data back in 86 and
 
04:56:05.810 --> 04:56:05.820 align:start position:0%
after and then we'll we will calculate
 
04:56:05.820 --> 04:56:07.510 align:start position:0%
after and then we'll we will calculate
uh

04:56:07.510 --> 04:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:56:11.090 --> 04:56:11.100 align:start position:0%
fiscal analysis on that the other uh
 
04:56:13.550 --> 04:56:13.560 align:start position:0%
approach is it calculations calculations
 
04:56:15.890 --> 04:56:15.900 align:start position:0%
were already done back then and we would
 
04:56:17.390 --> 04:56:17.400 align:start position:0%
just pick up that uh that information
 
04:56:21.708 --> 04:56:21.718 align:start position:0%
and and disclose that so um I personally
 
04:56:23.930 --> 04:56:23.940 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer but I can
 
04:56:25.730 --> 04:56:25.740 align:start position:0%
definitely look back to see if we have
 
04:56:27.530 --> 04:56:27.540 align:start position:0%
any kind of uh information in our
 
04:56:30.170 --> 04:56:30.180 align:start position:0%
archives or something like that we would
 
04:56:31.730 --> 04:56:31.740 align:start position:0%
very much appreciate you investigating
 
04:56:33.830 --> 04:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
whether there is information that can be
 
04:56:33.840 --> 04:56:34.970 align:start position:0%
whether there is information that can be
found

04:56:34.970 --> 04:56:34.980 align:start position:0%
found
 
04:56:34.980 --> 04:56:36.050 align:start position:0%
found
uh

04:56:36.050 --> 04:56:36.060 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:56:36.060 --> 04:56:38.390 align:start position:0%
uh
okay

04:56:38.390 --> 04:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:56:38.400 --> 04:56:40.070 align:start position:0%
okay
yes

04:56:40.070 --> 04:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:56:42.948 --> 04:56:42.958 align:start position:0%
I I know I've asked before but there's
 
04:56:45.830 --> 04:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
no way really to comp the the premise is
 
04:56:47.628 --> 04:56:47.638 align:start position:0%
that if we if New Hampshire moved to
 
04:56:51.350 --> 04:56:51.360 align:start position:0%
worldwide reporting that the um the
 
04:56:53.930 --> 04:56:53.940 align:start position:0%
transfer stuff the the income would come
 
04:56:55.550 --> 04:56:55.560 align:start position:0%
back in theory though we don't know the
 
04:56:57.170 --> 04:56:57.180 align:start position:0%
numbers because we have the guilty
 
04:56:58.970 --> 04:56:58.980 align:start position:0%
income that you don't have enough
 
04:57:02.270 --> 04:57:02.280 align:start position:0%
information to actually even quantify or
 
04:57:04.490 --> 04:57:04.500 align:start position:0%
speculate how those numbers might come
 
04:57:04.500 --> 04:57:06.410 align:start position:0%
speculate how those numbers might come
out

04:57:06.410 --> 04:57:06.420 align:start position:0%
out
 
04:57:10.250 --> 04:57:10.260 align:start position:0%
uh now we try to calculate that
 
04:57:10.260 --> 04:57:12.050 align:start position:0%
uh now we try to calculate that
um in

04:57:12.050 --> 04:57:12.060 align:start position:0%
um in
 
04:57:14.090 --> 04:57:14.100 align:start position:0%
one of the few reasons is because guilty
 
04:57:15.590 --> 04:57:15.600 align:start position:0%
is part of the is part of the federal
 
04:57:18.288 --> 04:57:18.298 align:start position:0%
return and it's flowing through into the
 
04:57:21.530 --> 04:57:21.540 align:start position:0%
um to the New Hampshire return we don't
 
04:57:23.628 --> 04:57:23.638 align:start position:0%
pass out data that's on the federal
 
04:57:26.510 --> 04:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
return specifically on on our system so
 
04:57:28.910 --> 04:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
we just pick up the the flow through
 
04:57:30.650 --> 04:57:30.660 align:start position:0%
that's directly from line 28 right into
 
04:57:32.150 --> 04:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
the federal return to the New Hampshire
 
04:57:32.160 --> 04:57:33.890 align:start position:0%
the federal return to the New Hampshire
return

04:57:33.890 --> 04:57:33.900 align:start position:0%
return
 
04:57:37.128 --> 04:57:37.138 align:start position:0%
um we might be able to somehow back into
 
04:57:40.190 --> 04:57:40.200 align:start position:0%
that number but our system currently do
 
04:57:42.770 --> 04:57:42.780 align:start position:0%
not have that um that mapped out at this
 
04:57:45.288 --> 04:57:45.298 align:start position:0%
point and if we were to do that that
 
04:57:48.288 --> 04:57:48.298 align:start position:0%
would that would not be like a next day
 
04:57:51.050 --> 04:57:51.060 align:start position:0%
turnaround kind of thing we may not the
 
04:57:52.910 --> 04:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
data the returns that have already been
 
04:57:54.650 --> 04:57:54.660 align:start position:0%
submitted we won't be able to get that
 
04:57:56.390 --> 04:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
data we'll have to be a going forward
 
04:57:56.400 --> 04:58:00.470 align:start position:0%
data we'll have to be a going forward
basis

04:58:00.470 --> 04:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:02.570 --> 04:58:02.580 align:start position:0%
and presumably that would require some
 
04:58:05.448 --> 04:58:05.458 align:start position:0%
changes to how our system works
 
04:58:05.458 --> 04:58:06.350 align:start position:0%
changes to how our system works
so

04:58:06.350 --> 04:58:06.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:58:06.360 --> 04:58:07.070 align:start position:0%
so
um

04:58:07.070 --> 04:58:07.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:08.810 --> 04:58:08.820 align:start position:0%
I think he did a very effective job at
 
04:58:10.910 --> 04:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
running through some of what the audit
 
04:58:13.128 --> 04:58:13.138 align:start position:0%
challenges might be
 
04:58:16.128 --> 04:58:16.138 align:start position:0%
if if we stipulate for the moments
 
04:58:16.138 --> 04:58:17.208 align:start position:0%
if if we stipulate for the moments
you've

04:58:17.208 --> 04:58:17.218 align:start position:0%
you've
 
04:58:20.030 --> 04:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
done an audit and you've made an
 
04:58:20.040 --> 04:58:22.010 align:start position:0%
done an audit and you've made an
assessment

04:58:22.010 --> 04:58:22.020 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
04:58:25.128 --> 04:58:25.138 align:start position:0%
um and the taxpayers challenging your
 
04:58:25.138 --> 04:58:27.288 align:start position:0%
um and the taxpayers challenging your
conclusion

04:58:27.288 --> 04:58:27.298 align:start position:0%
conclusion
 
04:58:31.610 --> 04:58:31.620 align:start position:0%
what if any particularly unusual hurdles
 
04:58:34.128 --> 04:58:34.138 align:start position:0%
are you likely to find in the
 
04:58:36.770 --> 04:58:36.780 align:start position:0%
enforcement action or in the potential
 
04:58:38.750 --> 04:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
for litigation or do you think it's just
 
04:58:41.628 --> 04:58:41.638 align:start position:0%
business as usual and no different
 
04:58:44.930 --> 04:58:44.940 align:start position:0%
that's that's a great question I uh I
 
04:58:47.030 --> 04:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
think the short answer is
 
04:58:48.948 --> 04:58:48.958 align:start position:0%
we do expect
 
04:58:53.690 --> 04:58:53.700 align:start position:0%
that to be relatively business as usual
 
04:58:53.700 --> 04:58:56.570 align:start position:0%
that to be relatively business as usual
um

04:58:56.570 --> 04:58:56.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:59.030 --> 04:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
presumably if
 
04:58:59.040 --> 04:58:59.770 align:start position:0%
presumably if
um

04:58:59.770 --> 04:58:59.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:01.970 --> 04:59:01.980 align:start position:0%
taxpayers have
 
04:59:04.788 --> 04:59:04.798 align:start position:0%
very little in the way of people and
 
04:59:06.948 --> 04:59:06.958 align:start position:0%
property here
 
04:59:08.930 --> 04:59:08.940 align:start position:0%
um some some of our more aggressive
 
04:59:11.270 --> 04:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
incentives for getting compliance won't
 
04:59:13.010 --> 04:59:13.020 align:start position:0%
work we can't lean them up for example
 
04:59:15.590 --> 04:59:15.600 align:start position:0%
if they don't have a lot here
 
04:59:18.110 --> 04:59:18.120 align:start position:0%
um so there could be some enforcement
 
04:59:19.750 --> 04:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
challenges there
 
04:59:22.970 --> 04:59:22.980 align:start position:0%
uh I think our our expectation is for
 
04:59:24.830 --> 04:59:24.840 align:start position:0%
most folks it would be relatively
 
04:59:24.840 --> 04:59:29.810 align:start position:0%
most folks it would be relatively
similar

04:59:29.810 --> 04:59:29.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:33.350 --> 04:59:33.360 align:start position:0%
very good well thank you very much dra
 
04:59:35.208 --> 04:59:35.218 align:start position:0%
um thank you to everybody who's
 
04:59:38.510 --> 04:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
participated today I see that uh Mr
 
04:59:41.570 --> 04:59:41.580 align:start position:0%
posefsky is still monitored this we have
 
04:59:45.170 --> 04:59:45.180 align:start position:0%
uh all the way back to uh Mr Opel and
 
04:59:47.690 --> 04:59:47.700 align:start position:0%
comrades you've stayed with us
 
04:59:47.700 --> 04:59:48.410 align:start position:0%
comrades you've stayed with us
um

04:59:48.410 --> 04:59:48.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:51.170 --> 04:59:51.180 align:start position:0%
and I don't see if Professor hillerstein
 
04:59:54.190 --> 04:59:54.200 align:start position:0%
is still there but but Mr frieden
 
04:59:57.530 --> 04:59:57.540 align:start position:0%
Miss Beeson thank you very much this has
 
04:59:59.990 --> 05:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
been a marathon I have to say that uh
 
05:00:01.730 --> 05:00:01.740 align:start position:0%
when we had our organization meeting in
 
05:00:03.170 --> 05:00:03.180 align:start position:0%
August we thought we would do this over
 
05:00:05.270 --> 05:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
two sessions I think it's been
 
05:00:07.610 --> 05:00:07.620 align:start position:0%
wonderfully efficient so as long as
 
05:00:09.530 --> 05:00:09.540 align:start position:0%
we've got the stamina this is a good way
 
05:00:11.390 --> 05:00:11.400 align:start position:0%
to do to do it
 
05:00:13.128 --> 05:00:13.138 align:start position:0%
um if I can just take a couple of
 
05:00:13.138 --> 05:00:14.448 align:start position:0%
um if I can just take a couple of
minutes

05:00:14.448 --> 05:00:14.458 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
05:00:17.570 --> 05:00:17.580 align:start position:0%
I want to make sure that everybody uh
 
05:00:21.110 --> 05:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
knows we have two more meetings of the
 
05:00:23.330 --> 05:00:23.340 align:start position:0%
commission that have been properly
 
05:00:25.910 --> 05:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
noticed and are on the house calendar at
 
05:00:30.170 --> 05:00:30.180 align:start position:0%
10 A.M on Monday October 2nd
 
05:00:35.750 --> 05:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
and then again 10 a.m on October 17th
 
05:00:38.510 --> 05:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
um it's hard to forecast exactly how
 
05:00:40.490 --> 05:00:40.500 align:start position:0%
things will flow but uh what I'm
 
05:00:43.368 --> 05:00:43.378 align:start position:0%
envisioning is that when we meet next
 
05:00:46.550 --> 05:00:46.560 align:start position:0%
Monday uh the members of the commission
 
05:00:49.550 --> 05:00:49.560 align:start position:0%
will Air everything that we've heard get
 
05:00:52.250 --> 05:00:52.260 align:start position:0%
everything onto the table uh ask each
 
05:00:54.650 --> 05:00:54.660 align:start position:0%
other questions determine whether
 
05:00:56.750 --> 05:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
there's information that we need to run
 
05:00:59.090 --> 05:00:59.100 align:start position:0%
down and how we're going to get it who
 
05:01:00.910 --> 05:01:00.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to look to
 
05:01:03.590 --> 05:01:03.600 align:start position:0%
Akeem of course will be part of that
 
05:01:06.890 --> 05:01:06.900 align:start position:0%
discussion as a member and Mr Cool broth
 
05:01:09.170 --> 05:01:09.180 align:start position:0%
I would strongly encourage you to be
 
05:01:11.330 --> 05:01:11.340 align:start position:0%
present in the event of questions that
 
05:01:14.390 --> 05:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
might arise during that also I was asked
 
05:01:17.030 --> 05:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
earlier and we agreed we're going to
 
05:01:19.010 --> 05:01:19.020 align:start position:0%
arrange to live stream
 
05:01:21.288 --> 05:01:21.298 align:start position:0%
so again the audience for this
 
05:01:24.590 --> 05:01:24.600 align:start position:0%
discussion is is varied and includes
 
05:01:26.090 --> 05:01:26.100 align:start position:0%
people who aren't even in New Hampshire
 
05:01:28.490 --> 05:01:28.500 align:start position:0%
anybody who participated today can
 
05:01:31.190 --> 05:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
therefore monitor the discussion and see
 
05:01:32.810 --> 05:01:32.820 align:start position:0%
whether we've mangled the point you've
 
05:01:32.820 --> 05:01:34.730 align:start position:0%
whether we've mangled the point you've
made

05:01:34.730 --> 05:01:34.740 align:start position:0%
made
 
05:01:37.490 --> 05:01:37.500 align:start position:0%
um and and I would also say that of
 
05:01:40.448 --> 05:01:40.458 align:start position:0%
course representative Schamberg's bill
 
05:01:43.368 --> 05:01:43.378 align:start position:0%
hb121 has been retained in the ways and
 
05:01:45.650 --> 05:01:45.660 align:start position:0%
memes committee and it's part of the
 
05:01:47.090 --> 05:01:47.100 align:start position:0%
plan for the ways and means to
 
05:01:50.990 --> 05:01:51.000 align:start position:0%
deliberate on that before our reporting
 
05:01:54.410 --> 05:01:54.420 align:start position:0%
deadline of November 17th so I'm very
 
05:01:54.420 --> 05:01:55.730 align:start position:0%
deadline of November 17th so I'm very
hopeful

05:01:55.730 --> 05:01:55.740 align:start position:0%
hopeful
 
05:01:58.850 --> 05:01:58.860 align:start position:0%
that we know what the issues are and
 
05:02:00.770 --> 05:02:00.780 align:start position:0%
more or less what direction we're going
 
05:02:03.890 --> 05:02:03.900 align:start position:0%
by the time we finish on October 2nd
 
05:02:05.750 --> 05:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
it's possible that we'll be far enough
 
05:02:07.610 --> 05:02:07.620 align:start position:0%
along that we actually work on some
 
05:02:11.390 --> 05:02:11.400 align:start position:0%
drafts of the report uh and might have
 
05:02:13.490 --> 05:02:13.500 align:start position:0%
that in front of us on October 17th but
 
05:02:15.110 --> 05:02:15.120 align:start position:0%
in any event I would expect that on
 
05:02:19.368 --> 05:02:19.378 align:start position:0%
October 17th we would nail down the
 
05:02:21.470 --> 05:02:21.480 align:start position:0%
direction and scope
 
05:02:23.628 --> 05:02:23.638 align:start position:0%
of the commit the commission's report
 
05:02:26.930 --> 05:02:26.940 align:start position:0%
and I would just add that we don't yet
 
05:02:28.730 --> 05:02:28.740 align:start position:0%
know whether we'll have a unified Voice
 
05:02:31.128 --> 05:02:31.138 align:start position:0%
or a divided voice but our process
 
05:02:34.750 --> 05:02:34.760 align:start position:0%
allows for a majority and a Minority
 
05:02:38.868 --> 05:02:38.878 align:start position:0%
Report and I'm hoping that we're going
 
05:02:41.510 --> 05:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
to be able to get those together a week
 
05:02:43.910 --> 05:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
or two in advance of our November 1st
 
05:02:45.650 --> 05:02:45.660 align:start position:0%
deadline so that the Ways and Means
 
05:02:48.530 --> 05:02:48.540 align:start position:0%
Committee can do something with our
 
05:02:48.540 --> 05:02:49.670 align:start position:0%
Committee can do something with our
report

05:02:49.670 --> 05:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
report
 
05:02:56.390 --> 05:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:58.250 --> 05:02:58.260 align:start position:0%
thank you for the remarkable level of
 
05:03:00.590 --> 05:03:00.600 align:start position:0%
cooperation all around
 
05:03:07.910 --> 05:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:10.970 --> 05:03:10.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:10.980 --> 05:03:13.340 align:start position:0%
 
yourself
