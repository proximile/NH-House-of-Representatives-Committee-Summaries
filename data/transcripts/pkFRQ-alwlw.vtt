00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:00.529 --> 00:07:00.539 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative Hudson would you
 
00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:24.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh everybody here
 
00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:31.919 align:start position:0%
you're missing who are we missing Renee
 
00:07:34.249 --> 00:07:34.259 align:start position:0%
well Renee
 
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
and oh no Allison hi Allison
 
00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.589 align:start position:0%
and oh no Allison hi Allison
um

00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
who is Beth
 
00:07:46.249 --> 00:07:46.259 align:start position:0%
okay he may be coming for the exact
 
00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:49.020 align:start position:0%
session and not the work session
 
00:07:53.029 --> 00:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
um So the plan is here uh for a couple
 
00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:54.900 align:start position:0%
of hours to have open
 
00:07:57.589 --> 00:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
um a work session on Two Bills
 
00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:01.500 align:start position:0%
um one is House Bill 301 and one is
 
00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
House Bill 157 I think right
 
00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.370 align:start position:0%
House Bill 157 I think right
um

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:07.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:10.189 --> 00:08:10.199 align:start position:0%
I don't care if we set this up for an
 
00:08:13.129 --> 00:08:13.139 align:start position:0%
hour or an hour for each bill
 
00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
um I don't particularly I'm letting this
 
00:08:18.529 --> 00:08:18.539 align:start position:0%
Freewheel we have a couple of uh guests
 
00:08:20.749 --> 00:08:20.759 align:start position:0%
in the audience that would like to help
 
00:08:23.029 --> 00:08:23.039 align:start position:0%
us with those bills this is a work
 
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
session so it's somewhat more informal
 
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
than a traditional hearing or anything
 
00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:31.740 align:start position:0%
else like that
 
00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
um I would
 
00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.490 align:start position:0%
um I would
offer

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:36.500 align:start position:0%
offer
 
00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:40.620 align:start position:0%
our guests to to interact with any of
 
00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:43.740 align:start position:0%
the questions that we have as we go I
 
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
still would like things coming through
 
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
the chair I don't want any crosstalk by
 
00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:51.180 align:start position:0%
and large would be helpful everyone has
 
00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:53.580 align:start position:0%
something interesting to say I'm going
 
00:08:57.889 --> 00:08:57.899 align:start position:0%
to assume and and that should be that
 
00:08:59.870 --> 00:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
should be part of the conversation so
 
00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:01.980 align:start position:0%
that we can all hear what everyone is
 
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
saying but other than that
 
00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:07.620 align:start position:0%
um I also wanted to point so why don't
 
00:09:11.449 --> 00:09:11.459 align:start position:0%
we start with 301 I wanted to point out
 
00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:14.940 align:start position:0%
the very fine work of our researcher
 
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
who has given us a
 
00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:19.740 align:start position:0%
this is called a side by side for
 
00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:22.550 align:start position:0%
this is called a side by side for
freshmen

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
freshmen
 
00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
I think
 
00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:24.530 align:start position:0%
I think
um

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:24.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:28.500 align:start position:0%
what it is doing what it is giving us is
 
00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:33.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:38.269 --> 00:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
original the amendment and the
 
00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:40.980 align:start position:0%
original no are they both the same
 
00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:42.470 align:start position:0%
original no are they both the same
Amendment

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.769 align:start position:0%
Amendment
0756

00:09:45.769 --> 00:09:45.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:59.329 --> 00:09:59.339 align:start position:0%
so it's two pieces the the current law
 
00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
and the amendment not the original 301.
 
00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.570 align:start position:0%
and the amendment not the original 301.
okay

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:05.580 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:06.710 align:start position:0%
okay
so

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.870 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:11.519 align:start position:0%
so I suspect
 
00:10:14.269 --> 00:10:14.279 align:start position:0%
um we also have a third option I'm
 
00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:16.220 align:start position:0%
hoping that
 
00:10:18.949 --> 00:10:18.959 align:start position:0%
representative Gordon everybody knows
 
00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:20.940 align:start position:0%
representative Gordon who is the chair
 
00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:23.700 align:start position:0%
of uh our current chair of house ethics
 
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
and the reason that we're all here
 
00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:27.540 align:start position:0%
actually because the representative
 
00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
Gordon gave us the bill two years ago
 
00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:33.660 align:start position:0%
that we retained and worked on over the
 
00:10:36.769 --> 00:10:36.779 align:start position:0%
summer and which ultimately turned into
 
00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:41.820 align:start position:0%
house bill 301. so um
 
00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:44.820 align:start position:0%
why don't I ask can can you come to the
 
00:10:47.449 --> 00:10:47.459 align:start position:0%
to the microphone and um
 
00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:50.940 align:start position:0%
and help us uh
 
00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:55.380 align:start position:0%
peace or or parts what these uh what we
 
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
have in front of us and what the
 
00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:00.300 align:start position:0%
sections are that um uh were
 
00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:05.100 align:start position:0%
objectionable or confusing or language
 
00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:07.500 align:start position:0%
that we need to strike from the original
 
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.009 align:start position:0%
that we need to strike from the original
301

00:11:09.009 --> 00:11:09.019 align:start position:0%
301
 
00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
some of us did meet with the just to
 
00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:13.740 align:start position:0%
catch everyone up some of us did meet
 
00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:16.260 align:start position:0%
with the Ethics Committee uh earlier
 
00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:17.700 align:start position:0%
this month
 
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
um and we heard an earful of of things
 
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
that the committee specifically didn't
 
00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:28.380 align:start position:0%
like or didn't think that they could
 
00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:29.540 align:start position:0%
work with
 
00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
we made very good notes of of those
 
00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:35.100 align:start position:0%
things and
 
00:11:38.449 --> 00:11:38.459 align:start position:0%
a lot of what they told us is what has
 
00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:40.860 align:start position:0%
turned into the amendment that they now
 
00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
have and you now have in front of you
 
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:45.889 align:start position:0%
have and you now have in front of you
um

00:11:45.889 --> 00:11:45.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:48.660 align:start position:0%
is that not correct representative
 
00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:49.850 align:start position:0%
is that not correct representative
Gordon

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:49.860 align:start position:0%
Gordon
 
00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:51.290 align:start position:0%
Gordon
uh

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:51.300 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:53.100 align:start position:0%
I think everything is correct I just
 
00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
don't know what everybody has in front
 
00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:56.820 align:start position:0%
of them is that what I sent you by you
 
00:11:59.630 --> 00:11:59.640 align:start position:0%
you have you have the side by side that
 
00:12:02.509 --> 00:12:02.519 align:start position:0%
um our researcher put together for you I
 
00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:04.980 align:start position:0%
don't you will Mr chair you keep
 
00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:06.180 align:start position:0%
referring to him as representative
 
00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:07.190 align:start position:0%
referring to him as representative
Gordon

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
Gordon
 
00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:13.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
um we have car we have copies okay of
 
00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:19.260 align:start position:0%
your Amendment yeah
 
00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:27.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:29.030 align:start position:0%
 
0756

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
0756
 
00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.590 align:start position:0%
0756
um

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
okay that'd be great I thought didn't we
 
00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:36.420 align:start position:0%
didn't we email that out there yes you
 
00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:37.610 align:start position:0%
didn't we email that out there yes you
did

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:37.620 align:start position:0%
did
 
00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:39.720 align:start position:0%
oh okay
 
00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:42.420 align:start position:0%
we'll make sure everybody has that
 
00:12:46.129 --> 00:12:46.139 align:start position:0%
no no you can make
 
00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
um okay great
 
00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:49.509 align:start position:0%
um okay great
um

00:12:49.509 --> 00:12:49.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:52.620 align:start position:0%
you have a copy of the amendment as well
 
00:12:55.129 --> 00:12:55.139 align:start position:0%
I do not have a copy of your Amendment
 
00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
all right so why don't we talk about
 
00:12:59.449 --> 00:12:59.459 align:start position:0%
your Amendment while we're getting the
 
00:13:01.129 --> 00:13:01.139 align:start position:0%
copy of the
 
00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:03.660 align:start position:0%
committee Amendment um I'll call it the
 
00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
sheen Amendment just because it's the
 
00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
first name on it
 
00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:10.260 align:start position:0%
if I could just start maybe giving you
 
00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:17.220 align:start position:0%
I can't follow along with anything he's
 
00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
going to say if I don't have it
 
00:13:23.629 --> 00:13:23.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:25.629 --> 00:13:25.639 align:start position:0%
why don't you start with the background
 
00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
and Rich they may need a couple of
 
00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:30.060 align:start position:0%
accounts good
 
00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:33.590 align:start position:0%
accounts good
so

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
what what initiated the what initially
 
00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:40.860 align:start position:0%
initiated the original legislation
 
00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
was an event which occurred in the
 
00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:46.940 align:start position:0%
Ethics Committee and that was
 
00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
first an advisory opinion and then an
 
00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
informal resolution both involving the
 
00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
issue of recusal when is it appropriate
 
00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
for a legislator to recuse themselves
 
00:14:03.949 --> 00:14:03.959 align:start position:0%
and currently under our ethics
 
00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:06.060 align:start position:0%
guidelines that we have
 
00:14:10.069 --> 00:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
there is no requirement specified for a
 
00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
legislator to recuse themselves
 
00:14:16.069 --> 00:14:16.079 align:start position:0%
when the guidelines were first created
 
00:14:19.009 --> 00:14:19.019 align:start position:0%
30 years ago
 
00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
30 some years ago
 
00:14:23.629 --> 00:14:23.639 align:start position:0%
they were focused on the issue of
 
00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:26.220 align:start position:0%
disclosure disclosing the fact when you
 
00:14:28.009 --> 00:14:28.019 align:start position:0%
have a conflict
 
00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
and so they addressed that issue when
 
00:14:32.569 --> 00:14:32.579 align:start position:0%
you have a conflict of interest that you
 
00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:34.500 align:start position:0%
need to disclose and it provides
 
00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:36.660 align:start position:0%
legislators with the option
 
00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:40.380 align:start position:0%
uh either continuing to participate
 
00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:42.180 align:start position:0%
announcing the fact that you have a
 
00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
conflict But continuing to participate
 
00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:45.590 align:start position:0%
conflict But continuing to participate
or

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
in the all uh or recusal so there's an
 
00:14:52.069 --> 00:14:52.079 align:start position:0%
implication of recusal but no
 
00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:54.180 align:start position:0%
requirement that legislators recuse
 
00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:55.430 align:start position:0%
requirement that legislators recuse
themselves

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
00:14:57.949 --> 00:14:57.959 align:start position:0%
but then the legit the legislative
 
00:15:02.689 --> 00:15:02.699 align:start position:0%
Ethics Committee had two cases in which
 
00:15:05.269 --> 00:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
there was an obvious
 
00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:07.860 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest
 
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
where someone would be making decisions
 
00:15:12.769 --> 00:15:12.779 align:start position:0%
on something for which they potentially
 
00:15:16.129 --> 00:15:16.139 align:start position:0%
were being compensated for doing
 
00:15:16.139 --> 00:15:17.629 align:start position:0%
were being compensated for doing
and

00:15:17.629 --> 00:15:17.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:15:20.269 --> 00:15:20.279 align:start position:0%
so the legislative Ethics Committee and
 
00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:22.740 align:start position:0%
its informal resolution and its advisory
 
00:15:25.129 --> 00:15:25.139 align:start position:0%
opinion said yes there are circumstances
 
00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
when people really need to recuse
 
00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:29.389 align:start position:0%
when people really need to recuse
themselves

00:15:29.389 --> 00:15:29.399 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
00:15:32.329 --> 00:15:32.339 align:start position:0%
but again not specified at all in the
 
00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:33.660 align:start position:0%
ethics guidelines and that's what
 
00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:36.060 align:start position:0%
precipitated the original legislation to
 
00:15:37.129 --> 00:15:37.139 align:start position:0%
say hey
 
00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:39.500 align:start position:0%
there are circumstances under which
 
00:15:43.009 --> 00:15:43.019 align:start position:0%
legislators should recuse themselves and
 
00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:44.940 align:start position:0%
there are a couple of reasons for that
 
00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
one is because our constitution has some
 
00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:51.540 align:start position:0%
provision in regard to that and second
 
00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
is because you want to maintain the
 
00:15:54.769 --> 00:15:54.779 align:start position:0%
confidence of the public
 
00:15:58.250 --> 00:15:58.260 align:start position:0%
the PO I think an ordinary citizen would
 
00:15:58.260 --> 00:15:59.329 align:start position:0%
the PO I think an ordinary citizen would
expect

00:15:59.329 --> 00:15:59.339 align:start position:0%
expect
 
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
that a legislator would not be voting on
 
00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:03.660 align:start position:0%
things where they were going to be
 
00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
receiving a direct Financial benefit
 
00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:09.300 align:start position:0%
that just makes sense
 
00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:10.430 align:start position:0%
that just makes sense
so

00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
that's what precipitated the original
 
00:16:14.389 --> 00:16:14.399 align:start position:0%
legislation and that legislation has
 
00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:18.300 align:start position:0%
gone uh it there was an initial bill two
 
00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
sessions ago that died in the covid
 
00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:22.860 align:start position:0%
process there was one in the last
 
00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
session which we retained and that's
 
00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh chairman Hill to his credit came to
 
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
the Ethics Committee and said uh he came
 
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
up with a proposal and the amendment
 
00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:40.980 align:start position:0%
that you that the the committee
 
00:16:44.509 --> 00:16:44.519 align:start position:0%
amendment that you have and came to the
 
00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:46.440 align:start position:0%
Ethics Committee and said you know I
 
00:16:48.829 --> 00:16:48.839 align:start position:0%
would like your thoughts with regard to
 
00:16:50.689 --> 00:16:50.699 align:start position:0%
that as the committee
 
00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
uh discussed that
 
00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:55.860 align:start position:0%
and I have to say that the committee
 
00:16:59.629 --> 00:16:59.639 align:start position:0%
hasn't come to any type of resolution
 
00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:04.140 align:start position:0%
because the committee has various ideas
 
00:17:07.549 --> 00:17:07.559 align:start position:0%
there are two things which I think the
 
00:17:09.289 --> 00:17:09.299 align:start position:0%
committee is in agreement with and I
 
00:17:10.789 --> 00:17:10.799 align:start position:0%
think most people are in agreement with
 
00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:13.020 align:start position:0%
there are circumstances when legislators
 
00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
should recuse themselves I think
 
00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:17.100 align:start position:0%
everybody agrees to that and and two
 
00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:19.079 align:start position:0%
particular circumstances
 
00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:21.780 align:start position:0%
one is when you're going to get some
 
00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:23.660 align:start position:0%
particular benefit
 
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
as a result of your employment or the
 
00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
organization of which you're a part of
 
00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
you're going to get some particular
 
00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:33.480 align:start position:0%
benefit from and the particular example
 
00:17:36.169 --> 00:17:36.179 align:start position:0%
for that is representative uh we had an
 
00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:38.220 align:start position:0%
informal resolution involving
 
00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:41.220 align:start position:0%
representative lay uh God Rest his soul
 
00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:43.860 align:start position:0%
now who's since deceased but
 
00:17:48.409 --> 00:17:48.419 align:start position:0%
representative lay was a a acting as the
 
00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:51.720 align:start position:0%
president of a teachers union
 
00:17:55.789 --> 00:17:55.799 align:start position:0%
but then voting on issues which involved
 
00:17:58.850 --> 00:17:58.860 align:start position:0%
raises for teachers for example or
 
00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:00.780 align:start position:0%
issues with regard to teachers
 
00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
and the question was was that ethical
 
00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
for him to do that and the Ethics
 
00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:09.660 align:start position:0%
Committee determined it wasn't
 
00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:11.940 align:start position:0%
but the issue of course for the Ethics
 
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
Committee at the time was the ethics
 
00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
guidelines doesn't say anything about it
 
00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:20.100 align:start position:0%
but so we issued an informal resolution
 
00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:23.340 align:start position:0%
which he agreed to to his credit that
 
00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:25.260 align:start position:0%
said yeah I probably shouldn't be doing
 
00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
that and I'm not going to do it anymore
 
00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:29.220 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean that he shouldn't be
 
00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:30.970 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean that he shouldn't be
uh

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:30.980 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
uh voting on issues that involve
 
00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:36.660 align:start position:0%
teachers all together or education
 
00:18:39.289 --> 00:18:39.299 align:start position:0%
altogether but something that would
 
00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:41.940 align:start position:0%
affect directly benefit his membership
 
00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:45.240 align:start position:0%
of his union he shouldn't be doing we
 
00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
all agree that lobbyists should not be
 
00:18:50.029 --> 00:18:50.039 align:start position:0%
voting on things that would affect their
 
00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:52.380 align:start position:0%
clients right
 
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
but there's nothing in the ethics
 
00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:55.140 align:start position:0%
guidelines that says you can't do that
 
00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:18:58.789 --> 00:18:58.799 align:start position:0%
so those are things that we agree in the
 
00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
second thing we agree on is that
 
00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:02.820 align:start position:0%
sometimes legislators may find
 
00:19:04.669 --> 00:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
themselves voting on legislation that
 
00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:08.580 align:start position:0%
has a direct Financial benefit to them
 
00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:11.640 align:start position:0%
and just to use an example
 
00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:14.700 align:start position:0%
is the frm legislation last year and the
 
00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:17.640 align:start position:0%
frm legislation if you have a legislator
 
00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:20.820 align:start position:0%
who is potentially going to get tens of
 
00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:22.620 align:start position:0%
thousands or hundreds of thousands of
 
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
dollars as a result of that legislation
 
00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
they probably shouldn't be voting on and
 
00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:29.460 align:start position:0%
to the one legislator who did have that
 
00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:31.740 align:start position:0%
circumstance did recuse themselves last
 
00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
year just to point that out
 
00:19:36.049 --> 00:19:36.059 align:start position:0%
but there ought to be some provision
 
00:19:39.289 --> 00:19:39.299 align:start position:0%
that says you shouldn't be voting on it
 
00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
so the reason that the so the Ethics
 
00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:43.980 align:start position:0%
Committee agrees to those I think
 
00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:45.900 align:start position:0%
generally agreement among the Ethics
 
00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:49.860 align:start position:0%
Committee members the issue though is to
 
00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:52.020 align:start position:0%
what ex how do you define that and to
 
00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:55.500 align:start position:0%
what extent do you put that into law
 
00:19:57.730 --> 00:19:57.740 align:start position:0%
because uh
 
00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:01.620 align:start position:0%
and you know just
 
00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:04.370 align:start position:0%
and you know just
there's

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:04.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh Constitutional Amendment
 
00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:08.820 align:start position:0%
there's a excuse me there's a
 
00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:10.140 align:start position:0%
constitutional provision in our
 
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
constitution right now which is part of
 
00:20:13.669 --> 00:20:13.679 align:start position:0%
the bill and the findings it says that
 
00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
part one of the Constitution says no
 
00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:17.460 align:start position:0%
member of the general court shall take
 
00:20:21.049 --> 00:20:21.059 align:start position:0%
fees be of counsel or act as an advocate
 
00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:23.580 align:start position:0%
in any cause before either branch of the
 
00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:26.700 align:start position:0%
legislature well how do you define act
 
00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:29.100 align:start position:0%
as an advocate
 
00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:30.780 align:start position:0%
because we all advocate for our
 
00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:34.020 align:start position:0%
constituents right so it has to have
 
00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
more meaning than that God knows and and
 
00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:37.860 align:start position:0%
it's not for us to interpret that as for
 
00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:40.020 align:start position:0%
the for the courts to interpret what
 
00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:41.820 align:start position:0%
that would mean they interpret the
 
00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:42.890 align:start position:0%
that would mean they interpret the
Constitution

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:42.900 align:start position:0%
Constitution
 
00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
so but long and short it must have some
 
00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:48.360 align:start position:0%
connection to you getting some benefit
 
00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:51.900 align:start position:0%
you you're a stakeholder in some way and
 
00:20:54.409 --> 00:20:54.419 align:start position:0%
either you're getting paid or you're a
 
00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
member of an organization whatever and
 
00:20:59.750 --> 00:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
you're getting some benefit so
 
00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
we look at that and say well uh if we're
 
00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
going to set some type of definition it
 
00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:07.940 align:start position:0%
has to be in a way that the
 
00:21:10.669 --> 00:21:10.679 align:start position:0%
the legislator is going to be receiving
 
00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
some type of benefit as a result
 
00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
and but acting on behalf of someone else
 
00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:18.360 align:start position:0%
some organization
 
00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
an employer or someone else
 
00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:24.660 align:start position:0%
the second issue is with regard to
 
00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:26.690 align:start position:0%
the second issue is with regard to
legislators

00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:26.700 align:start position:0%
legislators
 
00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
frm is a great example because of the
 
00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:32.820 align:start position:0%
amount of money involved
 
00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:35.630 align:start position:0%
amount of money involved
but

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:37.740 align:start position:0%
just last week there was legislation
 
00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:40.980 align:start position:0%
about uh
 
00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:48.780 align:start position:0%
one retiree in the legislature recuse
 
00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:50.330 align:start position:0%
one retiree in the legislature recuse
themselves

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:50.340 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:52.380 align:start position:0%
one filed a notice of intent saying
 
00:21:54.529 --> 00:21:54.539 align:start position:0%
they're going to participate anyway
 
00:21:57.529 --> 00:21:57.539 align:start position:0%
and there were probably other people who
 
00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:01.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:05.460 align:start position:0%
now for state and retiree in all
 
00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:06.789 align:start position:0%
now for state and retiree in all
likelihood

00:22:06.789 --> 00:22:06.799 align:start position:0%
likelihood
 
00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
that legislation would result in
 
00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
literally thousands of dollars each year
 
00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
to them and over a course of time
 
00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
tens of thousands of dollars so should
 
00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:20.580 align:start position:0%
they be voting and that's the question
 
00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:22.140 align:start position:0%
you know that's the really difficult
 
00:22:24.649 --> 00:22:24.659 align:start position:0%
question that the Ethics Committee has
 
00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
tried to wrestle with and that is where
 
00:22:29.289 --> 00:22:29.299 align:start position:0%
you'd draw that line
 
00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
and so the Ethics Committee really can't
 
00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
because there are there's at least one
 
00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
member of the Ethics Committee that says
 
00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
hey I really don't want to have to deal
 
00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
with that you know uh how I let's just
 
00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:45.720 align:start position:0%
keep it the way it is because
 
00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
um the the fact is that if we try to
 
00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
apply that standard it's going to be
 
00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:54.360 align:start position:0%
more work than it's worth you know so
 
00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
that's where that's sort of where the
 
00:22:57.950 --> 00:22:57.960 align:start position:0%
Ethics Committee is so while I'm
 
00:22:59.570 --> 00:22:59.580 align:start position:0%
appearing today and I'm not appearing
 
00:23:01.909 --> 00:23:01.919 align:start position:0%
representing the Ethics Committee I'm
 
00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
representing myself in doing this today
 
00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:08.780 align:start position:0%
so the proposal that I had
 
00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
just addressed to if you have that in
 
00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:14.340 align:start position:0%
front of you just address those two
 
00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
issues that I mentioned
 
00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:20.220 align:start position:0%
recusals for conflicts of interest
 
00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:22.140 align:start position:0%
one that legislators would recuse
 
00:23:24.049 --> 00:23:24.059 align:start position:0%
themselves from voting on any
 
00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
legislation one of the things that the
 
00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:28.620 align:start position:0%
committee did look at was
 
00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:30.900 align:start position:0%
what does recu what does what should be
 
00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:32.940 align:start position:0%
required in recusal
 
00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
currently in the current guidelines
 
00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:38.220 align:start position:0%
recusal requires you to refrain from
 
00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
participating in any activity
 
00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:43.610 align:start position:0%
participating in any activity
and

00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:43.620 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:23:45.409 --> 00:23:45.419 align:start position:0%
so one of the things that said if we're
 
00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:47.340 align:start position:0%
going to have a standard the standard
 
00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:50.580 align:start position:0%
should be how you know if somebody talks
 
00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:51.900 align:start position:0%
to somebody else while they're in the
 
00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:53.690 align:start position:0%
to somebody else while they're in the
bathroom

00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:53.700 align:start position:0%
bathroom
 
00:23:57.710 --> 00:23:57.720 align:start position:0%
does that kind have you violated your
 
00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:59.570 align:start position:0%
does that kind have you violated your
provisions

00:23:59.570 --> 00:23:59.580 align:start position:0%
provisions
 
00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:02.280 align:start position:0%
so to make it clear what we've said is
 
00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:05.580 align:start position:0%
recusal should be from voting
 
00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
so that for example in the frm case the
 
00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
person who has an interest could speak
 
00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:13.320 align:start position:0%
to other legislators
 
00:24:15.409 --> 00:24:15.419 align:start position:0%
but couldn't vote on the issue in
 
00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:17.900 align:start position:0%
committee or couldn't vote on the issue
 
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
in uh
 
00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:23.460 align:start position:0%
on the session in session
 
00:24:25.669 --> 00:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
so every voting on any legislation when
 
00:24:27.169 --> 00:24:27.179 align:start position:0%
the legislator or a member of the
 
00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:29.700 align:start position:0%
legislator's household is employed by or
 
00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:32.100 align:start position:0%
is acting as an agent for an
 
00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:34.980 align:start position:0%
organization whether for-profit or
 
00:24:37.909 --> 00:24:37.919 align:start position:0%
non-profit and this is a two-prong test
 
00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:40.980 align:start position:0%
one in which the organization is the
 
00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
subject of the legislation and the
 
00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:45.720 align:start position:0%
organization or its membership has a
 
00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
special interest as defined in the
 
00:24:51.289 --> 00:24:51.299 align:start position:0%
current Statute in the outcome of the
 
00:24:51.299 --> 00:24:52.610 align:start position:0%
current Statute in the outcome of the
legislation

00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:52.620 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:24:56.149 --> 00:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
so it's got to be more than just an
 
00:24:59.210 --> 00:24:59.220 align:start position:0%
outcome so if you were on the board of a
 
00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:01.980 align:start position:0%
hospital for example and there should be
 
00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:04.980 align:start position:0%
an issue with regard to Medicaid rates
 
00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:06.610 align:start position:0%
an issue with regard to Medicaid rates
if

00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:06.620 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:10.500 align:start position:0%
the first prong the test says well
 
00:25:12.409 --> 00:25:12.419 align:start position:0%
is that hospital the subject of the
 
00:25:15.049 --> 00:25:15.059 align:start position:0%
legislation well no Medicaid rates are
 
00:25:16.669 --> 00:25:16.679 align:start position:0%
for everybody
 
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
so even though they would affect the
 
00:25:21.169 --> 00:25:21.179 align:start position:0%
hospital it wouldn't affect your
 
00:25:22.789 --> 00:25:22.799 align:start position:0%
hospital any more than it would anybody
 
00:25:22.799 --> 00:25:23.870 align:start position:0%
hospital any more than it would anybody
else

00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
else
 
00:25:27.289 --> 00:25:27.299 align:start position:0%
so in that particular case uh it
 
00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:29.820 align:start position:0%
wouldn't but if but if you got to a
 
00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:31.400 align:start position:0%
point where you were voting on whether
 
00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:34.260 align:start position:0%
your hospital should be able to merge
 
00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:37.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:40.140 align:start position:0%
then I think you are the subject of the
 
00:25:42.529 --> 00:25:42.539 align:start position:0%
legislation and you would be affected
 
00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
and you would have a special interest so
 
00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:47.700 align:start position:0%
this sort of a two-prong test as to
 
00:25:49.789 --> 00:25:49.799 align:start position:0%
whether or not recusal should take place
 
00:25:49.799 --> 00:25:51.070 align:start position:0%
whether or not recusal should take place
so

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:51.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:54.620 align:start position:0%
in the Douglas case for example
 
00:25:59.029 --> 00:25:59.039 align:start position:0%
if the issue is over whether teachers
 
00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:00.900 align:start position:0%
should get
 
00:26:03.649 --> 00:26:03.659 align:start position:0%
cost of living increases
 
00:26:03.659 --> 00:26:04.909 align:start position:0%
cost of living increases
uh

00:26:04.909 --> 00:26:04.919 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
uh then or raises that's one thing if
 
00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
it's a question
 
00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
but if it's a question over whether
 
00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
there should be Freedom savings accounts
 
00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:20.100 align:start position:0%
or educational savings accounts that's
 
00:26:21.529 --> 00:26:21.539 align:start position:0%
another question he probably could vote
 
00:26:23.269 --> 00:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
on educational savings accounts because
 
00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
it doesn't affect his union members
 
00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:27.110 align:start position:0%
it doesn't affect his union members
directly

00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
directly
 
00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:29.090 align:start position:0%
directly
so

00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:29.100 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
and then the second provision would be
 
00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:32.820 align:start position:0%
legislative should recuse themselves
 
00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:35.400 align:start position:0%
from voting on any legislation when a
 
00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:37.140 align:start position:0%
legislator or a member of the
 
00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
legislators household may receive a
 
00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:41.580 align:start position:0%
direct Financial benefit or detriment as
 
00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:43.980 align:start position:0%
an outcome and then direct Financial
 
00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:47.100 align:start position:0%
benefit is further defined which means
 
00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:49.620 align:start position:0%
that it could be reasonably expected to
 
00:26:52.789 --> 00:26:52.799 align:start position:0%
have a direct and substantial effect on
 
00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
the income of the legislator and the
 
00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
income of the legislator so it would be
 
00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:01.740 align:start position:0%
Financial only and to have a direct and
 
00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:04.380 align:start position:0%
substantial effect
 
00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:06.900 align:start position:0%
I think if you were to apply that
 
00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:08.900 align:start position:0%
standard today
 
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh you on the vote for raises for
 
00:27:15.169 --> 00:27:15.179 align:start position:0%
retirees and you were retirees that
 
00:27:17.149 --> 00:27:17.159 align:start position:0%
would require you to recuse yourself I
 
00:27:18.769 --> 00:27:18.779 align:start position:0%
know when I voted on it last year my
 
00:27:21.049 --> 00:27:21.059 align:start position:0%
wife is a state retiree when I voted on
 
00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:23.580 align:start position:0%
it uh when I when it came before the
 
00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:25.260 align:start position:0%
legislature last year I recuse myself
 
00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
and there were a number of other people
 
00:27:28.789 --> 00:27:28.799 align:start position:0%
that did recuse themselves so that was I
 
00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
was surprised this year when not many
 
00:27:34.789 --> 00:27:34.799 align:start position:0%
people did but I think that's indicative
 
00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
of not understanding the
 
00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
the process or or looking at it from a
 
00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:43.260 align:start position:0%
different standpoint why don't we take
 
00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:44.820 align:start position:0%
can we take
 
00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
um I think we need to take this in steps
 
00:27:51.409 --> 00:27:51.419 align:start position:0%
and and pieces as we go so what I would
 
00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:53.940 align:start position:0%
like to propose is
 
00:27:55.789 --> 00:27:55.799 align:start position:0%
um armed with
 
00:27:55.799 --> 00:27:56.450 align:start position:0%
um armed with
um

00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:56.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:58.909 --> 00:27:58.919 align:start position:0%
the the side by side and I'm looking
 
00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:02.340 align:start position:0%
specifically at page two
 
00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:03.110 align:start position:0%
specifically at page two
um

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:05.090 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:05.100 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
what is called 14 C 4 a recusal and
 
00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:13.200 align:start position:0%

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:13.970 align:start position:0%
disclosure for conflicts of interest
um

00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:13.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:16.500 align:start position:0%
seems to line up with
 
00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:17.149 align:start position:0%
seems to line up with
um

00:28:17.149 --> 00:28:17.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
honorable Gordon's 14

Dash C 3B recusal for conflicts of
 
00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:26.870 align:start position:0%
Dash C 3B recusal for conflicts of
interest

00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
interest
 
00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:28.070 align:start position:0%
interest
uh

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:28:31.909 --> 00:28:31.919 align:start position:0%
I guess what I'm starting with is
 
00:28:35.029 --> 00:28:35.039 align:start position:0%
how far from that legislator
 
00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
does this
 
00:28:41.149 --> 00:28:41.159 align:start position:0%
um interest lie how and I go by the
 
00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:43.380 align:start position:0%
concentric Circle theory if we start
 
00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
with the the legislator in the middle
 
00:28:48.049 --> 00:28:48.059 align:start position:0%
how far out from that
 
00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:51.200 align:start position:0%
um in in your
 
00:28:55.909 --> 00:28:55.919 align:start position:0%
proposal you talk about the legislator a
 
00:28:58.310 --> 00:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
member of the legislator's household
 
00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:01.320 align:start position:0%
is employed by or acting as an agent for
 
00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:03.480 align:start position:0%
an organization
 
00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:05.529 align:start position:0%
an organization
um

00:29:05.529 --> 00:29:05.539 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
and that's it
 
00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:10.070 align:start position:0%
and that's it
um

00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:13.740 align:start position:0%
in in the amendment
 
00:29:17.149 --> 00:29:17.159 align:start position:0%
um the the sheen Amendment it talks
 
00:29:20.029 --> 00:29:20.039 align:start position:0%
about the legislature recuse himself or
 
00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
herself from voting in any official
 
00:29:24.289 --> 00:29:24.299 align:start position:0%
legislative activity when the legislator
 
00:29:26.810 --> 00:29:26.820 align:start position:0%
or any person living in the household
 
00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:29.340 align:start position:0%
with the legislator or financially
 
00:29:31.549 --> 00:29:31.559 align:start position:0%
dependent on the legislator
 
00:29:31.559 --> 00:29:33.590 align:start position:0%
dependent on the legislator
so

00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
markedly different 301
 
00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
the original 301 expanded it even
 
00:29:43.549 --> 00:29:43.559 align:start position:0%
further which Ethics Committee was not
 
00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:46.860 align:start position:0%
in favor of that talked about anyone
 
00:29:49.850 --> 00:29:49.860 align:start position:0%
that the legislator cares about
 
00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:50.810 align:start position:0%
that the legislator cares about
um

00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:50.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:54.769 --> 00:29:54.779 align:start position:0%
and and that seemed to be
 
00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:57.240 align:start position:0%
caused them consternation because they
 
00:29:59.510 --> 00:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
didn't have any way of determining who
 
00:30:01.389 --> 00:30:01.399 align:start position:0%
that person would be
 
00:30:05.389 --> 00:30:05.399 align:start position:0%
and I should perhaps step back and and
 
00:30:09.409 --> 00:30:09.419 align:start position:0%
make it clear that in drafting 301
 
00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:14.460 align:start position:0%
it was my intention to to draft it from
 
00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
the standpoint of a legislator not the
 
00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:20.220 align:start position:0%
standpoint of the Ethics Committee
 
00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:20.810 align:start position:0%
standpoint of the Ethics Committee
um

00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:20.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:23.029 --> 00:30:23.039 align:start position:0%
I was looking at it from the standpoint
 
00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
of advising
 
00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:27.720 align:start position:0%
all of our colleagues that sit in reps
 
00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:31.260 align:start position:0%
Hall and are having to decide whether an
 
00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:34.020 align:start position:0%
issue arises that they need to go down
 
00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:37.380 align:start position:0%
and see our Clerk and say I'm not voting
 
00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
on this issue
 
00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
what happens after that
 
00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:43.980 align:start position:0%
personally I don't care
 
00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
um I that's that's for the Ethics
 
00:30:49.370 --> 00:30:49.380 align:start position:0%
Committee to decide but for me I'm
 
00:30:51.169 --> 00:30:51.179 align:start position:0%
trying to make sure that this purple
 
00:30:53.930 --> 00:30:53.940 align:start position:0%
book that's handed out to everyone
 
00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:55.310 align:start position:0%
book that's handed out to everyone
gives

00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:55.320 align:start position:0%
gives
 
00:30:58.789 --> 00:30:58.799 align:start position:0%
honest guide guidance to those those
 
00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:02.100 align:start position:0%
Representatives so when I was saying
 
00:31:04.669 --> 00:31:04.679 align:start position:0%
someone you care about
 
00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
I think it's up to each individual rep
 
00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:10.860 align:start position:0%
to decide who it is that influences your
 
00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:11.990 align:start position:0%
to decide who it is that influences your
vote

00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
vote
 
00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
so I understand it didn't fit the legal
 
00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:19.740 align:start position:0%
definition and and that's not my problem
 
00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
um I uh I'm trying to not get it to the
 
00:31:29.409 --> 00:31:29.419 align:start position:0%
Ethics Committee I'm trying to to have
 
00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:32.340 align:start position:0%
be the brotherly advice to our
 
00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:35.460 align:start position:0%
legislator friends to say this is what I
 
00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
think you should do or that's what this
 
00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
is what um we have decided that would be
 
00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
the the correct pathway so
 
00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
what does the committee feel about
 
00:31:54.169 --> 00:31:54.179 align:start position:0%
um that idea of concentric circles what
 
00:31:56.570 --> 00:31:56.580 align:start position:0%
what's your there's also another option
 
00:31:57.889 --> 00:31:57.899 align:start position:0%
I think
 
00:32:01.389 --> 00:32:01.399 align:start position:0%
um Allison you provided us a another
 
00:32:03.889 --> 00:32:03.899 align:start position:0%
view of that
 
00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:06.360 align:start position:0%
um uh yeah at our last Works work
 
00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:07.980 align:start position:0%
session I had an amendment and I just
 
00:32:09.289 --> 00:32:09.299 align:start position:0%
made sure everyone still had a copy of
 
00:32:09.299 --> 00:32:10.370 align:start position:0%
made sure everyone still had a copy of
it

00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:10.380 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:13.740 align:start position:0%
so we have that as well that yep that's
 
00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:14.930 align:start position:0%
so we have that as well that yep that's
the

00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:14.940 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
I'm going to call it the Allison because
 
00:32:19.669 --> 00:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
it's true I don't know I feel like the
 
00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:25.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:28.669 --> 00:32:28.679 align:start position:0%
I don't know do you have a copy did you
 
00:32:31.730 --> 00:32:31.740 align:start position:0%
receive a copy of the nutting Wong
 
00:32:33.889 --> 00:32:33.899 align:start position:0%
Amendment yes okay
 
00:32:33.899 --> 00:32:35.289 align:start position:0%
Amendment yes okay
so

00:32:35.289 --> 00:32:35.299 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:35.299 --> 00:32:36.889 align:start position:0%
so
what

00:32:36.889 --> 00:32:36.899 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:32:36.899 --> 00:32:37.490 align:start position:0%
what
um

00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:37.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:44.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
if you're looking for an opinion on the
 
00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:50.580 align:start position:0%
nutting Wong concept I'm looking for
 
00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:53.820 align:start position:0%
a an opinion on
 
00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:54.590 align:start position:0%
a an opinion on
um

00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:58.610 --> 00:32:58.620 align:start position:0%
which of these or are any of these
 
00:32:58.620 --> 00:32:59.450 align:start position:0%
which of these or are any of these
um

00:32:59.450 --> 00:32:59.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
suitable to what we want to do from your
 
00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
perspective well having been at the
 
00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
meeting that you are at with the
 
00:33:13.549 --> 00:33:13.559 align:start position:0%
in front of the Ethics Committee I think
 
00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
what I took from that meeting was
 
00:33:18.409 --> 00:33:18.419 align:start position:0%
um go slow that's what I took out of
 
00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
that so what does that mean to you is it
 
00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:23.580 align:start position:0%
in terms of these three uh it means that
 
00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:26.580 align:start position:0%
I think they
 
00:33:29.149 --> 00:33:29.159 align:start position:0%
nutting along Amendment
 
00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:32.340 align:start position:0%
fits fits in the interest of going slow
 
00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:35.029 align:start position:0%
fits fits in the interest of going slow
um

00:33:35.029 --> 00:33:35.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:35.039 --> 00:33:38.330 align:start position:0%
 
there's

00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:38.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:42.049 --> 00:33:42.059 align:start position:0%
uh actually I take that back so so the
 
00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:44.820 align:start position:0%
nutting Wong doesn't deal with
 
00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:46.620 align:start position:0%
I I'm
 
00:33:48.409 --> 00:33:48.419 align:start position:0%
incorrect that's dealing with the
 
00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:50.220 align:start position:0%
definition of conflict of interest it's
 
00:33:52.570 --> 00:33:52.580 align:start position:0%
not dealing with the who
 
00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:54.200 align:start position:0%
of of
 
00:33:57.049 --> 00:33:57.059 align:start position:0%
whether it's just the legislator whether
 
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
it's the legislator and family it's
 
00:34:02.029 --> 00:34:02.039 align:start position:0%
that's dealing more with the definition
 
00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
of conflict the definition of conflict
 
00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:07.260 align:start position:0%
of interest
 
00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:09.720 align:start position:0%
um in in the bill itself was it is
 
00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
that's where it was we haven't got there
 
00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:14.220 align:start position:0%
yet I think I think we need to deal with
 
00:34:16.849 --> 00:34:16.859 align:start position:0%
who who would have the conflict of
 
00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:19.800 align:start position:0%
interest first and then we'll deal with
 
00:34:21.950 --> 00:34:21.960 align:start position:0%
the definition of what the conflict of
 
00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:25.020 align:start position:0%
interest is well it's part of it
 
00:34:27.109 --> 00:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
because I have that it's for themselves
 
00:34:29.329 --> 00:34:29.339 align:start position:0%
or another individual
 
00:34:31.490 --> 00:34:31.500 align:start position:0%
available for otherwise similarly
 
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.790 align:start position:0%
 
yep

00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:34:40.849 --> 00:34:40.859 align:start position:0%
um so maybe it's just a little bit of a
 
00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:43.020 align:start position:0%
misplacement maybe that should go up to
 
00:34:45.109 --> 00:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
where the
 
00:34:45.119 --> 00:34:46.690 align:start position:0%
where the
the

00:34:46.690 --> 00:34:46.700 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
who is right if if conflicts of interest
 
00:34:52.490 --> 00:34:52.500 align:start position:0%
if this is what if that is your
 
00:34:55.609 --> 00:34:55.619 align:start position:0%
intention is to incorporate the who
 
00:34:58.310 --> 00:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
um maybe we just have to move it
 
00:34:59.810 --> 00:34:59.820 align:start position:0%
it would go down in the definition
 
00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:04.440 align:start position:0%
section more than anything else I think
 
00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
but but getting back to rep Pearson what
 
00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
um as far as the
 
00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
we're I think we're all agreed that the
 
00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:14.810 align:start position:0%
we're I think we're all agreed that the
legislator

00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:14.820 align:start position:0%
legislator
 
00:35:17.810 --> 00:35:17.820 align:start position:0%
is is part of this right
 
00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:21.540 align:start position:0%
um do we then go to the legislator
 
00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:22.130 align:start position:0%
um do we then go to the legislator
um

00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:22.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:25.849 --> 00:35:25.859 align:start position:0%
and and one offers the
 
00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:28.020 align:start position:0%
um the legislator or any person living
 
00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
in the household with the legislator
 
00:35:33.770 --> 00:35:33.780 align:start position:0%
um or member of the legislator's
 
00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
household which is basically the same
 
00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:36.890 align:start position:0%
household which is basically the same
thing

00:35:36.890 --> 00:35:36.900 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:38.210 align:start position:0%
thing
um

00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:38.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
and then another and and then it adds in
 
00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
the person living in the household with
 
00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:45.900 align:start position:0%
the legislator or financially dependent
 
00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:49.020 align:start position:0%
on the legislator what
 
00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:51.060 align:start position:0%
I don't want to go much past household
 
00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
that seems to be a very common
 
00:35:55.870 --> 00:35:55.880 align:start position:0%
definition you see that in other places
 
00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:03.829 --> 00:36:03.839 align:start position:0%
going down a journey beyond the the four
 
00:36:06.109 --> 00:36:06.119 align:start position:0%
walls you're going to start we're going
 
00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
to get into this whole interpretable
 
00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:09.540 align:start position:0%
problem that we had before so what if
 
00:36:12.970 --> 00:36:12.980 align:start position:0%
you have someone that is um that is
 
00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:14.569 align:start position:0%
you have someone that is um that is
bicostal

00:36:14.569 --> 00:36:14.579 align:start position:0%
bicostal
 
00:36:17.089 --> 00:36:17.099 align:start position:0%
um or not living in the household but
 
00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
but financially dependent so a a spouse
 
00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:23.700 align:start position:0%
that doesn't live in that household if
 
00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:24.720 align:start position:0%
your spouse doesn't live in your
 
00:36:25.970 --> 00:36:25.980 align:start position:0%
household you've got bigger problems
 
00:36:28.609 --> 00:36:28.619 align:start position:0%
than being a legislator
 
00:36:28.619 --> 00:36:29.329 align:start position:0%
than being a legislator
um

00:36:29.329 --> 00:36:29.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:32.700 align:start position:0%
maybe so but that's not
 
00:36:34.250 --> 00:36:34.260 align:start position:0%
um and don't be looking at me when you
 
00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
say that
 
00:36:38.990 --> 00:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
um what I'm what I'm suggesting is that
 
00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
there are situations where
 
00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:42.470 align:start position:0%
there are situations where
um

00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:45.780 align:start position:0%
you would be in or you could very well
 
00:36:48.589 --> 00:36:48.599 align:start position:0%
be influenced by someone that may not
 
00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:51.240 align:start position:0%
live in your household but you are you
 
00:36:53.210 --> 00:36:53.220 align:start position:0%
are financially responsible for say say
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
you have a a child that has special
 
00:36:58.310 --> 00:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
needs that lives away in a in a
 
00:36:59.750 --> 00:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
different place
 
00:37:01.490 --> 00:37:01.500 align:start position:0%
um you know other than your household
 
00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
you still are responsible for that child
 
00:37:07.970 --> 00:37:07.980 align:start position:0%
um should that not be included in that
 
00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:12.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
the concept of a dependent is not that
 
00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:18.200 align:start position:0%
big a stretch so I mean it you couldn't
 
00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:20.820 align:start position:0%
you could make a fair case
 
00:37:22.849 --> 00:37:22.859 align:start position:0%
for that
 
00:37:22.859 --> 00:37:25.250 align:start position:0%
for that
um

00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
but that's really
 
00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:30.180 align:start position:0%
everything beyond that is a journey that
 
00:37:32.569 --> 00:37:32.579 align:start position:0%
yeah I agree with you I don't think we
 
00:37:34.849 --> 00:37:34.859 align:start position:0%
should be going down anyone else
 
00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
disagree with that or yep comment
 
00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
I have two adult daughters that live
 
00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:42.540 align:start position:0%
with us my husband and I
 
00:37:44.329 --> 00:37:44.339 align:start position:0%
um they're financially independent file
 
00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
their own tax returns don't rely on
 
00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:48.660 align:start position:0%
anything from us other than the roof
 
00:37:50.650 --> 00:37:50.660 align:start position:0%
over their head which they pay rent for
 
00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:55.260 align:start position:0%
their own groceries all of that stuff so
 
00:37:57.290 --> 00:37:57.300 align:start position:0%
um do I care about them of course does
 
00:38:00.109 --> 00:38:00.119 align:start position:0%
he care about them of course so they
 
00:38:01.849 --> 00:38:01.859 align:start position:0%
would they would fit into this as living
 
00:38:03.410 --> 00:38:03.420 align:start position:0%
in your household
 
00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
but if legislation was to come down the
 
00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:09.200 align:start position:0%
pike and maybe it affects
 
00:38:12.650 --> 00:38:12.660 align:start position:0%
veterinary medicine or X-ray techs which
 
00:38:14.270 --> 00:38:14.280 align:start position:0%
is they both are
 
00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:15.550 align:start position:0%
is they both are
um

00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:15.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:18.530 --> 00:38:18.540 align:start position:0%
in in theory with this I need to recuse
 
00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
myself but they don't financially depend
 
00:38:24.050 --> 00:38:24.060 align:start position:0%
on either of my husband or I
 
00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
um so where does it end they move out
 
00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:29.700 align:start position:0%
and they live next door
 
00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
so rent a room for my neighbor
 
00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:33.950 align:start position:0%
so rent a room for my neighbor
um

00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:36.180 align:start position:0%
do I need to recuse myself because I
 
00:38:39.410 --> 00:38:39.420 align:start position:0%
care about them they're directly tied to
 
00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:40.370 align:start position:0%
care about them they're directly tied to
me

00:38:40.370 --> 00:38:40.380 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna vote on something that affects
 
00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
their livelihood but would you so let me
 
00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
ask if if there were recusal would you
 
00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
recuse yourself on something that came
 
00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:51.839 align:start position:0%
up that was regarding that issue I I
 
00:38:54.109 --> 00:38:54.119 align:start position:0%
suppose that um
 
00:38:55.849 --> 00:38:55.859 align:start position:0%
the proper guy
 
00:38:55.859 --> 00:39:01.550 align:start position:0%
the proper guy
could

00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:03.560 align:start position:0%
I could make the
 
00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate decision does it impact
 
00:39:10.370 --> 00:39:10.380 align:start position:0%
me in my household under my roof
 
00:39:13.069 --> 00:39:13.079 align:start position:0%
directly is that the intent of this does
 
00:39:15.109 --> 00:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
it impact my financial situation
 
00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
directly or
 
00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
um am I supposed to now look at
 
00:39:22.990 --> 00:39:23.000 align:start position:0%
all of these circular
 
00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
relationships oh let's say they moved on
 
00:39:27.770 --> 00:39:27.780 align:start position:0%
and moved next door I don't think we go
 
00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
beyond I I agree with rep Pearson that I
 
00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
don't think I want to go past that point
 
00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
underneath my roof is where it ends yes
 
00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:37.370 align:start position:0%
underneath my roof is where it ends yes
um

00:39:37.370 --> 00:39:37.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:38.750 align:start position:0%
um
that's

00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:39:42.349 --> 00:39:42.359 align:start position:0%
right whichever one you you think I I'm
 
00:39:44.930 --> 00:39:44.940 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at trying to determine I'm
 
00:39:46.849 --> 00:39:46.859 align:start position:0%
asking where everyone is the text of the
 
00:39:49.130 --> 00:39:49.140 align:start position:0%
bill is is it underneath my roof or does
 
00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
it have to go out further than that my
 
00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
mother Florida you know like my sister
 
00:39:55.250 --> 00:39:55.260 align:start position:0%
about lives in Manchester
 
00:39:58.069 --> 00:39:58.079 align:start position:0%
under this bill it's if you pay if your
 
00:39:59.950 --> 00:39:59.960 align:start position:0%
financial if your mother is financially
 
00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:02.700 align:start position:0%
dependent on you I guess okay
 
00:40:06.290 --> 00:40:06.300 align:start position:0%
but but I think where maybe you're a
 
00:40:08.569 --> 00:40:08.579 align:start position:0%
little bit off is on on when you would
 
00:40:11.569 --> 00:40:11.579 align:start position:0%
need to recuse yourself but just because
 
00:40:14.329 --> 00:40:14.339 align:start position:0%
um with a piece of legislation may have
 
00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
some effect doesn't mean that you have
 
00:40:19.130 --> 00:40:19.140 align:start position:0%
to refuse yourself it's like it would
 
00:40:21.829 --> 00:40:21.839 align:start position:0%
come on a Case by case and on a on a
 
00:40:24.770 --> 00:40:24.780 align:start position:0%
specific Bill if it would outsize if
 
00:40:27.109 --> 00:40:27.119 align:start position:0%
your child was living under your roof
 
00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
and say it had a direct personal benefit
 
00:40:33.770 --> 00:40:33.780 align:start position:0%
that let's say a vet tech wouldn't have
 
00:40:36.050 --> 00:40:36.060 align:start position:0%
otherwise then yes you would need to
 
00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:39.180 align:start position:0%
recuse yourself if it was just a general
 
00:40:41.390 --> 00:40:41.400 align:start position:0%
uh animal rights build or something like
 
00:40:43.250 --> 00:40:43.260 align:start position:0%
this or you know something that a
 
00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
regulation that all that text would have
 
00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:47.640 align:start position:0%
to do then you then entering my license
 
00:40:50.089 --> 00:40:50.099 align:start position:0%
to be a vet tech for example not
 
00:40:51.770 --> 00:40:51.780 align:start position:0%
requiring I would say that would be
 
00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:54.180 align:start position:0%
personal opinion direct benefit you'd
 
00:40:56.089 --> 00:40:56.099 align:start position:0%
have to recuse yourself
 
00:40:59.089 --> 00:40:59.099 align:start position:0%
um because or detriment right you could
 
00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
say detriment yeah the other case would
 
00:41:05.329 --> 00:41:05.339 align:start position:0%
be if it influenced your vote to go the
 
00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
other way meaning if you were in favor
 
00:41:12.109 --> 00:41:12.119 align:start position:0%
of this but you're you're
 
00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
someone living in your household you
 
00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
know sort of convinced you to go the
 
00:41:19.069 --> 00:41:19.079 align:start position:0%
other way just because it would affect
 
00:41:20.690 --> 00:41:20.700 align:start position:0%
them then you would need to recuse
 
00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:22.440 align:start position:0%
yourself if it would not affect your
 
00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
vote in any way right because there's
 
00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:27.720 align:start position:0%
um so I think it's a nuanced case it's
 
00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
not it's again it comes down to the the
 
00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
legislator themselves and how that feels
 
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:38.810 --> 00:41:38.820 align:start position:0%
one thing
 
00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
for example the retirees that you spoke
 
00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:43.140 align:start position:0%
about that voted
 
00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:45.300 align:start position:0%
if those retirees were getting the same
 
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
benefit as every other retiree
 
00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:52.380 align:start position:0%
of in the state pension plan then yes as
 
00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:55.380 align:start position:0%
far as ethical ethics go they can vote
 
00:41:58.849 --> 00:41:58.859 align:start position:0%
if they were going to get an above
 
00:42:04.370 --> 00:42:04.380 align:start position:0%
average benefit over all other retirees
 
00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
let's say simply because they're a
 
00:42:07.069 --> 00:42:07.079 align:start position:0%
legislator whatever
 
00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:09.660 align:start position:0%
then no they shouldn't be but that's not
 
00:42:14.089 --> 00:42:14.099 align:start position:0%
dealing with how far out it is a
 
00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:17.700 align:start position:0%
question it's if your spouse was or if
 
00:42:20.690 --> 00:42:20.700 align:start position:0%
someone is living in your right in your
 
00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:22.200 align:start position:0%
household that's what we're trying to
 
00:42:23.569 --> 00:42:23.579 align:start position:0%
work on but some of the stuff that's
 
00:42:24.770 --> 00:42:24.780 align:start position:0%
been said
 
00:42:25.970 --> 00:42:25.980 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:28.140 align:start position:0%
implies that even somebody in your
 
00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
household if they're going to get a
 
00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
benefit uh they shouldn't they should
 
00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:34.980 align:start position:0%
recuse themselves and no only if they're
 
00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
going to get
 
00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
more benefit than anybody else and I'm
 
00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:41.160 align:start position:0%
willing to have that discussion but for
 
00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
right now I'd like to stay on this idea
 
00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:45.480 align:start position:0%
of where
 
00:42:48.770 --> 00:42:48.780 align:start position:0%
where we go from how far away from that
 
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
legislation and as far as these go
 
00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:51.710 align:start position:0%
legislation and as far as these go
either

00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:51.720 align:start position:0%
either
 
00:42:54.770 --> 00:42:54.780 align:start position:0%
the one you presented first or the
 
00:42:57.349 --> 00:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
amendment yeah or the amendment
 
00:43:00.109 --> 00:43:00.119 align:start position:0%
or both of them or this or this new
 
00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
ethics both of them have cement legal
 
00:43:03.359 --> 00:43:04.790 align:start position:0%
ethics both of them have cement legal
difficulties

00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
difficulties
 
00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:08.220 align:start position:0%
one uh in the so-called Xi'an Amendment
 
00:43:10.250 --> 00:43:10.260 align:start position:0%
uh dependent
 
00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
on okay a lawyer is going to have a
 
00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:16.520 align:start position:0%
field day with that if it comes to that
 
00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
uh in a challenge uh same thing with
 
00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
cares for in the original 301. lawyers
 
00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
going to have a field day with it I do
 
00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:29.640 align:start position:0%
not believe that there is a single word
 
00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
in the English language
 
00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
that is going to fit in either instance
 
00:43:38.990 --> 00:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
that a lawyer cannot challenge
 
00:43:40.849 --> 00:43:40.859 align:start position:0%
well we already have don't we already
 
00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
have Financial dependent
 
00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:45.060 align:start position:0%
in the statute now
 
00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:46.490 align:start position:0%
in the statute now
no

00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:46.500 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:43:48.770 --> 00:43:48.780 align:start position:0%
guest household member you not you say
 
00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:09.660 align:start position:0%
and it also incla includes special
 
00:44:13.069 --> 00:44:13.079 align:start position:0%
interests which I'm I'm I'm not a fan of
 
00:44:15.349 --> 00:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
but that's but I'm still trying to get
 
00:44:18.349 --> 00:44:18.359 align:start position:0%
on this how far and you'd you would
 
00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
think this is the easiest question we
 
00:44:21.470 --> 00:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
have today
 
00:44:25.390 --> 00:44:25.400 align:start position:0%
um how far from the legislator
 
00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
if we're if we're looking at
 
00:44:36.890 --> 00:44:36.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:40.130 --> 00:44:40.140 align:start position:0%
if what we're saying here is is really
 
00:44:43.130 --> 00:44:43.140 align:start position:0%
pretty much what's on page 36.
 
00:44:44.809 --> 00:44:44.819 align:start position:0%
and it seems to be
 
00:44:48.470 --> 00:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
in in the in the Gordon Amendment no but
 
00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
I mean in any in anything is what this
 
00:44:53.930 --> 00:44:53.940 align:start position:0%
with four amendments in front of me
 
00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
we're doing a rewrite that's that's
 
00:45:00.109 --> 00:45:00.119 align:start position:0%
what's happening here so the
 
00:45:02.930 --> 00:45:02.940 align:start position:0%
if we're discussing that the the bound
 
00:45:04.309 --> 00:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
rate because we're geographical here if
 
00:45:06.290 --> 00:45:06.300 align:start position:0%
we're discussing what the the barriers
 
00:45:08.329 --> 00:45:08.339 align:start position:0%
the walls whatever it is we're gonna how
 
00:45:10.130 --> 00:45:10.140 align:start position:0%
far out you're gonna go if what's on
 
00:45:11.569 --> 00:45:11.579 align:start position:0%
page 36 is pretty much what we're
 
00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
agreeing to right now then let's just
 
00:45:16.250 --> 00:45:16.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:20.329 --> 00:45:20.339 align:start position:0%
it doesn't need to change is everybody
 
00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
happy with I guess it's uh Romans 6 on
 
00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:38.510 --> 00:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:41.329 align:start position:0%
 
look

00:45:41.329 --> 00:45:41.339 align:start position:0%
look
 
00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
it's the tightest definition it's
 
00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
um it's the tightest definition we're
 
00:45:49.309 --> 00:45:49.319 align:start position:0%
gonna get which is already and basically
 
00:45:51.589 --> 00:45:51.599 align:start position:0%
already there it's it's the tightest
 
00:45:51.599 --> 00:45:53.210 align:start position:0%
already there it's it's the tightest
um

00:45:53.210 --> 00:45:53.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:55.250 align:start position:0%
um
the

00:45:55.250 --> 00:45:55.260 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:45:58.190 --> 00:45:58.200 align:start position:0%
so am I like that's it's fine with me is
 
00:45:59.450 --> 00:45:59.460 align:start position:0%
a but
 
00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:00.589 align:start position:0%
a but
um

00:46:00.589 --> 00:46:00.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:03.650 --> 00:46:03.660 align:start position:0%
I would say I I would like conceptually
 
00:46:06.349 --> 00:46:06.359 align:start position:0%
I would like to go wrong further to you
 
00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
know people that aren't necessarily in
 
00:46:09.770 --> 00:46:09.780 align:start position:0%
the household but but like I said we
 
00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:10.670 align:start position:0%
the household but but like I said we
come

00:46:10.670 --> 00:46:10.680 align:start position:0%
come
 
00:46:13.130 --> 00:46:13.140 align:start position:0%
I see the I see The Other Side of Heaven
 
00:46:15.950 --> 00:46:15.960 align:start position:0%
language that's difficult to get that on
 
00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
paper and Concepts I understand it but
 
00:46:20.930 --> 00:46:20.940 align:start position:0%
putting that in words I think the
 
00:46:23.569 --> 00:46:23.579 align:start position:0%
nodding long does pretty good Amendment
 
00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
does a pretty good job of that not not
 
00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
properly available for otherwise
 
00:46:30.770 --> 00:46:30.780 align:start position:0%
similarly situated individuals uh is a
 
00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:33.480 align:start position:0%
probably the best attempt at going
 
00:46:35.450 --> 00:46:35.460 align:start position:0%
see I I would disagree with um
 
00:46:37.250 --> 00:46:37.260 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson I don't think I
 
00:46:39.050 --> 00:46:39.060 align:start position:0%
think this one is a little bit expanding
 
00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
of the definition then then
 
00:46:45.770 --> 00:46:45.780 align:start position:0%
um and I I like it yeah um
 
00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:47.089 align:start position:0%
um and I I like it yeah um
that

00:46:47.089 --> 00:46:47.099 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:46:49.309 --> 00:46:49.319 align:start position:0%
not properly available for otherwise
 
00:46:52.130 --> 00:46:52.140 align:start position:0%
similarly situated individuals it's
 
00:46:53.930 --> 00:46:53.940 align:start position:0%
pretty good
 
00:46:56.569 --> 00:46:56.579 align:start position:0%
um but if if you were forcing my hand to
 
00:46:58.849 --> 00:46:58.859 align:start position:0%
say oh you know to get something through
 
00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
or are you okay with just this
 
00:47:02.990 --> 00:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
definition yeah yeah I'm fine with it
 
00:47:06.109 --> 00:47:06.119 align:start position:0%
yes Terry I I can tell you that one of
 
00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
the things that the Ethics Committee did
 
00:47:11.809 --> 00:47:11.819 align:start position:0%
agree on was uh retaining the current
 
00:47:14.210 --> 00:47:14.220 align:start position:0%
definition the household definition and
 
00:47:17.329 --> 00:47:17.339 align:start position:0%
that and and I think the the reason for
 
00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
that ultimately is uh
 
00:47:23.390 --> 00:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
because you you and the committee have
 
00:47:26.089 --> 00:47:26.099 align:start position:0%
different perspectives in terms you have
 
00:47:28.370 --> 00:47:28.380 align:start position:0%
a perspective of this is a guideline for
 
00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:29.230 align:start position:0%
a perspective of this is a guideline for
people

00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:29.240 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:47:32.210 --> 00:47:32.220 align:start position:0%
the Ethics Committee looks at this as a
 
00:47:33.890 --> 00:47:33.900 align:start position:0%
code of conduct
 
00:47:37.609 --> 00:47:37.619 align:start position:0%
and it's and is your piece a code of con
 
00:47:40.309 --> 00:47:40.319 align:start position:0%
is that well the whole the whole
 
00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
guideline book we we call it a guideline
 
00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
because that's what we've defined it as
 
00:47:46.490 --> 00:47:46.500 align:start position:0%
but I can tell you every other state
 
00:47:48.650 --> 00:47:48.660 align:start position:0%
that has something similar calls it a
 
00:47:53.089 --> 00:47:53.099 align:start position:0%
code of conduct and the reason and and
 
00:47:54.770 --> 00:47:54.780 align:start position:0%
the reason that it's more than a
 
00:47:56.630 --> 00:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
guideline is that there are penalties
 
00:48:00.109 --> 00:48:00.119 align:start position:0%
for people if they don't comply and
 
00:48:02.089 --> 00:48:02.099 align:start position:0%
we've we've had one person for example
 
00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:04.140 align:start position:0%
who's pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor
 
00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
for violating these rules
 
00:48:10.970 --> 00:48:10.980 align:start position:0%
so we want to make it as clear and as
 
00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
definable as possible and I think if you
 
00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:15.960 align:start position:0%
contain it to household member
 
00:48:19.130 --> 00:48:19.140 align:start position:0%
then then you know that's somebody that
 
00:48:21.770 --> 00:48:21.780 align:start position:0%
lives in the same house is definable as
 
00:48:25.790 --> 00:48:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:28.609 --> 00:48:28.619 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't have any problem leaving it
 
00:48:31.490 --> 00:48:31.500 align:start position:0%
as Romans 6 does
 
00:48:31.500 --> 00:48:34.370 align:start position:0%
as Romans 6 does
yes

00:48:34.370 --> 00:48:34.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:36.890 --> 00:48:36.900 align:start position:0%
I believe we need to leave it as we have
 
00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:39.660 align:start position:0%
it on page 36 Roman numeral six
 
00:48:40.970 --> 00:48:40.980 align:start position:0%
because you have to take it a little
 
00:48:42.410 --> 00:48:42.420 align:start position:0%
further than just living in the
 
00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
household you have to read the whole
 
00:48:47.569 --> 00:48:47.579 align:start position:0%
thing someone has a common interest in
 
00:48:50.450 --> 00:48:50.460 align:start position:0%
the expenses of daily living I think
 
00:48:53.329 --> 00:48:53.339 align:start position:0%
that that extension of household member
 
00:48:55.130 --> 00:48:55.140 align:start position:0%
is critically important and that's why I
 
00:48:56.930 --> 00:48:56.940 align:start position:0%
want to keep the same definition but
 
00:48:59.210 --> 00:48:59.220 align:start position:0%
that expands it beyond that definable
 
00:49:01.970 --> 00:49:01.980 align:start position:0%
who lives in your household
 
00:49:03.770 --> 00:49:03.780 align:start position:0%
I think we're familiar with the current
 
00:49:06.829 --> 00:49:06.839 align:start position:0%
definition so I if
 
00:49:06.839 --> 00:49:10.609 align:start position:0%
definition so I if
okay

00:49:10.609 --> 00:49:10.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:16.670 --> 00:49:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:18.050 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:49:18.050 --> 00:49:18.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:22.370 --> 00:49:22.380 align:start position:0%
so then we go from there
 
00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:23.270 align:start position:0%
so then we go from there
um

00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
into maybe this is where
 
00:49:30.050 --> 00:49:30.060 align:start position:0%
um the other half or the other part of
 
00:49:35.390 --> 00:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:40.390 --> 00:49:40.400 align:start position:0%
the idea of conflict of interest
 
00:49:44.329 --> 00:49:44.339 align:start position:0%
they all seem to have
 
00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
I don't know is anyone going to say they
 
00:49:51.490 --> 00:49:51.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:54.190 --> 00:49:54.200 align:start position:0%
the same concept in different language
 
00:49:56.990 --> 00:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
is is it a distinction without a
 
00:49:58.430 --> 00:49:58.440 align:start position:0%
difference here what are you comparing
 
00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
so I'm trying to compare all of them but
 
00:50:03.950 --> 00:50:03.960 align:start position:0%
from the standpoint
 
00:50:06.770 --> 00:50:06.780 align:start position:0%
um the original 301 as well as the
 
00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
amendment deals with
 
00:50:14.030 --> 00:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
recusal and disclosure differently it
 
00:50:17.089 --> 00:50:17.099 align:start position:0%
deals with disclosure
 
00:50:18.650 --> 00:50:18.660 align:start position:0%
um in order to represent your
 
00:50:18.660 --> 00:50:20.450 align:start position:0%
um in order to represent your
constituents

00:50:20.450 --> 00:50:20.460 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
when you want to participate in
 
00:50:25.970 --> 00:50:25.980 align:start position:0%
committee or debate on the floor but
 
00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:34.910 --> 00:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure if and and it seems
 
00:50:37.010 --> 00:50:37.020 align:start position:0%
that the amendment the Gordon Amendment
 
00:50:39.530 --> 00:50:39.540 align:start position:0%
I'll call it rather than the ethics
 
00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment but the Gordon Amendment also
 
00:50:43.970 --> 00:50:43.980 align:start position:0%
says legislators shall recuse from
 
00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:45.290 align:start position:0%
says legislators shall recuse from
voting

00:50:45.290 --> 00:50:45.300 align:start position:0%
voting
 
00:50:47.569 --> 00:50:47.579 align:start position:0%
on any legislation when the legislator
 
00:50:49.370 --> 00:50:49.380 align:start position:0%
or a member of the legislative's
 
00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:50.390 align:start position:0%
or a member of the legislative's
household

00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
household
 
00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
shall receive a direct Financial benefit
 
00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:55.010 align:start position:0%
shall receive a direct Financial benefit
so

00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:55.020 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:50:59.930 --> 00:50:59.940 align:start position:0%
are we okay with the idea that of two
 
00:51:03.109 --> 00:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
levels where
 
00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
um one is
 
00:51:08.170 --> 00:51:08.180 align:start position:0%
a verbal disclosure when you are
 
00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
testifying or debating
 
00:51:14.930 --> 00:51:14.940 align:start position:0%
and a and a recusal
 
00:51:18.890 --> 00:51:18.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:20.930 --> 00:51:20.940 align:start position:0%
that's different than what we currently
 
00:51:24.410 --> 00:51:24.420 align:start position:0%
have and that's what places recusal in
 
00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:26.089 align:start position:0%
have and that's what places recusal in
our

00:51:26.089 --> 00:51:26.099 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:51:28.010 --> 00:51:28.020 align:start position:0%
in our vernacular
 
00:51:30.410 --> 00:51:30.420 align:start position:0%
and I'm and I'm
 
00:51:33.770 --> 00:51:33.780 align:start position:0%
um delinquent here I uh at one point
 
00:51:36.410 --> 00:51:36.420 align:start position:0%
um represent uh Paul Smith asked if he
 
00:51:38.710 --> 00:51:38.720 align:start position:0%
would had something to say and I forgot
 
00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I just wanted to
 
00:51:44.329 --> 00:51:44.339 align:start position:0%
uh join my my friend the former member
 
00:51:46.430 --> 00:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
from Bristol up here in talking about a
 
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
little bit about this um as well
 
00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
especially in terms of the disclosure
 
00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
recusal good timing and then sort of the
 
00:51:55.970 --> 00:51:55.980 align:start position:0%
the generalities and and specifically
 
00:51:57.589 --> 00:51:57.599 align:start position:0%
representative Tierney's point a few
 
00:51:59.150 --> 00:51:59.160 align:start position:0%
minutes ago in representative koscibles
 
00:52:00.829 --> 00:52:00.839 align:start position:0%
so there's there's a lot going on here
 
00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
that affects the the operation on the
 
00:52:05.329 --> 00:52:05.339 align:start position:0%
floor and in our house rules as well uh
 
00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:07.260 align:start position:0%
because as you know uh our house rules
 
00:52:09.890 --> 00:52:09.900 align:start position:0%
do deal with Declaration of intent and
 
00:52:12.770 --> 00:52:12.780 align:start position:0%
and how that is affected as well at the
 
00:52:14.089 --> 00:52:14.099 align:start position:0%
committee level
 
00:52:16.549 --> 00:52:16.559 align:start position:0%
um I do want to I do want to point out a
 
00:52:18.349 --> 00:52:18.359 align:start position:0%
couple of things specific to the point
 
00:52:21.290 --> 00:52:21.300 align:start position:0%
of recusal and disclosure uh last week
 
00:52:23.870 --> 00:52:23.880 align:start position:0%
was a perfect example there was a um a
 
00:52:25.250 --> 00:52:25.260 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment concurrent
 
00:52:28.130 --> 00:52:28.140 align:start position:0%
resolution raising the judicial uh age
 
00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
limit from 70 to 75 and that was
 
00:52:32.930 --> 00:52:32.940 align:start position:0%
sponsored by the former Chief Justice of
 
00:52:37.250 --> 00:52:37.260 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court now he disclosed in
 
00:52:41.210 --> 00:52:41.220 align:start position:0%
his testimony on the floor that he would
 
00:52:43.250 --> 00:52:43.260 align:start position:0%
not benefit from it because of the
 
00:52:45.049 --> 00:52:45.059 align:start position:0%
retroactive nature of our constitution
 
00:52:49.069 --> 00:52:49.079 align:start position:0%
but more especially that even if this
 
00:52:51.230 --> 00:52:51.240 align:start position:0%
were to be enrolled and we didn't have
 
00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
that issue of retrospectivity uh that
 
00:52:56.990 --> 00:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
that he would be past 75 at that point
 
00:53:00.650 --> 00:53:00.660 align:start position:0%
so um it it was good that he disclosed
 
00:53:00.660 --> 00:53:01.910 align:start position:0%
so um it it was good that he disclosed
that

00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:53:05.690 --> 00:53:05.700 align:start position:0%
um in that General sense but there are
 
00:53:08.089 --> 00:53:08.099 align:start position:0%
other issues here at play as well and I
 
00:53:09.829 --> 00:53:09.839 align:start position:0%
I want to address something specifically
 
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
because frm is a perfect example two
 
00:53:13.549 --> 00:53:13.559 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
00:53:13.559 --> 00:53:14.150 align:start position:0%
years ago
um

00:53:14.150 --> 00:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:16.130 --> 00:53:16.140 align:start position:0%
in the state budget excuse me does
 
00:53:20.270 --> 00:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
everybody know frm that conversation
 
00:53:23.150 --> 00:53:23.160 align:start position:0%
um yeah real quick can you give a real
 
00:53:25.130 --> 00:53:25.140 align:start position:0%
quick or do you want me to I'll let you
 
00:53:27.290 --> 00:53:27.300 align:start position:0%
handle that
 
00:53:29.930 --> 00:53:29.940 align:start position:0%
um it's not a real quick subject so um
 
00:53:32.030 --> 00:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
there there were
 
00:53:34.790 --> 00:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
um there was a financial services firm
 
00:53:36.950 --> 00:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
and and a number of people in New
 
00:53:39.230 --> 00:53:39.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire lost money with this financial
 
00:53:41.329 --> 00:53:41.339 align:start position:0%
services firm
 
00:53:44.450 --> 00:53:44.460 align:start position:0%
um there was a and and through Court
 
00:53:46.130 --> 00:53:46.140 align:start position:0%
through a number of things there was
 
00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:47.630 align:start position:0%
through a number of things there was
fault

00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:47.640 align:start position:0%
fault
 
00:53:51.470 --> 00:53:51.480 align:start position:0%
um adjudicated and ultimately the
 
00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
legislature created a fund
 
00:53:58.430 --> 00:53:58.440 align:start position:0%
um to repay some of the obligations of
 
00:54:01.309 --> 00:54:01.319 align:start position:0%
the frm customers and we did have I
 
00:54:02.930 --> 00:54:02.940 align:start position:0%
don't know how many but we had at least
 
00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
one legislator that benefited from that
 
00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:06.650 align:start position:0%
one legislator that benefited from that
that

00:54:06.650 --> 00:54:06.660 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:08.210 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:54:08.210 --> 00:54:08.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:11.150 --> 00:54:11.160 align:start position:0%
refund or something so that's not really
 
00:54:13.190 --> 00:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
great and that specific point Mr
 
00:54:15.470 --> 00:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
chairman I I would mention that when
 
00:54:17.329 --> 00:54:17.339 align:start position:0%
that when that came up in the budget
 
00:54:20.930 --> 00:54:20.940 align:start position:0%
last year which which was uh a different
 
00:54:23.150 --> 00:54:23.160 align:start position:0%
sort of way to handle it
 
00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
um the the issue there was a floor
 
00:54:28.250 --> 00:54:28.260 align:start position:0%
Amendment drafted to remove that from
 
00:54:30.349 --> 00:54:30.359 align:start position:0%
the budget and the specific member that
 
00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
you're referencing did declare a
 
00:54:34.250 --> 00:54:34.260 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest and did not
 
00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
participate on that Amendment
 
00:54:38.450 --> 00:54:38.460 align:start position:0%
and further
 
00:54:40.849 --> 00:54:40.859 align:start position:0%
did participate on the underlying Bill
 
00:54:43.490 --> 00:54:43.500 align:start position:0%
the the final action of the bill which
 
00:54:45.950 --> 00:54:45.960 align:start position:0%
in my opinion at the time uh because the
 
00:54:49.010 --> 00:54:49.020 align:start position:0%
member did speak with me I suggested was
 
00:54:51.710 --> 00:54:51.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate because you can't you can't
 
00:54:55.849 --> 00:54:55.859 align:start position:0%
vote on a uh a 10 billion dollar budget
 
00:54:57.829 --> 00:54:57.839 align:start position:0%
um and that affects the entire state
 
00:54:59.750 --> 00:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
with everything else without you know
 
00:55:02.210 --> 00:55:02.220 align:start position:0%
dealing with that part it was proper for
 
00:55:04.609 --> 00:55:04.619 align:start position:0%
him to recuse himself on that Amendment
 
00:55:07.190 --> 00:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
because it directly did benefit him from
 
00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:08.089 align:start position:0%
because it directly did benefit him from
him

00:55:08.089 --> 00:55:08.099 align:start position:0%
him
 
00:55:10.010 --> 00:55:10.020 align:start position:0%
and and to representative Tierney's
 
00:55:12.349 --> 00:55:12.359 align:start position:0%
point that he was Raising earlier that
 
00:55:15.049 --> 00:55:15.059 align:start position:0%
has always sort of been uh in in my
 
00:55:16.490 --> 00:55:16.500 align:start position:0%
dealings with ethics over the years
 
00:55:19.430 --> 00:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
which have been numerous that was sort
 
00:55:21.950 --> 00:55:21.960 align:start position:0%
of always the the the understanding and
 
00:55:24.349 --> 00:55:24.359 align:start position:0%
what I spoke with members because I will
 
00:55:26.690 --> 00:55:26.700 align:start position:0%
be honest with you a lot of times and if
 
00:55:29.329 --> 00:55:29.339 align:start position:0%
if some of you have filed uh with me on
 
00:55:30.589 --> 00:55:30.599 align:start position:0%
the floor before
 
00:55:33.410 --> 00:55:33.420 align:start position:0%
it usually happens at the last minute
 
00:55:35.630 --> 00:55:35.640 align:start position:0%
it usually happens that a member comes
 
00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:38.640 align:start position:0%
up to me 30 seconds before the vote on
 
00:55:41.569 --> 00:55:41.579 align:start position:0%
the bill saying I can't vote on this
 
00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
uh and and with with
 
00:55:47.270 --> 00:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
I try to have a quick conversation with
 
00:55:50.270 --> 00:55:50.280 align:start position:0%
them and and generally it's me usually
 
00:55:52.490 --> 00:55:52.500 align:start position:0%
pushing the form at them and saying okay
 
00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
fill this out and we'll move on uh but
 
00:55:59.329 --> 00:55:59.339 align:start position:0%
the question is raise a lot do you
 
00:56:01.849 --> 00:56:01.859 align:start position:0%
benefit directly from this more than
 
00:56:03.829 --> 00:56:03.839 align:start position:0%
anybody else here
 
00:56:06.410 --> 00:56:06.420 align:start position:0%
more than anybody else in your situation
 
00:56:09.230 --> 00:56:09.240 align:start position:0%
and that has always been our our line
 
00:56:12.349 --> 00:56:12.359 align:start position:0%
that that and and that if that line has
 
00:56:14.030 --> 00:56:14.040 align:start position:0%
changed then that's a different story
 
00:56:17.870 --> 00:56:17.880 align:start position:0%
but that was the that was the line
 
00:56:20.750 --> 00:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
um specifically last week we had a
 
00:56:23.870 --> 00:56:23.880 align:start position:0%
situation uh regarding the the uh
 
00:56:26.990 --> 00:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
retirement benefit the the way that bill
 
00:56:29.930 --> 00:56:29.940 align:start position:0%
was drafted however it there was an
 
00:56:32.569 --> 00:56:32.579 align:start position:0%
impact if you were above a certain
 
00:56:32.579 --> 00:56:33.950 align:start position:0%
impact if you were above a certain
amount

00:56:33.950 --> 00:56:33.960 align:start position:0%
amount
 
00:56:36.770 --> 00:56:36.780 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't impact you if you were below
 
00:56:39.710 --> 00:56:39.720 align:start position:0%
a certain amount it would and there were
 
00:56:43.190 --> 00:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
people uh that came up to me and asked
 
00:56:44.569 --> 00:56:44.579 align:start position:0%
about that
 
00:56:47.390 --> 00:56:47.400 align:start position:0%
and said oh never mind I'm in this it's
 
00:56:49.010 --> 00:56:49.020 align:start position:0%
the group two retirees as you could
 
00:56:50.390 --> 00:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
probably imagine
 
00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
um I'm above this this portion here so
 
00:56:58.130 --> 00:56:58.140 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't affect me and there would be
 
00:57:00.589 --> 00:57:00.599 align:start position:0%
on the other side so so yes there
 
00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
probably were some folks in the room but
 
00:57:05.569 --> 00:57:05.579 align:start position:0%
the question is one does it affect you
 
00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
more than anybody else in the room
 
00:57:10.970 --> 00:57:10.980 align:start position:0%
um additionally we do have a
 
00:57:13.730 --> 00:57:13.740 align:start position:0%
representative whose wife sits
 
00:57:16.549 --> 00:57:16.559 align:start position:0%
on the bench in a court and he did
 
00:57:19.990 --> 00:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
recuse himself on that cacr uh uh
 
00:57:23.089 --> 00:57:23.099 align:start position:0%
respective to the um the judicial term
 
00:57:27.170 --> 00:57:27.180 align:start position:0%
limits so it is it is a fine line uh and
 
00:57:29.210 --> 00:57:29.220 align:start position:0%
it always has been a fine line and we've
 
00:57:31.670 --> 00:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
I've tried to work collaboratively with
 
00:57:34.609 --> 00:57:34.619 align:start position:0%
my friends on ethics and and not just on
 
00:57:36.530 --> 00:57:36.540 align:start position:0%
this issue but but other issues as well
 
00:57:39.349 --> 00:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
over the years uh but but the but the
 
00:57:42.049 --> 00:57:42.059 align:start position:0%
point of of conflict of interest is such
 
00:57:44.510 --> 00:57:44.520 align:start position:0%
that even in our rules at the committee
 
00:57:46.250 --> 00:57:46.260 align:start position:0%
level if you file a declaration of
 
00:57:48.770 --> 00:57:48.780 align:start position:0%
intent in my office that's the life of
 
00:57:51.470 --> 00:57:51.480 align:start position:0%
the bill so we put it in the system that
 
00:57:52.849 --> 00:57:52.859 align:start position:0%
you're never going to vote on that bill
 
00:57:55.010 --> 00:57:55.020 align:start position:0%
even if it comes back for concurrence
 
00:57:57.230 --> 00:57:57.240 align:start position:0%
and the bill has been completely gutted
 
00:57:59.150 --> 00:57:59.160 align:start position:0%
by the Senate
 
00:58:01.670 --> 00:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
um you filed the conflict on the life of
 
00:58:03.829 --> 00:58:03.839 align:start position:0%
that bill but it also affects you at the
 
00:58:06.290 --> 00:58:06.300 align:start position:0%
committee level such in our rules that
 
00:58:07.609 --> 00:58:07.619 align:start position:0%
if you've declared a conflict of
 
00:58:09.290 --> 00:58:09.300 align:start position:0%
interest on a bill that's before your
 
00:58:11.690 --> 00:58:11.700 align:start position:0%
committee you don't even count towards
 
00:58:14.329 --> 00:58:14.339 align:start position:0%
the Quorum purposes for that vote on
 
00:58:16.490 --> 00:58:16.500 align:start position:0%
that bill and that's in our house rules
 
00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
problem is no one knows that you know um
 
00:58:21.190 --> 00:58:21.200 align:start position:0%
no one
 
00:58:24.309 --> 00:58:24.319 align:start position:0%
you know it it
 
00:58:27.710 --> 00:58:27.720 align:start position:0%
my analogy is people say all the time
 
00:58:31.370 --> 00:58:31.380 align:start position:0%
well it's on the doe website great right
 
00:58:36.230 --> 00:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
but nobody has the ability without
 
00:58:38.450 --> 00:58:38.460 align:start position:0%
um you know two months of work to and
 
00:58:40.910 --> 00:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
and as you say you have 30 seconds to
 
00:58:43.490 --> 00:58:43.500 align:start position:0%
make this decision right what we're what
 
00:58:45.049 --> 00:58:45.059 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do
 
00:58:48.349 --> 00:58:48.359 align:start position:0%
is get to the point where we have a
 
00:58:48.359 --> 00:58:50.930 align:start position:0%
is get to the point where we have a
workable

00:58:50.930 --> 00:58:50.940 align:start position:0%
workable
 
00:58:55.309 --> 00:58:55.319 align:start position:0%
um not fine line decision where
 
00:58:58.010 --> 00:58:58.020 align:start position:0%
it's much easier for someone sitting in
 
00:59:01.609 --> 00:59:01.619 align:start position:0%
rep soil with 30 seconds to just
 
00:59:03.589 --> 00:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
um and and we've talked about at some
 
00:59:05.870 --> 00:59:05.880 align:start position:0%
point even a decision tree thing to just
 
00:59:08.870 --> 00:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
say this this this okay then you should
 
00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:10.250 align:start position:0%
say this this this okay then you should
recuse

00:59:10.250 --> 00:59:10.260 align:start position:0%
recuse
 
00:59:12.170 --> 00:59:12.180 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if would ever get to
 
00:59:14.210 --> 00:59:14.220 align:start position:0%
that point because there are all of with
 
00:59:17.089 --> 00:59:17.099 align:start position:0%
400 reps there are 400 extenuating
 
00:59:21.770 --> 00:59:21.780 align:start position:0%
circumstances uh probably 405 but it is
 
00:59:26.390 --> 00:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
um it is our hope that by taking each of
 
00:59:30.109 --> 00:59:30.119 align:start position:0%
these sections individually and and as
 
00:59:33.170 --> 00:59:33.180 align:start position:0%
rep Pearson said you know a rewrite
 
00:59:35.089 --> 00:59:35.099 align:start position:0%
so that it is
 
00:59:40.430 --> 00:59:40.440 align:start position:0%
a melding of each suggestion
 
00:59:42.170 --> 00:59:42.180 align:start position:0%
um whether it's from the guideline
 
00:59:45.589 --> 00:59:45.599 align:start position:0%
standpoint or or the uh
 
00:59:48.230 --> 00:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
the code of ethics standpoint I'll call
 
00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:49.130 align:start position:0%
the code of ethics standpoint I'll call
it

00:59:49.130 --> 00:59:49.140 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:59:51.289 --> 00:59:51.299 align:start position:0%
um there has to be some way that we make
 
00:59:53.930 --> 00:59:53.940 align:start position:0%
this better than
 
00:59:55.910 --> 00:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
than just being able to say well it's in
 
00:59:59.210 --> 00:59:59.220 align:start position:0%
there and you should know that and to
 
01:00:00.849 --> 01:00:00.859 align:start position:0%
that point Mr chairman I I
 
01:00:03.470 --> 01:00:03.480 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly agree I think
 
01:00:06.049 --> 01:00:06.059 align:start position:0%
part of the issue in in the decision
 
01:00:08.750 --> 01:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
tree idea is fantastic if we even if we
 
01:00:11.089 --> 01:00:11.099 align:start position:0%
give them a instead of a 40 page
 
01:00:13.849 --> 01:00:13.859 align:start position:0%
document a laminated card I love
 
01:00:15.829 --> 01:00:15.839 align:start position:0%
yourself these 10 questions if you
 
01:00:18.289 --> 01:00:18.299 align:start position:0%
answer yes to three of these then file
 
01:00:21.170 --> 01:00:21.180 align:start position:0%
um but but the point is that too that it
 
01:00:23.809 --> 01:00:23.819 align:start position:0%
is it is problematic you know we we
 
01:00:25.910 --> 01:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
publish our calendars with reports the
 
01:00:28.490 --> 01:00:28.500 align:start position:0%
Thursday before the session and and
 
01:00:31.190 --> 01:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
oftentimes as I said you know 30 seconds
 
01:00:33.829 --> 01:00:33.839 align:start position:0%
before the bill or as debate is being
 
01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
ended I can't vote on this it is it is
 
01:00:39.410 --> 01:00:39.420 align:start position:0%
appropriate especially if if I've got a
 
01:00:41.150 --> 01:00:41.160 align:start position:0%
hundred people that are coming up at the
 
01:00:43.490 --> 01:00:43.500 align:start position:0%
same time on that it's going to be
 
01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:46.319 align:start position:0%
problematic in in getting that
 
01:00:49.069 --> 01:00:49.079 align:start position:0%
implemented quickly because as you know
 
01:00:52.430 --> 01:00:52.440 align:start position:0%
the speaker also reads once the vote is
 
01:00:56.089 --> 01:00:56.099 align:start position:0%
is tallied the speaker also reads who
 
01:00:59.870 --> 01:00:59.880 align:start position:0%
did not it would be proud
 
01:01:02.030 --> 01:01:02.040 align:start position:0%
um there is I'm told just uh
 
01:01:04.069 --> 01:01:04.079 align:start position:0%
tangentially to all of this I'm told
 
01:01:06.349 --> 01:01:06.359 align:start position:0%
that the way our voting system is set up
 
01:01:09.890 --> 01:01:09.900 align:start position:0%
with the red white and green that it
 
01:01:13.150 --> 01:01:13.160 align:start position:0%
would be possible no
 
01:01:17.150 --> 01:01:17.160 align:start position:0%
no we're not we're not set up for we're
 
01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
not set up for a change at this point to
 
01:01:23.390 --> 01:01:23.400 align:start position:0%
to to do that electronically without
 
01:01:25.609 --> 01:01:25.619 align:start position:0%
substantial resources to change the
 
01:01:28.010 --> 01:01:28.020 align:start position:0%
entire electronic system and button
 
01:01:30.410 --> 01:01:30.420 align:start position:0%
system so that would be a an expense to
 
01:01:31.549 --> 01:01:31.559 align:start position:0%
do that
 
01:01:34.609 --> 01:01:34.619 align:start position:0%
what what I was going to say sorry
 
01:01:39.589 --> 01:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
um was that that something as simple as
 
01:01:43.370 --> 01:01:43.380 align:start position:0%
being able to stay in your seat because
 
01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:46.380 align:start position:0%
as we know if you're in the middle
 
01:01:48.650 --> 01:01:48.660 align:start position:0%
um sometimes it's impossible to get to
 
01:01:50.990 --> 01:01:51.000 align:start position:0%
your desk in 30 seconds
 
01:01:53.690 --> 01:01:53.700 align:start position:0%
um but something as simple as being able
 
01:01:56.150 --> 01:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
to double toggle the the white button
 
01:02:00.349 --> 01:02:00.359 align:start position:0%
would would register on your screen and
 
01:02:03.410 --> 01:02:03.420 align:start position:0%
be able to say that's why you don't have
 
01:02:05.270 --> 01:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
to call out their name
 
01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:07.500 align:start position:0%
and then know that they have to come
 
01:02:09.410 --> 01:02:09.420 align:start position:0%
down and fill out paperwork after that
 
01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
that was I'm glad no but I am glad you
 
01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
brought this up because I want to
 
01:02:14.750 --> 01:02:14.760 align:start position:0%
explain how the voting system works uh
 
01:02:16.670 --> 01:02:16.680 align:start position:0%
the white button turns your station off
 
01:02:17.930 --> 01:02:17.940 align:start position:0%
and on
 
01:02:20.030 --> 01:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
um and if it toggles uh which it
 
01:02:22.190 --> 01:02:22.200 align:start position:0%
frequently does because members don't
 
01:02:23.630 --> 01:02:23.640 align:start position:0%
always have their buttons on at the
 
01:02:26.150 --> 01:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate time or vice versa
 
01:02:28.549 --> 01:02:28.559 align:start position:0%
um and and so by doing something like
 
01:02:32.030 --> 01:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
that uh and and as some of you know some
 
01:02:34.309 --> 01:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
people wait until the very till it says
 
01:02:36.109 --> 01:02:36.119 align:start position:0%
one second left to actually register
 
01:02:37.549 --> 01:02:37.559 align:start position:0%
their vote
 
01:02:40.910 --> 01:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
um that you know that that does create a
 
01:02:43.250 --> 01:02:43.260 align:start position:0%
little bit of of a problem but we are we
 
01:02:45.170 --> 01:02:45.180 align:start position:0%
don't really have it set up no I
 
01:02:47.390 --> 01:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
understand that but we also do have you
 
01:02:49.130 --> 01:02:49.140 align:start position:0%
know unless you change the statute about
 
01:02:52.430 --> 01:02:52.440 align:start position:0%
the way you file these Declarations of
 
01:02:54.710 --> 01:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
intent all of those all of those have to
 
01:02:57.049 --> 01:02:57.059 align:start position:0%
be filed and we scan all of those in and
 
01:02:59.930 --> 01:02:59.940 align:start position:0%
they get updated on the website Etc so
 
01:03:01.730 --> 01:03:01.740 align:start position:0%
um you know it would still that right
 
01:03:03.829 --> 01:03:03.839 align:start position:0%
that physical component still has to
 
01:03:06.230 --> 01:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
happen but also the way it's displayed
 
01:03:09.710 --> 01:03:09.720 align:start position:0%
when somebody is recused
 
01:03:13.730 --> 01:03:13.740 align:start position:0%
they show up on my screen blue as
 
01:03:16.309 --> 01:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
opposed to Yellow which means their
 
01:03:18.589 --> 01:03:18.599 align:start position:0%
station is on versus black which means
 
01:03:21.170 --> 01:03:21.180 align:start position:0%
it's not so that's how I know by the way
 
01:03:24.589 --> 01:03:24.599 align:start position:0%
if you're if you haven't voted I look at
 
01:03:26.270 --> 01:03:26.280 align:start position:0%
the and look at the yellow seats as
 
01:03:28.970 --> 01:03:28.980 align:start position:0%
opposed to the green and reds yep and if
 
01:03:30.650 --> 01:03:30.660 align:start position:0%
the yellow seat if the person's there
 
01:03:32.569 --> 01:03:32.579 align:start position:0%
then I call their name but if they've
 
01:03:34.370 --> 01:03:34.380 align:start position:0%
already recused and this is important if
 
01:03:35.990 --> 01:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
they've already recused we've entered
 
01:03:38.750 --> 01:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
them into our system as recused and they
 
01:03:40.370 --> 01:03:40.380 align:start position:0%
show up blue and I don't call their name
 
01:03:43.849 --> 01:03:43.859 align:start position:0%
so that's that's the physical logistic
 
01:03:48.349 --> 01:03:48.359 align:start position:0%
if you will I'm good any questions for
 
01:03:50.750 --> 01:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
nope you good yep
 
01:03:53.089 --> 01:03:53.099 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate the uh
 
01:03:55.190 --> 01:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
the Back stories here
 
01:03:57.470 --> 01:03:57.480 align:start position:0%
um I think
 
01:04:00.770 --> 01:04:00.780 align:start position:0%
our goal is to still provide legislation
 
01:04:04.329 --> 01:04:04.339 align:start position:0%
and I think our goal is to still
 
01:04:07.789 --> 01:04:07.799 align:start position:0%
work with I think the best solution and
 
01:04:10.309 --> 01:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
I may be wrong I think the best solution
 
01:04:14.930 --> 01:04:14.940 align:start position:0%
is to take as much as we can individual
 
01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
um parts that make sense to us and and
 
01:04:21.410 --> 01:04:21.420 align:start position:0%
Cobble them together into
 
01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:22.789 align:start position:0%
Cobble them together into
um

01:04:22.789 --> 01:04:22.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:25.130 --> 01:04:25.140 align:start position:0%
an offering that we bring to the house
 
01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:28.640 align:start position:0%
and say Here's how we think we add in
 
01:04:32.270 --> 01:04:32.280 align:start position:0%
recusal and try not to Tamper as much as
 
01:04:34.670 --> 01:04:34.680 align:start position:0%
possible with any of the existing
 
01:04:38.210 --> 01:04:38.220 align:start position:0%
framework I certainly don't want to play
 
01:04:39.770 --> 01:04:39.780 align:start position:0%
with the buttons
 
01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
um but I but I think it is necessary
 
01:04:45.589 --> 01:04:45.599 align:start position:0%
that we have a different
 
01:04:48.230 --> 01:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
system than trying to make that decision
 
01:04:50.690 --> 01:04:50.700 align:start position:0%
in 30 seconds and
 
01:04:52.910 --> 01:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
fill out the correct paperwork in that
 
01:04:55.789 --> 01:04:55.799 align:start position:0%
time period and all of those things that
 
01:04:58.910 --> 01:04:58.920 align:start position:0%
is my I do have a question
 
01:05:01.789 --> 01:05:01.799 align:start position:0%
yeah could I add just one more thing to
 
01:05:03.950 --> 01:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
the greater picture Mr chairman I I you
 
01:05:06.650 --> 01:05:06.660 align:start position:0%
know we've experienced a lot in this in
 
01:05:09.950 --> 01:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
this Committee in the last 15 years uh
 
01:05:12.109 --> 01:05:12.119 align:start position:0%
you know several years ago in in the
 
01:05:15.710 --> 01:05:15.720 align:start position:0%
election after 2010 a member uh was the
 
01:05:17.809 --> 01:05:17.819 align:start position:0%
executive director of a State political
 
01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
party and this committee at the time
 
01:05:22.910 --> 01:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
looked into whether or not that violated
 
01:05:25.490 --> 01:05:25.500 align:start position:0%
the section of the Constitution that uh
 
01:05:27.890 --> 01:05:27.900 align:start position:0%
chairman Gordon mentioned and at the
 
01:05:29.450 --> 01:05:29.460 align:start position:0%
time it was determined that they did not
 
01:05:31.970 --> 01:05:31.980 align:start position:0%
however several years later a member of
 
01:05:36.410 --> 01:05:36.420 align:start position:0%
the house uh signed in as representing a
 
01:05:40.609 --> 01:05:40.619 align:start position:0%
group and not himself as his as his
 
01:05:43.849 --> 01:05:43.859 align:start position:0%
office as representative from Merrimack
 
01:05:46.970 --> 01:05:46.980 align:start position:0%
whatever he signed in as a board member
 
01:05:50.450 --> 01:05:50.460 align:start position:0%
of a uh political on the blue sheets or
 
01:05:50.460 --> 01:05:51.130 align:start position:0%
of a uh political on the blue sheets or
something

01:05:51.130 --> 01:05:51.140 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:05:54.049 --> 01:05:54.059 align:start position:0%
and and this raised a serious question
 
01:05:57.530 --> 01:05:57.540 align:start position:0%
at the time if that did uh violate that
 
01:06:00.170 --> 01:06:00.180 align:start position:0%
constitutional section that we we've
 
01:06:02.630 --> 01:06:02.640 align:start position:0%
discussed so I do think some some
 
01:06:05.089 --> 01:06:05.099 align:start position:0%
clarification while we're talking about
 
01:06:07.730 --> 01:06:07.740 align:start position:0%
this globally would would help ratify
 
01:06:09.829 --> 01:06:09.839 align:start position:0%
that uh and rectify that in the future
 
01:06:11.809 --> 01:06:11.819 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative Pearson happy
 
01:06:14.630 --> 01:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:16.670 --> 01:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
you just got me thinking about
 
01:06:18.770 --> 01:06:18.780 align:start position:0%
forms and buttons and things of that
 
01:06:22.190 --> 01:06:22.200 align:start position:0%
nature in the in the interest of
 
01:06:26.750 --> 01:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
time and the moment is it possible for a
 
01:06:29.450 --> 01:06:29.460 align:start position:0%
member to take a walk and then fill the
 
01:06:31.549 --> 01:06:31.559 align:start position:0%
form out after
 
01:06:33.710 --> 01:06:33.720 align:start position:0%
that way they've they haven't voted
 
01:06:35.870 --> 01:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
because they're like this is going to be
 
01:06:37.130 --> 01:06:37.140 align:start position:0%
a problem
 
01:06:38.930 --> 01:06:38.940 align:start position:0%
and rather than holding up the process
 
01:06:40.670 --> 01:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
they take a walk and then just fill out
 
01:06:41.930 --> 01:06:41.940 align:start position:0%
it at you know you know what I'm saying
 
01:06:43.849 --> 01:06:43.859 align:start position:0%
so I I will tell you from from a
 
01:06:45.829 --> 01:06:45.839 align:start position:0%
historical perspective as recently as
 
01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
three weeks ago a member came up and and
 
01:06:51.349 --> 01:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
rather than be in the room so so the
 
01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
member did fill out the paperwork
 
01:06:56.150 --> 01:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
um and as the voting was about to begin
 
01:06:58.730 --> 01:06:58.740 align:start position:0%
the member left the room so it it didn't
 
01:07:02.210 --> 01:07:02.220 align:start position:0%
he didn't even actually you know remain
 
01:07:04.849 --> 01:07:04.859 align:start position:0%
in his seat but we did you know still
 
01:07:06.650 --> 01:07:06.660 align:start position:0%
state that the member did not
 
01:07:08.750 --> 01:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
participate so he did take a walk in
 
01:07:11.089 --> 01:07:11.099 align:start position:0%
that in that perspective uh physically
 
01:07:14.150 --> 01:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
but he was still excused for the vote
 
01:07:16.670 --> 01:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
um in the sense that if if they're
 
01:07:18.349 --> 01:07:18.359 align:start position:0%
running out of time if they're coming up
 
01:07:20.990 --> 01:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
at that last second and and they they
 
01:07:23.510 --> 01:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
can certainly do that and I will
 
01:07:25.609 --> 01:07:25.619 align:start position:0%
um you know because of the situation we
 
01:07:28.730 --> 01:07:28.740 align:start position:0%
will excuse that vote uh and for the
 
01:07:30.770 --> 01:07:30.780 align:start position:0%
record you know if you look at your
 
01:07:32.690 --> 01:07:32.700 align:start position:0%
voting records online there are three
 
01:07:35.870 --> 01:07:35.880 align:start position:0%
things that show up voting yes or no or
 
01:07:38.690 --> 01:07:38.700 align:start position:0%
not voting not used or no not voting
 
01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:40.130 align:start position:0%
not voting not used or no not voting
excused

01:07:40.130 --> 01:07:40.140 align:start position:0%
excused
 
01:07:42.770 --> 01:07:42.780 align:start position:0%
um and the when when you filed a
 
01:07:44.450 --> 01:07:44.460 align:start position:0%
conflict or if you've called my office
 
01:07:46.010 --> 01:07:46.020 align:start position:0%
ahead of time because you're sick that
 
01:07:47.930 --> 01:07:47.940 align:start position:0%
day it will always show up as not voting
 
01:07:50.870 --> 01:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
excused it's the same um with a conflict
 
01:07:52.430 --> 01:07:52.440 align:start position:0%
as well so
 
01:07:56.150 --> 01:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:57.710 align:start position:0%
 
almost

01:07:57.710 --> 01:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
almost
 
01:07:59.390 --> 01:07:59.400 align:start position:0%
I will never tell a member to take a
 
01:08:01.789 --> 01:08:01.799 align:start position:0%
walk it
 
01:08:04.609 --> 01:08:04.619 align:start position:0%
sure but what I'm what so if the member
 
01:08:06.529 --> 01:08:06.539 align:start position:0%
takes a walk can they come to your
 
01:08:08.690 --> 01:08:08.700 align:start position:0%
office after session and fill out the
 
01:08:11.210 --> 01:08:11.220 align:start position:0%
recusal paperwork that suggests that
 
01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
that's that that's not appropriate
 
01:08:14.690 --> 01:08:14.700 align:start position:0%
that's not a good tactic I think I think
 
01:08:17.209 --> 01:08:17.219 align:start position:0%
that the member you know if if they
 
01:08:19.189 --> 01:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
recognize in the moments what what's
 
01:08:22.010 --> 01:08:22.020 align:start position:0%
happening if if oh oh no all of a sudden
 
01:08:24.950 --> 01:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh yes my my spouse is going to benefit
 
01:08:27.890 --> 01:08:27.900 align:start position:0%
from this uh I I shouldn't participate
 
01:08:29.930 --> 01:08:29.940 align:start position:0%
and they're you know
 
01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
I will
 
01:08:33.229 --> 01:08:33.239 align:start position:0%
in the moment you know if they're if
 
01:08:34.610 --> 01:08:34.620 align:start position:0%
they're getting up out of their seat to
 
01:08:37.430 --> 01:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
come or to to leave then I think that's
 
01:08:39.050 --> 01:08:39.060 align:start position:0%
the appropriate time
 
01:08:39.060 --> 01:08:39.890 align:start position:0%
the appropriate time
um

01:08:39.890 --> 01:08:39.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:43.070 --> 01:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
again I think the goal here is to let
 
01:08:45.530 --> 01:08:45.540 align:start position:0%
people know as far and I really don't
 
01:08:47.990 --> 01:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
know how to do this uh more than we
 
01:08:49.669 --> 01:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
already do by publishing the calendars
 
01:08:52.130 --> 01:08:52.140 align:start position:0%
with as much notice as we have them
 
01:08:55.070 --> 01:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
um but please take a look through the
 
01:08:58.010 --> 01:08:58.020 align:start position:0%
bills and see if you have a conflict
 
01:09:00.289 --> 01:09:00.299 align:start position:0%
um and notify us as soon as possible so
 
01:09:02.510 --> 01:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
that we can input and I will note just
 
01:09:04.249 --> 01:09:04.259 align:start position:0%
as well that there have been bills on
 
01:09:06.349 --> 01:09:06.359 align:start position:0%
the consent calendar before where
 
01:09:08.450 --> 01:09:08.460 align:start position:0%
there's been a conflict and so somebody
 
01:09:10.729 --> 01:09:10.739 align:start position:0%
has filed a conflict and what that means
 
01:09:12.709 --> 01:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
is you don't actually because you know
 
01:09:14.390 --> 01:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
we adopt the consent calendar in one
 
01:09:16.610 --> 01:09:16.620 align:start position:0%
vote uh what that means is
 
01:09:18.650 --> 01:09:18.660 align:start position:0%
at the end of that vote with the speaker
 
01:09:20.570 --> 01:09:20.580 align:start position:0%
would say uh representative Hill
 
01:09:22.910 --> 01:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
declared a conflict on this bill and did
 
01:09:24.530 --> 01:09:24.540 align:start position:0%
not participate on the vote on the whole
 
01:09:26.930 --> 01:09:26.940 align:start position:0%
consent calendar so um you know that
 
01:09:28.669 --> 01:09:28.679 align:start position:0%
that is happening
 
01:09:31.669 --> 01:09:31.679 align:start position:0%
if we're losing you I have one thing
 
01:09:33.169 --> 01:09:33.179 align:start position:0%
that I would like you to be in the room
 
01:09:34.990 --> 01:09:35.000 align:start position:0%
for um
 
01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
yeah sure yeah I have to leave at
 
01:09:40.070 --> 01:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
quarter past too and I'm sorry for that
 
01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
but quarter past
 
01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:44.590 align:start position:0%
but quarter past
yeah

01:09:44.590 --> 01:09:44.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:47.930 --> 01:09:47.940 align:start position:0%
but I just want to make a call first of
 
01:09:47.940 --> 01:09:48.950 align:start position:0%
but I just want to make a call first of
all

01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:09:51.289 --> 01:09:51.299 align:start position:0%
in terms of that code of conduct that we
 
01:09:54.050 --> 01:09:54.060 align:start position:0%
have we've the legislative Ethics
 
01:09:56.450 --> 01:09:56.460 align:start position:0%
Committee has been in effect for roughly
 
01:09:57.830 --> 01:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
30 years now
 
01:10:00.290 --> 01:10:00.300 align:start position:0%
and I think on six occasions we've
 
01:10:03.169 --> 01:10:03.179 align:start position:0%
actually issued formal punishments I can
 
01:10:04.970 --> 01:10:04.980 align:start position:0%
be corrected but I think that's right in
 
01:10:08.209 --> 01:10:08.219 align:start position:0%
30 years so the Ethics Committee is not
 
01:10:12.169 --> 01:10:12.179 align:start position:0%
a police force going out looking for
 
01:10:15.950 --> 01:10:15.960 align:start position:0%
violations and it's not looking to
 
01:10:19.370 --> 01:10:19.380 align:start position:0%
punish people it's doing in essence what
 
01:10:21.350 --> 01:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
you're looking for representative Hill
 
01:10:23.810 --> 01:10:23.820 align:start position:0%
and that is to have people just do the
 
01:10:27.229 --> 01:10:27.239 align:start position:0%
right thing and that's well which is to
 
01:10:30.290 --> 01:10:30.300 align:start position:0%
your point which is why I asked for and
 
01:10:32.030 --> 01:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
I wish there were more people that did
 
01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:32.870 align:start position:0%
I wish there were more people that did
this

01:10:32.870 --> 01:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
um I asked for the opinion
 
01:10:38.450 --> 01:10:38.460 align:start position:0%
in the in the effort to ask permission
 
01:10:40.610 --> 01:10:40.620 align:start position:0%
rather than forgiveness
 
01:10:40.620 --> 01:10:41.810 align:start position:0%
rather than forgiveness
um

01:10:41.810 --> 01:10:41.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:45.050 --> 01:10:45.060 align:start position:0%
I was hoping that that would provide
 
01:10:45.060 --> 01:10:45.830 align:start position:0%
I was hoping that that would provide
um

01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:48.169 --> 01:10:48.179 align:start position:0%
some kind of guidance
 
01:10:50.870 --> 01:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
um in the future for how things I think
 
01:10:53.330 --> 01:10:53.340 align:start position:0%
it almost precipitated
 
01:10:57.110 --> 01:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
more of a problem than than created a
 
01:10:57.120 --> 01:10:58.450 align:start position:0%
more of a problem than than created a
I

01:10:58.450 --> 01:10:58.460 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
frankly I think that in large part
 
01:11:03.229 --> 01:11:03.239 align:start position:0%
that's why we're here is because we
 
01:11:04.850 --> 01:11:04.860 align:start position:0%
found ourselves dealing with this issue
 
01:11:06.229 --> 01:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
of recusal
 
01:11:09.169 --> 01:11:09.179 align:start position:0%
and no provision for recusal at all in
 
01:11:11.450 --> 01:11:11.460 align:start position:0%
the ethics guidelines and now we're here
 
01:11:14.570 --> 01:11:14.580 align:start position:0%
attempting so why is it so difficult for
 
01:11:16.729 --> 01:11:16.739 align:start position:0%
us to just put that one word in here
 
01:11:20.209 --> 01:11:20.219 align:start position:0%
when all and and to me
 
01:11:22.310 --> 01:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
that's why I keep coming back to this
 
01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:24.110 align:start position:0%
that's why I keep coming back to this
idea

01:11:24.110 --> 01:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
idea
 
01:11:26.450 --> 01:11:26.460 align:start position:0%
um as I pull this string and the and the
 
01:11:28.970 --> 01:11:28.980 align:start position:0%
ball starts getting bigger and bigger
 
01:11:31.490 --> 01:11:31.500 align:start position:0%
um it seems that if we allowed the
 
01:11:33.830 --> 01:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
verbal disclosure
 
01:11:36.770 --> 01:11:36.780 align:start position:0%
for purposes of representing your
 
01:11:39.070 --> 01:11:39.080 align:start position:0%
constituents but
 
01:11:42.229 --> 01:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
simply defaulted
 
01:11:46.610 --> 01:11:46.620 align:start position:0%
to recusal almost as a safe harbor for
 
01:11:49.550 --> 01:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
for a rep to know that that would give
 
01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:50.510 align:start position:0%
for a rep to know that that would give
them

01:11:50.510 --> 01:11:50.520 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:11:56.450 --> 01:11:56.460 align:start position:0%
cover from a from any kind of real well
 
01:11:59.649 --> 01:11:59.659 align:start position:0%
what do you say here real or apparent
 
01:12:02.050 --> 01:12:02.060 align:start position:0%
financial interest
 
01:12:04.729 --> 01:12:04.739 align:start position:0%
there was a word we put in here in the
 
01:12:07.130 --> 01:12:07.140 align:start position:0%
original 301 that said perceived
 
01:12:10.030 --> 01:12:10.040 align:start position:0%
financial interest and that was
 
01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
objected to by the Ethics Committee but
 
01:12:16.910 --> 01:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
but we do talk about apparent improper
 
01:12:19.970 --> 01:12:19.980 align:start position:0%
influences and and so I would suggest
 
01:12:22.310 --> 01:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
that that word could change to a parent
 
01:12:24.770 --> 01:12:24.780 align:start position:0%
but but I would think from the
 
01:12:27.229 --> 01:12:27.239 align:start position:0%
standpoint of a representative wanting
 
01:12:27.239 --> 01:12:29.689 align:start position:0%
standpoint of a representative wanting
to

01:12:29.689 --> 01:12:29.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:32.750 --> 01:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
um alleviate his con his or her concern
 
01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
that they would be a complaint lodged
 
01:12:38.330 --> 01:12:38.340 align:start position:0%
against him that the Safe Harbor would
 
01:12:40.130 --> 01:12:40.140 align:start position:0%
be to
 
01:12:40.140 --> 01:12:41.090 align:start position:0%
be to
um

01:12:41.090 --> 01:12:41.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:44.090 --> 01:12:44.100 align:start position:0%
to recuse and there shouldn't be any
 
01:12:47.270 --> 01:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
resistance to a representative wanting
 
01:12:51.410 --> 01:12:51.420 align:start position:0%
to do that is my is my personal opinion
 
01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
I don't know that's that's where I'm
 
01:12:55.189 --> 01:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
coming from
 
01:12:57.350 --> 01:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
um there was one section in that same
 
01:12:59.870 --> 01:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
piece that I want you both to to be
 
01:13:02.149 --> 01:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
aware of or talk to
 
01:13:05.990 --> 01:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
um and that is 14 C 4 C in the original
 
01:13:09.649 --> 01:13:09.659 align:start position:0%
301 it talks to exclusions for recusal
 
01:13:12.050 --> 01:13:12.060 align:start position:0%
of conflict of interest and that's
 
01:13:14.510 --> 01:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
that's what you were talking about
 
01:13:16.070 --> 01:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
um with
 
01:13:18.530 --> 01:13:18.540 align:start position:0%
uh the budget bill for instance
 
01:13:18.540 --> 01:13:20.209 align:start position:0%
uh the budget bill for instance
um

01:13:20.209 --> 01:13:20.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:22.130 --> 01:13:22.140 align:start position:0%
the more I look at the line that I
 
01:13:23.689 --> 01:13:23.699 align:start position:0%
thought was brilliant when we first put
 
01:13:26.750 --> 01:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
it in I I the less I like it as we go
 
01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:27.470 align:start position:0%
it in I I the less I like it as we go
um

01:13:27.470 --> 01:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:30.370 --> 01:13:30.380 align:start position:0%
which is probably the true nature of uh
 
01:13:33.229 --> 01:13:33.239 align:start position:0%
politics here but
 
01:13:35.209 --> 01:13:35.219 align:start position:0%
um it does seem to me that the
 
01:13:37.550 --> 01:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
restriction on voting shall not apply to
 
01:13:39.950 --> 01:13:39.960 align:start position:0%
budget and General Revenue bills I think
 
01:13:42.169 --> 01:13:42.179 align:start position:0%
we can agree on that
 
01:13:45.290 --> 01:13:45.300 align:start position:0%
what I'm proposing is that we eliminate
 
01:13:45.300 --> 01:13:46.669 align:start position:0%
what I'm proposing is that we eliminate
the

01:13:46.669 --> 01:13:46.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:13:49.850 --> 01:13:49.860 align:start position:0%
the next part that I think was dancing
 
01:13:51.530 --> 01:13:51.540 align:start position:0%
on the head of a pin
 
01:13:54.830 --> 01:13:54.840 align:start position:0%
um because that talk to bills of such
 
01:13:56.630 --> 01:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
great interest where a large percentage
 
01:13:58.669 --> 01:13:58.679 align:start position:0%
of the members would be affected as to
 
01:14:00.290 --> 01:14:00.300 align:start position:0%
cause a problem with Quorum in the
 
01:14:03.590 --> 01:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
committee or full legislative bodies
 
01:14:06.530 --> 01:14:06.540 align:start position:0%
if we eliminate that sentence
 
01:14:10.790 --> 01:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
is that would that be more
 
01:14:14.390 --> 01:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
acceptable to the group or should there
 
01:14:18.250 --> 01:14:18.260 align:start position:0%
be a fix to that group and and
 
01:14:22.669 --> 01:14:22.679 align:start position:0%
where does where would use as chair of
 
01:14:25.850 --> 01:14:25.860 align:start position:0%
the Ethics Committee come down on that
 
01:14:28.370 --> 01:14:28.380 align:start position:0%
and where would the house clerk come
 
01:14:30.770 --> 01:14:30.780 align:start position:0%
down on that that idea that
 
01:14:34.370 --> 01:14:34.380 align:start position:0%
this is this is one of those areas that
 
01:14:37.850 --> 01:14:37.860 align:start position:0%
isn't in the budget perhaps but
 
01:14:40.790 --> 01:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
um but a large number of people
 
01:14:43.010 --> 01:14:43.020 align:start position:0%
um have that problem or have that
 
01:14:43.020 --> 01:14:45.890 align:start position:0%
um have that problem or have that
situation

01:14:45.890 --> 01:14:45.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:51.470 --> 01:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:53.090 --> 01:14:53.100 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to think of a circumstance
 
01:14:55.729 --> 01:14:55.739 align:start position:0%
when that would happen
 
01:14:57.290 --> 01:14:57.300 align:start position:0%
um well
 
01:14:57.300 --> 01:14:58.610 align:start position:0%
um well
um

01:14:58.610 --> 01:14:58.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:01.010 --> 01:15:01.020 align:start position:0%
that it's not in the budget and it's not
 
01:15:03.950 --> 01:15:03.960 align:start position:0%
a general well um we're we're a large
 
01:15:06.410 --> 01:15:06.420 align:start position:0%
number of legislators would have that is
 
01:15:08.030 --> 01:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
common use
 
01:15:10.610 --> 01:15:10.620 align:start position:0%
um current use sorry would that uh we
 
01:15:12.770 --> 01:15:12.780 align:start position:0%
we've already determined that you don't
 
01:15:14.570 --> 01:15:14.580 align:start position:0%
have to be you have to declare a
 
01:15:16.490 --> 01:15:16.500 align:start position:0%
conflict for current use but you and
 
01:15:19.370 --> 01:15:19.380 align:start position:0%
generally taxation matters in general
 
01:15:22.010 --> 01:15:22.020 align:start position:0%
aren't affected current use we've said
 
01:15:24.590 --> 01:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
that you probably have to declare a
 
01:15:27.229 --> 01:15:27.239 align:start position:0%
conflict but not recuse and then there's
 
01:15:30.229 --> 01:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
a specific opinion on that and and when
 
01:15:31.790 --> 01:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
they talk about General Revenue bills
 
01:15:33.350 --> 01:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
are they should they also be talking
 
01:15:36.890 --> 01:15:36.900 align:start position:0%
about General expense bills or is that
 
01:15:36.900 --> 01:15:38.590 align:start position:0%
about General expense bills or is that
not

01:15:38.590 --> 01:15:38.600 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:15:41.330 --> 01:15:41.340 align:start position:0%
Statewide property tax or something like
 
01:15:41.340 --> 01:15:42.290 align:start position:0%
Statewide property tax or something like
that

01:15:42.290 --> 01:15:42.300 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:15:44.149 --> 01:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean
 
01:15:47.209 --> 01:15:47.219 align:start position:0%
no I I don't think taxation is going to
 
01:15:49.250 --> 01:15:49.260 align:start position:0%
affect everyone in general so that would
 
01:15:50.689 --> 01:15:50.699 align:start position:0%
be revenue and that would be an
 
01:15:53.689 --> 01:15:53.699 align:start position:0%
automatic exclusion as far as I can as I
 
01:15:55.189 --> 01:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
read this
 
01:15:57.770 --> 01:15:57.780 align:start position:0%
so so that sentence could as far as
 
01:15:59.030 --> 01:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
you're concerned could come out
 
01:16:01.850 --> 01:16:01.860 align:start position:0%
completely and we wouldn't run into an
 
01:16:03.350 --> 01:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
issue where you can't think of an
 
01:16:05.450 --> 01:16:05.460 align:start position:0%
example where okay is that true for you
 
01:16:10.130 --> 01:16:10.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:11.990 --> 01:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
um anybody else have a comment on that
 
01:16:13.970 --> 01:16:13.980 align:start position:0%
piece if we if we lost that whole
 
01:16:15.950 --> 01:16:15.960 align:start position:0%
sentence would be okay with me you're
 
01:16:19.490 --> 01:16:19.500 align:start position:0%
talking about 14 c4c yes in its entirety
 
01:16:22.970 --> 01:16:22.980 align:start position:0%
no just a second after the word or the
 
01:16:25.550 --> 01:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
word bills right
 
01:16:28.130 --> 01:16:28.140 align:start position:0%
General Revenue bills right so or and
 
01:16:32.930 --> 01:16:32.940 align:start position:0%
then get from oron yes sure okay or on
 
01:16:32.940 --> 01:16:33.649 align:start position:0%
then get from oron yes sure okay or on
yeah

01:16:33.649 --> 01:16:33.659 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:16:33.659 --> 01:16:34.850 align:start position:0%
yeah
um

01:16:34.850 --> 01:16:34.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:37.189 --> 01:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
I think that causes more problems than
 
01:16:40.250 --> 01:16:40.260 align:start position:0%
it fixes
 
01:16:42.050 --> 01:16:42.060 align:start position:0%
um Mr chairman yeah the last thing I
 
01:16:43.850 --> 01:16:43.860 align:start position:0%
just wanted to mention of um the
 
01:16:46.189 --> 01:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
chairman chairman Gordon mentioned um
 
01:16:48.350 --> 01:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
punishment per se
 
01:16:51.110 --> 01:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
um keep in mind uh he mentioned the the
 
01:16:53.390 --> 01:16:53.400 align:start position:0%
member that that that pled guilty to a
 
01:16:55.729 --> 01:16:55.739 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor however the committee it
 
01:16:58.130 --> 01:16:58.140 align:start position:0%
also does have the ability to recommend
 
01:17:00.169 --> 01:17:00.179 align:start position:0%
to the full legislature to the Full
 
01:17:02.330 --> 01:17:02.340 align:start position:0%
House and to the full Senate
 
01:17:05.990 --> 01:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
um the the three inherent uh punishments
 
01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
that the house has the ability to
 
01:17:11.149 --> 01:17:11.159 align:start position:0%
implement which are reprimand Center and
 
01:17:11.159 --> 01:17:12.350 align:start position:0%
implement which are reprimand Center and
expulsion

01:17:12.350 --> 01:17:12.360 align:start position:0%
expulsion
 
01:17:14.689 --> 01:17:14.699 align:start position:0%
um and they have made recommendations in
 
01:17:17.450 --> 01:17:17.460 align:start position:0%
the past to the body uh in those regards
 
01:17:19.910 --> 01:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
in those but those powers do inherently
 
01:17:23.390 --> 01:17:23.400 align:start position:0%
lie with the legislature so that's why
 
01:17:25.310 --> 01:17:25.320 align:start position:0%
um it's just important to note that as
 
01:17:28.490 --> 01:17:28.500 align:start position:0%
well that those nothing nothing in any
 
01:17:31.310 --> 01:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
of these have any influences on any of
 
01:17:33.649 --> 01:17:33.659 align:start position:0%
that for us as far as but they could
 
01:17:35.270 --> 01:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
certainly make that recommendation and
 
01:17:37.490 --> 01:17:37.500 align:start position:0%
you know they if they had opted right in
 
01:17:39.770 --> 01:17:39.780 align:start position:0%
the case of of Representative lay to to
 
01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
make that motion than a member of the
 
01:17:43.189 --> 01:17:43.199 align:start position:0%
Ethics Committee would have brought that
 
01:17:45.350 --> 01:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
on the floor okay
 
01:17:48.410 --> 01:17:48.420 align:start position:0%
yep I have to go but one the other thing
 
01:17:49.790 --> 01:17:49.800 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
01:17:54.590 --> 01:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
and my ignorance about this may impact
 
01:17:57.590 --> 01:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
the house rules as well yeah right now
 
01:18:01.850 --> 01:18:01.860 align:start position:0%
with the way it appears is uh uh 30 days
 
01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
after passage I think at least in the
 
01:18:06.410 --> 01:18:06.420 align:start position:0%
amendment and perhaps it should go into
 
01:18:08.510 --> 01:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
effect at the beginning of the next
 
01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:11.390 align:start position:0%
effect at the beginning of the next
session

01:18:11.390 --> 01:18:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:14.510 --> 01:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
that's probably a great idea anyone have
 
01:18:18.169 --> 01:18:18.179 align:start position:0%
a objection to that or a comment on that
 
01:18:18.179 --> 01:18:19.790 align:start position:0%
a objection to that or a comment on that
um

01:18:19.790 --> 01:18:19.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:22.970 align:start position:0%
um
next

01:18:22.970 --> 01:18:22.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:39.430 --> 01:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:42.709 --> 01:18:42.719 align:start position:0%
great I appreciate that thanks thank you
 
01:18:46.810 --> 01:18:46.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
yes yeah yeah you're good
 
01:18:53.450 --> 01:18:53.460 align:start position:0%
um any other comments that anyone has
 
01:18:55.610 --> 01:18:55.620 align:start position:0%
while we're before we move on to the
 
01:18:58.250 --> 01:18:58.260 align:start position:0%
next section are we still on geography
 
01:19:00.830 --> 01:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
or have we settled that the household
 
01:19:03.290 --> 01:19:03.300 align:start position:0%
of how far away from the legislator yeah
 
01:19:04.790 --> 01:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
it sounds like we've settled that just
 
01:19:06.770 --> 01:19:06.780 align:start position:0%
to leave it alone did by leaving it
 
01:19:10.070 --> 01:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
alone okay and submit and and to my
 
01:19:12.530 --> 01:19:12.540 align:start position:0%
point of view taking that language and
 
01:19:12.540 --> 01:19:14.450 align:start position:0%
point of view taking that language and
and

01:19:14.450 --> 01:19:14.460 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:19:17.149 --> 01:19:17.159 align:start position:0%
um placing it
 
01:19:21.110 --> 01:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
inside the existing form
 
01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:22.010 align:start position:0%
inside the existing form
um

01:19:22.010 --> 01:19:22.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:26.149 --> 01:19:26.159 align:start position:0%
of probably 301 is the way I'm uh the
 
01:19:29.390 --> 01:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry the sheen amendment to 301 is
 
01:19:30.770 --> 01:19:30.780 align:start position:0%
how I'm
 
01:19:32.330 --> 01:19:32.340 align:start position:0%
thinking of it
 
01:19:34.250 --> 01:19:34.260 align:start position:0%
if she if the sheen amendment is going
 
01:19:35.570 --> 01:19:35.580 align:start position:0%
to be the basis to which the rewrite
 
01:19:37.729 --> 01:19:37.739 align:start position:0%
occurs then then maybe that's how we
 
01:19:37.739 --> 01:19:38.510 align:start position:0%
occurs then then maybe that's how we
should

01:19:38.510 --> 01:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
should
 
01:19:40.970 --> 01:19:40.980 align:start position:0%
move forward then if that's
 
01:19:43.070 --> 01:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
if that's going to be the framework
 
01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:45.530 align:start position:0%
if that's going to be the framework
um

01:19:45.530 --> 01:19:45.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:48.649 --> 01:19:48.659 align:start position:0%
that sounds reasonable I I no I agree
 
01:19:50.450 --> 01:19:50.460 align:start position:0%
with that other otherwise we're just
 
01:19:51.709 --> 01:19:51.719 align:start position:0%
going to put all the ingredients of the
 
01:19:54.110 --> 01:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
cake on the table individually in peace
 
01:19:56.570 --> 01:19:56.580 align:start position:0%
yeah and which which is okay too it's
 
01:19:59.930 --> 01:19:59.940 align:start position:0%
just if which is actually how
 
01:20:02.330 --> 01:20:02.340 align:start position:0%
it's in my head
 
01:20:06.649 --> 01:20:06.659 align:start position:0%
um visualizing it um but it what's in my
 
01:20:06.659 --> 01:20:07.850 align:start position:0%
um visualizing it um but it what's in my
head

01:20:07.850 --> 01:20:07.860 align:start position:0%
head
 
01:20:11.390 --> 01:20:11.400 align:start position:0%
um right nobody else uh as is privy to
 
01:20:14.750 --> 01:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
at this point but I would say just for
 
01:20:16.430 --> 01:20:16.440 align:start position:0%
sake of argument
 
01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:17.149 align:start position:0%
sake of argument
um

01:20:17.149 --> 01:20:17.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:20.630 --> 01:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
that if we take on the Xi'an Amendment
 
01:20:22.729 --> 01:20:22.739 align:start position:0%
if we take lines
 
01:20:22.739 --> 01:20:23.510 align:start position:0%
if we take lines
um

01:20:23.510 --> 01:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:26.870 align:start position:0%
um
23

01:20:26.870 --> 01:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:28.189 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:20:28.189 --> 01:20:28.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:20:31.729 --> 01:20:31.739 align:start position:0%
and insert in that language as neatly as
 
01:20:34.790 --> 01:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
possible the
 
01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:35.350 align:start position:0%
possible the
the

01:20:35.350 --> 01:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:20:38.149 --> 01:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
language from
 
01:20:42.890 --> 01:20:42.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:44.990 --> 01:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
insert the household definition yeah
 
01:20:47.450 --> 01:20:47.460 align:start position:0%
into into that
 
01:20:47.460 --> 01:20:49.970 align:start position:0%
into into that
um

01:20:49.970 --> 01:20:49.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:55.189 --> 01:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
yeah Romans 6 in on page 36 into that
 
01:20:58.610 --> 01:20:58.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:58.620 --> 01:21:03.130 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:21:03.130 --> 01:21:03.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:07.550 --> 01:21:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:11.030 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:21:11.030 --> 01:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:13.310 --> 01:21:13.320 align:start position:0%
I don't know that it would belong there
 
01:21:16.430 --> 01:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
it seems as though that would belong in
 
01:21:18.410 --> 01:21:18.420 align:start position:0%
whatever part of
 
01:21:20.390 --> 01:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
of um
 
01:21:25.250 --> 01:21:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:29.149 --> 01:21:29.159 align:start position:0%
I yes it could it would have to be at
 
01:21:30.890 --> 01:21:30.900 align:start position:0%
least in both but some of the language
 
01:21:32.450 --> 01:21:32.460 align:start position:0%
from that
 
01:21:34.790 --> 01:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
where where it talks about when the
 
01:21:36.649 --> 01:21:36.659 align:start position:0%
legislator or any person living in the
 
01:21:38.330 --> 01:21:38.340 align:start position:0%
household with the legislator are
 
01:21:40.270 --> 01:21:40.280 align:start position:0%
financially dependent on the legislator
 
01:21:46.270 --> 01:21:46.280 align:start position:0%
that's that language needs to come from
 
01:21:50.630 --> 01:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
Roman six I got you now I got you yeah
 
01:21:53.750 --> 01:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
I just can't do the quick cut and paste
 
01:21:55.250 --> 01:21:55.260 align:start position:0%
in my head
 
01:21:58.370 --> 01:21:58.380 align:start position:0%
but everybody sees what I'm proposing
 
01:21:58.380 --> 01:21:59.330 align:start position:0%
but everybody sees what I'm proposing
and

01:21:59.330 --> 01:21:59.340 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:22:01.250 --> 01:22:01.260 align:start position:0%
hasn't okay
 
01:22:01.260 --> 01:22:02.570 align:start position:0%
hasn't okay
yeah

01:22:02.570 --> 01:22:02.580 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:22:04.669 --> 01:22:04.679 align:start position:0%
um and then there would be somewhere
 
01:22:04.679 --> 01:22:06.110 align:start position:0%
um and then there would be somewhere
that

01:22:06.110 --> 01:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:22:09.410 --> 01:22:09.420 align:start position:0%
um the definition so so for for the
 
01:22:11.630 --> 01:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
purpose of construction pretty much the
 
01:22:14.390 --> 01:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
first page is all set
 
01:22:16.250 --> 01:22:16.260 align:start position:0%
I think so until we get to the back I
 
01:22:19.850 --> 01:22:19.860 align:start position:0%
think so as long now we still I haven't
 
01:22:24.590 --> 01:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
heard any conflict or or objection to
 
01:22:29.209 --> 01:22:29.219 align:start position:0%
the idea of having recusal be
 
01:22:29.219 --> 01:22:30.890 align:start position:0%
the idea of having recusal be
um

01:22:30.890 --> 01:22:30.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:33.410 --> 01:22:33.420 align:start position:0%
when there is that conflict but still
 
01:22:36.590 --> 01:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
having the verbal disclosure when we're
 
01:22:40.010 --> 01:22:40.020 align:start position:0%
dealing with testimony and
 
01:22:40.020 --> 01:22:41.930 align:start position:0%
dealing with testimony and
um

01:22:41.930 --> 01:22:41.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:44.209 --> 01:22:44.219 align:start position:0%
testimony and debate
 
01:22:46.189 --> 01:22:46.199 align:start position:0%
um which is
 
01:22:48.530 --> 01:22:48.540 align:start position:0%
what's the number on that
 
01:22:50.930 --> 01:22:50.940 align:start position:0%
I seem to have now two pages of this
 
01:22:54.470 --> 01:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
disclosure being page two line three
 
01:22:59.510 --> 01:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:00.950 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:23:00.950 --> 01:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:04.610 --> 01:23:04.620 align:start position:0%
page two line three right so there's the
 
01:23:07.070 --> 01:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
verbally disclose
 
01:23:08.810 --> 01:23:08.820 align:start position:0%
on the record for participating in
 
01:23:10.490 --> 01:23:10.500 align:start position:0%
testimony in committee and debate on the
 
01:23:10.500 --> 01:23:11.930 align:start position:0%
testimony in committee and debate on the
floor

01:23:11.930 --> 01:23:11.940 align:start position:0%
floor
 
01:23:15.490 --> 01:23:15.500 align:start position:0%
when there is a conflict and and
 
01:23:22.970 --> 01:23:22.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:25.850 --> 01:23:25.860 align:start position:0%
when this conflict during any official
 
01:23:28.970 --> 01:23:28.980 align:start position:0%
legislative activity blah blah blah so
 
01:23:32.270 --> 01:23:32.280 align:start position:0%
recusal for voting but they can still
 
01:23:35.149 --> 01:23:35.159 align:start position:0%
you need the microphone to speak so it's
 
01:23:37.669 --> 01:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
recusal for voting but they can still
 
01:23:40.610 --> 01:23:40.620 align:start position:0%
speak right and that was in an effort as
 
01:23:43.370 --> 01:23:43.380 align:start position:0%
I think I said earlier to make sure that
 
01:23:46.130 --> 01:23:46.140 align:start position:0%
we still are able to represent our
 
01:23:46.140 --> 01:23:47.510 align:start position:0%
we still are able to represent our
constituents

01:23:47.510 --> 01:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
01:23:51.350 --> 01:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
but just not vote you still can Advocate
 
01:23:52.970 --> 01:23:52.980 align:start position:0%
you still can do all of those same
 
01:23:52.980 --> 01:23:54.470 align:start position:0%
you still can do all of those same
things

01:23:54.470 --> 01:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:23:56.810 --> 01:23:56.820 align:start position:0%
I've got a puzzle look on the face of
 
01:23:59.330 --> 01:23:59.340 align:start position:0%
the clerk again here
 
01:24:02.209 --> 01:24:02.219 align:start position:0%
maybe from a practical standpoint this
 
01:24:04.010 --> 01:24:04.020 align:start position:0%
may not be the the right time we can
 
01:24:05.630 --> 01:24:05.640 align:start position:0%
come back to it but
 
01:24:09.229 --> 01:24:09.239 align:start position:0%
um the exclusions to recusal and stuff
 
01:24:11.390 --> 01:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
in committee and just pulling from my
 
01:24:14.630 --> 01:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
experience on Commerce I'm not sure how
 
01:24:16.250 --> 01:24:16.260 align:start position:0%
would I know
 
01:24:17.870 --> 01:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
if there's going to be a problem with
 
01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:19.250 align:start position:0%
if there's going to be a problem with
quorum

01:24:19.250 --> 01:24:19.260 align:start position:0%
quorum
 
01:24:22.189 --> 01:24:22.199 align:start position:0%
uh I I think we were moving removing
 
01:24:24.169 --> 01:24:24.179 align:start position:0%
that sentence Oh okay we haven't even
 
01:24:26.030 --> 01:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
discussed that part of this yet we're
 
01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:27.290 align:start position:0%
discussed that part of this yet we're
yeah

01:24:27.290 --> 01:24:27.300 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:24:31.430 --> 01:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
taking it line by line right pretty much
 
01:24:33.830 --> 01:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
we'll we will
 
01:24:37.669 --> 01:24:37.679 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh just just for clarity
 
01:24:37.679 --> 01:24:38.510 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh just just for clarity
um

01:24:38.510 --> 01:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:40.970 --> 01:24:40.980 align:start position:0%
it has always been the practice that and
 
01:24:41.890 --> 01:24:41.900 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:24:46.610 --> 01:24:46.620 align:start position:0%
by operation that if you have declared
 
01:24:49.370 --> 01:24:49.380 align:start position:0%
the conflict you don't participate
 
01:24:52.729 --> 01:24:52.739 align:start position:0%
period that includes speaking on the
 
01:24:52.739 --> 01:24:53.930 align:start position:0%
period that includes speaking on the
bill

01:24:53.930 --> 01:24:53.940 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:24:56.390 --> 01:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
um include voting and voting so if
 
01:24:57.890 --> 01:24:57.900 align:start position:0%
you've declared a conflict you don't
 
01:25:00.530 --> 01:25:00.540 align:start position:0%
participate period you don't speak you
 
01:25:00.540 --> 01:25:01.310 align:start position:0%
participate period you don't speak you
don't

01:25:01.310 --> 01:25:01.320 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:03.229 align:start position:0%
don't
vote

01:25:03.229 --> 01:25:03.239 align:start position:0%
vote
 
01:25:08.090 --> 01:25:08.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:11.630 --> 01:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:18.590 --> 01:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
so how yep how do you get go ahead I'll
 
01:25:38.590 --> 01:25:38.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:44.390 --> 01:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:49.189 --> 01:25:49.199 align:start position:0%
our audience of two probably
 
01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
one being my 99 year old mother
 
01:25:57.050 --> 01:25:57.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:59.149 --> 01:25:59.159 align:start position:0%
I think chairman I know chairman
 
01:26:01.970 --> 01:26:01.980 align:start position:0%
Gordon's intention was yeah that the
 
01:26:03.649 --> 01:26:03.659 align:start position:0%
only change is to be made
 
01:26:05.810 --> 01:26:05.820 align:start position:0%
he humbly yes
 
01:26:08.090 --> 01:26:08.100 align:start position:0%
would be to
 
01:26:09.649 --> 01:26:09.659 align:start position:0%
do what's here
 
01:26:12.110 --> 01:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
I guess along with the exclusion
 
01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:13.070 align:start position:0%
I guess along with the exclusion
uh

01:26:13.070 --> 01:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:26:15.470 --> 01:26:15.480 align:start position:0%
provision you mentioned and changes to
 
01:26:19.189 --> 01:26:19.199 align:start position:0%
the effective date because this his
 
01:26:21.350 --> 01:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
proposal would leave in place everything
 
01:26:23.810 --> 01:26:23.820 align:start position:0%
else that's existed for the last 30
 
01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
years including special interests though
 
01:26:29.030 --> 01:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
including a whole other section of
 
01:26:32.629 --> 01:26:32.639 align:start position:0%
needless words as far as I can see
 
01:26:32.639 --> 01:26:34.030 align:start position:0%
needless words as far as I can see
true

01:26:34.030 --> 01:26:34.040 align:start position:0%
true
 
01:26:37.729 --> 01:26:37.739 align:start position:0%
but maybe his thought was just take
 
01:26:41.990 --> 01:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
things one step incrementally because
 
01:26:43.669 --> 01:26:43.679 align:start position:0%
changing the conflict of interest
 
01:26:45.890 --> 01:26:45.900 align:start position:0%
definition opens up a whole can of worms
 
01:26:47.990 --> 01:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of many other things
 
01:26:50.810 --> 01:26:50.820 align:start position:0%
including in in the guidelines the
 
01:26:52.790 --> 01:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
prohibited activity section which talks
 
01:26:53.810 --> 01:26:53.820 align:start position:0%
all about
 
01:26:56.270 --> 01:26:56.280 align:start position:0%
things you cannot do legislators cannot
 
01:27:00.050 --> 01:27:00.060 align:start position:0%
do if they have a conflict of interest
 
01:27:03.229 --> 01:27:03.239 align:start position:0%
that's one issue so so leaving the
 
01:27:04.910 --> 01:27:04.920 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest
 
01:27:08.750 --> 01:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
um and and tell tell us where that is
 
01:27:15.470 --> 01:27:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:18.350 --> 01:27:18.360 align:start position:0%
we got to get rid of these pages to find
 
01:27:20.510 --> 01:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
initially on
 
01:27:23.750 --> 01:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
page uh no 12 is the
 
01:27:26.689 --> 01:27:26.699 align:start position:0%
see now we still actually in here still
 
01:27:28.850 --> 01:27:28.860 align:start position:0%
have the verbal disclosure of conflicts
 
01:27:32.570 --> 01:27:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:35.629 --> 01:27:35.639 align:start position:0%
so we we have there's a difference
 
01:27:37.970 --> 01:27:37.980 align:start position:0%
between verbal disclosure of a conflict
 
01:27:40.550 --> 01:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
of interest versus
 
01:27:44.330 --> 01:27:44.340 align:start position:0%
a recusal so we still elect we allow
 
01:27:47.209 --> 01:27:47.219 align:start position:0%
when you fill out the form if you note
 
01:27:48.770 --> 01:27:48.780 align:start position:0%
what your
 
01:27:51.590 --> 01:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
what your interest is
 
01:27:53.689 --> 01:27:53.699 align:start position:0%
but you don't feel it's an interest
 
01:27:55.990 --> 01:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
enough where it would impact your the
 
01:27:58.310 --> 01:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
legislation and I think this is what
 
01:28:00.350 --> 01:28:00.360 align:start position:0%
what chairman Gordon was speaking to
 
01:28:02.750 --> 01:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
generally regarding the cola adjustment
 
01:28:05.209 --> 01:28:05.219 align:start position:0%
you know if if a hundred members had
 
01:28:08.270 --> 01:28:08.280 align:start position:0%
filed the form saying that we're going
 
01:28:11.149 --> 01:28:11.159 align:start position:0%
to get this however not any more than
 
01:28:14.629 --> 01:28:14.639 align:start position:0%
anybody else then that's acceptable uh
 
01:28:16.010 --> 01:28:16.020 align:start position:0%
because there is they can still
 
01:28:18.709 --> 01:28:18.719 align:start position:0%
participate but when you fill out this
 
01:28:20.629 --> 01:28:20.639 align:start position:0%
declaration of intent saying I will not
 
01:28:22.610 --> 01:28:22.620 align:start position:0%
participate that means the whole thing
 
01:28:24.830 --> 01:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
the whole gamut so that means when
 
01:28:26.510 --> 01:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
you're in committee you're not even
 
01:28:28.610 --> 01:28:28.620 align:start position:0%
gonna you're not even gonna
 
01:28:31.250 --> 01:28:31.260 align:start position:0%
participate at all but for example
 
01:28:33.530 --> 01:28:33.540 align:start position:0%
representative Sanborn for example is a
 
01:28:35.510 --> 01:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
business owner and as an operator of a
 
01:28:38.689 --> 01:28:38.699 align:start position:0%
casino when she testifies in front of
 
01:28:40.610 --> 01:28:40.620 align:start position:0%
Commerce or Ways and Means about those
 
01:28:43.430 --> 01:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
issues she verbally discloses her
 
01:28:47.209 --> 01:28:47.219 align:start position:0%
interests in that but she does not
 
01:28:49.310 --> 01:28:49.320 align:start position:0%
declare a conflict in the in the sense
 
01:28:51.470 --> 01:28:51.480 align:start position:0%
that she's not going to participate
 
01:28:54.590 --> 01:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
I understand and and
 
01:28:54.600 --> 01:28:55.189 align:start position:0%
I understand and and
um

01:28:55.189 --> 01:28:55.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:57.169 --> 01:28:57.179 align:start position:0%
personally that's the part I have a
 
01:28:58.310 --> 01:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
problem with
 
01:29:03.350 --> 01:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
um I um I think there are things that
 
01:29:04.910 --> 01:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
um verbally just and I believe that
 
01:29:06.530 --> 01:29:06.540 align:start position:0%
that's what the Ethics Committee is
 
01:29:09.410 --> 01:29:09.420 align:start position:0%
saying verb there are circumstances
 
01:29:12.530 --> 01:29:12.540 align:start position:0%
where verbal disclosure does not absolve
 
01:29:15.590 --> 01:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
you of your ability to
 
01:29:17.209 --> 01:29:17.219 align:start position:0%
do things
 
01:29:19.209 --> 01:29:19.219 align:start position:0%
um of a
 
01:29:23.090 --> 01:29:23.100 align:start position:0%
official Duty capacity and and that's
 
01:29:25.910 --> 01:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
why specifically when we were doing 301
 
01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:27.830 align:start position:0%
why specifically when we were doing 301
we

01:29:27.830 --> 01:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:29:27.840 --> 01:29:29.990 align:start position:0%
we
delineated

01:29:29.990 --> 01:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
delineated
 
01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:31.430 align:start position:0%
delineated
um

01:29:31.430 --> 01:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:35.750 --> 01:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
the the effort to be able to represent
 
01:29:38.510 --> 01:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
your constituents and and test and
 
01:29:41.330 --> 01:29:41.340 align:start position:0%
testify and debate
 
01:29:44.330 --> 01:29:44.340 align:start position:0%
but not vote and and made that
 
01:29:44.340 --> 01:29:45.770 align:start position:0%
but not vote and and made that
distinction

01:29:45.770 --> 01:29:45.780 align:start position:0%
distinction
 
01:29:49.189 --> 01:29:49.199 align:start position:0%
because in that
 
01:29:49.199 --> 01:29:49.850 align:start position:0%
because in that
um

01:29:49.850 --> 01:29:49.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:52.930 --> 01:29:52.940 align:start position:0%
opinion that I received
 
01:29:55.910 --> 01:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
I was told at that point that I could
 
01:29:59.450 --> 01:29:59.460 align:start position:0%
not do anything I could not talk with
 
01:30:02.330 --> 01:30:02.340 align:start position:0%
even other fellow legislators in the
 
01:30:05.149 --> 01:30:05.159 align:start position:0%
hall about that subject matter
 
01:30:09.290 --> 01:30:09.300 align:start position:0%
um so it to me that at that point I was
 
01:30:12.350 --> 01:30:12.360 align:start position:0%
not able to represent my constituents
 
01:30:14.350 --> 01:30:14.360 align:start position:0%
and I chose
 
01:30:17.510 --> 01:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
the different paths than than what I had
 
01:30:19.370 --> 01:30:19.380 align:start position:0%
asked for so
 
01:30:22.850 --> 01:30:22.860 align:start position:0%
it was important to me to represent my
 
01:30:25.610 --> 01:30:25.620 align:start position:0%
constituents and
 
01:30:28.189 --> 01:30:28.199 align:start position:0%
I thought that the way we drafted this
 
01:30:31.610 --> 01:30:31.620 align:start position:0%
to us still allow the the individual
 
01:30:35.330 --> 01:30:35.340 align:start position:0%
legislator to participate in everything
 
01:30:38.330 --> 01:30:38.340 align:start position:0%
except that vote was the best way of
 
01:30:41.209 --> 01:30:41.219 align:start position:0%
being able to satisfy my constituents
 
01:30:45.110 --> 01:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
and my need to not
 
01:30:45.120 --> 01:30:47.030 align:start position:0%
and my need to not
well

01:30:47.030 --> 01:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:30:49.129 --> 01:30:49.139 align:start position:0%
so so to that point Mr chairman I think
 
01:30:51.410 --> 01:30:51.420 align:start position:0%
that it that's going to require
 
01:30:54.410 --> 01:30:54.420 align:start position:0%
um because just as as for practical
 
01:30:56.810 --> 01:30:56.820 align:start position:0%
purposes we all know our level of
 
01:30:58.490 --> 01:30:58.500 align:start position:0%
Precedence in the New Hampshire house so
 
01:31:01.370 --> 01:31:01.380 align:start position:0%
it's the Constitution House Rules custom
 
01:31:03.590 --> 01:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
usage and precedent Mason's manual and
 
01:31:06.410 --> 01:31:06.420 align:start position:0%
then statute and because our rules and
 
01:31:09.649 --> 01:31:09.659 align:start position:0%
and our customs Trump statute we're
 
01:31:11.930 --> 01:31:11.940 align:start position:0%
going to need to change rules as well to
 
01:31:14.990 --> 01:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
accomplish what you're which is why I
 
01:31:17.390 --> 01:31:17.400 align:start position:0%
fully agree that what we need to do here
 
01:31:21.110 --> 01:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
is change that effective date to a time
 
01:31:23.169 --> 01:31:23.179 align:start position:0%
when we've already we're when we're
 
01:31:26.510 --> 01:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
re-establishing rules I would think
 
01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:27.530 align:start position:0%
re-establishing rules I would think
um

01:31:27.530 --> 01:31:27.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:29.330 --> 01:31:29.340 align:start position:0%
I don't know what does everyone think
 
01:31:31.189 --> 01:31:31.199 align:start position:0%
about the idea of
 
01:31:34.550 --> 01:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
um of separating the idea rather than
 
01:31:36.910 --> 01:31:36.920 align:start position:0%
just have a complete
 
01:31:40.490 --> 01:31:40.500 align:start position:0%
divorce of your ability to act as a
 
01:31:40.500 --> 01:31:42.050 align:start position:0%
divorce of your ability to act as a
legislator

01:31:42.050 --> 01:31:42.060 align:start position:0%
legislator
 
01:31:45.890 --> 01:31:45.900 align:start position:0%
um instead you would have the ability to
 
01:31:49.189 --> 01:31:49.199 align:start position:0%
um debate and and testify
 
01:31:52.610 --> 01:31:52.620 align:start position:0%
um but not vote yep
 
01:31:54.590 --> 01:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
testify yes
 
01:31:58.129 --> 01:31:58.139 align:start position:0%
because if you if you recuse
 
01:31:59.990 --> 01:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
and you're out of everything according
 
01:32:03.110 --> 01:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
to the way it's written now basically
 
01:32:03.120 --> 01:32:03.709 align:start position:0%
to the way it's written now basically
um

01:32:03.709 --> 01:32:03.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:05.870 --> 01:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
you still have the right
 
01:32:07.970 --> 01:32:07.980 align:start position:0%
as an individual
 
01:32:10.669 --> 01:32:10.679 align:start position:0%
which is all you have as a as an uh
 
01:32:12.770 --> 01:32:12.780 align:start position:0%
legislator anyway
 
01:32:15.169 --> 01:32:15.179 align:start position:0%
to testify
 
01:32:17.030 --> 01:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
but you could not then
 
01:32:19.310 --> 01:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
take part in the back and forth unless a
 
01:32:21.169 --> 01:32:21.179 align:start position:0%
question was directed like right now
 
01:32:22.850 --> 01:32:22.860 align:start position:0%
directing it to the clerk or something
 
01:32:24.050 --> 01:32:24.060 align:start position:0%
like that
 
01:32:26.209 --> 01:32:26.219 align:start position:0%
uh once you were done and there were no
 
01:32:29.149 --> 01:32:29.159 align:start position:0%
questions you'd go sit out there and you
 
01:32:31.070 --> 01:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be part of anything any longer
 
01:32:32.229 --> 01:32:32.239 align:start position:0%
how about yourself
 
01:32:34.729 --> 01:32:34.739 align:start position:0%
debating on the floor no because you
 
01:32:36.410 --> 01:32:36.420 align:start position:0%
have recused yourself
 
01:32:38.750 --> 01:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
you do not have an individual's right
 
01:32:42.709 --> 01:32:42.719 align:start position:0%
your mother 99 can't come in and debate
 
01:32:44.590 --> 01:32:44.600 align:start position:0%
on the phone oh yes she can
 
01:32:48.410 --> 01:32:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:51.229 --> 01:32:51.239 align:start position:0%
um so but the question for me then is
 
01:32:55.209 --> 01:32:55.219 align:start position:0%
are you fully
 
01:32:55.219 --> 01:32:56.810 align:start position:0%
are you fully
benefiting

01:32:56.810 --> 01:32:56.820 align:start position:0%
benefiting
 
01:32:59.629 --> 01:32:59.639 align:start position:0%
those that voted you into office yes
 
01:33:01.010 --> 01:33:01.020 align:start position:0%
because you're giving the same thing
 
01:33:02.930 --> 01:33:02.940 align:start position:0%
from that seat
 
01:33:06.050 --> 01:33:06.060 align:start position:0%
that you would espouse from one of the
 
01:33:07.790 --> 01:33:07.800 align:start position:0%
microphones up here
 
01:33:11.689 --> 01:33:11.699 align:start position:0%
you just get to do it once versus two
 
01:33:13.550 --> 01:33:13.560 align:start position:0%
three four five six seven times however
 
01:33:15.110 --> 01:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
long it takes
 
01:33:20.709 --> 01:33:20.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:26.090 --> 01:33:26.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:28.729 --> 01:33:28.739 align:start position:0%
as a
 
01:33:31.790 --> 01:33:31.800 align:start position:0%
as a citizen legislature which is what
 
01:33:34.970 --> 01:33:34.980 align:start position:0%
we seem to pride ourselves on
 
01:33:41.110 --> 01:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:44.149 --> 01:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
well-knowledged in certain areas
 
01:33:44.159 --> 01:33:46.850 align:start position:0%
well-knowledged in certain areas
and

01:33:46.850 --> 01:33:46.860 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:33:50.510 --> 01:33:50.520 align:start position:0%
I can see a problem I can see a problem
 
01:33:53.090 --> 01:33:53.100 align:start position:0%
where those people are needed
 
01:33:57.610 --> 01:33:57.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:01.010 --> 01:34:01.020 align:start position:0%
under what circumstance are you talking
 
01:34:03.890 --> 01:34:03.900 align:start position:0%
about not being able the current system
 
01:34:06.770 --> 01:34:06.780 align:start position:0%
well the current situation to me seems
 
01:34:08.390 --> 01:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
to work okay
 
01:34:11.270 --> 01:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
well so that's complete if you have a
 
01:34:13.250 --> 01:34:13.260 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest you are
 
01:34:15.169 --> 01:34:15.179 align:start position:0%
complete so you
 
01:34:17.870 --> 01:34:17.880 align:start position:0%
so you're you're looking at changing the
 
01:34:19.669 --> 01:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
definition of conflict of interest and
 
01:34:21.830 --> 01:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
one of the things that is not worded
 
01:34:24.770 --> 01:34:24.780 align:start position:0%
anywhere in here is a is a precedent
 
01:34:26.450 --> 01:34:26.460 align:start position:0%
that we've established
 
01:34:30.229 --> 01:34:30.239 align:start position:0%
and that is to add would be affected
 
01:34:33.229 --> 01:34:33.239 align:start position:0%
differently from other members of the
 
01:34:36.590 --> 01:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
class to which the legislator belongs
 
01:34:38.810 --> 01:34:38.820 align:start position:0%
that to me is a deal breaker in this
 
01:34:40.129 --> 01:34:40.139 align:start position:0%
entire endeavor
 
01:34:42.590 --> 01:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
because we have circumstances that are
 
01:34:45.649 --> 01:34:45.659 align:start position:0%
holistic that in the case I'll use her
 
01:34:48.410 --> 01:34:48.420 align:start position:0%
vet tech example
 
01:34:51.169 --> 01:34:51.179 align:start position:0%
where it applies to an industry versus
 
01:34:53.450 --> 01:34:53.460 align:start position:0%
this particular benefit of say the
 
01:34:55.910 --> 01:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
hospital merger example
 
01:34:59.149 --> 01:34:59.159 align:start position:0%
if we start taking away the ability to
 
01:35:00.709 --> 01:35:00.719 align:start position:0%
discuss things that that affect things
 
01:35:00.719 --> 01:35:02.510 align:start position:0%
discuss things that that affect things
globally

01:35:02.510 --> 01:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
globally
 
01:35:04.310 --> 01:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
we're doing a disservice to this
 
01:35:06.950 --> 01:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
legislature because in a lot of cases
 
01:35:08.870 --> 01:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
folks that happen to be extraordinarily
 
01:35:10.729 --> 01:35:10.739 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable in certain areas happen to
 
01:35:12.530 --> 01:35:12.540 align:start position:0%
be the ones that file legislation in
 
01:35:13.729 --> 01:35:13.739 align:start position:0%
those areas
 
01:35:16.370 --> 01:35:16.380 align:start position:0%
or that's why or they get someone else
 
01:35:19.970 --> 01:35:19.980 align:start position:0%
to do it but that's precisely why I am
 
01:35:22.550 --> 01:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
asking for their knowledge
 
01:35:25.550 --> 01:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
I'm just not giving it in the in these
 
01:35:28.550 --> 01:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
these bills that's pers that the citizen
 
01:35:32.209 --> 01:35:32.219 align:start position:0%
legislature is exactly where I am
 
01:35:34.250 --> 01:35:34.260 align:start position:0%
I'm saying however
 
01:35:36.530 --> 01:35:36.540 align:start position:0%
uh for all of those reasons in the
 
01:35:39.290 --> 01:35:39.300 align:start position:0%
findings here I think it's very
 
01:35:40.790 --> 01:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
important that we get their information
 
01:35:44.090 --> 01:35:44.100 align:start position:0%
which is why I'm I'm opening up their
 
01:35:47.570 --> 01:35:47.580 align:start position:0%
ability to verbally debate and testify
 
01:35:47.580 --> 01:35:49.010 align:start position:0%
ability to verbally debate and testify
and

01:35:49.010 --> 01:35:49.020 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:35:51.770 --> 01:35:51.780 align:start position:0%
um and suck that knowledge out of their
 
01:35:51.780 --> 01:35:52.729 align:start position:0%
um and suck that knowledge out of their
head

01:35:52.729 --> 01:35:52.739 align:start position:0%
head
 
01:35:54.770 --> 01:35:54.780 align:start position:0%
I'm only saying that if you are
 
01:35:54.780 --> 01:35:56.330 align:start position:0%
I'm only saying that if you are
benefiting

01:35:56.330 --> 01:35:56.340 align:start position:0%
benefiting
 
01:36:00.830 --> 01:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
from the vote then that's that I think
 
01:36:04.070 --> 01:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
is how where the definition where where
 
01:36:06.709 --> 01:36:06.719 align:start position:0%
our current situation falls apart I
 
01:36:09.229 --> 01:36:09.239 align:start position:0%
don't I don't buy the idea that because
 
01:36:11.930 --> 01:36:11.940 align:start position:0%
someone else is getting a vote getting a
 
01:36:15.830 --> 01:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
benefit you aren't it's it's how it
 
01:36:18.530 --> 01:36:18.540 align:start position:0%
affects you is the most important part
 
01:36:21.050 --> 01:36:21.060 align:start position:0%
you're the one with the vote
 
01:36:23.450 --> 01:36:23.460 align:start position:0%
um I don't care whether yeah but Jones
 
01:36:24.890 --> 01:36:24.900 align:start position:0%
is getting sure and that would be true
 
01:36:26.810 --> 01:36:26.820 align:start position:0%
for an individual a very specific
 
01:36:28.729 --> 01:36:28.739 align:start position:0%
benefit that you would receive due to
 
01:36:30.290 --> 01:36:30.300 align:start position:0%
the circumstances of that but if we
 
01:36:31.850 --> 01:36:31.860 align:start position:0%
start shutting everything down from a
 
01:36:34.129 --> 01:36:34.139 align:start position:0%
global standpoint every realtor that has
 
01:36:36.169 --> 01:36:36.179 align:start position:0%
ever served in this house can just wave
 
01:36:37.850 --> 01:36:37.860 align:start position:0%
goodbye because they'll never be able to
 
01:36:38.990 --> 01:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
come back
 
01:36:41.689 --> 01:36:41.699 align:start position:0%
so no yeah that's exactly it because
 
01:36:43.550 --> 01:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
especially in the case of Realtors
 
01:36:46.370 --> 01:36:46.380 align:start position:0%
there's I mean my first term here for
 
01:36:49.250 --> 01:36:49.260 align:start position:0%
some reason we just had a ton of real
 
01:36:50.570 --> 01:36:50.580 align:start position:0%
estate bills
 
01:36:50.580 --> 01:36:52.189 align:start position:0%
estate bills
and

01:36:52.189 --> 01:36:52.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:36:55.129 --> 01:36:55.139 align:start position:0%
but the arguments that I heard as a
 
01:36:57.290 --> 01:36:57.300 align:start position:0%
freshman rep was these are globally
 
01:36:59.030 --> 01:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
affected things they're not affecting
 
01:37:01.010 --> 01:37:01.020 align:start position:0%
certain realty companies or certain
 
01:37:03.110 --> 01:37:03.120 align:start position:0%
areas it's a it's an industry Global
 
01:37:06.250 --> 01:37:06.260 align:start position:0%
thing so so each one of those wouldn't
 
01:37:08.629 --> 01:37:08.639 align:start position:0%
except that but we're looking to change
 
01:37:10.490 --> 01:37:10.500 align:start position:0%
the definition here that's going to get
 
01:37:12.709 --> 01:37:12.719 align:start position:0%
rid of that it's hard to use it in a
 
01:37:14.450 --> 01:37:14.460 align:start position:0%
vacuum I I think
 
01:37:16.669 --> 01:37:16.679 align:start position:0%
I think you'd have to see each one of
 
01:37:18.830 --> 01:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
those individual bills and and whether
 
01:37:22.010 --> 01:37:22.020 align:start position:0%
it affected again we're we're dealing
 
01:37:24.590 --> 01:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
with 400 individuals with 400
 
01:37:27.110 --> 01:37:27.120 align:start position:0%
circumstances and it's awfully hard to
 
01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:28.610 align:start position:0%
circumstances and it's awfully hard to
say

01:37:28.610 --> 01:37:28.620 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:37:31.250 --> 01:37:31.260 align:start position:0%
um what each one should do which is why
 
01:37:33.530 --> 01:37:33.540 align:start position:0%
I think it's important that we give
 
01:37:36.890 --> 01:37:36.900 align:start position:0%
guidelines to the legislators so that
 
01:37:38.510 --> 01:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
they can make the decision for
 
01:37:40.129 --> 01:37:40.139 align:start position:0%
themselves I agree with the concept of
 
01:37:42.590 --> 01:37:42.600 align:start position:0%
having guidelines but when we're talking
 
01:37:44.390 --> 01:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
about changing definitions of conflict
 
01:37:46.310 --> 01:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
of interest and other things that is
 
01:37:48.290 --> 01:37:48.300 align:start position:0%
what the committee uses to make
 
01:37:50.930 --> 01:37:50.940 align:start position:0%
decisions based on why you're in front
 
01:37:53.270 --> 01:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
of the Ethics Committee
 
01:37:55.610 --> 01:37:55.620 align:start position:0%
so that those are two irrespective
 
01:37:58.129 --> 01:37:58.139 align:start position:0%
things a guideline is to help a
 
01:38:00.050 --> 01:38:00.060 align:start position:0%
legislator make a determination as to
 
01:38:02.629 --> 01:38:02.639 align:start position:0%
what they should personally do in
 
01:38:04.970 --> 01:38:04.980 align:start position:0%
changing what's in this book are
 
01:38:07.129 --> 01:38:07.139 align:start position:0%
irrespective of each other they are two
 
01:38:08.629 --> 01:38:08.639 align:start position:0%
different things
 
01:38:10.729 --> 01:38:10.739 align:start position:0%
and that's that's getting the loss we
 
01:38:13.550 --> 01:38:13.560 align:start position:0%
were talking about that the ethics has
 
01:38:16.550 --> 01:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
my goal is to not ever visit the Ethics
 
01:38:19.250 --> 01:38:19.260 align:start position:0%
Committee quite frankly
 
01:38:21.350 --> 01:38:21.360 align:start position:0%
um that that's what I think we should
 
01:38:23.750 --> 01:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
all have as a goal
 
01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:24.350 align:start position:0%
all have as a goal
um

01:38:24.350 --> 01:38:24.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:28.189 --> 01:38:28.199 align:start position:0%
or to be able to answer
 
01:38:30.709 --> 01:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
our actions for the Ethics Committee
 
01:38:33.590 --> 01:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
this is why I talk about the Safe Harbor
 
01:38:35.330 --> 01:38:35.340 align:start position:0%
that gives the ability for the
 
01:38:38.390 --> 01:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
legislator to say gee if this is a real
 
01:38:40.250 --> 01:38:40.260 align:start position:0%
what's the word the other word they use
 
01:38:43.250 --> 01:38:43.260 align:start position:0%
apparent a real or a parent financial
 
01:38:43.260 --> 01:38:44.770 align:start position:0%
apparent a real or a parent financial
interest

01:38:44.770 --> 01:38:44.780 align:start position:0%
interest
 
01:38:48.370 --> 01:38:48.380 align:start position:0%
that's what keeps you out of
 
01:38:50.570 --> 01:38:50.580 align:start position:0%
visiting our friends in the Ethics
 
01:38:50.580 --> 01:38:52.070 align:start position:0%
visiting our friends in the Ethics
Committee

01:38:52.070 --> 01:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
Committee
 
01:38:52.080 --> 01:38:52.970 align:start position:0%
Committee
um

01:38:52.970 --> 01:38:52.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:56.330 --> 01:38:56.340 align:start position:0%
but I don't want to lose our ability to
 
01:38:58.669 --> 01:38:58.679 align:start position:0%
gain knowledge from people that have
 
01:39:01.189 --> 01:39:01.199 align:start position:0%
specific knowledge in an area I think
 
01:39:03.110 --> 01:39:03.120 align:start position:0%
there there's definitely some there's
 
01:39:05.510 --> 01:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
definitely some areas that we that we
 
01:39:09.470 --> 01:39:09.480 align:start position:0%
can agree on here to deal with the lay
 
01:39:11.390 --> 01:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
issue if we'll call it that
 
01:39:13.910 --> 01:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
but I think going past that right now is
 
01:39:15.410 --> 01:39:15.420 align:start position:0%
just we're biting off too much at once
 
01:39:17.090 --> 01:39:17.100 align:start position:0%
okay we're biting off too much at once
 
01:39:19.370 --> 01:39:19.380 align:start position:0%
so fair point I might I might have
 
01:39:21.169 --> 01:39:21.179 align:start position:0%
gotten a little bit lost but but it
 
01:39:23.209 --> 01:39:23.219 align:start position:0%
helped me out um and I want to pull
 
01:39:24.649 --> 01:39:24.659 align:start position:0%
towards Lori and I know she wouldn't
 
01:39:27.590 --> 01:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
mind uh I I had a worked with Lori
 
01:39:30.830 --> 01:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
Sanborn a lot on Commerce
 
01:39:33.169 --> 01:39:33.179 align:start position:0%
um and in Commerce in general in
 
01:39:36.169 --> 01:39:36.179 align:start position:0%
subcommittees in work sessions and in
 
01:39:38.810 --> 01:39:38.820 align:start position:0%
executive sessions there were times
 
01:39:41.629 --> 01:39:41.639 align:start position:0%
where we would verbally disclose all
 
01:39:43.669 --> 01:39:43.679 align:start position:0%
this like at any time there was uh I
 
01:39:45.229 --> 01:39:45.239 align:start position:0%
used to live in a trailer park
 
01:39:47.330 --> 01:39:47.340 align:start position:0%
so anytime there was any Bill relating
 
01:39:49.370 --> 01:39:49.380 align:start position:0%
to that I would also by the way I live
 
01:39:50.689 --> 01:39:50.699 align:start position:0%
in trailer park but I'm participating
 
01:39:53.750 --> 01:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
you know what I mean uh Lori and a few
 
01:39:56.229 --> 01:39:56.239 align:start position:0%
others on the committee would have to
 
01:39:59.570 --> 01:39:59.580 align:start position:0%
verbally say I'm a business owner I mean
 
01:40:03.169 --> 01:40:03.179 align:start position:0%
15 times in a day at least so are you
 
01:40:05.330 --> 01:40:05.340 align:start position:0%
saying that we're gonna take
 
01:40:08.870 --> 01:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
the she can verbally she can either
 
01:40:12.890 --> 01:40:12.900 align:start position:0%
Advocate and participate and and but not
 
01:40:15.410 --> 01:40:15.420 align:start position:0%
be able to vote at all
 
01:40:18.110 --> 01:40:18.120 align:start position:0%
and if is is that what we're so we're
 
01:40:20.810 --> 01:40:20.820 align:start position:0%
taking page 13 we're taking that section
 
01:40:24.350 --> 01:40:24.360 align:start position:0%
seven verbal disclosure of where we just
 
01:40:27.550 --> 01:40:27.560 align:start position:0%
sort of announced verbally that you know
 
01:40:29.930 --> 01:40:29.940 align:start position:0%
Lori's Laurie owns a business but but
 
01:40:32.149 --> 01:40:32.159 align:start position:0%
she's going to participate in the in the
 
01:40:35.689 --> 01:40:35.699 align:start position:0%
committee work I think if Laurie my
 
01:40:37.010 --> 01:40:37.020 align:start position:0%
understanding I've never served on
 
01:40:41.270 --> 01:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
Commerce so I I I'm somewhat hampered by
 
01:40:43.610 --> 01:40:43.620 align:start position:0%
the issues that she's talking about when
 
01:40:46.129 --> 01:40:46.139 align:start position:0%
she verbally discloses my understanding
 
01:40:48.470 --> 01:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
is Laurie
 
01:40:51.590 --> 01:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
hers on the side that I'm talking that
 
01:40:55.010 --> 01:40:55.020 align:start position:0%
that she verbally discloses
 
01:40:57.770 --> 01:40:57.780 align:start position:0%
um all the time because we can still
 
01:40:59.930 --> 01:40:59.940 align:start position:0%
participate in the vote
 
01:41:02.090 --> 01:41:02.100 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry because we can still
 
01:41:03.770 --> 01:41:03.780 align:start position:0%
participate in the vote I'm saying all
 
01:41:06.950 --> 01:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
right are you saying if there's uh um
 
01:41:10.129 --> 01:41:10.139 align:start position:0%
any if there is a conflict I'm saying
 
01:41:10.139 --> 01:41:11.810 align:start position:0%
any if there is a conflict I'm saying
that

01:41:11.810 --> 01:41:11.820 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:41:14.390 --> 01:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
um that would cause
 
01:41:16.850 --> 01:41:16.860 align:start position:0%
a trigger of this conflict of interest
 
01:41:19.310 --> 01:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
definition that we have whether it's the
 
01:41:21.770 --> 01:41:21.780 align:start position:0%
existing one or not I'm saying that
 
01:41:25.610 --> 01:41:25.620 align:start position:0%
there should be two Avenues to take to
 
01:41:25.620 --> 01:41:26.770 align:start position:0%
there should be two Avenues to take to
either

01:41:26.770 --> 01:41:26.780 align:start position:0%
either
 
01:41:30.649 --> 01:41:30.659 align:start position:0%
disclose and participate
 
01:41:33.590 --> 01:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
at the testimony table land or in
 
01:41:36.590 --> 01:41:36.600 align:start position:0%
executive session but not vote
 
01:41:38.090 --> 01:41:38.100 align:start position:0%
yeah you're gonna
 
01:41:40.310 --> 01:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
um You're Gonna Lose quorum
 
01:41:42.290 --> 01:41:42.300 align:start position:0%
you're going to lose Quorum if that's
 
01:41:44.990 --> 01:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
the case and and that's and that well
 
01:41:48.590 --> 01:41:48.600 align:start position:0%
but right now if she has that quote if
 
01:41:50.330 --> 01:41:50.340 align:start position:0%
she has that conflict
 
01:41:52.810 --> 01:41:52.820 align:start position:0%
we're hearing from our clerk that that
 
01:41:56.510 --> 01:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
it's for everything and that apparently
 
01:41:58.729 --> 01:41:58.739 align:start position:0%
doesn't take place Mr chairman if I
 
01:42:00.649 --> 01:42:00.659 align:start position:0%
could I'd like to just read house rule
 
01:42:02.209 --> 01:42:02.219 align:start position:0%
106 to you
 
01:42:04.310 --> 01:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
um it says uh the approval of a majority
 
01:42:05.629 --> 01:42:05.639 align:start position:0%
of the Quorum president shall be
 
01:42:07.189 --> 01:42:07.199 align:start position:0%
required for a committee to decide a
 
01:42:08.930 --> 01:42:08.940 align:start position:0%
question or to take official action on
 
01:42:11.209 --> 01:42:11.219 align:start position:0%
any matter provided however that a
 
01:42:13.010 --> 01:42:13.020 align:start position:0%
member who has filed a declaration of
 
01:42:14.750 --> 01:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
intent pursuant to the ethics guidelines
 
01:42:16.609 --> 01:42:16.619 align:start position:0%
that the member will not participate
 
01:42:18.830 --> 01:42:18.840 align:start position:0%
shall not be required to vote and shall
 
01:42:21.050 --> 01:42:21.060 align:start position:0%
not be counted for the purposes of
 
01:42:23.470 --> 01:42:23.480 align:start position:0%
determining the number necessary for
 
01:42:25.850 --> 01:42:25.860 align:start position:0%
establishing important to act on that
 
01:42:28.729 --> 01:42:28.739 align:start position:0%
question so in that case
 
01:42:31.070 --> 01:42:31.080 align:start position:0%
um you know if if you have 20 people
 
01:42:34.310 --> 01:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
present your Quorum just drops by one so
 
01:42:37.729 --> 01:42:37.739 align:start position:0%
19 so you need 10 for a majority
 
01:42:37.739 --> 01:42:38.629 align:start position:0%
19 so you need 10 for a majority
position

01:42:38.629 --> 01:42:38.639 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:42:40.550 --> 01:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
and I noticed that length that same
 
01:42:42.709 --> 01:42:42.719 align:start position:0%
language in a number of states when we
 
01:42:44.090 --> 01:42:44.100 align:start position:0%
were looking at
 
01:42:47.689 --> 01:42:47.699 align:start position:0%
um what they do they didn't determine
 
01:42:50.570 --> 01:42:50.580 align:start position:0%
um for purposes of Quorum whether there
 
01:42:52.850 --> 01:42:52.860 align:start position:0%
was a conflict so that that takes care
 
01:42:54.770 --> 01:42:54.780 align:start position:0%
of the Corn part so if we lose five the
 
01:42:58.790 --> 01:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
Quorum drops right if we lose five yeah
 
01:43:01.910 --> 01:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
yes but if we get to a point where you
 
01:43:05.750 --> 01:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
have less than an actual Quorum you have
 
01:43:08.870 --> 01:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
a 20-person committee and and 10 people
 
01:43:11.810 --> 01:43:11.820 align:start position:0%
are not able to participate yeah I'm
 
01:43:14.030 --> 01:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
concerned so the the only thing with
 
01:43:15.890 --> 01:43:15.900 align:start position:0%
that was the reason why that should
 
01:43:19.189 --> 01:43:19.199 align:start position:0%
excuse me yeah that should happen now if
 
01:43:21.590 --> 01:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
if we're following
 
01:43:24.709 --> 01:43:24.719 align:start position:0%
the rule of everything but I think Mr
 
01:43:26.930 --> 01:43:26.940 align:start position:0%
chairman that
 
01:43:31.070 --> 01:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:33.770 --> 01:43:33.780 align:start position:0%
it's filing their conflicts and not
 
01:43:37.010 --> 01:43:37.020 align:start position:0%
participating and there's a again I go
 
01:43:38.990 --> 01:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
back to this difference between not
 
01:43:42.770 --> 01:43:42.780 align:start position:0%
participating versus disclosing
 
01:43:45.530 --> 01:43:45.540 align:start position:0%
um and still participate you know
 
01:43:47.629 --> 01:43:47.639 align:start position:0%
because there's nothing that prevents a
 
01:43:49.250 --> 01:43:49.260 align:start position:0%
member from participating as long as
 
01:43:50.810 --> 01:43:50.820 align:start position:0%
they're disclosing like I mentioned
 
01:43:53.810 --> 01:43:53.820 align:start position:0%
Judge Lynn the other day he he drafted
 
01:43:57.050 --> 01:43:57.060 align:start position:0%
the cacr for the purpose of benefiting
 
01:43:59.750 --> 01:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
the brand the judicial branch
 
01:44:02.149 --> 01:44:02.159 align:start position:0%
even though he's no longer a member of
 
01:44:04.070 --> 01:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
that branch and this wouldn't affect him
 
01:44:06.109 --> 01:44:06.119 align:start position:0%
he disclosed that he didn't have to but
 
01:44:08.330 --> 01:44:08.340 align:start position:0%
he did and I think that that is
 
01:44:10.490 --> 01:44:10.500 align:start position:0%
important for the discussion I would
 
01:44:12.649 --> 01:44:12.659 align:start position:0%
also not for nothing just sort of
 
01:44:15.530 --> 01:44:15.540 align:start position:0%
mention that there are 400 of you there
 
01:44:18.590 --> 01:44:18.600 align:start position:0%
are very very very very few members who
 
01:44:20.689 --> 01:44:20.699 align:start position:0%
are from single member districts
 
01:44:24.950 --> 01:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
and you having disclosed that you have a
 
01:44:26.930 --> 01:44:26.940 align:start position:0%
financial interest and are not
 
01:44:28.910 --> 01:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
participating on a bill doesn't mean
 
01:44:31.129 --> 01:44:31.139 align:start position:0%
that your constituents aren't
 
01:44:34.250 --> 01:44:34.260 align:start position:0%
necessarily represented good point
 
01:44:36.229 --> 01:44:36.239 align:start position:0%
there's just throwing that out there for
 
01:44:40.550 --> 01:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:42.470 --> 01:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
um does that help
 
01:44:44.870 --> 01:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
it helps on the corn part can I also
 
01:44:46.550 --> 01:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
just mention though
 
01:44:48.709 --> 01:44:48.719 align:start position:0%
just from the the Strategic standpoint
 
01:44:50.270 --> 01:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
of rules
 
01:44:53.870 --> 01:44:53.880 align:start position:0%
you you can't bind one legislature to
 
01:44:55.490 --> 01:44:55.500 align:start position:0%
the next so even if you all pass
 
01:44:57.350 --> 01:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
legislation that says you're going to do
 
01:44:59.930 --> 01:44:59.940 align:start position:0%
this and change the way that that our
 
01:45:02.689 --> 01:45:02.699 align:start position:0%
operations internally work it still is
 
01:45:04.970 --> 01:45:04.980 align:start position:0%
up inherent on the next legislature to
 
01:45:07.010 --> 01:45:07.020 align:start position:0%
make that adjustment to their rules and
 
01:45:09.470 --> 01:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
if they don't then the statute and the
 
01:45:13.490 --> 01:45:13.500 align:start position:0%
rules don't Jive and we have other
 
01:45:15.109 --> 01:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
issues to worry about
 
01:45:18.050 --> 01:45:18.060 align:start position:0%
which is somewhat the point with our
 
01:45:20.810 --> 01:45:20.820 align:start position:0%
other bill that
 
01:45:25.270 --> 01:45:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:28.729 --> 01:45:28.739 align:start position:0%
yes of course I cannot Advocate on any
 
01:45:30.229 --> 01:45:30.239 align:start position:0%
sort of policy issue I'm just trying to
 
01:45:32.570 --> 01:45:32.580 align:start position:0%
explain what I know is Chairman Gordon's
 
01:45:34.850 --> 01:45:34.860 align:start position:0%
intent with this piece which was said
 
01:45:34.860 --> 01:45:35.930 align:start position:0%
intent with this piece which was said
narrow

01:45:35.930 --> 01:45:35.940 align:start position:0%
narrow
 
01:45:39.109 --> 01:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
the times when members would be required
 
01:45:41.030 --> 01:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
three skews
 
01:45:43.910 --> 01:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
members could still voluntarily choose
 
01:45:45.410 --> 01:45:45.420 align:start position:0%
to recuse
 
01:45:48.470 --> 01:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
and members could also except for in
 
01:45:50.689 --> 01:45:50.699 align:start position:0%
these two circumstances described in
 
01:45:52.430 --> 01:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
paragraph one and two
 
01:45:55.129 --> 01:45:55.139 align:start position:0%
they could still in almost every case
 
01:45:57.530 --> 01:45:57.540 align:start position:0%
except for a few circumstances like
 
01:45:57.540 --> 01:45:58.850 align:start position:0%
except for a few circumstances like
these

01:45:58.850 --> 01:45:58.860 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:46:03.109 --> 01:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
I.E the Doug lay situation and frm
 
01:46:05.330 --> 01:46:05.340 align:start position:0%
they could still choose to disclose and
 
01:46:05.340 --> 01:46:06.590 align:start position:0%
they could still choose to disclose and
participate

01:46:06.590 --> 01:46:06.600 align:start position:0%
participate
 
01:46:09.169 --> 01:46:09.179 align:start position:0%
all that would stay in place all the
 
01:46:11.209 --> 01:46:11.219 align:start position:0%
definitions would stay in place it's
 
01:46:12.530 --> 01:46:12.540 align:start position:0%
just that
 
01:46:14.810 --> 01:46:14.820 align:start position:0%
in these circumstances you'd be required
 
01:46:19.609 --> 01:46:19.619 align:start position:0%
to be cues is it is it possible to get
 
01:46:22.669 --> 01:46:22.679 align:start position:0%
that special interest part out of this
 
01:46:22.679 --> 01:46:24.890 align:start position:0%
that special interest part out of this
sure

01:46:24.890 --> 01:46:24.900 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:46:26.990 --> 01:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
you could go back to
 
01:46:31.550 --> 01:46:31.560 align:start position:0%
it was before the study Commission 2014.
 
01:46:34.550 --> 01:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
and you could just have eliminate it and
 
01:46:37.330 --> 01:46:37.340 align:start position:0%
just Define financial interest in
 
01:46:43.310 --> 01:46:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:45.890 --> 01:46:45.900 align:start position:0%
that may be the easiest solution out of
 
01:46:45.900 --> 01:46:46.669 align:start position:0%
that may be the easiest solution out of
this

01:46:46.669 --> 01:46:46.679 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:46:49.250 --> 01:46:49.260 align:start position:0%
because it does open a can of worms
 
01:46:49.260 --> 01:46:50.510 align:start position:0%
because it does open a can of worms
to

01:46:50.510 --> 01:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:46:52.490 --> 01:46:52.500 align:start position:0%
change the definition of conflict of
 
01:46:53.750 --> 01:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
interest in terms of all the other
 
01:46:53.760 --> 01:46:55.550 align:start position:0%
interest in terms of all the other
provisions

01:46:55.550 --> 01:46:55.560 align:start position:0%
provisions
 
01:47:01.330 --> 01:47:01.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:05.870 --> 01:47:05.880 align:start position:0%
I I get the feeling however
 
01:47:07.850 --> 01:47:07.860 align:start position:0%
um because I've seen it in the past and
 
01:47:10.609 --> 01:47:10.619 align:start position:0%
we saw it from the original bill that
 
01:47:10.619 --> 01:47:13.370 align:start position:0%
we saw it from the original bill that
simply

01:47:13.370 --> 01:47:13.380 align:start position:0%
simply
 
01:47:16.310 --> 01:47:16.320 align:start position:0%
adding new words
 
01:47:20.209 --> 01:47:20.219 align:start position:0%
isn't getting us any closer to the idea
 
01:47:23.570 --> 01:47:23.580 align:start position:0%
that was originally espoused we still
 
01:47:26.629 --> 01:47:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:30.590 --> 01:47:30.600 align:start position:0%
shortness or or understanding of what's
 
01:47:33.770 --> 01:47:33.780 align:start position:0%
in this bill uh in this booklet it's
 
01:47:36.050 --> 01:47:36.060 align:start position:0%
sure it's merely almost a Band-Aid
 
01:47:38.450 --> 01:47:38.460 align:start position:0%
rather than a solution but that could be
 
01:47:41.290 --> 01:47:41.300 align:start position:0%
achieved through these decision tree
 
01:47:43.570 --> 01:47:43.580 align:start position:0%
Concepts and more
 
01:47:46.129 --> 01:47:46.139 align:start position:0%
education with continuing education
 
01:47:46.139 --> 01:47:47.149 align:start position:0%
education with continuing education
sessions

01:47:47.149 --> 01:47:47.159 align:start position:0%
sessions
 
01:47:49.550 --> 01:47:49.560 align:start position:0%
and maybe some other publication this
 
01:47:50.810 --> 01:47:50.820 align:start position:0%
this booklet
 
01:47:52.550 --> 01:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
I don't know what could come out of this
 
01:47:54.229 --> 01:47:54.239 align:start position:0%
it seems like there should be one
 
01:47:55.609 --> 01:47:55.619 align:start position:0%
booklet that has everything that relates
 
01:47:58.129 --> 01:47:58.139 align:start position:0%
to the ethics Provisions in it
 
01:48:00.410 --> 01:48:00.420 align:start position:0%
but maybe there should be another entity
 
01:48:01.850 --> 01:48:01.860 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
01:48:04.910 --> 01:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
informal and shorter
 
01:48:06.770 --> 01:48:06.780 align:start position:0%
um sort of like the decision decision
 
01:48:08.750 --> 01:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
tree that was mentioned
 
01:48:10.430 --> 01:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
because I don't know what would come out
 
01:48:12.590 --> 01:48:12.600 align:start position:0%
of this there are two statutes which
 
01:48:14.930 --> 01:48:14.940 align:start position:0%
affect ethics
 
01:48:17.270 --> 01:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
and then there's the guidelines and then
 
01:48:19.010 --> 01:48:19.020 align:start position:0%
there are the procedural rules I suppose
 
01:48:21.470 --> 01:48:21.480 align:start position:0%
could come out of this but members have
 
01:48:25.669 --> 01:48:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:28.729 --> 01:48:28.739 align:start position:0%
um this is kind of a wild suggestion I'm
 
01:48:31.149 --> 01:48:31.159 align:start position:0%
not sure how even I feel about it but um
 
01:48:33.830 --> 01:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
I know great introduction
 
01:48:35.649 --> 01:48:35.659 align:start position:0%
um if we're really concerned about the
 
01:48:38.510 --> 01:48:38.520 align:start position:0%
conflict between our house rules and the
 
01:48:40.310 --> 01:48:40.320 align:start position:0%
law would it just make more sense to get
 
01:48:42.290 --> 01:48:42.300 align:start position:0%
rid of
 
01:48:45.290 --> 01:48:45.300 align:start position:0%
the statute
 
01:48:46.550 --> 01:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
so we don't have all these weird
 
01:48:48.290 --> 01:48:48.300 align:start position:0%
definitions they just wouldn't exist
 
01:48:48.300 --> 01:48:49.370 align:start position:0%
definitions they just wouldn't exist
anymore

01:48:49.370 --> 01:48:49.380 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
01:48:50.689 --> 01:48:50.699 align:start position:0%
and then we would just do it all through
 
01:48:52.750 --> 01:48:52.760 align:start position:0%
rules if I can
 
01:48:56.149 --> 01:48:56.159 align:start position:0%
do are you intending to say that um we
 
01:48:58.550 --> 01:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
just follow the house rules then correct
 
01:48:58.560 --> 01:48:59.689 align:start position:0%
just follow the house rules then correct
yes

01:48:59.689 --> 01:48:59.699 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:49:03.950 --> 01:49:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:03.960 --> 01:49:05.090 align:start position:0%
 
yep

01:49:05.090 --> 01:49:05.100 align:start position:0%
yep
 
01:49:07.609 --> 01:49:07.619 align:start position:0%
um chair for the clerk if I may
 
01:49:10.430 --> 01:49:10.440 align:start position:0%
um and you say house rules it does take
 
01:49:13.490 --> 01:49:13.500 align:start position:0%
precedent over the statute in this case
 
01:49:17.570 --> 01:49:17.580 align:start position:0%
our house rules guide our actions in in
 
01:49:19.370 --> 01:49:19.380 align:start position:0%
our procedures
 
01:49:22.490 --> 01:49:22.500 align:start position:0%
um it is it is it is a higher order for
 
01:49:24.109 --> 01:49:24.119 align:start position:0%
for what we follow
 
01:49:24.119 --> 01:49:26.270 align:start position:0%
for what we follow
um

01:49:26.270 --> 01:49:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:28.550 --> 01:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
listen I I mean the fact of the matter
 
01:49:31.669 --> 01:49:31.679 align:start position:0%
is the the ethics statute gives the um
 
01:49:34.850 --> 01:49:34.860 align:start position:0%
was intended for you know sort of uh I
 
01:49:36.109 --> 01:49:36.119 align:start position:0%
don't want to use the word tribunal but
 
01:49:37.090 --> 01:49:37.100 align:start position:0%
a a
 
01:49:39.470 --> 01:49:39.480 align:start position:0%
non-branch specific
 
01:49:41.629 --> 01:49:41.639 align:start position:0%
um group to to weigh in and make
 
01:49:41.639 --> 01:49:43.010 align:start position:0%
um group to to weigh in and make
recommendations

01:49:43.010 --> 01:49:43.020 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
01:49:44.810 --> 01:49:44.820 align:start position:0%
um that being said
 
01:49:47.270 --> 01:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
you know there if there are
 
01:49:49.010 --> 01:49:49.020 align:start position:0%
if there are conflicts between the
 
01:49:51.050 --> 01:49:51.060 align:start position:0%
statute and the rules of the two bodies
 
01:49:55.370 --> 01:49:55.380 align:start position:0%
then you know the the rules Trump I
 
01:49:57.530 --> 01:49:57.540 align:start position:0%
would I would note too that the it is a
 
01:50:00.350 --> 01:50:00.360 align:start position:0%
requirement that when a new one of these
 
01:50:02.870 --> 01:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
gets published that it has to be adopted
 
01:50:05.750 --> 01:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
by both bodies
 
01:50:05.760 --> 01:50:06.890 align:start position:0%
by both bodies
um

01:50:06.890 --> 01:50:06.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:10.490 --> 01:50:10.500 align:start position:0%
before before it is inactive
 
01:50:13.550 --> 01:50:13.560 align:start position:0%
well but there are this is off topic but
 
01:50:16.629 --> 01:50:16.639 align:start position:0%
there are things in here that we're not
 
01:50:20.090 --> 01:50:20.100 align:start position:0%
adopted by both sure and in houses and
 
01:50:22.669 --> 01:50:22.679 align:start position:0%
and correct and and I I would I would
 
01:50:24.590 --> 01:50:24.600 align:start position:0%
note that that uh
 
01:50:28.430 --> 01:50:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:31.010 --> 01:50:31.020 align:start position:0%
I don't
 
01:50:34.189 --> 01:50:34.199 align:start position:0%
in 1819 uh in 2019 we celebrated the
 
01:50:36.470 --> 01:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
200th anniversary of the state s and I
 
01:50:38.750 --> 01:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
produced a document for all the members
 
01:50:41.330 --> 01:50:41.340 align:start position:0%
um and it was the 1819 rules and the
 
01:50:44.149 --> 01:50:44.159 align:start position:0%
2019 rules and the 1819 rules were five
 
01:50:47.209 --> 01:50:47.219 align:start position:0%
pages long and the 2019 rules were 27
 
01:50:47.219 --> 01:50:48.050 align:start position:0%
pages long and the 2019 rules were 27
pages

01:50:48.050 --> 01:50:48.060 align:start position:0%
pages
 
01:50:50.689 --> 01:50:50.699 align:start position:0%
so I mean things have changed a lot in
 
01:50:54.590 --> 01:50:54.600 align:start position:0%
200 years uh to get into uh to add a
 
01:50:57.050 --> 01:50:57.060 align:start position:0%
whole segment of rules
 
01:50:59.570 --> 01:50:59.580 align:start position:0%
um regarding disclosure and that sort of
 
01:51:02.270 --> 01:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
thing if if that's up to I mean that
 
01:51:03.709 --> 01:51:03.719 align:start position:0%
that would certainly be up to the body
 
01:51:06.830 --> 01:51:06.840 align:start position:0%
to do all right but you know having
 
01:51:09.649 --> 01:51:09.659 align:start position:0%
having the statute that that we look to
 
01:51:12.410 --> 01:51:12.420 align:start position:0%
and and has been through both bodies is
 
01:51:12.420 --> 01:51:14.629 align:start position:0%
and and has been through both bodies is
certainly

01:51:14.629 --> 01:51:14.639 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
01:51:16.910 --> 01:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
up to you
 
01:51:19.250 --> 01:51:19.260 align:start position:0%
comments anyone
 
01:51:19.260 --> 01:51:21.050 align:start position:0%
comments anyone
yes

01:51:21.050 --> 01:51:21.060 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:51:23.149 --> 01:51:23.159 align:start position:0%
I think the
 
01:51:23.159 --> 01:51:23.770 align:start position:0%
I think the
um

01:51:23.770 --> 01:51:23.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:26.450 --> 01:51:26.460 align:start position:0%
leaves a lot of open-ended uh
 
01:51:29.149 --> 01:51:29.159 align:start position:0%
interpretation by
 
01:51:31.390 --> 01:51:31.400 align:start position:0%
um in the sheen Amendment it says
 
01:51:36.050 --> 01:51:36.060 align:start position:0%
matters on the merits free I'm on uh HB
 
01:51:38.510 --> 01:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
301 Amendment
 
01:51:40.310 --> 01:51:40.320 align:start position:0%
um line nine
 
01:51:43.430 --> 01:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
matters on page one uh the first page
 
01:51:45.890 --> 01:51:45.900 align:start position:0%
matters on the matters on the merits
 
01:51:49.310 --> 01:51:49.320 align:start position:0%
free from conflicts of interest in both
 
01:51:53.270 --> 01:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
real and apparent proper improper
 
01:51:56.750 --> 01:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
influences but then you have the
 
01:52:00.830 --> 01:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
um Allison's Amendment
 
01:52:05.209 --> 01:52:05.219 align:start position:0%
on line five real or perceived Financial
 
01:52:07.729 --> 01:52:07.739 align:start position:0%
or otherwise I think the definitions
 
01:52:09.950 --> 01:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
need to be really tightened up because
 
01:52:13.850 --> 01:52:13.860 align:start position:0%
perceived by whom well it needs to be
 
01:52:16.129 --> 01:52:16.139 align:start position:0%
really tightened up of like is it a
 
01:52:18.229 --> 01:52:18.239 align:start position:0%
constituent is it an activist group is
 
01:52:20.149 --> 01:52:20.159 align:start position:0%
it another legislator that needs to be
 
01:52:23.689 --> 01:52:23.699 align:start position:0%
really finitely defined of
 
01:52:25.669 --> 01:52:25.679 align:start position:0%
who's making the complaint in on what
 
01:52:25.679 --> 01:52:27.470 align:start position:0%
who's making the complaint in on what
basis

01:52:27.470 --> 01:52:27.480 align:start position:0%
basis
 
01:52:29.209 --> 01:52:29.219 align:start position:0%
um and the language is going to be
 
01:52:33.050 --> 01:52:33.060 align:start position:0%
really important to Define when can an
 
01:52:35.570 --> 01:52:35.580 align:start position:0%
Ethics complaint be brought forward on
 
01:52:38.689 --> 01:52:38.699 align:start position:0%
what basis and anytime I know that but
 
01:52:41.530 --> 01:52:41.540 align:start position:0%
it will it will
 
01:52:44.830 --> 01:52:44.840 align:start position:0%
minimize the pool of people
 
01:52:48.229 --> 01:52:48.239 align:start position:0%
that could if the language is really
 
01:52:51.729 --> 01:52:51.739 align:start position:0%
tight and buttoned up on perceived is
 
01:52:55.310 --> 01:52:55.320 align:start position:0%
anything I'm driving two miles over the
 
01:52:57.290 --> 01:52:57.300 align:start position:0%
speed limit and they're gonna you know
 
01:53:00.050 --> 01:53:00.060 align:start position:0%
point that out but it's perceived it's
 
01:53:02.330 --> 01:53:02.340 align:start position:0%
not finitely defined well the Ethics
 
01:53:04.570 --> 01:53:04.580 align:start position:0%
Committee did mention that as well
 
01:53:07.490 --> 01:53:07.500 align:start position:0%
but the fact remains that it it does
 
01:53:09.590 --> 01:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
exist in our
 
01:53:12.850 --> 01:53:12.860 align:start position:0%
um this that that comes directly from
 
01:53:15.649 --> 01:53:15.659 align:start position:0%
those findings came from the original
 
01:53:18.669 --> 01:53:18.679 align:start position:0%
bill that we hung on to
 
01:53:23.450 --> 01:53:23.460 align:start position:0%
to study last summer so
 
01:53:23.460 --> 01:53:25.189 align:start position:0%
to study last summer so
um

01:53:25.189 --> 01:53:25.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:27.669 --> 01:53:27.679 align:start position:0%
you can find
 
01:53:30.770 --> 01:53:30.780 align:start position:0%
discrepancy or a dispute with the the
 
01:53:32.270 --> 01:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
findings but
 
01:53:32.280 --> 01:53:32.990 align:start position:0%
findings but
um

01:53:32.990 --> 01:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:36.770 --> 01:53:36.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:39.770 --> 01:53:39.780 align:start position:0%
oh and I I don't disagree with that yeah
 
01:53:41.510 --> 01:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
that has drawn from the existing
 
01:53:45.050 --> 01:53:45.060 align:start position:0%
guidelines principles of Public Service
 
01:53:47.570 --> 01:53:47.580 align:start position:0%
which has been in existence for the life
 
01:53:49.550 --> 01:53:49.560 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
01:53:52.070 --> 01:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
and it's findings I don't know
 
01:53:54.410 --> 01:53:54.420 align:start position:0%
that's very different
 
01:53:56.030 --> 01:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
statement of findings than the actual
 
01:53:56.040 --> 01:53:56.890 align:start position:0%
statement of findings than the actual
body

01:53:56.890 --> 01:53:56.900 align:start position:0%
body
 
01:53:59.330 --> 01:53:59.340 align:start position:0%
well if we're looking to do some
 
01:54:01.370 --> 01:54:01.380 align:start position:0%
amendments this is so we're changing
 
01:54:02.870 --> 01:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
something that's what the word Amendment
 
01:54:05.450 --> 01:54:05.460 align:start position:0%
means so that this is where I'm going
 
01:54:07.850 --> 01:54:07.860 align:start position:0%
with this if we're amending something
 
01:54:10.189 --> 01:54:10.199 align:start position:0%
you don't want to amend it to make it
 
01:54:10.199 --> 01:54:11.990 align:start position:0%
you don't want to amend it to make it
worse

01:54:11.990 --> 01:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
worse
 
01:54:13.910 --> 01:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
well you want to make it you know
 
01:54:16.189 --> 01:54:16.199 align:start position:0%
something that's a lot more just really
 
01:54:17.870 --> 01:54:17.880 align:start position:0%
defined that's why we're amending
 
01:54:19.250 --> 01:54:19.260 align:start position:0%
something because maybe there was some
 
01:54:21.530 --> 01:54:21.540 align:start position:0%
gray area before so we're gonna really
 
01:54:24.890 --> 01:54:24.900 align:start position:0%
you know dial it in at this point
 
01:54:29.510 --> 01:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
um just so here's we have a we have a 10
 
01:54:32.149 --> 01:54:32.159 align:start position:0%
minute deadline here um as far as I'm
 
01:54:34.790 --> 01:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
concerned I have to be out of here at
 
01:54:37.189 --> 01:54:37.199 align:start position:0%
noon but
 
01:54:40.729 --> 01:54:40.739 align:start position:0%
um I guess I would like to hear
 
01:54:44.390 --> 01:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:47.209 --> 01:54:47.219 align:start position:0%
um how we handle this bill
 
01:54:52.129 --> 01:54:52.139 align:start position:0%
and and I think this the options are
 
01:54:56.330 --> 01:54:56.340 align:start position:0%
um is there is there interest in
 
01:54:56.340 --> 01:54:57.649 align:start position:0%
um is there is there interest in
in

01:54:57.649 --> 01:54:57.659 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:54:57.659 --> 01:54:59.330 align:start position:0%
in
um

01:54:59.330 --> 01:54:59.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:02.450 --> 01:55:02.460 align:start position:0%
putting something forth in any of the
 
01:55:04.189 --> 01:55:04.199 align:start position:0%
fashions that we have in front of us
 
01:55:09.169 --> 01:55:09.179 align:start position:0%
either either the Gordon Amendment the
 
01:55:13.490 --> 01:55:13.500 align:start position:0%
Xi'an Amendment the existing 301
 
01:55:17.649 --> 01:55:17.659 align:start position:0%
um and or is there interest in
 
01:55:20.930 --> 01:55:20.940 align:start position:0%
retaining and playing with this over the
 
01:55:20.940 --> 01:55:21.950 align:start position:0%
retaining and playing with this over the
summer

01:55:21.950 --> 01:55:21.960 align:start position:0%
summer
 
01:55:26.629 --> 01:55:26.639 align:start position:0%
is there or is there interest in
 
01:55:28.669 --> 01:55:28.679 align:start position:0%
um any other options that anyone else
 
01:55:32.169 --> 01:55:32.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:35.689 --> 01:55:35.699 align:start position:0%
it's just my opinion but um that's all
 
01:55:38.149 --> 01:55:38.159 align:start position:0%
we have it's a representative I would
 
01:55:40.850 --> 01:55:40.860 align:start position:0%
rather move slower and get get it right
 
01:55:43.250 --> 01:55:43.260 align:start position:0%
and be a hundred percent comfortable
 
01:55:46.550 --> 01:55:46.560 align:start position:0%
then be a little bit hesitant and right
 
01:55:49.370 --> 01:55:49.380 align:start position:0%
now I'm a little bit hesitant I like the
 
01:55:51.590 --> 01:55:51.600 align:start position:0%
idea of what some of the things that
 
01:55:54.410 --> 01:55:54.420 align:start position:0%
we're talking about I'm just on if you
 
01:55:56.689 --> 01:55:56.699 align:start position:0%
ask me any piece any one of these I
 
01:56:00.290 --> 01:56:00.300 align:start position:0%
think it all needs work to to button up
 
01:56:02.570 --> 01:56:02.580 align:start position:0%
um so you know at this point I would say
 
01:56:04.910 --> 01:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
I figured be better to retain than to
 
01:56:06.649 --> 01:56:06.659 align:start position:0%
put something that
 
01:56:06.659 --> 01:56:07.250 align:start position:0%
put something that
um

01:56:07.250 --> 01:56:07.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:09.709 --> 01:56:09.719 align:start position:0%
can get you know a lot of holes punched
 
01:56:12.830 --> 01:56:12.840 align:start position:0%
into it or uh has the unintended
 
01:56:14.689 --> 01:56:14.699 align:start position:0%
consequence of being more confusing than
 
01:56:14.699 --> 01:56:20.410 align:start position:0%
consequence of being more confusing than
not

01:56:20.410 --> 01:56:20.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:22.970 --> 01:56:22.980 align:start position:0%
the Gordon amendment was what was
 
01:56:25.070 --> 01:56:25.080 align:start position:0%
suggested from the Ethics Committee no
 
01:56:28.910 --> 01:56:28.920 align:start position:0%
correct okay no um he was very careful
 
01:56:31.129 --> 01:56:31.139 align:start position:0%
in saying that this was not anything
 
01:56:33.649 --> 01:56:33.659 align:start position:0%
that he had discussed with the Ethics
 
01:56:36.109 --> 01:56:36.119 align:start position:0%
Committee except in an informal basis it
 
01:56:40.270 --> 01:56:40.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:43.970 --> 01:56:43.980 align:start position:0%
but he is also chair of the Ethics
 
01:56:45.830 --> 01:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
Committee so
 
01:56:48.350 --> 01:56:48.360 align:start position:0%
and then when we had met previously in a
 
01:56:49.669 --> 01:56:49.679 align:start position:0%
previous session
 
01:56:49.679 --> 01:56:50.510 align:start position:0%
previous session
um

01:56:50.510 --> 01:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:52.430 --> 01:56:52.440 align:start position:0%
I thought we had said or it had been
 
01:56:54.410 --> 01:56:54.420 align:start position:0%
said that when we met again we would
 
01:56:56.629 --> 01:56:56.639 align:start position:0%
have more insight from the meeting that
 
01:56:59.570 --> 01:56:59.580 align:start position:0%
yeah we did say that yeah what was that
 
01:57:03.709 --> 01:57:03.719 align:start position:0%
inside we'd have none oh okay a little
 
01:57:05.590 --> 01:57:05.600 align:start position:0%
bit we did a little bit
 
01:57:08.930 --> 01:57:08.940 align:start position:0%
they did they did make one statement and
 
01:57:10.310 --> 01:57:10.320 align:start position:0%
that was
 
01:57:11.930 --> 01:57:11.940 align:start position:0%
to go slow
 
01:57:13.729 --> 01:57:13.739 align:start position:0%
in little changes
 
01:57:15.770 --> 01:57:15.780 align:start position:0%
that's what I took from that from that
 
01:57:17.870 --> 01:57:17.880 align:start position:0%
because there was a lot of disagreement
 
01:57:19.970 --> 01:57:19.980 align:start position:0%
within there that was one of them of
 
01:57:22.370 --> 01:57:22.380 align:start position:0%
many things so and I think that's good
 
01:57:24.530 --> 01:57:24.540 align:start position:0%
advice okay
 
01:57:26.870 --> 01:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
any any other
 
01:57:28.850 --> 01:57:28.860 align:start position:0%
as someone that sits on the Ethics
 
01:57:31.010 --> 01:57:31.020 align:start position:0%
Committee that
 
01:57:32.870 --> 01:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
to keep moving forward but I'm looking
 
01:57:35.270 --> 01:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
at the clock yes I understand
 
01:57:44.570 --> 01:57:44.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:46.729 --> 01:57:46.739 align:start position:0%
I'd like to retain and work on it over
 
01:57:48.350 --> 01:57:48.360 align:start position:0%
the summer and then bring it back in the
 
01:57:48.360 --> 01:57:50.750 align:start position:0%
the summer and then bring it back in the
fall

01:57:50.750 --> 01:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:53.450 --> 01:57:53.460 align:start position:0%
we had I I will point out
 
01:57:57.229 --> 01:57:57.239 align:start position:0%
we had this opportunity Last Summer
 
01:58:00.649 --> 01:58:00.659 align:start position:0%
how many yeah both of us showed up right
 
01:58:00.659 --> 01:58:01.910 align:start position:0%
how many yeah both of us showed up right
um

01:58:01.910 --> 01:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:04.550 --> 01:58:04.560 align:start position:0%
and uh and so
 
01:58:06.589 --> 01:58:06.599 align:start position:0%
um I would only
 
01:58:09.470 --> 01:58:09.480 align:start position:0%
I would only suggest that uh that not
 
01:58:11.050 --> 01:58:11.060 align:start position:0%
happen again
 
01:58:13.910 --> 01:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
this is something that is important and
 
01:58:15.709 --> 01:58:15.719 align:start position:0%
it is important to do it correctly yeah
 
01:58:17.089 --> 01:58:17.099 align:start position:0%
representative Richard
 
01:58:19.970 --> 01:58:19.980 align:start position:0%
since it's also at the Ethics Committee
 
01:58:23.450 --> 01:58:23.460 align:start position:0%
is that a way to if it is retained by
 
01:58:25.010 --> 01:58:25.020 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
01:58:27.830 --> 01:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
would the Ethics Committee be also
 
01:58:30.229 --> 01:58:30.239 align:start position:0%
retaining it and working
 
01:58:33.109 --> 01:58:33.119 align:start position:0%
day so how do
 
01:58:35.990 --> 01:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
the two ever come together
 
01:58:38.270 --> 01:58:38.280 align:start position:0%
to do the work
 
01:58:41.330 --> 01:58:41.340 align:start position:0%
um not to my knowledge I don't think
 
01:58:45.169 --> 01:58:45.179 align:start position:0%
we've ever uh ethic well you can better
 
01:58:48.350 --> 01:58:48.360 align:start position:0%
answer but it would seem to me that I
 
01:58:50.770 --> 01:58:50.780 align:start position:0%
apologize for my naive no no no no no
 
01:58:54.350 --> 01:58:54.360 align:start position:0%
it's a fair question it Mr chairman they
 
01:58:56.570 --> 01:58:56.580 align:start position:0%
operate independently yes sir where I'll
 
01:58:58.850 --> 01:58:58.860 align:start position:0%
representative Richard's coming from uh
 
01:59:00.890 --> 01:59:00.900 align:start position:0%
the Ethics Committee has outside members
 
01:59:02.570 --> 01:59:02.580 align:start position:0%
and it's hard enough for us to schedule
 
01:59:05.209 --> 01:59:05.219 align:start position:0%
a regular meeting let alone try to get
 
01:59:06.950 --> 01:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
them to come into work during the summer
 
01:59:10.310 --> 01:59:10.320 align:start position:0%
so I think that would be very difficult
 
01:59:11.870 --> 01:59:11.880 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:59:11.880 --> 01:59:15.890 align:start position:0%
to do
yep

01:59:15.890 --> 01:59:15.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:17.450 --> 01:59:17.460 align:start position:0%
we good
 
01:59:21.589 --> 01:59:21.599 align:start position:0%
Jeff just yeah sure sure so if
 
01:59:25.430 --> 01:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
there was to be work done
 
01:59:27.530 --> 01:59:27.540 align:start position:0%
to make it better
 
01:59:29.330 --> 01:59:29.340 align:start position:0%
and hard work
 
01:59:29.340 --> 01:59:30.950 align:start position:0%
and hard work
done

01:59:30.950 --> 01:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:59:33.350 --> 01:59:33.360 align:start position:0%
that would have to happen within us
 
01:59:35.689 --> 01:59:35.699 align:start position:0%
retaining it here
 
01:59:38.870 --> 01:59:38.880 align:start position:0%
yes is that what that is fair to say
 
01:59:42.470 --> 01:59:42.480 align:start position:0%
fair to say it is if we were to retain
 
01:59:45.350 --> 01:59:45.360 align:start position:0%
it we would be retaining it with the
 
01:59:48.410 --> 01:59:48.420 align:start position:0%
expectation that that work would be done
 
01:59:51.109 --> 01:59:51.119 align:start position:0%
here by more than two people showing up
 
01:59:53.030 --> 01:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
in the summer
 
01:59:55.930 --> 01:59:55.940 align:start position:0%
um well yes yes
 
02:00:00.490 --> 02:00:00.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:03.290 --> 02:00:03.300 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman so yes next week is the
 
02:00:05.209 --> 02:00:05.219 align:start position:0%
reporting deadline but your today's your
 
02:00:07.430 --> 02:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
scheduled session day right
 
02:00:09.830 --> 02:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
um retaining means that it's held in
 
02:00:13.010 --> 02:00:13.020 align:start position:0%
this committee for action and it does
 
02:00:15.229 --> 02:00:15.239 align:start position:0%
give the committee chair a time to
 
02:00:18.410 --> 02:00:18.420 align:start position:0%
schedule meetings and for the record
 
02:00:20.570 --> 02:00:20.580 align:start position:0%
these would be work sessions and you
 
02:00:21.830 --> 02:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
could have full committee work sessions
 
02:00:23.209 --> 02:00:23.219 align:start position:0%
you have you could have subcommittee
 
02:00:25.070 --> 02:00:25.080 align:start position:0%
work sessions and you can invite any
 
02:00:27.649 --> 02:00:27.659 align:start position:0%
member of Ethics to participate uh
 
02:00:29.570 --> 02:00:29.580 align:start position:0%
certainly representative wall being a
 
02:00:32.149 --> 02:00:32.159 align:start position:0%
member of Ethics is you know well poised
 
02:00:34.669 --> 02:00:34.679 align:start position:0%
to do that chairman Lynn of Judiciary is
 
02:00:36.350 --> 02:00:36.360 align:start position:0%
the other uh appointee from the house
 
02:00:38.510 --> 02:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
he's he could certainly be invited to
 
02:00:38.520 --> 02:00:39.770 align:start position:0%
he's he could certainly be invited to
participate

02:00:39.770 --> 02:00:39.780 align:start position:0%
participate
 
02:00:41.750 --> 02:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
um there are opportunities and then
 
02:00:43.850 --> 02:00:43.860 align:start position:0%
later this fall
 
02:00:46.790 --> 02:00:46.800 align:start position:0%
um there would be the deadline to act by
 
02:00:48.350 --> 02:00:48.360 align:start position:0%
the full committee to recommend to the
 
02:00:49.970 --> 02:00:49.980 align:start position:0%
Full House and then we would take up
 
02:00:52.189 --> 02:00:52.199 align:start position:0%
that legislation in January
 
02:00:52.199 --> 02:00:53.510 align:start position:0%
that legislation in January
um

02:00:53.510 --> 02:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:53.520 --> 02:00:56.169 align:start position:0%
um
see

02:00:56.169 --> 02:00:56.179 align:start position:0%
see
 
02:01:00.649 --> 02:01:00.659 align:start position:0%
yeah and I I think we're so close too
 
02:01:02.750 --> 02:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
that's why I don't want to rush and vote
 
02:01:04.550 --> 02:01:04.560 align:start position:0%
on this because I think we're a lot
 
02:01:06.169 --> 02:01:06.179 align:start position:0%
farther than we were last year this
 
02:01:08.390 --> 02:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
summer and I think we're so close of
 
02:01:09.649 --> 02:01:09.659 align:start position:0%
getting it
 
02:01:11.629 --> 02:01:11.639 align:start position:0%
um to a point where I think it can be
 
02:01:14.990 --> 02:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
smarter people so you know why not take
 
02:01:17.089 --> 02:01:17.099 align:start position:0%
the summer and get a really good bill in
 
02:01:21.490 --> 02:01:21.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:21.500 --> 02:01:23.350 align:start position:0%
 
agreed

02:01:23.350 --> 02:01:23.360 align:start position:0%
agreed
 
02:01:25.850 --> 02:01:25.860 align:start position:0%
see work sessions are sometimes
 
02:01:25.860 --> 02:01:27.410 align:start position:0%
see work sessions are sometimes
beneficial

02:01:27.410 --> 02:01:27.420 align:start position:0%
beneficial
 
02:01:27.420 --> 02:01:28.729 align:start position:0%
beneficial
um

02:01:28.729 --> 02:01:28.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:31.250 --> 02:01:31.260 align:start position:0%
with that unless there's any other
 
02:01:33.589 --> 02:01:33.599 align:start position:0%
comment um we'll be back at one o'clock
 
02:01:38.450 --> 02:01:38.460 align:start position:0%
for exact Session 1 30 sorry
 
02:01:38.460 --> 02:01:39.310 align:start position:0%
for exact Session 1 30 sorry
um

02:01:39.310 --> 02:01:39.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:42.350 --> 02:01:42.360 align:start position:0%
and um and I'll close the work session
 
02:01:44.149 --> 02:01:44.159 align:start position:0%
the other the other part of the work
 
02:01:44.159 --> 02:01:45.290 align:start position:0%
the other the other part of the work
session

02:01:45.290 --> 02:01:45.300 align:start position:0%
session
 
02:01:45.300 --> 02:01:46.010 align:start position:0%
session
um

02:01:46.010 --> 02:01:46.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:49.370 --> 02:01:49.380 align:start position:0%
I think we will be talking about uh we
 
02:01:54.470 --> 02:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
had we had set aside for HB 157 as well
 
02:01:57.830 --> 02:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
um if if Mr Lambert can be back at uh 1
 
02:02:00.470 --> 02:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
30 and we'll we'll do that
 
02:02:02.870 --> 02:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
if you would prefer we can do that right
 
02:02:05.570 --> 02:02:05.580 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of it
 
02:02:08.510 --> 02:02:08.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I think
 
02:02:11.689 --> 02:02:11.699 align:start position:0%
my my hope is Chairman Gordon did ask me
 
02:02:13.850 --> 02:02:13.860 align:start position:0%
to convey on that that there is
 
02:02:16.430 --> 02:02:16.440 align:start position:0%
consensus on the Ethics Committee which
 
02:02:18.649 --> 02:02:18.659 align:start position:0%
is that they
 
02:02:20.870 --> 02:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
do not want to take a position policy
 
02:02:24.109 --> 02:02:24.119 align:start position:0%
wise on House Bill 157 in terms of
 
02:02:25.729 --> 02:02:25.739 align:start position:0%
whether the committee should have
 
02:02:28.010 --> 02:02:28.020 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over the policy of
 
02:02:28.020 --> 02:02:29.030 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over the policy of
harassment

02:02:29.030 --> 02:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
harassment
 
02:02:31.550 --> 02:02:31.560 align:start position:0%
that's an issue that they feel that
 
02:02:33.589 --> 02:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
should be made elsewhere okay in terms
 
02:02:35.510 --> 02:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
of leadership and
 
02:02:37.250 --> 02:02:37.260 align:start position:0%
that would be interesting
 
02:02:37.260 --> 02:02:39.709 align:start position:0%
that would be interesting
um

02:02:39.709 --> 02:02:39.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:43.490 --> 02:02:43.500 align:start position:0%
okay so that will take up 157 as part of
 
02:02:45.229 --> 02:02:45.239 align:start position:0%
the executive session
 
02:02:48.050 --> 02:02:48.060 align:start position:0%
um if if it's difficult
 
02:02:51.589 --> 02:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
that that would mean that um
 
02:02:53.450 --> 02:02:53.460 align:start position:0%
I don't think we would need you then for
 
02:02:55.669 --> 02:02:55.679 align:start position:0%
the exact session if that I don't want
 
02:02:57.609 --> 02:02:57.619 align:start position:0%
to take up your entire day
 
02:03:01.010 --> 02:03:01.020 align:start position:0%
but if you are here at 1 30 you will be
 
02:03:03.890 --> 02:03:03.900 align:start position:0%
welcome and if you are here we will take
 
02:03:06.950 --> 02:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
up 157 first if that helps you at all
 
02:03:06.960 --> 02:03:09.229 align:start position:0%
up 157 first if that helps you at all
301

02:03:09.229 --> 02:03:09.239 align:start position:0%
301
 
02:03:12.290 --> 02:03:12.300 align:start position:0%
301 we will take up as well
 
02:03:14.089 --> 02:03:14.099 align:start position:0%
one after another
 
02:03:14.099 --> 02:03:16.550 align:start position:0%
one after another
okay

02:03:16.550 --> 02:03:16.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:03:19.850 --> 02:03:19.860 align:start position:0%
great um thanks everybody uh I'll
 
02:03:23.149 --> 02:03:23.159 align:start position:0%
adjourn the work session on
 
03:39:29.210 --> 03:39:29.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:34.250 --> 03:39:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:44.750 --> 03:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:47.090 --> 03:39:47.100 align:start position:0%
now we're back
 
03:39:47.100 --> 03:39:47.929 align:start position:0%

03:40:05.389 --> 03:40:05.399 align:start position:0%

um moved by
 
03:40:21.229 --> 03:40:21.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:27.110 --> 03:40:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:29.690 --> 03:40:29.700 align:start position:0%
um would either of you like to speak to
 
03:40:37.450 --> 03:40:37.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:39.710 --> 03:40:39.720 align:start position:0%
representative Hobson would you like to
 
03:40:42.769 --> 03:40:42.779 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion sure uh here in New
 
03:40:44.990 --> 03:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have a
 
03:40:48.229 --> 03:40:48.239 align:start position:0%
very responsive uh elect election
 
03:40:50.570 --> 03:40:50.580 align:start position:0%
process I did not prepare anything as
 
03:40:52.910 --> 03:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
you can tell we have a very responsive
 
03:40:57.410 --> 03:40:57.420 align:start position:0%
election process and uh
 
03:40:59.990 --> 03:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh the turnover is is quite great the
 
03:41:03.650 --> 03:41:03.660 align:start position:0%
voters are very uh knowledgeable and it
 
03:41:07.190 --> 03:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
really is an incumbent upon them to vet
 
03:41:09.410 --> 03:41:09.420 align:start position:0%
out their candidates properly I think if
 
03:41:12.170 --> 03:41:12.180 align:start position:0%
if we were to have recalls every time
 
03:41:14.269 --> 03:41:14.279 align:start position:0%
someone's unhappy we would spend all of
 
03:41:18.110 --> 03:41:18.120 align:start position:0%
our time in the election mode so for
 
03:41:20.929 --> 03:41:20.939 align:start position:0%
that reason I think we should itl
 
03:41:26.690 --> 03:41:26.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:29.110 --> 03:41:29.120 align:start position:0%
we had testimony that this is enabling
 
03:41:32.330 --> 03:41:32.340 align:start position:0%
legislation it is enabling but for what
 
03:41:35.269 --> 03:41:35.279 align:start position:0%
purpose uh by the time we would form any
 
03:41:37.190 --> 03:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
kind of committee that could handle this
 
03:41:38.870 --> 03:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
it would take time and then the process
 
03:41:40.610 --> 03:41:40.620 align:start position:0%
would have to be developed and we'd have
 
03:41:42.050 --> 03:41:42.060 align:start position:0%
to go through it we've had a bill like
 
03:41:44.570 --> 03:41:44.580 align:start position:0%
this many times before and every time it
 
03:41:46.729 --> 03:41:46.739 align:start position:0%
has been killed mainly because of what
 
03:41:49.010 --> 03:41:49.020 align:start position:0%
representative Hobson said we have an
 
03:41:50.870 --> 03:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
election every two years
 
03:41:53.389 --> 03:41:53.399 align:start position:0%
and this kind of process could take far
 
03:41:56.269 --> 03:41:56.279 align:start position:0%
more than two years so there's a process
 
03:41:58.250 --> 03:41:58.260 align:start position:0%
we have for the general public deciding
 
03:41:59.510 --> 03:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
whether or not they want to keep someone
 
03:42:01.969 --> 03:42:01.979 align:start position:0%
in the office and it works so if it's
 
03:42:04.849 --> 03:42:04.859 align:start position:0%
not broken don't fix it thank you
 
03:42:10.910 --> 03:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:13.070 --> 03:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
I will say a couple of things one is
 
03:42:16.550 --> 03:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
we've had this bill at least
 
03:42:20.389 --> 03:42:20.399 align:start position:0%
13. this might be the 14th time that it
 
03:42:25.190 --> 03:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:30.830 --> 03:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
um as our as just 2018 if I total up the
 
03:42:34.250 --> 03:42:34.260 align:start position:0%
uh the yeas and nays uh
 
03:42:39.170 --> 03:42:39.180 align:start position:0%
35 45 to nothing is the total just in
 
03:42:42.710 --> 03:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
committee on on this bill
 
03:42:44.090 --> 03:42:44.100 align:start position:0%
um it is
 
03:42:47.809 --> 03:42:47.819 align:start position:0%
truly one of those bills that we we've
 
03:42:49.610 --> 03:42:49.620 align:start position:0%
been told that we have to pass it to
 
03:42:51.590 --> 03:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
find out what's in it
 
03:42:53.630 --> 03:42:53.640 align:start position:0%
um which should give us all pause
 
03:42:55.729 --> 03:42:55.739 align:start position:0%
especially when we're dealing with
 
03:42:58.010 --> 03:42:58.020 align:start position:0%
something as important as changing our
 
03:42:58.020 --> 03:42:59.889 align:start position:0%
something as important as changing our
constitution

03:42:59.889 --> 03:42:59.899 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
03:43:03.170 --> 03:43:03.180 align:start position:0%
the sponsor nor anyone else that
 
03:43:05.389 --> 03:43:05.399 align:start position:0%
testified gave us any idea of what's
 
03:43:08.809 --> 03:43:08.819 align:start position:0%
behind the curtain we have no idea what
 
03:43:11.389 --> 03:43:11.399 align:start position:0%
the cost would be or who is responsible
 
03:43:14.090 --> 03:43:14.100 align:start position:0%
for them we have no idea what elected
 
03:43:16.429 --> 03:43:16.439 align:start position:0%
officials would be included we have no
 
03:43:19.429 --> 03:43:19.439 align:start position:0%
idea how long the process would take to
 
03:43:21.710 --> 03:43:21.720 align:start position:0%
determine if it's even feasible from a
 
03:43:25.070 --> 03:43:25.080 align:start position:0%
practical standpoint of how long in that
 
03:43:27.710 --> 03:43:27.720 align:start position:0%
process we would be
 
03:43:30.769 --> 03:43:30.779 align:start position:0%
um the one thing that I also would like
 
03:43:34.429 --> 03:43:34.439 align:start position:0%
to point out is if you read the bill and
 
03:43:37.610 --> 03:43:37.620 align:start position:0%
and the language that's on page two that
 
03:43:41.870 --> 03:43:41.880 align:start position:0%
goes from line six to line 33 would be
 
03:43:43.849 --> 03:43:43.859 align:start position:0%
the wording of the question that's put
 
03:43:46.370 --> 03:43:46.380 align:start position:0%
to the qualified voter
 
03:43:46.380 --> 03:43:46.969 align:start position:0%
to the qualified voter
um

03:43:46.969 --> 03:43:46.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:50.510 --> 03:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
I counted it out 404 words
 
03:43:52.910 --> 03:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
um would have to be read by the person
 
03:43:55.910 --> 03:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
in the in the voting booth
 
03:43:57.590 --> 03:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
um and the question would just be are
 
03:44:00.229 --> 03:44:00.239 align:start position:0%
you in favor of amending article
 
03:44:01.910 --> 03:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
five of the second part of the
 
03:44:06.110 --> 03:44:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:08.630 --> 03:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
they would have to find this is like one
 
03:44:09.710 --> 03:44:09.720 align:start position:0%
of those
 
03:44:12.110 --> 03:44:12.120 align:start position:0%
um cartoon games or or
 
03:44:14.030 --> 03:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
travel games where you have two pictures
 
03:44:16.910 --> 03:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
and you have to determine which one is
 
03:44:19.429 --> 03:44:19.439 align:start position:0%
the is what changed in those two
 
03:44:21.290 --> 03:44:21.300 align:start position:0%
pictures except they only give you one
 
03:44:22.969 --> 03:44:22.979 align:start position:0%
picture and you have to try to figure
 
03:44:27.050 --> 03:44:27.060 align:start position:0%
out what's the thing that changes
 
03:44:29.690 --> 03:44:29.700 align:start position:0%
um and it turns out it's 22 words out of
 
03:44:33.290 --> 03:44:33.300 align:start position:0%
those 40 404 words that change and it's
 
03:44:35.090 --> 03:44:35.100 align:start position:0%
right in the middle so you have to
 
03:44:36.889 --> 03:44:36.899 align:start position:0%
question whether someone would actually
 
03:44:41.510 --> 03:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
read all 404 words to determine whether
 
03:44:44.150 --> 03:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
those 22 are different and whether they
 
03:44:46.130 --> 03:44:46.140 align:start position:0%
agree with them or not
 
03:44:46.140 --> 03:44:47.210 align:start position:0%
agree with them or not
so

03:44:47.210 --> 03:44:47.220 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:44:47.220 --> 03:44:48.170 align:start position:0%
so
um

03:44:48.170 --> 03:44:48.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:50.150 --> 03:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
and then you'd have to convince 60
 
03:44:52.849 --> 03:44:52.859 align:start position:0%
percent of the population to vote in
 
03:44:55.670 --> 03:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
your in your favor I think it's unlikely
 
03:44:57.290 --> 03:44:57.300 align:start position:0%
that this would pass and I think there's
 
03:44:59.870 --> 03:44:59.880 align:start position:0%
a reason why this has been before us 14
 
03:45:02.630 --> 03:45:02.640 align:start position:0%
times and failed oh 14 times
 
03:45:04.490 --> 03:45:04.500 align:start position:0%
so with that
 
03:45:04.500 --> 03:45:05.090 align:start position:0%
so with that
um

03:45:05.090 --> 03:45:05.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:45:09.950 --> 03:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
as my backdrop I if there's no other
 
03:45:13.610 --> 03:45:13.620 align:start position:0%
questions I will or discussion I will
 
03:45:17.809 --> 03:45:17.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:22.849 --> 03:45:22.859 align:start position:0%

do I have a motion you do
um

03:49:22.969 --> 03:49:22.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:27.469 --> 03:49:27.479 align:start position:0%
on cacr4 I'm sorry itl on cacr4
 
03:49:31.490 --> 03:49:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:31.500 --> 03:49:35.150 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:49:35.150 --> 03:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:39.010 --> 03:49:39.020 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak qmotion yes sir
 
03:49:43.190 --> 03:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
cacr4 covered the annual salary
 
03:49:47.510 --> 03:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
increase of the legislature
 
03:49:50.750 --> 03:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
in testimony we heard that
 
03:49:53.990 --> 03:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
the last time this was done was in 1889
 
03:49:56.809 --> 03:49:56.819 align:start position:0%
there was lengthy discussion as to what
 
03:49:58.550 --> 03:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
other states do
 
03:50:01.429 --> 03:50:01.439 align:start position:0%
and also what the realization of the
 
03:50:03.590 --> 03:50:03.600 align:start position:0%
implementation of this particular piece
 
03:50:03.600 --> 03:50:04.250 align:start position:0%
implementation of this particular piece
of

03:50:04.250 --> 03:50:04.260 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:50:06.889 --> 03:50:06.899 align:start position:0%
legislation would mean
 
03:50:13.309 --> 03:50:13.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:16.550 --> 03:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
no biennium my my bad
 
03:50:21.349 --> 03:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:23.630 --> 03:50:23.640 align:start position:0%
one of the things that
 
03:50:25.550 --> 03:50:25.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire seems to Pride itself on
 
03:50:27.590 --> 03:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
and I suppose I do in a ways is the fact
 
03:50:30.650 --> 03:50:30.660 align:start position:0%
that we are a citizen legislature this
 
03:50:33.050 --> 03:50:33.060 align:start position:0%
particular legislation would not make us
 
03:50:35.630 --> 03:50:35.640 align:start position:0%
a professional legislature
 
03:50:37.969 --> 03:50:37.979 align:start position:0%
but it would make us not a citizen
 
03:50:40.969 --> 03:50:40.979 align:start position:0%
legislator legislature either it kind of
 
03:50:42.590 --> 03:50:42.600 align:start position:0%
put us in kind of a
 
03:50:44.990 --> 03:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
a place in the middle I suppose
 
03:50:45.000 --> 03:50:46.610 align:start position:0%
a place in the middle I suppose
so

03:50:46.610 --> 03:50:46.620 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:50:50.450 --> 03:50:50.460 align:start position:0%
with that being said and with the
 
03:50:52.429 --> 03:50:52.439 align:start position:0%
long-standing tradition of us operating
 
03:50:54.650 --> 03:50:54.660 align:start position:0%
the way that we do that
 
03:50:56.809 --> 03:50:56.819 align:start position:0%
that would seem to lend itself to the
 
03:50:58.790 --> 03:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
ital motion
 
03:51:01.190 --> 03:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
foreign thank you
 
03:51:01.200 --> 03:51:01.910 align:start position:0%
foreign thank you
um

03:51:01.910 --> 03:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:07.250 --> 03:51:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:08.990 --> 03:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
forgetting that
 
03:51:12.410 --> 03:51:12.420 align:start position:0%
port itl and my reason for doing this is
 
03:51:13.969 --> 03:51:13.979 align:start position:0%
because even though we've had this
 
03:51:16.429 --> 03:51:16.439 align:start position:0%
before a number of times and sometimes
 
03:51:17.809 --> 03:51:17.819 align:start position:0%
it takes a number of times to get
 
03:51:20.889 --> 03:51:20.899 align:start position:0%
something passed this hasn't improved
 
03:51:24.590 --> 03:51:24.600 align:start position:0%
there are legislators who are legitimate
 
03:51:26.809 --> 03:51:26.819 align:start position:0%
and wanting to be paid more and I truly
 
03:51:28.790 --> 03:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
respect that I wouldn't mind being paid
 
03:51:30.410 --> 03:51:30.420 align:start position:0%
more that's for sure
 
03:51:32.990 --> 03:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
but the point is I don't think we should
 
03:51:35.150 --> 03:51:35.160 align:start position:0%
be changing the Constitution at this
 
03:51:36.889 --> 03:51:36.899 align:start position:0%
time the Constitution's a sacred
 
03:51:39.050 --> 03:51:39.060 align:start position:0%
document in all the years that I worked
 
03:51:42.229 --> 03:51:42.239 align:start position:0%
in judiciary we treated it as a sacred
 
03:51:44.630 --> 03:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
document you don't change it unless
 
03:51:47.090 --> 03:51:47.100 align:start position:0%
there's a real public need and reason
 
03:51:49.010 --> 03:51:49.020 align:start position:0%
for it we have members of the
 
03:51:51.170 --> 03:51:51.180 align:start position:0%
legislature who do want to change it
 
03:51:53.690 --> 03:51:53.700 align:start position:0%
this isn't going to if it gets through
 
03:51:55.250 --> 03:51:55.260 align:start position:0%
the committee it won't get through the
 
03:51:56.570 --> 03:51:56.580 align:start position:0%
house and if it does get through the
 
03:51:58.250 --> 03:51:58.260 align:start position:0%
house it definitely won't go through the
 
03:51:58.260 --> 03:51:59.510 align:start position:0%
house it definitely won't go through the
Senate

03:51:59.510 --> 03:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
03:52:02.929 --> 03:52:02.939 align:start position:0%
um yes folk maybe a feel-good type of
 
03:52:05.389 --> 03:52:05.399 align:start position:0%
vote and I respect that but at the same
 
03:52:05.399 --> 03:52:06.889 align:start position:0%
vote and I respect that but at the same
time

03:52:06.889 --> 03:52:06.899 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:52:08.690 --> 03:52:08.700 align:start position:0%
we're not going to get the general
 
03:52:10.849 --> 03:52:10.859 align:start position:0%
public to support us in wanting this the
 
03:52:14.630 --> 03:52:14.640 align:start position:0%
general public knows where our volunteer
 
03:52:16.969 --> 03:52:16.979 align:start position:0%
legislators and that we do this out of
 
03:52:18.830 --> 03:52:18.840 align:start position:0%
our own Good Will and yes it would be
 
03:52:21.710 --> 03:52:21.720 align:start position:0%
nice as I said to have more money
 
03:52:24.349 --> 03:52:24.359 align:start position:0%
but the cost to the state would be
 
03:52:27.170 --> 03:52:27.180 align:start position:0%
prohibitive from what I'm told and how
 
03:52:29.570 --> 03:52:29.580 align:start position:0%
do you pay legislators when we have a
 
03:52:30.889 --> 03:52:30.899 align:start position:0%
committee that doesn't have a lot of
 
03:52:33.290 --> 03:52:33.300 align:start position:0%
bills and we're not here very much how
 
03:52:34.729 --> 03:52:34.739 align:start position:0%
do you pay a committee like when I was
 
03:52:37.250 --> 03:52:37.260 align:start position:0%
on Judiciary and you have 73 bills
 
03:52:39.229 --> 03:52:39.239 align:start position:0%
and they're here so much more than we
 
03:52:42.650 --> 03:52:42.660 align:start position:0%
are how do you make that fair
 
03:52:45.530 --> 03:52:45.540 align:start position:0%
because if you pay just say forty
 
03:52:47.090 --> 03:52:47.100 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars or even ten thousand
 
03:52:47.100 --> 03:52:48.110 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars or even ten thousand
dollars

03:52:48.110 --> 03:52:48.120 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:52:49.610 --> 03:52:49.620 align:start position:0%
they're going to say to us you're
 
03:52:51.290 --> 03:52:51.300 align:start position:0%
getting an awful lot of money compared
 
03:52:53.090 --> 03:52:53.100 align:start position:0%
to the work we're doing that's not right
 
03:52:55.429 --> 03:52:55.439 align:start position:0%
so how do you differentiate between
 
03:52:57.710 --> 03:52:57.720 align:start position:0%
who's here for legitimate reasons a
 
03:52:59.990 --> 03:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
whole lot longer than other people are
 
03:53:01.849 --> 03:53:01.859 align:start position:0%
here you can't do it it doesn't work
 
03:53:03.110 --> 03:53:03.120 align:start position:0%
that way
 
03:53:06.110 --> 03:53:06.120 align:start position:0%
um it would be really really complex to
 
03:53:08.330 --> 03:53:08.340 align:start position:0%
do it if we're going to change how we're
 
03:53:11.269 --> 03:53:11.279 align:start position:0%
paid we should start with a real study
 
03:53:13.670 --> 03:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
committee find out what our real needs
 
03:53:16.130 --> 03:53:16.140 align:start position:0%
are what is a reasonable salary and then
 
03:53:17.809 --> 03:53:17.819 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to look at the size
 
03:53:19.670 --> 03:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
of the legislature how many people are
 
03:53:21.229 --> 03:53:21.239 align:start position:0%
we going to be paying
 
03:53:24.849 --> 03:53:24.859 align:start position:0%
and we have had bills before for
 
03:53:27.229 --> 03:53:27.239 align:start position:0%
diminishing the size of the legislature
 
03:53:29.450 --> 03:53:29.460 align:start position:0%
so we could increase pay but that has
 
03:53:31.370 --> 03:53:31.380 align:start position:0%
never gone into any serious study before
 
03:53:33.769 --> 03:53:33.779 align:start position:0%
we're not I don't believe you start at
 
03:53:35.269 --> 03:53:35.279 align:start position:0%
the top and say we want this and then
 
03:53:36.769 --> 03:53:36.779 align:start position:0%
figure out later on what you're going to
 
03:53:38.330 --> 03:53:38.340 align:start position:0%
do about it you first figure out what
 
03:53:39.469 --> 03:53:39.479 align:start position:0%
you're going to do
 
03:53:41.210 --> 03:53:41.220 align:start position:0%
and then when you have substantial
 
03:53:43.729 --> 03:53:43.739 align:start position:0%
evidence go for it so I can't support
 
03:53:46.790 --> 03:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:48.410 --> 03:53:48.420 align:start position:0%
thank you representative wall any
 
03:53:51.349 --> 03:53:51.359 align:start position:0%
further discussion represent payer
 
03:53:54.110 --> 03:53:54.120 align:start position:0%
hi I'm just going to speak against the
 
03:53:54.120 --> 03:53:55.190 align:start position:0%
hi I'm just going to speak against the
itl

03:53:55.190 --> 03:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
itl
 
03:53:56.630 --> 03:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
um because
 
03:53:58.490 --> 03:53:58.500 align:start position:0%
I like this bill because it was brought
 
03:54:01.090 --> 03:54:01.100 align:start position:0%
forward by bipartisan
 
03:54:03.290 --> 03:54:03.300 align:start position:0%
legislators and
 
03:54:05.210 --> 03:54:05.220 align:start position:0%
in my opinion it's a matter of matter of
 
03:54:07.010 --> 03:54:07.020 align:start position:0%
practicality I don't believe that in
 
03:54:09.769 --> 03:54:09.779 align:start position:0%
1889 the legislatures who voted for that
 
03:54:12.830 --> 03:54:12.840 align:start position:0%
200 they created that number based on
 
03:54:15.469 --> 03:54:15.479 align:start position:0%
that time the value in this bill is
 
03:54:17.450 --> 03:54:17.460 align:start position:0%
adjusted for inflation it's practical
 
03:54:20.510 --> 03:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
and even though yes we are volunteers so
 
03:54:22.610 --> 03:54:22.620 align:start position:0%
are Selectmen so our school board
 
03:54:25.790 --> 03:54:25.800 align:start position:0%
members so Arc sewer Commissioners and
 
03:54:28.309 --> 03:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
whatnot through all our municipalities
 
03:54:32.090 --> 03:54:32.100 align:start position:0%
and they get a stipend that is almost
 
03:54:34.130 --> 03:54:34.140 align:start position:0%
similar to what this would be per year
 
03:54:36.950 --> 03:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
so I think that it's practical I think
 
03:54:39.590 --> 03:54:39.600 align:start position:0%
it's reasonable and I think that a lot
 
03:54:42.050 --> 03:54:42.060 align:start position:0%
of folks could use that it to help them
 
03:54:43.969 --> 03:54:43.979 align:start position:0%
to free class to do this job because it
 
03:54:46.490 --> 03:54:46.500 align:start position:0%
really is a job and
 
03:54:47.750 --> 03:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
um folks that live up in the north
 
03:54:49.130 --> 03:54:49.140 align:start position:0%
country that need to come down for
 
03:54:51.110 --> 03:54:51.120 align:start position:0%
multiple committee days you know could
 
03:54:52.550 --> 03:54:52.560 align:start position:0%
help us
 
03:54:54.410 --> 03:54:54.420 align:start position:0%
offset the cost of staying in a hotel
 
03:54:57.229 --> 03:54:57.239 align:start position:0%
it's just practicality for
 
03:55:00.530 --> 03:55:00.540 align:start position:0%
um this job because it is a job and I
 
03:55:02.809 --> 03:55:02.819 align:start position:0%
think that having a stipend is
 
03:55:04.849 --> 03:55:04.859 align:start position:0%
appropriate given that all other elected
 
03:55:07.010 --> 03:55:07.020 align:start position:0%
positions in the state down to a school
 
03:55:09.769 --> 03:55:09.779 align:start position:0%
board member get a stipend two thousand
 
03:55:12.590 --> 03:55:12.600 align:start position:0%
three thousand per year Etc so
 
03:55:14.450 --> 03:55:14.460 align:start position:0%
um even executive counselors get a
 
03:55:17.210 --> 03:55:17.220 align:start position:0%
salary of 16 000 or something like that
 
03:55:20.510 --> 03:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
so I don't think it's absurd and so that
 
03:55:24.349 --> 03:55:24.359 align:start position:0%
is I'm going against the itl
 
03:55:26.929 --> 03:55:26.939 align:start position:0%
representative Tierney
 
03:55:29.870 --> 03:55:29.880 align:start position:0%
Mr correct a few items from the
 
03:55:29.880 --> 03:55:31.910 align:start position:0%
Mr correct a few items from the
microphone

03:55:31.910 --> 03:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
microphone
 
03:55:33.769 --> 03:55:33.779 align:start position:0%
I just thought I did
 
03:55:35.870 --> 03:55:35.880 align:start position:0%
I'm from the North country
 
03:55:38.150 --> 03:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
our school board members
 
03:55:40.429 --> 03:55:40.439 align:start position:0%
nine hundred dollars a year
 
03:55:42.769 --> 03:55:42.779 align:start position:0%
our Board of Selectmen twenty four
 
03:55:45.050 --> 03:55:45.060 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars a year
 
03:55:48.050 --> 03:55:48.060 align:start position:0%
there we are in session as the board of
 
03:55:50.030 --> 03:55:50.040 align:start position:0%
Selectmen and I'm one
 
03:55:54.229 --> 03:55:54.239 align:start position:0%
uh far more often than down here
 
03:55:58.070 --> 03:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
and it is far less money but it is still
 
03:55:58.080 --> 03:55:59.510 align:start position:0%
and it is far less money but it is still
done

03:55:59.510 --> 03:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
done
 
03:56:03.830 --> 03:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
for uh as a basically as a volunteer and
 
03:56:05.870 --> 03:56:05.880 align:start position:0%
that 2400
 
03:56:07.910 --> 03:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
four years ago was only twelve hundred
 
03:56:07.920 --> 03:56:09.050 align:start position:0%
four years ago was only twelve hundred
dollars

03:56:09.050 --> 03:56:09.060 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:56:11.349 --> 03:56:11.359 align:start position:0%
so we've gotten a small raise up there
 
03:56:16.250 --> 03:56:16.260 align:start position:0%
uh I am in favor of itl on this one
 
03:56:18.830 --> 03:56:18.840 align:start position:0%
as a matter of principle
 
03:56:22.550 --> 03:56:22.560 align:start position:0%
no legislature should ever be allowed to
 
03:56:24.530 --> 03:56:24.540 align:start position:0%
give itself a raise
 
03:56:24.540 --> 03:56:27.410 align:start position:0%
give itself a raise
none

03:56:27.410 --> 03:56:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:38.809 --> 03:56:38.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:41.710 --> 03:56:41.720 align:start position:0%
if we if we end up getting paid more
 
03:56:45.969 --> 03:56:45.979 align:start position:0%
sometime someday down around whenever
 
03:56:48.830 --> 03:56:48.840 align:start position:0%
it's going to change the character of
 
03:56:50.750 --> 03:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
the legislature we won't be volunteers
 
03:56:53.210 --> 03:56:53.220 align:start position:0%
anymore it's going to cost a lot more to
 
03:56:55.250 --> 03:56:55.260 align:start position:0%
get elected because more people will be
 
03:56:57.469 --> 03:56:57.479 align:start position:0%
wanting the job because it's easier to
 
03:57:00.650 --> 03:57:00.660 align:start position:0%
be here actually to get paid and I'm not
 
03:57:01.729 --> 03:57:01.739 align:start position:0%
saying they're doing it for the money
 
03:57:03.410 --> 03:57:03.420 align:start position:0%
Nobody Does it for that we do it because
 
03:57:05.570 --> 03:57:05.580 align:start position:0%
we love what we're doing as volunteers
 
03:57:07.490 --> 03:57:07.500 align:start position:0%
for citizens of New Hampshire
 
03:57:10.429 --> 03:57:10.439 align:start position:0%
but every testimony I've heard over the
 
03:57:12.290 --> 03:57:12.300 align:start position:0%
years on this particular bill has been
 
03:57:14.570 --> 03:57:14.580 align:start position:0%
it will change the character of this
 
03:57:16.550 --> 03:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
legislature many people will not be
 
03:57:16.560 --> 03:57:17.570 align:start position:0%
legislature many people will not be
coming

03:57:17.570 --> 03:57:17.580 align:start position:0%
coming
 
03:57:19.670 --> 03:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
because they can't afford to run for
 
03:57:21.410 --> 03:57:21.420 align:start position:0%
election unless they've got big
 
03:57:24.490 --> 03:57:24.500 align:start position:0%
donations coming from somewhere else
 
03:57:26.870 --> 03:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
so it will be a different character
 
03:57:28.610 --> 03:57:28.620 align:start position:0%
altogether I don't know what the law
 
03:57:30.830 --> 03:57:30.840 align:start position:0%
making will be then but it'll be more
 
03:57:33.410 --> 03:57:33.420 align:start position:0%
professional perhaps than it is now I
 
03:57:35.269 --> 03:57:35.279 align:start position:0%
will say that as legislators and as
 
03:57:37.969 --> 03:57:37.979 align:start position:0%
volunteers we can deduct our expenses on
 
03:57:40.809 --> 03:57:40.819 align:start position:0%
our taxes that helps offset some things
 
03:57:44.330 --> 03:57:44.340 align:start position:0%
but at the same time yeah and why don't
 
03:57:48.670 --> 03:57:48.680 align:start position:0%
you tell me now I tell you yeah I I just
 
03:57:51.530 --> 03:57:51.540 align:start position:0%
you know as a matter of principle I know
 
03:57:53.210 --> 03:57:53.220 align:start position:0%
you all want those of you who want the
 
03:57:55.790 --> 03:57:55.800 align:start position:0%
bill wants it and I respect that but I
 
03:57:58.370 --> 03:57:58.380 align:start position:0%
again I just can't do it because I just
 
03:58:00.950 --> 03:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
don't believe this is the right vehicle
 
03:58:04.250 --> 03:58:04.260 align:start position:0%
to use we won't change the Constitution
 
03:58:06.530 --> 03:58:06.540 align:start position:0%
at this time if anything study this
 
03:58:08.689 --> 03:58:08.699 align:start position:0%
figure out what you want figure out what
 
03:58:10.250 --> 03:58:10.260 align:start position:0%
the size of the legislature will be
 
03:58:11.630 --> 03:58:11.640 align:start position:0%
figure out how you're going to pay
 
03:58:13.370 --> 03:58:13.380 align:start position:0%
people differently at different levels
 
03:58:15.290 --> 03:58:15.300 align:start position:0%
and then go from there and I was
 
03:58:17.929 --> 03:58:17.939 align:start position:0%
actually looking up something for labor
 
03:58:20.809 --> 03:58:20.819 align:start position:0%
law last week and I was realizing that
 
03:58:22.849 --> 03:58:22.859 align:start position:0%
this may not only affect what happens to
 
03:58:24.889 --> 03:58:24.899 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but labor law May have to
 
03:58:25.969 --> 03:58:25.979 align:start position:0%
come into this from the federal
 
03:58:29.090 --> 03:58:29.100 align:start position:0%
government it's a complex issue thank
 
03:58:29.100 --> 03:58:30.110 align:start position:0%
government it's a complex issue thank
you

03:58:30.110 --> 03:58:30.120 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:58:32.210 --> 03:58:32.220 align:start position:0%
thank you representative wall any other
 
03:58:34.429 --> 03:58:34.439 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative yes I
 
03:58:36.050 --> 03:58:36.060 align:start position:0%
was just kind of wondering
 
03:58:38.030 --> 03:58:38.040 align:start position:0%
what would it deal with if you try to go
 
03:58:39.769 --> 03:58:39.779 align:start position:0%
for per diem
 
03:58:41.570 --> 03:58:41.580 align:start position:0%
so if you show up here you get a per
 
03:58:45.710 --> 03:58:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:45.720 --> 03:58:46.370 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:58:46.370 --> 03:58:46.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:48.769 --> 03:58:48.779 align:start position:0%
excellent question uh not covered by
 
03:58:54.349 --> 03:58:54.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:55.910 --> 03:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming you didn't want an answer
 
03:58:58.189 --> 03:58:58.199 align:start position:0%
you were just a rhetorical question
 
03:59:00.349 --> 03:59:00.359 align:start position:0%
right yeah
 
03:59:03.349 --> 03:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
uh representative Perez that I'm allowed
 
03:59:06.349 --> 03:59:06.359 align:start position:0%
to like give my opinion on it if you
 
03:59:10.429 --> 03:59:10.439 align:start position:0%
have one you can give it okay so I I
 
03:59:10.439 --> 03:59:11.389 align:start position:0%
have one you can give it okay so I I
will

03:59:11.389 --> 03:59:11.399 align:start position:0%
will
 
03:59:15.349 --> 03:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna speak against the ideal motion
 
03:59:17.990 --> 03:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
I would love to see more
 
03:59:21.110 --> 03:59:21.120 align:start position:0%
younger generation running for office I
 
03:59:23.929 --> 03:59:23.939 align:start position:0%
would love to pass
 
03:59:27.469 --> 03:59:27.479 align:start position:0%
my baton you know when I'm ready to not
 
03:59:29.689 --> 03:59:29.699 align:start position:0%
be I'm not saying you know I'm getting
 
03:59:33.229 --> 03:59:33.239 align:start position:0%
I'm not 80 but but I would love to see a
 
03:59:34.610 --> 03:59:34.620 align:start position:0%
new generation
 
03:59:38.090 --> 03:59:38.100 align:start position:0%
coming in and replace some of us here
 
03:59:41.030 --> 03:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
and I believe giving it two hundred
 
03:59:43.490 --> 03:59:43.500 align:start position:0%
dollars when we ask in new generations
 
03:59:46.729 --> 03:59:46.739 align:start position:0%
to run for office
 
03:59:48.830 --> 03:59:48.840 align:start position:0%
um is something that I don't think many
 
03:59:50.630 --> 03:59:50.640 align:start position:0%
of them can do especially if they're
 
03:59:52.490 --> 03:59:52.500 align:start position:0%
planning to have a family
 
03:59:54.769 --> 03:59:54.779 align:start position:0%
I you know I want to see new generation
 
03:59:57.410 --> 03:59:57.420 align:start position:0%
new ideas come in here but I don't want
 
04:00:00.769 --> 04:00:00.779 align:start position:0%
to take away you know their right to to
 
04:00:03.469 --> 04:00:03.479 align:start position:0%
have a family to you know to have a
 
04:00:05.750 --> 04:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
house or or build something for the
 
04:00:08.030 --> 04:00:08.040 align:start position:0%
future and two hundred dollars it
 
04:00:11.450 --> 04:00:11.460 align:start position:0%
doesn't cut up trust me I you know it's
 
04:00:13.670 --> 04:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
hard for someone who wants to be a
 
04:00:13.680 --> 04:00:15.349 align:start position:0%
hard for someone who wants to be a
legislator

04:00:15.349 --> 04:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
legislator
 
04:00:18.590 --> 04:00:18.600 align:start position:0%
and then has to work 52 hours a week and
 
04:00:20.570 --> 04:00:20.580 align:start position:0%
that's what I need to do in order for me
 
04:00:23.750 --> 04:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
to stay be a stair rep I have to work 52
 
04:00:24.950 --> 04:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
hours a week
 
04:00:27.290 --> 04:00:27.300 align:start position:0%
and then that has to be a legislator I'm
 
04:00:29.689 --> 04:00:29.699 align:start position:0%
not complaining but it's hard you know
 
04:00:31.610 --> 04:00:31.620 align:start position:0%
I'm grateful that you know my kids are
 
04:00:34.670 --> 04:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
30 and 27 but I'm just picture you know
 
04:00:37.189 --> 04:00:37.199 align:start position:0%
uh younger generation where you know
 
04:00:40.070 --> 04:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
they want to start building a family
 
04:00:42.650 --> 04:00:42.660 align:start position:0%
that doesn't cut off you know and and
 
04:00:45.590 --> 04:00:45.600 align:start position:0%
the time that we spending here in plus
 
04:00:48.469 --> 04:00:48.479 align:start position:0%
52 hours or 40 hours a full-time job
 
04:00:51.710 --> 04:00:51.720 align:start position:0%
words that live in us you know I'm I'm
 
04:00:53.630 --> 04:00:53.640 align:start position:0%
just saying you know I'm not I'm not
 
04:00:55.670 --> 04:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
saying you know everyone needs to get
 
04:00:58.370 --> 04:00:58.380 align:start position:0%
paid but for the ones that needs to get
 
04:01:00.950 --> 04:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
paid you know I wish you know we can
 
04:01:00.960 --> 04:01:01.729 align:start position:0%
paid you know I wish you know we can
like

04:01:01.729 --> 04:01:01.739 align:start position:0%
like
 
04:01:03.889 --> 04:01:03.899 align:start position:0%
think about how we can move this forward
 
04:01:06.610 --> 04:01:06.620 align:start position:0%
you know without
 
04:01:08.750 --> 04:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
compromise you know without taking away
 
04:01:10.729 --> 04:01:10.739 align:start position:0%
from the taxpayers but you know again
 
04:01:11.990 --> 04:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:01:13.729 --> 04:01:13.739 align:start position:0%
I would like to see more opportunities
 
04:01:20.269 --> 04:01:20.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:21.950 --> 04:01:21.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Perez
 
04:01:25.070 --> 04:01:25.080 align:start position:0%
representative Carter
 
04:01:27.349 --> 04:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
hi I'd like to respond to representative
 
04:01:30.889 --> 04:01:30.899 align:start position:0%
Perez I live paycheck to paycheck I work
 
04:01:32.929 --> 04:01:32.939 align:start position:0%
60 hours a week I work nights after I
 
04:01:35.269 --> 04:01:35.279 align:start position:0%
leave here I go and work nights so I can
 
04:01:36.229 --> 04:01:36.239 align:start position:0%
do this
 
04:01:38.750 --> 04:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
that was an accommodation my employer
 
04:01:41.090 --> 04:01:41.100 align:start position:0%
afforded me so I could do this I didn't
 
04:01:42.590 --> 04:01:42.600 align:start position:0%
used to do that I used to worked a
 
04:01:44.150 --> 04:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
regular day
 
04:01:44.160 --> 04:01:45.349 align:start position:0%
regular day
um

04:01:45.349 --> 04:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:01:47.689 --> 04:01:47.699 align:start position:0%
and I knew what I was signing up for for
 
04:01:51.710 --> 04:01:51.720 align:start position:0%
the 200 for two years I knew that there
 
04:01:54.290 --> 04:01:54.300 align:start position:0%
are uh legislators in here that are very
 
04:01:57.229 --> 04:01:57.239 align:start position:0%
young Valerie McDonald she's 18. so
 
04:01:59.750 --> 04:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
somehow she is making it work I don't
 
04:02:01.990 --> 04:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
know how it's not my business really
 
04:02:04.490 --> 04:02:04.500 align:start position:0%
there's a way if there's a will as a way
 
04:02:07.150 --> 04:02:07.160 align:start position:0%
and I'm making it work
 
04:02:09.229 --> 04:02:09.239 align:start position:0%
sacrificing home life sacrificing
 
04:02:11.929 --> 04:02:11.939 align:start position:0%
payroll sacrificing nights and not
 
04:02:13.550 --> 04:02:13.560 align:start position:0%
sleeping and coming here right after
 
04:02:16.429 --> 04:02:16.439 align:start position:0%
getting out of work there's a way to do
 
04:02:18.050 --> 04:02:18.060 align:start position:0%
it if you're really
 
04:02:21.170 --> 04:02:21.180 align:start position:0%
uh vested in doing this there is a way
 
04:02:23.990 --> 04:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
and I don't think the monetary aspect is
 
04:02:27.170 --> 04:02:27.180 align:start position:0%
the reason to do it I think it's your
 
04:02:30.170 --> 04:02:30.180 align:start position:0%
love of state or County or town or
 
04:02:32.570 --> 04:02:32.580 align:start position:0%
country whatever it is
 
04:02:34.969 --> 04:02:34.979 align:start position:0%
um I think it's uh the volunteer aspect
 
04:02:38.210 --> 04:02:38.220 align:start position:0%
of this is what should drive people not
 
04:02:40.610 --> 04:02:40.620 align:start position:0%
the financial
 
04:02:40.620 --> 04:02:42.469 align:start position:0%
the financial
um

04:02:42.469 --> 04:02:42.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:02:46.429 --> 04:02:46.439 align:start position:0%
you know reward that's what I think our
 
04:02:48.110 --> 04:02:48.120 align:start position:0%
state was created on it this was a
 
04:02:50.929 --> 04:02:50.939 align:start position:0%
volunteer project for people to do and
 
04:02:54.349 --> 04:02:54.359 align:start position:0%
that's why I signed up to do it and I
 
04:02:55.790 --> 04:02:55.800 align:start position:0%
also didn't know that I was also
 
04:02:57.710 --> 04:02:57.720 align:start position:0%
volunteering to be my County delegation
 
04:02:59.809 --> 04:02:59.819 align:start position:0%
which really sucks
 
04:03:02.809 --> 04:03:02.819 align:start position:0%
um I hate it so much but I have to do it
 
04:03:05.269 --> 04:03:05.279 align:start position:0%
that is what I signed up for so I don't
 
04:03:06.710 --> 04:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
even think throwing twenty thousand
 
04:03:08.330 --> 04:03:08.340 align:start position:0%
dollars a year at it would make me want
 
04:03:10.790 --> 04:03:10.800 align:start position:0%
to do that I have to do it though that's
 
04:03:13.010 --> 04:03:13.020 align:start position:0%
what I signed up for so I appreciate
 
04:03:17.030 --> 04:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:19.250 --> 04:03:19.260 align:start position:0%
thank you for your colorful remarks I
 
04:03:22.550 --> 04:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:25.670 --> 04:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely just um being a woman in
 
04:03:25.680 --> 04:03:26.450 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely just um being a woman in
here

04:03:26.450 --> 04:03:26.460 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:03:28.849 --> 04:03:28.859 align:start position:0%
um no events um I think we're all equal
 
04:03:31.490 --> 04:03:31.500 align:start position:0%
but then at the same token when this was
 
04:03:34.969 --> 04:03:34.979 align:start position:0%
first like thought of with the 200 you
 
04:03:36.670 --> 04:03:36.680 align:start position:0%
know we were given the speech during
 
04:03:38.990 --> 04:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
orientation about
 
04:03:40.849 --> 04:03:40.859 align:start position:0%
you know how we're supposed to dress or
 
04:03:43.070 --> 04:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
expected to dress that type of thing you
 
04:03:44.990 --> 04:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
know clothing like that costs money if I
 
04:03:46.969 --> 04:03:46.979 align:start position:0%
was a male I could buy like three suits
 
04:03:49.189 --> 04:03:49.199 align:start position:0%
and be like cool you know and some ties
 
04:03:49.199 --> 04:03:50.450 align:start position:0%
and be like cool you know and some ties
but

04:03:50.450 --> 04:03:50.460 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:03:52.910 --> 04:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
you know you know with women if you buy
 
04:03:54.650 --> 04:03:54.660 align:start position:0%
a dress you gotta have the bra and
 
04:03:56.510 --> 04:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
everything to go with it and I think all
 
04:03:58.250 --> 04:03:58.260 align:start position:0%
y'all if y'all are married or anything
 
04:04:00.769 --> 04:04:00.779 align:start position:0%
like that have been through this I'm
 
04:04:02.330 --> 04:04:02.340 align:start position:0%
getting ready to go out to dinner or
 
04:04:04.490 --> 04:04:04.500 align:start position:0%
anything so there's like these little
 
04:04:08.450 --> 04:04:08.460 align:start position:0%
things and you know I think you know two
 
04:04:10.309 --> 04:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
to six thousand dollars isn't
 
04:04:12.830 --> 04:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily gonna be like yes let me go
 
04:04:14.990 --> 04:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
do this because I'm gonna live off this
 
04:04:16.670 --> 04:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
money you know
 
04:04:18.650 --> 04:04:18.660 align:start position:0%
when it comes to like paying for housing
 
04:04:20.210 --> 04:04:20.220 align:start position:0%
costs and the other things you need in
 
04:04:23.210 --> 04:04:23.220 align:start position:0%
life so that's just my two cents on that
 
04:04:25.550 --> 04:04:25.560 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
04:04:27.830 --> 04:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
04:04:29.870 --> 04:04:29.880 align:start position:0%
okay quick history
 
04:04:31.670 --> 04:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
um and and uh
 
04:04:34.189 --> 04:04:34.199 align:start position:0%
we've been provided some very good
 
04:04:38.689 --> 04:04:38.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:42.170 --> 04:04:42.180 align:start position:0%
committee's researcher going back to
 
04:04:45.170 --> 04:04:45.180 align:start position:0%
2000 there's been about two thousand uh
 
04:04:47.269 --> 04:04:47.279 align:start position:0%
two dozen bills that have been referred
 
04:04:49.790 --> 04:04:49.800 align:start position:0%
to us on this bill
 
04:04:53.210 --> 04:04:53.220 align:start position:0%
um I just did a quick math and it looks
 
04:04:54.950 --> 04:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
like in total
 
04:05:00.410 --> 04:05:00.420 align:start position:0%
it's been 65 votes to kill and 13 votes
 
04:05:01.610 --> 04:05:01.620 align:start position:0%
in favor
 
04:05:05.510 --> 04:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
um it's it's made it to the house twice
 
04:05:08.870 --> 04:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
um as a not to pass both times it failed
 
04:05:11.210 --> 04:05:11.220 align:start position:0%
um as ought to pass and then went to an
 
04:05:13.670 --> 04:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate
 
04:05:16.490 --> 04:05:16.500 align:start position:0%
um been to re refer to interim study
 
04:05:20.870 --> 04:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
once by and large it is come up those
 
04:05:22.969 --> 04:05:22.979 align:start position:0%
two dozen times and it has failed those
 
04:05:25.070 --> 04:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
two dozen times
 
04:05:29.030 --> 04:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
um again not the reason to uh
 
04:05:31.309 --> 04:05:31.319 align:start position:0%
to kill it again but maybe a good
 
04:05:34.010 --> 04:05:34.020 align:start position:0%
indicator I should have mentioned in the
 
04:05:36.830 --> 04:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
first uh couple of builds or the first
 
04:05:40.729 --> 04:05:40.739 align:start position:0%
bill there is also the online
 
04:05:40.739 --> 04:05:41.510 align:start position:0%
bill there is also the online
um

04:05:41.510 --> 04:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:43.309 --> 04:05:43.319 align:start position:0%
voting system
 
04:05:48.189 --> 04:05:48.199 align:start position:0%
um or indicator where people have
 
04:05:50.929 --> 04:05:50.939 align:start position:0%
emailed in the either
 
04:05:50.939 --> 04:05:52.309 align:start position:0%
emailed in the either
text

04:05:52.309 --> 04:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
text
 
04:05:55.010 --> 04:05:55.020 align:start position:0%
um their their testimony and or the

opposition or opposed on this particular
 
04:06:01.010 --> 04:06:01.020 align:start position:0%
Bill there were 13 people opposed to it
 
04:06:03.889 --> 04:06:03.899 align:start position:0%
and eight people in support of it and
 
04:06:07.189 --> 04:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
there is some testimony here that will
 
04:06:09.229 --> 04:06:09.239 align:start position:0%
make it into the record but I do
 
04:06:12.110 --> 04:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
encourage everyone to uh to utilize that
 
04:06:15.410 --> 04:06:15.420 align:start position:0%
system it is a great way to read some of
 
04:06:18.309 --> 04:06:18.319 align:start position:0%
the testimony that others have sent in
 
04:06:22.269 --> 04:06:22.279 align:start position:0%
by and large the testimony came in
 
04:06:26.630 --> 04:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
one two three four five people opposed
 
04:06:30.229 --> 04:06:30.239 align:start position:0%
and sent in testimony and one two three
 
04:06:34.130 --> 04:06:34.140 align:start position:0%
sent in testimony in support of it
 
04:06:34.140 --> 04:06:35.510 align:start position:0%
sent in testimony in support of it
um

tomorrow close the business
 
04:08:23.040 --> 04:08:26.030 align:start position:0%
tomorrow close the business

04:08:26.030 --> 04:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:28.610 --> 04:08:28.620 align:start position:0%
um send it to me do you have the the
 
04:08:30.530 --> 04:08:30.540 align:start position:0%
electronic form
 
04:08:30.540 --> 04:08:31.550 align:start position:0%
electronic form
no

04:08:31.550 --> 04:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:08:34.849 --> 04:08:34.859 align:start position:0%
I will make sure there is a um there is
 
04:08:37.910 --> 04:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
a form that you can use online
 
04:08:37.920 --> 04:08:39.950 align:start position:0%
a form that you can use online
um

04:08:39.950 --> 04:08:39.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:41.990 --> 04:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if I oh we may have hard
 
04:08:44.570 --> 04:08:44.580 align:start position:0%
caught we actually probably do have we
 
04:08:47.870 --> 04:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
should have part there you go so it's up
 
04:08:50.689 --> 04:08:50.699 align:start position:0%
to you you can it would be
 
04:08:53.030 --> 04:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
or attachment a Word document or
 
04:08:53.040 --> 04:08:53.750 align:start position:0%
or attachment a Word document or
something

04:08:53.750 --> 04:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
something
 
04:08:55.309 --> 04:08:55.319 align:start position:0%
um would you like to follow the format
 
04:08:57.590 --> 04:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
of what we have here well it would be
 
04:09:01.429 --> 04:09:01.439 align:start position:0%
much easier for her if it comes in on an
 
04:09:04.010 --> 04:09:04.020 align:start position:0%
electronic version for Jamie
 
04:09:06.650 --> 04:09:06.660 align:start position:0%
um so it's up to you whichever you're
 
04:09:11.630 --> 04:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:14.990 --> 04:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:16.429 --> 04:09:16.439 align:start position:0%
I can really do who's going to speak on
 
04:09:17.809 --> 04:09:17.819 align:start position:0%
the floor of the house so I need to be
 
04:09:20.210 --> 04:09:20.220 align:start position:0%
able to report that
 
04:09:23.990 --> 04:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
um does anybody know for sure I don't I
 
04:09:24.000 --> 04:09:25.070 align:start position:0%
um does anybody know for sure I don't I
don't

04:09:25.070 --> 04:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
don't
 
04:09:29.150 --> 04:09:29.160 align:start position:0%
um I would assume Brett Pearson made the
 
04:09:31.370 --> 04:09:31.380 align:start position:0%
motion I'm assuming that rep Pearson
 
04:09:32.990 --> 04:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
would be comfortable speaking on the
 
04:09:37.670 --> 04:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:39.969 --> 04:09:39.979 align:start position:0%
um so rep Pearson speaking
 
04:09:46.309 --> 04:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:50.570 --> 04:09:50.580 align:start position:0%
is there any of the the four members
 
04:09:53.809 --> 04:09:53.819 align:start position:0%
um voting nope five members voting that
 
04:09:56.450 --> 04:09:56.460 align:start position:0%
would like to
 
04:09:58.309 --> 04:09:58.319 align:start position:0%
be responsible
 
04:10:01.130 --> 04:10:01.140 align:start position:0%
for speaking on the floor when is it

04:11:08.510 --> 04:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
Ed by representative constable
 
04:11:13.370 --> 04:11:13.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:13.380 --> 04:11:14.630 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:11:14.630 --> 04:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:16.429 --> 04:11:16.439 align:start position:0%
rep McCarter would you like to speak to
 
04:11:18.469 --> 04:11:18.479 align:start position:0%
your motion sure I have to find it in my
 
04:11:20.090 --> 04:11:20.100 align:start position:0%
phone sorry I didn't print it out this
 
04:11:20.100 --> 04:11:22.070 align:start position:0%
phone sorry I didn't print it out this
morning

04:11:22.070 --> 04:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
morning
 
04:11:22.080 --> 04:11:23.330 align:start position:0%
morning
um

04:11:23.330 --> 04:11:23.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:25.969 --> 04:11:25.979 align:start position:0%
I sent that to you Vanessa yes
 
04:11:30.110 --> 04:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:34.969 --> 04:11:34.979 align:start position:0%
I think HP 134 is looking to create a
 
04:11:37.429 --> 04:11:37.439 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreement with the
 
04:11:39.830 --> 04:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
legislative staff
 
04:11:44.269 --> 04:11:44.279 align:start position:0%
and my experience with working in the
 
04:11:44.279 --> 04:11:45.469 align:start position:0%
and my experience with working in the
unions

04:11:45.469 --> 04:11:45.479 align:start position:0%
unions
 
04:11:45.479 --> 04:11:46.130 align:start position:0%
unions
um

04:11:46.130 --> 04:11:46.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:48.650 --> 04:11:48.660 align:start position:0%
is that it's just
 
04:11:50.750 --> 04:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
um the incentives to level the playing
 
04:11:54.349 --> 04:11:54.359 align:start position:0%
field with regards to salaries and
 
04:11:56.330 --> 04:11:56.340 align:start position:0%
benefits however the unintended
 
04:11:58.309 --> 04:11:58.319 align:start position:0%
consequences of
 
04:11:59.990 --> 04:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
um such a collective bargaining
 
04:12:02.590 --> 04:12:02.600 align:start position:0%
agreement will eliminate the individual
 
04:12:05.150 --> 04:12:05.160 align:start position:0%
negotiating power based on Merit and
 
04:12:07.250 --> 04:12:07.260 align:start position:0%
performance which is important when we
 
04:12:09.110 --> 04:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
all go to work we want to be recognized
 
04:12:10.910 --> 04:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
by if we work hard we want to be
 
04:12:13.370 --> 04:12:13.380 align:start position:0%
rewarded for that and the guy who's kind
 
04:12:14.510 --> 04:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
of slacking off of the gal who's
 
04:12:16.790 --> 04:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
slacking off we don't want to be the
 
04:12:18.830 --> 04:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
same as them we want to shine above that
 
04:12:22.550 --> 04:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
and typically a Union contract does not
 
04:12:24.410 --> 04:12:24.420 align:start position:0%
permit that you're just you're all the
 
04:12:24.420 --> 04:12:25.490 align:start position:0%
permit that you're just you're all the
same

04:12:25.490 --> 04:12:25.500 align:start position:0%
same
 
04:12:28.429 --> 04:12:28.439 align:start position:0%
but it's based on seniority if you work
 
04:12:30.170 --> 04:12:30.180 align:start position:0%
there a year more than the guy behind
 
04:12:34.429 --> 04:12:34.439 align:start position:0%
you or the gal behind you you're able to
 
04:12:36.889 --> 04:12:36.899 align:start position:0%
advance and
 
04:12:39.410 --> 04:12:39.420 align:start position:0%
get that promotion regardless of your
 
04:12:42.290 --> 04:12:42.300 align:start position:0%
performance and the person under you a
 
04:12:44.870 --> 04:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
year or two under you in seniority isn't
 
04:12:47.510 --> 04:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
eligible for that same advancement even
 
04:12:49.809 --> 04:12:49.819 align:start position:0%
if they work harder and do a better job
 
04:12:53.750 --> 04:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
seniority per doesn't permit that so
 
04:12:56.330 --> 04:12:56.340 align:start position:0%
um just in my experience with a typical
 
04:12:59.870 --> 04:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
Union negotiated contracts and that
 
04:13:02.450 --> 04:13:02.460 align:start position:0%
seniority model model
 
04:13:02.460 --> 04:13:03.050 align:start position:0%
seniority model model
um

04:13:03.050 --> 04:13:03.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:05.450 --> 04:13:05.460 align:start position:0%
I would say that this is probably a
 
04:13:07.610 --> 04:13:07.620 align:start position:0%
Pandora's Box that we don't want to open
 
04:13:10.429 --> 04:13:10.439 align:start position:0%
and nobody has asked for this this is
 
04:13:12.710 --> 04:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
the union coming in
 
04:13:16.130 --> 04:13:16.140 align:start position:0%
um looking for an open door and when
 
04:13:17.570 --> 04:13:17.580 align:start position:0%
that door opens just an inch they'll
 
04:13:20.030 --> 04:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
swing it wide open so I would
 
04:13:21.610 --> 04:13:21.620 align:start position:0%
um seriously
 
04:13:24.110 --> 04:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
recommend that the committee votes for
 
04:13:24.120 --> 04:13:25.910 align:start position:0%
recommend that the committee votes for
Ito

04:13:25.910 --> 04:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
Ito
 
04:13:28.610 --> 04:13:28.620 align:start position:0%
thank you rep Carter
 
04:13:30.590 --> 04:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
um we seconded it I've got a rep
 
04:13:33.769 --> 04:13:33.779 align:start position:0%
Constable would you like to speak to it
 
04:13:38.269 --> 04:13:38.279 align:start position:0%
no well just real quick the
 
04:13:39.950 --> 04:13:39.960 align:start position:0%
um as we heard in the testimony this
 
04:13:42.670 --> 04:13:42.680 align:start position:0%
would affect I believe a total of 12
 
04:13:47.330 --> 04:13:47.340 align:start position:0%
individuals that didn't ask for it
 
04:13:49.370 --> 04:13:49.380 align:start position:0%
um they were never even asked their
 
04:13:51.950 --> 04:13:51.960 align:start position:0%
opinion of it uh this was is just one of
 
04:13:53.750 --> 04:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
these bills that was done on their
 
04:13:55.849 --> 04:13:55.859 align:start position:0%
behalf for you know and without their
 
04:13:58.429 --> 04:13:58.439 align:start position:0%
input at all and for that reason alone I
 
04:14:00.710 --> 04:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
would say that um that's an inexpedient
 
04:14:03.410 --> 04:14:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:05.330 --> 04:14:05.340 align:start position:0%
thank you representative any other
 
04:14:07.130 --> 04:14:07.140 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
04:14:10.130 --> 04:14:10.140 align:start position:0%
representative Perez
 
04:14:12.170 --> 04:14:12.180 align:start position:0%
yeah the only reason that I'm supporting
 
04:14:13.990 --> 04:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
the itl is because
 
04:14:17.030 --> 04:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
I was told that you know they did the
 
04:14:18.530 --> 04:14:18.540 align:start position:0%
the people who's going to be affected by
 
04:14:21.590 --> 04:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
this bill wasn't even involved in the
 
04:14:24.889 --> 04:14:24.899 align:start position:0%
conversation but to be honest uh
 
04:14:28.849 --> 04:14:28.859 align:start position:0%
I'm one of those people who is being
 
04:14:31.550 --> 04:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
part of the Union Nam Union
 
04:14:33.410 --> 04:14:33.420 align:start position:0%
and I have a lot of respect for the
 
04:14:36.170 --> 04:14:36.180 align:start position:0%
union I
 
04:14:40.370 --> 04:14:40.380 align:start position:0%
don't agree with you know that unions uh
 
04:14:43.910 --> 04:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
are bad or juniors are like take
 
04:14:46.010 --> 04:14:46.020 align:start position:0%
seniority and they don't see your
 
04:14:48.110 --> 04:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
potential they do and they give you
 
04:14:51.410 --> 04:14:51.420 align:start position:0%
opportunities on your potential as well
 
04:14:53.870 --> 04:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
um I do have respect for the unions but
 
04:14:55.610 --> 04:14:55.620 align:start position:0%
you know like I say you know the only
 
04:14:57.469 --> 04:14:57.479 align:start position:0%
reason that I'm I'm supporting the ideal
 
04:14:59.689 --> 04:14:59.699 align:start position:0%
on this one is because the people who is
 
04:15:02.750 --> 04:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
involved on this um didn't even be part
 
04:15:05.090 --> 04:15:05.100 align:start position:0%
of the conversation that make me feel
 
04:15:07.309 --> 04:15:07.319 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable about trying to unionize
 
04:15:09.530 --> 04:15:09.540 align:start position:0%
someone who doesn't even know that uh
 
04:15:12.290 --> 04:15:12.300 align:start position:0%
than being Universe you know that's the
 
04:15:16.030 --> 04:15:16.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:20.929 --> 04:15:20.939 align:start position:0%
thank you represent Perez rip wall
 
04:15:20.939 --> 04:15:23.330 align:start position:0%
thank you represent Perez rip wall
be

04:15:23.330 --> 04:15:23.340 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:15:27.170 --> 04:15:27.180 align:start position:0%
um there are 24 house staff employees
 
04:15:29.450 --> 04:15:29.460 align:start position:0%
here they've never been surveyed as you
 
04:15:32.330 --> 04:15:32.340 align:start position:0%
know and they seem to be very content
 
04:15:34.189 --> 04:15:34.199 align:start position:0%
with their jobs some of these people are
 
04:15:37.130 --> 04:15:37.140 align:start position:0%
my dear friends and I have asked them if
 
04:15:40.090 --> 04:15:40.100 align:start position:0%
they want to be unionized and they don't
 
04:15:42.830 --> 04:15:42.840 align:start position:0%
these people have been here a long time
 
04:15:45.650 --> 04:15:45.660 align:start position:0%
and the speaker relies on institutional
 
04:15:47.389 --> 04:15:47.399 align:start position:0%
knowledge when it comes time to working
 
04:15:49.790 --> 04:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
with the house our schedules and what
 
04:15:51.410 --> 04:15:51.420 align:start position:0%
where the bills are assigned and this
 
04:15:53.630 --> 04:15:53.640 align:start position:0%
that and the other and as well as for
 
04:15:55.490 --> 04:15:55.500 align:start position:0%
all the people we have who are the
 
04:15:58.309 --> 04:15:58.319 align:start position:0%
lawyers who write up our bills because
 
04:15:59.929 --> 04:15:59.939 align:start position:0%
these people have been here a long time
 
04:16:02.570 --> 04:16:02.580 align:start position:0%
they're content and happy and not having
 
04:16:05.630 --> 04:16:05.640 align:start position:0%
a union I I just can't support a union
 
04:16:07.370 --> 04:16:07.380 align:start position:0%
especially as I said because they've
 
04:16:10.130 --> 04:16:10.140 align:start position:0%
never been surveyed thank you
 
04:16:12.530 --> 04:16:12.540 align:start position:0%
thank you representative wall any
 
04:16:14.750 --> 04:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative Turka
 
04:16:17.210 --> 04:16:17.220 align:start position:0%
well I guess here we go because I
 
04:16:19.250 --> 04:16:19.260 align:start position:0%
probably should be accused myself still
 
04:16:28.370 --> 04:16:28.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:30.050 --> 04:16:30.060 align:start position:0%
I think you're fine
 
04:16:30.060 --> 04:16:41.210 align:start position:0%
I think you're fine
um

04:16:41.210 --> 04:16:41.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:41.220 --> 04:16:50.269 align:start position:0%
 
before

04:16:50.269 --> 04:16:50.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:53.150 --> 04:16:53.160 align:start position:0%
it's a good thought though thank you
 
04:16:56.630 --> 04:16:56.640 align:start position:0%
thanks for testing the system for us
 
04:16:56.640 --> 04:16:57.910 align:start position:0%
thanks for testing the system for us
um

04:16:57.910 --> 04:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:00.410 --> 04:17:00.420 align:start position:0%
the um
 
04:17:02.870 --> 04:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
any further discussion represent Perez
 
04:17:05.330 --> 04:17:05.340 align:start position:0%
yeah I do have a question I'm not
 
04:17:07.429 --> 04:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
working through a union right now but
 
04:17:11.090 --> 04:17:11.100 align:start position:0%
I'm a union member so I wonder if I have
 
04:17:11.100 --> 04:17:13.809 align:start position:0%
I'm a union member so I wonder if I have
to

04:17:13.809 --> 04:17:13.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:16.370 --> 04:17:16.380 align:start position:0%
you would have to be an active member of
 
04:17:19.610 --> 04:17:19.620 align:start position:0%
SEIU 1984 for this to be a conflict of
 
04:17:21.229 --> 04:17:21.239 align:start position:0%
interest okay
 
04:17:24.349 --> 04:17:24.359 align:start position:0%
okay good
 
04:17:26.570 --> 04:17:26.580 align:start position:0%
everybody's happy
 
04:17:30.309 --> 04:17:30.319 align:start position:0%
um I was born I would like to
 
04:17:33.229 --> 04:17:33.239 align:start position:0%
add in a couple of quick comments one is
 
04:17:36.889 --> 04:17:36.899 align:start position:0%
again we've had this bill a number of
 
04:17:39.830 --> 04:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
times the comments are particularly
 
04:17:41.990 --> 04:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
interesting from some of the committee
 
04:17:42.000 --> 04:17:43.550 align:start position:0%
interesting from some of the committee
reports

04:17:43.550 --> 04:17:43.560 align:start position:0%
reports
 
04:17:47.570 --> 04:17:47.580 align:start position:0%
um our own speaker Sharon Packard um
 
04:17:50.330 --> 04:17:50.340 align:start position:0%
wrote the blurb for for one of these and
 
04:17:52.790 --> 04:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
it says the bill is flawed in it that it
 
04:17:55.370 --> 04:17:55.380 align:start position:0%
would take away the authority of the
 
04:17:57.889 --> 04:17:57.899 align:start position:0%
presiding officers to deal directly with
 
04:18:00.889 --> 04:18:00.899 align:start position:0%
hiring and firing and instead place in
 
04:18:02.990 --> 04:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
the hands of the respective subcommittee
 
04:18:04.910 --> 04:18:04.920 align:start position:0%
of the joint committee on legislative
 
04:18:04.920 --> 04:18:06.170 align:start position:0%
of the joint committee on legislative
facilities

04:18:06.170 --> 04:18:06.180 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
04:18:08.870 --> 04:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
the bill has unintended consequences the
 
04:18:10.849 --> 04:18:10.859 align:start position:0%
legislative branch is a political body
 
04:18:13.969 --> 04:18:13.979 align:start position:0%
and the leadership of both Chambers both
 
04:18:16.910 --> 04:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
parties must have the option of having
 
04:18:19.429 --> 04:18:19.439 align:start position:0%
the people around them that they need in
 
04:18:21.050 --> 04:18:21.060 align:start position:0%
order to be effective
 
04:18:23.630 --> 04:18:23.640 align:start position:0%
that was interesting also this one that
 
04:18:25.490 --> 04:18:25.500 align:start position:0%
said there is much confusion caused
 
04:18:27.830 --> 04:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
around the Bill's language for example
 
04:18:30.110 --> 04:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
the office of legislative Services could
 
04:18:32.750 --> 04:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
be representing represented by one Union
 
04:18:34.429 --> 04:18:34.439 align:start position:0%
while the speaker's office could be
 
04:18:36.650 --> 04:18:36.660 align:start position:0%
represented by another clerk's office
 
04:18:40.130 --> 04:18:40.140 align:start position:0%
still another contrary to what we heard
 
04:18:42.530 --> 04:18:42.540 align:start position:0%
um no I'm not going that far
 
04:18:44.809 --> 04:18:44.819 align:start position:0%
um and that's uh
 
04:18:47.210 --> 04:18:47.220 align:start position:0%
that seems to be the case for all of the
 
04:18:49.550 --> 04:18:49.560 align:start position:0%
other reasons that we heard
 
04:18:53.929 --> 04:18:53.939 align:start position:0%
um I think it's a good thing to itl the
 
04:18:56.630 --> 04:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
online testimony submissions were three
 
04:18:58.870 --> 04:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
to three three support three opposed
 
04:19:00.889 --> 04:19:00.899 align:start position:0%
there were
 
04:19:05.450 --> 04:19:05.460 align:start position:0%
two items that were typed testimony one
 
04:19:09.889 --> 04:19:09.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:12.290 --> 04:19:12.300 align:start position:0%
with that I'll ask the clerk to call the
 
04:19:15.769 --> 04:19:15.779 align:start position:0%
roll we are dealing with itl on House
 
04:19:18.830 --> 04:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
Bill 134.
 
04:19:23.689 --> 04:19:23.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:25.550 --> 04:19:25.560 align:start position:0%

rep Richards
 
04:19:53.750 --> 04:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:57.650 --> 04:19:57.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:01.429 --> 04:20:01.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:08.210 --> 04:20:08.220 align:start position:0%
okay 14. and the clerk that's the chair
 
04:20:10.309 --> 04:20:10.319 align:start position:0%
yes I need more caffeine don't worry

folks every single committee does this
 
04:20:14.689 --> 04:20:14.699 align:start position:0%
not just this one I swore I would be

not just this one I swore I would be
different

04:20:18.410 --> 04:20:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:20.349 --> 04:20:20.359 align:start position:0%
we are at uh
 
04:20:24.110 --> 04:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
we are at 15-20
 
04:20:27.650 --> 04:20:27.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:34.070 --> 04:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:37.429 --> 04:20:37.439 align:start position:0%
rep Ricardo you will provide us a
 
04:20:41.990 --> 04:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:44.210 --> 04:20:44.220 align:start position:0%
and I think I'll close the hearing uh
 
04:20:48.410 --> 04:20:48.420 align:start position:0%
the exact session on House Bill 134
 
04:20:51.769 --> 04:20:51.779 align:start position:0%
and give a minute to reset and we'll be
 
04:21:06.370 --> 04:21:06.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:09.950 --> 04:21:09.960 align:start position:0%

04:21:13.490 --> 04:21:13.500 align:start position:0%

myself
 
04:21:18.370 --> 04:21:18.380 align:start position:0%
um as uh and I would offer
 
04:21:24.170 --> 04:21:24.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:28.309 --> 04:21:28.319 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative wall
 
04:21:30.050 --> 04:21:30.060 align:start position:0%
representative wall would you like to
 
04:21:35.450 --> 04:21:35.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:37.790 --> 04:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
please turn your mic on
 
04:21:40.189 --> 04:21:40.199 align:start position:0%
remember that I'm sorry
 
04:21:43.490 --> 04:21:43.500 align:start position:0%
um it's a complex issue as to who will
 
04:21:45.830 --> 04:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
have the jurisdiction over sexual
 
04:21:48.170 --> 04:21:48.180 align:start position:0%
harassment cases
 
04:21:49.790 --> 04:21:49.800 align:start position:0%
um you know if there's real sexual
 
04:21:52.309 --> 04:21:52.319 align:start position:0%
harassment occurring we need to act on
 
04:21:54.229 --> 04:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
and act on it quickly we can't just let
 
04:21:56.929 --> 04:21:56.939 align:start position:0%
things ride if this goes before uh the
 
04:21:58.550 --> 04:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
Ethics Committee there's a process that
 
04:22:01.670 --> 04:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
has to be followed and it takes time we
 
04:22:04.130 --> 04:22:04.140 align:start position:0%
do have a section of our guidelines if
 
04:22:05.870 --> 04:22:05.880 align:start position:0%
you look at your purple book you'll see
 
04:22:08.630 --> 04:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
that we do have such a section that does
 
04:22:10.610 --> 04:22:10.620 align:start position:0%
refer to sexual harassment but not to
 
04:22:13.790 --> 04:22:13.800 align:start position:0%
the level that we're talking about here
 
04:22:16.010 --> 04:22:16.020 align:start position:0%
um I we need to decide who's going to
 
04:22:17.929 --> 04:22:17.939 align:start position:0%
have jurisdiction
 
04:22:20.689 --> 04:22:20.699 align:start position:0%
over these kinds of cases it's something
 
04:22:22.429 --> 04:22:22.439 align:start position:0%
that's come to the Forefront in recent
 
04:22:25.490 --> 04:22:25.500 align:start position:0%
years and I think we need to take time
 
04:22:29.030 --> 04:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
to it effectively and do it
 
04:22:31.729 --> 04:22:31.739 align:start position:0%
right thank you
 
04:22:33.950 --> 04:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative wall any
 
04:22:37.130 --> 04:22:37.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:39.530 --> 04:22:39.540 align:start position:0%
I have one or two things that I would
 
04:22:41.389 --> 04:22:41.399 align:start position:0%
like to say one is the the online
 
04:22:44.150 --> 04:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
testimony offered 38 people opposed to
 
04:22:45.250 --> 04:22:45.260 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
04:22:50.809 --> 04:22:50.819 align:start position:0%
and four in support I would uh with no
 
04:22:53.630 --> 04:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
written testimony I would
 
04:22:58.610 --> 04:22:58.620 align:start position:0%
um point you to page 58 of the uh the
 
04:23:00.910 --> 04:23:00.920 align:start position:0%
purple book as it was colloquially
 
04:23:02.990 --> 04:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
referred to
 
04:23:06.530 --> 04:23:06.540 align:start position:0%
um and I would point out also that all
 
04:23:09.490 --> 04:23:09.500 align:start position:0%
of this was approved February 4th 2020
 
04:23:12.590 --> 04:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
by The Joint legislative facilities
 
04:23:12.600 --> 04:23:14.450 align:start position:0%
by The Joint legislative facilities
committee

04:23:14.450 --> 04:23:14.460 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:23:14.460 --> 04:23:15.110 align:start position:0%
committee
um

04:23:15.110 --> 04:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:18.710 --> 04:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
not everything that at this point is I'm
 
04:23:20.929 --> 04:23:20.939 align:start position:0%
aware everything that the Ethics
 
04:23:25.070 --> 04:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
Committee is responsible for
 
04:23:29.570 --> 04:23:29.580 align:start position:0%
or or deals in their wheelhouse has to
 
04:23:32.170 --> 04:23:32.180 align:start position:0%
be approved by both bodies of the house
 
04:23:36.290 --> 04:23:36.300 align:start position:0%
this was not but
 
04:23:39.110 --> 04:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
it was cleverly drafted and asked that
 
04:23:41.929 --> 04:23:41.939 align:start position:0%
the information from here would be put
 
04:23:44.330 --> 04:23:44.340 align:start position:0%
inside the ethics booklet so it's kind
 
04:23:47.450 --> 04:23:47.460 align:start position:0%
of a conundrum just in that and in a in
 
04:23:49.910 --> 04:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
and of itself so
 
04:23:52.189 --> 04:23:52.199 align:start position:0%
um they're they're there are a number of
 
04:23:56.389 --> 04:23:56.399 align:start position:0%
issues that need to be handled
 
04:23:58.670 --> 04:23:58.680 align:start position:0%
um it was probably a mistake on my part
 
04:24:01.370 --> 04:24:01.380 align:start position:0%
to make it a work session for
 
04:24:04.570 --> 04:24:04.580 align:start position:0%
um and basically an hour
 
04:24:07.729 --> 04:24:07.739 align:start position:0%
we need more time to deal with putting
 
04:24:10.309 --> 04:24:10.319 align:start position:0%
this in the right order again with the
 
04:24:12.410 --> 04:24:12.420 align:start position:0%
good intention of trying to make this
 
04:24:14.950 --> 04:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
booklet actually be helpful
 
04:24:19.070 --> 04:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure it is so with that
 
04:24:20.689 --> 04:24:20.699 align:start position:0%
um I will if there's no further
 
04:24:22.429 --> 04:24:22.439 align:start position:0%
discussion I will ask the clerk to call
 
04:24:25.250 --> 04:24:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:25.260 --> 04:24:32.990 align:start position:0%
 
oh

04:24:32.990 --> 04:24:33.000 align:start position:0%

04:25:51.349 --> 04:25:51.359 align:start position:0%
245.
 
04:25:56.990 --> 04:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:58.670 --> 04:25:58.680 align:start position:0%
rep Pearson would you like to speak to
 
04:26:02.090 --> 04:26:02.100 align:start position:0%
your motion thank you Mr chair
 
04:26:02.100 --> 04:26:04.130 align:start position:0%
your motion thank you Mr chair
so

04:26:04.130 --> 04:26:04.140 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:26:08.510 --> 04:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
I had the pleasure of serving
 
04:26:08.520 --> 04:26:12.889 align:start position:0%
I had the pleasure of serving
with

04:26:12.889 --> 04:26:12.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:15.290 --> 04:26:15.300 align:start position:0%
the name that just completely vanished
 
04:26:17.450 --> 04:26:17.460 align:start position:0%
my brain
 
04:26:21.649 --> 04:26:21.659 align:start position:0%
Marple representative Marple I did my
 
04:26:23.990 --> 04:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
freshman term representative Marple was
 
04:26:25.189 --> 04:26:25.199 align:start position:0%
still in the house
 
04:26:28.309 --> 04:26:28.319 align:start position:0%
uh and I listened to his
 
04:26:31.250 --> 04:26:31.260 align:start position:0%
his discussion of this uh uh you know
 
04:26:32.929 --> 04:26:32.939 align:start position:0%
from his own mouth he's been quoted a
 
04:26:35.389 --> 04:26:35.399 align:start position:0%
lot but I I heard it directly from him
 
04:26:38.990 --> 04:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
the the situation though that surrounds
 
04:26:42.950 --> 04:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
this bill is the it's really just a math
 
04:26:45.469 --> 04:26:45.479 align:start position:0%
problem in the sense that a one dollar
 
04:26:47.330 --> 04:26:47.340 align:start position:0%
silver coin
 
04:26:49.670 --> 04:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
does not have the value of one dollar
 
04:26:52.490 --> 04:26:52.500 align:start position:0%
actually based on current prices that
 
04:26:54.290 --> 04:26:54.300 align:start position:0%
would increase a legislators pay to
 
04:26:57.110 --> 04:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
around 4 800 a year which is a violation
 
04:26:58.969 --> 04:26:58.979 align:start position:0%
of our constitution
 
04:27:00.950 --> 04:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
that in and of itself makes this bill
 
04:27:04.250 --> 04:27:04.260 align:start position:0%
unworkable so
 
04:27:06.050 --> 04:27:06.060 align:start position:0%
that pretty much is the gist of what
 
04:27:07.490 --> 04:27:07.500 align:start position:0%
happens with
 
04:27:08.990 --> 04:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
with this
 
04:27:09.000 --> 04:27:09.769 align:start position:0%
with this
um

04:27:09.769 --> 04:27:09.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:11.990 --> 04:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
you know I
 
04:27:15.110 --> 04:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
one of the things that was was stated
 
04:27:18.590 --> 04:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
during testimony was and I wrote it down
 
04:27:20.510 --> 04:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
was if if people accept something as
 
04:27:23.929 --> 04:27:23.939 align:start position:0%
money then it is money well
 
04:27:26.689 --> 04:27:26.699 align:start position:0%
we all accept the US dollar as money and
 
04:27:29.389 --> 04:27:29.399 align:start position:0%
that's the official legal currency the
 
04:27:31.550 --> 04:27:31.560 align:start position:0%
United States it's what we've been paid
 
04:27:35.090 --> 04:27:35.100 align:start position:0%
and what we should continue to be paid
 
04:27:37.969 --> 04:27:37.979 align:start position:0%
so therefore considering all the factors
 
04:27:40.969 --> 04:27:40.979 align:start position:0%
this is a this is an easy idea for me
 
04:27:43.790 --> 04:27:43.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Pearson is
 
04:27:45.830 --> 04:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
there any further discussion
 
04:27:47.630 --> 04:27:47.640 align:start position:0%
representative wall thank you Mr
 
04:27:49.729 --> 04:27:49.739 align:start position:0%
chairman all I was going to add to that
 
04:27:51.950 --> 04:27:51.960 align:start position:0%
is that if we were to be paid in silver
 
04:27:54.349 --> 04:27:54.359 align:start position:0%
silver coins now weigh a lot less than
 
04:27:55.610 --> 04:27:55.620 align:start position:0%
they used to
 
04:27:58.010 --> 04:27:58.020 align:start position:0%
and I can't imagine anyone at any Bank
 
04:28:00.889 --> 04:28:00.899 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire or anywhere monitoring
 
04:28:02.929 --> 04:28:02.939 align:start position:0%
and weighing every single silver coin to
 
04:28:06.110 --> 04:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
make sure it's exactly what we need they
 
04:28:07.490 --> 04:28:07.500 align:start position:0%
will have to check the dates on the
 
04:28:09.530 --> 04:28:09.540 align:start position:0%
coins they'll have to weigh the coins we
 
04:28:11.389 --> 04:28:11.399 align:start position:0%
will have to carry all those coins I
 
04:28:13.790 --> 04:28:13.800 align:start position:0%
have no interest in carrying coins thank
 
04:28:13.800 --> 04:28:14.870 align:start position:0%
have no interest in carrying coins thank
you

04:28:14.870 --> 04:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:28:17.809 --> 04:28:17.819 align:start position:0%
thank you representative who wants to
 
04:28:21.950 --> 04:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:25.429 --> 04:28:25.439 align:start position:0%
um one quick comment one the item that I
 
04:28:29.030 --> 04:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
made a note for that said Purity
 
04:28:31.910 --> 04:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
um because coins are not all coins there
 
04:28:36.050 --> 04:28:36.060 align:start position:0%
are some that um are are higher levels
 
04:28:38.510 --> 04:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
of Purity and uh therefore more valuable
 
04:28:41.210 --> 04:28:41.220 align:start position:0%
so just saying you know a certain number
 
04:28:43.610 --> 04:28:43.620 align:start position:0%
of ounces of silver or a certain number
 
04:28:47.870 --> 04:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
of coins uh wouldn't wouldn't take it so
 
04:28:50.710 --> 04:28:50.720 align:start position:0%
um I too would be following the itl
 
04:28:53.269 --> 04:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
either is there any other further
 
04:28:55.849 --> 04:28:55.859 align:start position:0%

04:30:40.929 --> 04:30:40.939 align:start position:0%
motion to retain is there a second
 
04:30:44.450 --> 04:30:44.460 align:start position:0%
second by multiple people uh
 
04:30:48.889 --> 04:30:48.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:51.349 --> 04:30:51.359 align:start position:0%
uh representative Tierney would you like
 
04:30:54.830 --> 04:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:54.840 --> 04:30:56.990 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:30:56.990 --> 04:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:30:59.149 --> 04:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
this bill we've spoken about talked
 
04:30:59.159 --> 04:30:59.929 align:start position:0%
this bill we've spoken about talked
about

04:30:59.929 --> 04:30:59.939 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:31:02.469 --> 04:31:02.479 align:start position:0%
for two hours this morning
 
04:31:07.309 --> 04:31:07.319 align:start position:0%
and probably as many hours prior we are
 
04:31:09.710 --> 04:31:09.720 align:start position:0%
getting closer but we haven't reached
 
04:31:13.309 --> 04:31:13.319 align:start position:0%
the final spot where everyone's happy so
 
04:31:16.670 --> 04:31:16.680 align:start position:0%
I think we can do it with subsequent
 
04:31:16.680 --> 04:31:18.590 align:start position:0%
I think we can do it with subsequent
meetings

04:31:18.590 --> 04:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
04:31:20.389 --> 04:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Terry
 
04:31:22.790 --> 04:31:22.800 align:start position:0%
representative wall I want to say the
 
04:31:24.649 --> 04:31:24.659 align:start position:0%
same thing essentially that we're almost
 
04:31:27.410 --> 04:31:27.420 align:start position:0%
there it won't take a lot longer I don't
 
04:31:30.769 --> 04:31:30.779 align:start position:0%
think to get to where we need to get so
 
04:31:32.870 --> 04:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
um I'm assured that we're close enough
 
04:31:34.370 --> 04:31:34.380 align:start position:0%
that if we have one or two more work
 
04:31:37.010 --> 04:31:37.020 align:start position:0%
sessions we can make this happen and it
 
04:31:38.990 --> 04:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
needs to happen thank you
 
04:31:40.729 --> 04:31:40.739 align:start position:0%
thank you representative wall any
 
04:31:43.670 --> 04:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:46.790 --> 04:31:46.800 align:start position:0%
I will just say that I believe
 
04:31:49.670 --> 04:31:49.680 align:start position:0%
um we are close I believe this is
 
04:31:52.429 --> 04:31:52.439 align:start position:0%
something that we do need to do
 
04:31:52.439 --> 04:31:53.510 align:start position:0%
something that we do need to do
um

04:31:53.510 --> 04:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:55.309 --> 04:31:55.319 align:start position:0%
I think we just ran up against the
 
04:31:57.469 --> 04:31:57.479 align:start position:0%
deadline and um
 
04:32:01.670 --> 04:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
and if we were able to uh perhaps extend
 
04:32:05.570 --> 04:32:05.580 align:start position:0%
the the season another couple weeks we
 
04:32:09.349 --> 04:32:09.359 align:start position:0%
would be in in much better shape but it
 
04:32:12.649 --> 04:32:12.659 align:start position:0%
saddens me to Kick the Can down just uh
 
04:32:14.630 --> 04:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
a little bit farther down the road but I
 
04:32:17.649 --> 04:32:17.659 align:start position:0%
think it is for the best rather than to
 
04:32:21.229 --> 04:32:21.239 align:start position:0%
do something in haste and and have
 
04:32:25.250 --> 04:32:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:27.050 --> 04:32:27.060 align:start position:0%
um stiff opposition when we haven't
 
04:32:29.149 --> 04:32:29.159 align:start position:0%
thought through all of the unintended
 
04:32:32.630 --> 04:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
consequences that may occur so with that
 
04:32:32.640 --> 04:32:33.349 align:start position:0%
consequences that may occur so with that
um

04:32:33.349 --> 04:32:33.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:36.590 --> 04:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
I will ask the clerk to call the role on
 
04:32:41.090 --> 04:32:41.100 align:start position:0%

04:34:46.010 --> 04:34:46.020 align:start position:0%
how brief
 
04:34:47.810 --> 04:34:47.820 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
04:34:47.820 --> 04:34:49.551 align:start position:0%
um thank you
um

04:34:49.551 --> 04:34:49.561 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:51.349 --> 04:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
I would I would say that you know
 
04:34:53.390 --> 04:34:53.400 align:start position:0%
condemning the use of violence
 
04:34:55.551 --> 04:34:55.561 align:start position:0%
um is generally what we would all want
 
04:34:56.631 --> 04:34:56.641 align:start position:0%
to support
 
04:34:56.641 --> 04:34:57.230 align:start position:0%
to support
um

04:34:57.230 --> 04:34:57.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:00.529 --> 04:35:00.539 align:start position:0%
however this this bill that came to us
 
04:35:04.010 --> 04:35:04.020 align:start position:0%
was so broad that any any intent of
 
04:35:07.010 --> 04:35:07.020 align:start position:0%
self-governing was was included in here
 
04:35:09.949 --> 04:35:09.959 align:start position:0%
any intent and um it doesn't take it
 
04:35:12.709 --> 04:35:12.719 align:start position:0%
didn't take me much research to to find
 
04:35:14.510 --> 04:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
that um there were intensive
 
04:35:16.849 --> 04:35:16.859 align:start position:0%
self-governing people that was not
 
04:35:20.269 --> 04:35:20.279 align:start position:0%
justifiable nor Peaceable and I think it
 
04:35:22.730 --> 04:35:22.740 align:start position:0%
would be a mistake to say that
 
04:35:25.730 --> 04:35:25.740 align:start position:0%
um just your intent to sort of separate
 
04:35:29.029 --> 04:35:29.039 align:start position:0%
or be independent of any jurisdiction
 
04:35:32.090 --> 04:35:32.100 align:start position:0%
um is justifiable and I think it'd be
 
04:35:34.010 --> 04:35:34.020 align:start position:0%
wrong to say that
 
04:35:35.810 --> 04:35:35.820 align:start position:0%
um that you
 
04:35:38.449 --> 04:35:38.459 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be allowed to
 
04:35:38.459 --> 04:35:39.949 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be allowed to
um

04:35:39.949 --> 04:35:39.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:42.890 --> 04:35:42.900 align:start position:0%
to no I'd want to use the word violence
 
04:35:45.709 --> 04:35:45.719 align:start position:0%
because to me it's more of enforcing uh
 
04:35:48.830 --> 04:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
law right and there are certain examples
 
04:35:51.590 --> 04:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
that I don't want to get into down the
 
04:35:53.990 --> 04:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
rabbit hole but on both on the
 
04:35:56.929 --> 04:35:56.939 align:start position:0%
um there's examples of Chas that was a
 
04:35:58.970 --> 04:35:58.980 align:start position:0%
couple years ago those were intensive
 
04:36:01.970 --> 04:36:01.980 align:start position:0%
self-governing and also he had years
 
04:36:04.849 --> 04:36:04.859 align:start position:0%
prior to that in the 90s paramilitary
 
04:36:07.070 --> 04:36:07.080 align:start position:0%
groups that also were intensive
 
04:36:10.010 --> 04:36:10.020 align:start position:0%
self-governing they claimed legitimate
 
04:36:12.590 --> 04:36:12.600 align:start position:0%
reasons of what they were doing they
 
04:36:14.869 --> 04:36:14.879 align:start position:0%
believed they were Justified
 
04:36:16.849 --> 04:36:16.859 align:start position:0%
um and I think it'd be wrong to just
 
04:36:18.529 --> 04:36:18.539 align:start position:0%
blanket that all of those people
 
04:36:20.330 --> 04:36:20.340 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be touched just because they
 
04:36:24.051 --> 04:36:24.061 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:27.890 --> 04:36:27.900 align:start position:0%

04:36:27.900 --> 04:36:28.670 align:start position:0%

reptierney would you like to speak to
 
04:36:34.551 --> 04:36:34.561 align:start position:0%

04:36:56.510 --> 04:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
didn't

didn't
uh

04:36:57.949 --> 04:36:57.959 align:start position:0%

04:37:11.510 --> 04:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
seeing none I will just make one or two
 
04:37:12.830 --> 04:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
comments here
 
04:37:15.949 --> 04:37:15.959 align:start position:0%
um we received some testimony during
 
04:37:18.470 --> 04:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
this uh from
 
04:37:21.289 --> 04:37:21.299 align:start position:0%
a colleague a past colleague of ours uh
 
04:37:25.189 --> 04:37:25.199 align:start position:0%
honorable Dan Itza and I just want to
 
04:37:28.970 --> 04:37:28.980 align:start position:0%
read one two sentences that he wrote The
 
04:37:31.789 --> 04:37:31.799 align:start position:0%
Power of people to organize a society
 
04:37:35.090 --> 04:37:35.100 align:start position:0%
hence self-governance is premised on the
 
04:37:37.010 --> 04:37:37.020 align:start position:0%
situation that they are existing in the
 
04:37:39.650 --> 04:37:39.660 align:start position:0%
state of nature state of nature exists
 
04:37:43.010 --> 04:37:43.020 align:start position:0%
when either there is no government or
 
04:37:44.990 --> 04:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
the government that does exist has so
 
04:37:47.029 --> 04:37:47.039 align:start position:0%
deviated from its purpose and Charter
 
04:37:49.849 --> 04:37:49.859 align:start position:0%
that is no longer effectual
 
04:37:52.010 --> 04:37:52.020 align:start position:0%
close quote um
 
04:37:54.590 --> 04:37:54.600 align:start position:0%
to me there has been no evidence given
 
04:37:58.131 --> 04:37:58.141 align:start position:0%
of a situation so dire as to require our
 
04:38:00.709 --> 04:38:00.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire citizens to self-govern
 
04:38:04.250 --> 04:38:04.260 align:start position:0%
or seek self-governance therefore absent
 
04:38:06.109 --> 04:38:06.119 align:start position:0%
the conditions when the sponsors feel
 
04:38:08.150 --> 04:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
this resolution shall be instituted I
 
04:38:11.051 --> 04:38:11.061 align:start position:0%
see no reason to vote in favor
 
04:38:15.470 --> 04:38:15.480 align:start position:0%
it does seem ironic that
 
04:38:18.051 --> 04:38:18.061 align:start position:0%
the sponsors are using the tools of
 
04:38:20.390 --> 04:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
government to set up restrictions on how
 
04:38:21.709 --> 04:38:21.719 align:start position:0%
that government can deal with
 
04:38:23.929 --> 04:38:23.939 align:start position:0%
Insurrection which
 
04:38:23.939 --> 04:38:25.551 align:start position:0%
Insurrection which
I

04:38:25.551 --> 04:38:25.561 align:start position:0%

I guess want in the record
 
04:38:31.010 --> 04:38:31.020 align:start position:0%
um at any point seeing no further
 
04:38:32.570 --> 04:38:32.580 align:start position:0%
discussion I'll ask the clerk to call

splitting that in half so maybe fewer
 
04:40:50.640 --> 04:40:52.130 align:start position:0%
splitting that in half so maybe fewer
people

04:40:52.130 --> 04:40:52.140 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:40:54.590 --> 04:40:54.600 align:start position:0%
get more done
 
04:40:57.530 --> 04:40:57.540 align:start position:0%
um interesting question I um I honestly
 
04:41:00.288 --> 04:41:00.298 align:start position:0%
have not even given that a thought it it
 
04:41:01.430 --> 04:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
won't be
 
04:41:03.410 --> 04:41:03.420 align:start position:0%
um just just for process for everyone
 
04:41:05.270 --> 04:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
that's not aware
 
04:41:08.810 --> 04:41:08.820 align:start position:0%
um these these would be done
 
04:41:08.820 --> 04:41:09.530 align:start position:0%
um these these would be done
um

04:41:09.530 --> 04:41:09.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:11.350 --> 04:41:11.360 align:start position:0%
not until
 
04:41:14.330 --> 04:41:14.340 align:start position:0%
our work is completed uh at the
 
04:41:17.390 --> 04:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
legislator probably the budget process
 
04:41:20.750 --> 04:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
is done is when the speaker allows us to
 
04:41:22.128 --> 04:41:22.138 align:start position:0%
set up
 
04:41:26.868 --> 04:41:26.878 align:start position:0%
summer retain building buildings so we
 
04:41:28.970 --> 04:41:28.980 align:start position:0%
can certainly have that this
 
04:41:31.730 --> 04:41:31.740 align:start position:0%
conversation I think we'll probably have
 
04:41:34.550 --> 04:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
it internally from the ranking member
 
04:41:35.448 --> 04:41:35.458 align:start position:0%
and I
 
04:41:35.458 --> 04:41:36.410 align:start position:0%
and I
um

04:41:36.410 --> 04:41:36.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:39.110 --> 04:41:39.120 align:start position:0%
what's the what's the pleasure I mean I
 
04:41:40.788 --> 04:41:40.798 align:start position:0%
it would seem to me we've done pretty
 
04:41:42.890 --> 04:41:42.900 align:start position:0%
well working on this as a committee of
 
04:41:45.650 --> 04:41:45.660 align:start position:0%
the whole for especially the ethics
 
04:41:45.660 --> 04:41:47.150 align:start position:0%
the whole for especially the ethics
build

04:41:47.150 --> 04:41:47.160 align:start position:0%
build
 
04:41:50.750 --> 04:41:50.760 align:start position:0%
um I don't I it may be better and I'm
 
04:41:53.390 --> 04:41:53.400 align:start position:0%
just on the top of my head thinking that
 
04:41:56.030 --> 04:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
it may be better to do a subcommittee on
 
04:41:58.910 --> 04:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
the other one and then come back and and
 
04:41:58.920 --> 04:42:00.050 align:start position:0%
the other one and then come back and and
meet

04:42:00.050 --> 04:42:00.060 align:start position:0%
meet
 
04:42:00.060 --> 04:42:02.868 align:start position:0%
meet
um

04:42:02.868 --> 04:42:02.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:06.530 --> 04:42:06.540 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah just just so that there may be
 
04:42:08.810 --> 04:42:08.820 align:start position:0%
recommendations from that subcommittee I
 
04:42:08.820 --> 04:42:10.430 align:start position:0%
recommendations from that subcommittee I
don't

04:42:10.430 --> 04:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
don't
 
04:42:13.788 --> 04:42:13.798 align:start position:0%
um but at any rate that uh we will be in
 
04:42:16.368 --> 04:42:16.378 align:start position:0%
touch uh to be determined I guess is the
 
04:42:18.948 --> 04:42:18.958 align:start position:0%
best way I'm going to say that yep nope
 
04:42:20.930 --> 04:42:20.940 align:start position:0%
nope question any yep representative
 
04:42:20.940 --> 04:42:30.010 align:start position:0%
nope question any yep representative
McCarter

04:42:30.010 --> 04:42:30.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:34.310 --> 04:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:34.320 --> 04:42:36.288 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:42:36.288 --> 04:42:36.298 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:42:38.810 --> 04:42:38.820 align:start position:0%
by by you asking
 
04:42:38.820 --> 04:42:41.930 align:start position:0%
by by you asking
um

04:42:41.930 --> 04:42:41.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:44.690 --> 04:42:44.700 align:start position:0%
um it is uh it could be uh any of those
 
04:42:48.350 --> 04:42:48.360 align:start position:0%
any or all to without being a smart guy
 
04:42:48.360 --> 04:42:49.070 align:start position:0%
any or all to without being a smart guy
um

04:42:49.070 --> 04:42:49.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:49.080 --> 04:42:50.448 align:start position:0%
um
yep

04:42:50.448 --> 04:42:50.458 align:start position:0%
yep
 
04:42:52.850 --> 04:42:52.860 align:start position:0%
um if there is anyone that specifically
 
04:42:55.730 --> 04:42:55.740 align:start position:0%
wants to deal on something like that
 
04:42:58.250 --> 04:42:58.260 align:start position:0%
um I'm just not used to it nobody nobody
 
04:43:01.368 --> 04:43:01.378 align:start position:0%
ever does those volunteer type things so
 
04:43:04.250 --> 04:43:04.260 align:start position:0%
um so let's see uh there we go so let's
 
04:43:07.070 --> 04:43:07.080 align:start position:0%
see how that works um but we certainly
 
04:43:08.868 --> 04:43:08.878 align:start position:0%
are going to be spending
 
04:43:11.150 --> 04:43:11.160 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of time together
 
04:43:14.330 --> 04:43:14.340 align:start position:0%
in reps hall for the next uh
 
04:43:17.330 --> 04:43:17.340 align:start position:0%
foreseeable future here so I imagine if
 
04:43:19.010 --> 04:43:19.020 align:start position:0%
there will run into each other if
 
04:43:21.288 --> 04:43:21.298 align:start position:0%
there's questions along the way feel
 
04:43:23.150 --> 04:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
free to ask those if there's any
 
04:43:25.128 --> 04:43:25.138 align:start position:0%
progress in the way I'll make sure that
 
04:43:25.138 --> 04:43:27.250 align:start position:0%
progress in the way I'll make sure that
either

04:43:27.250 --> 04:43:27.260 align:start position:0%
either
 
04:43:30.910 --> 04:43:30.920 align:start position:0%
reption or I will let everybody know
 
04:43:34.850 --> 04:43:34.860 align:start position:0%
but feel free you know our numbers give
 
04:43:36.288 --> 04:43:36.298 align:start position:0%
us a call and and we'll talk about
 
04:43:38.208 --> 04:43:38.218 align:start position:0%
anything you want to what about Senate
 
04:43:38.218 --> 04:43:39.550 align:start position:0%
anything you want to what about Senate
bills

04:43:39.550 --> 04:43:39.560 align:start position:0%
bills
 
04:43:42.170 --> 04:43:42.180 align:start position:0%
uh a question was just had on Senate
 
04:43:44.030 --> 04:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
bills um
 
04:43:47.330 --> 04:43:47.340 align:start position:0%
I am not privy to anything that's coming
 
04:43:48.830 --> 04:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
our way
 
04:43:48.840 --> 04:43:49.868 align:start position:0%
our way
um

04:43:49.868 --> 04:43:49.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:52.910 --> 04:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
yeah are there sent to the I'm not
 
04:43:54.590 --> 04:43:54.600 align:start position:0%
familiar with the makeup of their
 
04:43:56.930 --> 04:43:56.940 align:start position:0%
committees I know that they're not
 
04:44:00.350 --> 04:44:00.360 align:start position:0%
exactly the same as ours so there do
 
04:44:03.288 --> 04:44:03.298 align:start position:0%
they have a legend admin committee uh
 
04:44:03.298 --> 04:44:05.390 align:start position:0%
they have a legend admin committee uh
really

04:44:05.390 --> 04:44:05.400 align:start position:0%
really
 
04:44:08.390 --> 04:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
um the bills that have come to us in the
 
04:44:11.510 --> 04:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
past have come from different places and
 
04:44:13.070 --> 04:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
and obviously everything that comes
 
04:44:15.170 --> 04:44:15.180 align:start position:0%
across has to be coming through the
 
04:44:17.510 --> 04:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
filter of the speaker's office and and
 
04:44:19.550 --> 04:44:19.560 align:start position:0%
sometimes he can send things to us that
 
04:44:22.010 --> 04:44:22.020 align:start position:0%
he thinks are in our wheelhouse
 
04:44:24.890 --> 04:44:24.900 align:start position:0%
um but there there is no pipeline you
 
04:44:27.470 --> 04:44:27.480 align:start position:0%
know as house transportation and Senate
 
04:44:29.690 --> 04:44:29.700 align:start position:0%
Transportation you know obviously
 
04:44:32.330 --> 04:44:32.340 align:start position:0%
um so I I really can't answer it I don't
 
04:44:34.910 --> 04:44:34.920 align:start position:0%
I don't know where to even go bang on
 
04:44:36.288 --> 04:44:36.298 align:start position:0%
the door and say hey do you have
 
04:44:37.730 --> 04:44:37.740 align:start position:0%
anything for us
 
04:44:41.270 --> 04:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
so as soon as I do and as soon as I have
 
04:44:44.510 --> 04:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
any information uh one or the other of
 
04:44:46.850 --> 04:44:46.860 align:start position:0%
us will make sure we get in touch and
 
04:44:48.410 --> 04:44:48.420 align:start position:0%
let people know
 
04:44:49.970 --> 04:44:49.980 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:44:52.490 --> 04:44:52.500 align:start position:0%
um failing that the only thing that it
 
04:44:54.550 --> 04:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
looks to me like we're going to
 
04:44:57.830 --> 04:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
potentially have
 
04:44:57.840 --> 04:44:59.810 align:start position:0%
potentially have
um

04:44:59.810 --> 04:44:59.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:04.070 --> 04:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
have uh someone speaking Maybe
 
04:45:07.070 --> 04:45:07.080 align:start position:0%
I guess well I don't know I I have not
 
04:45:09.890 --> 04:45:09.900 align:start position:0%
heard of anyone pulling anything off
 
04:45:11.690 --> 04:45:11.700 align:start position:0%
consent or wanting to pull anything off
 
04:45:13.250 --> 04:45:13.260 align:start position:0%
consent so
 
04:45:15.708 --> 04:45:15.718 align:start position:0%
um we may be off the hook as far as uh
 
04:45:20.510 --> 04:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:23.628 --> 04:45:23.638 align:start position:0%
um that stay tuned I guess is the uh is
 
04:45:25.128 --> 04:45:25.138 align:start position:0%
the watchword
 
04:45:28.010 --> 04:45:28.020 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much everyone have
 
04:45:39.610 --> 04:45:39.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:42.230 --> 04:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
are you doing yeah that's the one for
 
04:45:42.240 --> 04:45:48.670 align:start position:0%
are you doing yeah that's the one for
leadership

04:45:48.670 --> 04:45:48.680 align:start position:0%
