we're a little past 9:30 according to
 
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 align:start position:0%
the wall clock there um I'd like to
 
00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 align:start position:0%
welcome everybody to the next round here
 
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
we have going on um with the uh bills
 
00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 align:start position:0%
which are coming forward uh in House
 
00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:34.600 align:start position:0%
Education we're going to be trying to
 
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 align:start position:0%
move through these in a timely manner we
 
00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:41.319 align:start position:0%
have 107 bills coming to us of which 23
 
00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
are early bills and close to 50 of them
 
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 align:start position:0%
have fiscal notes on them so we have our
 
00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
task in front of us it is 6:30 and the
 
00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
first bill which we have in the doca
 
00:05:56.309 --> 00:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
today is uh 10 or 10008
 
00:05:59.590 --> 00:05:59.600 align:start position:0%
1,8 and that bill is relative to the the
 
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
authority of the commissioner of the
 
00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to Grant
 
00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
extensions for filing of school
 
00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:06.199 align:start position:0%
expenditure reports and I'd like to
 
00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800 align:start position:0%
welcome representative Sally fellows uh
 
00:06:15.309 --> 00:06:15.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:18.759 align:start position:0%
bill good morning I filed this bill at
 
00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:20.680 align:start position:0%
the request of the Department of
 
00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:23.639 align:start position:0%
Education but I also worked at the
 
00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:25.639 align:start position:0%
Department of Education for over 30
 
00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:28.120 align:start position:0%
years so I understand what this bill is
 
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840 align:start position:0%
attempting to do and and I um completely
 
00:06:34.309 --> 00:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
agree that it's a good idea uh it seems
 
00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:37.080 align:start position:0%
um a little
 
00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:40.520 align:start position:0%
unnecessary to identify only the
 
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner is a person who could Grant
 
00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:45.039 align:start position:0%
these extensions because they come up
 
00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
fairly frequently and he would probably
 
00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:51.560 align:start position:0%
pass it on to the next person who is
 
00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
likely to speak so I um completely
 
00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:58.280 align:start position:0%
support this Bill thank you very much uh
 
00:06:59.830 --> 00:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
representative are there any questions
 
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
we do have following Sally um uh the
 
00:07:05.869 --> 00:07:05.879 align:start position:0%
Department of Education here to speak to
 
00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:10.039 align:start position:0%
this as well for technical support good
 
00:07:13.029 --> 00:07:13.039 align:start position:0%
thank you have a question for uh you you
 
00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:15.800 align:start position:0%
have one question here uh thank you
 
00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:17.800 align:start position:0%
representative um I was just wondering
 
00:07:21.909 --> 00:07:21.919 align:start position:0%
if this um uh section um with the change
 
00:07:25.029 --> 00:07:25.039 align:start position:0%
applies to uh all
 
00:07:33.869 --> 00:07:33.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
Mark get that one okay I'll let Mark
 
00:07:37.309 --> 00:07:37.319 align:start position:0%
answer okay thank
 
00:07:40.309 --> 00:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
you so thank you very much uh I'd like
 
00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
to welcome Mark
 
00:07:45.469 --> 00:07:45.479 align:start position:0%
magnoli I hope I said your last name
 
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
properly Mark I've had struggled with
 
00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:50.280 align:start position:0%
that ever since I've known you in the
 
00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:53.120 align:start position:0%
LBA that's okay Mark magello Department
 
00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:55.919 align:start position:0%
of Education Bureau of school Finance um
 
00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
so yeah uh the department worked with
 
00:08:00.149 --> 00:08:00.159 align:start position:0%
representative fellows to uh craft this
 
00:08:03.189 --> 00:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
bill um it's just two changes really um
 
00:08:06.869 --> 00:08:06.879 align:start position:0%
it's the this relates to the doe2 which
 
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
is the financial report that districts
 
00:08:11.029 --> 00:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
and Charter Schools complete um those
 
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:14.800 align:start position:0%
reports are due September 1st um we so
 
00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:18.360 align:start position:0%
we start um uh notifying all the
 
00:08:19.869 --> 00:08:19.879 align:start position:0%
districts and charter schools that the
 
00:08:23.469 --> 00:08:23.479 align:start position:0%
reports are due September 1st uh with
 
00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:25.720 align:start position:0%
districts there is uh more pressure to
 
00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
get those reports in timely because Dr
 
00:08:30.189 --> 00:08:30.199 align:start position:0%
can't set tax rate until those reports
 
00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
are in and complete and valid and
 
00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
reviewed by us um so about um uh I have
 
00:08:39.029 --> 00:08:39.039 align:start position:0%
some data here I um I don't have data
 
00:08:41.709 --> 00:08:41.719 align:start position:0%
for when they come in but um the
 
00:08:43.389 --> 00:08:43.399 align:start position:0%
Department of Education is able to
 
00:08:46.829 --> 00:08:46.839 align:start position:0%
approve about half of all doe 25s by the
 
00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
close of September 30th um so most of
 
00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:53.360 align:start position:0%
the saus are getting their doe 25s in
 
00:08:55.949 --> 00:08:55.959 align:start position:0%
timely um and and and moving through the
 
00:08:58.069 --> 00:08:58.079 align:start position:0%
process pretty quickly um but sometimes
 
00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:00.200 align:start position:0%
in SAU uh
 
00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:02.600 align:start position:0%
uh for whatever reason needs to extend
 
00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
the deadline of when they think they can
 
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
get the doe2 in there could be a lot of
 
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:08.440 align:start position:0%
reasons one of the main reasons is
 
00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
turnover um within the saus um if it's a
 
00:09:13.829 --> 00:09:13.839 align:start position:0%
new ba coming in um they might need more
 
00:09:15.389 --> 00:09:15.399 align:start position:0%
assistance and help um getting their
 
00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:18.440 align:start position:0%
do25 in and so the way the process works
 
00:09:21.509 --> 00:09:21.519 align:start position:0%
is um uh anyone who wants an extension
 
00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
on the do25 we generally Grant it um
 
00:09:26.509 --> 00:09:26.519 align:start position:0%
then we get later into the later months
 
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:28.720 align:start position:0%
October November we are going to start
 
00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:30.040 align:start position:0%
telling districts that were not going to
 
00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:32.720 align:start position:0%
be granting doe 25s extensions and they
 
00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
really just need to get them in um if
 
00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:36.040 align:start position:0%
they want to have a tax rate which they
 
00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:39.680 align:start position:0%
do um so this is mostly administrative
 
00:09:43.389 --> 00:09:43.399 align:start position:0%
um we don't um we don't have to uh we
 
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
can usually Grant these extensions um
 
00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:47.800 align:start position:0%
because districts are incentivized to
 
00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
get their reports in so they can have
 
00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
tax rates um but instead of just going
 
00:09:53.949 --> 00:09:53.959 align:start position:0%
through the commissioner and kind of
 
00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:55.640 align:start position:0%
bugging bugging the commissioner it'
 
00:09:56.829 --> 00:09:56.839 align:start position:0%
just be easier if you had the authority
 
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:00.160 align:start position:0%
to uh use a design um um the one change
 
00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
we that's for granting extensions um the
 
00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
one change we did not uh uh the
 
00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
authority still is fully within the
 
00:10:10.949 --> 00:10:10.959 align:start position:0%
commissioner not a designate is if um
 
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:12.760 align:start position:0%
the commissioner wants to withhold State
 
00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:14.720 align:start position:0%
funding um he doesn't have the authority
 
00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:16.959 align:start position:0%
to delegate that to anyone um this is
 
00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
only delegating the authority to Grant
 
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
the extensions um which we Grant um out
 
00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:23.320 align:start position:0%
don't the number but half of half of
 
00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:25.880 align:start position:0%
districts need an extension um so
 
00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:27.160 align:start position:0%
instead of having it come through him
 
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
off his office I can maybe do it a
 
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
little bit more
 
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
efficiently and I'm open for questions
 
00:10:34.389 --> 00:10:34.399 align:start position:0%
thank you very much represent
 
00:10:36.949 --> 00:10:36.959 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair good morning
 
00:10:39.269 --> 00:10:39.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here so two
 
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
questions you just indicated that about
 
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
50% of the districts don't submit in
 
00:10:46.829 --> 00:10:46.839 align:start position:0%
timely manner it seems unlikely that 50%
 
00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:48.440 align:start position:0%
of them have turnover in business
 
00:10:51.949 --> 00:10:51.959 align:start position:0%
administrators so why else is it delayed
 
00:10:51.959 --> 00:10:53.790 align:start position:0%
administrators so why else is it delayed
so

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:53.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's the doe2 sets you up for a
 
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:00.160 align:start position:0%
successful tax rat set season so there's
 
00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:02.440 align:start position:0%
a bunch of documents that they districts
 
00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:04.200 align:start position:0%
need to finalize and there's a lot of
 
00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:06.440 align:start position:0%
pieces to the puzzle and so a lot of
 
00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:08.240 align:start position:0%
districts we we try to tell them to not
 
00:11:10.829 --> 00:11:10.839 align:start position:0%
sit on the doe2 if you don't know what
 
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
your fund balance is going to be just
 
00:11:15.269 --> 00:11:15.279 align:start position:0%
give us a doe 25 and we'll review it but
 
00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
that's usually the final pieces of the
 
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
puzzle for setting tax rates is their
 
00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
fund balance so how much they're going
 
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
to give back to the taxpayers what their
 
00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
revenues are going to be in the future
 
00:11:29.509 --> 00:11:29.519 align:start position:0%
um those are the two main pieces um and
 
00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
so some districts like some districts
 
00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:34.760 align:start position:0%
have really uh well-run SAU offices they
 
00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
can close their books they don't believe
 
00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
they have any material errors in their
 
00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:39.959 align:start position:0%
financial statements but they just their
 
00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
preference is to hold on to it for a
 
00:11:44.509 --> 00:11:44.519 align:start position:0%
little bit longer um we tell them you
 
00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:47.320 align:start position:0%
don't need to do that um but we we but
 
00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
we're happy if we're getting half of
 
00:11:50.949 --> 00:11:50.959 align:start position:0%
them in in September it keeps us busy so
 
00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:54.120 align:start position:0%
we don't normally hound them um but some
 
00:11:57.069 --> 00:11:57.079 align:start position:0%
of them do want a little bit more time
 
00:11:58.750 --> 00:11:58.760 align:start position:0%
um and like I said I'll grant them 30
 
00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:01.160 align:start position:0%
days days in September um I'm going to
 
00:12:02.629 --> 00:12:02.639 align:start position:0%
stop I sto giving them time as we get
 
00:12:04.069 --> 00:12:04.079 align:start position:0%
into October they really need to get
 
00:12:07.629 --> 00:12:07.639 align:start position:0%
them in um so it's not the end of the
 
00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:10.600 align:start position:0%
world if if they're getting it into us
 
00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
the end of September or the 1st of
 
00:12:14.509 --> 00:12:14.519 align:start position:0%
October um and some districts have that
 
00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
preference to just have a little bit
 
00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
more time with their financials um just
 
00:12:19.829 --> 00:12:19.839 align:start position:0%
so they can set up all their documents
 
00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
queued up for tax rate setting season
 
00:12:24.629 --> 00:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
are there further questions from the
 
00:12:24.639 --> 00:12:26.590 align:start position:0%
are there further questions from the
committee

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:26.600 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:28.720 align:start position:0%
quickly so the if I'm understanding you
 
00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
correct ly the longest extension is 30
 
00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
days correct oh uh no so uh the
 
00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
extension the extension can only go 30
 
00:12:38.949 --> 00:12:38.959 align:start position:0%
days but then there's second extensions
 
00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
and third extensions so some districts
 
00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
need a second extension um and a third
 
00:12:46.629 --> 00:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
extension and so in those second
 
00:12:48.629 --> 00:12:48.639 align:start position:0%
extension cases it's probably
 
00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
something's going on that's more
 
00:12:52.629 --> 00:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
dramatic like rap uh extreme turnover in
 
00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
their SAU um sometimes they could have a
 
00:12:57.269 --> 00:12:57.279 align:start position:0%
cyber security attack which would make
 
00:12:58.470 --> 00:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
them difficult for them to close out
 
00:13:00.509 --> 00:13:00.519 align:start position:0%
their fun Financial reports um so the
 
00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
second extensions are kind of the more
 
00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:06.040 align:start position:0%
um uh extreme circumstances um that
 
00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
would cause them to delay getting their
 
00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:09.480 align:start position:0%
doe 25s
 
00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:12.760 align:start position:0%
in I have one more and that's
 
00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
it one more thank you very much Mr
 
00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
chair is there
 
00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:22.110 align:start position:0%
chair is there
any

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:22.120 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:26.360 align:start position:0%
uh any waiting or any preference to
 
00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
districts to Cooperative districts where
 
00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:31.279 align:start position:0%
many towns tax rates are contingent on
 
00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
that information being sent that is a
 
00:13:35.189 --> 00:13:35.199 align:start position:0%
good that is a good question that is
 
00:13:35.199 --> 00:13:36.350 align:start position:0%
good that is a good question that is
where

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
so kind of the the stick we have is we
 
00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
can stop we can we can withhold their
 
00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:43.880 align:start position:0%
state funding um to get um them to speed
 
00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:46.360 align:start position:0%
up their process um we it's a kind of a
 
00:13:48.189 --> 00:13:48.199 align:start position:0%
balancing act in a sense that we want
 
00:13:51.189 --> 00:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
the do doe 25s to be coming in so we
 
00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:53.320 align:start position:0%
don't have to review all 178 within a
 
00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
short window um so we tell the districts
 
00:13:58.470 --> 00:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
get them in so you don't overwhelm us
 
00:13:59.629 --> 00:13:59.639 align:start position:0%
then they're getting pressure from the
 
00:14:01.949 --> 00:14:01.959 align:start position:0%
towns so Cooperative districts tend to
 
00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:03.480 align:start position:0%
get the most pressure because they have
 
00:14:04.509 --> 00:14:04.519 align:start position:0%
the most amount of towns that are
 
00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
dependent on so those ones are we always
 
00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:08.600 align:start position:0%
prioritize Cooperative when a
 
00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
Cooperative do25 gets in that's the
 
00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
first one we do because we know that
 
00:14:13.509 --> 00:14:13.519 align:start position:0%
there's not just one town that's going
 
00:14:14.829 --> 00:14:14.839 align:start position:0%
to be angry it's going to be multiple
 
00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:18.680 align:start position:0%
towns um and so naturally we don't need
 
00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
to withhold State funding or punish them
 
00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
because the towns people are going to
 
00:14:25.749 --> 00:14:25.759 align:start position:0%
punish them by emailing Dr emailing me
 
00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:29.480 align:start position:0%
emailing the SAU you know yeah yeah so
 
00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:31.000 align:start position:0%
so naturally this process kind of
 
00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:33.880 align:start position:0%
resolves itself um but we like to have
 
00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:35.480 align:start position:0%
the authority to withhold State funding
 
00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
if we feel like it's not resolving
 
00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
itself um and we use this extension
 
00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
process um to get a status of what's
 
00:14:45.509 --> 00:14:45.519 align:start position:0%
going on and um with in that situation
 
00:14:48.389 --> 00:14:48.399 align:start position:0%
when um when a District's really behind
 
00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
we make sure that they're we tell them
 
00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:52.720 align:start position:0%
to contact your towns because your towns
 
00:14:53.749 --> 00:14:53.759 align:start position:0%
especially in the Cooperative need to
 
00:14:55.949 --> 00:14:55.959 align:start position:0%
know what's going
 
00:14:59.670 --> 00:14:59.680 align:start position:0%
on thank you represent luno
 
00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:01.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair thank you
 
00:15:03.509 --> 00:15:03.519 align:start position:0%
very much Mr mangel for joining us this
 
00:15:05.749 --> 00:15:05.759 align:start position:0%
morning um you mentioned that the uh
 
00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:07.480 align:start position:0%
that the commissioner May from time to
 
00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:09.160 align:start position:0%
time withhold State funding and I'm just
 
00:15:10.949 --> 00:15:10.959 align:start position:0%
wondering where that Authority comes
 
00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
from uh comes from this RSA uh so it's
 
00:15:16.189 --> 00:15:16.199 align:start position:0%
um not in this bill there's I think
 
00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
three SE three sections of the bill um
 
00:15:20.949 --> 00:15:20.959 align:start position:0%
the third one is withholding State
 
00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
funding um that's not being amended here
 
00:15:25.389 --> 00:15:25.399 align:start position:0%
so that Authority is with the
 
00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner and he he has the authority
 
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
to withhold State funding for a doe2 not
 
00:15:33.749 --> 00:15:33.759 align:start position:0%
being completed fantastic thank
 
00:15:36.309 --> 00:15:36.319 align:start position:0%
you any further
 
00:15:39.509 --> 00:15:39.519 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank you
 
00:15:42.309 --> 00:15:42.319 align:start position:0%
Sally represent fellows I'd like to just
 
00:15:46.069 --> 00:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
add something just I just like to add
 
00:15:49.389 --> 00:15:49.399 align:start position:0%
that from a historical perspective that
 
00:15:51.629 --> 00:15:51.639 align:start position:0%
deadline has been in place for a really
 
00:15:56.949 --> 00:15:56.959 align:start position:0%
long time and you know if you go
 
00:15:59.949 --> 00:15:59.959 align:start position:0%
backed back to the early
 
00:16:05.069 --> 00:16:05.079 align:start position:0%
1990s this the doe 25s were less complex
 
00:16:06.749 --> 00:16:06.759 align:start position:0%
because you didn't have the issue with
 
00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:09.560 align:start position:0%
the fund balance and also now they have
 
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
to do some reporting of expenditures at
 
00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:14.240 align:start position:0%
the school level which they never had to
 
00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:17.720 align:start position:0%
do before so just just to let you know I
 
00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:20.120 align:start position:0%
don't think it's because you know the
 
00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
business operations have been laxed I
 
00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:24.680 align:start position:0%
think that part of it is that it's more
 
00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:28.600 align:start position:0%
complex what they have to do thank you
 
00:16:32.069 --> 00:16:32.079 align:start position:0%
with that we will close the hearing on
 
00:16:36.949 --> 00:16:36.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
10009 and I'd like to welcome back
 
00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:44.710 align:start position:0%
10009 and I'd like to welcome back
representative

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
fellow thank you um I I think you
 
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
probably well not the people from the
 
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
cities but people from the towns I think
 
00:16:58.990 --> 00:16:59.000 align:start position:0%
you understand what's in the um
 
00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
the annual report of the Town one of the
 
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
things it tells you about is how um the
 
00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:07.240 align:start position:0%
warrant it shows you all the warrant
 
00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:09.839 align:start position:0%
articles and what the vote was on the
 
00:17:13.029 --> 00:17:13.039 align:start position:0%
warrant articles for the prior year so
 
00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:15.240 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education used to
 
00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:18.360 align:start position:0%
collect those this goes like way way
 
00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:22.120 align:start position:0%
back probably before I was even born and
 
00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:25.480 align:start position:0%
um once in a while and they were stored
 
00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
in the office that I worked in um
 
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
computer and statistical Services way
 
00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:34.600 align:start position:0%
back in the 1980s and 90s and we would
 
00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
keep them and maybe twice a year
 
00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
somebody from the Department of
 
00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
Education would come down and they would
 
00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:44.440 align:start position:0%
want to look at those primarily the
 
00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:47.320 align:start position:0%
warrant articles to see what was voted
 
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
on uh could be part of the budget or
 
00:17:55.149 --> 00:17:55.159 align:start position:0%
could be something else and so now um
 
00:17:57.950 --> 00:17:57.960 align:start position:0%
Revenue Administration keeps the that
 
00:18:00.549 --> 00:18:00.559 align:start position:0%
information and also a lot of it is just
 
00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
online you know you could just go and
 
00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:05.080 align:start position:0%
get somebody a school district's annual
 
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
report so it's not that they don't need
 
00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:10.840 align:start position:0%
to be available and they will still be
 
00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
available but the Department of
 
00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
Education doesn't need to keep
 
00:18:18.669 --> 00:18:18.679 align:start position:0%
them thank you are there further
 
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
questions of the
 
00:18:24.789 --> 00:18:24.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:27.320 align:start position:0%
much welcome again
 
00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:33.789 align:start position:0%
much welcome again
mark

00:18:33.789 --> 00:18:33.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:36.149 --> 00:18:36.159 align:start position:0%
so as representative fellows uh
 
00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:38.440 align:start position:0%
discussed uh this report there's a
 
00:18:41.669 --> 00:18:41.679 align:start position:0%
report um there's a an RSA that requires
 
00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:44.440 align:start position:0%
um uh towns to send their Town report to
 
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:46.720 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education commissioner
 
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
um so this is a law that's valid and
 
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
still on the books um I get a couple of
 
00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:54.280 align:start position:0%
these mailed to me each year and so I
 
00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:55.480 align:start position:0%
don't really have the authority to say
 
00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
stop mailing them to me I don't need
 
00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:00.440 align:start position:0%
them um the internet exists um so if you
 
00:19:02.549 --> 00:19:02.559 align:start position:0%
were to enact this bill um next time
 
00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:04.120 align:start position:0%
someone sends me a town report I would
 
00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
just try to say you don't need to do
 
00:19:09.549 --> 00:19:09.559 align:start position:0%
that save money on paper um so and as
 
00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
representative fellow said uh we don't
 
00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
need these reports um we can access all
 
00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:15.640 align:start position:0%
the information using the dr's uh
 
00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
Municipal portal where are you storing
 
00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
the old reports so we have like at 25
 
00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
Hall Street uh the our new building we
 
00:19:25.549 --> 00:19:25.559 align:start position:0%
have a lot of bookcases so I kind of
 
00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:27.880 align:start position:0%
just put it in a bookcase but probably

know um so yeah I guess it makes it look
 
00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:35.360 align:start position:0%
like we have more books in our
 
00:19:38.149 --> 00:19:38.159 align:start position:0%

00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
wonderful okay we're g we got a a few
 
00:23:58.750 --> 00:23:58.760 align:start position:0%
moments here to
 
00:24:01.789 --> 00:24:01.799 align:start position:0%
um break before the uh next bill but
 
00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
what I want to do is take take a few
 
00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
minutes here to discuss where we're
 
00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
going and how we're going to accomplish
 
00:24:10.149 --> 00:24:10.159 align:start position:0%
some of the things this year um due to
 
00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
the fact that we have so many bills I'm
 
00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:15.720 align:start position:0%
going to allow the the sponsors the
 
00:24:18.789 --> 00:24:18.799 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of a bill more latitude in
 
00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
in presenting time than the ones that
 
00:24:22.669 --> 00:24:22.679 align:start position:0%
are following as
 
00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors and I'm going to ask and
 
00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:28.120 align:start position:0%
depending upon the bill the time we've
 
00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
allocated and the number of people that
 
00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
are are requesting to speak on it we
 
00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
most likely will set time limits I'm not
 
00:24:39.269 --> 00:24:39.279 align:start position:0%
going to set a General time limit for
 
00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
you know three minutes for every Bill
 
00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
I'm going to wait and see what we got on
 
00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
each bill and then set the time limit
 
00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
when the prime sponsor comes up and
 
00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
following the prime sponsor we will have
 
00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
time limits um we also have tried to
 
00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:56.480 align:start position:0%
schedule these bills so bills that have
 
00:24:59.230 --> 00:24:59.240 align:start position:0%
like topics for for example higher
 
00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
education I've communicated with the
 
00:25:02.789 --> 00:25:02.799 align:start position:0%
community college system the university
 
00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
system of New Hampshire and all bills
 
00:25:08.029 --> 00:25:08.039 align:start position:0%
that are are dealing with higher
 
00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:10.720 align:start position:0%
education we're trying to address them
 
00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
on the same day so folks from Durham or
 
00:25:15.789 --> 00:25:15.799 align:start position:0%
Keane or Plymouth or from White Mountain
 
00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
Community College Etc uh can be here at
 
00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
one time and not have to make many trips
 
00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:23.080 align:start position:0%
throughout the course of the
 
00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
month we also have 23 early bills those
 
00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
bills have to be out of this committee
 
00:25:33.389 --> 00:25:33.399 align:start position:0%
heard and EXA by February
 
00:25:36.149 --> 00:25:36.159 align:start position:0%
15th so that really does put some
 
00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:38.120 align:start position:0%
pressure on us seeing that those bills
 
00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
all have Financial notes and there will
 
00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:43.480 align:start position:0%
be much discussion on them so we're
 
00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
going to try to get them done as quick
 
00:25:48.269 --> 00:25:48.279 align:start position:0%
as possible here as quickly as possible
 
00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:50.320 align:start position:0%
and so we can get that can be in
 
00:25:52.029 --> 00:25:52.039 align:start position:0%
compliance with the rules that we have
 
00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:56.440 align:start position:0%
set as a house um there's also a another
 
00:25:58.230 --> 00:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
set of bills which are dealing deal with
 
00:26:02.909 --> 00:26:02.919 align:start position:0%
financing or the budget uh adequacy uh
 
00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:06.520 align:start position:0%
formula and I've set those up this week
 
00:26:09.549 --> 00:26:09.559 align:start position:0%
on one day and then there will be and
 
00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:10.760 align:start position:0%
that's on
 
00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:13.320 align:start position:0%
Wednesday and then on Thursday I've
 
00:26:16.029 --> 00:26:16.039 align:start position:0%
already assigned a subcommittee to work
 
00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
on those bills and uh they will be meet
 
00:26:21.269 --> 00:26:21.279 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee be meeting often
 
00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
there'll the subcommittee is open to the
 
00:26:25.669 --> 00:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
public we will be taking technical
 
00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
support on that those bills
 
00:26:30.389 --> 00:26:30.399 align:start position:0%
and and and then trying to make a
 
00:26:32.029 --> 00:26:32.039 align:start position:0%
recommendation back and making a
 
00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:33.720 align:start position:0%
recommendation not trying making a
 
00:26:35.149 --> 00:26:35.159 align:start position:0%
recommendation back to the whole
 
00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
committee here membership on that uh
 
00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:40.720 align:start position:0%
special subcommittee will involve six
 
00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:43.720 align:start position:0%
members from this committee right here
 
00:26:46.149 --> 00:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
two members from finance and two members
 
00:26:47.389 --> 00:26:47.399 align:start position:0%
from Ways and
 
00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
Means the people from Ways and Means and
 
00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:53.640 align:start position:0%
finance will not be voting on the final
 
00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:55.880 align:start position:0%
result seeing this is a subcommittee of
 
00:26:58.710 --> 00:26:58.720 align:start position:0%
the education committee but they will
 
00:27:01.149 --> 00:27:01.159 align:start position:0%
have discussion be treated as members
 
00:27:03.149 --> 00:27:03.159 align:start position:0%
during the time we are work doing work
 
00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:04.200 align:start position:0%
as a
 
00:27:06.029 --> 00:27:06.039 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and I'm not going to
 
00:27:08.549 --> 00:27:08.559 align:start position:0%
announce those names at this time seeing
 
00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:10.440 align:start position:0%
that we don't have all those names yet
 
00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:13.960 align:start position:0%
done by the the for ways and from Ways
 
00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
and Means and finance those appointments
 
00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:19.480 align:start position:0%
are being made by the speaker and the
 
00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:23.000 align:start position:0%
minority leader uh representa Wilhelm so
 
00:27:24.909 --> 00:27:24.919 align:start position:0%
um when I get word from them as who
 
00:27:26.669 --> 00:27:26.679 align:start position:0%
their representatives are going to be on
 
00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
this we're going to have total of five
 
00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
Republicans and five Democrats on that
 
00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so that that's that one
 
00:27:37.389 --> 00:27:37.399 align:start position:0%
right there there will be times this
 
00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
year got a minute here left that I know
 
00:27:43.149 --> 00:27:43.159 align:start position:0%
you're going to be out testifying for
 
00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
bills in fact there were several bills
 
00:27:48.909 --> 00:27:48.919 align:start position:0%
that came up in Senate education last
 
00:27:51.149 --> 00:27:51.159 align:start position:0%
Friday when we were in or Thursday when
 
00:27:54.509 --> 00:27:54.519 align:start position:0%
we were in session and that really I
 
00:27:56.269 --> 00:27:56.279 align:start position:0%
think perturbed a lot of people here
 
00:27:58.269 --> 00:27:58.279 align:start position:0%
seeing we couldn't break loose to
 
00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:00.360 align:start position:0%
testify on those bills and those were
 
00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
critical bills and so um we know that
 
00:28:06.269 --> 00:28:06.279 align:start position:0%
those bills are also go bills are going
 
00:28:08.909 --> 00:28:08.919 align:start position:0%
to go on in other committees here while
 
00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:11.640 align:start position:0%
we're discussing bills in this this
 
00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
also so please if you have to get up and
 
00:28:17.549 --> 00:28:17.559 align:start position:0%
leave just let us know where you're

00:28:21.789 --> 00:28:21.799 align:start position:0%
the other committee you're going to let
 
00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:24.640 align:start position:0%

00:28:27.509 --> 00:28:27.519 align:start position:0%
know present our our position that will
 
00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
help so that you'll be able to stay here
 
00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
as long as you can if they can text you
 
00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
a message saying okay we're open now to
 
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
you know people in the hearing process
 
00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
will will go there so also lastly if um
 
00:28:42.549 --> 00:28:42.559 align:start position:0%
you have to be out for some reason on
 
00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:45.480 align:start position:0%
this committee for a personal need a
 
00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
medical issue or or an obligation and
 
00:28:51.549 --> 00:28:51.559 align:start position:0%
you can't make it that given day I'm not
 
00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:53.440 align:start position:0%
going to get too bent out of shape over
 
00:28:55.269 --> 00:28:55.279 align:start position:0%
that we you can see we have several
 
00:28:58.750 --> 00:28:58.760 align:start position:0%
people absent today um that's okay we
 
00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
won't be taking you know we will be
 
00:29:03.029 --> 00:29:03.039 align:start position:0%
executing bills only when there's
 
00:29:06.269 --> 00:29:06.279 align:start position:0%
agreement like we had just now or when
 
00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
they're noted in the calendar just know
 
00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
when it's noted in the calendar then you
 
00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
cannot accept the bill prior to that
 
00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:16.840 align:start position:0%
noted date so that's how we want to work
 
00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
so if you have to take some time off
 
00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to be meeting at least three
 
00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
days a week possibly four then when the
 
00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:27.960 align:start position:0%
sessions in place and we also try to set
 
00:29:29.669 --> 00:29:29.679 align:start position:0%
some session days up if we don't have a
 
00:29:31.029 --> 00:29:31.039 align:start position:0%
whole lot of bills so we're acting in
 
00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
the morning in session or the afternoon
 
00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:34.480 align:start position:0%
in session we can use the other half of
 
00:29:36.029 --> 00:29:36.039 align:start position:0%
the day for hearings here in the
 
00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:38.240 align:start position:0%
committee and Fridays I'm trying to
 
00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
leave off uh however for uh many of you
 
00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:44.120 align:start position:0%
we know that on Fridays that's when all
 
00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
the other commissions and committees are
 
00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
meeting and so some of us will be here
 
00:29:51.909 --> 00:29:51.919 align:start position:0%
five days a week for for several months
 
00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
so it's it makes it difficult so with
 
00:29:58.149 --> 00:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
that any comments or input because we're
 
00:30:00.669 --> 00:30:00.679 align:start position:0%
ready now to go ahead it is
 
00:30:03.669 --> 00:30:03.679 align:start position:0%
10:00 and we do have a b schedule for
 
00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
10:00 and so I'd like to open up this
 
00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:09.320 align:start position:0%
hearing for HB
 
00:30:11.549 --> 00:30:11.559 align:start position:0%
1014 this is relative to the
 
00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:13.960 align:start position:0%
registration of high school students to
 
00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:22.070 align:start position:0%
registration of high school students to
vote

00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
so okay it looks like we're good
 
00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:28.440 align:start position:0%
representative pager here
 
00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
committee thank you Mr chairman thank
 
00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:40.480 align:start position:0%
you members of the committee I will be
 
00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
uh brief it's a pretty um modest bill um
 
00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
with couple points I'll I'll make on it
 
00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:50.440 align:start position:0%
I have written testimony coming coming
 
00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
around um really this does two this
 
00:30:56.950 --> 00:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
arose out of conversations after we
 
00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
passed the house passed this um Civics
 
00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
requirements last session uh
 
00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
conversations with constituents and
 
00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
students about what place uh voter
 
00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:08.480 align:start position:0%
registration might have in that
 
00:31:10.669 --> 00:31:10.679 align:start position:0%
conversation uh by way of background we
 
00:31:12.549 --> 00:31:12.559 align:start position:0%
passed a number of Provisions
 
00:31:15.149 --> 00:31:15.159 align:start position:0%
emphasizing the importance of civics in
 
00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
schools um so this bill largely um
 
00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
arises out of that there two operative
 
00:31:25.509 --> 00:31:25.519 align:start position:0%
Provisions really one is um requiring
 
00:31:28.269 --> 00:31:28.279 align:start position:0%
schools to inform students about the uh
 
00:31:32.149 --> 00:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
procedures and process of voting and um
 
00:31:35.269 --> 00:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
where and how to uh file uh voter
 
00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:39.080 align:start position:0%
registration it's a pretty modest um
 
00:31:41.269 --> 00:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
proposal it's it's I think naturally
 
00:31:43.269 --> 00:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
nested in the Civics education
 
00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
requirements uh which speak to um now
 
00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
requiring opportunities for uh Civic
 
00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:52.240 align:start position:0%
engagement political particip or not uh
 
00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:53.549 align:start position:0%
engagement political particip or not uh
civic

00:31:53.549 --> 00:31:53.559 align:start position:0%
civic
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
participation um
 
00:31:56.159 --> 00:31:58.269 align:start position:0%
participation um
unfortunately

00:31:58.269 --> 00:31:58.279 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
um so so so part of this I hope will
 
00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:04.720 align:start position:0%
improve on a good law and make it better
 
00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:08.120 align:start position:0%
um you know voter registration uh in New
 
00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:10.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire among eight eligible 18y olds
 
00:32:14.549 --> 00:32:14.559 align:start position:0%
18 18y olds is pretty low it's around
 
00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
15.6% we know that um that's an
 
00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunate number especially in a place
 
00:32:21.269 --> 00:32:21.279 align:start position:0%
like New Hampshire where we have a first
 
00:32:22.629 --> 00:32:22.639 align:start position:0%
of the nation primary and we pride
 
00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
ourselves on Civic and political
 
00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:30.360 align:start position:0%
engagement um part of the uh thinking is
 
00:32:32.029 --> 00:32:32.039 align:start position:0%
that U you know one of one of the
 
00:32:35.669 --> 00:32:35.679 align:start position:0%
outcomes I guess if we think about uh
 
00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
Civic engagement and involvement with uh
 
00:32:40.789 --> 00:32:40.799 align:start position:0%
the processes rates of voter
 
00:32:42.269 --> 00:32:42.279 align:start position:0%
participation so that's why that's an
 
00:32:44.549 --> 00:32:44.559 align:start position:0%
alarmingly low rate I could probably
 
00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:47.360 align:start position:0%
point to numerous studies that have done
 
00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
that have been done about um how there's
 
00:32:52.269 --> 00:32:52.279 align:start position:0%
sort of a virtuous cycle that happens
 
00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
when people participate in the political
 
00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
Pro process in terms of Civic engagement
 
00:32:59.350 --> 00:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
that become more active in nonprofits
 
00:33:01.389 --> 00:33:01.399 align:start position:0%
and Civic Community groups all those
 
00:33:02.509 --> 00:33:02.519 align:start position:0%
good things there's sort of this
 
00:33:06.029 --> 00:33:06.039 align:start position:0%
virtuous cycle registration is is one of
 
00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:08.360 align:start position:0%
those things that for an 18-year-old or
 
00:33:12.269 --> 00:33:12.279 align:start position:0%
many people can be um a hurdle and so it
 
00:33:15.629 --> 00:33:15.639 align:start position:0%
seems uh in the view of of some folks
 
00:33:18.190 --> 00:33:18.200 align:start position:0%
and myself included um that high schools
 
00:33:21.629 --> 00:33:21.639 align:start position:0%
and our Civics uh conversations will be
 
00:33:23.629 --> 00:33:23.639 align:start position:0%
an important part to leverage that and
 
00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
improve that voter participation rate
 
00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
it's not a Panacea it doesn't solve the
 
00:33:31.029 --> 00:33:31.039 align:start position:0%
problem at all but completely but it's a
 
00:33:34.389 --> 00:33:34.399 align:start position:0%
a a tool and part of this um I mentioned
 
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
earlier that there's you know a number
 
00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:38.720 align:start position:0%
of studies about the virtues the low
 
00:33:40.909 --> 00:33:40.919 align:start position:0%
voter registration rights and
 
00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:43.000 align:start position:0%
participation but I will point to the
 
00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:44.720 align:start position:0%
fact that two former Supreme Court
 
00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
Justices OK Conor and our New
 
00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's own Justice sutor have made
 
00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
a career out of in a good way out of uh
 
00:33:55.269 --> 00:33:55.279 align:start position:0%
a post bench experience of emphasizing
 
00:33:57.669 --> 00:33:57.679 align:start position:0%
civic's education and making voter
 
00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:01.240 align:start position:0%
uh participation part of that so um I I
 
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
think we would be in good company to
 
00:34:05.549 --> 00:34:05.559 align:start position:0%
sort of embrace that as and they placed
 
00:34:08.669 --> 00:34:08.679 align:start position:0%
more more specifically schools as uh a
 
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
place where that that can occur so I
 
00:34:12.669 --> 00:34:12.679 align:start position:0%
think we'd be in good company following
 
00:34:13.950 --> 00:34:13.960 align:start position:0%
some of their
 
00:34:15.629 --> 00:34:15.639 align:start position:0%
recommendations um the bill is
 
00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:17.240 align:start position:0%
intentionally open in its language in
 
00:34:18.909 --> 00:34:18.919 align:start position:0%
terms of how schools might go about this
 
00:34:21.149 --> 00:34:21.159 align:start position:0%
in conversations with folks around the
 
00:34:22.990 --> 00:34:23.000 align:start position:0%
state there are different uh approaches
 
00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
going on right now it's not terribly
 
00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:27.960 align:start position:0%
standardized um so this allows in my
 
00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
view um schools the ability to approach
 
00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
the problem in creative ways that are
 
00:34:36.510 --> 00:34:36.520 align:start position:0%
teachers and Educators and
 
00:34:38.829 --> 00:34:38.839 align:start position:0%
administrators know better than I do uh
 
00:34:41.669 --> 00:34:41.679 align:start position:0%
they know uh what works in schools and
 
00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
with their kids and communities and um
 
00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:46.720 align:start position:0%
they may come up with creative ways to
 
00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
approach this issue given given the
 
00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:52.440 align:start position:0%
language uh that's there two other
 
00:34:56.349 --> 00:34:56.359 align:start position:0%
points I hope maybe and then I'll stop
 
00:34:56.359 --> 00:34:58.069 align:start position:0%
points I hope maybe and then I'll stop
um

00:34:58.069 --> 00:34:58.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:01.640 align:start position:0%
the we as you may recall two years ago
 
00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:03.560 align:start position:0%
we this this Builds on an existing
 
00:35:05.349 --> 00:35:05.359 align:start position:0%
framework that already exists in rsas
 
00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
and by that I mean right now um students
 
00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:11.440 align:start position:0%
with disabilities as part of their
 
00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:13.960 align:start position:0%
special education program um are
 
00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:15.720 align:start position:0%
afforded an opportunity where
 
00:35:19.349 --> 00:35:19.359 align:start position:0%
appropriate to um register to vote with
 
00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
with assistance and so this bill extends
 
00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
the that um opportunity if you will uh
 
00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
to um all all the general regular
 
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
student population so it's building on
 
00:35:33.349 --> 00:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
something that's that's already in the
 
00:35:37.829 --> 00:35:37.839 align:start position:0%
in the rsas and one and and talking with
 
00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:40.200 align:start position:0%
clerks and my and I don't I don't speak
 
00:35:43.109 --> 00:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
for that Association but a number of
 
00:35:47.109 --> 00:35:47.119 align:start position:0%
them are very supportive Town clerks are
 
00:35:50.750 --> 00:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
supportive of any effort that will
 
00:35:55.309 --> 00:35:55.319 align:start position:0%
reduce um same day registration same day
 
00:35:57.470 --> 00:35:57.480 align:start position:0%
kind of chaos if you will a good chaos
 
00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:00.040 align:start position:0%
of people trying to vote but people at
 
00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:01.720 align:start position:0%
the polls and that sort of thing that
 
00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
can go on when folks are um you know
 
00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:07.240 align:start position:0%
long long lines anything that can reduce
 
00:36:09.109 --> 00:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
that in my view I think again I don't
 
00:36:10.829 --> 00:36:10.839 align:start position:0%
speak for that asso but conversations
 
00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:12.680 align:start position:0%
have been looked at and I think this
 
00:36:14.349 --> 00:36:14.359 align:start position:0%
will do that obviously again it's not a
 
00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
huge number uh but it is it is one um
 
00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:22.960 align:start position:0%
one one point to to emphasize um and I I
 
00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
said two points and I'll leave with one
 
00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
and that's um as a former fifth grade
 
00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:31.640 align:start position:0%
teacher way back in in the day I humbly
 
00:36:33.790 --> 00:36:33.800 align:start position:0%
think that this is one of those examples
 
00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:35.720 align:start position:0%
where we all know learning by doing is
 
00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:37.880 align:start position:0%
probably one of the
 
00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:41.000 align:start position:0%
most one way to maximize any learning
 
00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
Enterprise right when we're actually
 
00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
doing the event and or or doing
 
00:36:48.349 --> 00:36:48.359 align:start position:0%
constructing the learning this is I
 
00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
think giving an opportunity for schools
 
00:36:53.589 --> 00:36:53.599 align:start position:0%
to not just talk about the rights and
 
00:36:56.190 --> 00:36:56.200 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of a civically engaged
 
00:36:59.510 --> 00:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
person to vote uh but also give that
 
00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity to them to actually begin
 
00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:04.720 align:start position:0%
that process and engage and have that
 
00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:05.710 align:start position:0%
that process and engage and have that
real

00:37:05.710 --> 00:37:05.720 align:start position:0%
real
 
00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:09.240 align:start position:0%
meaningful experience of of of being
 
00:37:12.309 --> 00:37:12.319 align:start position:0%
part of the of the whole process so um
 
00:37:14.589 --> 00:37:14.599 align:start position:0%
with that I'm happy to take take
 
00:37:16.270 --> 00:37:16.280 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much
 
00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:18.040 align:start position:0%
representative P I'll have one question
 
00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
first uh in the last session in in
 
00:37:23.069 --> 00:37:23.079 align:start position:0%
previous sessions before that uh we've
 
00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
had much discussion regarding Civics
 
00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
we've had much discussion regarding
 
00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:28.589 align:start position:0%
we've had much discussion regarding
social

00:37:28.589 --> 00:37:28.599 align:start position:0%
social
 
00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
studies and we've also been told that
 
00:37:35.829 --> 00:37:35.839 align:start position:0%
often times social studies and Civics
 
00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:38.720 align:start position:0%
are put in the backseat of the car have
 
00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
you done any research here in regard to
 
00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:43.720 align:start position:0%
we see the 16% of 18-y olds are
 
00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
registered to vote have you done any
 
00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
research going back when social studies
 
00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:51.880 align:start position:0%
was given more emphasis that there was
 
00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:54.920 align:start position:0%
more of the 18-year-old bracket that was
 
00:37:56.670 --> 00:37:56.680 align:start position:0%
registering to vote is there been is is
 
00:37:59.069 --> 00:37:59.079 align:start position:0%
this a trend that's going down or did
 
00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
you do any historical backback research
 
00:38:03.790 --> 00:38:03.800 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a good question and I'll be
 
00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
frank in that I I don't know
 
00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:07.720 align:start position:0%
historically what the voter what those
 
00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:11.640 align:start position:0%
rates have been um My Hope and to your
 
00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:14.200 align:start position:0%
point your broader point about neglect
 
00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:16.720 align:start position:0%
in terms of civics and social uh studies
 
00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:18.200 align:start position:0%
and things like that that obviously has
 
00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
been going on I don't know there may be
 
00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:22.520 align:start position:0%
someone who can testified behind me that
 
00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
can speak to those um the contributing
 
00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
factor something like this might have to
 
00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
either keeping rates high or improving
 
00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
them but I don't know historically
 
00:38:35.390 --> 00:38:35.400 align:start position:0%
someone may on the committee thank very
 
00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:38.680 align:start position:0%
thank you other other representative
 
00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:40.680 align:start position:0%
cordelli uh thank you thank you
 
00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
representative um I believe I heard you
 
00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
mention that um this uh registration
 
00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
information was going on now so if
 
00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:51.839 align:start position:0%
that's the case why do we need this bill
 
00:38:53.309 --> 00:38:53.319 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a good question I don't know
 
00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
that it's going on in a Statewide basis
 
00:38:59.390 --> 00:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
my understand even in um um some of the
 
00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
communities that are near me and in mine
 
00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
that it's somewhat um sporadic it might
 
00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:07.720 align:start position:0%
be um we are in a primary season now so
 
00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:09.560 align:start position:0%
there's more attention which is a great
 
00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity uh for folks to sort of
 
00:39:15.710 --> 00:39:15.720 align:start position:0%
um gravitate toward the idea of voting
 
00:39:18.829 --> 00:39:18.839 align:start position:0%
and partic but in non-election years uh
 
00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
in less popular election years when we
 
00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:24.720 align:start position:0%
don't have the primary it's probably not
 
00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:27.800 align:start position:0%
um as standardized if you will or as
 
00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
across the board so I think what this
 
00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:31.400 align:start position:0%
would do is ensure that every
 
00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
18-year-old when you you turn 18 in high
 
00:39:35.589 --> 00:39:35.599 align:start position:0%
school whether it's a primary year or
 
00:39:38.069 --> 00:39:38.079 align:start position:0%
not whether you live in exitor or
 
00:39:41.109 --> 00:39:41.119 align:start position:0%
wherever you're going to have that that
 
00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:43.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do
 
00:39:46.349 --> 00:39:46.359 align:start position:0%
that you have a follow yeah thank you
 
00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
thank you just following up on your last
 
00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:50.720 align:start position:0%
comment there
 
00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
um it is the requirement now that the
 
00:39:58.190 --> 00:39:58.200 align:start position:0%
State Board of educ education provide
 
00:40:01.109 --> 00:40:01.119 align:start position:0%
election law information to every High
 
00:40:03.630 --> 00:40:03.640 align:start position:0%
School teacher to distribute to their
 
00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
students so isn't part of this a
 
00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:09.800 align:start position:0%
duplication of what's going on
 
00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
already um if you could point me to the
 
00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:16.240 align:start position:0%
RS is that in the rsas the okay it's
 
00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
okay it adds to that in the sense that
 
00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
it would also provide uh assistance and
 
00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:23.240 align:start position:0%
and filling it out and filing it and it
 
00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:30.640 align:start position:0%
no we're going to let somebody else uh
 
00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:32.109 align:start position:0%
no we're going to let somebody else uh
representative

00:40:32.109 --> 00:40:32.119 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
dry thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
coming in uh as a former fifth grade
 
00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
teacher are you aware of the kids
 
00:40:41.069 --> 00:40:41.079 align:start position:0%
Governor program in the
 
00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
state enough to be dangerous with that
 
00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:47.960 align:start position:0%
knowledge yes follow up um are you aware
 
00:40:49.829 --> 00:40:49.839 align:start position:0%
that tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock
 
00:40:52.349 --> 00:40:52.359 align:start position:0%
there'll be 300 fifth graders in rep
 
00:40:54.670 --> 00:40:54.680 align:start position:0%
Hall to watch the inauguration of a
 
00:40:56.550 --> 00:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
program that's been going on for quite a
 
00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
while so does that not say that it's the
 
00:41:02.109 --> 00:41:02.119 align:start position:0%
this is isn't this the idea of a
 
00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
creative Hands-On by you know learning
 
00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
by doing program that you're looking for
 
00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
that's already actually taking effect
 
00:41:12.069 --> 00:41:12.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:15.400 align:start position:0%
mandated well I think um I think this
 
00:41:17.589 --> 00:41:17.599 align:start position:0%
the Civics
 
00:41:20.589 --> 00:41:20.599 align:start position:0%
um I'm blanking on the group that I
 
00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
believe H where this the the governor's
 
00:41:24.829 --> 00:41:24.839 align:start position:0%
program is housed the student Governor
 
00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
program is housed uh puts that on I I
 
00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:31.960 align:start position:0%
think that it's certainly the example is
 
00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
certainly one where you know students we
 
00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:37.880 align:start position:0%
have every uh uh fourth grader come you
 
00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
know to to the to rep's Hall experience
 
00:41:42.670 --> 00:41:42.680 align:start position:0%
the state house which is a wonderful
 
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
anybody who's been there it's just it's
 
00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
just one of my favorite things of this
 
00:41:48.829 --> 00:41:48.839 align:start position:0%
job um it's a great experience so yeah I
 
00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:50.760 align:start position:0%
think those are those are examples of
 
00:41:54.670 --> 00:41:54.680 align:start position:0%
where we've been able to leverage things
 
00:41:57.550 --> 00:41:57.560 align:start position:0%
um you know respectfully it might be
 
00:41:59.510 --> 00:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
slightly different in the sense
 
00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
that um from fifth grade to when you
 
00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
become 18 and and engage there might be
 
00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
a lag in terms of of the connection um
 
00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
uh and and sort of maybe even making
 
00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
feel feeling like okay you have this
 
00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
sort of abstract notion I guess of the
 
00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:19.480 align:start position:0%
Reps hall and then there's the work
 
00:42:21.589 --> 00:42:21.599 align:start position:0%
which is the you know voting and
 
00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:23.160 align:start position:0%
registering and things like that which
 
00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
become a little bit more um
 
00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
you know experiential at that age so
 
00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
this might be a uh you know what this
 
00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
bill might do is ensure that every
 
00:42:36.309 --> 00:42:36.319 align:start position:0%
18-year-old has that same experience
 
00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:40.040 align:start position:0%
that you're describing um and and make
 
00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
sure that uh it continues along along
 
00:42:44.589 --> 00:42:44.599 align:start position:0%
the way so it's sort of a maybe it's a
 
00:42:46.750 --> 00:42:46.760 align:start position:0%
natural Continuum of that experience of
 
00:42:48.349 --> 00:42:48.359 align:start position:0%
going to the Govern 300 kids here or
 
00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:52.040 align:start position:0%
going to rep's Hall and then maybe folks
 
00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:53.480 align:start position:0%
teachers would be reminded reminded
 
00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:54.760 align:start position:0%
their students of when they visited
 
00:42:57.150 --> 00:42:57.160 align:start position:0%
rep's Hall uh uh you know this is kind
 
00:42:58.710 --> 00:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
of where you get to decide who gets to
 
00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:00.720 align:start position:0%
sit here or you get to run and and that
 
00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:01.800 align:start position:0%
sort of thing so I think it could be a
 
00:43:04.990 --> 00:43:05.000 align:start position:0%
natural extension across the board thank
 
00:43:06.549 --> 00:43:06.559 align:start position:0%
you representative beler and then
 
00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock yeah thank you
 
00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and if I may I do have two but
 
00:43:13.390 --> 00:43:13.400 align:start position:0%
I'll ask for a followup uh thank you for
 
00:43:17.829 --> 00:43:17.839 align:start position:0%
being here um so generally accepting
 
00:43:20.829 --> 00:43:20.839 align:start position:0%
certain disabilities we recognize that
 
00:43:23.109 --> 00:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
are reasonable to accommodate typically
 
00:43:25.109 --> 00:43:25.119 align:start position:0%
the institutions of the US and of New
 
00:43:27.549 --> 00:43:27.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are set up for people freely
 
00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
use but they're not typically brought
 
00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
directly to the people I think that's
 
00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:34.160 align:start position:0%
often seen as a form of fairness so my
 
00:43:35.829 --> 00:43:35.839 align:start position:0%
question is if we were to bring voter
 
00:43:38.069 --> 00:43:38.079 align:start position:0%
registration in the high schools do you
 
00:43:39.670 --> 00:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
think we should also bring it to other
 
00:43:43.150 --> 00:43:43.160 align:start position:0%
institutions such as the National Guard
 
00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
hospitals police Fire EMS even to
 
00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:47.440 align:start position:0%
people's private
 
00:43:49.870 --> 00:43:49.880 align:start position:0%
homes so I don't necessarily think that
 
00:43:52.190 --> 00:43:52.200 align:start position:0%
we're bringing the clerk to the school
 
00:43:56.510 --> 00:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
that's an idea that's suggested there um
 
00:43:59.230 --> 00:43:59.240 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's alerting students to the
 
00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:01.880 align:start position:0%
registration process and assisting them
 
00:44:04.349 --> 00:44:04.359 align:start position:0%
where where it might be need and and my
 
00:44:06.549 --> 00:44:06.559 align:start position:0%
understanding is that um you know this
 
00:44:09.750 --> 00:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
does happen uh both at the school level
 
00:44:11.710 --> 00:44:11.720 align:start position:0%
but also at some of the institutions you
 
00:44:17.790 --> 00:44:17.800 align:start position:0%
described U I think I want to say uh um
 
00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
uh various places where clerks in
 
00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
different towns and it differs town by
 
00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
Town um where clerks have actually been
 
00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:28.720 align:start position:0%
requested to go not necessarily schools
 
00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
and they go um So based on their work
 
00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
capacity and the decisions that they
 
00:44:35.790 --> 00:44:35.800 align:start position:0%
make at that level thank you if I may
 
00:44:38.109 --> 00:44:38.119 align:start position:0%
brief brief number two uh second
 
00:44:40.190 --> 00:44:40.200 align:start position:0%
question so the casting of a vote is
 
00:44:42.270 --> 00:44:42.280 align:start position:0%
generally considered an ultimate
 
00:44:45.470 --> 00:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
expression of free speech um of course
 
00:44:47.589 --> 00:44:47.599 align:start position:0%
Free Speech contains both the right to
 
00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
speak it also contains the right to
 
00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:50.829 align:start position:0%
speak it also contains the right to
remain

00:44:50.829 --> 00:44:50.839 align:start position:0%
remain
 
00:44:53.549 --> 00:44:53.559 align:start position:0%
silent so should we not therefore have
 
00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:56.240 align:start position:0%
concerns given the fallibility of people
 
00:44:58.190 --> 00:44:58.200 align:start position:0%
of government meddling in this process
 
00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:01.800 align:start position:0%
and the possible coercion or compulsion
 
00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:08.480 align:start position:0%
speech so so you know you you make a
 
00:45:10.349 --> 00:45:10.359 align:start position:0%
good point that you know Free Speech
 
00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
means the right to not say anything as
 
00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
well or not participate that's an
 
00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:18.880 align:start position:0%
exercise that we protect as we should um
 
00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:21.200 align:start position:0%
and I think a couple of points at least
 
00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:25.960 align:start position:0%
with relation to this bill is um it's
 
00:45:28.589 --> 00:45:28.599 align:start position:0%
pretty clear that this isn't part of a
 
00:45:30.670 --> 00:45:30.680 align:start position:0%
assignment or graded if a student wants
 
00:45:32.990 --> 00:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
to exercise that right to say I'm not
 
00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
going to participate by registering or
 
00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
voting or whatever um and you then that
 
00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:39.480 align:start position:0%
has to be
 
00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
respected and I think that
 
00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:44.720 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:45:47.470 --> 00:45:47.480 align:start position:0%
risk I I think this is where if you will
 
00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:49.000 align:start position:0%
for lack of a better term the market
 
00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
would if if if on the outside chance
 
00:45:54.670 --> 00:45:54.680 align:start position:0%
that that's that that someone would
 
00:45:56.470 --> 00:45:56.480 align:start position:0%
attempt to compel
 
00:46:01.230 --> 00:46:01.240 align:start position:0%
someone to to register to vote in a
 
00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:02.710 align:start position:0%
someone to to register to vote in a
certain

00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:02.720 align:start position:0%
certain
 
00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
way my belief is that the risk of that
 
00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:09.400 align:start position:0%
in terms of exposure is is pretty high
 
00:46:11.230 --> 00:46:11.240 align:start position:0%
and would be pretty
 
00:46:14.549 --> 00:46:14.559 align:start position:0%
quickly um addressed
 
00:46:17.870 --> 00:46:17.880 align:start position:0%
so I think it's a low chance that if if
 
00:46:22.829 --> 00:46:22.839 align:start position:0%
close to zero and um yeah so I take your
 
00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
point I think it's a
 
00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:26.800 align:start position:0%
fundamental right under our constitution
 
00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:28.640 align:start position:0%
if if you want to express your vote by
 
00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
not voting or then that's your right um
 
00:46:34.670 --> 00:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
and I think I'm pretty confident
 
00:46:37.390 --> 00:46:37.400 align:start position:0%
in the system as it stands now in terms
 
00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:39.640 align:start position:0%
of schools that if someone was to
 
00:46:41.829 --> 00:46:41.839 align:start position:0%
abridge that right that it would be
 
00:46:43.069 --> 00:46:43.079 align:start position:0%
called out pretty quickly and someone
 
00:46:45.390 --> 00:46:45.400 align:start position:0%
will probably lose their job in my view
 
00:46:47.829 --> 00:46:47.839 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Woodcock thank
 
00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
you chairman good morning how you doing
 
00:46:51.790 --> 00:46:51.800 align:start position:0%
good to see uh I appreciate the bill I I
 
00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:54.640 align:start position:0%
do have a question uh just one comment
 
00:46:57.270 --> 00:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
in the past the schools I have been in
 
00:46:59.589 --> 00:46:59.599 align:start position:0%
have done this voluntarily uh on a
 
00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
regular basis so my question is there is
 
00:47:04.589 --> 00:47:04.599 align:start position:0%
there anything that you're aware of
 
00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:06.400 align:start position:0%
maybe the Year may be aware of it either
 
00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:09.480 align:start position:0%
that would preclude any public schools
 
00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
or child schools any schools in New
 
00:47:12.829 --> 00:47:12.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from doing this now without
 
00:47:12.839 --> 00:47:14.230 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from doing this now without
this

00:47:14.230 --> 00:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:47:16.670 --> 00:47:16.680 align:start position:0%
bill I I I don't think anything would
 
00:47:19.990 --> 00:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
preclude them from doing it what sort of
 
00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
two things I'd say to that if I may and
 
00:47:23.790 --> 00:47:23.800 align:start position:0%
one is
 
00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
um I I think we would ree as elected
 
00:47:28.309 --> 00:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
officials in the importance of voting as
 
00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
a as a right and representative bel's
 
00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
point just talked about that I think in
 
00:47:35.870 --> 00:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
some ways um so I think given the
 
00:47:38.589 --> 00:47:38.599 align:start position:0%
elevated right that we're talking
 
00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:42.640 align:start position:0%
about um it probably requires in my view
 
00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
some standardization some ability so
 
00:47:47.109 --> 00:47:47.119 align:start position:0%
that's it's not in the ad hoc I mean I
 
00:47:49.069 --> 00:47:49.079 align:start position:0%
know in the high school in my town you
 
00:47:50.670 --> 00:47:50.680 align:start position:0%
know this year they're they're talking
 
00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:52.680 align:start position:0%
about doing it only because of the
 
00:47:55.349 --> 00:47:55.359 align:start position:0%
primary and so some 18-year-old who left
 
00:47:57.950 --> 00:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
last year didn't didn't have it and and
 
00:48:00.109 --> 00:48:00.119 align:start position:0%
that my view is fundamentally unfair
 
00:48:01.870 --> 00:48:01.880 align:start position:0%
whether it's an exor or Conway or
 
00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
wherever um uh so so so no and I think
 
00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
this is one of those things we you know
 
00:48:08.790 --> 00:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
there's nothing prohibiting a school
 
00:48:12.510 --> 00:48:12.520 align:start position:0%
from offering quilting um but there's a
 
00:48:13.950 --> 00:48:13.960 align:start position:0%
difference between quilting and voting
 
00:48:16.309 --> 00:48:16.319 align:start position:0%
in my view in terms of what the what we
 
00:48:17.470 --> 00:48:17.480 align:start position:0%
want to emphasize so I think we'd want
 
00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we could um spread it
 
00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
spread the wealth I guess yeah what yeah
 
00:48:26.349 --> 00:48:26.359 align:start position:0%
sure okay just just to be clear C in in
 
00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
following representative bel's point
 
00:48:31.549 --> 00:48:31.559 align:start position:0%
this bill does not require I read it do
 
00:48:33.870 --> 00:48:33.880 align:start position:0%
not require students to write a stuff
 
00:48:36.349 --> 00:48:36.359 align:start position:0%
all this bill does is promate policiy in
 
00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
the school to opportunity to do that is
 
00:48:39.829 --> 00:48:39.839 align:start position:0%
that correct that's exactly right and
 
00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:41.640 align:start position:0%
some yes that's exactly right thank you
 
00:48:44.109 --> 00:48:44.119 align:start position:0%
Mr chair representative Hall thank you
 
00:48:46.270 --> 00:48:46.280 align:start position:0%
have a question thank you Mr speaker
 
00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:47.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
00:48:49.870 --> 00:48:49.880 align:start position:0%
question I'm just curious do we know how
 
00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
many what percentage of seniors are 18
 
00:48:55.150 --> 00:48:55.160 align:start position:0%
by the time they graduate you know I'm
 
00:48:56.829 --> 00:48:56.839 align:start position:0%
thinking if you do this in the fall
 
00:48:59.230 --> 00:48:59.240 align:start position:0%
there are not many yeah not many 18 year
 
00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
olds yeah at that that's a that's a good
 
00:49:03.589 --> 00:49:03.599 align:start position:0%
question I know my senior is it won't be
 
00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
18 till June um and so but you can
 
00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
register you can register to vote uh
 
00:49:11.789 --> 00:49:11.799 align:start position:0%
when when you're going to turn 18 on the
 
00:49:11.799 --> 00:49:12.630 align:start position:0%
when when you're going to turn 18 on the
next

00:49:12.630 --> 00:49:12.640 align:start position:0%
next
 
00:49:15.390 --> 00:49:15.400 align:start position:0%
election um my suspicion is that's
 
00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
something that at the school level
 
00:49:19.549 --> 00:49:19.559 align:start position:0%
they'll have a good hand of the timing
 
00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
of it and if someone runs one in the
 
00:49:22.589 --> 00:49:22.599 align:start position:0%
fall they might say well we had six you
 
00:49:24.390 --> 00:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
know but we've got eight 80 that could
 
00:49:27.150 --> 00:49:27.160 align:start position:0%
be in June so may I don't know I don't
 
00:49:29.030 --> 00:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
know the exact number to be blunt about
 
00:49:31.109 --> 00:49:31.119 align:start position:0%
that um but I take your point absolutely
 
00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representa cascaden
 
00:49:35.829 --> 00:49:35.839 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:49:38.430 --> 00:49:38.440 align:start position:0%
my question more of a clarification in
 
00:49:41.150 --> 00:49:41.160 align:start position:0%
the language and the bill this I presume
 
00:49:43.670 --> 00:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
is intended also for Charter
 
00:49:47.109 --> 00:49:47.119 align:start position:0%
Schools yes the Civics yes exactly so I
 
00:49:49.870 --> 00:49:49.880 align:start position:0%
would just recommend um on line three
 
00:49:51.789 --> 00:49:51.799 align:start position:0%
that that be
 
00:49:53.910 --> 00:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
clarified because a charter is not
 
00:49:57.789 --> 00:49:57.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:59.829 --> 00:49:59.839 align:start position:0%
and not necessarily private now I don't
 
00:50:01.270 --> 00:50:01.280 align:start position:0%
have the
 
00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
yep it's it's the language yes thank you
 
00:50:06.750 --> 00:50:06.760 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you
 
00:50:09.829 --> 00:50:09.839 align:start position:0%
yeah yep that's a good point any further
 
00:50:11.710 --> 00:50:11.720 align:start position:0%
questions so we have five other people
 
00:50:13.990 --> 00:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
wanting to speak here yes representa
 
00:50:16.109 --> 00:50:16.119 align:start position:0%
Noble thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um on line eight
 
00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
of the bill it says providing access to
 
00:50:24.589 --> 00:50:24.599 align:start position:0%
and assistance with filing registration
 
00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:27.240 align:start position:0%
applications can you give me an example
 
00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
of what that would look like in the
 
00:50:31.710 --> 00:50:31.720 align:start position:0%
classroom uh I think it if I think it
 
00:50:34.150 --> 00:50:34.160 align:start position:0%
could be on the this this bill provides
 
00:50:36.829 --> 00:50:36.839 align:start position:0%
to I think represent W wood Cox point a
 
00:50:38.870 --> 00:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
provides a floor not a ceiling so I
 
00:50:41.829 --> 00:50:41.839 align:start position:0%
think assistance could be you know
 
00:50:44.670 --> 00:50:44.680 align:start position:0%
um uh this is the form you put in your
 
00:50:46.069 --> 00:50:46.079 align:start position:0%
name your address whatever the
 
00:50:48.789 --> 00:50:48.799 align:start position:0%
information is here's the here's the the
 
00:50:51.349 --> 00:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
your town clerk is open on Tuesdays 2 to
 
00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
6 where some them have you know
 
00:50:56.109 --> 00:50:56.119 align:start position:0%
different hours um you would want to
 
00:50:57.670 --> 00:50:57.680 align:start position:0%
that's when you'll have to file it that
 
00:51:00.349 --> 00:51:00.359 align:start position:0%
could be the sort of the bottom of it
 
00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
but I would leave that up to the
 
00:51:03.750 --> 00:51:03.760 align:start position:0%
Educators in the building to sort of
 
00:51:05.109 --> 00:51:05.119 align:start position:0%
figure out what the
 
00:51:08.349 --> 00:51:08.359 align:start position:0%
best they know I
 
00:51:08.359 --> 00:51:10.030 align:start position:0%
best they know I
don't

00:51:10.030 --> 00:51:10.040 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:51:13.309 --> 00:51:13.319 align:start position:0%
yes and when they get to the section
 
00:51:14.549 --> 00:51:14.559 align:start position:0%
where you need to fill in what your
 
00:51:19.069 --> 00:51:19.079 align:start position:0%
party is how how are we going to direct
 
00:51:21.630 --> 00:51:21.640 align:start position:0%
the students in that way I think there
 
00:51:25.390 --> 00:51:25.400 align:start position:0%
are pretty good guidelines about um
 
00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:27.480 align:start position:0%
teachers there there isn't there isn't
 
00:51:28.750 --> 00:51:28.760 align:start position:0%
first of all there there isn't that
 
00:51:31.309 --> 00:51:31.319 align:start position:0%
would that would go into the territory
 
00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:34.440 align:start position:0%
that would be prohibited um and I think
 
00:51:37.109 --> 00:51:37.119 align:start position:0%
um you know that's part of I think
 
00:51:41.230 --> 00:51:41.240 align:start position:0%
teachers are pretty right now pretty um
 
00:51:45.990 --> 00:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
cautious about uh their political views
 
00:51:47.870 --> 00:51:47.880 align:start position:0%
um and and if that's the
 
00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
question I don't I don't think that I
 
00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
don't see that playing a
 
00:51:55.789 --> 00:51:55.799 align:start position:0%
role okay thank you very much much uh
 
00:51:57.910 --> 00:51:57.920 align:start position:0%

me speak before
 
00:52:24.309 --> 00:52:24.319 align:start position:0%
you you have before you a bill that is
 
00:52:27.390 --> 00:52:27.400 align:start position:0%
eminently sensible and appropriate given
 
00:52:30.549 --> 00:52:30.559 align:start position:0%
that we are citizens of a representative
 
00:52:32.710 --> 00:52:32.720 align:start position:0%
democracy House Bill
 
00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
1014 concretely states that each school
 
00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
district and private high school shall
 
00:52:40.349 --> 00:52:40.359 align:start position:0%
adopt policies to promote student voter
 
00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
registration the bill suggests ways that
 
00:52:44.990 --> 00:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
such promotion of student voter
 
00:52:47.589 --> 00:52:47.599 align:start position:0%
registration might be accomplished
 
00:52:50.349 --> 00:52:50.359 align:start position:0%
requiring only that students be informed
 
00:52:52.430 --> 00:52:52.440 align:start position:0%
of state requirements for voter
 
00:52:54.750 --> 00:52:54.760 align:start position:0%

registration
 
00:53:02.990 --> 00:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
applications the sponsors of this bill
 
00:53:05.430 --> 00:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
wisely recognize that though there may
 
00:53:07.750 --> 00:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
be B many school districts which
 
00:53:10.190 --> 00:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
adequately promote student voter
 
00:53:12.549 --> 00:53:12.559 align:start position:0%
registration there may be districts
 
00:53:13.589 --> 00:53:13.599 align:start position:0%
which do
 
00:53:16.230 --> 00:53:16.240 align:start position:0%
not rather than leave such a critical
 
00:53:19.390 --> 00:53:19.400 align:start position:0%
civic responsibility to Chance House

schools
 
00:53:28.630 --> 00:53:28.640 align:start position:0%
this bill recognizes as Thomas Jefferson
 
00:53:32.030 --> 00:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
did that democracies must educate young
 
00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
citizens to understand what a democracy
 
00:53:38.829 --> 00:53:38.839 align:start position:0%
is and what role they must actively play
 
00:53:41.950 --> 00:53:41.960 align:start position:0%
in it if our democracy is to survive
 
00:53:45.230 --> 00:53:45.240 align:start position:0%
indeed last year the legislature passed
 
00:53:48.190 --> 00:53:48.200 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 216 which calls for an
 
00:53:50.870 --> 00:53:50.880 align:start position:0%

hadock or granny d as she was widely
 
00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:12.880 align:start position:0%

00:55:49.789 --> 00:55:49.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:52.069 --> 00:55:52.079 align:start position:0%
Horgan oh thank you much Mr chair I'm
 
00:55:54.029 --> 00:55:54.039 align:start position:0%
resident Timothy Horgan from straford
 
00:55:55.349 --> 00:55:55.359 align:start position:0%
County District 10 with which is the
 
00:55:59.710 --> 00:55:59.720 align:start position:0%
town of Durham um the uh which is uh the
 
00:56:01.390 --> 00:56:01.400 align:start position:0%
home of the University of New Hampshire
 
00:56:04.510 --> 00:56:04.520 align:start position:0%
um there's the main reason why this bill
 
00:56:06.150 --> 00:56:06.160 align:start position:0%
is good is well it underlines the
 
00:56:07.910 --> 00:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
importance of voting regards the way you
 
00:56:10.190 --> 00:56:10.200 align:start position:0%
call yourselves a democracy or or a
 
00:56:12.710 --> 00:56:12.720 align:start position:0%
constitutional republic um regardless of
 
00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
which word you use um it's the citizen
 
00:56:17.549 --> 00:56:17.559 align:start position:0%
you know the government like is you know
 
00:56:19.549 --> 00:56:19.559 align:start position:0%
the citizens the people so you know and
 
00:56:21.430 --> 00:56:21.440 align:start position:0%
I there was a question about like the
 
00:56:22.750 --> 00:56:22.760 align:start position:0%
government compelling speech and I
 
00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
understood the concern but the
 
00:56:26.069 --> 00:56:26.079 align:start position:0%
government is not really
 
00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:28.240 align:start position:0%
Force that's separate from the people
 
00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
but um so I think this encourages young
 
00:56:34.789 --> 00:56:34.799 align:start position:0%
people to vote it uh so you 18 you know
 
00:56:36.029 --> 00:56:36.039 align:start position:0%
like when you're 18 years old that's
 
00:56:37.470 --> 00:56:37.480 align:start position:0%
when a lot of your lifetime habits are
 
00:56:39.109 --> 00:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
formed so if you register to vote you'll
 
00:56:40.950 --> 00:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
get in the habit of voting and uh you'll
 
00:56:44.349 --> 00:56:44.359 align:start position:0%
continue voting uh to your old as me or
 
00:56:46.750 --> 00:56:46.760 align:start position:0%
even older as some members of the uh
 
00:56:49.190 --> 00:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
committee uh may be although I find that
 
00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
hard to believe so um I think this is a
 
00:56:55.390 --> 00:56:55.400 align:start position:0%
very uh very simple Bill the schools um
 
00:56:58.069 --> 00:56:58.079 align:start position:0%
should already be doing it um and the
 
00:56:59.510 --> 00:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
comment about the chartered public
 
00:57:01.270 --> 00:57:01.280 align:start position:0%
schools that uh that's a common problem
 
00:57:03.230 --> 00:57:03.240 align:start position:0%
these education bill so that's probably
 
00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
a simple Amendment with the private high
 
00:57:07.430 --> 00:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
schools there may be some religious
 
00:57:09.270 --> 00:57:09.280 align:start position:0%
groups who operate private high schools
 
00:57:11.950 --> 00:57:11.960 align:start position:0%
who don't believe in voting but um I
 
00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
don't know how many of them there are
 
00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:15.680 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire so
 
00:57:17.950 --> 00:57:17.960 align:start position:0%
probably probably we should uh probably
 
00:57:19.589 --> 00:57:19.599 align:start position:0%
should leave that alone for now and if
 
00:57:22.710 --> 00:57:22.720 align:start position:0%
it's if it's an issue it'll be uh the
 
00:57:24.109 --> 00:57:24.119 align:start position:0%
first comes the where we can pass the
 
00:57:25.829 --> 00:57:25.839 align:start position:0%
bill and somebody can challenge it and
 
00:57:28.270 --> 00:57:28.280 align:start position:0%
probably U they would have the right not
 
00:57:30.750 --> 00:57:30.760 align:start position:0%
to register their uh register their
 
00:57:32.829 --> 00:57:32.839 align:start position:0%
students on on religious grounds so I
 
00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
think this is a I think this is a good
 
00:57:36.430 --> 00:57:36.440 align:start position:0%
bill and you should put it the charter
 
00:57:39.510 --> 00:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
schools and pass it and um so I look
 
00:57:40.990 --> 00:57:41.000 align:start position:0%
forward to voting for it on the floor
 
00:57:42.789 --> 00:57:42.799 align:start position:0%
hopefully uh hopefully at the next
 
00:57:45.190 --> 00:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
hopefully at the next session day so um
 
00:57:47.630 --> 00:57:47.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you are there
 
00:57:50.390 --> 00:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
any questions for the representative no
 
00:57:52.950 --> 00:57:52.960 align:start position:0%
not seeing it thank you very much I'd
 
00:57:55.870 --> 00:57:55.880 align:start position:0%

00:57:57.880 --> 00:58:03.589 align:start position:0%
open
democracy

00:58:03.589 --> 00:58:03.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:05.870 --> 00:58:05.880 align:start position:0%
yes good morning chairman lad and
 
00:58:07.589 --> 00:58:07.599 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um my name is
 
00:58:09.470 --> 00:58:09.480 align:start position:0%
Olivia zinc I'm a voter in Franklin New
 
00:58:11.069 --> 00:58:11.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the executive director of
 
00:58:13.029 --> 00:58:13.039 align:start position:0%
open democracy we're a nonpartisan
 
00:58:15.950 --> 00:58:15.960 align:start position:0%
nonprofit that represents about 36,000
 
00:58:19.710 --> 00:58:19.720 align:start position:0%
voters um we um I'm submitting testimony
 
00:58:22.470 --> 00:58:22.480 align:start position:0%
in favor of this bill I think it's very
 
00:58:25.270 --> 00:58:25.280 align:start position:0%
important um that school districts
 
00:58:29.670 --> 00:58:29.680 align:start position:0%
um give students um education about uh
 
00:58:32.589 --> 00:58:32.599 align:start position:0%
registering to vote you'll see that I um
 
00:58:35.190 --> 00:58:35.200 align:start position:0%
I'm passing around this report that was
 
00:58:37.990 --> 00:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
done um by the Civic Center that show
 
00:58:40.630 --> 00:58:40.640 align:start position:0%
15.6% of 18y olds in New Hampshire are
 
00:58:42.589 --> 00:58:42.599 align:start position:0%
registered to vote when you look at the
 
00:58:44.670 --> 00:58:44.680 align:start position:0%
school districts on the left-hand column
 
00:58:47.109 --> 00:58:47.119 align:start position:0%
that have higher percentages it's
 
00:58:49.910 --> 00:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
because Bedford um supervisor of the
 
00:58:51.750 --> 00:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
checklist goes to the high school and
 
00:58:53.750 --> 00:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
registers uh folks to vote the Keen
 
00:58:55.589 --> 00:58:55.599 align:start position:0%
clerk goes to the high school and
 
00:58:58.069 --> 00:58:58.079 align:start position:0%
registers um so the communities that are
 
00:59:00.589 --> 00:59:00.599 align:start position:0%
higher than that conquer did a drive uh
 
00:59:03.430 --> 00:59:03.440 align:start position:0%
I know that the uh uh hopkington
 
00:59:05.230 --> 00:59:05.240 align:start position:0%
supervisor of the checklist will go to
 
00:59:06.990 --> 00:59:07.000 align:start position:0%
the high school if requested and
 
00:59:09.630 --> 00:59:09.640 align:start position:0%
register students to vote to to other
 
00:59:12.029 --> 00:59:12.039 align:start position:0%
questions that have come up um Town
 
00:59:13.829 --> 00:59:13.839 align:start position:0%
clerks and supervisors of the checklist
 
00:59:15.870 --> 00:59:15.880 align:start position:0%
go to nursing homes go to other places
 
00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
to register to vote but right now
 
00:59:19.589 --> 00:59:19.599 align:start position:0%
there's about a dozen high schools
 
00:59:21.510 --> 00:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
across the state that are registering
 
00:59:24.270 --> 00:59:24.280 align:start position:0%
that that do do this kind of work and I
 
00:59:26.589 --> 00:59:26.599 align:start position:0%
think it's important that all students
 
00:59:28.990 --> 00:59:29.000 align:start position:0%
across the state have the opportunity to
 
00:59:30.750 --> 00:59:30.760 align:start position:0%
know how to fill out their applications
 
00:59:33.270 --> 00:59:33.280 align:start position:0%
to register to vote um and I know there
 
00:59:35.829 --> 00:59:35.839 align:start position:0%
was a question raised earlier um in that
 
00:59:38.950 --> 00:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
box you can put Republican Democrat or
 
00:59:40.670 --> 00:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
Undeclared those are the three choices
 
00:59:42.750 --> 00:59:42.760 align:start position:0%
of what parties you can put in the box
 
00:59:44.470 --> 00:59:44.480 align:start position:0%
and many times supervisors of the
 
00:59:47.349 --> 00:59:47.359 align:start position:0%
checklist or uh Town clerks do tell
 
00:59:48.870 --> 00:59:48.880 align:start position:0%
people those are the three things that
 
00:59:51.230 --> 00:59:51.240 align:start position:0%
you can put in those in the Box about
 
00:59:54.190 --> 00:59:54.200 align:start position:0%
which parties to register um I know uh
 
00:59:57.109 --> 00:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
when KET had a voter registration Drive
 
01:00:00.109 --> 01:00:00.119 align:start position:0%
um former state senator Nancy Styles is
 
01:00:02.750 --> 01:00:02.760 align:start position:0%
the uh supervisor the checklist and and
 
01:00:04.270 --> 01:00:04.280 align:start position:0%
the majority of the students registered
 
01:00:06.670 --> 01:00:06.680 align:start position:0%
as Undeclared so um that was a
 
01:00:08.470 --> 01:00:08.480 align:start position:0%
conversation and students registered
 
01:00:10.390 --> 01:00:10.400 align:start position:0%
Undeclared or they can pick a party if
 
01:00:12.390 --> 01:00:12.400 align:start position:0%
they choose to so I think that that's a
 
01:00:14.589 --> 01:00:14.599 align:start position:0%
simple instruction um I also have
 
01:00:16.549 --> 01:00:16.559 align:start position:0%
testimony from representative former
 
01:00:18.430 --> 01:00:18.440 align:start position:0%
Representative Bob Perry who was unable
 
01:00:19.990 --> 01:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
to be here but I passed that around so
 
01:00:21.390 --> 01:00:21.400 align:start position:0%
if you have questions you can read his
 
01:00:23.190 --> 01:00:23.200 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you thank you very much
 
01:00:27.230 --> 01:00:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:30.670 --> 01:00:30.680 align:start position:0%
yes represent p no thank you Mr chair
 
01:00:33.069 --> 01:00:33.079 align:start position:0%
and thank you for being here you
 
01:00:34.549 --> 01:00:34.559 align:start position:0%
mentioned several schools that already
 
01:00:38.390 --> 01:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
do this so I'm kind of concerned why we
 
01:00:40.349 --> 01:00:40.359 align:start position:0%
need this legislation if there's nothing
 
01:00:42.950 --> 01:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
in current state law that would prevent
 
01:00:44.789 --> 01:00:44.799 align:start position:0%
a supervisor of the checklist from going
 
01:00:46.750 --> 01:00:46.760 align:start position:0%
into the school and registering students
 
01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
to vote I will say that this happens in
 
01:00:51.309 --> 01:00:51.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire based on a student's
 
01:00:53.549 --> 01:00:53.559 align:start position:0%
interest so in lonia three years ago
 
01:00:57.470 --> 01:00:57.480 align:start position:0%
Ella um um a student wanted to run a
 
01:00:59.910 --> 01:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
voter registration Drive the lonia high
 
01:01:01.309 --> 01:01:01.319 align:start position:0%
school had one three years ago but
 
01:01:04.750 --> 01:01:04.760 align:start position:0%
haven't had one since um in Portsmouth
 
01:01:06.789 --> 01:01:06.799 align:start position:0%
the junior class sponsors the drive for
 
01:01:09.309 --> 01:01:09.319 align:start position:0%
the senior class it was really done by a
 
01:01:12.029 --> 01:01:12.039 align:start position:0%
parent uh of a senior who wanted this to
 
01:01:14.710 --> 01:01:14.720 align:start position:0%
happen so it's very it's done Community
 
01:01:16.829 --> 01:01:16.839 align:start position:0%
by community in a very localized way
 
01:01:20.349 --> 01:01:20.359 align:start position:0%
based on it really takes students who
 
01:01:22.029 --> 01:01:22.039 align:start position:0%
want to educate other students about how
 
01:01:23.789 --> 01:01:23.799 align:start position:0%
to register to vote teachers willing to
 
01:01:25.990 --> 01:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
partner School school districts and
 
01:01:27.670 --> 01:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist or town
 
01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
clerks and there is no uniform require
 
01:01:33.029 --> 01:01:33.039 align:start position:0%
you know it's not happening state by
 
01:01:36.390 --> 01:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
state so it is UN in my opinion all New
 
01:01:37.589 --> 01:01:37.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire students should have the
 
01:01:40.069 --> 01:01:40.079 align:start position:0%
ability to learn how to register to vote
 
01:01:42.589 --> 01:01:42.599 align:start position:0%
and it shouldn't just be based on the
 
01:01:44.789 --> 01:01:44.799 align:start position:0%
energy in one school or another that
 
01:01:47.630 --> 01:01:47.640 align:start position:0%
there should be a this this legislation
 
01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:56.829 --> 01:01:56.839 align:start position:0%
policies do we need an RSA to promotee
 
01:01:58.269 --> 01:01:58.279 align:start position:0%
that policy or could that be done
 
01:01:59.950 --> 01:01:59.960 align:start position:0%
through an organization such as yours
 
01:02:03.150 --> 01:02:03.160 align:start position:0%
going into the schools to work with the
 
01:02:06.069 --> 01:02:06.079 align:start position:0%
the classroom teachers the the Civics
 
01:02:08.150 --> 01:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
teachers the social studies teachers in
 
01:02:10.150 --> 01:02:10.160 align:start position:0%
order to create that sort of momentum
 
01:02:13.470 --> 01:02:13.480 align:start position:0%
does it have to come through state law I
 
01:02:15.069 --> 01:02:15.079 align:start position:0%
will say our organization has worked on
 
01:02:16.430 --> 01:02:16.440 align:start position:0%
this for three years and we have only
 
01:02:18.549 --> 01:02:18.559 align:start position:0%
had a dozen school districts so there
 
01:02:20.510 --> 01:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
could be organizations like open
 
01:02:22.549 --> 01:02:22.559 align:start position:0%
democracy and the new and Civic Center
 
01:02:24.109 --> 01:02:24.119 align:start position:0%
and other organizations that promote
 
01:02:27.269 --> 01:02:27.279 align:start position:0%
this but I think um that is just you
 
01:02:30.670 --> 01:02:30.680 align:start position:0%
know that's just we're if we had
 
01:02:32.190 --> 01:02:32.200 align:start position:0%
something that required all school
 
01:02:34.750 --> 01:02:34.760 align:start position:0%
districts to adopt a policy I think that
 
01:02:38.470 --> 01:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
that would actually help promote this um
 
01:02:40.470 --> 01:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
instead of just School District by a
 
01:02:41.870 --> 01:02:41.880 align:start position:0%
school district so that the Bedford
 
01:02:43.910 --> 01:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
school district has it the and some
 
01:02:45.789 --> 01:02:45.799 align:start position:0%
other school districts have it but the
 
01:02:48.109 --> 01:02:48.119 align:start position:0%
kids in Peterboro and conal District
 
01:02:50.349 --> 01:02:50.359 align:start position:0%
don't aren't able to register to vote uh
 
01:02:52.990 --> 01:02:53.000 align:start position:0%
because they don't have um a supervisor
 
01:02:54.910 --> 01:02:54.920 align:start position:0%
the checklist coming to their school or
 
01:02:57.549 --> 01:02:57.559 align:start position:0%
or doing other other things and I think
 
01:03:00.549 --> 01:03:00.559 align:start position:0%
you know the charter school in Dairy
 
01:03:02.109 --> 01:03:02.119 align:start position:0%
came to the town they did a field trip
 
01:03:04.829 --> 01:03:04.839 align:start position:0%
to the town clerk two years ago and and
 
01:03:06.670 --> 01:03:06.680 align:start position:0%
then the town clerk said oh maybe we
 
01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
should go to the charter school next
 
01:03:10.510 --> 01:03:10.520 align:start position:0%
year instead of having 40 people show up
 
01:03:12.109 --> 01:03:12.119 align:start position:0%
40 students show up in our lobby and I
 
01:03:13.710 --> 01:03:13.720 align:start position:0%
think sort of figuring out what that
 
01:03:16.349 --> 01:03:16.359 align:start position:0%
means I live in the city of Franklin the
 
01:03:18.349 --> 01:03:18.359 align:start position:0%
high school is walking distance to the
 
01:03:20.109 --> 01:03:20.119 align:start position:0%
town clerk's office so they do a walking
 
01:03:22.710 --> 01:03:22.720 align:start position:0%
field trip um to the town clerk's office
 
01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
so I think it can happen differently um
 
01:03:26.750 --> 01:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
in different school districts but I
 
01:03:29.069 --> 01:03:29.079 align:start position:0%
think it there should be some incentive
 
01:03:30.789 --> 01:03:30.799 align:start position:0%
for all school districts to be
 
01:03:33.069 --> 01:03:33.079 align:start position:0%
participating um so that all high school
 
01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
kids have this opportunity to learn how
 
01:03:38.870 --> 01:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
to register to vote thank you uh
 
01:03:41.589 --> 01:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
representa Woodcock thank you hi good
 
01:03:45.190 --> 01:03:45.200 align:start position:0%
afternoon good morning anyhow um looking
 
01:03:46.670 --> 01:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
at your statistics on your your blue
 
01:03:48.589 --> 01:03:48.599 align:start position:0%
sheet uh you don't have to look at them
 
01:03:51.190 --> 01:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
uh do you have any can you give us a
 
01:03:52.950 --> 01:03:52.960 align:start position:0%
guesstimation or something close to
 
01:03:55.029 --> 01:03:55.039 align:start position:0%
guesstimation of what it is National Al
 
01:03:56.910 --> 01:03:56.920 align:start position:0%
the younger the percentage registration
 
01:03:59.269 --> 01:03:59.279 align:start position:0%
for 18y olds I didn't see it in St um
 
01:04:02.029 --> 01:04:02.039 align:start position:0%
26% Nationwide of 18 year olds are
 
01:04:03.589 --> 01:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
registered to vote according to the
 
01:04:05.630 --> 01:04:05.640 align:start position:0%
Civic Center data um it's a different
 
01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
report but I do have a okay great thank
 
01:04:10.230 --> 01:04:10.240 align:start position:0%
you thank you m so we are we are lower
 
01:04:12.269 --> 01:04:12.279 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire than other stes good
 
01:04:14.390 --> 01:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
thank you are there further questions
 
01:04:17.029 --> 01:04:17.039 align:start position:0%
repent Luna thank you very much Mr chair
 
01:04:19.109 --> 01:04:19.119 align:start position:0%
and thanks thanks very much Olivia for
 
01:04:21.269 --> 01:04:21.279 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I was wonder
 
01:04:23.150 --> 01:04:23.160 align:start position:0%
if you could talk with us a little bit
 
01:04:26.309 --> 01:04:26.319 align:start position:0%
about um obstacles that students might
 
01:04:29.349 --> 01:04:29.359 align:start position:0%
face in order to successfully um you
 
01:04:31.390 --> 01:04:31.400 align:start position:0%
know register to
 
01:04:33.789 --> 01:04:33.799 align:start position:0%
vote um I think well first of all
 
01:04:37.230 --> 01:04:37.240 align:start position:0%
students have to produce their um
 
01:04:40.470 --> 01:04:40.480 align:start position:0%
original birth certificate their uh
 
01:04:41.950 --> 01:04:41.960 align:start position:0%
something that proves citizenship so
 
01:04:43.109 --> 01:04:43.119 align:start position:0%
that could be their original birth
 
01:04:45.789 --> 01:04:45.799 align:start position:0%
certificate a driver's license they have
 
01:04:48.950 --> 01:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
to prove identity age citizenship and
 
01:04:52.109 --> 01:04:52.119 align:start position:0%
domicile and many students may not have
 
01:04:53.829 --> 01:04:53.839 align:start position:0%
utility bills in their own name they
 
01:04:55.109 --> 01:04:55.119 align:start position:0%
might have a cell phone in their own
 
01:04:56.789 --> 01:04:56.799 align:start position:0%
name with their address so that could be
 
01:04:58.789 --> 01:04:58.799 align:start position:0%
used um they might have a car
 
01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:01.240 align:start position:0%
registration um we are seeing the number
 
01:05:04.390 --> 01:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
of 18yar olds um that have driver's
 
01:05:09.230 --> 01:05:09.240 align:start position:0%
license reduced Nationwide um so uh 20
 
01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
years ago the majority of 18-year-olds
 
01:05:13.109 --> 01:05:13.119 align:start position:0%
had driver's license and you're seeing
 
01:05:16.269 --> 01:05:16.279 align:start position:0%
that number closer to 60% according to
 
01:05:21.510 --> 01:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
um a a the automat I forget which it's
 
01:05:25.950 --> 01:05:25.960 align:start position:0%
the AAA the uh autom IC I forget the I
 
01:05:27.430 --> 01:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
can find that
 
01:05:32.109 --> 01:05:32.119 align:start position:0%
statistic thank you that Association um
 
01:05:34.390 --> 01:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
but I do think that um if they don't
 
01:05:36.230 --> 01:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
have those documents they can sign an
 
01:05:38.710 --> 01:05:38.720 align:start position:0%
affidavit um but many students will not
 
01:05:41.630 --> 01:05:41.640 align:start position:0%
know that um and also many students
 
01:05:43.470 --> 01:05:43.480 align:start position:0%
don't realize that they can register to
 
01:05:47.150 --> 01:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
vote if they're 17 and they'll turn 18
 
01:05:49.990 --> 01:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
before the next election and so if I I
 
01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
recommend students do drives in in June
 
01:05:54.390 --> 01:05:54.400 align:start position:0%
because you have the majority of senior
 
01:05:58.430 --> 01:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
that have um drives that are 18 in June
 
01:06:00.750 --> 01:06:00.760 align:start position:0%
um but then by June they most of them
 
01:06:02.990 --> 01:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
will be 18 by the next election so I
 
01:06:06.470 --> 01:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
think that um uh we call it cap gown and
 
01:06:09.069 --> 01:06:09.079 align:start position:0%
ballot project so uh when students are
 
01:06:10.910 --> 01:06:10.920 align:start position:0%
picking up their cap and gown it's a
 
01:06:13.390 --> 01:06:13.400 align:start position:0%
great time to invite those those high
 
01:06:15.990 --> 01:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
school students to to also invite the
 
01:06:19.390 --> 01:06:19.400 align:start position:0%
town clerk or um have uh supervisor
 
01:06:22.990 --> 01:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
checklist there to to fill out those
 
01:06:26.190 --> 01:06:26.200 align:start position:0%
forms very quick fall thank you um and I
 
01:06:27.789 --> 01:06:27.799 align:start position:0%
I was actually really getting at trying
 
01:06:30.069 --> 01:06:30.079 align:start position:0%
to get at uh and thanks for that answer
 
01:06:32.349 --> 01:06:32.359 align:start position:0%
I think that that brings a lot with it
 
01:06:34.069 --> 01:06:34.079 align:start position:0%
but really looking at underserved
 
01:06:35.589 --> 01:06:35.599 align:start position:0%
populations that may have challenges
 
01:06:38.109 --> 01:06:38.119 align:start position:0%
with transportation and things like that
 
01:06:40.670 --> 01:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
and and how this may help to overcome
 
01:06:44.190 --> 01:06:44.200 align:start position:0%
some of those um uh structural um uh
 
01:06:46.510 --> 01:06:46.520 align:start position:0%
obstacles that um that certain students
 
01:06:50.109 --> 01:06:50.119 align:start position:0%
might have to participating in
 
01:06:52.670 --> 01:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
democracy yeah thank you thank you for
 
01:06:54.589 --> 01:06:54.599 align:start position:0%
that question and I do think
 
01:06:56.789 --> 01:06:56.799 align:start position:0%
um having this information available at
 
01:06:59.710 --> 01:06:59.720 align:start position:0%
school it gives a foundation you know
 
01:07:02.109 --> 01:07:02.119 align:start position:0%
only 60% of New Hampshire kids go on to
 
01:07:03.150 --> 01:07:03.160 align:start position:0%
college so if they're getting
 
01:07:04.510 --> 01:07:04.520 align:start position:0%
information about how to register to
 
01:07:06.549 --> 01:07:06.559 align:start position:0%
vote at College you're missing 40% of
 
01:07:08.750 --> 01:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
that population but I also think there
 
01:07:12.069 --> 01:07:12.079 align:start position:0%
is sort of so social social and economic
 
01:07:15.349 --> 01:07:15.359 align:start position:0%
uh situations where um some families
 
01:07:17.269 --> 01:07:17.279 align:start position:0%
might have those documents ready for
 
01:07:19.670 --> 01:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
their 18 year-olds and some families may
 
01:07:21.589 --> 01:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
have had a house fire or some other way
 
01:07:23.069 --> 01:07:23.079 align:start position:0%
where those documents aren't readily
 
01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
available and I think
 
01:07:27.630 --> 01:07:27.640 align:start position:0%
um equalizing that is an important thing
 
01:07:29.829 --> 01:07:29.839 align:start position:0%
um having transportation to go to the
 
01:07:32.510 --> 01:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
town clerk's office in many um
 
01:07:34.589 --> 01:07:34.599 align:start position:0%
communities they're only open especially
 
01:07:36.349 --> 01:07:36.359 align:start position:0%
in the North Country they're only open
 
01:07:39.029 --> 01:07:39.039 align:start position:0%
you know a few hours a week and um sort
 
01:07:42.190 --> 01:07:42.200 align:start position:0%
of not standardized hours so I think um
 
01:07:43.710 --> 01:07:43.720 align:start position:0%
you know it was interesting when we
 
01:07:45.990 --> 01:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
looked at the kennet school district in
 
01:07:48.430 --> 01:07:48.440 align:start position:0%
Conway the hours of the supervisors of
 
01:07:50.150 --> 01:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
the checklist of those nine Regional
 
01:07:52.349 --> 01:07:52.359 align:start position:0%
School District and there isn't much
 
01:07:54.069 --> 01:07:54.079 align:start position:0%
availability for students to get there
 
01:07:55.750 --> 01:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
during the hours of the town clerk I
 
01:07:57.789 --> 01:07:57.799 align:start position:0%
mean they can go on Election Day so that
 
01:07:59.390 --> 01:07:59.400 align:start position:0%
does provide us an additional
 
01:08:01.109 --> 01:08:01.119 align:start position:0%
opportunity for those students that want
 
01:08:03.910 --> 01:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
to do same day registration thank
 
01:08:07.150 --> 01:08:07.160 align:start position:0%
you further questions not see thank you
 
01:08:21.070 --> 01:08:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:22.829 --> 01:08:22.839 align:start position:0%
langle good
 
01:08:22.839 --> 01:08:26.070 align:start position:0%
langle good
morning

01:08:26.070 --> 01:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:27.309 --> 01:08:27.319 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman lad and
 
01:08:28.709 --> 01:08:28.719 align:start position:0%
distinguished members of the House

Bill 1014 this describes well youall
 
01:08:40.669 --> 01:08:40.679 align:start position:0%
know what it
 
01:08:42.870 --> 01:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
describes uh in our current political
 
01:08:44.669 --> 01:08:44.679 align:start position:0%
climate discussions regarding young
 
01:08:46.590 --> 01:08:46.600 align:start position:0%
people's inclination to participate in
 
01:08:48.749 --> 01:08:48.759 align:start position:0%
governmental processes or the lack
 
01:08:52.510 --> 01:08:52.520 align:start position:0%
thereof are exceptionally be are finally
 
01:08:55.070 --> 01:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
being heard um um this topic has gone
 
01:08:56.950 --> 01:08:56.960 align:start position:0%
Nationwide influencing campaign
 
01:08:59.110 --> 01:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
decisions of candidates for president of
 
01:09:01.789 --> 01:09:01.799 align:start position:0%
the United States and young voters have
 
01:09:03.470 --> 01:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
historically been underrepresented in
 
01:09:05.510 --> 01:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
elections often due to a lack of
 
01:09:07.430 --> 01:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
knowledge surrounding the process of
 
01:09:10.349 --> 01:09:10.359 align:start position:0%
registering to vote it has been seen
 
01:09:12.149 --> 01:09:12.159 align:start position:0%
that young voters when they use their
 
01:09:14.110 --> 01:09:14.120 align:start position:0%
voice can make significant changes in
 
01:09:16.470 --> 01:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
the outcome of an election I actually
 
01:09:18.390 --> 01:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
just read a report of research that
 
01:09:20.789 --> 01:09:20.799 align:start position:0%
marked New Hampshire as one of the
 
01:09:23.390 --> 01:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
states to watch in the presidential
 
01:09:26.229 --> 01:09:26.239 align:start position:0%
primary because of young
 
01:09:29.430 --> 01:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
voters so in my testimony I discussed
 
01:09:32.149 --> 01:09:32.159 align:start position:0%
the same RSA that um the representative
 
01:09:33.910 --> 01:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
who sponsored the bill I'm blanking on
 
01:09:36.669 --> 01:09:36.679 align:start position:0%
their name um brought up where Section
 
01:09:39.390 --> 01:09:39.400 align:start position:0%
504 plans and individualized education
 
01:09:42.030 --> 01:09:42.040 align:start position:0%
plans um are required to include
 
01:09:44.470 --> 01:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
discussion on quote voter registration
 
01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
as an appropriate Community Living
 
01:09:48.789 --> 01:09:48.799 align:start position:0%
citizenship training goal or competency
 
01:09:51.229 --> 01:09:51.239 align:start position:0%
to be included in their plan and if
 
01:09:52.709 --> 01:09:52.719 align:start position:0%
appropriate when and how voter
 
01:09:55.070 --> 01:09:55.080 align:start position:0%
registration should be accomplished this
 
01:09:56.790 --> 01:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
discussion is vital for students who may
 
01:09:58.830 --> 01:09:58.840 align:start position:0%
be facing a disability or barrier to
 
01:10:01.950 --> 01:10:01.960 align:start position:0%
accessing resources as was mentioned um
 
01:10:04.229 --> 01:10:04.239 align:start position:0%
and the concepts described in this
 
01:10:06.990 --> 01:10:07.000 align:start position:0%
competency are completely transferable
 
01:10:08.950 --> 01:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
to general education
 
01:10:11.350 --> 01:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
classrooms um and this would allow for
 
01:10:12.990 --> 01:10:13.000 align:start position:0%
all students to gain understanding of
 
01:10:15.149 --> 01:10:15.159 align:start position:0%
real world Concepts that are applicable
 
01:10:18.030 --> 01:10:18.040 align:start position:0%
after graduation I graduated conquered
 
01:10:20.990 --> 01:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
High School in 2022 and then went to
 
01:10:22.790 --> 01:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
participate in the midterm elections
 
01:10:24.229 --> 01:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
that following November
 
01:10:26.590 --> 01:10:26.600 align:start position:0%
but that's only because I registered to
 
01:10:30.470 --> 01:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
vote and I had the opportunity to do my
 
01:10:32.990 --> 01:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
own research on how to in fact I brought
 
01:10:35.470 --> 01:10:35.480 align:start position:0%
more documentation than I needed into
 
01:10:38.270 --> 01:10:38.280 align:start position:0%
the town clerk's office I had no idea
 
01:10:40.990 --> 01:10:41.000 align:start position:0%
what I was doing um as a young voter
 
01:10:43.189 --> 01:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
myself this bill and the impact it could
 
01:10:44.990 --> 01:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
have on Civics education and youth
 
01:10:46.709 --> 01:10:46.719 align:start position:0%
participation in government really
 
01:10:49.590 --> 01:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
stands out to me
 
01:10:52.669 --> 01:10:52.679 align:start position:0%
um yeah I mean students are required to
 
01:10:54.669 --> 01:10:54.679 align:start position:0%
buy law to spend a significant amount of
 
01:10:57.630 --> 01:10:57.640 align:start position:0%
time I said 7 hours 5 days a week if
 
01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
that's not correct please correct me um
 
01:11:03.070 --> 01:11:03.080 align:start position:0%
in school and aiding them in the process
 
01:11:04.709 --> 01:11:04.719 align:start position:0%
of becoming an active member of their
 
01:11:06.790 --> 01:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
Community seems like a very valuable way
 
01:11:09.990 --> 01:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
to spend that time I now attend St anom
 
01:11:11.709 --> 01:11:11.719 align:start position:0%
College which is one of the most
 
01:11:14.189 --> 01:11:14.199 align:start position:0%
prolific centers of community engagement
 
01:11:17.229 --> 01:11:17.239 align:start position:0%
in the state and not even everyone there
 
01:11:20.550 --> 01:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
is registered to vote so thank you very
 
01:11:22.030 --> 01:11:22.040 align:start position:0%
much Katherine are there any questions
 
01:11:25.550 --> 01:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
for Katherine represent
 
01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
dry thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:11:29.350 --> 01:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
coming to
 
01:11:31.990 --> 01:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
testify there are other elections
 
01:11:34.350 --> 01:11:34.360 align:start position:0%
besides national elections and state
 
01:11:36.870 --> 01:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
elections um have you figured into it
 
01:11:38.149 --> 01:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
you know participating in town
 
01:11:40.830 --> 01:11:40.840 align:start position:0%
governments as well as um as national
 
01:11:42.750 --> 01:11:42.760 align:start position:0%
elections absolutely and I feel like
 
01:11:44.390 --> 01:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
that's an important conversation to have
 
01:11:46.990 --> 01:11:47.000 align:start position:0%
as well in Civics education classrooms
 
01:11:48.590 --> 01:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
the biggest thing that I got from this
 
01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
bill was that Civics education and
 
01:11:53.750 --> 01:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
Community engagement in theory is
 
01:11:55.910 --> 01:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
significantly different from Civics
 
01:11:59.470 --> 01:11:59.480 align:start position:0%
education and C like Civic engagement in
 
01:12:01.590 --> 01:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
practice taking the information that you
 
01:12:03.390 --> 01:12:03.400 align:start position:0%
learn in the classroom about Municipal
 
01:12:05.790 --> 01:12:05.800 align:start position:0%
elections State elections and
 
01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
presidential elections and actually
 
01:12:10.510 --> 01:12:10.520 align:start position:0%
going out and participating them in them
 
01:12:14.870 --> 01:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
there's a clear Gap or lag as was
 
01:12:17.310 --> 01:12:17.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned I toward the state house and
 
01:12:20.110 --> 01:12:20.120 align:start position:0%
the um yeah I sorted the state house and
 
01:12:21.790 --> 01:12:21.800 align:start position:0%
all the chambers when I was in like
 
01:12:23.910 --> 01:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
fourth or fifth grade I remember that
 
01:12:25.709 --> 01:12:25.719 align:start position:0%
but then when I got to high school not a
 
01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
single person was talking about that
 
01:12:28.709 --> 01:12:28.719 align:start position:0%
anymore because it was in elementary
 
01:12:31.110 --> 01:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
school so that lag and that disconnect
 
01:12:33.470 --> 01:12:33.480 align:start position:0%
between theory and practice is is clear
 
01:12:35.669 --> 01:12:35.679 align:start position:0%
and I feel like this bill would uh
 
01:12:38.470 --> 01:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
standardize that in policy thank you
 
01:12:40.950 --> 01:12:40.960 align:start position:0%
very much representative P
 
01:12:43.229 --> 01:12:43.239 align:start position:0%
now thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
being here you are clearly well ahead of
 
01:12:48.110 --> 01:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
the curve for somebody your age when it
 
01:12:50.390 --> 01:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
comes to Civic engagement how did you
 
01:12:51.709 --> 01:12:51.719 align:start position:0%
become aware of this
 
01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
bill so I actually became aware of this
 
01:12:59.110 --> 01:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
bill because I'm looking into uh I want
 
01:13:02.669 --> 01:13:02.679 align:start position:0%
to create my career surrounding uh civic
 
01:13:04.870 --> 01:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
education and working in a school
 
01:13:07.229 --> 01:13:07.239 align:start position:0%
ideally combining psychology education
 
01:13:08.950 --> 01:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
and public policy together which is what
 
01:13:11.950 --> 01:13:11.960 align:start position:0%
my degree will be in um so understanding
 
01:13:14.149 --> 01:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
this bill and paying attention to what's
 
01:13:17.709 --> 01:13:17.719 align:start position:0%
going on is very important to me um I
 
01:13:20.669 --> 01:13:20.679 align:start position:0%
also had the opportunity of teaching
 
01:13:24.030 --> 01:13:24.040 align:start position:0%
high schoolers uh at as a
 
01:13:27.470 --> 01:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
you know like a teacher essentially in
 
01:13:29.590 --> 01:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
uh at my college in an after school
 
01:13:31.189 --> 01:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
program for them and I taught College
 
01:13:33.270 --> 01:13:33.280 align:start position:0%
admissions so I spoke with a lot of high
 
01:13:35.750 --> 01:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
school seniors about registering to vote
 
01:13:37.910 --> 01:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
and uh this conversation I feel like
 
01:13:39.750 --> 01:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
could only be
 
01:13:42.750 --> 01:13:42.760 align:start position:0%
Amplified thank you very much yeah pen
 
01:13:44.470 --> 01:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
now follow up I'm sorry you didn't quite
 
01:13:46.830 --> 01:13:46.840 align:start position:0%

01:13:50.510 --> 01:13:50.520 align:start position:0%

Damon thank you Mr chair good morning
 
01:14:21.550 --> 01:14:21.560 align:start position:0%
colleagues I'm a co-sponsor of this bill
 
01:14:23.709 --> 01:14:23.719 align:start position:0%
and vigor who support it one of the
 
01:14:26.310 --> 01:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
reasons I ran for State Rep was to do
 
01:14:28.110 --> 01:14:28.120 align:start position:0%
whatever I could to help young people be
 
01:14:30.990 --> 01:14:31.000 align:start position:0%
more engaged in our government processes
 
01:14:33.030 --> 01:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
and appreciate the impact of government
 
01:14:36.270 --> 01:14:36.280 align:start position:0%
on them I am mentoring a sunap high
 
01:14:38.470 --> 01:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
school senior inter senior project Jenna
 
01:14:40.110 --> 01:14:40.120 align:start position:0%
Karen who very unfortunately was not
 
01:14:43.830 --> 01:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
able to be here today um her project is
 
01:14:46.070 --> 01:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
on voter engagement in local elections
 
01:14:49.590 --> 01:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
so the question a moment ago about local
 
01:14:53.510 --> 01:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
mattering as well as state and federal
 
01:14:55.189 --> 01:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
is on some people's
 
01:14:57.990 --> 01:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
radar um there are five high schools in
 
01:15:01.030 --> 01:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
the nin toown District that I represent
 
01:15:02.510 --> 01:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
and because two of those high schools
 
01:15:05.110 --> 01:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
are Cooperative schools they educate
 
01:15:08.790 --> 01:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
students from 16 towns I pulled them
 
01:15:12.030 --> 01:15:12.040 align:start position:0%
none of those high schools provide voter
 
01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:13.270 align:start position:0%
none of those high schools provide voter
registration

01:15:13.270 --> 01:15:13.280 align:start position:0%
registration
 
01:15:17.590 --> 01:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
information by default to students it is
 
01:15:21.110 --> 01:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
as was referenced uh I think by Olivia
 
01:15:23.990 --> 01:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
zinc contingent on a motivated person
 
01:15:26.070 --> 01:15:26.080 align:start position:0%
who decides to do that in a given year
 
01:15:27.390 --> 01:15:27.400 align:start position:0%
it's not a
 
01:15:29.830 --> 01:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
routine I think it is an essential piece
 
01:15:32.430 --> 01:15:32.440 align:start position:0%
of our democracy that we help students
 
01:15:35.189 --> 01:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
readily understand how they can register
 
01:15:37.430 --> 01:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
to vote and make it convenient for them
 
01:15:38.390 --> 01:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:15:41.669 --> 01:15:41.679 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to address the question from
 
01:15:46.750 --> 01:15:46.760 align:start position:0%
representative Noble about the party um
 
01:15:49.070 --> 01:15:49.080 align:start position:0%
indication on the on the voter
 
01:15:51.110 --> 01:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
registration I will bring forward an
 
01:15:54.390 --> 01:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
amendment to this bill in committee to
 
01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:56.750 align:start position:0%
amendment to this bill in committee to
specify

01:15:56.750 --> 01:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
specify
 
01:16:00.110 --> 01:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
in uh line eight where it says providing
 
01:16:01.790 --> 01:16:01.800 align:start position:0%
access to an assistance with filing
 
01:16:04.070 --> 01:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
registration applications to
 
01:16:07.229 --> 01:16:07.239 align:start position:0%
specifically say without any influence
 
01:16:10.270 --> 01:16:10.280 align:start position:0%
on party affiliation so that there's no
 
01:16:11.910 --> 01:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
uncertainty about that being
 
01:16:13.390 --> 01:16:13.400 align:start position:0%
inappropriate to
 
01:16:15.310 --> 01:16:15.320 align:start position:0%
do I thank you all for your
 
01:16:17.629 --> 01:16:17.639 align:start position:0%
consideration and I really hope that we
 
01:16:21.750 --> 01:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
can find our bipartisan voices because
 
01:16:23.950 --> 01:16:23.960 align:start position:0%
all voters matter and all students
 
01:16:27.910 --> 01:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
should be able to be voters thank
 
01:16:30.910 --> 01:16:30.920 align:start position:0%
you pretty good timing
 
01:16:33.709 --> 01:16:33.719 align:start position:0%
there yeah obviously you don't want any
 
01:16:35.709 --> 01:16:35.719 align:start position:0%
questions we can do it during EXA
 
01:16:37.350 --> 01:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
session as well are there any questions
 
01:16:39.870 --> 01:16:39.880 align:start position:0%
for the representative representative
 
01:16:41.790 --> 01:16:41.800 align:start position:0%
beler thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:16:44.270 --> 01:16:44.280 align:start position:0%
for that testimony um one thing I wanted
 
01:16:46.270 --> 01:16:46.280 align:start position:0%
to look at is the the latter part of
 
01:16:49.189 --> 01:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
this bill which um it does say that it
 
01:16:52.910 --> 01:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
can't be utilized as a class requirement
 
01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:55.070 align:start position:0%
can't be utilized as a class requirement
um

01:16:55.070 --> 01:16:55.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:56.590 --> 01:16:56.600 align:start position:0%
however it seems to me that there's a
 
01:16:59.390 --> 01:16:59.400 align:start position:0%
lot of other potential carrots and
 
01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
sticks that are not directly addressed
 
01:17:02.830 --> 01:17:02.840 align:start position:0%
in this bill even things like sports
 
01:17:05.590 --> 01:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
participation so how can we be sure that
 
01:17:08.270 --> 01:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
schools won't actually look to any of
 
01:17:09.790 --> 01:17:09.800 align:start position:0%
those other items that are not
 
01:17:12.350 --> 01:17:12.360 align:start position:0%
specifically listed in this bill as a
 
01:17:18.950 --> 01:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:21.990 --> 01:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
registration thank you for the
 
01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.189 align:start position:0%
registration thank you for the
question

01:17:24.189 --> 01:17:24.199 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:17:26.950 --> 01:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
I don't have
 
01:17:31.110 --> 01:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
a process for how you would itemize
 
01:17:34.270 --> 01:17:34.280 align:start position:0%
every imaginable thing
 
01:17:38.030 --> 01:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
that in some people's minds could happen
 
01:17:40.990 --> 01:17:41.000 align:start position:0%
but I don't perceive that as a
 
01:17:42.669 --> 01:17:42.679 align:start position:0%
risk thank
 
01:17:45.149 --> 01:17:45.159 align:start position:0%
you thank you very
 
01:17:48.430 --> 01:17:48.440 align:start position:0%

01:17:51.430 --> 01:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:54.030 --> 01:17:54.040 align:start position:0%
RP not all of them
 
01:17:57.709 --> 01:17:57.719 align:start position:0%
okay so that this concludes the hearing
 
01:17:57.719 --> 01:17:58.590 align:start position:0%
okay so that this concludes the hearing
for

01:17:58.590 --> 01:17:58.600 align:start position:0%

01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
10:14 and we're ready to go into now the
 
01:18:02.990 --> 01:18:03.000 align:start position:0%

that even though the bill was effective

Brian balky would do a much more
 
01:22:05.229 --> 01:22:05.239 align:start position:0%
thorough job so that's fair enough he
 
01:22:07.629 --> 01:22:07.639 align:start position:0%

01:22:40.310 --> 01:22:40.320 align:start position:0%

you thank thank you Mr chair I I'll be
 
01:22:51.430 --> 01:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
very brief representative wolf really
 
01:22:53.350 --> 01:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
said virtually everything that I would
 
01:22:55.350 --> 01:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
that I would say and uh much better than
 
01:22:56.990 --> 01:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
I would say it I'm sure I would just say
 
01:22:59.470 --> 01:22:59.480 align:start position:0%
that I strongly support the extension it
 
01:23:01.750 --> 01:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
seems to me that the the pandemic you
 
01:23:04.629 --> 01:23:04.639 align:start position:0%
know really did have a uh a delaying
 
01:23:07.149 --> 01:23:07.159 align:start position:0%
effect uh on this on this legislation
 
01:23:10.110 --> 01:23:10.120 align:start position:0%
it's very important I think the getting
 
01:23:12.350 --> 01:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
uh getting the uh the commission to be
 
01:23:15.790 --> 01:23:15.800 align:start position:0%
able to review the the results of the uh
 
01:23:18.110 --> 01:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
of the St of the evaluation done by the
 
01:23:19.669 --> 01:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
education department when they've when
 
01:23:21.550 --> 01:23:21.560 align:start position:0%
they've completed that and having some
 
01:23:24.750 --> 01:23:24.760 align:start position:0%
time to see how this is uh is working is
 
01:23:28.590 --> 01:23:28.600 align:start position:0%
is very important and so I urge you uh
 
01:23:31.310 --> 01:23:31.320 align:start position:0%
uh to pass this leg to vote favorably to
 
01:23:33.030 --> 01:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
pass this legislation and I'm happy to
 
01:23:35.030 --> 01:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
take any questions thank you any
 
01:23:37.350 --> 01:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
questions of represent Lyn I do have one
 
01:23:39.390 --> 01:23:39.400 align:start position:0%
for you given the nature what's going on
 
01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:40.390 align:start position:0%
for you given the nature what's going on
today's

01:23:40.390 --> 01:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
today's
 
01:23:44.830 --> 01:23:44.840 align:start position:0%
society with the uh issues we've seen on
 
01:23:46.790 --> 01:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
various college campuses and throughout
 
01:23:50.270 --> 01:23:50.280 align:start position:0%
the country dealing with semantic um
 
01:23:53.030 --> 01:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
issues you know with the the Holocaust
 
01:23:57.390 --> 01:23:57.400 align:start position:0%
and etc etc um is that rationale good
 
01:23:59.669 --> 01:23:59.679 align:start position:0%
rationale for us to really pursue this
 
01:24:04.229 --> 01:24:04.239 align:start position:0%
for another few years um sure no I mean
 
01:24:07.470 --> 01:24:07.480 align:start position:0%
I think that I I think I I think it it
 
01:24:09.550 --> 01:24:09.560 align:start position:0%
on its on the merits of it even if we
 
01:24:11.750 --> 01:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
didn't have what was going on now it
 
01:24:14.310 --> 01:24:14.320 align:start position:0%
would be it would be a good that would
 
01:24:17.270 --> 01:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
in itself uh would be a good reason to
 
01:24:20.470 --> 01:24:20.480 align:start position:0%
to extend it but particularly given what
 
01:24:23.430 --> 01:24:23.440 align:start position:0%
um what we've seen going on around the
 
01:24:25.950 --> 01:24:25.960 align:start position:0%
country um and what effect you know
 
01:24:27.310 --> 01:24:27.320 align:start position:0%
we've seen this
 
01:24:30.390 --> 01:24:30.400 align:start position:0%
mostly um this kind of behavior on
 
01:24:33.350 --> 01:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
college campuses but I I can't help but
 
01:24:35.910 --> 01:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
believe that it's got that that that is
 
01:24:37.629 --> 01:24:37.639 align:start position:0%
going to have some influence on what's
 
01:24:40.350 --> 01:24:40.360 align:start position:0%
happening at the lower in the lower uh
 
01:24:42.709 --> 01:24:42.719 align:start position:0%
grades in the educational system and so
 
01:24:44.590 --> 01:24:44.600 align:start position:0%
it would be it would seem to me that it
 
01:24:48.430 --> 01:24:48.440 align:start position:0%
would be important for um for the
 
01:24:51.950 --> 01:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
evaluation to to have some additional
 
01:24:54.350 --> 01:24:54.360 align:start position:0%
time to see you know what what
 
01:24:57.550 --> 01:24:57.560 align:start position:0%
effect uh the recent events have had
 
01:25:02.030 --> 01:25:02.040 align:start position:0%
which are you know I mean if if if
 
01:25:04.109 --> 01:25:04.119 align:start position:0%
somebody had said to
 
01:25:07.390 --> 01:25:07.400 align:start position:0%
me you know six months ago that we would
 
01:25:10.550 --> 01:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
see the kind of behavior anti-semitic
 
01:25:13.310 --> 01:25:13.320 align:start position:0%
Behavior public anti-semitic Behavior I
 
01:25:16.590 --> 01:25:16.600 align:start position:0%
mean anti-Semitism has always existed uh
 
01:25:19.750 --> 01:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
but you know at least at least in the
 
01:25:23.229 --> 01:25:23.239 align:start position:0%
not too distant past it was it uh
 
01:25:26.990 --> 01:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
uh it it was not the kind of open thing
 
01:25:28.229 --> 01:25:28.239 align:start position:0%
that we're seeing now but if somebody
 
01:25:29.870 --> 01:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
had said to me and I suspect you all of
 
01:25:31.189 --> 01:25:31.199 align:start position:0%
you would have the same view somebody
 
01:25:33.830 --> 01:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
had said to to any of any of us six
 
01:25:36.350 --> 01:25:36.360 align:start position:0%
months ago that we would see the kind of
 
01:25:39.030 --> 01:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
public anti-semitic behavior that we've
 
01:25:41.709 --> 01:25:41.719 align:start position:0%
seen on you know on the on our nation's
 
01:25:45.149 --> 01:25:45.159 align:start position:0%
supposedly finest uh colleges I I think
 
01:25:46.470 --> 01:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
would say you're you know you're you're
 
01:25:48.590 --> 01:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
crazy that's that's just ridiculous but
 
01:25:52.270 --> 01:25:52.280 align:start position:0%
look what we've seen yeah it's sad uh
 
01:25:53.950 --> 01:25:53.960 align:start position:0%
further questions representative
 
01:25:55.550 --> 01:25:55.560 align:start position:0%
cordelli thank you thank you
 
01:25:57.990 --> 01:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
representative for being here um I just
 
01:26:00.030 --> 01:26:00.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to follow up on comment you made
 
01:26:03.229 --> 01:26:03.239 align:start position:0%
in also that representative wolf made um
 
01:26:05.510 --> 01:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
I see in the charge to the commission
 
01:26:07.990 --> 01:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
that it should monitor
 
01:26:10.910 --> 01:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
implementation but there was indication
 
01:26:14.750 --> 01:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
that um there was a requirement to
 
01:26:19.950 --> 01:26:19.960 align:start position:0%
um uh make sure that the desired results
 
01:26:23.510 --> 01:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
are being provided I'm not sure what
 
01:26:25.990 --> 01:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
those desired results are and who is
 
01:26:29.310 --> 01:26:29.320 align:start position:0%
going to be uh determining um whether
 
01:26:32.669 --> 01:26:32.679 align:start position:0%
the results are uh being uh provided
 
01:26:34.750 --> 01:26:34.760 align:start position:0%
that are
 
01:26:37.149 --> 01:26:37.159 align:start position:0%
desired I I I guess I'm I'm going to
 
01:26:40.709 --> 01:26:40.719 align:start position:0%
have to say that I I have not at all I'm
 
01:26:42.750 --> 01:26:42.760 align:start position:0%
not on the commission and I have not at
 
01:26:45.910 --> 01:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
all been involved in the details of that
 
01:26:49.430 --> 01:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
I believe uh that uh representative wolf
 
01:26:53.590 --> 01:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
made reference to another witness uh who
 
01:26:55.950 --> 01:26:55.960 align:start position:0%
have that information I would have to
 
01:26:59.870 --> 01:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
defer to him yeah y thank you further
 
01:27:01.830 --> 01:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much judge
 
01:27:03.350 --> 01:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
thank thank
 
01:27:15.550 --> 01:27:15.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:17.550 --> 01:27:17.560 align:start position:0%
balky thank you chairman lad good
 
01:27:19.790 --> 01:27:19.800 align:start position:0%
morning good morning uh my name is Brian
 
01:27:21.590 --> 01:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
baly I'm the superintendent of schools
 
01:27:25.109 --> 01:27:25.119 align:start position:0%
in in New Boston representing sau9 and I
 
01:27:26.870 --> 01:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
also have the privilege of serving on
 
01:27:30.390 --> 01:27:30.400 align:start position:0%
the commission um as a representative of
 
01:27:32.270 --> 01:27:32.280 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire school administrators
 
01:27:34.430 --> 01:27:34.440 align:start position:0%
Association uh as representative wolf
 
01:27:36.669 --> 01:27:36.679 align:start position:0%
shared our request is simply to extend
 
01:27:39.030 --> 01:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
the date um at this point we feel like
 
01:27:41.510 --> 01:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
there's been a delay in uh this work
 
01:27:43.830 --> 01:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
moving forward and when we've when the
 
01:27:45.350 --> 01:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
commission first started we essentially
 
01:27:47.470 --> 01:27:47.480 align:start position:0%
broke our work into three categories the
 
01:27:50.990 --> 01:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
first was um policy the second was best
 
01:27:52.709 --> 01:27:52.719 align:start position:0%
practices and the third was
 
01:27:54.910 --> 01:27:54.920 align:start position:0%
implementation the policy work that we
 
01:27:58.109 --> 01:27:58.119 align:start position:0%
did is we helped draft Draft rules that
 
01:27:59.950 --> 01:27:59.960 align:start position:0%
went to the State Board of Education and
 
01:28:02.910 --> 01:28:02.920 align:start position:0%
then ultimately on to Jael car the work
 
01:28:04.669 --> 01:28:04.679 align:start position:0%
that work is essentially done the rules
 
01:28:07.149 --> 01:28:07.159 align:start position:0%
have been passed it's implemented uh
 
01:28:08.709 --> 01:28:08.719 align:start position:0%
that part of the commission's work is
 
01:28:11.270 --> 01:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
completed the best practices work I do
 
01:28:14.189 --> 01:28:14.199 align:start position:0%
see is ongoing I think that um this is
 
01:28:15.590 --> 01:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
something that we will continue to need
 
01:28:17.669 --> 01:28:17.679 align:start position:0%
to provide resources for teachers and
 
01:28:19.790 --> 01:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
schools but the third part I think is
 
01:28:21.470 --> 01:28:21.480 align:start position:0%
really the the focus of the commission
 
01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:22.669 align:start position:0%
really the the focus of the commission
extension

01:28:22.669 --> 01:28:22.679 align:start position:0%
extension
 
01:28:24.870 --> 01:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
the implementation piece there simply
 
01:28:27.430 --> 01:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
hasn't been enough time to know whether
 
01:28:29.510 --> 01:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
the rules are being followed whether
 
01:28:30.910 --> 01:28:30.920 align:start position:0%
school districts need additional
 
01:28:32.669 --> 01:28:32.679 align:start position:0%
supports and resources and that's
 
01:28:34.470 --> 01:28:34.480 align:start position:0%
essentially what we're here asking uh
 
01:28:37.270 --> 01:28:37.280 align:start position:0%
this morning so uh the Department of
 
01:28:40.070 --> 01:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
Education is doing um a survey right now
 
01:28:41.709 --> 01:28:41.719 align:start position:0%
that all School principles have to
 
01:28:43.550 --> 01:28:43.560 align:start position:0%
complete it's called the input-based
 
01:28:46.669 --> 01:28:46.679 align:start position:0%
accountability system or ibass as the
 
01:28:49.950 --> 01:28:49.960 align:start position:0%
department calls it in that survey all
 
01:28:51.990 --> 01:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
schools have to report out on whether
 
01:28:54.510 --> 01:28:54.520 align:start position:0%
whether they're meeting the requirements
 
01:28:57.070 --> 01:28:57.080 align:start position:0%
of Hol and genocide um Holocaust and
 
01:28:59.550 --> 01:28:59.560 align:start position:0%
genocide education as it's required at
 
01:29:01.430 --> 01:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
the middle school and high school levels
 
01:29:03.629 --> 01:29:03.639 align:start position:0%
we haven't collected that data yet those
 
01:29:05.950 --> 01:29:05.960 align:start position:0%
reports aren't due until next week I
 
01:29:07.470 --> 01:29:07.480 align:start position:0%
think it makes good sense to wait and
 
01:29:10.030 --> 01:29:10.040 align:start position:0%
see let's see what whether schools have
 
01:29:12.229 --> 01:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
implemented this as they're supposed to
 
01:29:13.910 --> 01:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
and I think more importantly and really
 
01:29:15.430 --> 01:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
this is the focus that I want to uh
 
01:29:17.510 --> 01:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
focus on how do we help
 
01:29:20.310 --> 01:29:20.320 align:start position:0%
teachers teaching about the Holocaust or
 
01:29:23.229 --> 01:29:23.239 align:start position:0%
other genocides is pretty tricky it's
 
01:29:25.109 --> 01:29:25.119 align:start position:0%
it's complicated and we want to make
 
01:29:26.870 --> 01:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
sure that we're supporting the field and
 
01:29:28.629 --> 01:29:28.639 align:start position:0%
giving resources and supports to
 
01:29:31.310 --> 01:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
teachers um representative belter asked
 
01:29:33.470 --> 01:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
specifically about some of the content I
 
01:29:36.470 --> 01:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
would uh refer you to um Keen state
 
01:29:40.830 --> 01:29:40.840 align:start position:0%
college has um has a has a Coen center
 
01:29:42.590 --> 01:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
that is focused the Coen Center is
 
01:29:44.270 --> 01:29:44.280 align:start position:0%
focused on Holocaust and genocide
 
01:29:46.270 --> 01:29:46.280 align:start position:0%
education and they've developed a
 
01:29:48.030 --> 01:29:48.040 align:start position:0%
website that has a number of resources
 
01:29:50.950 --> 01:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
and supports that ranges from um
 
01:29:53.430 --> 01:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
recommended books to lesson plans that
 
01:29:55.669 --> 01:29:55.679 align:start position:0%
teachers can follow different resources
 
01:29:58.149 --> 01:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
that teachers can use um as they do this
 
01:30:00.790 --> 01:30:00.800 align:start position:0%
work um I'll I'll stop there and be
 
01:30:02.390 --> 01:30:02.400 align:start position:0%
brief and ask if there are any questions
 
01:30:04.629 --> 01:30:04.639 align:start position:0%
but that's essentially um the nature of
 
01:30:04.639 --> 01:30:06.189 align:start position:0%
but that's essentially um the nature of
this

01:30:06.189 --> 01:30:06.199 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:30:09.750 --> 01:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
bill represent dry thank you Mr chairman
 
01:30:11.270 --> 01:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming for to our
 
01:30:14.870 --> 01:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
committee um in the statute it said that
 
01:30:17.270 --> 01:30:17.280 align:start position:0%
an annual report was to be start
 
01:30:20.350 --> 01:30:20.360 align:start position:0%
submitted starting November 1st of 21
 
01:30:23.070 --> 01:30:23.080 align:start position:0%
and every year thereafter did you do
 
01:30:25.709 --> 01:30:25.719 align:start position:0%
anything in 21 22 or 2 yeah the the
 
01:30:27.470 --> 01:30:27.480 align:start position:0%
reports have been I think it's every
 
01:30:29.470 --> 01:30:29.480 align:start position:0%
other year the last report that was
 
01:30:31.669 --> 01:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
submitted was done so by Senator Khan
 
01:30:33.310 --> 01:30:33.320 align:start position:0%
when he was the the chair of the
 
01:30:34.750 --> 01:30:34.760 align:start position:0%
commission I think that was the last one
 
01:30:37.030 --> 01:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
that we sub that we submitted okay
 
01:30:39.310 --> 01:30:39.320 align:start position:0%
follow yeah it does say every year
 
01:30:40.709 --> 01:30:40.719 align:start position:0%
thereafter do you know what year that
 
01:30:43.189 --> 01:30:43.199 align:start position:0%
was I believe that was either last year
 
01:30:44.910 --> 01:30:44.920 align:start position:0%
or it might have been the year before
 
01:30:46.390 --> 01:30:46.400 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
01:30:49.070 --> 01:30:49.080 align:start position:0%

superintendent

01:30:52.390 --> 01:30:52.400 align:start position:0%
superintendent
 
01:30:53.950 --> 01:30:53.960 align:start position:0%
uh my question is about the curriculum
 
01:30:55.709 --> 01:30:55.719 align:start position:0%
and the teaching materials and you
 
01:30:57.310 --> 01:30:57.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned that you're collecting data on
 
01:31:00.070 --> 01:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
how many schools are
 
01:31:03.470 --> 01:31:03.480 align:start position:0%
implementing um my question is is there
 
01:31:06.910 --> 01:31:06.920 align:start position:0%
going to be a recommended curriculum for
 
01:31:10.070 --> 01:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
schools and or are they allowed to just
 
01:31:12.109 --> 01:31:12.119 align:start position:0%
pull their resources from wherever they
 
01:31:14.870 --> 01:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
find them to be able to yeah the the
 
01:31:16.229 --> 01:31:16.239 align:start position:0%
commission the commission has not
 
01:31:18.510 --> 01:31:18.520 align:start position:0%
endorsed any particular curriculum or
 
01:31:20.870 --> 01:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
curricula plural um there have been a
 
01:31:22.470 --> 01:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
number of resources through the Cohen
 
01:31:24.070 --> 01:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
Center but I think at this point we want
 
01:31:25.709 --> 01:31:25.719 align:start position:0%
to continue to provide resources to
 
01:31:27.470 --> 01:31:27.480 align:start position:0%
teachers but certainly not sanctioning
 
01:31:30.910 --> 01:31:30.920 align:start position:0%
any particular um
 
01:31:33.629 --> 01:31:33.639 align:start position:0%
curriculum and a follow up to that I I
 
01:31:35.310 --> 01:31:35.320 align:start position:0%
I've uh worked with several students
 
01:31:38.030 --> 01:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
from the Coen Center over at Keane is
 
01:31:39.910 --> 01:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
there a person there that's a contact
 
01:31:43.350 --> 01:31:43.360 align:start position:0%
for Tom white pardon me Mr Tom white Tom
 
01:31:45.390 --> 01:31:45.400 align:start position:0%
um I I'm not entirely sure what his
 
01:31:46.950 --> 01:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
exact title is I think it might be the
 
01:31:49.590 --> 01:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
education coordinator but but Tom white
 
01:31:51.709 --> 01:31:51.719 align:start position:0%
also serves on the commission and he is
 
01:31:53.430 --> 01:31:53.440 align:start position:0%
is an incredible resource he does
 
01:31:54.709 --> 01:31:54.719 align:start position:0%
professional development around the
 
01:31:56.990 --> 01:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
state for teachers currently thank you
 
01:31:59.270 --> 01:31:59.280 align:start position:0%
are there further
 
01:32:01.229 --> 01:32:01.239 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank you
 
01:32:03.990 --> 01:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
for your time oh we yeah rapan belter
 
01:32:05.189 --> 01:32:05.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr here I'll make this one
 
01:32:06.950 --> 01:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
quick I I haven't had a lot of time to
 
01:32:07.870 --> 01:32:07.880 align:start position:0%
look through it I just looking through
 
01:32:10.470 --> 01:32:10.480 align:start position:0%
the Coen uh website what I see is the
 
01:32:12.149 --> 01:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
two specific incidents they're bringing
 
01:32:15.030 --> 01:32:15.040 align:start position:0%
up for genocide um are of course the
 
01:32:17.270 --> 01:32:17.280 align:start position:0%
Holocaust and also uh the current
 
01:32:18.310 --> 01:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
situation in
 
01:32:21.350 --> 01:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
Ukraine um of course the Holocaust being
 
01:32:24.590 --> 01:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
a product of fascism and ideas generally
 
01:32:27.189 --> 01:32:27.199 align:start position:0%
being what give rise to these genocide
 
01:32:30.350 --> 01:32:30.360 align:start position:0%
movements um nobody nobody would doubt
 
01:32:31.830 --> 01:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
that the Holocaust Education is
 
01:32:34.430 --> 01:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
necessary and good but I haven't
 
01:32:37.310 --> 01:32:37.320 align:start position:0%
historically seen a lot of um emphasis
 
01:32:39.109 --> 01:32:39.119 align:start position:0%
on another ideology specifically
 
01:32:41.510 --> 01:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
communism and the atrocities that it was
 
01:32:44.070 --> 01:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
responsible for is there any uh intent
 
01:32:46.790 --> 01:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
to recommend certain genocidal events
 
01:32:50.510 --> 01:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
such as ma or um paulot or any of the
 
01:32:52.350 --> 01:32:52.360 align:start position:0%
others yeah so certainly school
 
01:32:54.229 --> 01:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
districts would be permissible to focus
 
01:32:56.109 --> 01:32:56.119 align:start position:0%
on any particular genocide that they'
 
01:32:58.030 --> 01:32:58.040 align:start position:0%
they'd like to right so in addition
 
01:32:59.229 --> 01:32:59.239 align:start position:0%
there are things happening right now
 
01:33:02.709 --> 01:33:02.719 align:start position:0%
around the world in Sudan in darur look
 
01:33:04.470 --> 01:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
at what's happening in Myanmar there
 
01:33:06.229 --> 01:33:06.239 align:start position:0%
there are a number of other really good
 
01:33:08.750 --> 01:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
current examples and they um certainly
 
01:33:10.709 --> 01:33:10.719 align:start position:0%
would kind of fall within different
 
01:33:12.709 --> 01:33:12.719 align:start position:0%
constructs of government so the the
 
01:33:15.030 --> 01:33:15.040 align:start position:0%
commission is not saying this genocide
 
01:33:16.830 --> 01:33:16.840 align:start position:0%
is more important than another genocide
 
01:33:18.669 --> 01:33:18.679 align:start position:0%
in any way historically it's just saying
 
01:33:20.390 --> 01:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
that we need to teach people about the
 
01:33:22.270 --> 01:33:22.280 align:start position:0%
importance of knowing what these uh
 
01:33:24.189 --> 01:33:24.199 align:start position:0%
genocides have been historically and
 
01:33:25.790 --> 01:33:25.800 align:start position:0%
hopefully prevent them moving forward
 
01:33:27.350 --> 01:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
particularly given that they're still
 
01:33:29.750 --> 01:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
happening in this day and
 
01:33:33.149 --> 01:33:33.159 align:start position:0%
age yes representative petel thank you
 
01:33:35.709 --> 01:33:35.719 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you for being here
 
01:33:38.229 --> 01:33:38.239 align:start position:0%
um if my memory serves correctly the
 
01:33:41.709 --> 01:33:41.719 align:start position:0%
last statistic that I've heard was 65
 
01:33:44.629 --> 01:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
million 65 million pre-born children
 
01:33:46.109 --> 01:33:46.119 align:start position:0%
have been killed by abortion in our
 
01:33:47.550 --> 01:33:47.560 align:start position:0%
country since
 
01:33:50.629 --> 01:33:50.639 align:start position:0%
1973 has there been any any conversation
 
01:33:52.550 --> 01:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
during the commission meetings regarding
 
01:33:54.590 --> 01:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
instruction in this ongoing genocide in
 
01:33:56.709 --> 01:33:56.719 align:start position:0%
our own country that predominantly
 
01:33:59.030 --> 01:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
targets the African-American
 
01:34:02.070 --> 01:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
Community um I don't
 
01:34:04.270 --> 01:34:04.280 align:start position:0%
recall further
 
01:34:07.030 --> 01:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank
 
01:34:10.229 --> 01:34:10.239 align:start position:0%
you i' like to
 
01:34:15.950 --> 01:34:15.960 align:start position:0%
uh welcome Reverend ham
 
01:34:18.950 --> 01:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
Harmon New Hampshire Council of churches
 
01:34:25.910 --> 01:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:27.669 --> 01:34:27.679 align:start position:0%
good morning honorable Representatives
 
01:34:29.950 --> 01:34:29.960 align:start position:0%
uh my name is Reverend Zachary Haron I
 
01:34:32.470 --> 01:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
live at nine Spring Street in gtown New
 
01:34:34.550 --> 01:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm an Episcopal priest
 
01:34:37.550 --> 01:34:37.560 align:start position:0%
serving uh at St Christopher in Hamstead
 
01:34:40.430 --> 01:34:40.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I'm also on the uh
 
01:34:42.070 --> 01:34:42.080 align:start position:0%
Holocaust and genocide education
 
01:34:44.030 --> 01:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
commission as the representative for the
 
01:34:46.590 --> 01:34:46.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Council of churches I'm
 
01:34:50.270 --> 01:34:50.280 align:start position:0%
here to speak in support of HB 1048
 
01:34:52.149 --> 01:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
extending the work of the Holocaust and
 
01:34:53.790 --> 01:34:53.800 align:start position:0%
genocide education
 
01:34:56.109 --> 01:34:56.119 align:start position:0%
commission I feel the importance of this
 
01:34:57.430 --> 01:34:57.440 align:start position:0%
work cannot be
 
01:34:59.550 --> 01:34:59.560 align:start position:0%
overstressed well it might seem like the
 
01:35:01.910 --> 01:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
horrors of the Holocaust could never be
 
01:35:04.229 --> 01:35:04.239 align:start position:0%
forgotten I've heard from Educators and
 
01:35:05.870 --> 01:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
community members about concerning
 
01:35:08.109 --> 01:35:08.119 align:start position:0%
incidents of anti-Semitism and even
 
01:35:11.030 --> 01:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
Holocaust denial at times if the
 
01:35:14.430 --> 01:35:14.440 align:start position:0%
Holocaust is forgotten minimized or
 
01:35:16.510 --> 01:35:16.520 align:start position:0%
misremembered I believe this opens the
 
01:35:18.709 --> 01:35:18.719 align:start position:0%
door for further rises in anti-Semitism
 
01:35:20.950 --> 01:35:20.960 align:start position:0%
and dehumanization of people by their
 
01:35:23.350 --> 01:35:23.360 align:start position:0%
National ethnicity or
 
01:35:25.350 --> 01:35:25.360 align:start position:0%
religion if we do not study the
 
01:35:27.790 --> 01:35:27.800 align:start position:0%
Holocaust or genocide then we as a
 
01:35:30.350 --> 01:35:30.360 align:start position:0%
society can lose track of the dangers of
 
01:35:33.750 --> 01:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
hate in my experience as a priest I also
 
01:35:35.070 --> 01:35:35.080 align:start position:0%
know that there are other important
 
01:35:36.629 --> 01:35:36.639 align:start position:0%
genocides to consider and which should
 
01:35:39.470 --> 01:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
not be forgotten my Parish Ministry uh
 
01:35:41.270 --> 01:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
connects me at times with the Armenian
 
01:35:43.870 --> 01:35:43.880 align:start position:0%
American Community here in New Hampshire
 
01:35:46.270 --> 01:35:46.280 align:start position:0%
and many Armenians uh came to New
 
01:35:48.870 --> 01:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
England in desperation to escape the
 
01:35:51.990 --> 01:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
horrors of the Armenian Genocide
 
01:35:54.149 --> 01:35:54.159 align:start position:0%
in the education rules there is also now
 
01:35:56.590 --> 01:35:56.600 align:start position:0%
a helpful list of genocides and mass
 
01:35:59.629 --> 01:35:59.639 align:start position:0%
atrocities from which Educators can
 
01:36:02.189 --> 01:36:02.199 align:start position:0%
draw from learning about the Holocaust
 
01:36:04.669 --> 01:36:04.679 align:start position:0%
and genocide students are equipped to be
 
01:36:07.149 --> 01:36:07.159 align:start position:0%
thoughtful citizens it is hoped that
 
01:36:09.310 --> 01:36:09.320 align:start position:0%
this knowledge about the dangers of hate
 
01:36:10.990 --> 01:36:11.000 align:start position:0%
and the history of genocide will help
 
01:36:13.350 --> 01:36:13.360 align:start position:0%
prevent genocide in the
 
01:36:15.629 --> 01:36:15.639 align:start position:0%
future and perhaps the most relevant
 
01:36:18.109 --> 01:36:18.119 align:start position:0%
question here in regards to HB 1048
 
01:36:20.109 --> 01:36:20.119 align:start position:0%
though uh would be why continue this
 
01:36:22.310 --> 01:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
work all the way to 20 27 for the
 
01:36:24.430 --> 01:36:24.440 align:start position:0%
commission and the simple answer is that
 
01:36:27.030 --> 01:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
due to delays caused by covid Holocaust
 
01:36:28.950 --> 01:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
and genocide education has only just
 
01:36:31.229 --> 01:36:31.239 align:start position:0%
begun to be implemented in the state a
 
01:36:33.590 --> 01:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
little over a year ago while the
 
01:36:35.750 --> 01:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
commission was put together and and has
 
01:36:37.310 --> 01:36:37.320 align:start position:0%
put together some good and helpful
 
01:36:39.669 --> 01:36:39.679 align:start position:0%
guidelines and while the Coen Center for
 
01:36:41.470 --> 01:36:41.480 align:start position:0%
Holocaust and genocide studies has been
 
01:36:43.910 --> 01:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
very helpful in providing resources for
 
01:36:47.430 --> 01:36:47.440 align:start position:0%
educators more time is needed to track
 
01:36:49.310 --> 01:36:49.320 align:start position:0%
implementation and to help meet the
 
01:36:50.870 --> 01:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
needs of school administrators and
 
01:36:53.550 --> 01:36:53.560 align:start position:0%
educator S as they begin teaching this
 
01:36:56.149 --> 01:36:56.159 align:start position:0%
subject I would also note that time is
 
01:36:57.550 --> 01:36:57.560 align:start position:0%
of the essence as the number of
 
01:36:59.470 --> 01:36:59.480 align:start position:0%
Holocaust Survivors becomes fewer and
 
01:37:02.709 --> 01:37:02.719 align:start position:0%
fewer as the years pass it is important
 
01:37:06.350 --> 01:37:06.360 align:start position:0%
that we uh is important that we uh begin
 
01:37:08.070 --> 01:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
implementing this effectively sooner
 
01:37:10.590 --> 01:37:10.600 align:start position:0%
rather than later for all these reasons
 
01:37:13.629 --> 01:37:13.639 align:start position:0%
I hope you will support passing HB 1048
 
01:37:14.669 --> 01:37:14.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time thank you very
 
01:37:17.310 --> 01:37:17.320 align:start position:0%
much are there any questions for the
 
01:37:20.310 --> 01:37:20.320 align:start position:0%
Reverend yes represent dry thank you Mr
 
01:37:22.750 --> 01:37:22.760 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for coming
 
01:37:25.830 --> 01:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
um are you planning if we extend this
 
01:37:28.750 --> 01:37:28.760 align:start position:0%
till 2027 is there a plan to do any
 
01:37:30.709 --> 01:37:30.719 align:start position:0%
annual reports in the
 
01:37:33.910 --> 01:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
interim I you know we certainly plan to
 
01:37:36.669 --> 01:37:36.679 align:start position:0%
continue in reporting you know regularly
 
01:37:38.709 --> 01:37:38.719 align:start position:0%
and I would think annually would make
 
01:37:41.589 --> 01:37:41.599 align:start position:0%
sense and followup yeah because I know
 
01:37:43.149 --> 01:37:43.159 align:start position:0%
rep representative belch would want to
 
01:37:45.310 --> 01:37:45.320 align:start position:0%
ask that but he's not here the list you
 
01:37:47.270 --> 01:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
talked about of events to draw from what
 
01:37:49.310 --> 01:37:49.320 align:start position:0%
where is that that's education rules
 
01:37:52.310 --> 01:37:52.320 align:start position:0%

01:37:58.629 --> 01:37:58.639 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
01:38:02.070 --> 01:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
old and I certainly remember learning
 
01:38:05.589 --> 01:38:05.599 align:start position:0%
about the Holocaust when I was a child
 
01:38:07.510 --> 01:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
probably read The Diary of an Frank
 
01:38:10.870 --> 01:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
multiple times is there a period in our
 
01:38:12.870 --> 01:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
the history of education in the state of
 
01:38:14.830 --> 01:38:14.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire where we haven't been
 
01:38:19.510 --> 01:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:22.350 --> 01:38:22.360 align:start position:0%
topics so you know what we're looking
 
01:38:24.350 --> 01:38:24.360 align:start position:0%
for is to have something organized that
 
01:38:26.709 --> 01:38:26.719 align:start position:0%
ensures that students are are taught
 
01:38:29.629 --> 01:38:29.639 align:start position:0%
effectively because you know with um uh
 
01:38:30.910 --> 01:38:30.920 align:start position:0%
social media and things that are out
 
01:38:33.109 --> 01:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
there for students to draw from uh it's
 
01:38:35.350 --> 01:38:35.360 align:start position:0%
important to have a stable voice that
 
01:38:38.189 --> 01:38:38.199 align:start position:0%
can point to to the history and not have
 
01:38:40.950 --> 01:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
people uh you know uh confused you know
 
01:38:43.350 --> 01:38:43.360 align:start position:0%
for instance um I I grew up in Alaska
 
01:38:45.629 --> 01:38:45.639 align:start position:0%
and I have uh you know friends that are
 
01:38:48.510 --> 01:38:48.520 align:start position:0%
teachers in Alaska and you know I I hear
 
01:38:49.830 --> 01:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
students from from some of my friends
 
01:38:51.149 --> 01:38:51.159 align:start position:0%
that are teachers talking about kids
 
01:38:52.350 --> 01:38:52.360 align:start position:0%
that are telling them that the Holocaust
 
01:38:55.470 --> 01:38:55.480 align:start position:0%
never happened and so um you know it is
 
01:38:56.629 --> 01:38:56.639 align:start position:0%
and if it can happen all the way out in
 
01:38:58.830 --> 01:38:58.840 align:start position:0%
rural Alaska it can certainly happen
 
01:39:01.229 --> 01:39:01.239 align:start position:0%
here in you know in New Hampshire as
 
01:39:04.870 --> 01:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
well uh so you know I think um it's
 
01:39:07.550 --> 01:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
important there's probably been some
 
01:39:09.070 --> 01:39:09.080 align:start position:0%
consistency of teaching I would imagine
 
01:39:10.629 --> 01:39:10.639 align:start position:0%
it's been brought up around World War II
 
01:39:13.430 --> 01:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
or other uh School discussions but what
 
01:39:15.109 --> 01:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
we're looking for is to have consistency
 
01:39:16.950 --> 01:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
given given their eyeses that we've seen
 
01:39:19.030 --> 01:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
an anti-Semitism incidents and trying to
 
01:39:24.430 --> 01:39:24.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:26.910 --> 01:39:26.920 align:start position:0%
just a little followup on that um I
 
01:39:29.629 --> 01:39:29.639 align:start position:0%
lived in Alaska as an educator for 25
 
01:39:34.109 --> 01:39:34.119 align:start position:0%
years in Homer it's part of the
 
01:39:38.350 --> 01:39:38.360 align:start position:0%
curriculum so it's you know represent
 
01:39:40.390 --> 01:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
cordelli um thank you I just wanted to
 
01:39:44.310 --> 01:39:44.320 align:start position:0%
follow up on the anti semitic um
 
01:39:45.550 --> 01:39:45.560 align:start position:0%
incidents that been happy that
 
01:39:46.830 --> 01:39:46.840 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn and you both

semitism um Christians are also um
 
01:39:59.070 --> 01:39:59.080 align:start position:0%
Nigeria there were a 100
 
01:40:02.629 --> 01:40:02.639 align:start position:0%
Christians uh executed on Christmas Day
 
01:40:04.629 --> 01:40:04.639 align:start position:0%
and over
 
01:40:09.510 --> 01:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
45,000 over the past decade as I
 
01:40:12.589 --> 01:40:12.599 align:start position:0%

01:40:15.109 --> 01:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
question would you
 
01:40:17.910 --> 01:40:17.920 align:start position:0%

today to introduce 1163 this is a bill
 
01:53:07.390 --> 01:53:07.400 align:start position:0%
that deals with the minimum standards uh
 
01:53:10.229 --> 01:53:10.239 align:start position:0%
for public school approval and the
 
01:53:11.870 --> 01:53:11.880 align:start position:0%
relationship of those standards with the
 
01:53:15.709 --> 01:53:15.719 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee um in
 
01:53:18.669 --> 01:53:18.679 align:start position:0%
the system we have for oversight which
 
01:53:22.589 --> 01:53:22.599 align:start position:0%
is in 198 Colon c
 
01:53:27.149 --> 01:53:27.159 align:start position:0%
18 the state has Authority currently and
 
01:53:29.030 --> 01:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
establish to establish the minimum
 
01:53:30.589 --> 01:53:30.599 align:start position:0%
public minimum standards for public
 
01:53:32.629 --> 01:53:32.639 align:start position:0%
school approval and the academic
 
01:53:34.750 --> 01:53:34.760 align:start position:0%
standards for delivery of an of
 
01:53:37.470 --> 01:53:37.480 align:start position:0%
educational services so the state board
 
01:53:39.750 --> 01:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
has that Authority and currently the
 
01:53:43.550 --> 01:53:43.560 align:start position:0%
oversight commission uh uh committee has
 
01:53:46.069 --> 01:53:46.079 align:start position:0%
approval for oversight and consideration
 
01:53:48.750 --> 01:53:48.760 align:start position:0%
of the academic
 
01:53:52.550 --> 01:53:52.560 align:start position:0%
standards so what this bill does it puts
 
01:53:54.910 --> 01:53:54.920 align:start position:0%
the oversight in the position of being
 
01:53:58.990 --> 01:53:59.000 align:start position:0%
now responsible for oversight of both
 
01:54:00.870 --> 01:54:00.880 align:start position:0%
the minimum standards for public school
 
01:54:03.350 --> 01:54:03.360 align:start position:0%
approval and the academic standards for
 
01:54:06.390 --> 01:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
the delivery of an educ of educational
 
01:54:09.910 --> 01:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
services and I passed out a paper to you
 
01:54:12.510 --> 01:54:12.520 align:start position:0%
there and I'll start off right there in
 
01:54:13.790 --> 01:54:13.800 align:start position:0%
the second
 
01:54:15.790 --> 01:54:15.800 align:start position:0%
paragraph throughout the previous year
 
01:54:17.510 --> 01:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
the State Board of Education has engaged
 
01:54:21.270 --> 01:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
in a process to update and revise Ed
 
01:54:23.790 --> 01:54:23.800 align:start position:0%
306 the minimum standards for public
 
01:54:23.800 --> 01:54:24.910 align:start position:0%
306 the minimum standards for public
school

01:54:24.910 --> 01:54:24.920 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:54:27.629 --> 01:54:27.639 align:start position:0%
approval this bill expands legislative
 
01:54:29.550 --> 01:54:29.560 align:start position:0%
oversight committee responsibility to
 
01:54:32.270 --> 01:54:32.280 align:start position:0%
allow review and make recommendations
 
01:54:34.550 --> 01:54:34.560 align:start position:0%
related to those standards those School
 
01:54:34.560 --> 01:54:35.830 align:start position:0%
related to those standards those School

01:54:35.830 --> 01:54:35.840 align:start position:0%
approval
 
01:54:37.830 --> 01:54:37.840 align:start position:0%
standards the oversight committee
 
01:54:39.589 --> 01:54:39.599 align:start position:0%
currently has responsibility for View
 
01:54:42.990 --> 01:54:43.000 align:start position:0%
and consideration only of the academic
 
01:54:45.189 --> 01:54:45.199 align:start position:0%
standards now when we were looking at
 
01:54:47.990 --> 01:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
the 306 rules that came to us the
 
01:54:50.990 --> 01:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
proposed the draft copy in initially you
 
01:54:53.189 --> 01:54:53.199 align:start position:0%
can recall that there are certain areas
 
01:54:56.629 --> 01:54:56.639 align:start position:0%
within the sections within Ed
 
01:55:00.550 --> 01:55:00.560 align:start position:0%
306 which dealt specifically with
 
01:55:02.790 --> 01:55:02.800 align:start position:0%
subjects or the criteria for a
 
01:55:06.589 --> 01:55:06.599 align:start position:0%
substitute education as identified in 13
 
01:55:09.709 --> 01:55:09.719 align:start position:0%
e e colon
 
01:55:12.790 --> 01:55:12.800 align:start position:0%
2A those are the areas which we have in
 
01:55:14.750 --> 01:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
an adequate
 
01:55:16.830 --> 01:55:16.840 align:start position:0%
education in
 
01:55:21.830 --> 01:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
306 we also have rules for those
 
01:55:23.470 --> 01:55:23.480 align:start position:0%
sections of
 
01:55:26.310 --> 01:55:26.320 align:start position:0%
law we have it for sections of art
 
01:55:28.189 --> 01:55:28.199 align:start position:0%
English health and wellness physical
 
01:55:31.589 --> 01:55:31.599 align:start position:0%

01:55:41.310 --> 01:55:41.320 align:start position:0%
Etc the ability of the State Board to
 
01:55:44.510 --> 01:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
change anything in
 
01:55:46.870 --> 01:55:46.880 align:start position:0%
306 is not
 
01:55:49.830 --> 01:55:49.840 align:start position:0%
allowed we've been told that by folks
 
01:55:51.310 --> 01:55:51.320 align:start position:0%
from the Department when they came here
 
01:55:53.350 --> 01:55:53.360 align:start position:0%
to testify you remember Nate green came
 
01:55:55.629 --> 01:55:55.639 align:start position:0%
forward and said we've changed made
 
01:55:57.669 --> 01:55:57.679 align:start position:0%
recommendations to change 306 and all
 
01:55:59.350 --> 01:55:59.360 align:start position:0%
these other areas but we have not
 
01:56:00.430 --> 01:56:00.440 align:start position:0%
touched the
 
01:56:05.950 --> 01:56:05.960 align:start position:0%
306 that was a result of we of the
 
01:56:09.270 --> 01:56:09.280 align:start position:0%
language which is in statutory law right
 
01:56:12.030 --> 01:56:12.040 align:start position:0%
now which once these have been set for
 
01:56:13.669 --> 01:56:13.679 align:start position:0%
these subject areas they can't be
 
01:56:16.910 --> 01:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
changed without statutory authority of
 
01:56:18.510 --> 01:56:18.520 align:start position:0%
the general
 
01:56:18.520 --> 01:56:20.030 align:start position:0%
the general
court

01:56:20.030 --> 01:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
court
 
01:56:21.669 --> 01:56:21.679 align:start position:0%
and that's something that represent my
 
01:56:25.550 --> 01:56:25.560 align:start position:0%
has spoken to often so what this does
 
01:56:27.550 --> 01:56:27.560 align:start position:0%
then if we're going to have the minimum
 
01:56:29.390 --> 01:56:29.400 align:start position:0%
standards for public school approval
 
01:56:31.350 --> 01:56:31.360 align:start position:0%
approved by the state board and gone
 
01:56:34.270 --> 01:56:34.280 align:start position:0%
through Jael car and that there has to
 
01:56:36.510 --> 01:56:36.520 align:start position:0%
be oversight from this committee from
 
01:56:39.189 --> 01:56:39.199 align:start position:0%
the legislative oversight committee uh
 
01:56:42.870 --> 01:56:42.880 align:start position:0%
due to the fact that we are responsible
 
01:56:45.470 --> 01:56:45.480 align:start position:0%
for anything that occurs with the
 
01:56:48.470 --> 01:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
substant criteria for an adequate
 
01:56:51.589 --> 01:56:51.599 align:start position:0%
education so what this bill does it just
 
01:56:53.629 --> 01:56:53.639 align:start position:0%
it puts in that responsibility same as
 
01:56:56.069 --> 01:56:56.079 align:start position:0%
we have for academic standards now when
 
01:56:58.589 --> 01:56:58.599 align:start position:0%
you're looking at these academic
 
01:57:01.629 --> 01:57:01.639 align:start position:0%
standards or the minimum standards you
 
01:57:03.709 --> 01:57:03.719 align:start position:0%
often times have been you'll told go
 
01:57:05.709 --> 01:57:05.719 align:start position:0%
look at the Frameworks and we'll deal
 
01:57:07.390 --> 01:57:07.400 align:start position:0%
with that in the next bill later on here
 
01:57:10.189 --> 01:57:10.199 align:start position:0%
today right after lunch uh these two
 
01:57:13.589 --> 01:57:13.599 align:start position:0%
bills are related to each other and so
 
01:57:16.109 --> 01:57:16.119 align:start position:0%
I'll conclude this part of the testimony
 
01:57:19.030 --> 01:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
stating that it's important that there
 
01:57:22.390 --> 01:57:22.400 align:start position:0%
be more oversight coming from the Ed the
 
01:57:27.550 --> 01:57:27.560 align:start position:0%
general court regarding rules in 306 306
 
01:57:29.629 --> 01:57:29.639 align:start position:0%
covers just about everything we do in
 
01:57:32.709 --> 01:57:32.719 align:start position:0%
education from in the school's
 
01:57:35.550 --> 01:57:35.560 align:start position:0%
perspective and it's important that we
 
01:57:38.550 --> 01:57:38.560 align:start position:0%
make sure that nothing's changed in the
 
01:57:40.350 --> 01:57:40.360 align:start position:0%
area of that substantive criteria
 
01:57:43.149 --> 01:57:43.159 align:start position:0%
without oversight from this committee
 
01:57:43.159 --> 01:57:44.069 align:start position:0%
without oversight from this committee

what is the oversight committee's uh
 
01:58:02.990 --> 01:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
ability to do impact anything I see
 
01:58:04.149 --> 01:58:04.159 align:start position:0%
review and
 
01:58:06.390 --> 01:58:06.400 align:start position:0%
recommend I just can

make
 
01:58:13.350 --> 01:58:13.360 align:start position:0%
recommendations you can't go much
 
01:58:15.149 --> 01:58:15.159 align:start position:0%
further than that because we
 
01:58:18.430 --> 01:58:18.440 align:start position:0%
can't Implement a pocket veto we can't
 
01:58:20.950 --> 01:58:20.960 align:start position:0%
have state this statutory language tell
 
01:58:22.229 --> 01:58:22.239 align:start position:0%
them to do something then come back and
 
01:58:24.390 --> 01:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
reconsider it through you know a a
 
01:58:26.870 --> 01:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
committee or a commission okay so but we
 
01:58:29.270 --> 01:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
can make recommendations that you're not
 
01:58:32.109 --> 01:58:32.119 align:start position:0%
following what we have established or
 
01:58:34.669 --> 01:58:34.679 align:start position:0%
you're making changes without if you
 
01:58:35.790 --> 01:58:35.800 align:start position:0%
look at
 
01:58:38.589 --> 01:58:38.599 align:start position:0%
193e it's specifically stated that
 
01:58:41.589 --> 01:58:41.599 align:start position:0%
nothing can be done to these areas of
 
01:58:45.310 --> 01:58:45.320 align:start position:0%
law right now these subject areas
 
01:58:48.830 --> 01:58:48.840 align:start position:0%
without General Court approval that's
 
01:58:52.950 --> 01:58:52.960 align:start position:0%
right there in that same section 19 93e
 
01:58:52.960 --> 01:58:53.910 align:start position:0%
right there in that same section 19 93e
colon

01:58:53.910 --> 01:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
colon
 
01:58:56.669 --> 01:58:56.679 align:start position:0%
3 I believe it's colon 3 I may be wrong
 
01:58:59.430 --> 01:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
with that but Mr chair may just follow
 
01:59:03.790 --> 01:59:03.800 align:start position:0%
up yes follow up thank you um so from
 
01:59:06.350 --> 01:59:06.360 align:start position:0%
that then if if the committee find I'm
 
01:59:08.350 --> 01:59:08.360 align:start position:0%
just TR I just don't understand if the
 
01:59:10.069 --> 01:59:10.079 align:start position:0%
committee finds uh or make a
 
01:59:13.430 --> 01:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
recommendation to who does that go to it
 
01:59:15.629 --> 01:59:15.639 align:start position:0%
goes back to the State Board state board
 
01:59:17.629 --> 01:59:17.639 align:start position:0%
yes yes it's just like with the academic
 
01:59:19.629 --> 01:59:19.639 align:start position:0%
standards we currently have you can't
 
01:59:21.870 --> 01:59:21.880 align:start position:0%
change academic standards without the
 
01:59:24.669 --> 01:59:24.679 align:start position:0%
oversight committee looking at reviewing
 
01:59:27.149 --> 01:59:27.159 align:start position:0%
it and making recommendation okay to the
 
01:59:29.030 --> 01:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
state board and there's no requ there's
 
01:59:31.430 --> 01:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
no they could fact go forward with it if
 
01:59:33.229 --> 01:59:33.239 align:start position:0%
they wanted okay all right but it' be
 
01:59:35.270 --> 01:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
Doc so documented that we were not in
 
01:59:36.510 --> 01:59:36.520 align:start position:0%
concurrence all right thank you thank
 
01:59:40.069 --> 01:59:40.079 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair sure uh further questions
 
01:59:42.310 --> 01:59:42.320 align:start position:0%
um I have one um representative lad
 
01:59:43.750 --> 01:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
maybe you want to touch on I think that
 
01:59:47.629 --> 01:59:47.639 align:start position:0%
there's new um procedure in place for
 
01:59:50.910 --> 01:59:50.920 align:start position:0%
policy committee review of rules also
 
01:59:54.310 --> 01:59:54.320 align:start position:0%
generally yes you know the you know how
 
01:59:57.669 --> 01:59:57.679 align:start position:0%
rules are made by put together by the uh
 
01:59:59.550 --> 01:59:59.560 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education in our regard
 
02:00:03.830 --> 02:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
right here by any Bureau uh uh uh agency
 
02:00:06.709 --> 02:00:06.719 align:start position:0%
Etc does the same thing those rules go
 
02:00:08.390 --> 02:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
to hearing and go through the process
 
02:00:11.470 --> 02:00:11.480 align:start position:0%
just like we do hearings here they come
 
02:00:14.950 --> 02:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
back to the state board and but they
 
02:00:17.870 --> 02:00:17.880 align:start position:0%
have to also pass their rule proposals
 
02:00:20.390 --> 02:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
those Draft rules to Jael car The Joint
 
02:00:22.030 --> 02:00:22.040 align:start position:0%
legislative committee administrative
 
02:00:25.470 --> 02:00:25.480 align:start position:0%
rules which then looks at that and their
 
02:00:27.550 --> 02:00:27.560 align:start position:0%
responsibility and the committee that we
 
02:00:30.390 --> 02:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
now have is to when they bring that
 
02:00:34.189 --> 02:00:34.199 align:start position:0%
forward any changes must now go to the
 
02:00:35.669 --> 02:00:35.679 align:start position:0%
Joint legislative committee and
 
02:00:37.430 --> 02:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
administrative rules committee that we
 
02:00:39.709 --> 02:00:39.719 align:start position:0%
have to ensure that the intent of the
 
02:00:43.189 --> 02:00:43.199 align:start position:0%
law the that they're putting together
 
02:00:46.629 --> 02:00:46.639 align:start position:0%
rules that parallel what we have in law
 
02:00:49.149 --> 02:00:49.159 align:start position:0%
it's for example remember some of you
 
02:00:51.510 --> 02:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
May when we would put together that we
 
02:00:54.030 --> 02:00:54.040 align:start position:0%
were requiring four years of mathematics
 
02:00:56.589 --> 02:00:56.599 align:start position:0%
instruction in high schools three years
 
02:00:59.510 --> 02:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
are required credits but the fourth year
 
02:01:02.189 --> 02:01:02.199 align:start position:0%
is one where it's embedded it's embedded
 
02:01:05.189 --> 02:01:05.199 align:start position:0%
in a course which is approved by a local
 
02:01:05.199 --> 02:01:06.790 align:start position:0%
in a course which is approved by a local
school

02:01:06.790 --> 02:01:06.800 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:01:09.390 --> 02:01:09.400 align:start position:0%
board when they make the rules they
 
02:01:11.229 --> 02:01:11.239 align:start position:0%
would then have to make sure that the
 
02:01:13.550 --> 02:01:13.560 align:start position:0%
language which we have in statute is
 
02:01:18.270 --> 02:01:18.280 align:start position:0%
also reflective in rules they did that
 
02:01:20.350 --> 02:01:20.360 align:start position:0%
uh many times so when we write
 
02:01:22.830 --> 02:01:22.840 align:start position:0%
legislation we don't write it
 
02:01:24.950 --> 02:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
specifically uh and we leave a lot of
 
02:01:29.310 --> 02:01:29.320 align:start position:0%
room for the the State Board to make
 
02:01:34.069 --> 02:01:34.079 align:start position:0%
rules of how to implement that um
 
02:01:36.750 --> 02:01:36.760 align:start position:0%
so that's the time that it has to come
 
02:01:38.390 --> 02:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
back to us and say is that being
 
02:01:41.189 --> 02:01:41.199 align:start position:0%
implemented in with paralleling the
 
02:01:45.109 --> 02:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
intent and what we see as the the
 
02:01:47.709 --> 02:01:47.719 align:start position:0%
rationale for that particular law that
 
02:01:50.589 --> 02:01:50.599 align:start position:0%
we put in place that's important that we
 
02:01:53.550 --> 02:01:53.560 align:start position:0%
now have that option we have these rules
 
02:01:57.430 --> 02:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
306 will have to come back to the that
 
02:01:58.870 --> 02:01:58.880 align:start position:0%
committee you're talking about that we
 
02:02:01.550 --> 02:02:01.560 align:start position:0%
set up this year between the ranking
 
02:02:04.430 --> 02:02:04.440 align:start position:0%
leader in the house and the speaker sat
 
02:02:05.910 --> 02:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
down and said yes we're going to have
 
02:02:08.229 --> 02:02:08.239 align:start position:0%
this committee Jael car was getting so
 
02:02:10.830 --> 02:02:10.840 align:start position:0%
much coming to them that the
 
02:02:13.550 --> 02:02:13.560 align:start position:0%
representatives on Jael car may have
 
02:02:15.350 --> 02:02:15.360 align:start position:0%
come from Ways and Means or may have
 
02:02:18.709 --> 02:02:18.719 align:start position:0%
come from uh egg or another committee
 
02:02:20.709 --> 02:02:20.719 align:start position:0%
they didn't know what was going on in
 
02:02:23.149 --> 02:02:23.159 align:start position:0%
education so things were slipping
 
02:02:29.109 --> 02:02:29.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:31.709 --> 02:02:31.719 align:start position:0%
have yes represent
 
02:02:34.189 --> 02:02:34.199 align:start position:0%
D thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
02:02:35.310 --> 02:02:35.320 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
02:02:39.629 --> 02:02:39.639 align:start position:0%
question could you inform us about the
 
02:02:42.830 --> 02:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
current timeline for the review of the
 
02:02:45.510 --> 02:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
minimum standards and the specifics of
 
02:02:47.709 --> 02:02:47.719 align:start position:0%
where that process is at
 
02:02:50.030 --> 02:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
please I don't work for the Department
 
02:02:52.790 --> 02:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
nor the state board of education however
 
02:02:56.390 --> 02:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
they we have been told that
 
02:02:58.790 --> 02:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
they they did all the
 
02:03:01.790 --> 02:03:01.800 align:start position:0%
hearings and there were there's rumor at
 
02:03:03.149 --> 02:03:03.159 align:start position:0%
one point in time that they were going
 
02:03:05.390 --> 02:03:05.400 align:start position:0%
to adopt those rules in November they
 
02:03:08.550 --> 02:03:08.560 align:start position:0%
did not uh we were informed that by Mr
 
02:03:10.750 --> 02:03:10.760 align:start position:0%
Green when he came here to the committee
 
02:03:13.189 --> 02:03:13.199 align:start position:0%
I I do not know the specific date in
 
02:03:14.950 --> 02:03:14.960 align:start position:0%
which they're going to be doing that
 
02:03:17.950 --> 02:03:17.960 align:start position:0%
those rules will come forward uh but I'm
 
02:03:21.790 --> 02:03:21.800 align:start position:0%
sure that if we have uh Miss Fenton here
 
02:03:23.390 --> 02:03:23.400 align:start position:0%
behind me I
 
02:03:27.109 --> 02:03:27.119 align:start position:0%
think yeah she's here and she'll get
 
02:03:29.270 --> 02:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
elevated to Colonel if she can give us
 
02:03:30.910 --> 02:03:30.920 align:start position:0%
the answer
 
02:03:33.709 --> 02:03:33.719 align:start position:0%
that later
 
02:03:37.270 --> 02:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
on any for yes representative luno so
 
02:03:39.589 --> 02:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thanks for uh for
 
02:03:41.189 --> 02:03:41.199 align:start position:0%
for bringing this one forward
 
02:03:44.030 --> 02:03:44.040 align:start position:0%
representative lad would um would it be
 
02:03:47.149 --> 02:03:47.159 align:start position:0%
fair to sort of call this um Bill a
 
02:03:51.149 --> 02:03:51.159 align:start position:0%
housekeeping bill as as it already says
 
02:03:53.830 --> 02:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
as you pointed out in 193
 
02:03:57.350 --> 02:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
e2a that um that the uh the State Board
 
02:03:59.750 --> 02:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
shall not amend any existing academic
 
02:04:02.189 --> 02:04:02.199 align:start position:0%
standards and shall not approve any new
 
02:04:04.310 --> 02:04:04.320 align:start position:0%
academic standards without the prior
 
02:04:05.750 --> 02:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
review and recommendation of the
 
02:04:07.549 --> 02:04:07.559 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee
 
02:04:10.790 --> 02:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
established in 193 c8a which is the
 
02:04:13.189 --> 02:04:13.199 align:start position:0%
section of law that this amends so it
 
02:04:15.830 --> 02:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
basically is just clarifying that the
 
02:04:19.149 --> 02:04:19.159 align:start position:0%
State Board can't approve any rules or
 
02:04:22.069 --> 02:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
any any changes to the standards unless
 
02:04:24.350 --> 02:04:24.360 align:start position:0%
the legislative oversight committee
 
02:04:26.950 --> 02:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
reviews and approves those um reviews
 
02:04:29.069 --> 02:04:29.079 align:start position:0%
and recommends those
 
02:04:32.109 --> 02:04:32.119 align:start position:0%
standards and that the charge of the
 
02:04:35.430 --> 02:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee includes
 
02:04:39.629 --> 02:04:39.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:43.549 --> 02:04:43.559 align:start position:0%
standards you're 80% of the way there um
 
02:04:45.430 --> 02:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
this isn't this isn't changing what I'm
 
02:04:49.430 --> 02:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
asking not it's not changing the um the
 
02:04:51.470 --> 02:04:51.480 align:start position:0%
the requirement that the oversight
 
02:04:53.470 --> 02:04:53.480 align:start position:0%
committee review and
 
02:04:56.189 --> 02:04:56.199 align:start position:0%
recommend proposed changes when you and
 
02:04:58.069 --> 02:04:58.079 align:start position:0%
I and others put together the bill where
 
02:05:02.549 --> 02:05:02.559 align:start position:0%
we rewrote the oversight committee right
 
02:05:06.069 --> 02:05:06.079 align:start position:0%
we included academic standards which had
 
02:05:09.510 --> 02:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
been in statute prior to that we never
 
02:05:11.430 --> 02:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
touched upon the area of minimum
 
02:05:13.430 --> 02:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
standards the standards which we go out
 
02:05:15.149 --> 02:05:15.159 align:start position:0%
to approve
 
02:05:17.589 --> 02:05:17.599 align:start position:0%
schools which goes everything from the
 
02:05:20.669 --> 02:05:20.679 align:start position:0%
gamut of you know
 
02:05:23.790 --> 02:05:23.800 align:start position:0%
um professional development and
 
02:05:26.229 --> 02:05:26.239 align:start position:0%
maintenance Casto you know all that it
 
02:05:28.229 --> 02:05:28.239 align:start position:0%
has everything to do with a school we're
 
02:05:31.629 --> 02:05:31.639 align:start position:0%
talking about a specific component here
 
02:05:35.470 --> 02:05:35.480 align:start position:0%
uh within the minimum uh uh standards
 
02:05:37.229 --> 02:05:37.239 align:start position:0%
for public school approval which
 
02:05:40.030 --> 02:05:40.040 align:start position:0%
contains possibly academic
 
02:05:42.549 --> 02:05:42.559 align:start position:0%
standards and that's why it's important
 
02:05:45.149 --> 02:05:45.159 align:start position:0%
that we have the oversight committee
 
02:05:48.709 --> 02:05:48.719 align:start position:0%
looking at both of these issues the the
 
02:05:51.510 --> 02:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
the academic standards which we'll speak
 
02:05:54.830 --> 02:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:57.510 --> 02:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
12:45 ask somebody where those academic
 
02:06:01.310 --> 02:06:01.320 align:start position:0%
standards are located right now and you
 
02:06:04.069 --> 02:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
may have a problem finding them some are
 
02:06:05.669 --> 02:06:05.679 align:start position:0%
in the Frameworks the old Frameworks
 
02:06:07.549 --> 02:06:07.559 align:start position:0%
some are separate standards which have
 
02:06:10.629 --> 02:06:10.639 align:start position:0%
been approved like the uh new gened
 
02:06:13.149 --> 02:06:13.159 align:start position:0%
standards for science the specifically
 
02:06:14.390 --> 02:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
in the
 
02:06:17.950 --> 02:06:17.960 align:start position:0%
online um so we we got to get that part
 
02:06:20.109 --> 02:06:20.119 align:start position:0%
clarified but this part right here I
 
02:06:21.790 --> 02:06:21.800 align:start position:0%
think it's extremely and I think it is
 
02:06:24.709 --> 02:06:24.719 align:start position:0%
more of a it's a technical cleanup that
 
02:06:28.549 --> 02:06:28.559 align:start position:0%
we need to do uh we've had some problems
 
02:06:30.510 --> 02:06:30.520 align:start position:0%
when we're looking at 306 initially
 
02:06:32.030 --> 02:06:32.040 align:start position:0%
saying is this part of our
 
02:06:34.109 --> 02:06:34.119 align:start position:0%
responsibility or not part of our
 
02:06:36.189 --> 02:06:36.199 align:start position:0%
responsibility and we were also looking
 
02:06:38.709 --> 02:06:38.719 align:start position:0%
at that adequacy statute which said yeah
 
02:06:40.750 --> 02:06:40.760 align:start position:0%
it is part of our stat our
 
02:06:42.870 --> 02:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility so what we're trying to
 
02:06:45.870 --> 02:06:45.880 align:start position:0%
re uh replicate in through this process
 
02:06:47.549 --> 02:06:47.559 align:start position:0%
here with the oversight committee I
 
02:06:49.589 --> 02:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
believe is in parallel to what we are
 
02:06:51.750 --> 02:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
required to do in statute right now
 
02:06:54.549 --> 02:06:54.559 align:start position:0%
great great thank you yeah any further
 
02:06:57.109 --> 02:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank you very much
 
02:06:57.119 --> 02:06:58.669 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank you very much
you're

02:06:58.669 --> 02:06:58.679 align:start position:0%
you're
 
02:07:02.109 --> 02:07:02.119 align:start position:0%
welcome uh Christine
 
02:07:04.350 --> 02:07:04.360 align:start position:0%
Downing and I was wondering if maybe you
 
02:07:06.629 --> 02:07:06.639 align:start position:0%
could cut down the length of time that
 
02:07:08.830 --> 02:07:08.840 align:start position:0%
you requested a little bit
 
02:07:13.800 --> 02:07:13.810 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:13.810 --> 02:07:17.510 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:07:17.510 --> 02:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:17.520 --> 02:07:20.109 align:start position:0%
 
you

02:07:20.109 --> 02:07:20.119 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:07:21.709 --> 02:07:21.719 align:start position:0%
thank you committee members for allowing
 
02:07:23.470 --> 02:07:23.480 align:start position:0%
me to speak to you today I'm Christine
 
02:07:26.790 --> 02:07:26.800 align:start position:0%
Downing I reside at 42 Brickyard Road
 
02:07:29.470 --> 02:07:29.480 align:start position:0%
Goan New Hampshire for the past 15
 
02:07:31.790 --> 02:07:31.800 align:start position:0%
months I volunteered to make uh sure the
 
02:07:34.069 --> 02:07:34.079 align:start position:0%
voice of Educators have been considered
 
02:07:36.950 --> 02:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
in the current 306 review process I have
 
02:07:39.589 --> 02:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
battled to make sure transparency and
 
02:07:41.750 --> 02:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
State uh and stakeholders representing
 
02:07:44.229 --> 02:07:44.239 align:start position:0%
all facets of public schools are part of
 
02:07:46.470 --> 02:07:46.480 align:start position:0%
this process when my single voice wasn't
 
02:07:48.750 --> 02:07:48.760 align:start position:0%
enough I sought the power of the press
 
02:07:51.149 --> 02:07:51.159 align:start position:0%
to make this important work public no
 
02:07:54.229 --> 02:07:54.239 align:start position:0%
one citizen should uh who happens to
 
02:07:56.149 --> 02:07:56.159 align:start position:0%
have 30 years of educational experience
 
02:07:57.750 --> 02:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
should have to go through these steps to
 
02:07:59.189 --> 02:07:59.199 align:start position:0%
engage in something that is very
 
02:08:01.470 --> 02:08:01.480 align:start position:0%
Foundation to what defines our Public
 
02:08:04.189 --> 02:08:04.199 align:start position:0%
Schools I applaud representative lad and
 
02:08:06.669 --> 02:08:06.679 align:start position:0%
others for this bill I'm encouraged by
 
02:08:10.270 --> 02:08:10.280 align:start position:0%
the B bipartisan support for this bill I
 
02:08:12.229 --> 02:08:12.239 align:start position:0%
see it as a first step in making any
 
02:08:13.910 --> 02:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
review of the minimum standards for
 
02:08:16.350 --> 02:08:16.360 align:start position:0%
public school approval as transparent
 
02:08:18.950 --> 02:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
and open to stakeholders as possible
 
02:08:21.030 --> 02:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
starting from day one throughout the
 
02:08:26.189 --> 02:08:26.199 align:start position:0%
entire process as RSA 193 E-1 section 2
 
02:08:28.229 --> 02:08:28.239 align:start position:0%
States and adequate education should be
 
02:08:30.950 --> 02:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
provided through an integrated system of
 
02:08:33.270 --> 02:08:33.280 align:start position:0%
shared responsibility between state and
 
02:08:33.280 --> 02:08:34.390 align:start position:0%
shared responsibility between state and
local

02:08:34.390 --> 02:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
local
 
02:08:36.430 --> 02:08:36.440 align:start position:0%
government through much of the current
 
02:08:38.229 --> 02:08:38.239 align:start position:0%
review process this work has been done
 
02:08:40.870 --> 02:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
in a very closed door and non-inclusive
 
02:08:42.950 --> 02:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
manner thus leading to much speculation
 
02:08:45.549 --> 02:08:45.559 align:start position:0%
regarding proposed changes the review
 
02:08:47.390 --> 02:08:47.400 align:start position:0%
process and decisions relative to what
 
02:08:49.510 --> 02:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
changes are put for forth should not
 
02:08:52.229 --> 02:08:52.239 align:start position:0%
rest in the hands of a single person the
 
02:08:54.069 --> 02:08:54.079 align:start position:0%
review process should be accessible to
 
02:08:56.350 --> 02:08:56.360 align:start position:0%
the public and inclusive of stakeholders
 
02:08:59.069 --> 02:08:59.079 align:start position:0%
that represent our Public Schools while
 
02:09:00.830 --> 02:09:00.840 align:start position:0%
I support this first step I would
 
02:09:02.790 --> 02:09:02.800 align:start position:0%
encourage this committee to consider
 
02:09:04.830 --> 02:09:04.840 align:start position:0%
amendments to this bill that would
 
02:09:06.910 --> 02:09:06.920 align:start position:0%
include the establishment of a minimum
 
02:09:09.709 --> 02:09:09.719 align:start position:0%
standards for public school commission
 
02:09:11.950 --> 02:09:11.960 align:start position:0%
this type of commission would parallel
 
02:09:13.990 --> 02:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
and I I want to note before I say this I
 
02:09:16.549 --> 02:09:16.559 align:start position:0%
had no idea that the bill on genocide
 
02:09:18.510 --> 02:09:18.520 align:start position:0%
and Holocaust Education was coming
 
02:09:20.750 --> 02:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
before me but this type of commission
 
02:09:22.510 --> 02:09:22.520 align:start position:0%
would parallel the same purpose and
 
02:09:26.069 --> 02:09:26.079 align:start position:0%
structure that was inserted in RSA 193
 
02:09:30.430 --> 02:09:30.440 align:start position:0%
e2f relative to Holocaust genocide um to
 
02:09:33.549 --> 02:09:33.559 align:start position:0%
Holocaust and genocide education when I
 
02:09:35.589 --> 02:09:35.599 align:start position:0%
conducted educator review sessions on
 
02:09:38.549 --> 02:09:38.559 align:start position:0%
the March 9th 2023 draft of the 306
 
02:09:41.750 --> 02:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
rules The Limited positive feedback I
 
02:09:44.549 --> 02:09:44.559 align:start position:0%
received from Educators was related to
 
02:09:44.559 --> 02:09:47.310 align:start position:0%
received from Educators was related to
section

02:09:47.310 --> 02:09:47.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:50.109 --> 02:09:50.119 align:start position:0%
306-4955 articulate the expectations for
 
02:09:53.310 --> 02:09:53.320 align:start position:0%
Holocaust and genocide education
 
02:09:55.709 --> 02:09:55.719 align:start position:0%
Educators appreciated the clarity of
 
02:09:58.470 --> 02:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
this section I surmise this was because
 
02:10:00.470 --> 02:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
the commission was designed to establish
 
02:10:02.750 --> 02:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
these rules throughout the involvement
 
02:10:05.350 --> 02:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
of key stakeholders the lesson to take
 
02:10:07.390 --> 02:10:07.400 align:start position:0%
away from this model if we want our
 
02:10:09.510 --> 02:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
public schools to be their very best
 
02:10:11.549 --> 02:10:11.559 align:start position:0%
then involves stakeholders who have the
 
02:10:14.830 --> 02:10:14.840 align:start position:0%
biggest impact in making such rules a
 
02:10:18.069 --> 02:10:18.079 align:start position:0%
reality for our students I have drafted
 
02:10:20.350 --> 02:10:20.360 align:start position:0%
uh possible amendments relative to the
 
02:10:22.629 --> 02:10:22.639 align:start position:0%
establishment of a commission I'd be
 
02:10:24.310 --> 02:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
willing to work with representatives to
 
02:10:26.109 --> 02:10:26.119 align:start position:0%
bring forth this idea as part of this
 
02:10:28.990 --> 02:10:29.000 align:start position:0%
bill since my executive semary was
 
02:10:31.549 --> 02:10:31.559 align:start position:0%
released in the Boston Globe in October
 
02:10:33.669 --> 02:10:33.679 align:start position:0%
real conversation about the rules and
 
02:10:35.549 --> 02:10:35.559 align:start position:0%
how to move Public Schools forward have
 
02:10:38.629 --> 02:10:38.639 align:start position:0%
occurred I have facilitated a group of
 
02:10:41.069 --> 02:10:41.079 align:start position:0%
stakeholders through five dayong
 
02:10:43.709 --> 02:10:43.719 align:start position:0%
meetings during November and December
 
02:10:45.990 --> 02:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
with the next one coming this Friday on
 
02:10:48.910 --> 02:10:48.920 align:start position:0%
January 12th however it's should not
 
02:10:51.790 --> 02:10:51.800 align:start position:0%
have been this arduous and process void
 
02:10:54.189 --> 02:10:54.199 align:start position:0%
of accessibility and transparency for
 
02:10:56.950 --> 02:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
stakeholders I support this bill and
 
02:10:58.990 --> 02:10:59.000 align:start position:0%
potential amendment that makes it clear
 
02:11:01.709 --> 02:11:01.719 align:start position:0%
that future efforts will be required to
 
02:11:04.069 --> 02:11:04.079 align:start position:0%
be transparent and inclusive for all
 
02:11:06.390 --> 02:11:06.400 align:start position:0%
stakeholders thank you for your time and
 
02:11:09.510 --> 02:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
attention and I will entertain questions
 
02:11:12.030 --> 02:11:12.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh representative
 
02:11:15.790 --> 02:11:15.800 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
02:11:18.310 --> 02:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
being here and for your ongoing work to
 
02:11:20.629 --> 02:11:20.639 align:start position:0%
address the critical minimum
 
02:11:23.350 --> 02:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
standard I have two questions at least
 
02:11:25.229 --> 02:11:25.239 align:start position:0%
the first one is the same one I asked
 
02:11:27.750 --> 02:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
representative lad can you share with us
 
02:11:31.069 --> 02:11:31.079 align:start position:0%
your understanding of the current rule
 
02:11:32.870 --> 02:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
making process and timeline for the
 
02:11:35.310 --> 02:11:35.320 align:start position:0%
minimum standards please yes repres
 
02:11:37.950 --> 02:11:37.960 align:start position:0%
representative Damon I I can share that
 
02:11:40.629 --> 02:11:40.639 align:start position:0%
um as of a December 22nd meeting that
 
02:11:43.470 --> 02:11:43.480 align:start position:0%
was conducted at Nea New Hampshire um
 
02:11:45.870 --> 02:11:45.880 align:start position:0%
involving myself Mark McLean who's the
 
02:11:47.270 --> 02:11:47.280 align:start position:0%

NCCA Fred bermonte Robert MC glin um and
 
02:12:09.270 --> 02:12:09.280 align:start position:0%
who am I missing Nathan Harris um we met
 
02:12:10.990 --> 02:12:11.000 align:start position:0%
with the commissioner and proposed a
 
02:12:13.189 --> 02:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
timeline he had also come back to us and
 
02:12:15.510 --> 02:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
said that we needed to be ready to go to
 
02:12:17.510 --> 02:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
present a draft for the February board
 
02:12:18.870 --> 02:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
meeting it's my understanding the
 
02:12:20.950 --> 02:12:20.960 align:start position:0%
February 8th board meeting has been
 
02:12:23.149 --> 02:12:23.159 align:start position:0%
adjusted to the February 15th board
 
02:12:25.069 --> 02:12:25.079 align:start position:0%
meeting I believe it's at this board
 
02:12:28.350 --> 02:12:28.360 align:start position:0%
meeting the rules will be unted um and
 
02:12:30.109 --> 02:12:30.119 align:start position:0%
is likely from that point they will
 
02:12:33.030 --> 02:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
enter into their rul making phase and at
 
02:12:34.790 --> 02:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
that point I believe a public hearing
 
02:12:37.030 --> 02:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
will need to be held within 45 days but
 
02:12:39.669 --> 02:12:39.679 align:start position:0%
I'm sure miss Fenton uh can confirm for
 
02:12:43.870 --> 02:12:43.880 align:start position:0%
us that um our group has been giving uh
 
02:12:47.589 --> 02:12:47.599 align:start position:0%
has been given a 4mon period of time uh
 
02:12:50.709 --> 02:12:50.719 align:start position:0%
to conduct educator review sessions of
 
02:12:52.950 --> 02:12:52.960 align:start position:0%
the content areas specifically in the
 
02:12:56.750 --> 02:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
rules that's sections 31 through 48 of
 
02:12:59.030 --> 02:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
the rules those are all the areas that
 
02:13:02.030 --> 02:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
representative lad alluded to Define um
 
02:13:04.069 --> 02:13:04.079 align:start position:0%
what makes an adequate education so we
 
02:13:06.390 --> 02:13:06.400 align:start position:0%
are working very quickly to build
 
02:13:08.549 --> 02:13:08.559 align:start position:0%
educator review sessions throughout the
 
02:13:10.950 --> 02:13:10.960 align:start position:0%
state we are trying to do this in the
 
02:13:13.629 --> 02:13:13.639 align:start position:0%
five different regions of the state um
 
02:13:15.669 --> 02:13:15.679 align:start position:0%
and have representative Educators from
 
02:13:17.669 --> 02:13:17.679 align:start position:0%
elementary middle and high school levels
 
02:13:19.990 --> 02:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
to review the content areas there's been
 
02:13:22.830 --> 02:13:22.840 align:start position:0%
much discussion in our work about what
 
02:13:26.189 --> 02:13:26.199 align:start position:0%
needs to ret be retained in those areas
 
02:13:28.270 --> 02:13:28.280 align:start position:0%
um because there's discussion around are
 
02:13:30.669 --> 02:13:30.679 align:start position:0%
the academic content standards that
 
02:13:32.950 --> 02:13:32.960 align:start position:0%
exist this the state level enough to
 
02:13:35.430 --> 02:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
Define what should occur in those for to
 
02:13:38.109 --> 02:13:38.119 align:start position:0%
Define an adequate education um and we
 
02:13:40.510 --> 02:13:40.520 align:start position:0%
don't have complete consensus among our
 
02:13:44.350 --> 02:13:44.360 align:start position:0%
group um and so we felt as none of us
 
02:13:46.669 --> 02:13:46.679 align:start position:0%
are practitioners in these particular
 
02:13:48.589 --> 02:13:48.599 align:start position:0%
content areas that we need the voices of
 
02:13:51.430 --> 02:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
our Educators to get good feedback um
 
02:13:53.910 --> 02:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
our goal is to put forth recommendations
 
02:13:57.189 --> 02:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
by April 30th to the commissioner which
 
02:13:59.109 --> 02:13:59.119 align:start position:0%
then can be brought to the state board
 
02:14:01.030 --> 02:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
that is my working knowledge of the
 
02:14:05.669 --> 02:14:05.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:07.669 --> 02:14:07.679 align:start position:0%
April thank
 
02:14:11.589 --> 02:14:11.599 align:start position:0%
you so quite frankly is that four Monon
 
02:14:13.950 --> 02:14:13.960 align:start position:0%
timeline less than that from now till
 
02:14:17.030 --> 02:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
April 30th adequate for the work that
 
02:14:18.750 --> 02:14:18.760 align:start position:0%
you have outlined to hear from the
 
02:14:21.750 --> 02:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
stakeholders at elementary middle high
 
02:14:23.510 --> 02:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
school grade levels in all these content
 
02:14:26.470 --> 02:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
areas and fully report back um
 
02:14:28.669 --> 02:14:28.679 align:start position:0%
professionally speaking it's a tight
 
02:14:31.830 --> 02:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
timeline um I'm not sure it's going to
 
02:14:34.990 --> 02:14:35.000 align:start position:0%
produce the quality feedback we might um
 
02:14:38.189 --> 02:14:38.199 align:start position:0%
have if we could have a full 180 days I
 
02:14:39.629 --> 02:14:39.639 align:start position:0%
understand that if the Board needs to go
 
02:14:43.149 --> 02:14:43.159 align:start position:0%
into Ru making in February then at the
 
02:14:44.950 --> 02:14:44.960 align:start position:0%
you know the maximum amount that it can
 
02:14:48.189 --> 02:14:48.199 align:start position:0%
allow is the 180 days um minimum is 20
 
02:14:50.189 --> 02:14:50.199 align:start position:0%
days from my working knowledge of the
 
02:14:53.589 --> 02:14:53.599 align:start position:0%
process um 180 days from approximately
 
02:14:55.470 --> 02:14:55.480 align:start position:0%
February 15th would put us at August
 
02:14:57.950 --> 02:14:57.960 align:start position:0%
15th it'd be nice to have an assurance
 
02:15:00.669 --> 02:15:00.679 align:start position:0%
that we are really not looking at um
 
02:15:03.069 --> 02:15:03.079 align:start position:0%
solidly approving these rules until that
 
02:15:05.549 --> 02:15:05.559 align:start position:0%
August deadline because what's what's
 
02:15:08.830 --> 02:15:08.840 align:start position:0%
going to be rushed is the analysis
 
02:15:10.270 --> 02:15:10.280 align:start position:0%
that's going to need to be done on the
 
02:15:12.189 --> 02:15:12.199 align:start position:0%
feedback of these sessions we're
 
02:15:14.870 --> 02:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
planning these sessions to occur about
 
02:15:17.109 --> 02:15:17.119 align:start position:0%
middle of February through the end of
 
02:15:19.589 --> 02:15:19.599 align:start position:0%
March keep mind we lose basically two
 
02:15:21.629 --> 02:15:21.639 align:start position:0%
weeks in February because we have a
 
02:15:23.470 --> 02:15:23.480 align:start position:0%
split state in terms of when everybody
 
02:15:26.189 --> 02:15:26.199 align:start position:0%
takes their February Vacations so we're
 
02:15:28.510 --> 02:15:28.520 align:start position:0%
we're working very quickly my goal is to
 
02:15:30.189 --> 02:15:30.199 align:start position:0%
have the announcement and registrations
 
02:15:32.149 --> 02:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
for these sessions out by the end of
 
02:15:34.549 --> 02:15:34.559 align:start position:0%
this week registrations for those will
 
02:15:37.270 --> 02:15:37.280 align:start position:0%
close on February 2nd um and sessions
 
02:15:39.229 --> 02:15:39.239 align:start position:0%
will start on February 12th so we're
 
02:15:41.750 --> 02:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
moving pretty quickly in trying to get
 
02:15:44.549 --> 02:15:44.559 align:start position:0%
the voice of the Educators in um
 
02:15:47.109 --> 02:15:47.119 align:start position:0%
producing um standards Within These
 
02:15:49.629 --> 02:15:49.639 align:start position:0%
content areas May um that that need to
 
02:15:51.510 --> 02:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
do the job they should do which is to
 
02:15:53.229 --> 02:15:53.239 align:start position:0%
ensure we have a high quality adequate
 
02:15:55.669 --> 02:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
education in the state of New Hampshire
 
02:15:57.109 --> 02:15:57.119 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions
 
02:15:59.549 --> 02:15:59.559 align:start position:0%
representative luno so thank you very
 
02:16:01.189 --> 02:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
much Mr chair thank you very much M
 
02:16:04.030 --> 02:16:04.040 align:start position:0%
Downing for joining us this morning so
 
02:16:06.430 --> 02:16:06.440 align:start position:0%
um am I hearing you am I hearing this
 
02:16:10.549 --> 02:16:10.559 align:start position:0%
right then that that it sounds like the
 
02:16:12.430 --> 02:16:12.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner and the State Board of
 
02:16:16.549 --> 02:16:16.559 align:start position:0%
Education are trying to move through the
 
02:16:18.510 --> 02:16:18.520 align:start position:0%
um the proposed
 
02:16:20.790 --> 02:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
minimum standard uh changes to the
 
02:16:25.030 --> 02:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
minimum standards um despite the fact
 
02:16:26.830 --> 02:16:26.840 align:start position:0%
that we have House Bill
 
02:16:30.270 --> 02:16:30.280 align:start position:0%
1163 in consideration right now and to
 
02:16:33.230 --> 02:16:33.240 align:start position:0%
get those minimum standards approved by
 
02:16:34.870 --> 02:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
the state board
 
02:16:40.150 --> 02:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:43.709 --> 02:16:43.719 align:start position:0%
1163 could be considered and signed into
 
02:16:46.349 --> 02:16:46.359 align:start position:0%
law I can't speculate on the state board
 
02:16:48.190 --> 02:16:48.200 align:start position:0%
or the commissioner or their intentions
 
02:16:49.790 --> 02:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
I do know there is concern about the
 
02:16:49.800 --> 02:16:50.830 align:start position:0%
I do know there is concern about the
rules

02:16:50.830 --> 02:16:50.840 align:start position:0%
rules
 
02:16:52.950 --> 02:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
expiring um and I believe there are
 
02:16:55.030 --> 02:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
other recourses in place that can that
 
02:16:57.950 --> 02:16:57.960 align:start position:0%
can adjust that concern versus trying to
 
02:17:00.750 --> 02:17:00.760 align:start position:0%
move very quickly um in getting these
 
02:17:03.830 --> 02:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
through um the sense that our team has
 
02:17:06.469 --> 02:17:06.479 align:start position:0%
been given is that we really need to get
 
02:17:10.389 --> 02:17:10.399 align:start position:0%
things moving um and because I again
 
02:17:12.110 --> 02:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
maybe we rely on Miss Fenton to let us
 
02:17:14.750 --> 02:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
know exactly when the rules are expiring
 
02:17:17.150 --> 02:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
and those expiration dates but I I think
 
02:17:18.790 --> 02:17:18.800 align:start position:0%
all along there's been a sense that
 
02:17:21.750 --> 02:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
March 2024 is a target date for these
 
02:17:24.150 --> 02:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
rules um and given that they did go to
 
02:17:26.709 --> 02:17:26.719 align:start position:0%
the board and they got tabled um and
 
02:17:28.950 --> 02:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
they've been you know discussed um in
 
02:17:30.950 --> 02:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
terms of being tabled in the last few
 
02:17:33.070 --> 02:17:33.080 align:start position:0%
months I couldn't really represented
 
02:17:35.230 --> 02:17:35.240 align:start position:0%
luno begin to speculate you know what
 
02:17:36.910 --> 02:17:36.920 align:start position:0%
the intentions of the commissioner or
 
02:17:39.070 --> 02:17:39.080 align:start position:0%
the State Board are I I'm simply
 
02:17:40.990 --> 02:17:41.000 align:start position:0%
involved in this process to make sure we
 
02:17:43.150 --> 02:17:43.160 align:start position:0%
have the best standards possible for our
 
02:17:44.910 --> 02:17:44.920 align:start position:0%
public schools and ultimately our public
 
02:17:47.070 --> 02:17:47.080 align:start position:0%
school students um and I think the way
 
02:17:49.589 --> 02:17:49.599 align:start position:0%
to do that and I think the Holocaust and
 
02:17:52.389 --> 02:17:52.399 align:start position:0%
genocide is a perfect model is if we
 
02:17:54.230 --> 02:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
want the best rules possible let's bring
 
02:17:56.110 --> 02:17:56.120 align:start position:0%
the stakeholders to the table and that's
 
02:17:58.790 --> 02:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
why I've offered today the consideration
 
02:18:01.190 --> 02:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
of an amendment to form a commission so
 
02:18:02.910 --> 02:18:02.920 align:start position:0%
that what has occurred in this last
 
02:18:04.950 --> 02:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
review process doesn't have the
 
02:18:07.549 --> 02:18:07.559 align:start position:0%
opportunity to occur in the future which
 
02:18:09.549 --> 02:18:09.559 align:start position:0%
basically would eliminate these going
 
02:18:12.830 --> 02:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
out to some soul soul Source contract
 
02:18:14.629 --> 02:18:14.639 align:start position:0%
and that this actually becomes the
 
02:18:16.950 --> 02:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
direct responsibility of the Department
 
02:18:18.750 --> 02:18:18.760 align:start position:0%
of Education I did work for the
 
02:18:20.589 --> 02:18:20.599 align:start position:0%
Department of Education through multiple
 
02:18:24.950 --> 02:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
roles um in the mid 2000s through about
 
02:18:27.429 --> 02:18:27.439 align:start position:0%
2012 um and and it was part of my
 
02:18:29.429 --> 02:18:29.439 align:start position:0%
function as mathematics consultant at
 
02:18:31.549 --> 02:18:31.559 align:start position:0%
the department at that time to run
 
02:18:33.750 --> 02:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
educator reviews of our rules whenever
 
02:18:36.509 --> 02:18:36.519 align:start position:0%
we needed to adjust or change them um
 
02:18:38.150 --> 02:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
and the fact that this process was
 
02:18:40.830 --> 02:18:40.840 align:start position:0%
devoid of that for so long was very
 
02:18:44.429 --> 02:18:44.439 align:start position:0%
concerning to me um so I can't speculate
 
02:18:45.429 --> 02:18:45.439 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
02:18:47.549 --> 02:18:47.559 align:start position:0%
much I've seen no further question
 
02:18:51.870 --> 02:18:51.880 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much and uh
 
02:18:51.880 --> 02:18:57.750 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much and uh
representative

02:18:57.750 --> 02:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:01.070 --> 02:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
lad a as the prime sponsor of this bill
 
02:19:02.549 --> 02:19:02.559 align:start position:0%
the only sponsor of the
 
02:19:04.950 --> 02:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
bill I think we got to walk back a
 
02:19:07.709 --> 02:19:07.719 align:start position:0%
number of years to the last time the Ed
 
02:19:11.190 --> 02:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
306 rules were attempted to be
 
02:19:14.910 --> 02:19:14.920 align:start position:0%
changed back then the proposed under the
 
02:19:18.190 --> 02:19:18.200 align:start position:0%
previous commissioner Jenny Barry
 
02:19:20.309 --> 02:19:20.319 align:start position:0%
they came forward too I was on Jael car
 
02:19:23.270 --> 02:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
at the time and the rules which you see
 
02:19:24.549 --> 02:19:24.559 align:start position:0%
on the sheet I handed out to you where
 
02:19:26.750 --> 02:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
it says
 
02:19:31.790 --> 02:19:31.800 align:start position:0%
83631 and then 37.4 Etc all had a one
 
02:19:35.509 --> 02:19:35.519 align:start position:0%
after them they were modifying these
 
02:19:38.709 --> 02:19:38.719 align:start position:0%
rules so you had 306
 
02:19:43.709 --> 02:19:43.719 align:start position:0%
311 if you look in the 306 rule handbook
 
02:19:45.509 --> 02:19:45.519 align:start position:0%
you have or that was provided you will
 
02:19:49.469 --> 02:19:49.479 align:start position:0%
see that we went for about I can't
 
02:19:51.510 --> 02:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
recall the length of time there was a
 
02:19:54.750 --> 02:19:54.760 align:start position:0%
while a month or two where we had no
 
02:19:57.590 --> 02:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
minimum uh uh approval standards for
 
02:20:00.389 --> 02:20:00.399 align:start position:0%
public schools we ran out of time we
 
02:20:02.950 --> 02:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
have to renew these rules every so often
 
02:20:04.469 --> 02:20:04.479 align:start position:0%
and the new ones because of some of the
 
02:20:06.870 --> 02:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
changes there was just a a complete
 
02:20:09.030 --> 02:20:09.040 align:start position:0%
breakdown in the time frame we ran out
 
02:20:12.590 --> 02:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
the 180 days and there was a time where
 
02:20:15.309 --> 02:20:15.319 align:start position:0%
we had absolutely no rules for a couple
 
02:20:18.230 --> 02:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
weeks there until we got the old rules
 
02:20:20.870 --> 02:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
reinstated which the that's what we have
 
02:20:24.510 --> 02:20:24.520 align:start position:0%
right here so the the process there was
 
02:20:26.469 --> 02:20:26.479 align:start position:0%
a technical advisory put out by the
 
02:20:29.030 --> 02:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner back then I have it up at
 
02:20:31.190 --> 02:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
my chair up there it's something that
 
02:20:33.349 --> 02:20:33.359 align:start position:0%
maybe we can pass out and hand out at
 
02:20:35.150 --> 02:20:35.160 align:start position:0%
when we talk about the next bill which
 
02:20:38.550 --> 02:20:38.560 align:start position:0%
is also the the academic
 
02:20:40.389 --> 02:20:40.399 align:start position:0%
standards thank you very much
 
02:20:42.630 --> 02:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
representative luno thank you Mr chair
 
02:20:44.830 --> 02:20:44.840 align:start position:0%
and and thank you representative lad for
 
02:20:47.389 --> 02:20:47.399 align:start position:0%
uh for you know put putting this in in
 
02:20:51.190 --> 02:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
the context of um of what happened what
 
02:20:54.510 --> 02:20:54.520 align:start position:0%
a decade ago yeah on that what in your
 
02:20:58.309 --> 02:20:58.319 align:start position:0%
experience uh on jlc car do they have
 
02:21:02.950 --> 02:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
the ability to um to to extend uh
 
02:21:06.150 --> 02:21:06.160 align:start position:0%
existing rules um you know
 
02:21:08.830 --> 02:21:08.840 align:start position:0%
pending additional work that like an
 
02:21:11.550 --> 02:21:11.560 align:start position:0%
exception uh they are governed by a time
 
02:21:13.910 --> 02:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
frame we ran out of time back then it's
 
02:21:16.910 --> 02:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
statute that's when the when the rules
 
02:21:19.309 --> 02:21:19.319 align:start position:0%
are adopted by
 
02:21:22.030 --> 02:21:22.040 align:start position:0%
uh by the state
 
02:21:25.790 --> 02:21:25.800 align:start position:0%
board there's a after it's come to yes
 
02:21:28.550 --> 02:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
yes and and the technical advisory
 
02:21:30.070 --> 02:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
explains it pretty well and I think
 
02:21:31.830 --> 02:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
that's what you need to read and see and
 
02:21:34.030 --> 02:21:34.040 align:start position:0%
I I do have that available but but I'm
 
02:21:37.190 --> 02:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
talking specifically about the the the
 
02:21:39.750 --> 02:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
um expiration of the existing minimum
 
02:21:43.230 --> 02:21:43.240 align:start position:0%
standards could those be extended by the
 
02:21:43.240 --> 02:21:45.870 align:start position:0%
standards could those be extended by the
by

02:21:45.870 --> 02:21:45.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:48.910 --> 02:21:48.920 align:start position:0%
jelar if they brought
 
02:21:52.309 --> 02:21:52.319 align:start position:0%
forward I I think I I'm I've been out of
 
02:21:54.110 --> 02:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
jard now for so I'm a little rusty on
 
02:21:55.429 --> 02:21:55.439 align:start position:0%
that one I don't want to say something
 
02:21:59.790 --> 02:21:59.800 align:start position:0%
which is may not be true I know that uh
 
02:22:01.830 --> 02:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
um Diana
 
02:22:04.469 --> 02:22:04.479 align:start position:0%
Fenton has probably should have a good
 
02:22:06.910 --> 02:22:06.920 align:start position:0%
beat on that uh seeing that we've gone
 
02:22:08.910 --> 02:22:08.920 align:start position:0%
through this in Prior years but I think
 
02:22:10.750 --> 02:22:10.760 align:start position:0%
that technical advisory would explain
 
02:22:13.070 --> 02:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
what your asking that I have up front
 
02:22:17.950 --> 02:22:17.960 align:start position:0%
Okay thank you yeah okay represent what
 
02:22:22.270 --> 02:22:22.280 align:start position:0%
quickly please thank you Mr I just one
 
02:22:23.950 --> 02:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
more for my own edification and maybe
 
02:22:25.750 --> 02:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
those who are listening to this that
 
02:22:28.349 --> 02:22:28.359 align:start position:0%
that aren't uh totally clear can you
 
02:22:30.790 --> 02:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
explain a very lay person terms what you
 
02:22:32.030 --> 02:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
mean when you keep on talking about
 
02:22:35.830 --> 02:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
rules and rules as regards
 
02:22:40.110 --> 02:22:40.120 align:start position:0%
this when we pass legislation oftentimes
 
02:22:43.429 --> 02:22:43.439 align:start position:0%
we pass leg legislation that's at quote
 
02:22:45.190 --> 02:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
that 30,000 ft
 
02:22:48.630 --> 02:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
level and then when you have principal
 
02:22:51.950 --> 02:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
Woodcock up in Conway saying well I want
 
02:22:55.630 --> 02:22:55.640 align:start position:0%
to know how to implement that down here
 
02:22:58.469 --> 02:22:58.479 align:start position:0%
and so we give to the department the
 
02:23:01.030 --> 02:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
State Board the responsibility to try
 
02:23:03.590 --> 02:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
and get the the stuff that's in the
 
02:23:06.110 --> 02:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
weeds written out into rules so that you
 
02:23:07.830 --> 02:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
know how you want to operate and what
 
02:23:11.630 --> 02:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
you can or can't do uh so the rules are
 
02:23:13.469 --> 02:23:13.479 align:start position:0%
much like on the federal level we don't
 
02:23:15.750 --> 02:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
call them rules we call them regulations
 
02:23:17.710 --> 02:23:17.720 align:start position:0%
on this level we call them all rules
 
02:23:19.190 --> 02:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
that's basically how you're going to
 
02:23:20.830 --> 02:23:20.840 align:start position:0%
manage how you're going to operate how
 
02:23:22.750 --> 02:23:22.760 align:start position:0%
you're going to make this work how are
 
02:23:26.830 --> 02:23:26.840 align:start position:0%
you going to teach this uh so it's just
 
02:23:29.870 --> 02:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
giving more information to legislation
 
02:23:33.230 --> 02:23:33.240 align:start position:0%
on how it's can be it so it won't have
 
02:23:36.429 --> 02:23:36.439 align:start position:0%
to be interpreted so it it's a little
 
02:23:39.110 --> 02:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
bit more
 
02:23:41.230 --> 02:23:41.240 align:start position:0%
objective thank you thank you
 
02:23:44.349 --> 02:23:44.359 align:start position:0%

03:25:00.750 --> 03:25:00.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire students should know and be
 
03:25:04.670 --> 03:25:04.680 align:start position:0%
able to do in each area of Education the
 
03:25:09.150 --> 03:25:09.160 align:start position:0%
Frameworks do not establish a Statewide
 
03:25:11.269 --> 03:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
curriculum it is the responsibility of
 
03:25:13.990 --> 03:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
local local teachers administrators and
 
03:25:16.469 --> 03:25:16.479 align:start position:0%
school boards to identify and Implement
 
03:25:18.469 --> 03:25:18.479 align:start position:0%
approaches best suited for the students
 
03:25:20.389 --> 03:25:20.399 align:start position:0%
in their communities to acquire the
 
03:25:21.870 --> 03:25:21.880 align:start position:0%
skills and knowledge included in the
 
03:25:24.309 --> 03:25:24.319 align:start position:0%
Frameworks to determine the scope
 
03:25:26.269 --> 03:25:26.279 align:start position:0%
organization's sequence of course
 
03:25:28.830 --> 03:25:28.840 align:start position:0%
offerings and to choose the methods of
 
03:25:31.830 --> 03:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
of instruction uh the activities and the
 
03:25:33.429 --> 03:25:33.439 align:start position:0%
materials to be
 
03:25:36.950 --> 03:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
used what the legislation I'm proposing
 
03:25:40.469 --> 03:25:40.479 align:start position:0%
will take that and put it back into
 
03:25:45.030 --> 03:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
statute now why am I doing that if you
 
03:25:47.269 --> 03:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
look at the other side of that sheet
 
03:25:49.510 --> 03:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
you'll find a little bit of language and
 
03:25:51.790 --> 03:25:51.800 align:start position:0%
and down in the middle of that you'll
 
03:25:55.870 --> 03:25:55.880 align:start position:0%
see A and B why is this legislation
 
03:25:59.110 --> 03:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
needed learning frame Frameworks provide
 
03:26:01.429 --> 03:26:01.439 align:start position:0%
a mechanism for aligning activities and
 
03:26:03.349 --> 03:26:03.359 align:start position:0%
Educational Learning so that they build
 
03:26:07.309 --> 03:26:07.319 align:start position:0%
toward a clearly defined end or goal
 
03:26:09.389 --> 03:26:09.399 align:start position:0%
several times now I've
 
03:26:12.510 --> 03:26:12.520 align:start position:0%
asked where are the acad mic standards
 
03:26:15.429 --> 03:26:15.439 align:start position:0%
for mental health where are the academic
 
03:26:17.710 --> 03:26:17.720 align:start position:0%
standards for social studies and the
 
03:26:20.269 --> 03:26:20.279 align:start position:0%
response is go look at the
 
03:26:22.870 --> 03:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
Frameworks well Frameworks are no longer
 
03:26:26.030 --> 03:26:26.040 align:start position:0%
in statue for one but they do have we do
 
03:26:28.710 --> 03:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
have Frameworks and you can see on the
 
03:26:30.349 --> 03:26:30.359 align:start position:0%
right hand side down on the bottom
 
03:26:32.870 --> 03:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
corner of that page social studies
 
03:26:36.950 --> 03:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:40.550 --> 03:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
2006 the Arts Frameworks designed in
 
03:26:40.560 --> 03:26:42.550 align:start position:0%
2006 the Arts Frameworks designed in
2001

03:26:42.550 --> 03:26:42.560 align:start position:0%
2001
 
03:26:45.189 --> 03:26:45.199 align:start position:0%
the health curriculum Frameworks
 
03:26:47.950 --> 03:26:47.960 align:start position:0%
2003 so I've gone and looked at the
 
03:26:50.429 --> 03:26:50.439 align:start position:0%
social studies curriculum Frameworks I
 
03:26:52.590 --> 03:26:52.600 align:start position:0%
see a lot of nice stuff in there but I'm
 
03:26:54.550 --> 03:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
looking for the academic standards where
 
03:26:56.469 --> 03:26:56.479 align:start position:0%
are the academic
 
03:26:58.870 --> 03:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
standards you got to read through that
 
03:27:01.990 --> 03:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
all thing and assume this is an academic
 
03:27:04.990 --> 03:27:05.000 align:start position:0%
standard and yet we have responsibility
 
03:27:07.150 --> 03:27:07.160 align:start position:0%
for oversight of those academic
 
03:27:08.710 --> 03:27:08.720 align:start position:0%
standards we just talked about that
 
03:27:08.720 --> 03:27:10.150 align:start position:0%
standards we just talked about that
before

03:27:10.150 --> 03:27:10.160 align:start position:0%
before
 
03:27:12.229 --> 03:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
lunch but but then there's other
 
03:27:14.670 --> 03:27:14.680 align:start position:0%
academic standards we have in
 
03:27:17.189 --> 03:27:17.199 align:start position:0%
place the Common Core State math
 
03:27:20.229 --> 03:27:20.239 align:start position:0%
standards they're there the Common Core
 
03:27:21.870 --> 03:27:21.880 align:start position:0%
State Standards for English language
 
03:27:23.670 --> 03:27:23.680 align:start position:0%
arts they're there you can look them
 
03:27:25.830 --> 03:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
right up and the new generation science
 
03:27:27.630 --> 03:27:27.640 align:start position:0%
standards are there as well you can look
 
03:27:30.950 --> 03:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
in the in the doe website and find them
 
03:27:33.950 --> 03:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
but there's just a it's it's
 
03:27:36.590 --> 03:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
discombobulated it's there's no real
 
03:27:40.750 --> 03:27:40.760 align:start position:0%
good strong routine for us to find out
 
03:27:42.790 --> 03:27:42.800 align:start position:0%
what are the the academic
 
03:27:45.870 --> 03:27:45.880 align:start position:0%
standards and this is important if you
 
03:27:47.710 --> 03:27:47.720 align:start position:0%
look at the upper right hand side of
 
03:27:49.189 --> 03:27:49.199 align:start position:0%
that sheet of
 
03:27:52.830 --> 03:27:52.840 align:start position:0%
paper I have boxed areas curriculum
 
03:27:54.349 --> 03:27:54.359 align:start position:0%
instruction and
 
03:27:57.630 --> 03:27:57.640 align:start position:0%
assessment how's a new teacher ever
 
03:28:00.389 --> 03:28:00.399 align:start position:0%
know what they're going to put in this
 
03:28:03.110 --> 03:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
curriculum or how they're going to
 
03:28:05.870 --> 03:28:05.880 align:start position:0%
teach but they sure know that the
 
03:28:09.990 --> 03:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
Statewide assessment is going to assess
 
03:28:13.030 --> 03:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
them and do we have a real good strong
 
03:28:14.950 --> 03:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
understanding that all three of those
 
03:28:16.590 --> 03:28:16.600 align:start position:0%
areas are
 
03:28:18.550 --> 03:28:18.560 align:start position:0%
aligned if what happens if the
 
03:28:21.429 --> 03:28:21.439 align:start position:0%
curriculum it's being taught was way off
 
03:28:23.150 --> 03:28:23.160 align:start position:0%
to the right or way off to the left
 
03:28:27.030 --> 03:28:27.040 align:start position:0%
somewhere on that flowchart so then your
 
03:28:29.550 --> 03:28:29.560 align:start position:0%
instruction may be echoing that
 
03:28:31.349 --> 03:28:31.359 align:start position:0%
curriculum you identified locally but
 
03:28:34.070 --> 03:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
the Statewide test may be way over here
 
03:28:37.309 --> 03:28:37.319 align:start position:0%
and not assessing what has been taught
 
03:28:39.990 --> 03:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
in the classroom that school district
 
03:28:41.469 --> 03:28:41.479 align:start position:0%
may receive a real negative ative
 
03:28:41.479 --> 03:28:42.590 align:start position:0%
may receive a real negative ative
achievement

03:28:42.590 --> 03:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
achievement
 
03:28:45.150 --> 03:28:45.160 align:start position:0%
score because we're assessing something
 
03:28:48.189 --> 03:28:48.199 align:start position:0%
that may not be taught or the curriculum
 
03:28:50.630 --> 03:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
standards our academic
 
03:28:54.870 --> 03:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
standards may be very uh not well
 
03:28:57.710 --> 03:28:57.720 align:start position:0%
described or stated what a child should
 
03:29:01.110 --> 03:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
know and be able to do some areas we put
 
03:29:03.150 --> 03:29:03.160 align:start position:0%
clearly in the statute not clearly in
 
03:29:04.990 --> 03:29:05.000 align:start position:0%
the statute but we put in things like in
 
03:29:07.790 --> 03:29:07.800 align:start position:0%
social studies topical areas that should
 
03:29:10.469 --> 03:29:10.479 align:start position:0%
be taught those are really not academic
 
03:29:13.150 --> 03:29:13.160 align:start position:0%
standards but topical areas so it should
 
03:29:15.429 --> 03:29:15.439 align:start position:0%
be clear that instruction should somehow
 
03:29:17.710 --> 03:29:17.720 align:start position:0%
Echo that and the assessment if there
 
03:29:19.349 --> 03:29:19.359 align:start position:0%
was a social studies assessment
 
03:29:23.590 --> 03:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
Statewide would have to Echo that um so
 
03:29:24.910 --> 03:29:24.920 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm real
 
03:29:28.469 --> 03:29:28.479 align:start position:0%
concerns concerned that Frank Frameworks
 
03:29:31.269 --> 03:29:31.279 align:start position:0%
support school districts especially
 
03:29:32.870 --> 03:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
those that do not have curriculum
 
03:29:35.510 --> 03:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
development staff I've worked in
 
03:29:37.830 --> 03:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
districts where curriculum is basically
 
03:29:40.790 --> 03:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
basically designed in a small school
 
03:29:42.910 --> 03:29:42.920 align:start position:0%
school may only have 150
 
03:29:46.070 --> 03:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
kids and the curriculum may be that of
 
03:29:48.670 --> 03:29:48.680 align:start position:0%
the teacher that's been there for
 
03:29:52.469 --> 03:29:52.479 align:start position:0%
ages and this is what they're
 
03:29:55.189 --> 03:29:55.199 align:start position:0%
teaching yet the assessment tool might
 
03:29:56.710 --> 03:29:56.720 align:start position:0%
be totally
 
03:29:58.750 --> 03:29:58.760 align:start position:0%
different and there's a lot of different
 
03:30:01.590 --> 03:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
ways of assessing there's formative
 
03:30:04.189 --> 03:30:04.199 align:start position:0%
tests and summ of the tests while we're
 
03:30:06.150 --> 03:30:06.160 align:start position:0%
assessing our curriculum is with this
 
03:30:06.160 --> 03:30:07.750 align:start position:0%
assessing our curriculum is with this
summative

03:30:07.750 --> 03:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
summative
 
03:30:10.309 --> 03:30:10.319 align:start position:0%
test and it really is not like some of
 
03:30:11.750 --> 03:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
the old if you look at some of the old
 
03:30:13.150 --> 03:30:13.160 align:start position:0%
textbooks they usually said a pre- test
 
03:30:16.150 --> 03:30:16.160 align:start position:0%
a post test chapter test Etc and I'm not
 
03:30:18.910 --> 03:30:18.920 align:start position:0%
saying I'm infatuated with that process
 
03:30:22.950 --> 03:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
but you need a a AUM a formative test
 
03:30:25.030 --> 03:30:25.040 align:start position:0%
which is more Diagnostic in nature which
 
03:30:26.910 --> 03:30:26.920 align:start position:0%
will help people understand where I got
 
03:30:28.750 --> 03:30:28.760 align:start position:0%
to go where the child needs to learn
 
03:30:30.710 --> 03:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
where I have missed the boat where the
 
03:30:32.309 --> 03:30:32.319 align:start position:0%
child's missed the
 
03:30:35.429 --> 03:30:35.439 align:start position:0%
boat these Frameworks also offer
 
03:30:37.750 --> 03:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
instructional approaches which is
 
03:30:42.030 --> 03:30:42.040 align:start position:0%
important two staff if I were a new
 
03:30:43.790 --> 03:30:43.800 align:start position:0%
social studies teacher coming into a
 
03:30:45.710 --> 03:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
school and asked to teach seventh grade
 
03:30:47.510 --> 03:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
social studies or sixth or fifth
 
03:30:49.670 --> 03:30:49.680 align:start position:0%
whatever I'd want to have something to
 
03:30:51.790 --> 03:30:51.800 align:start position:0%
reference is there a guideline there and
 
03:30:54.189 --> 03:30:54.199 align:start position:0%
that's what these Frameworks do they
 
03:30:58.189 --> 03:30:58.199 align:start position:0%
provide a guideline for staff on on on
 
03:31:00.670 --> 03:31:00.680 align:start position:0%
ideas of how to teach what the scope is
 
03:31:02.670 --> 03:31:02.680 align:start position:0%
going to be of skills what the sequence
 
03:31:05.910 --> 03:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
is going to be and it's
 
03:31:09.189 --> 03:31:09.199 align:start position:0%
coordinated and it's coordinated between
 
03:31:11.150 --> 03:31:11.160 align:start position:0%
all those which are teaching that
 
03:31:13.990 --> 03:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
studies within that school or School
 
03:31:18.469 --> 03:31:18.479 align:start position:0%
District so I'm I'm suggesting that we
 
03:31:21.910 --> 03:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
put the Frameworks back into place and
 
03:31:24.030 --> 03:31:24.040 align:start position:0%
we use these curriculum Frameworks as a
 
03:31:26.630 --> 03:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
guide to help instruction and to help
 
03:31:29.110 --> 03:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
coordinate instruction in the schools
 
03:31:31.590 --> 03:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
and throughout this state we've missed
 
03:31:34.550 --> 03:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
the boat we and I in a way want to
 
03:31:37.389 --> 03:31:37.399 align:start position:0%
apologize too when I came in here I was
 
03:31:39.750 --> 03:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
all for getting rid of the curriculum
 
03:31:42.590 --> 03:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
Frameworks I look back over my time and
 
03:31:45.910 --> 03:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
I say wow maybe it's because I came from
 
03:31:48.630 --> 03:31:48.640 align:start position:0%
a district that had curriculum directors
 
03:31:52.309 --> 03:31:52.319 align:start position:0%
and staff there I came from a district
 
03:31:54.510 --> 03:31:54.520 align:start position:0%
up in Alaska which the curriculum
 
03:31:56.269 --> 03:31:56.279 align:start position:0%
headquarters of the size of this
 
03:31:58.429 --> 03:31:58.439 align:start position:0%
building and there was support in just
 
03:32:00.710 --> 03:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
about every angle of instruction and
 
03:32:02.950 --> 03:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
curriculum you could believe and right
 
03:32:05.429 --> 03:32:05.439 align:start position:0%
down into Media
 
03:32:08.990 --> 03:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
Services and so I felt very comfortable
 
03:32:11.910 --> 03:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
in in in working there seeing that we
 
03:32:14.429 --> 03:32:14.439 align:start position:0%
did have a k through 12 scope and
 
03:32:17.550 --> 03:32:17.560 align:start position:0%
sequence and we had materials in support
 
03:32:20.670 --> 03:32:20.680 align:start position:0%
which also supported in professional
 
03:32:23.070 --> 03:32:23.080 align:start position:0%
development along what those academic
 
03:32:27.030 --> 03:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
standards were came down here and it was
 
03:32:28.710 --> 03:32:28.720 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
03:32:32.710 --> 03:32:32.720 align:start position:0%
uh uh discombobulated I'll say the we we
 
03:32:35.189 --> 03:32:35.199 align:start position:0%
have not upgraded our curriculum
 
03:32:37.389 --> 03:32:37.399 align:start position:0%
Frameworks in some of these areas since
 
03:32:38.590 --> 03:32:38.600 align:start position:0%
the early
 
03:32:42.389 --> 03:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
2000s and yet societ has significantly
 
03:32:44.590 --> 03:32:44.600 align:start position:0%
Changed History hasn't changed history
 
03:32:48.469 --> 03:32:48.479 align:start position:0%
is history how we perceive it may change
 
03:32:51.910 --> 03:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
so um I would like to suggest that we
 
03:32:54.110 --> 03:32:54.120 align:start position:0%
integrate the curriculum Frameworks put
 
03:32:57.429 --> 03:32:57.439 align:start position:0%
them back in as uh support of materials
 
03:32:59.510 --> 03:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
for teachers new teachers teachers
 
03:33:01.630 --> 03:33:01.640 align:start position:0%
coming in teachers moving between
 
03:33:04.030 --> 03:33:04.040 align:start position:0%
districts they know what our Statewide
 
03:33:06.429 --> 03:33:06.439 align:start position:0%
Frameworks are so if I move from Hanover
 
03:33:14.229 --> 03:33:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:16.349 --> 03:33:16.359 align:start position:0%
uh I would I would know what the social
 
03:33:18.269 --> 03:33:18.279 align:start position:0%
study requirements are for the state the
 
03:33:20.469 --> 03:33:20.479 align:start position:0%
academic standards and we need to make
 
03:33:22.229 --> 03:33:22.239 align:start position:0%
sure that Within These Frameworks we
 
03:33:26.070 --> 03:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
identify these are the academic
 
03:33:30.110 --> 03:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
standards so all are on the same page
 
03:33:30.120 --> 03:33:31.870 align:start position:0%
standards so all are on the same page
thank

03:33:31.870 --> 03:33:31.880 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:33:36.910 --> 03:33:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:40.030 --> 03:33:40.040 align:start position:0%
questions uh yes representative woodcot
 
03:33:41.870 --> 03:33:41.880 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman I mean chairman
 
03:33:45.830 --> 03:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
cordelli uh chairman the econic just so
 
03:33:48.030 --> 03:33:48.040 align:start position:0%
unclear on this now the standards that
 
03:33:50.189 --> 03:33:50.199 align:start position:0%
you're going to align with the CIA and
 
03:33:51.590 --> 03:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
the op P so the curriculum instruction
 
03:33:53.349 --> 03:33:53.359 align:start position:0%
assessment the standards you're talking
 
03:33:56.110 --> 03:33:56.120 align:start position:0%
about at one point and correctly going
 
03:33:58.750 --> 03:33:58.760 align:start position:0%
stop on go off scale here one point were
 
03:34:01.510 --> 03:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
in the legislation they were they were
 
03:34:03.389 --> 03:34:03.399 align:start position:0%
regulating the law and then they were
 
03:34:06.110 --> 03:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
taken out the same point everything you
 
03:34:11.269 --> 03:34:11.279 align:start position:0%
see on the 2010 there Roman 5
 
03:34:13.189 --> 03:34:13.199 align:start position:0%
has been taken out in terms of
 
03:34:14.990 --> 03:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
curriculum Frameworks they're no longer
 
03:34:16.910 --> 03:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
there okay what we're doing is walking
 
03:34:20.309 --> 03:34:20.319 align:start position:0%
it back to where it was okay may I fall
 
03:34:23.349 --> 03:34:23.359 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you so the new let's
 
03:34:25.870 --> 03:34:25.880 align:start position:0%
assume this pass so the new
 
03:34:29.309 --> 03:34:29.319 align:start position:0%
curriculum uh Frameworks uh scope of
 
03:34:30.910 --> 03:34:30.920 align:start position:0%
sequence will still be left to the local
 
03:34:33.229 --> 03:34:33.239 align:start position:0%
education commun this the Frameworks of
 
03:34:36.189 --> 03:34:36.199 align:start position:0%
what you want youngsters to learn I
 
03:34:38.670 --> 03:34:38.680 align:start position:0%
that's going to be established by
 
03:34:40.710 --> 03:34:40.720 align:start position:0%
whom if you take the curriculum
 
03:34:42.870 --> 03:34:42.880 align:start position:0%
Frameworks which we are using right now
 
03:34:44.870 --> 03:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
we are using them for social studies
 
03:34:46.510 --> 03:34:46.520 align:start position:0%
we're using them for health we're using
 
03:34:49.469 --> 03:34:49.479 align:start position:0%
them for the Arts those were developed
 
03:34:53.070 --> 03:34:53.080 align:start position:0%
by a task force of folks that came from
 
03:34:56.070 --> 03:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
the school districts expertise in these
 
03:34:59.429 --> 03:34:59.439 align:start position:0%
subject areas people from doe came
 
03:35:02.189 --> 03:35:02.199 align:start position:0%
together they wrote These Frameworks
 
03:35:05.030 --> 03:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
okay which then were put in place may I
 
03:35:07.870 --> 03:35:07.880 align:start position:0%
just one more thank you so just falling
 
03:35:10.710 --> 03:35:10.720 align:start position:0%
the same piece so if this passed and
 
03:35:13.550 --> 03:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
there were new Frameworks required um
 
03:35:15.070 --> 03:35:15.080 align:start position:0%
like's say upgrading what these have to
 
03:35:15.080 --> 03:35:15.950 align:start position:0%
like's say upgrading what these have to
be

03:35:15.950 --> 03:35:15.960 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:35:19.189 --> 03:35:19.199 align:start position:0%
okay it won't be legislatively assigned
 
03:35:20.790 --> 03:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
who is going to create the framework
 
03:35:22.229 --> 03:35:22.239 align:start position:0%
that be up to the commissioner or up to
 
03:35:25.349 --> 03:35:25.359 align:start position:0%
doe to decide how they going to do that
 
03:35:26.469 --> 03:35:26.479 align:start position:0%
yeah that that would not be a
 
03:35:28.070 --> 03:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the legislature and
 
03:35:30.030 --> 03:35:30.040 align:start position:0%
you need no rules to do that that would
 
03:35:32.030 --> 03:35:32.040 align:start position:0%
be something which done just like we did
 
03:35:33.950 --> 03:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
in the past okay the Committees would be
 
03:35:35.670 --> 03:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
set up through the department all right
 
03:35:38.309 --> 03:35:38.319 align:start position:0%
so okay all right thank you thank you Mr
 
03:35:41.349 --> 03:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
chair any further questions represent
 
03:35:44.030 --> 03:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
know what year were the curriculum
 
03:35:46.269 --> 03:35:46.279 align:start position:0%
Frameworks removed from
 
03:35:50.510 --> 03:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
statute sorry I forgot to um
 
03:35:55.950 --> 03:35:55.960 align:start position:0%
they it was just around 2011
 
03:35:58.910 --> 03:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
2010 because I went you can you can find
 
03:36:00.710 --> 03:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
out by looking at the law books which
 
03:36:03.910 --> 03:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
are in there in the committee room my
 
03:36:05.790 --> 03:36:05.800 align:start position:0%
question I can't remember maybe somebody
 
03:36:08.030 --> 03:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
behind me might recall that but it had
 
03:36:09.510 --> 03:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
to be
 
03:36:13.309 --> 03:36:13.319 align:start position:0%
back uh several years after I it was
 
03:36:17.429 --> 03:36:17.439 align:start position:0%
probably most likely the end of 201 fy11
 
03:36:19.469 --> 03:36:19.479 align:start position:0%
I think was the end of
 
03:36:23.269 --> 03:36:23.279 align:start position:0%
the of the Frameworks being in
 
03:36:27.550 --> 03:36:27.560 align:start position:0%
statute so statute refu ref referred you
 
03:36:31.110 --> 03:36:31.120 align:start position:0%
to those curriculum guidelines but also
 
03:36:34.229 --> 03:36:34.239 align:start position:0%
to the academic standards when I've gone
 
03:36:36.990 --> 03:36:37.000 align:start position:0%
to doe asking where can I find the
 
03:36:40.030 --> 03:36:40.040 align:start position:0%
academic standards for social studies
 
03:36:43.070 --> 03:36:43.080 align:start position:0%
they say look at the
 
03:36:45.189 --> 03:36:45.199 align:start position:0%
Frameworks well technically we don't
 
03:36:47.030 --> 03:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
have any Frameworks that we do those
 
03:36:50.670 --> 03:36:50.680 align:start position:0%
were approved by the state board but if
 
03:36:52.830 --> 03:36:52.840 align:start position:0%
we were to make new
 
03:36:55.510 --> 03:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
ones you should have legislation which
 
03:36:57.790 --> 03:36:57.800 align:start position:0%
supports the need for Frameworks and
 
03:37:03.630 --> 03:37:03.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:06.429 --> 03:37:06.439 align:start position:0%
is yes representative
 
03:37:09.389 --> 03:37:09.399 align:start position:0%
Lake why did they get rid of the
 
03:37:12.030 --> 03:37:12.040 align:start position:0%
Frameworks because there were novices
 
03:37:13.630 --> 03:37:13.640 align:start position:0%
like me that came in and said we don't
 
03:37:17.150 --> 03:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
need them because that can be done
 
03:37:20.950 --> 03:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
locally thank you yeah representative
 
03:37:25.670 --> 03:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
dry thank you representative cardelli
 
03:37:29.790 --> 03:37:29.800 align:start position:0%
um the 2010 talks about the curriculum
 
03:37:34.189 --> 03:37:34.199 align:start position:0%
Frameworks the current edition of 193
 
03:37:36.790 --> 03:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
e2a talks about minimum standards for
 
03:37:39.510 --> 03:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
public approval and your proposal has
 
03:37:42.070 --> 03:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
minimum standard standards for public
 
03:37:44.309 --> 03:37:44.319 align:start position:0%
approval and curriculum Frameworks can
 
03:37:46.389 --> 03:37:46.399 align:start position:0%
you explain to me the difference Min
 
03:37:47.750 --> 03:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
minimum standards for public school
 
03:37:51.229 --> 03:37:51.239 align:start position:0%
approval are not academic standards
 
03:37:53.830 --> 03:37:53.840 align:start position:0%
supposedly there's two remember when we
 
03:37:55.469 --> 03:37:55.479 align:start position:0%
talked about the legislative oversight
 
03:37:58.790 --> 03:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
Committee in the last bill we have
 
03:38:01.750 --> 03:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility for reviewing and having
 
03:38:05.870 --> 03:38:05.880 align:start position:0%
oversight of the academic
 
03:38:08.790 --> 03:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
standards we don't have that Authority
 
03:38:12.150 --> 03:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
we would if that first bill was passed
 
03:38:14.830 --> 03:38:14.840 align:start position:0%
had the responsibility for the uh
 
03:38:16.389 --> 03:38:16.399 align:start position:0%
minimum standards for public school
 
03:38:19.550 --> 03:38:19.560 align:start position:0%
approval they are different and so when
 
03:38:21.510 --> 03:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
they say look at the minimum standards
 
03:38:23.110 --> 03:38:23.120 align:start position:0%
of public school approval to find those
 
03:38:27.269 --> 03:38:27.279 align:start position:0%
academic standards it's just
 
03:38:29.950 --> 03:38:29.960 align:start position:0%
it's the
 
03:38:32.630 --> 03:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
minimum it's confusing and it's more
 
03:38:35.309 --> 03:38:35.319 align:start position:0%
than confusing it's disc combobulated
 
03:38:37.670 --> 03:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
it's uh you know it's saying well
 
03:38:38.790 --> 03:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
because you can't find it there it's
 
03:38:39.830 --> 03:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
over there but you don't have the
 
03:38:42.189 --> 03:38:42.199 align:start position:0%
authority to look at over there you can
 
03:38:44.750 --> 03:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
look over here at the academic standards
 
03:38:48.510 --> 03:38:48.520 align:start position:0%
it it it's it's uh we need to get this
 
03:38:50.830 --> 03:38:50.840 align:start position:0%
process streamlined so it's well
 
03:38:53.469 --> 03:38:53.479 align:start position:0%
understood by people out in the field as
 
03:38:57.309 --> 03:38:57.319 align:start position:0%
well just follow up follow up okay so in
 
03:39:00.229 --> 03:39:00.239 align:start position:0%
in your proposal is curriculum
 
03:39:02.830 --> 03:39:02.840 align:start position:0%
Frameworks kind of an equivalent of
 
03:39:02.840 --> 03:39:06.630 align:start position:0%
Frameworks kind of an equivalent of
academic

03:39:06.630 --> 03:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:11.670 --> 03:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
standards no okay and why I say that is
 
03:39:15.229 --> 03:39:15.239 align:start position:0%
that the curriculum Frameworks are
 
03:39:18.429 --> 03:39:18.439 align:start position:0%
guidelines on how you might conduct your
 
03:39:21.110 --> 03:39:21.120 align:start position:0%
curriculum they are also guidelines that
 
03:39:23.950 --> 03:39:23.960 align:start position:0%
show scope and sequence of how these
 
03:39:27.150 --> 03:39:27.160 align:start position:0%
standards are in how you you follow
 
03:39:28.510 --> 03:39:28.520 align:start position:0%
these standards with skills and
 
03:39:31.389 --> 03:39:31.399 align:start position:0%
knowledge through the grades so the
 
03:39:34.429 --> 03:39:34.439 align:start position:0%
academic standards that's why I said
 
03:39:36.950 --> 03:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
over and over I don't believe the way
 
03:39:38.910 --> 03:39:38.920 align:start position:0%
the curriculum Frameworks are written
 
03:39:42.750 --> 03:39:42.760 align:start position:0%
really identify by the academic
 
03:39:44.990 --> 03:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
standards what are the academic
 
03:39:46.309 --> 03:39:46.319 align:start position:0%
standards I'll ask you right now what
 
03:39:47.910 --> 03:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
are the academic standards for social
 
03:39:50.349 --> 03:39:50.359 align:start position:0%
studies what are the academic standards
 
03:39:52.910 --> 03:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
for for art what are the academic
 
03:39:56.870 --> 03:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
standards for um any subject that's in
 
03:39:59.510 --> 03:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
the adequacy area there now you can tell
 
03:40:01.550 --> 03:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
me that by math and English and language
 
03:40:03.349 --> 03:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
arts because those are those are
 
03:40:05.670 --> 03:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
established we just took the Common Core
 
03:40:08.229 --> 03:40:08.239 align:start position:0%
State Standards for
 
03:40:11.309 --> 03:40:11.319 align:start position:0%
that but the other area
 
03:40:13.630 --> 03:40:13.640 align:start position:0%
I can't tell you if you ask me
 
03:40:16.030 --> 03:40:16.040 align:start position:0%
specifically Rick tell me what the
 
03:40:18.590 --> 03:40:18.600 align:start position:0%
academic standards of social studies are
 
03:40:21.750 --> 03:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
civics government economics geography
 
03:40:24.710 --> 03:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
history I couldn't tell you and I could
 
03:40:26.590 --> 03:40:26.600 align:start position:0%
not at this point tell you where to go
 
03:40:28.550 --> 03:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
look for
 
03:40:33.630 --> 03:40:33.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:36.670 --> 03:40:36.680 align:start position:0%
know uh represent
 
03:40:39.389 --> 03:40:39.399 align:start position:0%
Tanner thank you um I'm just looking
 
03:40:43.189 --> 03:40:43.199 align:start position:0%
back in the the law book and in
 
03:40:46.590 --> 03:40:46.600 align:start position:0%
2016 uh the word minimum standards were
 
03:40:48.150 --> 03:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
was substituted for curriculum
 
03:40:52.910 --> 03:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
Frameworks okay with 16 then thank
 
03:40:56.070 --> 03:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
you page 56 see that's at the same time
 
03:40:56.080 --> 03:40:56.790 align:start position:0%
you page 56 see that's at the same time
we

03:40:56.790 --> 03:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:41:00.349 --> 03:41:00.359 align:start position:0%
removed the Statewide assessment used to
 
03:41:02.469 --> 03:41:02.479 align:start position:0%
have social studies Incorporated in it
 
03:41:04.110 --> 03:41:04.120 align:start position:0%
but we were never giving a Statewide
 
03:41:06.550 --> 03:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
assessment on social studies so then we
 
03:41:07.870 --> 03:41:07.880 align:start position:0%
said yes it's still part of the
 
03:41:09.830 --> 03:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
Statewide Assessment program but we'll
 
03:41:16.550 --> 03:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:20.189 --> 03:41:20.199 align:start position:0%
district thank you very much Mr chair um
 
03:41:23.550 --> 03:41:23.560 align:start position:0%
so the the the question sort of goes
 
03:41:25.910 --> 03:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
goes back to not the U well it's the
 
03:41:27.630 --> 03:41:27.640 align:start position:0%
language that you've got in the in the
 
03:41:30.670 --> 03:41:30.680 align:start position:0%
bill but also um I think it it pulls
 
03:41:32.870 --> 03:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
from the um the language that you've had
 
03:41:34.550 --> 03:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
in the
 
03:41:39.269 --> 03:41:39.279 align:start position:0%
2020 law book uh where it says uh uh the
 
03:41:41.630 --> 03:41:41.640 align:start position:0%
uh well in the bill bill it's on line 10
 
03:41:43.950 --> 03:41:43.960 align:start position:0%
and 11 lines 10 11 the curriculum
 
03:41:46.070 --> 03:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
framework sh Shall Serve as a guide and
 
03:41:48.389 --> 03:41:48.399 align:start position:0%
reference to what New Hampshire students
 
03:41:51.389 --> 03:41:51.399 align:start position:0%
should know and be able to do in each
 
03:41:54.110 --> 03:41:54.120 align:start position:0%
area of curc and then down at the bottom
 
03:41:56.149 --> 03:41:56.159 align:start position:0%
of page one in the bill it says it
 
03:41:59.309 --> 03:41:59.319 align:start position:0%
defines curriculum framework differently
 
03:42:01.110 --> 03:42:01.120 align:start position:0%
it's not about should know and be able
 
03:42:04.389 --> 03:42:04.399 align:start position:0%
to do it talks about um uh that serves
 
03:42:08.950 --> 03:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:11.710 --> 03:42:11.720 align:start position:0%
instruction so I guess the question is
 
03:42:14.189 --> 03:42:14.199 align:start position:0%
is that is it are we setting a
 
03:42:17.189 --> 03:42:17.199 align:start position:0%
consistent definition for curriculum
 
03:42:21.389 --> 03:42:21.399 align:start position:0%
framework um in here is it an is it an
 
03:42:23.870 --> 03:42:23.880 align:start position:0%
assessment tool or is it an
 
03:42:23.880 --> 03:42:27.229 align:start position:0%
assessment tool or is it an
instruction

03:42:27.229 --> 03:42:27.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:30.269 --> 03:42:30.279 align:start position:0%
tool the curriculum guides are
 
03:42:30.279 --> 03:42:31.750 align:start position:0%
tool the curriculum guides are
curriculum

03:42:31.750 --> 03:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
curriculum
 
03:42:34.389 --> 03:42:34.399 align:start position:0%
oriented and from your curriculum you
 
03:42:35.429 --> 03:42:35.439 align:start position:0%
have your
 
03:42:35.439 --> 03:42:37.309 align:start position:0%
have your
instruction

03:42:37.309 --> 03:42:37.319 align:start position:0%
instruction
 
03:42:41.189 --> 03:42:41.199 align:start position:0%
the assessment is in a separate area of
 
03:42:41.199 --> 03:42:43.309 align:start position:0%
the assessment is in a separate area of
Statute

03:42:43.309 --> 03:42:43.319 align:start position:0%
Statute
 
03:42:47.229 --> 03:42:47.239 align:start position:0%
um so that's a local concern yeah right
 
03:42:50.429 --> 03:42:50.439 align:start position:0%
so so thanks a followup so so so then it
 
03:42:54.269 --> 03:42:54.279 align:start position:0%
goes back to the the language that that
 
03:42:56.189 --> 03:42:56.199 align:start position:0%
that was historically in the in the
 
03:42:59.590 --> 03:42:59.600 align:start position:0%
statute that you've got in on lines 101
 
03:43:01.110 --> 03:43:01.120 align:start position:0%
sorry 11
 
03:43:04.790 --> 03:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
1213 on page one
 
03:43:07.670 --> 03:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
um that the framework Shall Serve as a
 
03:43:09.550 --> 03:43:09.560 align:start position:0%
guide and reference to what New
 
03:43:11.510 --> 03:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire sure students should know and
 
03:43:14.710 --> 03:43:14.720 align:start position:0%
be able to do or is it something
 
03:43:17.110 --> 03:43:17.120 align:start position:0%
different than that it's really a guide
 
03:43:17.120 --> 03:43:20.070 align:start position:0%
different than that it's really a guide
for

03:43:20.070 --> 03:43:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:24.510 --> 03:43:24.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:27.630 --> 03:43:27.640 align:start position:0%
curriculum how you how you
 
03:43:34.429 --> 03:43:34.439 align:start position:0%
instruct is totally a a local issue you
 
03:43:36.429 --> 03:43:36.439 align:start position:0%
might be doing it through team teaching
 
03:43:38.349 --> 03:43:38.359 align:start position:0%
you may be doing it you know instruction
 
03:43:40.309 --> 03:43:40.319 align:start position:0%
in the classroom looking from classroom
 
03:43:42.110 --> 03:43:42.120 align:start position:0%
a to classroom B instruction might be
 
03:43:44.870 --> 03:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
totally different but the curriculum
 
03:43:47.670 --> 03:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
should parallel the academic standards
 
03:43:50.590 --> 03:43:50.600 align:start position:0%
and the established curriculum for that
 
03:43:52.950 --> 03:43:52.960 align:start position:0%
District you know all districts are not
 
03:43:55.149 --> 03:43:55.159 align:start position:0%
going to be teaching a subject at the
 
03:43:58.189 --> 03:43:58.199 align:start position:0%
same grade level you may in a school
 
03:44:00.309 --> 03:44:00.319 align:start position:0%
teach us history at one grade level
 
03:44:02.389 --> 03:44:02.399 align:start position:0%
another one at another grade level but
 
03:44:04.670 --> 03:44:04.680 align:start position:0%
we as a state want to assess everything
 
03:44:07.389 --> 03:44:07.399 align:start position:0%
at this particular Focus
 
03:44:10.030 --> 03:44:10.040 align:start position:0%
time some districts kids are being being
 
03:44:11.590 --> 03:44:11.600 align:start position:0%
assessed on something they haven't
 
03:44:13.830 --> 03:44:13.840 align:start position:0%
learned yet and may be learning it the
 
03:44:17.070 --> 03:44:17.080 align:start position:0%
next year that does occur in this
 
03:44:21.389 --> 03:44:21.399 align:start position:0%
state okay thanks yeah any further
 
03:44:23.710 --> 03:44:23.720 align:start position:0%
questions I seeing none thank you very
 
03:44:27.309 --> 03:44:27.319 align:start position:0%
much thank you and I believe um
 
03:44:29.630 --> 03:44:29.640 align:start position:0%
Christine one other thing oh yes I did
 
03:44:31.469 --> 03:44:31.479 align:start position:0%
pass the technical advisory out to you
 
03:44:34.590 --> 03:44:34.600 align:start position:0%
so you can read where we went astray on
 
03:44:38.189 --> 03:44:38.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:51.870 --> 03:44:51.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:54.510 --> 03:44:54.520 align:start position:0%
Downey thank you again committee um
 
03:44:57.149 --> 03:44:57.159 align:start position:0%
Christine Downing uh Goan New Hampshire
 
03:44:59.349 --> 03:44:59.359 align:start position:0%
um I want to applaud representative lad
 
03:45:01.510 --> 03:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
for bringing this uh Bill to light with
 
03:45:03.950 --> 03:45:03.960 align:start position:0%
the curriculum Frameworks one of this
 
03:45:06.030 --> 03:45:06.040 align:start position:0%
this has um connections right now to the
 
03:45:08.750 --> 03:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
ongoing work around the 306 especially
 
03:45:10.550 --> 03:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
in the content area that I spoke about
 
03:45:13.590 --> 03:45:13.600 align:start position:0%
earlier those are the sections um 31
 
03:45:15.830 --> 03:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
through 48 um playing out all the
 
03:45:18.389 --> 03:45:18.399 align:start position:0%
different areas that representative lad
 
03:45:20.110 --> 03:45:20.120 align:start position:0%
also spoke about as an adequate
 
03:45:22.590 --> 03:45:22.600 align:start position:0%
education um I just wanted to give a
 
03:45:25.149 --> 03:45:25.159 align:start position:0%
little I've been 17 years now in
 
03:45:26.750 --> 03:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
curriculum instruction and assessment
 
03:45:28.750 --> 03:45:28.760 align:start position:0%
that's that's kind of been my livelihood
 
03:45:30.670 --> 03:45:30.680 align:start position:0%
in public school so I want to just help
 
03:45:32.870 --> 03:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
to clarify the idea of the curriculum
 
03:45:34.870 --> 03:45:34.880 align:start position:0%
Frameworks in terms of our minimum
 
03:45:37.030 --> 03:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
School approval standards and our
 
03:45:40.189 --> 03:45:40.199 align:start position:0%
academic standards um I was part of I
 
03:45:43.110 --> 03:45:43.120 align:start position:0%
really date myself now in terms of age
 
03:45:44.269 --> 03:45:44.279 align:start position:0%
um in
 
03:45:47.389 --> 03:45:47.399 align:start position:0%
1998 I was actually part of the team
 
03:45:49.710 --> 03:45:49.720 align:start position:0%
that did the second revision the second
 
03:45:52.429 --> 03:45:52.439 align:start position:0%
update to the um kada 12 Mathematics
 
03:45:54.670 --> 03:45:54.680 align:start position:0%
Curriculum framework at the state that
 
03:45:59.750 --> 03:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
lived until about 2006 2007 and so from
 
03:46:01.630 --> 03:46:01.640 align:start position:0%
a field perspective when did the
 
03:46:03.630 --> 03:46:03.640 align:start position:0%
curriculum framework start to Fall Away
 
03:46:05.670 --> 03:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
honestly they started to fall away with
 
03:46:07.269 --> 03:46:07.279 align:start position:0%
the movement around the Common Core
 
03:46:09.790 --> 03:46:09.800 align:start position:0%
State Standards and National organiz
 
03:46:11.910 --> 03:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
ations trying to get all 50 states on
 
03:46:15.070 --> 03:46:15.080 align:start position:0%
board um to deliver consistency in our
 
03:46:17.110 --> 03:46:17.120 align:start position:0%
academic areas so I would just add that
 
03:46:19.189 --> 03:46:19.199 align:start position:0%
insight to this conversation the other
 
03:46:21.189 --> 03:46:21.199 align:start position:0%
thing I would add is that the minimum
 
03:46:23.950 --> 03:46:23.960 align:start position:0%
School approval standards are really um
 
03:46:26.030 --> 03:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
aligned to adequate education that
 
03:46:27.710 --> 03:46:27.720 align:start position:0%
that's their goal their purpose is to
 
03:46:30.750 --> 03:46:30.760 align:start position:0%
really um specify how we meet that
 
03:46:32.630 --> 03:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
adequate education and everything
 
03:46:34.870 --> 03:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
spelled out in that RSA
 
03:46:37.990 --> 03:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
193e um from content to operational
 
03:46:40.149 --> 03:46:40.159 align:start position:0%
perspectives so there's one part of it
 
03:46:42.309 --> 03:46:42.319 align:start position:0%
the academic standards that are also
 
03:46:44.910 --> 03:46:44.920 align:start position:0%
listed in there really simply just get
 
03:46:47.110 --> 03:46:47.120 align:start position:0%
at the basic knowledge and skills that
 
03:46:50.389 --> 03:46:50.399 align:start position:0%
we want in the content areas for the um
 
03:46:52.269 --> 03:46:52.279 align:start position:0%
for our students now where do the
 
03:46:54.670 --> 03:46:54.680 align:start position:0%
curriculum Frameworks come in they are a
 
03:46:57.389 --> 03:46:57.399 align:start position:0%
combination of giving suggested best
 
03:46:59.149 --> 03:46:59.159 align:start position:0%
practices in instructional and
 
03:47:01.349 --> 03:47:01.359 align:start position:0%
assessment um and we did used to have
 
03:47:03.309 --> 03:47:03.319 align:start position:0%
that let me give you an example to maybe
 
03:47:06.110 --> 03:47:06.120 align:start position:0%
help clarify for example the Common Core
 
03:47:08.030 --> 03:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
State Standards which we have adopted
 
03:47:10.149 --> 03:47:10.159 align:start position:0%
and you can find
 
03:47:11.910 --> 03:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
some of our academic standards
 
03:47:13.910 --> 03:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
representative lad is completely correct
 
03:47:15.670 --> 03:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
here that we do not have academic
 
03:47:17.990 --> 03:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
standards for all the areas listed
 
03:47:20.149 --> 03:47:20.159 align:start position:0%
inadequate education the most recent is
 
03:47:22.189 --> 03:47:22.199 align:start position:0%
personal finance literacy there are no
 
03:47:24.670 --> 03:47:24.680 align:start position:0%
academic standards currently to back
 
03:47:28.870 --> 03:47:28.880 align:start position:0%
that up um and so academic standards I'm
 
03:47:30.429 --> 03:47:30.439 align:start position:0%
going to use math for example that's my
 
03:47:32.750 --> 03:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
old wheelhouse the Common Core State
 
03:47:34.469 --> 03:47:34.479 align:start position:0%
Standards and Mathematics for example
 
03:47:37.469 --> 03:47:37.479 align:start position:0%
will prescribe very specific mathematics
 
03:47:39.830 --> 03:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
skills and Concepts we want kids to know
 
03:47:42.630 --> 03:47:42.640 align:start position:0%
for example you know by the end of third
 
03:47:45.229 --> 03:47:45.239 align:start position:0%
grade we want students to be able for
 
03:47:47.830 --> 03:47:47.840 align:start position:0%
example to multiply double in triple
 
03:47:49.750 --> 03:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
digit numbers right so it it'll say
 
03:47:51.990 --> 03:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
something specific to that but it really
 
03:47:53.950 --> 03:47:53.960 align:start position:0%
none of these academic standards really
 
03:47:56.830 --> 03:47:56.840 align:start position:0%
go to the level of best practices in in
 
03:47:58.990 --> 03:47:59.000 align:start position:0%
terms of instruction so one of the
 
03:48:01.070 --> 03:48:01.080 align:start position:0%
debates we're in the middle of with the
 
03:48:04.630 --> 03:48:04.640 align:start position:0%
306 currently is um what is contained in
 
03:48:06.550 --> 03:48:06.560 align:start position:0%
the minimum School approval standard
 
03:48:09.590 --> 03:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
under our content areas does that belong
 
03:48:11.590 --> 03:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
in the minimum School approval standards
 
03:48:13.750 --> 03:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
or does it belong in the academic
 
03:48:15.189 --> 03:48:15.199 align:start position:0%
standards and I'll give you an example
 
03:48:17.790 --> 03:48:17.800 align:start position:0%
just here bear with me for a second um
 
03:48:19.870 --> 03:48:19.880 align:start position:0%
but what with this bill what I'm really
 
03:48:21.710 --> 03:48:21.720 align:start position:0%
encouraged by if you haven't guessed I
 
03:48:23.990 --> 03:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
fully support the bill but what this
 
03:48:26.110 --> 03:48:26.120 align:start position:0%
bill would do for us it would put the
 
03:48:29.269 --> 03:48:29.279 align:start position:0%
bridge between okay this is logistically
 
03:48:31.750 --> 03:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
what we have to do we have to provide a
 
03:48:34.149 --> 03:48:34.159 align:start position:0%
k through 12 Mathematics Curriculum our
 
03:48:35.510 --> 03:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
schools that's part of adequate
 
03:48:37.630 --> 03:48:37.640 align:start position:0%
education here are the skills and
 
03:48:39.110 --> 03:48:39.120 align:start position:0%
Concepts from the Common Core that we
 
03:48:40.950 --> 03:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
need to do but what are we going to set
 
03:48:43.469 --> 03:48:43.479 align:start position:0%
as the ground floor for consistent
 
03:48:45.269 --> 03:48:45.279 align:start position:0%
instructional and assessment practices
 
03:48:47.349 --> 03:48:47.359 align:start position:0%
for our schools again that's local
 
03:48:48.550 --> 03:48:48.560 align:start position:0%
control but we want to give some
 
03:48:50.670 --> 03:48:50.680 align:start position:0%
guidance on that here's an example of
 
03:48:52.510 --> 03:48:52.520 align:start position:0%
what I made and this is where we're
 
03:48:54.229 --> 03:48:54.239 align:start position:0%
debating and why we're running these
 
03:48:57.149 --> 03:48:57.159 align:start position:0%
educator review section sessions in
 
03:48:59.630 --> 03:48:59.640 align:start position:0%
February and March for example right now
 
03:49:02.110 --> 03:49:02.120 align:start position:0%
under the mathematics section of the 306
 
03:49:05.469 --> 03:49:05.479 align:start position:0%
rules it says um the local school board
 
03:49:08.030 --> 03:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
shall uh require that a mathematics
 
03:49:11.550 --> 03:49:11.560 align:start position:0%
program in each Elementary School um
 
03:49:13.950 --> 03:49:13.960 align:start position:0%
includes or provides and and here's what
 
03:49:16.670 --> 03:49:16.680 align:start position:0%
it says opportunities for authentic
 
03:49:18.149 --> 03:49:18.159 align:start position:0%
tasks that promote student
 
03:49:20.070 --> 03:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
decision-making and questioning
 
03:49:21.990 --> 03:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
encourage students to develop unique
 
03:49:23.950 --> 03:49:23.960 align:start position:0%
problem solving strategies while
 
03:49:25.550 --> 03:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
allowing students to defend their
 
03:49:27.670 --> 03:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
strategies and results planned
 
03:49:29.349 --> 03:49:29.359 align:start position:0%
activities that promote developmental
 
03:49:32.429 --> 03:49:32.439 align:start position:0%
math concepts from the concrete to the
 
03:49:34.790 --> 03:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
represent representational and finally
 
03:49:36.389 --> 03:49:36.399 align:start position:0%
to the abstract level and and there's
 
03:49:38.670 --> 03:49:38.680 align:start position:0%
more statement like that that go on
 
03:49:40.830 --> 03:49:40.840 align:start position:0%
where we as a 306 group have been
 
03:49:44.070 --> 03:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
struggling between is should this live
 
03:49:46.229 --> 03:49:46.239 align:start position:0%
in the minimum School approval standards
 
03:49:48.070 --> 03:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
should it live in the academic stands
 
03:49:50.189 --> 03:49:50.199 align:start position:0%
and what we've come to realize is it
 
03:49:51.790 --> 03:49:51.800 align:start position:0%
should go back into our curriculum
 
03:49:54.830 --> 03:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
Frameworks that we used to have back in
 
03:49:57.309 --> 03:49:57.319 align:start position:0%
the late 90s and I would say right up
 
03:50:00.349 --> 03:50:00.359 align:start position:0%
till about 20102 which is when we became
 
03:50:03.990 --> 03:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
Common Core um so I think this this bill
 
03:50:06.510 --> 03:50:06.520 align:start position:0%
is super important I just want to point
 
03:50:08.750 --> 03:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
out that some some feedback that I
 
03:50:12.429 --> 03:50:12.439 align:start position:0%
received from the Educators is is this
 
03:50:14.790 --> 03:50:14.800 align:start position:0%
that actually in the high school section
 
03:50:17.630 --> 03:50:17.640 align:start position:0%
of the 306 rules right now it says under
 
03:50:20.349 --> 03:50:20.359 align:start position:0%
Section U this is
 
03:50:22.710 --> 03:50:22.720 align:start position:0%
30627 school districts shall develop
 
03:50:25.189 --> 03:50:25.199 align:start position:0%
course Competency Based on New Hampshire
 
03:50:27.710 --> 03:50:27.720 align:start position:0%
academic standards where appable for all
 
03:50:29.830 --> 03:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
course offerings school districts may
 
03:50:32.110 --> 03:50:32.120 align:start position:0%
use State model course competencies to
 
03:50:34.590 --> 03:50:34.600 align:start position:0%
develop minimum course competencies just
 
03:50:36.990 --> 03:50:37.000 align:start position:0%
like representative lad has said where
 
03:50:39.790 --> 03:50:39.800 align:start position:0%
is that the field is saying we we want
 
03:50:42.229 --> 03:50:42.239 align:start position:0%
guidance in that and what they're
 
03:50:44.990 --> 03:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
further saying is um they said New
 
03:50:46.429 --> 03:50:46.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Public Schools this was a
 
03:50:48.630 --> 03:50:48.640 align:start position:0%
quote from some a group that worked on
 
03:50:50.750 --> 03:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
it New Hampshire Public Schools would be
 
03:50:52.510 --> 03:50:52.520 align:start position:0%
better served by a commitment from New
 
03:50:55.309 --> 03:50:55.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire education dep Department to
 
03:50:57.630 --> 03:50:57.640 align:start position:0%
articulate and publish State academic
 
03:50:59.870 --> 03:50:59.880 align:start position:0%
standards and model competencies in all
 
03:51:02.429 --> 03:51:02.439 align:start position:0%
content areas consistent feedback
 
03:51:04.349 --> 03:51:04.359 align:start position:0%
through these review sessions indicate
 
03:51:05.790 --> 03:51:05.800 align:start position:0%
public schools have been waiting for
 
03:51:08.469 --> 03:51:08.479 align:start position:0%
over a decade for the state to provide
 
03:51:11.189 --> 03:51:11.199 align:start position:0%
consistent graduation competencies with
 
03:51:13.550 --> 03:51:13.560 align:start position:0%
clear State academic standards and
 
03:51:15.990 --> 03:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
graduation competencies outlined there's
 
03:51:18.110 --> 03:51:18.120 align:start position:0%
a strong support that Competency Based
 
03:51:20.189 --> 03:51:20.199 align:start position:0%
education can move forward consistently
 
03:51:22.910 --> 03:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
in our Public Schools so I'm a strong
 
03:51:26.149 --> 03:51:26.159 align:start position:0%
supporter of this um bill I think
 
03:51:28.189 --> 03:51:28.199 align:start position:0%
curriculum Frameworks is that missing
 
03:51:30.550 --> 03:51:30.560 align:start position:0%
link between what we say we have to do
 
03:51:33.429 --> 03:51:33.439 align:start position:0%
for an adequate education what our
 
03:51:35.469 --> 03:51:35.479 align:start position:0%
national most of our acade State
 
03:51:37.149 --> 03:51:37.159 align:start position:0%
academic standards are just linked to
 
03:51:39.429 --> 03:51:39.439 align:start position:0%
National standards currently what what
 
03:51:42.590 --> 03:51:42.600 align:start position:0%
they say um is the body of Knowledge and
 
03:51:45.229 --> 03:51:45.239 align:start position:0%
Skills in those content areas to okay
 
03:51:47.269 --> 03:51:47.279 align:start position:0%
now how do we make that operationally
 
03:51:49.349 --> 03:51:49.359 align:start position:0%
happen for our students so strong
 
03:51:52.110 --> 03:51:52.120 align:start position:0%
supporter of this bill and again commend
 
03:51:53.910 --> 03:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
representative lad and for those that
 
03:51:57.349 --> 03:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
worked on it thank you thank you any
 
03:51:58.790 --> 03:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
03:52:01.349 --> 03:52:01.359 align:start position:0%
committee uh representative casken thank
 
03:52:04.309 --> 03:52:04.319 align:start position:0%
you uh thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:52:07.349 --> 03:52:07.359 align:start position:0%
uh Christine for um being so uh
 
03:52:09.950 --> 03:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
enlightening um so yeah I've been around
 
03:52:11.950 --> 03:52:11.960 align:start position:0%
long enough to work with Frameworks and
 
03:52:14.309 --> 03:52:14.319 align:start position:0%
whatnot and I question you know this
 
03:52:17.910 --> 03:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
pendulum push as we've experienced it
 
03:52:19.750 --> 03:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
and it was the most helpful document so
 
03:52:21.550 --> 03:52:21.560 align:start position:0%
I absolutely support going back to a
 
03:52:23.910 --> 03:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
Frameworks and then Common Core came
 
03:52:23.920 --> 03:52:24.750 align:start position:0%
Frameworks and then Common Core came
very

03:52:24.750 --> 03:52:24.760 align:start position:0%
very
 
03:52:26.870 --> 03:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
controversial then we had common core
 
03:52:28.790 --> 03:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
for Math and
 
03:52:34.550 --> 03:52:34.560 align:start position:0%
Ela um but my question is do you think
 
03:52:38.030 --> 03:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
or do you see Competency Based
 
03:52:41.349 --> 03:52:41.359 align:start position:0%
education sort of throwing a wrench in
 
03:52:43.870 --> 03:52:43.880 align:start position:0%
all of this in a different light or is
 
03:52:47.750 --> 03:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
there no connection between that because
 
03:52:50.429 --> 03:52:50.439 align:start position:0%
that was another wave yes I I think I'm
 
03:52:51.990 --> 03:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
actually I see Competency Based
 
03:52:54.149 --> 03:52:54.159 align:start position:0%
education as being our broad umbrella
 
03:52:56.030 --> 03:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
that pulls this alog together it's the
 
03:52:59.389 --> 03:52:59.399 align:start position:0%
glue because you really need solid you
 
03:53:01.030 --> 03:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
need a couple of things to build your
 
03:53:03.429 --> 03:53:03.439 align:start position:0%
competencies you need solid academic
 
03:53:05.870 --> 03:53:05.880 align:start position:0%
standards that are going to outline that
 
03:53:08.429 --> 03:53:08.439 align:start position:0%
that content Knowledge and Skills right
 
03:53:10.950 --> 03:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
but then you also need that guidance in
 
03:53:13.309 --> 03:53:13.319 align:start position:0%
the instructional part of it the best
 
03:53:15.870 --> 03:53:15.880 align:start position:0%
practices of instruction to really build
 
03:53:18.110 --> 03:53:18.120 align:start position:0%
that competency strong because remember
 
03:53:19.790 --> 03:53:19.800 align:start position:0%
competencies are really about three
 
03:53:22.229 --> 03:53:22.239 align:start position:0%
things it's one what acquisition of
 
03:53:23.790 --> 03:53:23.800 align:start position:0%
Knowledge and Skills do I want you to
 
03:53:26.870 --> 03:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
have two how do I want you as a student
 
03:53:28.950 --> 03:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
to make meaning of that Knowledge and
 
03:53:31.269 --> 03:53:31.279 align:start position:0%
Skills and here's the third one and this
 
03:53:33.630 --> 03:53:33.640 align:start position:0%
really ties to what the curriculum
 
03:53:35.469 --> 03:53:35.479 align:start position:0%
Frameworks could do is how do you
 
03:53:38.149 --> 03:53:38.159 align:start position:0%
transfer and apply that learning right
 
03:53:40.670 --> 03:53:40.680 align:start position:0%
and I I think the curriculum Frameworks
 
03:53:42.830 --> 03:53:42.840 align:start position:0%
you know if we do these right and we get
 
03:53:44.630 --> 03:53:44.640 align:start position:0%
them back and we get just how they were
 
03:53:46.590 --> 03:53:46.600 align:start position:0%
originally built with Educators at the
 
03:53:50.309 --> 03:53:50.319 align:start position:0%
table we can build excellent curriculum
 
03:53:53.229 --> 03:53:53.239 align:start position:0%
Frameworks that honestly you know part
 
03:53:55.510 --> 03:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
of the debate the 306 has had around
 
03:53:58.910 --> 03:53:58.920 align:start position:0%
these content areas the team has had is
 
03:54:00.429 --> 03:54:00.439 align:start position:0%
where do we don't want to lose these
 
03:54:01.750 --> 03:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
things because right now at least they
 
03:54:03.870 --> 03:54:03.880 align:start position:0%
are giving some guidance to the field
 
03:54:06.510 --> 03:54:06.520 align:start position:0%
but if we pull them out there's nothing
 
03:54:08.349 --> 03:54:08.359 align:start position:0%
there because right now it's you have
 
03:54:11.389 --> 03:54:11.399 align:start position:0%
kind of R down 306 rules but you have
 
03:54:14.189 --> 03:54:14.199 align:start position:0%
these these academic standards that are
 
03:54:16.110 --> 03:54:16.120 align:start position:0%
really checklist of things and we don't
 
03:54:19.030 --> 03:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
want to go back that way and when I saw
 
03:54:20.790 --> 03:54:20.800 align:start position:0%
this bill I was like th this is the
 
03:54:23.030 --> 03:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
missing piece of what we need to really
 
03:54:25.870 --> 03:54:25.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:28.870 --> 03:54:28.880 align:start position:0%

okay great thank you okay I'll take the
 
03:59:46.429 --> 03:59:46.439 align:start position:0%
gavel back and I will explain with
 
03:59:50.110 --> 03:59:50.120 align:start position:0%
1163 the one we just did we're going to
 
03:59:52.110 --> 03:59:52.120 align:start position:0%
try and tie this bridge a little bit
 
03:59:54.110 --> 03:59:54.120 align:start position:0%
better with curriculum and
 
03:59:56.229 --> 03:59:56.239 align:start position:0%
instruction and so we're going to take a
 
03:59:58.950 --> 03:59:58.960 align:start position:0%
little bit more time on this work on it
 
04:00:02.149 --> 04:00:02.159 align:start position:0%
um we feel that this is also a sequel to
 
04:00:07.269 --> 04:00:07.279 align:start position:0%
what we just did um this is really
 
04:00:10.429 --> 04:00:10.439 align:start position:0%
foundational to how we're going to
 
04:00:13.309 --> 04:00:13.319 align:start position:0%
develop the learning in our schools and
 
04:00:16.590 --> 04:00:16.600 align:start position:0%
improve it in our schools through the
 
04:00:20.710 --> 04:00:20.720 align:start position:0%
properly identifying and structuring the
 
04:00:22.910 --> 04:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
minimum standards Public School approval
 
04:00:26.229 --> 04:00:26.239 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with academic
 
04:00:30.110 --> 04:00:30.120 align:start position:0%
standards so the Frameworks are a local
 
04:00:33.269 --> 04:00:33.279 align:start position:0%
state Affair and so we'll move in that
 
04:00:35.389 --> 04:00:35.399 align:start position:0%
direction with the those Frameworks but
 
04:00:36.429 --> 04:00:36.439 align:start position:0%
we're going to take a little bit more
 
04:00:39.389 --> 04:00:39.399 align:start position:0%
time to discuss it and work up perhaps
 
04:00:41.790 --> 04:00:41.800 align:start position:0%
some amending
 
04:00:44.590 --> 04:00:44.600 align:start position:0%
language so with that we'll go on to the
 
04:00:46.870 --> 04:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
next bill on the docket here for
 
04:00:49.309 --> 04:00:49.319 align:start position:0%
today want to let Oliver ask his
 
04:00:52.189 --> 04:00:52.199 align:start position:0%
question oh Oliver had a question yes
 
04:00:55.389 --> 04:00:55.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:57.870 --> 04:00:57.880 align:start position:0%
Frameworks representative leus and I
 
04:00:59.790 --> 04:00:59.800 align:start position:0%
have been discussing the question of
 
04:01:03.429 --> 04:01:03.439 align:start position:0%
math education for quite some time and
 
04:01:05.790 --> 04:01:05.800 align:start position:0%
we've been wondering at some point
 
04:01:07.910 --> 04:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
whether or not we need to introduce the
 
04:01:07.920 --> 04:01:09.309 align:start position:0%
whether or not we need to introduce the
idea

04:01:09.309 --> 04:01:09.319 align:start position:0%
idea
 
04:01:13.750 --> 04:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
of how we teach people math education
 
04:01:16.389 --> 04:01:16.399 align:start position:0%
how we teach them math how we teach them
 
04:01:19.830 --> 04:01:19.840 align:start position:0%
to think about math and that based on
 
04:01:23.750 --> 04:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
some of our personal experiences we had
 
04:01:26.790 --> 04:01:26.800 align:start position:0%
experience places where they teach you
 
04:01:29.510 --> 04:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
the thinking of math not just the
 
04:01:31.990 --> 04:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
finding of answers to problems okay
 
04:01:34.990 --> 04:01:35.000 align:start position:0%
that's that's down the road ways as far
 
04:01:37.189 --> 04:01:37.199 align:start position:0%
as you know dealing with with
 
04:01:40.189 --> 04:01:40.199 align:start position:0%
mathematics as it content area right now
 
04:01:41.790 --> 04:01:41.800 align:start position:0%
we really do need to get on because
 
04:01:44.510 --> 04:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
we're on a tight line here in terms of
 
04:01:46.830 --> 04:01:46.840 align:start position:0%
time I'm out of here myself and
 
04:01:50.670 --> 04:01:50.680 align:start position:0%
about 20 25 minutes uh for another
 
04:01:54.189 --> 04:01:54.199 align:start position:0%
meeting at Grant State College so um I'd
 
04:01:56.990 --> 04:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
like to get on to the next bill dealing
 
04:01:57.000 --> 04:01:58.910 align:start position:0%
like to get on to the next bill dealing
with

04:01:58.910 --> 04:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:02:01.590 --> 04:02:01.600 align:start position:0%
1066 um relative to the graduation
 
04:02:04.070 --> 04:02:04.080 align:start position:0%
requirement of filing a free application
 
04:02:07.189 --> 04:02:07.199 align:start position:0%
for federal student aid FAFSA and I'd
 
04:02:10.269 --> 04:02:10.279 align:start position:0%
like to welcome representative Noble the
 
04:02:11.950 --> 04:02:11.960 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill good afternoon
 
04:02:13.910 --> 04:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
chairman lad and fellow members of the
 
04:02:16.389 --> 04:02:16.399 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Kristen Noble and I
 
04:02:18.830 --> 04:02:18.840 align:start position:0%
represent Hillsboro District 2 the town
 
04:02:23.149 --> 04:02:23.159 align:start position:0%
of Bedford HB 1066 would repeal the ffs
 
04:02:25.710 --> 04:02:25.720 align:start position:0%
of graduation requirement found under
 
04:02:30.309 --> 04:02:30.319 align:start position:0%
RSA 19 193 col
 
04:02:32.790 --> 04:02:32.800 align:start position:0%
26- it would be replaced with a
 
04:02:35.070 --> 04:02:35.080 align:start position:0%
Schoolboard policy requiring districts
 
04:02:37.189 --> 04:02:37.199 align:start position:0%
to provide information to students and
 
04:02:39.910 --> 04:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
their parents about the free application
 
04:02:41.870 --> 04:02:41.880 align:start position:0%
for federal student
 
04:02:44.429 --> 04:02:44.439 align:start position:0%
aid from what I understand the goal
 
04:02:46.710 --> 04:02:46.720 align:start position:0%
behind this graduation requirement was
 
04:02:49.790 --> 04:02:49.800 align:start position:0%
to get more kids to go to college that
 
04:02:51.910 --> 04:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
our FAFSA completion rate in the state
 
04:02:54.469 --> 04:02:54.479 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire is too low and with
 
04:02:56.750 --> 04:02:56.760 align:start position:0%
this mandate students May potentially
 
04:02:59.389 --> 04:02:59.399 align:start position:0%
see that they can afford college and
 
04:03:00.670 --> 04:03:00.680 align:start position:0%
decide to
 
04:03:04.550 --> 04:03:04.560 align:start position:0%
go the truth is it's not as simple as
 
04:03:06.750 --> 04:03:06.760 align:start position:0%
everyone fill out this form and see if
 
04:03:08.990 --> 04:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
you qualify and then you'll know if you
 
04:03:10.189 --> 04:03:10.199 align:start position:0%
want to go to
 
04:03:13.429 --> 04:03:13.439 align:start position:0%
college it's a lengthy multi-step
 
04:03:16.349 --> 04:03:16.359 align:start position:0%
process that first starts with knowing
 
04:03:18.990 --> 04:03:19.000 align:start position:0%
that you want to attend college then you
 
04:03:22.149 --> 04:03:22.159 align:start position:0%
research schools visit schools apply to
 
04:03:24.110 --> 04:03:24.120 align:start position:0%
school and usually at that point you
 
04:03:25.269 --> 04:03:25.279 align:start position:0%
fill out the
 
04:03:28.469 --> 04:03:28.479 align:start position:0%
FAFSA you must choose at least one
 
04:03:30.469 --> 04:03:30.479 align:start position:0%
school to send your financial
 
04:03:33.349 --> 04:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
information to in order to see if you
 
04:03:36.469 --> 04:03:36.479 align:start position:0%
qualify for Aid you cannot complete the
 
04:03:39.750 --> 04:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
form without it so you're going through
 
04:03:42.510 --> 04:03:42.520 align:start position:0%
all of those other steps
 
04:03:46.030 --> 04:03:46.040 align:start position:0%
first so here's a few reasons to support
 
04:03:48.590 --> 04:03:48.600 align:start position:0%
the repeal of this graduation
 
04:03:52.189 --> 04:03:52.199 align:start position:0%
requirement this is government overreach
 
04:03:55.550 --> 04:03:55.560 align:start position:0%
it is a privacy issue the government may
 
04:03:58.309 --> 04:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
have your data already but these schools
 
04:04:00.830 --> 04:04:00.840 align:start position:0%
do not and the state shouldn't be trying
 
04:04:03.349 --> 04:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
to force families into sharing their
 
04:04:05.790 --> 04:04:05.800 align:start position:0%
private financial
 
04:04:08.269 --> 04:04:08.279 align:start position:0%
information it is sending a message me
 
04:04:10.550 --> 04:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
to students that college is the best
 
04:04:14.670 --> 04:04:14.680 align:start position:0%
path and that is not true for everyone I
 
04:04:16.590 --> 04:04:16.600 align:start position:0%
heard from a public high school teacher
 
04:04:19.950 --> 04:04:19.960 align:start position:0%
in support of this bill he told me that
 
04:04:21.590 --> 04:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
he had a student who did an
 
04:04:24.149 --> 04:04:24.159 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship apprenticeship before he
 
04:04:27.269 --> 04:04:27.279 align:start position:0%
even graduated he helped encourage his
 
04:04:30.870 --> 04:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
student to follow that Path college is
 
04:04:34.830 --> 04:04:34.840 align:start position:0%
not for everyone and that's perfectly
 
04:04:36.990 --> 04:04:37.000 align:start position:0%
okay we should be trusting the
 
04:04:39.110 --> 04:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
Professionals in our schools to provide
 
04:04:41.510 --> 04:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
guidance for those students who want to
 
04:04:45.030 --> 04:04:45.040 align:start position:0%
attend college they know the kids and if
 
04:04:46.950 --> 04:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
they have low-income students who may
 
04:04:49.630 --> 04:04:49.640 align:start position:0%
potentially qualify for the pel grant
 
04:04:51.389 --> 04:04:51.399 align:start position:0%
they will absolutely steer them in the
 
04:04:53.910 --> 04:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
direction of choosing a school and
 
04:04:55.349 --> 04:04:55.359 align:start position:0%
filling out the
 
04:04:58.309 --> 04:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
FAFSA if a student has the desire to go
 
04:05:00.790 --> 04:05:00.800 align:start position:0%
to college and cannot afford to pay out
 
04:05:03.990 --> 04:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
of pocket that family is most likely
 
04:05:06.429 --> 04:05:06.439 align:start position:0%
filling out the FAFSA without it being a
 
04:05:10.030 --> 04:05:10.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:13.670 --> 04:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
for most students FAFSA does not provide
 
04:05:16.510 --> 04:05:16.520 align:start position:0%
a complete picture of
 
04:05:19.469 --> 04:05:19.479 align:start position:0%
affordability a high school diploma
 
04:05:21.870 --> 04:05:21.880 align:start position:0%
should not be tied to anything but
 
04:05:23.990 --> 04:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
academics and not if their parents
 
04:05:26.189 --> 04:05:26.199 align:start position:0%
filled out a government
 
04:05:26.199 --> 04:05:27.750 align:start position:0%
filled out a government
form

04:05:27.750 --> 04:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
form
 
04:05:31.070 --> 04:05:31.080 align:start position:0%
lastly this is not a real requirement
 
04:05:33.590 --> 04:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
parents can fill out a waiver or they
 
04:05:36.750 --> 04:05:36.760 align:start position:0%
can do nothing at all in their child
 
04:05:38.429 --> 04:05:38.439 align:start position:0%
will still graduate
 
04:05:41.149 --> 04:05:41.159 align:start position:0%
it's a law that cannot be enforced
 
04:05:44.149 --> 04:05:44.159 align:start position:0%
therefore it makes sense to repeal it
 
04:05:46.030 --> 04:05:46.040 align:start position:0%
and replace it with the Schoolboard
 
04:05:48.550 --> 04:05:48.560 align:start position:0%
policy that requires districts to
 
04:05:50.710 --> 04:05:50.720 align:start position:0%
provide information to students and
 
04:05:54.110 --> 04:05:54.120 align:start position:0%
parents but largely leaves that process
 
04:05:58.630 --> 04:05:58.640 align:start position:0%
up to them by respecting local
 
04:06:01.950 --> 04:06:01.960 align:start position:0%
control so we were 1010 on this in the
 
04:06:05.309 --> 04:06:05.319 align:start position:0%
spring but outside of this room this is
 
04:06:08.830 --> 04:06:08.840 align:start position:0%
not a partisan issue I found that out
 
04:06:10.269 --> 04:06:10.279 align:start position:0%
this weekend when I heard from
 
04:06:12.830 --> 04:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
constituents who generally do not agree
 
04:06:15.349 --> 04:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
with me on anything
 
04:06:18.229 --> 04:06:18.239 align:start position:0%
else but they do on
 
04:06:21.630 --> 04:06:21.640 align:start position:0%
this I showed you in the spring over 20
 
04:06:24.790 --> 04:06:24.800 align:start position:0%
superintendents that are on board with
 
04:06:28.269 --> 04:06:28.279 align:start position:0%
repealing this is a bipartisan this bill
 
04:06:31.670 --> 04:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
is bipartisan it's sensible and I ask
 
04:06:34.630 --> 04:06:34.640 align:start position:0%
you to support it thank you thank you
 
04:06:36.309 --> 04:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
very much representative are there any
 
04:06:38.590 --> 04:06:38.600 align:start position:0%
questions yes repres
 
04:06:41.229 --> 04:06:41.239 align:start position:0%
Hall thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:06:43.710 --> 04:06:43.720 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question um
 
04:06:47.389 --> 04:06:47.399 align:start position:0%
you said that it's a um an R it cannot
 
04:06:50.710 --> 04:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
be enforced but you said and as we know
 
04:06:53.030 --> 04:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
that it has a waiver so how can it not
 
04:06:56.309 --> 04:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
be enforced if if you don't want to do
 
04:06:58.349 --> 04:06:58.359 align:start position:0%
it you just fill out the waiver I mean
 
04:07:00.429 --> 04:07:00.439 align:start position:0%
they can keep track of whether the
 
04:07:02.630 --> 04:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
school districts can I think keep track
 
04:07:04.429 --> 04:07:04.439 align:start position:0%
of whether they're you know they got the
 
04:07:07.149 --> 04:07:07.159 align:start position:0%
paperwork or they don't yes or no or
 
04:07:08.950 --> 04:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for the representative Hall
 
04:07:11.590 --> 04:07:11.600 align:start position:0%
even if they don't get a waiver they
 
04:07:14.269 --> 04:07:14.279 align:start position:0%
they can't stop the child from
 
04:07:16.870 --> 04:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
graduating so they they could they could
 
04:07:19.429 --> 04:07:19.439 align:start position:0%
chase after the parents and if they
 
04:07:21.389 --> 04:07:21.399 align:start position:0%
don't get any answer at all the the
 
04:07:24.870 --> 04:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:26.870 --> 04:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
graduate further
 
04:07:29.990 --> 04:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
questions represent luno thank you very
 
04:07:31.550 --> 04:07:31.560 align:start position:0%
much Mr chair and thank you very much
 
04:07:33.469 --> 04:07:33.479 align:start position:0%
representative for bringing this forward
 
04:07:34.870 --> 04:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
I was wondering if you could elaborate a
 
04:07:36.229 --> 04:07:36.239 align:start position:0%
little bit more about what your
 
04:07:39.670 --> 04:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
constituents um concerns are over the
 
04:07:43.670 --> 04:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
existing um um statute and um and what
 
04:07:46.710 --> 04:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
they like best about
 
04:07:52.149 --> 04:07:52.159 align:start position:0%
this uh I heard the word overreach a lot
 
04:07:55.910 --> 04:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
um and and not from Republicans also
 
04:07:55.920 --> 04:07:56.910 align:start position:0%
um and and not from Republicans also
from

04:07:56.910 --> 04:07:56.920 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:07:59.269 --> 04:07:59.279 align:start position:0%
Democrats and they also consider it to
 
04:08:01.349 --> 04:08:01.359 align:start position:0%
be a privacy
 
04:08:05.030 --> 04:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
issue follow follow yes go ahead um and
 
04:08:08.349 --> 04:08:08.359 align:start position:0%
so so when when talking about overreach
 
04:08:11.109 --> 04:08:11.119 align:start position:0%
and in in view of the fact that a simple
 
04:08:15.790 --> 04:08:15.800 align:start position:0%
waiver um uh prepared by either the the
 
04:08:18.830 --> 04:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
family or by the principal can um can
 
04:08:20.109 --> 04:08:20.119 align:start position:0%
release the
 
04:08:22.790 --> 04:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
student of this as a graduation
 
04:08:25.510 --> 04:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
requirement um were they aware of of
 
04:08:27.710 --> 04:08:27.720 align:start position:0%
that those those Provisions in the
 
04:08:30.750 --> 04:08:30.760 align:start position:0%
current law yes they're
 
04:08:32.990 --> 04:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
aware would you like me to elaborate on
 
04:08:36.790 --> 04:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
that I mean they're they're aware of it
 
04:08:40.830 --> 04:08:40.840 align:start position:0%
but it's still still seen as like a bad
 
04:08:43.070 --> 04:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
precedent I mean what else are we going
 
04:08:47.429 --> 04:08:47.439 align:start position:0%
to tie to graduation besides
 
04:08:49.670 --> 04:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
academics you know this could this could
 
04:08:49.680 --> 04:08:55.149 align:start position:0%
academics you know this could this could
go

04:08:55.149 --> 04:08:55.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:58.670 --> 04:08:58.680 align:start position:0%
further represent Bon thank you Mr chair
 
04:09:01.030 --> 04:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question um
 
04:09:04.109 --> 04:09:04.119 align:start position:0%
I when this you came up at the in the
 
04:09:06.670 --> 04:09:06.680 align:start position:0%
spring it was the first time it hadn't
 
04:09:08.670 --> 04:09:08.680 align:start position:0%
actually been instituted yet so the
 
04:09:11.269 --> 04:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
first time would have been this past
 
04:09:15.790 --> 04:09:15.800 align:start position:0%
June so do we have any data available on
 
04:09:18.550 --> 04:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
what really happened schoolwide I mean I
 
04:09:21.349 --> 04:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
you're giving anecdotal data but I mean
 
04:09:23.389 --> 04:09:23.399 align:start position:0%
from the superintendent involved I see
 
04:09:25.750 --> 04:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
that there's a letter here but what what
 
04:09:28.830 --> 04:09:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:33.910 --> 04:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
have um I I think that there is the
 
04:09:35.950 --> 04:09:35.960 align:start position:0%
school administrators Association here
 
04:09:37.750 --> 04:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
that might be able to answer that a
 
04:09:39.830 --> 04:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
little bit better or even the school
 
04:09:41.750 --> 04:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
board Administration and we also have
 
04:09:44.269 --> 04:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond here as well who
 
04:09:47.229 --> 04:09:47.239 align:start position:0%
is on the nationa school board so she
 
04:09:48.469 --> 04:09:48.479 align:start position:0%
might be able to answer that a little
 
04:09:50.550 --> 04:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
bit better than
 
04:09:52.830 --> 04:09:52.840 align:start position:0%
me representative
 
04:09:56.550 --> 04:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
petel thank you Mr chair um thank you
 
04:09:59.630 --> 04:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
representative Noble on line seven of
 
04:10:02.630 --> 04:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
the bill it says um well it starts on
 
04:10:02.640 --> 04:10:03.630 align:start position:0%
the bill it says um well it starts on
line

04:10:03.630 --> 04:10:03.640 align:start position:0%
line
 
04:10:06.990 --> 04:10:07.000 align:start position:0%
six pupils eligible for graduation shall
 
04:10:09.030 --> 04:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to receive
 
04:10:11.830 --> 04:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
information on how to properly complete
 
04:10:15.670 --> 04:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
are there students now who don't have
 
04:10:17.510 --> 04:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to receive this
 
04:10:19.510 --> 04:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
information I mean it would seem to me
 
04:10:21.670 --> 04:10:21.680 align:start position:0%
that if somebody wanted to go to college
 
04:10:24.910 --> 04:10:24.920 align:start position:0%
they would be seeking out the
 
04:10:26.510 --> 04:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
information they needed in order to
 
04:10:28.910 --> 04:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
apply to a college thank you for the
 
04:10:32.429 --> 04:10:32.439 align:start position:0%
question representative Pell um as far
 
04:10:34.990 --> 04:10:35.000 align:start position:0%
as I know the school districts are
 
04:10:37.030 --> 04:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
pretty much following what's what's in
 
04:10:39.830 --> 04:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
here now so they have their information
 
04:10:41.830 --> 04:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
nights and that kind of thing they
 
04:10:43.550 --> 04:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
provide information to students and
 
04:10:45.750 --> 04:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
parents currently and have been doing
 
04:10:49.630 --> 04:10:49.640 align:start position:0%
that for quite some time as far as I
 
04:10:52.590 --> 04:10:52.600 align:start position:0%
know yes go
 
04:10:55.910 --> 04:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
ahead so we're not just
 
04:10:59.830 --> 04:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
repealing legislation we're replacing it
 
04:11:02.670 --> 04:11:02.680 align:start position:0%
with maybe unnecessary legislation
 
04:11:04.830 --> 04:11:04.840 align:start position:0%
because they're already doing
 
04:11:08.189 --> 04:11:08.199 align:start position:0%
this what they're already doing
 
04:11:09.750 --> 04:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
what your bill
 
04:11:13.510 --> 04:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
proposes so do they need even your bill
 
04:11:16.870 --> 04:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't we just completely repeal
 
04:11:16.880 --> 04:11:21.070 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't we just completely repeal
the

04:11:21.070 --> 04:11:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:23.429 --> 04:11:23.439 align:start position:0%
RSA thank you for the
 
04:11:23.439 --> 04:11:24.990 align:start position:0%
RSA thank you for the
question

04:11:24.990 --> 04:11:25.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:11:25.000 --> 04:11:26.990 align:start position:0%
question
um

04:11:26.990 --> 04:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:29.469 --> 04:11:29.479 align:start position:0%
I I would say most of the schools are
 
04:11:31.950 --> 04:11:31.960 align:start position:0%
doing it I don't know if we know if all
 
04:11:36.349 --> 04:11:36.359 align:start position:0%
of them are so this does put this in
 
04:11:36.359 --> 04:11:38.469 align:start position:0%
of them are so this does put this in
place

04:11:38.469 --> 04:11:38.479 align:start position:0%
place
 
04:11:41.269 --> 04:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:47.830 --> 04:11:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:51.189 --> 04:11:51.199 align:start position:0%
much we have at this time four cards up
 
04:11:52.950 --> 04:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
here on this are there any other folks
 
04:11:54.670 --> 04:11:54.680 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
04:12:38.670 --> 04:12:38.680 align:start position:0%
you uh certainly uh and thank you Mr
 
04:12:39.830 --> 04:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you committee for the
 
04:12:42.870 --> 04:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
question uh in regard to the fast for
 
04:12:44.710 --> 04:12:44.720 align:start position:0%
law the understanding last year is that
 
04:12:47.510 --> 04:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
it was a requirement for schools and
 
04:12:50.429 --> 04:12:50.439 align:start position:0%
just as the representative spoke to uh
 
04:12:52.149 --> 04:12:52.159 align:start position:0%
for many schools that didn't necessarily
 
04:12:55.269 --> 04:12:55.279 align:start position:0%
fit and just of others have spoken about
 
04:12:58.550 --> 04:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
schools do make FASA a that opportunity
 
04:13:01.030 --> 04:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
aware for their students who may benefit
 
04:13:03.630 --> 04:13:03.640 align:start position:0%
from that and the fact that it was a
 
04:13:05.670 --> 04:13:05.680 align:start position:0%
requirement did feel like it was pretty
 
04:13:07.429 --> 04:13:07.439 align:start position:0%
heavy-handed to some school dist
 
04:13:10.269 --> 04:13:10.279 align:start position:0%
districts um and school districts are
 
04:13:12.510 --> 04:13:12.520 align:start position:0%
making that available uh to their
 
04:13:15.990 --> 04:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
students and um I believe repealing that
 
04:13:18.550 --> 04:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
and replacing it with language that
 
04:13:20.189 --> 04:13:20.199 align:start position:0%
makes it a priority certainly makes
 
04:13:22.830 --> 04:13:22.840 align:start position:0%
sense in applicability in the
 
04:13:26.590 --> 04:13:26.600 align:start position:0%
field are there any questions from the
 
04:13:29.630 --> 04:13:29.640 align:start position:0%
committee yes represent luno thanks
 
04:13:33.510 --> 04:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
thanks very much Mr chair so um so are
 
04:13:39.950 --> 04:13:39.960 align:start position:0%
are you aware of um of what um Glen how
 
04:13:42.670 --> 04:13:42.680 align:start position:0%
how FAFSA completion rates have changed
 
04:13:45.269 --> 04:13:45.279 align:start position:0%
in other states that have adopted the
 
04:13:46.950 --> 04:13:46.960 align:start position:0%
law that's currently on the books in New
 
04:13:48.349 --> 04:13:48.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I I have not done that
 
04:13:51.269 --> 04:13:51.279 align:start position:0%
research okay so so just to set the
 
04:13:55.070 --> 04:13:55.080 align:start position:0%
stage for a follow-up question um uh
 
04:13:59.189 --> 04:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
Texas adopted um our what what we now
 
04:14:01.750 --> 04:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
have as current law back I think in 2018
 
04:14:01.760 --> 04:14:02.630 align:start position:0%
have as current law back I think in 2018
or

04:14:02.630 --> 04:14:02.640 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:14:05.790 --> 04:14:05.800 align:start position:0%
2019 and they are now ranked um number
 
04:14:08.269 --> 04:14:08.279 align:start position:0%
one in the nation um for year-over-year
 
04:14:11.590 --> 04:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
change in FAFSA completion in fact their
 
04:14:14.309 --> 04:14:14.319 align:start position:0%
um their rate of completion is
 
04:14:17.149 --> 04:14:17.159 align:start position:0%
56% um which is above the national rate
 
04:14:17.159 --> 04:14:18.710 align:start position:0%
56% um which is above the national rate
of

04:14:18.710 --> 04:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:14:21.630 --> 04:14:21.640 align:start position:0%
46% and um and I guess my question to
 
04:14:22.950 --> 04:14:22.960 align:start position:0%
you would
 
04:14:30.269 --> 04:14:30.279 align:start position:0%
be do do you believe that um that uh
 
04:14:34.469 --> 04:14:34.479 align:start position:0%
that if more students complete the FAFSA
 
04:14:38.109 --> 04:14:38.119 align:start position:0%
then more students will um will will
 
04:14:40.389 --> 04:14:40.399 align:start position:0%
will Ser will take a serious look at
 
04:14:42.070 --> 04:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
higher education
 
04:14:43.750 --> 04:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
opportunities yeah I think there's
 
04:14:45.429 --> 04:14:45.439 align:start position:0%
probably a very strong likelihood that
 
04:14:47.269 --> 04:14:47.279 align:start position:0%
there would be a correlation there I
 
04:14:50.469 --> 04:14:50.479 align:start position:0%
think that we could certainly bring more
 
04:14:53.070 --> 04:14:53.080 align:start position:0%
awareness to FASA in how that can
 
04:14:55.550 --> 04:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
benefit folks uh in other ways we can
 
04:14:59.189 --> 04:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
lift the importance of that and just
 
04:15:01.750 --> 04:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh differently than making it a
 
04:15:03.389 --> 04:15:03.399 align:start position:0%
legislative requirement I think there
 
04:15:05.590 --> 04:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
are ways to highlight that working with
 
04:15:07.990 --> 04:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
other organizations and I know that the
 
04:15:09.630 --> 04:15:09.640 align:start position:0%
superintendent Association would be
 
04:15:12.630 --> 04:15:12.640 align:start position:0%
willing to be part of lifting the
 
04:15:18.070 --> 04:15:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:20.670 --> 04:15:20.680 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
04:15:22.790 --> 04:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:15:25.670 --> 04:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question um which is about the
 
04:15:30.670 --> 04:15:30.680 align:start position:0%
end part of the proposed Bill lines 28
 
04:15:32.830 --> 04:15:32.840 align:start position:0%
29 which in addition to what has already
 
04:15:35.830 --> 04:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
been discussed would repeal the report
 
04:15:38.389 --> 04:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
on completion of the f ASA and I'm
 
04:15:41.750 --> 04:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
interested in your opinion on if we're
 
04:15:44.269 --> 04:15:44.279 align:start position:0%
not tracking how many students are
 
04:15:45.950 --> 04:15:45.960 align:start position:0%
completing it regardless of whether it's
 
04:15:49.030 --> 04:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
required or not how do we know how we're
 
04:15:52.429 --> 04:15:52.439 align:start position:0%
doing um again this is I in study for
 
04:15:55.229 --> 04:15:55.239 align:start position:0%
this uh question but I can tell you that
 
04:15:57.830 --> 04:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
there are um percentages and data
 
04:16:00.109 --> 04:16:00.119 align:start position:0%
relative to Fasto requirements and
 
04:16:03.189 --> 04:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
completion that existed prior to this so
 
04:16:04.830 --> 04:16:04.840 align:start position:0%
I would say that we rely on those same
 
04:16:06.429 --> 04:16:06.439 align:start position:0%
metrics to determine whether or not
 
04:16:08.109 --> 04:16:08.119 align:start position:0%
there's been enough IC in the number of
 
04:16:12.510 --> 04:16:12.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:14.910 --> 04:16:14.920 align:start position:0%
FAA is that data that you're referring
 
04:16:17.070 --> 04:16:17.080 align:start position:0%
to compiled by the federal government
 
04:16:19.229 --> 04:16:19.239 align:start position:0%
from how many are submitted or do we
 
04:16:21.070 --> 04:16:21.080 align:start position:0%
know where they I'm going to look over
 
04:16:22.910 --> 04:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
here at representative luno as he just
 
04:16:24.990 --> 04:16:25.000 align:start position:0%
spoke to the percentage so I'm assuming
 
04:16:28.389 --> 04:16:28.399 align:start position:0%
that you grabbed that from um that data
 
04:16:31.070 --> 04:16:31.080 align:start position:0%
from a source where you referenced
 
04:16:33.910 --> 04:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
Texas um so did you compare the New
 
04:16:35.670 --> 04:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire average to that or was just
 
04:16:37.670 --> 04:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
national average it was just Texas
 
04:16:40.510 --> 04:16:40.520 align:start position:0%
gotcha okay so I think that's certainly
 
04:16:41.710 --> 04:16:41.720 align:start position:0%
something that we could talk to our
 
04:16:43.830 --> 04:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
friends in higher education with as well
 
04:16:46.309 --> 04:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
and and and since I was directed in uh
 
04:16:52.030 --> 04:16:52.040 align:start position:0%
in that um uh the the New Hampshire
 
04:16:55.109 --> 04:16:55.119 align:start position:0%
requirement I believe either just went
 
04:16:57.830 --> 04:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
active this prior school year or it's
 
04:17:00.429 --> 04:17:00.439 align:start position:0%
this is it was it this prior school year
 
04:17:02.870 --> 04:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
I I believe it's this school year this
 
04:17:05.109 --> 04:17:05.119 align:start position:0%
school year so it prior yeah this excuse
 
04:17:07.429 --> 04:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
me this prior school year the one so the
 
04:17:10.429 --> 04:17:10.439 align:start position:0%
the the class graduating in June of
 
04:17:15.710 --> 04:17:15.720 align:start position:0%
2023 three so four four so so has not
 
04:17:17.830 --> 04:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
even gone active yet so we don't have
 
04:17:20.149 --> 04:17:20.159 align:start position:0%
any data to compare about how the law
 
04:17:23.429 --> 04:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
has affected um and I I don't know
 
04:17:24.910 --> 04:17:24.920 align:start position:0%
honestly how you would compare before
 
04:17:26.550 --> 04:17:26.560 align:start position:0%
and after if there is not an accurate
 
04:17:29.389 --> 04:17:29.399 align:start position:0%
accounting of whether or not there's a
 
04:17:31.870 --> 04:17:31.880 align:start position:0%
baseline well there there there is in
 
04:17:34.389 --> 04:17:34.399 align:start position:0%
the in the US Ed website you actually
 
04:17:36.790 --> 04:17:36.800 align:start position:0%
have state byst state and District
 
04:17:40.070 --> 04:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
District by District um number of
 
04:17:41.510 --> 04:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
students who have completed the pass and
 
04:17:42.950 --> 04:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
that was I guess that was my response to
 
04:17:44.750 --> 04:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
representative Damon is that there are
 
04:17:46.990 --> 04:17:47.000 align:start position:0%
metrics out there so whether or not
 
04:17:49.269 --> 04:17:49.279 align:start position:0%
school districts are filing a report
 
04:17:51.429 --> 04:17:51.439 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Education as a
 
04:17:53.870 --> 04:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
result of this legislation there is data
 
04:17:55.510 --> 04:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
out there that shows the completion rate
 
04:17:57.830 --> 04:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
of the fasta I think that was your
 
04:17:59.710 --> 04:17:59.720 align:start position:0%
question to me representative
 
04:18:01.870 --> 04:18:01.880 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher thank you Mr
 
04:18:03.830 --> 04:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for your testimony
 
04:18:06.109 --> 04:18:06.119 align:start position:0%
um very simple question would it
 
04:18:06.119 --> 04:18:07.550 align:start position:0%
um very simple question would it
surprise

04:18:07.550 --> 04:18:07.560 align:start position:0%
surprise
 
04:18:11.149 --> 04:18:11.159 align:start position:0%
you that under a circumstance where the
 
04:18:13.630 --> 04:18:13.640 align:start position:0%
government was no longer forcing
 
04:18:15.189 --> 04:18:15.199 align:start position:0%
somebody to do something but allowing
 
04:18:16.950 --> 04:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
them to use their choice of whether or
 
04:18:19.630 --> 04:18:19.640 align:start position:0%
not to do it and providing that choice
 
04:18:23.630 --> 04:18:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:26.710 --> 04:18:26.720 align:start position:0%
little um I mean I guess anything's
 
04:18:29.269 --> 04:18:29.279 align:start position:0%
possible so I that's a pretty open-ended
 
04:18:29.279 --> 04:18:30.990 align:start position:0%
possible so I that's a pretty open-ended
question

04:18:30.990 --> 04:18:31.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:18:33.429 --> 04:18:33.439 align:start position:0%
so any further
 
04:18:35.389 --> 04:18:35.399 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much for your
 
04:18:38.910 --> 04:18:38.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:50.070 --> 04:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:52.870 --> 04:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
Raymond thank
 
04:18:56.349 --> 04:18:56.359 align:start position:0%
you yeah pres much more oh it's oh it
 
04:19:00.189 --> 04:19:00.199 align:start position:0%
left on sorry confused by the bot in um
 
04:19:01.710 --> 04:19:01.720 align:start position:0%
so I'm Heather Raymond I'm
 
04:19:04.269 --> 04:19:04.279 align:start position:0%
representative for Hillsboro um District
 
04:19:07.389 --> 04:19:07.399 align:start position:0%
5 that's NASA um in addition to being a
 
04:19:09.550 --> 04:19:09.560 align:start position:0%
State Rep I'm also on the national board
 
04:19:11.149 --> 04:19:11.159 align:start position:0%
of education and I've been on the board
 
04:19:14.870 --> 04:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
of education for the last six years I
 
04:19:16.149 --> 04:19:16.159 align:start position:0%
have to count backwards it's been a
 
04:19:18.109 --> 04:19:18.119 align:start position:0%
while um and I'm a parent of a high
 
04:19:20.550 --> 04:19:20.560 align:start position:0%
schooler and a middle schooler in ASA um
 
04:19:23.910 --> 04:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
so um when I was approached on this bill
 
04:19:26.870 --> 04:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
um about being a co-sponsor I was
 
04:19:29.229 --> 04:19:29.239 align:start position:0%
hesitant because I don't agree with a
 
04:19:32.389 --> 04:19:32.399 align:start position:0%
lot of things um with some of the
 
04:19:35.229 --> 04:19:35.239 align:start position:0%
sponsors but we do agree on this I sat
 
04:19:38.630 --> 04:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
down and um mat with our superintendent
 
04:19:41.590 --> 04:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
our guidance team um and our assistant
 
04:19:44.790 --> 04:19:44.800 align:start position:0%
superintendent um in nsha um and you'll
 
04:19:46.590 --> 04:19:46.600 align:start position:0%
notice the letter I passed out that our
 
04:19:48.229 --> 04:19:48.239 align:start position:0%
superintendent is one of the ones that
 
04:19:51.790 --> 04:19:51.800 align:start position:0%
wrote the letter um in nasua our
 
04:19:54.590 --> 04:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
concerns about the FASA requirement are
 
04:19:55.950 --> 04:19:55.960 align:start position:0%
significantly different than the
 
04:19:57.790 --> 04:19:57.800 align:start position:0%
concerns that I think some of the other
 
04:20:00.750 --> 04:20:00.760 align:start position:0%
sponsors have about this um we're not so
 
04:20:02.510 --> 04:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
much concerned about the fact that the
 
04:20:04.389 --> 04:20:04.399 align:start position:0%
government is collecting information
 
04:20:06.070 --> 04:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
because a lot of this information is
 
04:20:07.870 --> 04:20:07.880 align:start position:0%
stuff that people are already submitting
 
04:20:09.830 --> 04:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
to the IRS every year when they file
 
04:20:15.469 --> 04:20:15.479 align:start position:0%
their taxes um our concern is about um
 
04:20:17.710 --> 04:20:17.720 align:start position:0%
how this is going to impact our students
 
04:20:20.550 --> 04:20:20.560 align:start position:0%
and whether or not um it is appropriate
 
04:20:22.269 --> 04:20:22.279 align:start position:0%
to restrict their access to their
 
04:20:24.750 --> 04:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
diploma based on whether or not their
 
04:20:28.109 --> 04:20:28.119 align:start position:0%
parent or Guardian has completed a form
 
04:20:30.630 --> 04:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
whether it be the FAFSA form or the
 
04:20:33.910 --> 04:20:33.920 align:start position:0%
waiver form so just some some
 
04:20:36.510 --> 04:20:36.520 align:start position:0%
information about NASA nasua launch
 
04:20:39.510 --> 04:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
launched um a free Chromebook free a
 
04:20:42.469 --> 04:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
Chromebook program for our students last
 
04:20:44.469 --> 04:20:44.479 align:start position:0%
year we started with high schools and
 
04:20:46.070 --> 04:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
then we expanded it to the Middle School
 
04:20:49.229 --> 04:20:49.239 align:start position:0%
this year all parents or Guardians need
 
04:20:52.910 --> 04:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
to do is sign the Chromebook agreement
 
04:20:55.950 --> 04:20:55.960 align:start position:0%
which we sent home with every student
 
04:20:58.910 --> 04:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
last year and this year and in exchange
 
04:21:02.189 --> 04:21:02.199 align:start position:0%
for that each student gets a Chromebook
 
04:21:04.870 --> 04:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
that they keep with them for the
 
04:21:06.870 --> 04:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
remainder of their time at school
 
04:21:09.070 --> 04:21:09.080 align:start position:0%
there's no charge for this if it breaks
 
04:21:11.309 --> 04:21:11.319 align:start position:0%
they bring it back we fix it um because
 
04:21:13.149 --> 04:21:13.159 align:start position:0%
we use so much online curriculum we
 
04:21:14.750 --> 04:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
wanted our students to have access to
 
04:21:19.750 --> 04:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
that at all times nashaa has about 5,000
 
04:21:21.990 --> 04:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
students in the secondary level a little
 
04:21:25.630 --> 04:21:25.640 align:start position:0%
bit more of those 5,000 students 300
 
04:21:28.510 --> 04:21:28.520 align:start position:0%
still in January have not been able to
 
04:21:30.510 --> 04:21:30.520 align:start position:0%
obtain a signature from a parent or
 
04:21:33.590 --> 04:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
Guardian to get a free Chromebook these
 
04:21:37.189 --> 04:21:37.199 align:start position:0%
are 300 students who don't don't have a
 
04:21:41.189 --> 04:21:41.199 align:start position:0%
trusted adult that can sign a form to
 
04:21:42.870 --> 04:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
give them a device to help them with
 
04:21:42.880 --> 04:21:43.630 align:start position:0%
give them a device to help them with
their

04:21:43.630 --> 04:21:43.640 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:21:45.950 --> 04:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
education now we've done a lot of
 
04:21:48.070 --> 04:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
Outreach there are phone calls home
 
04:21:50.590 --> 04:21:50.600 align:start position:0%
there are emails home there are letters
 
04:21:52.950 --> 04:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
home we've sent guidance counselers out
 
04:21:56.229 --> 04:21:56.239 align:start position:0%
to homes and at this point we've
 
04:21:57.870 --> 04:21:57.880 align:start position:0%
resigned ourselves to Simply having
 
04:21:59.910 --> 04:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
these students pick up their issued
 
04:22:01.910 --> 04:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
Chromebook when they get to school and
 
04:22:03.670 --> 04:22:03.680 align:start position:0%
then leave it when they leave for the
 
04:22:06.910 --> 04:22:06.920 align:start position:0%
end of the day um our con concern and
 
04:22:09.149 --> 04:22:09.159 align:start position:0%
the concern of our guidance department
 
04:22:12.990 --> 04:22:13.000 align:start position:0%
is that this requirement of a signature
 
04:22:14.590 --> 04:22:14.600 align:start position:0%
and it's not just a signature on the
 
04:22:15.950 --> 04:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
waiver form because really we're asking
 
04:22:17.750 --> 04:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
people to go to the website and fill out
 
04:22:20.590 --> 04:22:20.600 align:start position:0%
the FAFSA it's going to leave these kids
 
04:22:23.030 --> 04:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
our most vulnerable
 
04:22:26.990 --> 04:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
kids with without with with a without a
 
04:22:29.189 --> 04:22:29.199 align:start position:0%
path to getting their diploma right
 
04:22:30.830 --> 04:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
these are kids who are showing up to
 
04:22:33.309 --> 04:22:33.319 align:start position:0%
school every day they're doing their
 
04:22:36.349 --> 04:22:36.359 align:start position:0%
part and they don't have a trusted adult
 
04:22:38.750 --> 04:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
who's willing to do their part and it's
 
04:22:41.229 --> 04:22:41.239 align:start position:0%
just it simply feels like an inequity
 
04:22:42.990 --> 04:22:43.000 align:start position:0%
for us to then say you didn't meet the
 
04:22:45.229 --> 04:22:45.239 align:start position:0%
prerequisites for your diploma that you
 
04:22:47.229 --> 04:22:47.239 align:start position:0%
just worked four years to
 
04:22:50.670 --> 04:22:50.680 align:start position:0%
earn we're really really concerned about
 
04:22:53.349 --> 04:22:53.359 align:start position:0%
that um if we hadn't launched the
 
04:22:54.910 --> 04:22:54.920 align:start position:0%
Chromebook program I don't know that we
 
04:22:58.309 --> 04:22:58.319 align:start position:0%
would have the same concern um but we
 
04:23:00.149 --> 04:23:00.159 align:start position:0%
know that it's very difficult the other
 
04:23:03.429 --> 04:23:03.439 align:start position:0%
issue that we've noticed in NWA um which
 
04:23:04.870 --> 04:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
I I just want to point out to the
 
04:23:06.990 --> 04:23:07.000 align:start position:0%
committee and it even if you were to
 
04:23:09.309 --> 04:23:09.319 align:start position:0%
pass this bill I don't think it could
 
04:23:11.269 --> 04:23:11.279 align:start position:0%
change in time for this graduation
 
04:23:13.149 --> 04:23:13.159 align:start position:0%
because the bill would take in effect in
 
04:23:15.910 --> 04:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
July this year the federal government
 
04:23:18.269 --> 04:23:18.279 align:start position:0%
redid the FAFSA it was supposed to come
 
04:23:21.550 --> 04:23:21.560 align:start position:0%
out in October it was released on
 
04:23:24.910 --> 04:23:24.920 align:start position:0%
Friday and only to some people there are
 
04:23:27.149 --> 04:23:27.159 align:start position:0%
still people in my district who cannot
 
04:23:29.269 --> 04:23:29.279 align:start position:0%
who want to do the FAFSA who have kids
 
04:23:31.469 --> 04:23:31.479 align:start position:0%
who are ready to go to college who
 
04:23:34.670 --> 04:23:34.680 align:start position:0%
cannot get on to fill out the FAFSA our
 
04:23:36.870 --> 04:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
school file a FAFSA night that we
 
04:23:38.710 --> 04:23:38.720 align:start position:0%
sponsor and our guidance counselors do
 
04:23:41.630 --> 04:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
like an information session is on uh
 
04:23:44.870 --> 04:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
January 18th it works best if parents
 
04:23:46.550 --> 04:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
have filled out part because there's a
 
04:23:48.229 --> 04:23:48.239 align:start position:0%
two parts to the FAA the parents have to
 
04:23:49.790 --> 04:23:49.800 align:start position:0%
sign something and then the kids have to
 
04:23:52.309 --> 04:23:52.319 align:start position:0%
fill out some stuff it works best if the
 
04:23:53.710 --> 04:23:53.720 align:start position:0%
parents have done that but we're
 
04:23:55.750 --> 04:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
actually talking about in The District
 
04:23:57.710 --> 04:23:57.720 align:start position:0%
delaying our file of fafs a night
 
04:23:59.670 --> 04:23:59.680 align:start position:0%
another few weeks to give people the
 
04:24:02.830 --> 04:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity to go on and do it um and so
 
04:24:05.590 --> 04:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
you know the the the Crux of it is is
 
04:24:07.990 --> 04:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
that we Rec recogniz that um going to
 
04:24:09.910 --> 04:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
college is important we also recognize
 
04:24:12.389 --> 04:24:12.399 align:start position:0%
that some trade schools accept the FAFSA
 
04:24:13.830 --> 04:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
in Nashville we have one of the largest
 
04:24:17.429 --> 04:24:17.439 align:start position:0%
CTE programs we have 1300 students in 16
 
04:24:20.269 --> 04:24:20.279 align:start position:0%
programs and over 40 classes these kids
 
04:24:22.750 --> 04:24:22.760 align:start position:0%
may or may not choose to go to college
 
04:24:25.149 --> 04:24:25.159 align:start position:0%
but we really don't want to hang on to a
 
04:24:27.349 --> 04:24:27.359 align:start position:0%
diploma that a child has earned because
 
04:24:29.670 --> 04:24:29.680 align:start position:0%
of a lack of a signature from a parent
 
04:24:33.229 --> 04:24:33.239 align:start position:0%
or a guardian
 
04:24:36.950 --> 04:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much representative
 
04:24:39.030 --> 04:24:39.040 align:start position:0%
Hall thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:24:40.750 --> 04:24:40.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my question can you just tell
 
04:24:42.870 --> 04:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
me the date that this letter was written
 
04:24:46.349 --> 04:24:46.359 align:start position:0%
that you you said you were I don't know
 
04:24:49.389 --> 04:24:49.399 align:start position:0%
I met with the
 
04:24:53.070 --> 04:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
superintendent um I know the the last
 
04:24:55.750 --> 04:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
week in August and he had had this and
 
04:24:58.109 --> 04:24:58.119 align:start position:0%
said hey I had I I had sent this to it
 
04:25:00.229 --> 04:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure the date that this was
 
04:25:02.910 --> 04:25:02.920 align:start position:0%
sent originally I just noticed names on
 
04:25:04.309 --> 04:25:04.319 align:start position:0%
here they're not really superintendents
 
04:25:07.229 --> 04:25:07.239 align:start position:0%
anymore so I'm thinking this for this
 
04:25:11.750 --> 04:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
was probably submitted before black bill
 
04:25:14.189 --> 04:25:14.199 align:start position:0%
so these folks haven't lived through the
 
04:25:17.070 --> 04:25:17.080 align:start position:0%
new legislation no and and it hasn't
 
04:25:18.910 --> 04:25:18.920 align:start position:0%
taken effect so the the students who
 
04:25:20.990 --> 04:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
will be impacted in my district are the
 
04:25:22.510 --> 04:25:22.520 align:start position:0%
students graduating this year so our
 
04:25:22.520 --> 04:25:23.670 align:start position:0%
students graduating this year so our
current

04:25:23.670 --> 04:25:23.680 align:start position:0%
current
 
04:25:26.469 --> 04:25:26.479 align:start position:0%
seniors okay thank you representative
 
04:25:28.750 --> 04:25:28.760 align:start position:0%
luno thank you very much Mr chair and
 
04:25:30.830 --> 04:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
thanks very much for uh for joining us
 
04:25:36.670 --> 04:25:36.680 align:start position:0%
so um so is is the um are the princip
 
04:25:42.269 --> 04:25:42.279 align:start position:0%
at um at the nsha high schools I guess
 
04:25:46.469 --> 04:25:46.479 align:start position:0%
um not interested in I mean I I guess
 
04:25:48.950 --> 04:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying is are are are they are
 
04:25:54.469 --> 04:25:54.479 align:start position:0%
they planning to resist um uh providing
 
04:25:56.950 --> 04:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
you know a waiver that attests to the
 
04:25:58.870 --> 04:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
the schools or or I mean are they
 
04:26:00.670 --> 04:26:00.680 align:start position:0%
unwilling to do that because it seems
 
04:26:02.990 --> 04:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
pretty simple in the state law at the
 
04:26:05.670 --> 04:26:05.680 align:start position:0%
end of the day can wave it all right at
 
04:26:07.790 --> 04:26:07.800 align:start position:0%
the end of day I don't believe that um
 
04:26:09.590 --> 04:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
our principles will allow students who
 
04:26:12.429 --> 04:26:12.439 align:start position:0%
have earned the diploma to not get their
 
04:26:13.910 --> 04:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
diploma right I think at the end of the
 
04:26:16.149 --> 04:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
day we're going to do what we need to do
 
04:26:17.630 --> 04:26:17.640 align:start position:0%
however the question is is there a
 
04:26:19.710 --> 04:26:19.720 align:start position:0%
penalty for that I don't know they asked
 
04:26:23.429 --> 04:26:23.439 align:start position:0%
me I don't know the answer so um but I
 
04:26:25.790 --> 04:26:25.800 align:start position:0%
don't know that that is I understand
 
04:26:27.349 --> 04:26:27.359 align:start position:0%
that that's an opt out I don't know that
 
04:26:29.070 --> 04:26:29.080 align:start position:0%
that's in keeping with the spirit of the
 
04:26:31.269 --> 04:26:31.279 align:start position:0%
idea of making everyone follow FAA if we
 
04:26:33.030 --> 04:26:33.040 align:start position:0%
know that the principal can just wave
 
04:26:37.109 --> 04:26:37.119 align:start position:0%
you off well then how is that impacting
 
04:26:39.429 --> 04:26:39.439 align:start position:0%
you know how is that benefiting our
 
04:26:41.670 --> 04:26:41.680 align:start position:0%
students through through higher
 
04:26:44.710 --> 04:26:44.720 align:start position:0%
completion rates of the I guess my my
 
04:26:46.710 --> 04:26:46.720 align:start position:0%
other question then having met with the
 
04:26:47.870 --> 04:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
administrative team and the guidance
 
04:26:50.070 --> 04:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
team is how is higher completion rates
 
04:26:53.510 --> 04:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
of a FAFSA benefiting our students at
 
04:26:55.750 --> 04:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
large through personal financial
 
04:26:57.750 --> 04:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
literacy and understanding what the cost
 
04:26:59.870 --> 04:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
of college and what their what their

04:27:25.429 --> 04:27:25.439 align:start position:0%
dry thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
04:27:27.309 --> 04:27:27.319 align:start position:0%
committee uh for the record I'm
 
04:27:29.109 --> 04:27:29.119 align:start position:0%
representative Margaret dry I represent
 
04:27:32.070 --> 04:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County district 7 and I'm a
 
04:27:33.870 --> 04:27:33.880 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of this
 
04:27:36.429 --> 04:27:36.439 align:start position:0%
bill the very first call
 
04:27:39.710 --> 04:27:39.720 align:start position:0%
legislatively that I got 2024 was from a
 
04:27:43.590 --> 04:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
former member member um of the school
 
04:27:46.349 --> 04:27:46.359 align:start position:0%
district down in Manchester uh she's a
 
04:27:50.750 --> 04:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
former neighbor and uh she called to say
 
04:27:53.910 --> 04:27:53.920 align:start position:0%
what the heck what's this FAFSA thing
 
04:27:55.990 --> 04:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
that everybody had to fill out is this
 
04:27:59.630 --> 04:27:59.640 align:start position:0%
new and I told her it was and she said
 
04:28:03.109 --> 04:28:03.119 align:start position:0%
hm I have a long history as a teacher of
 
04:28:05.229 --> 04:28:05.239 align:start position:0%
US history and Civics to English
 
04:28:07.469 --> 04:28:07.479 align:start position:0%
language learn ERS and here's what I
 
04:28:10.229 --> 04:28:10.239 align:start position:0%
have to say about it she said this is an
 
04:28:13.630 --> 04:28:13.640 align:start position:0%
extra burden it's unnecessary because
 
04:28:15.189 --> 04:28:15.199 align:start position:0%
anybody can get help from a guidance
 
04:28:17.070 --> 04:28:17.080 align:start position:0%
counselor if they need help to fill out
 
04:28:20.389 --> 04:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
a FAFSA form and it's intrusive a lot of
 
04:28:22.469 --> 04:28:22.479 align:start position:0%
the families she works with don't want
 
04:28:25.590 --> 04:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
their personal information passed around
 
04:28:25.600 --> 04:28:26.590 align:start position:0%
their personal information passed around
or

04:28:26.590 --> 04:28:26.600 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:28:29.830 --> 04:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
disclosed she wondered why we were
 
04:28:32.790 --> 04:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
making state law about a federal form
 
04:28:36.750 --> 04:28:36.760 align:start position:0%
for a state education requirement
 
04:28:39.469 --> 04:28:39.479 align:start position:0%
graduation requirement and finally she
 
04:28:42.550 --> 04:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
just said it's just another thing for
 
04:28:45.469 --> 04:28:45.479 align:start position:0%
teachers and principles to have to do
 
04:28:47.149 --> 04:28:47.159 align:start position:0%
and I tend to agree with
 
04:28:49.830 --> 04:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
her in my own
 
04:28:52.510 --> 04:28:52.520 align:start position:0%
experience recently representative Hall
 
04:28:54.910 --> 04:28:54.920 align:start position:0%
and I were on the commission to study
 
04:28:57.830 --> 04:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
tourism and Hospitality education in New
 
04:29:00.269 --> 04:29:00.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from the very beginning of the
 
04:29:02.870 --> 04:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
hearings the people that were in the
 
04:29:05.790 --> 04:29:05.800 align:start position:0%
tourism and hospitality industry
 
04:29:09.189 --> 04:29:09.199 align:start position:0%
stressed how hard it was with this major
 
04:29:11.750 --> 04:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
hurdle they had to overcome to get
 
04:29:15.910 --> 04:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
staff with the idea that going to a tech
 
04:29:18.229 --> 04:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
school or learning a trade instead of
 
04:29:21.189 --> 04:29:21.199 align:start position:0%
going to college was somehow an inferior
 
04:29:24.990 --> 04:29:25.000 align:start position:0%
career choice it isn't but making
 
04:29:26.990 --> 04:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
filling out of FAFSA for
 
04:29:30.070 --> 04:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
graduation seems to perpetuate that
 
04:29:31.910 --> 04:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
idea it's something that they're
 
04:29:34.070 --> 04:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
fighting all the time and one of the
 
04:29:36.510 --> 04:29:36.520 align:start position:0%
major recommendations of the commission
 
04:29:39.349 --> 04:29:39.359 align:start position:0%
was to educate people that there are
 
04:29:41.189 --> 04:29:41.199 align:start position:0%
great career choices that can be made
 
04:29:45.389 --> 04:29:45.399 align:start position:0%
and but it don't necessarily involve
 
04:29:47.750 --> 04:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
College though this was a good
 
04:29:47.760 --> 04:29:49.510 align:start position:0%
College though this was a good
intentioned

04:29:49.510 --> 04:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
intentioned
 
04:29:51.229 --> 04:29:51.239 align:start position:0%
legislation I think that there are
 
04:29:53.630 --> 04:29:53.640 align:start position:0%
easier ways to get to the same place
 
04:29:56.070 --> 04:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
that we're going and I ask you to
 
04:29:57.389 --> 04:29:57.399 align:start position:0%
support this
 
04:30:00.630 --> 04:30:00.640 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you representative questions
 
04:30:03.389 --> 04:30:03.399 align:start position:0%
from the committee seen none thank you
 
04:30:03.399 --> 04:30:04.510 align:start position:0%
from the committee seen none thank you
very

04:30:04.510 --> 04:30:04.520 align:start position:0%
very
 
04:30:21.870 --> 04:30:21.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:25.550 --> 04:30:25.560 align:start position:0%
Banfield you thank you I'm in support of
 
04:30:28.990 --> 04:30:29.000 align:start position:0%
this bill um I think as a parental
 
04:30:30.870 --> 04:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
rights advocate in New Hampshire the
 
04:30:34.910 --> 04:30:34.920 align:start position:0%
feedback that I'm getting is um first of
 
04:30:34.920 --> 04:30:36.750 align:start position:0%
feedback that I'm getting is um first of
all

04:30:36.750 --> 04:30:36.760 align:start position:0%
all
 
04:30:40.189 --> 04:30:40.199 align:start position:0%
it's the opt-in opt out kind of approach
 
04:30:42.710 --> 04:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
to the fasta that you have to opt out of
 
04:30:46.189 --> 04:30:46.199 align:start position:0%
it versus opt in and whenever that's uh
 
04:30:47.950 --> 04:30:47.960 align:start position:0%
a situation and you have to file a
 
04:30:51.070 --> 04:30:51.080 align:start position:0%
waiver parents are saying uh you know my
 
04:30:52.429 --> 04:30:52.439 align:start position:0%
kid's going to come home I have to you
 
04:30:54.149 --> 04:30:54.159 align:start position:0%
have to fill out the fasta or I don't
 
04:30:55.950 --> 04:30:55.960 align:start position:0%
get to graduate and then they're filling
 
04:30:58.950 --> 04:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
out the fasta with no intention of ever
 
04:31:01.109 --> 04:31:01.119 align:start position:0%
really needing to do this maybe their
 
04:31:03.269 --> 04:31:03.279 align:start position:0%
child's going to a trade school or
 
04:31:06.870 --> 04:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
something uh we know that
 
04:31:09.229 --> 04:31:09.239 align:start position:0%
from prior testimony that a lot of times
 
04:31:11.790 --> 04:31:11.800 align:start position:0%
these forums are never get to the
 
04:31:13.349 --> 04:31:13.359 align:start position:0%
parents or the parents aren't familiar
 
04:31:15.030 --> 04:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
with it or they have no idea that this
 
04:31:17.870 --> 04:31:17.880 align:start position:0%
is required or that they can opt out of
 
04:31:21.349 --> 04:31:21.359 align:start position:0%
it so I think the the problem presents
 
04:31:22.990 --> 04:31:23.000 align:start position:0%
itself I think we've covered that I
 
04:31:24.950 --> 04:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
don't want to repeat that but those are
 
04:31:26.590 --> 04:31:26.600 align:start position:0%
the kinds of comments that I'm getting
 
04:31:27.910 --> 04:31:27.920 align:start position:0%
back from parents I know that that was
 
04:31:29.429 --> 04:31:29.439 align:start position:0%
brought up by representative Luna what
 
04:31:32.590 --> 04:31:32.600 align:start position:0%
kind of feedback are you getting um you
 
04:31:35.349 --> 04:31:35.359 align:start position:0%
know how many people will this impact in
 
04:31:37.990 --> 04:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
this State you have a fraction of of
 
04:31:40.149 --> 04:31:40.159 align:start position:0%
students who go on to college many of
 
04:31:43.030 --> 04:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
them don't uh why are they required to
 
04:31:45.189 --> 04:31:45.199 align:start position:0%
fill this out because it's it's almost
 
04:31:47.309 --> 04:31:47.319 align:start position:0%
coercive in a way if you don't fill this
 
04:31:50.030 --> 04:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
out your child's not graduating oh but
 
04:31:51.710 --> 04:31:51.720 align:start position:0%
we'll go ahead and let you have a waiver
 
04:31:54.269 --> 04:31:54.279 align:start position:0%
it's almost a coercive kind of approach
 
04:31:56.590 --> 04:31:56.600 align:start position:0%
to trying to get these kids to fill out
 
04:31:59.590 --> 04:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
of FASA uh parents that you know the
 
04:32:01.830 --> 04:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
Privacy was brought up yes the IRS is
 
04:32:03.070 --> 04:32:03.080 align:start position:0%
getting this but this is going to
 
04:32:05.710 --> 04:32:05.720 align:start position:0%
another agency what I heard mainly is
 
04:32:07.870 --> 04:32:07.880 align:start position:0%
not so much that the government's
 
04:32:09.389 --> 04:32:09.399 align:start position:0%
collecting this information it's more
 
04:32:11.389 --> 04:32:11.399 align:start position:0%
about you're sending it to another
 
04:32:13.070 --> 04:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
agency it has where there's an
 
04:32:14.870 --> 04:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity for a data breach that's
 
04:32:16.870 --> 04:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
really I think what what most concerns
 
04:32:18.429 --> 04:32:18.439 align:start position:0%
people is that you know is will there
 
04:32:21.229 --> 04:32:21.239 align:start position:0%
ever be a data breach um so those are
 
04:32:22.750 --> 04:32:22.760 align:start position:0%
the concerns I just wanted to share that
 
04:32:26.309 --> 04:32:26.319 align:start position:0%
with you thank you questions from the
 
04:32:29.389 --> 04:32:29.399 align:start position:0%
committee see none thank
 
04:32:34.429 --> 04:32:34.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:34.439 --> 04:32:39.790 align:start position:0%
 
Thornton

04:32:39.790 --> 04:32:39.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:41.229 --> 04:32:41.239 align:start position:0%
I was going to say good morning but I
 
04:32:43.269 --> 04:32:43.279 align:start position:0%
guess it's actually afternoon um my name
 
04:32:45.149 --> 04:32:45.159 align:start position:0%
is Christiana thoron I'm president of
 
04:32:48.189 --> 04:32:48.199 align:start position:0%
granite Advance uh formerly known as New
 
04:32:50.469 --> 04:32:50.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire higher education assistance
 
04:32:52.349 --> 04:32:52.359 align:start position:0%
Foundation um we're a Statewide
 
04:32:54.229 --> 04:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
nonprofit organization that's been
 
04:32:56.229 --> 04:32:56.239 align:start position:0%
working in the state um with students
 
04:32:59.269 --> 04:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
and families since the 1960s um and our
 
04:33:01.469 --> 04:33:01.479 align:start position:0%
primary goal is to help students and
 
04:33:04.510 --> 04:33:04.520 align:start position:0%
families as they prepare for um College
 
04:33:06.310 --> 04:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
and Career pathways and so we haven't
 
04:33:08.670 --> 04:33:08.680 align:start position:0%
taken a position on the bill but I
 
04:33:10.551 --> 04:33:10.561 align:start position:0%
thought if people had questions
 
04:33:13.869 --> 04:33:13.879 align:start position:0%
specifically about the FASA um what the
 
04:33:16.709 --> 04:33:16.719 align:start position:0%
current sort of requirements are um you
 
04:33:19.230 --> 04:33:19.240 align:start position:0%
know we our organization provides
 
04:33:21.670 --> 04:33:21.680 align:start position:0%
resources to help students families and
 
04:33:24.510 --> 04:33:24.520 align:start position:0%
school counselors to really understand
 
04:33:27.470 --> 04:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
what the FAFSA is um what the timelines
 
04:33:31.230 --> 04:33:31.240 align:start position:0%
are for getting it you know uh completed
 
04:33:35.150 --> 04:33:35.160 align:start position:0%
and submitted to um federal student aid
 
04:33:37.551 --> 04:33:37.561 align:start position:0%
um I will say that when we've been doing
 
04:33:39.670 --> 04:33:39.680 align:start position:0%
this work um for many many years prior
 
04:33:42.551 --> 04:33:42.561 align:start position:0%
to the law being passed um when the law
 
04:33:44.349 --> 04:33:44.359 align:start position:0%
passed I think we saw it as our
 
04:33:46.510 --> 04:33:46.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility to really ensure that
 
04:33:48.230 --> 04:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
school counselors and parents and
 
04:33:50.709 --> 04:33:50.719 align:start position:0%
students understood that there was now a
 
04:33:52.629 --> 04:33:52.639 align:start position:0%
requirement um and so we've really spent
 
04:33:54.670 --> 04:33:54.680 align:start position:0%
the past I guess maybe year and a half
 
04:33:56.949 --> 04:33:56.959 align:start position:0%
or so bringing together stakeholders to
 
04:34:00.189 --> 04:34:00.199 align:start position:0%
make sure that as long as the law um
 
04:34:02.629 --> 04:34:02.639 align:start position:0%
remains in effect that there is an
 
04:34:04.150 --> 04:34:04.160 align:start position:0%
understanding of what that requirement
 
04:34:06.269 --> 04:34:06.279 align:start position:0%
is and making sure that are supports to
 
04:34:07.869 --> 04:34:07.879 align:start position:0%
help those students to complete those
 
04:34:10.990 --> 04:34:11.000 align:start position:0%
forms um and so that's to answer the
 
04:34:13.189 --> 04:34:13.199 align:start position:0%
questions earlier um they were correct
 
04:34:16.789 --> 04:34:16.799 align:start position:0%
that the requirement um comes into place
 
04:34:20.269 --> 04:34:20.279 align:start position:0%
for this Academic Year um and so at this
 
04:34:22.230 --> 04:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
point in time this process is just
 
04:34:25.109 --> 04:34:25.119 align:start position:0%
starting um so in terms of what the
 
04:34:26.750 --> 04:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
outcomes are I think we don't really
 
04:34:29.709 --> 04:34:29.719 align:start position:0%
know that um yet as it was indicated the
 
04:34:33.590 --> 04:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
FAFSA opened up um in a I guess I would
 
04:34:38.310 --> 04:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
say a um not temporary um but a there's
 
04:34:41.789 --> 04:34:41.799 align:start position:0%
a new form um which has sought to reduce
 
04:34:43.510 --> 04:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
the number of questions on the Fafa it
 
04:34:45.230 --> 04:34:45.240 align:start position:0%
used to be over a 100 questions they've
 
04:34:46.750 --> 04:34:46.760 align:start position:0%
really tried to minimize that to make it
 
04:34:48.789 --> 04:34:48.799 align:start position:0%
a little bit easier for students to
 
04:34:51.109 --> 04:34:51.119 align:start position:0%
complete um that new form became
 
04:34:54.390 --> 04:34:54.400 align:start position:0%
available uh last week and I think over
 
04:34:56.789 --> 04:34:56.799 align:start position:0%
the next month students will start that
 
04:35:00.629 --> 04:35:00.639 align:start position:0%
process um of completing and we'll know
 
04:35:02.230 --> 04:35:02.240 align:start position:0%
better then I think as to what whether
 
04:35:03.750 --> 04:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
or not you know what is that impact in
 
04:35:06.551 --> 04:35:06.561 align:start position:0%
that correlation um the information
 
04:35:09.429 --> 04:35:09.439 align:start position:0%
about FAFSA um in terms of the number of
 
04:35:11.029 --> 04:35:11.039 align:start position:0%
students that complete you can go to
 
04:35:13.349 --> 04:35:13.359 align:start position:0%
federal student aid um there is a Fafa
 
04:35:14.949 --> 04:35:14.959 align:start position:0%
tracker there and you should be able to
 
04:35:17.470 --> 04:35:17.480 align:start position:0%
see what the completion rates are both
 
04:35:21.629 --> 04:35:21.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:24.070 --> 04:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
country thank you very much uh
 
04:35:24.080 --> 04:35:25.189 align:start position:0%
country thank you very much uh
representative

04:35:25.189 --> 04:35:25.199 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:35:27.269 --> 04:35:27.279 align:start position:0%
peternell thank you Mr chair thank you
 
04:35:29.349 --> 04:35:29.359 align:start position:0%
for taking my question can you tell me
 
04:35:32.230 --> 04:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
how long a facet takes to
 
04:35:35.551 --> 04:35:35.561 align:start position:0%
complete so that I think is the so this
 
04:35:37.990 --> 04:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
is a question that is in flux now so
 
04:35:40.070 --> 04:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
there was Congressional well Congress
 
04:35:41.949 --> 04:35:41.959 align:start position:0%
passed a piece of legislation that
 
04:35:44.830 --> 04:35:44.840 align:start position:0%
reduced it from 100 over 100 questions
 
04:35:48.429 --> 04:35:48.439 align:start position:0%
um I think it's now down to like 35 or
 
04:35:51.349 --> 04:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
so it's they've reduced it quite a bit
 
04:35:53.789 --> 04:35:53.799 align:start position:0%
how long that takes I'm not sure yet
 
04:35:56.269 --> 04:35:56.279 align:start position:0%
because the first people just started
 
04:35:58.709 --> 04:35:58.719 align:start position:0%
completing it last week um so I think
 
04:36:00.029 --> 04:36:00.039 align:start position:0%
they the goal is that it's going to
 
04:36:01.269 --> 04:36:01.279 align:start position:0%
minimize the amount of time that it
 
04:36:04.150 --> 04:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
takes but I think how long that is we're
 
04:36:07.670 --> 04:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
not quite sure follow up how long did it
 
04:36:10.830 --> 04:36:10.840 align:start position:0%
take in the old way the old test or the
 
04:36:12.109 --> 04:36:12.119 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry the old
 
04:36:14.670 --> 04:36:14.680 align:start position:0%
form I have not personally completed it
 
04:36:16.709 --> 04:36:16.719 align:start position:0%
yet I would say it probably depends on
 
04:36:18.670 --> 04:36:18.680 align:start position:0%
the complexity of your financial
 
04:36:21.269 --> 04:36:21.279 align:start position:0%
situation um and there before you had
 
04:36:23.551 --> 04:36:23.561 align:start position:0%
there wasn't a feeder from IRS
 
04:36:25.510 --> 04:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
information into the FASA and so one of
 
04:36:26.750 --> 04:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
the improvements they've made is that
 
04:36:28.750 --> 04:36:28.760 align:start position:0%
actually you don't have to re input the
 
04:36:30.269 --> 04:36:30.279 align:start position:0%
information that you've submitted to the
 
04:36:34.109 --> 04:36:34.119 align:start position:0%
IRS that it actually is integrated um so
 
04:36:36.029 --> 04:36:36.039 align:start position:0%
I think that should say some significant
 
04:36:39.429 --> 04:36:39.439 align:start position:0%
amount of time I think one thing I I had
 
04:36:42.670 --> 04:36:42.680 align:start position:0%
failed to mention um was just to
 
04:36:44.990 --> 04:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
recognize you know a couple of things
 
04:36:46.349 --> 04:36:46.359 align:start position:0%
that have been stated are absolutely
 
04:36:50.470 --> 04:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
true we do know that um the in the
 
04:36:52.590 --> 04:36:52.600 align:start position:0%
states that have had a requirement they
 
04:36:54.869 --> 04:36:54.879 align:start position:0%
have increased their completion of the
 
04:36:56.590 --> 04:36:56.600 align:start position:0%
FASA which in turn there is a
 
04:36:57.869 --> 04:36:57.879 align:start position:0%
correlation between the number of
 
04:36:59.230 --> 04:36:59.240 align:start position:0%
students that ultimately go on to
 
04:37:02.029 --> 04:37:02.039 align:start position:0%
college um I will also say I think the
 
04:37:04.150 --> 04:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
challenge has been that we are very well
 
04:37:07.789 --> 04:37:07.799 align:start position:0%
aware um that this has been a burden on
 
04:37:09.789 --> 04:37:09.799 align:start position:0%
um School administrators and school
 
04:37:12.029 --> 04:37:12.039 align:start position:0%
counselors and so our job has been to
 
04:37:14.670 --> 04:37:14.680 align:start position:0%
really not necessarily take any position
 
04:37:17.070 --> 04:37:17.080 align:start position:0%
on it but to say okay how can we support
 
04:37:18.670 --> 04:37:18.680 align:start position:0%
these students in making sure that the
 
04:37:20.629 --> 04:37:20.639 align:start position:0%
school counselors are aware of the
 
04:37:22.709 --> 04:37:22.719 align:start position:0%
requirement and give them as many tools
 
04:37:24.310 --> 04:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
and best practices to make it as
 
04:37:26.510 --> 04:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
seamless as possible um so I guess I
 
04:37:28.510 --> 04:37:28.520 align:start position:0%
would say I think all of the testimony
 
04:37:30.789 --> 04:37:30.799 align:start position:0%
today is you know I think there's
 
04:37:32.390 --> 04:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
there's truth in all of it and I think
 
04:37:35.230 --> 04:37:35.240 align:start position:0%
it's sort of been an evolution um I
 
04:37:36.949 --> 04:37:36.959 align:start position:0%
don't personally know like what is the
 
04:37:38.551 --> 04:37:38.561 align:start position:0%
right answer I think everybody has sort
 
04:37:41.070 --> 04:37:41.080 align:start position:0%
of indicated what some of the challenges
 
04:37:43.109 --> 04:37:43.119 align:start position:0%
are but also there is a tremendous
 
04:37:45.590 --> 04:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
benefit too and I think that's your role
 
04:37:48.470 --> 04:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
is to weigh those
 
04:37:51.750 --> 04:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
components thank you representative luno
 
04:37:53.230 --> 04:37:53.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and thank
 
04:37:55.269 --> 04:37:55.279 align:start position:0%
you very much Miss Thorton for uh for
 
04:37:57.590 --> 04:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
joining us this afternoon could you talk
 
04:38:00.869 --> 04:38:00.879 align:start position:0%
tell us a little bit about um uh how the
 
04:38:04.590 --> 04:38:04.600 align:start position:0%
FAFSA connects families with with pel
 
04:38:04.600 --> 04:38:05.470 align:start position:0%
FAFSA connects families with with pel
Grant

04:38:05.470 --> 04:38:05.480 align:start position:0%
Grant
 
04:38:08.869 --> 04:38:08.879 align:start position:0%
and um and potentially access to to
 
04:38:11.590 --> 04:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
fully paid Community College right so in
 
04:38:14.510 --> 04:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
order for a student to
 
04:38:17.709 --> 04:38:17.719 align:start position:0%
receive any type of federal or state
 
04:38:20.029 --> 04:38:20.039 align:start position:0%
financial aid um you have to have
 
04:38:24.510 --> 04:38:24.520 align:start position:0%
completed the Fafa um and so if you are
 
04:38:28.029 --> 04:38:28.039 align:start position:0%
going to get um a free um like a pel
 
04:38:30.189 --> 04:38:30.199 align:start position:0%
grant which would cover significant
 
04:38:32.310 --> 04:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
costs associated with either Community
 
04:38:35.910 --> 04:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
College um or you know for your
 
04:38:38.029 --> 04:38:38.039 align:start position:0%
institution you have to have completed
 
04:38:41.070 --> 04:38:41.080 align:start position:0%
the fasta so I think one of the
 
04:38:43.629 --> 04:38:43.639 align:start position:0%
challenges um that we do see from time
 
04:38:46.269 --> 04:38:46.279 align:start position:0%
to time is a student often time I have a
 
04:38:48.750 --> 04:38:48.760 align:start position:0%
son who's a junior in high school um
 
04:38:51.629 --> 04:38:51.639 align:start position:0%
getting his attention to focus on like
 
04:38:53.189 --> 04:38:53.199 align:start position:0%
hey you need to you know what are your
 
04:38:55.470 --> 04:38:55.480 align:start position:0%
plans what do you want to pursue um can
 
04:38:57.349 --> 04:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
be a challenge and you have situations
 
04:38:59.510 --> 04:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
where maybe a student isn't really
 
04:39:02.349 --> 04:39:02.359 align:start position:0%
thinking about whether or not college or
 
04:39:05.629 --> 04:39:05.639 align:start position:0%
career um Pursuit at a college is an
 
04:39:08.750 --> 04:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
option for them until later on in the
 
04:39:11.709 --> 04:39:11.719 align:start position:0%
year that puts them in a position of
 
04:39:13.910 --> 04:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
losing out on potential Financial
 
04:39:15.789 --> 04:39:15.799 align:start position:0%
Resources to be able to support that
 
04:39:17.629 --> 04:39:17.639 align:start position:0%
pathway and so I think the thought
 
04:39:19.390 --> 04:39:19.400 align:start position:0%
behind this initially really was making
 
04:39:22.150 --> 04:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
sure that even if a student decided not
 
04:39:25.070 --> 04:39:25.080 align:start position:0%
to pursue higher education if they had
 
04:39:27.029 --> 04:39:27.039 align:start position:0%
completed the paperwork and they made a
 
04:39:30.230 --> 04:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
last minute decision in let's say May or
 
04:39:32.349 --> 04:39:32.359 align:start position:0%
June that in fact they do want to go and
 
04:39:35.109 --> 04:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
start going to a local community commity
 
04:39:37.670 --> 04:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
College they would have that form
 
04:39:39.510 --> 04:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
completed and they would be eligible for
 
04:39:42.470 --> 04:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
that financial aid so that's I think I
 
04:39:45.628 --> 04:39:45.638 align:start position:0%
think that is sort of the the part to
 
04:39:47.030 --> 04:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
this that makes it challenging is if a
 
04:39:48.430 --> 04:39:48.440 align:start position:0%
student hasn't completed it they're not
 
04:39:50.550 --> 04:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
entitled to the aid um and that goes
 
04:39:52.990 --> 04:39:53.000 align:start position:0%
with some of those state require The
 
04:39:55.030 --> 04:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
Limited State funds we do have in order
 
04:39:56.470 --> 04:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
to be able to benefit from those you
 
04:39:58.628 --> 04:39:58.638 align:start position:0%
have to complete that
 
04:40:01.910 --> 04:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
form sure so thanks and this is this is
 
04:40:04.390 --> 04:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
a test going back to last Friday oh boy
 
04:40:08.230 --> 04:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
um do uh do you recall what Chancellor
 
04:40:10.390 --> 04:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
Rubenstein said with respect to the
 
04:40:12.430 --> 04:40:12.440 align:start position:0%
percentage of students at New Hampshire
 
04:40:15.190 --> 04:40:15.200 align:start position:0%
community colleges that are there on a
 
04:40:18.510 --> 04:40:18.520 align:start position:0%
pel gram I don't recall that number but
 
04:40:21.628 --> 04:40:21.638 align:start position:0%
I expect you do yeah it's it's it's a
 
04:40:24.190 --> 04:40:24.200 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's a significant number it's
 
04:40:27.470 --> 04:40:27.480 align:start position:0%
uh it's north of 25% of all of all
 
04:40:31.350 --> 04:40:31.360 align:start position:0%
community college students are receiving
 
04:40:33.750 --> 04:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
pel any further questions uh
 
04:40:33.760 --> 04:40:39.470 align:start position:0%
pel any further questions uh
representative

04:40:39.470 --> 04:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:41.868 --> 04:40:41.878 align:start position:0%
forward I know we've been talking a lot
 
04:40:44.270 --> 04:40:44.280 align:start position:0%
about college but I want to follow up on
 
04:40:47.270 --> 04:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
what was just asked you by my colleague
 
04:40:50.708 --> 04:40:50.718 align:start position:0%
aren't there s significant numbers of
 
04:40:54.110 --> 04:40:54.120 align:start position:0%
programs that require the FAA for
 
04:40:58.310 --> 04:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
funding that is not for college per se
 
04:41:01.550 --> 04:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
but for career paths that may differ
 
04:41:01.560 --> 04:41:02.910 align:start position:0%
but for career paths that may differ
from

04:41:02.910 --> 04:41:02.920 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:41:05.150 --> 04:41:05.160 align:start position:0%
college I I think
 
04:41:08.030 --> 04:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
um to representative Leno's point I
 
04:41:09.990 --> 04:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
think a lot of the programs through the
 
04:41:12.510 --> 04:41:12.520 align:start position:0%
community college system um that are
 
04:41:15.590 --> 04:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
preparing students for career pathways
 
04:41:18.830 --> 04:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
are likely those that would be eligible
 
04:41:20.910 --> 04:41:20.920 align:start position:0%
for some type of federal
 
04:41:23.150 --> 04:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
assistance and therefore in order to

04:41:28.840 --> 04:41:29.750 align:start position:0%
completed the F correct yeah thank you
represent

04:41:29.750 --> 04:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
represent
 
04:41:31.750 --> 04:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
belshire thank you Mr chair and thank
 
04:41:33.110 --> 04:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
you for being here to provide this
 
04:41:35.190 --> 04:41:35.200 align:start position:0%
information can ask a bit of a tough
 
04:41:36.430 --> 04:41:36.440 align:start position:0%
question I'm not sure if you have the
 
04:41:37.708 --> 04:41:37.718 align:start position:0%
answer but it's worthwhile if we can
 
04:41:42.110 --> 04:41:42.120 align:start position:0%
find out try um do you happen to know um
 
04:41:45.070 --> 04:41:45.080 align:start position:0%
of students who complete the FAFSA and
 
04:41:47.910 --> 04:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
go on to
 
04:41:52.270 --> 04:41:52.280 align:start position:0%
college do you know what percentage on
 
04:41:56.070 --> 04:41:56.080 align:start position:0%
average of their costs are taken care of
 
04:41:58.310 --> 04:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
by grants that do not have to be repaid
 
04:42:01.830 --> 04:42:01.840 align:start position:0%
versus what percentage is taken in
 
04:42:05.150 --> 04:42:05.160 align:start position:0%
loans uh that do have to be repaid yeah
 
04:42:06.990 --> 04:42:07.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that's not a question I'm
 
04:42:10.590 --> 04:42:10.600 align:start position:0%
prepared to answer I could certainly try
 
04:42:12.990 --> 04:42:13.000 align:start position:0%
to see if there's a resource that would
 
04:42:14.868 --> 04:42:14.878 align:start position:0%
have would tie those factors together
 
04:42:16.350 --> 04:42:16.360 align:start position:0%
but I'm not like not on the top of my
 
04:42:19.150 --> 04:42:19.160 align:start position:0%
head sure thank you was there any
 
04:42:21.910 --> 04:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
further questions of represent Damon
 
04:42:23.270 --> 04:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:42:25.230 --> 04:42:25.240 align:start position:0%
my question
 
04:42:29.350 --> 04:42:29.360 align:start position:0%
um so two parts one is there a deadline
 
04:42:31.670 --> 04:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
for completing the FAFSA in a given
 
04:42:33.708 --> 04:42:33.718 align:start position:0%
Academic Year and then would you please
 
04:42:35.510 --> 04:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
also comment
 
04:42:39.990 --> 04:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
on what I believe is correct that we run
 
04:42:41.788 --> 04:42:41.798 align:start position:0%
out of financial aid dollars and so
 
04:42:43.948 --> 04:42:43.958 align:start position:0%
folks who fill up F so later presumably
 
04:42:47.390 --> 04:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
are less likely to get financial help am
 
04:42:49.150 --> 04:42:49.160 align:start position:0%
I correct on that yeah you're correct
 
04:42:52.948 --> 04:42:52.958 align:start position:0%
that would be um so institutions so
 
04:42:54.910 --> 04:42:54.920 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen is um students
 
04:42:57.150 --> 04:42:57.160 align:start position:0%
are going to complete the form now
 
04:43:00.830 --> 04:43:00.840 align:start position:0%
starting February 1st the um the FAS
 
04:43:03.910 --> 04:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
that have been completed will be sent to
 
04:43:05.868 --> 04:43:05.878 align:start position:0%
Institution that the students for those
 
04:43:07.030 --> 04:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
students that know where they're
 
04:43:08.948 --> 04:43:08.958 align:start position:0%
interested in going that information
 
04:43:11.510 --> 04:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
will be sent over to those academic
 
04:43:13.310 --> 04:43:13.320 align:start position:0%
institutions they'll then utilize that
 
04:43:16.430 --> 04:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
to determine what grants federal
 
04:43:18.110 --> 04:43:18.120 align:start position:0%
financial aid are available to those
 
04:43:20.550 --> 04:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
students so there's definitely a benefit
 
04:43:22.948 --> 04:43:22.958 align:start position:0%
to getting started in that with that
 
04:43:25.070 --> 04:43:25.080 align:start position:0%
process earlier because individual
 
04:43:28.110 --> 04:43:28.120 align:start position:0%
institutions at some point do run out of
 
04:43:29.990 --> 04:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
the additional Financial Resources to
 
04:43:32.510 --> 04:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
provide for those types of
 
04:43:35.150 --> 04:43:35.160 align:start position:0%
Grants yeah
 
04:43:37.390 --> 04:43:37.400 align:start position:0%
so just to clarify if you were that
 
04:43:39.270 --> 04:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
student that you referenced a few
 
04:43:41.990 --> 04:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
minutes ago who wasn't focused on
 
04:43:44.110 --> 04:43:44.120 align:start position:0%
College and then late in their senior
 
04:43:46.868 --> 04:43:46.878 align:start position:0%
year became interested perhaps in
 
04:43:48.990 --> 04:43:49.000 align:start position:0%
applying to the local Community College
 
04:43:50.590 --> 04:43:50.600 align:start position:0%
they could fill out the fafs of then but
 
04:43:52.270 --> 04:43:52.280 align:start position:0%
they would be much less likely to get
 
04:43:54.390 --> 04:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
eight I think it depends on the
 
04:43:56.628 --> 04:43:56.638 align:start position:0%
institution and what their resources are
 
04:43:59.070 --> 04:43:59.080 align:start position:0%
available to thank you that may be a
 
04:44:01.550 --> 04:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
better question for this um New
 
04:44:03.470 --> 04:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school financial aid
 
04:44:06.670 --> 04:44:06.680 align:start position:0%
administrators probably answer that
 
04:44:08.990 --> 04:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
question thank you very much for your
 
04:44:10.910 --> 04:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
testimony thank
 
04:44:14.270 --> 04:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
you uh and we have one one more person
 
04:44:17.470 --> 04:44:17.480 align:start position:0%
to testify I believe uh rousan
 
04:44:25.510 --> 04:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:27.750 --> 04:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
minute I just wanted to speak a little
 
04:44:30.910 --> 04:44:30.920 align:start position:0%
bit with regards to um overreach and
 
04:44:34.990 --> 04:44:35.000 align:start position:0%
privacy concerns not all students have
 
04:44:38.470 --> 04:44:38.480 align:start position:0%
know their parents financials situation
 
04:44:41.110 --> 04:44:41.120 align:start position:0%
not all parents want their children even
 
04:44:43.510 --> 04:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
as Juniors and seniors in high schools
 
04:44:45.910 --> 04:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
to have that information disclosed the
 
04:44:47.868 --> 04:44:47.878 align:start position:0%
fact that the IRS is going to be
 
04:44:51.788 --> 04:44:51.798 align:start position:0%
providing information to the schools um
 
04:44:54.470 --> 04:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
to the counselors things like that
 
04:44:54.480 --> 04:44:55.628 align:start position:0%
to the counselors things like that
that's

04:44:55.628 --> 04:44:55.638 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:44:58.110 --> 04:44:58.120 align:start position:0%
concerning um I think what's really
 
04:45:00.350 --> 04:45:00.360 align:start position:0%
important in light of everything that's
 
04:45:03.628 --> 04:45:03.638 align:start position:0%
going on right now the least amount of
 
04:45:06.310 --> 04:45:06.320 align:start position:0%
responsib that our state
 
04:45:09.590 --> 04:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
legislators needs to have the the least
 
04:45:14.150 --> 04:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
amount of of oversight the the less
 
04:45:17.708 --> 04:45:17.718 align:start position:0%
amount liability involved because the
 
04:45:19.910 --> 04:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
bottom line here is you have kids that
 
04:45:23.670 --> 04:45:23.680 align:start position:0%
are in DHHS custody
 
04:45:27.150 --> 04:45:27.160 align:start position:0%
and the counselors may not know that but
 
04:45:28.868 --> 04:45:28.878 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is is that they're not
 
04:45:30.550 --> 04:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
going to be able to get their parents
 
04:45:32.868 --> 04:45:32.878 align:start position:0%
financial information the only other
 
04:45:35.628 --> 04:45:35.638 align:start position:0%
point is all of the community colleges
 
04:45:38.070 --> 04:45:38.080 align:start position:0%
everyone that I've ever worked with they
 
04:45:41.628 --> 04:45:41.638 align:start position:0%
do out Outreach in the schools if
 
04:45:43.990 --> 04:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
they're allowed to so there's absolutely
 
04:45:46.350 --> 04:45:46.360 align:start position:0%
no reason for this to be going on in the
 
04:45:49.430 --> 04:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
high schools when we can have Community
 
04:45:52.350 --> 04:45:52.360 align:start position:0%
College sometimes even sometimes even
 
04:45:55.948 --> 04:45:55.958 align:start position:0%
universities come in present give them
 
04:45:59.150 --> 04:45:59.160 align:start position:0%
the the the information they need let's
 
04:46:02.510 --> 04:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
get it out of the out of the counselors
 
04:46:04.270 --> 04:46:04.280 align:start position:0%
and the people that are working with our
 
04:46:06.070 --> 04:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
children's in the school because there's
 
04:46:09.670 --> 04:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
a huge potential for privacy violations
 
04:46:13.550 --> 04:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
as well as potential for this principal
 
04:46:16.110 --> 04:46:16.120 align:start position:0%
refused my son to graduate but that
 
04:46:18.948 --> 04:46:18.958 align:start position:0%
principal allowed that guy to graduate I
 
04:46:21.350 --> 04:46:21.360 align:start position:0%
don't think our state legislators want
 
04:46:23.590 --> 04:46:23.600 align:start position:0%
to be involved in that kind of
 
04:46:25.750 --> 04:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
litigation and I'm more than willing to
 
04:46:28.030 --> 04:46:28.040 align:start position:0%
take any com any uh comments or
 
04:46:29.628 --> 04:46:29.638 align:start position:0%
questions thank you and you were close
 
04:46:33.190 --> 04:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
to that one minute um any
 
04:46:36.110 --> 04:46:36.120 align:start position:0%
questions I seen none thank you very
 
04:46:39.470 --> 04:46:39.480 align:start position:0%
much and uh that will close the hearing
 
04:46:41.070 --> 04:46:41.080 align:start position:0%

04:46:44.310 --> 04:46:44.320 align:start position:0%

much for uh being
 
04:49:22.510 --> 04:49:22.520 align:start position:0%
here thank you Mr acting chair um I was
 
04:49:25.590 --> 04:49:25.600 align:start position:0%
told in the hall as I was running back
 
04:49:29.628 --> 04:49:29.638 align:start position:0%
um that a member is also having a short
 
04:49:31.788 --> 04:49:31.798 align:start position:0%
bio break right now so I told her I
 
04:49:32.628 --> 04:49:32.638 align:start position:0%
would go
 
04:49:35.948 --> 04:49:35.958 align:start position:0%
slowly um so some of you may remember me
 
04:49:39.310 --> 04:49:39.320 align:start position:0%
talking in the past about eclipses and
 
04:49:41.990 --> 04:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
whatnot I have already outed myself as a
 
04:49:45.190 --> 04:49:45.200 align:start position:0%
a bit of a Astro geek um in the past but
 
04:49:47.150 --> 04:49:47.160 align:start position:0%
for those of you who don't know I am I'm
 
04:49:48.470 --> 04:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
a member of the New Hampshire
 
04:49:52.270 --> 04:49:52.280 align:start position:0%
Astronomical Society and um we're going
 
04:49:54.470 --> 04:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
to have a total solar eclipse which is
 
04:49:57.350 --> 04:49:57.360 align:start position:0%
super duper exciting it's different from
 
04:49:59.190 --> 04:49:59.200 align:start position:0%
probably the vast majority of eclipses
 
04:50:00.910 --> 04:50:00.920 align:start position:0%
you've maybe lived through where it's
 
04:50:03.270 --> 04:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
like oh maybe the light looked weird for
 
04:50:05.470 --> 04:50:05.480 align:start position:0%
a minute or something or you did like a
 
04:50:08.150 --> 04:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
pinhole camera um a total solar eclipse
 
04:50:10.868 --> 04:50:10.878 align:start position:0%
is a totally totally different if you're
 
04:50:12.548 --> 04:50:12.558 align:start position:0%
in the path of totality totally
 
04:50:15.628 --> 04:50:15.638 align:start position:0%
different experience it uh historically
 
04:50:18.548 --> 04:50:18.558 align:start position:0%
it's it's ended Wars that's how powerful
 
04:50:22.990 --> 04:50:23.000 align:start position:0%
it is um so because it's so rare the
 
04:50:25.470 --> 04:50:25.480 align:start position:0%
last one that had the path of totality
 
04:50:27.030 --> 04:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
through New Hampshire was
 
04:50:30.190 --> 04:50:30.200 align:start position:0%
1956 the next one will be
 
04:50:34.190 --> 04:50:34.200 align:start position:0%
2079 um so in 2020 I put forward a bill
 
04:50:36.470 --> 04:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
I wanted to actually do something about
 
04:50:38.590 --> 04:50:38.600 align:start position:0%
the schools then but it ended up being a
 
04:50:40.788 --> 04:50:40.798 align:start position:0%
declaration to make the day of the total
 
04:50:43.270 --> 04:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
solar eclipse April 8th of this year a
 
04:50:46.350 --> 04:50:46.360 align:start position:0%
holiday had lots of very poetic language
 
04:50:50.110 --> 04:50:50.120 align:start position:0%
in it and 2020 being what 2020 was uh it
 
04:50:52.070 --> 04:50:52.080 align:start position:0%
didn't get through it got tabled with
 
04:50:53.708 --> 04:50:53.718 align:start position:0%
like something like 700 bills in the
 
04:50:56.030 --> 04:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
Senate so it was put back in the
 
04:50:57.948 --> 04:50:57.958 align:start position:0%
following year and signed into law by
 
04:51:01.590 --> 04:51:01.600 align:start position:0%
the governor but that bill didn't do
 
04:51:03.190 --> 04:51:03.200 align:start position:0%
anything about the original problem that
 
04:51:05.788 --> 04:51:05.798 align:start position:0%
I wanted to address which is in the path
 
04:51:09.190 --> 04:51:09.200 align:start position:0%
of totality the moment of totality will
 
04:51:12.628 --> 04:51:12.638 align:start position:0%
be at 3:30 p.m. which is right around
 
04:51:14.150 --> 04:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
the time the kids are getting out of
 
04:51:16.310 --> 04:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
school and right around the time parents
 
04:51:18.548 --> 04:51:18.558 align:start position:0%
are picking kids up from from school or
 
04:51:22.430 --> 04:51:22.440 align:start position:0%
after school activities also as any uh
 
04:51:24.830 --> 04:51:24.840 align:start position:0%
member of the New Hampshire Astronomical
 
04:51:26.230 --> 04:51:26.240 align:start position:0%
Society will tell you because many of
 
04:51:28.430 --> 04:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
them Eclipse Chase all over the country
 
04:51:30.150 --> 04:51:30.160 align:start position:0%
and some of them Eclipse Chase all over
 
04:51:33.788 --> 04:51:33.798 align:start position:0%
the world traffic will be horrendous
 
04:51:35.750 --> 04:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely horrendous anywhere that
 
04:51:37.390 --> 04:51:37.400 align:start position:0%
there's a total solar eclipse the path
 
04:51:42.390 --> 04:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
of totality traffic gets worse than than
 
04:51:44.510 --> 04:51:44.520 align:start position:0%
any concert or sporting event you've
 
04:51:47.708 --> 04:51:47.718 align:start position:0%
ever seen like four six even eight hour
 
04:51:50.510 --> 04:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
delays and where the path of totality is
 
04:51:54.190 --> 04:51:54.200 align:start position:0%
in our state is in Coos County where we
 
04:51:56.910 --> 04:51:56.920 align:start position:0%
don't have the infrastructure to handle
 
04:51:59.628 --> 04:51:59.638 align:start position:0%
the traffic that will be coming in so
 
04:52:02.110 --> 04:52:02.120 align:start position:0%
because of that I had originally wanted
 
04:52:05.150 --> 04:52:05.160 align:start position:0%
in that original uh declaration to to
 
04:52:07.788 --> 04:52:07.798 align:start position:0%
actually declare a holiday for
 
04:52:10.470 --> 04:52:10.480 align:start position:0%
schools um that bill having passed and
 
04:52:12.510 --> 04:52:12.520 align:start position:0%
being signed into law but not addressing
 
04:52:14.350 --> 04:52:14.360 align:start position:0%
the major problem I went to the
 
04:52:16.190 --> 04:52:16.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner back
 
04:52:20.430 --> 04:52:20.440 align:start position:0%
in September I believe and asked him
 
04:52:23.030 --> 04:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
could he do anything administratively
 
04:52:25.628 --> 04:52:25.638 align:start position:0%
about this oncoming kind of Crisis as I
 
04:52:28.990 --> 04:52:29.000 align:start position:0%
saw it and he when I explained the
 
04:52:32.030 --> 04:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
situation to him to my great surprise
 
04:52:34.390 --> 04:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
was very enthused to do something about
 
04:52:36.868 --> 04:52:36.878 align:start position:0%
this very excited to do something about
 
04:52:38.390 --> 04:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
this but he told me he didn't have the
 
04:52:40.030 --> 04:52:40.040 align:start position:0%
authority to actually do the ru making
 
04:52:42.310 --> 04:52:42.320 align:start position:0%
that he needed to do so he very much
 
04:52:45.390 --> 04:52:45.400 align:start position:0%
encouraged me to put in this bill and uh
 
04:52:46.750 --> 04:52:46.760 align:start position:0%
said that he would give it its full
 
04:52:49.110 --> 04:52:49.120 align:start position:0%
support because we are operating in the
 
04:52:52.190 --> 04:52:52.200 align:start position:0%
same year as the eclipse and the eclipse
 
04:52:54.830 --> 04:52:54.840 align:start position:0%
is going to be April 8th the sun waits
 
04:52:57.868 --> 04:52:57.878 align:start position:0%
for no one I've asked with the help of
 
04:52:59.470 --> 04:52:59.480 align:start position:0%
the commissioner for this bill to be
 
04:53:01.750 --> 04:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
fast-tracked so going into the details
 
04:53:03.708 --> 04:53:03.718 align:start position:0%
of what the bill actually does so most
 
04:53:06.270 --> 04:53:06.280 align:start position:0%
of it is just an encouragement it allows
 
04:53:10.150 --> 04:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
for flexibility for schools to do um a
 
04:53:13.430 --> 04:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
half day early release remote learning
 
04:53:17.310 --> 04:53:17.320 align:start position:0%
that day or have in school uh viewing
 
04:53:19.510 --> 04:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
activities and other education so it
 
04:53:21.868 --> 04:53:21.878 align:start position:0%
gives schools real flexibility and
 
04:53:23.590 --> 04:53:23.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't mandate anything the only things
 
04:53:26.788 --> 04:53:26.798 align:start position:0%
that it actually does is say that on the
 
04:53:28.310 --> 04:53:28.320 align:start position:0%
day of the to solar eclipse there won't
 
04:53:31.350 --> 04:53:31.360 align:start position:0%
be mandatory attendance and any child
 
04:53:33.310 --> 04:53:33.320 align:start position:0%
traveling to view the solar eclipse will
 
04:53:36.070 --> 04:53:36.080 align:start position:0%
rece receive an excused absence um the
 
04:53:38.390 --> 04:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
other thing that it does is it gives the
 
04:53:40.270 --> 04:53:40.280 align:start position:0%
department rulemaking Authority
 
04:53:44.788 --> 04:53:44.798 align:start position:0%
regarding this matter so um like I said
 
04:53:47.270 --> 04:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
as I understand it um I do know that the
 
04:53:49.430 --> 04:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner has officially asked both
 
04:53:51.948 --> 04:53:51.958 align:start position:0%
the chairs of the house and the Senate
 
04:53:54.510 --> 04:53:54.520 align:start position:0%
committees to FasTrack this bill and
 
04:53:57.030 --> 04:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
support it um as I understand it that's
 
04:53:59.150 --> 04:53:59.160 align:start position:0%
what's being done and why I'm here on
 
04:54:02.390 --> 04:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
the first day of committee um and so I
 
04:54:04.910 --> 04:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
would also along those lines uh humbly
 
04:54:07.868 --> 04:54:07.878 align:start position:0%
ask if you all support this to execute
 
04:54:10.350 --> 04:54:10.360 align:start position:0%
as quickly as possible so with that I'm
 
04:54:12.948 --> 04:54:12.958 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions thank you any
 
04:54:15.590 --> 04:54:15.600 align:start position:0%
questions for the prime sponsor uh yes
 
04:54:17.750 --> 04:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
representative Hall thank you Mr chair
 
04:54:19.590 --> 04:54:19.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so is
 
04:54:22.470 --> 04:54:22.480 align:start position:0%
the the primary reason for safety you
 
04:54:24.628 --> 04:54:24.638 align:start position:0%
know traffic and kids are going to be
 
04:54:26.150 --> 04:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
looking at the sun from the bus and
 
04:54:29.310 --> 04:54:29.320 align:start position:0%
whatever or is it more interest in
 
04:54:33.030 --> 04:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
science so for me personally but I don't
 
04:54:34.310 --> 04:54:34.320 align:start position:0%
know that I would have put a bill in
 
04:54:35.948 --> 04:54:35.958 align:start position:0%
just for this personal reason my
 
04:54:37.948 --> 04:54:37.958 align:start position:0%
interest is in science in teaching the
 
04:54:41.310 --> 04:54:41.320 align:start position:0%
kids what's going on and to that ex to
 
04:54:43.750 --> 04:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
that effect my organization New
 
04:54:46.270 --> 04:54:46.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Astronomical Society has
 
04:54:50.670 --> 04:54:50.680 align:start position:0%
offered to provide doe with um example
 
04:54:53.548 --> 04:54:53.558 align:start position:0%
uh like curricula for the different
 
04:54:56.750 --> 04:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
grade levels um for for studying this
 
04:54:59.230 --> 04:54:59.240 align:start position:0%
phenomenon however the reason I think it
 
04:55:01.310 --> 04:55:01.320 align:start position:0%
Rose to the level that I felt the need
 
04:55:03.070 --> 04:55:03.080 align:start position:0%
to go the commissioner and say can you
 
04:55:03.910 --> 04:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
do something
 
04:55:06.830 --> 04:55:06.840 align:start position:0%
is because the traffic will be so bad at
 
04:55:09.510 --> 04:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
the same exact time and and the the
 
04:55:11.430 --> 04:55:11.440 align:start position:0%
darkness happening at the same exact
 
04:55:13.750 --> 04:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
time as the kids will be either in like
 
04:55:15.350 --> 04:55:15.360 align:start position:0%
going into after school activities or
 
04:55:16.470 --> 04:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
waiting for their parents to pick them
 
04:55:19.190 --> 04:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
up like it will be a mess for all of
 
04:55:21.270 --> 04:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
that to be happening at once especially
 
04:55:23.590 --> 04:55:23.600 align:start position:0%
in the path of totality so because of
 
04:55:25.708 --> 04:55:25.718 align:start position:0%
that that's why I felt it needed to kind
 
04:55:27.430 --> 04:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
of be
 
04:55:32.390 --> 04:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:35.310 --> 04:55:35.320 align:start position:0%
lakas listening to that I forgot my
 
04:55:37.070 --> 04:55:37.080 align:start position:0%
question asked oh I know what it was
 
04:55:40.350 --> 04:55:40.360 align:start position:0%
rule making do we actually need rule
 
04:55:42.910 --> 04:55:42.920 align:start position:0%
making because that takes time and if we
 
04:55:44.548 --> 04:55:44.558 align:start position:0%
want it to go
 
04:55:47.310 --> 04:55:47.320 align:start position:0%
through quickly what kind of rule making
 
04:55:50.990 --> 04:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
do we actually need so the the language
 
04:55:52.868 --> 04:55:52.878 align:start position:0%
that is before you is the language that
 
04:55:56.948 --> 04:55:56.958 align:start position:0%
I received from the commissioner and his
 
04:55:59.150 --> 04:55:59.160 align:start position:0%
advisers that helped him with this
 
04:56:01.270 --> 04:56:01.280 align:start position:0%
language so I just put in what they
 
04:56:03.948 --> 04:56:03.958 align:start position:0%
requested um I don't know how quickly
 
04:56:06.590 --> 04:56:06.600 align:start position:0%
they can can do that I do know as an
 
04:56:08.150 --> 04:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
aside as part of that same conversation
 
04:56:09.548 --> 04:56:09.558 align:start position:0%
with the commissioner that he's planning
 
04:56:11.788 --> 04:56:11.798 align:start position:0%
on purchasing 60,000 solar eclipse
 
04:56:14.430 --> 04:56:14.440 align:start position:0%
classes for every student in the state
 
04:56:16.510 --> 04:56:16.520 align:start position:0%
that's cool thank
 
04:56:19.750 --> 04:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
you um yes representative
 
04:56:22.548 --> 04:56:22.558 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank thank you Mr chair good
 
04:56:24.070 --> 04:56:24.080 align:start position:0%
afternoon and I can see you perfect
 
04:56:26.670 --> 04:56:26.680 align:start position:0%
right now it's perfect um this singular
 
04:56:28.830 --> 04:56:28.840 align:start position:0%
one day event that happens typically
 
04:56:32.230 --> 04:56:32.240 align:start position:0%
after school hours it's 3:30 right uh
 
04:56:34.190 --> 04:56:34.200 align:start position:0%
two questions I made how long does that
 
04:56:38.310 --> 04:56:38.320 align:start position:0%
actually last about three minutes um so
 
04:56:39.470 --> 04:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
the second
 
04:56:42.628 --> 04:56:42.638 align:start position:0%
part me oh thank yeah followup that's
 
04:56:45.510 --> 04:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
exactly I ask thank you um thank you the
 
04:56:46.910 --> 04:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
second the second part of this the
 
04:56:49.230 --> 04:56:49.240 align:start position:0%
followup part was
 
04:56:52.708 --> 04:56:52.718 align:start position:0%
then parents so the time travel it's
 
04:56:54.070 --> 04:56:54.080 align:start position:0%
going to be the time travel best
 
04:56:56.590 --> 04:56:56.600 align:start position:0%
locations they could find parents have
 
04:56:58.190 --> 04:56:58.200 align:start position:0%
the right to dismiss their youngster or
 
04:57:00.110 --> 04:57:00.120 align:start position:0%
excuse this youngster from a day I
 
04:57:01.628 --> 04:57:01.638 align:start position:0%
particular like the fact that the
 
04:57:03.390 --> 04:57:03.400 align:start position:0%
associations can provide curricular
 
04:57:05.270 --> 04:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
through the schools uh can make it a
 
04:57:08.670 --> 04:57:08.680 align:start position:0%
huge day in science in New Hampshire um
 
04:57:10.150 --> 04:57:10.160 align:start position:0%
so I but I have a high time
 
04:57:12.110 --> 04:57:12.120 align:start position:0%
understanding why we need to pass a law
 
04:57:13.910 --> 04:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
that is going to do this when parents
 
04:57:15.548 --> 04:57:15.558 align:start position:0%
can already do that the local school
 
04:57:17.350 --> 04:57:17.360 align:start position:0%
committees can already do that so the
 
04:57:19.670 --> 04:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner felt very strongly and I
 
04:57:21.510 --> 04:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
wasn't intending on having this bill
 
04:57:23.030 --> 04:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
until the commissioner encouraged me
 
04:57:24.788 --> 04:57:24.798 align:start position:0%
that we needed a bill to to give them
 
04:57:26.590 --> 04:57:26.600 align:start position:0%
the ability to do this administratively
 
04:57:28.548 --> 04:57:28.558 align:start position:0%
there may be districts I don't I can't
 
04:57:30.230 --> 04:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
speak for every district there may be
 
04:57:31.708 --> 04:57:31.718 align:start position:0%
districts that kind of aren't planning
 
04:57:33.470 --> 04:57:33.480 align:start position:0%
for this aren't preparing for this
 
04:57:35.548 --> 04:57:35.558 align:start position:0%
appropriately the problem is the moment
 
04:57:36.990 --> 04:57:37.000 align:start position:0%
of totality when everybody will be
 
04:57:40.430 --> 04:57:40.440 align:start position:0%
looking up and shortly before and after
 
04:57:43.510 --> 04:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
um when it's very dangerous to look up
 
04:57:46.788 --> 04:57:46.798 align:start position:0%
without the proper eyewear um will be
 
04:57:48.230 --> 04:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
happening right at the time where
 
04:57:51.030 --> 04:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
students may not have either a teacher
 
04:57:52.990 --> 04:57:53.000 align:start position:0%
to help direct them and teach them what
 
04:57:54.310 --> 04:57:54.320 align:start position:0%
they're seeing and teach them how to do
 
04:57:56.788 --> 04:57:56.798 align:start position:0%
it safely or their parents because it's
 
04:57:58.270 --> 04:57:58.280 align:start position:0%
in that kind of ambiguous time where
 
04:57:59.708 --> 04:57:59.718 align:start position:0%
they may be after school activities or
 
04:58:02.070 --> 04:58:02.080 align:start position:0%
they may be in transit and at the same
 
04:58:05.030 --> 04:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
time parents May be caught in the
 
04:58:07.548 --> 04:58:07.558 align:start position:0%
atrocious traffic that will exist at the
 
04:58:09.430 --> 04:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
same time so they may be kind of the
 
04:58:12.390 --> 04:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
students might be kind of left kind of
 
04:58:14.590 --> 04:58:14.600 align:start position:0%
in the Lurch in that exact moment where
 
04:58:17.190 --> 04:58:17.200 align:start position:0%
they need the guidance so that's that's
 
04:58:19.150 --> 04:58:19.160 align:start position:0%
why I think the commissioner and I both
 
04:58:21.190 --> 04:58:21.200 align:start position:0%
felt it needed to be
 
04:58:23.548 --> 04:58:23.558 align:start position:0%
addressed just one more but school thank
 
04:58:25.510 --> 04:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
you the last one the school is school
 
04:58:27.670 --> 04:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
under this process would not be out for
 
04:58:28.788 --> 04:58:28.798 align:start position:0%
the day because be having school
 
04:58:31.030 --> 04:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
activities teacher activities based on
 
04:58:33.350 --> 04:58:33.360 align:start position:0%
this options for that so I go I guess to
 
04:58:34.868 --> 04:58:34.878 align:start position:0%
go back to my original piece and
 
04:58:35.948 --> 04:58:35.958 align:start position:0%
particular if the commissioner is going
 
04:58:38.590 --> 04:58:38.600 align:start position:0%
to to fund uh everyone having glasses I
 
04:58:42.470 --> 04:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
hope for representes as well um
 
04:58:44.868 --> 04:58:44.878 align:start position:0%
that that at least on that particular
 
04:58:46.788 --> 04:58:46.798 align:start position:0%
day parents just dismiss their
 
04:58:49.430 --> 04:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
youngsters and don't doesn't require a
 
04:58:52.310 --> 04:58:52.320 align:start position:0%
law so it's a local option it's app
 
04:58:54.030 --> 04:58:54.040 align:start position:0%
parent he can say it's it's still a
 
04:58:55.670 --> 04:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
local option and the bill it's even a
 
04:58:57.948 --> 04:58:57.958 align:start position:0%
local option but for the rul making
 
04:58:59.750 --> 04:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
Authority or for the ability for the
 
04:59:02.310 --> 04:59:02.320 align:start position:0%
Department to handle it administratively
 
04:59:04.470 --> 04:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
whether that's official Ru making or not
 
04:59:05.910 --> 04:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
the commissioner felt very strongly he
 
04:59:09.670 --> 04:59:09.680 align:start position:0%
needed this bill so that's why it's here
 
04:59:12.708 --> 04:59:12.718 align:start position:0%
is because the commissioner requested it
 
04:59:14.670 --> 04:59:14.680 align:start position:0%
um that's a good reason thank you
 
04:59:15.788 --> 04:59:15.798 align:start position:0%
appreciate it representative are you
 
04:59:19.150 --> 04:59:19.160 align:start position:0%
suggesting we need the day off as well I
 
04:59:22.788 --> 04:59:22.798 align:start position:0%
I will add to that that uh I have in the
 
04:59:25.230 --> 04:59:25.240 align:start position:0%
past possibly I'm not sure if it was
 
04:59:27.430 --> 04:59:27.440 align:start position:0%
before you were in office I have passed
 
04:59:29.830 --> 04:59:29.840 align:start position:0%
out uh glasses eclipse glasses to
 
04:59:31.948 --> 04:59:31.958 align:start position:0%
members of the House Representative
 
04:59:34.830 --> 04:59:34.840 align:start position:0%
cascaden thank thank you um so coming
 
04:59:36.708 --> 04:59:36.718 align:start position:0%
from Coos County this has been a
 
04:59:40.230 --> 04:59:40.240 align:start position:0%
conversation uh for quite a long time
 
04:59:42.670 --> 04:59:42.680 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if you're aware several
 
04:59:44.590 --> 04:59:44.600 align:start position:0%
schools in New Hampshire have planned
 
04:59:47.548 --> 04:59:47.558 align:start position:0%
their Spring Breaks during that week and
 
04:59:49.548 --> 04:59:49.558 align:start position:0%
of course all of Coos school districts
 
04:59:52.470 --> 04:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
are closed for the day so I guess I
 
04:59:55.110 --> 04:59:55.120 align:start position:0%
wonder how many school districts would
 
04:59:57.590 --> 04:59:57.600 align:start position:0%
this apply to and why wouldn't it just
 
04:59:59.788 --> 04:59:59.798 align:start position:0%
be a written excuse that they're going
 
05:00:02.190 --> 05:00:02.200 align:start position:0%
because totality is in the North Country
 
05:00:04.868 --> 05:00:04.878 align:start position:0%
some people have never been there so
 
05:00:06.788 --> 05:00:06.798 align:start position:0%
even for school districts that are not
 
05:00:09.628 --> 05:00:09.638 align:start position:0%
in the path of totality we want to allow
 
05:00:12.830 --> 05:00:12.840 align:start position:0%
those kids to travel either to Coos or
 
05:00:14.948 --> 05:00:14.958 align:start position:0%
anywhere else in the country for that
 
05:00:18.430 --> 05:00:18.440 align:start position:0%
matter um for example in Texas it's kind
 
05:00:20.030 --> 05:00:20.040 align:start position:0%
of the Prime viewing location because
 
05:00:21.910 --> 05:00:21.920 align:start position:0%
they're almost guaranteed sunny skies on
 
05:00:25.230 --> 05:00:25.240 align:start position:0%
that day and um their moment of totality
 
05:00:28.230 --> 05:00:28.240 align:start position:0%
is the longest so we want to allow those
 
05:00:30.150 --> 05:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
students flexibility to travel to to
 
05:00:34.030 --> 05:00:34.040 align:start position:0%
view um a total solar eclipse but also
 
05:00:36.230 --> 05:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
even in the other school districts that
 
05:00:37.910 --> 05:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
are not in the path of totality even if
 
05:00:39.548 --> 05:00:39.558 align:start position:0%
students just step out into their own
 
05:00:42.868 --> 05:00:42.878 align:start position:0%
backyard they will be able to see a very
 
05:00:46.510 --> 05:00:46.520 align:start position:0%
um a very full partial eclipse it's not
 
05:00:47.868 --> 05:00:47.878 align:start position:0%
the same as a total solar eclipse you
 
05:00:49.150 --> 05:00:49.160 align:start position:0%
don't get that moment of complete
 
05:00:50.708 --> 05:00:50.718 align:start position:0%
darkness where everything just goes to
 
05:00:52.628 --> 05:00:52.638 align:start position:0%
midnight like someone turned off the
 
05:00:54.948 --> 05:00:54.958 align:start position:0%
lights but it is still impressive to see
 
05:00:58.150 --> 05:00:58.160 align:start position:0%
through your glasses
 
05:01:01.030 --> 05:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
nonetheless representative Hall thank
 
05:01:02.350 --> 05:01:02.360 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
05:01:05.470 --> 05:01:05.480 align:start position:0%
question um so if a school district says
 
05:01:06.868 --> 05:01:06.878 align:start position:0%
you know what we'll give you we're going
 
05:01:09.070 --> 05:01:09.080 align:start position:0%
to take a holiday this tells me I can
 
05:01:10.670 --> 05:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
take a holiday does that count as part
 
05:01:13.628 --> 05:01:13.638 align:start position:0%
of one the 180 days or do they have to
 
05:01:16.110 --> 05:01:16.120 align:start position:0%
find another day to make up for that day
 
05:01:19.150 --> 05:01:19.160 align:start position:0%
because challenges are set so right it's
 
05:01:22.430 --> 05:01:22.440 align:start position:0%
up to them and so if they want to count
 
05:01:25.230 --> 05:01:25.240 align:start position:0%
that as as you've described then that
 
05:01:27.708 --> 05:01:27.718 align:start position:0%
would also be up to them I think this
 
05:01:28.788 --> 05:01:28.798 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in this bill that
 
05:01:31.470 --> 05:01:31.480 align:start position:0%
requires that but I do know once again
 
05:01:33.310 --> 05:01:33.320 align:start position:0%
that the commissioner has asked for
 
05:01:35.350 --> 05:01:35.360 align:start position:0%
authority over that so perhaps that's
 
05:01:37.310 --> 05:01:37.320 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons he wanted to to have
 
05:01:39.190 --> 05:01:39.200 align:start position:0%
that Authority so the commissioner is
 
05:01:41.390 --> 05:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
saying 100 sorry followup so the
 
05:01:44.390 --> 05:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner is saying 179 days is fine
 
05:01:46.548 --> 05:01:46.558 align:start position:0%
if you do this I have
 
05:01:49.670 --> 05:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
not had that specific conversation with
 
05:01:52.708 --> 05:01:52.718 align:start position:0%
them okay thank you uh I just had one
 
05:01:55.270 --> 05:01:55.280 align:start position:0%
question um I have on occasion driven
 
05:01:57.708 --> 05:01:57.718 align:start position:0%
from Manchester to
 
05:02:00.270 --> 05:02:00.280 align:start position:0%
Conway um and it really didn't take me
 
05:02:02.190 --> 05:02:02.200 align:start position:0%
two days so I'm just wondering why the
 
05:02:05.510 --> 05:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
need for two days of excused absences no
 
05:02:08.110 --> 05:02:08.120 align:start position:0%
so it's a fair point but I I did just
 
05:02:10.548 --> 05:02:10.558 align:start position:0%
bring up the fact that actually in as
 
05:02:12.430 --> 05:02:12.440 align:start position:0%
far as this country goes Texas is the
 
05:02:13.990 --> 05:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
prime viewing location but there are
 
05:02:15.310 --> 05:02:15.320 align:start position:0%
many other states in the path of
 
05:02:17.788 --> 05:02:17.798 align:start position:0%
totality that may be better viewing so
 
05:02:19.948 --> 05:02:19.958 align:start position:0%
if the parents are planning on taking
 
05:02:21.548 --> 05:02:21.558 align:start position:0%
their students to go see a total solar
 
05:02:24.310 --> 05:02:24.320 align:start position:0%
eclipse in a better viewing location um
 
05:02:26.470 --> 05:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
that's one of the reasons however I will
 
05:02:28.830 --> 05:02:28.840 align:start position:0%
say even among and you will hear
 
05:02:31.150 --> 05:02:31.160 align:start position:0%
testimony to exactly what the conditions
 
05:02:33.708 --> 05:02:33.718 align:start position:0%
are for people who chase solar eclipse
 
05:02:36.350 --> 05:02:36.360 align:start position:0%
um no one is actually suggesting that
 
05:02:38.948 --> 05:02:38.958 align:start position:0%
someone try to drive up to Coos even
 
05:02:40.948 --> 05:02:40.958 align:start position:0%
from Southern New Hampshire and drive
 
05:02:43.390 --> 05:02:43.400 align:start position:0%
back down on the same day the traffic
 
05:02:45.948 --> 05:02:45.958 align:start position:0%
won't allow for
 
05:02:49.670 --> 05:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
it take prob commissioner might be
 
05:02:52.990 --> 05:02:53.000 align:start position:0%
buying suass not but not airplane
 
05:02:53.000 --> 05:02:55.150 align:start position:0%
buying suass not but not airplane
tickets

05:02:55.150 --> 05:02:55.160 align:start position:0%
tickets
 
05:02:59.030 --> 05:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
correct correct in fact many of the uh
 
05:03:00.990 --> 05:03:01.000 align:start position:0%
hotel rooms are in the path of totality
 
05:03:02.350 --> 05:03:02.360 align:start position:0%
across the entire country are already
 
05:03:04.708 --> 05:03:04.718 align:start position:0%
booked it will be very
 
05:03:06.628 --> 05:03:06.638 align:start position:0%
difficult uh additional questions
 
05:03:08.910 --> 05:03:08.920 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner thank you thank
 
05:03:11.510 --> 05:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question when you said
 
05:03:13.708 --> 05:03:13.718 align:start position:0%
that the commissioner thought uh felt
 
05:03:17.230 --> 05:03:17.240 align:start position:0%
very strongly about um he needed to
 
05:03:20.670 --> 05:03:20.680 align:start position:0%
authorize or adopt these rules uh the ru
 
05:03:22.510 --> 05:03:22.520 align:start position:0%
making provision in the bottom and you
 
05:03:24.510 --> 05:03:24.520 align:start position:0%
said you thought is it is it just for
 
05:03:27.948 --> 05:03:27.958 align:start position:0%
that one day or do you know specifically
 
05:03:31.190 --> 05:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
what he wants because it seems to me
 
05:03:32.990 --> 05:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
that the commissioner of Education has
 
05:03:33.000 --> 05:03:33.670 align:start position:0%
that the commissioner of Education has
the

05:03:33.670 --> 05:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:03:36.990 --> 05:03:37.000 align:start position:0%
ability um to do this without a change
 
05:03:40.270 --> 05:03:40.280 align:start position:0%
in the ru making um and one of the
 
05:03:42.548 --> 05:03:42.558 align:start position:0%
concerns was whether people could call
 
05:03:45.070 --> 05:03:45.080 align:start position:0%
off school because of covid of a lot of
 
05:03:48.548 --> 05:03:48.558 align:start position:0%
people being absent from covid and that
 
05:03:50.628 --> 05:03:50.638 align:start position:0%
that was a something that went back and
 
05:03:52.910 --> 05:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
forth but the commissioner felt he had
 
05:03:54.750 --> 05:03:54.760 align:start position:0%
um free reign over that and so I'm
 
05:03:57.030 --> 05:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
wondering if if you can explain a little
 
05:03:59.670 --> 05:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
bit more about the ru making sure I I
 
05:04:01.150 --> 05:04:01.160 align:start position:0%
actually thought it was under the
 
05:04:03.070 --> 05:04:03.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner's purview myself but he
 
05:04:05.628 --> 05:04:05.638 align:start position:0%
assured me it was not now I do not want
 
05:04:07.948 --> 05:04:07.958 align:start position:0%
to conflate this solar eclipse issue
 
05:04:09.868 --> 05:04:09.878 align:start position:0%
which should be completely nonpartisan
 
05:04:11.948 --> 05:04:11.958 align:start position:0%
with any other issue that may be
 
05:04:15.070 --> 05:04:15.080 align:start position:0%
partisan in nature or partisan appearing
 
05:04:17.310 --> 05:04:17.320 align:start position:0%
so I don't want to to weigh in on what
 
05:04:19.190 --> 05:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
the commissioner has done otherwise or
 
05:04:21.868 --> 05:04:21.878 align:start position:0%
or anything else I'm sure that everybody
 
05:04:23.350 --> 05:04:23.360 align:start position:0%
would would not be surprised that the
 
05:04:26.350 --> 05:04:26.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner and I have uh difference of
 
05:04:29.150 --> 05:04:29.160 align:start position:0%
views on a number of topics but where
 
05:04:31.190 --> 05:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
this is concerned because I care about
 
05:04:33.310 --> 05:04:33.320 align:start position:0%
astronomy and I care about science and I
 
05:04:35.030 --> 05:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
care about our students having access to
 
05:04:37.070 --> 05:04:37.080 align:start position:0%
it I want to make sure that that
 
05:04:40.230 --> 05:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
students have the maximum ability to um
 
05:04:44.708 --> 05:04:44.718 align:start position:0%
understand the value the rareness of the
 
05:04:46.590 --> 05:04:46.600 align:start position:0%
event of a total solar eclipse and
 
05:04:52.070 --> 05:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:56.070 --> 05:04:56.080 align:start position:0%
is as a followup at some point could uh
 
05:04:58.430 --> 05:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
um attorney Fenton come and just uh
 
05:05:00.230 --> 05:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
clarify some of that for
 
05:05:03.270 --> 05:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
me after this show
 
05:05:05.150 --> 05:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
oh but to the one piece of the question
 
05:05:07.510 --> 05:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
I didn't answer was that it is very
 
05:05:09.430 --> 05:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
limited to the the total solar eclipse
 
05:05:11.190 --> 05:05:11.200 align:start position:0%
and not any other in in the bill the
 
05:05:12.750 --> 05:05:12.760 align:start position:0%
rule making authori is only for the
 
05:05:16.788 --> 05:05:16.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:19.390 --> 05:05:19.400 align:start position:0%
day so thank thank you very much Mr
 
05:05:20.868 --> 05:05:20.878 align:start position:0%
chair thank you very much representative
 
05:05:23.510 --> 05:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
Reed um so I I too I'm concerned about
 
05:05:26.150 --> 05:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
the rule making element and so I'm I'm
 
05:05:29.788 --> 05:05:29.798 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering in your uh in your opinion
 
05:05:32.030 --> 05:05:32.040 align:start position:0%
would uh would section sections one and
 
05:05:33.948 --> 05:05:33.958 align:start position:0%
two I mean like section one sort of lays
 
05:05:36.910 --> 05:05:36.920 align:start position:0%
out the the context in section two be
 
05:05:38.230 --> 05:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
sufficient in
 
05:05:41.670 --> 05:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
statute to um to provide what you would
 
05:05:46.030 --> 05:05:46.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:49.948 --> 05:05:49.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:53.270 --> 05:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
second section two you said yeah section
 
05:05:56.150 --> 05:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
two is the compulsory attendance wave
 
05:05:59.030 --> 05:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
would that alone be enough well well all
 
05:06:00.110 --> 05:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
of section
 
05:06:03.310 --> 05:06:03.320 align:start position:0%
two it it would would would that be
 
05:06:06.430 --> 05:06:06.440 align:start position:0%
enough in statute to accomplish what you
 
05:06:10.868 --> 05:06:10.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:13.190 --> 05:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
making and the reason I lay it out is
 
05:06:15.390 --> 05:06:15.400 align:start position:0%
for example to representative Tanner's
 
05:06:18.788 --> 05:06:18.798 align:start position:0%
question um on lines lines 12 and 13
 
05:06:20.830 --> 05:06:20.840 align:start position:0%
viewing events immediately before during
 
05:06:23.548 --> 05:06:23.558 align:start position:0%
and after the moment so it so there is a
 
05:06:26.830 --> 05:06:26.840 align:start position:0%
uh yeah there I think the way I
 
05:06:30.548 --> 05:06:30.558 align:start position:0%
envisioned uh initially this bill being
 
05:06:33.110 --> 05:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
was essentially section two
 
05:06:35.190 --> 05:06:35.200 align:start position:0%
um section three is at the request of
 
05:06:37.670 --> 05:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
the commissioner and I figured that he
 
05:06:40.470 --> 05:06:40.480 align:start position:0%
may need as he said additional R making
 
05:06:42.990 --> 05:06:43.000 align:start position:0%
Authority but um if the committee sees
 
05:06:45.470 --> 05:06:45.480 align:start position:0%
fit to strike that then that I think
 
05:06:47.350 --> 05:06:47.360 align:start position:0%
that section two addresses my particular
 
05:06:49.670 --> 05:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
concerns okay great thank you very much
 
05:06:52.708 --> 05:06:52.718 align:start position:0%
any further questions see none thank you
 
05:06:54.990 --> 05:06:55.000 align:start position:0%
very much
 
05:06:59.110 --> 05:06:59.120 align:start position:0%
representative uh next we have uh Brian
 
05:07:07.270 --> 05:07:07.280 align:start position:0%

good afternoon and thank you for having

in in hill but I'm a former earth
 
05:07:39.150 --> 05:07:39.160 align:start position:0%
science teacher so I taught astronomy um
 
05:07:41.708 --> 05:07:41.718 align:start position:0%
and I too have a love of Science and I
 
05:07:43.708 --> 05:07:43.718 align:start position:0%
try to impart that on anybody and
 
05:07:47.470 --> 05:07:47.480 align:start position:0%
everyone who uh will listen and I did
 
05:07:49.670 --> 05:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
Chase an eclipse down to Nashville back
 
05:07:52.628 --> 05:07:52.638 align:start position:0%
in 2017 and I will tell you it is an
 
05:07:54.910 --> 05:07:54.920 align:start position:0%
extraordinary event it is one of those
 
05:07:57.270 --> 05:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
events that if you happen to be in that
 
05:07:59.830 --> 05:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
3 minutes of totality and you see the
 
05:08:01.548 --> 05:08:01.558 align:start position:0%
darkness fall upon you and the Stars
 
05:08:03.590 --> 05:08:03.600 align:start position:0%
illuminate and the the the Birds Go
 
05:08:06.830 --> 05:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
quiet it's extraordinary um so it's one
 
05:08:09.470 --> 05:08:09.480 align:start position:0%
of those moments I'm hoping that we can
 
05:08:12.510 --> 05:08:12.520 align:start position:0%
bring to every household in the state of
 
05:08:15.470 --> 05:08:15.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um not only here but
 
05:08:17.110 --> 05:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
really around the the world it would be
 
05:08:20.628 --> 05:08:20.638 align:start position:0%
my wish um currently I'm working with
 
05:08:23.910 --> 05:08:23.920 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire uh Aston Astronomical
 
05:08:28.670 --> 05:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
Society the um uh Shephard Mall Mcall
 
05:08:31.430 --> 05:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
Shepard Discovery Center the Fairbanks
 
05:08:34.390 --> 05:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
Museum New Hampshire Public Radio
 
05:08:36.628 --> 05:08:36.638 align:start position:0%
Vermont Public Radio U hopefully
 
05:08:39.070 --> 05:08:39.080 align:start position:0%
massachus or Maine public radio to
 
05:08:40.990 --> 05:08:41.000 align:start position:0%
coordinate efforts to make sure that we
 
05:08:43.990 --> 05:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
can get a live stream into every school
 
05:08:46.948 --> 05:08:46.958 align:start position:0%
in the state and if not into every home
 
05:08:51.390 --> 05:08:51.400 align:start position:0%
um to share this moment uh I I can't
 
05:08:51.400 --> 05:08:52.350 align:start position:0%
um to share this moment uh I I can't
tell

05:08:52.350 --> 05:08:52.360 align:start position:0%
tell
 
05:08:55.910 --> 05:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
you short of being in in witnessing one
 
05:08:58.390 --> 05:08:58.400 align:start position:0%
of these things how important it is to
 
05:09:01.270 --> 05:09:01.280 align:start position:0%
engage Our Youth and our our communities
 
05:09:03.830 --> 05:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
really around Science and Technology and
 
05:09:05.910 --> 05:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
Engineering and math this is a great
 
05:09:10.350 --> 05:09:10.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity for us to uh build on that
 
05:09:14.830 --> 05:09:14.840 align:start position:0%
um so I I do hope that we we could pass
 
05:09:17.190 --> 05:09:17.200 align:start position:0%
this and and and and get it done for for
 
05:09:19.070 --> 05:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
all of our kids we
 
05:09:22.150 --> 05:09:22.160 align:start position:0%
are working feverishly I'm working uh
 
05:09:24.190 --> 05:09:24.200 align:start position:0%
with the curriculum in instruction and
 
05:09:25.470 --> 05:09:25.480 align:start position:0%
assessment people throughout the state
 
05:09:27.910 --> 05:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire because I I believe in
 
05:09:30.750 --> 05:09:30.760 align:start position:0%
this and I I think it's very very
 
05:09:33.470 --> 05:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
important thank you for for being here
 
05:09:35.590 --> 05:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
any questions uh representative
 
05:09:38.310 --> 05:09:38.320 align:start position:0%
dry thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
05:09:41.350 --> 05:09:41.360 align:start position:0%
your um your input so I have a question
 
05:09:43.510 --> 05:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
is this is at the end of the school day
 
05:09:46.350 --> 05:09:46.360 align:start position:0%
yes and the idea is to make it a an
 
05:09:48.788 --> 05:09:48.798 align:start position:0%
educational experience yes so is that
 
05:09:51.590 --> 05:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
educational experience supposed to
 
05:09:55.110 --> 05:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
extend beyond the school hours so that's
 
05:09:57.708 --> 05:09:57.718 align:start position:0%
a great question and and really the the
 
05:10:00.230 --> 05:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
Crux of this the the comp the compulsory
 
05:10:03.150 --> 05:10:03.160 align:start position:0%
attendance piece is to provide
 
05:10:05.708 --> 05:10:05.718 align:start position:0%
like the North Country U like represent
 
05:10:07.190 --> 05:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
cascaden has mentioned the schools are
 
05:10:10.110 --> 05:10:10.120 align:start position:0%
already closed for in the North Country
 
05:10:12.628 --> 05:10:12.638 align:start position:0%
it gives the ability for uh
 
05:10:14.350 --> 05:10:14.360 align:start position:0%
superintendents uh throughout the state
 
05:10:15.948 --> 05:10:15.958 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire to determine what's
 
05:10:18.190 --> 05:10:18.200 align:start position:0%
best for their Community regardless of
 
05:10:20.310 --> 05:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
where you are in New Hampshire 95% of
 
05:10:23.750 --> 05:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
totality will will be here so 95% of the
 
05:10:26.190 --> 05:10:26.200 align:start position:0%
sun surface will be covered so
 
05:10:28.590 --> 05:10:28.600 align:start position:0%
regardless of the time it's important to
 
05:10:31.070 --> 05:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
train the kids or to teach the kids the
 
05:10:34.590 --> 05:10:34.600 align:start position:0%
the lessons to watch safely but what is
 
05:10:37.628 --> 05:10:37.638 align:start position:0%
happening so for schools that get out
 
05:10:38.910 --> 05:10:38.920 align:start position:0%
you know I know some schools get out at
 
05:10:41.868 --> 05:10:41.878 align:start position:0%
3:30 that kind of puts a jam on things
 
05:10:44.310 --> 05:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
we can now extend the day if we wish we
 
05:10:46.788 --> 05:10:46.798 align:start position:0%
can shorten the day if we wish we can
 
05:10:48.628 --> 05:10:48.638 align:start position:0%
cancel the day if we wish but it's
 
05:10:50.830 --> 05:10:50.840 align:start position:0%
really based around the science of of
 
05:10:52.590 --> 05:10:52.600 align:start position:0%
the eclipse not just oh let's just not
 
05:10:54.470 --> 05:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
have a day none of us want just not to
 
05:10:56.350 --> 05:10:56.360 align:start position:0%
have another day we all want to be there
 
05:10:57.708 --> 05:10:57.718 align:start position:0%
but we want to be able to have provide
 
05:11:00.310 --> 05:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for the local districts
 
05:11:02.470 --> 05:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
to make those decisions okay going
 
05:11:05.110 --> 05:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
follow up okay so I'm just trying to
 
05:11:06.830 --> 05:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
imagine there's probably not a case then
 
05:11:09.070 --> 05:11:09.080 align:start position:0%
for like a hybrid that those who want to
 
05:11:11.190 --> 05:11:11.200 align:start position:0%
stay home and and observe it at home
 
05:11:13.150 --> 05:11:13.160 align:start position:0%
could but the school would still have to
 
05:11:15.788 --> 05:11:15.798 align:start position:0%
run its bus schedule and Etc if they
 
05:11:19.830 --> 05:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
were open is that correct yes okay I
 
05:11:23.270 --> 05:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
yeah I I don't know getting into the the
 
05:11:25.750 --> 05:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
and let me clarify your your question if
 
05:11:28.628 --> 05:11:28.638 align:start position:0%
I may when you say hybrid meaning like a
 
05:11:31.470 --> 05:11:31.480 align:start position:0%
remote option I think more I was
 
05:11:33.350 --> 05:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
thinking more if it was remained a
 
05:11:35.708 --> 05:11:35.718 align:start position:0%
school day but you were able to opt out
 
05:11:38.270 --> 05:11:38.280 align:start position:0%
and not coming that day it would school
 
05:11:39.948 --> 05:11:39.958 align:start position:0%
would still have to operate the same way
 
05:11:42.070 --> 05:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
and that would still involve the problem
 
05:11:44.190 --> 05:11:44.200 align:start position:0%
of buses and leaving at the same time
 
05:11:46.868 --> 05:11:46.878 align:start position:0%
okay thank you f questions
 
05:11:49.030 --> 05:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
representative Hall thank you Mr chair
 
05:11:50.230 --> 05:11:50.240 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question so
 
05:11:53.110 --> 05:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
what happens if it's a cloudy day just
 
05:11:56.270 --> 05:11:56.280 align:start position:0%
curious it's a sad day is what that
 
05:12:00.548 --> 05:12:00.558 align:start position:0%
is yeah no I I I I totally understand um
 
05:12:03.310 --> 05:12:03.320 align:start position:0%
and I suppose you could put in place for
 
05:12:05.190 --> 05:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
that like I know I could because we're
 
05:12:06.948 --> 05:12:06.958 align:start position:0%
so small I could say you know what if
 
05:12:08.990 --> 05:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
it's cloudy we're still we're in school
 
05:12:11.990 --> 05:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
if we're not we're out of school um but
 
05:12:14.070 --> 05:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a fair question I I I
 
05:12:17.270 --> 05:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
don't know how to circumvent that but
 
05:12:20.470 --> 05:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
followup oh so what do you see nothing
 
05:12:22.270 --> 05:12:22.280 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious excuse me if it's a
 
05:12:25.628 --> 05:12:25.638 align:start position:0%
cloudy day do you doesn't so as I uh
 
05:12:27.150 --> 05:12:27.160 align:start position:0%
well you you wouldn't if if you're in
 
05:12:29.310 --> 05:12:29.320 align:start position:0%
the path of totality it would go dark uh
 
05:12:31.270 --> 05:12:31.280 align:start position:0%
if you're not then it would just be a
 
05:12:31.280 --> 05:12:32.350 align:start position:0%
if you're not then it would just be a
funky

05:12:32.350 --> 05:12:32.360 align:start position:0%
funky
 
05:12:34.030 --> 05:12:34.040 align:start position:0%
I don't know I've never been a shady one
 
05:12:36.910 --> 05:12:36.920 align:start position:0%
yeah funky shade of gray okay all right
 
05:12:36.920 --> 05:12:37.750 align:start position:0%
yeah funky shade of gray okay all right
thank

05:12:37.750 --> 05:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:12:37.760 --> 05:12:40.510 align:start position:0%
thank
you

05:12:40.510 --> 05:12:40.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:13:00.750 --> 05:13:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:00.760 --> 05:13:10.788 align:start position:0%

05:13:13.270 --> 05:13:13.280 align:start position:0%
okay I'm sure uh someone might want to
 
05:13:15.868 --> 05:13:15.878 align:start position:0%
look at it afterwards am I allowed to
 
05:13:21.470 --> 05:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:23.868 --> 05:13:23.878 align:start position:0%
out um you can just leave them at the
 
05:13:26.548 --> 05:13:26.558 align:start position:0%
end and they'll pass them
 
05:13:30.750 --> 05:13:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:30.760 --> 05:13:42.590 align:start position:0%

05:13:42.590 --> 05:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:45.150 --> 05:13:45.160 align:start position:0%
so thank you chairman uh Representatives
 
05:13:48.150 --> 05:13:48.160 align:start position:0%
representative Reed for uh helping push
 
05:13:50.830 --> 05:13:50.840 align:start position:0%
this through uh my name is Rick Ys I'm
 
05:13:52.868 --> 05:13:52.878 align:start position:0%
the founder of the New Hampshire solar
 
05:13:55.270 --> 05:13:55.280 align:start position:0%
eclipse task force I'm an asset partner
 
05:13:59.110 --> 05:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
solar eclipse Ambassador I am a starnet
 
05:14:03.470 --> 05:14:03.480 align:start position:0%
seal uh partner solar expert and I'm the
 
05:14:05.510 --> 05:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
founder and chief pilot of the eclipse
 
05:14:08.470 --> 05:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
mobile here in New Hampshire
 
05:14:11.390 --> 05:14:11.400 align:start position:0%
so good afternoon in the words of my
 
05:14:14.230 --> 05:14:14.240 align:start position:0%
colleague Dr Kate Russo a solar eclipse
 
05:14:16.788 --> 05:14:16.798 align:start position:0%
h a solar eclipse happens above you
 
05:14:19.708 --> 05:14:19.718 align:start position:0%
around you and within you I suggest
 
05:14:22.510 --> 05:14:22.520 align:start position:0%
adding just one word a solar eclipse
 
05:14:26.910 --> 05:14:26.920 align:start position:0%
happens with awe above you a around you
 
05:14:28.830 --> 05:14:28.840 align:start position:0%
and awe within
 
05:14:32.110 --> 05:14:32.120 align:start position:0%
you above you day turns into night
 
05:14:34.150 --> 05:14:34.160 align:start position:0%
bright stars and planets appear in the
 
05:14:36.910 --> 05:14:36.920 align:start position:0%
midday sky and the moon can best be
 
05:14:39.830 --> 05:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
described as a giant hole in the sky or
 
05:14:42.990 --> 05:14:43.000 align:start position:0%
the eye of God long ago this event
 
05:14:45.788 --> 05:14:45.798 align:start position:0%
created mostly fear but my modern
 
05:14:47.910 --> 05:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
experience of three solar eclipses is
 
05:14:50.948 --> 05:14:50.958 align:start position:0%
mostly awe I also find it fascinating
 
05:14:53.310 --> 05:14:53.320 align:start position:0%
that a simple Shadow albeit the biggest
 
05:14:54.670 --> 05:14:54.680 align:start position:0%
one I'll ever
 
05:14:58.670 --> 05:14:58.680 align:start position:0%
see can create so much awe around you
 
05:15:01.030 --> 05:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
awe appears as You observe the animals
 
05:15:03.910 --> 05:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
people and Landscape in the distance
 
05:15:06.030 --> 05:15:06.040 align:start position:0%
animals often go quiet with the sudden
 
05:15:08.110 --> 05:15:08.120 align:start position:0%
arrival of night the temperature
 
05:15:10.510 --> 05:15:10.520 align:start position:0%
noticeably drops and the most common
 
05:15:13.750 --> 05:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
reaction among people is oh my gosh this
 
05:15:16.390 --> 05:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
sentiment is usually repeated over and
 
05:15:20.910 --> 05:15:20.920 align:start position:0%
over and over and over and over again I
 
05:15:22.708 --> 05:15:22.718 align:start position:0%
have also observed people get very
 
05:15:25.230 --> 05:15:25.240 align:start position:0%
emotional to the point of tears at the
 
05:15:27.590 --> 05:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
sight of a solar eclipse even
 
05:15:29.548 --> 05:15:29.558 align:start position:0%
professional astronomers are not immune
 
05:15:32.350 --> 05:15:32.360 align:start position:0%
to the awe it's strongly recommended
 
05:15:34.910 --> 05:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
that professionals not take pictures or
 
05:15:37.350 --> 05:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
conduct any experiments when viewing a
 
05:15:40.590 --> 05:15:40.600 align:start position:0%
total solar eclipse for the first time
 
05:15:42.670 --> 05:15:42.680 align:start position:0%
since they are often overwhelmed and
 
05:15:45.990 --> 05:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
forget to take a picture or collect data
 
05:15:48.390 --> 05:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
awe is present in the distant landscape
 
05:15:50.110 --> 05:15:50.120 align:start position:0%
because while it is night above and
 
05:15:52.350 --> 05:15:52.360 align:start position:0%
around you it is still daylight in the
 
05:15:55.150 --> 05:15:55.160 align:start position:0%
distance not under the shadow finally
 
05:15:57.750 --> 05:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
for myself much of my awe has occurred
 
05:16:00.230 --> 05:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
within I will probably never make it to
 
05:16:03.070 --> 05:16:03.080 align:start position:0%
the moon or into orbital space at least
 
05:16:06.190 --> 05:16:06.200 align:start position:0%
in this life however I imagine my solar
 
05:16:08.548 --> 05:16:08.558 align:start position:0%
eclipse viewing has created similar
 
05:16:11.470 --> 05:16:11.480 align:start position:0%
feelings and transformations in myself
 
05:16:13.390 --> 05:16:13.400 align:start position:0%
that those few lucky astronauts
 
05:16:16.190 --> 05:16:16.200 align:start position:0%
experience when they travel off planet
 
05:16:18.590 --> 05:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
for myself I can only describe the awe
 
05:16:21.150 --> 05:16:21.160 align:start position:0%
as being Fully Alive and connected to
 
05:16:24.230 --> 05:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
the universe as an added bonus I get to
 
05:16:26.990 --> 05:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
share my inner awe with everyone I meet
 
05:16:30.030 --> 05:16:30.040 align:start position:0%
and invite them to join me in the shadow
 
05:16:32.708 --> 05:16:32.718 align:start position:0%
having awe within is is quite nice
 
05:16:36.390 --> 05:16:36.400 align:start position:0%
sharing that Ina with others is
 
05:16:39.270 --> 05:16:39.280 align:start position:0%
priceless so I have been working on this
 
05:16:42.390 --> 05:16:42.400 align:start position:0%
event for the past nine years after I
 
05:16:46.510 --> 05:16:46.520 align:start position:0%
saw the one uh in August of 2021 in
 
05:16:49.230 --> 05:16:49.240 align:start position:0%
Casper Wyoming and realized that this
 
05:16:51.350 --> 05:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
one I didn't have to chase this one was
 
05:16:54.628 --> 05:16:54.638 align:start position:0%
coming to us so I hooked up with Senator
 
05:16:58.230 --> 05:16:58.240 align:start position:0%
Woodburn Senator star Senator Hennessy
 
05:17:00.390 --> 05:17:00.400 align:start position:0%
representative Reed the
 
05:17:03.070 --> 05:17:03.080 align:start position:0%
nhas whoever I could and because of
 
05:17:05.830 --> 05:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
covid the bill that Governor cunu signed
 
05:17:08.868 --> 05:17:08.878 align:start position:0%
into law in August of 2021 was actually
 
05:17:11.910 --> 05:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
late we still don't have a a solar
 
05:17:14.750 --> 05:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
eclipse scratch ticket we there's a lot
 
05:17:18.190 --> 05:17:18.200 align:start position:0%
of things we don't have however we do
 
05:17:21.430 --> 05:17:21.440 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity with this bill to
 
05:17:24.750 --> 05:17:24.760 align:start position:0%
get the youngest in our state excited
 
05:17:26.910 --> 05:17:26.920 align:start position:0%
about for them it's going to be a twice
 
05:17:29.910 --> 05:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
in a-lifetime event cuz for all the 10
 
05:17:34.310 --> 05:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
15 year old students in school they get
 
05:17:36.788 --> 05:17:36.798 align:start position:0%
to see this with these glasses I passed
 
05:17:39.590 --> 05:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
out they get to travel and throughout
 
05:17:42.868 --> 05:17:42.878 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire it's 95% in Salem 96 in
 
05:17:47.788 --> 05:17:47.798 align:start position:0%
Manchester 97 in lonia 98 in Plymouth 99
 
05:17:50.830 --> 05:17:50.840 align:start position:0%
brenon Woods Bartlett heart's location
 
05:17:53.150 --> 05:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
and the jackpot above Lancaster and
 
05:17:56.708 --> 05:17:56.718 align:start position:0%
milin is 100% I will be in Pittsburgh
 
05:18:00.708 --> 05:18:00.718 align:start position:0%
with a team of 30 to 60 Folks up there
 
05:18:03.110 --> 05:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh buch of things I want to address it
 
05:18:05.110 --> 05:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
is a 3 minute totality event but the
 
05:18:09.030 --> 05:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
whole event is 3 hours the moon starts
 
05:18:11.350 --> 05:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
covering the Sun at 2: in the afternoon
 
05:18:14.230 --> 05:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
with your glasses you can see it so from
 
05:18:17.030 --> 05:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
2:00 to 3:30 more and more of the sun
 
05:18:19.708 --> 05:18:19.718 align:start position:0%
gets covered and then at 3:30 you have
 
05:18:21.708 --> 05:18:21.718 align:start position:0%
totality then it's another hour and 20
 
05:18:23.990 --> 05:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
minute Sunrise as the moon moves off the
 
05:18:27.948 --> 05:18:27.958 align:start position:0%
Sun so while the main event is 3 minutes
 
05:18:31.310 --> 05:18:31.320 align:start position:0%
the whole event is 3 hours uh weather
 
05:18:33.390 --> 05:18:33.400 align:start position:0%
concerns we are working with the BVI
 
05:18:35.390 --> 05:18:35.400 align:start position:0%
community the blind visually impaired
 
05:18:37.910 --> 05:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
Community Randy Pierce at future in
 
05:18:40.628 --> 05:18:40.638 align:start position:0%
sight because if we lose the weather
 
05:18:43.430 --> 05:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
lotto and it is cloudy or rainy or a
 
05:18:45.910 --> 05:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
snowstorm how cool would it be to turn
 
05:18:48.350 --> 05:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
over the mcing of this sight of a
 
05:18:51.070 --> 05:18:51.080 align:start position:0%
lifetime for most of us into an event of
 
05:18:53.868 --> 05:18:53.878 align:start position:0%
a lifetime for all of us and here the
 
05:18:57.470 --> 05:18:57.480 align:start position:0%
BVI community gets to lead us in event
 
05:19:00.670 --> 05:19:00.680 align:start position:0%
that they rarely if they'll ever see and
 
05:19:03.628 --> 05:19:03.638 align:start position:0%
we get to all experience it nonvisually
 
05:19:06.070 --> 05:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
NASA has sonification devices that
 
05:19:08.670 --> 05:19:08.680 align:start position:0%
transfer light into sound they have
 
05:19:11.590 --> 05:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
tactile devices they have music Dr
 
05:19:14.030 --> 05:19:14.040 align:start position:0%
Robert Kramer I think he's written a
 
05:19:16.430 --> 05:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
couple of songs that we have we have
 
05:19:18.750 --> 05:19:18.760 align:start position:0%
Rumble apps we have a huge variety so
 
05:19:21.190 --> 05:19:21.200 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping for Clear Skies but if we
 
05:19:23.708 --> 05:19:23.718 align:start position:0%
don't get clear skies we'll experience
 
05:19:23.718 --> 05:19:24.590 align:start position:0%
don't get clear skies we'll experience
it

05:19:24.590 --> 05:19:24.600 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:19:27.230 --> 05:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
nonvisually um we got the bill through
 
05:19:30.390 --> 05:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
what else uh working with uh the kids
 
05:19:32.830 --> 05:19:32.840 align:start position:0%
it's huge because we have a solar
 
05:19:35.548 --> 05:19:35.558 align:start position:0%
eclipse Time Capsule the solar eclipse
 
05:19:37.310 --> 05:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
Time Capsule goes into the ground
 
05:19:38.868 --> 05:19:38.878 align:start position:0%
hopefully at the McCulla Shepard
 
05:19:40.628 --> 05:19:40.638 align:start position:0%
Discovery Center if not it'll be at my
 
05:19:42.910 --> 05:19:42.920 align:start position:0%
Domino's pizza shop here in conquer so
 
05:19:45.110 --> 05:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
we have a backup location for that too
 
05:19:47.350 --> 05:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
goes into the ground on May 1st
 
05:19:51.548 --> 05:19:51.558 align:start position:0%
20124 55 years later the date of the
 
05:19:54.708 --> 05:19:54.718 align:start position:0%
next total solar eclipse in 2079 is the
 
05:19:56.708 --> 05:19:56.718 align:start position:0%
DAT it comes out of the ground I'm not
 
05:20:01.190 --> 05:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
going to make 119 but the kids will and
 
05:20:03.628 --> 05:20:03.638 align:start position:0%
what's even better is they can't have
 
05:20:05.868 --> 05:20:05.878 align:start position:0%
any Mount gay Eclipse rum when it goes
 
05:20:08.110 --> 05:20:08.120 align:start position:0%
into the Time Capsule however when it
 
05:20:10.590 --> 05:20:10.600 align:start position:0%
comes out 55 years later if they led a
 
05:20:12.868 --> 05:20:12.878 align:start position:0%
reasonable life they're first in line to
 
05:20:14.830 --> 05:20:14.840 align:start position:0%
have a shot or at that age maybe half a
 
05:20:18.430 --> 05:20:18.440 align:start position:0%
shot of M Eclipse run so I could talk
 
05:20:20.150 --> 05:20:20.160 align:start position:0%
about eclipses for months but I think
 
05:20:22.708 --> 05:20:22.718 align:start position:0%
I've used up most of my five minutes so
 
05:20:24.788 --> 05:20:24.798 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions thank
 
05:20:27.310 --> 05:20:27.320 align:start position:0%
you very much any uh
 
05:20:30.628 --> 05:20:30.638 align:start position:0%
questions uh represent of Woodcock yeah
 
05:20:33.628 --> 05:20:33.638 align:start position:0%
you put me on all listening here um two
 
05:20:37.948 --> 05:20:37.958 align:start position:0%
questions does the uh these particular
 
05:20:40.910 --> 05:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
types of lenses that that I think talked
 
05:20:42.910 --> 05:20:42.920 align:start position:0%
about uh they going to be distributed
 
05:20:44.910 --> 05:20:44.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps by the commissioner to all
 
05:20:47.110 --> 05:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
youngsters in the school system are
 
05:20:49.708 --> 05:20:49.718 align:start position:0%
there any other uh optical devices that
 
05:20:51.230 --> 05:20:51.240 align:start position:0%
the average person going to be able to
 
05:20:53.948 --> 05:20:53.958 align:start position:0%
access uh during that time it you'd have
 
05:20:55.868 --> 05:20:55.878 align:start position:0%
to Define average because you can use
 
05:20:57.750 --> 05:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
well some like you walk on the street
 
05:21:00.510 --> 05:21:00.520 align:start position:0%
and I know it's coming tomorrow no no
 
05:21:05.230 --> 05:21:05.240 align:start position:0%
the store no well what happened in 2017
 
05:21:07.868 --> 05:21:07.878 align:start position:0%
that was really bad I like to compare it
 
05:21:10.110 --> 05:21:10.120 align:start position:0%
to solar eclipse glasses are like the
 
05:21:12.750 --> 05:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
opposite of a covid vaccine when the
 
05:21:15.510 --> 05:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
vaccines first came out it was difficult
 
05:21:18.708 --> 05:21:18.718 align:start position:0%
to get them um everybody wanted them or
 
05:21:20.390 --> 05:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
a lot of people wanted them not
 
05:21:22.670 --> 05:21:22.680 align:start position:0%
everybody and if you could find them you
 
05:21:24.190 --> 05:21:24.200 align:start position:0%
might have to travel or spend a lot of
 
05:21:26.310 --> 05:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
money to get them okay these glasses are
 
05:21:28.948 --> 05:21:28.958 align:start position:0%
the reverse uh a year ago they were
 
05:21:30.628 --> 05:21:30.638 align:start position:0%
everywhere they were super cheap nobody
 
05:21:33.830 --> 05:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
wanted as it gets closer and closer the
 
05:21:36.270 --> 05:21:36.280 align:start position:0%
availability goes down cuz you can't
 
05:21:40.310 --> 05:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
print off 500 to 800 million of these
 
05:21:42.430 --> 05:21:42.440 align:start position:0%
because we need them across the US they
 
05:21:44.190 --> 05:21:44.200 align:start position:0%
need them across Canada and they need
 
05:21:46.390 --> 05:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
them across Mexico that's a lot of pairs
 
05:21:47.948 --> 05:21:47.958 align:start position:0%
of glasses and there aren't that many
 
05:21:51.230 --> 05:21:51.240 align:start position:0%
companies that do it back in 2017 people
 
05:21:52.750 --> 05:21:52.760 align:start position:0%
that couldn't find them or didn't want
 
05:21:55.190 --> 05:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
to pay the high price they started going
 
05:21:58.590 --> 05:21:58.600 align:start position:0%
to Amazon eBay the internet some of
 
05:22:01.868 --> 05:22:01.878 align:start position:0%
those classes came from China okay know
 
05:22:04.830 --> 05:22:04.840 align:start position:0%
I got it figured it out thank you get
 
05:22:06.548 --> 05:22:06.558 align:start position:0%
your hand thank you anything further
 
05:22:08.430 --> 05:22:08.440 align:start position:0%
just one more follow thank you have you
 
05:22:10.350 --> 05:22:10.360 align:start position:0%
had a chance to talk with the any of the
 
05:22:12.230 --> 05:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
professional associations I know we had
 
05:22:13.430 --> 05:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
representative from the superintendent
 
05:22:17.830 --> 05:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
but the the uh aft the Nea the the uh
 
05:22:20.190 --> 05:22:20.200 align:start position:0%
the school secondary Association in
 
05:22:23.190 --> 05:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
terms of how this may actually work or
 
05:22:25.230 --> 05:22:25.240 align:start position:0%
could work I'm I'm thinking about Union
 
05:22:27.350 --> 05:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
contract I'm thinking about paid days
 
05:22:28.788 --> 05:22:28.798 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking about half days I'm
 
05:22:31.310 --> 05:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
thinking about average daily tenants re
 
05:22:32.948 --> 05:22:32.958 align:start position:0%
federal government has any of that stuff
 
05:22:34.270 --> 05:22:34.280 align:start position:0%
through the commissioner been thought
 
05:22:36.190 --> 05:22:36.200 align:start position:0%
through you know I'd have to refer you
 
05:22:38.990 --> 05:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
to Ellen um way above my pay grade I
 
05:22:41.990 --> 05:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
work with NASA and theas the American
 
05:22:44.070 --> 05:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
Astronomical Society and hopefully the
 
05:22:46.590 --> 05:22:46.600 align:start position:0%
international astronomy Union everything
 
05:22:48.390 --> 05:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
I'm doing I want to take globally after
 
05:22:50.230 --> 05:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
2024 because it's going to be a while
 
05:22:51.750 --> 05:22:51.760 align:start position:0%

eclipse task force and I love eclipses I
 
05:24:22.750 --> 05:24:22.760 align:start position:0%
love education I love the passion that
 
05:24:25.948 --> 05:24:25.958 align:start position:0%
uh science can get kids excited about
 
05:24:28.628 --> 05:24:28.638 align:start position:0%
things that other things can't who wants
 
05:24:31.628 --> 05:24:31.638 align:start position:0%
to read Walden P I'm kidding I went to
 
05:24:33.830 --> 05:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
Walden par it's a great place I've taken
 
05:24:36.430 --> 05:24:36.440 align:start position:0%
field trips there with kids but what an
 
05:24:39.150 --> 05:24:39.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity because as already said the
 
05:24:42.548 --> 05:24:42.558 align:start position:0%
next opportunity 55 years down the road
 
05:24:45.548 --> 05:24:45.558 align:start position:0%
for here in New Hampshire I traveled
 
05:24:49.230 --> 05:24:49.240 align:start position:0%
myself 20 hours to uh Hopkinsville
 
05:24:53.350 --> 05:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
Kentucky in 2017 August 21st for 2
 
05:24:55.948 --> 05:24:55.958 align:start position:0%
minutes and 45 seconds of
 
05:24:55.958 --> 05:24:57.590 align:start position:0%
minutes and 45 seconds of
totality

05:24:57.590 --> 05:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
totality
 
05:24:59.470 --> 05:24:59.480 align:start position:0%
lifechanging you know what else was
 
05:25:01.350 --> 05:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
lifechanging it's it's time to leave
 
05:25:03.270 --> 05:25:03.280 align:start position:0%
it's time to head back to New Hampshire
 
05:25:06.150 --> 05:25:06.160 align:start position:0%
I drive 5 miles west to an interstate
 
05:25:08.948 --> 05:25:08.958 align:start position:0%
four lanes going north four Interstate
 
05:25:12.830 --> 05:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
Lanes all going north nobody's moving I
 
05:25:14.948 --> 05:25:14.958 align:start position:0%
did a UI don't tell anybody I did a UI
 
05:25:17.548 --> 05:25:17.558 align:start position:0%
on the ramp I'm not getting in that M
 
05:25:21.910 --> 05:25:21.920 align:start position:0%
and I drove 25 miles east to another
 
05:25:26.510 --> 05:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
Interstate four lanes going north and
 
05:25:28.750 --> 05:25:28.760 align:start position:0%
nobody's moving we went to a general
 
05:25:30.470 --> 05:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
store and got a map and went home run
 
05:25:33.110 --> 05:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
back roads and we got there probably
 
05:25:35.470 --> 05:25:35.480 align:start position:0%
before the other people did it's an
 
05:25:38.190 --> 05:25:38.200 align:start position:0%
amazing thing and so as I already
 
05:25:39.788 --> 05:25:39.798 align:start position:0%
pointed out you can't travel to the
 
05:25:41.948 --> 05:25:41.958 align:start position:0%
eclipse on Monday the 8th because the
 
05:25:46.350 --> 05:25:46.360 align:start position:0%
traffic is going to be so bottled up and
 
05:25:49.070 --> 05:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
as I shared we got four lanes here four
 
05:25:51.510 --> 05:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
lanes here but don't worry we have route
 
05:25:54.190 --> 05:25:54.200 align:start position:0%
three right we have Route
 
05:25:57.948 --> 05:25:57.958 align:start position:0%
16 nobody's going anywhere on the eth so
 
05:26:00.070 --> 05:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
that's why we encourage a day to like
 
05:26:02.070 --> 05:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
they can go up on the Saturday go up on
 
05:26:05.708 --> 05:26:05.718 align:start position:0%
the Sunday uh I'm going up Friday night
 
05:26:07.830 --> 05:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
uh and then a travel day to get back on
 
05:26:10.590 --> 05:26:10.600 align:start position:0%
Tuesday so the question a question that
 
05:26:12.510 --> 05:26:12.520 align:start position:0%
I heard is well parents can just write a
 
05:26:15.628 --> 05:26:15.638 align:start position:0%
note and excuse them but listen people
 
05:26:17.150 --> 05:26:17.160 align:start position:0%
you know what you have the opportunity
 
05:26:20.190 --> 05:26:20.200 align:start position:0%
to do you people have the opportunity to
 
05:26:22.310 --> 05:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
highlight boldface
 
05:26:24.430 --> 05:26:24.440 align:start position:0%
italics Big
 
05:26:28.150 --> 05:26:28.160 align:start position:0%
Font the importance of this because yeah
 
05:26:30.788 --> 05:26:30.798 align:start position:0%
they can parents can write an excuse any
 
05:26:32.628 --> 05:26:32.638 align:start position:0%
day to get out any day in Belmont they
 
05:26:34.430 --> 05:26:34.440 align:start position:0%
can excuse three days and after that
 
05:26:35.350 --> 05:26:35.360 align:start position:0%
they get in
 
05:26:40.350 --> 05:26:40.360 align:start position:0%
trouble but if it's a bill it's like
 
05:26:43.948 --> 05:26:43.958 align:start position:0%
this is like legit like this is a big
 
05:26:46.590 --> 05:26:46.600 align:start position:0%
deal and you people have the opportunity
 
05:26:48.788 --> 05:26:48.798 align:start position:0%
to encourage students and to encourage
 
05:26:51.190 --> 05:26:51.200 align:start position:0%
families to go up to doesn't have to be
 
05:26:52.310 --> 05:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
into New Hampshire they can go to
 
05:26:54.788 --> 05:26:54.798 align:start position:0%
Buffalo New York Cincinnati Ohio up in
 
05:26:57.030 --> 05:26:57.040 align:start position:0%
Maine go up to
 
05:26:59.628 --> 05:26:59.638 align:start position:0%
Montreal but wherever they go for
 
05:27:03.910 --> 05:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
totality that they get credit for the
 
05:27:07.270 --> 05:27:07.280 align:start position:0%
day and with uh you know recommended a
 
05:27:09.628 --> 05:27:09.638 align:start position:0%
day for travel on the
 
05:27:14.310 --> 05:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
Tuesday and I I just encourage you to uh
 
05:27:14.320 --> 05:27:15.548 align:start position:0%
Tuesday and I I just encourage you to uh
to

05:27:15.548 --> 05:27:15.558 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:27:19.788 --> 05:27:19.798 align:start position:0%
endorse pass this bill for the
 
05:27:23.670 --> 05:27:23.680 align:start position:0%
children it's a big deal and you people
 
05:27:26.030 --> 05:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to heighten the
 
05:27:28.310 --> 05:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
importance of this big deal though yeah
 
05:27:30.990 --> 05:27:31.000 align:start position:0%
maybe the results could be handled
 
05:27:32.708 --> 05:27:32.718 align:start position:0%
without a bill
 
05:27:35.350 --> 05:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
maybe but this just underscores the
 
05:27:37.548 --> 05:27:37.558 align:start position:0%
importance of a once in a-lifetime
 
05:27:39.190 --> 05:27:39.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity for many of the kids some
 
05:27:41.868 --> 05:27:41.878 align:start position:0%
kids may get the chance to do it twice
 
05:27:45.070 --> 05:27:45.080 align:start position:0%
but for New Hampshire 55 years is the
 
05:27:48.948 --> 05:27:48.958 align:start position:0%
next one and so Christa the field trip
 
05:27:52.470 --> 05:27:52.480 align:start position:0%
teacher let's encourage this field trip
 
05:27:54.868 --> 05:27:54.878 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate the time that you've
 
05:27:57.390 --> 05:27:57.400 align:start position:0%

being here and your present my pleasure
 
05:28:12.990 --> 05:28:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:17.868 --> 05:28:17.878 align:start position:0%
that okay is attorney Fenton still
 
05:28:20.830 --> 05:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
here would you um have any information
 
05:28:23.390 --> 05:28:23.400 align:start position:0%
for us on the rul making uh provision in
 
05:28:23.400 --> 05:28:29.390 align:start position:0%
for us on the rul making uh provision in
this

05:28:29.390 --> 05:28:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:29.400 --> 05:28:32.270 align:start position:0%
 
legislation

05:28:32.270 --> 05:28:32.280 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
05:28:38.910 --> 05:28:38.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:40.990 --> 05:28:41.000 align:start position:0%
afternoon for the record my name is
 
05:28:42.788 --> 05:28:42.798 align:start position:0%
Diana Fenton I'm an attorney with the
 
05:28:44.270 --> 05:28:44.280 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and I'm very
 
05:28:46.548 --> 05:28:46.558 align:start position:0%
thankful for the previous speakers
 
05:28:49.830 --> 05:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
because um I know nothing about solar
 
05:28:52.310 --> 05:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
eclipses and I'm back there taking notes
 
05:28:53.990 --> 05:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
and you guys got me all jazzed up and
 
05:28:55.230 --> 05:28:55.240 align:start position:0%
now I'm going to take my kids out of
 
05:28:58.990 --> 05:28:59.000 align:start position:0%
school to go see it so uh I I appre
 
05:29:00.868 --> 05:29:00.878 align:start position:0%
thank thank you um and want those
 
05:29:03.868 --> 05:29:03.878 align:start position:0%
glasses on a t-shirt but that's probably
 
05:29:07.310 --> 05:29:07.320 align:start position:0%
overstepping just a bit um but as you
 
05:29:09.670 --> 05:29:09.680 align:start position:0%
know we do not support or oppose bills
 
05:29:11.708 --> 05:29:11.718 align:start position:0%
but I am here to answer technical
 
05:29:13.110 --> 05:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
questions and I think there are some
 
05:29:16.150 --> 05:29:16.160 align:start position:0%
questions about the rul making um so
 
05:29:18.190 --> 05:29:18.200 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner if you'd like to
 
05:29:20.150 --> 05:29:20.160 align:start position:0%
ask me the direct question so I am not
 
05:29:23.350 --> 05:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
presumptuous which get me in trouble so
 
05:29:26.910 --> 05:29:26.920 align:start position:0%
my first question is um does this apply
 
05:29:30.990 --> 05:29:31.000 align:start position:0%
this authorization to adopt rules
 
05:29:36.110 --> 05:29:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:39.750 --> 05:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
eclipse so thank you for the
 
05:29:42.510 --> 05:29:42.520 align:start position:0%
question it it it does the short answer
 
05:29:45.670 --> 05:29:45.680 align:start position:0%
is it does I think to further um address
 
05:29:48.590 --> 05:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
your concern I would refer you to other
 
05:29:50.948 --> 05:29:50.958 align:start position:0%
Provisions in the law that really
 
05:29:53.510 --> 05:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
enumerate what this legislative body
 
05:29:56.070 --> 05:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
wants the department to do for ruem I
 
05:29:58.510 --> 05:29:58.520 align:start position:0%
think seeing this language here this
 
05:30:01.070 --> 05:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
looks broad to me I will refer you to
 
05:30:04.350 --> 05:30:04.360 align:start position:0%
RSA 126 u8 just as an example there are
 
05:30:06.310 --> 05:30:06.320 align:start position:0%
other provisions of the law but if you
 
05:30:08.470 --> 05:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
look at restraint and seclusion for
 
05:30:11.510 --> 05:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
example again 126 u8 it says the State
 
05:30:14.350 --> 05:30:14.360 align:start position:0%
Board of educ Education shall adopt
 
05:30:17.350 --> 05:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
rules pursuant to Ru making Authority
 
05:30:19.270 --> 05:30:19.280 align:start position:0%
relative to and then it
 
05:30:22.990 --> 05:30:23.000 align:start position:0%
enumerates a b c you know it enumerates
 
05:30:24.548 --> 05:30:24.558 align:start position:0%
exactly what it wants the department to
 
05:30:25.788 --> 05:30:25.798 align:start position:0%
do rule making
 
05:30:29.788 --> 05:30:29.798 align:start position:0%
for more guidance is always helpful as
 
05:30:31.350 --> 05:30:31.360 align:start position:0%
someone who who's engaged in rule making
 
05:30:33.430 --> 05:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
quite a bit the more guidance and
 
05:30:35.270 --> 05:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
direction this legislative body can give
 
05:30:37.590 --> 05:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
to the department as to what you want
 
05:30:38.990 --> 05:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
the rules to
 
05:30:41.708 --> 05:30:41.718 align:start position:0%
Encompass is is helpful to the
 
05:30:44.150 --> 05:30:44.160 align:start position:0%
department also rule making Authority
 
05:30:46.590 --> 05:30:46.600 align:start position:0%
belongs to the state board it is not a
 
05:30:48.390 --> 05:30:48.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner Authority it is not a
 
05:30:52.590 --> 05:30:52.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:54.628 --> 05:30:54.638 align:start position:0%
authority I hope I've answered your
 
05:31:00.788 --> 05:31:00.798 align:start position:0%
question um follow up yes if I can um so
 
05:31:03.230 --> 05:31:03.240 align:start position:0%
I guess the other thing is that if
 
05:31:05.430 --> 05:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
schools can call off for snow days and
 
05:31:09.470 --> 05:31:09.480 align:start position:0%
schools can call off for covid or that
 
05:31:12.110 --> 05:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
the commissioner the or whoever down at
 
05:31:13.948 --> 05:31:13.958 align:start position:0%
this Department of Education decides
 
05:31:16.390 --> 05:31:16.400 align:start position:0%
whether schools can cancel because of
 
05:31:19.548 --> 05:31:19.558 align:start position:0%
low attendance because of covid or not
 
05:31:23.070 --> 05:31:23.080 align:start position:0%
um without Ru making why I I understand
 
05:31:25.708 --> 05:31:25.718 align:start position:0%
the need for the or not the need but why
 
05:31:27.708 --> 05:31:27.718 align:start position:0%
we would like the other part to really
 
05:31:29.270 --> 05:31:29.280 align:start position:0%
highlight this event like everybody's
 
05:31:31.270 --> 05:31:31.280 align:start position:0%
jazzed this all up now like you said
 
05:31:32.590 --> 05:31:32.600 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm tot I'm glad I've got the
 
05:31:36.230 --> 05:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
glasses right um uh but you know I'm
 
05:31:38.670 --> 05:31:38.680 align:start position:0%
just concerned of why that's added and
 
05:31:42.270 --> 05:31:42.280 align:start position:0%
and um why it's necessary at this point
 
05:31:46.548 --> 05:31:46.558 align:start position:0%
um as far as schools is it so so if a
 
05:31:49.390 --> 05:31:49.400 align:start position:0%
school wanted to call it off they could
 
05:31:51.110 --> 05:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
if they wanted to have a half day they
 
05:31:53.830 --> 05:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
could uh isn't that true at this point
 
05:31:57.830 --> 05:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:00.948 --> 05:32:00.958 align:start position:0%
making I appreciate the question I I
 
05:32:04.190 --> 05:32:04.200 align:start position:0%
don't know if comparing this to to covid
 
05:32:06.868 --> 05:32:06.878 align:start position:0%
is an appropriate comparison simply
 
05:32:08.310 --> 05:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
because that was a public health
 
05:32:11.590 --> 05:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
emergency and so I would be hesitant to
 
05:32:14.628 --> 05:32:14.638 align:start position:0%
look at that instance and compare it
 
05:32:16.150 --> 05:32:16.160 align:start position:0%
with this simply because there were
 
05:32:19.070 --> 05:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
other issues at play I.E the public
 
05:32:21.590 --> 05:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
health emergency that are not part of
 
05:32:24.750 --> 05:32:24.760 align:start position:0%
this I think that what you are hearing
 
05:32:26.470 --> 05:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
from the people who testify and what you
 
05:32:28.788 --> 05:32:28.798 align:start position:0%
are hearing from the field is that the
 
05:32:30.430 --> 05:32:30.440 align:start position:0%
field wants the support of the
 
05:32:34.310 --> 05:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
department in making this decision and I
 
05:32:36.510 --> 05:32:36.520 align:start position:0%
can tell you in other areas you know I
 
05:32:37.990 --> 05:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
have heard that across the board where
 
05:32:39.670 --> 05:32:39.680 align:start position:0%
the field looks to the department for
 
05:32:41.948 --> 05:32:41.958 align:start position:0%
their you know approval and I use that
 
05:32:44.470 --> 05:32:44.480 align:start position:0%
word Loosely um and just their support
 
05:32:46.868 --> 05:32:46.878 align:start position:0%
in making this in making these decisions
 
05:32:49.590 --> 05:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
and I I think that's the subtext of this
 
05:32:51.270 --> 05:32:51.280 align:start position:0%
bill and I think that's been what I've
 
05:32:53.788 --> 05:32:53.798 align:start position:0%
heard in this testimony
 
05:32:57.150 --> 05:32:57.160 align:start position:0%
um you know in in terms of your question
 
05:33:00.270 --> 05:33:00.280 align:start position:0%
as couldn't they already do this I think
 
05:33:02.390 --> 05:33:02.400 align:start position:0%
they could I say that as a bit of a
 
05:33:03.868 --> 05:33:03.878 align:start position:0%
caveat I'd have to look into a little
 
05:33:06.030 --> 05:33:06.040 align:start position:0%
bit more but I I think that they could
 
05:33:08.110 --> 05:33:08.120 align:start position:0%
I.E I will refer you to my previous
 
05:33:09.788 --> 05:33:09.798 align:start position:0%
testimony is I'm planning to take my
 
05:33:12.470 --> 05:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
children out of school uh so there's
 
05:33:15.990 --> 05:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
that um you'll see if you see me here on
 
05:33:17.990 --> 05:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
April 8th but
 
05:33:20.910 --> 05:33:20.920 align:start position:0%
um I again I think this is more of just
 
05:33:23.030 --> 05:33:23.040 align:start position:0%
looking for that support from the
 
05:33:25.750 --> 05:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
Department um we all know at this
 
05:33:27.510 --> 05:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
committee the more that the local
 
05:33:29.390 --> 05:33:29.400 align:start position:0%
districts and the department can be
 
05:33:29.400 --> 05:33:30.590 align:start position:0%
districts and the department can be
working

05:33:30.590 --> 05:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
working
 
05:33:34.270 --> 05:33:34.280 align:start position:0%
together is helpful to all of us so
 
05:33:36.190 --> 05:33:36.200 align:start position:0%
again I will I'm happy to get back to
 
05:33:39.948 --> 05:33:39.958 align:start position:0%
you on your question I think that um any
 
05:33:41.750 --> 05:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
concerns about the rul making can easily
 
05:33:41.760 --> 05:33:42.910 align:start position:0%
concerns about the rul making can easily
be

05:33:42.910 --> 05:33:42.920 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:33:45.590 --> 05:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
addressed by just adding in some clarity
 
05:33:47.470 --> 05:33:47.480 align:start position:0%
as to what this legislative body wants
 
05:33:49.110 --> 05:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
those rules to
 
05:33:51.788 --> 05:33:51.798 align:start position:0%
Encompass thank you any further
 
05:33:54.788 --> 05:33:54.798 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative lakus
 
05:33:57.430 --> 05:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
please yes I'm just looking at the time
 
05:33:59.910 --> 05:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
thing and wondering how long it takes to
 
05:34:02.070 --> 05:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
to do this Ru making when this is a
 
05:34:04.548 --> 05:34:04.558 align:start position:0%
fast-paced Bill thank you for the
 
05:34:06.230 --> 05:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
question and you're absolutely correct
 
05:34:08.350 --> 05:34:08.360 align:start position:0%
uh rule making anyone who's familiar
 
05:34:09.990 --> 05:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
with the process knows that it it takes
 
05:34:13.150 --> 05:34:13.160 align:start position:0%
a long time um I call it a legislative
 
05:34:15.190 --> 05:34:15.200 align:start position:0%
tennis match because there's a lot of
 
05:34:17.788 --> 05:34:17.798 align:start position:0%
back and forth and it never seems to end
 
05:34:20.470 --> 05:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
right so and I like tennis but
 
05:34:24.350 --> 05:34:24.360 align:start position:0%
um there are ways to get rules in front
 
05:34:26.990 --> 05:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
and moving quickly I.E emergency rul
 
05:34:29.868 --> 05:34:29.878 align:start position:0%
making they're there're different little
 
05:34:32.110 --> 05:34:32.120 align:start position:0%
mechanisms that we could work with I do
 
05:34:34.868 --> 05:34:34.878 align:start position:0%
want to reach out to OS to make sure
 
05:34:38.548 --> 05:34:38.558 align:start position:0%
that this would fall within one of those
 
05:34:41.708 --> 05:34:41.718 align:start position:0%
um exceptions to the rule I know
 
05:34:44.190 --> 05:34:44.200 align:start position:0%
emergency rule making is is limited it
 
05:34:46.070 --> 05:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
really is emergency Ru making for
 
05:34:48.590 --> 05:34:48.600 align:start position:0%
certain purposes so I need to check with
 
05:34:50.310 --> 05:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
that and I'm happy to do that and get
 
05:34:51.830 --> 05:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
back to this committee to see if that
 
05:34:54.350 --> 05:34:54.360 align:start position:0%
would fit within those parameters great
 
05:34:55.910 --> 05:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
thank you that would be appreciated of
 
05:34:58.830 --> 05:34:58.840 align:start position:0%
course um see no further questions thank
 
05:35:02.270 --> 05:35:02.280 align:start position:0%
you very much for uh getting
 
05:35:05.270 --> 05:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
jazzed Mr chair Mr chair before you
 
05:35:07.390 --> 05:35:07.400 align:start position:0%
adjourn this is it possible to have the
 
05:35:09.548 --> 05:35:09.558 align:start position:0%
the general cour clerk answer questions
 
05:35:11.230 --> 05:35:11.240 align:start position:0%
since he's here for his professional
 
05:35:15.190 --> 05:35:15.200 align:start position:0%
opinion uh related to this bill the
 
05:35:15.200 --> 05:35:17.708 align:start position:0%
opinion uh related to this bill the
legislation

05:35:17.708 --> 05:35:17.718 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
05:35:20.190 --> 05:35:20.200 align:start position:0%
um I I why don't you talk to the clerk
 
05:35:22.070 --> 05:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
afterwards we were're kind of late for
 
05:35:24.788 --> 05:35:24.798 align:start position:0%
public it's because it's public
 
05:35:27.310 --> 05:35:27.320 align:start position:0%
information it's a process Bill a
 
05:35:29.270 --> 05:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
process question would would you like to
 
05:35:35.310 --> 05:35:35.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:37.548 --> 05:35:37.558 align:start position:0%
clerk thank you appreciate that I can
 
05:35:40.750 --> 05:35:40.760 align:start position:0%
see you're excited about it um my my
 
05:35:44.628 --> 05:35:44.638 align:start position:0%
question deals with uh timing in in your
 
05:35:46.830 --> 05:35:46.840 align:start position:0%
opinion knowing how bills if this was
 
05:35:50.190 --> 05:35:50.200 align:start position:0%
fast-tracked and passed and passed is it
 
05:35:52.150 --> 05:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
possible to have this approved and
 
05:35:56.750 --> 05:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
signed in time for an April deadline yes
 
05:35:58.628 --> 05:35:58.638 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair uh thank
 
05:36:00.350 --> 05:36:00.360 align:start position:0%
you Mr Clerk
 
05:36:04.190 --> 05:36:04.200 align:start position:0%
with with that I will again uh end U the
 
05:36:08.830 --> 05:36:08.840 align:start position:0%
hearing on uh House Bill uh
 
05:36:08.840 --> 05:36:11.708 align:start position:0%
hearing on uh House Bill uh
1471

05:36:11.708 --> 05:36:11.718 align:start position:0%
1471
 
05:36:16.750 --> 05:36:16.760 align:start position:0%
um and we'll um switch clerks and
 
05:36:18.788 --> 05:36:18.798 align:start position:0%
proceed to House Bill
 
05:36:23.310 --> 05:36:23.320 align:start position:0%
1206 relative to prohibiting educator
 
05:36:25.670 --> 05:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
indoctrination um and I would just uh
 
05:36:28.948 --> 05:36:28.958 align:start position:0%
point out um to the prime sponsor that
 
05:36:30.750 --> 05:36:30.760 align:start position:0%
we'll need a car from you when you're
 
05:36:34.350 --> 05:36:34.360 align:start position:0%
finished um and also that this is a
 
05:36:37.190 --> 05:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
hearing um it's not an exec session so
 
05:36:39.910 --> 05:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
it's not a debate it's just a
 
05:36:43.910 --> 05:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
hearing so with that um I call on the
 
05:36:46.628 --> 05:36:46.638 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor representative
 
05:36:49.110 --> 05:36:49.120 align:start position:0%
lakas hello and thank you for
 
05:36:51.868 --> 05:36:51.878 align:start position:0%
considering my bill Alicia leas Hills
 
05:36:56.350 --> 05:36:56.360 align:start position:0%
burial 38 which is Hudson and
 
05:36:56.360 --> 05:36:58.590 align:start position:0%
burial 38 which is Hudson and
Lichfield

05:36:58.590 --> 05:36:58.600 align:start position:0%
Lichfield
 
05:37:01.788 --> 05:37:01.798 align:start position:0%
um for a very long time we have been
 
05:37:04.390 --> 05:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
told that it's very important to
 
05:37:06.868 --> 05:37:06.878 align:start position:0%
understand intentive bills and things
 
05:37:09.190 --> 05:37:09.200 align:start position:0%
like that because it is
 
05:37:12.708 --> 05:37:12.718 align:start position:0%
used in court cases Etc to understand
 
05:37:16.030 --> 05:37:16.040 align:start position:0%
what was actually meant so to try to
 
05:37:20.390 --> 05:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
avoid um misunderstanding I'm going to
 
05:37:23.310 --> 05:37:23.320 align:start position:0%
uh try to cover whatever questions I can
 
05:37:26.788 --> 05:37:26.798 align:start position:0%
think of and make sure people understand
 
05:37:29.948 --> 05:37:29.958 align:start position:0%
what this bill is about and um what
 
05:37:32.390 --> 05:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
might be considered indoctrination spend
 
05:37:35.310 --> 05:37:35.320 align:start position:0%
for one minute um would someone be
 
05:37:37.990 --> 05:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
willing to close the doors there um
 
05:37:41.350 --> 05:37:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:44.868 --> 05:37:44.878 align:start position:0%
hallway thank you please uh proceed
 
05:37:47.548 --> 05:37:47.558 align:start position:0%
representative so I worked on this
 
05:37:49.830 --> 05:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
language for a long time because I
 
05:37:52.350 --> 05:37:52.360 align:start position:0%
wanted to get it as clear as possible
 
05:37:55.470 --> 05:37:55.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:59.030 --> 05:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
as to make it to be understood by any
 
05:38:02.230 --> 05:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
random person as much as possible I talk
 
05:38:05.788 --> 05:38:05.798 align:start position:0%
to a lot of people I talk to an English
 
05:38:07.628 --> 05:38:07.638 align:start position:0%
Professor a
 
05:38:11.310 --> 05:38:11.320 align:start position:0%
lawyer um working and and many many
 
05:38:13.430 --> 05:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
other people many legislators many
 
05:38:15.190 --> 05:38:15.200 align:start position:0%
friends trying to figure out how to make
 
05:38:17.830 --> 05:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
this as clear as possible and I will go
 
05:38:21.910 --> 05:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:25.948 --> 05:38:25.958 align:start position:0%
um to try to help keep it from being
 
05:38:28.590 --> 05:38:28.600 align:start position:0%
misunderstood now I know that people can
 
05:38:31.310 --> 05:38:31.320 align:start position:0%
misunderstand anything including
 
05:38:31.320 --> 05:38:32.510 align:start position:0%
misunderstand anything including
intentional

05:38:32.510 --> 05:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
intentional
 
05:38:35.590 --> 05:38:35.600 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding just look at any Genie
 
05:38:37.350 --> 05:38:37.360 align:start position:0%
who's granting
 
05:38:40.310 --> 05:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
wishes and in case you're wondering yes
 
05:38:42.590 --> 05:38:42.600 align:start position:0%
that's a fictional
 
05:38:42.600 --> 05:38:44.150 align:start position:0%
that's a fictional
reference

05:38:44.150 --> 05:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
reference
 
05:38:47.430 --> 05:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
um so I'm going to go line by line
 
05:38:49.948 --> 05:38:49.958 align:start position:0%
Educators shall not present unproved
 
05:38:54.310 --> 05:38:54.320 align:start position:0%
theories as fact so it's not a matter of
 
05:38:56.708 --> 05:38:56.718 align:start position:0%
not presenting theories or any theories
 
05:38:59.548 --> 05:38:59.558 align:start position:0%
being banned or anything it's just how
 
05:39:01.670 --> 05:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
they're presented are they presented as
 
05:39:04.750 --> 05:39:04.760 align:start position:0%
a theory or is they presented as a fact
 
05:39:08.990 --> 05:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
2 + 2 = 4 that's a fact nothing can
 
05:39:11.628 --> 05:39:11.638 align:start position:0%
travel faster than the speed of light
 
05:39:14.750 --> 05:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
that's a theory now there's a lot of
 
05:39:18.190 --> 05:39:18.200 align:start position:0%
evidence for it but we still don't know
 
05:39:22.350 --> 05:39:22.360 align:start position:0%
it it hasn't been proved and maybe
 
05:39:23.990 --> 05:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
there's beginning to be some evidence
 
05:39:25.948 --> 05:39:25.958 align:start position:0%
that some particles might go faster than
 
05:39:28.750 --> 05:39:28.760 align:start position:0%
the speed of light or maybe they go
 
05:39:30.230 --> 05:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
backwards and
 
05:39:32.910 --> 05:39:32.920 align:start position:0%
time we're not really sure but at any
 
05:39:36.468 --> 05:39:36.478 align:start position:0%
rate that's a theory and so a lot of
 
05:39:40.110 --> 05:39:40.120 align:start position:0%
times what we hear and see people
 
05:39:44.628 --> 05:39:44.638 align:start position:0%
objecting to is when um theories are
 
05:39:49.590 --> 05:39:49.600 align:start position:0%
presented as fact and H how can you tell
 
05:39:52.110 --> 05:39:52.120 align:start position:0%
well first off it's very difficult to
 
05:39:54.310 --> 05:39:54.320 align:start position:0%
prove something is true it's very diff
 
05:39:56.430 --> 05:39:56.440 align:start position:0%
it's very easy to prove that it's not
 
05:39:59.430 --> 05:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
you only need one counter example and
 
05:40:01.868 --> 05:40:01.878 align:start position:0%
know it's not true but to prove that it
 
05:40:06.070 --> 05:40:06.080 align:start position:0%
is true that can take well we still have
 
05:40:08.670 --> 05:40:08.680 align:start position:0%
things that we can't prove or true that
 
05:40:11.150 --> 05:40:11.160 align:start position:0%
most people kind of believe are true but
 
05:40:14.070 --> 05:40:14.080 align:start position:0%
we can't prove it so it always has to be
 
05:40:18.150 --> 05:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
couched in terms of a theory think about
 
05:40:21.430 --> 05:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
Galileo right think about for how long
 
05:40:23.548 --> 05:40:23.558 align:start position:0%
we believe the Earth was the center of
 
05:40:26.628 --> 05:40:26.638 align:start position:0%
the solar system and what a big deal
 
05:40:26.638 --> 05:40:28.310 align:start position:0%
the solar system and what a big deal
that

05:40:28.310 --> 05:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:40:28.320 --> 05:40:31.270 align:start position:0%
that
was

05:40:31.270 --> 05:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:40:31.280 --> 05:40:32.510 align:start position:0%
was
[Music]

05:40:32.510 --> 05:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:40:36.150 --> 05:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
um so we have to be
 
05:40:38.990 --> 05:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
careful and an example that we were
 
05:40:40.910 --> 05:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
taught when I was in school was Neil's
 
05:40:44.070 --> 05:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
bore and his indivisible Adam and the
 
05:40:46.868 --> 05:40:46.878 align:start position:0%
Adam was the smallest that anything
 
05:40:49.510 --> 05:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
could be divided into any matter could
 
05:40:52.070 --> 05:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
be divided into and we were taught that
 
05:40:54.708 --> 05:40:54.718 align:start position:0%
not because it was still believed but so
 
05:40:57.628 --> 05:40:57.638 align:start position:0%
that we could understand how ideas
 
05:41:00.590 --> 05:41:00.600 align:start position:0%
change and that we wouldn't just assume
 
05:41:03.590 --> 05:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
something was true that we would
 
05:41:05.548 --> 05:41:05.558 align:start position:0%
understand that well this is our best
 
05:41:07.830 --> 05:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
understanding at the moment but that
 
05:41:10.030 --> 05:41:10.040 align:start position:0%
will change that will change in my years
 
05:41:12.190 --> 05:41:12.200 align:start position:0%
of studying physics I've certainly
 
05:41:14.030 --> 05:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
learned a lot of things that were very
 
05:41:16.868 --> 05:41:16.878 align:start position:0%
different than when I was first taught
 
05:41:19.350 --> 05:41:19.360 align:start position:0%
and that was why we were taught about
 
05:41:23.030 --> 05:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
Neil's bore and the indivisible atom um
 
05:41:24.708 --> 05:41:24.718 align:start position:0%
which would now we know there's lots of
 
05:41:24.718 --> 05:41:27.788 align:start position:0%
which would now we know there's lots of
particles

05:41:27.788 --> 05:41:27.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:30.230 --> 05:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
right so we have have to be careful as
 
05:41:32.868 --> 05:41:32.878 align:start position:0%
teachers that we pass on
 
05:41:36.310 --> 05:41:36.320 align:start position:0%
that skepticism that okay this is what
 
05:41:37.590 --> 05:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
we believe
 
05:41:40.468 --> 05:41:40.478 align:start position:0%
today but that doesn't mean it's true
 
05:41:42.270 --> 05:41:42.280 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
05:41:42.280 --> 05:41:43.788 align:start position:0%
it's a
theory

05:41:43.788 --> 05:41:43.798 align:start position:0%
theory
 
05:41:47.030 --> 05:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
um as part of that I just want to talk
 
05:41:49.390 --> 05:41:49.400 align:start position:0%
about modeling because some of the new
 
05:41:53.948 --> 05:41:53.958 align:start position:0%
science uses modeling and you also
 
05:41:57.468 --> 05:41:57.478 align:start position:0%
can't conflate the two modeling can give
 
05:42:01.110 --> 05:42:01.120 align:start position:0%
you it's a tool to help you make
 
05:42:03.350 --> 05:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
predictions but if a model says
 
05:42:05.830 --> 05:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
something it doesn't make it a fact and
 
05:42:08.990 --> 05:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
so when you you can use it to help you
 
05:42:11.510 --> 05:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
make predictions right up until the
 
05:42:13.230 --> 05:42:13.240 align:start position:0%
prediction doesn't hold and then you
 
05:42:15.910 --> 05:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
know oh my model isn't quite right let's
 
05:42:18.590 --> 05:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
go back and fix it I've developed
 
05:42:22.310 --> 05:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
models um and that was always open was
 
05:42:25.910 --> 05:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
how we can easily change that model to
 
05:42:29.190 --> 05:42:29.200 align:start position:0%
to represent what's happened and so
 
05:42:30.910 --> 05:42:30.920 align:start position:0%
anytime you have a model that doesn't
 
05:42:33.590 --> 05:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
always hold true it's not a true model
 
05:42:35.750 --> 05:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
so it's you you can't say well the model
 
05:42:37.110 --> 05:42:37.120 align:start position:0%
predicts this
 
05:42:39.230 --> 05:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
therefore this is what's going to happen
 
05:42:41.430 --> 05:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
no the model predicts this therefore
 
05:42:42.948 --> 05:42:42.958 align:start position:0%
well there's a pretty good chance we
 
05:42:45.468 --> 05:42:45.478 align:start position:0%
hope if we did our model right and so
 
05:42:47.788 --> 05:42:47.798 align:start position:0%
you can't do that teach that as fact
 
05:42:53.468 --> 05:42:53.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:53.478 --> 05:42:58.070 align:start position:0%
 
guess

05:42:58.070 --> 05:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:58.080 --> 05:42:59.830 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:42:59.830 --> 05:42:59.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:42:59.840 --> 05:43:01.030 align:start position:0%
um
another

05:43:01.030 --> 05:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
another
 
05:43:03.910 --> 05:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
way if you're asking yourself is if
 
05:43:07.350 --> 05:43:07.360 align:start position:0%
you're a teacher is this fact or is this
 
05:43:07.360 --> 05:43:08.190 align:start position:0%
you're a teacher is this fact or is this
a

05:43:08.190 --> 05:43:08.200 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:43:12.270 --> 05:43:12.280 align:start position:0%
theory another a sort of a a guide poost
 
05:43:14.110 --> 05:43:14.120 align:start position:0%
that you can use is if there are other
 
05:43:16.270 --> 05:43:16.280 align:start position:0%
people who believe differently it's
 
05:43:17.788 --> 05:43:17.798 align:start position:0%
probably a
 
05:43:21.270 --> 05:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
theory and so rather than teaching it as
 
05:43:24.310 --> 05:43:24.320 align:start position:0%
this is the truth you teach it as this
 
05:43:27.590 --> 05:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
is one Theory and then there are people
 
05:43:29.670 --> 05:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
out there who believe another theory
 
05:43:33.310 --> 05:43:33.320 align:start position:0%
the just like in Galileo's time right
 
05:43:35.830 --> 05:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
you had Galileo and people who followed
 
05:43:39.230 --> 05:43:39.240 align:start position:0%
him who were very much opposed to the
 
05:43:41.510 --> 05:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
idea that the Earth was in the center of
 
05:43:44.230 --> 05:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
the solar system it's the same thing
 
05:43:46.750 --> 05:43:46.760 align:start position:0%
when you start hearing those other ideas
 
05:43:49.230 --> 05:43:49.240 align:start position:0%
that should be a clue to you that this
 
05:43:51.390 --> 05:43:51.400 align:start position:0%
is not a fact I'm going to be teaching
 
05:43:53.750 --> 05:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
this is a theory and I have to present
 
05:43:56.030 --> 05:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
other theories whatever other people is
 
05:43:57.990 --> 05:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
the world flat is it
 
05:44:01.510 --> 05:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
round etc etc there are lots of things
 
05:44:04.468 --> 05:44:04.478 align:start position:0%
today that I hear being taught as fact
 
05:44:07.390 --> 05:44:07.400 align:start position:0%
that are really theories and how do you
 
05:44:09.830 --> 05:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
know well you don't necessarily know but
 
05:44:12.070 --> 05:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
if there's a PO portion of the
 
05:44:14.310 --> 05:44:14.320 align:start position:0%
population that disagrees well they're
 
05:44:17.350 --> 05:44:17.360 align:start position:0%
not just nut jobs or science deniers or
 
05:44:19.590 --> 05:44:19.600 align:start position:0%
whatever you might think they are
 
05:44:21.468 --> 05:44:21.478 align:start position:0%
because you think you are
 
05:44:24.548 --> 05:44:24.558 align:start position:0%
right no it means they have a different
 
05:44:31.500 --> 05:44:31.510 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:31.510 --> 05:44:32.788 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

05:44:32.788 --> 05:44:32.798 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:44:35.830 --> 05:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
um another thing I want to talk about
 
05:44:39.350 --> 05:44:39.360 align:start position:0%
then would be value statements and the
 
05:44:39.360 --> 05:44:41.468 align:start position:0%
then would be value statements and the
ACLU

05:44:41.468 --> 05:44:41.478 align:start position:0%
ACLU
 
05:44:45.350 --> 05:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
wrote and they asked some
 
05:44:45.360 --> 05:44:47.390 align:start position:0%
wrote and they asked some
specific

05:44:47.390 --> 05:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
specific
 
05:44:51.110 --> 05:44:51.120 align:start position:0%
uh questions about whether or not things
 
05:44:51.120 --> 05:44:51.910 align:start position:0%
uh questions about whether or not things
would

05:44:51.910 --> 05:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
would
 
05:44:56.670 --> 05:44:56.680 align:start position:0%
be all allowed so to speak
 
05:45:00.590 --> 05:45:00.600 align:start position:0%
um in teaching a unit on the Holocaust
 
05:45:02.910 --> 05:45:02.920 align:start position:0%
teaching that totalitarian forms of
 
05:45:06.070 --> 05:45:06.080 align:start position:0%
government are wrong with that be banned
 
05:45:08.150 --> 05:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
would an educator statement that
 
05:45:13.628 --> 05:45:13.638 align:start position:0%
neo-nazism or racism in 2024 is wrong be
 
05:45:13.638 --> 05:45:16.910 align:start position:0%
neo-nazism or racism in 2024 is wrong be
banned

05:45:16.910 --> 05:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:20.910 --> 05:45:20.920 align:start position:0%
um Can an educator say that the theory
 
05:45:24.430 --> 05:45:24.440 align:start position:0%
there's that word theory of evolution is
 
05:45:26.868 --> 05:45:26.878 align:start position:0%
correct well none of those things are
 
05:45:29.468 --> 05:45:29.478 align:start position:0%
right you couldn't do that
 
05:45:32.190 --> 05:45:32.200 align:start position:0%
people might think oh but those make
 
05:45:36.750 --> 05:45:36.760 align:start position:0%
complete sense Hitler was a bad
 
05:45:39.990 --> 05:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
man but what they have in common is they
 
05:45:42.590 --> 05:45:42.600 align:start position:0%
have a value statement and certainly
 
05:45:44.468 --> 05:45:44.478 align:start position:0%
when I was in English as a kid I learned
 
05:45:48.750 --> 05:45:48.760 align:start position:0%
what value statements were you're
 
05:45:52.628 --> 05:45:52.638 align:start position:0%
making a value judgment on that thing or
 
05:45:54.948 --> 05:45:54.958 align:start position:0%
person Hitler was
 
05:45:58.030 --> 05:45:58.040 align:start position:0%
bad totalitarian forms of government are
 
05:45:58.040 --> 05:45:59.628 align:start position:0%
bad totalitarian forms of government are
bad

05:45:59.628 --> 05:45:59.638 align:start position:0%
bad
 
05:46:02.830 --> 05:46:02.840 align:start position:0%
once you use those words good bad once
 
05:46:05.468 --> 05:46:05.478 align:start position:0%
you make value in there that's an
 
05:46:08.708 --> 05:46:08.718 align:start position:0%
opinion okay it may be that most people
 
05:46:11.230 --> 05:46:11.240 align:start position:0%
believe that Hitler was bad it's still
 
05:46:11.240 --> 05:46:12.030 align:start position:0%
believe that Hitler was bad it's still
an

05:46:12.030 --> 05:46:12.040 align:start position:0%
an
 
05:46:15.070 --> 05:46:15.080 align:start position:0%
opinion rather than saying Hitler was
 
05:46:18.350 --> 05:46:18.360 align:start position:0%
bad you show what did
 
05:46:22.190 --> 05:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
Hitler do what did he say what did he do
 
05:46:24.548 --> 05:46:24.558 align:start position:0%
you let the student make that
 
05:46:27.070 --> 05:46:27.080 align:start position:0%
determination Hitler was good or Hitler
 
05:46:30.310 --> 05:46:30.320 align:start position:0%
was bad you give the
 
05:46:34.548 --> 05:46:34.558 align:start position:0%
facts Hitler did this Hitler said that
 
05:46:34.558 --> 05:46:35.788 align:start position:0%
facts Hitler did this Hitler said that
and

05:46:35.788 --> 05:46:35.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:46:39.030 --> 05:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
then for kids who were a little more
 
05:46:41.070 --> 05:46:41.080 align:start position:0%
advanced maybe middle school or
 
05:46:44.310 --> 05:46:44.320 align:start position:0%
certainly in high school how did he get
 
05:46:49.230 --> 05:46:49.240 align:start position:0%
away with that how did the people in his
 
05:46:51.948 --> 05:46:51.958 align:start position:0%
government follow along with what he was
 
05:46:54.628 --> 05:46:54.638 align:start position:0%
doing how did they send all those Jews
 
05:46:56.990 --> 05:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
to work camps and to gas
 
05:47:00.350 --> 05:47:00.360 align:start position:0%
Chambers how did people let that happen
 
05:47:02.708 --> 05:47:02.718 align:start position:0%
and that's a good discussion because
 
05:47:05.948 --> 05:47:05.958 align:start position:0%
those things can happen
 
05:47:09.350 --> 05:47:09.360 align:start position:0%
anywhere now or in the
 
05:47:12.948 --> 05:47:12.958 align:start position:0%
future so you don't need if you give a
 
05:47:16.510 --> 05:47:16.520 align:start position:0%
value judgment what happens is you close
 
05:47:16.520 --> 05:47:17.708 align:start position:0%
value judgment what happens is you close
down

05:47:17.708 --> 05:47:17.718 align:start position:0%
down
 
05:47:20.230 --> 05:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
communication if you leave it open and
 
05:47:23.070 --> 05:47:23.080 align:start position:0%
give the facts and let kids think about
 
05:47:25.948 --> 05:47:25.958 align:start position:0%
it you're actually opening up
 
05:47:28.030 --> 05:47:28.040 align:start position:0%
conversation the kids aren't looking to
 
05:47:31.030 --> 05:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
you to tell tell them what to think
 
05:47:32.548 --> 05:47:32.558 align:start position:0%
they're beginning to think for
 
05:47:34.670 --> 05:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
themselves and after all that's what
 
05:47:36.948 --> 05:47:36.958 align:start position:0%
we're supposed to be doing we're
 
05:47:38.750 --> 05:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
supposed to be teaching kids how to
 
05:47:41.628 --> 05:47:41.638 align:start position:0%
think not what to think and as soon as
 
05:47:44.190 --> 05:47:44.200 align:start position:0%
you start telling students what to think
 
05:47:45.990 --> 05:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
you're shutting
 
05:47:48.788 --> 05:47:48.798 align:start position:0%
down you're shutting down their own
 
05:47:48.798 --> 05:47:49.788 align:start position:0%
down you're shutting down their own
mental

05:47:49.788 --> 05:47:49.798 align:start position:0%
mental
 
05:47:52.350 --> 05:47:52.360 align:start position:0%
development you want to encourage you
 
05:47:54.150 --> 05:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
want to open them
 
05:47:57.708 --> 05:47:57.718 align:start position:0%
up to give them other ways of thinking
 
05:48:00.590 --> 05:48:00.600 align:start position:0%
so you want to present information but
 
05:48:03.390 --> 05:48:03.400 align:start position:0%
you want them to come to their own
 
05:48:05.948 --> 05:48:05.958 align:start position:0%
conclusions and that's a lot of what
 
05:48:09.468 --> 05:48:09.478 align:start position:0%
this bill is about is encouraging kids
 
05:48:11.230 --> 05:48:11.240 align:start position:0%
figuring out ways of
 
05:48:14.190 --> 05:48:14.200 align:start position:0%
teaching to open
 
05:48:17.990 --> 05:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
up um a person's ability to think to
 
05:48:21.750 --> 05:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:25.110 --> 05:48:25.120 align:start position:0%
conclusions when I was in school we had
 
05:48:25.120 --> 05:48:26.510 align:start position:0%
conclusions when I was in school we had
no

05:48:26.510 --> 05:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
no
 
05:48:28.910 --> 05:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
idea what our teachers political
 
05:48:33.030 --> 05:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
viewpoints were what their sexuality was
 
05:48:35.750 --> 05:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
anything like that the teachers
 
05:48:38.270 --> 05:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
presented us
 
05:48:40.830 --> 05:48:40.840 align:start position:0%
with what
 
05:48:44.350 --> 05:48:44.360 align:start position:0%
happened and let us figure out those
 
05:48:46.830 --> 05:48:46.840 align:start position:0%
questions they might even ask us I mean
 
05:48:48.548 --> 05:48:48.558 align:start position:0%
a good one
 
05:48:48.558 --> 05:48:50.190 align:start position:0%
a good one
here

05:48:50.190 --> 05:48:50.200 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:48:50.200 --> 05:48:52.070 align:start position:0%
here

[Music]
 
05:48:55.150 --> 05:48:55.160 align:start position:0%
um would a statement that communism is
 
05:48:57.990 --> 05:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
an unsuccessful form of government be
 
05:48:58.000 --> 05:49:00.070 align:start position:0%
an unsuccessful form of government be
banned

05:49:00.070 --> 05:49:00.080 align:start position:0%
banned
 
05:49:05.350 --> 05:49:05.360 align:start position:0%
well rather than saying something like
 
05:49:09.948 --> 05:49:09.958 align:start position:0%
that you could you you could look at the
 
05:49:13.350 --> 05:49:13.360 align:start position:0%
various forms times that communism has
 
05:49:15.948 --> 05:49:15.958 align:start position:0%
been instituted through history you
 
05:49:20.070 --> 05:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
could assign that as a
 
05:49:22.910 --> 05:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
question but first you have to say what
 
05:49:24.948 --> 05:49:24.958 align:start position:0%
does unsuccessful mean what does it mean
 
05:49:28.628 --> 05:49:28.638 align:start position:0%
to be successful what does it mean to
 
05:49:30.990 --> 05:49:31.000 align:start position:0%
succeed what does it mean to fail
 
05:49:32.628 --> 05:49:32.638 align:start position:0%
because whenever you're going for a
 
05:49:35.390 --> 05:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
proof I'm a mathematician and I always
 
05:49:38.190 --> 05:49:38.200 align:start position:0%
learned first thing you do is you define
 
05:49:41.750 --> 05:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
your terms be and so same thing with
 
05:49:44.070 --> 05:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
having a conversation Define your terms
 
05:49:46.390 --> 05:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
before you even start discussing or you
 
05:49:48.708 --> 05:49:48.718 align:start position:0%
can end up fighting with each other when
 
05:49:51.150 --> 05:49:51.160 align:start position:0%
you really agree but you just have a
 
05:49:53.310 --> 05:49:53.320 align:start position:0%
different idea what the words mean so
 
05:49:57.430 --> 05:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
Define your terms send it as a uh an
 
05:50:00.750 --> 05:50:00.760 align:start position:0%
assignment for them to figure out is is
 
05:50:03.788 --> 05:50:03.798 align:start position:0%
it successful is it not now when does it
 
05:50:07.110 --> 05:50:07.120 align:start position:0%
get to be indoctrination when you have a
 
05:50:10.230 --> 05:50:10.240 align:start position:0%
set answer for that when you've decided
 
05:50:12.948 --> 05:50:12.958 align:start position:0%
yourself yes it's successful no it's not
 
05:50:15.708 --> 05:50:15.718 align:start position:0%
successful and you grade accordingly If
 
05:50:18.390 --> 05:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
instead you grade did the student give a
 
05:50:20.670 --> 05:50:20.680 align:start position:0%
good definition did he follow up his
 
05:50:24.510 --> 05:50:24.520 align:start position:0%
definition did he back up whichever he
 
05:50:27.430 --> 05:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
decided according to that
 
05:50:30.708 --> 05:50:30.718 align:start position:0%
definition does he have a case if he
 
05:50:32.270 --> 05:50:32.280 align:start position:0%
came up with
 
05:50:36.708 --> 05:50:36.718 align:start position:0%
a an exception to that then it's not a
 
05:50:39.110 --> 05:50:39.120 align:start position:0%
true thing because he's came he has come
 
05:50:42.030 --> 05:50:42.040 align:start position:0%
up with an exception to the statement
 
05:50:43.788 --> 05:50:43.798 align:start position:0%
therefore it's not
 
05:50:46.468 --> 05:50:46.478 align:start position:0%
true if you grade that way that's not
 
05:50:48.830 --> 05:50:48.840 align:start position:0%
indoctrination that's teaching kids to
 
05:50:51.270 --> 05:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
think teaching kids to do research
 
05:50:53.590 --> 05:50:53.600 align:start position:0%
teaching kids to come up with answers if
 
05:50:55.430 --> 05:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
you've decided ahead of time yes it's
 
05:50:57.350 --> 05:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
true no it's not true and I'm going to
 
05:51:00.030 --> 05:51:00.040 align:start position:0%
grade based upon whether they say yes or
 
05:51:03.510 --> 05:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
no now you're pushing your opinion and
 
05:51:06.390 --> 05:51:06.400 align:start position:0%
that's indoctrination and I hope that's
 
05:51:08.510 --> 05:51:08.520 align:start position:0%
clear the difference between
 
05:51:08.520 --> 05:51:15.190 align:start position:0%
clear the difference between
those

05:51:15.190 --> 05:51:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:18.750 --> 05:51:18.760 align:start position:0%
um let me see what
 
05:51:21.788 --> 05:51:21.798 align:start position:0%
else oh administrators should not bring
 
05:51:23.750 --> 05:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
into teacher in service training outside
 
05:51:25.510 --> 05:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
sources nor require teachers to view
 
05:51:27.750 --> 05:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
material from outside sources with the
 
05:51:27.760 --> 05:51:29.628 align:start position:0%
material from outside sources with the
intent

05:51:29.628 --> 05:51:29.638 align:start position:0%
intent
 
05:51:31.830 --> 05:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
to push or assert advocate for otherwise
 
05:51:34.190 --> 05:51:34.200 align:start position:0%
compelled belief in any particular
 
05:51:36.110 --> 05:51:36.120 align:start position:0%
Theory or ideology now we've talked
 
05:51:38.788 --> 05:51:38.798 align:start position:0%
about how you know it's a theory or an
 
05:51:41.948 --> 05:51:41.958 align:start position:0%
ideology because you've got discrepancy
 
05:51:44.990 --> 05:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
in people from one side or another right
 
05:51:47.430 --> 05:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
so are you having somebody to come in to
 
05:51:50.708 --> 05:51:50.718 align:start position:0%
push a particular point of
 
05:51:54.708 --> 05:51:54.718 align:start position:0%
view or have you invited people from
 
05:51:57.270 --> 05:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
each side to come in and
 
05:52:00.070 --> 05:52:00.080 align:start position:0%
present and so that's where you get into
 
05:52:01.830 --> 05:52:01.840 align:start position:0%
trouble when a school district has
 
05:52:03.670 --> 05:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
decided but this is the way we want
 
05:52:06.030 --> 05:52:06.040 align:start position:0%
everybody to think and they bring in
 
05:52:09.430 --> 05:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
people to support that point of view and
 
05:52:09.440 --> 05:52:11.190 align:start position:0%
people to support that point of view and
in

05:52:11.190 --> 05:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:52:15.708 --> 05:52:15.718 align:start position:0%
fact even in the ACLU
 
05:52:15.718 --> 05:52:16.710 align:start position:0%
fact even in the ACLU
letter

05:52:16.710 --> 05:52:16.720 align:start position:0%
letter
 
05:52:16.720 --> 05:52:19.350 align:start position:0%
letter
[Music]

05:52:19.350 --> 05:52:19.360 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:52:23.788 --> 05:52:23.798 align:start position:0%
um it talks about classroom debate being
 
05:52:25.750 --> 05:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
between instructors or guest speakers
 
05:52:28.270 --> 05:52:28.280 align:start position:0%
who wish to promote the merits of their
 
05:52:30.990 --> 05:52:31.000 align:start position:0%
their position that's indoctrination
 
05:52:35.190 --> 05:52:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:37.830 --> 05:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
position if you want to do that you're
 
05:52:40.548 --> 05:52:40.558 align:start position:0%
going to have to bring in people from
 
05:52:43.910 --> 05:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
multiple points of view their position
 
05:52:46.270 --> 05:52:46.280 align:start position:0%
and whoever is representing a different
 
05:52:48.750 --> 05:52:48.760 align:start position:0%
position then you're not indoctrinating
 
05:52:50.830 --> 05:52:50.840 align:start position:0%
then you're presenting side you know
 
05:52:53.708 --> 05:52:53.718 align:start position:0%
presenting what the various theories are
 
05:52:56.230 --> 05:52:56.240 align:start position:0%
but as soon as you start deciding one
 
05:52:59.548 --> 05:52:59.558 align:start position:0%
Theory or one ideology over others then
 
05:53:04.230 --> 05:53:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:04.240 --> 05:53:10.350 align:start position:0%
 
informing

05:53:10.350 --> 05:53:10.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:13.030 --> 05:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
um nothing in this section shall be
 
05:53:14.948 --> 05:53:14.958 align:start position:0%
construed to prohibit discussing as part
 
05:53:16.510 --> 05:53:16.520 align:start position:0%
of a larger course of academic
 
05:53:20.270 --> 05:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
instruction the historical and current
 
05:53:23.070 --> 05:53:23.080 align:start position:0%
existence of various theories and
 
05:53:25.350 --> 05:53:25.360 align:start position:0%
ideologies and that's
 
05:53:28.670 --> 05:53:28.680 align:start position:0%
important to get both historical
 
05:53:33.030 --> 05:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
and current it's not it it that opens up
 
05:53:35.110 --> 05:53:35.120 align:start position:0%
discussion what's going on now how does
 
05:53:39.708 --> 05:53:39.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:42.070 --> 05:53:42.080 align:start position:0%
slavery back for quite a while in our
 
05:53:44.708 --> 05:53:44.718 align:start position:0%
country we still have slavery in our
 
05:53:47.670 --> 05:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
country it just looks different and so
 
05:53:50.030 --> 05:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
what is the historical significance of
 
05:53:52.910 --> 05:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
slavery what is the current significance
 
05:53:56.548 --> 05:53:56.558 align:start position:0%
of slavery how do we try to keep that
 
05:53:59.230 --> 05:53:59.240 align:start position:0%
from happening in the future
 
05:54:02.270 --> 05:54:02.280 align:start position:0%
that's all any of these ideologies any
 
05:54:04.670 --> 05:54:04.680 align:start position:0%
of these belief
 
05:54:08.708 --> 05:54:08.718 align:start position:0%
systems it's important to talk about to
 
05:54:14.670 --> 05:54:14.680 align:start position:0%
to present those um what they
 
05:54:18.868 --> 05:54:18.878 align:start position:0%
are and did they exist in the past do
 
05:54:27.070 --> 05:54:27.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:27.080 --> 05:54:30.110 align:start position:0%
 
see

05:54:30.110 --> 05:54:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:33.350 --> 05:54:33.360 align:start position:0%
so I would say that if any student other
 
05:54:35.628 --> 05:54:35.638 align:start position:0%
than through a lucky
 
05:54:39.190 --> 05:54:39.200 align:start position:0%
gas knows or can tell what a teacher's
 
05:54:41.750 --> 05:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
religious or political views or sexual
 
05:54:47.310 --> 05:54:47.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:50.150 --> 05:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
failed and I'm very open to
 
05:54:53.230 --> 05:54:53.240 align:start position:0%
questions uh thank you representive
 
05:54:55.510 --> 05:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
cascaden thank you Mr chair thank you
 
05:54:58.708 --> 05:54:58.718 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um
 
05:55:02.468 --> 05:55:02.478 align:start position:0%
my concern is um title of indoctrination
 
05:55:06.430 --> 05:55:06.440 align:start position:0%
gives a public perceptive P
 
05:55:09.548 --> 05:55:09.558 align:start position:0%
perspective that indoctrination is going
 
05:55:10.788 --> 05:55:10.798 align:start position:0%
on in public
 
05:55:15.030 --> 05:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
schools but I know that all teachers are
 
05:55:17.150 --> 05:55:17.160 align:start position:0%
bound to Professional Standards and the
 
05:55:19.110 --> 05:55:19.120 align:start position:0%
code of ethics and I know the code of
 
05:55:22.230 --> 05:55:22.240 align:start position:0%
conduct is mentioned here as well and
 
05:55:24.548 --> 05:55:24.558 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that you spoke to a lot of
 
05:55:26.990 --> 05:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
variety of people so my question is
 
05:55:27.000 --> 05:55:28.788 align:start position:0%
variety of people so my question is
twofold

05:55:28.788 --> 05:55:28.798 align:start position:0%
twofold
 
05:55:30.270 --> 05:55:30.280 align:start position:0%
have you spoken to public school
 
05:55:32.510 --> 05:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
Educators and administrators are public
 
05:55:32.520 --> 05:55:34.830 align:start position:0%
Educators and administrators are public
school

05:55:34.830 --> 05:55:34.840 align:start position:0%
school
 
05:55:37.910 --> 05:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
administrators uh contributing to
 
05:55:39.868 --> 05:55:39.878 align:start position:0%
indoctrination and can you give a
 
05:55:44.230 --> 05:55:44.240 align:start position:0%
specific example is what why this what
 
05:55:48.030 --> 05:55:48.040 align:start position:0%
drives this bill okay yes I have talked
 
05:55:53.070 --> 05:55:53.080 align:start position:0%
to teachers I have talked to um spouses
 
05:55:53.080 --> 05:55:54.230 align:start position:0%
to teachers I have talked to um spouses
of

05:55:54.230 --> 05:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:55:57.628 --> 05:55:57.638 align:start position:0%
teachers and something that I hear very
 
05:55:57.638 --> 05:55:59.150 align:start position:0%
teachers and something that I hear very
often

05:55:59.150 --> 05:55:59.160 align:start position:0%
often
 
05:56:01.430 --> 05:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
have heard multiple times from multiple
 
05:56:05.110 --> 05:56:05.120 align:start position:0%
places multiple school districts is that
 
05:56:09.430 --> 05:56:09.440 align:start position:0%
the administrators are pushing specific
 
05:56:12.190 --> 05:56:12.200 align:start position:0%
ideologies and telling the teachers that
 
05:56:14.788 --> 05:56:14.798 align:start position:0%
they have to teach them and the teachers
 
05:56:17.468 --> 05:56:17.478 align:start position:0%
don't want to but they're afraid to
 
05:56:20.390 --> 05:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
speak up I can't tell you any of their
 
05:56:25.230 --> 05:56:25.240 align:start position:0%
names because they're afraid of um
 
05:56:28.948 --> 05:56:28.958 align:start position:0%
retribution and but it is not it is
 
05:56:30.510 --> 05:56:30.520 align:start position:0%
oh I can't even tell you all the
 
05:56:33.270 --> 05:56:33.280 align:start position:0%
different towns I've heard this from and
 
05:56:36.030 --> 05:56:36.040 align:start position:0%
my husband has heard this from because
 
05:56:38.788 --> 05:56:38.798 align:start position:0%
if I'm here he often goes out places and
 
05:56:42.510 --> 05:56:42.520 align:start position:0%
he'll just set up con you know just chat
 
05:56:44.788 --> 05:56:44.798 align:start position:0%
with whoever is nearby right he might go
 
05:56:47.510 --> 05:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
out for lunch and sit at the bar and
 
05:56:49.110 --> 05:56:49.120 align:start position:0%
chat with whoever and he'll come home
 
05:56:51.510 --> 05:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
and tell me these stories that people
 
05:56:53.070 --> 05:56:53.080 align:start position:0%
have talked to him about it happened
 
05:56:57.230 --> 05:56:57.240 align:start position:0%
just last week in fact so that is a lot
 
05:56:59.628 --> 05:56:59.638 align:start position:0%
of what drives
 
05:57:02.430 --> 05:57:02.440 align:start position:0%
this that and closing and not wanting to
 
05:57:06.070 --> 05:57:06.080 align:start position:0%
close down um students ability to think
 
05:57:09.150 --> 05:57:09.160 align:start position:0%
for themselves representa
 
05:57:11.510 --> 05:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
Tanner thank you and thank you for
 
05:57:14.670 --> 05:57:14.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question can you give me a an
 
05:57:16.670 --> 05:57:16.680 align:start position:0%
ex kind of go into this a little bit
 
05:57:18.670 --> 05:57:18.680 align:start position:0%
deeper about this administrator that
 
05:57:21.548 --> 05:57:21.558 align:start position:0%
brings in specific ideology that uh
 
05:57:24.070 --> 05:57:24.080 align:start position:0%
teachers are forced to teach could you
 
05:57:27.350 --> 05:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
give me an example of that because I it
 
05:57:29.628 --> 05:57:29.638 align:start position:0%
it is in my realm of thought that that
 
05:57:33.990 --> 05:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
happens but Dei Dei is an
 
05:57:38.430 --> 05:57:38.440 align:start position:0%
ideology okay um some people very some
 
05:57:40.830 --> 05:57:40.840 align:start position:0%
people super support it because they
 
05:57:42.788 --> 05:57:42.798 align:start position:0%
believe it's inclusive and gets people
 
05:57:46.190 --> 05:57:46.200 align:start position:0%
to be inclusive other people very much
 
05:57:48.390 --> 05:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
think that it's a horrible thing it
 
05:57:50.150 --> 05:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
teaches people to be
 
05:57:55.110 --> 05:57:55.120 align:start position:0%
racist um I know some of my black
 
05:57:58.110 --> 05:57:58.120 align:start position:0%
friends who think it's insulting the
 
05:58:00.468 --> 05:58:00.478 align:start position:0%
idea that they need white people to help
 
05:58:02.150 --> 05:58:02.160 align:start position:0%
them to be able to do whatever they can
 
05:58:04.948 --> 05:58:04.958 align:start position:0%
do the idea that they can't do on their
 
05:58:06.788 --> 05:58:06.798 align:start position:0%
own but they need these people of
 
05:58:08.910 --> 05:58:08.920 align:start position:0%
privilege to help use their privilege
 
05:58:11.190 --> 05:58:11.200 align:start position:0%
for them to succeed when they believe
 
05:58:13.270 --> 05:58:13.280 align:start position:0%
that they're perfectly successful and
 
05:58:15.548 --> 05:58:15.558 align:start position:0%
able to be successful on their own and
 
05:58:17.468 --> 05:58:17.478 align:start position:0%
they get very upset by the fact that
 
05:58:21.070 --> 05:58:21.080 align:start position:0%
it's being taught so there are teachers
 
05:58:23.830 --> 05:58:23.840 align:start position:0%
where they have Dei Specialists come
 
05:58:26.670 --> 05:58:26.680 align:start position:0%
in for teacher training and tell them
 
05:58:28.868 --> 05:58:28.878 align:start position:0%
you have to incorporate at this
 
05:58:30.948 --> 05:58:30.958 align:start position:0%
throughout your day whatever you're
 
05:58:34.910 --> 05:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
doing so it's not curriculum so nobody
 
05:58:38.830 --> 05:58:38.840 align:start position:0%
can go and ask ahead of time is this
 
05:58:40.628 --> 05:58:40.638 align:start position:0%
being taught is this part of the
 
05:58:42.830 --> 05:58:42.840 align:start position:0%
curriculum because it's not it's
 
05:58:45.548 --> 05:58:45.558 align:start position:0%
supposed to be part of each part of the
 
05:58:47.110 --> 05:58:47.120 align:start position:0%
day what the teacher is supposed to
 
05:58:51.868 --> 05:58:51.878 align:start position:0%
include it whether it's math or gym or
 
05:58:54.510 --> 05:58:54.520 align:start position:0%
whatever it is and the teachers are like
 
05:58:57.070 --> 05:58:57.080 align:start position:0%
I don't believe in this I don't want to
 
05:59:00.230 --> 05:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
teach this yes I think it's racist I
 
05:59:02.670 --> 05:59:02.680 align:start position:0%
think it's harmful and I don't want to
 
05:59:07.190 --> 05:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
do it and so that would be an an
 
05:59:10.670 --> 05:59:10.680 align:start position:0%
example follow up sure um so you're
 
05:59:13.830 --> 05:59:13.840 align:start position:0%
talking about just so I'm perfectly
 
05:59:16.510 --> 05:59:16.520 align:start position:0%
clear on this tolerance for
 
05:59:18.910 --> 05:59:18.920 align:start position:0%
diversity equality of
 
05:59:23.190 --> 05:59:23.200 align:start position:0%
people and Justice in in that people are
 
05:59:25.548 --> 05:59:25.558 align:start position:0%
under Justice or under the law as the
 
05:59:28.788 --> 05:59:28.798 align:start position:0%
United States has it so those particular
 
05:59:30.670 --> 05:59:30.680 align:start position:0%
values you don't think should be taught
 
05:59:32.830 --> 05:59:32.840 align:start position:0%
in school that's not what I'm talking
 
05:59:34.990 --> 05:59:35.000 align:start position:0%
about I'm talking about the other parts
 
05:59:38.548 --> 05:59:38.558 align:start position:0%
of Dei the parts that teach that you are
 
05:59:41.070 --> 05:59:41.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely racist because you're white
 
05:59:42.590 --> 05:59:42.600 align:start position:0%
the part that says that you have
 
05:59:44.868 --> 05:59:44.878 align:start position:0%
privilege because you're white the part
 
05:59:47.830 --> 05:59:47.840 align:start position:0%
that says that you have to be an ally to
 
05:59:49.548 --> 05:59:49.558 align:start position:0%
people who aren't white so they can
 
05:59:52.590 --> 05:59:52.600 align:start position:0%
succeed because otherwise they can't
 
05:59:56.548 --> 05:59:56.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:59.830 --> 05:59:59.840 align:start position:0%
racist that's what people are objecting
 
06:00:02.948 --> 06:00:02.958 align:start position:0%
to further questions uh representative
 
06:00:05.590 --> 06:00:05.600 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you shair just a simple
 
06:00:08.110 --> 06:00:08.120 align:start position:0%
one and I I apologize for being loud on
 
06:00:10.670 --> 06:00:10.680 align:start position:0%
the outside missing the right Le I was
 
06:00:13.830 --> 06:00:13.840 align:start position:0%
still an R from the eclipse yeah um I'm
 
06:00:15.430 --> 06:00:15.440 align:start position:0%
looking at uh and if you may have
 
06:00:16.670 --> 06:00:16.680 align:start position:0%
already if you already covered this just
 
06:00:18.708 --> 06:00:18.718 align:start position:0%
tell me don't waste your time again uh
 
06:00:22.430 --> 06:00:22.440 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at line 11 and 12 of of uh
 
06:00:26.230 --> 06:00:26.240 align:start position:0%
your your bill your your bill and I'm
 
06:00:29.070 --> 06:00:29.080 align:start position:0%
thinking about my years as a uh social
 
06:00:32.390 --> 06:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
science teacher uh and I would this says
 
06:00:34.430 --> 06:00:34.440 align:start position:0%
you can't require a student compel a
 
06:00:38.030 --> 06:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
student I would often require students
 
06:00:41.270 --> 06:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
to to ab ab ab all you people going to
 
06:00:44.468 --> 06:00:44.478 align:start position:0%
speak and and we're debate 1 two 3 4 and
 
06:00:46.270 --> 06:00:46.280 align:start position:0%
you're going to speak on this in favor
 
06:00:48.230 --> 06:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
of that and you're going to speak on
 
06:00:51.670 --> 06:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
this against that so that we hav't doing
 
06:00:53.830 --> 06:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
the research and all things but that if
 
06:00:56.430 --> 06:00:56.440 align:start position:0%
I read this correctly that I as a
 
06:00:57.868 --> 06:00:57.878 align:start position:0%
teacher I would not be able to say that
 
06:00:59.830 --> 06:00:59.840 align:start position:0%
you are going to you are going to you're
 
06:01:02.310 --> 06:01:02.320 align:start position:0%
on side one one pick it out one you are
 
06:01:05.070 --> 06:01:05.080 align:start position:0%
against slavery uh side two you are for
 
06:01:07.430 --> 06:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
slavery and that you know you want to do
 
06:01:09.230 --> 06:01:09.240 align:start position:0%
and that's how we start the dialogue for
 
06:01:11.830 --> 06:01:11.840 align:start position:0%
instance on on a class and let make do
 
06:01:13.190 --> 06:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
the research you know for appropriately
 
06:01:15.430 --> 06:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
for the high squ basic debate techniques
 
06:01:17.708 --> 06:01:17.718 align:start position:0%
yes so or any subject but I mean but I'm
 
06:01:19.030 --> 06:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
now telling them yes that's the side
 
06:01:20.150 --> 06:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
you're going to be on and this what
 
06:01:21.910 --> 06:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
you're going to do so if I read this
 
06:01:24.868 --> 06:01:24.878 align:start position:0%
right I I can't do that I can't compel
 
06:01:26.910 --> 06:01:26.920 align:start position:0%
students to express belief of support of
 
06:01:27.990 --> 06:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
any particular
 
06:01:32.990 --> 06:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
you're not you're not asking them as
 
06:01:36.230 --> 06:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
themselves to believe in slavery or not
 
06:01:38.270 --> 06:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
believe in slavery you're asking them to
 
06:01:41.270 --> 06:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
present that position in a debate
 
06:01:43.948 --> 06:01:43.958 align:start position:0%
correct which is different than asking
 
06:01:47.190 --> 06:01:47.200 align:start position:0%
them for their belief in that
 
06:01:49.948 --> 06:01:49.958 align:start position:0%
thing well if there if there if I just I
 
06:01:51.548 --> 06:01:51.558 align:start position:0%
won't get into a dialogue with you if I
 
06:01:54.788 --> 06:01:54.798 align:start position:0%
may to further clarification or say in
 
06:01:57.990 --> 06:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
support of which is debate or in Le or
 
06:02:01.510 --> 06:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
support of so if I am on a a team of
 
06:02:03.948 --> 06:02:03.958 align:start position:0%
three of us supporting or not supporting
 
06:02:06.868 --> 06:02:06.878 align:start position:0%
a topic then we're going to be coming
 
06:02:08.310 --> 06:02:08.320 align:start position:0%
from the position yeah we support that
 
06:02:11.868 --> 06:02:11.878 align:start position:0%
this is why um so I I just that's all I
 
06:02:13.788 --> 06:02:13.798 align:start position:0%
just find it from I find it particularly
 
06:02:18.350 --> 06:02:18.360 align:start position:0%
as you uh get higher uh age youngsters
 
06:02:19.750 --> 06:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
and the high school particularly where
 
06:02:22.030 --> 06:02:22.040 align:start position:0%
kids Fredy shop and they would they have
 
06:02:23.430 --> 06:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
back training and they really want to
 
06:02:24.948 --> 06:02:24.958 align:start position:0%
get passionate about things and they'll
 
06:02:26.030 --> 06:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
whichever way you tell them to go they
 
06:02:28.548 --> 06:02:28.558 align:start position:0%
just want to debate um so I I find that
 
06:02:30.548 --> 06:02:30.558 align:start position:0%
maybe kind of I find other things here
 
06:02:31.390 --> 06:02:31.400 align:start position:0%
but that's particularly just so it
 
06:02:34.230 --> 06:02:34.240 align:start position:0%
jumped out at me having having having
 
06:02:39.750 --> 06:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
been part of a debate club that competed
 
06:02:42.708 --> 06:02:42.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:45.510 --> 06:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
nationally I see a difference between
 
06:02:49.070 --> 06:02:49.080 align:start position:0%
asking them in a debate to present a
 
06:02:49.080 --> 06:02:50.708 align:start position:0%
asking them in a debate to present a
certain

06:02:50.708 --> 06:02:50.718 align:start position:0%
certain
 
06:02:52.468 --> 06:02:52.478 align:start position:0%
side and
 
06:02:55.948 --> 06:02:55.958 align:start position:0%
then the opposite side even I mean as as
 
06:02:57.830 --> 06:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
a debate team you have to willing
 
06:02:59.190 --> 06:02:59.200 align:start position:0%
because you don't know which side you're
 
06:03:01.350 --> 06:03:01.360 align:start position:0%
going to get at any point in time you
 
06:03:03.948 --> 06:03:03.958 align:start position:0%
have to be able to present both but
 
06:03:06.868 --> 06:03:06.878 align:start position:0%
that's different than asking them to
 
06:03:10.350 --> 06:03:10.360 align:start position:0%
believe in that actually asking that
 
06:03:12.990 --> 06:03:13.000 align:start position:0%
trying to convince them that your side
 
06:03:16.230 --> 06:03:16.240 align:start position:0%
is correct or your ideology is correct
 
06:03:18.830 --> 06:03:18.840 align:start position:0%
to get them to believe okay I got it
 
06:03:20.788 --> 06:03:20.798 align:start position:0%
thank you you got it that's okay thank
 
06:03:22.110 --> 06:03:22.120 align:start position:0%
you agree with thank you uh
 
06:03:22.120 --> 06:03:23.150 align:start position:0%
you agree with thank you uh
representative

06:03:23.150 --> 06:03:23.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:03:25.350 --> 06:03:25.360 align:start position:0%
Hall thank you Mr chair thank you
 
06:03:27.310 --> 06:03:27.320 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question so
 
06:03:28.628 --> 06:03:28.638 align:start position:0%
lines 1 to
 
06:03:31.030 --> 06:03:31.040 align:start position:0%
24 really I think teachers and
 
06:03:32.948 --> 06:03:32.958 align:start position:0%
administrators are the bad guys they're
 
06:03:35.468 --> 06:03:35.478 align:start position:0%
the ones that are doing the the
 
06:03:39.430 --> 06:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
indoctrination okay so lines 25 and 26
 
06:03:41.868 --> 06:03:41.878 align:start position:0%
my question is how is that going to be
 
06:03:44.190 --> 06:03:44.200 align:start position:0%
enforced is that up to students and
 
06:03:47.510 --> 06:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
parents to report out who's who's
 
06:03:50.708 --> 06:03:50.718 align:start position:0%
enforcing 25 and 26 is my question first
 
06:03:53.270 --> 06:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
off I'm not saying anybody is bad guys
 
06:03:55.510 --> 06:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
and there are plenty of teachers who
 
06:03:58.788 --> 06:03:58.798 align:start position:0%
teach very well without
 
06:04:01.708 --> 06:04:01.718 align:start position:0%
indoctrinating okay so I don't want to
 
06:04:05.830 --> 06:04:05.840 align:start position:0%
imply there that that you can't teach or
 
06:04:09.070 --> 06:04:09.080 align:start position:0%
there aren't teachers that you
 
06:04:11.868 --> 06:04:11.878 align:start position:0%
you that there are teachers that all
 
06:04:13.990 --> 06:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
teachers indoctrinate I don't want to
 
06:04:16.548 --> 06:04:16.558 align:start position:0%
apply that at all I just am trying to
 
06:04:19.948 --> 06:04:19.958 align:start position:0%
make sure that where it's happening it
 
06:04:22.390 --> 06:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
steps back and who is going to bring It
 
06:04:25.548 --> 06:04:25.558 align:start position:0%
Forward it could be another teacher it
 
06:04:27.670 --> 06:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
could be the school administrator who
 
06:04:29.830 --> 06:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
happens to notice it when they're
 
06:04:32.230 --> 06:04:32.240 align:start position:0%
walking past and hears what's going on
 
06:04:34.468 --> 06:04:34.478 align:start position:0%
it could be the students it could be the
 
06:04:36.708 --> 06:04:36.718 align:start position:0%
teachers I mean the parents who the
 
06:04:39.270 --> 06:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
student has complained to it would then
 
06:04:41.468 --> 06:04:41.478 align:start position:0%
be it would have to be investigated
 
06:04:44.270 --> 06:04:44.280 align:start position:0%
right you're not going to just assume I
 
06:04:47.590 --> 06:04:47.600 align:start position:0%
mean when when when anything else comes
 
06:04:50.468 --> 06:04:50.478 align:start position:0%
up to find out whether somebody violates
 
06:04:51.990 --> 06:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire code of conduct
 
06:04:54.430 --> 06:04:54.440 align:start position:0%
there's a whole investigation and that
 
06:04:57.230 --> 06:04:57.240 align:start position:0%
would still be the whole investigation
 
06:04:59.868 --> 06:04:59.878 align:start position:0%
and I would hope you would start
 
06:05:03.390 --> 06:05:03.400 align:start position:0%
with if that investigation is done and
 
06:05:05.750 --> 06:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
somebody has found that yes they were
 
06:05:07.270 --> 06:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
indoctrinating that they would there
 
06:05:09.948 --> 06:05:09.958 align:start position:0%
would be a conversation that says this
 
06:05:11.788 --> 06:05:11.798 align:start position:0%
is the difference this is how you would
 
06:05:14.190 --> 06:05:14.200 align:start position:0%
do this without indoctrinating as
 
06:05:17.310 --> 06:05:17.320 align:start position:0%
opposed to with indoctrinating right not
 
06:05:20.350 --> 06:05:20.360 align:start position:0%
Hitler is bad but these are the things
 
06:05:22.190 --> 06:05:22.200 align:start position:0%
that Hitler
 
06:05:25.708 --> 06:05:25.718 align:start position:0%
did thank you and and well at any rate
 
06:05:27.990 --> 06:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
and if you continueed to do that that
 
06:05:30.310 --> 06:05:30.320 align:start position:0%
might escalate along there can I follow
 
06:05:32.628 --> 06:05:32.638 align:start position:0%
up can I just follow quickly very
 
06:05:34.310 --> 06:05:34.320 align:start position:0%
quickly yeah I I wasn't suggesting that
 
06:05:35.548 --> 06:05:35.558 align:start position:0%
you would think every teacher was
 
06:05:37.468 --> 06:05:37.478 align:start position:0%
indoctrinating or every administrator
 
06:05:40.430 --> 06:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
but when when you when clearly it said
 
06:05:42.590 --> 06:05:42.600 align:start position:0%
the administrator you know they do the
 
06:05:45.270 --> 06:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
does the work up who reports that so
 
06:05:47.190 --> 06:05:47.200 align:start position:0%
that I I definitely didn't think you
 
06:05:49.070 --> 06:05:49.080 align:start position:0%
thought every single teacher and every
 
06:05:51.390 --> 06:05:51.400 align:start position:0%
administrator in this thank you uh
 
06:05:51.400 --> 06:05:54.670 align:start position:0%
administrator in this thank you uh
representative

06:05:54.670 --> 06:05:54.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:58.270 --> 06:05:58.280 align:start position:0%
Ford your mic
 
06:06:00.110 --> 06:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
I was wondering as you were talking
 
06:06:02.310 --> 06:06:02.320 align:start position:0%
about the circumstances of people who
 
06:06:05.430 --> 06:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
teach in schools with religious
 
06:06:08.190 --> 06:06:08.200 align:start position:0%
affiliations and the predicaments they
 
06:06:12.390 --> 06:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
get in when the so-called authorities on
 
06:06:15.070 --> 06:06:15.080 align:start position:0%
either side of an argument
 
06:06:19.390 --> 06:06:19.400 align:start position:0%
differ uh a good example is um in the
 
06:06:21.468 --> 06:06:21.478 align:start position:0%
beginning was the word and the Word was
 
06:06:24.230 --> 06:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
God straight from the Bible and yet a
 
06:06:27.230 --> 06:06:27.240 align:start position:0%
geology teacher says in the beginning
 
06:06:29.230 --> 06:06:29.240 align:start position:0%
was the Precambrian all that stuff we
 
06:06:32.150 --> 06:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
don't know about and then it began with
 
06:06:36.468 --> 06:06:36.478 align:start position:0%
the oriv visan curan devonian plyo scine
 
06:06:39.510 --> 06:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
that's the Ice Age and then someone says
 
06:06:41.510 --> 06:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
well how do we know that happened
 
06:06:44.910 --> 06:06:44.920 align:start position:0%
because we found a human being frozen in
 
06:06:44.920 --> 06:06:46.270 align:start position:0%
because we found a human being frozen in
a

06:06:46.270 --> 06:06:46.280 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:06:46.280 --> 06:06:47.868 align:start position:0%
a
glazier

06:06:47.868 --> 06:06:47.878 align:start position:0%
glazier
 
06:06:52.468 --> 06:06:52.478 align:start position:0%
fact we got one they live then well what
 
06:06:54.750 --> 06:06:54.760 align:start position:0%
about before then some of that we don't
 
06:06:57.788 --> 06:06:57.798 align:start position:0%
know and so you then start to say there
 
06:07:00.990 --> 06:07:01.000 align:start position:0%
are different calendars don't you and
 
06:07:04.548 --> 06:07:04.558 align:start position:0%
that calendars are a construct a way of
 
06:07:08.030 --> 06:07:08.040 align:start position:0%
cutting time into pieces but in fact
 
06:07:11.708 --> 06:07:11.718 align:start position:0%
they're virtually all arbitrary AR not
 
06:07:14.270 --> 06:07:14.280 align:start position:0%
capricious but arbitrary there you're
 
06:07:16.788 --> 06:07:16.798 align:start position:0%
choosing to look at time in this way or
 
06:07:18.948 --> 06:07:18.958 align:start position:0%
in these Cuts or in these slps excuse me
 
06:07:20.628 --> 06:07:20.638 align:start position:0%
represent do you have a question for
 
06:07:22.910 --> 06:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
well the question is how does that fit
 
06:07:27.628 --> 06:07:27.638 align:start position:0%
into your argument about selective
 
06:07:31.788 --> 06:07:31.798 align:start position:0%
factual Etc well those it when remember
 
06:07:34.190 --> 06:07:34.200 align:start position:0%
when I said if you have people with
 
06:07:38.590 --> 06:07:38.600 align:start position:0%
different ideas of that it's not facts
 
06:07:41.230 --> 06:07:41.240 align:start position:0%
it's ideology and so then you would
 
06:07:43.910 --> 06:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
present it that way there are people who
 
06:07:46.750 --> 06:07:46.760 align:start position:0%
believe that time that the world started
 
06:07:49.708 --> 06:07:49.718 align:start position:0%
at this time and time was divided up
 
06:07:52.070 --> 06:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
this way and Etc there are people who
 
06:07:56.230 --> 06:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
believe that looking at time according
 
06:07:58.390 --> 06:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
to the theory of
 
06:08:00.628 --> 06:08:00.638 align:start position:0%
relativity that actually things were
 
06:08:03.030 --> 06:08:03.040 align:start position:0%
moving much faster in the beginning and
 
06:08:05.270 --> 06:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
that really all of that large time
 
06:08:08.110 --> 06:08:08.120 align:start position:0%
period really was just one day from our
 
06:08:11.830 --> 06:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
time period Etc and you would
 
06:08:14.830 --> 06:08:14.840 align:start position:0%
present and allow your students to
 
06:08:18.708 --> 06:08:18.718 align:start position:0%
present the different ideas
 
06:08:22.030 --> 06:08:22.040 align:start position:0%
as different belief systems different
 
06:08:24.990 --> 06:08:25.000 align:start position:0%
ideologies the trick is not to come down
 
06:08:28.230 --> 06:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
on one
 
06:08:30.030 --> 06:08:30.040 align:start position:0%
right to leave it
 
06:08:32.548 --> 06:08:32.558 align:start position:0%
open thank you any further questions for
 
06:08:35.030 --> 06:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
the representative representative
 
06:08:37.150 --> 06:08:37.160 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
06:08:38.350 --> 06:08:38.360 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
06:08:41.830 --> 06:08:41.840 align:start position:0%
question so I have two examples that I
 
06:08:45.190 --> 06:08:45.200 align:start position:0%
would like you to comment
 
06:08:50.670 --> 06:08:50.680 align:start position:0%
on one would be a civics or possibly
 
06:08:53.830 --> 06:08:53.840 align:start position:0%
history teacher invites an elected
 
06:08:57.190 --> 06:08:57.200 align:start position:0%
official who has a party affiliation to
 
06:09:00.150 --> 06:09:00.160 align:start position:0%
be a guest speaker actually in back up
 
06:09:03.110 --> 06:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
they invite all the elected officials
 
06:09:04.830 --> 06:09:04.840 align:start position:0%
say all the state Reps for a particular
 
06:09:07.830 --> 06:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
District to come in
 
06:09:10.948 --> 06:09:10.958 align:start position:0%
its not everyone
 
06:09:14.628 --> 06:09:14.638 align:start position:0%
accepts and in fact only one party is
 
06:09:18.628 --> 06:09:18.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:22.910 --> 06:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
speak is that teacher expected
 
06:09:25.830 --> 06:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
to not acknowledge that person's party
 
06:09:25.840 --> 06:09:28.510 align:start position:0%
to not acknowledge that person's party
affiliation

06:09:28.510 --> 06:09:28.520 align:start position:0%
affiliation
 
06:09:31.590 --> 06:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
to require that
 
06:09:34.390 --> 06:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
speaker to Endeavor to be completely
 
06:09:36.948 --> 06:09:36.958 align:start position:0%
non-partisan while presumably the point
 
06:09:39.070 --> 06:09:39.080 align:start position:0%
I should have said is to share some
 
06:09:40.910 --> 06:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
perspective about the way government
 
06:09:40.920 --> 06:09:42.830 align:start position:0%
perspective about the way government
process

06:09:42.830 --> 06:09:42.840 align:start position:0%
process
 
06:09:46.070 --> 06:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
happens so that's one example and then I
 
06:09:48.548 --> 06:09:48.558 align:start position:0%
would like to ask the other one okay
 
06:09:52.548 --> 06:09:52.558 align:start position:0%
well I've certainly been um invited to
 
06:09:55.350 --> 06:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
such classes and the teacher made a
 
06:10:01.150 --> 06:10:01.160 align:start position:0%
point of of inviting both sides and
 
06:10:04.670 --> 06:10:04.680 align:start position:0%
um we've done that more than once and
 
06:10:06.948 --> 06:10:06.958 align:start position:0%
one time yes we were the only ones that
 
06:10:09.070 --> 06:10:09.080 align:start position:0%
showed up that was not the fault of the
 
06:10:12.270 --> 06:10:12.280 align:start position:0%
teacher that was for whatever reason
 
06:10:15.468 --> 06:10:15.478 align:start position:0%
nobody else showed up and so when we
 
06:10:18.510 --> 06:10:18.520 align:start position:0%
presented things we presented it as our
 
06:10:22.670 --> 06:10:22.680 align:start position:0%
opinion not as fact but as this is what
 
06:10:27.070 --> 06:10:27.080 align:start position:0%
we believe and so again the the teacher
 
06:10:29.350 --> 06:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
has done her best and she can explain
 
06:10:31.948 --> 06:10:31.958 align:start position:0%
that there is another side those people
 
06:10:35.750 --> 06:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
weren't able to come but um she's still
 
06:10:38.230 --> 06:10:38.240 align:start position:0%
trying to say there are vult multiple
 
06:10:41.310 --> 06:10:41.320 align:start position:0%
sides and we presented our side as our
 
06:10:44.390 --> 06:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
side not as fact did you have another
 
06:10:50.030 --> 06:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
quick uh yes thank you um so when my
 
06:10:51.628 --> 06:10:51.638 align:start position:0%
daughters were in high school a
 
06:10:53.990 --> 06:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
philosophy teacher at the school at the
 
06:10:58.670 --> 06:10:58.680 align:start position:0%
time still today um um would invite
 
06:11:00.628 --> 06:11:00.638 align:start position:0%
different guest speakers to come in and
 
06:11:03.750 --> 06:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
talk about their Rel religious system or
 
06:11:03.760 --> 06:11:05.390 align:start position:0%
talk about their Rel religious system or
lack

06:11:05.390 --> 06:11:05.400 align:start position:0%
lack
 
06:11:08.948 --> 06:11:08.958 align:start position:0%
thereof and one of the speakers was an
 
06:11:12.110 --> 06:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
atheist um I think this teacher
 
06:11:14.270 --> 06:11:14.280 align:start position:0%
particularly invited that person to
 
06:11:16.150 --> 06:11:16.160 align:start position:0%
speak to make sure that these students
 
06:11:18.230 --> 06:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
were aware of
 
06:11:22.910 --> 06:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
that belief system or lack of belief
 
06:11:22.920 --> 06:11:25.548 align:start position:0%
that belief system or lack of belief
system

06:11:25.548 --> 06:11:25.558 align:start position:0%
system
 
06:11:28.190 --> 06:11:28.200 align:start position:0%
um I don't think practically speaking
 
06:11:31.948 --> 06:11:31.958 align:start position:0%
that you could expect in the time frame
 
06:11:35.150 --> 06:11:35.160 align:start position:0%
of our school day in the massive stuff
 
06:11:38.468 --> 06:11:38.478 align:start position:0%
we expect to happen that a teacher would
 
06:11:41.310 --> 06:11:41.320 align:start position:0%
be able to represent every religion so
 
06:11:44.030 --> 06:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
how do you respond to that well when a
 
06:11:46.510 --> 06:11:46.520 align:start position:0%
teacher is presumably the teacher was
 
06:11:48.510 --> 06:11:48.520 align:start position:0%
teaching about comparative religions
 
06:11:51.270 --> 06:11:51.280 align:start position:0%
right okay so the
 
06:11:54.270 --> 06:11:54.280 align:start position:0%
teacher for one thing when the teacher
 
06:11:56.628 --> 06:11:56.638 align:start position:0%
is done doing that the students should
 
06:11:58.670 --> 06:11:58.680 align:start position:0%
not be able to guess what religion that
 
06:11:58.680 --> 06:12:00.030 align:start position:0%
not be able to guess what religion that
teacher

06:12:00.030 --> 06:12:00.040 align:start position:0%
teacher
 
06:12:03.910 --> 06:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
had okay so that that's sort of a clue
 
06:12:06.468 --> 06:12:06.478 align:start position:0%
to tell you whether or not they were
 
06:12:10.270 --> 06:12:10.280 align:start position:0%
successful in teach in showing things
 
06:12:12.750 --> 06:12:12.760 align:start position:0%
objectively is if none of the students
 
06:12:15.430 --> 06:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
could even tell after the end of
 
06:12:17.350 --> 06:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
teaching all of those
 
06:12:20.510 --> 06:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
things which the teacher itself her his
 
06:12:24.990 --> 06:12:25.000 align:start position:0%
or herself believed then they were
 
06:12:29.190 --> 06:12:29.200 align:start position:0%
successful yeah I um sorry but yes you
 
06:12:31.868 --> 06:12:31.878 align:start position:0%
don't always have time to do all I know
 
06:12:33.670 --> 06:12:33.680 align:start position:0%
when we did that when I was in school we
 
06:12:35.830 --> 06:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
were each asked to pick a religion and
 
06:12:38.590 --> 06:12:38.600 align:start position:0%
we as students presented them and that
 
06:12:38.600 --> 06:12:39.868 align:start position:0%
we as students presented them and that
avoided

06:12:39.868 --> 06:12:39.878 align:start position:0%
avoided
 
06:12:42.230 --> 06:12:42.240 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
06:12:44.270 --> 06:12:44.280 align:start position:0%
conflict quickly please we have three
 
06:12:48.270 --> 06:12:48.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:50.390 --> 06:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
so I guess I'd like further
 
06:12:53.708 --> 06:12:53.718 align:start position:0%
clarification on how in our small rural
 
06:12:56.070 --> 06:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
communities where a teacher is a person
 
06:12:57.510 --> 06:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
who lives in the
 
06:13:01.990 --> 06:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
community and in my last example May
 
06:13:05.390 --> 06:13:05.400 align:start position:0%
attend a particular church or synagogue
 
06:13:07.788 --> 06:13:07.798 align:start position:0%
that their students
 
06:13:10.070 --> 06:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
attend okay the teacher may not be
 
06:13:12.270 --> 06:13:12.280 align:start position:0%
talking about that in the classroom per
 
06:13:15.750 --> 06:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
your um
 
06:13:18.110 --> 06:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
approach but I think it's completely
 
06:13:21.670 --> 06:13:21.680 align:start position:0%
unfeasible that students won't have any
 
06:13:23.910 --> 06:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
idea um do you
 
06:13:26.310 --> 06:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
agree yes if it's a small community
 
06:13:27.990 --> 06:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
community and some of the kids go to
 
06:13:29.830 --> 06:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
church with the teacher yes they're
 
06:13:31.390 --> 06:13:31.400 align:start position:0%
they're going to know but it's not going
 
06:13:33.430 --> 06:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
to come from what they presented in
 
06:13:35.868 --> 06:13:35.878 align:start position:0%
school it's going to come from outside
 
06:13:37.030 --> 06:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
any further
 
06:13:39.548 --> 06:13:39.558 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank you very much
 
06:13:43.270 --> 06:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
for presenting your legislation and next
 
06:13:47.270 --> 06:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:51.868 --> 06:13:51.878 align:start position:0%
Tuttle she had to leave okay like I can
 
06:13:53.750 --> 06:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
leave our testimony that'd be great
 
06:13:57.270 --> 06:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
thank you and I can uh Briefly summarize
 
06:13:59.590 --> 06:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
it okay if you want to then present a
 
06:14:02.548 --> 06:14:02.558 align:start position:0%
card um but um a quickly summary because
 
06:14:05.270 --> 06:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
we can get copies made yes I will make
 
06:14:06.948 --> 06:14:06.958 align:start position:0%
it very quick and fill out a card thank
 
06:14:09.350 --> 06:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman members of the committee
 
06:14:11.750 --> 06:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
for the record Brian Hawkins filling in
 
06:14:15.868 --> 06:14:15.878 align:start position:0%
for Megan tutle today um uh a couple of
 
06:14:18.670 --> 06:14:18.680 align:start position:0%
points I just wanted to make is uh first
 
06:14:21.990 --> 06:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
um we feel that uh this bill is follows
 
06:14:24.350 --> 06:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
a similar formula to bills that we've
 
06:14:27.190 --> 06:14:27.200 align:start position:0%
seen um in previous previous
 
06:14:31.468 --> 06:14:31.478 align:start position:0%
years uh basically that the uh language
 
06:14:36.788 --> 06:14:36.798 align:start position:0%
of the bill is extremely vague um and it
 
06:14:39.030 --> 06:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
leaves uh educator it will leave
 
06:14:41.590 --> 06:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
Educators wondering how to interpret
 
06:14:43.670 --> 06:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
this uh
 
06:14:46.590 --> 06:14:46.600 align:start position:0%
language um and then it is followed up
 
06:14:49.350 --> 06:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
by uh a potentially very stiff
 
06:14:52.150 --> 06:14:52.160 align:start position:0%
consequence for that educator which is
 
06:14:53.948 --> 06:14:53.958 align:start position:0%
uh a violation of the coda conduct which
 
06:14:56.788 --> 06:14:56.798 align:start position:0%
can as this committee knows can lead
 
06:15:00.190 --> 06:15:00.200 align:start position:0%
to uh an educator losing uh potentially
 
06:15:02.868 --> 06:15:02.878 align:start position:0%
losing their license
 
06:15:06.430 --> 06:15:06.440 align:start position:0%
um the standards in the bill are as I
 
06:15:10.830 --> 06:15:10.840 align:start position:0%
said vague um for for example uh the
 
06:15:12.430 --> 06:15:12.440 align:start position:0%
educator shall not present unproved
 
06:15:15.548 --> 06:15:15.558 align:start position:0%
theories as fact and not push or assert
 
06:15:17.350 --> 06:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
or Advocate or compel students to
 
06:15:20.390 --> 06:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
express belief in support for any
 
06:15:24.590 --> 06:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
particular Theory or IDE ideology um so
 
06:15:26.510 --> 06:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
where does this leave disc discussing
 
06:15:29.230 --> 06:15:29.240 align:start position:0%
all sorts of uh scientific sociological
 
06:15:32.628 --> 06:15:32.638 align:start position:0%
historical theories or ideas in class
 
06:15:36.990 --> 06:15:37.000 align:start position:0%
and where is uh the line between
 
06:15:40.468 --> 06:15:40.478 align:start position:0%
classroom discussion debate and the term
 
06:15:43.310 --> 06:15:43.320 align:start position:0%
push or assert uh what's the standard
 
06:15:46.510 --> 06:15:46.520 align:start position:0%
for an unproved Theory um this is
 
06:15:50.070 --> 06:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
unclear um you know this is the type of
 
06:15:53.190 --> 06:15:53.200 align:start position:0%
legislation that I think uh we heard
 
06:15:55.110 --> 06:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
testimony and the teacher shortage
 
06:15:57.110 --> 06:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
committee over the course of the last
 
06:15:59.788 --> 06:15:59.798 align:start position:0%
couple of years and in that report they
 
06:16:03.030 --> 06:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
said that uh that was issued not uh just
 
06:16:05.030 --> 06:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
two months ago classroom teachers are
 
06:16:06.548 --> 06:16:06.558 align:start position:0%
feeling and Reporting stress and
 
06:16:08.910 --> 06:16:08.920 align:start position:0%
concerns for the consequence as a result
 
06:16:10.750 --> 06:16:10.760 align:start position:0%
of the legislation proposed and passed
 
06:16:12.788 --> 06:16:12.798 align:start position:0%
in our state house and leaving the
 
06:16:14.270 --> 06:16:14.280 align:start position:0%
profession teachers leaving the
 
06:16:16.310 --> 06:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
profession most often cite the climate
 
06:16:18.110 --> 06:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
and culture as the biggest factor in
 
06:16:19.910 --> 06:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
their departure from
 
06:16:22.030 --> 06:16:22.040 align:start position:0%
education uh and New Hampshire
 
06:16:25.190 --> 06:16:25.200 align:start position:0%
altogether and so we believe 1206 would
 
06:16:27.230 --> 06:16:27.240 align:start position:0%
be an extension of that I'll close my
 
06:16:29.390 --> 06:16:29.400 align:start position:0%
testimony and give the uh hand in the
 
06:16:31.670 --> 06:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
written testimony very
 
06:16:34.270 --> 06:16:34.280 align:start position:0%
much um yeah you can just hand it to the
 
06:16:37.270 --> 06:16:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:40.030 --> 06:16:40.040 align:start position:0%
end also happens to be a
 
06:16:54.990 --> 06:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:55.000 --> 06:17:01.350 align:start position:0%
 
house

06:17:01.350 --> 06:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:02.670 --> 06:17:02.680 align:start position:0%
did I just turn this yes want to make
 
06:17:05.110 --> 06:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
sure I turned it on not back off okay my
 
06:17:06.948 --> 06:17:06.958 align:start position:0%
name is Deborah how I am president of
 
06:17:08.590 --> 06:17:08.600 align:start position:0%
the American Federation teachers New
 
06:17:11.070 --> 06:17:11.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and uh I am here on behalf of
 
06:17:15.150 --> 06:17:15.160 align:start position:0%
our members to speak in opposition of
 
06:17:20.150 --> 06:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
hb26 um you know I I do take the um
 
06:17:22.510 --> 06:17:22.520 align:start position:0%
maker of the bill at her word that she
 
06:17:25.430 --> 06:17:25.440 align:start position:0%
did not intend to imply that there is a
 
06:17:27.468 --> 06:17:27.478 align:start position:0%
problem with Educators indoctrinating in
 
06:17:29.670 --> 06:17:29.680 align:start position:0%
this state but certainly reading the
 
06:17:31.390 --> 06:17:31.400 align:start position:0%
text of the bill and the title of the
 
06:17:33.390 --> 06:17:33.400 align:start position:0%
bill it makes it sound like there's such
 
06:17:35.110 --> 06:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
a problem with Educators and
 
06:17:37.468 --> 06:17:37.478 align:start position:0%
administrators indoctrinating students
 
06:17:39.510 --> 06:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
that you have to pass a law against it
 
06:17:41.110 --> 06:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
and we've got a problem with that it is
 
06:17:42.788 --> 06:17:42.798 align:start position:0%
offensive to all those people who are
 
06:17:46.150 --> 06:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
working so hard every day to educate our
 
06:17:48.468 --> 06:17:48.478 align:start position:0%
students uh they do this because they
 
06:17:49.948 --> 06:17:49.958 align:start position:0%
care about students they want them to
 
06:17:52.750 --> 06:17:52.760 align:start position:0%
learn grow and Thrive and it spills like
 
06:17:55.070 --> 06:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
this as the previous speaker mentioned
 
06:17:56.750 --> 06:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
that are part of what is to driving
 
06:17:59.708 --> 06:17:59.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:02.868 --> 06:18:02.878 align:start position:0%
profession in our schools which I I
 
06:18:04.430 --> 06:18:04.440 align:start position:0%
would hope that the maker of the bill
 
06:18:05.948 --> 06:18:05.958 align:start position:0%
will get more informed about what goes
 
06:18:08.110 --> 06:18:08.120 align:start position:0%
on in our Public Schools but in social
 
06:18:09.548 --> 06:18:09.558 align:start position:0%
studies and science we do a lot with the
 
06:18:11.468 --> 06:18:11.478 align:start position:0%
inquiry method where we work hard to
 
06:18:14.548 --> 06:18:14.558 align:start position:0%
make sure students have access to
 
06:18:18.030 --> 06:18:18.040 align:start position:0%
primary documents and learn how to do
 
06:18:19.750 --> 06:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
research so they can indeed form their
 
06:18:22.150 --> 06:18:22.160 align:start position:0%
own opinions we are not teaching them
 
06:18:23.548 --> 06:18:23.558 align:start position:0%
what to think but we're teaching them
 
06:18:25.510 --> 06:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
how to find the information so they can
 
06:18:26.708 --> 06:18:26.718 align:start position:0%
draw their own conclusions we're
 
06:18:28.110 --> 06:18:28.120 align:start position:0%
teaching them how to observe how to
 
06:18:30.708 --> 06:18:30.718 align:start position:0%
collect data how to put things together
 
06:18:33.628 --> 06:18:33.638 align:start position:0%
so that they can um piece it together
 
06:18:37.548 --> 06:18:37.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:39.468 --> 06:18:39.478 align:start position:0%
conclusions this bill is based on
 
06:18:41.468 --> 06:18:41.478 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding or misrepresentation
 
06:18:42.868 --> 06:18:42.878 align:start position:0%
misrepresentation of what we do in
 
06:18:44.430 --> 06:18:44.440 align:start position:0%
public schools it creates yet another
 
06:18:46.990 --> 06:18:47.000 align:start position:0%
vague and IL defined standard which will
 
06:18:48.310 --> 06:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
interfere in the Public School
 
06:18:49.708 --> 06:18:49.718 align:start position:0%
classrooms and keep students from
 
06:18:51.788 --> 06:18:51.798 align:start position:0%
getting the robust education there's
 
06:18:53.430 --> 06:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
their constitutional right in New
 
06:18:55.910 --> 06:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire simply put this is another
 
06:18:57.788 --> 06:18:57.798 align:start position:0%
classroom censorship Bill the effect
 
06:18:59.350 --> 06:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
will be to make our Public Schools less
 
06:19:01.350 --> 06:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
welcoming to all students in our
 
06:19:03.628 --> 06:19:03.638 align:start position:0%
communities how do we know this we've
 
06:19:05.430 --> 06:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
seen what happened after the divisive
 
06:19:07.350 --> 06:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
Concepts law
 
06:19:10.070 --> 06:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
passed we've seen the effect of the simp
 
06:19:12.310 --> 06:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
similarly vague divisive Concepts law
 
06:19:14.150 --> 06:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
which failed to Define its vague terms
 
06:19:15.750 --> 06:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
and also threaten teachers and School
 
06:19:17.708 --> 06:19:17.718 align:start position:0%
staff with the possible loss of license
 
06:19:19.910 --> 06:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
if they violated them since that law
 
06:19:22.270 --> 06:19:22.280 align:start position:0%
took effect we have also seen some
 
06:19:24.548 --> 06:19:24.558 align:start position:0%
extremists insist that any recogn
 
06:19:27.830 --> 06:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
recognition of students who are lgbtq or
 
06:19:29.390 --> 06:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
of a family structure that consists of
 
06:19:31.948 --> 06:19:31.958 align:start position:0%
two moms or two dads any such
 
06:19:34.230 --> 06:19:34.240 align:start position:0%
recognition is considered gender
 
06:19:36.230 --> 06:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
Ideology Now would that be considered an
 
06:19:37.750 --> 06:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
ideology under this bill and would that
 
06:19:39.190 --> 06:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
be something we can no longer mention or
 
06:19:40.910 --> 06:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
read a story book where someone has two
 
06:19:42.230 --> 06:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
moms or two
 
06:19:44.430 --> 06:19:44.440 align:start position:0%
dads we don't want to see that happen in
 
06:19:46.510 --> 06:19:46.520 align:start position:0%
our schools all of our kids deserve to
 
06:19:49.948 --> 06:19:49.958 align:start position:0%
feel included being welcoming and kind
 
06:19:51.590 --> 06:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
to all of our students and making sure
 
06:19:53.788 --> 06:19:53.798 align:start position:0%
they feel welcome in our classrooms is
 
06:19:56.030 --> 06:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
not an ideology it's just being Being
 
06:19:58.670 --> 06:19:58.680 align:start position:0%
Human don't take the humanity out of our
 
06:20:02.230 --> 06:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
public schools let us teach our kids the
 
06:20:04.070 --> 06:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
bottom line is that every Granite State
 
06:20:06.070 --> 06:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
student has a constitutional right to a
 
06:20:08.430 --> 06:20:08.440 align:start position:0%
robust public education and the state of
 
06:20:10.910 --> 06:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has an obligation to its
 
06:20:14.150 --> 06:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:17.030 --> 06:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
it putting laws like this in the way of
 
06:20:18.468 --> 06:20:18.478 align:start position:0%
students being able to feel that they
 
06:20:20.390 --> 06:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
are welcome and belong like they are
 
06:20:21.750 --> 06:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
full members of their classroom
 
06:20:24.468 --> 06:20:24.478 align:start position:0%
communities is wrong for our students
 
06:20:26.430 --> 06:20:26.440 align:start position:0%
for our Public Schools for our teachers
 
06:20:27.990 --> 06:20:28.000 align:start position:0%

committee my name is Mary wilky I'm a um
 
06:21:01.670 --> 06:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
retired school teacher public school
 
06:21:04.190 --> 06:21:04.200 align:start position:0%
teacher and I Liv in conquered and I'm
 
06:21:07.830 --> 06:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill um I I don't want
 
06:21:09.190 --> 06:21:09.200 align:start position:0%
to repeat what other people have said
 
06:21:12.230 --> 06:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
the vagueness issue does worry me um I
 
06:21:14.430 --> 06:21:14.440 align:start position:0%
think when you talk about value uh
 
06:21:17.350 --> 06:21:17.360 align:start position:0%
statements um as a teacher you kind
 
06:21:19.990 --> 06:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
of it's hard to avoid value statements
 
06:21:21.750 --> 06:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
if a if a child in my class calls
 
06:21:24.590 --> 06:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
another child the n-word do I have to
 
06:21:27.230 --> 06:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
say well some people don't think that's
 
06:21:29.868 --> 06:21:29.878 align:start position:0%
okay but other people do think it's okay
 
06:21:33.150 --> 06:21:33.160 align:start position:0%
um I up until now I'm no longer teaching
 
06:21:35.070 --> 06:21:35.080 align:start position:0%
but up until I finished teaching I said
 
06:21:36.150 --> 06:21:36.160 align:start position:0%
that's not
 
06:21:38.788 --> 06:21:38.798 align:start position:0%
okay um there are a number of times when
 
06:21:41.310 --> 06:21:41.320 align:start position:0%
you call you know is it okay to say it's
 
06:21:43.990 --> 06:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
better to share please you know please
 
06:21:45.310 --> 06:21:45.320 align:start position:0%
share your materials it's better to
 
06:21:47.590 --> 06:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
share our classroom materials than to
 
06:21:50.430 --> 06:21:50.440 align:start position:0%
hoard them um that's a value
 
06:21:54.310 --> 06:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
statement I made it many times in the
 
06:21:56.788 --> 06:21:56.798 align:start position:0%
course of a day you often dealing with
 
06:21:59.190 --> 06:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
interpersonal Rea interactions that
 
06:22:02.468 --> 06:22:02.478 align:start position:0%
raise value issues and I guess I feel
 
06:22:05.990 --> 06:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
like you if that's if that's the
 
06:22:08.150 --> 06:22:08.160 align:start position:0%
guideline it's really hard to follow am
 
06:22:09.310 --> 06:22:09.320 align:start position:0%
I going to have to stop and think wait
 
06:22:11.190 --> 06:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
is this ideology is this not ideology
 
06:22:13.270 --> 06:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
ideology has a very vague definition in
 
06:22:16.270 --> 06:22:16.280 align:start position:0%
the dictionary by the way so that's one
 
06:22:17.390 --> 06:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
thing but I know other people are
 
06:22:19.430 --> 06:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
addressing that um I just would like to
 
06:22:21.788 --> 06:22:21.798 align:start position:0%
say that as a person who devoted a good
 
06:22:23.750 --> 06:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
part of my career to Public School
 
06:22:26.070 --> 06:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
teaching I find it disheart that year
 
06:22:27.948 --> 06:22:27.958 align:start position:0%
after year there are bills I mean this
 
06:22:31.030 --> 06:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
one used to be called teachers loyalty
 
06:22:33.510 --> 06:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
you know at last time it was teachers
 
06:22:36.948 --> 06:22:36.958 align:start position:0%
can't teach communism and Marxism um you
 
06:22:39.390 --> 06:22:39.400 align:start position:0%
know teachers that I know and I've
 
06:22:41.708 --> 06:22:41.718 align:start position:0%
taught in four schools I had two
 
06:22:42.990 --> 06:22:43.000 align:start position:0%
children who went to three different
 
06:22:45.070 --> 06:22:45.080 align:start position:0%
schools I know many many teachers
 
06:22:47.430 --> 06:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
through all those ways I've never met
 
06:22:49.788 --> 06:22:49.798 align:start position:0%
one who was in the business of trying to
 
06:22:53.430 --> 06:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
indoctrinate students my own experience
 
06:22:55.628 --> 06:22:55.638 align:start position:0%
and my kids experience was yes teacher
 
06:22:57.390 --> 06:22:57.400 align:start position:0%
were trying to teach kids how to think
 
06:22:59.548 --> 06:22:59.558 align:start position:0%
for themselves give them the tools the
 
06:23:01.990 --> 06:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
knowledge the research skills and let
 
06:23:04.708 --> 06:23:04.718 align:start position:0%
them come to their own conclusions um
 
06:23:07.390 --> 06:23:07.400 align:start position:0%
and so to have a bill education not
 
06:23:09.030 --> 06:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
indoctrination and I noticed it's not
 
06:23:11.350 --> 06:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
being imposed on religious schools that
 
06:23:13.510 --> 06:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
by definition do indoctrinate and that's
 
06:23:14.868 --> 06:23:14.878 align:start position:0%
fine that's their right although I would
 
06:23:17.070 --> 06:23:17.080 align:start position:0%
prefer not to pay for it but that's what
 
06:23:19.910 --> 06:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
you know here we have education not
 
06:23:23.468 --> 06:23:23.478 align:start position:0%
indoctrination it is very disheartening
 
06:23:24.948 --> 06:23:24.958 align:start position:0%
uh it's just disheartening to see this
 
06:23:26.548 --> 06:23:26.558 align:start position:0%
year after year year I went into
 
06:23:28.430 --> 06:23:28.440 align:start position:0%
teaching and so did my colleagues
 
06:23:30.310 --> 06:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
because we loved to learn we wanted to
 
06:23:32.150 --> 06:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
pass on that love of learning we wanted
 
06:23:36.350 --> 06:23:36.360 align:start position:0%
to help kids have a bright future uh not
 
06:23:38.310 --> 06:23:38.320 align:start position:0%
because we wanted to convince them that
 
06:23:41.150 --> 06:23:41.160 align:start position:0%
our way of thinking is the only way of
 
06:23:43.670 --> 06:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
thinking we didn't lie awake at night
 
06:23:46.468 --> 06:23:46.478 align:start position:0%
scheming up plans to make them into
 
06:23:48.590 --> 06:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
Communists or make them into whatever
 
06:23:51.628 --> 06:23:51.638 align:start position:0%
the latest problem is I lay awake at
 
06:23:53.150 --> 06:23:53.160 align:start position:0%
night thinking about the child that just
 
06:23:54.910 --> 06:23:54.920 align:start position:0%
arrived from Congo where his father was
 
06:23:56.990 --> 06:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
killed in War I lay awake at night
 
06:23:59.070 --> 06:23:59.080 align:start position:0%
wondering how can I help this child who
 
06:24:01.070 --> 06:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
hates to read what can I find for this
 
06:24:03.948 --> 06:24:03.958 align:start position:0%
child that will help him enjoy reading
 
06:24:05.548 --> 06:24:05.558 align:start position:0%
what can I do about this child who
 
06:24:08.070 --> 06:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't like to write and what topic
 
06:24:10.110 --> 06:24:10.120 align:start position:0%
might really grab her so she'd want to
 
06:24:11.948 --> 06:24:11.958 align:start position:0%
write what can I do about the little
 
06:24:14.310 --> 06:24:14.320 align:start position:0%
girl whose mother is dying of cancer and
 
06:24:15.910 --> 06:24:15.920 align:start position:0%
she lives with her stepfather who she
 
06:24:18.430 --> 06:24:18.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't get along with there there were
 
06:24:20.070 --> 06:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
plenty of things for me to lie at wake
 
06:24:21.670 --> 06:24:21.680 align:start position:0%
at night of about and they weren how am
 
06:24:23.548 --> 06:24:23.558 align:start position:0%
I going to make my students into people
 
06:24:25.430 --> 06:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
who think like me that was the last
 
06:24:27.430 --> 06:24:27.440 align:start position:0%
thing on my mind and it's just you can
 
06:24:29.070 --> 06:24:29.080 align:start position:0%
tell I don't usually testify in an
 
06:24:29.080 --> 06:24:30.310 align:start position:0%
tell I don't usually testify in an
emotional

06:24:30.310 --> 06:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
emotional
 
06:24:33.830 --> 06:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
way it's very hard I taught for 20 years
 
06:24:36.670 --> 06:24:36.680 align:start position:0%
I devoted my heart and soul to teaching
 
06:24:37.830 --> 06:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
and none of it had to do with
 
06:24:41.350 --> 06:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
indoctrination and this is just
 
06:24:44.270 --> 06:24:44.280 align:start position:0%
insulting thank you very much for uh
 
06:24:46.868 --> 06:24:46.878 align:start position:0%
Your Service uh to our children and um
 
06:24:50.350 --> 06:24:50.360 align:start position:0%
your testimony today uh representative
 
06:24:54.788 --> 06:24:54.798 align:start position:0%
Pell thank you Mr chair um thank you for
 
06:24:57.350 --> 06:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
coming in testify that's a longer day
 
06:24:59.948 --> 06:24:59.958 align:start position:0%
than we thought um you brought up
 
06:25:02.190 --> 06:25:02.200 align:start position:0%
religious schools and I just want to ask
 
06:25:04.310 --> 06:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
if do you think perhaps parents might
 
06:25:06.510 --> 06:25:06.520 align:start position:0%
choose a religious school for the exact
 
06:25:07.868 --> 06:25:07.878 align:start position:0%
purpose of having their children
 
06:25:10.430 --> 06:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
indoctrinated in their ideology as
 
06:25:14.070 --> 06:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
opposed to choosing a public school in
 
06:25:15.628 --> 06:25:15.638 align:start position:0%
the hopes that their children would not
 
06:25:18.510 --> 06:25:18.520 align:start position:0%
be indoctrinated in any specific
 
06:25:21.030 --> 06:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
ideology uh yes that may well be and I
 
06:25:22.750 --> 06:25:22.760 align:start position:0%
have I don't want to sound like I have
 
06:25:25.350 --> 06:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
any problem with religious schools um
 
06:25:28.190 --> 06:25:28.200 align:start position:0%
but if we think of teaching as something
 
06:25:29.868 --> 06:25:29.878 align:start position:0%
where you're trying to help kids learn
 
06:25:33.350 --> 06:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
how to think then we we want to give
 
06:25:36.750 --> 06:25:36.760 align:start position:0%
them the option of of thinking of of
 
06:25:38.230 --> 06:25:38.240 align:start position:0%
coming to their own conclusions and
 
06:25:39.590 --> 06:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
that's what I think people do look for
 
06:25:41.390 --> 06:25:41.400 align:start position:0%
in public schools and I think that's
 
06:25:45.708 --> 06:25:45.718 align:start position:0%
what public school teachers uh do try to
 
06:25:49.310 --> 06:25:49.320 align:start position:0%
do any further questions seeing none
 
06:25:52.468 --> 06:25:52.478 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you and um
 
06:25:57.390 --> 06:25:57.400 align:start position:0%
that uh wraps up our day um we have uh
 
06:25:59.868 --> 06:25:59.878 align:start position:0%
another full day tomorrow and correct me
 
06:26:01.548 --> 06:26:01.558 align:start position:0%
if I'm wrong but I believe we start at
 
06:26:01.558 --> 06:26:04.708 align:start position:0%
if I'm wrong but I believe we start at
9:15

06:26:04.708 --> 06:26:04.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:24.190 --> 06:26:24.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:24.200 --> 06:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
everybody
