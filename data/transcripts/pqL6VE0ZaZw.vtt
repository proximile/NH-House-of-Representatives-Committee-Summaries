we've we've taken a real bath
 
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
here scalding
 
00:16:01.189 --> 00:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
bath what is left and and and why
 
00:16:03.069 --> 00:16:03.079 align:start position:0%
weren't these properties
 
00:16:05.189 --> 00:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
maintained I mean they they've all
 
00:16:07.749 --> 00:16:07.759 align:start position:0%
Fallen apart all these houses are a crap
 
00:16:10.189 --> 00:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
now you can't get anything for them we
 
00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:12.440 align:start position:0%
paid dearly for them initially we paid
 
00:16:15.749 --> 00:16:15.759 align:start position:0%
very dearly and in another life I lived
 
00:16:15.759 --> 00:16:16.670 align:start position:0%
very dearly and in another life I lived
in

00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:16.680 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:16:19.829 --> 00:16:19.839 align:start position:0%
cway and I taught at kenon high school
 
00:16:22.949 --> 00:16:22.959 align:start position:0%
at cway and the bypass was going to be
 
00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:25.720 align:start position:0%
the greatest thing since slice
 
00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:28.680 align:start position:0%
bread has to be one of the the the one
 
00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:31.480 align:start position:0%
of disasters that we have entered into
 
00:16:33.309 --> 00:16:33.319 align:start position:0%
how much have we paid back first of all
 
00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:35.240 align:start position:0%
what's left that's key that's question
 
00:16:37.949 --> 00:16:37.959 align:start position:0%
number one number two we' fulfilled our
 
00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:39.759 align:start position:0%
commitment to to the federal government
 
00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
we' paid the all the money back that we
 
00:16:45.189 --> 00:16:45.199 align:start position:0%
owe right we we made that last payment
 
00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
in the in the vicinity how much was that
 
00:16:52.629 --> 00:16:52.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:55.880 align:start position:0%
nature Senator through the chair Senator
 
00:16:58.990 --> 00:16:59.000 align:start position:0%
delandro thank you for the questions um
 
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
you are correct we have paid Federal
 
00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:04.600 align:start position:0%
Highway back uh I think a tune of 28 to$
 
00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:08.600 align:start position:0%
29 million um the remaining parcels and
 
00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
I don't have an accurate number for you
 
00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:13.160 align:start position:0%
today but there's several left to sell
 
00:17:16.429 --> 00:17:16.439 align:start position:0%
and Market um and as those are sold back
 
00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:18.360 align:start position:0%
we will be paying back the department
 
00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
for for those sales um but yes it has
 
00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:24.520 align:start position:0%
been a long long time coming to sell
 
00:17:27.429 --> 00:17:27.439 align:start position:0%
several of these Parcels uh for example
 
00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:29.320 align:start position:0%
several of them on Thompson Road near
 
00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:32.840 align:start position:0%
cranmore Mountain had been on hold as we
 
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
have worked with the town to um finalize
 
00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:38.320 align:start position:0%
the build and Survey of the um the
 
00:17:41.789 --> 00:17:41.799 align:start position:0%
bypass Trail uh from himac Lane up to
 
00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
cranmore Mountain um those will soon be
 
00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
coming online in the next year so uh we
 
00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
fully envisioned lots of demand for
 
00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:52.120 align:start position:0%
those properties um but you're right the
 
00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
buildings have definitely had a lot of
 
00:17:58.190 --> 00:17:58.200 align:start position:0%
uh weather um and they have not been
 
00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:01.000 align:start position:0%
maintained uh mainly due to funding lack
 
00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
of funding to maintain them um so we're
 
00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:07.240 align:start position:0%
hoping to sell those soon um the the
 
00:18:11.149 --> 00:18:11.159 align:start position:0%
land itself is very valuable up there so
 
00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
yeah hope that answers your questions
 
00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
yeah sure
 
00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:19.200 align:start position:0%

um I don't think it's all that um
 
00:24:57.909 --> 00:24:57.919 align:start position:0%
relevant in the context of what we're
 
00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
asking for today what we are here today
 
00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:04.240 align:start position:0%
is asking for your uh approval to uh
 
00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
sell and dispose of what we've deemed as

sell and dispose of what we've deemed as
Surplus

00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:08.200 align:start position:0%
Surplus
 
00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:10.640 align:start position:0%
property what has brought us here uh is
 
00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
a very long journey of uh of an RFP that
 
00:25:15.549 --> 00:25:15.559 align:start position:0%
we put out uh for the Redevelopment of
 
00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
our two state-owned properties in
 
00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:20.240 align:start position:0%
Hampton on Interstate 95 currently they
 
00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:22.200 align:start position:0%
uh contain a state liquor store on each
 
00:25:24.549 --> 00:25:24.559 align:start position:0%
side the overall goal and the reason
 
00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
that we elected to go with an RFP route
 
00:25:29.549 --> 00:25:29.559 align:start position:0%
as opposed to just a straight sale or
 
00:25:32.549 --> 00:25:32.559 align:start position:0%
bid was we intend to stay there we are
 
00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:35.200 align:start position:0%
going to have an ongoing presence uh it
 
00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
would be analogous to we're going to be
 
00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:39.200 align:start position:0%
a joint owner an utter whatever you want
 
00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
to call it we intend to um sell
 
00:25:43.669 --> 00:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
everything that has been deemed Surplus
 
00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:45.320 align:start position:0%
with the exception of the the parcels
 
00:25:46.669 --> 00:25:46.679 align:start position:0%
where we will build our state-owned
 
00:25:49.029 --> 00:25:49.039 align:start position:0%
liquor store we will own the land
 
00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:52.200 align:start position:0%
beneath our liquor stores thus uh you
 
00:25:54.549 --> 00:25:54.559 align:start position:0%
know no property taxes and in an
 
00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
agreement on and at the direction uh
 
00:25:57.909 --> 00:25:57.919 align:start position:0%

00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Transportation
 
00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:01.360 align:start position:0%

00:27:40.269 --> 00:27:40.279 align:start position:0%
else in there that is correct with the
 
00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
with the exception we will also retain
 
00:27:43.669 --> 00:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
ownership of the on-ramps and the
 
00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:46.120 align:start position:0%
off-ramps and the limited right away
 
00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
access that the Department of
 
00:27:49.909 --> 00:27:49.919 align:start position:0%
Transportation already enjoys by way of
 
00:27:51.789 --> 00:27:51.799 align:start position:0%
uh registry documents that'll stay
 
00:27:55.509 --> 00:27:55.519 align:start position:0%
intact um basically to to summarize when
 
00:27:57.630 --> 00:27:57.640 align:start position:0%
we met with Federal Highway because we
 
00:27:59.470 --> 00:27:59.480 align:start position:0%
met with fed Highway as well as the OT
 
00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
to make sure there were no Highway funds
 
00:28:02.149 --> 00:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
involved in the acquisition of any of
 
00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:05.080 align:start position:0%
these Parcels which they've confirmed uh
 
00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
that was a requirement of theirs that uh
 
00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:08.840 align:start position:0%
with with the stipulation let me
 
00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:10.720 align:start position:0%
indicate that if had we received a
 
00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:15.200 align:start position:0%
proposal that was not um receptive to to
 
00:28:17.149 --> 00:28:17.159 align:start position:0%
that agreement then then there would
 
00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:18.200 align:start position:0%
have to be a whole new layer of
 
00:28:20.389 --> 00:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
approvals from Federal Highway about the
 
00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
relocation of the ramps or the
 
00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
reconfiguration so all proposals we we
 
00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
received met that requirement H yeah yes
 
00:28:30.149 --> 00:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
follow up please do we do this with any
 
00:28:33.549 --> 00:28:33.559 align:start position:0%
of the other liquor stores on 93 we have
 
00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
an eastbound I mean North and southbound
 
00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
liquor store um do we do we do the same
 
00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
thing there do we sell all the property
 
00:28:42.509 --> 00:28:42.519 align:start position:0%
except for the liquor store do we own
 
00:28:44.909 --> 00:28:44.919 align:start position:0%
that and lease that to the Proprietors
 
00:28:47.509 --> 00:28:47.519 align:start position:0%
of the various okay sure I can answer
 
00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
that I was involved so that's a that was
 
00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:52.240 align:start position:0%
a little bit of a different Model A
 
00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
different project and I'll try to very
 
00:28:56.549 --> 00:28:56.559 align:start position:0%
Briefly summarize it back when it was
 
00:28:58.430 --> 00:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
decided that the hooks that welcome
 
00:29:00.909 --> 00:29:00.919 align:start position:0%
areas or rest areas were going to be
 
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
redeveloped um it was done through an
 
00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:07.240 align:start position:0%
RFP process um and the the outcome of
 
00:29:09.269 --> 00:29:09.279 align:start position:0%
that was liquor The Liquor Commission
 
00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:11.000 align:start position:0%
had owned all of the land on both sides
 
00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
of Interstate 93 we entered into an
 
00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
agreement uh again with the oversight of
 
00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
the Department of Justice in which we
 
00:29:20.909 --> 00:29:20.919 align:start position:0%
conveyed everything to the Department of
 
00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
Transportation with the exception of
 
00:29:26.269 --> 00:29:26.279 align:start position:0%
where our building sits today the dirt
 
00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:28.240 align:start position:0%
beneath it so everything else down there
 
00:29:29.669 --> 00:29:29.679 align:start position:0%
is owned by the New Hampshire Department
 
00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:32.120 align:start position:0%
of Transportation they are currently
 
00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:35.080 align:start position:0%
under a a 35-year ground lease that they
 
00:29:36.789 --> 00:29:36.799 align:start position:0%
entered into with the entity that is the
 
00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
developer operator down there to this
 
00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
day so we don't own anything else down
 
00:29:44.669 --> 00:29:44.679 align:start position:0%
in hookset other than our store and the
 
00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
land beneath
 
00:29:50.269 --> 00:29:50.279 align:start position:0%
us get one more yes please so again so
 
00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:52.600 align:start position:0%
in in hookset the state I'm just going
 
00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
to use the state as a generic it could
 
00:29:58.389 --> 00:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
be dot or or uh liquor um own owns all
 
00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
the land that the the gas stations are
 
00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:02.200 align:start position:0%
on the restaurants are on as well as the
 
00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
liquor store different entities May own
 
00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
pieces of that but it's still the state
 
00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire owns that and we do a
 
00:30:10.789 --> 00:30:10.799 align:start position:0%
ground lease for that versus what we're
 
00:30:13.909 --> 00:30:13.919 align:start position:0%
proposing here is to private sale the
 
00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:15.880 align:start position:0%
property except for where the state
 
00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:18.360 align:start position:0%
liquor store is and have a private sale
 
00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
owner of that rest area yes that is that
 
00:30:23.669 --> 00:30:23.679 align:start position:0%
is correct and that is that is one of
 
00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
the critical reasons why it's not just
 
00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:27.240 align:start position:0%
the person sale agreement but it's the
 
00:30:29.389 --> 00:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
master development agreement because
 
00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
again think of it as neighbors um
 
00:30:33.789 --> 00:30:33.799 align:start position:0%
there's going to be by virtue of the
 
00:30:35.509 --> 00:30:35.519 align:start position:0%
cros easements and the and the the
 
00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:37.000 align:start position:0%
sharing of the ramps and of course
 
00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:38.720 align:start position:0%
there's going to be ongoing common area
 
00:30:41.549 --> 00:30:41.559 align:start position:0%
maintenance and the the goal of this is
 
00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:44.200 align:start position:0%
that at the outcome of this The Liquor
 
00:30:45.789 --> 00:30:45.799 align:start position:0%
Commission will own its own building we
 
00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:48.760 align:start position:0%
will maintain our own building exterior
 
00:30:51.549 --> 00:30:51.559 align:start position:0%
and interior we will uh participate in
 
00:30:53.909 --> 00:30:53.919 align:start position:0%
the maintenance of the ramps because we
 
00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
own the ramps and and the rest of it
 
00:30:58.470 --> 00:30:58.480 align:start position:0%
will be owned by the private entity and
 
00:30:59.870 --> 00:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
and that's being conveyed by a fee
 
00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:02.840 align:start position:0%
simple interest one more followup please
 
00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
and I'm assuming we did a cost analysis
 
00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
of what we make in revenue for the
 
00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
purposes of the ground lease like we do
 
00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:11.240 align:start position:0%
in in Hook set as compared to just an
 
00:31:14.669 --> 00:31:14.679 align:start position:0%
outright sale and the one-time Revenue
 
00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:17.080 align:start position:0%
no no we did not we did the reason we
 
00:31:18.269 --> 00:31:18.279 align:start position:0%
did not was because the decision was
 
00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:22.840 align:start position:0%
made to to convey the property again fee
 
00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
simple outright interest and the
 
00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:27.720 align:start position:0%
successful developer operator they you
 
00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
know another piece of this is currently
 
00:31:31.669 --> 00:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
none of those properties are on the
 
00:31:34.149 --> 00:31:34.159 align:start position:0%
property tax roles everything else will
 
00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:36.360 align:start position:0%
now return to the town of Hampton's tax
 
00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:37.870 align:start position:0%
now return to the town of Hampton's tax
roles

00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:37.880 align:start position:0%
roles
 
00:31:42.029 --> 00:31:42.039 align:start position:0%
okay Senator pro thank you Senator Lang
 
00:31:43.909 --> 00:31:43.919 align:start position:0%
sort of asked some of what I was going
 
00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:45.200 align:start position:0%
to but I guess I'll follow up with one
 
00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
further are you looking to have both of
 
00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:50.200 align:start position:0%
these properties purchased by one
 
00:31:52.549 --> 00:31:52.559 align:start position:0%
developer and they they sort of or are
 
00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
you looking to perhaps have these
 
00:31:56.669 --> 00:31:56.679 align:start position:0%
multiple different developers purchase
 
00:31:58.549 --> 00:31:58.559 align:start position:0%
them I guess I trying to understand the
 
00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:00.440 align:start position:0%
vision here where we're going sure no
 
00:32:01.669 --> 00:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
that's a good question thank you for
 
00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:04.760 align:start position:0%
asking um the so the the initial RFP
 
00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:05.960 align:start position:0%
which was not I shouldn't say the
 
00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
initial the ultimate RFP RFP
 
00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
224-1 it let the door open in other
 
00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:13.880 align:start position:0%
words we were we wanted to see what the
 
00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:16.200 align:start position:0%
market came to us prior to that we had
 
00:32:20.389 --> 00:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
done an RFQ to you know to qualify uh
 
00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
and I don't want tell me when you had
 
00:32:25.149 --> 00:32:25.159 align:start position:0%
enough uh be prior to undertaking this
 
00:32:27.629 --> 00:32:27.639 align:start position:0%
those properties had never been surveyed
 
00:32:29.789 --> 00:32:29.799 align:start position:0%
uh there were no other uses allowed on
 
00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
those properties by the town of Hampton
 
00:32:34.269 --> 00:32:34.279 align:start position:0%
through our efforts uh it was
 
00:32:36.389 --> 00:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
rezoned what was called the interl
 
00:32:38.549 --> 00:32:38.559 align:start position:0%
interstate overlay District was created
 
00:32:39.789 --> 00:32:39.799 align:start position:0%
and it was adopted by the town of
 
00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:42.200 align:start position:0%
Hampton thus you can now have amenities
 
00:32:44.909 --> 00:32:44.919 align:start position:0%
like food fueling uh there were certain
 
00:32:47.149 --> 00:32:47.159 align:start position:0%
uses they disallowed uh they were very
 
00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:49.720 align:start position:0%
clear about that that came in uh on an
 
00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
earlier round of rfqs so the the um it's
 
00:32:56.990 --> 00:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
been an evolving process in which we
 
00:32:59.029 --> 00:32:59.039 align:start position:0%
said okay you give us your ideas you
 
00:33:01.029 --> 00:33:01.039 align:start position:0%
know you tell us what uh you know what
 
00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:02.600 align:start position:0%
you think you could do there what can
 
00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
you bring us what can you make to do
 
00:33:05.789 --> 00:33:05.799 align:start position:0%
what can you do to make the Hampton
 
00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
Welcome Center is a little more
 
00:33:09.789 --> 00:33:09.799 align:start position:0%
welcoming and and that's and so that's
 
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
what came out of the
 
00:33:15.629 --> 00:33:15.639 align:start position:0%
proposals thank you thank you thank you
 
00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
um I have a couple questions was was
 
00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
there uh so this is without a doubt of
 
00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
of Greater benefit to The Liquor
 
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
Commission than it is to the Department
 
00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:29.080 align:start position:0%
of Transportation I would assume
 
00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:31.960 align:start position:0%
they uh was there something um I know
 
00:33:35.269 --> 00:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
this is the direction you went um I'm
 
00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
sure there was a conversation with
 
00:33:39.029 --> 00:33:39.039 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation if that
 
00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
model and having to do 35e ground leases
 
00:33:44.789 --> 00:33:44.799 align:start position:0%
uh wasn't appropriate was there any of
 
00:33:47.389 --> 00:33:47.399 align:start position:0%
that conversation or we've always been
 
00:33:49.029 --> 00:33:49.039 align:start position:0%
moving with the Liquor Commission to
 
00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:50.840 align:start position:0%
sell the
 
00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
property no uh to as a matter of fact we
 
00:33:57.870 --> 00:33:57.880 align:start position:0%
did offer um not only to do but
 
00:33:59.830 --> 00:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
specifically we offered to dot the
 
00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:02.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to acquire it and pursue the
 
00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
path that they chose to do and hooks it
 
00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
uh former the former commissioner uh
 
00:34:10.389 --> 00:34:10.399 align:start position:0%
declined that offer and and with some
 
00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
very very valid reasons uh you know not
 
00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
not the least of which you know funding
 
00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:16.109 align:start position:0%
not the least of which you know funding
and

00:34:16.109 --> 00:34:16.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:34:19.069 --> 00:34:19.079 align:start position:0%
resources um and and not because of
 
00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
anything negative about what they
 
00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:22.760 align:start position:0%
undertook and hooks it I want to be
 
00:34:24.629 --> 00:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
clear about that it was just this
 
00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity came along and no other
 
00:34:29.669 --> 00:34:29.679 align:start position:0%
state agency really seemed very
 
00:34:32.829 --> 00:34:32.839 align:start position:0%
interested receptive we've also had uh
 
00:34:34.270 --> 00:34:34.280 align:start position:0%
preliminary discussions with the town of
 
00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:36.800 align:start position:0%
Hampton uh depending on whether or not
 
00:34:39.389 --> 00:34:39.399 align:start position:0%
we obtain your approval here today uh
 
00:34:41.430 --> 00:34:41.440 align:start position:0%
our real estate broker will be formally
 
00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
offering it to the town of Hampton when
 
00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
I was going through my multiple meetings
 
00:34:47.829 --> 00:34:47.839 align:start position:0%
with the town and the town manager uh
 
00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
they made it they they kind of
 
00:34:51.069 --> 00:34:51.079 align:start position:0%
anticipated that they understand that
 
00:34:52.589 --> 00:34:52.599 align:start position:0%
it'll be offered to them but they will
 
00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:55.800 align:start position:0%
have to pay whatever is the fair market
 
00:34:58.750 --> 00:34:58.760 align:start position:0%
value at a minimum and and again
 
00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:01.160 align:start position:0%
anecdotally um probably shouldn't go
 
00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
into anecdotes but anecdotally they said
 
00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:04.520 align:start position:0%
no we we'd rather have the property on
 
00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:05.800 align:start position:0%
the property tax
 
00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
rules thank you Mr Davis for clearing
 
00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:10.760 align:start position:0%
that point that that that takes a lot of
 
00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
uh cloudy out of my thought process um
 
00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
the uh the sale will be no less than $15
 
00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
million if it if it turns out that
 
00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:25.000 align:start position:0%
development costs are too high or the
 
00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
economy is not what they want and we
 
00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
have four I believe said we have four
 
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
four people that are interested in this
 
00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:32.990 align:start position:0%
four people that are interested in this
qualified

00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
qualified
 
00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
biders then if it's any less than $15
 
00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
million it will come back for approval
 
00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:41.640 align:start position:0%
am I correct in that or do we lose our
 
00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:44.440 align:start position:0%
handle on this process maybe I should
 
00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
ask Mr Shay that question but what's
 
00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
what's your understanding
 
00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
Sir Mr
 
00:35:54.589 --> 00:35:54.599 align:start position:0%
Davis um thank you for asking again I I
 
00:35:57.309 --> 00:35:57.319 align:start position:0%
am not an expert on the process I have
 
00:35:59.230 --> 00:35:59.240 align:start position:0%
I've tried tried to become I have been
 
00:36:00.430 --> 00:36:00.440 align:start position:0%
been in front of this committee before
 
00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:02.680 align:start position:0%
on some other smaller sales and it was
 
00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
my understanding that whatever level of
 
00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
authority you grant to my commission or
 
00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
my agency um we have some latitude
 
00:36:13.309 --> 00:36:13.319 align:start position:0%
before we need to come back but we would
 
00:36:16.109 --> 00:36:16.119 align:start position:0%
we will still need if we do not obtain
 
00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
at a minimum of the 15 million or if you
 
00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:22.640 align:start position:0%
indicate there's uh you know a margin in
 
00:36:25.109 --> 00:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
there um and we still don't meet that
 
00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:27.640 align:start position:0%
number we need to come back to you okay
 
00:36:30.430 --> 00:36:30.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Chay is that your
 
00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:32.920 align:start position:0%
understanding yes um the committee when
 
00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
you first formed you had adopted some
 
00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
guidelines in terms of when you do
 
00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:39.720 align:start position:0%
approve um disposal of property when
 
00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:41.880 align:start position:0%
they provide a value to you the agency
 
00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:45.280 align:start position:0%
does that the um actual sale isn't um
 
00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:47.960 align:start position:0%
less than 10% of that value it could be
 
00:36:49.390 --> 00:36:49.400 align:start position:0%
much greater and they don't need to come
 
00:36:51.550 --> 00:36:51.560 align:start position:0%
back but if it's less than the amount
 
00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
that they've proposed by 10% then they
 
00:36:55.829 --> 00:36:55.839 align:start position:0%
need to come back and talk to you okay
 
00:36:57.309 --> 00:36:57.319 align:start position:0%
at least provide an informational item
 
00:36:59.829 --> 00:36:59.839 align:start position:0%
to to explain why that might be the case
 
00:37:01.390 --> 00:37:01.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Davis you wouldn't mind
 
00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:04.640 align:start position:0%
another question so I believe in the
 
00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
presentation it was talked that we're
 
00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
successful and this becomes a beautiful
 
00:37:11.589 --> 00:37:11.599 align:start position:0%
property and the Liquor Commission is uh
 
00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:13.800 align:start position:0%
receiving $15 million you were going to
 
00:37:15.390 --> 00:37:15.400 align:start position:0%
use that or the department was going to
 
00:37:18.069 --> 00:37:18.079 align:start position:0%
use that money to pay down Bond
 
00:37:22.109 --> 00:37:22.119 align:start position:0%
obligations um you have you have two I I
 
00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
imagine I think I read we're going to
 
00:37:25.309 --> 00:37:25.319 align:start position:0%
demolish what we have we're going to put
 
00:37:28.069 --> 00:37:28.079 align:start position:0%
up two new buildings uh
 
00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
is will that cost will that new cost be
 
00:37:35.829 --> 00:37:35.839 align:start position:0%
bonded also or will that cost come from
 
00:37:38.829 --> 00:37:38.839 align:start position:0%
the $15 million and do you have some
 
00:37:40.910 --> 00:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
idea what that building cost now is
 
00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:42.520 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
be there's three questions I apologize
 
00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
that's that's fine that's fine you there
 
00:37:48.109 --> 00:37:48.119 align:start position:0%
is no
 
00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
limit here as long as you'll help me uh
 
00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:52.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for the three questions so
 
00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
first of all back to the legislation
 
00:37:57.630 --> 00:37:57.640 align:start position:0%
that that respond to all of this we
 
00:37:59.270 --> 00:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
sought and we were granted Capital
 
00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
Appropriations to construct two new
 
00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:05.240 align:start position:0%
state-owned liquor stores uh the stores
 
00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:06.920 align:start position:0%
that that are there now are very old
 
00:38:09.109 --> 00:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
they're very tired they're they're very
 
00:38:11.230 --> 00:38:11.240 align:start position:0%
undersized based on what we have been
 
00:38:13.589 --> 00:38:13.599 align:start position:0%
doing in our agency over the last 12 to
 
00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
15 years um it is our goal and it was
 
00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:18.760 align:start position:0%
stated in the RFP that when all is said
 
00:38:21.349 --> 00:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
and done we will have two new St well we
 
00:38:25.390 --> 00:38:25.400 align:start position:0%
will have two new stores um that will
 
00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
mirror to the greatest extent possible
 
00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
the one that we built on the Portsmouth
 
00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:32.200 align:start position:0%
traffic circle to give you some um some
 
00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:34.040 align:start position:0%
context the stores that are over there
 
00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:36.680 align:start position:0%
now are in the you know 16 to 19,000
 
00:38:39.069 --> 00:38:39.079 align:start position:0%
Square ft uh they've been added on to
 
00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:41.160 align:start position:0%
over the years and they're they're not
 
00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:43.480 align:start position:0%
expandable the store we have at the
 
00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:45.160 align:start position:0%
pouth traffic circle is just under
 
00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:49.720 align:start position:0%
23,000 Square ft the biders um all as
 
00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
part of the process uh were're advised
 
00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:54.640 align:start position:0%
that that's what we want we've actually
 
00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
had site visits to the Portsmouth Circle
 
00:38:58.550 --> 00:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
they brought their teams they looked at
 
00:39:00.270 --> 00:39:00.280 align:start position:0%
them and the proposals that I have
 
00:39:01.870 --> 00:39:01.880 align:start position:0%
received reflect
 
00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:04.640 align:start position:0%
that and and and again we we will be
 
00:39:06.270 --> 00:39:06.280 align:start position:0%
paying for the construction out of our
 
00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:08.480 align:start position:0%
appropriation we the proceeds of the
 
00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:10.160 align:start position:0%
sale are already spoken
 
00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:13.880 align:start position:0%
for okay and do you have a an idea of
 
00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
the cost to build your two new
 
00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
structures based on um modeling of what
 
00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:23.560 align:start position:0%
was done in the pouth market that store
 
00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
cost somewhere in the vicinity of 7.2
 
00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:27.950 align:start position:0%
cost somewhere in the vicinity of 7.2
million

00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:27.960 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:39:29.829 --> 00:39:29.839 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
you the um my my last U go right ahead
 
00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
I'll come back to M's a wrap up please
 
00:39:39.349 --> 00:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
go ahead sender so so I guess that
 
00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:40.520 align:start position:0%
bodess the question so you're going to
 
00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:42.640 align:start position:0%
build the new stores whether we approve
 
00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
this sale or not is is the two are not
 
00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:46.150 align:start position:0%
this sale or not is is the two are not
connected

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
connected
 
00:39:48.430 --> 00:39:48.440 align:start position:0%
correct I would have to defer to the
 
00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:49.880 align:start position:0%
chairman of the commission but it is my
 
00:39:52.069 --> 00:39:52.079 align:start position:0%
belief that is our intent we still we
 
00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
still need two new stores yeah all right
 
00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:56.030 align:start position:0%
still need two new stores yeah all right
thank

00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:39:59.550 --> 00:39:59.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
and um a followup the four groups U the
 
00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
rfps have put put out there and I
 
00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:08.480 align:start position:0%
believe there are different
 
00:40:11.069 --> 00:40:11.079 align:start position:0%
philosophies from the four Builders what
 
00:40:13.589 --> 00:40:13.599 align:start position:0%
they would like to build and the size of
 
00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
of what they are intending to build if
 
00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:17.349 align:start position:0%
of what they are intending to build if
I'm

00:40:17.349 --> 00:40:17.359 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:20.720 align:start position:0%
correct um and I I just want to offer
 
00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
this as food for thought to take back to
 
00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:25.190 align:start position:0%
this as food for thought to take back to
the

00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:40:27.589 --> 00:40:27.599 align:start position:0%
commissioner a business that I've owned
 
00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
for 30 plus years is a convenience store
 
00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
in gas
 
00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:35.720 align:start position:0%
operation and my store operates 24 hours
 
00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
on Route 16 and I'm not a Gateway I'm
 
00:40:43.109 --> 00:40:43.119 align:start position:0%
one of 20 within 20 miles of me and my
 
00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:46.200 align:start position:0%
operation is 6,000 square
 
00:40:49.309 --> 00:40:49.319 align:start position:0%
feet I I would hope that when you get
