00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
should actually end with the word with
 
00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:43.380 align:start position:0%
the word with the with the words
 
00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:48.020 align:start position:0%
paragraph one d one parenthesis small d
 
00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:50.820 align:start position:0%
right now it goes on to say or detained
 
00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
for a period of not more than 72 hours
 
00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
that I don't know where that came from
 
00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:56.700 align:start position:0%
but it shouldn't be there so that that
 
00:19:58.850 --> 00:19:58.860 align:start position:0%
should be eliminated
 
00:19:58.860 --> 00:19:59.450 align:start position:0%
should be eliminated
um

00:19:59.450 --> 00:19:59.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:03.720 align:start position:0%
a one uh sort of minor uh but
 
00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:05.820 align:start position:0%
nonetheless this is a substantive change
 
00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:08.460 align:start position:0%
to some extent is in
 
00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
um that same section three
 
00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:16.200 align:start position:0%
uh let's see three
 
00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:19.020 align:start position:0%
um B
 
00:20:22.549 --> 00:20:22.559 align:start position:0%
no I'm sorry 3C which I might copy is
 
00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
Page four of the bill you'll see where
 
00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:26.100 align:start position:0%
it says and I'm just I'm quoting your
 
00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
failure of a person to abide by previous
 
00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
bail conditions if there is probable
 
00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
cause to believe that while on release
 
00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:35.580 align:start position:0%
pending resolution of a previous offense
 
00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:38.220 align:start position:0%
the person committed a felony Class A
 
00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:40.500 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor or driving or operating
 
00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:44.340 align:start position:0%
while impaired was released on bail and
 
00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:46.440 align:start position:0%
thereafter was arrested
 
00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
I changed that from was arrested for
 
00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:55.260 align:start position:0%
to commit it because this is an issue
 
00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:57.240 align:start position:0%
that it came up in when I was on the
 
00:20:59.210 --> 00:20:59.220 align:start position:0%
spirit court for that there used to be a
 
00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:02.460 align:start position:0%
a condition of of probation that you
 
00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:04.980 align:start position:0%
shall remain arrest free
 
00:21:07.669 --> 00:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
well the problem with that is if if
 
00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:10.980 align:start position:0%
somebody gets arrested and there's no
 
00:21:13.909 --> 00:21:13.919 align:start position:0%
valid basis for the arrest that can't be
 
00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:15.980 align:start position:0%
a basis for violating their probation
 
00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:19.620 align:start position:0%
and so that that that same language kind
 
00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
of creeped into this so that the real
 
00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
the real thing is you should have
 
00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:26.340 align:start position:0%
committed an offense not just been
 
00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
arrested for it so that's why a change
 
00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
made that change and then the only other
 
00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
changes that I've made
 
00:21:34.909 --> 00:21:34.919 align:start position:0%
um which you'll see is the uh later on
 
00:21:38.029 --> 00:21:38.039 align:start position:0%
in the in sections uh 10 10 and of the
 
00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:41.220 align:start position:0%
bill uh there's reference to this to the
 
00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:42.900 align:start position:0%
district court and since the district
 
00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
court is now the Circuit Court I made
 
00:21:46.789 --> 00:21:46.799 align:start position:0%
that change so I guess what I'd like to
 
00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:50.280 align:start position:0%
do is very briefly to just go through
 
00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:50.810 align:start position:0%
do is very briefly to just go through
um

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:50.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:53.940 align:start position:0%
the major changes that um this bill
 
00:21:57.770 --> 00:21:57.780 align:start position:0%
would would accomplish first of all it
 
00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:00.780 align:start position:0%
provides for very serious offenses which
 
00:22:04.549 --> 00:22:04.559 align:start position:0%
are listed it provides that
 
00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:07.500 align:start position:0%
um if a court fines by a clear and
 
00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
convincing evidence standard
 
00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:10.630 align:start position:0%
convincing evidence standard
um

00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:14.940 align:start position:0%
uh that the person is dangerous then the
 
00:22:18.409 --> 00:22:18.419 align:start position:0%
court must order the person detained now
 
00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
some I I remember I talked to a
 
00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:21.900 align:start position:0%
representative and maybe you're going to
 
00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
hear from representatives of the law
 
00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:25.860 align:start position:0%
enforcement community
 
00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:29.039 align:start position:0%
who thought that it would be better to
 
00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:32.100 align:start position:0%
have a rebuttable presumption that there
 
00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
be detention in that circumstance
 
00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
I have uh respect with respect to them I
 
00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
think that would go too far to say that
 
00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:44.460 align:start position:0%
even if a person does not have any kind
 
00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:46.740 align:start position:0%
of a criminal record
 
00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:48.780 align:start position:0%
um if they're arrested for a really
 
00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:50.580 align:start position:0%
serious offense aggravated felonious
 
00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
sexual assault but let's assume they
 
00:22:53.029 --> 00:22:53.039 align:start position:0%
have no record
 
00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
that the court that it would be
 
00:22:56.810 --> 00:22:56.820 align:start position:0%
appropriate for for there to be a
 
00:22:58.549 --> 00:22:58.559 align:start position:0%
rebuttable presumption that they'll be
 
00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
detained it seems to me that just goes
 
00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
too far
 
00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:05.100 align:start position:0%
um if you're depriving somebody of their
 
00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:07.740 align:start position:0%
of their Liberty and it seems to me that
 
00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:08.630 align:start position:0%
of their Liberty and it seems to me that
that

00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:11.700 align:start position:0%
um I would say Others May differ but I
 
00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
would say at a minimum there should be
 
00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:15.480 align:start position:0%
clear and convincing evidence that the
 
00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:18.360 align:start position:0%
uh that the person is dangerous before
 
00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
in this particular case not just because
 
00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:23.100 align:start position:0%
of the crime they're charged with in
 
00:23:25.669 --> 00:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
order for them to be uh to be held
 
00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:27.140 align:start position:0%
without bail
 
00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:32.820 align:start position:0%
in subsection uh 592 uh the 597 colon 2
 
00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:34.570 align:start position:0%
in subsection uh 592 uh the 597 colon 2
3B

00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:34.580 align:start position:0%
3B
 
00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:38.340 align:start position:0%
which deals with with less serious but
 
00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:40.440 align:start position:0%
still serious offenses
 
00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:42.900 align:start position:0%
um you'll you'll notice that there there
 
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
is not a requirement of detention but
 
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
the judge has discretion to detain but
 
00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:50.940 align:start position:0%
again it only is if there's a finding of
 
00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:53.340 align:start position:0%
clear and convincing evidence uh that
 
00:23:55.549 --> 00:23:55.559 align:start position:0%
the person is a danger
 
00:23:57.940 --> 00:23:57.950 align:start position:0%
um with regard to um
 
00:23:57.950 --> 00:23:59.090 align:start position:0%
um with regard to um
[Music]

00:23:59.090 --> 00:23:59.100 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
risk of failure to to appear again the
 
00:24:04.549 --> 00:24:04.559 align:start position:0%
standard is clear and convincing
 
00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:07.020 align:start position:0%
evidence so the only I think what you'll
 
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
see is the only places in this bill
 
00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
where I have employed the rebuttable
 
00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:13.669 align:start position:0%
where I have employed the rebuttable
presumption

00:24:13.669 --> 00:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
presumption
 
00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:16.740 align:start position:0%
is in circumstances where the person has
 
00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:19.940 align:start position:0%
a prior history of committing offenses
 
00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:23.000 align:start position:0%
there it seems to me it does make sense
 
00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:26.340 align:start position:0%
uh to to apply a reputable presumption
 
00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
and I should say here one of the one of
 
00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:31.620 align:start position:0%
the arguments that was made by the by
 
00:24:33.169 --> 00:24:33.179 align:start position:0%
some people in law enforcement Community
 
00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
was well under federal law there they do
 
00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:40.260 align:start position:0%
use a rebuttable presumption for serious
 
00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:42.900 align:start position:0%
offenses even if there's even if the
 
00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
person uh does not have a prior history
 
00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:48.900 align:start position:0%
of other offenses the court can say that
 
00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
the that uh because of the nature of the
 
00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
offense there's a rebuttable presumption
 
00:24:55.610 --> 00:24:55.620 align:start position:0%
and the defendant has to has to rebut
 
00:24:57.649 --> 00:24:57.659 align:start position:0%
that again as I said for the reason I
 
00:24:59.029 --> 00:24:59.039 align:start position:0%
said bill before I don't think that
 
00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
that's appropriate in circumstances
 
00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
where a person does not have a prior
 
00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
history but where they do and you'll see
 
00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:10.940 align:start position:0%
that there's a in section
 
00:25:13.549 --> 00:25:13.559 align:start position:0%
597-23p3 there's a rebuttable
 
00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:15.240 align:start position:0%
presumption of a risk of failure to
 
00:25:18.049 --> 00:25:18.059 align:start position:0%
appear if the person has three prior
 
00:25:21.409 --> 00:25:21.419 align:start position:0%
non-appearances in a five-year period or
 
00:25:24.649 --> 00:25:24.659 align:start position:0%
two prior non-appearances in uh in the
 
00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:26.580 align:start position:0%
present case
 
00:25:30.289 --> 00:25:30.299 align:start position:0%
for those circumstances the bill has a
 
00:25:32.269 --> 00:25:32.279 align:start position:0%
lower standard of proof the court has to
 
00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
find only by a preponderance of of the
 
00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:37.290 align:start position:0%
find only by a preponderance of of the
evidence

00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:37.300 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:38.830 align:start position:0%
evidence
[Music]

00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:41.480 align:start position:0%
subsection C of
 
00:25:43.789 --> 00:25:43.799 align:start position:0%
59723c of the bill that's a very
 
00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
important provision because one of the
 
00:25:48.049 --> 00:25:48.059 align:start position:0%
things we heard last year was there was
 
00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:51.500 align:start position:0%
there was a real concern about persons
 
00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
who have committed just repeat offensive
 
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
continually commit repeat offenses and
 
00:26:00.049 --> 00:26:00.059 align:start position:0%
it can be you know it may not be a
 
00:26:01.549 --> 00:26:01.559 align:start position:0%
violent offense it may be something like
 
00:26:04.789 --> 00:26:04.799 align:start position:0%
like theft but if it happens again and
 
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
again and again uh the uh the the court
 
00:26:11.029 --> 00:26:11.039 align:start position:0%
the court should be able to say that
 
00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:13.260 align:start position:0%
look this this person is a danger in the
 
00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:14.580 align:start position:0%
sense that if we keep releasing and
 
00:26:15.529 --> 00:26:15.539 align:start position:0%
they're going to keep committing
 
00:26:18.490 --> 00:26:18.500 align:start position:0%
offenses and so subsection C would allow
 
00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:21.720 align:start position:0%
if there are if there's probable cause
 
00:26:24.409 --> 00:26:24.419 align:start position:0%
to believe that a person committed two
 
00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:27.240 align:start position:0%
prior offenses a while out on bail than
 
00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
the court has the authority to set to
 
00:26:31.669 --> 00:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
make that determination
 
00:26:31.679 --> 00:26:34.130 align:start position:0%
make that determination
uh

00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:34.140 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:37.250 align:start position:0%
uh
the

00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:40.140 align:start position:0%
you'll also notice in in RSI I think
 
00:26:42.529 --> 00:26:42.539 align:start position:0%
again this is an important provision the
 
00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:46.740 align:start position:0%
an RSA 5 and I propose RSA 597 to Roman
 
00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
numeral four
 
00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:50.340 align:start position:0%
the bill provides that the Rules of
 
00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
Evidence don't apply in bail hearings
 
00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
that's uh that's uh traditionally been
 
00:27:00.289 --> 00:27:00.299 align:start position:0%
the the way the law is operated but the
 
00:27:02.269 --> 00:27:02.279 align:start position:0%
rule but the statute specifically
 
00:27:05.269 --> 00:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
provides that whatever evidence the
 
00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
court considers has to be reliable so
 
00:27:10.909 --> 00:27:10.919 align:start position:0%
the court you know as an example the
 
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
court might be able to consider hearsay
 
00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
evidence in a particular case but only
 
00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:17.640 align:start position:0%
if it's reliable evidence if the court
 
00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:20.100 align:start position:0%
has some question about is this evidence
 
00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:22.980 align:start position:0%
reliable or is it just you know is this
 
00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
not worth very much then the court
 
00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to consider it
 
00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:28.549 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to consider it
um

00:27:28.549 --> 00:27:28.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:30.769 --> 00:27:30.779 align:start position:0%
so that I'm and I'm gonna I'm happy to
 
00:27:33.049 --> 00:27:33.059 align:start position:0%
take any questions on on any of the
 
00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
points I just uh talked about
 
00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:36.529 align:start position:0%
points I just uh talked about
um

00:27:36.529 --> 00:27:36.539 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:38.700 align:start position:0%
I now want to turn to what is probably
 
00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:41.580 align:start position:0%
the most touchy issue about this bill
 
00:27:43.549 --> 00:27:43.559 align:start position:0%
and that is the elimination of bail
 
00:27:45.769 --> 00:27:45.779 align:start position:0%
Commissioners let me say at the outset
 
00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
that I have I have nothing against fail
 
00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:50.940 align:start position:0%
Commissioners I you know I don't I don't
 
00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:53.580 align:start position:0%
know that I know any bail Commissioners
 
00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:55.260 align:start position:0%
personally although maybe there are some
 
00:27:56.269 --> 00:27:56.279 align:start position:0%
people who have worked in the court
 
00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
system and are bail Commissioners and I
 
00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
just didn't know that but
 
00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
um uh I've heard good things about many
 
00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
bail Commissioners I've also heard you
 
00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:08.460 align:start position:0%
know some things that that some bail
 
00:28:10.610 --> 00:28:10.620 align:start position:0%
Commissioners do not do a particularly
 
00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:14.700 align:start position:0%
good job but my point is not to uh you
 
00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:16.500 align:start position:0%
know is not to sort of rank on bail
 
00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:19.020 align:start position:0%
Commissioners my basic point is this is
 
00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:20.340 align:start position:0%
simply this
 
00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:22.380 align:start position:0%
it seems to me
 
00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:23.810 align:start position:0%
it seems to me
that

00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:23.820 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:26.100 align:start position:0%
if you're going to have the authority
 
00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:29.460 align:start position:0%
to take away some someone's Liberty
 
00:28:31.789 --> 00:28:31.799 align:start position:0%
the person who does that ought to be a
 
00:28:31.799 --> 00:28:32.890 align:start position:0%
the person who does that ought to be a
judge

00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:32.900 align:start position:0%
judge
 
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
I think that's uh you know who was who
 
00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:37.620 align:start position:0%
has gone through the Constitutional
 
00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:40.200 align:start position:0%
process of being nominated by the
 
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
governor confirmed by the council and
 
00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
appointed by the governor to make those
 
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
those kind of decisions
 
00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
and I think you know I I understand that
 
00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:52.860 align:start position:0%
there's that there may be sort of a
 
00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:54.360 align:start position:0%
sympathy for lack of a better term
 
00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
element that uh we you know we don't we
 
00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
don't want to sort of uh
 
00:29:03.049 --> 00:29:03.059 align:start position:0%
say to bail Commissioners uh you know
 
00:29:04.909 --> 00:29:04.919 align:start position:0%
sorry but we've we've kind of turned
 
00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
over a new Leaf I I have to say when I
 
00:29:09.529 --> 00:29:09.539 align:start position:0%
was in the court system we went through
 
00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:13.020 align:start position:0%
the same thing uh when Joe Neto was the
 
00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
Chief Justice of the Superior Court this
 
00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:16.620 align:start position:0%
Supply goes back quite a while to the uh
 
00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
00:29:21.669 --> 00:29:21.679 align:start position:0%
uh the late 1990s with court reporters
 
00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
that it just made more more sense to do
 
00:29:28.909 --> 00:29:28.919 align:start position:0%
away with to eliminate the court
 
00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
reporter position and and replace it
 
00:29:33.649 --> 00:29:33.659 align:start position:0%
with court monitors and that was a very
 
00:29:35.149 --> 00:29:35.159 align:start position:0%
tough decision because there were court
 
00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
reporters who were really good and we
 
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
liked them a lot and we you know to say
 
00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:41.940 align:start position:0%
that that your position has kind of
 
00:29:44.510 --> 00:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
outlifted it lived its usefulness is a
 
00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
tough thing to do I understand that
 
00:29:50.149 --> 00:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
um but I do think in terms of what is
 
00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:53.580 align:start position:0%
what is best for the system
 
00:29:57.409 --> 00:29:57.419 align:start position:0%
it makes more sense to have professional
 
00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:01.740 align:start position:0%
uh lawyer-trained judges who have gone
 
00:30:04.549 --> 00:30:04.559 align:start position:0%
through the the vetting process of of
 
00:30:07.549 --> 00:30:07.559 align:start position:0%
being appointed as judges to be deciding
 
00:30:09.409 --> 00:30:09.419 align:start position:0%
questions of taking away somebody's
 
00:30:12.169 --> 00:30:12.179 align:start position:0%
Liberty I think that I think that that
 
00:30:15.889 --> 00:30:15.899 align:start position:0%
makes a you know makes eminent sense and
 
00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:19.740 align:start position:0%
that's the basic reason uh for my uh
 
00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:22.200 align:start position:0%
proposing uh to eliminate the pale
 
00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:24.200 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and and and
 
00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:25.750 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and and and
appoint

00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
appoint
 
00:30:28.669 --> 00:30:28.679 align:start position:0%
additional Circuit Court judges I know
 
00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
you're going to hear from Mr head from
 
00:30:32.389 --> 00:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch and I want to
 
00:30:33.769 --> 00:30:33.779 align:start position:0%
emphasize that
 
00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:35.820 align:start position:0%
the band the judicial branch has
 
00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:37.620 align:start position:0%
concerns which I think are entirely
 
00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:40.380 align:start position:0%
legitimate about timing of any of this
 
00:30:42.889 --> 00:30:42.899 align:start position:0%
whether you agree with my bill I know
 
00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:44.220 align:start position:0%
there's a bill by representative
 
00:30:46.909 --> 00:30:46.919 align:start position:0%
shirtleff who I greatly respect uh that
 
00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:49.260 align:start position:0%
would instead of replacing bail
 
00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:50.700 align:start position:0%
Commissioners with judges would replace
 
00:30:52.549 --> 00:30:52.559 align:start position:0%
them with magistrates
 
00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
I frankly prefer the judge that's why
 
00:30:57.769 --> 00:30:57.779 align:start position:0%
it's in this my my bill but you know
 
00:31:00.409 --> 00:31:00.419 align:start position:0%
that's uh I don't I certainly don't say
 
00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
that that he's just flat wrong with the
 
00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:04.850 align:start position:0%
that that he's just flat wrong with the
magistrates

00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:04.860 align:start position:0%
magistrates
 
00:31:06.769 --> 00:31:06.779 align:start position:0%
but what I want what I would emphasize
 
00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:07.980 align:start position:0%
is I think you're going to hear from Mr
 
00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:10.200 align:start position:0%
head that the judicial branch is
 
00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:13.500 align:start position:0%
concerned about the timing of this how
 
00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:16.140 align:start position:0%
quickly can it be done what resources
 
00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:19.980 align:start position:0%
will they need to do this and I you know
 
00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
those are all entirely legitimate
 
00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:25.140 align:start position:0%
concerns uh and I hope and he's got a
 
00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
lot more current information on that
 
00:31:28.669 --> 00:31:28.679 align:start position:0%
than I do so I would you know I hope
 
00:31:31.789 --> 00:31:31.799 align:start position:0%
you'll you'll give careful consideration
 
00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:34.200 align:start position:0%
to what he has to say and if this you
 
00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
know it may be as an example just as
 
00:31:38.810 --> 00:31:38.820 align:start position:0%
something for you to consider maybe you
 
00:31:40.549 --> 00:31:40.559 align:start position:0%
decide that yes the substantive
 
00:31:42.529 --> 00:31:42.539 align:start position:0%
provisions of the bail reform we should
 
00:31:45.649 --> 00:31:45.659 align:start position:0%
do but we shouldn't make the change on
 
00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
bail Commissioners for a period of time
 
00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
uh so that this can be so that this can
 
00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh that the judicial branch will have
 
00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:55.740 align:start position:0%
time to adopt
 
00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
um and May and maybe you'll say we
 
00:31:59.570 --> 00:31:59.580 align:start position:0%
should we shouldn't do any of this right
 
00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
now we to give the judicial branch time
 
00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
to adopt I
 
00:32:05.269 --> 00:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
um I you know you that's a decision for
 
00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:07.500 align:start position:0%
this committee to make uh and I
 
00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
certainly respect whatever your decision
 
00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:11.340 align:start position:0%
may be in that that's really all I I
 
00:32:12.649 --> 00:32:12.659 align:start position:0%
have to say I'm happy to answer
 
00:32:12.659 --> 00:32:15.830 align:start position:0%
have to say I'm happy to answer
questions

00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:18.049 --> 00:32:18.059 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony uh
 
00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:20.520 align:start position:0%
representative I I have a first question
 
00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
is with regards to replacing the um
 
00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:26.580 align:start position:0%
the bail commercials were judges do you
 
00:32:28.909 --> 00:32:28.919 align:start position:0%
see the judges having the bandwidth to
 
00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:31.140 align:start position:0%
be able to pick up that kind of a load
 
00:32:33.049 --> 00:32:33.059 align:start position:0%
that is currently being carried by the
 
00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:35.340 align:start position:0%
number of bail Commissioners we have
 
00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:37.380 align:start position:0%
I do I mean one of the things that I
 
00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:38.940 align:start position:0%
think and this is probably not for this
 
00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:41.340 align:start position:0%
committee but one of the things that I
 
00:32:42.769 --> 00:32:42.779 align:start position:0%
think Mr head will tell you and it's
 
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
it's absolutely correct is the judicial
 
00:32:48.049 --> 00:32:48.059 align:start position:0%
branch in fact before I started to
 
00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:49.320 align:start position:0%
believe that it's over three years since
 
00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
I left but before I left we the judicial
 
00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:54.120 align:start position:0%
branch decided to to um
 
00:32:58.090 --> 00:32:58.100 align:start position:0%
uh have a new weighted case study done
 
00:33:00.769 --> 00:33:00.779 align:start position:0%
which was not was which was started I
 
00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:01.860 align:start position:0%
think before I left but it was not
 
00:33:03.649 --> 00:33:03.659 align:start position:0%
completed until very recently because of
 
00:33:05.289 --> 00:33:05.299 align:start position:0%
covert and some other things
 
00:33:08.269 --> 00:33:08.279 align:start position:0%
that study shows that the Circuit Court
 
00:33:11.269 --> 00:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
in particular needs you know a
 
00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:14.820 align:start position:0%
significant increase in in judges
 
00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:16.980 align:start position:0%
and I don't have any doubt that they do
 
00:33:20.269 --> 00:33:20.279 align:start position:0%
need an increase in judges so
 
00:33:20.279 --> 00:33:21.409 align:start position:0%
need an increase in judges so
um

00:33:21.409 --> 00:33:21.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:24.409 --> 00:33:24.419 align:start position:0%
and that's before this bill so I you
 
00:33:25.549 --> 00:33:25.559 align:start position:0%
know do they
 
00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:29.700 align:start position:0%
if if we were to impose this bill now
 
00:33:31.549 --> 00:33:31.559 align:start position:0%
without giving them any additional
 
00:33:33.289 --> 00:33:33.299 align:start position:0%
resources the answer is no they wouldn't
 
00:33:34.669 --> 00:33:34.679 align:start position:0%
be able to do it
 
00:33:36.289 --> 00:33:36.299 align:start position:0%
um so I think they do need additional
 
00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:38.820 align:start position:0%
resources my understanding from speaking
 
00:33:40.909 --> 00:33:40.919 align:start position:0%
with Chief Justice McDonald and this was
 
00:33:44.509 --> 00:33:44.519 align:start position:0%
a a while ago and I should say this was
 
00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:46.440 align:start position:0%
not you know
 
00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
I I don't I don't mean to sort of pin
 
00:33:50.149 --> 00:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
him down to this because we were just
 
00:33:52.610 --> 00:33:52.620 align:start position:0%
sort of talking informally but is my
 
00:33:54.169 --> 00:33:54.179 align:start position:0%
from my discussion with him my
 
00:33:56.570 --> 00:33:56.580 align:start position:0%
understanding was that that the judicial
 
00:33:58.190 --> 00:33:58.200 align:start position:0%
branch was going to be asking for seven
 
00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
additional Circuit Court judges without
 
00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
this considering this bill and that if
 
00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:05.580 align:start position:0%
you considered this bill that would
 
00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:07.860 align:start position:0%
require one and a half to two additional
 
00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:10.200 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court judges and I have no
 
00:34:12.169 --> 00:34:12.179 align:start position:0%
reason to doubt that that's correct
 
00:34:13.970 --> 00:34:13.980 align:start position:0%
maybe it's you know maybe maybe they
 
00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
have revised their thinking a little bit
 
00:34:17.089 --> 00:34:17.099 align:start position:0%
on that even you know even more I don't
 
00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
I don't know but but the short short
 
00:34:20.329 --> 00:34:20.339 align:start position:0%
answer to your question is without
 
00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
additional resources no they wouldn't be
 
00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
representative Newman
 
00:34:31.669 --> 00:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
oh with what you just said about the uh
 
00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:34.020 align:start position:0%
the requirements on the court uh would
 
00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
require one and a half or two judges
 
00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:39.300 align:start position:0%
does that take into consideration that
 
00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:41.399 align:start position:0%
the bail Commissioners are available 24
 
00:34:41.399 --> 00:34:42.609 align:start position:0%
the bail Commissioners are available 24
hours

00:34:42.609 --> 00:34:42.619 align:start position:0%
hours
 
00:34:45.169 --> 00:34:45.179 align:start position:0%
non-business hours all the non-business
 
00:34:46.669 --> 00:34:46.679 align:start position:0%
hours right
 
00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:48.540 align:start position:0%
um that seems like a small number to me
 
00:34:51.349 --> 00:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
but I'm not a judge or a lawyer yeah you
 
00:34:54.349 --> 00:34:54.359 align:start position:0%
know well I mean a couple of things to
 
00:34:56.149 --> 00:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
to think about there oh that you know
 
00:34:58.010 --> 00:34:58.020 align:start position:0%
because actually that raises a very very
 
00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
important Point here
 
00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
as you read this as you read this bill
 
00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:07.500 align:start position:0%
understand that this the one of the uh
 
00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:08.050 align:start position:0%
understand that this the one of the uh
the

00:35:08.050 --> 00:35:08.060 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:11.400 align:start position:0%
language in
 
00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:14.940 align:start position:0%
uh let me let me just find it yeah um
 
00:35:18.829 --> 00:35:18.839 align:start position:0%
the language in section four on on page
 
00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
two says that um
 
00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:25.380 align:start position:0%
for example uh all persons direct all
 
00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
persons arrested with or without a
 
00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
warrant for a criminal essential for
 
00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:31.560 align:start position:0%
driving Etc and not released upon a
 
00:35:33.650 --> 00:35:33.660 align:start position:0%
summons to appear
 
00:35:38.089 --> 00:35:38.099 align:start position:0%
so that the you know what what
 
00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:41.640 align:start position:0%
this bill contemplates candidly and
 
00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
although the judicial branch would be
 
00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
able to I suppose the judicial branch
 
00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
would be able to if they wanted to have
 
00:35:50.210 --> 00:35:50.220 align:start position:0%
night court but but my suspicion is they
 
00:35:52.069 --> 00:35:52.079 align:start position:0%
probably would would choose not to do
 
00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:56.040 align:start position:0%
that and so what basically what what the
 
00:35:58.609 --> 00:35:58.619 align:start position:0%
uh what would would happen is the person
 
00:36:02.329 --> 00:36:02.339 align:start position:0%
would if the person was arrested for a
 
00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:04.680 align:start position:0%
serious enough offense that the officer
 
00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:07.140 align:start position:0%
believed the person could not be
 
00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:09.720 align:start position:0%
released on the summons uh you know and
 
00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:12.780 align:start position:0%
that there needed to be some bail they
 
00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
would end up being held until the next
 
00:36:15.770 --> 00:36:15.780 align:start position:0%
more until the next morning when they
 
00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
could be brought before the court which
 
00:36:19.730 --> 00:36:19.740 align:start position:0%
this bill requires that they be brought
 
00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:22.200 align:start position:0%
before the court within 24 hours on the
 
00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:24.180 align:start position:0%
other hand if it was if the officer
 
00:36:27.170 --> 00:36:27.180 align:start position:0%
decided that this was not really a
 
00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
serious enough offense to require the
 
00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
person to be held they could
 
00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:34.740 align:start position:0%
um they could take the person to the
 
00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
police station for purposes of
 
00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
processing but then release them on a
 
00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:39.349 align:start position:0%
processing but then release them on a
sum

00:36:39.349 --> 00:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
sum
 
00:36:41.329 --> 00:36:41.339 align:start position:0%
and that would be up to the you know
 
00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:49.320 align:start position:0%
and just as a follow-up so they're
 
00:36:51.770 --> 00:36:51.780 align:start position:0%
required to be to see the court within
 
00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
24 hours right so now we have the
 
00:36:57.829 --> 00:36:57.839 align:start position:0%
situation where it's uh an event where
 
00:37:00.170 --> 00:37:00.180 align:start position:0%
the police think he's going to be held
 
00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
but now it's midnight on Friday
 
00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
how does that square with 24 hours and
 
00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
the possibility that there's not a
 
00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
availability of a court appearance until
 
00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
perhaps the following Tuesday right that
 
00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
well there this I this does accept
 
00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
weekends and holidays so you're I mean
 
00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
you're right there could be there could
 
00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:22.020 align:start position:0%
be a situation where a person would be
 
00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
held until until uh Monday morning
 
00:37:29.930 --> 00:37:29.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:31.980 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:33.480 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:37:38.089 --> 00:37:38.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:40.370 --> 00:37:40.380 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:42.349 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
uh

00:37:42.349 --> 00:37:42.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:37:44.810 --> 00:37:44.820 align:start position:0%
I'm going back to when I was in criminal
 
00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
justice when I was in college and my
 
00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
understanding is the Justice of the
 
00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:51.109 align:start position:0%
understanding is the Justice of the
Peace

00:37:51.109 --> 00:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
Peace
 
00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
is the person that is a bill
 
00:37:54.410 --> 00:37:54.420 align:start position:0%
commissioner and that justice of the
 
00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
peace is appointed by the circuit court
 
00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
judge War by the superior court judge to
 
00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
commission bails
 
00:38:04.609 --> 00:38:04.619 align:start position:0%
um is that still how it works yeah no
 
00:38:06.290 --> 00:38:06.300 align:start position:0%
that's that's right it is
 
00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
and as a follow-up
 
00:38:10.849 --> 00:38:10.859 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh as a follow-up
 
00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
to that
 
00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:15.480 align:start position:0%
um if a circuit court or Superior Court
 
00:38:17.089 --> 00:38:17.099 align:start position:0%
Justice finds that that bill
 
00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner is not doing his job in an
 
00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:23.400 align:start position:0%
acceptable manner to the court is there
 
00:38:27.109 --> 00:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
a way to replace them very quickly
 
00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
I don't know about very quickly but
 
00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
there are I mean if somebody is not
 
00:38:33.109 --> 00:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
doing their job this short the circuit I
 
00:38:35.089 --> 00:38:35.099 align:start position:0%
mean the the court you know the court
 
00:38:39.410 --> 00:38:39.420 align:start position:0%
can could take action to uh to remove
 
00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:43.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:45.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for the follow-up
 
00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh and one last question for you um Mr
 
00:38:50.930 --> 00:38:50.940 align:start position:0%
representative is
 
00:38:54.170 --> 00:38:54.180 align:start position:0%
um that a bill I'm sorry a justice of
 
00:38:57.890 --> 00:38:57.900 align:start position:0%
the peace is vetted by the Secretary of
 
00:39:00.589 --> 00:39:00.599 align:start position:0%
State the governor and council is that
 
00:39:03.650 --> 00:39:03.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:05.510 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:07.970 --> 00:39:07.980 align:start position:0%
yeah in a manner of speaking yes that's
 
00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
true that's certainly not in any way the
 
00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:13.140 align:start position:0%
same level of vetting that occurs with a
 
00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:30.349 --> 00:39:30.359 align:start position:0%
okay I'm looking at page four
 
00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:37.250 --> 00:39:37.260 align:start position:0%
it says three more times within the past
 
00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:38.460 align:start position:0%
five years
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
that's going to uh driving in pay it our
 
00:39:43.010 --> 00:39:43.020 align:start position:0%
other felonies the class A misdemeanors
 
00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:45.660 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm having trouble here so the
 
00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
question is uh on line 25 three or more
 
00:39:52.430 --> 00:39:52.440 align:start position:0%
times 25 and 26 and Page four
 
00:39:55.849 --> 00:39:55.859 align:start position:0%
okay within the last five years
 
00:39:58.250 --> 00:39:58.260 align:start position:0%
or I failed to appear twice in a present
 
00:39:59.630 --> 00:39:59.640 align:start position:0%
case so we're giving them three times
 
00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:06.109 --> 00:40:06.119 align:start position:0%
well we're giving them we're giving
 
00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
we're giving three times before there
 
00:40:10.130 --> 00:40:10.140 align:start position:0%
would be a rebuttable presumption
 
00:40:12.530 --> 00:40:12.540 align:start position:0%
and I I would say the the person
 
00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:13.730 align:start position:0%
and I I would say the the person
whatever

00:40:13.730 --> 00:40:13.740 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:40:15.770 --> 00:40:15.780 align:start position:0%
whenever a person appears before the
 
00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:17.700 align:start position:0%
court the court obvious you know is
 
00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
gonna will consider the issue of bail I
 
00:40:22.970 --> 00:40:22.980 align:start position:0%
think this really is is addressing the
 
00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:24.680 align:start position:0%
situations where a rebuttable
 
00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:27.720 align:start position:0%
presumption would arise so that it would
 
00:40:29.950 --> 00:40:29.960 align:start position:0%
be the it would be the defendant's
 
00:40:34.310 --> 00:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
obligation to rebut the presumption
 
00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:36.660 align:start position:0%
so to clarify that that just means the
 
00:40:39.349 --> 00:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
burden on the defendant is raised after
 
00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:41.940 align:start position:0%
the third offense to to
 
00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
um to get bail right in other words the
 
00:40:47.329 --> 00:40:47.339 align:start position:0%
state can come in in that situation and
 
00:40:49.370 --> 00:40:49.380 align:start position:0%
and prove the state has to prove that
 
00:40:51.109 --> 00:40:51.119 align:start position:0%
there were the three you know the three
 
00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
essentially but once the state proves
 
00:40:56.030 --> 00:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
the the three offenses let's say the
 
00:40:59.450 --> 00:40:59.460 align:start position:0%
state can sit down basically and say you
 
00:41:00.829 --> 00:41:00.839 align:start position:0%
know your honor based on this we think
 
00:41:02.329 --> 00:41:02.339 align:start position:0%
you should hold it and send it now it's
 
00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
the defendant he may offer evidence if
 
00:41:06.589 --> 00:41:06.599 align:start position:0%
he or she wants to but doesn't have to
 
00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:09.060 align:start position:0%
and then the judge will decide whether
 
00:41:13.490 --> 00:41:13.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:17.210 --> 00:41:17.220 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative Reed
 
00:41:19.130 --> 00:41:19.140 align:start position:0%
so it's my understanding that bail
 
00:41:20.930 --> 00:41:20.940 align:start position:0%
Commissioners already work under the
 
00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
direction of a judge and they have
 
00:41:26.569 --> 00:41:26.579 align:start position:0%
guidelines to follow as how to charge
 
00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:30.300 align:start position:0%
um bail and when to hold somebody
 
00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
um they there are many more bail
 
00:41:35.450 --> 00:41:35.460 align:start position:0%
Commissioners than circuit judges so my
 
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
concern is that two one it's going to be
 
00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:41.460 align:start position:0%
so much more expensive on the taxpayers
 
00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
to replace Commissioners with circuit
 
00:41:46.970 --> 00:41:46.980 align:start position:0%
judges or magistrates and
 
00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:47.930 align:start position:0%
judges or magistrates and
um

00:41:47.930 --> 00:41:47.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
the defendant and the police are going
 
00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:52.500 align:start position:0%
to have to wait so much longer for any
 
00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:55.260 align:start position:0%
kind of service and if it is it's most
 
00:41:57.290 --> 00:41:57.300 align:start position:0%
likely going to be by phone whereas
 
00:42:00.410 --> 00:42:00.420 align:start position:0%
Commissioners show up in person correct
 
00:42:02.569 --> 00:42:02.579 align:start position:0%
I believe that they do show up in person
 
00:42:06.109 --> 00:42:06.119 align:start position:0%
yes and you know as far as the I I you
 
00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
know I
 
00:42:09.290 --> 00:42:09.300 align:start position:0%
ask anybody for anybody who knows I'm
 
00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:12.660 align:start position:0%
I'm certainly someone who who is very
 
00:42:15.109 --> 00:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
much in favor of the idea of keeping
 
00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
government spending and government
 
00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:19.980 align:start position:0%
itself small but it does seem to me this
 
00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
is sort of a fundamental
 
00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
role of government deciding whether
 
00:42:27.829 --> 00:42:27.839 align:start position:0%
somebody should be released or stayed in
 
00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
jail and there is you know there have
 
00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:33.660 align:start position:0%
been some issues with bail Commissioners
 
00:42:36.050 --> 00:42:36.060 align:start position:0%
as I say I think I think that there are
 
00:42:37.550 --> 00:42:37.560 align:start position:0%
some bail Commissioners are very good
 
00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
there are others that are not so good
 
00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:46.970 --> 00:42:46.980 align:start position:0%
I think having a more professional uh
 
00:42:50.089 --> 00:42:50.099 align:start position:0%
role uh in making that determination
 
00:42:58.550 --> 00:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:59.390 --> 00:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:43:02.210 --> 00:43:02.220 align:start position:0%
do you have any data on on
 
00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
cases that might have been mishandled by
 
00:43:06.410 --> 00:43:06.420 align:start position:0%
Commissioners is it
 
00:43:09.589 --> 00:43:09.599 align:start position:0%
one in a hundred interactions one in ten
 
00:43:11.809 --> 00:43:11.819 align:start position:0%
do you have any data I don't have that
 
00:43:13.609 --> 00:43:13.619 align:start position:0%
data and I don't know whether the
 
00:43:15.290 --> 00:43:15.300 align:start position:0%
whether Mr had or someone from the
 
00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
judicial branch would have that but that
 
00:43:19.609 --> 00:43:19.619 align:start position:0%
but you know you should certainly ask
 
00:43:23.690 --> 00:43:23.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony this
 
00:43:31.069 --> 00:43:31.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:33.109 --> 00:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
this time the clerk recognize excuse me
 
00:43:35.569 --> 00:43:35.579 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes uh Richard head
 
00:43:42.890 --> 00:43:42.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:45.060 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman good morning
 
00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
00:43:48.170 --> 00:43:48.180 align:start position:0%
Richard head I'm the government Affairs
 
00:43:50.809 --> 00:43:50.819 align:start position:0%
coordinator for the judicial branch
 
00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
to start we have no position on the
 
00:43:56.210 --> 00:43:56.220 align:start position:0%
policy of this bill there are at least
 
00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:00.300 align:start position:0%
my count I believe seven bail reform
 
00:44:03.290 --> 00:44:03.300 align:start position:0%
bills that are that are out there
 
00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:04.680 align:start position:0%
between the house and the Senate
 
00:44:07.130 --> 00:44:07.140 align:start position:0%
versions I did want to briefly talk
 
00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
about and I appreciate representative
 
00:44:11.390 --> 00:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
Lynn's comments relative to the
 
00:44:14.930 --> 00:44:14.940 align:start position:0%
resources and the timing as it impacts
 
00:44:16.970 --> 00:44:16.980 align:start position:0%
the Circuit Court
 
00:44:19.069 --> 00:44:19.079 align:start position:0%
a couple things just to recognize with
 
00:44:21.470 --> 00:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
regard to Circuit Court
 
00:44:24.530 --> 00:44:24.540 align:start position:0%
um as as representative Lynn mentioned
 
00:44:27.650 --> 00:44:27.660 align:start position:0%
we've recently undertaken a waited time
 
00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:32.700 align:start position:0%
case study analysis and that shows a
 
00:44:35.630 --> 00:44:35.640 align:start position:0%
significant shortage of shortage of both
 
00:44:39.410 --> 00:44:39.420 align:start position:0%
judges and and I want to emphasize staff
 
00:44:42.410 --> 00:44:42.420 align:start position:0%
because at the end of the day anything a
 
00:44:44.930 --> 00:44:44.940 align:start position:0%
judge receives or does is ultimately
 
00:44:47.569 --> 00:44:47.579 align:start position:0%
getting passed through someone in the
 
00:44:49.970 --> 00:44:49.980 align:start position:0%
clerk's office and there is also a
 
00:44:52.069 --> 00:44:52.079 align:start position:0%
significant both
 
00:44:56.450 --> 00:44:56.460 align:start position:0%
shortage of clerks even at full capacity
 
00:44:59.150 --> 00:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
but we like everybody else in the
 
00:45:02.210 --> 00:45:02.220 align:start position:0%
country is experiencing the inability to
 
00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
bring in enough people to fill all those
 
00:45:06.829 --> 00:45:06.839 align:start position:0%
slots that we currently have
 
00:45:09.050 --> 00:45:09.060 align:start position:0%
just some numbers and I apologize for
 
00:45:11.089 --> 00:45:11.099 align:start position:0%
throwing out some numbers
 
00:45:13.730 --> 00:45:13.740 align:start position:0%
criminal cases filed in the Circuit
 
00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:16.140 align:start position:0%
Court alone we're talking roughly on an
 
00:45:19.630 --> 00:45:19.640 align:start position:0%
annual basis between 60 and 80 000 cases
 
00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of cases that get pushed
 
00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
through the Circuit Court last session
 
00:45:28.430 --> 00:45:28.440 align:start position:0%
you also authorized and approved the
 
00:45:30.589 --> 00:45:30.599 align:start position:0%
repeal of what was called felonies first
 
00:45:33.770 --> 00:45:33.780 align:start position:0%
and felonies first was implemented in I
 
00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:37.400 align:start position:0%
think 2015 in that
 
00:45:40.069 --> 00:45:40.079 align:start position:0%
changed the process that had existed and
 
00:45:42.589 --> 00:45:42.599 align:start position:0%
put all felonies felonies would
 
00:45:45.109 --> 00:45:45.119 align:start position:0%
originate in Superior Court so those
 
00:45:47.210 --> 00:45:47.220 align:start position:0%
would not be initiated through the
 
00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court
 
00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:51.720 align:start position:0%
the repeal of felonies first means that
 
00:45:53.930 --> 00:45:53.940 align:start position:0%
all of those felonies that are currently
 
00:45:56.329 --> 00:45:56.339 align:start position:0%
starting in this in the Superior Court
 
00:45:59.870 --> 00:45:59.880 align:start position:0%
will now begin in the circuit court that
 
00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
adds roughly another nine to ten
 
00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
thousand cases that are coming into the
 
00:46:06.650 --> 00:46:06.660 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court which is already
 
00:46:09.490 --> 00:46:09.500 align:start position:0%
experiencing some severe
 
00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
shortages both in terms of Staff in in
 
00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
judicial resources
 
00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:17.640 align:start position:0%
if we take for example in representative
 
00:46:22.609 --> 00:46:22.619 align:start position:0%
Lynn's Bill page 3 line 19 which is the
 
00:46:24.890 --> 00:46:24.900 align:start position:0%
list of crimes and this is a list that's
 
00:46:28.609 --> 00:46:28.619 align:start position:0%
that's in a number of the of the bills
 
00:46:30.349 --> 00:46:30.359 align:start position:0%
that you'll see both in the Senate and
 
00:46:31.609 --> 00:46:31.619 align:start position:0%
House side
 
00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
if you take just that list of of crimes
 
00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
we roughly estimate and if these are all
 
00:46:39.770 --> 00:46:39.780 align:start position:0%
estimates based on sort of past
 
00:46:42.770 --> 00:46:42.780 align:start position:0%
experience that will result without
 
00:46:45.349 --> 00:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
regard to Bringing felonies first into
 
00:46:47.690 --> 00:46:47.700 align:start position:0%
the circuit court so pretending felonies
 
00:46:52.609 --> 00:46:52.619 align:start position:0%
first still exist about 2500 new bail
 
00:46:55.130 --> 00:46:55.140 align:start position:0%
hearings before a judge
 
00:46:57.650 --> 00:46:57.660 align:start position:0%
not currently in front of the judge if
 
00:47:00.170 --> 00:47:00.180 align:start position:0%
you sort of estimate
 
00:47:02.809 --> 00:47:02.819 align:start position:0%
again rough number is not saying this is
 
00:47:04.490 --> 00:47:04.500 align:start position:0%
a per case let's say they're very
 
00:47:06.589 --> 00:47:06.599 align:start position:0%
efficient very quick six minutes per
 
00:47:06.599 --> 00:47:07.750 align:start position:0%
efficient very quick six minutes per
hearing

00:47:07.750 --> 00:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:47:10.849 --> 00:47:10.859 align:start position:0%
2500 hearings that has to incorporate
 
00:47:13.849 --> 00:47:13.859 align:start position:0%
900 000 minutes into the system
 
00:47:19.130 --> 00:47:19.140 align:start position:0%
and it's a system that is full so my
 
00:47:22.849 --> 00:47:22.859 align:start position:0%
only my only message is
 
00:47:25.069 --> 00:47:25.079 align:start position:0%
bail reform and and what you're talking
 
00:47:28.130 --> 00:47:28.140 align:start position:0%
with regard to these bills also has to
 
00:47:31.190 --> 00:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
be considered against how those get
 
00:47:34.069 --> 00:47:34.079 align:start position:0%
absorbed into the system ultimately
 
00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
and and our request isn't with regard to
 
00:47:40.609 --> 00:47:40.619 align:start position:0%
the policy I understand and appreciate
 
00:47:42.829 --> 00:47:42.839 align:start position:0%
that a bill probably will come out of
 
00:47:45.530 --> 00:47:45.540 align:start position:0%
the house of some sort
 
00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:46.550 align:start position:0%
the house of some sort
um

00:47:46.550 --> 00:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
what I'm asking is and and next week I'm
 
00:47:52.010 --> 00:47:52.020 align:start position:0%
just going to reference a bill I know
 
00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
it's not the bill in front of you today
 
00:47:56.210 --> 00:47:56.220 align:start position:0%
House Bill 46 is a bill that would
 
00:47:58.309 --> 00:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
authorize magistrates
 
00:48:00.770 --> 00:48:00.780 align:start position:0%
it does seem to make sense to take some
 
00:48:03.589 --> 00:48:03.599 align:start position:0%
time with representative Lynn's bill and
 
00:48:05.569 --> 00:48:05.579 align:start position:0%
the magistrate bill because they both
 
00:48:07.490 --> 00:48:07.500 align:start position:0%
relate very well with each other because
 
00:48:09.650 --> 00:48:09.660 align:start position:0%
if you take the rest of Representative
 
00:48:12.770 --> 00:48:12.780 align:start position:0%
Lynn's bill it essentially says not only
 
00:48:15.230 --> 00:48:15.240 align:start position:0%
those 2500 new hearings that are going
 
00:48:17.569 --> 00:48:17.579 align:start position:0%
to come in under that list on page three
 
00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
but all of all the ones that the bail
 
00:48:22.849 --> 00:48:22.859 align:start position:0%
Commissioners are currently addressing
 
00:48:25.309 --> 00:48:25.319 align:start position:0%
in the first instance would also flow
 
00:48:28.069 --> 00:48:28.079 align:start position:0%
into the superior into the Circuit Court
 
00:48:30.109 --> 00:48:30.119 align:start position:0%
and that is
 
00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
um that is a struggle if that's what we
 
00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
have to do we'll do it and anytime you
 
00:48:38.569 --> 00:48:38.579 align:start position:0%
put something that has tight deadlines
 
00:48:40.910 --> 00:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
mandatory deadlines which you start to
 
00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
talk about when you're in the criminal
 
00:48:44.690 --> 00:48:44.700 align:start position:0%
world you start to think okay what does
 
00:48:46.309 --> 00:48:46.319 align:start position:0%
not get done what does not get hurt
 
00:48:48.530 --> 00:48:48.540 align:start position:0%
because you have a set number of hours
 
00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
in the day that hearings can be held
 
00:48:53.089 --> 00:48:53.099 align:start position:0%
that pushes other things down the road
 
00:48:55.849 --> 00:48:55.859 align:start position:0%
the things that don't have those type of
 
00:48:57.770 --> 00:48:57.780 align:start position:0%
constitutional or statutory deadlines
 
00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:00.180 align:start position:0%
and we're trying to avoid that but if we
 
00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
had to absorb it we would and we would
 
00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:04.680 align:start position:0%
figure out a way of doing it
 
00:49:07.609 --> 00:49:07.619 align:start position:0%
the repeal of felonies first
 
00:49:10.970 --> 00:49:10.980 align:start position:0%
in terms of the management just of the
 
00:49:12.890 --> 00:49:12.900 align:start position:0%
administration of that between now and
 
00:49:15.710 --> 00:49:15.720 align:start position:0%
January 1 when that becomes effective we
 
00:49:18.349 --> 00:49:18.359 align:start position:0%
have staff that are are working on this
 
00:49:21.410 --> 00:49:21.420 align:start position:0%
continuously it is a very complicated
 
00:49:23.870 --> 00:49:23.880 align:start position:0%
process from a court administration side
 
00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:26.940 align:start position:0%
of things and so just that repeal of
 
00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:31.020 align:start position:0%
felonies first has absorbed a great deal
 
00:49:34.069 --> 00:49:34.079 align:start position:0%
of time and capacity within the
 
00:49:36.170 --> 00:49:36.180 align:start position:0%
administrative staff of of the court
 
00:49:36.180 --> 00:49:37.130 align:start position:0%
administrative staff of of the court
system

00:49:37.130 --> 00:49:37.140 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:49:40.370 --> 00:49:40.380 align:start position:0%
if we were to add on top of that
 
00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
putting in a new magistrate system
 
00:49:45.290 --> 00:49:45.300 align:start position:0%
putting in X number of additional
 
00:49:49.130 --> 00:49:49.140 align:start position:0%
hearings into the system it is a lot to
 
00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:50.210 align:start position:0%
hearings into the system it is a lot to
absorb

00:49:50.210 --> 00:49:50.220 align:start position:0%
absorb
 
00:49:53.569 --> 00:49:53.579 align:start position:0%
and we we just ask about uh ask you to
 
00:49:56.329 --> 00:49:56.339 align:start position:0%
consider that kind of absorption of
 
00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
additional uh caseload you'll hear in
 
00:50:01.970 --> 00:50:01.980 align:start position:0%
when the when the Chief Justice
 
00:50:04.490 --> 00:50:04.500 align:start position:0%
ultimately is talking about the budget
 
00:50:07.250 --> 00:50:07.260 align:start position:0%
proposal that he wants to present he
 
00:50:09.290 --> 00:50:09.300 align:start position:0%
does try to address these shortfalls
 
00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
through the budget through staff through
 
00:50:13.250 --> 00:50:13.260 align:start position:0%
judges and you'll hear about that
 
00:50:16.130 --> 00:50:16.140 align:start position:0%
weighted case study
 
00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:16.790 align:start position:0%
weighted case study
um

00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:19.970 --> 00:50:19.980 align:start position:0%
but it is a lot to take in so our
 
00:50:22.430 --> 00:50:22.440 align:start position:0%
overall ask is
 
00:50:24.650 --> 00:50:24.660 align:start position:0%
that at least some of these bills and I
 
00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:26.940 align:start position:0%
would say specifically this bill and
 
00:50:29.089 --> 00:50:29.099 align:start position:0%
next week I would do the same on the
 
00:50:31.490 --> 00:50:31.500 align:start position:0%
magistrate Bill ask that either they'd
 
00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:33.480 align:start position:0%
be retained or brought together as a
 
00:50:35.930 --> 00:50:35.940 align:start position:0%
study so that this can be done somewhat
 
00:50:38.569 --> 00:50:38.579 align:start position:0%
thoughtfully that we have a true sort of
 
00:50:41.569 --> 00:50:41.579 align:start position:0%
financial evaluation get some input from
 
00:50:43.790 --> 00:50:43.800 align:start position:0%
the bail from the bail Commissioners get
 
00:50:45.470 --> 00:50:45.480 align:start position:0%
some data from the bail Commissioners
 
00:50:48.490 --> 00:50:48.500 align:start position:0%
and have a more
 
00:50:50.569 --> 00:50:50.579 align:start position:0%
substantive conversation that I think
 
00:50:52.370 --> 00:50:52.380 align:start position:0%
you can have in the context of these
 
00:50:56.569 --> 00:50:56.579 align:start position:0%
hearings so our ask is is that this bill
 
00:50:58.670 --> 00:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
and again I'll ask you next week and
 
00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:00.720 align:start position:0%
I've spoken with with the prime sponsors
 
00:51:02.930 --> 00:51:02.940 align:start position:0%
of both those bills
 
00:51:05.210 --> 00:51:05.220 align:start position:0%
um that they'd be at least retained if
 
00:51:07.730 --> 00:51:07.740 align:start position:0%
not converted into a study
 
00:51:10.490 --> 00:51:10.500 align:start position:0%
um I know you have a lot to do I will um
 
00:51:12.410 --> 00:51:12.420 align:start position:0%
in my comments there and be happy to
 
00:51:15.230 --> 00:51:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:17.690 --> 00:51:17.700 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and taking
 
00:51:19.309 --> 00:51:19.319 align:start position:0%
our questions
 
00:51:21.170 --> 00:51:21.180 align:start position:0%
um so basically what the court is saying
 
00:51:23.809 --> 00:51:23.819 align:start position:0%
is would you please let us Implement
 
00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
what you told us to do last year before
 
00:51:26.770 --> 00:51:26.780 align:start position:0%
you tell us to do something else
 
00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
we're working on it thank you
 
00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:33.900 align:start position:0%
representative selig
 
00:51:35.930 --> 00:51:35.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I have a two-part
 
00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:37.970 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I have a two-part
question

00:51:37.970 --> 00:51:37.980 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:41.160 align:start position:0%
um just wondering right now do the
 
00:51:43.730 --> 00:51:43.740 align:start position:0%
courts have enough physical space for
 
00:51:45.589 --> 00:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
all the hearings that they need to have
 
00:51:49.730 --> 00:51:49.740 align:start position:0%
without adding additional delays
 
00:51:50.930 --> 00:51:50.940 align:start position:0%
um so thank you for the question it's a
 
00:51:52.849 --> 00:51:52.859 align:start position:0%
great question so
 
00:51:54.589 --> 00:51:54.599 align:start position:0%
offhand I don't know the answer
 
00:51:57.410 --> 00:51:57.420 align:start position:0%
certainly some courts that is an issue
 
00:52:00.589 --> 00:52:00.599 align:start position:0%
Rochester for example is a Court Circuit
 
00:52:02.270 --> 00:52:02.280 align:start position:0%
Court and I'm talking circuit courts in
 
00:52:05.210 --> 00:52:05.220 align:start position:0%
this answer is a circuit court that is
 
00:52:07.069 --> 00:52:07.079 align:start position:0%
actually divided so that some of the
 
00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court matters have to be heard
 
00:52:10.609 --> 00:52:10.619 align:start position:0%
in the spirit court building different
 
00:52:13.130 --> 00:52:13.140 align:start position:0%
building actually a different town than
 
00:52:15.770 --> 00:52:15.780 align:start position:0%
in Rochester so there are some space
 
00:52:18.790 --> 00:52:18.800 align:start position:0%
issues we're trying to address Rochester
 
00:52:22.670 --> 00:52:22.680 align:start position:0%
last year there was money put in for
 
00:52:24.410 --> 00:52:24.420 align:start position:0%
engineering study this year there's
 
00:52:27.829 --> 00:52:27.839 align:start position:0%
money in the proposed in the budget to
 
00:52:29.930 --> 00:52:29.940 align:start position:0%
build a new courthouse for the Rochester
 
00:52:32.870 --> 00:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
that's one we have a number of
 
00:52:34.670 --> 00:52:34.680 align:start position:0%
courthouses where there are some
 
00:52:39.290 --> 00:52:39.300 align:start position:0%
capacity issues mask follow-up Mr
 
00:52:41.569 --> 00:52:41.579 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the follow-up um if we
 
00:52:44.089 --> 00:52:44.099 align:start position:0%
were to implement this bill in some
 
00:52:46.370 --> 00:52:46.380 align:start position:0%
capacity with some amendments
 
00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
um how many Circuit Court judges and
 
00:52:51.170 --> 00:52:51.180 align:start position:0%
staff do you think you would actually
 
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
need to add in order to cover the
 
00:52:56.329 --> 00:52:56.339 align:start position:0%
increased caseload
 
00:53:00.049 --> 00:53:00.059 align:start position:0%
um so thank you so uh the bill
 
00:53:04.130 --> 00:53:04.140 align:start position:0%
um uh specifically uh says three judges
 
00:53:04.140 --> 00:53:05.150 align:start position:0%
um uh specifically uh says three judges
um

00:53:05.150 --> 00:53:05.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:08.450 --> 00:53:08.460 align:start position:0%
so we have more than three courthouses
 
00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:09.470 align:start position:0%
so we have more than three courthouses
um

00:53:09.470 --> 00:53:09.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:12.670 --> 00:53:12.680 align:start position:0%
if we looked just at the busiest
 
00:53:16.010 --> 00:53:16.020 align:start position:0%
courthouses for criminal filings we're
 
00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
talking as you would expect Southern
 
00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:18.910 align:start position:0%
talking as you would expect Southern
Tier

00:53:18.910 --> 00:53:18.920 align:start position:0%
Tier
 
00:53:21.530 --> 00:53:21.540 align:start position:0%
the busiest I think our Nashua
 
00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
Manchester Concord Rochester and I would
 
00:53:26.270 --> 00:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
add Keen into that
 
00:53:28.309 --> 00:53:28.319 align:start position:0%
um so you're talking at least those
 
00:53:31.450 --> 00:53:31.460 align:start position:0%
courthouses probably need a judge but
 
00:53:33.650 --> 00:53:33.660 align:start position:0%
and this is
 
00:53:36.109 --> 00:53:36.119 align:start position:0%
to be very clear on top of sort of
 
00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
existing loads so when the chief is
 
00:53:40.250 --> 00:53:40.260 align:start position:0%
presenting his budget he's talking
 
00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
current sort of loads
 
00:53:45.230 --> 00:53:45.240 align:start position:0%
um and then when we get into staff I'm
 
00:53:46.670 --> 00:53:46.680 align:start position:0%
talking about staff
 
00:53:49.430 --> 00:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
you know we would be talking about
 
00:53:51.890 --> 00:53:51.900 align:start position:0%
a great deal of work and I don't want to
 
00:53:53.630 --> 00:53:53.640 align:start position:0%
minimize this the work that is done by
 
00:53:55.370 --> 00:53:55.380 align:start position:0%
the bail Commissioners there's a great
 
00:53:59.690 --> 00:53:59.700 align:start position:0%
deal of paperwork time spent by bail
 
00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
Commissioners that would be moved into
 
00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
the clerk court staff in that paperwork
 
00:54:08.770 --> 00:54:08.780 align:start position:0%
the the work that that goes along with
 
00:54:10.970 --> 00:54:10.980 align:start position:0%
deciding bail that the judges are doing
 
00:54:13.250 --> 00:54:13.260 align:start position:0%
would get incorporated into court staff
 
00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:14.870 align:start position:0%
would get incorporated into court staff
again

00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:17.640 align:start position:0%
while all ports would be impacted again
 
00:54:19.790 --> 00:54:19.800 align:start position:0%
the courts with the largest criminal
 
00:54:22.849 --> 00:54:22.859 align:start position:0%
load would be impacted more
 
00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
um so I think you that's that's where
 
00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
most of the resources would would need
 
00:54:28.790 --> 00:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
to be focused but throughout the system
 
00:54:31.130 --> 00:54:31.140 align:start position:0%
there would be resource limitations to
 
00:54:33.109 --> 00:54:33.119 align:start position:0%
answer your question specifically is it
 
00:54:35.270 --> 00:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
two staff three and don't actually have
 
00:54:38.030 --> 00:54:38.040 align:start position:0%
a good sense of that yet and part of of
 
00:54:40.970 --> 00:54:40.980 align:start position:0%
the goal of looking to either study or
 
00:54:43.849 --> 00:54:43.859 align:start position:0%
retain is to have one sense of what is
 
00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:45.480 align:start position:0%
going to pass so we know sort of what
 
00:54:46.730 --> 00:54:46.740 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with or we're dealing with
 
00:54:48.349 --> 00:54:48.359 align:start position:0%
the list of crimes or are we dealing
 
00:54:50.210 --> 00:54:50.220 align:start position:0%
with all crimes
 
00:54:53.210 --> 00:54:53.220 align:start position:0%
um and and that sort of information Gap
 
00:54:55.849 --> 00:54:55.859 align:start position:0%
is is just hard to then put some data
 
00:54:55.859 --> 00:54:57.710 align:start position:0%
is is just hard to then put some data
together

00:54:57.710 --> 00:54:57.720 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:55:00.829 --> 00:55:00.839 align:start position:0%
representative Newman
 
00:55:02.510 --> 00:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:04.130 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
question

00:55:04.130 --> 00:55:04.140 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:55:06.109 --> 00:55:06.119 align:start position:0%
um and when you are gathering your
 
00:55:08.030 --> 00:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
statistics your stuff and I'm trying to
 
00:55:09.890 --> 00:55:09.900 align:start position:0%
think about due process it seems like
 
00:55:13.130 --> 00:55:13.140 align:start position:0%
the 24 I I believe they said that the 75
 
00:55:16.910 --> 00:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
hours 72 hours in the bill that we have
 
00:55:20.450 --> 00:55:20.460 align:start position:0%
now was changed to 24 hours so it seems
 
00:55:22.790 --> 00:55:22.800 align:start position:0%
like that's workable on it on weekdays
 
00:55:25.849 --> 00:55:25.859 align:start position:0%
on the weekends not so much
 
00:55:29.450 --> 00:55:29.460 align:start position:0%
so when you were collecting data did you
 
00:55:31.970 --> 00:55:31.980 align:start position:0%
all right would you consider are you
 
00:55:34.010 --> 00:55:34.020 align:start position:0%
considering a systems if you're going to
 
00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
take the bail Commissioners away
 
00:55:38.990 --> 00:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
that whether it's a magistrate or a
 
00:55:40.970 --> 00:55:40.980 align:start position:0%
judge that replaces the bail
 
00:55:43.010 --> 00:55:43.020 align:start position:0%
Commissioners that there would be the
 
00:55:46.549 --> 00:55:46.559 align:start position:0%
same access to due process that people
 
00:55:49.130 --> 00:55:49.140 align:start position:0%
have now with the bail Commissioners so
 
00:55:52.190 --> 00:55:52.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question with
 
00:55:54.290 --> 00:55:54.300 align:start position:0%
um when we're contemplating magistrates
 
00:55:56.270 --> 00:55:56.280 align:start position:0%
and you heard a lot about from me
 
00:55:58.190 --> 00:55:58.200 align:start position:0%
magistrates last session in the context
 
00:56:01.370 --> 00:56:01.380 align:start position:0%
of the bail reforms and and support for
 
00:56:02.950 --> 00:56:02.960 align:start position:0%
that we were
 
00:56:05.150 --> 00:56:05.160 align:start position:0%
contemplating it would be available 24
 
00:56:08.329 --> 00:56:08.339 align:start position:0%
hours a day seven days a week we were
 
00:56:09.890 --> 00:56:09.900 align:start position:0%
contemplating they would not be in
 
00:56:13.609 --> 00:56:13.619 align:start position:0%
person events that they would be trans
 
00:56:16.790 --> 00:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
they would become remote events
 
00:56:19.490 --> 00:56:19.500 align:start position:0%
um but those in that context we kind of
 
00:56:22.370 --> 00:56:22.380 align:start position:0%
laid 24 7 with regard to judges the
 
00:56:25.370 --> 00:56:25.380 align:start position:0%
answer would be court hours uh five days
 
00:56:34.490 --> 00:56:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:37.010 --> 00:56:37.020 align:start position:0%
yeah I had trouble turning the mic on
 
00:56:39.530 --> 00:56:39.540 align:start position:0%
so so the judges I just wanted a
 
00:56:42.950 --> 00:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
clarification the judges would be would
 
00:56:45.109 --> 00:56:45.119 align:start position:0%
be quarter hours and magistrates would
 
00:56:48.770 --> 00:56:48.780 align:start position:0%
be 24 hours a day and possibly all
 
00:56:52.750 --> 00:56:52.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:55.190 --> 00:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
it's a great Echo chamber you have here
 
00:56:57.770 --> 00:56:57.780 align:start position:0%
I couldn't quite catch the end of it
 
00:56:59.930 --> 00:56:59.940 align:start position:0%
the with the judges it would be
 
00:57:02.329 --> 00:57:02.339 align:start position:0%
considered court hours and with the
 
00:57:04.250 --> 00:57:04.260 align:start position:0%
magistrates you took into consideration
 
00:57:07.250 --> 00:57:07.260 align:start position:0%
in your calculations that it would be 24
 
00:57:10.250 --> 00:57:10.260 align:start position:0%
hours a day but potentially telephonic
 
00:57:12.049 --> 00:57:12.059 align:start position:0%
would be mixed in with that is that
 
00:57:12.059 --> 00:57:13.309 align:start position:0%
would be mixed in with that is that
correct

00:57:13.309 --> 00:57:13.319 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:57:16.670 --> 00:57:16.680 align:start position:0%
yes I think that that's right thank you
 
00:57:19.549 --> 00:57:19.559 align:start position:0%
the and and again with
 
00:57:22.730 --> 00:57:22.740 align:start position:0%
we did yeah so with the judges I I think
 
00:57:24.530 --> 00:57:24.540 align:start position:0%
just in terms of capacity they do just
 
00:57:25.549 --> 00:57:25.559 align:start position:0%
to be clear
 
00:57:27.710 --> 00:57:27.720 align:start position:0%
there are things that judges are doing
 
00:57:29.930 --> 00:57:29.940 align:start position:0%
overnight currently so they're warrants
 
00:57:31.670 --> 00:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
that are being issued by judges their
 
00:57:34.849 --> 00:57:34.859 align:start position:0%
number of of things that do happen
 
00:57:36.710 --> 00:57:36.720 align:start position:0%
overnight that judges are currently
 
00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:37.670 align:start position:0%
overnight that judges are currently
doing

00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
doing
 
00:57:39.829 --> 00:57:39.839 align:start position:0%
um some dcyf um
 
00:57:42.770 --> 00:57:42.780 align:start position:0%
petitions and those are happening but we
 
00:57:44.569 --> 00:57:44.579 align:start position:0%
are not at least currently contemplating
 
00:57:46.930 --> 00:57:46.940 align:start position:0%
with regard to bail that that would be
 
00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
nighttimes weekends holidays for the
 
00:57:52.010 --> 00:57:52.020 align:start position:0%
judges thank you
 
00:57:52.020 --> 00:57:52.970 align:start position:0%
judges thank you
yeah

00:57:52.970 --> 00:57:52.980 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:57:55.670 --> 00:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
representative Jim
 
00:57:57.170 --> 00:57:57.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:57:59.870 --> 00:57:59.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh my recollection
 
00:58:02.390 --> 00:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
from the 1990s when I commissioned bills
 
00:58:05.089 --> 00:58:05.099 align:start position:0%
out of Hampton district court for
 
00:58:08.930 --> 00:58:08.940 align:start position:0%
justice Frazier was we got a packet from
 
00:58:10.790 --> 00:58:10.800 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch that gave us
 
00:58:13.309 --> 00:58:13.319 align:start position:0%
guidelines on commissioning our bills
 
00:58:16.670 --> 00:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
could you make that packet available to
 
00:58:19.210 --> 00:58:19.220 align:start position:0%
the committee the the the
 
00:58:21.410 --> 00:58:21.420 align:start position:0%
materials that go to bail Commissioners
 
00:58:24.770 --> 00:58:24.780 align:start position:0%
yes I can I can ask and
 
00:58:27.530 --> 00:58:27.540 align:start position:0%
um as a second part to that question
 
00:58:30.290 --> 00:58:30.300 align:start position:0%
um could you if if you don't explain it
 
00:58:32.690 --> 00:58:32.700 align:start position:0%
now could you in some sort of a
 
00:58:35.690 --> 00:58:35.700 align:start position:0%
narrative how the requirements
 
00:58:39.890 --> 00:58:39.900 align:start position:0%
of 597 colon 18a relative to educational
 
00:58:41.930 --> 00:58:41.940 align:start position:0%
requirements for a bail commissioner are
 
00:58:44.270 --> 00:58:44.280 align:start position:0%
being implemented by the judicial branch
 
00:58:46.549 --> 00:58:46.559 align:start position:0%
uh and again I apologize it's hard to
 
00:58:48.470 --> 00:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
hear yeah that's fine the educational
 
00:58:49.910 --> 00:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
requirements for the bail commissioner
 
00:58:52.910 --> 00:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
how the the judicial branch is uh is
 
00:58:55.190 --> 00:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
actually implementing that statute
 
00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:56.510 align:start position:0%
actually implementing that statute
currently

00:58:56.510 --> 00:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:58:59.569 --> 00:58:59.579 align:start position:0%
I really appreciate it thank you sure
 
00:59:01.849 --> 00:59:01.859 align:start position:0%
um I'm happy to include that and I'll
 
00:59:03.650 --> 00:59:03.660 align:start position:0%
check on the on the bail commissioner
 
00:59:05.990 --> 00:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
materials but I'll be happy to send a
 
00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:09.109 align:start position:0%
materials but I'll be happy to send a
reply

00:59:09.109 --> 00:59:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:10.910 --> 00:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and answering
 
00:59:13.910 --> 00:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
our questions this morning thank you at
 
00:59:16.190 --> 00:59:16.200 align:start position:0%
this time the chair recognizes Melissa
 
00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:27.730 align:start position:0%
this time the chair recognizes Melissa
Davis

00:59:27.730 --> 00:59:27.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:30.770 --> 00:59:30.780 align:start position:0%
thank you very much good morning my name
 
00:59:33.170 --> 00:59:33.180 align:start position:0%
is Melissa Davis I'm currently the
 
00:59:34.670 --> 00:59:34.680 align:start position:0%
director of the criminal Practice Clinic
 
00:59:38.089 --> 00:59:38.099 align:start position:0%
and an assistant professor at UNH School
 
00:59:41.329 --> 00:59:41.339 align:start position:0%
of Law prior to joining the law school
 
00:59:43.910 --> 00:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
as a public defender for 15 years as
 
00:59:45.470 --> 00:59:45.480 align:start position:0%
director of the criminal Practice Clinic
 
00:59:47.809 --> 00:59:47.819 align:start position:0%
at the law school a supervised students
 
00:59:50.270 --> 00:59:50.280 align:start position:0%
representing clients in misdemeanor and
 
00:59:52.670 --> 00:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
low-level felony offenses so for
 
00:59:55.490 --> 00:59:55.500 align:start position:0%
essentially the past 18 years I have
 
00:59:58.250 --> 00:59:58.260 align:start position:0%
represented defendants charged in
 
01:00:00.049 --> 01:00:00.059 align:start position:0%
criminal cases in New Hampshire state
 
01:00:02.690 --> 01:00:02.700 align:start position:0%
courts I think what's important to
 
01:00:04.970 --> 01:00:04.980 align:start position:0%
recognize initially is that this bill
 
01:00:08.329 --> 01:00:08.339 align:start position:0%
primarily affects people who I believe
 
01:00:10.730 --> 01:00:10.740 align:start position:0%
you know will be determined not
 
01:00:13.210 --> 01:00:13.220 align:start position:0%
dangerous and not a Flight Risk
 
01:00:17.450 --> 01:00:17.460 align:start position:0%
by a judge maybe the next morning maybe
 
01:00:19.069 --> 01:00:19.079 align:start position:0%
four days later if it's a holiday
 
01:00:21.950 --> 01:00:21.960 align:start position:0%
weekend in these circumstances these
 
01:00:24.349 --> 01:00:24.359 align:start position:0%
people you know obviously maybe innocent
 
01:00:26.650 --> 01:00:26.660 align:start position:0%
of the crime that they are charged with
 
01:00:30.589 --> 01:00:30.599 align:start position:0%
also they may not uh in the end even if
 
01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
they are convicted of the charge end up
 
01:00:34.630 --> 01:00:34.640 align:start position:0%
serving any jail time for these charges
 
01:00:37.849 --> 01:00:37.859 align:start position:0%
these are people who
 
01:00:40.849 --> 01:00:40.859 align:start position:0%
um is I understand representative Lynn's
 
01:00:43.069 --> 01:00:43.079 align:start position:0%
testimony this morning essentially the
 
01:00:44.930 --> 01:00:44.940 align:start position:0%
process will be that they are arrested
 
01:00:46.970 --> 01:00:46.980 align:start position:0%
it has been the police officer's
 
01:00:48.530 --> 01:00:48.540 align:start position:0%
determination whether or not to release
 
01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
them on the summons the police officer
 
01:00:52.370 --> 01:00:52.380 align:start position:0%
in that circumstances then therefore
 
01:00:54.410 --> 01:00:54.420 align:start position:0%
sort of taking the position of the bail
 
01:00:56.809 --> 01:00:56.819 align:start position:0%
commissioner currently holds that police
 
01:00:58.549 --> 01:00:58.559 align:start position:0%
officer is obviously involved in the
 
01:01:00.289 --> 01:01:00.299 align:start position:0%
investigation of the case involved in
 
01:01:02.329 --> 01:01:02.339 align:start position:0%
the decision to bring the charges May
 
01:01:05.329 --> 01:01:05.339 align:start position:0%
themselves be a victim of the elect the
 
01:01:07.010 --> 01:01:07.020 align:start position:0%
charges themselves depending in
 
01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
resisting arrest cases and things like
 
01:01:10.370 --> 01:01:10.380 align:start position:0%
that they will then be the person
 
01:01:12.049 --> 01:01:12.059 align:start position:0%
determining whether or not to issue a
 
01:01:14.829 --> 01:01:14.839 align:start position:0%
summons or hold someone overnight
 
01:01:17.569 --> 01:01:17.579 align:start position:0%
presumably or possibly up to four days
 
01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
with the holiday weekend these kinds of
 
01:01:23.930 --> 01:01:23.940 align:start position:0%
delays cause substantial effects on
 
01:01:25.970 --> 01:01:25.980 align:start position:0%
these individuals and I just wanted to
 
01:01:28.609 --> 01:01:28.619 align:start position:0%
share a couple of instances many of my
 
01:01:31.130 --> 01:01:31.140 align:start position:0%
clients are parents so many of them are
 
01:01:33.170 --> 01:01:33.180 align:start position:0%
single parents you even if they are not
 
01:01:36.170 --> 01:01:36.180 align:start position:0%
single parents their spouse hat also
 
01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
works and so the issue becomes if they
 
01:01:41.329 --> 01:01:41.339 align:start position:0%
are held for any amount of time and have
 
01:01:43.130 --> 01:01:43.140 align:start position:0%
to wait for a judge to see them the next
 
01:01:45.289 --> 01:01:45.299 align:start position:0%
morning they're missing work not only
 
01:01:47.809 --> 01:01:47.819 align:start position:0%
are they missing work if they're if they
 
01:01:50.569 --> 01:01:50.579 align:start position:0%
have a partner who is available who then
 
01:01:52.609 --> 01:01:52.619 align:start position:0%
has to watch the kids that day their
 
01:01:54.410 --> 01:01:54.420 align:start position:0%
partner is missing work putting both
 
01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
their jobs in Jeopardy therefore putting
 
01:01:58.910 --> 01:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
their housing in Jeopardy and causing a
 
01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
substantial Interruption to this
 
01:02:02.930 --> 01:02:02.940 align:start position:0%
family's life again these are people who
 
01:02:04.970 --> 01:02:04.980 align:start position:0%
would be you know likely released as not
 
01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:06.720 align:start position:0%
dangerous to the community who would
 
01:02:09.770 --> 01:02:09.780 align:start position:0%
likely be released as not flight risks
 
01:02:11.630 --> 01:02:11.640 align:start position:0%
and who in the end are not going to
 
01:02:14.210 --> 01:02:14.220 align:start position:0%
likely serve jail time at all on these
 
01:02:16.190 --> 01:02:16.200 align:start position:0%
types of offenses
 
01:02:18.589 --> 01:02:18.599 align:start position:0%
the other you know another type of
 
01:02:19.849 --> 01:02:19.859 align:start position:0%
population that you're going to be
 
01:02:21.470 --> 01:02:21.480 align:start position:0%
hitting are people with substance use
 
01:02:23.270 --> 01:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
and mental health issues
 
01:02:25.010 --> 01:02:25.020 align:start position:0%
specifically for people with substance
 
01:02:27.710 --> 01:02:27.720 align:start position:0%
use and mental health issues one day in
 
01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:28.609 align:start position:0%
use and mental health issues one day in
jail

01:02:28.609 --> 01:02:28.619 align:start position:0%
jail
 
01:02:31.670 --> 01:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
is a traumatic event it can cause
 
01:02:35.270 --> 01:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
relapse it can cause trauma for them
 
01:02:37.130 --> 01:02:37.140 align:start position:0%
that has been something that they will
 
01:02:38.690 --> 01:02:38.700 align:start position:0%
have to deal with for a significant
 
01:02:41.030 --> 01:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
amount of time afterwards these are
 
01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
people who may be making it barely
 
01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
making it but they are making it with
 
01:02:47.809 --> 01:02:47.819 align:start position:0%
the Assistance or the services provided
 
01:02:49.069 --> 01:02:49.079 align:start position:0%
in the community when they are
 
01:02:50.750 --> 01:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
incarcerated for any amount of time
 
01:02:52.910 --> 01:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
those services are interrupted and it's
 
01:02:54.829 --> 01:02:54.839 align:start position:0%
very difficult oftentimes to get them
 
01:02:56.030 --> 01:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
back in place
 
01:02:57.950 --> 01:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
specifically for people with substance
 
01:03:01.250 --> 01:03:01.260 align:start position:0%
use issues many of them as we know are
 
01:03:03.530 --> 01:03:03.540 align:start position:0%
dealing with opioid addiction that is
 
01:03:05.990 --> 01:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
the best treatment for that type of
 
01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
addiction is medicated assistance
 
01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:09.839 align:start position:0%
treatment but medicated assistive
 
01:03:11.809 --> 01:03:11.819 align:start position:0%
treatment requires medication every
 
01:03:14.569 --> 01:03:14.579 align:start position:0%
single day medication that the jail is
 
01:03:16.010 --> 01:03:16.020 align:start position:0%
not going to provide to every single
 
01:03:18.349 --> 01:03:18.359 align:start position:0%
person who says hi I'm on medicated
 
01:03:20.510 --> 01:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
assisted treatment I need my dose this
 
01:03:21.710 --> 01:03:21.720 align:start position:0%
morning because they don't have a
 
01:03:22.670 --> 01:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
prescription they don't have
 
01:03:24.589 --> 01:03:24.599 align:start position:0%
verification this person's actually on
 
01:03:26.329 --> 01:03:26.339 align:start position:0%
the medication and they may not have the
 
01:03:28.250 --> 01:03:28.260 align:start position:0%
resources to provide it means this
 
01:03:30.410 --> 01:03:30.420 align:start position:0%
person misses their dose they then go
 
01:03:32.410 --> 01:03:32.420 align:start position:0%
into a type of
 
01:03:35.089 --> 01:03:35.099 align:start position:0%
withdrawal which is very painful and
 
01:03:38.329 --> 01:03:38.339 align:start position:0%
again risks relapse it the same applies
 
01:03:40.130 --> 01:03:40.140 align:start position:0%
for people on Mental Health medications
 
01:03:42.049 --> 01:03:42.059 align:start position:0%
many of these people must take
 
01:03:44.390 --> 01:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
medications at the same time every day
 
01:03:46.069 --> 01:03:46.079 align:start position:0%
most people are not carrying their
 
01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
medications around with them so when
 
01:03:49.970 --> 01:03:49.980 align:start position:0%
they are held even overnight or
 
01:03:51.530 --> 01:03:51.540 align:start position:0%
especially for longer periods of time
 
01:03:53.230 --> 01:03:53.240 align:start position:0%
the jails are not
 
01:03:56.390 --> 01:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
able to prescribe medications quickly
 
01:03:57.829 --> 01:03:57.839 align:start position:0%
these people will be missing their
 
01:04:00.410 --> 01:04:00.420 align:start position:0%
medications they risk then
 
01:04:02.809 --> 01:04:02.819 align:start position:0%
um they then risk uh you know having
 
01:04:05.630 --> 01:04:05.640 align:start position:0%
effects of those medications the with
 
01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
the withdrawal of those medications but
 
01:04:09.770 --> 01:04:09.780 align:start position:0%
also not having those medications which
 
01:04:11.750 --> 01:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
contribute significantly to other things
 
01:04:14.510 --> 01:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
in their life being disrupted finally I
 
01:04:16.549 --> 01:04:16.559 align:start position:0%
will point out the number of unhoused
 
01:04:20.150 --> 01:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
people who may have a bed at a shelter
 
01:04:22.609 --> 01:04:22.619 align:start position:0%
if they miss one night at that shelter
 
01:04:25.130 --> 01:04:25.140 align:start position:0%
they lose their bed they then have to go
 
01:04:27.049 --> 01:04:27.059 align:start position:0%
back on the waiting list all over again
 
01:04:30.049 --> 01:04:30.059 align:start position:0%
to get a bed so these even one night in
 
01:04:31.730 --> 01:04:31.740 align:start position:0%
jail is significant for these
 
01:04:33.650 --> 01:04:33.660 align:start position:0%
individuals in these situations
 
01:04:35.809 --> 01:04:35.819 align:start position:0%
on top of that
 
01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
um these hearings they may be presented
 
01:04:40.910 --> 01:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
with plea offers they are unrepresented
 
01:04:42.470 --> 01:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
at these hearings they do not have
 
01:04:44.930 --> 01:04:44.940 align:start position:0%
lawyers they are rep they're offered the
 
01:04:47.210 --> 01:04:47.220 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get out of jail these are
 
01:04:49.130 --> 01:04:49.140 align:start position:0%
people who may be innocent these are
 
01:04:51.650 --> 01:04:51.660 align:start position:0%
people who may have defenses these are
 
01:04:52.870 --> 01:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
people who
 
01:04:55.370 --> 01:04:55.380 align:start position:0%
may have you know there may be issues
 
01:04:56.510 --> 01:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
with their case that need to be
 
01:04:58.730 --> 01:04:58.740 align:start position:0%
litigated and their Prime concern as
 
01:05:00.589 --> 01:05:00.599 align:start position:0%
with all of my clients is I need to get
 
01:05:02.569 --> 01:05:02.579 align:start position:0%
out of jail and they may be taking
 
01:05:04.250 --> 01:05:04.260 align:start position:0%
offers and pleading guilty to things
 
01:05:06.530 --> 01:05:06.540 align:start position:0%
that they should not be taking on as
 
01:05:08.870 --> 01:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
convictions without the advice of
 
01:05:10.849 --> 01:05:10.859 align:start position:0%
counsel this is especially concerning
 
01:05:13.010 --> 01:05:13.020 align:start position:0%
what's concerning in a lot of areas it's
 
01:05:15.170 --> 01:05:15.180 align:start position:0%
the the consequences of that are very
 
01:05:17.270 --> 01:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
concerning with motor vehicle offenses
 
01:05:18.950 --> 01:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
especially considering the habitual
 
01:05:20.870 --> 01:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
offender law they may be pleading to
 
01:05:22.789 --> 01:05:22.799 align:start position:0%
Major motor vehicle offenses not knowing
 
01:05:25.250 --> 01:05:25.260 align:start position:0%
the consequences of that and then have
 
01:05:27.589 --> 01:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
to deal with the DMV afterwards as a
 
01:05:29.690 --> 01:05:29.700 align:start position:0%
result because they wanted to get out of
 
01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:30.950 align:start position:0%
result because they wanted to get out of
jail

01:05:30.950 --> 01:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
jail
 
01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:37.730 align:start position:0%
jail
um

01:05:37.730 --> 01:05:37.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:40.079 align:start position:0%
sorry just one more Point here I think
 
01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
what's important to notice this also
 
01:05:44.569 --> 01:05:44.579 align:start position:0%
includes Class B misdemeanors people who
 
01:05:47.030 --> 01:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
would not serve jail time even even as a
 
01:05:50.289 --> 01:05:50.299 align:start position:0%
possible convict even as a possible
 
01:05:53.089 --> 01:05:53.099 align:start position:0%
sentence in these matters and so overall
 
01:05:54.170 --> 01:05:54.180 align:start position:0%
I think
 
01:05:56.210 --> 01:05:56.220 align:start position:0%
um I would urge this this committee to
 
01:05:58.370 --> 01:05:58.380 align:start position:0%
consider a possible damage of adding
 
01:06:00.289 --> 01:06:00.299 align:start position:0%
additional time in jail for people who
 
01:06:02.510 --> 01:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
otherwise would not be sitting in jail
 
01:06:07.309 --> 01:06:07.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:09.349 --> 01:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony this
 
01:06:09.359 --> 01:06:10.190 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony this
morning

01:06:10.190 --> 01:06:10.200 align:start position:0%
morning
 
01:06:13.250 --> 01:06:13.260 align:start position:0%
um I just have a couple of questions so
 
01:06:15.710 --> 01:06:15.720 align:start position:0%
at the outset of your testimony you said
 
01:06:18.650 --> 01:06:18.660 align:start position:0%
that the um they were likely many of
 
01:06:20.930 --> 01:06:20.940 align:start position:0%
them were likely not guilty likely would
 
01:06:23.390 --> 01:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
not serve time likely would end up not
 
01:06:24.770 --> 01:06:24.780 align:start position:0%
being determined to be a danger or
 
01:06:26.029 --> 01:06:26.039 align:start position:0%
Flight Risk
 
01:06:28.430 --> 01:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
and we you went on about the possible
 
01:06:32.150 --> 01:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
effects on these defendants in
 
01:06:33.890 --> 01:06:33.900 align:start position:0%
in I think a major duty to this
 
01:06:35.450 --> 01:06:35.460 align:start position:0%
committee is to make sure that there's a
 
01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
balance between the the victims and and
 
01:06:39.890 --> 01:06:39.900 align:start position:0%
defendants but I didn't hear you mention
 
01:06:43.870 --> 01:06:43.880 align:start position:0%
the victims I'm looking at the list of
 
01:06:46.490 --> 01:06:46.500 align:start position:0%
crimes and these are all very serious
 
01:06:49.370 --> 01:06:49.380 align:start position:0%
crimes that have victims um
 
01:06:51.670 --> 01:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
with domestic violence
 
01:06:54.230 --> 01:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
kidnapping stalking trafficking in
 
01:06:58.789 --> 01:06:58.799 align:start position:0%
persons felonious use firearms in in
 
01:07:00.650 --> 01:07:00.660 align:start position:0%
order to get there there's already been
 
01:07:02.150 --> 01:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
a determination that probable cause
 
01:07:05.210 --> 01:07:05.220 align:start position:0%
exists to make the arrest so
 
01:07:07.250 --> 01:07:07.260 align:start position:0%
in layman's terms it's more likely than
 
01:07:09.230 --> 01:07:09.240 align:start position:0%
not that they committed the offense so
 
01:07:11.930 --> 01:07:11.940 align:start position:0%
how is it that you you see us balancing
 
01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
that with the rights of the victims who
 
01:07:16.010 --> 01:07:16.020 align:start position:0%
also are missing work or possibly dead
 
01:07:18.829 --> 01:07:18.839 align:start position:0%
in some of these cases sure and I think
 
01:07:20.329 --> 01:07:20.339 align:start position:0%
that section is somewhat different than
 
01:07:22.250 --> 01:07:22.260 align:start position:0%
the section that that specifically
 
01:07:25.010 --> 01:07:25.020 align:start position:0%
requires that everyone be held until
 
01:07:28.190 --> 01:07:28.200 align:start position:0%
they can be heard by a judge in this
 
01:07:31.250 --> 01:07:31.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:31.260 --> 01:07:32.930 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:07:32.930 --> 01:07:32.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:38.990 --> 01:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:41.450 --> 01:07:41.460 align:start position:0%
right all persons arrested for a
 
01:07:43.970 --> 01:07:43.980 align:start position:0%
criminal offense including DWI are not
 
01:07:45.950 --> 01:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
released unless released a part of
 
01:07:47.510 --> 01:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
summit so that's all crimes which
 
01:07:49.789 --> 01:07:49.799 align:start position:0%
section you specifically point to I'm
 
01:07:51.170 --> 01:07:51.180 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
01:07:51.180 --> 01:07:53.029 align:start position:0%

paragraph
 
01:07:53.039 --> 01:07:55.789 align:start position:0%
paragraph
is

01:07:55.789 --> 01:07:55.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:55.799 --> 01:07:59.529 align:start position:0%
 
it is

01:07:59.529 --> 01:07:59.539 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:02.329 --> 01:08:02.339 align:start position:0%
597 too
 
01:08:08.569 --> 01:08:08.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:11.270 --> 01:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
in in regards to the list of crimes that
 
01:08:12.950 --> 01:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
are then you know sort of determination
 
01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
about whether or not there is a danger
 
01:08:16.249 --> 01:08:16.259 align:start position:0%
to the community in that situation these
 
01:08:18.229 --> 01:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
things are already happening
 
01:08:19.610 --> 01:08:19.620 align:start position:0%
um you know bail Commissioners are
 
01:08:21.829 --> 01:08:21.839 align:start position:0%
already and you know I'm not here to
 
01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
speak about the bail Commissioners but
 
01:08:24.950 --> 01:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
they're all ready to you know looking at
 
01:08:26.450 --> 01:08:26.460 align:start position:0%
the nature of the offenses and
 
01:08:28.130 --> 01:08:28.140 align:start position:0%
determining whether or not someone is a
 
01:08:31.010 --> 01:08:31.020 align:start position:0%
danger to the community based on the
 
01:08:32.510 --> 01:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
allegations that are made in those
 
01:08:34.849 --> 01:08:34.859 align:start position:0%
circumstances judges in those situations
 
01:08:36.709 --> 01:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
are also when bail motions are file
 
01:08:39.650 --> 01:08:39.660 align:start position:0%
taking into account those situations I
 
01:08:42.349 --> 01:08:42.359 align:start position:0%
will say that without a fact
 
01:08:45.650 --> 01:08:45.660 align:start position:0%
determination of what is the exact type
 
01:08:48.410 --> 01:08:48.420 align:start position:0%
of conduct that is being charged in a
 
01:08:50.150 --> 01:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
situation whether or not that actual
 
01:08:53.269 --> 01:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
conduct presents a danger is a is a
 
01:08:55.010 --> 01:08:55.020 align:start position:0%
significant missing step when you simply
 
01:08:58.910 --> 01:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
label everything as any type of domestic
 
01:09:01.849 --> 01:09:01.859 align:start position:0%
violence crime as something that should
 
01:09:03.650 --> 01:09:03.660 align:start position:0%
require being held in jail I'm just
 
01:09:05.630 --> 01:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
going to give an example I spoke to
 
01:09:07.030 --> 01:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
someone this morning
 
01:09:09.229 --> 01:09:09.239 align:start position:0%
arrested for a non
 
01:09:11.870 --> 01:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
uh but considered to be domestic
 
01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
violence type of offense you know
 
01:09:15.169 --> 01:09:15.179 align:start position:0%
arrested and helped already under the
 
01:09:17.450 --> 01:09:17.460 align:start position:0%
mandatory law that exists in those
 
01:09:19.970 --> 01:09:19.980 align:start position:0%
circumstances even that individual as
 
01:09:21.709 --> 01:09:21.719 align:start position:0%
the law currently exists is talking to
 
01:09:23.570 --> 01:09:23.580 align:start position:0%
me about how you know he has four
 
01:09:23.580 --> 01:09:24.590 align:start position:0%
me about how you know he has four
children

01:09:24.590 --> 01:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:09:26.930 --> 01:09:26.940 align:start position:0%
um those four children are at home he
 
01:09:28.910 --> 01:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
can't get to work he's the Sole Provider
 
01:09:31.249 --> 01:09:31.259 align:start position:0%
of the family and is worried about his
 
01:09:32.510 --> 01:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
ability to provide in those
 
01:09:34.849 --> 01:09:34.859 align:start position:0%
circumstances I can tell you that I have
 
01:09:36.530 --> 01:09:36.540 align:start position:0%
clients charged in domestic violence
 
01:09:38.630 --> 01:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
situations where not every situation not
 
01:09:41.329 --> 01:09:41.339 align:start position:0%
every charge is necessarily violent or
 
01:09:44.630 --> 01:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
where any individual is necessarily a
 
01:09:47.150 --> 01:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
danger by sort of categorizing it
 
01:09:48.709 --> 01:09:48.719 align:start position:0%
broadly under the domestic violence
 
01:09:51.169 --> 01:09:51.179 align:start position:0%
statute you're going to be then putting
 
01:09:52.970 --> 01:09:52.980 align:start position:0%
even people who are not dangerous and
 
01:09:55.870 --> 01:09:55.880 align:start position:0%
night not flight risks into
 
01:09:58.910 --> 01:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
incarceration and honestly in those
 
01:10:00.770 --> 01:10:00.780 align:start position:0%
situations those people also are not
 
01:10:03.470 --> 01:10:03.480 align:start position:0%
serving jail time in the end either
 
01:10:05.209 --> 01:10:05.219 align:start position:0%
they're getting the resources that they
 
01:10:09.410 --> 01:10:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
representative Newell
 
01:10:14.209 --> 01:10:14.219 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:10:16.070 --> 01:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:10:18.410 --> 01:10:18.420 align:start position:0%
um with your I think you said 18 years
 
01:10:20.810 --> 01:10:20.820 align:start position:0%
of experience in this I'm curious
 
01:10:22.490 --> 01:10:22.500 align:start position:0%
um especially when we talk about this
 
01:10:25.370 --> 01:10:25.380 align:start position:0%
being at the discretion of the officer
 
01:10:28.430 --> 01:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm curious if in your 18 years
 
01:10:31.550 --> 01:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
you've seen any kind of patterns
 
01:10:35.870 --> 01:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
um as to how that how bias manifests in
 
01:10:38.270 --> 01:10:38.280 align:start position:0%
that excuse me how what how bias
 
01:10:40.130 --> 01:10:40.140 align:start position:0%
manifests in that situation or if you
 
01:10:48.350 --> 01:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:50.090 --> 01:10:50.100 align:start position:0%
involved in a situation is going to have
 
01:10:53.090 --> 01:10:53.100 align:start position:0%
some natural internal bias in these in
 
01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
these um matters you know we know that
 
01:10:59.030 --> 01:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh you know people of color in New
 
01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are still disproportionately
 
01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:01.669 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are still disproportionately
arrested

01:11:01.669 --> 01:11:01.679 align:start position:0%
arrested
 
01:11:05.390 --> 01:11:05.400 align:start position:0%
um yeah on offenses and I think that
 
01:11:07.370 --> 01:11:07.380 align:start position:0%
specifically in types of offenses that
 
01:11:09.709 --> 01:11:09.719 align:start position:0%
involve officers oftentimes and so if
 
01:11:11.090 --> 01:11:11.100 align:start position:0%
they're the ones that making the bail
 
01:11:18.050 --> 01:11:18.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:19.970 --> 01:11:19.980 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:11:25.490 --> 01:11:25.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:40.910 --> 01:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:44.209 --> 01:11:44.219 align:start position:0%
Trixie Leffler
 
01:11:50.990 --> 01:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:53.870 --> 01:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Trixie Lafave
 
01:11:55.910 --> 01:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
pay no attention
 
01:11:58.910 --> 01:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
since they don't run together properly
 
01:12:00.950 --> 01:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you all for letting
 
01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:01.970 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you all for letting
me

01:12:01.970 --> 01:12:01.980 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:12:03.410 --> 01:12:03.420 align:start position:0%
participate in this public hearing today
 
01:12:05.030 --> 01:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
what an honor to be inside the
 
01:12:07.310 --> 01:12:07.320 align:start position:0%
representatives Hall as well
 
01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:08.090 align:start position:0%
representatives Hall as well
um

01:12:08.090 --> 01:12:08.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
I'm here
 
01:12:11.689 --> 01:12:11.699 align:start position:0%
over the next few weeks this committee
 
01:12:14.209 --> 01:12:14.219 align:start position:0%
will hear three bills which seek funding
 
01:12:17.390 --> 01:12:17.400 align:start position:0%
to hire judges or magistrates plus
 
01:12:19.189 --> 01:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
additional support staff and new hires
 
01:12:20.930 --> 01:12:20.940 align:start position:0%
within the circuit courts
 
01:12:23.930 --> 01:12:23.940 align:start position:0%
today's Bill House Bill 318 also seeks
 
01:12:25.250 --> 01:12:25.260 align:start position:0%
to eliminate the bail commitment
 
01:12:27.649 --> 01:12:27.659 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and hire three full-time
 
01:12:27.659 --> 01:12:28.729 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and hire three full-time
judges

01:12:28.729 --> 01:12:28.739 align:start position:0%
judges
 
01:12:31.430 --> 01:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
this bill contains a fiscal note with a
 
01:12:34.010 --> 01:12:34.020 align:start position:0%
known expenditure of 323 thousand
 
01:12:36.470 --> 01:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
dollars per judge so nearly one million
 
01:12:38.390 --> 01:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
dollars initially
 
01:12:40.610 --> 01:12:40.620 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note also cites that
 
01:12:42.709 --> 01:12:42.719 align:start position:0%
additional judges would be needed due to
 
01:12:45.350 --> 01:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
the increased demands for hearings in
 
01:12:47.630 --> 01:12:47.640 align:start position:0%
further States and support staff would
 
01:12:49.850 --> 01:12:49.860 align:start position:0%
be required for these judges
 
01:12:52.729 --> 01:12:52.739 align:start position:0%
our association of counties projects an
 
01:12:55.130 --> 01:12:55.140 align:start position:0%
unknown increase in costs to the County
 
01:12:56.930 --> 01:12:56.940 align:start position:0%
correctional facilities because of an
 
01:12:59.330 --> 01:12:59.340 align:start position:0%
increase in the incarcerations
 
01:13:01.250 --> 01:13:01.260 align:start position:0%
the higher these three or more judges
 
01:13:03.470 --> 01:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
appears to replace the entire bail
 
01:13:05.390 --> 01:13:05.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner community that serves the
 
01:13:07.729 --> 01:13:07.739 align:start position:0%
judicial branch as well as the 200 plus
 
01:13:10.310 --> 01:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
police departments here in New Hampshire
 
01:13:12.830 --> 01:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
three judges to answer the call of our
 
01:13:14.810 --> 01:13:14.820 align:start position:0%
Police Department's 24 hours per day
 
01:13:17.750 --> 01:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
seven days per week the elimination of
 
01:13:19.250 --> 01:13:19.260 align:start position:0%
bail Commissioners will carry a
 
01:13:21.229 --> 01:13:21.239 align:start position:0%
tremendous financial burden to New
 
01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's taxpayers but it will also
 
01:13:25.790 --> 01:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
place an unknown cost burden on our
 
01:13:27.950 --> 01:13:27.960 align:start position:0%
County jails which implies more
 
01:13:30.290 --> 01:13:30.300 align:start position:0%
individuals being detained for longer
 
01:13:31.970 --> 01:13:31.980 align:start position:0%
periods of time
 
01:13:34.370 --> 01:13:34.380 align:start position:0%
there are about 80 to 100 bail
 
01:13:35.990 --> 01:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
commission is presently appointed and
 
01:13:38.030 --> 01:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
overseen directly by the court that
 
01:13:39.950 --> 01:13:39.960 align:start position:0%
answer these calls we are
 
01:13:42.530 --> 01:13:42.540 align:start position:0%
representatives of the judges the
 
01:13:44.330 --> 01:13:44.340 align:start position:0%
updated 2020 New Hampshire bail
 
01:13:45.890 --> 01:13:45.900 align:start position:0%
commissioner handbook written by the
 
01:13:48.050 --> 01:13:48.060 align:start position:0%
administrative office of the courts is
 
01:13:50.930 --> 01:13:50.940 align:start position:0%
our guidepost and it is our training
 
01:13:52.729 --> 01:13:52.739 align:start position:0%
bail Commissioners are directly
 
01:13:55.550 --> 01:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
supervised by a circuit court judge we
 
01:13:58.310 --> 01:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
respond any time of day any day of the
 
01:14:00.590 --> 01:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
week regardless of the weather
 
01:14:02.149 --> 01:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
with the elimination of bail
 
01:14:04.430 --> 01:14:04.440 align:start position:0%
Commissioners comes this question
 
01:14:06.229 --> 01:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
how will our police departments be
 
01:14:08.709 --> 01:14:08.719 align:start position:0%
impacted by this reduction in the court
 
01:14:11.689 --> 01:14:11.699 align:start position:0%
Workforce typically a bail commissioner
 
01:14:13.790 --> 01:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
can assist their Department within 45 to
 
01:14:14.990 --> 01:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
60 minutes
 
01:14:17.570 --> 01:14:17.580 align:start position:0%
our smaller police departments must keep
 
01:14:19.850 --> 01:14:19.860 align:start position:0%
the arresting officer present with the
 
01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
defendant until a bail commissioner
 
01:14:24.649 --> 01:14:24.659 align:start position:0%
shows up and sets bail should this bill
 
01:14:27.470 --> 01:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
pass at least police officers unable to
 
01:14:29.450 --> 01:14:29.460 align:start position:0%
patrol the roads and respond to the
 
01:14:31.610 --> 01:14:31.620 align:start position:0%
needs of their community
 
01:14:34.250 --> 01:14:34.260 align:start position:0%
the service that we provide has no tax
 
01:14:37.130 --> 01:14:37.140 align:start position:0%
impact to New Hampshire residents our
 
01:14:39.530 --> 01:14:39.540 align:start position:0%
state shares a fiscal intelligence with
 
01:14:41.450 --> 01:14:41.460 align:start position:0%
two other New England states that uses
 
01:14:43.010 --> 01:14:43.020 align:start position:0%
bail Commissioners in their judicial
 
01:14:43.020 --> 01:14:44.689 align:start position:0%
bail Commissioners in their judicial
framework

01:14:44.689 --> 01:14:44.699 align:start position:0%
framework
 
01:14:46.610 --> 01:14:46.620 align:start position:0%
the use of bail Commissioners has proven
 
01:14:49.910 --> 01:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
to be a valuable tool with no tax burden
 
01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
for the past four years we have sought
 
01:14:54.290 --> 01:14:54.300 align:start position:0%
legislative support to help with
 
01:14:54.300 --> 01:14:56.030 align:start position:0%
legislative support to help with
uncollected

01:14:56.030 --> 01:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
uncollected
 
01:14:58.370 --> 01:14:58.380 align:start position:0%
funds that we are entitled to Perth
 
01:15:00.590 --> 01:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
statute each attempt has been
 
01:15:02.750 --> 01:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
unsuccessful to date
 
01:15:06.350 --> 01:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
in 2021 House Bill 498 was presented
 
01:15:09.110 --> 01:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
requesting funding in the amount of 636
 
01:15:11.630 --> 01:15:11.640 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars to cover loss payments
 
01:15:13.550 --> 01:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
for the 80 to 100 bail Commissioners
 
01:15:15.530 --> 01:15:15.540 align:start position:0%
that are presently serving it was
 
01:15:15.540 --> 01:15:16.669 align:start position:0%
that are presently serving it was
defeated

01:15:16.669 --> 01:15:16.679 align:start position:0%
defeated
 
01:15:19.310 --> 01:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
this represents less than eight thousand
 
01:15:21.649 --> 01:15:21.659 align:start position:0%
dollars per appointed bail commissioner
 
01:15:23.870 --> 01:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
and it did not pass
 
01:15:25.790 --> 01:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
bail Commissioners have continued to
 
01:15:27.709 --> 01:15:27.719 align:start position:0%
perform their services
 
01:15:29.750 --> 01:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
back here
 
01:15:32.030 --> 01:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
to their communities despite the
 
01:15:33.709 --> 01:15:33.719 align:start position:0%
numerous failed attempts to be wholly
 
01:15:33.719 --> 01:15:35.270 align:start position:0%
numerous failed attempts to be wholly
compensated

01:15:35.270 --> 01:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
compensated
 
01:15:37.250 --> 01:15:37.260 align:start position:0%
here this morning is a request for the
 
01:15:39.290 --> 01:15:39.300 align:start position:0%
expenditure of three hundred and twenty
 
01:15:41.570 --> 01:15:41.580 align:start position:0%
three thousand dollars per each hire
 
01:15:44.990 --> 01:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
plus additional unknown costs
 
01:15:47.510 --> 01:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
this bill if passed would reduce the
 
01:15:50.750 --> 01:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
workforce the courts by about 85 percent
 
01:15:53.570 --> 01:15:53.580 align:start position:0%
the request makes no practical sense it
 
01:15:55.430 --> 01:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
is short-sighted it is what is in the
 
01:15:57.950 --> 01:15:57.960 align:start position:0%
best interest of the Granite Staters
 
01:16:00.110 --> 01:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
further along in January and February
 
01:16:02.270 --> 01:16:02.280 align:start position:0%
two more bills will be presented House
 
01:16:06.169 --> 01:16:06.179 align:start position:0%
Bill 46 and house bill 653.
 
01:16:08.450 --> 01:16:08.460 align:start position:0%
these also seek additional Staffing in
 
01:16:09.830 --> 01:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
the courts that have cost more than
 
01:16:12.290 --> 01:16:12.300 align:start position:0%
three million dollars I point these out
 
01:16:14.810 --> 01:16:14.820 align:start position:0%
so that all Staffing requests will be
 
01:16:17.630 --> 01:16:17.640 align:start position:0%
considered at one time House Bill 318
 
01:16:22.070 --> 01:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
House Bill 46 and house bill 6653 will
 
01:16:24.169 --> 01:16:24.179 align:start position:0%
add more than four million dollars to
 
01:16:26.390 --> 01:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
the addition the judicial branch budget
 
01:16:28.070 --> 01:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
if they all pass
 
01:16:30.050 --> 01:16:30.060 align:start position:0%
I'm asking that this committee opposed
 
01:16:32.689 --> 01:16:32.699 align:start position:0%
the passage of House Bill 318 it is
 
01:16:35.270 --> 01:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
heavy on tax burden and more importantly
 
01:16:37.070 --> 01:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
it will leave our community as well
 
01:16:39.169 --> 01:16:39.179 align:start position:0%
without the safety net of their police
 
01:16:41.090 --> 01:16:41.100 align:start position:0%
officers who will be performing
 
01:16:42.890 --> 01:16:42.900 align:start position:0%
administrative duties that the
 
01:16:44.870 --> 01:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
elimination of bail Commissioners would
 
01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:45.950 align:start position:0%
elimination of bail Commissioners would
cause

01:16:45.950 --> 01:16:45.960 align:start position:0%
cause
 
01:16:50.390 --> 01:16:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:51.890 --> 01:16:51.900 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony this
 
01:16:51.900 --> 01:16:56.090 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony this
morning

01:16:56.090 --> 01:16:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:58.130 --> 01:16:58.140 align:start position:0%
this time the chair recommend uh
 
01:17:08.330 --> 01:17:08.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:10.669 --> 01:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman members of the
 
01:17:12.530 --> 01:17:12.540 align:start position:0%
committee for the record I'm Paul Leary
 
01:17:15.229 --> 01:17:15.239 align:start position:0%
from Franklin New Hampshire I am a fail
 
01:17:16.790 --> 01:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner and I have been for almost
 
01:17:19.430 --> 01:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
seven years prior to that I had almost
 
01:17:22.370 --> 01:17:22.380 align:start position:0%
30 years in law enforcement and just for
 
01:17:24.590 --> 01:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
the record to be a bail commissioner I'm
 
01:17:26.689 --> 01:17:26.699 align:start position:0%
required to be a Justice of the Peace
 
01:17:28.910 --> 01:17:28.920 align:start position:0%
which means I have to fill out an
 
01:17:30.590 --> 01:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
application have a criminal background
 
01:17:33.470 --> 01:17:33.480 align:start position:0%
check be vetted by the Secretary of
 
01:17:36.709 --> 01:17:36.719 align:start position:0%
State's office and signed off by
 
01:17:38.390 --> 01:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
governor and Council
 
01:17:40.910 --> 01:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
then if I want to be a bail commissioner
 
01:17:42.830 --> 01:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
I have to be recommended by the court
 
01:17:45.290 --> 01:17:45.300 align:start position:0%
fill out an application have a
 
01:17:47.689 --> 01:17:47.699 align:start position:0%
background check be approved by an
 
01:17:49.610 --> 01:17:49.620 align:start position:0%
administrative judge of the Circuit
 
01:17:52.250 --> 01:17:52.260 align:start position:0%
Court as well as the Chief Justice of
 
01:17:56.270 --> 01:17:56.280 align:start position:0%
the superior court so just in reference
 
01:17:58.130 --> 01:17:58.140 align:start position:0%
for the left-handed compliment that we
 
01:18:00.410 --> 01:18:00.420 align:start position:0%
had relative to our background
 
01:18:03.229 --> 01:18:03.239 align:start position:0%
we are vetted to do it
 
01:18:06.110 --> 01:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
several years ago the legislature passed
 
01:18:08.630 --> 01:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
that we were supposed to be trained
 
01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
since that's happened I've had a
 
01:18:13.850 --> 01:18:13.860 align:start position:0%
19-minute training a 23-minute training
 
01:18:16.130 --> 01:18:16.140 align:start position:0%
and this year I had the first which I
 
01:18:17.870 --> 01:18:17.880 align:start position:0%
would call a decent training of over an
 
01:18:19.250 --> 01:18:19.260 align:start position:0%
hour's time
 
01:18:22.610 --> 01:18:22.620 align:start position:0%
it was combined by two courts that I
 
01:18:25.070 --> 01:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
appear before
 
01:18:27.250 --> 01:18:27.260 align:start position:0%
to let you know I'm out there by myself
 
01:18:29.590 --> 01:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
128 hours a week
 
01:18:33.890 --> 01:18:33.900 align:start position:0%
holidays it goes up to 136 hours and if
 
01:18:35.630 --> 01:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
you add an extra holiday it goes up to
 
01:18:37.250 --> 01:18:37.260 align:start position:0%
even more
 
01:18:39.950 --> 01:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
so basically on the training that I've
 
01:18:43.070 --> 01:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
gotten in my knowledge that I've had
 
01:18:45.830 --> 01:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
is how I perform the duties but you've
 
01:18:48.830 --> 01:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
also heard if I'm not doing my job I'd
 
01:18:51.350 --> 01:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
be removed so the thing is the fact that
 
01:18:53.090 --> 01:18:53.100 align:start position:0%
I'm standing here as a bail commissioner
 
01:18:54.770 --> 01:18:54.780 align:start position:0%
for almost seven years I'd say I've been
 
01:18:57.290 --> 01:18:57.300 align:start position:0%
down in a halfway decent job and not
 
01:18:59.149 --> 01:18:59.159 align:start position:0%
enough to get dragged in to see the
 
01:19:01.729 --> 01:19:01.739 align:start position:0%
clerk or we're still the judge or the
 
01:19:03.290 --> 01:19:03.300 align:start position:0%
administrative judge or the chief
 
01:19:05.870 --> 01:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
justice so the thing is we are a group
 
01:19:08.149 --> 01:19:08.159 align:start position:0%
of people out here that are hard working
 
01:19:10.370 --> 01:19:10.380 align:start position:0%
if we look tight and beat up it's
 
01:19:14.149 --> 01:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
because we answer the phone 24 7 365.
 
01:19:15.890 --> 01:19:15.900 align:start position:0%
someone needs a bail commissioner at two
 
01:19:17.630 --> 01:19:17.640 align:start position:0%
or three o'clock in the morning we're
 
01:19:21.050 --> 01:19:21.060 align:start position:0%
there we try to provide my concern is if
 
01:19:23.990 --> 01:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
you do away with the bail commissioners
 
01:19:26.030 --> 01:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
having been a cop wait too long I go
 
01:19:28.790 --> 01:19:28.800 align:start position:0%
back to State B Welding a 1982 case
 
01:19:31.490 --> 01:19:31.500 align:start position:0%
involving some juveniles down in
 
01:19:34.610 --> 01:19:34.620 align:start position:0%
Kingston that were drinking they hadn't
 
01:19:36.709 --> 01:19:36.719 align:start position:0%
been drinking they had alcohol in the
 
01:19:39.290 --> 01:19:39.300 align:start position:0%
vehicle police officers confiscated that
 
01:19:41.570 --> 01:19:41.580 align:start position:0%
took the kids to the PD returned them
 
01:19:43.910 --> 01:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
back to the parents kids decided to go
 
01:19:46.430 --> 01:19:46.440 align:start position:0%
back out later in the evening go across
 
01:19:49.010 --> 01:19:49.020 align:start position:0%
the line into Massachusetts by alcohol
 
01:19:51.169 --> 01:19:51.179 align:start position:0%
come back into the state and eventually
 
01:19:53.450 --> 01:19:53.460 align:start position:0%
unfortunately an accident happened and
 
01:19:55.310 --> 01:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
someone was killed
 
01:19:58.130 --> 01:19:58.140 align:start position:0%
end result of the case was it was found
 
01:20:00.169 --> 01:20:00.179 align:start position:0%
against the town because they said the
 
01:20:02.810 --> 01:20:02.820 align:start position:0%
police had a common law duty to act
 
01:20:04.669 --> 01:20:04.679 align:start position:0%
and had they acted they wouldn't have
 
01:20:06.590 --> 01:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
had the situation
 
01:20:08.510 --> 01:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
so here we're going to say that police
 
01:20:12.590 --> 01:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
officers have to let someone go on the
 
01:20:14.870 --> 01:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
summons and someone may be of
 
01:20:17.270 --> 01:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
questionable character as a bail
 
01:20:19.070 --> 01:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner we have to assure the court
 
01:20:21.950 --> 01:20:21.960 align:start position:0%
of two things that the defendant is
 
01:20:25.610 --> 01:20:25.620 align:start position:0%
going to be reasonably
 
01:20:28.250 --> 01:20:28.260 align:start position:0%
assure the court that they'll appear and
 
01:20:30.169 --> 01:20:30.179 align:start position:0%
reasonably assure the court that they
 
01:20:31.790 --> 01:20:31.800 align:start position:0%
won't reoffend
 
01:20:33.830 --> 01:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
now the police officer is going to have
 
01:20:35.450 --> 01:20:35.460 align:start position:0%
to figure that out before he gives the
 
01:20:36.890 --> 01:20:36.900 align:start position:0%
hand summons
 
01:20:38.810 --> 01:20:38.820 align:start position:0%
you take a small town where you only
 
01:20:40.910 --> 01:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
have one police officer you take Grafton
 
01:20:42.530 --> 01:20:42.540 align:start position:0%
County get them down in the southern end
 
01:20:44.510 --> 01:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
of the county and if they're going to
 
01:20:45.709 --> 01:20:45.719 align:start position:0%
have to hold them overnight they're
 
01:20:47.149 --> 01:20:47.159 align:start position:0%
going to have to drive them up to North
 
01:20:47.159 --> 01:20:48.350 align:start position:0%
going to have to drive them up to North
Haven

01:20:48.350 --> 01:20:48.360 align:start position:0%
Haven
 
01:20:50.630 --> 01:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
so there's an imposition on a lot of
 
01:20:52.250 --> 01:20:52.260 align:start position:0%
people if you remove the bail
 
01:20:54.649 --> 01:20:54.659 align:start position:0%
Commissioners we provide a valuable
 
01:20:54.659 --> 01:20:56.149 align:start position:0%
Commissioners we provide a valuable
service

01:20:56.149 --> 01:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
service
 
01:20:58.850 --> 01:20:58.860 align:start position:0%
and I know that uh
 
01:21:01.070 --> 01:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
attorney head spoke about the
 
01:21:02.630 --> 01:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
magistrates they're going to have a
 
01:21:05.750 --> 01:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
position to train the magistrates
 
01:21:08.390 --> 01:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
you've got us for free basically we're
 
01:21:10.729 --> 01:21:10.739 align:start position:0%
our own support system we provide all
 
01:21:13.729 --> 01:21:13.739 align:start position:0%
our own stuff our stamps our postage our
 
01:21:13.739 --> 01:21:15.050 align:start position:0%
our own stuff our stamps our postage our
gasoline

01:21:15.050 --> 01:21:15.060 align:start position:0%
gasoline
 
01:21:17.390 --> 01:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
some of us since covet because the
 
01:21:18.830 --> 01:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court told the bail
 
01:21:20.390 --> 01:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and the police departments
 
01:21:22.310 --> 01:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
to work it out we've started using tele
 
01:21:25.090 --> 01:21:25.100 align:start position:0%
bail or remote billing I've done about
 
01:21:27.050 --> 01:21:27.060 align:start position:0%
838 of them
 
01:21:29.450 --> 01:21:29.460 align:start position:0%
I get calls from police departments all
 
01:21:31.070 --> 01:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
over the state because they've tried to
 
01:21:32.570 --> 01:21:32.580 align:start position:0%
a list of bail Commissioners and they
 
01:21:33.830 --> 01:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
can't get someone
 
01:21:36.290 --> 01:21:36.300 align:start position:0%
so I take care of that and I do that
 
01:21:38.390 --> 01:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
there so there's a valuable service
 
01:21:41.030 --> 01:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
that's being provided but just to let
 
01:21:44.149 --> 01:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
you know I'm already coming up on seven
 
01:21:47.030 --> 01:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
years of March 9th I'm forty eight
 
01:21:48.950 --> 01:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in a hole of not being
 
01:21:52.669 --> 01:21:52.679 align:start position:0%
paid so the thing is with one group in
 
01:21:53.870 --> 01:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:21:55.850 --> 01:21:55.860 align:start position:0%
other than the legislatures but you
 
01:21:58.370 --> 01:21:58.380 align:start position:0%
signed up at 100 bucks a year now you're
 
01:22:01.850 --> 01:22:01.860 align:start position:0%
hopefully going to get a raise but
 
01:22:03.770 --> 01:22:03.780 align:start position:0%
we don't know what we're going to get
 
01:22:07.430 --> 01:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
because the fee is set by in sin statute
 
01:22:09.709 --> 01:22:09.719 align:start position:0%
the judge can waive our fee if someone
 
01:22:12.470 --> 01:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
declares indigency so that even adds
 
01:22:14.630 --> 01:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
more salt to the wound but we still get
 
01:22:16.070 --> 01:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
up and we answer the phone when we
 
01:22:19.610 --> 01:22:19.620 align:start position:0%
appear so it asks you to consider
 
01:22:22.430 --> 01:22:22.440 align:start position:0%
as Trixie happened to mention the
 
01:22:25.010 --> 01:22:25.020 align:start position:0%
services that we provide were a known
 
01:22:27.050 --> 01:22:27.060 align:start position:0%
commodity and if they really were
 
01:22:29.450 --> 01:22:29.460 align:start position:0%
concerned about us they'd hire a person
 
01:22:32.810 --> 01:22:32.820 align:start position:0%
to train us on a more regular basis if
 
01:22:34.910 --> 01:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
they had any questions about the ability
 
01:22:37.790 --> 01:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
for us to serve as male commissioners
 
01:22:40.610 --> 01:22:40.620 align:start position:0%
and I thank you for your time and I'm
 
01:22:43.790 --> 01:22:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:47.149 --> 01:22:47.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:49.250 --> 01:22:49.260 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thank you Mr chair and
 
01:22:51.649 --> 01:22:51.659 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your testimony
 
01:22:53.450 --> 01:22:53.460 align:start position:0%
um and thank you for your service I'm
 
01:22:54.890 --> 01:22:54.900 align:start position:0%
I'm curious
 
01:22:56.630 --> 01:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
um it sounds like you are a very devoted
 
01:22:58.850 --> 01:22:58.860 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner and uh stepped up to
 
01:23:01.250 --> 01:23:01.260 align:start position:0%
do something without a lot of pay
 
01:23:03.590 --> 01:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
um and so my my question is uh
 
01:23:06.110 --> 01:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
considering that it does end up costing
 
01:23:07.970 --> 01:23:07.980 align:start position:0%
you a lot do you see that as a
 
01:23:10.189 --> 01:23:10.199 align:start position:0%
sustainable model that other people
 
01:23:12.649 --> 01:23:12.659 align:start position:0%
would want to take that on I'm sorry
 
01:23:14.810 --> 01:23:14.820 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I have these sixty two
 
01:23:16.970 --> 01:23:16.980 align:start position:0%
hundred dollar hearing aids anyone
 
01:23:18.950 --> 01:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
standing here I haven't heard speak very
 
01:23:21.470 --> 01:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
much and you the last half of what you
 
01:23:23.810 --> 01:23:23.820 align:start position:0%
said disappeared into the room I
 
01:23:25.970 --> 01:23:25.980 align:start position:0%
apologize um hopefully I can make it a
 
01:23:27.350 --> 01:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
little clearer
 
01:23:29.630 --> 01:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
um what I'm curious about is if you see
 
01:23:32.750 --> 01:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
this as a sustainable model that other
 
01:23:34.970 --> 01:23:34.980 align:start position:0%
people seeing as you have sacrificed so
 
01:23:36.950 --> 01:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
much to serve your community
 
01:23:39.229 --> 01:23:39.239 align:start position:0%
um in the way of you know extending your
 
01:23:41.870 --> 01:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
own resources do you see this as
 
01:23:43.610 --> 01:23:43.620 align:start position:0%
something that is sustainable in that
 
01:23:45.649 --> 01:23:45.659 align:start position:0%
other people will be willing to take
 
01:23:49.270 --> 01:23:49.280 align:start position:0%
that on when you pass the torch
 
01:23:51.830 --> 01:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunately representative I still
 
01:23:54.530 --> 01:23:54.540 align:start position:0%
can't hear them can you hear me can you
 
01:23:57.410 --> 01:23:57.420 align:start position:0%
hear me I can hear you okay gee I'll
 
01:24:00.770 --> 01:24:00.780 align:start position:0%
I'll reiterate she asked if based on the
 
01:24:02.930 --> 01:24:02.940 align:start position:0%
hardships you have
 
01:24:04.610 --> 01:24:04.620 align:start position:0%
um getting paid and all the work you put
 
01:24:07.250 --> 01:24:07.260 align:start position:0%
in if you see this as a sustainable
 
01:24:09.410 --> 01:24:09.420 align:start position:0%
model going forward if you there'll be
 
01:24:11.390 --> 01:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
anyone else interested in being a bail
 
01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:13.910 align:start position:0%
anyone else interested in being a bail
commissioner

01:24:13.910 --> 01:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:16.430 --> 01:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
if you truly believe in the New
 
01:24:17.990 --> 01:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire way
 
01:24:21.470 --> 01:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
and people believe in the common good
 
01:24:24.050 --> 01:24:24.060 align:start position:0%
I think people will step up and we'll do
 
01:24:26.810 --> 01:24:26.820 align:start position:0%
it but the problem is after a period of
 
01:24:29.090 --> 01:24:29.100 align:start position:0%
time they'll get burnt out and fed up
 
01:24:32.510 --> 01:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
because they're not treated with respect
 
01:24:34.490 --> 01:24:34.500 align:start position:0%
by the people that they're trying to
 
01:24:36.530 --> 01:24:36.540 align:start position:0%
serve but more importantly also the
 
01:24:39.050 --> 01:24:39.060 align:start position:0%
people that they're working with there
 
01:24:40.610 --> 01:24:40.620 align:start position:0%
are some things that they could do to
 
01:24:42.590 --> 01:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
make it easier for us
 
01:24:44.930 --> 01:24:44.940 align:start position:0%
to help in the collection of the Bales
 
01:24:46.610 --> 01:24:46.620 align:start position:0%
that are due
 
01:24:48.830 --> 01:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
easy way would be just make it a cut
 
01:24:51.410 --> 01:24:51.420 align:start position:0%
cost and the court system pays us forty
 
01:24:54.050 --> 01:24:54.060 align:start position:0%
dollars every time we do a bail and the
 
01:24:55.970 --> 01:24:55.980 align:start position:0%
story we get paid people are happy and
 
01:24:58.010 --> 01:24:58.020 align:start position:0%
then we still have but we still have our
 
01:25:00.350 --> 01:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
own expenses but the answer to your
 
01:25:02.390 --> 01:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
question is I think the citizens in New
 
01:25:04.070 --> 01:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire care enough about the system
 
01:25:06.410 --> 01:25:06.420 align:start position:0%
that if they know about it and they can
 
01:25:08.570 --> 01:25:08.580 align:start position:0%
meet the qualifications
 
01:25:10.850 --> 01:25:10.860 align:start position:0%
and that's the key to it just because
 
01:25:12.590 --> 01:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
you're a Justice of the Peace doesn't
 
01:25:14.270 --> 01:25:14.280 align:start position:0%
mean you know enough to be able to sign
 
01:25:16.550 --> 01:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
a warrant just because you're a justice
 
01:25:18.229 --> 01:25:18.239 align:start position:0%
of the peace and you become appointed a
 
01:25:19.669 --> 01:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
bail commission it doesn't mean that you
 
01:25:21.830 --> 01:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
have all the answers until you're either
 
01:25:24.229 --> 01:25:24.239 align:start position:0%
trained or you learn the hard way the
 
01:25:27.110 --> 01:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
school of odd knocks but I have faith in
 
01:25:29.570 --> 01:25:29.580 align:start position:0%
the citizens of New Hampshire that they
 
01:25:32.510 --> 01:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
will be there to step up and do it
 
01:25:34.450 --> 01:25:34.460 align:start position:0%
as do I thank you
 
01:25:36.350 --> 01:25:36.360 align:start position:0%
for the questions thank you for your
 
01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:41.330 align:start position:0%
for the questions thank you for your
testimony

01:25:41.330 --> 01:25:41.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:43.550 --> 01:25:43.560 align:start position:0%
the chair recommend recognizes Professor
 
01:25:45.530 --> 01:25:45.540 align:start position:0%
share from them
 
01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:55.790 align:start position:0%
share from them
himself

01:25:55.790 --> 01:25:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:59.330 --> 01:25:59.340 align:start position:0%
good morning members of the committee uh
 
01:26:01.010 --> 01:26:01.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:26:04.250 --> 01:26:04.260 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to try and uh tailor my
 
01:26:06.310 --> 01:26:06.320 align:start position:0%
comments given what's already been said
 
01:26:10.310 --> 01:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
I am a professor at UNH law professor at
 
01:26:12.649 --> 01:26:12.659 align:start position:0%
UNH law I've been there this is my 29th
 
01:26:12.659 --> 01:26:14.270 align:start position:0%
UNH law I've been there this is my 29th
year

01:26:14.270 --> 01:26:14.280 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:26:15.950 --> 01:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
um before that I was a public defender
 
01:26:18.350 --> 01:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
for 13 years so all told I've been
 
01:26:20.510 --> 01:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
involved in the New Hampshire criminal
 
01:26:24.229 --> 01:26:24.239 align:start position:0%
justice system for over 40 years in
 
01:26:27.950 --> 01:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
various capacities I am also recently
 
01:26:31.070 --> 01:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
about a year and a half ago elected as a
 
01:26:34.250 --> 01:26:34.260 align:start position:0%
police commissioner in Portsmouth there
 
01:26:36.050 --> 01:26:36.060 align:start position:0%
are three of us and we are Loosely the
 
01:26:37.189 --> 01:26:37.199 align:start position:0%
board of directors for the police
 
01:26:39.830 --> 01:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
department in Portsmouth so I have a
 
01:26:41.689 --> 01:26:41.699 align:start position:0%
variety of experiences in the criminal
 
01:26:43.610 --> 01:26:43.620 align:start position:0%
justice system
 
01:26:45.649 --> 01:26:45.659 align:start position:0%
um I'm not going to go into the cost
 
01:26:49.129 --> 01:26:49.139 align:start position:0%
issues I'm very supportive of uh what Mr
 
01:26:51.649 --> 01:26:51.659 align:start position:0%
head said about the Court's cost issues
 
01:26:55.129 --> 01:26:55.139 align:start position:0%
it's a real significant problem I get
 
01:26:58.250 --> 01:26:58.260 align:start position:0%
that I don't think that portion of this
 
01:27:01.310 --> 01:27:01.320 align:start position:0%
bill which seeks to solve it by adding
 
01:27:04.250 --> 01:27:04.260 align:start position:0%
three any additional judges really
 
01:27:06.530 --> 01:27:06.540 align:start position:0%
addresses it in a full and comprehensive
 
01:27:09.350 --> 01:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
way through staffing issues that go with
 
01:27:13.850 --> 01:27:13.860 align:start position:0%
that so I would rely on on I would defer
 
01:27:16.250 --> 01:27:16.260 align:start position:0%
to what Mr head said and the court
 
01:27:18.830 --> 01:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
system says on that that's part one of
 
01:27:21.649 --> 01:27:21.659 align:start position:0%
this bill part two of this bill is the
 
01:27:25.370 --> 01:27:25.380 align:start position:0%
change in the underlying bail statute
 
01:27:30.410 --> 01:27:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:32.810 --> 01:27:32.820 align:start position:0%
I worked with Senator feltis five years
 
01:27:35.390 --> 01:27:35.400 align:start position:0%
ago in drafting the Bell Reform Bill
 
01:27:38.169 --> 01:27:38.179 align:start position:0%
that was passed so and I've been working
 
01:27:40.510 --> 01:27:40.520 align:start position:0%
with this committee
 
01:27:43.430 --> 01:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
testifying in before this Committee in
 
01:27:45.530 --> 01:27:45.540 align:start position:0%
front of the Senate Judiciary Committee
 
01:27:48.530 --> 01:27:48.540 align:start position:0%
unveil issues for five years it's
 
01:27:50.629 --> 01:27:50.639 align:start position:0%
something I care deeply about and I
 
01:27:52.790 --> 01:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
appreciate the complications that come
 
01:27:54.770 --> 01:27:54.780 align:start position:0%
with it even putting aside the cost
 
01:27:57.709 --> 01:27:57.719 align:start position:0%
issues as to the change that
 
01:28:01.550 --> 01:28:01.560 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn's Bill proposes with
 
01:28:05.090 --> 01:28:05.100 align:start position:0%
adding those I think there's 12 crimes
 
01:28:08.390 --> 01:28:08.400 align:start position:0%
where the system would deal with them
 
01:28:11.689 --> 01:28:11.699 align:start position:0%
differently and hold people until they
 
01:28:14.570 --> 01:28:14.580 align:start position:0%
see a judge I think I would say most
 
01:28:18.070 --> 01:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
simply that over incarcerates people
 
01:28:23.030 --> 01:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
without any data to support that we need
 
01:28:25.850 --> 01:28:25.860 align:start position:0%
to take that extra step to over
 
01:28:28.430 --> 01:28:28.440 align:start position:0%
incarcerate people at the front end of
 
01:28:31.310 --> 01:28:31.320 align:start position:0%
the case when we know far less about the
 
01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:32.090 align:start position:0%
the case when we know far less about the
case

01:28:32.090 --> 01:28:32.100 align:start position:0%
case
 
01:28:34.970 --> 01:28:34.980 align:start position:0%
to capture the and and I know this
 
01:28:37.070 --> 01:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
committee has struggled over the years
 
01:28:39.830 --> 01:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
with having to make decisions without
 
01:28:42.470 --> 01:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
data that's one of the fundamental
 
01:28:45.350 --> 01:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
problems we have in this area is we
 
01:28:47.149 --> 01:28:47.159 align:start position:0%
don't have data about what's really
 
01:28:48.530 --> 01:28:48.540 align:start position:0%
going on
 
01:28:50.689 --> 01:28:50.699 align:start position:0%
those are who've been on the committee
 
01:28:54.290 --> 01:28:54.300 align:start position:0%
for a while have heard anecdote after
 
01:28:57.290 --> 01:28:57.300 align:start position:0%
anecdote about the horrors of the bail
 
01:29:01.250 --> 01:29:01.260 align:start position:0%
statute and that's uh I I'll be blunt
 
01:29:04.250 --> 01:29:04.260 align:start position:0%
about it that's a false narrative
 
01:29:04.260 --> 01:29:05.930 align:start position:0%
about it that's a false narrative
uh

01:29:05.930 --> 01:29:05.940 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:29:08.689 --> 01:29:08.699 align:start position:0%
I worked with a student
 
01:29:11.450 --> 01:29:11.460 align:start position:0%
I hired a student over the summer and
 
01:29:14.090 --> 01:29:14.100 align:start position:0%
this past semester to actually gather
 
01:29:17.830 --> 01:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
data we gathered data we gathered
 
01:29:21.830 --> 01:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
508 what are called case summary sheets
 
01:29:25.129 --> 01:29:25.139 align:start position:0%
which are summarizes what is happening
 
01:29:29.570 --> 01:29:29.580 align:start position:0%
in an individual case and we got 500 we
 
01:29:31.430 --> 01:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
got over a thousand and we were able to
 
01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:32.410 align:start position:0%
got over a thousand and we were able to
process

01:29:32.410 --> 01:29:32.420 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:29:36.590 --> 01:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
508 of them that tell us what's going on
 
01:29:40.070 --> 01:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
in the case from Soup To Nuts you know
 
01:29:42.169 --> 01:29:42.179 align:start position:0%
what they were arrested for what the
 
01:29:45.169 --> 01:29:45.179 align:start position:0%
bill was set at what then transpired in
 
01:29:46.149 --> 01:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
the case
 
01:29:49.490 --> 01:29:49.500 align:start position:0%
and the story that that data
 
01:29:52.129 --> 01:29:52.139 align:start position:0%
says and I offer to you this is the
 
01:29:55.189 --> 01:29:55.199 align:start position:0%
First Data actual hard data that this
 
01:29:57.229 --> 01:29:57.239 align:start position:0%
committee has heard in five years of
 
01:30:00.590 --> 01:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
dealing with Bill reform issues what
 
01:30:02.689 --> 01:30:02.699 align:start position:0%
that data says is several
 
01:30:05.390 --> 01:30:05.400 align:start position:0%
very powerful pieces of information
 
01:30:10.790 --> 01:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
out of the 508 case summary sheets that
 
01:30:12.350 --> 01:30:12.360 align:start position:0%
we looked at
 
01:30:15.649 --> 01:30:15.659 align:start position:0%
in only four of them
 
01:30:19.790 --> 01:30:19.800 align:start position:0%
four out of 508 was there any evidence
 
01:30:23.810 --> 01:30:23.820 align:start position:0%
that the person who had been released on
 
01:30:23.820 --> 01:30:25.310 align:start position:0%
that the person who had been released on
bail

01:30:25.310 --> 01:30:25.320 align:start position:0%
bail
 
01:30:29.090 --> 01:30:29.100 align:start position:0%
was charged with a subsequent crime
 
01:30:33.350 --> 01:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
so this issue of you know the sky is
 
01:30:35.870 --> 01:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
falling dangerous people all given bail
 
01:30:38.570 --> 01:30:38.580 align:start position:0%
reform dangerous people are out there
 
01:30:40.850 --> 01:30:40.860 align:start position:0%
committed Crime After Crime because bail
 
01:30:42.830 --> 01:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
is letting them the bail system is
 
01:30:44.750 --> 01:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
letting them out is a false narrative
 
01:30:47.870 --> 01:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
there are anecdotes no question about
 
01:30:50.629 --> 01:30:50.639 align:start position:0%
that no system as large as the New
 
01:30:53.450 --> 01:30:53.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire criminal justice system is is
 
01:30:55.729 --> 01:30:55.739 align:start position:0%
going to be perfect it's not possible
 
01:31:01.970 --> 01:31:01.980 align:start position:0%
but four out of 508 number two
 
01:31:01.980 --> 01:31:05.570 align:start position:0%
but four out of 508 number two
um

01:31:05.570 --> 01:31:05.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:09.410 --> 01:31:09.420 align:start position:0%
out of those 508 cases there are a mix
 
01:31:14.090 --> 01:31:14.100 align:start position:0%
of completed cases uh from I think 2018
 
01:31:18.050 --> 01:31:18.060 align:start position:0%
or 2019 from Manchester District Court
 
01:31:20.750 --> 01:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
and Superior Court uh Hillsborough
 
01:31:22.070 --> 01:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
County security Court North the
 
01:31:24.350 --> 01:31:24.360 align:start position:0%
Manchester Superior Court we picked
 
01:31:28.189 --> 01:31:28.199 align:start position:0%
those because that is the most in terms
 
01:31:29.930 --> 01:31:29.940 align:start position:0%
of testimony we've heard over the years
 
01:31:31.330 --> 01:31:31.340 align:start position:0%
it's the most
 
01:31:35.030 --> 01:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
contested area in terms of bail reform I
 
01:31:36.229 --> 01:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
know the Manchester police department
 
01:31:39.470 --> 01:31:39.480 align:start position:0%
has very strong opinions about it
 
01:31:43.010 --> 01:31:43.020 align:start position:0%
out of the 508 cases
 
01:31:47.270 --> 01:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
35 of them all the charges were
 
01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:50.629 align:start position:0%
35 of them all the charges were
dismissed

01:31:50.629 --> 01:31:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:53.270 --> 01:31:53.280 align:start position:0%
35 percent of them
 
01:31:56.570 --> 01:31:56.580 align:start position:0%
that means if you increase the number as
 
01:31:59.689 --> 01:31:59.699 align:start position:0%
this bill does as House Bill 318 does if
 
01:32:01.910 --> 01:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
you increase the number of people who
 
01:32:04.370 --> 01:32:04.380 align:start position:0%
are being held at least in the short
 
01:32:06.830 --> 01:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
term if not longer by virtue of
 
01:32:10.790 --> 01:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:13.669 --> 01:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
remember many of them
 
01:32:16.430 --> 01:32:16.440 align:start position:0%
not only are people as Professor Davis
 
01:32:19.370 --> 01:32:19.380 align:start position:0%
said are people who are subsequently not
 
01:32:22.310 --> 01:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
going to get any jail time many of them
 
01:32:26.810 --> 01:32:26.820 align:start position:0%
are people whose cases will be dismissed
 
01:32:29.390 --> 01:32:29.400 align:start position:0%
completely yet they will have spent
 
01:32:33.169 --> 01:32:33.179 align:start position:0%
anywhere from one to four days in jail
 
01:32:35.390 --> 01:32:35.400 align:start position:0%
creating the havoc in their lives that
 
01:32:37.790 --> 01:32:37.800 align:start position:0%
Professor Davis talked about
 
01:32:37.800 --> 01:32:39.709 align:start position:0%
Professor Davis talked about
third

01:32:39.709 --> 01:32:39.719 align:start position:0%
third
 
01:32:44.030 --> 01:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
out of the 330 plus cases that we looked
 
01:32:45.490 --> 01:32:45.500 align:start position:0%
at from
 
01:32:49.209 --> 01:32:49.219 align:start position:0%
Superior Court in Manchester
 
01:32:55.010 --> 01:32:55.020 align:start position:0%
fully 78 of them were drug cases
 
01:32:58.250 --> 01:32:58.260 align:start position:0%
relatively speaking victimless
 
01:33:00.110 --> 01:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
crime cases
 
01:33:01.550 --> 01:33:01.560 align:start position:0%
other than
 
01:33:05.390 --> 01:33:05.400 align:start position:0%
the defendants or themselves who are the
 
01:33:08.149 --> 01:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
primary victims in drug cases they're
 
01:33:10.930 --> 01:33:10.940 align:start position:0%
certainly exceptions to that but
 
01:33:16.129 --> 01:33:16.139 align:start position:0%
78 of those cases were drug cases drug
 
01:33:19.010 --> 01:33:19.020 align:start position:0%
cases are overwhelming
 
01:33:20.990 --> 01:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
the court system
 
01:33:25.490 --> 01:33:25.500 align:start position:0%
and they are not the kind of cases that
 
01:33:25.500 --> 01:33:27.169 align:start position:0%
and they are not the kind of cases that
uh

01:33:27.169 --> 01:33:27.179 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:33:31.209 --> 01:33:31.219 align:start position:0%
are the Solutions in those cases
 
01:33:35.870 --> 01:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
are rarely involved successful Solutions
 
01:33:39.169 --> 01:33:39.179 align:start position:0%
rarely involved incarcerating people
 
01:33:41.270 --> 01:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
I think as Professor David said David
 
01:33:42.709 --> 01:33:42.719 align:start position:0%
said the
 
01:33:44.570 --> 01:33:44.580 align:start position:0%
criminal legal system the criminal
 
01:33:47.810 --> 01:33:47.820 align:start position:0%
justice system is not good is not
 
01:33:51.590 --> 01:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
designed and is not good at solving
 
01:33:53.930 --> 01:33:53.940 align:start position:0%
the problem of one house people of
 
01:33:56.090 --> 01:33:56.100 align:start position:0%
solving the problem of people with
 
01:33:58.189 --> 01:33:58.199 align:start position:0%
significant addictions of solving the
 
01:33:59.689 --> 01:33:59.699 align:start position:0%
problem with people with significant
 
01:34:02.209 --> 01:34:02.219 align:start position:0%
mental health issues yet in the absence
 
01:34:06.050 --> 01:34:06.060 align:start position:0%
of other systems available we've been
 
01:34:08.209 --> 01:34:08.219 align:start position:0%
trying to jury rate the criminal justice
 
01:34:11.450 --> 01:34:11.460 align:start position:0%
system uh to do that and and and it's
 
01:34:13.850 --> 01:34:13.860 align:start position:0%
not working particularly well we're over
 
01:34:16.010 --> 01:34:16.020 align:start position:0%
incarcerating people
 
01:34:21.070 --> 01:34:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:25.970 --> 01:34:25.980 align:start position:0%
there is plenty of opportunity and
 
01:34:28.970 --> 01:34:28.980 align:start position:0%
statutory Authority Under the current
 
01:34:33.649 --> 01:34:33.659 align:start position:0%
bail statute as it exists to handle
 
01:34:38.030 --> 01:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
dangerous people rather than using what
 
01:34:40.910 --> 01:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
uh representative Lynn's Bill does is
 
01:34:43.129 --> 01:34:43.139 align:start position:0%
for certain crimes using a
 
01:34:45.470 --> 01:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
one-size-fits-all approach
 
01:34:47.689 --> 01:34:47.699 align:start position:0%
the system is currently set up that
 
01:34:50.390 --> 01:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
judges make decisions in individual
 
01:34:54.169 --> 01:34:54.179 align:start position:0%
cases and that's working based on the
 
01:34:56.750 --> 01:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
data that we've collected so
 
01:34:59.750 --> 01:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
I encourage you not to be seduced by the
 
01:35:01.490 --> 01:35:01.500 align:start position:0%
false narrative that something is
 
01:35:04.070 --> 01:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
fundamentally wrong with our bail system
 
01:35:08.090 --> 01:35:08.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:12.970 --> 01:35:12.980 align:start position:0%
um don't be deluded by uh
 
01:35:16.669 --> 01:35:16.679 align:start position:0%
by anecdote horror stories
 
01:35:19.129 --> 01:35:19.139 align:start position:0%
because they exist and they're always
 
01:35:20.689 --> 01:35:20.699 align:start position:0%
going to exist no matter what kind of
 
01:35:22.310 --> 01:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
build system we have
 
01:35:25.129 --> 01:35:25.139 align:start position:0%
but overall the system is working really
 
01:35:27.490 --> 01:35:27.500 align:start position:0%
well finally
 
01:35:31.129 --> 01:35:31.139 align:start position:0%
I am in support of Representative uh
 
01:35:34.430 --> 01:35:34.440 align:start position:0%
Herod gathright's uh magistrate bill I
 
01:35:37.010 --> 01:35:37.020 align:start position:0%
think it's in the long term the right
 
01:35:40.129 --> 01:35:40.139 align:start position:0%
approach to handle one part of the bail
 
01:35:43.390 --> 01:35:43.400 align:start position:0%
system that has had somewhat erratic
 
01:35:47.090 --> 01:35:47.100 align:start position:0%
issues that is bail Commissioners as I
 
01:35:48.830 --> 01:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
think representative Lynn said there are
 
01:35:51.470 --> 01:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
some excellent very devoted bail
 
01:35:52.930 --> 01:35:52.940 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and you've heard from them
 
01:35:56.390 --> 01:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
but I'm also aware that there there are
 
01:35:56.400 --> 01:35:57.770 align:start position:0%
but I'm also aware that there there are
uh

01:35:57.770 --> 01:35:57.780 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:36:00.830 --> 01:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
uh Bell Commissioners who are less
 
01:36:04.490 --> 01:36:04.500 align:start position:0%
available and are not uh real in the
 
01:36:06.890 --> 01:36:06.900 align:start position:0%
eyes of both police departments
 
01:36:10.990 --> 01:36:11.000 align:start position:0%
um and defense lawyers are are not
 
01:36:13.910 --> 01:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
understanding the nature of the
 
01:36:15.350 --> 01:36:15.360 align:start position:0%
authority they have under the male
 
01:36:19.790 --> 01:36:19.800 align:start position:0%
statute so I would urge you uh to vote
 
01:36:23.330 --> 01:36:23.340 align:start position:0%
itl on this bill and I will be here next
 
01:36:26.590 --> 01:36:26.600 align:start position:0%
week to testify uh in favor of

bill
 
01:36:32.810 --> 01:36:32.820 align:start position:0%
um I you know I think we either need to
 
01:36:35.030 --> 01:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
pass that bill
 
01:36:36.830 --> 01:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
um and extend
 
01:36:39.350 --> 01:36:39.360 align:start position:0%
the time of implementation significantly
 
01:36:41.750 --> 01:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
or we need to put together a study
 
01:36:44.990 --> 01:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
committee that pulls in the courts the
 
01:36:46.669 --> 01:36:46.679 align:start position:0%
criminal defense Community the
 
01:36:50.450 --> 01:36:50.460 align:start position:0%
prosecutors the police to uh really have
 
01:36:53.149 --> 01:36:53.159 align:start position:0%
a staff a comprehensive Staffing be it
 
01:36:55.970 --> 01:36:55.980 align:start position:0%
judges or staff solution I'll talk about
 
01:36:57.890 --> 01:36:57.900 align:start position:0%
that more next week more than willing to
 
01:37:01.030 --> 01:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:03.110 --> 01:37:03.120 align:start position:0%
there have been no questions thank you
 
01:37:04.189 --> 01:37:04.199 align:start position:0%
for your testimony and we'll see you
 
01:37:08.290 --> 01:37:08.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:10.850 --> 01:37:10.860 align:start position:0%

01:37:32.870 --> 01:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman members of the committee is
 
01:37:34.430 --> 01:37:34.440 align:start position:0%
this on
 
01:37:35.990 --> 01:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to testify
 
01:37:37.610 --> 01:37:37.620 align:start position:0%
today my name is Frank Knack I'm the
 
01:37:40.370 --> 01:37:40.380 align:start position:0%
policy director uh with the ACLU of New
 
01:37:41.810 --> 01:37:41.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we are here in opposition
 
01:37:46.550 --> 01:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
to HB 318. Professor sharer talked about
 
01:37:48.169 --> 01:37:48.179 align:start position:0%
um the anecdotes that you've heard and
 
01:37:49.850 --> 01:37:49.860 align:start position:0%
that I'm sure you will hear this session
 
01:37:53.090 --> 01:37:53.100 align:start position:0%
around bail reform and to not kind of
 
01:37:54.950 --> 01:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
look at those anecdotes as what's really
 
01:37:56.870 --> 01:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
happening on the ground and I can't
 
01:37:59.330 --> 01:37:59.340 align:start position:0%
reiterate that strongly enough and I
 
01:38:00.950 --> 01:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
think you know the the thing that's been
 
01:38:02.990 --> 01:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
missing with a lot of the debate is what
 
01:38:04.790 --> 01:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
are the specific facts in each of those
 
01:38:07.070 --> 01:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
cases and how has current bail law
 
01:38:09.410 --> 01:38:09.420 align:start position:0%
failed in those cases and we have not
 
01:38:11.570 --> 01:38:11.580 align:start position:0%
heard any evidence of that and so if you
 
01:38:13.790 --> 01:38:13.800 align:start position:0%
look in the packet that I gave you
 
01:38:15.530 --> 01:38:15.540 align:start position:0%
now you'll see a few things you'll see
 
01:38:17.810 --> 01:38:17.820 align:start position:0%
our fact sheet but you'll also see a
 
01:38:20.450 --> 01:38:20.460 align:start position:0%
document that lists uh by code section
 
01:38:23.750 --> 01:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
all of the numerous tools currently in
 
01:38:26.209 --> 01:38:26.219 align:start position:0%
the law that allow people who have
 
01:38:28.790 --> 01:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
reoffended to be held
 
01:38:31.129 --> 01:38:31.139 align:start position:0%
um it clarifies very clearly in black
 
01:38:32.930 --> 01:38:32.940 align:start position:0%
and white that anyone under current law
 
01:38:35.390 --> 01:38:35.400 align:start position:0%
anyone who is a danger or a Flight Risk
 
01:38:37.729 --> 01:38:37.739 align:start position:0%
to the community can be held regardless
 
01:38:40.729 --> 01:38:40.739 align:start position:0%
of the fence and another issue that was
 
01:38:42.709 --> 01:38:42.719 align:start position:0%
raised last year and we didn't get a
 
01:38:44.570 --> 01:38:44.580 align:start position:0%
sufficient answer I believe from the um
 
01:38:45.950 --> 01:38:45.960 align:start position:0%
from those proponents of this
 
01:38:48.950 --> 01:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
legislation is that under current law a
 
01:38:51.770 --> 01:38:51.780 align:start position:0%
prosecutor the state can challenge any
 
01:38:53.570 --> 01:38:53.580 align:start position:0%
release order that they disagree with
 
01:38:55.490 --> 01:38:55.500 align:start position:0%
and so when we're hearing these
 
01:38:57.890 --> 01:38:57.900 align:start position:0%
anecdotal stories we're not hearing in
 
01:38:59.750 --> 01:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
each of those cases you know did they
 
01:39:02.689 --> 01:39:02.699 align:start position:0%
challenge the release order because from
 
01:39:04.129 --> 01:39:04.139 align:start position:0%
our perspective we have heard that they
 
01:39:07.070 --> 01:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
are did they challenge you know did they
 
01:39:08.689 --> 01:39:08.699 align:start position:0%
use the tools they have to have the
 
01:39:11.270 --> 01:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
person uh incarcerated when they're
 
01:39:13.010 --> 01:39:13.020 align:start position:0%
reoffended because they have that tool
 
01:39:14.330 --> 01:39:14.340 align:start position:0%
right now and so we think those are
 
01:39:16.550 --> 01:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
really important factors to include this
 
01:39:19.430 --> 01:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
debate the other the other issue that I
 
01:39:21.890 --> 01:39:21.900 align:start position:0%
want to lift up among a few others is
 
01:39:24.110 --> 01:39:24.120 align:start position:0%
that we've also heard that bail reform
 
01:39:26.450 --> 01:39:26.460 align:start position:0%
has made our communities less safe
 
01:39:28.370 --> 01:39:28.380 align:start position:0%
and so while we have only been provided
 
01:39:31.010 --> 01:39:31.020 align:start position:0%
some anecdotes without detail to to make
 
01:39:33.890 --> 01:39:33.900 align:start position:0%
that challenge we've seen no hard data
 
01:39:35.990 --> 01:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
and so the data that we do have right
 
01:39:37.610 --> 01:39:37.620 align:start position:0%
now is the data from the Department of
 
01:39:41.209 --> 01:39:41.219 align:start position:0%
Safety around our crimes and arrests and
 
01:39:43.430 --> 01:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
so if you go back to 2018 the year of
 
01:39:45.890 --> 01:39:45.900 align:start position:0%
bail reform and you actually look at the
 
01:39:48.649 --> 01:39:48.659 align:start position:0%
crime data overall New Hampshire You
 
01:39:49.970 --> 01:39:49.980 align:start position:0%
know despite the rhetoric we've heard
 
01:39:53.270 --> 01:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
crime is down 18 for group a offenses so
 
01:39:55.850 --> 01:39:55.860 align:start position:0%
that's the vast majority of offenses 18
 
01:39:58.490 --> 01:39:58.500 align:start position:0%
percent and in the jurisdiction where we
 
01:40:01.070 --> 01:40:01.080 align:start position:0%
heard the Chiefs testified last year in
 
01:40:02.930 --> 01:40:02.940 align:start position:0%
Manchester and Bedford in Manchester
 
01:40:05.629 --> 01:40:05.639 align:start position:0%
crimes down 13 since bail reform in
 
01:40:08.570 --> 01:40:08.580 align:start position:0%
Bedford it's down over 21 since Bill
 
01:40:10.910 --> 01:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
reform and so the notion that bail
 
01:40:12.350 --> 01:40:12.360 align:start position:0%
reform has somehow made our communities
 
01:40:15.229 --> 01:40:15.239 align:start position:0%
less safe again is not supported by the
 
01:40:17.450 --> 01:40:17.460 align:start position:0%
facts I also really think it's important
 
01:40:18.850 --> 01:40:18.860 align:start position:0%
we had
 
01:40:20.870 --> 01:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn talked earlier about
 
01:40:23.030 --> 01:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
ftas and the fact that this legislation
 
01:40:25.550 --> 01:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
is further restricting the discussion
 
01:40:28.610 --> 01:40:28.620 align:start position:0%
that judges have around ftas and
 
01:40:31.250 --> 01:40:31.260 align:start position:0%
allowing folks to um to not be
 
01:40:34.010 --> 01:40:34.020 align:start position:0%
necessarily held under ftas so the
 
01:40:36.169 --> 01:40:36.179 align:start position:0%
Rockefeller Center at Dartmouth did a
 
01:40:38.510 --> 01:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
study of ftas a few years ago
 
01:40:40.610 --> 01:40:40.620 align:start position:0%
and this is what they found of the top
 
01:40:43.430 --> 01:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
five reasons that people fail to appear
 
01:40:45.910 --> 01:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
four of them are Child Care
 
01:40:48.770 --> 01:40:48.780 align:start position:0%
Transportation employment or they forgot
 
01:40:51.649 --> 01:40:51.659 align:start position:0%
and so taking away a judge's discretion
 
01:40:53.629 --> 01:40:53.639 align:start position:0%
to determine the facts in that case and
 
01:40:55.189 --> 01:40:55.199 align:start position:0%
whether or not that person should be
 
01:40:57.470 --> 01:40:57.480 align:start position:0%
held particularly before the top five
 
01:40:59.390 --> 01:40:59.400 align:start position:0%
are things of these nature we think is
 
01:41:02.750 --> 01:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
very problematic and again they're data
 
01:41:04.550 --> 01:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
driven tools so when people forget
 
01:41:06.649 --> 01:41:06.659 align:start position:0%
there's lots of research going on right
 
01:41:08.689 --> 01:41:08.699 align:start position:0%
now around ways to help handle that like
 
01:41:10.550 --> 01:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
test text message alerts you know the
 
01:41:12.470 --> 01:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
MacArthur safety and Justice challenges
 
01:41:15.229 --> 01:41:15.239 align:start position:0%
have been doing this across the country
 
01:41:15.239 --> 01:41:17.990 align:start position:0%
have been doing this across the country
um

01:41:17.990 --> 01:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:19.970 --> 01:41:19.980 align:start position:0%
it also I really want to I think it's
 
01:41:21.410 --> 01:41:21.420 align:start position:0%
important to point out
 
01:41:23.450 --> 01:41:23.460 align:start position:0%
that not only have they not provided any
 
01:41:25.550 --> 01:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
data to support their claims but they're
 
01:41:28.010 --> 01:41:28.020 align:start position:0%
also ignoring the robust research that
 
01:41:29.750 --> 01:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
has been you know decades in the making
 
01:41:31.790 --> 01:41:31.800 align:start position:0%
including a major study last year by
 
01:41:34.490 --> 01:41:34.500 align:start position:0%
Arnold ventures in Kentucky that looked
 
01:41:37.250 --> 01:41:37.260 align:start position:0%
at 1.5 million people who were jailed
 
01:41:40.910 --> 01:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
between 20 2009 and 2018 and so prior to
 
01:41:42.770 --> 01:41:42.780 align:start position:0%
this study there was a common belief
 
01:41:44.390 --> 01:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
that you know if you are held by more
 
01:41:46.550 --> 01:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
than 24 hours the likelihood of
 
01:41:49.250 --> 01:41:49.260 align:start position:0%
reoffending increased because as we
 
01:41:51.169 --> 01:41:51.179 align:start position:0%
heard you know you're removed from your
 
01:41:52.910 --> 01:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
community removed from your job either
 
01:41:55.310 --> 01:41:55.320 align:start position:0%
collateral harms are severe what this
 
01:41:57.830 --> 01:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
most recent study found in 1.5 million
 
01:42:00.169 --> 01:42:00.179 align:start position:0%
people overnight a 10-year period is
 
01:42:02.590 --> 01:42:02.600 align:start position:0%
that any incarceration pre-trial
 
01:42:04.669 --> 01:42:04.679 align:start position:0%
increases the likelihood that someone
 
01:42:06.290 --> 01:42:06.300 align:start position:0%
will reoffend because they're being
 
01:42:07.790 --> 01:42:07.800 align:start position:0%
removed from their community and so
 
01:42:09.229 --> 01:42:09.239 align:start position:0%
that's not saying that no one should be
 
01:42:10.970 --> 01:42:10.980 align:start position:0%
held it's saying that the way our
 
01:42:12.470 --> 01:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
current law is written which ensures
 
01:42:14.689 --> 01:42:14.699 align:start position:0%
discretion but that anyone can be held
 
01:42:16.310 --> 01:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
if the judge in that individual case
 
01:42:18.590 --> 01:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
finds them to be a danger or a Flight
 
01:42:20.270 --> 01:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
Risk is the standard that we should
 
01:42:22.310 --> 01:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
maintain in New Hampshire happy to
 
01:42:27.229 --> 01:42:27.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:29.030 --> 01:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
there'll be no questions thank you for
 
01:42:31.669 --> 01:42:31.679 align:start position:0%
your testimony this morning
 
01:42:33.229 --> 01:42:33.239 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who hasn't filled
 
01:42:34.729 --> 01:42:34.739 align:start position:0%
out a pin card or wish to testify
 
01:42:41.570 --> 01:42:41.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:47.090 --> 01:42:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:49.250 --> 01:42:49.260 align:start position:0%
I know this is running long but it's
 
01:42:51.950 --> 01:42:51.960 align:start position:0%
important so I'm sorry I hope my remarks
 
01:42:53.629 --> 01:42:53.639 align:start position:0%
are worth listening to
 
01:42:56.870 --> 01:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh I have been a bail commissioner for
 
01:43:00.490 --> 01:43:00.500 align:start position:0%
22 years I've done
 
01:43:03.169 --> 01:43:03.179 align:start position:0%
3375 bales
 
01:43:05.390 --> 01:43:05.400 align:start position:0%
I don't want to pick there are a couple
 
01:43:07.310 --> 01:43:07.320 align:start position:0%
of quick slides that I would like to
 
01:43:10.370 --> 01:43:10.380 align:start position:0%
swat first there is no four recording uh
 
01:43:12.770 --> 01:43:12.780 align:start position:0%
Judge Lynn or excuse me representative
 
01:43:15.410 --> 01:43:15.420 align:start position:0%
didn't know it didn't say it there are
 
01:43:17.870 --> 01:43:17.880 align:start position:0%
no formal procedures for removing a bail
 
01:43:20.030 --> 01:43:20.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner but practically speaking
 
01:43:22.129 --> 01:43:22.139 align:start position:0%
all that happens is the judge calls the
 
01:43:23.689 --> 01:43:23.699 align:start position:0%
police department says don't call this
 
01:43:26.390 --> 01:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
guy if you go to the Judicial website
 
01:43:30.050 --> 01:43:30.060 align:start position:0%
you'll see a list of decommissioned uh
 
01:43:33.109 --> 01:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
bail commissioners
 
01:43:36.890 --> 01:43:36.900 align:start position:0%
there is uh I want to take some I'm
 
01:43:39.410 --> 01:43:39.420 align:start position:0%
taking real exception at the idea that
 
01:43:41.990 --> 01:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
magistrates no better can set fails
 
01:43:45.950 --> 01:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
better than uh fail Commissioners and
 
01:43:49.490 --> 01:43:49.500 align:start position:0%
pardon my umbrage but look I have I made
 
01:43:51.649 --> 01:43:51.659 align:start position:0%
it a point when I was first starting and
 
01:43:54.530 --> 01:43:54.540 align:start position:0%
I still continue here and there to check
 
01:43:57.830 --> 01:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
what the Superior Court does with my
 
01:43:57.840 --> 01:43:59.209 align:start position:0%
what the Superior Court does with my
recommendations

01:43:59.209 --> 01:43:59.219 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
01:44:02.090 --> 01:44:02.100 align:start position:0%
in total now I don't know how many I've
 
01:44:04.850 --> 01:44:04.860 align:start position:0%
done maybe you have a couple dozen of
 
01:44:08.629 --> 01:44:08.639 align:start position:0%
checks no judge has ever changed I have
 
01:44:11.629 --> 01:44:11.639 align:start position:0%
had two of my Bales changed one was
 
01:44:14.330 --> 01:44:14.340 align:start position:0%
increase and the other was moved from
 
01:44:18.590 --> 01:44:18.600 align:start position:0%
the bail to preventive detention so
 
01:44:18.600 --> 01:44:20.510 align:start position:0%
the bail to preventive detention so
I'm

01:44:20.510 --> 01:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
01:44:24.850 --> 01:44:24.860 align:start position:0%
I trust the bail commissioners
 
01:44:28.490 --> 01:44:28.500 align:start position:0%
I heard a statistic that 4 out of 508
 
01:44:32.149 --> 01:44:32.159 align:start position:0%
where'd he go uh the uh look
 
01:44:32.159 --> 01:44:33.890 align:start position:0%
where'd he go uh the uh look
yesterday

01:44:33.890 --> 01:44:33.900 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
01:44:36.649 --> 01:44:36.659 align:start position:0%
there's a guy arrested for domestic
 
01:44:38.090 --> 01:44:38.100 align:start position:0%
violence who was out on bail for
 
01:44:40.669 --> 01:44:40.679 align:start position:0%
shoplifting I wasn't prepared to think
 
01:44:42.410 --> 01:44:42.420 align:start position:0%
about this but I know there's been a
 
01:44:45.470 --> 01:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
couple others in the past month that can
 
01:44:47.830 --> 01:44:47.840 align:start position:0%
have committed
 
01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
offenses while on bail it's not the main
 
01:44:53.270 --> 01:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
purpose of what I'm saying but I heard
 
01:44:57.050 --> 01:44:57.060 align:start position:0%
those remarks those it's hard to take
 
01:44:59.450 --> 01:44:59.460 align:start position:0%
statistics seriously sometimes you want
 
01:45:01.250 --> 01:45:01.260 align:start position:0%
to and you then you see your own
 
01:45:03.830 --> 01:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
experience and you wonder
 
01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:05.149 align:start position:0%
experience and you wonder
uh

01:45:05.149 --> 01:45:05.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:45:08.689 --> 01:45:08.699 align:start position:0%
I am testifying in opposition and uh to
 
01:45:11.930 --> 01:45:11.940 align:start position:0%
this bill I hope my experience I'd like
 
01:45:13.550 --> 01:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
to share my experience I hope that it's
 
01:45:15.830 --> 01:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
helpful I think
 
01:45:17.450 --> 01:45:17.460 align:start position:0%
from what I've heard I'm going to try to
 
01:45:19.189 --> 01:45:19.199 align:start position:0%
offer some different Slants and some
 
01:45:21.470 --> 01:45:21.480 align:start position:0%
mention some things that weren't talked
 
01:45:23.290 --> 01:45:23.300 align:start position:0%
about at all
 
01:45:25.790 --> 01:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
I believe this bill will work against
 
01:45:28.189 --> 01:45:28.199 align:start position:0%
the liberty interest of those arrested
 
01:45:30.770 --> 01:45:30.780 align:start position:0%
by detaining them longer whether they're
 
01:45:33.470 --> 01:45:33.480 align:start position:0%
retained waiting for a bail Commissioner
 
01:45:35.990 --> 01:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
of Clerk of Courts a magistrate whoever
 
01:45:39.290 --> 01:45:39.300 align:start position:0%
it's just this real an incarceration as
 
01:45:42.050 --> 01:45:42.060 align:start position:0%
if they were found by by judicial
 
01:45:42.060 --> 01:45:43.129 align:start position:0%
if they were found by by judicial
process

01:45:43.129 --> 01:45:43.139 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:45:46.910 --> 01:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
uh the uh I'm going to say that the
 
01:45:49.490 --> 01:45:49.500 align:start position:0%
present system of bail commissions with
 
01:45:51.649 --> 01:45:51.659 align:start position:0%
a hundred of them uh covering the state
 
01:45:54.470 --> 01:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
is like democracy it may not be the best
 
01:45:56.209 --> 01:45:56.219 align:start position:0%
system but it's better than the
 
01:45:59.390 --> 01:45:59.400 align:start position:0%
Alternatives that I have seen offered
 
01:46:02.149 --> 01:46:02.159 align:start position:0%
uh the why of this bill is important I'm
 
01:46:03.590 --> 01:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
about a quarter of the way through by
 
01:46:05.810 --> 01:46:05.820 align:start position:0%
the way uh the why of this bill is
 
01:46:07.850 --> 01:46:07.860 align:start position:0%
important before today bail
 
01:46:10.550 --> 01:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
Commissioners have attracted almost no
 
01:46:13.430 --> 01:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
legislative interest or concern there's
 
01:46:15.770 --> 01:46:15.780 align:start position:0%
been recent controversy concerning bail
 
01:46:18.290 --> 01:46:18.300 align:start position:0%
reform and it continues today
 
01:46:21.169 --> 01:46:21.179 align:start position:0%
P38 coming up
 
01:46:23.450 --> 01:46:23.460 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner has been caught in the
 
01:46:26.750 --> 01:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
crossfire of competing considerations in
 
01:46:30.169 --> 01:46:30.179 align:start position:0%
an effect have been held responsible for
 
01:46:34.010 --> 01:46:34.020 align:start position:0%
cash bails excessive cash bails in my
 
01:46:36.470 --> 01:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
experience this is not so bail
 
01:46:38.330 --> 01:46:38.340 align:start position:0%
Commissioners follow the their
 
01:46:40.430 --> 01:46:40.440 align:start position:0%
instructional handbook and the
 
01:46:42.410 --> 01:46:42.420 align:start position:0%
instructions of their District Court
 
01:46:47.209 --> 01:46:47.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:49.669 --> 01:46:49.679 align:start position:0%
at a conference a couple years ago look
 
01:46:51.590 --> 01:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
I live in the real world I've done this
 
01:46:53.270 --> 01:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
for a long time
 
01:46:55.609 --> 01:46:55.619 align:start position:0%
at a conference a couple years ago I
 
01:46:58.129 --> 01:46:58.139 align:start position:0%
won't mention the judge's name he said I
 
01:47:00.109 --> 01:47:00.119 align:start position:0%
don't have the exact quote but it was
 
01:47:03.290 --> 01:47:03.300 align:start position:0%
like this I don't know where we exactly
 
01:47:06.109 --> 01:47:06.119 align:start position:0%
where we stand in all this talking about
 
01:47:08.750 --> 01:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
judicial form cash fails all of that
 
01:47:11.450 --> 01:47:11.460 align:start position:0%
whole miasma
 
01:47:14.990 --> 01:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
uh so what is likely to happen uh
 
01:47:16.790 --> 01:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:47:20.390 --> 01:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh uh let's see where am I for a bail
 
01:47:22.790 --> 01:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
which includes a bail includes the right
 
01:47:24.530 --> 01:47:24.540 align:start position:0%
to speak to the bail commissioner about
 
01:47:26.450 --> 01:47:26.460 align:start position:0%
their bail conditions what cash is
 
01:47:28.490 --> 01:47:28.500 align:start position:0%
involved or otherwise
 
01:47:30.830 --> 01:47:30.840 align:start position:0%
in the proposed system the arrested
 
01:47:35.629 --> 01:47:35.639 align:start position:0%
arrested person will wait longer and we
 
01:47:37.790 --> 01:47:37.800 align:start position:0%
try as bail Commissioners to be there
 
01:47:41.390 --> 01:47:41.400 align:start position:0%
within 30 minutes or have 45 minutes is
 
01:47:43.729 --> 01:47:43.739 align:start position:0%
the kind of time if it's longer than
 
01:47:46.850 --> 01:47:46.860 align:start position:0%
that we pass it off at least I do it how
 
01:47:48.470 --> 01:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
do I know this
 
01:47:51.709 --> 01:47:51.719 align:start position:0%
from time to time I bail somebody's had
 
01:47:54.290 --> 01:47:54.300 align:start position:0%
experience in Massachusetts and you'd be
 
01:47:57.470 --> 01:47:57.480 align:start position:0%
amazed at how many suspended licenses
 
01:47:59.510 --> 01:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
this occurs
 
01:48:02.810 --> 01:48:02.820 align:start position:0%
uh they are amazed when they see me and
 
01:48:05.030 --> 01:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
they thank me because they say in
 
01:48:08.030 --> 01:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts they have waited hours for
 
01:48:11.270 --> 01:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
the clerk of court to show up
 
01:48:13.850 --> 01:48:13.860 align:start position:0%
the proposed system will soon likely
 
01:48:15.229 --> 01:48:15.239 align:start position:0%
spring a leak
 
01:48:17.570 --> 01:48:17.580 align:start position:0%
what I mean by that is this
 
01:48:19.370 --> 01:48:19.380 align:start position:0%
where were you at two o'clock this
 
01:48:19.380 --> 01:48:20.209 align:start position:0%
where were you at two o'clock this
morning

01:48:20.209 --> 01:48:20.219 align:start position:0%
morning
 
01:48:22.910 --> 01:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you where I was I was driving
 
01:48:26.090 --> 01:48:26.100 align:start position:0%
to Parkland Hospital from Salem to Derry
 
01:48:29.510 --> 01:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
to bail a bedside Bale for a domestic
 
01:48:31.669 --> 01:48:31.679 align:start position:0%
violence uh
 
01:48:35.689 --> 01:48:35.699 align:start position:0%
suspect the issue was they wanted him
 
01:48:38.330 --> 01:48:38.340 align:start position:0%
bailed before he had an operation in the
 
01:48:40.910 --> 01:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
course of the altercation here he also
 
01:48:43.850 --> 01:48:43.860 align:start position:0%
hurt himself which for him I suppose but
 
01:48:47.090 --> 01:48:47.100 align:start position:0%
they wanted him out of police custody so
 
01:48:48.770 --> 01:48:48.780 align:start position:0%
I'm going up by the way I didn't get
 
01:48:51.050 --> 01:48:51.060 align:start position:0%
paid it was that was just on the house
 
01:48:52.430 --> 01:48:52.440 align:start position:0%
that's life
 
01:48:55.189 --> 01:48:55.199 align:start position:0%
I knew that we all knew that it comes
 
01:48:57.709 --> 01:48:57.719 align:start position:0%
with the territory when we became bail
 
01:49:01.189 --> 01:49:01.199 align:start position:0%
Commissioners when as a side of Judge
 
01:49:03.410 --> 01:49:03.420 align:start position:0%
Corby asked me long ago to be a bell
 
01:49:05.270 --> 01:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
commission I didn't know what it was he
 
01:49:07.189 --> 01:49:07.199 align:start position:0%
just evaluated that I had some common
 
01:49:10.790 --> 01:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
sense I guess and I did it because I
 
01:49:12.649 --> 01:49:12.659 align:start position:0%
thought it was a good thing to do for
 
01:49:14.450 --> 01:49:14.460 align:start position:0%
the community the money was I guess
 
01:49:17.030 --> 01:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
that's nice beer money I suppose but
 
01:49:20.629 --> 01:49:20.639 align:start position:0%
it's not why I do it or why others to
 
01:49:23.510 --> 01:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
perhaps the art let me leave that
 
01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:25.370 align:start position:0%
perhaps the art let me leave that
um

01:49:25.370 --> 01:49:25.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:28.010 --> 01:49:28.020 align:start position:0%
okay the
 
01:49:28.020 --> 01:49:28.790 align:start position:0%
okay the
um

01:49:28.790 --> 01:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:31.550 --> 01:49:31.560 align:start position:0%
I I guess what I'm talking about I don't
 
01:49:34.430 --> 01:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
see a district court judge or
 
01:49:36.530 --> 01:49:36.540 align:start position:0%
perhaps even a magistrate getting up at
 
01:49:38.570 --> 01:49:38.580 align:start position:0%
two in the morning to afford a
 
01:49:41.629 --> 01:49:41.639 align:start position:0%
constitutional right to somebody who
 
01:49:44.510 --> 01:49:44.520 align:start position:0%
requires who is entitled to a bail we
 
01:49:46.669 --> 01:49:46.679 align:start position:0%
take that seriously
 
01:49:49.910 --> 01:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
I take it seriously
 
01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:51.010 align:start position:0%
I take it seriously
um

01:49:51.010 --> 01:49:51.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:53.209 --> 01:49:53.219 align:start position:0%
you've heard that these Fair
 
01:49:54.830 --> 01:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
Commissioners don't cost the state
 
01:49:54.840 --> 01:49:56.090 align:start position:0%
Commissioners don't cost the state
anything

01:49:56.090 --> 01:49:56.100 align:start position:0%
anything
 
01:49:58.490 --> 01:49:58.500 align:start position:0%
but this bill will cost over a million
 
01:50:00.229 --> 01:50:00.239 align:start position:0%
you've heard that but what you didn't
 
01:50:01.970 --> 01:50:01.980 align:start position:0%
remember well you may not have
 
01:50:04.070 --> 01:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
remembered is that there's a competing
 
01:50:05.930 --> 01:50:05.940 align:start position:0%
constitutional right and that's the
 
01:50:10.010 --> 01:50:10.020 align:start position:0%
right to public defenders we heard
 
01:50:13.010 --> 01:50:13.020 align:start position:0%
when we had our orientation that the
 
01:50:14.930 --> 01:50:14.940 align:start position:0%
public defender's office wants 15
 
01:50:16.430 --> 01:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
million bucks do you think they're going
 
01:50:18.350 --> 01:50:18.360 align:start position:0%
to get it where are we going to find a
 
01:50:21.530 --> 01:50:21.540 align:start position:0%
million for this or a million
 
01:50:23.149 --> 01:50:23.159 align:start position:0%
it's unlikely
 
01:50:27.530 --> 01:50:27.540 align:start position:0%
so I think public defenders are more
 
01:50:29.750 --> 01:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
important than a system that is
 
01:50:32.090 --> 01:50:32.100 align:start position:0%
presently working
 
01:50:32.100 --> 01:50:34.310 align:start position:0%
presently working
uh

01:50:34.310 --> 01:50:34.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:50:38.330 --> 01:50:38.340 align:start position:0%
okay I am reflecting firstly the four
 
01:50:40.010 --> 01:50:40.020 align:start position:0%
Salem bail Commissioners I know
 
01:50:41.689 --> 01:50:41.699 align:start position:0%
sprinkling of others in Rockingham
 
01:50:43.790 --> 01:50:43.800 align:start position:0%
County there's no formal organization
 
01:50:45.229 --> 01:50:45.239 align:start position:0%
but we talk
 
01:50:47.990 --> 01:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm not very different from other
 
01:50:50.390 --> 01:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
bail Commissioners that I know
 
01:50:52.189 --> 01:50:52.199 align:start position:0%
the bill also has some technical
 
01:50:54.709 --> 01:50:54.719 align:start position:0%
problems and I'll leave with that
 
01:50:54.719 --> 01:50:55.790 align:start position:0%
problems and I'll leave with that
um

01:50:55.790 --> 01:50:55.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:00.649 --> 01:51:00.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:04.310 --> 01:51:04.320 align:start position:0%
line 12 H2 if I remember correctly so
 
01:51:06.590 --> 01:51:06.600 align:start position:0%
here's what happens it's eight o'clock
 
01:51:09.290 --> 01:51:09.300 align:start position:0%
at night guy gets pulled over State
 
01:51:11.330 --> 01:51:11.340 align:start position:0%
Police pull him over
 
01:51:14.330 --> 01:51:14.340 align:start position:0%
he's driving uh he's got a cash to
 
01:51:18.229 --> 01:51:18.239 align:start position:0%
settle fine he didn't pay a 120 fine
 
01:51:20.990 --> 01:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
okay there's a warrant out for his
 
01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:22.189 align:start position:0%
okay there's a warrant out for his
arrest

01:51:22.189 --> 01:51:22.199 align:start position:0%
arrest
 
01:51:24.830 --> 01:51:24.840 align:start position:0%
it's a hard water uh ebw I can't do
 
01:51:26.689 --> 01:51:26.699 align:start position:0%
anything about it the judge
 
01:51:30.590 --> 01:51:30.600 align:start position:0%
if he has 120 bucks he's freed I write
 
01:51:32.990 --> 01:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
up the papers he goes his way
 
01:51:36.410 --> 01:51:36.420 align:start position:0%
you read line 12 and it tells you the
 
01:51:39.290 --> 01:51:39.300 align:start position:0%
chords will accept this where's the
 
01:51:40.790 --> 01:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
court at eight o'clock at night you want
 
01:51:43.070 --> 01:51:43.080 align:start position:0%
to slide it under the door for him
 
01:51:45.290 --> 01:51:45.300 align:start position:0%
just that that guy's going to be in jail
 
01:51:47.570 --> 01:51:47.580 align:start position:0%
because he got an ebw A piece of paper
 
01:51:49.970 --> 01:51:49.980 align:start position:0%
that says don't let him out if he says
 
01:51:52.910 --> 01:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
he doesn't have the money
 
01:51:54.830 --> 01:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
you have to let him go and write him up
 
01:51:58.850 --> 01:51:58.860 align:start position:0%
for let's mark him up for another
 
01:51:58.860 --> 01:52:00.350 align:start position:0%
for let's mark him up for another
arraignment

01:52:00.350 --> 01:52:00.360 align:start position:0%
arraignment
 
01:52:02.930 --> 01:52:02.940 align:start position:0%
but ironically the way the bill is
 
01:52:04.729 --> 01:52:04.739 align:start position:0%
written if he has the money he can't get
 
01:52:06.649 --> 01:52:06.659 align:start position:0%
out because he can't give it to the
 
01:52:06.659 --> 01:52:07.669 align:start position:0%
out because he can't give it to the
court

01:52:07.669 --> 01:52:07.679 align:start position:0%
court
 
01:52:09.470 --> 01:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of that page line we're
 
01:52:12.290 --> 01:52:12.300 align:start position:0%
starting at line 28 what about domestic
 
01:52:12.300 --> 01:52:13.430 align:start position:0%
starting at line 28 what about domestic
violence

01:52:13.430 --> 01:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
violence
 
01:52:16.010 --> 01:52:16.020 align:start position:0%
you'd be amazed at how many pajamas I've
 
01:52:18.950 --> 01:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
seen along the way guy gets pulled in at
 
01:52:20.870 --> 01:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
11 o'clock at night for domestic
 
01:52:20.880 --> 01:52:22.669 align:start position:0%
11 o'clock at night for domestic
violence

01:52:22.669 --> 01:52:22.679 align:start position:0%
violence
 
01:52:24.590 --> 01:52:24.600 align:start position:0%
Court can set him free you're going to
 
01:52:27.290 --> 01:52:27.300 align:start position:0%
have a judge come out
 
01:52:27.300 --> 01:52:29.209 align:start position:0%
have a judge come out
a

01:52:29.209 --> 01:52:29.219 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:52:31.250 --> 01:52:31.260 align:start position:0%
these are important people by the way
 
01:52:33.169 --> 01:52:33.179 align:start position:0%
they don't like to be disturbed that way
 
01:52:35.629 --> 01:52:35.639 align:start position:0%
I've never seen the police call a
 
01:52:37.550 --> 01:52:37.560 align:start position:0%
district court judge they're minor Gods
 
01:52:37.560 --> 01:52:39.050 align:start position:0%
district court judge they're minor Gods
anyway

01:52:39.050 --> 01:52:39.060 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
01:52:41.629 --> 01:52:41.639 align:start position:0%
there are technical problems with the
 
01:52:43.669 --> 01:52:43.679 align:start position:0%
implementation of the bill it would
 
01:52:45.229 --> 01:52:45.239 align:start position:0%
really take
 
01:52:48.430 --> 01:52:48.440 align:start position:0%
sitting down with real world experience
 
01:52:50.990 --> 01:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
analyzing seeing exactly what happens
 
01:52:56.510 --> 01:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:58.490 --> 01:52:58.500 align:start position:0%
and that is why I'm opposed to the bill
 
01:53:01.609 --> 01:53:01.619 align:start position:0%
both from a conceptual point of view and
 
01:53:03.530 --> 01:53:03.540 align:start position:0%
from a technical point of view thank you
 
01:53:05.149 --> 01:53:05.159 align:start position:0%

01:53:15.169 --> 01:53:15.179 align:start position:0%

as many of us have seen in recent years
 
01:55:17.750 --> 01:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
there have been many negative
 
01:55:19.669 --> 01:55:19.679 align:start position:0%
interactions between law enforcement and
 
01:55:21.530 --> 01:55:21.540 align:start position:0%

this country many times these
 
01:55:25.129 --> 01:55:25.139 align:start position:0%
interactions have been deadly and very
 
01:55:27.590 --> 01:55:27.600 align:start position:0%
controversial several States across the
 
01:55:30.050 --> 01:55:30.060 align:start position:0%
county including our neighboring state
 
01:55:32.689 --> 01:55:32.699 align:start position:0%
of Maine have passed a similar law which
 
01:55:34.970 --> 01:55:34.980 align:start position:0%

be removed from spots database
 
01:56:49.189 --> 01:56:49.199 align:start position:0%
the goal of this program is to give law
 
01:56:51.890 --> 01:56:51.900 align:start position:0%
enforcement offices a resource to avoid
 
01:56:53.689 --> 01:56:53.699 align:start position:0%
negative interactions with persons with
 
01:56:55.609 --> 01:56:55.619 align:start position:0%
a disability
 
01:56:57.350 --> 01:56:57.360 align:start position:0%
I am asking for the members of this
 
01:56:59.450 --> 01:56:59.460 align:start position:0%
committee to help give Law Enforcement
 
01:57:01.609 --> 01:57:01.619 align:start position:0%
Officers a resource to help protect a
 
01:57:03.410 --> 01:57:03.420 align:start position:0%
person with disabilities
 
01:57:06.410 --> 01:57:06.420 align:start position:0%
as a veteran law enforcement officer the
 
01:57:09.169 --> 01:57:09.179 align:start position:0%
writer of this document any payment of
 
01:57:11.570 --> 01:57:11.580 align:start position:0%
an autistic child I feel this program
 
01:57:13.430 --> 01:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
will be an asset to law enforcement and
 
01:57:15.169 --> 01:57:15.179 align:start position:0%
individuals with disabilities
 
01:57:17.270 --> 01:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
after doing some research and speaking
 
01:57:19.550 --> 01:57:19.560 align:start position:0%
with resources from other states where
 
01:57:20.990 --> 01:57:21.000 align:start position:0%
this program has been developed and
 
01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:22.010 align:start position:0%
this program has been developed and
implemented

01:57:22.010 --> 01:57:22.020 align:start position:0%
implemented
 
01:57:24.410 --> 01:57:24.420 align:start position:0%
we have learned the cost to start this
 
01:57:26.149 --> 01:57:26.159 align:start position:0%
program has been estimated between 25
 
01:57:29.570 --> 01:57:29.580 align:start position:0%
and 50 000 depending on the database and
 
01:57:31.189 --> 01:57:31.199 align:start position:0%
other states use
 
01:57:34.189 --> 01:57:34.199 align:start position:0%
asking for fifty thousand dollars allows
 
01:57:36.890 --> 01:57:36.900 align:start position:0%
us New Hampshire State Police to develop
 
01:57:39.470 --> 01:57:39.480 align:start position:0%
and implement this plan as stated in the
 
01:57:40.729 --> 01:57:40.739 align:start position:0%
physical note the New Hampshire State
 
01:57:42.169 --> 01:57:42.179 align:start position:0%
Police would not require additional
 
01:57:44.390 --> 01:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
Personnel to manage this program they
 
01:57:45.830 --> 01:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
state it would increase the workload
 
01:57:52.850 --> 01:57:52.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:55.070 --> 01:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for introducing and testifying
 
01:57:57.589 --> 01:57:57.599 align:start position:0%
in that bill representative the chair
 
01:57:57.599 --> 01:58:02.089 align:start position:0%
in that bill representative the chair
recognizes

01:58:02.089 --> 01:58:02.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:04.490 --> 01:58:04.500 align:start position:0%
Lieutenant Matthew La Perrier from the
 
01:58:20.030 --> 01:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:22.250 --> 01:58:22.260 align:start position:0%
so the state police
 
01:58:24.530 --> 01:58:24.540 align:start position:0%
supports this bill
 
01:58:26.450 --> 01:58:26.460 align:start position:0%
just had to testify on that behalf it's
 
01:58:30.290 --> 01:58:30.300 align:start position:0%
beneficial for everyone in the state
 
01:58:30.300 --> 01:58:31.729 align:start position:0%
beneficial for everyone in the state
um

01:58:31.729 --> 01:58:31.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:34.729 --> 01:58:34.739 align:start position:0%
we spend a lot of time if we do have a
 
01:58:36.470 --> 01:58:36.480 align:start position:0%
situation with someone that might have
 
01:58:38.290 --> 01:58:38.300 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's dementia
 
01:58:41.149 --> 01:58:41.159 align:start position:0%
autism any of those scenarios where
 
01:58:42.890 --> 01:58:42.900 align:start position:0%
we're wasting hours and hours and hours
 
01:58:44.810 --> 01:58:44.820 align:start position:0%
not wasting but it's usually hours and
 
01:58:44.820 --> 01:58:45.589 align:start position:0%
not wasting but it's usually hours and
hours

01:58:45.589 --> 01:58:45.599 align:start position:0%
hours
 
01:58:48.530 --> 01:58:48.540 align:start position:0%
just to locate a family member to help
 
01:58:49.790 --> 01:58:49.800 align:start position:0%
in the situation
 
01:58:51.950 --> 01:58:51.960 align:start position:0%
never mind if we don't know there's a
 
01:58:55.729 --> 01:58:55.739 align:start position:0%
disability situations that
 
01:58:58.430 --> 01:58:58.440 align:start position:0%
get ramped up and
 
01:59:01.490 --> 01:59:01.500 align:start position:0%
cause you know further could be injury
 
01:59:05.930 --> 01:59:05.940 align:start position:0%
or costs are associated with not knowing
 
01:59:08.089 --> 01:59:08.099 align:start position:0%
what this person has so if somebody
 
01:59:10.490 --> 01:59:10.500 align:start position:0%
wants to voluntarily provide information
 
01:59:13.250 --> 01:59:13.260 align:start position:0%
about something that we can have in a
 
01:59:15.589 --> 01:59:15.599 align:start position:0%
system that we run the person we know
 
01:59:16.910 --> 01:59:16.920 align:start position:0%
what we're walking into or what we're
 
01:59:19.490 --> 01:59:19.500 align:start position:0%
dealing with that would alleviate a lot
 
01:59:22.370 --> 01:59:22.380 align:start position:0%
for all our enforcement across the state
 
01:59:24.290 --> 01:59:24.300 align:start position:0%
I understand this this would be within
 
01:59:27.770 --> 01:59:27.780 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire as of now so that's how we
 
01:59:29.629 --> 01:59:29.639 align:start position:0%
connect everyone is through our spot
 
01:59:32.510 --> 01:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
system all of the law enforcement State
 
01:59:34.490 --> 01:59:34.500 align:start position:0%
County local we're all connected through
 
01:59:37.910 --> 01:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
our spot system so the the financial
 
01:59:41.350 --> 01:59:41.360 align:start position:0%
piece from my understanding is we would
 
01:59:43.729 --> 01:59:43.739 align:start position:0%
have our vendor
 
01:59:47.570 --> 01:59:47.580 align:start position:0%
that handles our spots so our software
 
01:59:49.970 --> 01:59:49.980 align:start position:0%
company would add another module so this
 
01:59:52.129 --> 01:59:52.139 align:start position:0%
module would be one more module versus
 
01:59:54.290 --> 01:59:54.300 align:start position:0%
the others that we have so if we have a
 
01:59:56.870 --> 01:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
missing person module in our system this
 
01:59:59.330 --> 01:59:59.340 align:start position:0%
one is just one more separate module so
 
02:00:01.070 --> 02:00:01.080 align:start position:0%
that's what the expense is once it's in
 
02:00:01.080 --> 02:00:03.290 align:start position:0%
that's what the expense is once it's in
there

02:00:03.290 --> 02:00:03.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:05.689 --> 02:00:05.699 align:start position:0%
it'll be pushed out to all agencies all
 
02:00:08.209 --> 02:00:08.219 align:start position:0%
the dispatch centers and everybody
 
02:00:10.189 --> 02:00:10.199 align:start position:0%
so it's a it's a quick spin up on a
 
02:00:11.510 --> 02:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
system that's already been in existence
 
02:00:14.089 --> 02:00:14.099 align:start position:0%
for decades that everybody understands
 
02:00:15.470 --> 02:00:15.480 align:start position:0%
and knows how to use
 
02:00:17.270 --> 02:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
so I think
 
02:00:19.790 --> 02:00:19.800 align:start position:0%
it's all positive I can't see anything
 
02:00:19.800 --> 02:00:20.930 align:start position:0%
it's all positive I can't see anything
negative

02:00:20.930 --> 02:00:20.940 align:start position:0%
negative
 
02:00:25.609 --> 02:00:25.619 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:25.619 --> 02:00:26.330 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:00:26.330 --> 02:00:26.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:28.370 --> 02:00:28.380 align:start position:0%
just so for the the committee
 
02:00:31.189 --> 02:00:31.199 align:start position:0%
understands so what this would do is if
 
02:00:33.229 --> 02:00:33.239 align:start position:0%
you get a call to a residence for a
 
02:00:35.830 --> 02:00:35.840 align:start position:0%
disturbance and there's a person there
 
02:00:38.570 --> 02:00:38.580 align:start position:0%
dispatch would call that person up in
 
02:00:40.370 --> 02:00:40.380 align:start position:0%
the system something would flash and say
 
02:00:42.770 --> 02:00:42.780 align:start position:0%
this person has this contact for this
 
02:00:44.930 --> 02:00:44.940 align:start position:0%
issue and you would know before you got
 
02:00:46.310 --> 02:00:46.320 align:start position:0%
there what you were dealing with in
 
02:00:48.169 --> 02:00:48.179 align:start position:0%
discounts could potentially call the
 
02:00:50.870 --> 02:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
person to help assist is that pretty
 
02:00:52.550 --> 02:00:52.560 align:start position:0%
much how that would work because because
 
02:00:54.530 --> 02:00:54.540 align:start position:0%
a lot of times if it's someone say
 
02:00:56.290 --> 02:00:56.300 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's dementia even
 
02:00:59.810 --> 02:00:59.820 align:start position:0%
we have wrong way drivers and I've been
 
02:01:01.129 --> 02:01:01.139 align:start position:0%
out there you know you get them boxed in
 
02:01:03.890 --> 02:01:03.900 align:start position:0%
on the high speed limit on 93 and you're
 
02:01:05.089 --> 02:01:05.099 align:start position:0%
going through that wallet you're trying
 
02:01:06.830 --> 02:01:06.840 align:start position:0%
to look for it because they don't even
 
02:01:08.990 --> 02:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
know where they are what's going on so
 
02:01:10.609 --> 02:01:10.619 align:start position:0%
you're trying to find something to help
 
02:01:11.930 --> 02:01:11.940 align:start position:0%
out this person
 
02:01:15.050 --> 02:01:15.060 align:start position:0%
because you need to figure it out so if
 
02:01:18.830 --> 02:01:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:20.870 --> 02:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
it helps all the way around so either
 
02:01:23.030 --> 02:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
we're responding to something or we come
 
02:01:24.350 --> 02:01:24.360 align:start position:0%
upon it
 
02:01:26.330 --> 02:01:26.340 align:start position:0%
it's it's a huge help
 
02:01:28.609 --> 02:01:28.619 align:start position:0%
How would how would someone get into the
 
02:01:29.930 --> 02:01:29.940 align:start position:0%
system is this something where a
 
02:01:31.430 --> 02:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
relative would have to call the State
 
02:01:32.810 --> 02:01:32.820 align:start position:0%
Police or could they go through their
 
02:01:35.330 --> 02:01:35.340 align:start position:0%
local police it would be every law
 
02:01:37.310 --> 02:01:37.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency in the state just
 
02:01:39.589 --> 02:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
currently just how we have it say if it
 
02:01:41.410 --> 02:01:41.420 align:start position:0%
is a missing person or endangered person
 
02:01:43.790 --> 02:01:43.800 align:start position:0%
that same procedure
 
02:01:45.410 --> 02:01:45.420 align:start position:0%
so they go to the local police
 
02:01:47.570 --> 02:01:47.580 align:start position:0%
department it'll be a form they fill it
 
02:01:50.930 --> 02:01:50.940 align:start position:0%
out it's all voluntary gets entered and
 
02:01:52.430 --> 02:01:52.440 align:start position:0%
then we have it
 
02:01:54.229 --> 02:01:54.239 align:start position:0%
hopefully some of that money might be
 
02:01:56.990 --> 02:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
used for advertising I wonder to get
 
02:01:58.370 --> 02:01:58.380 align:start position:0%
that information out that this is
 
02:02:00.589 --> 02:02:00.599 align:start position:0%
available correct
 
02:02:02.089 --> 02:02:02.099 align:start position:0%
um thank you for answering my questions
 
02:02:02.099 --> 02:02:04.850 align:start position:0%
um thank you for answering my questions
Representatives

02:02:04.850 --> 02:02:04.860 align:start position:0%
Representatives
 
02:02:04.860 --> 02:02:07.669 align:start position:0%
Representatives
um

02:02:07.669 --> 02:02:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:10.129 --> 02:02:10.139 align:start position:0%
I represent Rhodes
 
02:02:12.109 --> 02:02:12.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:02:14.209 --> 02:02:14.219 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:02:16.970 --> 02:02:16.980 align:start position:0%
pretty simply is in the event that you
 
02:02:18.229 --> 02:02:18.239 align:start position:0%
know that this you know you're you're
 
02:02:19.850 --> 02:02:19.860 align:start position:0%
going someplace and you know that
 
02:02:21.530 --> 02:02:21.540 align:start position:0%
there's this contact person
 
02:02:24.290 --> 02:02:24.300 align:start position:0%
that person's unavailable what would be
 
02:02:27.050 --> 02:02:27.060 align:start position:0%
your next step would you you know is
 
02:02:29.209 --> 02:02:29.219 align:start position:0%
there going to be a backup person or
 
02:02:30.709 --> 02:02:30.719 align:start position:0%
would it just be simply you would just
 
02:02:31.910 --> 02:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
kind of wait until you're able to get a
 
02:02:33.709 --> 02:02:33.719 align:start position:0%
hold of the contact person
 
02:02:36.350 --> 02:02:36.360 align:start position:0%
so I'm just seeing this now if it's the
 
02:02:38.169 --> 02:02:38.179 align:start position:0%
one person that's the one person however
 
02:02:41.390 --> 02:02:41.400 align:start position:0%
we'll still know what we're dealing with
 
02:02:43.790 --> 02:02:43.800 align:start position:0%
as far as
 
02:02:47.030 --> 02:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
the the disability because that's a huge
 
02:02:47.040 --> 02:02:47.990 align:start position:0%
the the disability because that's a huge
help

02:02:47.990 --> 02:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
help
 
02:02:49.550 --> 02:02:49.560 align:start position:0%
because like I said it could take hours
 
02:02:51.950 --> 02:02:51.960 align:start position:0%
just to get to that point
 
02:02:55.250 --> 02:02:55.260 align:start position:0%
um that would save a lot of time
 
02:02:57.530 --> 02:02:57.540 align:start position:0%
especially when you know across the
 
02:02:59.570 --> 02:02:59.580 align:start position:0%
board our our law enforcement agencies
 
02:03:01.850 --> 02:03:01.860 align:start position:0%
are now Staffing so I think it's just
 
02:03:04.310 --> 02:03:04.320 align:start position:0%
another tool into the tool chest that
 
02:03:06.470 --> 02:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
would help us
 
02:03:06.480 --> 02:03:07.729 align:start position:0%
would help us
yep

02:03:07.729 --> 02:03:07.739 align:start position:0%
yep
 
02:03:10.250 --> 02:03:10.260 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy
 
02:03:11.930 --> 02:03:11.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:03:14.629 --> 02:03:14.639 align:start position:0%
taking my question as a parent of an
 
02:03:16.129 --> 02:03:16.139 align:start position:0%
adult child with the traumatic traumatic
 
02:03:18.350 --> 02:03:18.360 align:start position:0%
brain injury and autism and over whom I
 
02:03:21.229 --> 02:03:21.239 align:start position:0%
have guardianship I see Great Value in a
 
02:03:23.270 --> 02:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
bill like this recognizing the
 
02:03:26.149 --> 02:03:26.159 align:start position:0%
communication disorders and challenges
 
02:03:29.209 --> 02:03:29.219 align:start position:0%
um that these individuals have as well
 
02:03:31.550 --> 02:03:31.560 align:start position:0%
as the challenges that law enforcement
 
02:03:34.490 --> 02:03:34.500 align:start position:0%
has when entering into a situation
 
02:03:37.070 --> 02:03:37.080 align:start position:0%
involving them and not being aware of a
 
02:03:41.169 --> 02:03:41.179 align:start position:0%
disability that may not be visual
 
02:03:44.270 --> 02:03:44.280 align:start position:0%
are you uh
 
02:03:47.990 --> 02:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
I hear that you're supporting this this
 
02:03:52.970 --> 02:03:52.980 align:start position:0%
um this bill and uh would would you
 
02:03:55.010 --> 02:03:55.020 align:start position:0%
would you think that having more than
 
02:03:57.470 --> 02:03:57.480 align:start position:0%
one contact in in a system would be
 
02:03:59.629 --> 02:03:59.639 align:start position:0%
helpful should you know like in my case
 
02:04:01.970 --> 02:04:01.980 align:start position:0%
if the parent wasn't available
 
02:04:03.770 --> 02:04:03.780 align:start position:0%
um the the attempt would be made to
 
02:04:06.770 --> 02:04:06.780 align:start position:0%
reach that person yes definitely
 
02:04:09.589 --> 02:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
beneficial the more the better so even
 
02:04:11.149 --> 02:04:11.159 align:start position:0%
more than two more than three whatever
 
02:04:14.149 --> 02:04:14.159 align:start position:0%
that may be that's more beneficial great
 
02:04:16.370 --> 02:04:16.380 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:04:18.709 --> 02:04:18.719 align:start position:0%
under the current systems there's the
 
02:04:20.629 --> 02:04:20.639 align:start position:0%
ability to enter in more information so
 
02:04:22.430 --> 02:04:22.440 align:start position:0%
there wouldn't be a problem adding more
 
02:04:24.290 --> 02:04:24.300 align:start position:0%
than one name or number right right so
 
02:04:26.270 --> 02:04:26.280 align:start position:0%
in the spot system even if you had the
 
02:04:28.010 --> 02:04:28.020 align:start position:0%
Box level one contact you have a
 
02:04:29.270 --> 02:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
comments field
 
02:04:31.430 --> 02:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
so you could have you know two three
 
02:04:34.010 --> 02:04:34.020 align:start position:0%
four so the system set up that way they
 
02:04:36.530 --> 02:04:36.540 align:start position:0%
can add
 
02:04:40.490 --> 02:04:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:41.990 --> 02:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:43.370 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
question

02:04:43.370 --> 02:04:43.380 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:04:46.070 --> 02:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
um is there any equivalent uh currently
 
02:04:49.609 --> 02:04:49.619 align:start position:0%
in place at city or town levels and
 
02:04:54.290 --> 02:04:54.300 align:start position:0%
how does your jurisdiction relate to
 
02:04:58.010 --> 02:04:58.020 align:start position:0%
properties that are not on the highway
 
02:05:00.530 --> 02:05:00.540 align:start position:0%
for this legislation so in this
 
02:05:02.629 --> 02:05:02.639 align:start position:0%
legislation it's being proposed that
 
02:05:04.490 --> 02:05:04.500 align:start position:0%
it's the
 
02:05:06.709 --> 02:05:06.719 align:start position:0%
gonna use the spots right so that's the
 
02:05:08.510 --> 02:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
state police online terminal that's what
 
02:05:11.330 --> 02:05:11.340 align:start position:0%
all law enforcement of the state uses so
 
02:05:13.189 --> 02:05:13.199 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety Division of State
 
02:05:15.050 --> 02:05:15.060 align:start position:0%
Police that's what's under
 
02:05:17.270 --> 02:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
us one housing of that that's that one
 
02:05:19.370 --> 02:05:19.380 align:start position:0%
Central Point that manages it and then
 
02:05:20.870 --> 02:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
from there all the other law enforcement
 
02:05:20.880 --> 02:05:22.070 align:start position:0%
from there all the other law enforcement
agencies

02:05:22.070 --> 02:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
02:05:25.010 --> 02:05:25.020 align:start position:0%
tie into it so this is being proposed
 
02:05:26.930 --> 02:05:26.940 align:start position:0%
this way because
 
02:05:29.030 --> 02:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
the division of State Police oversees
 
02:05:31.370 --> 02:05:31.380 align:start position:0%
that so jurisdiction-wise yeah we have
 
02:05:33.350 --> 02:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
you know certain towns true Beth we
 
02:05:35.629 --> 02:05:35.639 align:start position:0%
might have 65 towns with a primary
 
02:05:39.169 --> 02:05:39.179 align:start position:0%
police Agency for those towns other
 
02:05:42.530 --> 02:05:42.540 align:start position:0%
areas we are not so the interstates it
 
02:05:46.430 --> 02:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
just depends on who where it is and it's
 
02:05:47.810 --> 02:05:47.820 align:start position:0%
broken up in the state where you would
 
02:05:50.689 --> 02:05:50.699 align:start position:0%
know to go to have that entered so up
 
02:05:53.270 --> 02:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
North true math they know to go to Twin
 
02:05:53.280 --> 02:05:54.229 align:start position:0%
North true math they know to go to Twin
Mountain

02:05:54.229 --> 02:05:54.239 align:start position:0%
Mountain
 
02:05:57.470 --> 02:05:57.480 align:start position:0%
that's the point of contact for that
 
02:05:57.480 --> 02:05:59.330 align:start position:0%
that's the point of contact for that
area

02:05:59.330 --> 02:05:59.340 align:start position:0%
area
 
02:06:01.850 --> 02:06:01.860 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
02:06:04.310 --> 02:06:04.320 align:start position:0%
thank you um so just to clarify because
 
02:06:04.320 --> 02:06:06.050 align:start position:0%
thank you um so just to clarify because
the

02:06:06.050 --> 02:06:06.060 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:06:08.570 --> 02:06:08.580 align:start position:0%
um you're saying all in law enforcement
 
02:06:10.430 --> 02:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
entities in the state use the same
 
02:06:12.830 --> 02:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
system it doesn't
 
02:06:16.010 --> 02:06:16.020 align:start position:0%
um matter where someone is found when
 
02:06:17.689 --> 02:06:17.699 align:start position:0%
they're in need of help
 
02:06:19.550 --> 02:06:19.560 align:start position:0%
they'll um
 
02:06:24.229 --> 02:06:24.239 align:start position:0%
their their contact person can always be
 
02:06:26.570 --> 02:06:26.580 align:start position:0%
um determined yeah through this system
 
02:06:28.850 --> 02:06:28.860 align:start position:0%
it's that one
 
02:06:31.550 --> 02:06:31.560 align:start position:0%
system so if I'm a
 
02:06:33.589 --> 02:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
if I'm a Manchester police officer on my
 
02:06:35.149 --> 02:06:35.159 align:start position:0%
cruise and I run somebody in my mobile
 
02:06:38.209 --> 02:06:38.219 align:start position:0%
data terminal that's the same thing I
 
02:06:40.310 --> 02:06:40.320 align:start position:0%
would have if I was a true F Trooper on
 
02:06:42.770 --> 02:06:42.780 align:start position:0%
93 in Lincoln it's that's it I get the
 
02:06:44.810 --> 02:06:44.820 align:start position:0%
same exact response it's that one system
 
02:06:47.390 --> 02:06:47.400 align:start position:0%
same as a wanted person that would come
 
02:06:50.030 --> 02:06:50.040 align:start position:0%
up uh vehicle check all of it it's all
 
02:06:52.490 --> 02:06:52.500 align:start position:0%
housed in that one system
 
02:06:56.570 --> 02:06:56.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:58.970 --> 02:06:58.980 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for taking my question
 
02:07:00.649 --> 02:07:00.659 align:start position:0%
um so this bill talks about people with
 
02:07:02.750 --> 02:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
mental and physical disabilities does it
 
02:07:05.270 --> 02:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
it's not clear to me if this would also
 
02:07:06.830 --> 02:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
include and I don't know if you know the
 
02:07:08.390 --> 02:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
answer to this people who are having
 
02:07:10.070 --> 02:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
mental health
 
02:07:12.770 --> 02:07:12.780 align:start position:0%
um impairments so you know someone who
 
02:07:15.410 --> 02:07:15.420 align:start position:0%
might have like a form of schizophrenia
 
02:07:19.430 --> 02:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
or dissociative disorders or is is that
 
02:07:21.709 --> 02:07:21.719 align:start position:0%
so so my understanding just because I
 
02:07:23.209 --> 02:07:23.219 align:start position:0%
only read the legislation if it's a
 
02:07:24.709 --> 02:07:24.719 align:start position:0%
disability I would consider that a
 
02:07:26.209 --> 02:07:26.219 align:start position:0%
disability I have had contact with
 
02:07:28.910 --> 02:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
people with bipolar and other scenarios
 
02:07:31.790 --> 02:07:31.800 align:start position:0%
right and that's a that would be huge to
 
02:07:34.370 --> 02:07:34.380 align:start position:0%
know that that's what they are right to
 
02:07:36.109 --> 02:07:36.119 align:start position:0%
diagnose someone
 
02:07:38.030 --> 02:07:38.040 align:start position:0%
you know instantaneously is very
 
02:07:39.770 --> 02:07:39.780 align:start position:0%
difficult if you have years of
 
02:07:41.209 --> 02:07:41.219 align:start position:0%
experience you could pick up on things
 
02:07:42.530 --> 02:07:42.540 align:start position:0%
because someone might be wearing
 
02:07:44.810 --> 02:07:44.820 align:start position:0%
sunglasses and it's at nighttime right
 
02:07:47.570 --> 02:07:47.580 align:start position:0%
and you're asking them questions and it
 
02:07:48.950 --> 02:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense so
 
02:07:52.189 --> 02:07:52.199 align:start position:0%
if you have this I have a hard fact so I
 
02:07:54.589 --> 02:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
would say that all those things
 
02:07:57.950 --> 02:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:00.589 --> 02:08:00.599 align:start position:0%
representative Gendron
 
02:08:02.030 --> 02:08:02.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:08:04.070 --> 02:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:08:06.290 --> 02:08:06.300 align:start position:0%
I have a lot of folks in my family that
 
02:08:07.729 --> 02:08:07.739 align:start position:0%
are diabetic
 
02:08:10.430 --> 02:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
um and one of the things that I I think
 
02:08:13.129 --> 02:08:13.139 align:start position:0%
that police have had issues with in the
 
02:08:15.950 --> 02:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
past if somebody is hypoglycemic
 
02:08:17.450 --> 02:08:17.460 align:start position:0%
which means their blood sugar is low
 
02:08:20.510 --> 02:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
they can actually act as if they are
 
02:08:20.520 --> 02:08:22.070 align:start position:0%
they can actually act as if they are
intoxicated

02:08:22.070 --> 02:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
intoxicated
 
02:08:24.410 --> 02:08:24.420 align:start position:0%
with this system allow that information
 
02:08:26.810 --> 02:08:26.820 align:start position:0%
to be placed in there that they are a
 
02:08:29.270 --> 02:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
diabetic and instead of giving them a
 
02:08:30.830 --> 02:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
sobriety test you'd be able to call an
 
02:08:33.229 --> 02:08:33.239 align:start position:0%
ambulance for them yeah and I and I know
 
02:08:34.129 --> 02:08:34.139 align:start position:0%
exactly what you're talking about
 
02:08:35.270 --> 02:08:35.280 align:start position:0%
because I've dealt with it multiple
 
02:08:37.010 --> 02:08:37.020 align:start position:0%
times firsthand so you don't smell
 
02:08:39.890 --> 02:08:39.900 align:start position:0%
alcohol right but the person's
 
02:08:42.350 --> 02:08:42.360 align:start position:0%
being very aggressive even when you're
 
02:08:45.229 --> 02:08:45.239 align:start position:0%
interacting with them and
 
02:08:45.239 --> 02:08:46.010 align:start position:0%
interacting with them and
um

02:08:46.010 --> 02:08:46.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:48.169 --> 02:08:48.179 align:start position:0%
so like I said
 
02:08:50.629 --> 02:08:50.639 align:start position:0%
however they wrote this bill if it's a
 
02:08:52.850 --> 02:08:52.860 align:start position:0%
disability I would say it would qualify
 
02:08:55.669 --> 02:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
for it so if if that's what the the
 
02:08:57.350 --> 02:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
nature is I think that's beneficial
 
02:09:00.350 --> 02:09:00.360 align:start position:0%
because why do we want to have to have
 
02:09:02.990 --> 02:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
I've had it where it has been diabetic
 
02:09:05.270 --> 02:09:05.280 align:start position:0%
and we recognize it soon enough where we
 
02:09:06.410 --> 02:09:06.420 align:start position:0%
don't because you don't have to go
 
02:09:08.629 --> 02:09:08.639 align:start position:0%
Hands-On at all right
 
02:09:09.890 --> 02:09:09.900 align:start position:0%
we're not going to arrest the person
 
02:09:11.750 --> 02:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
with the DUI if they're diabetic so we
 
02:09:15.410 --> 02:09:15.420 align:start position:0%
get EMTs there and the person is more
 
02:09:18.589 --> 02:09:18.599 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that so it alleviates a
 
02:09:22.250 --> 02:09:22.260 align:start position:0%
situation and it brings it down so
 
02:09:26.330 --> 02:09:26.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:28.010 --> 02:09:28.020 align:start position:0%
there being no further questions thank
 
02:09:29.149 --> 02:09:29.159 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony this morning
 
02:09:32.089 --> 02:09:32.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:33.770 --> 02:09:33.780 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else wishing to testify
 
02:09:35.689 --> 02:09:35.699 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
02:09:37.310 --> 02:09:37.320 align:start position:0%
there being none I'm going to close
 
02:09:40.850 --> 02:09:40.860 align:start position:0%
public here in HP 560.
 
02:09:56.510 --> 02:09:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:58.850 --> 02:09:58.860 align:start position:0%
I recognize the representative of Damon
 
02:10:02.990 --> 02:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:05.750 --> 02:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you chairman Roy and
 
02:10:07.070 --> 02:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
thank you to the full committee for your
 
02:10:09.830 --> 02:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
efforts to be here today and overall I
 
02:10:11.689 --> 02:10:11.699 align:start position:0%
hope your Drive-In was a titch easier
 
02:10:14.270 --> 02:10:14.280 align:start position:0%
than mine New Hampshire weather
 
02:10:16.310 --> 02:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
keeps it interesting
 
02:10:18.350 --> 02:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
as a freshman representative serving on
 
02:10:20.030 --> 02:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
education committee I have considerable
 
02:10:23.089 --> 02:10:23.099 align:start position:0%
respect for your commitment and work
 
02:10:25.129 --> 02:10:25.139 align:start position:0%
I am representative hope Damon serving
 
02:10:26.750 --> 02:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
the citizens of Sullivan District 8
 
02:10:28.790 --> 02:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
which includes the beautiful towns of
 
02:10:30.770 --> 02:10:30.780 align:start position:0%
Acworth Langdon Leominster Goshen
 
02:10:32.870 --> 02:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
Washington Springfield Sunapee my
 
02:10:35.209 --> 02:10:35.219 align:start position:0%
hometown of Croydon and the rising City
 
02:10:37.070 --> 02:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
of Claremont and yes I share
 
02:10:38.930 --> 02:10:38.940 align:start position:0%
representation of District 8 with your
 
02:10:40.010 --> 02:10:40.020 align:start position:0%
criminal justice colleague
 
02:10:42.050 --> 02:10:42.060 align:start position:0%
representative Stone
 
02:10:44.870 --> 02:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
I am sponsoring House Bill 643 to
 
02:10:47.209 --> 02:10:47.219 align:start position:0%
legalize marijuana for persons 21 and
 
02:10:50.330 --> 02:10:50.340 align:start position:0%
over on behalf of many constituents I
 
02:10:52.070 --> 02:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that there are several other
 
02:10:53.689 --> 02:10:53.699 align:start position:0%
pending marijuana bills with different
 
02:10:56.089 --> 02:10:56.099 align:start position:0%
approaches to be considered
 
02:10:58.550 --> 02:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
prior to being elected representative I
 
02:11:01.070 --> 02:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
enjoyed a rewarding 40-year career as a
 
02:11:03.350 --> 02:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
private practice dietitian diabetes
 
02:11:06.169 --> 02:11:06.179 align:start position:0%
educator and eating disorder specialist
 
02:11:08.510 --> 02:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
that work means my decision making is
 
02:11:11.030 --> 02:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
grounded in evidence-based science
 
02:11:13.490 --> 02:11:13.500 align:start position:0%
I note that because I have come to
 
02:11:15.350 --> 02:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
support and now promote marijuana
 
02:11:18.229 --> 02:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
legislation very thoughtfully
 
02:11:20.510 --> 02:11:20.520 align:start position:0%
I care deeply about how people take care
 
02:11:22.850 --> 02:11:22.860 align:start position:0%
of themselves I have great respect for
 
02:11:24.589 --> 02:11:24.599 align:start position:0%
individual freedoms
 
02:11:26.750 --> 02:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
that background and those values lead me
 
02:11:29.089 --> 02:11:29.099 align:start position:0%
to say New Hampshire is very overdue to
 
02:11:31.070 --> 02:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
legalized marijuana
 
02:11:33.229 --> 02:11:33.239 align:start position:0%
prohibition doesn't work
 
02:11:35.390 --> 02:11:35.400 align:start position:0%
people are utilizing recreational
 
02:11:37.189 --> 02:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
marijuana anyway
 
02:11:39.830 --> 02:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
and we are way behind all the other New
 
02:11:41.209 --> 02:11:41.219 align:start position:0%
England states
 
02:11:43.729 --> 02:11:43.739 align:start position:0%
in making it safer by regulating the
 
02:11:45.470 --> 02:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
products that are available
 
02:11:48.169 --> 02:11:48.179 align:start position:0%
and in generating revenue for other
 
02:11:51.050 --> 02:11:51.060 align:start position:0%
purposes from sales of marijuana
 
02:11:54.050 --> 02:11:54.060 align:start position:0%
so this bill sets up retail sales solely
 
02:11:56.149 --> 02:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
through the state of New Hampshire with
 
02:11:58.370 --> 02:11:58.380 align:start position:0%
operations and regulations similar to
 
02:12:00.470 --> 02:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
alcohol and handled by the liquor
 
02:12:00.480 --> 02:12:02.149 align:start position:0%
alcohol and handled by the liquor
condition

02:12:02.149 --> 02:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
condition
 
02:12:04.129 --> 02:12:04.139 align:start position:0%
a state would be reimbursed for all
 
02:12:05.990 --> 02:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
costs involved in setting up the retail
 
02:12:08.870 --> 02:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
sales by 2027.
 
02:12:10.430 --> 02:12:10.440 align:start position:0%
after that
 
02:12:12.589 --> 02:12:12.599 align:start position:0%
50 percent of the revenues would be
 
02:12:15.290 --> 02:12:15.300 align:start position:0%
provided to the education trust fund
 
02:12:16.729 --> 02:12:16.739 align:start position:0%
funds would be dispersed to
 
02:12:18.709 --> 02:12:18.719 align:start position:0%
municipalities with the lowest total
 
02:12:20.689 --> 02:12:20.699 align:start position:0%
valuation per pupil
 
02:12:22.970 --> 02:12:22.980 align:start position:0%
and the calculation is defined in the
 
02:12:22.980 --> 02:12:24.169 align:start position:0%
and the calculation is defined in the
bill

02:12:24.169 --> 02:12:24.179 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:12:27.290 --> 02:12:27.300 align:start position:0%
funds shall be dispersed in ascending
 
02:12:30.109 --> 02:12:30.119 align:start position:0%
order until exhausted it is well known
 
02:12:31.850 --> 02:12:31.860 align:start position:0%
that the state of New Hampshire does not
 
02:12:35.209 --> 02:12:35.219 align:start position:0%
equitably and adequately fund education
 
02:12:38.089 --> 02:12:38.099 align:start position:0%
as I'm serving on education committee I
 
02:12:40.669 --> 02:12:40.679 align:start position:0%
am really closely seeing the challenges
 
02:12:43.010 --> 02:12:43.020 align:start position:0%
in adverse effects on our schools our
 
02:12:45.830 --> 02:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
students and our taxpayers
 
02:12:47.870 --> 02:12:47.880 align:start position:0%
the other 50 percent of marijuana
 
02:12:50.330 --> 02:12:50.340 align:start position:0%
revenues should this bill pass would go
 
02:12:51.890 --> 02:12:51.900 align:start position:0%
to a new fund at the Department of
 
02:12:54.530 --> 02:12:54.540 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services for increased
 
02:12:56.629 --> 02:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
access to mental health care
 
02:12:59.390 --> 02:12:59.400 align:start position:0%
it has been widely publicized including
 
02:13:01.970 --> 02:13:01.980 align:start position:0%
several very recent tragedies that New
 
02:13:03.350 --> 02:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does not have an adequate
 
02:13:05.030 --> 02:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
system of providing mental health care
 
02:13:05.040 --> 02:13:06.470 align:start position:0%
system of providing mental health care
services

02:13:06.470 --> 02:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:13:08.450 --> 02:13:08.460 align:start position:0%
and I will say in my career as a
 
02:13:10.129 --> 02:13:10.139 align:start position:0%
dietitian particularly in my work with
 
02:13:12.109 --> 02:13:12.119 align:start position:0%
eating disorders but also there's a
 
02:13:14.629 --> 02:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
higher incidence of depression and
 
02:13:16.250 --> 02:13:16.260 align:start position:0%
anxiety disorders in people who have
 
02:13:16.260 --> 02:13:17.510 align:start position:0%
anxiety disorders in people who have
diabetes

02:13:17.510 --> 02:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
diabetes
 
02:13:19.550 --> 02:13:19.560 align:start position:0%
it was just a constant constant
 
02:13:21.950 --> 02:13:21.960 align:start position:0%
challenge to find providers for mental
 
02:13:24.410 --> 02:13:24.420 align:start position:0%
health care services we just simply
 
02:13:26.209 --> 02:13:26.219 align:start position:0%
don't have enough people
 
02:13:27.950 --> 02:13:27.960 align:start position:0%
providing those services and part of
 
02:13:29.330 --> 02:13:29.340 align:start position:0%
that is a funding issue for that
 
02:13:29.340 --> 02:13:31.189 align:start position:0%
that is a funding issue for that
profession

02:13:31.189 --> 02:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
profession
 
02:13:34.790 --> 02:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
going back to this bill there is also
 
02:13:37.609 --> 02:13:37.619 align:start position:0%
a fund that would be set up at Health
 
02:13:39.649 --> 02:13:39.659 align:start position:0%
and Human Services to present a public
 
02:13:42.890 --> 02:13:42.900 align:start position:0%
media campaign including social media on
 
02:13:45.890 --> 02:13:45.900 align:start position:0%
safe storage of marijuana risks to avoid
 
02:13:49.250 --> 02:13:49.260 align:start position:0%
not driving pregnancy
 
02:13:51.050 --> 02:13:51.060 align:start position:0%
people under 21
 
02:13:54.109 --> 02:13:54.119 align:start position:0%
Etc and that campaign would begin before
 
02:13:57.410 --> 02:13:57.420 align:start position:0%
retail sales started
 
02:13:59.629 --> 02:13:59.639 align:start position:0%
I will acknowledge that the bill is not
 
02:14:01.910 --> 02:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
perfect as written I'm a freshman
 
02:14:03.709 --> 02:14:03.719 align:start position:0%
legislator and I'm learning on the job
 
02:14:08.089 --> 02:14:08.099 align:start position:0%
and open to feedback and questions I do
 
02:14:09.709 --> 02:14:09.719 align:start position:0%
believe the effective date needs to be
 
02:14:11.990 --> 02:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
pushed out it's not realistic
 
02:14:14.810 --> 02:14:14.820 align:start position:0%
but overall this is a thorough and
 
02:14:16.669 --> 02:14:16.679 align:start position:0%
responsible approach to legalizing
 
02:14:18.830 --> 02:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
marijuana and benefiting from the
 
02:14:21.530 --> 02:14:21.540 align:start position:0%
revenues we owe it to the citizens of
 
02:14:23.390 --> 02:14:23.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to stop treating
 
02:14:26.089 --> 02:14:26.099 align:start position:0%
recreational marijuana as a crime
 
02:14:28.669 --> 02:14:28.679 align:start position:0%
and we owe it to our citizens to benefit
 
02:14:31.129 --> 02:14:31.139 align:start position:0%
from this Revenue opportunity
 
02:14:33.890 --> 02:14:33.900 align:start position:0%
to responsibly fund essentially needed
 
02:14:35.629 --> 02:14:35.639 align:start position:0%
public education and Mental Health
 
02:14:35.639 --> 02:14:36.770 align:start position:0%
public education and Mental Health
Services

02:14:36.770 --> 02:14:36.780 align:start position:0%
Services
 
02:14:40.910 --> 02:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:43.250 --> 02:14:43.260 align:start position:0%
representative Rhodes thank you Mr
 
02:14:44.629 --> 02:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
02:14:47.510 --> 02:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
question I'm looking at the very first
 
02:14:47.520 --> 02:14:48.729 align:start position:0%
question I'm looking at the very first
page

02:14:48.729 --> 02:14:48.739 align:start position:0%
page
 
02:14:53.149 --> 02:14:53.159 align:start position:0%
under one in its D or it says I'm sorry
 
02:14:55.430 --> 02:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
it's e
 
02:14:57.649 --> 02:14:57.659 align:start position:0%
cannabis should cannabis sold in the
 
02:14:59.149 --> 02:14:59.159 align:start position:0%
state shall be tested labeled and
 
02:15:01.490 --> 02:15:01.500 align:start position:0%
subject to additional regulations can
 
02:15:03.470 --> 02:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
you give me an example of
 
02:15:05.990 --> 02:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
you know is the tested part in in this
 
02:15:08.149 --> 02:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
for the funding and what is what is an
 
02:15:19.189 --> 02:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:20.629 --> 02:15:20.639 align:start position:0%
and that's part of what I was
 
02:15:22.850 --> 02:15:22.860 align:start position:0%
referencing when I spoke about safety
 
02:15:25.129 --> 02:15:25.139 align:start position:0%
presently when people
 
02:15:27.490 --> 02:15:27.500 align:start position:0%
purchase marijuana on the black market
 
02:15:31.609 --> 02:15:31.619 align:start position:0%
which is happening all over the state
 
02:15:34.910 --> 02:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
they don't know what it is really
 
02:15:37.550 --> 02:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
so this is to make it safer in that
 
02:15:37.560 --> 02:15:40.430 align:start position:0%
so this is to make it safer in that
regard

02:15:40.430 --> 02:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:43.069 --> 02:15:43.079 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman if I just may clarify
 
02:15:45.709 --> 02:15:45.719 align:start position:0%
um use an additional regulations
 
02:15:47.330 --> 02:15:47.340 align:start position:0%
I'm just not sure exactly what you mean
 
02:15:48.950 --> 02:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
by that it very well could be in here
 
02:15:50.149 --> 02:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
honestly I haven't got to the whole
 
02:15:53.270 --> 02:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
thing but the bill is long honestly I
 
02:15:55.430 --> 02:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer to that either
 
02:16:04.010 --> 02:16:04.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:07.069 --> 02:16:07.079 align:start position:0%
representative Newell
 
02:16:08.750 --> 02:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:16:10.430 --> 02:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:16:12.410 --> 02:16:12.420 align:start position:0%
um my question is
 
02:16:17.569 --> 02:16:17.579 align:start position:0%
um is the uh safe you know so let me put
 
02:16:18.830 --> 02:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
it this way
 
02:16:20.810 --> 02:16:20.820 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of money that goes into
 
02:16:24.589 --> 02:16:24.599 align:start position:0%
policing uh cannabis use possession sale
 
02:16:26.270 --> 02:16:26.280 align:start position:0%
that kind of stuff
 
02:16:28.970 --> 02:16:28.980 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering if the
 
02:16:32.270 --> 02:16:32.280 align:start position:0%
expenditures that are saved in that so
 
02:16:33.770 --> 02:16:33.780 align:start position:0%
that the money that is not spent on
 
02:16:35.389 --> 02:16:35.399 align:start position:0%
police over police and community that
 
02:16:38.389 --> 02:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
kind of thing is that factored into the
 
02:16:41.209 --> 02:16:41.219 align:start position:0%
financial the financials in this
 
02:16:43.310 --> 02:16:43.320 align:start position:0%
I don't believe the fifth School node
 
02:16:45.709 --> 02:16:45.719 align:start position:0%
addressed that
 
02:16:48.650 --> 02:16:48.660 align:start position:0%
so it would be appropriate to evaluate
 
02:16:48.660 --> 02:16:49.610 align:start position:0%
so it would be appropriate to evaluate
that

02:16:49.610 --> 02:16:49.620 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:16:52.429 --> 02:16:52.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:56.389 --> 02:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:57.889 --> 02:16:57.899 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for your time
 
02:16:59.389 --> 02:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
and partaking my question it's actually
 
02:17:01.730 --> 02:17:01.740 align:start position:0%
a follow-up to representative Newell's
 
02:17:01.740 --> 02:17:02.990 align:start position:0%
a follow-up to representative Newell's
question

02:17:02.990 --> 02:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:17:06.049 --> 02:17:06.059 align:start position:0%
um have you if this bill were to be
 
02:17:08.650 --> 02:17:08.660 align:start position:0%
passed and so we would no longer need to
 
02:17:12.110 --> 02:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
put people into jails for marijuana
 
02:17:13.429 --> 02:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
violations do you have any information
 
02:17:15.709 --> 02:17:15.719 align:start position:0%
about what kind of cost saving that is
 
02:17:17.389 --> 02:17:17.399 align:start position:0%
or do you know
 
02:17:19.849 --> 02:17:19.859 align:start position:0%
um you know cumulatively or if you have
 
02:17:21.530 --> 02:17:21.540 align:start position:0%
any information or or ideas about the
 
02:17:23.870 --> 02:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
best way to determine the reduction in
 
02:17:25.490 --> 02:17:25.500 align:start position:0%
cost which would not just be at the
 
02:17:26.810 --> 02:17:26.820 align:start position:0%
state levels but also at the county
 
02:17:26.820 --> 02:17:28.730 align:start position:0%
state levels but also at the county
levels

02:17:28.730 --> 02:17:28.740 align:start position:0%
levels
 
02:17:33.110 --> 02:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question it's
 
02:17:35.450 --> 02:17:35.460 align:start position:0%
clear that we should know the answer to
 
02:17:42.889 --> 02:17:42.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:44.929 --> 02:17:44.939 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
02:17:48.650 --> 02:17:48.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:50.750 --> 02:17:50.760 align:start position:0%

02:17:50.760 --> 02:18:01.790 align:start position:0%
and the chair recognizes Heather Marie

02:18:05.389 --> 02:18:05.399 align:start position:0%
can you hear me all right good morning
 
02:18:09.410 --> 02:18:09.420 align:start position:0%
my name is Heather Marie Brown and I am
 
02:18:12.889 --> 02:18:12.899 align:start position:0%
the vice chairman for the therapeutic
 
02:18:16.009 --> 02:18:16.019 align:start position:0%
cannabis medical oversight board this is
 
02:18:18.049 --> 02:18:18.059 align:start position:0%
a board that works with health and human
 
02:18:19.910 --> 02:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
services that was established
 
02:18:22.969 --> 02:18:22.979 align:start position:0%
legislatively several years ago to
 
02:18:25.129 --> 02:18:25.139 align:start position:0%
oversee Public Health the safety matters
 
02:18:28.250 --> 02:18:28.260 align:start position:0%
and so forth I'm here on my own
 
02:18:31.849 --> 02:18:31.859 align:start position:0%
recognance and to represent the Thirteen
 
02:18:33.830 --> 02:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
thousand plus patients that we have in
 
02:18:36.110 --> 02:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
this state and I can tell you from a
 
02:18:39.049 --> 02:18:39.059 align:start position:0%
personal level that although I am
 
02:18:42.349 --> 02:18:42.359 align:start position:0%
extremely supportive of legalizing
 
02:18:44.990 --> 02:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
cannabis in the state of New Hampshire I
 
02:18:48.469 --> 02:18:48.479 align:start position:0%
do not necessarily agree that this bill
 
02:18:51.129 --> 02:18:51.139 align:start position:0%
is the way to do that
 
02:18:55.450 --> 02:18:55.460 align:start position:0%
I have a couple of issues with the bill
 
02:19:00.650 --> 02:19:00.660 align:start position:0%
and those issues would be on
 
02:19:03.530 --> 02:19:03.540 align:start position:0%
as introduced page
 
02:19:03.540 --> 02:19:04.969 align:start position:0%
as introduced page
one

02:19:04.969 --> 02:19:04.979 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:19:08.750 --> 02:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
number line 14 all retail Cannabis
 
02:19:11.570 --> 02:19:11.580 align:start position:0%
stores shall be operated by the state of
 
02:19:14.450 --> 02:19:14.460 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I have not
 
02:19:18.349 --> 02:19:18.359 align:start position:0%
seen a state where legalization has come
 
02:19:21.770 --> 02:19:21.780 align:start position:0%
forward where they have had a successful
 
02:19:23.530 --> 02:19:23.540 align:start position:0%
cannabis program
 
02:19:26.990 --> 02:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
controlled and run by the state in such
 
02:19:29.929 --> 02:19:29.939 align:start position:0%
a fashion as a potential liquor store
 
02:19:34.129 --> 02:19:34.139 align:start position:0%
model I just it hasn't worked I believe
 
02:19:36.770 --> 02:19:36.780 align:start position:0%
that if legalization comes to the state
 
02:19:40.129 --> 02:19:40.139 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire that it should be open
 
02:19:43.129 --> 02:19:43.139 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire residents and to
 
02:19:45.230 --> 02:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
promote small business growth and
 
02:19:48.530 --> 02:19:48.540 align:start position:0%
development within the citizens not to
 
02:19:51.469 --> 02:19:51.479 align:start position:0%
create a monopoly-like structure for the
 
02:19:53.210 --> 02:19:53.220 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire
 
02:19:58.910 --> 02:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:00.830 --> 02:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
page three
 
02:20:03.110 --> 02:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
line 23
 
02:20:06.050 --> 02:20:06.060 align:start position:0%
it says cannabis products containing THC
 
02:20:08.090 --> 02:20:08.100 align:start position:0%
purchased from a retail cannabis store
 
02:20:10.610 --> 02:20:10.620 align:start position:0%
which shall be limited to therapeutic
 
02:20:13.130 --> 02:20:13.140 align:start position:0%
use only for which the purchaser
 
02:20:15.590 --> 02:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
presents documentation permitting use of
 
02:20:20.150 --> 02:20:20.160 align:start position:0%
cannabis for therapeutic purposes
 
02:20:24.349 --> 02:20:24.359 align:start position:0%
this bill basically what this is saying
 
02:20:27.410 --> 02:20:27.420 align:start position:0%
is that these monopolized stores
 
02:20:29.469 --> 02:20:29.479 align:start position:0%
controlled by the state of New Hampshire
 
02:20:32.990 --> 02:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
can potentially poach therapeutic
 
02:20:37.190 --> 02:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
cannabis patients and provide a
 
02:20:39.170 --> 02:20:39.180 align:start position:0%
detrimental effect to the therapeutic
 
02:20:40.750 --> 02:20:40.760 align:start position:0%
cannabis program
 
02:20:44.690 --> 02:20:44.700 align:start position:0%
that should not be allowed adult use
 
02:20:47.410 --> 02:20:47.420 align:start position:0%
should be exactly that adult use
 
02:20:49.790 --> 02:20:49.800 align:start position:0%
therapeutic should be exactly that
 
02:20:52.550 --> 02:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
therapeutic use the two of them should
 
02:20:55.730 --> 02:20:55.740 align:start position:0%
not intermingle in any way shape or form
 
02:20:58.370 --> 02:20:58.380 align:start position:0%
I think it's inappropriate for that to
 
02:21:01.969 --> 02:21:01.979 align:start position:0%
be in there or to even be considered we
 
02:21:05.210 --> 02:21:05.220 align:start position:0%
don't want to create a problem within
 
02:21:08.510 --> 02:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis program because
 
02:21:13.070 --> 02:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
regardless of adult use whether it and
 
02:21:15.110 --> 02:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
now it's not a question of whether or
 
02:21:17.389 --> 02:21:17.399 align:start position:0%
not it will happen it's a question of
 
02:21:20.030 --> 02:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
when it will happen and
 
02:21:23.030 --> 02:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
and we still will need a therapeutic
 
02:21:25.910 --> 02:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
cannabis program intact running and
 
02:21:29.030 --> 02:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
operated because that program provides
 
02:21:32.330 --> 02:21:32.340 align:start position:0%
the information the research and the
 
02:21:35.510 --> 02:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
resources that patients need in order to
 
02:21:40.370 --> 02:21:40.380 align:start position:0%
create a proper treatment regimen for
 
02:21:42.650 --> 02:21:42.660 align:start position:0%
themselves in their health and in their
 
02:21:45.889 --> 02:21:45.899 align:start position:0%
health and wellness this bill there is
 
02:21:48.290 --> 02:21:48.300 align:start position:0%
nothing in this bill that says any of
 
02:21:51.650 --> 02:21:51.660 align:start position:0%
the people working for these stores are
 
02:21:53.870 --> 02:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
going to have the education the
 
02:21:55.849 --> 02:21:55.859 align:start position:0%
knowledge or be able to provide
 
02:21:58.010 --> 02:21:58.020 align:start position:0%
information to therapeutic cannabis
 
02:22:00.830 --> 02:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
patients in the manner of which they
 
02:22:02.389 --> 02:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
receive now through our local
 
02:22:02.399 --> 02:22:04.010 align:start position:0%
receive now through our local
dispensaries

02:22:04.010 --> 02:22:04.020 align:start position:0%
dispensaries
 
02:22:07.910 --> 02:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
so although I do think this is a good
 
02:22:10.309 --> 02:22:10.319 align:start position:0%
attempt and although I do support
 
02:22:14.450 --> 02:22:14.460 align:start position:0%
legalization I do not believe that this
 
02:22:18.710 --> 02:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
bill is the best way to do that I think
 
02:22:20.870 --> 02:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
that it creates a whole bunch of new
 
02:22:23.690 --> 02:22:23.700 align:start position:0%
problems I think that
 
02:22:27.170 --> 02:22:27.180 align:start position:0%
those items should be struck in and I
 
02:22:30.290 --> 02:22:30.300 align:start position:0%
would rather see a much better system
 
02:22:32.090 --> 02:22:32.100 align:start position:0%
come to place in the state of New
 
02:22:34.790 --> 02:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in regards to adult use
 
02:22:37.610 --> 02:22:37.620 align:start position:0%
I will gladly answer any questions you
 
02:22:38.570 --> 02:22:38.580 align:start position:0%
may have
 
02:22:41.330 --> 02:22:41.340 align:start position:0%
and I thank you for the opportunity to
 
02:22:41.340 --> 02:22:45.050 align:start position:0%
and I thank you for the opportunity to
speak

02:22:45.050 --> 02:22:45.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:47.690 --> 02:22:47.700 align:start position:0%
representative Newell
 
02:22:50.030 --> 02:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
uh you know clearly we do have a couple
 
02:22:52.250 --> 02:22:52.260 align:start position:0%
of different iterations of similar bills
 
02:22:53.630 --> 02:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
do you think that this one can be
 
02:22:56.570 --> 02:22:56.580 align:start position:0%
amended to be appropriate and to satisfy
 
02:22:58.849 --> 02:22:58.859 align:start position:0%
your concerns or do you think that
 
02:23:01.070 --> 02:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
um that we would need a completely
 
02:23:04.250 --> 02:23:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:07.610 --> 02:23:07.620 align:start position:0%
well as many of you may know there have
 
02:23:10.010 --> 02:23:10.020 align:start position:0%
been several legalization bills that
 
02:23:13.130 --> 02:23:13.140 align:start position:0%
have been presented this session and I
 
02:23:15.050 --> 02:23:15.060 align:start position:0%
personally find that all of them have
 
02:23:18.410 --> 02:23:18.420 align:start position:0%
their own issues and problems within
 
02:23:21.889 --> 02:23:21.899 align:start position:0%
each particular bill I I hate to say it
 
02:23:24.230 --> 02:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
but I do believe that if you took all of
 
02:23:26.690 --> 02:23:26.700 align:start position:0%
those bills and you stripped them apart
 
02:23:29.030 --> 02:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
and you took bits and pieces from each
 
02:23:32.990 --> 02:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
bill you could come up with a very
 
02:23:35.809 --> 02:23:35.819 align:start position:0%
satisfactory structure in order to
 
02:23:38.929 --> 02:23:38.939 align:start position:0%
promote adults adult use in the state of
 
02:23:41.570 --> 02:23:41.580 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and not interfere with the
 
02:23:43.849 --> 02:23:43.859 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program as it is
 
02:23:43.859 --> 02:23:51.410 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program as it is
now

02:23:51.410 --> 02:23:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:51.420 --> 02:23:52.490 align:start position:0%
 
to

02:23:52.490 --> 02:23:52.500 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:23:56.809 --> 02:23:56.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:58.550 --> 02:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
anyone else wishing to testify on this
 
02:23:58.560 --> 02:24:02.809 align:start position:0%
anyone else wishing to testify on this
bill

02:24:02.809 --> 02:24:02.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:05.570 --> 02:24:05.580 align:start position:0%
there being none I hereby
 
02:24:08.170 --> 02:24:08.180 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing on
 
02:24:16.010 --> 02:24:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:16.020 --> 02:24:17.630 align:start position:0%
 
interesting

02:24:17.630 --> 02:24:17.640 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
02:24:21.770 --> 02:24:21.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:24.290 --> 02:24:24.300 align:start position:0%
are you introduced
 
02:24:27.050 --> 02:24:27.060 align:start position:0%
is this your bill yeah and I recognize
 
02:24:29.510 --> 02:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
representative stanzo to introduce his
 
02:24:29.520 --> 02:24:31.550 align:start position:0%
representative stanzo to introduce his
bill

02:24:31.550 --> 02:24:31.560 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:24:34.130 --> 02:24:34.140 align:start position:0%
thank you uh chairman and members of the
 
02:24:36.250 --> 02:24:36.260 align:start position:0%
criminal justice committee uh my name is
 
02:24:38.150 --> 02:24:38.160 align:start position:0%
representative Samson nastasso
 
02:24:40.190 --> 02:24:40.200 align:start position:0%
representing the towns of Rindge Dublin
 
02:24:41.750 --> 02:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
and Jaffrey
 
02:24:45.830 --> 02:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
and uh House Bill 581 is a simple bill
 
02:24:49.910 --> 02:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
it deletes uh the controlled Drug Act in
 
02:24:51.889 --> 02:24:51.899 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and established the study
 
02:24:53.929 --> 02:24:53.939 align:start position:0%
committee on the implementation of
 
02:24:56.809 --> 02:24:56.819 align:start position:0%
deleting the controlled Drug Act this
 
02:24:59.270 --> 02:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
builds the ultimate solution to the drug
 
02:25:01.370 --> 02:25:01.380 align:start position:0%
legalization question all these bills
 
02:25:03.349 --> 02:25:03.359 align:start position:0%
are getting filed that are nitpicking in
 
02:25:05.150 --> 02:25:05.160 align:start position:0%
different ways and stuff this is where
 
02:25:08.050 --> 02:25:08.060 align:start position:0%
it's going to go ultimately just as the
 
02:25:10.130 --> 02:25:10.140 align:start position:0%
18th Amendment of the United States
 
02:25:13.010 --> 02:25:13.020 align:start position:0%
Constitution was repealed
 
02:25:16.130 --> 02:25:16.140 align:start position:0%
um the 18th Amendment which prohibited
 
02:25:17.809 --> 02:25:17.819 align:start position:0%
the manufacturer's sale and
 
02:25:20.290 --> 02:25:20.300 align:start position:0%
transportation of intoxicating Liquors
 
02:25:22.790 --> 02:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
is pretty interesting for a couple of
 
02:25:25.849 --> 02:25:25.859 align:start position:0%
reasons one that at the time they
 
02:25:27.170 --> 02:25:27.180 align:start position:0%
recognized that they couldn't just
 
02:25:30.110 --> 02:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
prohibit uh straight up possession so
 
02:25:33.349 --> 02:25:33.359 align:start position:0%
there's it wasn't illegal to possess
 
02:25:37.730 --> 02:25:37.740 align:start position:0%
liquor during prohibition the other
 
02:25:38.809 --> 02:25:38.819 align:start position:0%
thing that's interesting is that they
 
02:25:38.819 --> 02:25:39.710 align:start position:0%
thing that's interesting is that they
actually

02:25:39.710 --> 02:25:39.720 align:start position:0%
actually
 
02:25:42.530 --> 02:25:42.540 align:start position:0%
passed an amendment to the Constitution
 
02:25:42.540 --> 02:25:43.910 align:start position:0%
passed an amendment to the Constitution
because

02:25:43.910 --> 02:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:25:47.389 --> 02:25:47.399 align:start position:0%
at the time in the 1920s they actually
 
02:25:48.770 --> 02:25:48.780 align:start position:0%
had respect for the Constitution and
 
02:25:50.809 --> 02:25:50.819 align:start position:0%
they did things like have Congress
 
02:25:54.410 --> 02:25:54.420 align:start position:0%
declare war and uh used sound money that
 
02:25:55.969 --> 02:25:55.979 align:start position:0%
was is mandated by the Constitution that
 
02:25:58.070 --> 02:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
we use gold
 
02:26:01.070 --> 02:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
um so in order for uh in section two
 
02:26:03.190 --> 02:26:03.200 align:start position:0%
I'll just read to the 18th Amendment so
 
02:26:06.349 --> 02:26:06.359 align:start position:0%
uh section one after one year from the
 
02:26:08.030 --> 02:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
ratification of this article the
 
02:26:10.010 --> 02:26:10.020 align:start position:0%
manufacturers sale a transportation of
 
02:26:11.630 --> 02:26:11.640 align:start position:0%
intoxicating Liquors
 
02:26:14.270 --> 02:26:14.280 align:start position:0%
uh within the importation thereof into
 
02:26:16.550 --> 02:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
or the exportation thereof from the
 
02:26:17.690 --> 02:26:17.700 align:start position:0%
United States and all territories
 
02:26:19.910 --> 02:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
subject to the jurisdiction thereof for
 
02:26:22.910 --> 02:26:22.920 align:start position:0%
beverages purposes is hereby prohibited
 
02:26:25.309 --> 02:26:25.319 align:start position:0%
and then section two uh the Congress and
 
02:26:27.050 --> 02:26:27.060 align:start position:0%
the several States shall have the
 
02:26:28.730 --> 02:26:28.740 align:start position:0%
concurrent power to enforce this article
 
02:26:31.969 --> 02:26:31.979 align:start position:0%
by the appropriate legislation so this
 
02:26:34.490 --> 02:26:34.500 align:start position:0%
suggests that it was illegal for the
 
02:26:36.050 --> 02:26:36.060 align:start position:0%
states and the government to prohibit
 
02:26:38.030 --> 02:26:38.040 align:start position:0%
liquor without actually amending the
 
02:26:38.040 --> 02:26:39.490 align:start position:0%
liquor without actually amending the
Constitution

02:26:39.490 --> 02:26:39.500 align:start position:0%
Constitution
 
02:26:42.110 --> 02:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
and therefore the
 
02:26:43.570 --> 02:26:43.580 align:start position:0%
all the
 
02:26:45.950 --> 02:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
controlled substance acts in New
 
02:26:48.290 --> 02:26:48.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's included are illegal all
 
02:26:50.750 --> 02:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
right uh so any private property is
 
02:26:52.610 --> 02:26:52.620 align:start position:0%
natural to man laws that prohibit
 
02:26:54.170 --> 02:26:54.180 align:start position:0%
possession of certain items such as
 
02:26:56.570 --> 02:26:56.580 align:start position:0%
drugs or Firearms or infringement on an
 
02:26:58.670 --> 02:26:58.680 align:start position:0%
individual right to own and use their
 
02:27:00.349 --> 02:27:00.359 align:start position:0%
property as they see fit as long as an
 
02:27:01.790 --> 02:27:01.800 align:start position:0%
individual is not harming others or
 
02:27:03.050 --> 02:27:03.060 align:start position:0%
common disturbance they should be able
 
02:27:05.030 --> 02:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
to possess whatever they choose on their
 
02:27:06.170 --> 02:27:06.180 align:start position:0%
own property without government
 
02:27:06.180 --> 02:27:08.570 align:start position:0%
own property without government
interference

02:27:08.570 --> 02:27:08.580 align:start position:0%
interference
 
02:27:10.670 --> 02:27:10.680 align:start position:0%
um criminalizing possession leads to the
 
02:27:13.250 --> 02:27:13.260 align:start position:0%
over criminalization of society people
 
02:27:15.290 --> 02:27:15.300 align:start position:0%
who are not committing any harm end up
 
02:27:16.849 --> 02:27:16.859 align:start position:0%
getting labeled as criminals and face
 
02:27:18.290 --> 02:27:18.300 align:start position:0%
the consequences that come with the
 
02:27:20.330 --> 02:27:20.340 align:start position:0%
label such as fines imprisonment
 
02:27:23.870 --> 02:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
criminal record which have uh severe and
 
02:27:28.190 --> 02:27:28.200 align:start position:0%
life lasting impact on on them uh and
 
02:27:29.570 --> 02:27:29.580 align:start position:0%
then some of these prohibited substances
 
02:27:31.610 --> 02:27:31.620 align:start position:0%
are controlled acts uh like DMT for
 
02:27:33.530 --> 02:27:33.540 align:start position:0%
example have an enormous tradition of
 
02:27:36.050 --> 02:27:36.060 align:start position:0%
religious use uh that out you know
 
02:27:37.790 --> 02:27:37.800 align:start position:0%
longer than uh the United States even
 
02:27:41.210 --> 02:27:41.220 align:start position:0%
existed uh so and just having this in
 
02:27:43.670 --> 02:27:43.680 align:start position:0%
Statue is completely a violation of the
 
02:27:45.410 --> 02:27:45.420 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Constitution uh article
 
02:27:48.170 --> 02:27:48.180 align:start position:0%
one a part one Article Five
 
02:27:49.730 --> 02:27:49.740 align:start position:0%
um additionally they use Laws
 
02:27:51.110 --> 02:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
disproportionately affect marginalized
 
02:27:53.090 --> 02:27:53.100 align:start position:0%
communities uh some even argue that the
 
02:27:55.250 --> 02:27:55.260 align:start position:0%
purpose of drug war was intentionally to
 
02:27:57.889 --> 02:27:57.899 align:start position:0%
control minority communities
 
02:27:59.510 --> 02:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
um but is known that individuals from
 
02:28:02.750 --> 02:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
low income and minority groups are just
 
02:28:04.550 --> 02:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
partially targeted and arrested for drug
 
02:28:07.849 --> 02:28:07.859 align:start position:0%
possession despite similar usage rates
 
02:28:10.849 --> 02:28:10.859 align:start position:0%
across different groups uh so an
 
02:28:12.590 --> 02:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
anecdotally uh group that I'm very
 
02:28:14.030 --> 02:28:14.040 align:start position:0%
familiar with was the a second Airborne
 
02:28:17.330 --> 02:28:17.340 align:start position:0%
Division which was definitely the
 
02:28:19.670 --> 02:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
highest drug use I've ever seen anywhere
 
02:28:23.030 --> 02:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
it was so rampant uh it was just in my
 
02:28:24.830 --> 02:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
face all the time I was a medic in the
 
02:28:28.070 --> 02:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
Army so I got a lot of practice uh doing
 
02:28:30.410 --> 02:28:30.420 align:start position:0%
IVs in the barracks and there was no
 
02:28:32.510 --> 02:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
questions asked when my Aid back needed
 
02:28:34.849 --> 02:28:34.859 align:start position:0%
to be replenished
 
02:28:38.510 --> 02:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
um it was it's just known so but
 
02:28:42.110 --> 02:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
America won't enforce these drug laws on
 
02:28:43.250 --> 02:28:43.260 align:start position:0%
their own troops there's no enforcement
 
02:28:46.010 --> 02:28:46.020 align:start position:0%
uh because they'd have to face the
 
02:28:48.710 --> 02:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
embarrassment of a drug-addicted uh
 
02:28:51.290 --> 02:28:51.300 align:start position:0%
troops and the hypocrisy of a government
 
02:28:54.349 --> 02:28:54.359 align:start position:0%
that knows this situation and uh but
 
02:28:56.510 --> 02:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
instead sends SWAT teams into uh regular
 
02:28:59.809 --> 02:28:59.819 align:start position:0%
Americans homes to compensate drugs
 
02:29:03.290 --> 02:29:03.300 align:start position:0%
uh so I just uh
 
02:29:05.090 --> 02:29:05.100 align:start position:0%
on prohibition
 
02:29:07.150 --> 02:29:07.160 align:start position:0%
somebody asked me to bring up this quote
 
02:29:10.849 --> 02:29:10.859 align:start position:0%
from H.L Milken so five years of
 
02:29:13.010 --> 02:29:13.020 align:start position:0%
Prohibition have had at least this one
 
02:29:15.230 --> 02:29:15.240 align:start position:0%
benign effect they have completely
 
02:29:17.210 --> 02:29:17.220 align:start position:0%
disposed of all the favorite arguments
 
02:29:19.550 --> 02:29:19.560 align:start position:0%
of the prohibitionists none of the great
 
02:29:21.530 --> 02:29:21.540 align:start position:0%
Boons and user effects that were to
 
02:29:22.969 --> 02:29:22.979 align:start position:0%
follow the passage of the 18th Amendment
 
02:29:24.349 --> 02:29:24.359 align:start position:0%
have come to pass
 
02:29:26.510 --> 02:29:26.520 align:start position:0%
there is not less drunkenness in the
 
02:29:27.710 --> 02:29:27.720 align:start position:0%
Republic but more
 
02:29:30.710 --> 02:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
there's not less crime but more not less
 
02:29:33.050 --> 02:29:33.060 align:start position:0%
insanity but more the cost of government
 
02:29:35.510 --> 02:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
is not smaller but vastly greater
 
02:29:37.070 --> 02:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
and respect for the law has not
 
02:29:41.270 --> 02:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
increased but this minute diminished
 
02:29:43.429 --> 02:29:43.439 align:start position:0%
and that is true I feel like the respect
 
02:29:46.790 --> 02:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
for law in uh this country is is greatly
 
02:29:48.950 --> 02:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
diminished because these arbitrary drug
 
02:29:50.750 --> 02:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
laws in the arbitrary enforcement of
 
02:29:50.760 --> 02:29:51.469 align:start position:0%
laws in the arbitrary enforcement of
them

02:29:51.469 --> 02:29:51.479 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:29:53.870 --> 02:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
so there's tons and tons of arguments
 
02:29:57.650 --> 02:29:57.660 align:start position:0%
against uh prohibition uh and just you
 
02:29:59.750 --> 02:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
know some of them you know like when
 
02:30:02.809 --> 02:30:02.819 align:start position:0%
drugs are legal uh police brief forces
 
02:30:05.210 --> 02:30:05.220 align:start position:0%
police resources can be reduced and
 
02:30:08.570 --> 02:30:08.580 align:start position:0%
yours to use towards combating uh real
 
02:30:11.389 --> 02:30:11.399 align:start position:0%
crimes like theft assault and murder uh
 
02:30:14.330 --> 02:30:14.340 align:start position:0%
I believe it's the reason why police are
 
02:30:17.389 --> 02:30:17.399 align:start position:0%
against uh changes like this is because
 
02:30:19.490 --> 02:30:19.500 align:start position:0%
you know it's going to reduce the
 
02:30:21.770 --> 02:30:21.780 align:start position:0%
resources that are needed to for that
 
02:30:23.870 --> 02:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
kind of thing so today the police are
 
02:30:25.610 --> 02:30:25.620 align:start position:0%
Mill tries to fight this War on Drugs
 
02:30:28.790 --> 02:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
the the actual 357 revolver cartridge
 
02:30:31.490 --> 02:30:31.500 align:start position:0%
was developed uh so the police could
 
02:30:34.130 --> 02:30:34.140 align:start position:0%
fight gangsters in the 1920s because
 
02:30:36.050 --> 02:30:36.060 align:start position:0%
with the uh now they were using body
 
02:30:39.950 --> 02:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
armor and uh you know car doors and
 
02:30:41.330 --> 02:30:41.340 align:start position:0%
stuff like this for cover
 
02:30:45.349 --> 02:30:45.359 align:start position:0%
uh instead of the uh 38 so and and that
 
02:30:47.090 --> 02:30:47.100 align:start position:0%
that was in the 20s now Keena Hampshire
 
02:30:49.610 --> 02:30:49.620 align:start position:0%
has uh what the city calls a ballistic
 
02:30:51.170 --> 02:30:51.180 align:start position:0%
engineered armored response
 
02:30:53.450 --> 02:30:53.460 align:start position:0%
counter-attack truck
 
02:30:56.570 --> 02:30:56.580 align:start position:0%
um but most people just call it a tank
 
02:31:00.710 --> 02:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
um so also it would reduce the harm
 
02:31:02.510 --> 02:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
associated with drugs okay so the
 
02:31:03.650 --> 02:31:03.660 align:start position:0%
criminalization drugs doesn't do
 
02:31:05.090 --> 02:31:05.100 align:start position:0%
anything to stop the sale distribution
 
02:31:08.090 --> 02:31:08.100 align:start position:0%
of drugs it just pushes the uh
 
02:31:10.550 --> 02:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
this Market underground you know leading
 
02:31:12.590 --> 02:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
drugs to be adultered and contaminated
 
02:31:13.570 --> 02:31:13.580 align:start position:0%
with other
 
02:31:17.710 --> 02:31:17.720 align:start position:0%
harmful substances all right so deleting
 
02:31:20.750 --> 02:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
318b which this bill does will make the
 
02:31:22.550 --> 02:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
drug sales more transparent to the end
 
02:31:22.560 --> 02:31:24.590 align:start position:0%
drug sales more transparent to the end
user

02:31:24.590 --> 02:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
user
 
02:31:26.510 --> 02:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
um it reduced the number of people in
 
02:31:29.030 --> 02:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
prison so legalization and drugs to
 
02:31:30.770 --> 02:31:30.780 align:start position:0%
decrease the number of people being sent
 
02:31:32.870 --> 02:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
to prison for drug offenses reducing the
 
02:31:34.969 --> 02:31:34.979 align:start position:0%
strain on the prison system and reducing
 
02:31:36.410 --> 02:31:36.420 align:start position:0%
the number of people who would be fired
 
02:31:37.730 --> 02:31:37.740 align:start position:0%
from life from certain opportunities
 
02:31:39.710 --> 02:31:39.720 align:start position:0%
because of their criminal record
 
02:31:43.429 --> 02:31:43.439 align:start position:0%
uh so I urge the committee to take you
 
02:31:45.110 --> 02:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
know very simple Common Sense approach
 
02:31:47.389 --> 02:31:47.399 align:start position:0%
to this problem by deleting the
 
02:31:49.370 --> 02:31:49.380 align:start position:0%
controlled Drug Act and making the OTP
 
02:31:52.190 --> 02:31:52.200 align:start position:0%
motion uh on this bill
 
02:31:54.950 --> 02:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
all right and I'll take any questions
 
02:31:58.969 --> 02:31:58.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:00.349 --> 02:32:00.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:32:01.790 --> 02:32:01.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:32:06.230 --> 02:32:06.240 align:start position:0%
I understand that the chapter 318b
 
02:32:11.210 --> 02:32:11.220 align:start position:0%
um includes rsas that give New Hampshire
 
02:32:13.969 --> 02:32:13.979 align:start position:0%
entities the ability the sort of like
 
02:32:16.429 --> 02:32:16.439 align:start position:0%
legal coverage to engage in activities
 
02:32:21.190 --> 02:32:21.200 align:start position:0%
that violate federal law for example
 
02:32:23.630 --> 02:32:23.640 align:start position:0%
naloxone being an over-the-counter
 
02:32:25.610 --> 02:32:25.620 align:start position:0%
product in New Hampshire
 
02:32:28.969 --> 02:32:28.979 align:start position:0%
um which is sort of In conflict with FDA
 
02:32:30.950 --> 02:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
standards and DEA standards from
 
02:32:33.490 --> 02:32:33.500 align:start position:0%
naloxone that's in 318b
 
02:32:38.150 --> 02:32:38.160 align:start position:0%
the syringe program is part of 380b is
 
02:32:40.250 --> 02:32:40.260 align:start position:0%
it your intent to repeal
 
02:32:40.260 --> 02:32:41.090 align:start position:0%
it your intent to repeal
um

02:32:41.090 --> 02:32:41.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:43.250 --> 02:32:43.260 align:start position:0%
laws that we have in New Hampshire that
 
02:32:46.670 --> 02:32:46.680 align:start position:0%
give legal shelter to people trying to
 
02:32:48.950 --> 02:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
engage in harm reduction
 
02:32:52.610 --> 02:32:52.620 align:start position:0%
yeah so like 318b is extensive it covers
 
02:32:53.990 --> 02:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of things like when you're talking
 
02:32:57.710 --> 02:32:57.720 align:start position:0%
about so this bill it goes into effect
 
02:33:02.270 --> 02:33:02.280 align:start position:0%
in 2025 and also establishes a study
 
02:33:06.650 --> 02:33:06.660 align:start position:0%
committee so we can uh make legislation
 
02:33:08.929 --> 02:33:08.939 align:start position:0%
to move that kind of stuff in other
 
02:33:08.939 --> 02:33:11.990 align:start position:0%
to move that kind of stuff in other
places

02:33:11.990 --> 02:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:14.750 --> 02:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
yes Father
 
02:33:16.730 --> 02:33:16.740 align:start position:0%
is it your thank you for taking my
 
02:33:17.929 --> 02:33:17.939 align:start position:0%
follow-up question so is it your
 
02:33:21.110 --> 02:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
understanding or expectation that
 
02:33:23.389 --> 02:33:23.399 align:start position:0%
um after the repeal and and before the
 
02:33:26.389 --> 02:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
passage of new legislation that for a
 
02:33:28.370 --> 02:33:28.380 align:start position:0%
period of time it wouldn't be possible
 
02:33:31.010 --> 02:33:31.020 align:start position:0%
for harm reduction efforts in New
 
02:33:32.570 --> 02:33:32.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to operate with that legal
 
02:33:32.580 --> 02:33:34.309 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to operate with that legal
cover

02:33:34.309 --> 02:33:34.319 align:start position:0%
cover
 
02:33:38.270 --> 02:33:38.280 align:start position:0%
so uh a matter of priorities uh if it
 
02:33:40.370 --> 02:33:40.380 align:start position:0%
comes to using government resources for
 
02:33:42.110 --> 02:33:42.120 align:start position:0%
harm reduction that would be preferable
 
02:33:46.010 --> 02:33:46.020 align:start position:0%
to using them uh for criminalization uh
 
02:33:49.070 --> 02:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
so if that was the Compromise then I
 
02:33:51.170 --> 02:33:51.180 align:start position:0%
would I would be for uh using government
 
02:33:53.929 --> 02:33:53.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:56.450 --> 02:33:56.460 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy
 
02:33:58.130 --> 02:33:58.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:33:59.630 --> 02:33:59.640 align:start position:0%
my question actually you probably just
 
02:34:01.730 --> 02:34:01.740 align:start position:0%
to answer this a little bit but you had
 
02:34:04.010 --> 02:34:04.020 align:start position:0%
said that this passage of this bill
 
02:34:07.070 --> 02:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
would reduce harm and I just wondered if
 
02:34:09.170 --> 02:34:09.180 align:start position:0%
you could explain a little bit more how
 
02:34:11.090 --> 02:34:11.100 align:start position:0%
it would how that would
 
02:34:13.130 --> 02:34:13.140 align:start position:0%
reduce harm thank you
 
02:34:17.270 --> 02:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
well uh for one uh drugs are cut uh with
 
02:34:20.809 --> 02:34:20.819 align:start position:0%
other substances because it's uh you
 
02:34:23.210 --> 02:34:23.220 align:start position:0%
know uh this Market is unregulated
 
02:34:24.830 --> 02:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
there's no one to check there's no way
 
02:34:26.270 --> 02:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
to know right especially if you're just
 
02:34:29.990 --> 02:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
an end user and then uh
 
02:34:33.349 --> 02:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
like the drugs are like supercharged
 
02:34:35.270 --> 02:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
they find out ways to make them more
 
02:34:37.429 --> 02:34:37.439 align:start position:0%
powerful than they were otherwise
 
02:34:40.550 --> 02:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
because because they're prohibited uh
 
02:34:42.290 --> 02:34:42.300 align:start position:0%
when you're transporting them or
 
02:34:44.330 --> 02:34:44.340 align:start position:0%
anything like this you know you want to
 
02:34:48.170 --> 02:34:48.180 align:start position:0%
transport more uh like potent drugs uh
 
02:34:50.090 --> 02:34:50.100 align:start position:0%
instead of something you don't need a
 
02:34:51.650 --> 02:34:51.660 align:start position:0%
car full of something that's not as
 
02:34:52.969 --> 02:34:52.979 align:start position:0%
potent you know because if it's illegal
 
02:34:55.849 --> 02:34:55.859 align:start position:0%
you have to densify it if you will so
 
02:34:57.950 --> 02:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
that's some of the things that increase
 
02:35:00.770 --> 02:35:00.780 align:start position:0%
harm besides that
 
02:35:00.780 --> 02:35:02.090 align:start position:0%
harm besides that
um

02:35:02.090 --> 02:35:02.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:04.490 --> 02:35:04.500 align:start position:0%
just you know the criminalization of it
 
02:35:06.590 --> 02:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
makes it you know so that there's no
 
02:35:09.889 --> 02:35:09.899 align:start position:0%
legal recourse in the in the way most
 
02:35:11.450 --> 02:35:11.460 align:start position:0%
business is done so people have to
 
02:35:13.010 --> 02:35:13.020 align:start position:0%
resort to uh violence and things like
 
02:35:13.020 --> 02:35:14.389 align:start position:0%
resort to uh violence and things like
this

02:35:14.389 --> 02:35:14.399 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:35:17.330 --> 02:35:17.340 align:start position:0%
to conduct their business like
 
02:35:20.450 --> 02:35:20.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:24.170 --> 02:35:24.180 align:start position:0%
yeah I just have a question about
 
02:35:27.050 --> 02:35:27.060 align:start position:0%
line one in this bill that says
 
02:35:30.110 --> 02:35:30.120 align:start position:0%
repeal RSA 318b relative to the control
 
02:35:33.590 --> 02:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
Doug is repealed
 
02:35:36.530 --> 02:35:36.540 align:start position:0%
so what happens when this Bill gets
 
02:35:38.929 --> 02:35:38.939 align:start position:0%
caught that gets passed is that
 
02:35:41.230 --> 02:35:41.240 align:start position:0%
automatically um
 
02:35:43.670 --> 02:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
repealed by the passage of the
 
02:35:45.230 --> 02:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
government when the governor were to
 
02:35:47.809 --> 02:35:47.819 align:start position:0%
sign this and what date would that be
 
02:35:47.819 --> 02:35:49.309 align:start position:0%
sign this and what date would that be
effective

02:35:49.309 --> 02:35:49.319 align:start position:0%
effective
 
02:35:52.610 --> 02:35:52.620 align:start position:0%
yeah that's correct so uh if this passes
 
02:35:56.150 --> 02:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
uh the drug the drug uh 318b isn't
 
02:35:58.910 --> 02:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
deleted immediately but it will be uh
 
02:36:01.670 --> 02:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
July 1st 2025 and
 
02:36:05.809 --> 02:36:05.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:07.309 --> 02:36:07.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:36:09.290 --> 02:36:09.300 align:start position:0%
representative breed
 
02:36:11.750 --> 02:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
02:36:11.760 --> 02:36:13.130 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
um

02:36:13.130 --> 02:36:13.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:17.330 --> 02:36:17.340 align:start position:0%
if this bill if the controlled Drug Act
 
02:36:19.309 --> 02:36:19.319 align:start position:0%
is repealed what would that look like
 
02:36:20.990 --> 02:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
would you go to the grocery you know
 
02:36:23.870 --> 02:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
would it be can you just go and buy any
 
02:36:25.790 --> 02:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
of these controlled substances from your
 
02:36:28.010 --> 02:36:28.020 align:start position:0%
pharmacist what does what would it look
 
02:36:30.590 --> 02:36:30.600 align:start position:0%
like thank you
 
02:36:34.610 --> 02:36:34.620 align:start position:0%
yeah uh so we'd expect that dangerous
 
02:36:37.730 --> 02:36:37.740 align:start position:0%
substances like you know hard drugs and
 
02:36:39.710 --> 02:36:39.720 align:start position:0%
stuff like this they would be illegal
 
02:36:42.309 --> 02:36:42.319 align:start position:0%
you could sell them to the public
 
02:36:47.510 --> 02:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
but uh it would be not publicly popular
 
02:36:49.610 --> 02:36:49.620 align:start position:0%
to sell these things to children and we
 
02:36:51.230 --> 02:36:51.240 align:start position:0%
feel like the market would would
 
02:36:53.389 --> 02:36:53.399 align:start position:0%
regulate that kind of thing and not put
 
02:36:54.950 --> 02:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
it in places where it would be
 
02:36:54.960 --> 02:36:57.889 align:start position:0%
it in places where it would be
inappropriate

02:36:57.889 --> 02:36:57.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:01.130 --> 02:37:01.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:03.050 --> 02:37:03.060 align:start position:0%
representative Pratt
 
02:37:04.490 --> 02:37:04.500 align:start position:0%
is this similar to what they did in
 
02:37:04.500 --> 02:37:05.990 align:start position:0%
is this similar to what they did in
Oregon

02:37:05.990 --> 02:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
Oregon
 
02:37:07.670 --> 02:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
oh sorry I didn't hear you say that
 
02:37:08.630 --> 02:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
again please
 
02:37:09.889 --> 02:37:09.899 align:start position:0%
it's just similar what they did in
 
02:37:11.690 --> 02:37:11.700 align:start position:0%
Oregon State
 
02:37:13.849 --> 02:37:13.859 align:start position:0%
or on state legalized or decriminalized
 
02:37:16.429 --> 02:37:16.439 align:start position:0%
all drugs is this what this is
 
02:37:19.910 --> 02:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I can't hear you
 
02:37:22.070 --> 02:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
is this the same as decriminalizing
 
02:37:25.070 --> 02:37:25.080 align:start position:0%
drugs as they did in Oregon State
 
02:37:28.429 --> 02:37:28.439 align:start position:0%
this just deletes 318b
 
02:37:30.469 --> 02:37:30.479 align:start position:0%
so it would make it like lots of things
 
02:37:40.670 --> 02:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:40.680 --> 02:37:47.210 align:start position:0%
 
right

02:37:47.210 --> 02:37:47.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:48.950 --> 02:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
apologize Mr chair didn't hear the end
 
02:37:50.210 --> 02:37:50.220 align:start position:0%
of that
 
02:37:52.370 --> 02:37:52.380 align:start position:0%
um my question would be uh you know when
 
02:37:53.809 --> 02:37:53.819 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
02:37:57.230 --> 02:37:57.240 align:start position:0%
um establishing a committee uh talks
 
02:37:59.150 --> 02:37:59.160 align:start position:0%
about to study the statutory of policy
 
02:38:01.670 --> 02:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh changes to state law necessary to
 
02:38:04.910 --> 02:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
implement the repeal my concern is uh
 
02:38:07.010 --> 02:38:07.020 align:start position:0%
about the regulation I mean you
 
02:38:08.990 --> 02:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
literally just said no regulation you
 
02:38:11.630 --> 02:38:11.640 align:start position:0%
you also had mentioned
 
02:38:14.450 --> 02:38:14.460 align:start position:0%
um you know the the things that are put
 
02:38:17.210 --> 02:38:17.220 align:start position:0%
into uh other drugs and and things will
 
02:38:18.469 --> 02:38:18.479 align:start position:0%
be mixed in and people don't know
 
02:38:21.410 --> 02:38:21.420 align:start position:0%
exactly what's in there and so my
 
02:38:23.929 --> 02:38:23.939 align:start position:0%
question is you know
 
02:38:26.690 --> 02:38:26.700 align:start position:0%
would the committee be also what would
 
02:38:29.150 --> 02:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
what the committee is studying include
 
02:38:32.330 --> 02:38:32.340 align:start position:0%
uh testing and analyzing and labeling so
 
02:38:33.830 --> 02:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
that people actually do know what is in
 
02:38:36.050 --> 02:38:36.060 align:start position:0%
their drugs and and regulation in that
 
02:38:36.060 --> 02:38:38.630 align:start position:0%
their drugs and and regulation in that
way

02:38:38.630 --> 02:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:41.690 --> 02:38:41.700 align:start position:0%
uh you're asking uh how we would know
 
02:38:44.210 --> 02:38:44.220 align:start position:0%
that the drugs are clean or whatever uh
 
02:38:48.290 --> 02:38:48.300 align:start position:0%
without regulation yes yeah so uh the
 
02:38:50.330 --> 02:38:50.340 align:start position:0%
market would regulate that just like ISO
 
02:38:53.929 --> 02:38:53.939 align:start position:0%
9001 uh the way they regulate industry
 
02:38:55.610 --> 02:38:55.620 align:start position:0%
and all these other organizations there
 
02:38:56.870 --> 02:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
would be
 
02:38:56.880 --> 02:38:57.530 align:start position:0%
would be
um

02:38:57.530 --> 02:38:57.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:00.969 --> 02:39:00.979 align:start position:0%
you know independent uh organizations
 
02:39:04.070 --> 02:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
that would vouch that you know they
 
02:39:05.330 --> 02:39:05.340 align:start position:0%
would check out this these guys
 
02:39:07.190 --> 02:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
producing this drug and they would put
 
02:39:09.770 --> 02:39:09.780 align:start position:0%
out a report that says they're legit
 
02:39:11.210 --> 02:39:11.220 align:start position:0%
um just the way a lot of things are
 
02:39:13.550 --> 02:39:13.560 align:start position:0%
regulated in the market so in the way
 
02:39:15.170 --> 02:39:15.180 align:start position:0%
the government would do it except we
 
02:39:16.790 --> 02:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
don't we don't need
 
02:39:20.090 --> 02:39:20.100 align:start position:0%
to extort the public to have these
 
02:39:22.610 --> 02:39:22.620 align:start position:0%
checks we can just let the market Do It
 
02:39:23.870 --> 02:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
um and there'd be demand for that kind
 
02:39:29.990 --> 02:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:31.370 --> 02:39:31.380 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony this
 
02:39:33.650 --> 02:39:33.660 align:start position:0%
morning representative thank you the
 
02:39:36.950 --> 02:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes Ms Bonnie Freeman of
 
02:39:46.370 --> 02:39:46.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:49.309 --> 02:39:49.319 align:start position:0%
hello my name is Bonnie Freeman
 
02:39:51.230 --> 02:39:51.240 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to come and support
 
02:39:52.670 --> 02:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:39:55.070 --> 02:39:55.080 align:start position:0%
Terence McKenna wrote that unsrambled
 
02:39:57.770 --> 02:39:57.780 align:start position:0%
rationalism male dominance and attention
 
02:40:00.230 --> 02:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
to the visible surface of things had
 
02:40:03.349 --> 02:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
rendered Society very very sick
 
02:40:05.330 --> 02:40:05.340 align:start position:0%
as a progressive who believes humans
 
02:40:07.490 --> 02:40:07.500 align:start position:0%
were put on this Earth to evolve and
 
02:40:09.110 --> 02:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
create a better and better world for us
 
02:40:10.969 --> 02:40:10.979 align:start position:0%
to live in I believe that the
 
02:40:12.590 --> 02:40:12.600 align:start position:0%
government's hindering of human beings
 
02:40:14.330 --> 02:40:14.340 align:start position:0%
exploring their own Consciousness
 
02:40:16.910 --> 02:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
Consciousness which humans calling
 
02:40:18.530 --> 02:40:18.540 align:start position:0%
themselves government have no right to
 
02:40:21.170 --> 02:40:21.180 align:start position:0%
do in the first place is not only evil
 
02:40:23.389 --> 02:40:23.399 align:start position:0%
but holding human beings back from our
 
02:40:23.399 --> 02:40:24.469 align:start position:0%
but holding human beings back from our
potential

02:40:24.469 --> 02:40:24.479 align:start position:0%
potential
 
02:40:26.990 --> 02:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
exploring different states of Mind helps
 
02:40:29.270 --> 02:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
people to grow in their perspectives to
 
02:40:29.280 --> 02:40:30.410 align:start position:0%
people to grow in their perspectives to
change

02:40:30.410 --> 02:40:30.420 align:start position:0%
change
 
02:40:32.570 --> 02:40:32.580 align:start position:0%
I agree with McKenna that our society
 
02:40:34.790 --> 02:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
today is very sick and even sicker now
 
02:40:36.410 --> 02:40:36.420 align:start position:0%
than it was when he died in the year
 
02:40:36.420 --> 02:40:38.090 align:start position:0%
than it was when he died in the year
2000.

02:40:38.090 --> 02:40:38.100 align:start position:0%
2000.
 
02:40:41.030 --> 02:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
as of 2016 2.3 million people were
 
02:40:43.429 --> 02:40:43.439 align:start position:0%
incarcerated in the United States
 
02:40:48.889 --> 02:40:48.899 align:start position:0%
at a rate of 698 people per 100 000.
 
02:40:52.250 --> 02:40:52.260 align:start position:0%
um that doesn't sound like a very
 
02:40:54.349 --> 02:40:54.359 align:start position:0%
I mean it sounds like a sick Society to
 
02:40:54.359 --> 02:40:55.610 align:start position:0%
I mean it sounds like a sick Society to
me

02:40:55.610 --> 02:40:55.620 align:start position:0%
me
 
02:40:58.849 --> 02:40:58.859 align:start position:0%
and it's honestly uh barbaric
 
02:41:00.469 --> 02:41:00.479 align:start position:0%
the fact that most of those people not
 
02:41:01.790 --> 02:41:01.800 align:start position:0%
most of those people but any of those
 
02:41:05.050 --> 02:41:05.060 align:start position:0%
people are in prison for uh
 
02:41:06.889 --> 02:41:06.899 align:start position:0%
utilizing their right to put whatever
 
02:41:08.450 --> 02:41:08.460 align:start position:0%
they want into their body and it is
 
02:41:09.950 --> 02:41:09.960 align:start position:0%
right because they're not doing anything
 
02:41:11.929 --> 02:41:11.939 align:start position:0%
wrong to anyone else
 
02:41:13.969 --> 02:41:13.979 align:start position:0%
is disgusting to me
 
02:41:15.650 --> 02:41:15.660 align:start position:0%
and no matter what you guys decide today
 
02:41:17.270 --> 02:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
you won't be able to stop everyone in
 
02:41:18.410 --> 02:41:18.420 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire from putting whatever
 
02:41:20.210 --> 02:41:20.220 align:start position:0%
substances they want into their body
 
02:41:20.220 --> 02:41:21.349 align:start position:0%
substances they want into their body
anyways

02:41:21.349 --> 02:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
anyways
 
02:41:26.330 --> 02:41:26.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:27.889 --> 02:41:27.899 align:start position:0%
thank you for sharing with us this
 
02:41:27.899 --> 02:41:29.450 align:start position:0%
thank you for sharing with us this
morning

02:41:29.450 --> 02:41:29.460 align:start position:0%
morning
 
02:41:31.010 --> 02:41:31.020 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who has not
 
02:41:34.730 --> 02:41:34.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:46.090 --> 02:41:46.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:48.770 --> 02:41:48.780 align:start position:0%
uh good morning thank you for listening
 
02:41:51.469 --> 02:41:51.479 align:start position:0%
today on this very important piece of
 
02:41:53.590 --> 02:41:53.600 align:start position:0%
legislation I understand that for
 
02:41:56.210 --> 02:41:56.220 align:start position:0%
decades now we've been arguing over
 
02:41:59.570 --> 02:41:59.580 align:start position:0%
nibbling around the edges of the the War
 
02:42:01.730 --> 02:42:01.740 align:start position:0%
on Drugs talking about ending
 
02:42:04.070 --> 02:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
prohibition of cannabis that alone has
 
02:42:06.650 --> 02:42:06.660 align:start position:0%
been controversial I expect this one
 
02:42:08.870 --> 02:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
will be quite controversial as well but
 
02:42:10.670 --> 02:42:10.680 align:start position:0%
the reality is and I don't think there's
 
02:42:13.670 --> 02:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
any controversy that the War on Drugs
 
02:42:15.710 --> 02:42:15.720 align:start position:0%
has failed
 
02:42:18.349 --> 02:42:18.359 align:start position:0%
it has been failing from the very
 
02:42:18.359 --> 02:42:19.309 align:start position:0%
it has been failing from the very
beginning

02:42:19.309 --> 02:42:19.319 align:start position:0%
beginning
 
02:42:21.710 --> 02:42:21.720 align:start position:0%
it has cost trillions
 
02:42:24.530 --> 02:42:24.540 align:start position:0%
of dollars it has cost thousands if not
 
02:42:27.670 --> 02:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of ruined lives
 
02:42:30.170 --> 02:42:30.180 align:start position:0%
millions of people have been put behind
 
02:42:30.180 --> 02:42:31.429 align:start position:0%
millions of people have been put behind
bars

02:42:31.429 --> 02:42:31.439 align:start position:0%
bars
 
02:42:32.929 --> 02:42:32.939 align:start position:0%
who have never harmed another human
 
02:42:36.770 --> 02:42:36.780 align:start position:0%
being they simply took a substance into
 
02:42:40.969 --> 02:42:40.979 align:start position:0%
their body to change their state
 
02:42:43.250 --> 02:42:43.260 align:start position:0%
it has never worked prohibition has
 
02:42:45.950 --> 02:42:45.960 align:start position:0%
never succeeded all it has succeeded in
 
02:42:48.950 --> 02:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
doing as Mr Santa nastasso pointed out
 
02:42:51.050 --> 02:42:51.060 align:start position:0%
as creating a black market
 
02:42:53.690 --> 02:42:53.700 align:start position:0%
and making the drugs even more dangerous
 
02:42:56.929 --> 02:42:56.939 align:start position:0%
than they have ever been
 
02:42:59.570 --> 02:42:59.580 align:start position:0%
now this isn't your fault this was done
 
02:43:02.210 --> 02:43:02.220 align:start position:0%
before you guys came into office it was
 
02:43:05.530 --> 02:43:05.540 align:start position:0%
done decades ago and it was done under
 
02:43:09.230 --> 02:43:09.240 align:start position:0%
dishonesty and lies to make this War on
 
02:43:10.849 --> 02:43:10.859 align:start position:0%
Drugs happen
 
02:43:12.349 --> 02:43:12.359 align:start position:0%
it doesn't work
 
02:43:15.469 --> 02:43:15.479 align:start position:0%
and we've seen people who are in the
 
02:43:18.290 --> 02:43:18.300 align:start position:0%
business of fighting this war who have
 
02:43:20.530 --> 02:43:20.540 align:start position:0%
said that there was recently a DEA agent
 
02:43:23.630 --> 02:43:23.640 align:start position:0%
who was arrested for corruption of
 
02:43:23.640 --> 02:43:24.410 align:start position:0%
who was arrested for corruption of
course

02:43:24.410 --> 02:43:24.420 align:start position:0%
course
 
02:43:27.050 --> 02:43:27.060 align:start position:0%
and before he went to prison he spilled
 
02:43:28.849 --> 02:43:28.859 align:start position:0%
the beans he said that everyone in the
 
02:43:31.670 --> 02:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
DEA knows that the War on Drugs is a
 
02:43:33.290 --> 02:43:33.300 align:start position:0%
failure they know it
 
02:43:36.650 --> 02:43:36.660 align:start position:0%
they know they can't win this war
 
02:43:38.510 --> 02:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
it's impossible and that's because
 
02:43:41.690 --> 02:43:41.700 align:start position:0%
supply and demand cannot be defeated as
 
02:43:43.370 --> 02:43:43.380 align:start position:0%
long as there is someone out there who
 
02:43:46.010 --> 02:43:46.020 align:start position:0%
wants to use drugs there will be someone
 
02:43:48.410 --> 02:43:48.420 align:start position:0%
who's willing to flaunt the law to make
 
02:43:51.290 --> 02:43:51.300 align:start position:0%
the insane profits that they're able to
 
02:43:54.650 --> 02:43:54.660 align:start position:0%
make because of the War on Drugs
 
02:43:57.650 --> 02:43:57.660 align:start position:0%
that's where the money gets good because
 
02:44:00.349 --> 02:44:00.359 align:start position:0%
it's illegal to sell these products it
 
02:44:02.570 --> 02:44:02.580 align:start position:0%
becomes worth a lot more
 
02:44:04.610 --> 02:44:04.620 align:start position:0%
so we would likely see the prices of
 
02:44:07.190 --> 02:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
drugs come down we would see the quality
 
02:44:08.809 --> 02:44:08.819 align:start position:0%
of the drugs go up we wouldn't see
 
02:44:11.510 --> 02:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
adulterants being added to these drugs
 
02:44:13.490 --> 02:44:13.500 align:start position:0%
which means that you would see fewer
 
02:44:15.650 --> 02:44:15.660 align:start position:0%
overdose deaths we know there's a
 
02:44:17.330 --> 02:44:17.340 align:start position:0%
problem with Heroin we know there's a
 
02:44:19.190 --> 02:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
problem with with a lot of drugs people
 
02:44:22.630 --> 02:44:22.640 align:start position:0%
being abusing these drugs
 
02:44:25.070 --> 02:44:25.080 align:start position:0%
that's not a crime it shouldn't be a
 
02:44:27.650 --> 02:44:27.660 align:start position:0%
crime to have a medical problem an
 
02:44:29.990 --> 02:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
addiction and throwing someone into a
 
02:44:32.510 --> 02:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
prison cell doesn't help them with that
 
02:44:32.520 --> 02:44:34.130 align:start position:0%
prison cell doesn't help them with that
addiction

02:44:34.130 --> 02:44:34.140 align:start position:0%
addiction
 
02:44:36.889 --> 02:44:36.899 align:start position:0%
so if we want if we really do care about
 
02:44:39.590 --> 02:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
drug users and that is reportedly the
 
02:44:42.889 --> 02:44:42.899 align:start position:0%
reason why the War on Drugs exists is to
 
02:44:46.070 --> 02:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
supposedly help people
 
02:44:47.929 --> 02:44:47.939 align:start position:0%
than if we really cared about them we
 
02:44:51.110 --> 02:44:51.120 align:start position:0%
would pass this bill and end the war on
 
02:44:53.210 --> 02:44:53.220 align:start position:0%
drugs and Lead the Way
 
02:44:55.309 --> 02:44:55.319 align:start position:0%
in the United States
 
02:44:57.469 --> 02:44:57.479 align:start position:0%
to do that because then those people
 
02:44:58.790 --> 02:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
would actually be able to get the help
 
02:45:00.590 --> 02:45:00.600 align:start position:0%
that they need we've seen it in places
 
02:45:02.510 --> 02:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
like Portugal which has had
 
02:45:04.670 --> 02:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
decriminalization of all drugs for a
 
02:45:06.230 --> 02:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
very long time for about two decades
 
02:45:08.630 --> 02:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
people aren't afraid to go and get help
 
02:45:10.309 --> 02:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
whereas now they're afraid because they
 
02:45:12.050 --> 02:45:12.060 align:start position:0%
think they're going to get turned in
 
02:45:14.630 --> 02:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
and they'll have to go to prison
 
02:45:16.490 --> 02:45:16.500 align:start position:0%
so if we really care about people this
 
02:45:19.670 --> 02:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
is uh is the way to go yes people are
 
02:45:22.250 --> 02:45:22.260 align:start position:0%
going to do drugs irresponsibly they
 
02:45:24.469 --> 02:45:24.479 align:start position:0%
already do that
 
02:45:26.630 --> 02:45:26.640 align:start position:0%
it's already illegal to get behind the
 
02:45:28.550 --> 02:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
wheel of a car and drive under the
 
02:45:31.429 --> 02:45:31.439 align:start position:0%
influence that is not being repealed
 
02:45:31.439 --> 02:45:32.210 align:start position:0%
influence that is not being repealed
here

02:45:32.210 --> 02:45:32.220 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:45:34.849 --> 02:45:34.859 align:start position:0%
DUI would still be a crime
 
02:45:36.889 --> 02:45:36.899 align:start position:0%
so this just looks at reality and it
 
02:45:39.889 --> 02:45:39.899 align:start position:0%
says we're going to admit here in New
 
02:45:42.050 --> 02:45:42.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that the War on Drugs has
 
02:45:45.889 --> 02:45:45.899 align:start position:0%
failed we can admit our failure
 
02:45:48.830 --> 02:45:48.840 align:start position:0%
and try to make it right thank you happy
 
02:45:50.469 --> 02:45:50.479 align:start position:0%
to take questions
 
02:45:55.130 --> 02:45:55.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:57.230 --> 02:45:57.240 align:start position:0%
so you did talk about people getting
 
02:46:00.650 --> 02:46:00.660 align:start position:0%
addicted and it's not their fault and
 
02:46:02.150 --> 02:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't go to prison
 
02:46:04.490 --> 02:46:04.500 align:start position:0%
but if we repeal all this
 
02:46:06.830 --> 02:46:06.840 align:start position:0%
and correct me if I'm wrong it would
 
02:46:09.349 --> 02:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
make it a lot easier
 
02:46:11.450 --> 02:46:11.460 align:start position:0%
for a larger number of people to get
 
02:46:14.090 --> 02:46:14.100 align:start position:0%
addicted because it would be handed to
 
02:46:16.670 --> 02:46:16.680 align:start position:0%
them pretty much is that correct I don't
 
02:46:18.290 --> 02:46:18.300 align:start position:0%
know if it would really be that easy I
 
02:46:19.969 --> 02:46:19.979 align:start position:0%
mean anybody that wants drugs can get
 
02:46:19.979 --> 02:46:20.750 align:start position:0%
mean anybody that wants drugs can get
them

02:46:20.750 --> 02:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:46:22.790 --> 02:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
it's you know you just have to know the
 
02:46:23.809 --> 02:46:23.819 align:start position:0%
right people
 
02:46:27.170 --> 02:46:27.180 align:start position:0%
you can get them online now too
 
02:46:27.180 --> 02:46:28.309 align:start position:0%
you can get them online now too
yeah

02:46:28.309 --> 02:46:28.319 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:46:29.929 --> 02:46:29.939 align:start position:0%
I don't think they're threatening those
 
02:46:31.370 --> 02:46:31.380 align:start position:0%
people with jail I'm just going to stop
 
02:46:31.380 --> 02:46:32.450 align:start position:0%
people with jail I'm just going to stop
them

investigations it is becoming more and
 
03:52:43.849 --> 03:52:43.859 align:start position:0%
more common that these seizures are tied
 
03:52:46.910 --> 03:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
to violent crimes and deadly weapons
 
03:52:48.889 --> 03:52:48.899 align:start position:0%
many of our investigations originate

from someone who commits a crime who is
 
03:52:53.210 --> 03:52:53.220 align:start position:0%
going to provide information in exchange
 
03:52:55.370 --> 03:52:55.380 align:start position:0%
for consideration on the on their charge
 
03:52:59.030 --> 03:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
in turn we are able to expand and Branch
 
03:53:01.490 --> 03:53:01.500 align:start position:0%
out our investigations
 
03:53:03.110 --> 03:53:03.120 align:start position:0%
when I was being aware of house bill
 
03:53:03.120 --> 03:53:05.269 align:start position:0%
when I was being aware of house bill

03:53:05.269 --> 03:53:05.279 align:start position:0%
473--fm
 
03:53:07.729 --> 03:53:07.739 align:start position:0%
it concerned me greatly as I know the
 
03:53:09.410 --> 03:53:09.420 align:start position:0%
negative effect it will have on our
 
03:53:12.130 --> 03:53:12.140 align:start position:0%
state and local communities house bill
 
03:53:14.570 --> 03:53:14.580 align:start position:0%
473-fn is seeking to reduce the penalty
 
03:53:16.250 --> 03:53:16.260 align:start position:0%
for schedule one through four in
 
03:53:18.650 --> 03:53:18.660 align:start position:0%
Narcotics from our class B felony to a
 
03:53:21.050 --> 03:53:21.060 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor for offenses
 
03:53:23.510 --> 03:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
this will inherently New
 
03:53:25.429 --> 03:53:25.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law enforcement in our role of
 
03:53:27.590 --> 03:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
enforcing prevention of serious
 
03:53:29.929 --> 03:53:29.939 align:start position:0%
narcotics as those people would who
 
03:53:31.309 --> 03:53:31.319 align:start position:0%
would normally be willing to provide
 
03:53:34.250 --> 03:53:34.260 align:start position:0%
information will no longer do so as
 
03:53:36.590 --> 03:53:36.600 align:start position:0%
there will be little deterrence
 
03:53:38.269 --> 03:53:38.279 align:start position:0%
we need to look no further than the
 
03:53:40.429 --> 03:53:40.439 align:start position:0%
state of Oregon which in 2020 shows a
 
03:53:42.590 --> 03:53:42.600 align:start position:0%
similar path in decriminalizing serious
 
03:53:42.600 --> 03:53:44.690 align:start position:0%
similar path in decriminalizing serious
narcotics

03:53:44.690 --> 03:53:44.700 align:start position:0%
narcotics
 
03:53:47.330 --> 03:53:47.340 align:start position:0%
an Associated Press article from 2021
 
03:53:49.490 --> 03:53:49.500 align:start position:0%
outlined since decriminalization Oregon
 
03:53:52.309 --> 03:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
Saw an increase of 20 percent in
 
03:53:54.170 --> 03:53:54.180 align:start position:0%
overdose deaths
 
03:53:57.170 --> 03:53:57.180 align:start position:0%
with a budget of 302 million dollars in
 
03:53:58.389 --> 03:53:58.399 align:start position:0%
facilities used for treatment
 
03:54:01.550 --> 03:54:01.560 align:start position:0%
furthermore out of the 16 000 people who
 
03:54:03.830 --> 03:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
set access to services for the first
 
03:54:05.450 --> 03:54:05.460 align:start position:0%
year of the decremental
 
03:54:08.110 --> 03:54:08.120 align:start position:0%
decriminalization only
 
03:54:11.150 --> 03:54:11.160 align:start position:0%
0.85 percent entered treatment so less
 
03:54:14.210 --> 03:54:14.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:16.309 --> 03:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
given my years of experience as a police
 
03:54:19.190 --> 03:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
officer and as a detective in their in
 
03:54:20.870 --> 03:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
the narcotics unit
 
03:54:22.969 --> 03:54:22.979 align:start position:0%
the knowledge I've gained supports at
 
03:54:24.710 --> 03:54:24.720 align:start position:0%
these illegal drugs specifically those
 
03:54:26.330 --> 03:54:26.340 align:start position:0%
designated schedule one through four
 
03:54:28.490 --> 03:54:28.500 align:start position:0%
have a ripple effect caused by their
 
03:54:30.530 --> 03:54:30.540 align:start position:0%
trafficking and use
 
03:54:32.510 --> 03:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
I have seen firsthand that these drugs
 
03:54:34.490 --> 03:54:34.500 align:start position:0%
have an addiction rate that is linked to
 
03:54:37.130 --> 03:54:37.140 align:start position:0%
other crimes that occur such as but not
 
03:54:39.889 --> 03:54:39.899 align:start position:0%
limited to burglaries thefts assaults
 
03:54:42.889 --> 03:54:42.899 align:start position:0%
violent crimes Etc
 
03:54:44.689 --> 03:54:44.699 align:start position:0%
and more often than not are the driving
 
03:54:47.630 --> 03:54:47.640 align:start position:0%
Factor Behind These offenses in closing
 
03:54:49.729 --> 03:54:49.739 align:start position:0%
it is my opinion supported by years of
 
03:54:51.650 --> 03:54:51.660 align:start position:0%
being on the front lines in this
 
03:54:53.650 --> 03:54:53.660 align:start position:0%
epidemic that house bill
 
03:54:56.809 --> 03:54:56.819 align:start position:0%
473-ftn will have an adverse effect more
 
03:54:59.030 --> 03:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
than its intended purpose
 
03:55:01.309 --> 03:55:01.319 align:start position:0%
I ask that you find this bill in
 
03:55:03.110 --> 03:55:03.120 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate
 
03:55:04.670 --> 03:55:04.680 align:start position:0%
I thank you again for your time and
 
03:55:05.750 --> 03:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
consideration in this matter
 
03:55:08.590 --> 03:55:08.600 align:start position:0%
respectfully detective Jonathan Duchene
 
03:55:10.550 --> 03:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
Manchester Police Department special
 
03:55:13.729 --> 03:55:13.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:15.170 --> 03:55:15.180 align:start position:0%
thank you detective are there any
 
03:55:16.729 --> 03:55:16.739 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
03:55:20.630 --> 03:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am representative Knoll
 
03:55:23.090 --> 03:55:23.100 align:start position:0%
thank you and uh thank you for taking my
 
03:55:23.100 --> 03:55:24.410 align:start position:0%
thank you and uh thank you for taking my
question

03:55:24.410 --> 03:55:24.420 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:55:27.650 --> 03:55:27.660 align:start position:0%
um you talked about
 
03:55:29.570 --> 03:55:29.580 align:start position:0%
um you know Manchester being Ground Zero
 
03:55:31.849 --> 03:55:31.859 align:start position:0%
I mean New Hampshire being Ground Zero
 
03:55:33.769 --> 03:55:33.779 align:start position:0%
um I'm very familiar with um the
 
03:55:36.170 --> 03:55:36.180 align:start position:0%
overdose crisis I actually lost my uh
 
03:55:37.729 --> 03:55:37.739 align:start position:0%
children's father and fiance at the time
 
03:55:40.429 --> 03:55:40.439 align:start position:0%
14 years ago uh Christmas Eve to
 
03:55:42.229 --> 03:55:42.239 align:start position:0%
overdose so it's been a little over 14
 
03:55:45.610 --> 03:55:45.620 align:start position:0%
years and over those 14 years I've seen
 
03:55:48.590 --> 03:55:48.600 align:start position:0%
prevention enforcement through the
 
03:55:50.290 --> 03:55:50.300 align:start position:0%
criminal justice system
 
03:55:54.650 --> 03:55:54.660 align:start position:0%
not only in his case but also you know
 
03:55:56.110 --> 03:55:56.120 align:start position:0%
just over time
 
03:55:58.849 --> 03:55:58.859 align:start position:0%
increase and increase and yet the
 
03:56:01.070 --> 03:56:01.080 align:start position:0%
problem has gotten worse and I'm just
 
03:56:03.170 --> 03:56:03.180 align:start position:0%
curious you know more people die all the
 
03:56:04.910 --> 03:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
time and so
 
03:56:06.950 --> 03:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
um I wonder how you feel about this
 
03:56:06.960 --> 03:56:08.570 align:start position:0%
um I wonder how you feel about this
approach

03:56:08.570 --> 03:56:08.580 align:start position:0%
approach
 
03:56:11.030 --> 03:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
um and how successful it is
 
03:56:12.590 --> 03:56:12.600 align:start position:0%
well first off
 
03:56:15.889 --> 03:56:15.899 align:start position:0%
um I'm very sorry for your loss what I
 
03:56:17.929 --> 03:56:17.939 align:start position:0%
can say given my experience is if we
 
03:56:20.210 --> 03:56:20.220 align:start position:0%
reduce the penalty on this there's going
 
03:56:21.050 --> 03:56:21.060 align:start position:0%
to be
 
03:56:24.229 --> 03:56:24.239 align:start position:0%
a Floodgate Of the drugs entering in the
 
03:56:25.969 --> 03:56:25.979 align:start position:0%
state even more so than there already is
 
03:56:28.550 --> 03:56:28.560 align:start position:0%
and it's going to make our job
 
03:56:31.870 --> 03:56:31.880 align:start position:0%
almost impossible to to do to try and
 
03:56:34.849 --> 03:56:34.859 align:start position:0%
go after the suppliers and go after the
 
03:56:36.969 --> 03:56:36.979 align:start position:0%
people that are affected essentially
 
03:56:39.290 --> 03:56:39.300 align:start position:0%
Distributing poison out on our streets
 
03:56:42.290 --> 03:56:42.300 align:start position:0%
and that's why I'm here today and that's
 
03:56:46.490 --> 03:56:46.500 align:start position:0%
why I'm very concerned with this bill
 
03:56:46.500 --> 03:56:47.809 align:start position:0%
why I'm very concerned with this bill
father

03:56:47.809 --> 03:56:47.819 align:start position:0%
father
 
03:56:50.630 --> 03:56:50.640 align:start position:0%
you recognize a follow-up question
 
03:56:52.790 --> 03:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
thank you and I I mean no disrespect I'm
 
03:56:55.189 --> 03:56:55.199 align:start position:0%
not trying to criticize it all I I fully
 
03:56:56.510 --> 03:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
believe that
 
03:56:59.210 --> 03:56:59.220 align:start position:0%
um that the intention here is is very
 
03:57:01.130 --> 03:57:01.140 align:start position:0%
pure and good
 
03:57:03.950 --> 03:57:03.960 align:start position:0%
um my question is the the follow-up is
 
03:57:07.309 --> 03:57:07.319 align:start position:0%
is one of the issues that you cited is
 
03:57:09.710 --> 03:57:09.720 align:start position:0%
um the fact that Fentanyl and now other
 
03:57:12.050 --> 03:57:12.060 align:start position:0%
drugs are are being found in substances
 
03:57:14.929 --> 03:57:14.939 align:start position:0%
and they are much more powerful and and
 
03:57:14.939 --> 03:57:16.370 align:start position:0%
and they are much more powerful and and
harmful

03:57:16.370 --> 03:57:16.380 align:start position:0%
harmful
 
03:57:19.429 --> 03:57:19.439 align:start position:0%
um and I'm wondering you know
 
03:57:21.530 --> 03:57:21.540 align:start position:0%
do you think it would make your job
 
03:57:24.710 --> 03:57:24.720 align:start position:0%
easier and and be helpful to people who
 
03:57:27.710 --> 03:57:27.720 align:start position:0%
are struggling with it to um to know
 
03:57:29.809 --> 03:57:29.819 align:start position:0%
what's in their drugs and you know know
 
03:57:31.790 --> 03:57:31.800 align:start position:0%
what's in their supply
 
03:57:31.800 --> 03:57:32.750 align:start position:0%
what's in their supply
um

03:57:32.750 --> 03:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:34.269 --> 03:57:34.279 align:start position:0%
I guess that's the essential question
 
03:57:36.650 --> 03:57:36.660 align:start position:0%
what I can say is given my experience
 
03:57:39.650 --> 03:57:39.660 align:start position:0%
people that do have an addiction or
 
03:57:42.410 --> 03:57:42.420 align:start position:0%
people that are are dealing
 
03:57:44.269 --> 03:57:44.279 align:start position:0%
unfortunately really
 
03:57:46.610 --> 03:57:46.620 align:start position:0%
pay no attention to the potency in the
 
03:57:48.290 --> 03:57:48.300 align:start position:0%
drug more or less they're looking for
 
03:57:50.510 --> 03:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
the most potent drug that is out there
 
03:57:52.250 --> 03:57:52.260 align:start position:0%
to give them a better High out there on
 
03:57:55.130 --> 03:57:55.140 align:start position:0%
the street that's been my experience and
 
03:57:57.710 --> 03:57:57.720 align:start position:0%
specifically dealing with fentanyl
 
03:58:03.410 --> 03:58:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:06.950 --> 03:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:09.769 --> 03:58:09.779 align:start position:0%
hi detector
 
03:58:11.990 --> 03:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
question I have is this
 
03:58:16.070 --> 03:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
uh misdemeanor Aid carries a year
 
03:58:20.090 --> 03:58:20.100 align:start position:0%
in jail so the potential of that what
 
03:58:21.590 --> 03:58:21.600 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering about it which is
 
03:58:23.809 --> 03:58:23.819 align:start position:0%
significant for somebody that's using
 
03:58:26.090 --> 03:58:26.100 align:start position:0%
not selling
 
03:58:28.729 --> 03:58:28.739 align:start position:0%
where I'm going is this
 
03:58:32.769 --> 03:58:32.779 align:start position:0%
have or does anyone have any real
 
03:58:37.150 --> 03:58:37.160 align:start position:0%
statistics on just how
 
03:58:40.490 --> 03:58:40.500 align:start position:0%
Superior Court sentences people are they
 
03:58:41.870 --> 03:58:41.880 align:start position:0%
getting anything more than a year
 
03:58:45.309 --> 03:58:45.319 align:start position:0%
wouldn't misdemeanors do the same
 
03:58:48.110 --> 03:58:48.120 align:start position:0%
aggressive enforcement of misdemeanor do
 
03:58:50.750 --> 03:58:50.760 align:start position:0%
the same thing how are felony bees
 
03:58:53.570 --> 03:58:53.580 align:start position:0%
special felonies
 
03:58:55.729 --> 03:58:55.739 align:start position:0%
what what what is their outcome
 
03:58:55.739 --> 03:58:57.189 align:start position:0%
what what what is their outcome
typically

03:58:57.189 --> 03:58:57.199 align:start position:0%
typically
 
03:58:59.809 --> 03:58:59.819 align:start position:0%
do you see the area that I'm interested
 
03:58:59.819 --> 03:59:00.889 align:start position:0%
do you see the area that I'm interested
in

03:59:00.889 --> 03:59:00.899 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:59:03.349 --> 03:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
uh yes sir I I hope I can try and answer
 
03:59:06.050 --> 03:59:06.060 align:start position:0%
your question to the best of my ability
 
03:59:06.060 --> 03:59:06.769 align:start position:0%
your question to the best of my ability
um

03:59:06.769 --> 03:59:06.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:59:08.809 --> 03:59:08.819 align:start position:0%
it's been my experience especially
 
03:59:10.610 --> 03:59:10.620 align:start position:0%
dealing with serious narcotics such as
 
03:59:13.610 --> 03:59:13.620 align:start position:0%
fentanyl crystal methamphetamine those
 
03:59:15.590 --> 03:59:15.600 align:start position:0%
other driving Factor unfortunately what
 
03:59:18.410 --> 03:59:18.420 align:start position:0%
is taking place on the streets in
 
03:59:21.110 --> 03:59:21.120 align:start position:0%
Manchester right now and a lot of times
 
03:59:24.349 --> 03:59:24.359 align:start position:0%
those narcotics are kind of go hand in
 
03:59:26.030 --> 03:59:26.040 align:start position:0%
hand with um
 
03:59:28.670 --> 03:59:28.680 align:start position:0%
people that carry weapons and commit
 
03:59:31.370 --> 03:59:31.380 align:start position:0%
violent crimes and I'm sure many have
 
03:59:33.170 --> 03:59:33.180 align:start position:0%
seen in the news a lot lately that
 
03:59:35.929 --> 03:59:35.939 align:start position:0%
they're violent crimes do take place in
 
03:59:38.750 --> 03:59:38.760 align:start position:0%
Manchester more than we would hope for
 
03:59:42.650 --> 03:59:42.660 align:start position:0%
or want so there's definitely that
 
03:59:45.530 --> 03:59:45.540 align:start position:0%
factor with tied to these uh to these
 
03:59:51.889 --> 03:59:51.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:54.050 --> 03:59:54.060 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler thank you madam
 
03:59:57.170 --> 03:59:57.180 align:start position:0%
chair I appreciate your concern about
 
03:59:57.180 --> 03:59:58.490 align:start position:0%
chair I appreciate your concern about
people

03:59:58.490 --> 03:59:58.500 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:00:00.889 --> 04:00:00.899 align:start position:0%
and their addictions to opioids I'm
 
04:00:02.870 --> 04:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
wondering do you think throwing someone
 
04:00:05.269 --> 04:00:05.279 align:start position:0%
in prison would Aid or ail their
 
04:00:05.279 --> 04:00:10.070 align:start position:0%
in prison would Aid or ail their
addiction

04:00:10.070 --> 04:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:12.469 --> 04:00:12.479 align:start position:0%
Chief aldenberg is also here from the
 
04:00:14.870 --> 04:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
Manchester Police Department
 
04:00:16.849 --> 04:00:16.859 align:start position:0%
for the record I'm a chief Alan
 
04:00:18.349 --> 04:00:18.359 align:start position:0%
aldenberg chief of police the Manchester
 
04:00:19.670 --> 04:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
Police Department so representative
 
04:00:21.349 --> 04:00:21.359 align:start position:0%
you're asking
 
04:00:21.359 --> 04:00:23.210 align:start position:0%
you're asking
um

04:00:23.210 --> 04:00:23.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:24.889 --> 04:00:24.899 align:start position:0%
being in or out what would help their
 
04:00:26.689 --> 04:00:26.699 align:start position:0%
addiction most
 
04:00:28.670 --> 04:00:28.680 align:start position:0%
is that what you're saying well would
 
04:00:30.530 --> 04:00:30.540 align:start position:0%
being in prison Aid their addiction
 
04:00:32.389 --> 04:00:32.399 align:start position:0%
essentially would someone who's not
 
04:00:35.150 --> 04:00:35.160 align:start position:0%
selling uh and has been addicted to
 
04:00:36.830 --> 04:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
drugs with throwing them in prison well
 
04:00:38.210 --> 04:00:38.220 align:start position:0%
I mean the theory of somebody's in
 
04:00:39.530 --> 04:00:39.540 align:start position:0%
prison they shouldn't have access to
 
04:00:41.990 --> 04:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
drugs right but are there drugs in the
 
04:00:43.189 --> 04:00:43.199 align:start position:0%
criminal justice in the correction
 
04:00:44.870 --> 04:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
system yes they're right but not to the
 
04:00:47.210 --> 04:00:47.220 align:start position:0%
level that are on the streets
 
04:00:49.189 --> 04:00:49.199 align:start position:0%
so I'm kind of is that is that your
 
04:00:51.290 --> 04:00:51.300 align:start position:0%
point is that
 
04:00:53.090 --> 04:00:53.100 align:start position:0%
yeah I just want to make sure I got it
 
04:00:55.670 --> 04:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
right absolutely and I uh more wondering
 
04:00:57.469 --> 04:00:57.479 align:start position:0%
about the environments in prison if
 
04:00:59.689 --> 04:00:59.699 align:start position:0%
someone has is on the streets addicted
 
04:01:01.610 --> 04:01:01.620 align:start position:0%
to drugs and that homeless person is
 
04:01:03.950 --> 04:01:03.960 align:start position:0%
arrested and would would
 
04:01:07.790 --> 04:01:07.800 align:start position:0%
have been having them be in prison uh be
 
04:01:09.050 --> 04:01:09.060 align:start position:0%
conducive to them getting off the
 
04:01:09.060 --> 04:01:10.910 align:start position:0%
conducive to them getting off the
addiction

04:01:10.910 --> 04:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
addiction
 
04:01:13.250 --> 04:01:13.260 align:start position:0%
well certainly if somebody's addicted to
 
04:01:15.469 --> 04:01:15.479 align:start position:0%
drugs and they're still remaining on the
 
04:01:18.349 --> 04:01:18.359 align:start position:0%
street their ability to remain addicted
 
04:01:18.359 --> 04:01:20.269 align:start position:0%
street their ability to remain addicted
is

04:01:20.269 --> 04:01:20.279 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:01:22.429 --> 04:01:22.439 align:start position:0%
exponentially more if they were in a
 
04:01:25.550 --> 04:01:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:27.110 --> 04:01:27.120 align:start position:0%
so I hope I'm answering your question
 
04:01:29.450 --> 04:01:29.460 align:start position:0%
there so are people that are you know
 
04:01:33.830 --> 04:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
people are not being detained for drug
 
04:01:33.840 --> 04:01:35.150 align:start position:0%
people are not being detained for drug
offenses

04:01:35.150 --> 04:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
offenses
 
04:01:36.769 --> 04:01:36.779 align:start position:0%
um majority of them
 
04:01:38.750 --> 04:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
I'm sure there's others in the room that
 
04:01:41.090 --> 04:01:41.100 align:start position:0%
may disagree but people are being
 
04:01:43.189 --> 04:01:43.199 align:start position:0%
arrested for first offense third offense
 
04:01:44.870 --> 04:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
fifth offense for drug possession or
 
04:01:48.110 --> 04:01:48.120 align:start position:0%
drug distribution and of being released
 
04:01:50.030 --> 04:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
over and over and over and that's not
 
04:01:52.130 --> 04:01:52.140 align:start position:0%
helping the addiction problem that's not
 
04:01:54.769 --> 04:01:54.779 align:start position:0%
helping what we're dealing with is it is
 
04:01:56.389 --> 04:01:56.399 align:start position:0%
imprisoned and putting people in prison
 
04:01:58.670 --> 04:01:58.680 align:start position:0%
the answer to this problem I wouldn't
 
04:02:00.950 --> 04:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
Advocate that I think that you know
 
04:02:02.830 --> 04:02:02.840 align:start position:0%
along the lines of treatment
 
04:02:05.530 --> 04:02:05.540 align:start position:0%
intervention education
 
04:02:08.570 --> 04:02:08.580 align:start position:0%
whatever we can do along those lines is
 
04:02:11.450 --> 04:02:11.460 align:start position:0%
just as important as the enforcement
 
04:02:14.030 --> 04:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
angle right we're not going to enforce
 
04:02:15.950 --> 04:02:15.960 align:start position:0%
that way out of this problem
 
04:02:18.650 --> 04:02:18.660 align:start position:0%
are we going to get our way out of this
 
04:02:20.150 --> 04:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
problem by putting everybody into jail
 
04:02:23.150 --> 04:02:23.160 align:start position:0%
in a prison no I don't
 
04:02:26.210 --> 04:02:26.220 align:start position:0%
um are people more apt to get the
 
04:02:28.309 --> 04:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
treatment perhaps that they need inside
 
04:02:31.250 --> 04:02:31.260 align:start position:0%
a facility and get into a program that's
 
04:02:33.469 --> 04:02:33.479 align:start position:0%
more structured whether we have their
 
04:02:33.479 --> 04:02:34.550 align:start position:0%
more structured whether we have their
attention

04:02:34.550 --> 04:02:34.560 align:start position:0%
attention
 
04:02:36.590 --> 04:02:36.600 align:start position:0%
I would say there's an argument in favor
 
04:02:39.530 --> 04:02:39.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:41.330 --> 04:02:41.340 align:start position:0%
I'm glad to have a conversation with you
 
04:02:43.670 --> 04:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
after sir absolutely representative
 
04:02:43.680 --> 04:02:48.050 align:start position:0%
after sir absolutely representative
Newman

04:02:48.050 --> 04:02:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:49.969 --> 04:02:49.979 align:start position:0%
I have a question that's a little maybe
 
04:02:52.670 --> 04:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
along the same lines it looks like from
 
04:02:56.050 --> 04:02:56.060 align:start position:0%
my reading of the bill that the current
 
04:02:59.570 --> 04:02:59.580 align:start position:0%
punishment is a class B felony
 
04:03:02.210 --> 04:03:02.220 align:start position:0%
and then the bill reduces it to a
 
04:03:05.750 --> 04:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor for the first offense
 
04:03:08.210 --> 04:03:08.220 align:start position:0%
um and the second and the other
 
04:03:10.729 --> 04:03:10.739 align:start position:0%
punishment is Class A going to a class B
 
04:03:10.739 --> 04:03:13.210 align:start position:0%
punishment is Class A going to a class B
felony

04:03:13.210 --> 04:03:13.220 align:start position:0%
felony
 
04:03:16.969 --> 04:03:16.979 align:start position:0%
since the class A misdemeanor has the
 
04:03:19.490 --> 04:03:19.500 align:start position:0%
possibility of a year in jail
 
04:03:22.429 --> 04:03:22.439 align:start position:0%
why would that be an improvement to the
 
04:03:24.290 --> 04:03:24.300 align:start position:0%
bill rather than going all the way to a
 
04:03:26.269 --> 04:03:26.279 align:start position:0%
class B felony which is three to seven
 
04:03:26.279 --> 04:03:27.469 align:start position:0%
class B felony which is three to seven
years

04:03:27.469 --> 04:03:27.479 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:03:30.170 --> 04:03:30.180 align:start position:0%
and it may there may be something in
 
04:03:32.030 --> 04:03:32.040 align:start position:0%
there in the court process where one or
 
04:03:35.150 --> 04:03:35.160 align:start position:0%
the other gets prosecuted more often or
 
04:03:38.090 --> 04:03:38.100 align:start position:0%
or leads the way to maybe
 
04:03:38.100 --> 04:03:38.630 align:start position:0%
or leads the way to maybe
um

04:03:38.630 --> 04:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:40.790 --> 04:03:40.800 align:start position:0%
coming up with a plea deal or something
 
04:03:43.429 --> 04:03:43.439 align:start position:0%
like that I'm just wondering why why go
 
04:03:45.650 --> 04:03:45.660 align:start position:0%
all the way to a
 
04:03:47.269 --> 04:03:47.279 align:start position:0%
just why not
 
04:03:49.969 --> 04:03:49.979 align:start position:0%
um would it be helpful as if it was a
 
04:03:53.450 --> 04:03:53.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:55.790 --> 04:03:55.800 align:start position:0%
you're saying that
 
04:03:57.650 --> 04:03:57.660 align:start position:0%
in your opinion and somebody's convicted
 
04:04:00.110 --> 04:04:00.120 align:start position:0%
of first offense misdemean Class A that
 
04:04:02.450 --> 04:04:02.460 align:start position:0%
they got to get that year in jail
 
04:04:04.070 --> 04:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty confident that they're not
 
04:04:05.929 --> 04:04:05.939 align:start position:0%
going to get that year in jail that's
 
04:04:07.610 --> 04:04:07.620 align:start position:0%
the reality of our court system right
 
04:04:07.620 --> 04:04:08.450 align:start position:0%
the reality of our court system right
now

04:04:08.450 --> 04:04:08.460 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:04:11.269 --> 04:04:11.279 align:start position:0%
I have people that are
 
04:04:11.279 --> 04:04:11.809 align:start position:0%
I have people that are
um

04:04:11.809 --> 04:04:11.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:13.870 --> 04:04:13.880 align:start position:0%
committing crimes over and over and over
 
04:04:16.790 --> 04:04:16.800 align:start position:0%
and are not getting the appropriate
 
04:04:20.030 --> 04:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
sentence that they should that's not my
 
04:04:22.670 --> 04:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
my doing or my decision we put forward
 
04:04:25.910 --> 04:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
cases but unfortunately what we live in
 
04:04:28.429 --> 04:04:28.439 align:start position:0%
now is that people aren't getting the
 
04:04:30.290 --> 04:04:30.300 align:start position:0%
appropriate sentences in some cases that
 
04:04:32.929 --> 04:04:32.939 align:start position:0%
they deserve and that's why we have
 
04:04:35.570 --> 04:04:35.580 align:start position:0%
these repeat offenders to the detector's
 
04:04:37.969 --> 04:04:37.979 align:start position:0%
point if you make these misdemeanor
 
04:04:40.130 --> 04:04:40.140 align:start position:0%
level offenses the the drug
 
04:04:41.990 --> 04:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
organizations these cartel level
 
04:04:43.969 --> 04:04:43.979 align:start position:0%
organizations are going to flood this
 
04:04:43.979 --> 04:04:44.870 align:start position:0%
organizations are going to flood this
state

04:04:44.870 --> 04:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:04:46.849 --> 04:04:46.859 align:start position:0%
okay because they are more than they
 
04:04:47.870 --> 04:04:47.880 align:start position:0%
already do
 
04:04:51.349 --> 04:04:51.359 align:start position:0%
because they know that they are now
 
04:04:55.309 --> 04:04:55.319 align:start position:0%
operating in a state with a penalty for
 
04:04:58.309 --> 04:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
spreading this poison in our state and
 
04:04:59.870 --> 04:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
killing people
 
04:05:01.910 --> 04:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
um for those that are in possession of
 
04:05:04.250 --> 04:05:04.260 align:start position:0%
it there are going to have minimal to no
 
04:05:04.260 --> 04:05:05.990 align:start position:0%
it there are going to have minimal to no
ramifications

04:05:05.990 --> 04:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
ramifications
 
04:05:08.990 --> 04:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
I can quite I
 
04:05:10.969 --> 04:05:10.979 align:start position:0%
would be very
 
04:05:13.490 --> 04:05:13.500 align:start position:0%
you know very confident saying that
 
04:05:15.769 --> 04:05:15.779 align:start position:0%
people on a first offense
 
04:05:18.229 --> 04:05:18.239 align:start position:0%
you know that becomes a misdemeanor
 
04:05:19.309 --> 04:05:19.319 align:start position:0%
level conviction
 
04:05:21.650 --> 04:05:21.660 align:start position:0%
they're not going to go to jail
 
04:05:24.110 --> 04:05:24.120 align:start position:0%
I just know from experience I know from
 
04:05:26.750 --> 04:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
how my court operates how Hillsborough
 
04:05:28.189 --> 04:05:28.199 align:start position:0%
County operates
 
04:05:31.250 --> 04:05:31.260 align:start position:0%
um they may go into drug court okay if
 
04:05:33.290 --> 04:05:33.300 align:start position:0%
drug court was an effective mechanism
 
04:05:35.689 --> 04:05:35.699 align:start position:0%
right now I can speak and tell you that
 
04:05:37.090 --> 04:05:37.100 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
04:05:39.469 --> 04:05:39.479 align:start position:0%
if drug court
 
04:05:41.689 --> 04:05:41.699 align:start position:0%
was better in operating more efficiently
 
04:05:43.790 --> 04:05:43.800 align:start position:0%
than maybe that's a better option for
 
04:05:45.349 --> 04:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
those people to have that first offense
 
04:05:49.010 --> 04:05:49.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:53.929 --> 04:05:53.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:57.110 --> 04:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
representative scitec I'd like to thank
 
04:05:59.750 --> 04:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
you for appearing Chief the I want to
 
04:06:02.150 --> 04:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
follow up on what I had asked before you
 
04:06:03.969 --> 04:06:03.979 align:start position:0%
said very few
 
04:06:07.429 --> 04:06:07.439 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors get actual jail time that's
 
04:06:09.650 --> 04:06:09.660 align:start position:0%
the way our court system is I understand
 
04:06:12.170 --> 04:06:12.180 align:start position:0%
that earlier today I said I'm a bail
 
04:06:13.849 --> 04:06:13.859 align:start position:0%
commissioner I kind of have an idea of
 
04:06:15.650 --> 04:06:15.660 align:start position:0%
what you're talking about
 
04:06:19.250 --> 04:06:19.260 align:start position:0%
my question is this what happens in a
 
04:06:21.889 --> 04:06:21.899 align:start position:0%
felony conviction class B felony
 
04:06:24.950 --> 04:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
conviction what is the likely sentence
 
04:06:27.650 --> 04:06:27.660 align:start position:0%
further experience first offense First
 
04:06:29.090 --> 04:06:29.100 align:start position:0%
Defense yes
 
04:06:31.729 --> 04:06:31.739 align:start position:0%
depends on a lot of things go into play
 
04:06:33.650 --> 04:06:33.660 align:start position:0%
there the person's overall criminal
 
04:06:33.660 --> 04:06:35.030 align:start position:0%
there the person's overall criminal
record

04:06:35.030 --> 04:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
record
 
04:06:37.550 --> 04:06:37.560 align:start position:0%
um if you take a case where it's a first
 
04:06:39.469 --> 04:06:39.479 align:start position:0%
offense Class A and they have no other
 
04:06:41.809 --> 04:06:41.819 align:start position:0%
criminal record I would say that the
 
04:06:43.309 --> 04:06:43.319 align:start position:0%
likelihood of them going to prison is
 
04:06:44.630 --> 04:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
probably relatively well they're
 
04:06:45.769 --> 04:06:45.779 align:start position:0%
probably looking at some type of
 
04:06:45.779 --> 04:06:46.910 align:start position:0%
probably looking at some type of
extensive

04:06:46.910 --> 04:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
extensive
 
04:06:46.920 --> 04:06:48.309 align:start position:0%
extensive
probation

04:06:48.309 --> 04:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
probation
 
04:06:51.830 --> 04:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
drug court some other residential
 
04:06:53.950 --> 04:06:53.960 align:start position:0%
program is part of a plea deal
 
04:06:57.469 --> 04:06:57.479 align:start position:0%
but he got there's a lot of a lot of
 
04:06:59.630 --> 04:06:59.640 align:start position:0%
variables that go into determining
 
04:07:01.969 --> 04:07:01.979 align:start position:0%
somebody's sentence when it gets to a
 
04:07:09.050 --> 04:07:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:10.849 --> 04:07:10.859 align:start position:0%
further questions thank you we
 
04:07:14.090 --> 04:07:14.100 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time thank you
 
04:07:23.090 --> 04:07:23.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:25.490 --> 04:07:25.500 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my testimony I'm
 
04:07:27.290 --> 04:07:27.300 align:start position:0%
representative Kerry Roy representing
 
04:07:29.450 --> 04:07:29.460 align:start position:0%
Rockingham District 31 towns of
 
04:07:31.269 --> 04:07:31.279 align:start position:0%
Deerfield Candia
 
04:07:33.530 --> 04:07:33.540 align:start position:0%
Auburn and Chester have to get that
 
04:07:36.590 --> 04:07:36.600 align:start position:0%
right they changed with the redistrict
 
04:07:38.570 --> 04:07:38.580 align:start position:0%
um I apologize for not being here for
 
04:07:40.429 --> 04:07:40.439 align:start position:0%
the opening of this unfortunately I
 
04:07:41.870 --> 04:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
realized having the chair position
 
04:07:43.729 --> 04:07:43.739 align:start position:0%
everybody wants to talk to you and I got
 
04:07:46.309 --> 04:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
way laid six times on the way back here
 
04:07:49.610 --> 04:07:49.620 align:start position:0%
um so with regard to this bill
 
04:07:51.469 --> 04:07:51.479 align:start position:0%
I understand law enforcement's position
 
04:07:53.570 --> 04:07:53.580 align:start position:0%
and I agree with them a lot that it's a
 
04:07:55.429 --> 04:07:55.439 align:start position:0%
valuable tool
 
04:07:57.530 --> 04:07:57.540 align:start position:0%
to have in your Arsenal to be able to
 
04:07:58.910 --> 04:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
charge someone with a felony on the
 
04:08:00.229 --> 04:08:00.239 align:start position:0%
first offense
 
04:08:02.570 --> 04:08:02.580 align:start position:0%
I disagree with them and that's how we
 
04:08:05.570 --> 04:08:05.580 align:start position:0%
should be operating our justice system
 
04:08:08.389 --> 04:08:08.399 align:start position:0%
we should not be creating felons in my
 
04:08:08.399 --> 04:08:09.469 align:start position:0%
we should not be creating felons in my
opinion

04:08:09.469 --> 04:08:09.479 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
04:08:13.130 --> 04:08:13.140 align:start position:0%
out of so many people for first offense
 
04:08:17.269 --> 04:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
on this and that the the drug
 
04:08:19.729 --> 04:08:19.739 align:start position:0%
crime has not gone down with the
 
04:08:19.739 --> 04:08:20.809 align:start position:0%
crime has not gone down with the
felonies

04:08:20.809 --> 04:08:20.819 align:start position:0%
felonies
 
04:08:24.290 --> 04:08:24.300 align:start position:0%
it stays the same it seems to really not
 
04:08:26.510 --> 04:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
matter what it is but what does happen
 
04:08:28.189 --> 04:08:28.199 align:start position:0%
is we've created a whole bunch of people
 
04:08:30.010 --> 04:08:30.020 align:start position:0%
that were putting out of the labor pool
 
04:08:31.969 --> 04:08:31.979 align:start position:0%
when you have a felony conviction
 
04:08:34.490 --> 04:08:34.500 align:start position:0%
there's a whole slew of jobs you cannot
 
04:08:34.500 --> 04:08:35.870 align:start position:0%
there's a whole slew of jobs you cannot
get

04:08:35.870 --> 04:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
get
 
04:08:39.110 --> 04:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
um and and it does we can discuss the
 
04:08:41.150 --> 04:08:41.160 align:start position:0%
whys and hows but it does
 
04:08:43.250 --> 04:08:43.260 align:start position:0%
disproportionately affect minority
 
04:08:43.260 --> 04:08:44.349 align:start position:0%
disproportionately affect minority
communities

04:08:44.349 --> 04:08:44.359 align:start position:0%
communities
 
04:08:46.429 --> 04:08:46.439 align:start position:0%
and these are the people who have the
 
04:08:48.410 --> 04:08:48.420 align:start position:0%
lowest unemployment rates to begin with
 
04:08:50.870 --> 04:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
the highest unemployment rates excuse me
 
04:08:52.610 --> 04:08:52.620 align:start position:0%
I think that we need to look at a
 
04:08:54.650 --> 04:08:54.660 align:start position:0%
different way to do this a different way
 
04:08:57.469 --> 04:08:57.479 align:start position:0%
of interdicting drugs we need to give
 
04:08:59.389 --> 04:08:59.399 align:start position:0%
the police the tools they needed to stop
 
04:09:00.950 --> 04:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
the drugs coming into our communities
 
04:09:02.990 --> 04:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
more than punishing the people who get
 
04:09:05.269 --> 04:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
caught with with the first offense
 
04:09:08.389 --> 04:09:08.399 align:start position:0%
amount and let's be clear as far as what
 
04:09:09.530 --> 04:09:09.540 align:start position:0%
that means
 
04:09:12.769 --> 04:09:12.779 align:start position:0%
you're still if the amount is correct
 
04:09:14.030 --> 04:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
you're still going to get charged with
 
04:09:16.610 --> 04:09:16.620 align:start position:0%
possession intent or with distribution
 
04:09:19.070 --> 04:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
or with drug kingpin depending on the
 
04:09:20.870 --> 04:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
amount of drugs you have we're talking
 
04:09:22.849 --> 04:09:22.859 align:start position:0%
about simple possession
 
04:09:25.490 --> 04:09:25.500 align:start position:0%
now I believe we need to tweak the
 
04:09:27.050 --> 04:09:27.060 align:start position:0%
amounts on certain things like fentanyl
 
04:09:29.030 --> 04:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
should be much smaller
 
04:09:31.250 --> 04:09:31.260 align:start position:0%
but the other drugs you're talking about
 
04:09:33.469 --> 04:09:33.479 align:start position:0%
a personal use amount of drugs not
 
04:09:35.510 --> 04:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
enough to sell not enough to distribute
 
04:09:37.490 --> 04:09:37.500 align:start position:0%
personal use
 
04:09:39.530 --> 04:09:39.540 align:start position:0%
and there's a big difference in my
 
04:09:41.990 --> 04:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
opinion someone who is using
 
04:09:44.330 --> 04:09:44.340 align:start position:0%
they're hurting themselves but they're
 
04:09:46.389 --> 04:09:46.399 align:start position:0%
not Distributing
 
04:09:46.399 --> 04:09:48.229 align:start position:0%
not Distributing
and

04:09:48.229 --> 04:09:48.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:09:52.070 --> 04:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
a misdemeanor crime conviction is no
 
04:09:54.349 --> 04:09:54.359 align:start position:0%
small thing there are there are
 
04:09:56.290 --> 04:09:56.300 align:start position:0%
penalties there's jail time possibility
 
04:10:00.590 --> 04:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
there's Financial possibilities it's
 
04:10:02.330 --> 04:10:02.340 align:start position:0%
still a very serious thing to happen to
 
04:10:02.340 --> 04:10:03.110 align:start position:0%
still a very serious thing to happen to
somebody

04:10:03.110 --> 04:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
04:10:05.269 --> 04:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
so I would ask the committee to consider
 
04:10:07.790 --> 04:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
in way how the current system is working
 
04:10:11.750 --> 04:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
if it's working and if it's not
 
04:10:14.510 --> 04:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
is there a greater benefit in producing
 
04:10:18.290 --> 04:10:18.300 align:start position:0%
less felons in making people have a
 
04:10:20.929 --> 04:10:20.939 align:start position:0%
chance to go forward in society and
 
04:10:23.510 --> 04:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
improve their lives or tagging them as
 
04:10:25.969 --> 04:10:25.979 align:start position:0%
felons and limiting the amount of work
 
04:10:28.250 --> 04:10:28.260 align:start position:0%
and future opportunities in their life
 
04:10:30.590 --> 04:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
which already sets them down a path of
 
04:10:30.600 --> 04:10:31.969 align:start position:0%
which already sets them down a path of
hopelessness

04:10:31.969 --> 04:10:31.979 align:start position:0%
hopelessness
 
04:10:33.889 --> 04:10:33.899 align:start position:0%
so that that's my testimony I'd be happy
 
04:10:35.750 --> 04:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
to take questions
 
04:10:39.410 --> 04:10:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:41.210 --> 04:10:41.220 align:start position:0%
the vice chair and thank you for taking
 
04:10:42.469 --> 04:10:42.479 align:start position:0%
my question
 
04:10:45.830 --> 04:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
I noticed that uh on the first offense
 
04:10:47.870 --> 04:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
you're proposing a change at class B
 
04:10:51.229 --> 04:10:51.239 align:start position:0%
felony to a misdemeanor and my question
 
04:10:54.530 --> 04:10:54.540 align:start position:0%
to you is this misdemeanor a is uh
 
04:10:57.410 --> 04:10:57.420 align:start position:0%
potential of jail time and the right to
 
04:11:00.650 --> 04:11:00.660 align:start position:0%
council misdemeanor B has no right to
 
04:11:05.110 --> 04:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
counsel and is fine only would you
 
04:11:07.189 --> 04:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
would you
 
04:11:09.110 --> 04:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
have any
 
04:11:11.210 --> 04:11:11.220 align:start position:0%
thoughts on whether it should be a
 
04:11:13.790 --> 04:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor A or B and why did you
 
04:11:17.450 --> 04:11:17.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:20.030 --> 04:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
if I heard you correctly whether or not
 
04:11:22.729 --> 04:11:22.739 align:start position:0%
I would be open to either level of
 
04:11:24.830 --> 04:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor and and possibly because it
 
04:11:26.510 --> 04:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't give a right to counsel is that
 
04:11:28.130 --> 04:11:28.140 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
04:11:31.429 --> 04:11:31.439 align:start position:0%
yeah a misdemeanor a uh affords you a
 
04:11:33.410 --> 04:11:33.420 align:start position:0%
right to counsel a misdemeanor B does
 
04:11:33.420 --> 04:11:34.689 align:start position:0%
right to counsel a misdemeanor B does
not

04:11:34.689 --> 04:11:34.699 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:11:38.630 --> 04:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
agreed but I don't think that charging
 
04:11:41.090 --> 04:11:41.100 align:start position:0%
someone with a higher level offense just
 
04:11:43.250 --> 04:11:43.260 align:start position:0%
so they can get right to counsel is
 
04:11:46.010 --> 04:11:46.020 align:start position:0%
probably a a good policy I'm not I'm not
 
04:11:48.710 --> 04:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
sure understandably that they they need
 
04:11:51.769 --> 04:11:51.779 align:start position:0%
counsel regardless of the level but I
 
04:11:53.830 --> 04:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
don't think that we can solve that by by
 
04:11:56.510 --> 04:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
charging up just so they get counsel I
 
04:11:59.210 --> 04:11:59.220 align:start position:0%
just I would worry about that
 
04:12:01.309 --> 04:12:01.319 align:start position:0%
but as the father whether or not the
 
04:12:02.809 --> 04:12:02.819 align:start position:0%
penalty is appropriate that's something
 
04:12:04.729 --> 04:12:04.739 align:start position:0%
that we can discuss and I'd be happy to
 
04:12:06.410 --> 04:12:06.420 align:start position:0%
discuss with everyone when we're
 
04:12:08.150 --> 04:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
debating this issue in the executive
 
04:12:08.160 --> 04:12:12.710 align:start position:0%
debating this issue in the executive
session

04:12:12.710 --> 04:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:12.720 --> 04:12:14.030 align:start position:0%
 
no

04:12:14.030 --> 04:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:12:15.469 --> 04:12:15.479 align:start position:0%
see no further questions thank you
 
04:12:22.189 --> 04:12:22.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:26.630 --> 04:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:28.490 --> 04:12:28.500 align:start position:0%
oh representative I'm sorry yeah that's
 
04:12:31.189 --> 04:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
okay I don't think it's on here in my
 
04:12:31.199 --> 04:12:32.150 align:start position:0%
okay I don't think it's on here in my
defense

04:12:32.150 --> 04:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
defense
 
04:12:34.849 --> 04:12:34.859 align:start position:0%
yeah I will fix my future
 
04:12:37.610 --> 04:12:37.620 align:start position:0%
um thank you Dan Hines representing
 
04:12:39.530 --> 04:12:39.540 align:start position:0%
um Hillsboro 2 kind of Bedford and
 
04:12:41.630 --> 04:12:41.640 align:start position:0%
obviously support this bill and I don't
 
04:12:43.910 --> 04:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
want to be redundant but I think people
 
04:12:45.229 --> 04:12:45.239 align:start position:0%
are in agreement and a lot of people ask
 
04:12:47.990 --> 04:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
well what's the penalty for this so my
 
04:12:49.550 --> 04:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
way background criminal defense lawyer
 
04:12:51.530 --> 04:12:51.540 align:start position:0%
have handled drug possession cases over
 
04:12:54.050 --> 04:12:54.060 align:start position:0%
the years and so
 
04:12:56.389 --> 04:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it's not very consistent
 
04:12:57.769 --> 04:12:57.779 align:start position:0%
in my opinion throughout the state so
 
04:12:59.570 --> 04:12:59.580 align:start position:0%
many County attorneys will routinely
 
04:13:01.189 --> 04:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
drop these down to misdemeanors but
 
04:13:03.349 --> 04:13:03.359 align:start position:0%
others will not at the end of the day if
 
04:13:05.150 --> 04:13:05.160 align:start position:0%
someone has a simple possession of
 
04:13:07.969 --> 04:13:07.979 align:start position:0%
cocaine that heroin any of these felony
 
04:13:10.010 --> 04:13:10.020 align:start position:0%
type drugs they have no criminal record
 
04:13:12.889 --> 04:13:12.899 align:start position:0%
nothing else I don't see even if they
 
04:13:14.269 --> 04:13:14.279 align:start position:0%
went to a jury trial and were found
 
04:13:16.370 --> 04:13:16.380 align:start position:0%
guilty I do not see a judge sentencing
 
04:13:19.370 --> 04:13:19.380 align:start position:0%
that person in prison routinely people
 
04:13:22.309 --> 04:13:22.319 align:start position:0%
get in my experience I think if there's
 
04:13:23.929 --> 04:13:23.939 align:start position:0%
nothing else people get House of
 
04:13:26.030 --> 04:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
Correction time which is jail which can
 
04:13:27.769 --> 04:13:27.779 align:start position:0%
only be up to 12 months which would make
 
04:13:29.990 --> 04:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
it a misdemeanor level penalty
 
04:13:32.330 --> 04:13:32.340 align:start position:0%
and oftentimes that's all suspended if
 
04:13:34.670 --> 04:13:34.680 align:start position:0%
it were a plea often there's conditions
 
04:13:38.210 --> 04:13:38.220 align:start position:0%
with that so it could be to be on
 
04:13:41.689 --> 04:13:41.699 align:start position:0%
probation or it could be drug counseling
 
04:13:43.370 --> 04:13:43.380 align:start position:0%
things to that effect at the end of the
 
04:13:45.290 --> 04:13:45.300 align:start position:0%
day people are not going to prison for
 
04:13:48.170 --> 04:13:48.180 align:start position:0%
first offense possession charges um
 
04:13:50.030 --> 04:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
unless they were sentenced on something
 
04:13:51.349 --> 04:13:51.359 align:start position:0%
else like that or something like that
 
04:13:54.050 --> 04:13:54.060 align:start position:0%
all this is doing with the making it a
 
04:13:56.269 --> 04:13:56.279 align:start position:0%
felony is making them have a felon
 
04:13:58.370 --> 04:13:58.380 align:start position:0%
criminal record what that is doing is
 
04:14:00.050 --> 04:14:00.060 align:start position:0%
presenting that preventing them from
 
04:14:02.630 --> 04:14:02.640 align:start position:0%
obtaining employment in the future I
 
04:14:04.130 --> 04:14:04.140 align:start position:0%
think personally the best way to address
 
04:14:07.849 --> 04:14:07.859 align:start position:0%
the drug problem is Rehabilitation I
 
04:14:10.010 --> 04:14:10.020 align:start position:0%
think people use drugs fall into two
 
04:14:12.349 --> 04:14:12.359 align:start position:0%
classes people who are addicted to it
 
04:14:16.010 --> 04:14:16.020 align:start position:0%
and people who recreationally use it for
 
04:14:16.969 --> 04:14:16.979 align:start position:0%
both of those people I think
 
04:14:18.650 --> 04:14:18.660 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation is still the best
 
04:14:21.050 --> 04:14:21.060 align:start position:0%
approach but punishment just does not
 
04:14:24.050 --> 04:14:24.060 align:start position:0%
work people are not being sent to prison
 
04:14:26.750 --> 04:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
for up to seven years on these types of
 
04:14:30.710 --> 04:14:30.720 align:start position:0%
charges so it's already not happening
 
04:14:30.720 --> 04:14:31.429 align:start position:0%
charges so it's already not happening
um

04:14:31.429 --> 04:14:31.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:33.290 --> 04:14:33.300 align:start position:0%
I think the position that this would
 
04:14:36.469 --> 04:14:36.479 align:start position:0%
invite drug cartels to the state is
 
04:14:38.870 --> 04:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
borderline absurd I certainly don't
 
04:14:40.429 --> 04:14:40.439 align:start position:0%
think it will happen
 
04:14:42.410 --> 04:14:42.420 align:start position:0%
um because this is only applying to
 
04:14:43.910 --> 04:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
people possessing because not applying
 
04:14:45.590 --> 04:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
to people Distributing drug cartels
 
04:14:47.809 --> 04:14:47.819 align:start position:0%
cannot come in if this bill were to take
 
04:14:50.150 --> 04:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
laws and say Here Sell some drugs you'll
 
04:14:51.530 --> 04:14:51.540 align:start position:0%
only have a mismir not going to happen
 
04:14:53.689 --> 04:14:53.699 align:start position:0%
there's still going to be a facing
 
04:14:56.570 --> 04:14:56.580 align:start position:0%
felony selling or distribution penalties
 
04:14:58.729 --> 04:14:58.739 align:start position:0%
I do not think anyone who goes out
 
04:15:00.469 --> 04:15:00.479 align:start position:0%
seeking for drugs in the back of their
 
04:15:01.969 --> 04:15:01.979 align:start position:0%
mind goes well I don't want to do that
 
04:15:04.189 --> 04:15:04.199 align:start position:0%
it's a felony but ah it's missed me let
 
04:15:05.750 --> 04:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
me have some of that drugs it just
 
04:15:09.530 --> 04:15:09.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:12.110 --> 04:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
uh in regards to difference between our
 
04:15:13.910 --> 04:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
representative jamprin's question abris
 
04:15:13.920 --> 04:15:14.750 align:start position:0%
representative jamprin's question abris
b

04:15:14.750 --> 04:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
b
 
04:15:17.750 --> 04:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
um the reason I was supported being not
 
04:15:20.090 --> 04:15:20.100 align:start position:0%
defined is most of our criminal code
 
04:15:21.650 --> 04:15:21.660 align:start position:0%
doesn't Define things there are a few
 
04:15:23.750 --> 04:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
exceptions so DWI First Defense is a
 
04:15:25.849 --> 04:15:25.859 align:start position:0%
Class B the reason being as you point
 
04:15:27.710 --> 04:15:27.720 align:start position:0%
out people don't get counsel
 
04:15:30.590 --> 04:15:30.600 align:start position:0%
um some chart charges are specifically a
 
04:15:32.750 --> 04:15:32.760 align:start position:0%
particularly if they have a penalty
 
04:15:34.309 --> 04:15:34.319 align:start position:0%
associated with it with mandatory jail
 
04:15:35.929 --> 04:15:35.939 align:start position:0%
time they would have to be but I think
 
04:15:37.910 --> 04:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
leaving it just a blank misdemeanor that
 
04:15:40.070 --> 04:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
leaves the prosecution discretion to
 
04:15:41.990 --> 04:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
bring it as an ARB which I think makes
 
04:15:43.729 --> 04:15:43.739 align:start position:0%
sense I don't think all drug charges are
 
04:15:45.729 --> 04:15:45.739 align:start position:0%
the same so there's a difference between
 
04:15:48.950 --> 04:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
someone who has I guess just
 
04:15:51.110 --> 04:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
small amount of cocaine or heroin and
 
04:15:53.389 --> 04:15:53.399 align:start position:0%
that's it versus someone who is doing
 
04:15:54.950 --> 04:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
that coming thefts all types of other
 
04:15:56.689 --> 04:15:56.699 align:start position:0%
things so I I think it should be up to
 
04:15:58.189 --> 04:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
the prosecutor whether to bring it as an
 
04:16:00.889 --> 04:16:00.899 align:start position:0%
A or B in that regard
 
04:16:00.899 --> 04:16:05.750 align:start position:0%
A or B in that regard
um

04:16:05.750 --> 04:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:07.429 --> 04:16:07.439 align:start position:0%
I think there's any everything I'm happy
 
04:16:12.530 --> 04:16:12.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:15.349 --> 04:16:15.359 align:start position:0%
representative chandron
 
04:16:17.389 --> 04:16:17.399 align:start position:0%
thank you and it's Unique that you're an
 
04:16:19.969 --> 04:16:19.979 align:start position:0%
attorney that defends cases in this
 
04:16:23.809 --> 04:16:23.819 align:start position:0%
matter so my question to you would be on
 
04:16:27.469 --> 04:16:27.479 align:start position:0%
average how many of these cases that are
 
04:16:28.910 --> 04:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
covered by this bill are actually
 
04:16:32.090 --> 04:16:32.100 align:start position:0%
deferred to the drug court
 
04:16:34.010 --> 04:16:34.020 align:start position:0%
so I don't know the answer that I know
 
04:16:35.389 --> 04:16:35.399 align:start position:0%
we've been expanding the drug courts
 
04:16:36.469 --> 04:16:36.479 align:start position:0%
over the years and I'm certainly
 
04:16:37.969 --> 04:16:37.979 align:start position:0%
supportive of that do you think that is
 
04:16:40.370 --> 04:16:40.380 align:start position:0%
one of the best ways to go about
 
04:16:42.950 --> 04:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
addressing this issue and I don't know
 
04:16:44.630 --> 04:16:44.640 align:start position:0%
if there's a uniform policy throughout
 
04:16:46.790 --> 04:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
drug courts and counties of what happens
 
04:16:48.530 --> 04:16:48.540 align:start position:0%
after the fact
 
04:16:50.990 --> 04:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
um but they do it do it a little
 
04:16:53.389 --> 04:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
differently so or I'm not sure if they
 
04:16:56.210 --> 04:16:56.220 align:start position:0%
all do it exactly the same as well but
 
04:16:58.070 --> 04:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
there are cases that just don't go to
 
04:16:59.870 --> 04:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
drug courts so they do have I guess
 
04:17:01.910 --> 04:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
typically requirements to get into that
 
04:17:05.809 --> 04:17:05.819 align:start position:0%
court so if this fell outside of that
 
04:17:08.650 --> 04:17:08.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:11.689 --> 04:17:11.699 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate then for those offenses
 
04:17:19.490 --> 04:17:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:20.929 --> 04:17:20.939 align:start position:0%
so you know further questions thank you
 
04:17:23.870 --> 04:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:44.630 --> 04:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:46.070 --> 04:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
Madam chair members of the committee
 
04:17:47.450 --> 04:17:47.460 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for the opportunity to
 
04:17:49.130 --> 04:17:49.140 align:start position:0%
testify my name is Frank Knack I'm the
 
04:17:51.110 --> 04:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
policy director with the ACLU of New
 
04:17:52.490 --> 04:17:52.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we are here in strong
 
04:17:58.670 --> 04:17:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:02.030 --> 04:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
so I want to talk at first about
 
04:18:04.010 --> 04:18:04.020 align:start position:0%
um a couple of issues I think one we
 
04:18:05.330 --> 04:18:05.340 align:start position:0%
talked that we heard a little bit about
 
04:18:07.610 --> 04:18:07.620 align:start position:0%
the need to have prison as a punishment
 
04:18:09.469 --> 04:18:09.479 align:start position:0%
and just to give some economics here it
 
04:18:13.010 --> 04:18:13.020 align:start position:0%
costs about 64 000 a year to incarcerate
 
04:18:15.530 --> 04:18:15.540 align:start position:0%
someone in our prison uh substantially
 
04:18:17.090 --> 04:18:17.100 align:start position:0%
cheaper to actually engage in
 
04:18:19.070 --> 04:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
evidence-based harm reduction programs
 
04:18:21.170 --> 04:18:21.180 align:start position:0%
at the local level and fortunately there
 
04:18:22.849 --> 04:18:22.859 align:start position:0%
are multiple bills before this committee
 
04:18:25.130 --> 04:18:25.140 align:start position:0%
and this this body this session around
 
04:18:27.530 --> 04:18:27.540 align:start position:0%
access to drug testing kits we already
 
04:18:29.090 --> 04:18:29.100 align:start position:0%
have naloxone those are proven
 
04:18:31.010 --> 04:18:31.020 align:start position:0%
evidence-based strategies if you really
 
04:18:32.630 --> 04:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
care about saving lives and reducing
 
04:18:35.990 --> 04:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:37.670 --> 04:18:37.680 align:start position:0%
um I think it's also really important to
 
04:18:39.889 --> 04:18:39.899 align:start position:0%
point out you know when we think about
 
04:18:41.929 --> 04:18:41.939 align:start position:0%
drug arrests we think about you know we
 
04:18:43.910 --> 04:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
are going after dealers and that is just
 
04:18:45.769 --> 04:18:45.779 align:start position:0%
fundamentally not the case here in New
 
04:18:48.830 --> 04:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so again if in the fact sheet
 
04:18:50.689 --> 04:18:50.699 align:start position:0%
I handed out we have the data to show
 
04:18:53.450 --> 04:18:53.460 align:start position:0%
you we looked at FBI UCR data reports
 
04:18:55.309 --> 04:18:55.319 align:start position:0%
that our state agencies provide to the
 
04:18:55.319 --> 04:18:56.510 align:start position:0%
that our state agencies provide to the
FBI

04:18:56.510 --> 04:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
FBI
 
04:18:59.929 --> 04:18:59.939 align:start position:0%
and out of the five three thousand five
 
04:19:02.510 --> 04:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
hundred ninety two drug arrests in 2021
 
04:19:07.250 --> 04:19:07.260 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire 87 so 3150 were Premier
 
04:19:09.769 --> 04:19:09.779 align:start position:0%
possession so the vast majority of
 
04:19:11.510 --> 04:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
arrests happening in our state right now
 
04:19:14.330 --> 04:19:14.340 align:start position:0%
are for possession level offenses
 
04:19:16.309 --> 04:19:16.319 align:start position:0%
um in that possession level disparity is
 
04:19:17.929 --> 04:19:17.939 align:start position:0%
actually increased so over the 10-year
 
04:19:19.610 --> 04:19:19.620 align:start position:0%
period it was 80 so we're actually going
 
04:19:21.229 --> 04:19:21.239 align:start position:0%
in the wrong direction we're arresting
 
04:19:23.630 --> 04:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
more people for simple possession
 
04:19:26.809 --> 04:19:26.819 align:start position:0%
um and not uh for distribution
 
04:19:28.910 --> 04:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
um we also heard a little bit about the
 
04:19:31.429 --> 04:19:31.439 align:start position:0%
enormous collateral consequences that
 
04:19:33.290 --> 04:19:33.300 align:start position:0%
attach to a felony conviction and I just
 
04:19:35.570 --> 04:19:35.580 align:start position:0%
quickly looked up so we have you know
 
04:19:37.729 --> 04:19:37.739 align:start position:0%
all types of collateral consequences
 
04:19:39.530 --> 04:19:39.540 align:start position:0%
um under our law some are mandatory some
 
04:19:41.389 --> 04:19:41.399 align:start position:0%
are discretionary some are by defense
 
04:19:43.910 --> 04:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
type so I just pulled mandatory
 
04:19:47.570 --> 04:19:47.580 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor and mandatory felony so for
 
04:19:49.790 --> 04:19:49.800 align:start position:0%
mandatory felony collateral consequences
 
04:19:52.010 --> 04:19:52.020 align:start position:0%
under New Hampshire law that apply to
 
04:19:53.870 --> 04:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
all aspects you know from education to
 
04:19:57.889 --> 04:19:57.899 align:start position:0%
housing to employment there are 335
 
04:20:00.530 --> 04:20:00.540 align:start position:0%
various collateral consequences that
 
04:20:03.050 --> 04:20:03.060 align:start position:0%
attach to every felony conviction in New
 
04:20:05.389 --> 04:20:05.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for a misdemeanor it's still
 
04:20:08.389 --> 04:20:08.399 align:start position:0%
extremely high at 99 but substantially
 
04:20:10.790 --> 04:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
fewer and so this notion that you know
 
04:20:12.710 --> 04:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
going from a felony to a misdemeanor for
 
04:20:14.330 --> 04:20:14.340 align:start position:0%
we're only talking about first time
 
04:20:16.790 --> 04:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
possession here we're talking about one
 
04:20:19.550 --> 04:20:19.560 align:start position:0%
narrow type of rest here it's still
 
04:20:21.769 --> 04:20:21.779 align:start position:0%
substantial is we heard a yield a year
 
04:20:24.309 --> 04:20:24.319 align:start position:0%
potentially in jail 99 mandatory
 
04:20:26.210 --> 04:20:26.220 align:start position:0%
consequences that'll attach to that
 
04:20:29.570 --> 04:20:29.580 align:start position:0%
person so it's still substantial
 
04:20:31.550 --> 04:20:31.560 align:start position:0%
and there's also a huge racial disparity
 
04:20:32.990 --> 04:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
that I think is really important to
 
04:20:34.790 --> 04:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
point out so black people in New
 
04:20:36.889 --> 04:20:36.899 align:start position:0%
Hampshire make up about 1.8 percent of
 
04:20:40.250 --> 04:20:40.260 align:start position:0%
our population yet make up 6.5 percent
 
04:20:42.530 --> 04:20:42.540 align:start position:0%
of all drug arrests so a staggering
 
04:20:44.450 --> 04:20:44.460 align:start position:0%
racial disparity in our drug arrests and
 
04:20:47.150 --> 04:20:47.160 align:start position:0%
so this this legislation will have you
 
04:20:49.429 --> 04:20:49.439 align:start position:0%
know a really positive impact on
 
04:20:52.370 --> 04:20:52.380 align:start position:0%
beginning to address those harms and I
 
04:20:54.110 --> 04:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
think finally we heard this earlier
 
04:20:57.349 --> 04:20:57.359 align:start position:0%
today from one testifier and we also
 
04:20:58.729 --> 04:20:58.739 align:start position:0%
heard this a lot last year in this bill
 
04:20:59.929 --> 04:20:59.939 align:start position:0%
which made it through the house last
 
04:21:02.450 --> 04:21:02.460 align:start position:0%
year went over to the Senate we heard a
 
04:21:04.070 --> 04:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
lot about we need to have harsh
 
04:21:06.050 --> 04:21:06.060 align:start position:0%
punishment because harsh punishments are
 
04:21:08.450 --> 04:21:08.460 align:start position:0%
what work and so you know we are now in
 
04:21:10.610 --> 04:21:10.620 align:start position:0%
our 52nd year I think of the War on
 
04:21:13.610 --> 04:21:13.620 align:start position:0%
Drugs back we started back in 1971 and I
 
04:21:15.050 --> 04:21:15.060 align:start position:0%
think one thing is crystal clear you
 
04:21:16.550 --> 04:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
know the notion that we can arrest our
 
04:21:19.130 --> 04:21:19.140 align:start position:0%
way out of drug use is not supported by
 
04:21:21.830 --> 04:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
reality but yet we continue to go down
 
04:21:24.229 --> 04:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
that path and so I just want to one of
 
04:21:26.269 --> 04:21:26.279 align:start position:0%
the reports I cite in here is from cute
 
04:21:28.269 --> 04:21:28.279 align:start position:0%
charitable trust you know well respected
 
04:21:31.610 --> 04:21:31.620 align:start position:0%
National learning that does research
 
04:21:33.950 --> 04:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
and I'll just read read what they said
 
04:21:37.010 --> 04:21:37.020 align:start position:0%
so they looked at available data from
 
04:21:38.389 --> 04:21:38.399 align:start position:0%
federal and state law enforcement
 
04:21:40.550 --> 04:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
Corrections and health agencies and
 
04:21:42.769 --> 04:21:42.779 align:start position:0%
their analysis found no statistically
 
04:21:45.050 --> 04:21:45.060 align:start position:0%
significant relationship between State
 
04:21:46.790 --> 04:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
drug imprisonment rates and three
 
04:21:48.670 --> 04:21:48.680 align:start position:0%
indicators of State drug problems
 
04:21:51.170 --> 04:21:51.180 align:start position:0%
self-reported drug use drug overdose
 
04:21:54.170 --> 04:21:54.180 align:start position:0%
overdose deaths and drug arrests the
 
04:21:54.180 --> 04:21:55.210 align:start position:0%
overdose deaths and drug arrests the
findings

04:21:55.210 --> 04:21:55.220 align:start position:0%
findings
 
04:21:57.889 --> 04:21:57.899 align:start position:0%
reinforce a large body of Prior research
 
04:21:59.389 --> 04:21:59.399 align:start position:0%
that cast doubt on the theory that
 
04:22:01.670 --> 04:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
stiffer prison terms deter drug misuse
 
04:22:03.590 --> 04:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
distribution and Other Drug law
 
04:22:05.689 --> 04:22:05.699 align:start position:0%
violations the evidence strongly
 
04:22:07.130 --> 04:22:07.140 align:start position:0%
suggests that policy makers should
 
04:22:08.809 --> 04:22:08.819 align:start position:0%
pursue alternative strategies that
 
04:22:11.929 --> 04:22:11.939 align:start position:0%
research show work better and Cost Less
 
04:22:17.750 --> 04:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:20.870 --> 04:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:22.550 --> 04:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
thank you to the chair and thank you for
 
04:22:23.750 --> 04:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:22:25.969 --> 04:22:25.979 align:start position:0%
I'm I find myself in a very unique
 
04:22:28.309 --> 04:22:28.319 align:start position:0%
position where I represent the people of
 
04:22:30.590 --> 04:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
Hampton which includes Hampton Beach
 
04:22:35.210 --> 04:22:35.220 align:start position:0%
and I will tell you that um I believe
 
04:22:37.189 --> 04:22:37.199 align:start position:0%
and and I don't know if you have
 
04:22:39.110 --> 04:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
statistics to this effect because you
 
04:22:42.349 --> 04:22:42.359 align:start position:0%
used all of yours from the FBI zcr but
 
04:22:45.170 --> 04:22:45.180 align:start position:0%
do you have any idea of how many people
 
04:22:49.370 --> 04:22:49.380 align:start position:0%
uh that go to our beaches from from uh
 
04:22:52.429 --> 04:22:52.439 align:start position:0%
state to the South uh that are a
 
04:22:55.429 --> 04:22:55.439 align:start position:0%
minority populations are arrested for
 
04:22:56.929 --> 04:22:56.939 align:start position:0%
drug drug
 
04:22:59.269 --> 04:22:59.279 align:start position:0%
uh possession
 
04:23:02.150 --> 04:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
and and second part of that is
 
04:23:04.189 --> 04:23:04.199 align:start position:0%
do you have any idea how many of those
 
04:23:04.199 --> 04:23:06.110 align:start position:0%
do you have any idea how many of those
people

04:23:06.110 --> 04:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:23:06.120 --> 04:23:07.309 align:start position:0%
people
yep

04:23:07.309 --> 04:23:07.319 align:start position:0%
yep
 
04:23:09.110 --> 04:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
okay I'll let you answer that if you
 
04:23:11.570 --> 04:23:11.580 align:start position:0%
have any idea I I know just state level
 
04:23:15.349 --> 04:23:15.359 align:start position:0%
uh FBI ECR data the racial disparities
 
04:23:16.729 --> 04:23:16.739 align:start position:0%
um in this case and also specific to
 
04:23:18.290 --> 04:23:18.300 align:start position:0%
marijuana as well that I'd be happy to
 
04:23:18.300 --> 04:23:19.309 align:start position:0%
marijuana as well that I'd be happy to
discuss

04:23:19.309 --> 04:23:19.319 align:start position:0%
discuss
 
04:23:21.889 --> 04:23:21.899 align:start position:0%
and a follow-up you guys for follow-up
 
04:23:23.689 --> 04:23:23.699 align:start position:0%
thank you for the recognition for the
 
04:23:25.969 --> 04:23:25.979 align:start position:0%
follow-up and as a follow-up to that my
 
04:23:28.429 --> 04:23:28.439 align:start position:0%
question is how many of these people
 
04:23:29.689 --> 04:23:29.699 align:start position:0%
if it's
 
04:23:32.929 --> 04:23:32.939 align:start position:0%
quoted in the UCR are arrested for
 
04:23:35.870 --> 04:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
another offense in addition to
 
04:23:40.910 --> 04:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
uh possession of drugs that may be a
 
04:23:42.790 --> 04:23:42.800 align:start position:0%
violent crime
 
04:23:45.769 --> 04:23:45.779 align:start position:0%
so my understanding is FBI UCR data is
 
04:23:48.590 --> 04:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
primary primary offense data and so that
 
04:23:50.929 --> 04:23:50.939 align:start position:0%
is the most serious offense so it would
 
04:23:53.929 --> 04:23:53.939 align:start position:0%
have to be some lesser offense if there
 
04:24:01.130 --> 04:24:01.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:02.750 --> 04:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
Senator wheeler
 
04:24:04.670 --> 04:24:04.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you Frank
 
04:24:06.290 --> 04:24:06.300 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
04:24:08.630 --> 04:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
um were the arrests uh uh so out of the
 
04:24:12.290 --> 04:24:12.300 align:start position:0%
3 592 arrests uh drug arrests were the
 
04:24:16.189 --> 04:24:16.199 align:start position:0%
35 100 or 3150 that were for possession
 
04:24:18.769 --> 04:24:18.779 align:start position:0%
where they just for possession or were
 
04:24:20.570 --> 04:24:20.580 align:start position:0%
they including possession
 
04:24:23.090 --> 04:24:23.100 align:start position:0%
so that was the primary offense uh so
 
04:24:24.769 --> 04:24:24.779 align:start position:0%
there may have been other you know
 
04:24:26.750 --> 04:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
lesser offenses included but that was
 
04:24:31.550 --> 04:24:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:31.560 --> 04:24:33.110 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:24:33.110 --> 04:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:24:35.269 --> 04:24:35.279 align:start position:0%
see no further questions thank you thank
 
04:24:37.370 --> 04:24:37.380 align:start position:0%
you so much
 
04:24:45.250 --> 04:24:45.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:47.570 --> 04:24:47.580 align:start position:0%
closing I thought hello members of the
 
04:24:49.849 --> 04:24:49.859 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Joe Hannan
 
04:24:51.950 --> 04:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
um I've a pretty extensive background
 
04:24:53.210 --> 04:24:53.220 align:start position:0%
working with the substance use Community
 
04:24:54.950 --> 04:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
I've helped start some recovery
 
04:24:56.809 --> 04:24:56.819 align:start position:0%
Community organizations uh harm
 
04:24:58.910 --> 04:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
reduction groups syringe exchanges I was
 
04:25:00.349 --> 04:25:00.359 align:start position:0%
involved in uh helping with the
 
04:25:02.090 --> 04:25:02.100 align:start position:0%
legislation for in service programs
 
04:25:06.469 --> 04:25:06.479 align:start position:0%
Narcan naloxone being legalized and a
 
04:25:07.969 --> 04:25:07.979 align:start position:0%
lot of other different things I'm also
 
04:25:09.290 --> 04:25:09.300 align:start position:0%
someone who's in long-term recovery for
 
04:25:13.750 --> 04:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
over 31 years 32 years now I guess and
 
04:25:15.950 --> 04:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
I've had a lot of experience with
 
04:25:17.689 --> 04:25:17.699 align:start position:0%
individuals who have been incarcerated
 
04:25:20.269 --> 04:25:20.279 align:start position:0%
and also people who have experienced the
 
04:25:22.189 --> 04:25:22.199 align:start position:0%
harms of being incarcerated because of
 
04:25:23.650 --> 04:25:23.660 align:start position:0%
their disease
 
04:25:26.090 --> 04:25:26.100 align:start position:0%
uh there's a lot of things I could talk
 
04:25:27.229 --> 04:25:27.239 align:start position:0%
about but I think one of the most
 
04:25:30.290 --> 04:25:30.300 align:start position:0%
blaringly uh scary statistics that I
 
04:25:32.450 --> 04:25:32.460 align:start position:0%
I've ever heard was
 
04:25:34.429 --> 04:25:34.439 align:start position:0%
um the dangers of dying of an overdose
 
04:25:36.229 --> 04:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
after being released from incarceration
 
04:25:37.550 --> 04:25:37.560 align:start position:0%
within the first two weeks there was a
 
04:25:39.410 --> 04:25:39.420 align:start position:0%
study in North Carolina at UNC back in
 
04:25:42.170 --> 04:25:42.180 align:start position:0%
2018 it was published in the Journal of
 
04:25:43.550 --> 04:25:43.560 align:start position:0%
Public Health
 
04:25:45.769 --> 04:25:45.779 align:start position:0%
they had five researchers they had a
 
04:25:46.969 --> 04:25:46.979 align:start position:0%
member from the North Carolina
 
04:25:48.530 --> 04:25:48.540 align:start position:0%
Department of Public Health and also a
 
04:25:49.790 --> 04:25:49.800 align:start position:0%
member from the Department of Safety
 
04:25:52.130 --> 04:25:52.140 align:start position:0%
involved in the research project and
 
04:25:54.290 --> 04:25:54.300 align:start position:0%
they they monitored the the overdose
 
04:25:56.330 --> 04:25:56.340 align:start position:0%
deaths and people that were formally
 
04:25:58.130 --> 04:25:58.140 align:start position:0%
incarcerated within the first two weeks
 
04:26:01.670 --> 04:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
they found that the risk of dying of an
 
04:26:03.530 --> 04:26:03.540 align:start position:0%
overdose in the first two weeks of being
 
04:26:06.110 --> 04:26:06.120 align:start position:0%
released was 40 times higher than the
 
04:26:08.630 --> 04:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
general population for all substances
 
04:26:10.670 --> 04:26:10.680 align:start position:0%
when looking at heroin use only which
 
04:26:13.010 --> 04:26:13.020 align:start position:0%
was also also include Fentanyl
 
04:26:15.769 --> 04:26:15.779 align:start position:0%
that that same number jumped to 74 times
 
04:26:17.450 --> 04:26:17.460 align:start position:0%
more likely to die of an overdose after
 
04:26:18.950 --> 04:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
being released so we're arresting people
 
04:26:20.689 --> 04:26:20.699 align:start position:0%
for their own safety and for Public
 
04:26:22.130 --> 04:26:22.140 align:start position:0%
Safety but then when we release them
 
04:26:24.110 --> 04:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
they're way more likely to die of an
 
04:26:25.610 --> 04:26:25.620 align:start position:0%
overdose after that incarceration
 
04:26:28.130 --> 04:26:28.140 align:start position:0%
there's other studies that looked at uh
 
04:26:29.870 --> 04:26:29.880 align:start position:0%
being released and it can also apply to
 
04:26:29.880 --> 04:26:31.429 align:start position:0%
being released and it can also apply to
short-term

04:26:31.429 --> 04:26:31.439 align:start position:0%
short-term
 
04:26:33.950 --> 04:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
mental health holds or even short-term
 
04:26:35.630 --> 04:26:35.640 align:start position:0%
rehabs for a week or two in a detox and
 
04:26:36.710 --> 04:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
then they kick someone on the streets
 
04:26:37.790 --> 04:26:37.800 align:start position:0%
they can't get into a treatment program
 
04:26:39.769 --> 04:26:39.779 align:start position:0%
so if someone is not being able to get
 
04:26:43.130 --> 04:26:43.140 align:start position:0%
their substances which is not completely
 
04:26:45.530 --> 04:26:45.540 align:start position:0%
impossible in jail I hear countless
 
04:26:47.090 --> 04:26:47.100 align:start position:0%
stories I know firsthand accounts of
 
04:26:48.410 --> 04:26:48.420 align:start position:0%
people who told me they have no problem
 
04:26:50.210 --> 04:26:50.220 align:start position:0%
getting drugs in jail it might be a
 
04:26:53.090 --> 04:26:53.100 align:start position:0%
little more of a an effort but it's not
 
04:26:54.830 --> 04:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
a problem for people that really need to
 
04:26:57.710 --> 04:26:57.720 align:start position:0%
do that really need to get them but for
 
04:26:59.210 --> 04:26:59.220 align:start position:0%
some that don't they go through serious
 
04:27:00.290 --> 04:27:00.300 align:start position:0%
withdrawal they're not giving medical
 
04:27:02.450 --> 04:27:02.460 align:start position:0%
assisted treatment and they're sick
 
04:27:03.950 --> 04:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
there they feel like they're going to
 
04:27:06.170 --> 04:27:06.180 align:start position:0%
die it's one of the most horrible things
 
04:27:07.969 --> 04:27:07.979 align:start position:0%
in the planet you can think of some
 
04:27:09.229 --> 04:27:09.239 align:start position:0%
people might say oh they deserve it they
 
04:27:10.729 --> 04:27:10.739 align:start position:0%
were doing drugs no one deserves to feel
 
04:27:12.349 --> 04:27:12.359 align:start position:0%
like that
 
04:27:14.090 --> 04:27:14.100 align:start position:0%
um and then when they get out their
 
04:27:16.250 --> 04:27:16.260 align:start position:0%
their tolerance may be lower
 
04:27:18.170 --> 04:27:18.180 align:start position:0%
uh they might not know what substances
 
04:27:19.490 --> 04:27:19.500 align:start position:0%
they're getting because drugs are not
 
04:27:20.689 --> 04:27:20.699 align:start position:0%
regulated we don't know what's in
 
04:27:21.769 --> 04:27:21.779 align:start position:0%
something that's on the street so if
 
04:27:22.849 --> 04:27:22.859 align:start position:0%
someone goes to a different dealer
 
04:27:23.929 --> 04:27:23.939 align:start position:0%
because the person they were with might
 
04:27:25.429 --> 04:27:25.439 align:start position:0%
have got arrested with them they have to
 
04:27:26.689 --> 04:27:26.699 align:start position:0%
go to a new supplier they don't know
 
04:27:28.610 --> 04:27:28.620 align:start position:0%
what's in it they can't go to Consumer
 
04:27:29.870 --> 04:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
Protection to say that guy didn't give
 
04:27:31.670 --> 04:27:31.680 align:start position:0%
me the same fentanyl I got last time so
 
04:27:33.050 --> 04:27:33.060 align:start position:0%
they get something that may be stronger
 
04:27:34.250 --> 04:27:34.260 align:start position:0%
or weaker if it's weaker they can't
 
04:27:35.330 --> 04:27:35.340 align:start position:0%
complain if it's stronger they may
 
04:27:36.950 --> 04:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
overdose and die
 
04:27:39.110 --> 04:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
when we arrest someone
 
04:27:41.630 --> 04:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
they're more likely to be unemployed who
 
04:27:43.729 --> 04:27:43.739 align:start position:0%
lose their job if they had one and there
 
04:27:46.309 --> 04:27:46.319 align:start position:0%
is a myth that people that do drugs
 
04:27:47.990 --> 04:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
don't have jobs there were statistic
 
04:27:50.269 --> 04:27:50.279 align:start position:0%
years ago I was reading that 74 of all
 
04:27:51.649 --> 04:27:51.659 align:start position:0%
people who do heroin have one thing in
 
04:27:53.269 --> 04:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
common that they either have a full or
 
04:27:54.950 --> 04:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
part-time job
 
04:27:57.710 --> 04:27:57.720 align:start position:0%
it it's hard to believe but it is true I
 
04:27:59.510 --> 04:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
do uh syringe exchange Outreach on a
 
04:28:01.370 --> 04:28:01.380 align:start position:0%
weekly basis in this in the state for
 
04:28:03.469 --> 04:28:03.479 align:start position:0%
about five six years now and I see
 
04:28:05.450 --> 04:28:05.460 align:start position:0%
people all the time they they pull up or
 
04:28:07.070 --> 04:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
they come on their bicycles and some
 
04:28:08.750 --> 04:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
people uh we tried to do it earlier in
 
04:28:10.010 --> 04:28:10.020 align:start position:0%
the day but we have to do it later at
 
04:28:12.050 --> 04:28:12.060 align:start position:0%
night because people work there are
 
04:28:13.790 --> 04:28:13.800 align:start position:0%
people that work
 
04:28:15.229 --> 04:28:15.239 align:start position:0%
um but if they get arrested they lose
 
04:28:17.210 --> 04:28:17.220 align:start position:0%
their job and I hear this story I don't
 
04:28:18.950 --> 04:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
think a month goes by where I don't hear
 
04:28:20.870 --> 04:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
someone saying I had a job but I got
 
04:28:22.849 --> 04:28:22.859 align:start position:0%
fired because I got arrested and even if
 
04:28:24.290 --> 04:28:24.300 align:start position:0%
it was for a two or three day hold over
 
04:28:25.790 --> 04:28:25.800 align:start position:0%
the weekend even if it was a misdemeanor
 
04:28:28.309 --> 04:28:28.319 align:start position:0%
if they lose their job that person is
 
04:28:30.590 --> 04:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
more likely to be unhoused not only
 
04:28:32.510 --> 04:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
unemployed but unhoused and then less
 
04:28:33.830 --> 04:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
likely to be able to have access to
 
04:28:35.929 --> 04:28:35.939 align:start position:0%
treatment or any kind of uh help
 
04:28:37.490 --> 04:28:37.500 align:start position:0%
whatsoever in the future when someone's
 
04:28:39.889 --> 04:28:39.899 align:start position:0%
living in a tent in the woods because
 
04:28:41.269 --> 04:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
they lost their job because they were
 
04:28:42.769 --> 04:28:42.779 align:start position:0%
arrested for their own good what good is
 
04:28:44.269 --> 04:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
that doing in society what is what is
 
04:28:45.649 --> 04:28:45.659 align:start position:0%
the benefit of Public Health there is
 
04:28:45.659 --> 04:28:47.269 align:start position:0%
the benefit of Public Health there is
none

04:28:47.269 --> 04:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
none
 
04:28:47.279 --> 04:28:48.050 align:start position:0%
none
um

04:28:48.050 --> 04:28:48.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:50.570 --> 04:28:50.580 align:start position:0%
so I mean I could I could keep going but
 
04:28:51.950 --> 04:28:51.960 align:start position:0%
I think you kind of get the gist of it
 
04:28:53.689 --> 04:28:53.699 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to answer any questions and
 
04:28:55.969 --> 04:28:55.979 align:start position:0%
I I beg you to please at the very least
 
04:28:58.070 --> 04:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
pass this bill I think it should be uh
 
04:29:00.950 --> 04:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
more but this is an excellent start and
 
04:29:02.809 --> 04:29:02.819 align:start position:0%
I commend everyone for uh listening and
 
04:29:05.870 --> 04:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
for the people who spoke in paper
 
04:29:08.929 --> 04:29:08.939 align:start position:0%
yes I'm sorry they call it yeah
 
04:29:12.290 --> 04:29:12.300 align:start position:0%
representative Noel sorry
 
04:29:14.750 --> 04:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
um I I thank you first of all for taking
 
04:29:16.130 --> 04:29:16.140 align:start position:0%
my question
 
04:29:18.530 --> 04:29:18.540 align:start position:0%
um and thank you for um your service to
 
04:29:19.790 --> 04:29:19.800 align:start position:0%
people in New Hampshire dealing with
 
04:29:21.229 --> 04:29:21.239 align:start position:0%
substance use
 
04:29:22.429 --> 04:29:22.439 align:start position:0%
um sounds like you've done some amazing
 
04:29:23.870 --> 04:29:23.880 align:start position:0%
things in the harm reduction realm and I
 
04:29:25.130 --> 04:29:25.140 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
04:29:27.410 --> 04:29:27.420 align:start position:0%
um I was wondering if in your
 
04:29:28.910 --> 04:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
um vast experience of working with
 
04:29:31.370 --> 04:29:31.380 align:start position:0%
people who are struggling with that
 
04:29:34.010 --> 04:29:34.020 align:start position:0%
um you know you talked about uh the
 
04:29:36.170 --> 04:29:36.180 align:start position:0%
increase in the likelihood of overdose
 
04:29:40.070 --> 04:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
death when someone uh is incarcerated
 
04:29:42.769 --> 04:29:42.779 align:start position:0%
and then they're released and uh I'm
 
04:29:43.790 --> 04:29:43.800 align:start position:0%
wondering you know I have my own
 
04:29:45.290 --> 04:29:45.300 align:start position:0%
experience that I can put this into
 
04:29:47.090 --> 04:29:47.100 align:start position:0%
because that's just anecdotal I'm
 
04:29:49.130 --> 04:29:49.140 align:start position:0%
wondering if in your experience with a
 
04:29:51.110 --> 04:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
lot more people how the threat of
 
04:29:53.990 --> 04:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
incarceration impacts people's use
 
04:29:56.149 --> 04:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
how the threat of incarceration well it
 
04:29:57.889 --> 04:29:57.899 align:start position:0%
the the fact that something is illegal
 
04:29:59.929 --> 04:29:59.939 align:start position:0%
in the first place drives drug use not
 
04:30:02.450 --> 04:30:02.460 align:start position:0%
just underground but in into the shadows
 
04:30:03.830 --> 04:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
and I mean that not just literally
 
04:30:05.929 --> 04:30:05.939 align:start position:0%
figuratively literally uh you know
 
04:30:08.030 --> 04:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
people will use behind a dumpster and a
 
04:30:09.590 --> 04:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
dark alley but in a bush somewhere
 
04:30:10.969 --> 04:30:10.979 align:start position:0%
they're more likely if they're using
 
04:30:12.290 --> 04:30:12.300 align:start position:0%
injection drugs they're more likely to
 
04:30:13.670 --> 04:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
have a mistake they might not hit the
 
04:30:15.050 --> 04:30:15.060 align:start position:0%
vein they're trying to do it's more
 
04:30:17.030 --> 04:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
dangerous people with money you know I
 
04:30:18.349 --> 04:30:18.359 align:start position:0%
mean Keith Richards went all those years
 
04:30:21.229 --> 04:30:21.239 align:start position:0%
and he's still alive somehow good for
 
04:30:23.030 --> 04:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
him but you know he was able to do it a
 
04:30:24.349 --> 04:30:24.359 align:start position:0%
nice hotel or in his big mansion
 
04:30:25.849 --> 04:30:25.859 align:start position:0%
somewhere we don't really think about
 
04:30:28.610 --> 04:30:28.620 align:start position:0%
not having the ability and the means to
 
04:30:31.729 --> 04:30:31.739 align:start position:0%
to use safely and not even just illicit
 
04:30:32.990 --> 04:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
substances if you are someone who's
 
04:30:34.490 --> 04:30:34.500 align:start position:0%
diabetic and you have to keep doing
 
04:30:36.170 --> 04:30:36.180 align:start position:0%
blood checks and checking your finger
 
04:30:37.309 --> 04:30:37.319 align:start position:0%
sticks all the time and you can't wash
 
04:30:38.809 --> 04:30:38.819 align:start position:0%
your hands and they're dirty you're
 
04:30:39.950 --> 04:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
going to get an infection you're more
 
04:30:41.929 --> 04:30:41.939 align:start position:0%
likely to have uh serious issues and I
 
04:30:43.070 --> 04:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
was a foot and ankle surgeon for many
 
04:30:44.809 --> 04:30:44.819 align:start position:0%
years I didn't see a lot of people uh
 
04:30:46.790 --> 04:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
you know injecting in their feet but it
 
04:30:47.870 --> 04:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
was definitely something that happened
 
04:30:50.450 --> 04:30:50.460 align:start position:0%
and if someone is homeless or unable to
 
04:30:51.830 --> 04:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
bathe on a regular basis and they don't
 
04:30:53.570 --> 04:30:53.580 align:start position:0%
have a you know hot hot and cold water
 
04:30:56.090 --> 04:30:56.100 align:start position:0%
or anyone water they are going to lose a
 
04:30:58.189 --> 04:30:58.199 align:start position:0%
limb I've had to amputate feet and you
 
04:30:59.750 --> 04:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
know people below the knee because they
 
04:31:01.429 --> 04:31:01.439 align:start position:0%
had serious infections from shooting up
 
04:31:03.050 --> 04:31:03.060 align:start position:0%
between their toes because they wanted
 
04:31:04.550 --> 04:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
to hide their track marks or they just
 
04:31:05.750 --> 04:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
ran out of veins somewhere else because
 
04:31:07.729 --> 04:31:07.739 align:start position:0%
they kept having to rush and do
 
04:31:10.130 --> 04:31:10.140 align:start position:0%
something very quickly so I'm not you
 
04:31:11.510 --> 04:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
know I don't want to I'm not I don't
 
04:31:12.950 --> 04:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily condone someone doing
 
04:31:13.969 --> 04:31:13.979 align:start position:0%
something people make their own
 
04:31:15.050 --> 04:31:15.060 align:start position:0%
decisions but I think it's very
 
04:31:17.389 --> 04:31:17.399 align:start position:0%
important we do as much as we can to
 
04:31:19.610 --> 04:31:19.620 align:start position:0%
remove the barriers to dangerous use to
 
04:31:21.469 --> 04:31:21.479 align:start position:0%
it's it's already one thing to be taking
 
04:31:23.570 --> 04:31:23.580 align:start position:0%
fentanyl or heroin it's another to have
 
04:31:26.330 --> 04:31:26.340 align:start position:0%
policies in place for decades that make
 
04:31:29.030 --> 04:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
it more dangerous and more harmful to
 
04:31:31.130 --> 04:31:31.140 align:start position:0%
everybody and it's not just the people
 
04:31:32.389 --> 04:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
that are getting these injuries and
 
04:31:34.429 --> 04:31:34.439 align:start position:0%
these infections and losing their jobs
 
04:31:36.349 --> 04:31:36.359 align:start position:0%
it's the healthcare workers and the and
 
04:31:37.910 --> 04:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
the First Responders the police and the
 
04:31:39.410 --> 04:31:39.420 align:start position:0%
EMTs who have to deal with this on a
 
04:31:41.389 --> 04:31:41.399 align:start position:0%
regular basis a week doesn't go by where
 
04:31:42.710 --> 04:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
I don't see a very serious infection
 
04:31:44.030 --> 04:31:44.040 align:start position:0%
where I have to beg the person to go to
 
04:31:46.370 --> 04:31:46.380 align:start position:0%
the hospital and it's it's a very hard
 
04:31:47.929 --> 04:31:47.939 align:start position:0%
conversation to have they're afraid to
 
04:31:49.070 --> 04:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
go to the hospital
 
04:31:50.870 --> 04:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh either because of arrests or
 
04:31:53.269 --> 04:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
mistreatment and it's not most providers
 
04:31:54.769 --> 04:31:54.779 align:start position:0%
we have great treatment my wife was an
 
04:31:57.229 --> 04:31:57.239 align:start position:0%
ER DOC for about 30 years
 
04:31:59.210 --> 04:31:59.220 align:start position:0%
um you know it's it's very difficult
 
04:32:01.550 --> 04:32:01.560 align:start position:0%
from that perspective even to see that
 
04:32:03.469 --> 04:32:03.479 align:start position:0%
on a day-to-day basis when it can be
 
04:32:06.469 --> 04:32:06.479 align:start position:0%
prevented we can have safer more Humane
 
04:32:08.750 --> 04:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
policies in place that that prevent this
 
04:32:11.389 --> 04:32:11.399 align:start position:0%
tragic loss of uh Health life and just
 
04:32:13.729 --> 04:32:13.739 align:start position:0%
threats to Public Safety in general
 
04:32:18.050 --> 04:32:18.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:21.110 --> 04:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
thank you doctor thank you
 
04:32:22.729 --> 04:32:22.739 align:start position:0%
is there anybody that is here that
 
04:32:24.649 --> 04:32:24.659 align:start position:0%
wishes to testify that has not turned in
 
04:32:27.170 --> 04:32:27.180 align:start position:0%
a pink card
 
04:32:30.050 --> 04:32:30.060 align:start position:0%
so you know we will close the what will
 
04:32:59.830 --> 04:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:02.630 --> 04:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
good afternoon for the record my name is
 
04:33:06.949 --> 04:33:06.959 align:start position:0%
Heather Marie Brown I originally had not
 
04:33:09.051 --> 04:33:09.061 align:start position:0%
planned on testifying on this bill
 
04:33:12.170 --> 04:33:12.180 align:start position:0%
because I do think it is time that we
 
04:33:15.470 --> 04:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
change penalties around how we handle
 
04:33:17.689 --> 04:33:17.699 align:start position:0%
control substances in the state of New
 
04:33:20.990 --> 04:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but I would also like to
 
04:33:23.209 --> 04:33:23.219 align:start position:0%
remind the committee that as of right
 
04:33:27.470 --> 04:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
now cannabis is still considered a
 
04:33:30.529 --> 04:33:30.539 align:start position:0%
controlled drug and is still classified
 
04:33:33.410 --> 04:33:33.420 align:start position:0%
as a level one controlled drug even in
 
04:33:36.709 --> 04:33:36.719 align:start position:0%
the state and we do have a decrim
 
04:33:39.250 --> 04:33:39.260 align:start position:0%
program we do have therapeutic cannabis
 
04:33:42.349 --> 04:33:42.359 align:start position:0%
and I found it very difficult to
 
04:33:46.070 --> 04:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
determine how this particular bill
 
04:33:49.070 --> 04:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
um would possibly impact
 
04:33:52.369 --> 04:33:52.379 align:start position:0%
cannabis in any way shape or form so I
 
04:33:54.830 --> 04:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
would definitely ask the committee to
 
04:33:57.170 --> 04:33:57.180 align:start position:0%
take a long hard look into that because
 
04:33:59.330 --> 04:33:59.340 align:start position:0%
I can hear through testimony that the
 
04:34:02.830 --> 04:34:02.840 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill is in relevance to
 
04:34:05.869 --> 04:34:05.879 align:start position:0%
opioids and other narcotics but it is
 
04:34:09.170 --> 04:34:09.180 align:start position:0%
not expressed in the bill language
 
04:34:14.150 --> 04:34:14.160 align:start position:0%
itself and at this point in time no one
 
04:34:17.689 --> 04:34:17.699 align:start position:0%
should be charged with a felony in
 
04:34:20.090 --> 04:34:20.100 align:start position:0%
regards to cannabis for anything whether
 
04:34:22.551 --> 04:34:22.561 align:start position:0%
they're a patient or they're a personal
 
04:34:27.131 --> 04:34:27.141 align:start position:0%
user or anything like that so
 
04:34:31.369 --> 04:34:31.379 align:start position:0%
I do agree with the need for change but
 
04:34:33.529 --> 04:34:33.539 align:start position:0%
I do request that the committee take a
 
04:34:36.769 --> 04:34:36.779 align:start position:0%
long hard look at how this particular
 
04:34:39.349 --> 04:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
bill could possibly interact or
 
04:34:42.170 --> 04:34:42.180 align:start position:0%
interfere with anything that's in place
 
04:34:45.349 --> 04:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
or will be coming in place in regards to
 
04:34:47.990 --> 04:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
cannabis or the therapeutic cannabis
 
04:34:52.869 --> 04:34:52.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:57.289 --> 04:34:57.299 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:59.390 --> 04:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
all right this time we will close the
 
04:35:26.510 --> 04:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:28.131 --> 04:35:28.141 align:start position:0%
at this time I'll open the public
 
04:35:31.670 --> 04:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
hearing on HB
 
04:35:31.680 --> 04:35:34.070 align:start position:0%
hearing on HB
360.

04:35:34.070 --> 04:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
360.
 
04:35:34.080 --> 04:35:37.010 align:start position:0%
360.
introduce

04:35:37.010 --> 04:35:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:39.590 --> 04:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
to representative
 
04:35:41.929 --> 04:35:41.939 align:start position:0%
Paul is off
 
04:35:41.939 --> 04:35:47.631 align:start position:0%
Paul is off
spill

04:35:47.631 --> 04:35:47.641 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:49.990 --> 04:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
04:35:54.289 --> 04:35:54.299 align:start position:0%
members of committee my name is of
 
04:35:57.429 --> 04:35:57.439 align:start position:0%
representing Mary Martin
 
04:36:00.470 --> 04:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
I'm here to
 
04:36:05.209 --> 04:36:05.219 align:start position:0%
present Bill 360 FN enact legalizing
 
04:36:09.410 --> 04:36:09.420 align:start position:0%
cannabis for persons 21 years of age or
 
04:36:09.420 --> 04:36:10.609 align:start position:0%
cannabis for persons 21 years of age or
older

04:36:10.609 --> 04:36:10.619 align:start position:0%
older
 
04:36:15.769 --> 04:36:15.779 align:start position:0%
I believe it's logical Next Step you
 
04:36:20.170 --> 04:36:20.180 align:start position:0%
know that we need to take uh previously
 
04:36:24.410 --> 04:36:24.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:27.410 --> 04:36:27.420 align:start position:0%
certain substances and brings reduced
 
04:36:29.650 --> 04:36:29.660 align:start position:0%
medical marijuana
 
04:36:33.650 --> 04:36:33.660 align:start position:0%
and we saw no negative effects after
 
04:36:38.090 --> 04:36:38.100 align:start position:0%
those steps were intellect used
 
04:36:44.209 --> 04:36:44.219 align:start position:0%
uh uh in a position to this bill
 
04:36:47.631 --> 04:36:47.641 align:start position:0%
uh you will you you saw you will see
 
04:36:51.650 --> 04:36:51.660 align:start position:0%
some additional statistics and I want
 
04:36:54.410 --> 04:36:54.420 align:start position:0%
you that some of the statistics might be
 
04:36:57.890 --> 04:36:57.900 align:start position:0%
inaccurate for example if we if a state
 
04:37:01.449 --> 04:37:01.459 align:start position:0%
that uh legalized cannabis
 
04:37:05.209 --> 04:37:05.219 align:start position:0%
does more testing that it might appear
 
04:37:05.219 --> 04:37:06.551 align:start position:0%
does more testing that it might appear
that

04:37:06.551 --> 04:37:06.561 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:37:11.510 --> 04:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
marijuana can lead to more accidents on
 
04:37:12.490 --> 04:37:12.500 align:start position:0%
the road
 
04:37:16.730 --> 04:37:16.740 align:start position:0%
but we know that many users of such
 
04:37:19.910 --> 04:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
substances they
 
04:37:24.369 --> 04:37:24.379 align:start position:0%
tend to stay home or drive slower so
 
04:37:26.750 --> 04:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
I run your
 
04:37:31.849 --> 04:37:31.859 align:start position:0%
about those statistics and as you heard
 
04:37:36.131 --> 04:37:36.141 align:start position:0%
before earned today Glock 4 has failed
 
04:37:39.949 --> 04:37:39.959 align:start position:0%
and the prohibition has failed and
 
04:37:44.269 --> 04:37:44.279 align:start position:0%
yeah New Hampshire is selling alcohol in
 
04:37:46.209 --> 04:37:46.219 align:start position:0%
liquor stores
 
04:37:50.230 --> 04:37:50.240 align:start position:0%
and it's a fact that alcohol is more
 
04:37:53.929 --> 04:37:53.939 align:start position:0%
dangerous substance than what you can
 
04:37:55.810 --> 04:37:55.820 align:start position:0%
find in cannabis
 
04:38:02.570 --> 04:38:02.580 align:start position:0%
and two points why this bill needs to be
 
04:38:05.869 --> 04:38:05.879 align:start position:0%
why we need that now
 
04:38:09.949 --> 04:38:09.959 align:start position:0%
we are currently in Merrimack County and
 
04:38:14.209 --> 04:38:14.219 align:start position:0%
in melanoma County we just don't have
 
04:38:19.010 --> 04:38:19.020 align:start position:0%
staff for our jails here and certain
 
04:38:21.529 --> 04:38:21.539 align:start position:0%
staff shortages you will see in other
 
04:38:24.230 --> 04:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
countries around the state and currently
 
04:38:26.689 --> 04:38:26.699 align:start position:0%
it's elevated by
 
04:38:29.269 --> 04:38:29.279 align:start position:0%
we don't have as many convicts due to
 
04:38:33.470 --> 04:38:33.480 align:start position:0%
Bell reform and as the circumstances but
 
04:38:36.890 --> 04:38:36.900 align:start position:0%
as some of the steps of well reform are
 
04:38:40.970 --> 04:38:40.980 align:start position:0%
about to be reversed and with
 
04:38:40.980 --> 04:38:43.131 align:start position:0%
about to be reversed and with
current

04:38:43.131 --> 04:38:43.141 align:start position:0%
current
 
04:38:45.609 --> 04:38:45.619 align:start position:0%
economic recession
 
04:38:49.429 --> 04:38:49.439 align:start position:0%
leading to more crimes we will just have
 
04:38:52.250 --> 04:38:52.260 align:start position:0%
not enough resources and the same with
 
04:38:57.109 --> 04:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
police resources I represent towns that
 
04:38:59.349 --> 04:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
are bordering Manchester New Hampshire
 
04:39:02.830 --> 04:39:02.840 align:start position:0%
and you might have heard about
 
04:39:07.070 --> 04:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
crime level in Manchester and from my
 
04:39:09.670 --> 04:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
experience I might tell you
 
04:39:12.289 --> 04:39:12.299 align:start position:0%
speaking with different Manchester
 
04:39:14.990 --> 04:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
residents it's pretty common that police
 
04:39:17.150 --> 04:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't have enough resources to
 
04:39:20.269 --> 04:39:20.279 align:start position:0%
investigate property crime when there's
 
04:39:23.750 --> 04:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
an actual victim when the vehicle was
 
04:39:25.570 --> 04:39:25.580 align:start position:0%
damaged or stolen
 
04:39:29.269 --> 04:39:29.279 align:start position:0%
and many Manchester residents wouldn't
 
04:39:31.849 --> 04:39:31.859 align:start position:0%
even go to police if
 
04:39:34.070 --> 04:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
if the bicycle stolen or something like
 
04:39:36.349 --> 04:39:36.359 align:start position:0%
that because they know that it won't be
 
04:39:40.430 --> 04:39:40.440 align:start position:0%
properly investigated and we our laws
 
04:39:43.730 --> 04:39:43.740 align:start position:0%
direct police to investigate drug crimes
 
04:39:48.948 --> 04:39:48.958 align:start position:0%
including people who smoke or sell weed
 
04:39:53.288 --> 04:39:53.298 align:start position:0%
so as a legislative body it's up to us
 
04:39:57.850 --> 04:39:57.860 align:start position:0%
to set up priorities trade for police to
 
04:40:02.868 --> 04:40:02.878 align:start position:0%
help them to prioritize investigating
 
04:40:05.868 --> 04:40:05.878 align:start position:0%
when there's an actual victims and
 
04:40:10.610 --> 04:40:10.620 align:start position:0%
property crimes and last point you might
 
04:40:14.090 --> 04:40:14.100 align:start position:0%
have heard about marijuana laced with
 
04:40:18.110 --> 04:40:18.120 align:start position:0%
fentanyl it's something recent and why
 
04:40:20.810 --> 04:40:20.820 align:start position:0%
it's happening the only reason why it's
 
04:40:23.330 --> 04:40:23.340 align:start position:0%
happening it's because cannabis is not
 
04:40:27.050 --> 04:40:27.060 align:start position:0%
legalized so when it's illegal
 
04:40:30.770 --> 04:40:30.780 align:start position:0%
there's a no way for buyers to know its
 
04:40:30.780 --> 04:40:31.990 align:start position:0%
there's a no way for buyers to know its
quality

04:40:31.990 --> 04:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
quality
 
04:40:35.270 --> 04:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
to set up some
 
04:40:38.630 --> 04:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
process to verify
 
04:40:41.630 --> 04:40:41.640 align:start position:0%
the legitimacy of a person who they
 
04:40:44.230 --> 04:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
buying from so
 
04:40:48.368 --> 04:40:48.378 align:start position:0%
actual lives are on the line because
 
04:40:52.430 --> 04:40:52.440 align:start position:0%
those opiates can kill people and they
 
04:40:55.430 --> 04:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
do kill people in in this country
 
04:41:02.630 --> 04:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:04.788 --> 04:41:04.798 align:start position:0%
represent Sally
 
04:41:06.530 --> 04:41:06.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:41:07.910 --> 04:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
my question
 
04:41:10.190 --> 04:41:10.200 align:start position:0%
um so if I understand correctly this
 
04:41:12.470 --> 04:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
legalizes cannabis completely Lee and
 
04:41:16.730 --> 04:41:16.740 align:start position:0%
has no method in it for verifying that
 
04:41:19.190 --> 04:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
what people have is pure and clean is
 
04:41:21.170 --> 04:41:21.180 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
04:41:23.270 --> 04:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
could you repeat the last sentence no
 
04:41:25.430 --> 04:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
message to verify what so I'm just
 
04:41:26.690 --> 04:41:26.700 align:start position:0%
trying to understand your bill is to
 
04:41:28.850 --> 04:41:28.860 align:start position:0%
completely legalize cannabis but there's
 
04:41:31.550 --> 04:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
no method for regulating the sale or
 
04:41:33.470 --> 04:41:33.480 align:start position:0%
distribution or ensuring that it's not
 
04:41:33.480 --> 04:41:37.330 align:start position:0%
distribution or ensuring that it's not
leased

04:41:37.330 --> 04:41:37.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:41.628 --> 04:41:41.638 align:start position:0%
correct but when it's legal it's a salt
 
04:41:41.638 --> 04:41:43.208 align:start position:0%
correct but when it's legal it's a salt
through

04:41:43.208 --> 04:41:43.218 align:start position:0%
through
 
04:41:49.610 --> 04:41:49.620 align:start position:0%
legal stories and then we have
 
04:41:52.570 --> 04:41:52.580 align:start position:0%
all the safeguards
 
04:41:56.030 --> 04:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
established by free market but also by
 
04:41:59.810 --> 04:41:59.820 align:start position:0%
customer protection laws and knowing who
 
04:42:09.708 --> 04:42:09.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:14.510 --> 04:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:22.788 --> 04:42:22.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:25.128 --> 04:42:25.138 align:start position:0%
uh thank you members of the committee I
 
04:42:26.510 --> 04:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
want to introduce myself again it's not
 
04:42:27.770 --> 04:42:27.780 align:start position:0%
been that long
 
04:42:29.448 --> 04:42:29.458 align:start position:0%
um I don't want to speak too long on
 
04:42:31.310 --> 04:42:31.320 align:start position:0%
this I make myself available to answer
 
04:42:33.770 --> 04:42:33.780 align:start position:0%
any questions but I do like to um just
 
04:42:35.270 --> 04:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
mention one little one or two little
 
04:42:37.310 --> 04:42:37.320 align:start position:0%
things one uh we've heard a lot of
 
04:42:39.170 --> 04:42:39.180 align:start position:0%
testimony in Prior cannabis bills and
 
04:42:41.570 --> 04:42:41.580 align:start position:0%
legislation about uh access for youth
 
04:42:44.570 --> 04:42:44.580 align:start position:0%
this is obviously for adults this does
 
04:42:46.550 --> 04:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
not pertain to Children especially or
 
04:42:49.310 --> 04:42:49.320 align:start position:0%
people under 21 who are also adults
 
04:42:51.650 --> 04:42:51.660 align:start position:0%
um the other the other thing is you hear
 
04:42:53.930 --> 04:42:53.940 align:start position:0%
a lot about uh talks about gateway drugs
 
04:42:55.368 --> 04:42:55.378 align:start position:0%
and you know it's one thing leads to
 
04:42:57.770 --> 04:42:57.780 align:start position:0%
another uh you know as someone who has
 
04:43:00.350 --> 04:43:00.360 align:start position:0%
uh you know a youthful colorful youth
 
04:43:02.810 --> 04:43:02.820 align:start position:0%
history himself I can tell you uh
 
04:43:04.250 --> 04:43:04.260 align:start position:0%
personally and through a lot of
 
04:43:05.750 --> 04:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
experience talking to other individuals
 
04:43:08.090 --> 04:43:08.100 align:start position:0%
and research and different studies out
 
04:43:10.550 --> 04:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
there that there is a much higher
 
04:43:12.050 --> 04:43:12.060 align:start position:0%
likelihood of someone getting more
 
04:43:13.850 --> 04:43:13.860 align:start position:0%
illicit substances on the illicit Market
 
04:43:15.530 --> 04:43:15.540 align:start position:0%
more dangerous drugs like fentanyl
 
04:43:17.330 --> 04:43:17.340 align:start position:0%
heroin methamphetamines if they're
 
04:43:19.070 --> 04:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
buying something that is already on the
 
04:43:20.570 --> 04:43:20.580 align:start position:0%
illicit Market that is a lower level
 
04:43:23.150 --> 04:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
drug considered a lower dangerous
 
04:43:26.330 --> 04:43:26.340 align:start position:0%
rock-like cannabis so you know most
 
04:43:28.190 --> 04:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
teenagers are not going into a liquor
 
04:43:29.868 --> 04:43:29.878 align:start position:0%
store and buying fentanyl they're not
 
04:43:31.250 --> 04:43:31.260 align:start position:0%
going into a bar they're not going into
 
04:43:34.910 --> 04:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
a cannabis store in Maine Vermont or
 
04:43:37.128 --> 04:43:37.138 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts they're they're usually
 
04:43:38.930 --> 04:43:38.940 align:start position:0%
buying it on the street and if we can
 
04:43:41.690 --> 04:43:41.700 align:start position:0%
get rid of that we can actually make a
 
04:43:43.788 --> 04:43:43.798 align:start position:0%
giant step in preventing uh underage use
 
04:43:45.708 --> 04:43:45.718 align:start position:0%
of some of these substances
 
04:43:51.010 --> 04:43:51.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:53.810 --> 04:43:53.820 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler sorry Mr chairman
 
04:43:54.890 --> 04:43:54.900 align:start position:0%
I thank you for letting me take this
 
04:43:54.900 --> 04:43:55.970 align:start position:0%
I thank you for letting me take this
question

04:43:55.970 --> 04:43:55.980 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:43:59.330 --> 04:43:59.340 align:start position:0%
is it easy to get marijuana at a store
 
04:44:01.250 --> 04:44:01.260 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts or Vermont the states
 
04:44:03.530 --> 04:44:03.540 align:start position:0%
where it's legal I haven't done it so I
 
04:44:05.330 --> 04:44:05.340 align:start position:0%
don't know personally how easy it is but
 
04:44:07.010 --> 04:44:07.020 align:start position:0%
I know people just drive across the
 
04:44:08.208 --> 04:44:08.218 align:start position:0%
border they buy it and we've heard
 
04:44:09.948 --> 04:44:09.958 align:start position:0%
testimony and I think yesterday we heard
 
04:44:11.270 --> 04:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
something in Commerce about another bill
 
04:44:13.250 --> 04:44:13.260 align:start position:0%
that was testifying there I don't talk
 
04:44:15.410 --> 04:44:15.420 align:start position:0%
don't talk about this bill but
 
04:44:17.150 --> 04:44:17.160 align:start position:0%
um there were several at least one or
 
04:44:19.128 --> 04:44:19.138 align:start position:0%
two people testified about more cars
 
04:44:20.510 --> 04:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire plates in the parking
 
04:44:22.190 --> 04:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
lot right over the Border in Maine and
 
04:44:24.708 --> 04:44:24.718 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and uh I know that's
 
04:44:27.590 --> 04:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
that's you know from from people telling
 
04:44:29.990 --> 04:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
me that they've done it to uh you know
 
04:44:31.368 --> 04:44:31.378 align:start position:0%
hearing testimony it's definitely
 
04:44:33.410 --> 04:44:33.420 align:start position:0%
happening it's not hard to do uh I'm
 
04:44:34.490 --> 04:44:34.500 align:start position:0%
trying to find the statistics but
 
04:44:36.410 --> 04:44:36.420 align:start position:0%
someone told me that how many that most
 
04:44:37.610 --> 04:44:37.620 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire population up here
 
04:44:38.510 --> 04:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
the percentage it's a very large
 
04:44:40.128 --> 04:44:40.138 align:start position:0%
percentage within 45 minutes of a
 
04:44:42.170 --> 04:44:42.180 align:start position:0%
dispensary in another state so they're
 
04:44:43.730 --> 04:44:43.740 align:start position:0%
driving there they're getting it the
 
04:44:45.650 --> 04:44:45.660 align:start position:0%
other thing is uh I've heard a lot of
 
04:44:47.750 --> 04:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
complaints from law enforcement about
 
04:44:49.670 --> 04:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
you know well there there are people we
 
04:44:50.750 --> 04:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
don't have a way to test for it they're
 
04:44:52.670 --> 04:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
on the roads they're driving they're
 
04:44:54.230 --> 04:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
driving now and they're driving further
 
04:44:55.610 --> 04:44:55.620 align:start position:0%
and longer because they have to go
 
04:44:56.810 --> 04:44:56.820 align:start position:0%
somewhere else to get it because it's
 
04:44:58.550 --> 04:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
not legal here so if you want to have
 
04:45:00.110 --> 04:45:00.120 align:start position:0%
less people under the influence on the
 
04:45:00.120 --> 04:45:01.310 align:start position:0%
less people under the influence on the
roads

04:45:01.310 --> 04:45:01.320 align:start position:0%
roads
 
04:45:03.470 --> 04:45:03.480 align:start position:0%
make it local I mean if it's if someone
 
04:45:05.990 --> 04:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
has to go and get it usually responsible
 
04:45:08.090 --> 04:45:08.100 align:start position:0%
people would wait till they get home
 
04:45:09.708 --> 04:45:09.718 align:start position:0%
I'd like to think that was that's the
 
04:45:11.448 --> 04:45:11.458 align:start position:0%
rule but it may not happen it's more
 
04:45:13.550 --> 04:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
likely to be a problem if people have to
 
04:45:14.990 --> 04:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
go further
 
04:45:17.868 --> 04:45:17.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:21.170 --> 04:45:21.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:23.570 --> 04:45:23.580 align:start position:0%
um I'm curious uh since you're you seem
 
04:45:25.910 --> 04:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
to be familiar with the subject rather
 
04:45:29.448 --> 04:45:29.458 align:start position:0%
than a gateway drug to to use of other
 
04:45:31.490 --> 04:45:31.500 align:start position:0%
more serious drugs one of the things
 
04:45:34.730 --> 04:45:34.740 align:start position:0%
I've been reading about lately is its
 
04:45:38.150 --> 04:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
therapeutic value in helping people uh
 
04:45:40.128 --> 04:45:40.138 align:start position:0%
struggle with struggling with substance
 
04:45:43.128 --> 04:45:43.138 align:start position:0%
use and I'm curious if you have
 
04:45:45.230 --> 04:45:45.240 align:start position:0%
um if you have any knowledge on that and
 
04:45:49.190 --> 04:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
if you could speak to it yes there's for
 
04:45:51.230 --> 04:45:51.240 align:start position:0%
for many decades in this in this country
 
04:45:53.330 --> 04:45:53.340 align:start position:0%
and around the world the the standard of
 
04:45:55.610 --> 04:45:55.620 align:start position:0%
treatment for substance use was well
 
04:45:57.110 --> 04:45:57.120 align:start position:0%
just don't do it you know we can't have
 
04:45:58.850 --> 04:45:58.860 align:start position:0%
anybody doing anything just if you're
 
04:46:01.368 --> 04:46:01.378 align:start position:0%
doing it you're not in recovery and uh
 
04:46:03.470 --> 04:46:03.480 align:start position:0%
when I came around in 1991 that was the
 
04:46:05.090 --> 04:46:05.100 align:start position:0%
school of thought you just don't do it
 
04:46:07.850 --> 04:46:07.860 align:start position:0%
and I haven't since but there are a lot
 
04:46:09.650 --> 04:46:09.660 align:start position:0%
of people who uh you know there's
 
04:46:12.708 --> 04:46:12.718 align:start position:0%
there's a Continuum of of use from
 
04:46:15.708 --> 04:46:15.718 align:start position:0%
casual to chaotic use and people fall
 
04:46:18.110 --> 04:46:18.120 align:start position:0%
all along that Continuum of usage if
 
04:46:19.430 --> 04:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
there's a way to get someone from very
 
04:46:22.010 --> 04:46:22.020 align:start position:0%
chaotic use it's very harmful to get it
 
04:46:23.690 --> 04:46:23.700 align:start position:0%
to more moderate or even occasional use
 
04:46:27.050 --> 04:46:27.060 align:start position:0%
that's infinitely better than not doing
 
04:46:29.090 --> 04:46:29.100 align:start position:0%
anything and staying a catech use and if
 
04:46:31.788 --> 04:46:31.798 align:start position:0%
we force people to just be abstinent all
 
04:46:34.010 --> 04:46:34.020 align:start position:0%
the time it's a nice goal but it's not
 
04:46:36.350 --> 04:46:36.360 align:start position:0%
realistic we live in the real world and
 
04:46:37.850 --> 04:46:37.860 align:start position:0%
I think that having options available
 
04:46:40.250 --> 04:46:40.260 align:start position:0%
may not be the ideal for everybody but I
 
04:46:42.830 --> 04:46:42.840 align:start position:0%
think it is an absolute necessity to
 
04:46:44.330 --> 04:46:44.340 align:start position:0%
have it as an as an option available
 
04:46:47.330 --> 04:46:47.340 align:start position:0%
years ago I was invited to Hempfest and
 
04:46:48.590 --> 04:46:48.600 align:start position:0%
I was like well you know I was a State
 
04:46:50.150 --> 04:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
Rep I was you know I think I knew I had
 
04:46:52.550 --> 04:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
like 25 years in recovery I'm like I
 
04:46:54.890 --> 04:46:54.900 align:start position:0%
appreciate the offer I'm okay I'm in
 
04:46:56.570 --> 04:46:56.580 align:start position:0%
recovery and he looked at me goes so am
 
04:46:58.788 --> 04:46:58.798 align:start position:0%
I I'm like what are you talking about
 
04:47:01.010 --> 04:47:01.020 align:start position:0%
and he told me you know he used to do
 
04:47:02.990 --> 04:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
this and like okay and crack and lost
 
04:47:05.448 --> 04:47:05.458 align:start position:0%
his family all this stuff and now he has
 
04:47:07.610 --> 04:47:07.620 align:start position:0%
all that back he smokes pot smokes
 
04:47:09.410 --> 04:47:09.420 align:start position:0%
cannabis but he's got all those other
 
04:47:11.090 --> 04:47:11.100 align:start position:0%
things and that is not just a one-off
 
04:47:12.650 --> 04:47:12.660 align:start position:0%
situation I've heard countless
 
04:47:14.510 --> 04:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
situations like that it's not my
 
04:47:16.010 --> 04:47:16.020 align:start position:0%
preferred method of treatment but if it
 
04:47:18.050 --> 04:47:18.060 align:start position:0%
works for somebody who am I to say that
 
04:47:19.610 --> 04:47:19.620 align:start position:0%
they're living a better life is not
 
04:47:21.230 --> 04:47:21.240 align:start position:0%
right for them and it does work for a
 
04:47:27.288 --> 04:47:27.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:30.288 --> 04:47:30.298 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
04:47:32.030 --> 04:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else wishing to testify
 
04:47:42.890 --> 04:47:42.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:44.390 --> 04:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
um if it's all right I would just like
 
04:47:48.350 --> 04:47:48.360 align:start position:0%
to add a little bit to what he was
 
04:47:48.360 --> 04:47:53.510 align:start position:0%
to add a little bit to what he was
saying

04:47:53.510 --> 04:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:00.410 --> 04:48:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:02.570 --> 04:48:02.580 align:start position:0%
uh so yeah I really appreciate this bill
 
04:48:04.128 --> 04:48:04.138 align:start position:0%
and thank you all for uh for listening
 
04:48:05.270 --> 04:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
to it
 
04:48:07.550 --> 04:48:07.560 align:start position:0%
there's obviously a lot of legislation
 
04:48:10.010 --> 04:48:10.020 align:start position:0%
that proposes to change the laws on
 
04:48:12.830 --> 04:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
cannabis I appreciate the ones that
 
04:48:16.610 --> 04:48:16.620 align:start position:0%
don't involve a bunch of regulations and
 
04:48:19.610 --> 04:48:19.620 align:start position:0%
taxes and hoops and applications and
 
04:48:22.850 --> 04:48:22.860 align:start position:0%
fees this is a plant it should be
 
04:48:25.430 --> 04:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
treated like a plant meaning that the
 
04:48:27.368 --> 04:48:27.378 align:start position:0%
government should stay out of it
 
04:48:29.930 --> 04:48:29.940 align:start position:0%
somebody mentioned one of the Reps in
 
04:48:31.570 --> 04:48:31.580 align:start position:0%
their questions mentioned lacing
 
04:48:35.510 --> 04:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
cannabis as someone who has been
 
04:48:37.850 --> 04:48:37.860 align:start position:0%
involved in the purchase of cannabis
 
04:48:41.390 --> 04:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
over many years I have never come across
 
04:48:43.970 --> 04:48:43.980 align:start position:0%
anything that would have been advertised
 
04:48:46.970 --> 04:48:46.980 align:start position:0%
or not advertised as laced cannabis even
 
04:48:49.850 --> 04:48:49.860 align:start position:0%
illegal drug dealers have zero incentive
 
04:48:52.368 --> 04:48:52.378 align:start position:0%
to lace cannabis because it simply would
 
04:48:55.010 --> 04:48:55.020 align:start position:0%
raise the cost of selling the Cannabis
 
04:48:56.990 --> 04:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
there's no reason for that and there's
 
04:48:59.948 --> 04:48:59.958 align:start position:0%
certainly no reason for a legitimate
 
04:49:02.530 --> 04:49:02.540 align:start position:0%
Marketplace for you know a corner store
 
04:49:05.868 --> 04:49:05.878 align:start position:0%
or a grocery store to you know deal with
 
04:49:07.910 --> 04:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
lace to Canada so we certainly would not
 
04:49:09.170 --> 04:49:09.180 align:start position:0%
we don't see it in the black market
 
04:49:12.230 --> 04:49:12.240 align:start position:0%
today we certainly would not see that in
 
04:49:15.830 --> 04:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
a in a legal Market the bill is you know
 
04:49:18.050 --> 04:49:18.060 align:start position:0%
it's a complicated statute so there's a
 
04:49:21.050 --> 04:49:21.060 align:start position:0%
lot of changes that it proposes and
 
04:49:24.708 --> 04:49:24.718 align:start position:0%
maybe I'm missing it but on page two
 
04:49:28.788 --> 04:49:28.798 align:start position:0%
section or I guess just after line 10 it
 
04:49:32.390 --> 04:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
proposes to amend the RSA to strike
 
04:49:34.310 --> 04:49:34.320 align:start position:0%
marijuana from some of the penalty
 
04:49:38.890 --> 04:49:38.900 align:start position:0%
sections specifically section
 
04:49:44.390 --> 04:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
IB and I C which deals with marijuana in
 
04:49:46.670 --> 04:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
a quantity of five pounds or more or
 
04:49:50.750 --> 04:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
marijuana in a quantity of five grams or
 
04:49:53.090 --> 04:49:53.100 align:start position:0%
more but it doesn't seem to deal with
 
04:49:55.910 --> 04:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
five grams or less or three quarters of
 
04:49:58.010 --> 04:49:58.020 align:start position:0%
an ounce or less maybe that's somewhere
 
04:49:59.448 --> 04:49:59.458 align:start position:0%
else that I just haven't seen it but
 
04:50:01.490 --> 04:50:01.500 align:start position:0%
that's that's what comes after those two
 
04:50:04.128 --> 04:50:04.138 align:start position:0%
so we're striking those two it would
 
04:50:06.890 --> 04:50:06.900 align:start position:0%
seem we should strike the people who
 
04:50:09.890 --> 04:50:09.900 align:start position:0%
have it for sale for less than three
 
04:50:12.230 --> 04:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
quarters of an ounce as well again this
 
04:50:14.030 --> 04:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
this does get us closer to treating
 
04:50:16.070 --> 04:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
marijuana as the plant that it is and so
 
04:50:17.570 --> 04:50:17.580 align:start position:0%
I support it thank you happy to take any
 
04:50:17.580 --> 04:50:20.990 align:start position:0%
I support it thank you happy to take any
questions

04:50:20.990 --> 04:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:24.830 --> 04:50:24.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
04:50:29.390 --> 04:50:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:31.070 --> 04:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
thank you filling out the card we need
 
04:50:41.930 --> 04:50:41.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:44.570 --> 04:50:44.580 align:start position:0%
I I just wanted to add a little bit more
 
04:50:46.670 --> 04:50:46.680 align:start position:0%
information to the question that
 
04:50:49.070 --> 04:50:49.080 align:start position:0%
representative Newell had
 
04:50:52.970 --> 04:50:52.980 align:start position:0%
um asked I believe it was uh in the
 
04:50:55.788 --> 04:50:55.798 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program one of the
 
04:50:57.410 --> 04:50:57.420 align:start position:0%
things that the medical oversight board
 
04:51:01.570 --> 04:51:01.580 align:start position:0%
is working on is actually collecting
 
04:51:05.750 --> 04:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
data that can be used for educational
 
04:51:10.490 --> 04:51:10.500 align:start position:0%
and informative purposes we are seeing
 
04:51:15.050 --> 04:51:15.060 align:start position:0%
very significant numbers so far that you
 
04:51:17.270 --> 04:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
know we're not prepared to give out a
 
04:51:20.270 --> 04:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
this is this percentage at the moment
 
04:51:23.948 --> 04:51:23.958 align:start position:0%
but we are seeing significant numbers on
 
04:51:27.230 --> 04:51:27.240 align:start position:0%
individuals being able to decrease
 
04:51:31.010 --> 04:51:31.020 align:start position:0%
opioid use and the use of other hard
 
04:51:34.368 --> 04:51:34.378 align:start position:0%
narcotics from their system
 
04:51:38.330 --> 04:51:38.340 align:start position:0%
um and I personally myself have had that
 
04:51:41.570 --> 04:51:41.580 align:start position:0%
experience I've been a therapeutic
 
04:51:44.930 --> 04:51:44.940 align:start position:0%
cannabis user long before therapeutic
 
04:51:47.208 --> 04:51:47.218 align:start position:0%
cannabis was legal in the state of New
 
04:51:50.448 --> 04:51:50.458 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and had it not been for my
 
04:51:54.910 --> 04:51:54.920 align:start position:0%
ability to use cannabis therapeutically
 
04:51:57.770 --> 04:51:57.780 align:start position:0%
I do not believe that I would be
 
04:52:00.410 --> 04:52:00.420 align:start position:0%
standing here today to talk to any of
 
04:52:00.420 --> 04:52:01.390 align:start position:0%
standing here today to talk to any of
you

04:52:01.390 --> 04:52:01.400 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:52:05.690 --> 04:52:05.700 align:start position:0%
I would probably if not be dead I would
 
04:52:07.208 --> 04:52:07.218 align:start position:0%
be incarcerated
 
04:52:11.150 --> 04:52:11.160 align:start position:0%
so I did want to throw that little
 
04:52:13.670 --> 04:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
tidbit in there because I I think it is
 
04:52:16.430 --> 04:52:16.440 align:start position:0%
important to know that you know no
 
04:52:19.190 --> 04:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
matter how we choose to go forward with
 
04:52:21.770 --> 04:52:21.780 align:start position:0%
legalization that there are positive
 
04:52:24.708 --> 04:52:24.718 align:start position:0%
impacts in that individuals are allowed
 
04:52:28.368 --> 04:52:28.378 align:start position:0%
to be and create a positive position for
 
04:52:31.250 --> 04:52:31.260 align:start position:0%
themselves within society that does not
 
04:52:34.910 --> 04:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
have to involve a lengthy criminal
 
04:52:34.920 --> 04:52:40.788 align:start position:0%
have to involve a lengthy criminal
background

04:52:40.788 --> 04:52:40.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:43.730 --> 04:52:43.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:43.740 --> 04:52:51.410 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:52:51.410 --> 04:52:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:53.208 --> 04:52:53.218 align:start position:0%
are you wishing to testify on the skill
 
04:52:53.218 --> 04:53:05.330 align:start position:0%
are you wishing to testify on the skill
Circle

04:53:05.330 --> 04:53:05.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:07.070 --> 04:53:07.080 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
04:53:07.080 --> 04:53:15.830 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
bogert

04:53:15.830 --> 04:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:18.490 --> 04:53:18.500 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman
 
04:53:22.610 --> 04:53:22.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:25.430 --> 04:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to talk about statistics
 
04:53:29.030 --> 04:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
or or how good bad or indifference
 
04:53:31.970 --> 04:53:31.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:33.650 --> 04:53:33.660 align:start position:0%
what I'd like to talk about is some
 
04:53:37.190 --> 04:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
common sense okay we live in the Live
 
04:53:39.948 --> 04:53:39.958 align:start position:0%
Free or Die State and a lot of the
 
04:53:45.050 --> 04:53:45.060 align:start position:0%
problems with uh making pot illegal
 
04:53:47.330 --> 04:53:47.340 align:start position:0%
is the fact it doesn't make any common
 
04:53:47.340 --> 04:53:48.650 align:start position:0%
is the fact it doesn't make any common
sense

04:53:48.650 --> 04:53:48.660 align:start position:0%
sense
 
04:53:52.730 --> 04:53:52.740 align:start position:0%
some people say well it's a lead on drug
 
04:53:55.490 --> 04:53:55.500 align:start position:0%
that lead you on to Other Drugs
 
04:53:55.500 --> 04:53:57.110 align:start position:0%
that lead you on to Other Drugs
well

04:53:57.110 --> 04:53:57.120 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:53:59.628 --> 04:53:59.638 align:start position:0%
one has to ask themselves
 
04:54:01.730 --> 04:54:01.740 align:start position:0%
is that really true
 
04:54:05.890 --> 04:54:05.900 align:start position:0%
okay now let's think about alcohol
 
04:54:08.150 --> 04:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
is illegal
 
04:54:08.160 --> 04:54:10.730 align:start position:0%
is illegal
drug

04:54:10.730 --> 04:54:10.740 align:start position:0%
drug
 
04:54:10.740 --> 04:54:12.708 align:start position:0%
drug
okay

04:54:12.708 --> 04:54:12.718 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:54:15.708 --> 04:54:15.718 align:start position:0%
does it lead to alcoholism
 
04:54:19.970 --> 04:54:19.980 align:start position:0%
yeah some people become alcoholics
 
04:54:23.270 --> 04:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
but a greater majority of the people do
 
04:54:23.280 --> 04:54:24.170 align:start position:0%
but a greater majority of the people do
not

04:54:24.170 --> 04:54:24.180 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:54:26.230 --> 04:54:26.240 align:start position:0%
so it's called self-constraint
 
04:54:31.070 --> 04:54:31.080 align:start position:0%
self-control and and being able to do
 
04:54:34.670 --> 04:54:34.680 align:start position:0%
and enjoy it the way one does in their
 
04:54:36.410 --> 04:54:36.420 align:start position:0%
own home
 
04:54:38.868 --> 04:54:38.878 align:start position:0%
let's look at cigarettes
 
04:54:42.050 --> 04:54:42.060 align:start position:0%
cigarettes we know for a fact kill
 
04:54:42.060 --> 04:54:43.850 align:start position:0%
cigarettes we know for a fact kill
people

04:54:43.850 --> 04:54:43.860 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:54:45.890 --> 04:54:45.900 align:start position:0%
okay I don't need to quote the numbers
 
04:54:50.150 --> 04:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
that everybody knows them okay you smoke
 
04:54:52.430 --> 04:54:52.440 align:start position:0%
a greater majority of you going to die
 
04:54:55.850 --> 04:54:55.860 align:start position:0%
from something from the cigarette
 
04:54:59.270 --> 04:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
okay do we regulate it
 
04:55:01.670 --> 04:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
I think we only say you got to be 21 to
 
04:55:04.128 --> 04:55:04.138 align:start position:0%
buy it and then other than that you do
 
04:55:05.448 --> 04:55:05.458 align:start position:0%
what you want
 
04:55:08.150 --> 04:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
okay you might regulate where it is but
 
04:55:11.150 --> 04:55:11.160 align:start position:0%
for a non-smoker I'm a non-smoker
 
04:55:14.208 --> 04:55:14.218 align:start position:0%
I still have to put up with the smells
 
04:55:17.090 --> 04:55:17.100 align:start position:0%
and stuff and the cigarette butts and
 
04:55:19.910 --> 04:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
everything else but that's okay
 
04:55:23.330 --> 04:55:23.340 align:start position:0%
that's the choice people get to make
 
04:55:25.910 --> 04:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
living in a state it's called Live Free
 
04:55:28.010 --> 04:55:28.020 align:start position:0%
or Die
 
04:55:29.868 --> 04:55:29.878 align:start position:0%
so pot
 
04:55:32.990 --> 04:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
candidates or however Which Way formed
 
04:55:34.730 --> 04:55:34.740 align:start position:0%
you would like it
 
04:55:38.448 --> 04:55:38.458 align:start position:0%
if enjoyed in the right way at your home
 
04:55:41.390 --> 04:55:41.400 align:start position:0%
being 21 years of age
 
04:55:43.850 --> 04:55:43.860 align:start position:0%
that why wouldn't you be able to enjoy
 
04:55:43.860 --> 04:55:44.930 align:start position:0%
that why wouldn't you be able to enjoy
it

04:55:44.930 --> 04:55:44.940 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:55:47.448 --> 04:55:47.458 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't think anybody's ever heard
 
04:55:51.288 --> 04:55:51.298 align:start position:0%
of a violent crying
 
04:55:53.570 --> 04:55:53.580 align:start position:0%
coming out of someone who smoked a joint
 
04:55:56.208 --> 04:55:56.218 align:start position:0%
except maybe to a Dorito bag or
 
04:55:58.610 --> 04:55:58.620 align:start position:0%
something they might have got a little
 
04:56:01.430 --> 04:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
vicious with but if you had to look at
 
04:56:01.440 --> 04:56:02.448 align:start position:0%
vicious with but if you had to look at
it

04:56:02.448 --> 04:56:02.458 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:56:06.050 --> 04:56:06.060 align:start position:0%
how many people drunk has caused
 
04:56:09.530 --> 04:56:09.540 align:start position:0%
problems that had too much alcohol
 
04:56:11.890 --> 04:56:11.900 align:start position:0%
you've seen more people incarcerated
 
04:56:14.150 --> 04:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
being drunk
 
04:56:16.310 --> 04:56:16.320 align:start position:0%
causing trouble
 
04:56:17.750 --> 04:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
real trouble
 
04:56:21.948 --> 04:56:21.958 align:start position:0%
then you have for smoking a joint
 
04:56:21.958 --> 04:56:24.050 align:start position:0%
then you have for smoking a joint
okay

04:56:24.050 --> 04:56:24.060 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:56:24.060 --> 04:56:25.970 align:start position:0%
okay
cigarettes

04:56:25.970 --> 04:56:25.980 align:start position:0%
cigarettes
 
04:56:28.070 --> 04:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
go back to that one
 
04:56:30.708 --> 04:56:30.718 align:start position:0%
if you took a smoker
 
04:56:33.470 --> 04:56:33.480 align:start position:0%
let's say they smoke a pack or two a day
 
04:56:35.570 --> 04:56:35.580 align:start position:0%
and you put them in a situation where
 
04:56:38.150 --> 04:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
they cannot have a cigarette
 
04:56:39.890 --> 04:56:39.900 align:start position:0%
you've watched them
 
04:56:41.628 --> 04:56:41.638 align:start position:0%
they become antsy they've become
 
04:56:44.570 --> 04:56:44.580 align:start position:0%
irritable they become
 
04:56:47.208 --> 04:56:47.218 align:start position:0%
outright I need to move out and have my
 
04:56:47.218 --> 04:56:48.590 align:start position:0%
outright I need to move out and have my
cigarette

04:56:48.590 --> 04:56:48.600 align:start position:0%
cigarette
 
04:56:48.600 --> 04:56:50.208 align:start position:0%
cigarette
okay

04:56:50.208 --> 04:56:50.218 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:56:53.510 --> 04:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
I have not seen anybody I you know yeah
 
04:56:55.430 --> 04:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
you can tell I've been around a few
 
04:56:55.440 --> 04:56:56.510 align:start position:0%
you can tell I've been around a few
years

04:56:56.510 --> 04:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:57:00.230 --> 04:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
and I've never seen anybody go
 
04:57:02.810 --> 04:57:02.820 align:start position:0%
I need to go have a joint
 
04:57:05.390 --> 04:57:05.400 align:start position:0%
you know they go home they enjoy
 
04:57:07.850 --> 04:57:07.860 align:start position:0%
themselves they listen to music they
 
04:57:11.030 --> 04:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
watch hopefully not the news
 
04:57:14.510 --> 04:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
and they relax
 
04:57:16.550 --> 04:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
if you're looking around the states that
 
04:57:19.430 --> 04:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
are around us we're the island
 
04:57:22.670 --> 04:57:22.680 align:start position:0%
within everybody else moving on
 
04:57:25.128 --> 04:57:25.138 align:start position:0%
they have more live free
 
04:57:27.050 --> 04:57:27.060 align:start position:0%
than we do
 
04:57:29.448 --> 04:57:29.458 align:start position:0%
okay and the other problem it creates is
 
04:57:34.190 --> 04:57:34.200 align:start position:0%
as a resident of New Hampshire if you
 
04:57:37.128 --> 04:57:37.138 align:start position:0%
cross the state line you're now breaking
 
04:57:39.830 --> 04:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
another law if you go and get your pot
 
04:57:41.930 --> 04:57:41.940 align:start position:0%
and bring it over to State Line you
 
04:57:45.350 --> 04:57:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:48.948 --> 04:57:48.958 align:start position:0%
so does that really make sense to
 
04:57:50.868 --> 04:57:50.878 align:start position:0%
criminalize people
 
04:57:53.270 --> 04:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
for something
 
04:57:57.230 --> 04:57:57.240 align:start position:0%
that if you go back to the history of it
 
04:57:59.570 --> 04:57:59.580 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have never been illegalized
 
04:57:59.580 --> 04:58:01.070 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have never been illegalized
anyway

04:58:01.070 --> 04:58:01.080 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
04:58:04.730 --> 04:58:04.740 align:start position:0%
it was brought on by a rope company
 
04:58:07.970 --> 04:58:07.980 align:start position:0%
because the plant was used for rope
 
04:58:10.128 --> 04:58:10.138 align:start position:0%
and then the alcohol business got on
 
04:58:14.030 --> 04:58:14.040 align:start position:0%
board because it was a cheaper way
 
04:58:17.390 --> 04:58:17.400 align:start position:0%
for people that enjoy themselves than it
 
04:58:20.930 --> 04:58:20.940 align:start position:0%
was for being having to go booze and
 
04:58:20.940 --> 04:58:22.310 align:start position:0%
was for being having to go booze and
so

04:58:22.310 --> 04:58:22.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:58:24.830 --> 04:58:24.840 align:start position:0%
it's common sense
 
04:58:28.310 --> 04:58:28.320 align:start position:0%
we're continually taking our youth
 
04:58:31.430 --> 04:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
and I I Fair say most of you in here
 
04:58:33.830 --> 04:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
have had a youth where you've sat and
 
04:58:36.890 --> 04:58:36.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:39.708 --> 04:58:39.718 align:start position:0%
questionable and you had to question
 
04:58:42.170 --> 04:58:42.180 align:start position:0%
yourself later in life
 
04:58:45.650 --> 04:58:45.660 align:start position:0%
was that stupid I don't know
 
04:58:49.010 --> 04:58:49.020 align:start position:0%
it's part of what makes you you
 
04:58:51.770 --> 04:58:51.780 align:start position:0%
know so
 
04:58:54.770 --> 04:58:54.780 align:start position:0%
the legalization of this is only the
 
04:58:56.810 --> 04:58:56.820 align:start position:0%
next step of the evolution of our
 
04:58:56.820 --> 04:58:58.010 align:start position:0%
next step of the evolution of our
society

04:58:58.010 --> 04:58:58.020 align:start position:0%
society
 
04:58:59.570 --> 04:58:59.580 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:59:02.750 --> 04:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
you can look at the numbers for alcohol
 
04:59:04.670 --> 04:59:04.680 align:start position:0%
the cells in New Hampshire are going
 
04:59:04.680 --> 04:59:06.230 align:start position:0%
the cells in New Hampshire are going
down

04:59:06.230 --> 04:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
down
 
04:59:06.240 --> 04:59:09.110 align:start position:0%
down
why

04:59:09.110 --> 04:59:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:11.270 --> 04:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
who knows you would expect it to be at
 
04:59:14.330 --> 04:59:14.340 align:start position:0%
least flatter going up but
 
04:59:16.970 --> 04:59:16.980 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
04:59:19.850 --> 04:59:19.860 align:start position:0%
so our people to find another way to
 
04:59:23.150 --> 04:59:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:25.430 --> 04:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
if people are allowed to live their
 
04:59:27.470 --> 04:59:27.480 align:start position:0%
lives responsibly
 
04:59:29.110 --> 04:59:29.120 align:start position:0%
people will
 
04:59:32.330 --> 04:59:32.340 align:start position:0%
responsibly live their lives
 
04:59:35.030 --> 04:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
the greater majority
 
04:59:38.390 --> 04:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
and I I can't speak for the less than
 
04:59:41.810 --> 04:59:41.820 align:start position:0%
because that's the problem in society
 
04:59:45.230 --> 04:59:45.240 align:start position:0%
not everybody
 
04:59:46.910 --> 04:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
is able to that's why you have
 
04:59:46.920 --> 04:59:48.350 align:start position:0%
is able to that's why you have
alcoholism

04:59:48.350 --> 04:59:48.360 align:start position:0%
alcoholism
 
04:59:50.830 --> 04:59:50.840 align:start position:0%
it's a smaller percent not everybody
 
04:59:54.050 --> 04:59:54.060 align:start position:0%
enjoys a scotch when they go home or a
 
04:59:58.190 --> 04:59:58.200 align:start position:0%
cold beer are they alcoholics no
 
05:00:01.570 --> 05:00:01.580 align:start position:0%
so if someone goes home and enjoys
 
05:00:04.368 --> 05:00:04.378 align:start position:0%
an edible or whatever it is they call
 
05:00:07.128 --> 05:00:07.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:09.650 --> 05:00:09.660 align:start position:0%
and doesn't do anything else
 
05:00:12.890 --> 05:00:12.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:16.368 --> 05:00:16.378 align:start position:0%
I would say Common Sense would say none
 
05:00:18.470 --> 05:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
you're tying up all your public service
 
05:00:21.050 --> 05:00:21.060 align:start position:0%
forces tracking down people making
 
05:00:21.060 --> 05:00:22.430 align:start position:0%
forces tracking down people making
criminals

05:00:22.430 --> 05:00:22.440 align:start position:0%
criminals
 
05:00:24.410 --> 05:00:24.420 align:start position:0%
out of people who are doing nothing but
 
05:00:27.110 --> 05:00:27.120 align:start position:0%
exercising their right to live free in
 
05:00:31.490 --> 05:00:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:37.310 --> 05:00:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:37.320 --> 05:00:43.550 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:00:43.550 --> 05:00:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:47.390 --> 05:00:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:47.400 --> 05:00:48.650 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:00:48.650 --> 05:00:48.660 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:00:48.660 --> 05:00:50.270 align:start position:0%
okay
sorry

05:00:50.270 --> 05:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
05:00:53.930 --> 05:00:53.940 align:start position:0%
so with alcohol there's a way to tell if
 
05:00:56.510 --> 05:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
you're over the limit and
 
05:00:59.208 --> 05:00:59.218 align:start position:0%
unable to drive is there a test for
 
05:01:01.670 --> 05:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
marijuana or cannabis
 
05:01:04.430 --> 05:01:04.440 align:start position:0%
my understanding currently there is not
 
05:01:07.850 --> 05:01:07.860 align:start position:0%
a test but they are already looking at
 
05:01:09.890 --> 05:01:09.900 align:start position:0%
it there were some promising stuff
 
05:01:11.570 --> 05:01:11.580 align:start position:0%
coming out of Canada
 
05:01:16.128 --> 05:01:16.138 align:start position:0%
for testing of that
 
05:01:18.770 --> 05:01:18.780 align:start position:0%
but currently I believe there is no way
 
05:01:22.190 --> 05:01:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:23.510 --> 05:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
I'm good
 
05:01:24.708 --> 05:01:24.718 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:01:27.590 --> 05:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
representative silly
 
05:01:29.030 --> 05:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
05:01:31.070 --> 05:01:31.080 align:start position:0%
my question representative
 
05:01:35.090 --> 05:01:35.100 align:start position:0%
um we heard this morning we heard HB 643
 
05:01:36.530 --> 05:01:36.540 align:start position:0%
which was also about legalizing
 
05:01:39.770 --> 05:01:39.780 align:start position:0%
marijuana but it was also in favor of
 
05:01:42.770 --> 05:01:42.780 align:start position:0%
creating State stores for the sale of it
 
05:01:44.930 --> 05:01:44.940 align:start position:0%
that would then be regulated much the
 
05:01:46.490 --> 05:01:46.500 align:start position:0%
way that New Hampshire regulates alcohol
 
05:01:46.500 --> 05:01:47.930 align:start position:0%
way that New Hampshire regulates alcohol
sales

05:01:47.930 --> 05:01:47.940 align:start position:0%
sales
 
05:01:50.330 --> 05:01:50.340 align:start position:0%
I'm curious in your opinion whether you
 
05:01:52.368 --> 05:01:52.378 align:start position:0%
think just completely decriminalizing it
 
05:01:54.288 --> 05:01:54.298 align:start position:0%
so anyone can
 
05:01:56.810 --> 05:01:56.820 align:start position:0%
grow it sell it distribute it without
 
05:02:00.110 --> 05:02:00.120 align:start position:0%
any regulation is the better choice or
 
05:02:02.570 --> 05:02:02.580 align:start position:0%
whether you think having some form of
 
05:02:05.330 --> 05:02:05.340 align:start position:0%
structure to ensure the safety and
 
05:02:07.550 --> 05:02:07.560 align:start position:0%
purity of the product is better
 
05:02:07.560 --> 05:02:09.288 align:start position:0%
purity of the product is better
well

05:02:09.288 --> 05:02:09.298 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:02:11.628 --> 05:02:11.638 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
05:02:13.730 --> 05:02:13.740 align:start position:0%
that's a double-edged sword
 
05:02:16.788 --> 05:02:16.798 align:start position:0%
as one might say because you're getting
 
05:02:18.948 --> 05:02:18.958 align:start position:0%
rid of regulations and
 
05:02:21.830 --> 05:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
creating regulations I do believe a
 
05:02:23.930 --> 05:02:23.940 align:start position:0%
Gentleman Just earlier
 
05:02:26.868 --> 05:02:26.878 align:start position:0%
indicated it's a plan so how do you
 
05:02:29.510 --> 05:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
regulate someone growing something in
 
05:02:31.190 --> 05:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
their house
 
05:02:34.550 --> 05:02:34.560 align:start position:0%
okay are they doing something wrong if
 
05:02:39.350 --> 05:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
they grew a tomato plant in their house
 
05:02:41.930 --> 05:02:41.940 align:start position:0%
would anybody care
 
05:02:44.090 --> 05:02:44.100 align:start position:0%
as long as they're not selling Tomatoes
 
05:02:47.150 --> 05:02:47.160 align:start position:0%
unless there are farmer or something
 
05:02:50.208 --> 05:02:50.218 align:start position:0%
so I would look at it this way if you
 
05:02:51.948 --> 05:02:51.958 align:start position:0%
want to regulate it and put it in the
 
05:02:54.170 --> 05:02:54.180 align:start position:0%
store so that you can see it
 
05:02:56.330 --> 05:02:56.340 align:start position:0%
you can look at it as a cell in a bottle
 
05:02:58.430 --> 05:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
of wine you could look at that as
 
05:03:01.788 --> 05:03:01.798 align:start position:0%
selling beer you sell beer and wine
 
05:03:05.330 --> 05:03:05.340 align:start position:0%
with the regulations there set forth in
 
05:03:07.190 --> 05:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
in all the stores
 
05:03:11.868 --> 05:03:11.878 align:start position:0%
so you sell we contain the liquor to the
 
05:03:13.190 --> 05:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
liquor stores
 
05:03:15.170 --> 05:03:15.180 align:start position:0%
all right so if you wanted to make it a
 
05:03:17.270 --> 05:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
little room off the decide to the liquor
 
05:03:20.770 --> 05:03:20.780 align:start position:0%
store I don't think anybody cares
 
05:03:23.810 --> 05:03:23.820 align:start position:0%
it might be financially beneficial to do
 
05:03:25.910 --> 05:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
it that way for the state because then
 
05:03:29.150 --> 05:03:29.160 align:start position:0%
they can tax it and maybe make up for
 
05:03:30.890 --> 05:03:30.900 align:start position:0%
some of the revenue loss that we're
 
05:03:33.610 --> 05:03:33.620 align:start position:0%
starting to see as as as
 
05:03:37.550 --> 05:03:37.560 align:start position:0%
people's choices are starting to change
 
05:03:40.128 --> 05:03:40.138 align:start position:0%
and how they live their lives and stuff
 
05:03:42.410 --> 05:03:42.420 align:start position:0%
so you know that's a way of creating
 
05:03:45.470 --> 05:03:45.480 align:start position:0%
some Revenue if someone chooses but I
 
05:03:49.430 --> 05:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:51.170 --> 05:03:51.180 align:start position:0%
you're going to find people are going to
 
05:03:54.470 --> 05:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
want to probably grow their own for our
 
05:03:57.708 --> 05:03:57.718 align:start position:0%
own their own plant and stuff
 
05:04:01.070 --> 05:04:01.080 align:start position:0%
um so you can look at that as someone
 
05:04:04.610 --> 05:04:04.620 align:start position:0%
making a brewery they make uh what is a
 
05:04:06.590 --> 05:04:06.600 align:start position:0%
hundred gallons a year or something I'm
 
05:04:09.770 --> 05:04:09.780 align:start position:0%
not quite sure but there's some similar
 
05:04:12.670 --> 05:04:12.680 align:start position:0%
type regulations for that
 
05:04:14.930 --> 05:04:14.940 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I did not get an
 
05:04:17.930 --> 05:04:17.940 align:start position:0%
opportunity to hear the bill because I
 
05:04:19.670 --> 05:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
was across the street
 
05:04:23.570 --> 05:04:23.580 align:start position:0%
in another session but uh
 
05:04:26.030 --> 05:04:26.040 align:start position:0%
and I haven't fully read this one and I
 
05:04:28.788 --> 05:04:28.798 align:start position:0%
do apologize for that but I did want to
 
05:04:32.208 --> 05:04:32.218 align:start position:0%
make the point that there's a point in
 
05:04:32.218 --> 05:04:33.050 align:start position:0%
make the point that there's a point in
time

05:04:33.050 --> 05:04:33.060 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:04:38.208 --> 05:04:38.218 align:start position:0%
that we just got to start moving forward
 
05:04:41.510 --> 05:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
okay the workforce we see our
 
05:04:44.448 --> 05:04:44.458 align:start position:0%
unemployment is 2.6 percent
 
05:04:44.458 --> 05:04:45.770 align:start position:0%
unemployment is 2.6 percent
okay

05:04:45.770 --> 05:04:45.780 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:04:48.530 --> 05:04:48.540 align:start position:0%
I used to be in retail in trying to get
 
05:04:51.350 --> 05:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
someone with a background check once
 
05:04:54.050 --> 05:04:54.060 align:start position:0%
you've gotten arrested for something
 
05:04:57.110 --> 05:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
silly you can't get a job
 
05:04:59.208 --> 05:04:59.218 align:start position:0%
so now you're regulated to be in
 
05:05:02.868 --> 05:05:02.878 align:start position:0%
dishwashers and whatnot and what kind of
 
05:05:02.878 --> 05:05:04.550 align:start position:0%
dishwashers and whatnot and what kind of
contribution

05:05:04.550 --> 05:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
contribution
 
05:05:06.590 --> 05:05:06.600 align:start position:0%
is that
 
05:05:10.730 --> 05:05:10.740 align:start position:0%
to society or to your own family you can
 
05:05:13.250 --> 05:05:13.260 align:start position:0%
okay and all they're doing is doing
 
05:05:15.770 --> 05:05:15.780 align:start position:0%
something they feel is their personal
 
05:05:18.288 --> 05:05:18.298 align:start position:0%
right to doing their home I'm not
 
05:05:18.298 --> 05:05:19.970 align:start position:0%
right to doing their home I'm not
excusing

05:05:19.970 --> 05:05:19.980 align:start position:0%
excusing
 
05:05:22.010 --> 05:05:22.020 align:start position:0%
smoking in your car driving down the
 
05:05:24.830 --> 05:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
road by no means am I saying that
 
05:05:27.708 --> 05:05:27.718 align:start position:0%
because once again the greater greater
 
05:05:31.070 --> 05:05:31.080 align:start position:0%
majority is not there to do that
 
05:05:34.730 --> 05:05:34.740 align:start position:0%
but if we looked at it as drinking
 
05:05:37.128 --> 05:05:37.138 align:start position:0%
we read the newspaper every day it don't
 
05:05:39.890 --> 05:05:39.900 align:start position:0%
need statistics the newspaper spells it
 
05:05:42.110 --> 05:05:42.120 align:start position:0%
out in the arrest log how many people
 
05:05:46.070 --> 05:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
are arrested for drinking and driving
 
05:05:46.080 --> 05:05:47.390 align:start position:0%
are arrested for drinking and driving
okay

05:05:47.390 --> 05:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:05:50.090 --> 05:05:50.100 align:start position:0%
how many people have you seen that have
 
05:05:53.510 --> 05:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
been arrested for something else
 
05:05:57.050 --> 05:05:57.060 align:start position:0%
not as many I'm sure there are some not
 
05:05:59.510 --> 05:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
going to say there's none
 
05:06:01.310 --> 05:06:01.320 align:start position:0%
but once again
 
05:06:04.250 --> 05:06:04.260 align:start position:0%
as we grow we got to start taking the
 
05:06:07.310 --> 05:06:07.320 align:start position:0%
baby steps to get there
 
05:06:11.030 --> 05:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
did that help you with that question
 
05:06:15.110 --> 05:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:16.910 --> 05:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
05:06:20.208 --> 05:06:20.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:21.890 --> 05:06:21.900 align:start position:0%
and with that I'm going to close the
 
05:06:27.910 --> 05:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:27.920 --> 05:06:29.448 align:start position:0%
 
360.

05:06:29.448 --> 05:06:29.458 align:start position:0%
360.
 
05:06:33.590 --> 05:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
and open the public hearing on hb3
 
05:06:35.510 --> 05:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
no actually an online
 
05:06:37.190 --> 05:06:37.200 align:start position:0%
I got 10 minutes we'll be in recess
 
05:06:39.110 --> 05:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
until 2 15.
 
05:06:39.120 --> 05:07:29.208 align:start position:0%
until 2 15.

05:19:29.750 --> 05:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
but in this type of case the lieutenant
 
05:19:31.670 --> 05:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
says you know maybe we should refer it
 
05:19:34.970 --> 05:19:34.980 align:start position:0%
to the police department I says no you
 
05:19:37.010 --> 05:19:37.020 align:start position:0%
know but when the police officer did
 
05:19:39.288 --> 05:19:39.298 align:start position:0%
show up I explained to him what we had
 
05:19:42.350 --> 05:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
discovered and he says appreciate it and
 
05:19:44.448 --> 05:19:44.458 align:start position:0%
you know chose not to
 
05:19:47.448 --> 05:19:47.458 align:start position:0%
react to it but however common state law
 
05:19:47.458 --> 05:19:49.010 align:start position:0%
react to it but however common state law
says

05:19:49.010 --> 05:19:49.020 align:start position:0%
says
 
05:19:51.410 --> 05:19:51.420 align:start position:0%
technically it is against the law to
 
05:19:54.170 --> 05:19:54.180 align:start position:0%
have immature plants I mean we did make
 
05:19:56.330 --> 05:19:56.340 align:start position:0%
the law to says you can have up to three
 
05:19:59.448 --> 05:19:59.458 align:start position:0%
quarters of an ounce but to grow it
 
05:20:03.830 --> 05:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
it is not current so this will allow the
 
05:20:05.690 --> 05:20:05.700 align:start position:0%
consumer or the person for every
 
05:20:07.070 --> 05:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
particular reason the people with
 
05:20:10.010 --> 05:20:10.020 align:start position:0%
glaucoma other things you know my bones
 
05:20:12.948 --> 05:20:12.958 align:start position:0%
are aching myself and I finally Traverse
 
05:20:14.750 --> 05:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
into being an old man but I will not
 
05:20:17.208 --> 05:20:17.218 align:start position:0%
admit it you know because I don't act it
 
05:20:20.510 --> 05:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
but the thing is for those people that
 
05:20:22.368 --> 05:20:22.378 align:start position:0%
would want it for medicinal purposes
 
05:20:24.650 --> 05:20:24.660 align:start position:0%
this allows them to grow on their own
 
05:20:26.990 --> 05:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
and I come from Nashua and I think that
 
05:20:29.930 --> 05:20:29.940 align:start position:0%
representative Kathryn can testify and
 
05:20:32.030 --> 05:20:32.040 align:start position:0%
for those of us who live close to the
 
05:20:32.040 --> 05:20:33.050 align:start position:0%
for those of us who live close to the
borders

05:20:33.050 --> 05:20:33.060 align:start position:0%
borders
 
05:20:34.970 --> 05:20:34.980 align:start position:0%
that in Nashville and one does not have
 
05:20:38.448 --> 05:20:38.458 align:start position:0%
to go very very far to pick up cannabis
 
05:20:40.250 --> 05:20:40.260 align:start position:0%
you know you just go over the line into
 
05:20:42.110 --> 05:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
things well it doesn't seem to be any
 
05:20:44.930 --> 05:20:44.940 align:start position:0%
you know on gods or people at the border
 
05:20:46.788 --> 05:20:46.798 align:start position:0%
or anything else like that so it's more
 
05:20:49.430 --> 05:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
like a choice I think this is a wise
 
05:20:52.250 --> 05:20:52.260 align:start position:0%
decision it's a small amount I think it
 
05:20:54.730 --> 05:20:54.740 align:start position:0%
encompasses something like uh only three
 
05:20:58.190 --> 05:20:58.200 align:start position:0%
immature plants and I think it's well
 
05:21:01.190 --> 05:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
worth to try to see
 
05:21:03.830 --> 05:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
worth having it and see if it fits
 
05:21:05.990 --> 05:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
within the needs of the community and
 
05:21:07.788 --> 05:21:07.798 align:start position:0%
for that I'll end it at that and
 
05:21:15.230 --> 05:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:23.990 --> 05:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:26.868 --> 05:21:26.878 align:start position:0%
she recognizes Frank knack
 
05:21:29.330 --> 05:21:29.340 align:start position:0%
I don't think he's in here oh there he
 
05:21:29.340 --> 05:21:53.390 align:start position:0%
I don't think he's in here oh there he
is

05:21:53.390 --> 05:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:56.030 --> 05:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
that on sorry Mr chairman members of the
 
05:21:56.930 --> 05:21:56.940 align:start position:0%
committee thank you so much for the
 
05:21:58.430 --> 05:21:58.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify my name is Frank

cunack I'm policy director with the ACLU
 
05:22:02.750 --> 05:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and we're here in
 
05:22:06.770 --> 05:22:06.780 align:start position:0%
strong support of HB 344.
 
05:22:08.208 --> 05:22:08.218 align:start position:0%
um our support for marijuana
 
05:22:10.550 --> 05:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
legalization in this bill in particular
 
05:22:12.830 --> 05:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
is really through two lenses one is harm
 
05:22:14.990 --> 05:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
reduction one is racial Justice
 
05:22:16.430 --> 05:22:16.440 align:start position:0%
and starting with the racial Justice
 
05:22:18.590 --> 05:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
lens so marijuana is the quintessential
 
05:22:19.788 --> 05:22:19.798 align:start position:0%
issue to kind of look at race
 
05:22:21.830 --> 05:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
disparities because we know from
 
05:22:23.510 --> 05:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
substantial research that black people
 
05:22:25.610 --> 05:22:25.620 align:start position:0%
and white people use marijuana up to the
 
05:22:27.110 --> 05:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
same rates and so we can have Apples to
 
05:22:28.910 --> 05:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
Apples comparison about what what's
 
05:22:32.830 --> 05:22:32.840 align:start position:0%
happening underground in our communities
 
05:22:32.840 --> 05:22:34.368 align:start position:0%
happening underground in our communities
and

05:22:34.368 --> 05:22:34.378 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:22:36.530 --> 05:22:36.540 align:start position:0%
nationally so ACLU has done a number of
 
05:22:38.330 --> 05:22:38.340 align:start position:0%
studies on this National looking at FBI
 
05:22:40.970 --> 05:22:40.980 align:start position:0%
UCR data so this is official data given
 
05:22:44.330 --> 05:22:44.340 align:start position:0%
to the FBI that we've analyzed and so
 
05:22:46.788 --> 05:22:46.798 align:start position:0%
nationally black people are 3.6 times
 
05:22:48.650 --> 05:22:48.660 align:start position:0%
more likely to be arrested for marijuana
 
05:22:50.810 --> 05:22:50.820 align:start position:0%
possessions than white people in New
 
05:22:53.330 --> 05:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it is substantially higher 4.6
 
05:22:55.128 --> 05:22:55.138 align:start position:0%
times more likely to be arrested for
 
05:22:57.770 --> 05:22:57.780 align:start position:0%
marijuana possessions than white people
 
05:22:59.390 --> 05:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
um so this is from a kind of a
 
05:23:01.610 --> 05:23:01.620 align:start position:0%
quintessential race disparity issue and
 
05:23:03.170 --> 05:23:03.180 align:start position:0%
when you think about it in the kind of
 
05:23:04.910 --> 05:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
collateral harms and how those impact
 
05:23:06.470 --> 05:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
commercial wealth provide this is a
 
05:23:07.970 --> 05:23:07.980 align:start position:0%
great opportunity for us to start to
 
05:23:10.430 --> 05:23:10.440 align:start position:0%
repair the historical Harms
 
05:23:12.230 --> 05:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
um that our history has had
 
05:23:13.310 --> 05:23:13.320 align:start position:0%
um particularly in black and brown
 
05:23:14.750 --> 05:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
community members
 
05:23:16.250 --> 05:23:16.260 align:start position:0%
I think it's really also important from
 
05:23:17.690 --> 05:23:17.700 align:start position:0%
a harm reduction lens to look at this
 
05:23:19.670 --> 05:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
issue so when we passed uh
 
05:23:21.350 --> 05:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
decriminalization a few years back you
 
05:23:22.730 --> 05:23:22.740 align:start position:0%
know there's this thought process that
 
05:23:24.288 --> 05:23:24.298 align:start position:0%
no one is going to jail for marijuana
 
05:23:26.690 --> 05:23:26.700 align:start position:0%
anymore and while there be well there
 
05:23:28.310 --> 05:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
may be very few people going to jail for
 
05:23:31.310 --> 05:23:31.320 align:start position:0%
marijuana people can still get arrested
 
05:23:32.510 --> 05:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
for marijuana possession and people
 
05:23:33.948 --> 05:23:33.958 align:start position:0%
still are getting arrested for marijuana
 
05:23:36.470 --> 05:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
possession so again looking at FBI UCR
 
05:23:40.070 --> 05:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
data cited in our fact sheet over 1100
 
05:23:41.448 --> 05:23:41.458 align:start position:0%
people were arrested for a simple
 
05:23:43.070 --> 05:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
possession of marijuana last year alone
 
05:23:44.868 --> 05:23:44.878 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and so as we talked
 
05:23:46.190 --> 05:23:46.200 align:start position:0%
about earlier with collateral
 
05:23:48.530 --> 05:23:48.540 align:start position:0%
consequences even a misdemeanor
 
05:23:50.868 --> 05:23:50.878 align:start position:0%
Marijuana arrest has severe cuddle
 
05:23:53.448 --> 05:23:53.458 align:start position:0%
consequences including 99 mandatory
 
05:23:55.490 --> 05:23:55.500 align:start position:0%
collateral consequences that attach to
 
05:23:57.110 --> 05:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
it and so it impacts you know your
 
05:24:00.170 --> 05:24:00.180 align:start position:0%
ability to get housing to get employment
 
05:24:02.570 --> 05:24:02.580 align:start position:0%
Etc and it's something that's unhelpful
 
05:24:05.510 --> 05:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
in Ruins lives and also I'd like to talk
 
05:24:07.670 --> 05:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
about a few of the the concerns we've
 
05:24:10.550 --> 05:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
heard raised from from others currently
 
05:24:12.830 --> 05:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
opposed to this effort and so there's
 
05:24:14.810 --> 05:24:14.820 align:start position:0%
been a lot of talk about how marijuana
 
05:24:17.270 --> 05:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
legalization has somehow increased youth
 
05:24:19.670 --> 05:24:19.680 align:start position:0%
use in states where it is legalized and
 
05:24:20.868 --> 05:24:20.878 align:start position:0%
so again I think it's really important
 
05:24:23.330 --> 05:24:23.340 align:start position:0%
to look at what study academic
 
05:24:24.890 --> 05:24:24.900 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed Studies have found so this
 
05:24:26.270 --> 05:24:26.280 align:start position:0%
is a study from the Journal of the
 
05:24:28.610 --> 05:24:28.620 align:start position:0%
American Medical Association looking at
 
05:24:30.470 --> 05:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
youth use in states that have legalized
 
05:24:33.110 --> 05:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
and so here according to that study
 
05:24:35.208 --> 05:24:35.218 align:start position:0%
recreational marijuana laws were
 
05:24:36.708 --> 05:24:36.718 align:start position:0%
associated with an eight percent
 
05:24:38.930 --> 05:24:38.940 align:start position:0%
decrease in the odds of marijuana use
 
05:24:41.448 --> 05:24:41.458 align:start position:0%
and a nine percent decrease in the odds
 
05:24:44.030 --> 05:24:44.040 align:start position:0%
of frequent marijuana use by youth and
 
05:24:45.890 --> 05:24:45.900 align:start position:0%
so this tracks with other research that
 
05:24:47.868 --> 05:24:47.878 align:start position:0%
has shown that there's been no uptick in
 
05:24:49.250 --> 05:24:49.260 align:start position:0%
marijuana use
 
05:24:51.230 --> 05:24:51.240 align:start position:0%
um uh among youth in states that have
 
05:24:53.150 --> 05:24:53.160 align:start position:0%
legalized another issue is traffic
 
05:24:55.670 --> 05:24:55.680 align:start position:0%
fatalities and so again looking at the
 
05:24:57.230 --> 05:24:57.240 align:start position:0%
research from other states there has
 
05:24:59.090 --> 05:24:59.100 align:start position:0%
been quote little to no effect unquote
 
05:25:01.368 --> 05:25:01.378 align:start position:0%
on traffic fatalities and accidents in
 
05:25:02.690 --> 05:25:02.700 align:start position:0%
other states
 
05:25:04.910 --> 05:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
we've also heard about the opioid crisis
 
05:25:06.470 --> 05:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
which is a very real problem as we
 
05:25:08.270 --> 05:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
talked about in the last bill there are
 
05:25:09.470 --> 05:25:09.480 align:start position:0%
a few bills ago
 
05:25:11.390 --> 05:25:11.400 align:start position:0%
we have really good Solutions in this
 
05:25:12.590 --> 05:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
committee this year and in this body
 
05:25:15.590 --> 05:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
this year around drug testing kits uh
 
05:25:18.170 --> 05:25:18.180 align:start position:0%
but evidence suggests that marijuana
 
05:25:20.090 --> 05:25:20.100 align:start position:0%
legalization is connected with reduction
 
05:25:22.128 --> 05:25:22.138 align:start position:0%
in opioid related deaths and so this
 
05:25:24.470 --> 05:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
again is a tool for addressing as we
 
05:25:27.110 --> 05:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
heard I think in earlier testimony it is
 
05:25:29.208 --> 05:25:29.218 align:start position:0%
an alternative uh to reducing opioid
 
05:25:31.550 --> 05:25:31.560 align:start position:0%
harm in our communities
 
05:25:32.690 --> 05:25:32.700 align:start position:0%
um and finally
 
05:25:34.310 --> 05:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
um you know there's been a there's been
 
05:25:35.510 --> 05:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of talk
 
05:25:38.628 --> 05:25:38.638 align:start position:0%
um of crime and how legalizing marijuana
 
05:25:41.448 --> 05:25:41.458 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire would lead to an uptick
 
05:25:42.530 --> 05:25:42.540 align:start position:0%
in crime
 
05:25:44.810 --> 05:25:44.820 align:start position:0%
and so again looking at the facts which
 
05:25:45.890 --> 05:25:45.900 align:start position:0%
we think are important we heard
 
05:25:48.530 --> 05:25:48.540 align:start position:0%
testimony from the Chiefs last year that
 
05:25:50.690 --> 05:25:50.700 align:start position:0%
when marijuana legalization began in
 
05:25:52.610 --> 05:25:52.620 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and then you know went on
 
05:25:54.770 --> 05:25:54.780 align:start position:0%
to Maine and Vermont that we had a
 
05:25:56.510 --> 05:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
spillover affecting crime in New
 
05:25:58.490 --> 05:25:58.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so again we have the benefit
 
05:25:59.990 --> 05:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
of actually going through the data and
 
05:26:01.430 --> 05:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
seeing what's actually happening and so
 
05:26:03.530 --> 05:26:03.540 align:start position:0%
we did we looked at what happened and
 
05:26:05.330 --> 05:26:05.340 align:start position:0%
then we looked at um State Department of
 
05:26:09.230 --> 05:26:09.240 align:start position:0%
Safety crime stats between 2006 16 which
 
05:26:11.628 --> 05:26:11.638 align:start position:0%
is the year Maine legalized in 2021
 
05:26:13.190 --> 05:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
which is the most current year available
 
05:26:16.430 --> 05:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
of full data crime is done 26 in New
 
05:26:18.288 --> 05:26:18.298 align:start position:0%
Hampshire during that time and so this
 
05:26:19.910 --> 05:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
notion that there's been spillover crime
 
05:26:22.070 --> 05:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
again is not you know based in any
 
05:26:24.650 --> 05:26:24.660 align:start position:0%
reality or based in any data
 
05:26:26.150 --> 05:26:26.160 align:start position:0%
um happy to answer any questions and
 
05:26:30.948 --> 05:26:30.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:33.230 --> 05:26:33.240 align:start position:0%
represent men
 
05:26:34.730 --> 05:26:34.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
05:26:36.410 --> 05:26:36.420 align:start position:0%
taking my question you spoke
 
05:26:39.530 --> 05:26:39.540 align:start position:0%
specifically about youth use and I don't
 
05:26:42.110 --> 05:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
know unless I'm reading this wrong
 
05:26:44.448 --> 05:26:44.458 align:start position:0%
this bill would essentially make it will
 
05:26:46.430 --> 05:26:46.440 align:start position:0%
decriminalize the use of marijuana for
 
05:26:48.890 --> 05:26:48.900 align:start position:0%
those under the age of 21 and for those
 
05:26:50.270 --> 05:26:50.280 align:start position:0%
that want to reference it it's on page
 
05:26:50.280 --> 05:26:51.050 align:start position:0%
that want to reference it it's on page
three

05:26:51.050 --> 05:26:51.060 align:start position:0%
three
 
05:26:53.270 --> 05:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
line 20-25
 
05:26:55.128 --> 05:26:55.138 align:start position:0%
where it makes it a violation for those
 
05:26:57.708 --> 05:26:57.718 align:start position:0%
under 21 to normally possess three
 
05:27:00.050 --> 05:27:00.060 align:start position:0%
quarters of an ounce I just wanted to
 
05:27:07.788 --> 05:27:07.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:10.310 --> 05:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
so it is still a violation and again
 
05:27:12.590 --> 05:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
looking at the stats from states that
 
05:27:14.510 --> 05:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
have gone from legalization we have not
 
05:27:16.128 --> 05:27:16.138 align:start position:0%
seen an uptick so again this is where
 
05:27:17.090 --> 05:27:17.100 align:start position:0%
it's really important from our
 
05:27:18.650 --> 05:27:18.660 align:start position:0%
perspective that we engage in robust
 
05:27:20.868 --> 05:27:20.878 align:start position:0%
public education because we're not here
 
05:27:22.910 --> 05:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
saying that marijuana use is harmless
 
05:27:25.490 --> 05:27:25.500 align:start position:0%
it's not but criminalizing marijuana use
 
05:27:27.350 --> 05:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
which is what we're currently doing and
 
05:27:29.330 --> 05:27:29.340 align:start position:0%
giving people criminal records and you
 
05:27:30.470 --> 05:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
know putting them putting all these
 
05:27:31.670 --> 05:27:31.680 align:start position:0%
unnecessary hurdles in front of people
 
05:27:34.310 --> 05:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
is problematic and so we would
 
05:27:36.350 --> 05:27:36.360 align:start position:0%
absolutely support robust public
 
05:27:38.330 --> 05:27:38.340 align:start position:0%
education efforts not only for marijuana
 
05:27:40.128 --> 05:27:40.138 align:start position:0%
but for all drugs and to move towards a
 
05:27:42.530 --> 05:27:42.540 align:start position:0%
harm reduction lens approach to to
 
05:27:47.868 --> 05:27:47.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:50.628 --> 05:27:50.638 align:start position:0%
represent Boulder
 
05:27:52.430 --> 05:27:52.440 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
05:27:52.440 --> 05:27:55.368 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
question

05:27:55.368 --> 05:27:55.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:57.288 --> 05:27:57.298 align:start position:0%
either I misunderstood you or maybe you
 
05:27:58.490 --> 05:27:58.500 align:start position:0%
misspoke and I was hoping you could
 
05:28:00.410 --> 05:28:00.420 align:start position:0%
speak to it again what were you saying
 
05:28:02.050 --> 05:28:02.060 align:start position:0%
was the difference between
 
05:28:05.570 --> 05:28:05.580 align:start position:0%
pre-2016 and post 2016 and I think you
 
05:28:07.250 --> 05:28:07.260 align:start position:0%
said that's when we legalized but that's
 
05:28:09.350 --> 05:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
when we decriminalize do I have that
 
05:28:11.570 --> 05:28:11.580 align:start position:0%
right oh sorry I was talking about I
 
05:28:12.890 --> 05:28:12.900 align:start position:0%
think that was in the context of arrest
 
05:28:15.470 --> 05:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
and spillover crime and so there was
 
05:28:17.830 --> 05:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
testimony from the Chiefs last session
 
05:28:21.110 --> 05:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
that when um when States our neighboring
 
05:28:23.208 --> 05:28:23.218 align:start position:0%
states began to legalize we faced
 
05:28:25.250 --> 05:28:25.260 align:start position:0%
spillover crime in New Hampshire and
 
05:28:26.750 --> 05:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
they used that as an indicator to say
 
05:28:28.850 --> 05:28:28.860 align:start position:0%
that if New Hampshire followed suit we
 
05:28:30.890 --> 05:28:30.900 align:start position:0%
would again see an uptick in crime and
 
05:28:34.010 --> 05:28:34.020 align:start position:0%
so we look at the data from 2016 which
 
05:28:35.628 --> 05:28:35.638 align:start position:0%
was the year the first legalization
 
05:28:38.030 --> 05:28:38.040 align:start position:0%
state among our borders which was made I
 
05:28:40.670 --> 05:28:40.680 align:start position:0%
believe and then through 2021 so I think
 
05:28:42.830 --> 05:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
it was Vermont uh Maine Vermont in
 
05:28:44.868 --> 05:28:44.878 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts I think for like 2016 2017
 
05:28:50.090 --> 05:28:50.100 align:start position:0%
2018 ish and crime is down 26
 
05:28:52.670 --> 05:28:52.680 align:start position:0%
um in in New Hampshire during that time
 
05:28:54.110 --> 05:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
and so this notion that there was
 
05:28:56.510 --> 05:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
spillover crime is just not backed by
 
05:29:02.050 --> 05:29:02.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:04.910 --> 05:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
if you have the information if not if
 
05:29:06.830 --> 05:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
you could get it what about
 
05:29:09.110 --> 05:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts since they legalized
 
05:29:12.170 --> 05:29:12.180 align:start position:0%
what's their crime stats like I'd be
 
05:29:13.550 --> 05:29:13.560 align:start position:0%
happy to pull that incidentally I
 
05:29:14.930 --> 05:29:14.940 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank you absolutely
 
05:29:18.170 --> 05:29:18.180 align:start position:0%
representative salic
 
05:29:19.850 --> 05:29:19.860 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking
 
05:29:22.010 --> 05:29:22.020 align:start position:0%
sorry we're sharing a mic so
 
05:29:24.470 --> 05:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to ask you a similar
 
05:29:25.970 --> 05:29:25.980 align:start position:0%
question I asked one of the previous
 
05:29:25.980 --> 05:29:27.190 align:start position:0%
question I asked one of the previous
speakers

05:29:27.190 --> 05:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
speakers
 
05:29:30.890 --> 05:29:30.900 align:start position:0%
regardless of what method the state uses
 
05:29:33.170 --> 05:29:33.180 align:start position:0%
ultimately whether it's this year in the
 
05:29:36.288 --> 05:29:36.298 align:start position:0%
future to decriminalize marijuana
 
05:29:37.310 --> 05:29:37.320 align:start position:0%
um because clearly we're going to
 
05:29:39.590 --> 05:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
eventually get there do you believe that
 
05:29:42.170 --> 05:29:42.180 align:start position:0%
it should have regulations or just be as
 
05:29:43.970 --> 05:29:43.980 align:start position:0%
free as one of the previous speakers
 
05:29:46.430 --> 05:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
said as grown tomatoes which are
 
05:29:48.170 --> 05:29:48.180 align:start position:0%
actually regulated
 
05:29:50.990 --> 05:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
from our perspective hb6 I believe it's
 
05:29:52.910 --> 05:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
hb639 which was heard in Commerce
 
05:29:55.430 --> 05:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
yesterday is the ideal Bill to move
 
05:29:57.470 --> 05:29:57.480 align:start position:0%
through this legislature that is a bill
 
05:29:58.730 --> 05:29:58.740 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure how much I've been
 
05:29:58.740 --> 05:29:59.510 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure how much I've been
talking

05:29:59.510 --> 05:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
talking
 
05:30:01.910 --> 05:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
it's okay if I just say a few sentences
 
05:30:03.530 --> 05:30:03.540 align:start position:0%
um that is a bill that is um
 
05:30:05.570 --> 05:30:05.580 align:start position:0%
co-sponsored by or is private sponsored
 
05:30:08.390 --> 05:30:08.400 align:start position:0%
by uh leader Osborne and co-sponsored by
 
05:30:11.090 --> 05:30:11.100 align:start position:0%
minority leader Wilhelm and reflects the
 
05:30:13.010 --> 05:30:13.020 align:start position:0%
consensus of a broad diverse Coalition
 
05:30:14.868 --> 05:30:14.878 align:start position:0%
of Advocates and stakeholders who have
 
05:30:16.128 --> 05:30:16.138 align:start position:0%
come together over the past seven or
 
05:30:18.110 --> 05:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
eight months it includes robust testing
 
05:30:21.050 --> 05:30:21.060 align:start position:0%
it includes robust youth protections
 
05:30:22.788 --> 05:30:22.798 align:start position:0%
um the the limits are in terms of
 
05:30:24.410 --> 05:30:24.420 align:start position:0%
possession amounts are hired includes
 
05:30:27.890 --> 05:30:27.900 align:start position:0%
annulments to start to prepare the Lost
 
05:30:31.910 --> 05:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
harm the past harms from prohibition so
 
05:30:34.128 --> 05:30:34.138 align:start position:0%
that is our ideal Bill and IT addresses
 
05:30:36.770 --> 05:30:36.780 align:start position:0%
all those issues including advertising
 
05:30:45.288 --> 05:30:45.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:46.850 --> 05:30:46.860 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
05:30:50.810 --> 05:30:50.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:15.230 --> 05:31:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:17.510 --> 05:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman you don't hear me
 
05:31:19.128 --> 05:31:19.138 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:31:20.990 --> 05:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Matt Simon I
 
05:31:22.250 --> 05:31:22.260 align:start position:0%
work for Prime alternative treatment
 
05:31:24.470 --> 05:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
centers of New Hampshire they're a
 
05:31:26.270 --> 05:31:26.280 align:start position:0%
non-profit therapeutic cannabis
 
05:31:27.310 --> 05:31:27.320 align:start position:0%
alternative treatment center
 
05:31:29.810 --> 05:31:29.820 align:start position:0%
dispensaries and Merrimack and
 
05:31:32.510 --> 05:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
Chichester a cultivation facility in
 
05:31:34.788 --> 05:31:34.798 align:start position:0%
Peterborough we have about 55
 
05:31:38.330 --> 05:31:38.340 align:start position:0%
employees and our focus is entirely on
 
05:31:39.590 --> 05:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
serving great patients who are
 
05:31:41.930 --> 05:31:41.940 align:start position:0%
registered in New Hampshire
 
05:31:43.970 --> 05:31:43.980 align:start position:0%
prior to taking that job year and a half
 
05:31:46.310 --> 05:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
ago I spent the last 15 years working on
 
05:31:48.230 --> 05:31:48.240 align:start position:0%
cannabis policy I've been before this
 
05:31:51.050 --> 05:31:51.060 align:start position:0%
committee many times advocating for
 
05:31:53.570 --> 05:31:53.580 align:start position:0%
bills much like this and in fact I think
 
05:31:56.150 --> 05:31:56.160 align:start position:0%
identical to this so This is actually a
 
05:31:57.770 --> 05:31:57.780 align:start position:0%
handout the one pager I've given you
 
05:32:00.830 --> 05:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
that I created four years ago when I was
 
05:32:02.448 --> 05:32:02.458 align:start position:0%
working for the marijuana policy project
 
05:32:06.110 --> 05:32:06.120 align:start position:0%
I updated it a couple weeks ago and got
 
05:32:08.030 --> 05:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
my colleagues to sign off on it so it's
 
05:32:10.730 --> 05:32:10.740 align:start position:0%
still their document but uh it has the
 
05:32:12.890 --> 05:32:12.900 align:start position:0%
updated laws from
 
05:32:15.470 --> 05:32:15.480 align:start position:0%
the rest of New England which at this
 
05:32:18.110 --> 05:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
point the document is entirely filled in
 
05:32:20.288 --> 05:32:20.298 align:start position:0%
it is now legal for
 
05:32:23.810 --> 05:32:23.820 align:start position:0%
patients and adults 21 and older in
 
05:32:25.368 --> 05:32:25.378 align:start position:0%
every New England State
 
05:32:27.708 --> 05:32:27.718 align:start position:0%
except New Hampshire to grow limit
 
05:32:29.990 --> 05:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
limited amounts of cannabis for their
 
05:32:32.330 --> 05:32:32.340 align:start position:0%
own use the only exception is
 
05:32:34.490 --> 05:32:34.500 align:start position:0%
Connecticut which will take effect on
 
05:32:37.490 --> 05:32:37.500 align:start position:0%
July 1st of this year so that is in
 
05:32:40.788 --> 05:32:40.798 align:start position:0%
statute but not yet in effect in in
 
05:32:42.970 --> 05:32:42.980 align:start position:0%
Connecticut so when we talk about
 
05:32:45.110 --> 05:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
cannabis legalization we're really
 
05:32:48.730 --> 05:32:48.740 align:start position:0%
talking about two separate issues one is
 
05:32:52.010 --> 05:32:52.020 align:start position:0%
legalizing possession getting people out
 
05:32:53.750 --> 05:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
of the criminal justice system and the
 
05:32:57.350 --> 05:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
other is regulation taxation consumer
 
05:32:57.360 --> 05:32:58.670 align:start position:0%
other is regulation taxation consumer
protection

05:32:58.670 --> 05:32:58.680 align:start position:0%
protection
 
05:33:00.530 --> 05:33:00.540 align:start position:0%
the first issue turns out to be much
 
05:33:02.750 --> 05:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
simpler it's way easier to just stop
 
05:33:05.288 --> 05:33:05.298 align:start position:0%
punishing people for possessing cannabis
 
05:33:08.390 --> 05:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
and the other issue turns out is a
 
05:33:09.830 --> 05:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
little bit complicated there are a
 
05:33:11.448 --> 05:33:11.458 align:start position:0%
number of bills that have been filed I
 
05:33:12.650 --> 05:33:12.660 align:start position:0%
think they're going to be a lot of
 
05:33:15.050 --> 05:33:15.060 align:start position:0%
proposals to maybe amend them there are
 
05:33:16.610 --> 05:33:16.620 align:start position:0%
a lot of policy choices that have to get
 
05:33:16.620 --> 05:33:17.510 align:start position:0%
a lot of policy choices that have to get
made

05:33:17.510 --> 05:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
made
 
05:33:19.970 --> 05:33:19.980 align:start position:0%
so tends to be more difficult to build
 
05:33:22.490 --> 05:33:22.500 align:start position:0%
consensus around regulation policy
 
05:33:24.890 --> 05:33:24.900 align:start position:0%
but I'm hoping that we will reach
 
05:33:26.510 --> 05:33:26.520 align:start position:0%
consensus around this much simpler
 
05:33:28.788 --> 05:33:28.798 align:start position:0%
Criminal Justice Reform
 
05:33:28.798 --> 05:33:30.350 align:start position:0%
Criminal Justice Reform
uh

05:33:30.350 --> 05:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:33:32.628 --> 05:33:32.638 align:start position:0%
I should point out Prime ATC is not
 
05:33:34.368 --> 05:33:34.378 align:start position:0%
going to benefit from this in any way it
 
05:33:36.590 --> 05:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
actually hurts our business but
 
05:33:39.288 --> 05:33:39.298 align:start position:0%
much like with alcohol people can Brew
 
05:33:41.750 --> 05:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
their own beer and if any alcohol
 
05:33:43.430 --> 05:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
company came in here and said no there
 
05:33:44.930 --> 05:33:44.940 align:start position:0%
should be felony penalties against home
 
05:33:44.940 --> 05:33:46.190 align:start position:0%
should be felony penalties against home
brewing

05:33:46.190 --> 05:33:46.200 align:start position:0%
brewing
 
05:33:47.690 --> 05:33:47.700 align:start position:0%
I don't think we should like that very
 
05:33:49.970 --> 05:33:49.980 align:start position:0%
much so as an ethical cannabis business
 
05:33:51.948 --> 05:33:51.958 align:start position:0%
supporting the right of adults to grow
 
05:33:53.930 --> 05:33:53.940 align:start position:0%
their own cannabis is very important to
 
05:33:55.190 --> 05:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
me it's important for our leadership
 
05:33:56.570 --> 05:33:56.580 align:start position:0%
team so
 
05:33:59.448 --> 05:33:59.458 align:start position:0%
we're here to support it and would note
 
05:34:02.090 --> 05:34:02.100 align:start position:0%
the benefit that would be tremendous for
 
05:34:03.530 --> 05:34:03.540 align:start position:0%
patients who have been practically
 
05:34:05.810 --> 05:34:05.820 align:start position:0%
begging for this for the last
 
05:34:09.590 --> 05:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
12 years and have been rejected and come
 
05:34:11.270 --> 05:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
very close and failed many times so it's
 
05:34:13.610 --> 05:34:13.620 align:start position:0%
still a felony to grow your own cannabis
 
05:34:15.470 --> 05:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
even if you're a registered patient in
 
05:34:17.090 --> 05:34:17.100 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire this bill would change
 
05:34:19.610 --> 05:34:19.620 align:start position:0%
that so would another bill but
 
05:34:21.050 --> 05:34:21.060 align:start position:0%
you have to answer any questions thank
 
05:34:21.060 --> 05:34:23.868 align:start position:0%
you have to answer any questions thank
you

05:34:23.868 --> 05:34:23.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:26.510 --> 05:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
representative Newell
 
05:34:28.850 --> 05:34:28.860 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
05:34:31.128 --> 05:34:31.138 align:start position:0%
um I'm curious that
 
05:34:34.010 --> 05:34:34.020 align:start position:0%
in the between the difference with
 
05:34:37.730 --> 05:34:37.740 align:start position:0%
therapeutic use being grown and and um
 
05:34:41.510 --> 05:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
a a setting other than someone's home or
 
05:34:42.890 --> 05:34:42.900 align:start position:0%
growing it in your backyard garden
 
05:34:45.890 --> 05:34:45.900 align:start position:0%
perhaps right next to your tomatoes
 
05:34:47.690 --> 05:34:47.700 align:start position:0%
um is there you know with other
 
05:34:50.628 --> 05:34:50.638 align:start position:0%
substances there is a harm that if it is
 
05:34:53.330 --> 05:34:53.340 align:start position:0%
unregulated and untested that many times
 
05:34:55.550 --> 05:34:55.560 align:start position:0%
you will find something you know it'll
 
05:34:58.730 --> 05:34:58.740 align:start position:0%
be more harmful right to get it in that
 
05:35:01.970 --> 05:35:01.980 align:start position:0%
way can you speak to uh that
 
05:35:04.850 --> 05:35:04.860 align:start position:0%
potentiality when it is grown in your
 
05:35:06.550 --> 05:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
backyard perhaps right next to your face
 
05:35:08.930 --> 05:35:08.940 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you for question so
 
05:35:10.550 --> 05:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
there are risks with cannabis
 
05:35:14.270 --> 05:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
cultivation mold is a major one if it
 
05:35:16.070 --> 05:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
becomes damp particularly after it's
 
05:35:16.080 --> 05:35:18.110 align:start position:0%
becomes damp particularly after it's
harvested

05:35:18.110 --> 05:35:18.120 align:start position:0%
harvested
 
05:35:20.090 --> 05:35:20.100 align:start position:0%
these are issues both in the regulated
 
05:35:23.030 --> 05:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
market and for home cultivators our hope
 
05:35:24.890 --> 05:35:24.900 align:start position:0%
is that with home cultivation becoming
 
05:35:26.750 --> 05:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
legal that we can do the sort of public
 
05:35:28.490 --> 05:35:28.500 align:start position:0%
education that will allow people to
 
05:35:31.368 --> 05:35:31.378 align:start position:0%
cultivate responsibly for themselves and
 
05:35:33.650 --> 05:35:33.660 align:start position:0%
know as with their tomatoes that they're
 
05:35:36.410 --> 05:35:36.420 align:start position:0%
not putting something harmful onto their
 
05:35:39.410 --> 05:35:39.420 align:start position:0%
plants that will hurt them in the
 
05:35:41.448 --> 05:35:41.458 align:start position:0%
regulated market there are unethical
 
05:35:43.190 --> 05:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
companies and there have been documented
 
05:35:44.628 --> 05:35:44.638 align:start position:0%
instances in other states where
 
05:35:46.368 --> 05:35:46.378 align:start position:0%
Regulators have had to step in and say
 
05:35:48.110 --> 05:35:48.120 align:start position:0%
hey here
 
05:35:49.730 --> 05:35:49.740 align:start position:0%
you're adding stuff to your cannabis
 
05:35:52.070 --> 05:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
you're we have independent lab testing
 
05:35:53.868 --> 05:35:53.878 align:start position:0%
and you're failing it you know there are
 
05:35:56.090 --> 05:35:56.100 align:start position:0%
in a regulated market there's a way to
 
05:35:58.250 --> 05:35:58.260 align:start position:0%
deal with that in an unregulated Market
 
05:35:59.868 --> 05:35:59.878 align:start position:0%
that currently serves New Hampshire
 
05:36:01.970 --> 05:36:01.980 align:start position:0%
there is no product control so people
 
05:36:03.530 --> 05:36:03.540 align:start position:0%
don't know what they're getting
 
05:36:05.090 --> 05:36:05.100 align:start position:0%
if you're buying it from an unregulated
 
05:36:08.570 --> 05:36:08.580 align:start position:0%
seller the the so-called illicit Market
 
05:36:11.390 --> 05:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
uh you have no idea who who grew that
 
05:36:13.250 --> 05:36:13.260 align:start position:0%
cannabis or what may have been added to
 
05:36:16.850 --> 05:36:16.860 align:start position:0%
it uh and whether it's moldy or full of
 
05:36:19.310 --> 05:36:19.320 align:start position:0%
heavy metals or pesticides so people who
 
05:36:21.230 --> 05:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
buy from the atcs know that the products
 
05:36:23.650 --> 05:36:23.660 align:start position:0%
are independently lab tested and labeled
 
05:36:26.810 --> 05:36:26.820 align:start position:0%
according to what's actually in them
 
05:36:29.830 --> 05:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
most people want that regulated market
 
05:36:32.750 --> 05:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
patients and adult consumers but as with
 
05:36:35.868 --> 05:36:35.878 align:start position:0%
alcohol for people who feel strongly
 
05:36:38.510 --> 05:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
and have trouble frankly affording the
 
05:36:40.850 --> 05:36:40.860 align:start position:0%
regulated products sometimes it's it's a
 
05:36:43.730 --> 05:36:43.740 align:start position:0%
cost-effective option and most
 
05:36:45.530 --> 05:36:45.540 align:start position:0%
importantly it's one that should not be
 
05:36:45.540 --> 05:36:48.410 align:start position:0%
importantly it's one that should not be
criminalized

05:36:48.410 --> 05:36:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:50.570 --> 05:36:50.580 align:start position:0%
and I follow up on that
 
05:36:53.330 --> 05:36:53.340 align:start position:0%
thank you I I think I'm sorry because I
 
05:36:54.708 --> 05:36:54.718 align:start position:0%
didn't frame the question very well I
 
05:36:55.910 --> 05:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
should break these things down but it
 
05:36:58.490 --> 05:36:58.500 align:start position:0%
comes out better my question is I think
 
05:37:01.070 --> 05:37:01.080 align:start position:0%
what you're talking about is
 
05:37:02.930 --> 05:37:02.940 align:start position:0%
um you know mold and things like that
 
05:37:04.128 --> 05:37:04.138 align:start position:0%
these are things that would happen with
 
05:37:05.270 --> 05:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
you know any plant when you're growing
 
05:37:07.550 --> 05:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
it at home my question is to the level
 
05:37:09.650 --> 05:37:09.660 align:start position:0%
of potency you know so if you're growing
 
05:37:12.050 --> 05:37:12.060 align:start position:0%
it in your backyard is it suddenly going
 
05:37:14.390 --> 05:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
to be ridiculously more potent than you
 
05:37:17.390 --> 05:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
get it at uh you know in a therapeutic
 
05:37:20.390 --> 05:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
setting or would it be you know do you
 
05:37:21.708 --> 05:37:21.718 align:start position:0%
understand I'm sorry I'm not I'm not
 
05:37:23.030 --> 05:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
saying it right but do you understand
 
05:37:24.708 --> 05:37:24.718 align:start position:0%
the question and it's hard to hear and
 
05:37:26.810 --> 05:37:26.820 align:start position:0%
hear so part of it is probably my years
 
05:37:28.730 --> 05:37:28.740 align:start position:0%
either being full of lacks or fat
 
05:37:30.970 --> 05:37:30.980 align:start position:0%
Acoustics but I I think I I understand
 
05:37:33.350 --> 05:37:33.360 align:start position:0%
certainly from a patient perspective and
 
05:37:35.750 --> 05:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
from adult consumer perspective being
 
05:37:37.310 --> 05:37:37.320 align:start position:0%
able to know the potency of the Cannabis
 
05:37:39.170 --> 05:37:39.180 align:start position:0%
you're consuming is important
 
05:37:41.390 --> 05:37:41.400 align:start position:0%
think about alcohol if you walk into a
 
05:37:43.250 --> 05:37:43.260 align:start position:0%
brewery and you don't know whether that
 
05:37:44.868 --> 05:37:44.878 align:start position:0%
liquid in front of you is four percent
 
05:37:46.910 --> 05:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
alcohol or nine percent alcohol that's
 
05:37:48.350 --> 05:37:48.360 align:start position:0%
going to have a pretty important impact
 
05:37:50.270 --> 05:37:50.280 align:start position:0%
on how many you're going to consume and
 
05:37:52.970 --> 05:37:52.980 align:start position:0%
how you determine whether you're
 
05:37:55.010 --> 05:37:55.020 align:start position:0%
impaired or not so that's a benefit to
 
05:37:56.448 --> 05:37:56.458 align:start position:0%
the regulated market everything that's
 
05:37:58.128 --> 05:37:58.138 align:start position:0%
sold in the ATC is everything that's
 
05:38:00.770 --> 05:38:00.780 align:start position:0%
sold in regulated businesses anywhere is
 
05:38:02.930 --> 05:38:02.940 align:start position:0%
labeled for the potency so that's a
 
05:38:04.670 --> 05:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
downside of Home growth but if you're
 
05:38:06.770 --> 05:38:06.780 align:start position:0%
growing at home first of all it's very
 
05:38:08.810 --> 05:38:08.820 align:start position:0%
challenging to grow High potency
 
05:38:10.910 --> 05:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
cannabis so most people are not going to
 
05:38:12.948 --> 05:38:12.958 align:start position:0%
be able to achieve the high end of
 
05:38:16.610 --> 05:38:16.620 align:start position:0%
potency but even if even if they can you
 
05:38:18.050 --> 05:38:18.060 align:start position:0%
know they're gonna they're going to work
 
05:38:20.208 --> 05:38:20.218 align:start position:0%
up to that and
 
05:38:21.590 --> 05:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
if they're like most people they'll
 
05:38:23.448 --> 05:38:23.458 align:start position:0%
realize the potency isn't really what
 
05:38:26.150 --> 05:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
they're most interested in the people
 
05:38:27.470 --> 05:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
who use cannabis are trying to feel
 
05:38:27.480 --> 05:38:28.310 align:start position:0%
who use cannabis are trying to feel
better

05:38:28.310 --> 05:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
better
 
05:38:32.030 --> 05:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
uh or less bad and the highest THC
 
05:38:36.948 --> 05:38:36.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:38.810 --> 05:38:38.820 align:start position:0%
people don't know how much is in their
 
05:38:41.750 --> 05:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
home group either generally but they
 
05:38:45.170 --> 05:38:45.180 align:start position:0%
have an idea and in my ideal World which
 
05:38:47.810 --> 05:38:47.820 align:start position:0%
I think we can get to without too much
 
05:38:49.430 --> 05:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
difficulty there will be independent
 
05:38:50.930 --> 05:38:50.940 align:start position:0%
testing Labs available so if you want to
 
05:38:54.890 --> 05:38:54.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:57.410 --> 05:38:57.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:39:05.510 --> 05:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:07.490 --> 05:39:07.500 align:start position:0%
at this time the chair recognizes Paul
 
05:39:07.500 --> 05:39:16.128 align:start position:0%
at this time the chair recognizes Paul
Toomey

05:39:16.128 --> 05:39:16.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:18.288 --> 05:39:18.298 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair my name is Paul
 
05:39:20.750 --> 05:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
Toomey I'm from Chichester
 
05:39:23.948 --> 05:39:23.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:26.330 --> 05:39:26.340 align:start position:0%
the former House Council and it's really
 
05:39:28.430 --> 05:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
an honor to be back here I've spent my
 
05:39:30.550 --> 05:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
almost my entire professional life
 
05:39:33.590 --> 05:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
litigating against governmental entities
 
05:39:36.110 --> 05:39:36.120 align:start position:0%
and I must say the only one I really
 
05:39:37.310 --> 05:39:37.320 align:start position:0%
love is New Hampshire House of
 
05:39:38.868 --> 05:39:38.878 align:start position:0%
Representatives so it's really an honor
 
05:39:40.310 --> 05:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
to be here
 
05:39:41.930 --> 05:39:41.940 align:start position:0%
um you know I enjoyed being House
 
05:39:44.930 --> 05:39:44.940 align:start position:0%
Council I was also a member of the 2017
 
05:39:46.910 --> 05:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
commission that studied the question of
 
05:39:48.890 --> 05:39:48.900 align:start position:0%
the legalization of marijuana and at
 
05:39:50.510 --> 05:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
that time I was one of two members that
 
05:39:52.670 --> 05:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
were charged with reviewing all the
 
05:39:54.288 --> 05:39:54.298 align:start position:0%
scientific and medical data and then
 
05:39:55.970 --> 05:39:55.980 align:start position:0%
reporting to the committee
 
05:39:58.010 --> 05:39:58.020 align:start position:0%
that that reports available and if any
 
05:40:00.170 --> 05:40:00.180 align:start position:0%
of you have an interest that I urge you
 
05:40:02.090 --> 05:40:02.100 align:start position:0%
to take a look at some of the studies
 
05:40:04.368 --> 05:40:04.378 align:start position:0%
that were referenced in the back
 
05:40:06.708 --> 05:40:06.718 align:start position:0%
sections of it because it'll answer a
 
05:40:07.970 --> 05:40:07.980 align:start position:0%
lot of questions that people bring up
 
05:40:09.650 --> 05:40:09.660 align:start position:0%
about traffic safety and health and
 
05:40:11.270 --> 05:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
things like that
 
05:40:13.490 --> 05:40:13.500 align:start position:0%
um I was also
 
05:40:15.288 --> 05:40:15.298 align:start position:0%
for 40 years of criminal defense lawyer
 
05:40:17.030 --> 05:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
as I said when I was a public defender
 
05:40:19.250 --> 05:40:19.260 align:start position:0%
for 10 of those years first in
 
05:40:20.990 --> 05:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
Manchester whereas I was the office
 
05:40:22.430 --> 05:40:22.440 align:start position:0%
manager of the Hillsborough County
 
05:40:24.470 --> 05:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
Public Defender's office and then I
 
05:40:26.810 --> 05:40:26.820 align:start position:0%
became the litigation director
 
05:40:29.288 --> 05:40:29.298 align:start position:0%
for the entire State program
 
05:40:32.390 --> 05:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
I presented and submitted written
 
05:40:34.128 --> 05:40:34.138 align:start position:0%
testimony and I'm not going to go over
 
05:40:35.690 --> 05:40:35.700 align:start position:0%
everything I said in there just like to
 
05:40:37.490 --> 05:40:37.500 align:start position:0%
add a few things
 
05:40:39.948 --> 05:40:39.958 align:start position:0%
I think the most the reason I'm here
 
05:40:41.750 --> 05:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
really is because it's in my life
 
05:40:43.788 --> 05:40:43.798 align:start position:0%
representing poor kids I was a poor kid
 
05:40:46.010 --> 05:40:46.020 align:start position:0%
myself I grew up on welfare my friends
 
05:40:48.590 --> 05:40:48.600 align:start position:0%
were all poor working class kids and I
 
05:40:50.090 --> 05:40:50.100 align:start position:0%
know what these laws do to people like
 
05:40:51.948 --> 05:40:51.958 align:start position:0%
that what they do is they steal their
 
05:40:55.610 --> 05:40:55.620 align:start position:0%
future they make it so that even if kids
 
05:40:58.430 --> 05:40:58.440 align:start position:0%
don't go to jail for it it's really
 
05:41:00.410 --> 05:41:00.420 align:start position:0%
difficult to get a job it's really
 
05:41:02.510 --> 05:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
difficult to get housing that's also
 
05:41:03.830 --> 05:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
True by the way for veterans I
 
05:41:05.990 --> 05:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
represented a lot of veterans who have
 
05:41:08.270 --> 05:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
had problems getting you know being
 
05:41:09.590 --> 05:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
afraid they were going to get thrown out
 
05:41:12.530 --> 05:41:12.540 align:start position:0%
of their VA services or or subsidized
 
05:41:14.390 --> 05:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
Federal housing because of simple
 
05:41:16.128 --> 05:41:16.138 align:start position:0%
marijuana possession charges and that's
 
05:41:18.650 --> 05:41:18.660 align:start position:0%
a population you should keep in mind
 
05:41:22.010 --> 05:41:22.020 align:start position:0%
when poor kid when you go to court for
 
05:41:23.868 --> 05:41:23.878 align:start position:0%
the last 30 years when he first was a
 
05:41:25.788 --> 05:41:25.798 align:start position:0%
lawyer if you got busted with body you
 
05:41:28.310 --> 05:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
risked actually going to jail again you
 
05:41:29.570 --> 05:41:29.580 align:start position:0%
know having doing some serious time
 
05:41:32.628 --> 05:41:32.638 align:start position:0%
sometimes up to 12 months after about
 
05:41:33.948 --> 05:41:33.958 align:start position:0%
to say this
 
05:41:36.708 --> 05:41:36.718 align:start position:0%
mid 80s that just sort of stopped for
 
05:41:39.650 --> 05:41:39.660 align:start position:0%
the last 20 years I have never seen
 
05:41:41.208 --> 05:41:41.218 align:start position:0%
a person
 
05:41:43.250 --> 05:41:43.260 align:start position:0%
plead guilty or get convicted of
 
05:41:45.650 --> 05:41:45.660 align:start position:0%
possession of marijuana or walked into
 
05:41:48.530 --> 05:41:48.540 align:start position:0%
court with a lawyer I've seen hundreds
 
05:41:51.948 --> 05:41:51.958 align:start position:0%
of people get convicted who went to the
 
05:41:54.170 --> 05:41:54.180 align:start position:0%
arraignments without lawyers and knew
 
05:41:55.730 --> 05:41:55.740 align:start position:0%
they couldn't afford a lawyer and knew
 
05:41:57.170 --> 05:41:57.180 align:start position:0%
that if they asked for the state to
 
05:41:58.550 --> 05:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
appoint a lawyer it was going to cost
 
05:42:01.250 --> 05:42:01.260 align:start position:0%
them 300 600 and if they couldn't come
 
05:42:02.448 --> 05:42:02.458 align:start position:0%
up with that they were going to end up
 
05:42:03.410 --> 05:42:03.420 align:start position:0%
in jail
 
05:42:05.868 --> 05:42:05.878 align:start position:0%
well those kids are the ones who plead
 
05:42:07.430 --> 05:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
guilty nowadays the possession of
 
05:42:10.670 --> 05:42:10.680 align:start position:0%
marijuana those are the kids who get
 
05:42:12.650 --> 05:42:12.660 align:start position:0%
driven out of the workforce and when you
 
05:42:14.330 --> 05:42:14.340 align:start position:0%
get driven out of the workforce in this
 
05:42:16.190 --> 05:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
country you go to the crime Force I mean
 
05:42:17.810 --> 05:42:17.820 align:start position:0%
it's just that simple people have to
 
05:42:19.128 --> 05:42:19.138 align:start position:0%
survive and they're going to find a way
 
05:42:21.110 --> 05:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
to survive and if you make it so that
 
05:42:22.730 --> 05:42:22.740 align:start position:0%
somebody can't earn an honest living
 
05:42:25.250 --> 05:42:25.260 align:start position:0%
they'll earn a dishonest living
 
05:42:26.570 --> 05:42:26.580 align:start position:0%
we don't need that we need people
 
05:42:26.580 --> 05:42:27.650 align:start position:0%
we don't need that we need people
working

05:42:27.650 --> 05:42:27.660 align:start position:0%
working
 
05:42:30.050 --> 05:42:30.060 align:start position:0%
go to any store or any business in this
 
05:42:31.730 --> 05:42:31.740 align:start position:0%
state you'll see they're just dying for
 
05:42:33.830 --> 05:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
people to work but most of them won't
 
05:42:35.510 --> 05:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
take a chance on hiring somebody with a
 
05:42:37.490 --> 05:42:37.500 align:start position:0%
drug record so we just have to stop that
 
05:42:39.230 --> 05:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
Madness it doesn't do anything it
 
05:42:41.150 --> 05:42:41.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't change any Behavior anybody can
 
05:42:43.070 --> 05:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
get marijuana anytime they want they can
 
05:42:45.288 --> 05:42:45.298 align:start position:0%
either buy it on the street from a full
 
05:42:46.970 --> 05:42:46.980 align:start position:0%
service drug deal who's going to give
 
05:42:49.490 --> 05:42:49.500 align:start position:0%
them access to heroin and cocaine and
 
05:42:51.708 --> 05:42:51.718 align:start position:0%
Fentanyl and anything else they want or
 
05:42:53.690 --> 05:42:53.700 align:start position:0%
they can go to Massachusetts Maine
 
05:42:55.970 --> 05:42:55.980 align:start position:0%
Vermont but nobody probably goes to
 
05:42:58.430 --> 05:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
Canada it's a little too much but you
 
05:42:59.690 --> 05:42:59.700 align:start position:0%
can go in any direction from New
 
05:43:01.610 --> 05:43:01.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and get marijuana if you want
 
05:43:03.590 --> 05:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
so you're not changing anybody's
 
05:43:06.530 --> 05:43:06.540 align:start position:0%
Behavior what you're doing is driving it
 
05:43:08.628 --> 05:43:08.638 align:start position:0%
underground I've heard some people say
 
05:43:11.628 --> 05:43:11.638 align:start position:0%
that um well
 
05:43:13.910 --> 05:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
that the drug deals will just undercut
 
05:43:16.610 --> 05:43:16.620 align:start position:0%
the price and it doesn't matter that
 
05:43:18.350 --> 05:43:18.360 align:start position:0%
happens if you get greedy and over you
 
05:43:20.208 --> 05:43:20.218 align:start position:0%
know put the taxes Sky High but if you
 
05:43:22.250 --> 05:43:22.260 align:start position:0%
make it sort of the way we deal with
 
05:43:24.050 --> 05:43:24.060 align:start position:0%
alcohol and that there aren't either
 
05:43:26.270 --> 05:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
make it a free thing where people do it
 
05:43:28.250 --> 05:43:28.260 align:start position:0%
themselves or make it cheap enough that
 
05:43:30.530 --> 05:43:30.540 align:start position:0%
won't happen you don't ever see people
 
05:43:33.170 --> 05:43:33.180 align:start position:0%
selling alcohol in the street corners at
 
05:43:35.510 --> 05:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
least I haven't seen it for a long time
 
05:43:35.520 --> 05:43:36.230 align:start position:0%
least I haven't seen it for a long time
um

05:43:36.230 --> 05:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:43:39.170 --> 05:43:39.180 align:start position:0%
there are several bills in before the
 
05:43:41.810 --> 05:43:41.820 align:start position:0%
legislature with commercial models and I
 
05:43:43.550 --> 05:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
am a member of a coalition
 
05:43:47.530 --> 05:43:47.540 align:start position:0%
with a ACLU and AFP and
 
05:43:50.090 --> 05:43:50.100 align:start position:0%
marijuana policy project that helped
 
05:43:50.100 --> 05:43:50.890 align:start position:0%
marijuana policy project that helped
draft

05:43:50.890 --> 05:43:50.900 align:start position:0%
draft
 
05:43:53.868 --> 05:43:53.878 align:start position:0%
639 the majority leaders Bill and that's
 
05:43:56.030 --> 05:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
bill I support but I think it's
 
05:43:57.650 --> 05:43:57.660 align:start position:0%
critically important to have this
 
05:44:00.350 --> 05:44:00.360 align:start position:0%
alternative available because there's a
 
05:44:01.970 --> 05:44:01.980 align:start position:0%
lot of disagreement about the best way
 
05:44:05.410 --> 05:44:05.420 align:start position:0%
to go forward with a commercial system
 
05:44:08.868 --> 05:44:08.878 align:start position:0%
and none of those bills may pass but we
 
05:44:11.150 --> 05:44:11.160 align:start position:0%
have to stop the madness we have to stop
 
05:44:14.270 --> 05:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
you know just criminalizing poor kids
 
05:44:15.890 --> 05:44:15.900 align:start position:0%
and keeping them you know basically
 
05:44:17.930 --> 05:44:17.940 align:start position:0%
stealing their future so I guess I what
 
05:44:19.730 --> 05:44:19.740 align:start position:0%
I would ask you to do is I think this is
 
05:44:22.128 --> 05:44:22.138 align:start position:0%
a very important bill I ask you to pass
 
05:44:25.070 --> 05:44:25.080 align:start position:0%
it so that there's an alternative if all
 
05:44:26.690 --> 05:44:26.700 align:start position:0%
those other bills fail at least we can
 
05:44:28.330 --> 05:44:28.340 align:start position:0%
stop harming people
 
05:44:32.270 --> 05:44:32.280 align:start position:0%
hypocrite he said 2 500 years ago first
 
05:44:34.190 --> 05:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
Do no harm and we need to stop doing
 
05:44:36.410 --> 05:44:36.420 align:start position:0%
harm we've had a model
 
05:44:38.930 --> 05:44:38.940 align:start position:0%
60 years of treating health problems
 
05:44:41.628 --> 05:44:41.638 align:start position:0%
with with police resources it hasn't
 
05:44:43.190 --> 05:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
worked at all the problems gotten worse
 
05:44:45.048 --> 05:44:45.058 align:start position:0%
and worse and worse we have the worst
 
05:44:46.670 --> 05:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
drug problem in the world and we have
 
05:44:48.650 --> 05:44:48.660 align:start position:0%
the most stringent drug laws in the
 
05:44:51.110 --> 05:44:51.120 align:start position:0%
world they just don't do it if you want
 
05:44:52.850 --> 05:44:52.860 align:start position:0%
it there are health problems associated
 
05:44:54.890 --> 05:44:54.900 align:start position:0%
with any substance
 
05:44:56.330 --> 05:44:56.340 align:start position:0%
but we need to
 
05:44:58.610 --> 05:44:58.620 align:start position:0%
stop trying to treat them with cages and
 
05:45:00.590 --> 05:45:00.600 align:start position:0%
start trying to cheat them through our
 
05:45:02.208 --> 05:45:02.218 align:start position:0%
health system and I don't have anything
 
05:45:03.530 --> 05:45:03.540 align:start position:0%
else thank you very much for listening
 
05:45:04.970 --> 05:45:04.980 align:start position:0%
to me
 
05:45:07.310 --> 05:45:07.320 align:start position:0%
representative selig
 
05:45:09.110 --> 05:45:09.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I actually have a
 
05:45:11.690 --> 05:45:11.700 align:start position:0%
procedural question this is the second
 
05:45:14.628 --> 05:45:14.638 align:start position:0%
mention we've had of HB 639 which my
 
05:45:16.548 --> 05:45:16.558 align:start position:0%
understanding is what to the Commerce
 
05:45:19.128 --> 05:45:19.138 align:start position:0%
Committee does that if it passes through
 
05:45:21.170 --> 05:45:21.180 align:start position:0%
Commerce then come to us
 
05:45:23.208 --> 05:45:23.218 align:start position:0%
that'll be a determination that'll be up
 
05:45:25.430 --> 05:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
to the speaker I I really I don't know
 
05:45:28.070 --> 05:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
at this point nor do I know why it went
 
05:45:30.410 --> 05:45:30.420 align:start position:0%
there instead of here other than perhaps
 
05:45:30.420 --> 05:45:32.330 align:start position:0%
there instead of here other than perhaps
Logistics

05:45:32.330 --> 05:45:32.340 align:start position:0%
Logistics
 
05:45:34.250 --> 05:45:34.260 align:start position:0%
thank you I couldn't hear the question
 
05:45:37.430 --> 05:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
but it was for me I have a question for
 
05:45:39.410 --> 05:45:39.420 align:start position:0%
you though the study you referenced is
 
05:45:41.030 --> 05:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
that available online
 
05:45:43.548 --> 05:45:43.558 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry the study that you referenced
 
05:45:46.510 --> 05:45:46.520 align:start position:0%
that you that you um
 
05:45:49.610 --> 05:45:49.620 align:start position:0%
I think it's available on the um
 
05:45:52.910 --> 05:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
House website I can I can send it the
 
05:45:55.010 --> 05:45:55.020 align:start position:0%
link to you I think it's still on the
 
05:45:56.810 --> 05:45:56.820 align:start position:0%
House website I'll check with our
 
05:45:58.250 --> 05:45:58.260 align:start position:0%
committee researchers thank you very
 
05:45:59.868 --> 05:45:59.878 align:start position:0%
much yeah just if I could just say one
 
05:46:02.390 --> 05:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
other thing about that there's a nitzis
 
05:46:05.930 --> 05:46:05.940 align:start position:0%
survey in there on traffic accidents and
 
05:46:07.548 --> 05:46:07.558 align:start position:0%
it's really interesting it's kind of
 
05:46:10.190 --> 05:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
counter-intuitive they end up saying
 
05:46:13.670 --> 05:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
that people marijuana does things that
 
05:46:15.288 --> 05:46:15.298 align:start position:0%
make people worse drivers you know
 
05:46:17.650 --> 05:46:17.660 align:start position:0%
inattentive you know
 
05:46:19.910 --> 05:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
but it also makes them drive slower
 
05:46:22.430 --> 05:46:22.440 align:start position:0%
because they're paranoid so it's ended
 
05:46:23.868 --> 05:46:23.878 align:start position:0%
up saying it's sort of a wash that
 
05:46:25.310 --> 05:46:25.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean anybody should go up and
 
05:46:27.470 --> 05:46:27.480 align:start position:0%
ever drive on any substance but it's
 
05:46:29.150 --> 05:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
really it's interesting and it's
 
05:46:31.490 --> 05:46:31.500 align:start position:0%
counterintuitive so it's a lot of slow
 
05:46:33.948 --> 05:46:33.958 align:start position:0%
speed crashes yes
 
05:46:37.610 --> 05:46:37.620 align:start position:0%
crashes any any other questions
 
05:46:40.430 --> 05:46:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:47.930 --> 05:46:47.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:49.310 --> 05:46:49.320 align:start position:0%
hello again
 
05:46:52.610 --> 05:46:52.620 align:start position:0%
um obviously I'm in favor of HP 344 for
 
05:46:55.010 --> 05:46:55.020 align:start position:0%
home cultivation I was I believe I was
 
05:46:56.868 --> 05:46:56.878 align:start position:0%
the other scientific reviewer for the
 
05:46:59.690 --> 05:46:59.700 align:start position:0%
commission for the study back then
 
05:47:02.208 --> 05:47:02.218 align:start position:0%
um so and and the slow the speed uh
 
05:47:03.708 --> 05:47:03.718 align:start position:0%
thing was pretty funny too because I we
 
05:47:04.970 --> 05:47:04.980 align:start position:0%
talked to some Law Enforcement Officers
 
05:47:06.650 --> 05:47:06.660 align:start position:0%
like if someone can you tell what
 
05:47:08.990 --> 05:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
someone's using during uh you know when
 
05:47:09.948 --> 05:47:09.958 align:start position:0%
you pulled someone over like well
 
05:47:11.270 --> 05:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
someone's speeding and swerving we know
 
05:47:12.890 --> 05:47:12.900 align:start position:0%
they're drinking and if someone's doing
 
05:47:15.110 --> 05:47:15.120 align:start position:0%
35 in the slow lane
 
05:47:16.970 --> 05:47:16.980 align:start position:0%
and not even doing anything but going 35
 
05:47:18.530 --> 05:47:18.540 align:start position:0%
miles an hour they're driving otherwise
 
05:47:20.150 --> 05:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
safely like they're probably using just
 
05:47:23.810 --> 05:47:23.820 align:start position:0%
cannabis so it was uh interesting uh
 
05:47:26.270 --> 05:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
interesting study that we heard
 
05:47:26.280 --> 05:47:27.830 align:start position:0%
interesting study that we heard
um

05:47:27.830 --> 05:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:47:30.288 --> 05:47:30.298 align:start position:0%
so I I think this is a very important
 
05:47:31.610 --> 05:47:31.620 align:start position:0%
bill even if any of the other cannabis
 
05:47:33.288 --> 05:47:33.298 align:start position:0%
bills pass any of the full legalization
 
05:47:35.270 --> 05:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
whether it's retail or State Stores or
 
05:47:37.670 --> 05:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
private retailers Commerce or criminal
 
05:47:39.230 --> 05:47:39.240 align:start position:0%
justice bill I think it's important that
 
05:47:40.910 --> 05:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
this pass even is a standalone Bill not
 
05:47:43.430 --> 05:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
just as a backup just in case but I
 
05:47:45.590 --> 05:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
think it's it's important to allow a
 
05:47:48.110 --> 05:47:48.120 align:start position:0%
home grow no different than home brewing
 
05:47:50.448 --> 05:47:50.458 align:start position:0%
like we've heard of alcohol and of wine
 
05:47:52.670 --> 05:47:52.680 align:start position:0%
and beer when I was on Commerce I did a
 
05:47:54.170 --> 05:47:54.180 align:start position:0%
lot of Commerce Community a lot of
 
05:47:55.850 --> 05:47:55.860 align:start position:0%
discussions about all those laws and
 
05:47:58.910 --> 05:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
regulations there's no uh real oversight
 
05:48:01.128 --> 05:48:01.138 align:start position:0%
of home brew so if anyone's worried
 
05:48:03.530 --> 05:48:03.540 align:start position:0%
about home oversight of Home growth home
 
05:48:05.930 --> 05:48:05.940 align:start position:0%
grow of cannabis it's probably going to
 
05:48:07.970 --> 05:48:07.980 align:start position:0%
be no different than home brew of beer
 
05:48:11.090 --> 05:48:11.100 align:start position:0%
and wine there's no Mass epidemic of uh
 
05:48:12.770 --> 05:48:12.780 align:start position:0%
you know problems with home brew and
 
05:48:14.330 --> 05:48:14.340 align:start position:0%
beer and wine even though you can have a
 
05:48:16.850 --> 05:48:16.860 align:start position:0%
100 gallons of each if you want to do
 
05:48:18.410 --> 05:48:18.420 align:start position:0%
100 gallons of wine 100 gallons of beer
 
05:48:19.490 --> 05:48:19.500 align:start position:0%
if you're married you can have 200
 
05:48:22.330 --> 05:48:22.340 align:start position:0%
gallons that's a lot of beer and wine
 
05:48:25.548 --> 05:48:25.558 align:start position:0%
so you know this hasn't even come close
 
05:48:27.530 --> 05:48:27.540 align:start position:0%
to those levels as far as usage levels I
 
05:48:29.390 --> 05:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
think this is a drop in the bucket but
 
05:48:30.788 --> 05:48:30.798 align:start position:0%
it's a great start
 
05:48:34.910 --> 05:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
we also have the influence of other
 
05:48:36.650 --> 05:48:36.660 align:start position:0%
states around us we heard testimony
 
05:48:39.070 --> 05:48:39.080 align:start position:0%
already not being able to afford things
 
05:48:41.208 --> 05:48:41.218 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty well off I can afford eggs
 
05:48:43.730 --> 05:48:43.740 align:start position:0%
nowadays but not everyone can you know
 
05:48:45.410 --> 05:48:45.420 align:start position:0%
uh am I going to run out and buy
 
05:48:46.548 --> 05:48:46.558 align:start position:0%
chickens I've actually had this
 
05:48:47.930 --> 05:48:47.940 align:start position:0%
discussion with my wife you know two
 
05:48:49.610 --> 05:48:49.620 align:start position:0%
doctors talking about getting chickens
 
05:48:51.110 --> 05:48:51.120 align:start position:0%
because it's it's
 
05:48:53.270 --> 05:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
a little expensive we're pulling it off
 
05:48:55.910 --> 05:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
but we've had the discussion
 
05:48:57.410 --> 05:48:57.420 align:start position:0%
um you know we're not growing tomatoes
 
05:49:00.708 --> 05:49:00.718 align:start position:0%
yet it's not that different we do have
 
05:49:02.330 --> 05:49:02.340 align:start position:0%
an herb garden on our countertop though
 
05:49:03.890 --> 05:49:03.900 align:start position:0%
where we grow oregano and basil but
 
05:49:05.150 --> 05:49:05.160 align:start position:0%
we're getting little plants I've
 
05:49:07.010 --> 05:49:07.020 align:start position:0%
actually killed a cactus before so this
 
05:49:08.570 --> 05:49:08.580 align:start position:0%
bill would not help me one bit if I
 
05:49:10.850 --> 05:49:10.860 align:start position:0%
decided to grow anything at home
 
05:49:13.548 --> 05:49:13.558 align:start position:0%
um there are also uh looking at the uh
 
05:49:15.530 --> 05:49:15.540 align:start position:0%
the influences of a home grow for not
 
05:49:17.750 --> 05:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
just choice and uh also people that
 
05:49:19.128 --> 05:49:19.138 align:start position:0%
aren't able to afford going out or
 
05:49:21.470 --> 05:49:21.480 align:start position:0%
driving putting five dollars worth of
 
05:49:22.730 --> 05:49:22.740 align:start position:0%
gas in your car and driving to another
 
05:49:22.740 --> 05:49:24.170 align:start position:0%
gas in your car and driving to another
state

05:49:24.170 --> 05:49:24.180 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:49:25.610 --> 05:49:25.620 align:start position:0%
um you know it also gives someone the
 
05:49:28.548 --> 05:49:28.558 align:start position:0%
option of not you know supporting big
 
05:49:29.750 --> 05:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
businesses that they don't want to
 
05:49:31.250 --> 05:49:31.260 align:start position:0%
support they want to support you know if
 
05:49:32.810 --> 05:49:32.820 align:start position:0%
since we don't even have Mom and Pops
 
05:49:34.430 --> 05:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
they don't have to go support big
 
05:49:36.770 --> 05:49:36.780 align:start position:0%
business and currently even if someone's
 
05:49:37.970 --> 05:49:37.980 align:start position:0%
buying on the illicit Market they're
 
05:49:39.590 --> 05:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
supporting big business the cartels
 
05:49:41.810 --> 05:49:41.820 align:start position:0%
everyone talks about they don't want big
 
05:49:43.610 --> 05:49:43.620 align:start position:0%
cannabis to come to New Hampshire it's
 
05:49:46.430 --> 05:49:46.440 align:start position:0%
here it's run by cartels and criminals
 
05:49:48.708 --> 05:49:48.718 align:start position:0%
so it already exists we want to make it
 
05:49:48.718 --> 05:49:50.150 align:start position:0%
so it already exists we want to make it
safer

05:49:50.150 --> 05:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
safer
 
05:49:51.770 --> 05:49:51.780 align:start position:0%
um are people going to be poisoned by
 
05:49:53.750 --> 05:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
this at home they're less likely I mean
 
05:49:56.030 --> 05:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
very people who use pesticides at home
 
05:49:57.350 --> 05:49:57.360 align:start position:0%
when they're growing little plants and
 
05:49:58.970 --> 05:49:58.980 align:start position:0%
Gardens they're also the mental and
 
05:50:00.530 --> 05:50:00.540 align:start position:0%
physical health benefits of gardening
 
05:50:02.570 --> 05:50:02.580 align:start position:0%
there's there's many studies out there I
 
05:50:04.128 --> 05:50:04.138 align:start position:0%
don't have them offhand but I'm sure you
 
05:50:05.930 --> 05:50:05.940 align:start position:0%
can quickly Google some of the benefits
 
05:50:08.330 --> 05:50:08.340 align:start position:0%
of gardening for reducing anxiety stress
 
05:50:10.670 --> 05:50:10.680 align:start position:0%
and the visible benefits um
 
05:50:12.830 --> 05:50:12.840 align:start position:0%
it's it's definitely something to
 
05:50:14.810 --> 05:50:14.820 align:start position:0%
consider this is only for adults
 
05:50:16.128 --> 05:50:16.138 align:start position:0%
children are not going to be doing this
 
05:50:18.048 --> 05:50:18.058 align:start position:0%
I'm not worried about my 16 year old son
 
05:50:19.310 --> 05:50:19.320 align:start position:0%
doing this but first of all it'll be
 
05:50:20.810 --> 05:50:20.820 align:start position:0%
illegal anyway because this is only for
 
05:50:22.730 --> 05:50:22.740 align:start position:0%
adults and he can't even clean his room
 
05:50:23.810 --> 05:50:23.820 align:start position:0%
so I'm not worried about him starting
 
05:50:25.310 --> 05:50:25.320 align:start position:0%
the garden
 
05:50:25.320 --> 05:50:26.410 align:start position:0%
the garden
um

05:50:26.410 --> 05:50:26.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:50:29.270 --> 05:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
and as far as the legality like we've
 
05:50:31.190 --> 05:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
heard it's everywhere nobody really has
 
05:50:32.750 --> 05:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
a problem of getting it this is just an
 
05:50:34.368 --> 05:50:34.378 align:start position:0%
option for people who would like to do
 
05:50:36.590 --> 05:50:36.600 align:start position:0%
it and it is a hobby for some people no
 
05:50:37.730 --> 05:50:37.740 align:start position:0%
one's going to be selling it it's not
 
05:50:39.110 --> 05:50:39.120 align:start position:0%
allowed to be sold they can give away a
 
05:50:40.910 --> 05:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
small amount so it's not even like the
 
05:50:42.350 --> 05:50:42.360 align:start position:0%
person like I was thinking if I get too
 
05:50:44.090 --> 05:50:44.100 align:start position:0%
many eggs when we get those chickens I
 
05:50:45.708 --> 05:50:45.718 align:start position:0%
can make a few bucks selling it selling
 
05:50:48.170 --> 05:50:48.180 align:start position:0%
them to offset the cost of my new Hen
 
05:50:50.150 --> 05:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
House and feed you can't even do that
 
05:50:51.770 --> 05:50:51.780 align:start position:0%
with this bill you you're not going to
 
05:50:53.090 --> 05:50:53.100 align:start position:0%
make money it's not going to support a
 
05:50:54.708 --> 05:50:54.718 align:start position:0%
small another business if someone does
 
05:50:56.030 --> 05:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
it they'd be breaking the current law
 
05:50:58.310 --> 05:50:58.320 align:start position:0%
anyway so it doesn't make any difference
 
05:51:00.350 --> 05:51:00.360 align:start position:0%
and the amounts are so small anyway that
 
05:51:01.190 --> 05:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
you're not going to have a thriving
 
05:51:03.288 --> 05:51:03.298 align:start position:0%
business with a few little plants that
 
05:51:04.730 --> 05:51:04.740 align:start position:0%
you can barely get going
 
05:51:04.740 --> 05:51:05.930 align:start position:0%
you can barely get going
so

05:51:05.930 --> 05:51:05.940 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:51:08.570 --> 05:51:08.580 align:start position:0%
um and and the last Point as far as the
 
05:51:10.430 --> 05:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
pervasiveness of cannabis in the state
 
05:51:12.530 --> 05:51:12.540 align:start position:0%
we know it's easy to get I mean it's
 
05:51:15.890 --> 05:51:15.900 align:start position:0%
been used and sold within about 50 feet
 
05:51:17.448 --> 05:51:17.458 align:start position:0%
of where I'm standing
 
05:51:20.030 --> 05:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
at least once that I know of and I think
 
05:51:21.530 --> 05:51:21.540 align:start position:0%
it's been reported in the paper too so
 
05:51:23.390 --> 05:51:23.400 align:start position:0%
this is not a problem that is outside
 
05:51:25.548 --> 05:51:25.558 align:start position:0%
these doors this is a problem that has
 
05:51:27.770 --> 05:51:27.780 align:start position:0%
been inside this building and this is
 
05:51:30.170 --> 05:51:30.180 align:start position:0%
not going to make the problem worse this
 
05:51:31.368 --> 05:51:31.378 align:start position:0%
is not going to be something that's
 
05:51:34.010 --> 05:51:34.020 align:start position:0%
going to really affect it much more than
 
05:51:35.390 --> 05:51:35.400 align:start position:0%
a few people that can't afford to go out
 
05:51:36.890 --> 05:51:36.900 align:start position:0%
or just have a hobby they'd like to to
 
05:51:38.628 --> 05:51:38.638 align:start position:0%
enjoy and maybe have a little safer
 
05:51:40.128 --> 05:51:40.138 align:start position:0%
product that isn't contaminated with
 
05:51:42.530 --> 05:51:42.540 align:start position:0%
pesticides or whatever else the cartels
 
05:51:43.970 --> 05:51:43.980 align:start position:0%
are using nowadays
 
05:51:46.430 --> 05:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to take any questions
 
05:51:49.970 --> 05:51:49.980 align:start position:0%
no thank you I have a few first of all
 
05:51:51.890 --> 05:51:51.900 align:start position:0%
on chickens are mean I have them I would
 
05:51:53.150 --> 05:51:53.160 align:start position:0%
not recommend them
 
05:51:55.548 --> 05:51:55.558 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry chickens are mean I have
 
05:51:58.150 --> 05:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
some I would I would not recommend
 
05:51:58.160 --> 05:51:59.930 align:start position:0%
some I would I would not recommend
actually

05:51:59.930 --> 05:51:59.940 align:start position:0%
actually
 
05:52:02.510 --> 05:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
um so from a launch law enforcement
 
05:52:05.570 --> 05:52:05.580 align:start position:0%
perspective you paint a very bucolic
 
05:52:07.368 --> 05:52:07.378 align:start position:0%
picture of you know the family having a
 
05:52:08.868 --> 05:52:08.878 align:start position:0%
little plant and it's nice they're
 
05:52:11.390 --> 05:52:11.400 align:start position:0%
talking to it but from a law enforcement
 
05:52:13.490 --> 05:52:13.500 align:start position:0%
perspective if we were to legalize
 
05:52:15.590 --> 05:52:15.600 align:start position:0%
personal growth
 
05:52:18.770 --> 05:52:18.780 align:start position:0%
how from a law and Sport law enforcement
 
05:52:21.230 --> 05:52:21.240 align:start position:0%
the way that they at least they used to
 
05:52:22.910 --> 05:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
be able to detect growth that was
 
05:52:25.368 --> 05:52:25.378 align:start position:0%
illegal in a home is one you'd look at
 
05:52:27.288 --> 05:52:27.298 align:start position:0%
it from a thermal camera and it would
 
05:52:28.788 --> 05:52:28.798 align:start position:0%
glow in New England in the middle of
 
05:52:30.948 --> 05:52:30.958 align:start position:0%
winter if you have a grow going
 
05:52:32.690 --> 05:52:32.700 align:start position:0%
um you pull the electric bills because
 
05:52:34.548 --> 05:52:34.558 align:start position:0%
those lights take a lot of energy of
 
05:52:36.650 --> 05:52:36.660 align:start position:0%
course now they're LED too so that went
 
05:52:38.030 --> 05:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
green as well
 
05:52:40.250 --> 05:52:40.260 align:start position:0%
um but how is it law enforcement officer
 
05:52:42.410 --> 05:52:42.420 align:start position:0%
to determine who's running an illegal
 
05:52:44.208 --> 05:52:44.218 align:start position:0%
grow operation in their basement versus
 
05:52:48.170 --> 05:52:48.180 align:start position:0%
the the hobbyist well the the higher
 
05:52:49.610 --> 05:52:49.620 align:start position:0%
amounts would still be illegal I'm sure
 
05:52:50.990 --> 05:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
they're going to employ the same methods
 
05:52:52.850 --> 05:52:52.860 align:start position:0%
they're currently using so nothing would
 
05:52:54.288 --> 05:52:54.298 align:start position:0%
change there except they might show up
 
05:52:55.670 --> 05:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
and be disappointed that it's only a hot
 
05:52:57.288 --> 05:52:57.298 align:start position:0%
tub bed maybe a steam room and three
 
05:52:59.150 --> 05:52:59.160 align:start position:0%
plants so there may be some
 
05:53:00.650 --> 05:53:00.660 align:start position:0%
disappointment for not having some of
 
05:53:02.570 --> 05:53:02.580 align:start position:0%
the larger busts and that's the only
 
05:53:04.070 --> 05:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
downside they're going to still do what
 
05:53:06.288 --> 05:53:06.298 align:start position:0%
they're doing uh and and most of the you
 
05:53:07.670 --> 05:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
know people I've talked to I definitely
 
05:53:08.810 --> 05:53:08.820 align:start position:0%
there's officers out there we've heard
 
05:53:10.430 --> 05:53:10.440 align:start position:0%
them that you know it's a horrible
 
05:53:12.470 --> 05:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
problem we have to stop I've yet to hear
 
05:53:16.070 --> 05:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
one uh talk about busting a big still
 
05:53:17.570 --> 05:53:17.580 align:start position:0%
operational where people are making too
 
05:53:19.070 --> 05:53:19.080 align:start position:0%
much beer and wine at home I mean it
 
05:53:20.810 --> 05:53:20.820 align:start position:0%
might happen but it's not some thing we
 
05:53:22.610 --> 05:53:22.620 align:start position:0%
have ever heard I've never heard in the
 
05:53:22.620 --> 05:53:24.410 align:start position:0%
have ever heard I've never heard in the
state

05:53:24.410 --> 05:53:24.420 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:53:26.030 --> 05:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
I believe that's more of a southern
 
05:53:26.040 --> 05:53:26.948 align:start position:0%
I believe that's more of a southern
problem

05:53:26.948 --> 05:53:26.958 align:start position:0%
problem
 
05:53:33.708 --> 05:53:33.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:36.350 --> 05:53:36.360 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question as you are
 
05:53:40.010 --> 05:53:40.020 align:start position:0%
a man maybe you could explain man things
 
05:53:42.830 --> 05:53:42.840 align:start position:0%
um I have been witness to
 
05:53:44.208 --> 05:53:44.218 align:start position:0%
um beer brewing
 
05:53:48.288 --> 05:53:48.298 align:start position:0%
and a beer brewing legal beer brewing in
 
05:53:51.288 --> 05:53:51.298 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and I observed that uh
 
05:53:53.868 --> 05:53:53.878 align:start position:0%
costs to purchase the equipment were
 
05:53:55.490 --> 05:53:55.500 align:start position:0%
shared between friends and there was
 
05:53:57.890 --> 05:53:57.900 align:start position:0%
sharing of the final product is that
 
05:54:00.590 --> 05:54:00.600 align:start position:0%
legal to your knowledge currently I
 
05:54:02.390 --> 05:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
don't think there's any prohibition on
 
05:54:04.490 --> 05:54:04.500 align:start position:0%
like the components of any of the things
 
05:54:06.288 --> 05:54:06.298 align:start position:0%
for making this up I mean you know you
 
05:54:08.150 --> 05:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
can make us make any of that stuff but
 
05:54:10.010 --> 05:54:10.020 align:start position:0%
just stuff you can find just any store
 
05:54:12.048 --> 05:54:12.058 align:start position:0%
you don't have to buy a separate thing
 
05:54:14.090 --> 05:54:14.100 align:start position:0%
there are kids you can buy you can mail
 
05:54:16.730 --> 05:54:16.740 align:start position:0%
order wine kits and beer kits uh when
 
05:54:18.530 --> 05:54:18.540 align:start position:0%
during prohibition there were there were
 
05:54:20.868 --> 05:54:20.878 align:start position:0%
actually you know you could buy you know
 
05:54:23.208 --> 05:54:23.218 align:start position:0%
kits online and online back then but you
 
05:54:24.708 --> 05:54:24.718 align:start position:0%
can buy kids through the serious catalog
 
05:54:26.090 --> 05:54:26.100 align:start position:0%
wherever it was back then they can make
 
05:54:27.410 --> 05:54:27.420 align:start position:0%
it home so
 
05:54:29.868 --> 05:54:29.878 align:start position:0%
um I don't I've never done it uh as far
 
05:54:32.448 --> 05:54:32.458 align:start position:0%
as beer and wine uh as someone who took
 
05:54:33.890 --> 05:54:33.900 align:start position:0%
a lot of chemistry classes as an
 
05:54:35.750 --> 05:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
undergrad I I was aware of how to make
 
05:54:38.930 --> 05:54:38.940 align:start position:0%
certain things but I never really
 
05:54:42.048 --> 05:54:42.058 align:start position:0%
shared flasks and speakers with
 
05:54:46.548 --> 05:54:46.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:49.610 --> 05:54:49.620 align:start position:0%
thank you for attention
 
05:54:50.868 --> 05:54:50.878 align:start position:0%
um is there anyone else wishing to
 
05:55:11.750 --> 05:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:13.730 --> 05:55:13.740 align:start position:0%
and we give for the record my name is
 
05:55:16.850 --> 05:55:16.860 align:start position:0%
Heather Marie Brown and I am in support
 
05:55:21.288 --> 05:55:21.298 align:start position:0%
of homegirl for New Hampshire citizens I
 
05:55:25.310 --> 05:55:25.320 align:start position:0%
think that this will serve just about
 
05:55:28.010 --> 05:55:28.020 align:start position:0%
every citizen that wants to take part in
 
05:55:31.010 --> 05:55:31.020 align:start position:0%
this including therapeutic cannabis
 
05:55:36.048 --> 05:55:36.058 align:start position:0%
patients for me I know one of the
 
05:55:39.890 --> 05:55:39.900 align:start position:0%
barriers of a patient to overcome is
 
05:55:43.490 --> 05:55:43.500 align:start position:0%
access and affordability to their
 
05:55:47.048 --> 05:55:47.058 align:start position:0%
cannabis while by allowing home grow
 
05:55:49.730 --> 05:55:49.740 align:start position:0%
whether for adult use or medicinal
 
05:55:49.740 --> 05:55:50.948 align:start position:0%
whether for adult use or medicinal
purposes

05:55:50.948 --> 05:55:50.958 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
05:55:55.190 --> 05:55:55.200 align:start position:0%
that gives me another option to cut down
 
05:55:57.830 --> 05:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
on those costs and expenses to have the
 
05:56:01.390 --> 05:56:01.400 align:start position:0%
access to what it is I would like
 
05:56:05.230 --> 05:56:05.240 align:start position:0%
in my own personal opinion growing
 
05:56:09.590 --> 05:56:09.600 align:start position:0%
cannabis is not any different to me than
 
05:56:13.610 --> 05:56:13.620 align:start position:0%
growing tomatoes or cucumbers and I've
 
05:56:16.490 --> 05:56:16.500 align:start position:0%
often found it humorous of you know what
 
05:56:19.190 --> 05:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
a big deal we make about the subject but
 
05:56:21.288 --> 05:56:21.298 align:start position:0%
nobody's outlawing tomatoes and
 
05:56:23.930 --> 05:56:23.940 align:start position:0%
cucumbers and they present a lot of the
 
05:56:27.048 --> 05:56:27.058 align:start position:0%
same issues with contamination mold and
 
05:56:29.930 --> 05:56:29.940 align:start position:0%
things like that as well
 
05:56:32.930 --> 05:56:32.940 align:start position:0%
um I do also think that
 
05:56:37.310 --> 05:56:37.320 align:start position:0%
by allowing home grow you are taking
 
05:56:37.320 --> 05:56:39.410 align:start position:0%
by allowing home grow you are taking
away

05:56:39.410 --> 05:56:39.420 align:start position:0%
away
 
05:56:41.448 --> 05:56:41.458 align:start position:0%
another piece of the puzzle when it
 
05:56:43.670 --> 05:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
comes to criminal activity within the
 
05:56:47.208 --> 05:56:47.218 align:start position:0%
state you are giving citizens another
 
05:56:51.190 --> 05:56:51.200 align:start position:0%
option instead of going an illegal route
 
05:56:54.170 --> 05:56:54.180 align:start position:0%
or jeopardizing by crossing state
 
05:56:54.180 --> 05:56:55.330 align:start position:0%
or jeopardizing by crossing state
borders

05:56:55.330 --> 05:56:55.340 align:start position:0%
borders
 
05:56:59.510 --> 05:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
I think that this is a great start and
 
05:57:02.990 --> 05:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
an excellent way to start showing that
 
05:57:05.330 --> 05:57:05.340 align:start position:0%
we care about New Hampshire citizens
 
05:57:09.048 --> 05:57:09.058 align:start position:0%
safety and that we actually want to make
 
05:57:13.368 --> 05:57:13.378 align:start position:0%
an improvement in crime in regards to
 
05:57:19.730 --> 05:57:19.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:21.890 --> 05:57:21.900 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
05:57:23.690 --> 05:57:23.700 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else wishing that test
 
05:57:25.788 --> 05:57:25.798 align:start position:0%
upon HP 344
 
05:57:28.070 --> 05:57:28.080 align:start position:0%
there'll be none I will hereby close the
 
05:57:30.948 --> 05:57:30.958 align:start position:0%

uh thank you for for hearing me again uh
 
06:06:40.788 --> 06:06:40.798 align:start position:0%
I'll I just want to talk about a couple
 
06:06:42.470 --> 06:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
brief things about uh some of the
 
06:06:44.810 --> 06:06:44.820 align:start position:0%
substances that it basically addresses
 
06:06:47.030 --> 06:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
psychedelic substances which are
 
06:06:49.610 --> 06:06:49.620 align:start position:0%
generally considered not addictive
 
06:06:51.470 --> 06:06:51.480 align:start position:0%
um and
 
06:06:54.170 --> 06:06:54.180 align:start position:0%
the main effect people get are you know
 
06:06:57.708 --> 06:06:57.718 align:start position:0%
a visual sensation changes
 
06:07:00.170 --> 06:07:00.180 align:start position:0%
um people do not get compulsive use they
 
06:07:01.490 --> 06:07:01.500 align:start position:0%
don't feel like they have to use it they
 
06:07:03.830 --> 06:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
don't get any withdrawal if they don't
 
06:07:06.708 --> 06:07:06.718 align:start position:0%
use it the only negative effect of using
 
06:07:10.090 --> 06:07:10.100 align:start position:0%
it over time is there can be a decreased
 
06:07:11.990 --> 06:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
threshold you might have to take a
 
06:07:13.610 --> 06:07:13.620 align:start position:0%
little more to get the same effect over
 
06:07:13.620 --> 06:07:15.288 align:start position:0%
little more to get the same effect over
time

06:07:15.288 --> 06:07:15.298 align:start position:0%
time
 
06:07:15.298 --> 06:07:16.368 align:start position:0%
time
um

06:07:16.368 --> 06:07:16.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:07:18.590 --> 06:07:18.600 align:start position:0%
you know this is It's the substances
 
06:07:20.868 --> 06:07:20.878 align:start position:0%
have been around LSD is one of the newer
 
06:07:22.310 --> 06:07:22.320 align:start position:0%
substances on the more synthetic ones
 
06:07:23.750 --> 06:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
but some of the other things like peyote
 
06:07:25.548 --> 06:07:25.558 align:start position:0%
and mescaline have been around for for
 
06:07:27.890 --> 06:07:27.900 align:start position:0%
Millennia have been used in spiritual uh
 
06:07:30.230 --> 06:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
for Spiritual purposes uh recreational
 
06:07:30.240 --> 06:07:32.208 align:start position:0%

06:07:35.570 --> 06:07:35.580 align:start position:0%
um in fact uh the founder of Alcoholics
 
06:07:37.070 --> 06:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
Anonymous Bill Wilson one of the
 
06:07:39.890 --> 06:07:39.900 align:start position:0%
co-founders uh relied on it heavily and
 
06:07:42.170 --> 06:07:42.180 align:start position:0%
use it as a tool uh considered a part of
 
06:07:43.788 --> 06:07:43.798 align:start position:0%
a tool for the 12 Steps so before what
 
06:07:45.770 --> 06:07:45.780 align:start position:0%
you heard me say about the history of
 
06:07:47.690 --> 06:07:47.700 align:start position:0%
substance use treatment in this country
 
06:07:50.030 --> 06:07:50.040 align:start position:0%
has predominantly been abstinence based
 
06:07:53.030 --> 06:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
it wasn't always that way in the very
 
06:07:54.948 --> 06:07:54.958 align:start position:0%
beginning one of the founders was a
 
06:07:57.288 --> 06:07:57.298 align:start position:0%
strong proponent of psychedelic
 
06:07:59.690 --> 06:07:59.700 align:start position:0%
substances like LST for a spiritual
 
06:08:01.368 --> 06:08:01.378 align:start position:0%
awakening and his spiritual awakening
 
06:08:04.250 --> 06:08:04.260 align:start position:0%
that he wrote about and founded a lot of
 
06:08:06.288 --> 06:08:06.298 align:start position:0%
the 12 steps on was from an experience
 
06:08:11.030 --> 06:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
he had uh under the influence of LSD he
 
06:08:12.530 --> 06:08:12.540 align:start position:0%
even wrote to the Swift psychologist
 
06:08:14.448 --> 06:08:14.458 align:start position:0%
Carl Young back in 61 about it talking
 
06:08:16.250 --> 06:08:16.260 align:start position:0%
about the need for a spiritual awakening
 
06:08:18.530 --> 06:08:18.540 align:start position:0%
for some uh what they call Die Hard
 
06:08:20.510 --> 06:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
alcoholics at the time and it's not
 
06:08:21.890 --> 06:08:21.900 align:start position:0%
something that they require I mean I
 
06:08:23.330 --> 06:08:23.340 align:start position:0%
went to a for years it's not something
 
06:08:25.010 --> 06:08:25.020 align:start position:0%
they gave out in meetings they don't do
 
06:08:26.448 --> 06:08:26.458 align:start position:0%
that it's not something for everyone
 
06:08:28.910 --> 06:08:28.920 align:start position:0%
even they that you know Dr Carl Young
 
06:08:30.830 --> 06:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
and Bill Wilson from AAA didn't say it
 
06:08:33.470 --> 06:08:33.480 align:start position:0%
was mandatory but it was just a tool
 
06:08:35.208 --> 06:08:35.218 align:start position:0%
that was available
 
06:08:37.850 --> 06:08:37.860 align:start position:0%
um I I did some you know I know that
 
06:08:39.410 --> 06:08:39.420 align:start position:0%
it's not addictive so I was wondering
 
06:08:41.030 --> 06:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
why it's even a schedule one it was just
 
06:08:42.770 --> 06:08:42.780 align:start position:0%
a question I and I kind of knew this but
 
06:08:44.570 --> 06:08:44.580 align:start position:0%
I forgot doing this for a while so I
 
06:08:47.090 --> 06:08:47.100 align:start position:0%
looked it back up and I found um a
 
06:08:48.890 --> 06:08:48.900 align:start position:0%
little pamphlet from the National Drug
 
06:08:50.510 --> 06:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
Intelligence Center as a component of
 
06:08:52.730 --> 06:08:52.740 align:start position:0%
the U.S Department of Justice and it
 
06:08:54.890 --> 06:08:54.900 align:start position:0%
says little handout says is LSD legal
 
06:08:56.810 --> 06:08:56.820 align:start position:0%
yes schedule one substance under
 
06:08:58.730 --> 06:08:58.740 align:start position:0%
controlled substance act schedule on
 
06:09:01.730 --> 06:09:01.740 align:start position:0%
drugs which include heroin MDMA and has
 
06:09:04.070 --> 06:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
a uh they have a high potential for
 
06:09:08.150 --> 06:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:08.160 --> 06:09:09.708 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:09:09.708 --> 06:09:09.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:09:12.170 --> 06:09:12.180 align:start position:0%
and then in the same pamphlet it says
 
06:09:15.470 --> 06:09:15.480 align:start position:0%
that uh where is it it's not considered
 
06:09:17.030 --> 06:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
in the same pamphlet a different section
 
06:09:18.830 --> 06:09:18.840 align:start position:0%
it says it's not considered addictive an
 
06:09:20.090 --> 06:09:20.100 align:start position:0%
addictive drug
 
06:09:22.070 --> 06:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
and that it does not produce compulsive
 
06:09:24.170 --> 06:09:24.180 align:start position:0%
drug-seeking Behavior as cocaine heroin
 
06:09:26.208 --> 06:09:26.218 align:start position:0%
and methamphetamine however they can
 
06:09:27.890 --> 06:09:27.900 align:start position:0%
develop resistance over time and need
 
06:09:30.770 --> 06:09:30.780 align:start position:0%
more to get the same effects so it's
 
06:09:32.628 --> 06:09:32.638 align:start position:0%
it's illegal because it's a schedule one
 
06:09:34.610 --> 06:09:34.620 align:start position:0%
drug and has no medicinal value and it
 
06:09:36.650 --> 06:09:36.660 align:start position:0%
causes compulsive use and the same
 
06:09:37.910 --> 06:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
pamphlet for the government is telling
 
06:09:40.548 --> 06:09:40.558 align:start position:0%
us it doesn't really do that
 
06:09:41.570 --> 06:09:41.580 align:start position:0%
um they don't even have their story
 
06:09:43.128 --> 06:09:43.138 align:start position:0%
straight this is not something that has
 
06:09:44.868 --> 06:09:44.878 align:start position:0%
has been a Scourge or a problem in any
 
06:09:47.930 --> 06:09:47.940 align:start position:0%
way people do use it now does does could
 
06:09:49.368 --> 06:09:49.378 align:start position:0%
someone do something under the influence
 
06:09:50.628 --> 06:09:50.638 align:start position:0%
of a psychedelic substance it might not
 
06:09:53.750 --> 06:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
be safe absolutely uh but that doesn't
 
06:09:56.150 --> 06:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
mean that it's a compulsive addictive uh
 
06:09:56.160 --> 06:09:57.350 align:start position:0%
mean that it's a compulsive addictive uh
substance

06:09:57.350 --> 06:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
substance
 
06:09:57.360 --> 06:09:58.670 align:start position:0%
substance
um

06:09:58.670 --> 06:09:58.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:10:01.250 --> 06:10:01.260 align:start position:0%
so anyway that's really I'm happy to
 
06:10:04.788 --> 06:10:04.798 align:start position:0%
answer questions on it and um
 
06:10:06.470 --> 06:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
that's about it I know there's probably
 
06:10:07.850 --> 06:10:07.860 align:start position:0%
not a lot of speakers for this bill so
 
06:10:11.930 --> 06:10:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:13.310 --> 06:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
there'll be none thank you for your
 
06:10:13.320 --> 06:10:18.890 align:start position:0%
there'll be none thank you for your
testimony

06:10:18.890 --> 06:10:18.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:22.250 --> 06:10:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:29.448 --> 06:10:29.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:32.510 --> 06:10:32.520 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm here to speak in favor of
 
06:10:35.810 --> 06:10:35.820 align:start position:0%
this bill I wanted to give some
 
06:10:37.970 --> 06:10:37.980 align:start position:0%
supportive testimony to the gentleman
 
06:10:41.628 --> 06:10:41.638 align:start position:0%
who just just spoke I'm a member of an
 
06:10:44.750 --> 06:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
Alcoholics Anonymous I have had some
 
06:10:46.250 --> 06:10:46.260 align:start position:0%
Addiction in my background
 
06:10:50.868 --> 06:10:50.878 align:start position:0%
and I see the terrible terrible
 
06:10:50.878 --> 06:10:51.970 align:start position:0%
and I see the terrible terrible
um

06:10:51.970 --> 06:10:51.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:10:54.590 --> 06:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
effects of that addiction not just
 
06:10:56.510 --> 06:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
inside the rooms and inside the halls of
 
06:10:57.770 --> 06:10:57.780 align:start position:0%
AAA but on the streets of Manchester
 
06:11:00.230 --> 06:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
where I live it's everywhere it's uh
 
06:11:02.330 --> 06:11:02.340 align:start position:0%
really a problem
 
06:11:05.830 --> 06:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
however as the gentleman before me said
 
06:11:09.830 --> 06:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
this is the LSD is what Bill Wilson
 
06:11:12.410 --> 06:11:12.420 align:start position:0%
received his spiritual awakening on the
 
06:11:14.448 --> 06:11:14.458 align:start position:0%
whole premise of Alcoholics Anonymous is
 
06:11:17.030 --> 06:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
based on a spiritual awakening and a
 
06:11:18.530 --> 06:11:18.540 align:start position:0%
spiritual experience
 
06:11:20.930 --> 06:11:20.940 align:start position:0%
having connection with conscious contact
 
06:11:22.430 --> 06:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
with the higher power is the only thing
 
06:11:24.890 --> 06:11:24.900 align:start position:0%
that's going to relieve the symptoms of
 
06:11:24.900 --> 06:11:26.810 align:start position:0%
that's going to relieve the symptoms of
alcoholism

06:11:26.810 --> 06:11:26.820 align:start position:0%
alcoholism
 
06:11:26.820 --> 06:11:28.490 align:start position:0%
alcoholism
so

06:11:28.490 --> 06:11:28.500 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:11:32.090 --> 06:11:32.100 align:start position:0%
um this is the foundation of the most
 
06:11:34.750 --> 06:11:34.760 align:start position:0%
popular and most successful
 
06:11:37.730 --> 06:11:37.740 align:start position:0%
recovery program in the world has ever
 
06:11:37.740 --> 06:11:38.690 align:start position:0%

06:11:38.690 --> 06:11:38.700 align:start position:0%
seen
 
06:11:42.410 --> 06:11:42.420 align:start position:0%
this substance LSD and to speak to the
 
06:11:45.170 --> 06:11:45.180 align:start position:0%
safety a normal a normal dosage is
 
06:11:48.650 --> 06:11:48.660 align:start position:0%
between 50 and 150 micrograms now
 
06:11:50.868 --> 06:11:50.878 align:start position:0%
there's never been a recorded death from
 
06:11:53.350 --> 06:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
an overdose of LSD
 
06:11:58.788 --> 06:11:58.798 align:start position:0%
and the guess at what an overdose would
 
06:12:00.770 --> 06:12:00.780 align:start position:0%
look like would be 14
 
06:12:02.628 --> 06:12:02.638 align:start position:0%
000 micrograms
 
06:12:02.638 --> 06:12:04.250 align:start position:0%
000 micrograms
okay

06:12:04.250 --> 06:12:04.260 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:12:07.128 --> 06:12:07.138 align:start position:0%
um that would be 14
 
06:12:09.830 --> 06:12:09.840 align:start position:0%

there's been zero overdose deaths ever

representative Gathering to introduce

thank you Mr chair

I am Linda gathright from Hillsborough

10 out of Nashua and I am introducing
 
06:48:12.708 --> 06:48:12.718 align:start position:0%
the bill for representative David Muse
 
06:48:15.468 --> 06:48:15.478 align:start position:0%
who could not be here today
 
06:48:18.350 --> 06:48:18.360 align:start position:0%
and I will read his testimony that he
 
06:48:22.128 --> 06:48:22.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:24.048 --> 06:48:24.058 align:start position:0%
While others will give testimony today
 
06:48:26.390 --> 06:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
on full scope of the problem and related
 
06:48:28.490 --> 06:48:28.500 align:start position:0%
efforts in harm reduction Community to
 
06:48:31.250 --> 06:48:31.260 align:start position:0%
save lives I'd like to focus on what we
 
06:48:35.448 --> 06:48:35.458 align:start position:0%
can achieve by passing hb70 470
 
06:48:37.730 --> 06:48:37.740 align:start position:0%
the first thing the bill would do is
 
06:48:39.650 --> 06:48:39.660 align:start position:0%
provide an essential update to New
 
06:48:41.930 --> 06:48:41.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's controlled Drug Act
 
06:48:44.990 --> 06:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
under our current Law Drug checking
 
06:48:47.330 --> 06:48:47.340 align:start position:0%
equipment such as fentanyl test strips
 
06:48:50.208 --> 06:48:50.218 align:start position:0%
is considered to be drug paraphernalia
 
06:48:54.468 --> 06:48:54.478 align:start position:0%
and possession is illegal what hb470
 
06:48:56.990 --> 06:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
would do is carve out an exception in
 
06:48:59.510 --> 06:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
our Drug law for drug checking equipment
 
06:49:03.170 --> 06:49:03.180 align:start position:0%
such as fentanyl fentanyl test strips it
 
06:49:05.810 --> 06:49:05.820 align:start position:0%
does does this by specifically removing
 
06:49:08.628 --> 06:49:08.638 align:start position:0%
products from the current definition of
 
06:49:11.570 --> 06:49:11.580 align:start position:0%
drug paraphernalia that process prepare
 
06:49:16.850 --> 06:49:16.860 align:start position:0%
test analyze package repackage store or
 
06:49:18.288 --> 06:49:18.298 align:start position:0%
contain drugs
 
06:49:20.510 --> 06:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
the bill also adds critical definition
 
06:49:22.730 --> 06:49:22.740 align:start position:0%
for drug checking
 
06:49:25.610 --> 06:49:25.620 align:start position:0%
drug checking equipment drug supplies
 
06:49:29.030 --> 06:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
and Drug Packaging it also specifically
 
06:49:32.510 --> 06:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
excludes drug checking equipment such as
 
06:49:35.208 --> 06:49:35.218 align:start position:0%
fentanyl test fits from our definition
 
06:49:38.448 --> 06:49:38.458 align:start position:0%
of drug paraphernalia
 
06:49:40.250 --> 06:49:40.260 align:start position:0%
for the first time in New Hampshire drug
 
06:49:43.310 --> 06:49:43.320 align:start position:0%
law the bills also defines the concept
 
06:49:45.048 --> 06:49:45.058 align:start position:0%
of harm reduction
 
06:49:47.628 --> 06:49:47.638 align:start position:0%
harm reduction strategies aim to reduce
 
06:49:50.270 --> 06:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
the negative consequences of drug use
 
06:49:53.150 --> 06:49:53.160 align:start position:0%
such as overdose deaths and the spread
 
06:49:56.030 --> 06:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
of HIV and hepatitis rather than trying
 
06:49:58.490 --> 06:49:58.500 align:start position:0%
to eliminate drug use altogether
 
06:50:00.830 --> 06:50:00.840 align:start position:0%
by providing a way for users to test
 
06:50:03.830 --> 06:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
their drugs safely drug checking
 
06:50:07.070 --> 06:50:07.080 align:start position:0%
products like fentanyl test strips are
 
06:50:09.468 --> 06:50:09.478 align:start position:0%
harm reduction strategy that can help to
 
06:50:11.390 --> 06:50:11.400 align:start position:0%
reduce the negative consequences of drug
 
06:50:11.400 --> 06:50:12.410 align:start position:0%
reduce the negative consequences of drug
use

06:50:12.410 --> 06:50:12.420 align:start position:0%
use
 
06:50:14.510 --> 06:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
one argument against making it easier
 
06:50:16.250 --> 06:50:16.260 align:start position:0%
for users to check their drugs for
 
06:50:19.670 --> 06:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
safety is that it cuddles drug users and
 
06:50:22.190 --> 06:50:22.200 align:start position:0%
only encourage them to use more drugs
 
06:50:24.890 --> 06:50:24.900 align:start position:0%
but the reality is the alternative to
 
06:50:26.810 --> 06:50:26.820 align:start position:0%
drug checking equipment is not knowing
 
06:50:30.410 --> 06:50:30.420 align:start position:0%
and the very real risk of overdoses and
 
06:50:32.750 --> 06:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
deaths that add to the burden of our
 
06:50:34.788 --> 06:50:34.798 align:start position:0%
Health Care system and our law
 
06:50:37.190 --> 06:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
enforcement Community every day
 
06:50:40.310 --> 06:50:40.320 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is that it was your son
 
06:50:42.230 --> 06:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
or daughter holding a bottle of mystery
 
06:50:44.990 --> 06:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
pills sold to them on the street with no
 
06:50:47.090 --> 06:50:47.100 align:start position:0%
real Assurance of what they actually
 
06:50:49.548 --> 06:50:49.558 align:start position:0%
contain wouldn't you want them to be
 
06:50:51.890 --> 06:50:51.900 align:start position:0%
able to perform a quick inexpensive test
 
06:50:54.770 --> 06:50:54.780 align:start position:0%
that would let them know for sure
 
06:50:56.750 --> 06:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
the bill will allow them to do that
 
06:50:59.690 --> 06:50:59.700 align:start position:0%
legally with much less risk of fatal
 
06:50:59.700 --> 06:51:01.128 align:start position:0%
legally with much less risk of fatal
consequences

06:51:01.128 --> 06:51:01.138 align:start position:0%
consequences
 
06:51:04.368 --> 06:51:04.378 align:start position:0%
please send HB 470 onto the Full House
 
06:51:08.990 --> 06:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:11.030 --> 06:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
and I have a citation
 
06:51:15.190 --> 06:51:15.200 align:start position:0%
that was given by organization called
 
06:51:17.390 --> 06:51:17.400 align:start position:0%
medicalexpress.com you guys can go there
 
06:51:19.850 --> 06:51:19.860 align:start position:0%
and take a look at that but they talked
 
06:51:22.430 --> 06:51:22.440 align:start position:0%
to the greater harm and the greater
 
06:51:24.350 --> 06:51:24.360 align:start position:0%
deaths that were soaring with black
 
06:51:27.288 --> 06:51:27.298 align:start position:0%
teens in the United States
 
06:51:34.730 --> 06:51:34.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:45.230 --> 06:51:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:47.750 --> 06:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
hello again uh last time I promised for
 
06:51:49.610 --> 06:51:49.620 align:start position:0%
the day
 
06:51:52.548 --> 06:51:52.558 align:start position:0%
um I'm in favor of House Bill 470 a
 
06:51:55.610 --> 06:51:55.620 align:start position:0%
little background I was I I wrote a bill
 
06:51:58.190 --> 06:51:58.200 align:start position:0%
to allow some service programs back when
 
06:52:02.030 --> 06:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
I was here in 2015 I guess it was uh it
 
06:52:03.548 --> 06:52:03.558 align:start position:0%
didn't pass became another bill later
 
06:52:05.750 --> 06:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
and now we'll have syringe service
 
06:52:08.090 --> 06:52:08.100 align:start position:0%
programs around the state uh which are
 
06:52:10.670 --> 06:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
allowed to have uh fentanyl test strips
 
06:52:12.048 --> 06:52:12.058 align:start position:0%
and things like that be used as a part
 
06:52:13.368 --> 06:52:13.378 align:start position:0%
of a program but this would allow it
 
06:52:15.530 --> 06:52:15.540 align:start position:0%
just in you know at a broader level and
 
06:52:17.990 --> 06:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
they could be given out more freely
 
06:52:20.628 --> 06:52:20.638 align:start position:0%
I think it's very important one thing we
 
06:52:22.368 --> 06:52:22.378 align:start position:0%
have to understand about uh substance
 
06:52:24.410 --> 06:52:24.420 align:start position:0%
use and we've we've I've discussed this
 
06:52:26.330 --> 06:52:26.340 align:start position:0%
with lots of people and some of them
 
06:52:28.850 --> 06:52:28.860 align:start position:0%
here is one of the most dangerous things
 
06:52:31.128 --> 06:52:31.138 align:start position:0%
about drug use is not knowing what
 
06:52:32.150 --> 06:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
they're taking
 
06:52:34.190 --> 06:52:34.200 align:start position:0%
uh if you went to the state liquor store
 
06:52:35.690 --> 06:52:35.700 align:start position:0%
and you bought you know well they don't
 
06:52:37.368 --> 06:52:37.378 align:start position:0%
sell beer but if you bought a six pack
 
06:52:39.230 --> 06:52:39.240 align:start position:0%
of beer and one out of six beers could
 
06:52:42.650 --> 06:52:42.660 align:start position:0%
kill you you know that's a problem uh
 
06:52:44.750 --> 06:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
knowing what was in every beer if one of
 
06:52:46.490 --> 06:52:46.500 align:start position:0%
them was the bad one or more dangerous
 
06:52:47.868 --> 06:52:47.878 align:start position:0%
that would be a good bit of information
 
06:52:49.730 --> 06:52:49.740 align:start position:0%
to have
 
06:52:52.128 --> 06:52:52.138 align:start position:0%
um and it's not just about uh you know
 
06:52:54.350 --> 06:52:54.360 align:start position:0%
finding out whether something I spent or
 
06:52:56.150 --> 06:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
not I don't tell people that are using
 
06:52:58.610 --> 06:52:58.620 align:start position:0%
uh fentanyl to test every time they get
 
06:53:00.288 --> 06:53:00.298 align:start position:0%
fentanyl just New Hampshire has very
 
06:53:02.570 --> 06:53:02.580 align:start position:0%
little heroin if they're using heroin
 
06:53:04.430 --> 06:53:04.440 align:start position:0%
they're really using fentanyl for the
 
06:53:06.468 --> 06:53:06.478 align:start position:0%
most part there's almost almost none I
 
06:53:07.730 --> 06:53:07.740 align:start position:0%
can't remember the last time we've had a
 
06:53:10.430 --> 06:53:10.440 align:start position:0%
heroin only overdose they're either poly
 
06:53:12.288 --> 06:53:12.298 align:start position:0%
substance use and most of them contain
 
06:53:15.770 --> 06:53:15.780 align:start position:0%
Fentanyl so it's really important to to
 
06:53:17.448 --> 06:53:17.458 align:start position:0%
test other substances whether it's
 
06:53:20.448 --> 06:53:20.458 align:start position:0%
cocaine methamphetamines and and most
 
06:53:23.030 --> 06:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
importantly if they're using uh pills
 
06:53:25.910 --> 06:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
because the black market for uh
 
06:53:28.310 --> 06:53:28.320 align:start position:0%
counterfeit pills is much
 
06:53:30.590 --> 06:53:30.600 align:start position:0%
greater and it's increasing all the time
 
06:53:32.990 --> 06:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
back in the day it was Percocets in the
 
06:53:34.128 --> 06:53:34.138 align:start position:0%
street were about a dollar a milligram
 
06:53:36.288 --> 06:53:36.298 align:start position:0%
now it's even more it's really hard to
 
06:53:37.670 --> 06:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
get because we've cracked down so much
 
06:53:40.788 --> 06:53:40.798 align:start position:0%
on over prescribing and that did drop
 
06:53:43.430 --> 06:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
the overdose result overdose deaths that
 
06:53:46.190 --> 06:53:46.200 align:start position:0%
resulted from prescription drug use but
 
06:53:47.570 --> 06:53:47.580 align:start position:0%
every state that Institute in one of
 
06:53:50.208 --> 06:53:50.218 align:start position:0%
those programs had a drop in that in
 
06:53:51.830 --> 06:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
those deaths had a corresponding
 
06:53:54.048 --> 06:53:54.058 align:start position:0%
increase in debts from other Street and
 
06:53:56.150 --> 06:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
illicit drugs so where there's a will
 
06:53:57.410 --> 06:53:57.420 align:start position:0%
there's a way they're going to find a
 
06:53:59.090 --> 06:53:59.100 align:start position:0%
way to do this and right now one of the
 
06:54:01.310 --> 06:54:01.320 align:start position:0%
more more and I wouldn't say genius but
 
06:54:02.810 --> 06:54:02.820 align:start position:0%
the way they're doing it is is pressing
 
06:54:04.968 --> 06:54:04.978 align:start position:0%
pills and making other substances so
 
06:54:07.010 --> 06:54:07.020 align:start position:0%
it's really important to to know what's
 
06:54:08.930 --> 06:54:08.940 align:start position:0%
what they're taking
 
06:54:10.368 --> 06:54:10.378 align:start position:0%
um and and something that didn't even
 
06:54:11.810 --> 06:54:11.820 align:start position:0%
occur to me until was pointed out by one
 
06:54:13.310 --> 06:54:13.320 align:start position:0%
of your honest team members earlier is
 
06:54:13.320 --> 06:54:14.690 align:start position:0%
of your honest team members earlier is
uh

06:54:14.690 --> 06:54:14.700 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:54:16.548 --> 06:54:16.558 align:start position:0%
check your kids stuff at home if they've
 
06:54:17.690 --> 06:54:17.700 align:start position:0%
got something you're not sure about you
 
06:54:18.708 --> 06:54:18.718 align:start position:0%
can check it
 
06:54:20.868 --> 06:54:20.878 align:start position:0%
and I've got to go because I've got to
 
06:54:22.788 --> 06:54:22.798 align:start position:0%
go go through my son's room when I get
 
06:54:25.610 --> 06:54:25.620 align:start position:0%
home so I'd really appreciate if you
 
06:54:27.350 --> 06:54:27.360 align:start position:0%
pass this bill it's it's definitely a
 
06:54:28.610 --> 06:54:28.620 align:start position:0%
life-saving bill no matter what you
 
06:54:30.590 --> 06:54:30.600 align:start position:0%
think about it being enabling Behavior
 
06:54:33.110 --> 06:54:33.120 align:start position:0%
or anything like that it's you know it's
 
06:54:34.548 --> 06:54:34.558 align:start position:0%
enabling people to check to make sure
 
06:54:36.530 --> 06:54:36.540 align:start position:0%
something is what it says it is and you
 
06:54:38.570 --> 06:54:38.580 align:start position:0%
know we we want everything to be what it
 
06:54:40.310 --> 06:54:40.320 align:start position:0%
says it is and this is one way we can
 
06:54:45.048 --> 06:54:45.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:49.070 --> 06:54:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:51.650 --> 06:54:51.660 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question do you
 
06:54:53.890 --> 06:54:53.900 align:start position:0%
know or could you speak to whether
 
06:54:57.730 --> 06:54:57.740 align:start position:0%
repeated exposure to like increasingly
 
06:55:02.628 --> 06:55:02.638 align:start position:0%
stronger doses like unexpectedly higher
 
06:55:06.288 --> 06:55:06.298 align:start position:0%
potency of drugs might um play into
 
06:55:09.288 --> 06:55:09.298 align:start position:0%
someone's level of addiction or their
 
06:55:13.310 --> 06:55:13.320 align:start position:0%
experience in taking illicit drugs you
 
06:55:15.288 --> 06:55:15.298 align:start position:0%
mean specifically like Fentanyl
 
06:55:17.510 --> 06:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm saying like
 
06:55:20.090 --> 06:55:20.100 align:start position:0%
instead of if one in every six beers
 
06:55:22.490 --> 06:55:22.500 align:start position:0%
kills you if one in every six Bill beers
 
06:55:25.128 --> 06:55:25.138 align:start position:0%
is vodka right and you're an alcoholic
 
06:55:26.930 --> 06:55:26.940 align:start position:0%
how is that
 
06:55:31.128 --> 06:55:31.138 align:start position:0%
how is your inability to manage
 
06:55:33.350 --> 06:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
um the content of what you're consuming
 
06:55:35.390 --> 06:55:35.400 align:start position:0%
how does that play into the experience
 
06:55:37.490 --> 06:55:37.500 align:start position:0%
of addiction
 
06:55:38.990 --> 06:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
I imagine it would make it worse I mean
 
06:55:40.368 --> 06:55:40.378 align:start position:0%
I don't know the literature involved in
 
06:55:42.830 --> 06:55:42.840 align:start position:0%
the strength of you know how it affects
 
06:55:44.090 --> 06:55:44.100 align:start position:0%
it but I know that if you take more of
 
06:55:45.410 --> 06:55:45.420 align:start position:0%
something you can develop tolerance for
 
06:55:48.048 --> 06:55:48.058 align:start position:0%
certain substances alcohol uh opioids
 
06:55:50.570 --> 06:55:50.580 align:start position:0%
especially and as we heard earlier with
 
06:55:52.010 --> 06:55:52.020 align:start position:0%
psychedelic drugs but they won't kill
 
06:55:52.020 --> 06:55:53.030 align:start position:0%
psychedelic drugs but they won't kill
you

06:55:53.030 --> 06:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:55:55.128 --> 06:55:55.138 align:start position:0%
um so I think it's important to know
 
06:55:56.750 --> 06:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
what you're taking no matter what it is
 
06:55:59.030 --> 06:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
I mean I put seasonings on my food I'd
 
06:55:59.990 --> 06:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
like to know that it's not the super
 
06:56:01.788 --> 06:56:01.798 align:start position:0%
concentrated hot sauce my son bought at
 
06:56:03.230 --> 06:56:03.240 align:start position:0%
the spice store in Boston last week
 
06:56:04.910 --> 06:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
because that was not an exciting thing
 
06:56:07.128 --> 06:56:07.138 align:start position:0%
to find out really need to know what
 
06:56:08.030 --> 06:56:08.040 align:start position:0%
you're getting
 
06:56:10.368 --> 06:56:10.378 align:start position:0%
and and one thing with these test strips
 
06:56:12.530 --> 06:56:12.540 align:start position:0%
that we commonly use now just tell you
 
06:56:14.628 --> 06:56:14.638 align:start position:0%
whether it has fentanyl or not and you
 
06:56:16.010 --> 06:56:16.020 align:start position:0%
can get them for different substances
 
06:56:17.448 --> 06:56:17.458 align:start position:0%
and that's a great thing to have for all
 
06:56:18.530 --> 06:56:18.540 align:start position:0%
kinds of different drugs if you're
 
06:56:20.270 --> 06:56:20.280 align:start position:0%
trying to test for things uh some places
 
06:56:21.590 --> 06:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
in Europe and around the world have
 
06:56:23.570 --> 06:56:23.580 align:start position:0%
actually had you know concerts or par or
 
06:56:25.670 --> 06:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
big venues or they'll have a drug
 
06:56:26.990 --> 06:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
checking station
 
06:56:28.670 --> 06:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
and we know they're happening in there
 
06:56:30.468 --> 06:56:30.478 align:start position:0%
and it's a safer I think it's a great
 
06:56:32.270 --> 06:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
idea that way you can check and see what
 
06:56:34.310 --> 06:56:34.320 align:start position:0%
you know people are doing they're not
 
06:56:35.150 --> 06:56:35.160 align:start position:0%
going to get something that's going to
 
06:56:38.510 --> 06:56:38.520 align:start position:0%
kill them the other thing is
 
06:56:42.410 --> 06:56:42.420 align:start position:0%
um well all right any more questions
 
06:56:42.420 --> 06:56:43.788 align:start position:0%
um well all right any more questions
no

06:56:43.788 --> 06:56:43.798 align:start position:0%
no
 
06:56:49.310 --> 06:56:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:03.890 --> 06:57:03.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:06.650 --> 06:57:06.660 align:start position:0%
oh thank you very much good afternoon
 
06:57:08.270 --> 06:57:08.280 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I know you've
 
06:57:09.948 --> 06:57:09.958 align:start position:0%
had a long day so I'll be really brief
 
06:57:12.288 --> 06:57:12.298 align:start position:0%
and I have written testimony my name is
 
06:57:13.850 --> 06:57:13.860 align:start position:0%
Kate Bryan the vice president of
 
06:57:17.448 --> 06:57:17.458 align:start position:0%
advocacy for new Futures uh here in New
 
06:57:19.490 --> 06:57:19.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we're a non-profit nonpartisan
 
06:57:21.590 --> 06:57:21.600 align:start position:0%
organization that works on health and
 
06:57:23.930 --> 06:57:23.940 align:start position:0%
wellness policies in New Hampshire we
 
06:57:26.030 --> 06:57:26.040 align:start position:0%
work extensively with policy makers
 
06:57:28.070 --> 06:57:28.080 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and prevention Partners to
 
06:57:30.830 --> 06:57:30.840 align:start position:0%
prevent and reduce alcohol drug problems
 
06:57:33.170 --> 06:57:33.180 align:start position:0%
on our state but also we work very
 
06:57:34.850 --> 06:57:34.860 align:start position:0%
closely with recovery and treatment
 
06:57:37.490 --> 06:57:37.500 align:start position:0%
organizations as well as evidence-based
 
06:57:39.830 --> 06:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
arm reduction programs
 
06:57:42.830 --> 06:57:42.840 align:start position:0%
so as we all know we um the state
 
06:57:45.410 --> 06:57:45.420 align:start position:0%
experienced um still in the throes a
 
06:57:48.350 --> 06:57:48.360 align:start position:0%
somewhat of an opiate crisis epidemic it
 
06:57:52.670 --> 06:57:52.680 align:start position:0%
really peaked in 2017 with 490 deaths
 
06:57:54.830 --> 06:57:54.840 align:start position:0%
that year new Futures supported other
 
06:57:57.110 --> 06:57:57.120 align:start position:0%
harm reduction strategies
 
06:57:59.890 --> 06:57:59.900 align:start position:0%
um around that time including making
 
06:58:02.570 --> 06:58:02.580 align:start position:0%
Narcan more widely available in the Good
 
06:58:04.730 --> 06:58:04.740 align:start position:0%
Samaritan law because of these
 
06:58:07.250 --> 06:58:07.260 align:start position:0%
strategies along with improvements made
 
06:58:09.230 --> 06:58:09.240 align:start position:0%
across the continued care for substance
 
06:58:11.868 --> 06:58:11.878 align:start position:0%
use disorders we've seen a reduction of
 
06:58:15.830 --> 06:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
Overdose deaths from 2018 to 2021 while
 
06:58:17.690 --> 06:58:17.700 align:start position:0%
other states have continued to see
 
06:58:20.090 --> 06:58:20.100 align:start position:0%
increases in drug overdoses
 
06:58:23.208 --> 06:58:23.218 align:start position:0%
the testing kit such as fentanyl strips
 
06:58:26.090 --> 06:58:26.100 align:start position:0%
are one is an additional proven strategy
 
06:58:29.110 --> 06:58:29.120 align:start position:0%
to save lives according to CDC
 
06:58:32.750 --> 06:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
fps's retinol test strips are a low-cost
 
06:58:36.770 --> 06:58:36.780 align:start position:0%
method of helping prevent drug overdoses
 
06:58:38.810 --> 06:58:38.820 align:start position:0%
and reducing harm
 
06:58:41.390 --> 06:58:41.400 align:start position:0%
however the way the law is written now
 
06:58:43.368 --> 06:58:43.378 align:start position:0%
it would be considered drug
 
06:58:43.378 --> 06:58:45.070 align:start position:0%
it would be considered drug
paraphernalia

06:58:45.070 --> 06:58:45.080 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia
 
06:58:48.230 --> 06:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
so recent reports as we all know
 
06:58:51.110 --> 06:58:51.120 align:start position:0%
indicate that Sentinel is routinely
 
06:58:55.070 --> 06:58:55.080 align:start position:0%
mixed with other drugs and so hv470
 
06:58:57.708 --> 06:58:57.718 align:start position:0%
would allow one more tool in the toolbox
 
06:59:02.208 --> 06:59:02.218 align:start position:0%
as far as being able to test the drugs
 
06:59:05.090 --> 06:59:05.100 align:start position:0%
out there for fentanyl while we
 
06:59:07.128 --> 06:59:07.138 align:start position:0%
supported a similar Bill heard last week
 
06:59:09.770 --> 06:59:09.780 align:start position:0%
we do prefer this bill because it's a
 
06:59:11.390 --> 06:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
approach it's kind of a much more
 
06:59:14.170 --> 06:59:14.180 align:start position:0%
comprehensive approach to
 
06:59:16.850 --> 06:59:16.860 align:start position:0%
drug testing so we asked that the
 
06:59:19.910 --> 06:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
committee recommend onto pass on HB 470
 
06:59:23.510 --> 06:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
I have my testimony as well as a
 
06:59:25.730 --> 06:59:25.740 align:start position:0%
um article from International Journal of
 
06:59:27.410 --> 06:59:27.420 align:start position:0%
drug policy that I think you heard a lot
 
06:59:29.330 --> 06:59:29.340 align:start position:0%
about that I gotta just bring you a copy
 
06:59:31.250 --> 06:59:31.260 align:start position:0%
it has to do with the effectiveness of
 
06:59:35.990 --> 06:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:37.670 --> 06:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony if you want
 
06:59:42.110 --> 06:59:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:52.368 --> 06:59:52.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:55.070 --> 06:59:55.080 align:start position:0%
hi my name is Lauren McGinley I am the
 
06:59:56.570 --> 06:59:56.580 align:start position:0%
executive director of the New Hampshire
 
06:59:59.270 --> 06:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
harm reduction coalition
 
07:00:00.830 --> 07:00:00.840 align:start position:0%
um you might have heard me speak last
 
07:00:02.510 --> 07:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
week on the previous bill regarding
 
07:00:04.310 --> 07:00:04.320 align:start position:0%
fentanyl chest strips and while that is
 
07:00:06.948 --> 07:00:06.958 align:start position:0%
an excellent Bill specific to
 
07:00:09.230 --> 07:00:09.240 align:start position:0%
self-testing drugs for the presence of
 
07:00:11.810 --> 07:00:11.820 align:start position:0%
fentanyl or other contaminants the bill
 
07:00:13.368 --> 07:00:13.378 align:start position:0%
that you're looking at now is slightly
 
07:00:15.650 --> 07:00:15.660 align:start position:0%
different because it is a much more
 
07:00:18.110 --> 07:00:18.120 align:start position:0%
comprehensive approach to
 
07:00:21.230 --> 07:00:21.240 align:start position:0%
our state's ability to identify not just
 
07:00:23.810 --> 07:00:23.820 align:start position:0%
fentanyl but contaminants that are
 
07:00:25.610 --> 07:00:25.620 align:start position:0%
showing up in drugs right now that can
 
07:00:28.070 --> 07:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
cause I believe more harm than what
 
07:00:29.628 --> 07:00:29.638 align:start position:0%
fentanyl has caused us in the past
 
07:00:29.638 --> 07:00:30.830 align:start position:0%
fentanyl has caused us in the past
decade

07:00:30.830 --> 07:00:30.840 align:start position:0%
decade
 
07:00:34.128 --> 07:00:34.138 align:start position:0%
the the scary thing with our drug Supply
 
07:00:36.770 --> 07:00:36.780 align:start position:0%
right now in our state is that we don't
 
07:00:39.890 --> 07:00:39.900 align:start position:0%
know what we should be most scared of we
 
07:00:42.890 --> 07:00:42.900 align:start position:0%
have some ability to identify because
 
07:00:44.810 --> 07:00:44.820 align:start position:0%
our neighboring states have been doing
 
07:00:46.910 --> 07:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
Supply testing like this
 
07:00:49.128 --> 07:00:49.138 align:start position:0%
for a considerable amount of time at
 
07:00:51.530 --> 07:00:51.540 align:start position:0%
least 10 years in Massachusetts
 
07:00:53.810 --> 07:00:53.820 align:start position:0%
as we work closely with Massachusetts
 
07:00:56.570 --> 07:00:56.580 align:start position:0%
and the team at Brandeis University who
 
07:00:59.330 --> 07:00:59.340 align:start position:0%
leads the testing in that state we find
 
07:01:01.430 --> 07:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
ourselves at a loss for being for being
 
07:01:03.650 --> 07:01:03.660 align:start position:0%
able to be at the same level they are
 
07:01:07.128 --> 07:01:07.138 align:start position:0%
for identifying drug contaminants
 
07:01:07.138 --> 07:01:08.330 align:start position:0%
for identifying drug contaminants
um so

07:01:08.330 --> 07:01:08.340 align:start position:0%
um so
 
07:01:12.830 --> 07:01:12.840 align:start position:0%
this bill is going to provide a safe
 
07:01:15.230 --> 07:01:15.240 align:start position:0%
state for us to be able to start to
 
07:01:15.240 --> 07:01:17.690 align:start position:0%
state for us to be able to start to
explore

07:01:17.690 --> 07:01:17.700 align:start position:0%
explore
 
07:01:21.650 --> 07:01:21.660 align:start position:0%
detailed drug testing capabilities
 
07:01:24.468 --> 07:01:24.478 align:start position:0%
driven by participants of people that
 
07:01:26.930 --> 07:01:26.940 align:start position:0%
utilize harm reduction programs
 
07:01:28.788 --> 07:01:28.798 align:start position:0%
so people that attend harm reduction
 
07:01:30.770 --> 07:01:30.780 align:start position:0%
programs would be able to bring a small
 
07:01:32.990 --> 07:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
sample of the supply that they wish
 
07:01:36.230 --> 07:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
tested and we would be able to test it
 
07:01:39.590 --> 07:01:39.600 align:start position:0%
and not say yes or no there's fentanyl
 
07:01:42.590 --> 07:01:42.600 align:start position:0%
but say there is this much fentanyl
 
07:01:43.850 --> 07:01:43.860 align:start position:0%
there is this much additional
 
07:01:45.890 --> 07:01:45.900 align:start position:0%
contaminant there's this much thylazine
 
07:01:47.810 --> 07:01:47.820 align:start position:0%
there is this much you need to be
 
07:01:49.430 --> 07:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
cautious of these things and we'll be
 
07:01:51.830 --> 07:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
able to see growing Trends in our state
 
07:01:54.110 --> 07:01:54.120 align:start position:0%
of what drugs are coming in how they're
 
07:01:55.850 --> 07:01:55.860 align:start position:0%
getting in and what we need to do about
 
07:01:57.708 --> 07:01:57.718 align:start position:0%
it to keep people safe from Fatal
 
07:01:57.718 --> 07:01:59.208 align:start position:0%
it to keep people safe from Fatal
overdoses

07:01:59.208 --> 07:01:59.218 align:start position:0%
overdoses
 
07:02:05.868 --> 07:02:05.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:08.570 --> 07:02:08.580 align:start position:0%
representative Newell
 
07:02:10.730 --> 07:02:10.740 align:start position:0%
uh I was wondering well first of all
 
07:02:12.468 --> 07:02:12.478 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
07:02:13.968 --> 07:02:13.978 align:start position:0%
I was wondering if you could talk a
 
07:02:15.350 --> 07:02:15.360 align:start position:0%
little bit about
 
07:02:17.448 --> 07:02:17.458 align:start position:0%
um did you say it's called dialazine
 
07:02:18.890 --> 07:02:18.900 align:start position:0%
I've only read it I haven't pronounced
 
07:02:21.708 --> 07:02:21.718 align:start position:0%
it yes okay um I think you know most of
 
07:02:23.270 --> 07:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
us are familiar with fentanyl I think
 
07:02:24.708 --> 07:02:24.718 align:start position:0%
probably all of us are very familiar
 
07:02:26.270 --> 07:02:26.280 align:start position:0%
with fentanyl and the consequences of
 
07:02:28.368 --> 07:02:28.378 align:start position:0%
that xylazine is a new one and I think
 
07:02:31.610 --> 07:02:31.620 align:start position:0%
that kind of uh you know gives us an
 
07:02:33.770 --> 07:02:33.780 align:start position:0%
opportunity to to understand what's
 
07:02:36.590 --> 07:02:36.600 align:start position:0%
coming at us in uh different ways so if
 
07:02:37.430 --> 07:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
you could talk a little bit about
 
07:02:39.770 --> 07:02:39.780 align:start position:0%
xylazine and the effects of that the
 
07:02:42.170 --> 07:02:42.180 align:start position:0%
impact of that and and uh
 
07:02:43.850 --> 07:02:43.860 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to thank you for the
 
07:02:43.860 --> 07:02:45.288 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to thank you for the
question

07:02:45.288 --> 07:02:45.298 align:start position:0%
question
 
07:02:47.628 --> 07:02:47.638 align:start position:0%
um xylazine is a contaminant that we
 
07:02:49.968 --> 07:02:49.978 align:start position:0%
know is in our drug Supply because we're
 
07:02:51.890 --> 07:02:51.900 align:start position:0%
seeing evidence in it in the way people
 
07:02:54.288 --> 07:02:54.298 align:start position:0%
are experiencing overdoses and the
 
07:02:57.048 --> 07:02:57.058 align:start position:0%
wounds that they're experiencing after
 
07:02:59.448 --> 07:02:59.458 align:start position:0%
utilizing a supply with xylazine in it
 
07:03:01.690 --> 07:03:01.700 align:start position:0%
so xylazine is a large animal
 
07:03:03.948 --> 07:03:03.958 align:start position:0%
tranquilizer it is not approved for
 
07:03:06.948 --> 07:03:06.958 align:start position:0%
human consumption and not only is it not
 
07:03:10.128 --> 07:03:10.138 align:start position:0%
reactive to naloxone or Narcan as we
 
07:03:11.930 --> 07:03:11.940 align:start position:0%
sometimes know it
 
07:03:15.048 --> 07:03:15.058 align:start position:0%
um it it is it's going to produce a much
 
07:03:17.830 --> 07:03:17.840 align:start position:0%
heavier overdose effect or
 
07:03:20.690 --> 07:03:20.700 align:start position:0%
respiratory effect it's also going to
 
07:03:23.448 --> 07:03:23.458 align:start position:0%
produce some very serious wounds on the
 
07:03:26.990 --> 07:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
person's body they resemble Burns and
 
07:03:29.030 --> 07:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
that's going to increase the rate of
 
07:03:31.190 --> 07:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
infected wounds in our state and on our
 
07:03:33.468 --> 07:03:33.478 align:start position:0%
Hospital systems
 
07:03:35.448 --> 07:03:35.458 align:start position:0%
you're correct we know a lot about
 
07:03:37.490 --> 07:03:37.500 align:start position:0%
Fentanyl and we do know that fentanyl is
 
07:03:39.830 --> 07:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
in our supply but again what's very
 
07:03:41.930 --> 07:03:41.940 align:start position:0%
concerning is we don't know what's not
 
07:03:43.910 --> 07:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
what's in our supply currently because
 
07:03:46.670 --> 07:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
we don't have programming like this I
 
07:03:48.890 --> 07:03:48.900 align:start position:0%
would have loved to have brought a drug
 
07:03:50.750 --> 07:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
Supply in New Hampshire drug Supply
 
07:03:52.968 --> 07:03:52.978 align:start position:0%
checking professional to come and speak
 
07:03:55.128 --> 07:03:55.138 align:start position:0%
to you about it but we don't have the
 
07:03:57.048 --> 07:03:57.058 align:start position:0%
infrastructure in our state to set up a
 
07:03:58.548 --> 07:03:58.558 align:start position:0%
program to start to look at our drug
 
07:04:01.788 --> 07:04:01.798 align:start position:0%
Supply and what exists within it
 
07:04:04.368 --> 07:04:04.378 align:start position:0%
so we don't really know what to be most
 
07:04:07.010 --> 07:04:07.020 align:start position:0%
scared of right now
 
07:04:09.650 --> 07:04:09.660 align:start position:0%
if I may um you said that there are
 
07:04:11.208 --> 07:04:11.218 align:start position:0%
several things that are popping up is
 
07:04:12.770 --> 07:04:12.780 align:start position:0%
there any other thing that's popping up
 
07:04:14.208 --> 07:04:14.218 align:start position:0%
right now in our drug Supply that you're
 
07:04:18.170 --> 07:04:18.180 align:start position:0%
aware of yes there's um so I know that
 
07:04:21.350 --> 07:04:21.360 align:start position:0%
Dr Nolte is going to submit some data
 
07:04:23.048 --> 07:04:23.058 align:start position:0%
for you from
 
07:04:26.270 --> 07:04:26.280 align:start position:0%
drugsdata.org so I won't give away her
 
07:04:29.350 --> 07:04:29.360 align:start position:0%
surprise but anybody is able to go to
 
07:04:31.730 --> 07:04:31.740 align:start position:0%
drugstata.org you would be able to look
 
07:04:35.030 --> 07:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
at State not just States from all over
 
07:04:37.128 --> 07:04:37.138 align:start position:0%
the U.S but from all over the world that
 
07:04:39.170 --> 07:04:39.180 align:start position:0%
take part in these comprehensive testing
 
07:04:42.288 --> 07:04:42.298 align:start position:0%
programs like we are proposing today New
 
07:04:43.968 --> 07:04:43.978 align:start position:0%
Hampshire will not have data on there
 
07:04:46.368 --> 07:04:46.378 align:start position:0%
there'll be four pieces of data from New
 
07:04:48.350 --> 07:04:48.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and that's it only because
 
07:04:51.948 --> 07:04:51.958 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts was so kind to test four
 
07:04:54.948 --> 07:04:54.958 align:start position:0%
samples of our supply but every other
 
07:04:57.170 --> 07:04:57.180 align:start position:0%
state around us is able to produce these
 
07:04:58.910 --> 07:04:58.920 align:start position:0%
comprehensive detailed reports about
 
07:05:05.390 --> 07:05:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:07.670 --> 07:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler thank you Mr
 
07:05:09.350 --> 07:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
chairman so if we pass this legislation
 
07:05:10.788 --> 07:05:10.798 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire will be able to do a
 
07:05:13.910 --> 07:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
similar drug data set like this yeah so
 
07:05:15.788 --> 07:05:15.798 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire would start to show up on
 
07:05:17.930 --> 07:05:17.940 align:start position:0%
drugstata.org and start to compare
 
07:05:20.690 --> 07:05:20.700 align:start position:0%
internationally with what other entities
 
07:05:22.730 --> 07:05:22.740 align:start position:0%
are able to do to keep their citizens
 
07:05:22.740 --> 07:05:26.570 align:start position:0%
are able to do to keep their citizens
safe

07:05:26.570 --> 07:05:26.580 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:33.830 --> 07:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:40.368 --> 07:05:40.378 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:42.468 --> 07:05:42.478 align:start position:0%
thank you so much um to the committee
 
07:05:44.868 --> 07:05:44.878 align:start position:0%
for the opportunity to speak to you um I
 
07:05:47.150 --> 07:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
think I'm coming at a good spot
 
07:05:50.448 --> 07:05:50.458 align:start position:0%
um of for follow-up I did provide some
 
07:05:52.730 --> 07:05:52.740 align:start position:0%
printed materials that should be
 
07:05:52.740 --> 07:05:54.468 align:start position:0%
printed materials that should be
circulated

07:05:54.468 --> 07:05:54.478 align:start position:0%
circulated
 
07:05:56.990 --> 07:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
um so um and does everyone have that
 
07:05:59.390 --> 07:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
I'll reference that great
 
07:06:01.670 --> 07:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
um so I'm Carrie Nolte I'm a family
 
07:06:03.770 --> 07:06:03.780 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioner in community health
 
07:06:07.390 --> 07:06:07.400 align:start position:0%
and an associate professor of Nursing
 
07:06:11.150 --> 07:06:11.160 align:start position:0%
and my work focuses on reducing drug
 
07:06:13.490 --> 07:06:13.500 align:start position:0%
related harm I've been very involved
 
07:06:15.708 --> 07:06:15.718 align:start position:0%
with the harm reduction Coalition and
 
07:06:19.850 --> 07:06:19.860 align:start position:0%
other and also police agencies around
 
07:06:23.390 --> 07:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
Harvard auction and working through this
 
07:06:25.968 --> 07:06:25.978 align:start position:0%
this is really the next step and I think
 
07:06:27.468 --> 07:06:27.478 align:start position:0%
it's really important that the committee
 
07:06:29.810 --> 07:06:29.820 align:start position:0%
considers moving this forward soon
 
07:06:31.910 --> 07:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
because we don't want to get further
 
07:06:34.368 --> 07:06:34.378 align:start position:0%
behind I think we're all behind our
 
07:06:37.368 --> 07:06:37.378 align:start position:0%
other states in allowing drug checking
 
07:06:41.090 --> 07:06:41.100 align:start position:0%
um and so we know of and I know the
 
07:06:42.708 --> 07:06:42.718 align:start position:0%
committee had shared information around
 
07:06:44.690 --> 07:06:44.700 align:start position:0%
fentanyl test strips and Rapid test
 
07:06:47.270 --> 07:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
strips I think one really key point to
 
07:06:49.610 --> 07:06:49.620 align:start position:0%
understand is although there's lots of
 
07:06:52.390 --> 07:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
talk of Fentanyl and
 
07:06:55.670 --> 07:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
across the state fentanyl is truly
 
07:06:57.830 --> 07:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
become our the drug Supply the illicit
 
07:07:00.590 --> 07:07:00.600 align:start position:0%
drug Supply that we have so
 
07:07:03.110 --> 07:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
um in the last I think it's been five
 
07:07:05.030 --> 07:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
years there have been one or two
 
07:07:07.430 --> 07:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
heroin-related deaths in the state they
 
07:07:09.708 --> 07:07:09.718 align:start position:0%
are all coming up with fentanyl whether
 
07:07:13.968 --> 07:07:13.978 align:start position:0%
they be with other things as well but we
 
07:07:15.590 --> 07:07:15.600 align:start position:0%
go through these cycles of different
 
07:07:18.410 --> 07:07:18.420 align:start position:0%
things changing and although strategies
 
07:07:20.390 --> 07:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
like fentanyl test strips come three
 
07:07:23.150 --> 07:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
years after Fentanyl and can make a dent
 
07:07:25.430 --> 07:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
and help this is a program that's really
 
07:07:28.968 --> 07:07:28.978 align:start position:0%
going to have us be on the Forefront of
 
07:07:31.610 --> 07:07:31.620 align:start position:0%
understanding what's there
 
07:07:33.288 --> 07:07:33.298 align:start position:0%
um so I know you just heard about
 
07:07:35.330 --> 07:07:35.340 align:start position:0%
xylazine I'll try not to be repetitive
 
07:07:37.128 --> 07:07:37.138 align:start position:0%
you heard about some of the effects of
 
07:07:37.138 --> 07:07:38.208 align:start position:0%
you heard about some of the effects of
that

07:07:38.208 --> 07:07:38.218 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:07:41.510 --> 07:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
um in this packet on the um third page
 
07:07:43.670 --> 07:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
I've provided a clinical bulletin that
 
07:07:45.288 --> 07:07:45.298 align:start position:0%
recently just came out
 
07:07:47.150 --> 07:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
um in January from the Department of
 
07:07:50.208 --> 07:07:50.218 align:start position:0%
Safety regarding xylazine and that in
 
07:07:52.610 --> 07:07:52.620 align:start position:0%
overdose deaths cases they're seeing
 
07:07:57.110 --> 07:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
positive results for xylazine on the
 
07:07:58.968 --> 07:07:58.978 align:start position:0%
following page and I think this gets to
 
07:08:00.830 --> 07:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
what Lauren was talking about and the
 
07:08:00.840 --> 07:08:02.330 align:start position:0%
what Lauren was talking about and the
questions

07:08:02.330 --> 07:08:02.340 align:start position:0%
questions
 
07:08:05.090 --> 07:08:05.100 align:start position:0%
um this is a printout from drugstata a
 
07:08:08.270 --> 07:08:08.280 align:start position:0%
publicly available data set and I'm not
 
07:08:09.948 --> 07:08:09.958 align:start position:0%
going to go through all 10 pages but I
 
07:08:12.590 --> 07:08:12.600 align:start position:0%
think just seeing the bulk of it and how
 
07:08:14.868 --> 07:08:14.878 align:start position:0%
many samples have xylazine in it from
 
07:08:16.788 --> 07:08:16.798 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts in the last three months
 
07:08:20.330 --> 07:08:20.340 align:start position:0%
is compelling in itself but I did want
 
07:08:21.948 --> 07:08:21.958 align:start position:0%
to point out as we've talked about two
 
07:08:25.310 --> 07:08:25.320 align:start position:0%
primary substances Fentanyl and xylazine
 
07:08:28.070 --> 07:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
in these conversations what really is in
 
07:08:30.170 --> 07:08:30.180 align:start position:0%
some of these samples so if you take
 
07:08:32.990 --> 07:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
just the first five samples there you
 
07:08:35.270 --> 07:08:35.280 align:start position:0%
also see that there's procaine which is
 
07:08:37.250 --> 07:08:37.260 align:start position:0%
used in dental procedures for numbing
 
07:08:40.368 --> 07:08:40.378 align:start position:0%
you see there's caffeine you'll see that
 
07:08:42.650 --> 07:08:42.660 align:start position:0%
there's also
 
07:08:42.660 --> 07:08:43.270 align:start position:0%
there's also
um

07:08:43.270 --> 07:08:43.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:08:46.730 --> 07:08:46.740 align:start position:0%
quentapine which is Seroquel it's used
 
07:08:50.750 --> 07:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
for Sleep psychosis bipolar disorder all
 
07:08:53.090 --> 07:08:53.100 align:start position:0%
sorts of things you'll also see quinine
 
07:08:55.250 --> 07:08:55.260 align:start position:0%
which you may recall is a malarial drug
 
07:08:57.948 --> 07:08:57.958 align:start position:0%
so the the sedative effects of
 
07:09:00.770 --> 07:09:00.780 align:start position:0%
medications are being combined and cut
 
07:09:03.410 --> 07:09:03.420 align:start position:0%
and all of that so although now we know
 
07:09:04.910 --> 07:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we have Fentanyl and
 
07:09:06.890 --> 07:09:06.900 align:start position:0%
xylazine we don't know about all these
 
07:09:09.230 --> 07:09:09.240 align:start position:0%
other substances and we don't have the
 
07:09:12.288 --> 07:09:12.298 align:start position:0%
opportunity if new harmful things even
 
07:09:15.170 --> 07:09:15.180 align:start position:0%
more harmful things are coming into play
 
07:09:17.390 --> 07:09:17.400 align:start position:0%
um what that will be unless we allow
 
07:09:20.448 --> 07:09:20.458 align:start position:0%
comprehensive drug checking
 
07:09:22.250 --> 07:09:22.260 align:start position:0%
um I will I'm happy to take any
 
07:09:24.110 --> 07:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
questions but I think you've heard a lot
 
07:09:25.730 --> 07:09:25.740 align:start position:0%
from everyone and they don't want to be
 
07:09:25.740 --> 07:09:30.410 align:start position:0%
from everyone and they don't want to be
duplicative

07:09:30.410 --> 07:09:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:34.310 --> 07:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:36.288 --> 07:09:36.298 align:start position:0%
yeah just to have a quick question I
 
07:09:38.090 --> 07:09:38.100 align:start position:0%
mean I see here that it says the drug
 
07:09:40.128 --> 07:09:40.138 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia should not be included in
 
07:09:42.170 --> 07:09:42.180 align:start position:0%
drug checking equipment and I don't see
 
07:09:46.490 --> 07:09:46.500 align:start position:0%
any other added language to this bill
 
07:09:48.708 --> 07:09:48.718 align:start position:0%
so I'm a little bit confused about I
 
07:09:52.128 --> 07:09:52.138 align:start position:0%
mean this just makes it not
 
07:09:56.030 --> 07:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
it's um it's not illegal but then there
 
07:09:58.968 --> 07:09:58.978 align:start position:0%
was some conversation about the data
 
07:10:00.468 --> 07:10:00.478 align:start position:0%
would be better and the state could
 
07:10:02.330 --> 07:10:02.340 align:start position:0%
start checking and whatever and I don't
 
07:10:05.330 --> 07:10:05.340 align:start position:0%
see anything like that in the bill how
 
07:10:07.490 --> 07:10:07.500 align:start position:0%
how is this bill connected to getting
 
07:10:10.490 --> 07:10:10.500 align:start position:0%
better and more checking in in the state
 
07:10:12.890 --> 07:10:12.900 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire so my apologies my
 
07:10:14.690 --> 07:10:14.700 align:start position:0%
hearing I'm still recovering from an ear
 
07:10:16.430 --> 07:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
infection and I'll I think I heard your
 
07:10:18.230 --> 07:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
question but please correct me if I'm if
 
07:10:19.610 --> 07:10:19.620 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong
 
07:10:21.350 --> 07:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
um So currently
 
07:10:24.530 --> 07:10:24.540 align:start position:0%
um my understanding of the paraphernalia
 
07:10:26.750 --> 07:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
laws are that it explicitly does not
 
07:10:30.110 --> 07:10:30.120 align:start position:0%
allow transporting sampling analyzing
 
07:10:33.770 --> 07:10:33.780 align:start position:0%
testing and so this bill is aimed at the
 
07:10:36.468 --> 07:10:36.478 align:start position:0%
testers you know my self-interested in
 
07:10:38.448 --> 07:10:38.458 align:start position:0%
helping to develop a drug checking
 
07:10:41.628 --> 07:10:41.638 align:start position:0%
program if I'm transporting samples to
 
07:10:43.570 --> 07:10:43.580 align:start position:0%
send to confirmatory testing to
 
07:10:46.548 --> 07:10:46.558 align:start position:0%
drugstata.org that I'm not arrested for
 
07:10:49.730 --> 07:10:49.740 align:start position:0%
possession or for paraphernalia for
 
07:10:52.310 --> 07:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
having baggies and things like that
 
07:10:54.890 --> 07:10:54.900 align:start position:0%
does that get at your question or please
 
07:10:57.650 --> 07:10:57.660 align:start position:0%
follow up clarify
 
07:10:59.868 --> 07:10:59.878 align:start position:0%
um yeah it really does so it would be
 
07:11:02.270 --> 07:11:02.280 align:start position:0%
private people or private organizations
 
07:11:05.510 --> 07:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
that would not be held criminally now
 
07:11:06.890 --> 07:11:06.900 align:start position:0%
for doing the things that you just
 
07:11:08.930 --> 07:11:08.940 align:start position:0%
mentioned and
 
07:11:11.270 --> 07:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
I I was under the misimpression that it
 
07:11:13.850 --> 07:11:13.860 align:start position:0%
was that the state would be doing this
 
07:11:15.890 --> 07:11:15.900 align:start position:0%
so well thank you very much yeah so my
 
07:11:17.930 --> 07:11:17.940 align:start position:0%
current understanding of state and
 
07:11:20.390 --> 07:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
testing is that they only test samples
 
07:11:23.390 --> 07:11:23.400 align:start position:0%
if they're going to be utilized in court
 
07:11:25.368 --> 07:11:25.378 align:start position:0%
cases so for if it's a baggie for
 
07:11:27.650 --> 07:11:27.660 align:start position:0%
possession they the state has to do an
 
07:11:30.110 --> 07:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
analysis on that that data is not able
 
07:11:32.270 --> 07:11:32.280 align:start position:0%
to come back in real time just
 
07:11:34.310 --> 07:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
anecdotally I've heard that the weights
 
07:11:37.128 --> 07:11:37.138 align:start position:0%
on that are three to six months and so
 
07:11:38.628 --> 07:11:38.638 align:start position:0%
the point of this is this is rapid
 
07:11:40.968 --> 07:11:40.978 align:start position:0%
informing strategies informing
 
07:11:43.070 --> 07:11:43.080 align:start position:0%
information in therefore reducing
 
07:11:46.128 --> 07:11:46.138 align:start position:0%
overdose overdoses because of that we
 
07:11:48.170 --> 07:11:48.180 align:start position:0%
will still need to build a program this
 
07:11:50.690 --> 07:11:50.700 align:start position:0%
doesn't have this is all based on you
 
07:11:52.910 --> 07:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
know most likely Federal funding and
 
07:11:55.968 --> 07:11:55.978 align:start position:0%
federal grants but right now that it
 
07:11:57.948 --> 07:11:57.958 align:start position:0%
those are available to support this and
 
07:11:59.690 --> 07:11:59.700 align:start position:0%
the team you've seen in support of this
 
07:12:01.430 --> 07:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
would probably be the team to be
 
07:12:04.010 --> 07:12:04.020 align:start position:0%
applying and building that
 
07:12:08.208 --> 07:12:08.218 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:10.850 --> 07:12:10.860 align:start position:0%
representative Newell
 
07:12:13.250 --> 07:12:13.260 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
07:12:15.650 --> 07:12:15.660 align:start position:0%
um I was just curious about
 
07:12:16.610 --> 07:12:16.620 align:start position:0%
um you know especially because you're
 
07:12:18.948 --> 07:12:18.958 align:start position:0%
associated with the University of New
 
07:12:21.350 --> 07:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is this uh are these skills
 
07:12:22.910 --> 07:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
being taught
 
07:12:25.190 --> 07:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
um to the next generation of of nurses
 
07:12:27.410 --> 07:12:27.420 align:start position:0%
and things like that as or is it
 
07:12:28.968 --> 07:12:28.978 align:start position:0%
something that would be allowed by this
 
07:12:30.468 --> 07:12:30.478 align:start position:0%
bill I'm just curious how that kind of
 
07:12:32.270 --> 07:12:32.280 align:start position:0%
works out
 
07:12:34.490 --> 07:12:34.500 align:start position:0%
I mean I just clarify would something
 
07:12:38.270 --> 07:12:38.280 align:start position:0%
like drug checking be taught
 
07:12:40.430 --> 07:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
be involved students health profession
 
07:12:44.510 --> 07:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
students yeah I guess I guess uh maybe
 
07:12:46.070 --> 07:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
maybe that was a silly question it's
 
07:12:48.530 --> 07:12:48.540 align:start position:0%
maybe obviously if testing is the same
 
07:12:49.968 --> 07:12:49.978 align:start position:0%
across the board Is this different than
 
07:12:51.708 --> 07:12:51.718 align:start position:0%
testing anything else
 
07:12:53.810 --> 07:12:53.820 align:start position:0%
I'm so sorry my hearing about if someone
 
07:12:55.730 --> 07:12:55.740 align:start position:0%
can repeat the question
 
07:12:59.930 --> 07:12:59.940 align:start position:0%
is Is this different than testing uh in
 
07:13:01.548 --> 07:13:01.558 align:start position:0%
other situations where this would need
 
07:13:04.128 --> 07:13:04.138 align:start position:0%
to be specifically taught to nursing
 
07:13:04.138 --> 07:13:05.810 align:start position:0%
to be specifically taught to nursing
students

07:13:05.810 --> 07:13:05.820 align:start position:0%
students
 
07:13:08.990 --> 07:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
um I think I mean my ideal would be that
 
07:13:10.490 --> 07:13:10.500 align:start position:0%
students would be involved and this is
 
07:13:13.368 --> 07:13:13.378 align:start position:0%
an amazing opportunity and it pairs very
 
07:13:15.350 --> 07:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
well with an increased involvement we
 
07:13:17.448 --> 07:13:17.458 align:start position:0%
have of our students in recovery
 
07:13:19.670 --> 07:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
Community organizations and other
 
07:13:19.680 --> 07:13:21.650 align:start position:0%
Community organizations and other
strategies

07:13:21.650 --> 07:13:21.660 align:start position:0%
strategies
 
07:13:23.750 --> 07:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
um the training in order to become
 
07:13:26.448 --> 07:13:26.458 align:start position:0%
competent on rapid drug checking
 
07:13:28.610 --> 07:13:28.620 align:start position:0%
um you know is challenging but
 
07:13:30.890 --> 07:13:30.900 align:start position:0%
definitely something that those students
 
07:13:32.570 --> 07:13:32.580 align:start position:0%
who wanted to learn that or make that
 
07:13:34.510 --> 07:13:34.520 align:start position:0%
part of their practice could absolutely
 
07:13:37.788 --> 07:13:37.798 align:start position:0%
join in doing and I must repeat and I do
 
07:13:39.410 --> 07:13:39.420 align:start position:0%
have it in my written testimony that My
 
07:13:41.208 --> 07:13:41.218 align:start position:0%
Views represent my expertise and
 
07:13:42.530 --> 07:13:42.540 align:start position:0%
knowledge in this and not necessarily
 
07:13:44.810 --> 07:13:44.820 align:start position:0%
the University of New Hampshire but
 
07:13:49.310 --> 07:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:54.110 --> 07:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:56.690 --> 07:13:56.700 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes Captain Bill bright
 
07:14:04.788 --> 07:14:04.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:06.830 --> 07:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
good afternoon yeah thank you for
 
07:14:08.990 --> 07:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
hearing my testimony on what has been a
 
07:14:10.788 --> 07:14:10.798 align:start position:0%
very long day I'll try and keep it brief
 
07:14:12.590 --> 07:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
for all of you
 
07:14:14.690 --> 07:14:14.700 align:start position:0%
um my name is Bill Wright with the New
 
07:14:16.090 --> 07:14:16.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Police
 
07:14:19.788 --> 07:14:19.798 align:start position:0%
I previously testified in the uh the
 
07:14:22.010 --> 07:14:22.020 align:start position:0%
other drug paraphernalia bill I believe
 
07:14:25.670 --> 07:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
it was last week that bill was uh narrow
 
07:14:28.490 --> 07:14:28.500 align:start position:0%
it was very narrow and it included
 
07:14:31.368 --> 07:14:31.378 align:start position:0%
removing the words testing and analyzing
 
07:14:33.468 --> 07:14:33.478 align:start position:0%
um I testified that I didn't see any
 
07:14:36.410 --> 07:14:36.420 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences at the time
 
07:14:37.910 --> 07:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
um the one thing that I would like to
 
07:14:39.650 --> 07:14:39.660 align:start position:0%
present is information to all of you as
 
07:14:41.150 --> 07:14:41.160 align:start position:0%
you're considering both of these bills
 
07:14:44.150 --> 07:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
is that the testing and analyzing of
 
07:14:46.570 --> 07:14:46.580 align:start position:0%
these drugs using uh you know whatever
 
07:14:49.070 --> 07:14:49.080 align:start position:0%
kits are available or whatever could be
 
07:14:52.490 --> 07:14:52.500 align:start position:0%
used by somebody who is uh trafficking
 
07:14:54.948 --> 07:14:54.958 align:start position:0%
narcotics they could use they could use
 
07:14:57.650 --> 07:14:57.660 align:start position:0%
these things to determine you know what
 
07:14:59.510 --> 07:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
they're getting for products uh what the
 
07:15:01.730 --> 07:15:01.740 align:start position:0%
potency is and things like that so I
 
07:15:03.410 --> 07:15:03.420 align:start position:0%
just throw that out there as information
 
07:15:05.810 --> 07:15:05.820 align:start position:0%
to all of you that it is a possibility
 
07:15:07.490 --> 07:15:07.500 align:start position:0%
that it could be used for nefarious
 
07:15:09.708 --> 07:15:09.718 align:start position:0%
purposes as well
 
07:15:11.708 --> 07:15:11.718 align:start position:0%
um as far as the harm reduction
 
07:15:14.650 --> 07:15:14.660 align:start position:0%
standpoint goes the state police myself
 
07:15:17.750 --> 07:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
we are very sympathetic to that mission
 
07:15:20.570 --> 07:15:20.580 align:start position:0%
and I and I understand the intent of
 
07:15:22.968 --> 07:15:22.978 align:start position:0%
this bill and the other Bill to allow
 
07:15:22.978 --> 07:15:24.048 align:start position:0%
this bill and the other Bill to allow
for

07:15:24.048 --> 07:15:24.058 align:start position:0%
for
 
07:15:25.490 --> 07:15:25.500 align:start position:0%
um people who are going to use a
 
07:15:27.830 --> 07:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
substance anyways to determine the
 
07:15:30.230 --> 07:15:30.240 align:start position:0%
potential safety or potential harms we
 
07:15:31.788 --> 07:15:31.798 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
07:15:33.110 --> 07:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
um and
 
07:15:35.390 --> 07:15:35.400 align:start position:0%
but I do have some concerns about this
 
07:15:37.250 --> 07:15:37.260 align:start position:0%
bill specifically
 
07:15:39.708 --> 07:15:39.718 align:start position:0%
um without it being narrowly
 
07:15:39.718 --> 07:15:40.610 align:start position:0%
um without it being narrowly
um

07:15:40.610 --> 07:15:40.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:15:43.250 --> 07:15:43.260 align:start position:0%
yeah without the narrowness of the other
 
07:15:45.468 --> 07:15:45.478 align:start position:0%
bill I'll draw your attention to page
 
07:15:49.368 --> 07:15:49.378 align:start position:0%
two uh line uh 18 and 19. the the
 
07:15:52.368 --> 07:15:52.378 align:start position:0%
language that's being taken out of uh
 
07:15:54.650 --> 07:15:54.660 align:start position:0%
the drug paraphernalia definition is for
 
07:15:57.708 --> 07:15:57.718 align:start position:0%
processing preparing testing analyzing
 
07:15:59.930 --> 07:15:59.940 align:start position:0%
packaging repackaging storing and
 
07:16:02.628 --> 07:16:02.638 align:start position:0%
containing so I can foresee some
 
07:16:05.270 --> 07:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
scenarios where uh
 
07:16:07.270 --> 07:16:07.280 align:start position:0%
especially packaging equipment
 
07:16:09.708 --> 07:16:09.718 align:start position:0%
repackaging storing storing equipment
 
07:16:12.230 --> 07:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
containing equipment where if those
 
07:16:13.730 --> 07:16:13.740 align:start position:0%
thing items are removed from this
 
07:16:15.350 --> 07:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
definition we may limit some
 
07:16:17.030 --> 07:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
investigators who are trying to do their
 
07:16:19.910 --> 07:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
job in building probable cause for drug
 
07:16:23.510 --> 07:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
investigations going forward so that
 
07:16:26.570 --> 07:16:26.580 align:start position:0%
including that language I I believe will
 
07:16:29.270 --> 07:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
limit investigators from from
 
07:16:31.128 --> 07:16:31.138 align:start position:0%
outside of the scope of the intent of
 
07:16:34.250 --> 07:16:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:36.288 --> 07:16:36.298 align:start position:0%
um I also think that the bill
 
07:16:40.810 --> 07:16:40.820 align:start position:0%
contradicts itself as in page three
 
07:16:44.990 --> 07:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
lines 34 and 35. the definition for drug
 
07:16:46.670 --> 07:16:46.680 align:start position:0%
checking equipment
 
07:16:48.410 --> 07:16:48.420 align:start position:0%
and says drug checking equipment does
 
07:16:50.150 --> 07:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
not include
 
07:16:52.548 --> 07:16:52.558 align:start position:0%
the substance is being analyzed
 
07:16:56.090 --> 07:16:56.100 align:start position:0%
or drug packaging or drug supplies where
 
07:16:58.910 --> 07:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
if we're striking out the the wording
 
07:17:01.250 --> 07:17:01.260 align:start position:0%
for packaging and supplies in the
 
07:17:03.410 --> 07:17:03.420 align:start position:0%
previous part of the bill
 
07:17:05.990 --> 07:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
now we're saying that the definition
 
07:17:08.930 --> 07:17:08.940 align:start position:0%
does not include drug packaging and Drug
 
07:17:10.310 --> 07:17:10.320 align:start position:0%
supplies so I think if there is a
 
07:17:13.250 --> 07:17:13.260 align:start position:0%
contradiction there and again
 
07:17:14.690 --> 07:17:14.700 align:start position:0%
you know from a law enforcement
 
07:17:17.208 --> 07:17:17.218 align:start position:0%
standpoint any packaging equipment any
 
07:17:19.250 --> 07:17:19.260 align:start position:0%
supplies that have to do with
 
07:17:21.230 --> 07:17:21.240 align:start position:0%
um you know narcotics or drugs in
 
07:17:22.788 --> 07:17:22.798 align:start position:0%
general that would be important to our
 
07:17:28.788 --> 07:17:28.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:31.670 --> 07:17:31.680 align:start position:0%
and I and I also do Wonder as well about
 
07:17:34.250 --> 07:17:34.260 align:start position:0%
uh the line where it says drug checking
 
07:17:35.510 --> 07:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
equipment does not include the
 
07:17:37.730 --> 07:17:37.740 align:start position:0%
substances being analyzed
 
07:17:39.948 --> 07:17:39.958 align:start position:0%
if if it doesn't include the substances
 
07:17:43.190 --> 07:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
being analyzed then the the
 
07:17:44.990 --> 07:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
um as the previous speaker was talking
 
07:17:47.208 --> 07:17:47.218 align:start position:0%
about there may be some issues there
 
07:17:51.110 --> 07:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
with the ability to to test uh drugs
 
07:17:53.208 --> 07:17:53.218 align:start position:0%
that people bring to them I also would
 
07:17:55.750 --> 07:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
offer that I believe that our state
 
07:17:58.730 --> 07:17:58.740 align:start position:0%
forensic lab could offer some statistics
 
07:17:58.740 --> 07:18:00.110 align:start position:0%
forensic lab could offer some statistics
to

07:18:00.110 --> 07:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:18:02.270 --> 07:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
um you know what is included in these in
 
07:18:04.030 --> 07:18:04.040 align:start position:0%
these drugs already
 
07:18:06.650 --> 07:18:06.660 align:start position:0%
and there is intelligence out there as
 
07:18:10.430 --> 07:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
far as the trends uh of the substances
 
07:18:12.708 --> 07:18:12.718 align:start position:0%
that are included in the drugs that end
 
07:18:16.190 --> 07:18:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:18.590 --> 07:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
are those is that information
 
07:18:21.170 --> 07:18:21.180 align:start position:0%
um publicly available so some of it is
 
07:18:23.150 --> 07:18:23.160 align:start position:0%
law enforcement sensitive
 
07:18:24.770 --> 07:18:24.780 align:start position:0%
um so I can't offer up you know
 
07:18:27.590 --> 07:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
everything that that goes out but those
 
07:18:29.030 --> 07:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
Trends are
 
07:18:30.830 --> 07:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
um available I'm sure some of them are
 
07:18:32.570 --> 07:18:32.580 align:start position:0%
available to the public most of what I
 
07:18:35.510 --> 07:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
see may be law enforcement sensitive
 
07:18:38.510 --> 07:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
would you see a problem if if
 
07:18:40.610 --> 07:18:40.620 align:start position:0%
if these
 
07:18:42.590 --> 07:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
agencies that are involved in harm
 
07:18:45.650 --> 07:18:45.660 align:start position:0%
reduction were licensed to do that and
 
07:18:47.570 --> 07:18:47.580 align:start position:0%
and in other words if all this stuff
 
07:18:49.070 --> 07:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
wasn't made available to the general
 
07:18:51.170 --> 07:18:51.180 align:start position:0%
public but specifically the agencies
 
07:18:54.310 --> 07:18:54.320 align:start position:0%
that were involved in harm reduction
 
07:18:59.150 --> 07:18:59.160 align:start position:0%
with the would that present so I think
 
07:19:01.788 --> 07:19:01.798 align:start position:0%
I would just offer that it may be uh it
 
07:19:05.150 --> 07:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
may be difficult to set up a a situation
 
07:19:07.850 --> 07:19:07.860 align:start position:0%
where somebody can bring an illegal
 
07:19:09.948 --> 07:19:09.958 align:start position:0%
product to
 
07:19:11.330 --> 07:19:11.340 align:start position:0%
um to one of these facilities to get
 
07:19:14.090 --> 07:19:14.100 align:start position:0%
tested that I I mean I can see that as a
 
07:19:16.730 --> 07:19:16.740 align:start position:0%
difficult situation the the locations
 
07:19:19.430 --> 07:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
that you know the the people uh coming
 
07:19:21.410 --> 07:19:21.420 align:start position:0%
and things like that I just would see
 
07:19:22.910 --> 07:19:22.920 align:start position:0%
that as a difficult
 
07:19:26.510 --> 07:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
um a difficult situation I do think that
 
07:19:29.270 --> 07:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
in the in the harm reduction Mission if
 
07:19:31.548 --> 07:19:31.558 align:start position:0%
things if this was narrowed to to a
 
07:19:35.270 --> 07:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
sense that hey we know that fentanyl
 
07:19:37.610 --> 07:19:37.620 align:start position:0%
um is killing people
 
07:19:38.990 --> 07:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
um Fentanyl
 
07:19:41.510 --> 07:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
specifically put the language to include
 
07:19:44.810 --> 07:19:44.820 align:start position:0%
fentanyl testing strips or whatever
 
07:19:46.610 --> 07:19:46.620 align:start position:0%
um the substances are that we identify
 
07:19:48.890 --> 07:19:48.900 align:start position:0%
as the most harmful rather than just
 
07:19:51.530 --> 07:19:51.540 align:start position:0%
opening up it up to any testing or any
 
07:19:53.810 --> 07:19:53.820 align:start position:0%
analyzing so that would be something
 
07:19:55.788 --> 07:19:55.798 align:start position:0%
that we would take a look at if it was
 
07:19:59.090 --> 07:19:59.100 align:start position:0%
if it was narrow and was specific to
 
07:20:02.030 --> 07:20:02.040 align:start position:0%
maybe not even the
 
07:20:06.708 --> 07:20:06.718 align:start position:0%
um the potency but to the presence of a
 
07:20:09.650 --> 07:20:09.660 align:start position:0%
certain narcotic or substance
 
07:20:12.890 --> 07:20:12.900 align:start position:0%
are you able to to address the um the
 
07:20:14.990 --> 07:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
drug or the substance that that was
 
07:20:16.670 --> 07:20:16.680 align:start position:0%
testified to that's popping up that's
 
07:20:19.690 --> 07:20:19.700 align:start position:0%
causing these sores this horse
 
07:20:22.548 --> 07:20:22.558 align:start position:0%
so I I have limited information about it
 
07:20:24.410 --> 07:20:24.420 align:start position:0%
similar to uh what was already testified
 
07:20:27.048 --> 07:20:27.058 align:start position:0%
to so I just know that it is uh present
 
07:20:29.628 --> 07:20:29.638 align:start position:0%
it has made its way to New Hampshire
 
07:20:32.030 --> 07:20:32.040 align:start position:0%
um it has been prevalent in uh Southern
 
07:20:34.968 --> 07:20:34.978 align:start position:0%
States for quite a while and yes it is
 
07:20:38.150 --> 07:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh some type of causing some sores or
 
07:20:41.570 --> 07:20:41.580 align:start position:0%
flesh eating issues in in the people
 
07:20:43.788 --> 07:20:43.798 align:start position:0%
that are coming across it
 
07:20:46.368 --> 07:20:46.378 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:20:49.250 --> 07:20:49.260 align:start position:0%
representative Newell
 
07:20:51.410 --> 07:20:51.420 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I'm
 
07:20:51.420 --> 07:20:52.670 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I'm
curious

07:20:52.670 --> 07:20:52.680 align:start position:0%
curious
 
07:20:53.868 --> 07:20:53.878 align:start position:0%
you know in the beginning you had said
 
07:20:57.288 --> 07:20:57.298 align:start position:0%
that I you were concerned about you know
 
07:20:58.850 --> 07:20:58.860 align:start position:0%
these same testing and analyzing
 
07:21:01.490 --> 07:21:01.500 align:start position:0%
equipment could be used for you know a
 
07:21:03.288 --> 07:21:03.298 align:start position:0%
um cartels or things like that is that
 
07:21:05.570 --> 07:21:05.580 align:start position:0%
something that you've come across
 
07:21:09.530 --> 07:21:09.540 align:start position:0%
um and I and if so how common is that
 
07:21:12.890 --> 07:21:12.900 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean it's I think that it
 
07:21:14.868 --> 07:21:14.878 align:start position:0%
if you open it up you take a tool away
 
07:21:16.610 --> 07:21:16.620 align:start position:0%
from from law enforcement in those
 
07:21:19.610 --> 07:21:19.620 align:start position:0%
situations you're also you know as as
 
07:21:22.010 --> 07:21:22.020 align:start position:0%
the testing equipment gets more advanced
 
07:21:24.230 --> 07:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
um I mean it's just a tool that a that a
 
07:21:25.910 --> 07:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
drug trafficker could use I just want to
 
07:21:28.310 --> 07:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
offer that as information
 
07:21:31.730 --> 07:21:31.740 align:start position:0%
um I haven't seen it um recently but I
 
07:21:33.590 --> 07:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
just offer that up as as information as
 
07:21:36.770 --> 07:21:36.780 align:start position:0%
a potential uh issue can I ask a
 
07:21:36.780 --> 07:21:38.270 align:start position:0%
a potential uh issue can I ask a
follow-up

07:21:38.270 --> 07:21:38.280 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
07:21:40.250 --> 07:21:40.260 align:start position:0%
I just really quick have you ever seen
 
07:21:42.530 --> 07:21:42.540 align:start position:0%
it have they ever seen testing equipment
 
07:21:45.490 --> 07:21:45.500 align:start position:0%
I mean have you ever had the situation
 
07:21:47.390 --> 07:21:47.400 align:start position:0%
uh that you're concerned about and
 
07:21:49.490 --> 07:21:49.500 align:start position:0%
finding cartels having testing and
 
07:21:50.750 --> 07:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
analyzing equipment is that something
 
07:21:52.730 --> 07:21:52.740 align:start position:0%
that you have come across typically
 
07:21:56.448 --> 07:21:56.458 align:start position:0%
typically we are you know we we may have
 
07:21:59.570 --> 07:21:59.580 align:start position:0%
arrested a a trafficker and it's
 
07:22:01.368 --> 07:22:01.378 align:start position:0%
typically they have the the products
 
07:22:04.670 --> 07:22:04.680 align:start position:0%
with them the equipment package
 
07:22:07.310 --> 07:22:07.320 align:start position:0%
um and to distribute and it's usually a
 
07:22:09.590 --> 07:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
large amount in small small packages the
 
07:22:11.390 --> 07:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
testing equipment I have I mean I
 
07:22:13.128 --> 07:22:13.138 align:start position:0%
haven't seen that I'm just offering it
 
07:22:15.948 --> 07:22:15.958 align:start position:0%
up as that is one potential Pitfall of
 
07:22:19.610 --> 07:22:19.620 align:start position:0%
the testing equipment thank you
 
07:22:19.620 --> 07:22:21.230 align:start position:0%
the testing equipment thank you
yeah

07:22:21.230 --> 07:22:21.240 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
07:22:23.270 --> 07:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
is your understanding of the bill I know
 
07:22:24.770 --> 07:22:24.780 align:start position:0%
that one of the things you might look
 
07:22:24.780 --> 07:22:25.610 align:start position:0%
that one of the things you might look
for

07:22:25.610 --> 07:22:25.620 align:start position:0%
for
 
07:22:28.010 --> 07:22:28.020 align:start position:0%
um is an abundance in a vehicle of for
 
07:22:30.410 --> 07:22:30.420 align:start position:0%
example small glassing packages
 
07:22:33.890 --> 07:22:33.900 align:start position:0%
would this allow that now as would that
 
07:22:35.628 --> 07:22:35.638 align:start position:0%
no longer be used towards to build
 
07:22:38.690 --> 07:22:38.700 align:start position:0%
probable cause among other items well I
 
07:22:40.730 --> 07:22:40.740 align:start position:0%
think you know I mean packaging
 
07:22:42.890 --> 07:22:42.900 align:start position:0%
equipment is very broad right um there
 
07:22:44.330 --> 07:22:44.340 align:start position:0%
you know there is a lot of broad
 
07:22:46.010 --> 07:22:46.020 align:start position:0%
language in the drug paraphernalia
 
07:22:48.190 --> 07:22:48.200 align:start position:0%
definition and statute
 
07:22:50.990 --> 07:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
those things on their own do not
 
07:22:53.810 --> 07:22:53.820 align:start position:0%
constitute probable cause for a surge so
 
07:22:55.548 --> 07:22:55.558 align:start position:0%
anytime that law enforcement is coming
 
07:22:57.788 --> 07:22:57.798 align:start position:0%
across these things it's usually because
 
07:23:00.770 --> 07:23:00.780 align:start position:0%
we have already established that there
 
07:23:03.410 --> 07:23:03.420 align:start position:0%
are other things there so but that helps
 
07:23:05.868 --> 07:23:05.878 align:start position:0%
build the probable cause for
 
07:23:07.670 --> 07:23:07.680 align:start position:0%
um you know for a judge to say oh yeah
 
07:23:10.430 --> 07:23:10.440 align:start position:0%
we do believe that there is is something
 
07:23:12.230 --> 07:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
illegal there and you are allowed to
 
07:23:14.030 --> 07:23:14.040 align:start position:0%
serve it so
 
07:23:16.850 --> 07:23:16.860 align:start position:0%
it would just take a tool away so yeah
 
07:23:19.128 --> 07:23:19.138 align:start position:0%
in and of themselves the the packaging
 
07:23:21.708 --> 07:23:21.718 align:start position:0%
uh you know containers things like that
 
07:23:24.708 --> 07:23:24.718 align:start position:0%
without the the presence of an illegal
 
07:23:24.718 --> 07:23:25.788 align:start position:0%
without the the presence of an illegal
substance

07:23:25.788 --> 07:23:25.798 align:start position:0%
substance
 
07:23:28.070 --> 07:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
they're not illegal but when they're
 
07:23:30.350 --> 07:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
used in conjunction with
 
07:23:30.360 --> 07:23:30.948 align:start position:0%
used in conjunction with
um

07:23:30.948 --> 07:23:30.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:23:33.468 --> 07:23:33.478 align:start position:0%
the trafficking of Narcotics then then
 
07:23:35.330 --> 07:23:35.340 align:start position:0%
they do become part of the probable
 
07:23:37.670 --> 07:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
cause that we would use I'm concerned
 
07:23:39.948 --> 07:23:39.958 align:start position:0%
not only the probable cause but making
 
07:23:42.468 --> 07:23:42.478 align:start position:0%
your case if if you're if you're trying
 
07:23:44.750 --> 07:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
to make the leap from possession
 
07:23:47.270 --> 07:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
to possession intent or actual dealing
 
07:23:49.610 --> 07:23:49.620 align:start position:0%
you have to have a certain amount and
 
07:23:51.708 --> 07:23:51.718 align:start position:0%
also packaging material to indicate that
 
07:23:53.390 --> 07:23:53.400 align:start position:0%
this is the intent was to distribute
 
07:23:56.208 --> 07:23:56.218 align:start position:0%
these drugs by taking this away with
 
07:23:58.670 --> 07:23:58.680 align:start position:0%
that limit your ability to make a case
 
07:24:00.890 --> 07:24:00.900 align:start position:0%
of of you make a good point I believe
 
07:24:09.230 --> 07:24:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:09.240 --> 07:24:10.090 align:start position:0%
 
okay

07:24:10.090 --> 07:24:10.100 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:24:12.830 --> 07:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question thank
 
07:24:14.270 --> 07:24:14.280 align:start position:0%
you Mr Jared
 
07:24:15.650 --> 07:24:15.660 align:start position:0%
um I was just wondering if there was
 
07:24:18.110 --> 07:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
language changes that could be made to
 
07:24:20.150 --> 07:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
this bill that would leave it more open
 
07:24:22.010 --> 07:24:22.020 align:start position:0%
to testing for other substances Beyond
 
07:24:23.510 --> 07:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
fentanyl that the police department
 
07:24:26.390 --> 07:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
would find more amenable
 
07:24:29.990 --> 07:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
so I think I mean that just a suggestion
 
07:24:32.030 --> 07:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
would be to identify the substances that
 
07:24:33.410 --> 07:24:33.420 align:start position:0%
we're most worried about you know
 
07:24:37.548 --> 07:24:37.558 align:start position:0%
whether that's uh fentanyl heroin
 
07:24:40.310 --> 07:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
um you know methamphetamine things like
 
07:24:42.468 --> 07:24:42.478 align:start position:0%
that and you know like if you were very
 
07:24:45.110 --> 07:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
specific about about those things we
 
07:24:46.548 --> 07:24:46.558 align:start position:0%
would we would look at that at that
 
07:24:46.558 --> 07:24:47.448 align:start position:0%
would we would look at that at that
language

07:24:47.448 --> 07:24:47.458 align:start position:0%
language
 
07:24:51.890 --> 07:24:51.900 align:start position:0%
like xylazine xylazine okay yeah
 
07:24:53.868 --> 07:24:53.878 align:start position:0%
yeah represent wheeler thank you Mr
 
07:24:56.150 --> 07:24:56.160 align:start position:0%
chair I just want for clarification I
 
07:24:57.110 --> 07:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
think you might have mentioned in
 
07:24:58.788 --> 07:24:58.798 align:start position:0%
orientation but is the state police
 
07:25:01.190 --> 07:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
taking a position on this or do they
 
07:25:03.350 --> 07:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
generally take positions so I I opposed
 
07:25:05.208 --> 07:25:05.218 align:start position:0%
this one I was neutral on on the last
 
07:25:07.670 --> 07:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
one I opposed this one because of how
 
07:25:09.350 --> 07:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
broad it is
 
07:25:11.448 --> 07:25:11.458 align:start position:0%
um so that that's my position on this
 
07:25:13.128 --> 07:25:13.138 align:start position:0%
bill specifically the way it's written
 
07:25:13.138 --> 07:25:17.150 align:start position:0%
bill specifically the way it's written
up

07:25:17.150 --> 07:25:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:19.490 --> 07:25:19.500 align:start position:0%
there'd be no questions thank you thank

07:25:24.410 --> 07:25:24.420 align:start position:0%
