just a few minutes
 
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 align:start position:0%
late so we will we'll pause for a
 
00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 align:start position:0%
moment well actually while you're
 
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 align:start position:0%
getting ready I'll I'll just run through
 
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 align:start position:0%
sort of what what my understanding is
 
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 align:start position:0%
and what I've learned um I forgot to
 
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 align:start position:0%
open my email but basically um because
 
00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:17.439 align:start position:0%
the pllc rules professional limited
 
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
liability uh corporations cover a range
 
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:20.749 align:start position:0%
liability uh corporations cover a range
of

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 align:start position:0%
professions um you know this this the
 
00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
idea or the need for this bill uh
 
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
started with um the veterinary
 
00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
profession uh solo practice Veterinary
 
00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 align:start position:0%
profession and um you know the the base
 
00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 align:start position:0%
of the bill was drafted with that sort
 
00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 align:start position:0%
of context in mind uh but obviously
 
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 align:start position:0%
whatever we do is going to have impacts
 
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 align:start position:0%
on all of the professions that use the
 
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 align:start position:0%
pllc um corporate structure and so it's
 
00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 align:start position:0%
important that we go through the um the
 
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 align:start position:0%
concerns that might arise with the other
 
00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 align:start position:0%
plc's I will say that I have um been in
 
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 align:start position:0%
in touch leading up to this with um the
 
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Medical Society um and you
 
00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 align:start position:0%
know to see whether or not as sort of
 
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 align:start position:0%
the largest um you know non-legal uh
 
00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 align:start position:0%
clinical group that's covered by
 
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 align:start position:0%
pllc um and I'm sorry I'm just trying to
 
00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 align:start position:0%
pull up the the final email
 
00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 align:start position:0%
um but basically they reviewed the law
 
00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
they said they had decided initially not
 
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 align:start position:0%
to weigh in on uh House built 82 um they
 
00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 align:start position:0%
went back and looked at it again and
 
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
checked with their um inter internal um
 
00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 align:start position:0%
you know operations and and came back
 
00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 align:start position:0%
and basically said that they don't have
 
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
any concerns with House Bill 1082 they
 
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 align:start position:0%
also um reached out to oplc the office
 
00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
of uh professional
 
00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.070 align:start position:0%
of uh professional
lure

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
lure
 
00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 align:start position:0%
certification um I think uh to see
 
00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 align:start position:0%
whether they had any concerns um I
 
00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 align:start position:0%
hadn't initially because it didn't
 
00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 align:start position:0%
really imp impact you know lure it's not
 
00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
a two-way thing that we're doing it's
 
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 align:start position:0%
it's really just the corporate side of
 
00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 align:start position:0%
of plc's and uh oplc came back as well
 
00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 align:start position:0%
and said that they don't have any
 
00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 align:start position:0%
concerns so neither of those
 
00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:13.879 align:start position:0%
organizations is taking a position Pro
 
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 align:start position:0%
oron on the bill but they they stated
 
00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 align:start position:0%
that they don't have concerns so um I
 
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
don't know if anyone else has any
 
00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
information about other professions or
 
00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 align:start position:0%
whether we can sort of move directly to
 
00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 align:start position:0%
the questions related to
 
00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 align:start position:0%
um uh legal plc's legal profession
 
00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
plc's um because I I don't I haven't
 
00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 align:start position:0%
gotten the sense that this is going to
 
00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
be a problem for clinical practice
 
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 align:start position:0%
PC's so um with that I I don't know
 
00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 align:start position:0%
whether anyone else is coming to the
 
00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 align:start position:0%
meeting um Zoe did you ever hear back
 
00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
from the folks uh I reached out to both
 
00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 align:start position:0%

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:01.949 align:start position:0%

representative

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 align:start position:0%
M um I reached out to both the Bor
 
00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 align:start position:0%
Association to the Ethics Committee and
 
00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 align:start position:0%
I reached out to attorney John
 
00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
Cunningham who is the New Hampshire Guru
 
00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:15.919 align:start position:0%
on llll on
 
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 align:start position:0%
llc's um I asked that a witness from the
 
00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 align:start position:0%
bar association from the Ethics
 
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
Committee specifically come to
 
00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 align:start position:0%
testify and I reached out to them about
 
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 align:start position:0%
two weeks ago and they never got back to
 
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 align:start position:0%
me I tried I reached out to them again
 
00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 align:start position:0%
yesterday and never heard back from them
 
00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:36.199 align:start position:0%
so I am to be honest I'm feeling
 
00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
frustrated about that I do have a copy
 
00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:43.199 align:start position:0%
of the ethics opinion that was issued
 
00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 align:start position:0%
in uh
 
00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
20120 that directly talks about this
 
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 align:start position:0%
issue um I do have concerns about it in
 
00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 align:start position:0%
bill so I do have concerns about it in
 
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 align:start position:0%
terms of plc's for uh single member uh
 
00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.430 align:start position:0%
terms of plc's for uh single member uh
law

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
practices um so I don't know how to
 
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 align:start position:0%
handle that um and um I did speak to
 
00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:20.039 align:start position:0%
attorney Cunningham briefly yesterday
 
00:05:22.749 --> 00:05:22.759 align:start position:0%
and he was strongly opposed to the bill
 
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 align:start position:0%
and I asked him if his if his opinion
 
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
was limited to law practices and he said
 
00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 align:start position:0%
no I gave him the example of a vet or a
 
00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
doctor and he said same thing um that a
 
00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
nonprofessional should not in any way be
 
00:05:44.309 --> 00:05:44.319 align:start position:0%
um managing a professional Li limited
 
00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:48.759 align:start position:0%
liability uh company okay so I just one
 
00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:50.639 align:start position:0%
question on that because I I had seen
 
00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
some of your back and forth emails with
 
00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560 align:start position:0%
him um and they seem to imply that he
 
00:06:01.309 --> 00:06:01.319 align:start position:0%
thought that this would allow allow the
 
00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
assistant manager to actually do things
 
00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
that would fall within the realm of
 
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
licensure so you know I think there was
 
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
an example of you know can it can it
 
00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:14.800 align:start position:0%
allow you know this person to give
 
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
Veterinary medication and then I think
 
00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:18.599 align:start position:0%
there was another example sorry I don't
 
00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.080 align:start position:0%
have I didn't open that email in front
 
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
of me because I thought they'd be here
 
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:27.720 align:start position:0%
um so I I I want to disentangle the
 
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 align:start position:0%
question of of whe whether or not
 
00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:32.599 align:start position:0%
there's some confusion about
 
00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:36.520 align:start position:0%
what this would authorize someone to do
 
00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:39.199 align:start position:0%
because I I'm pretty clear I think
 
00:06:41.589 --> 00:06:41.599 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong that that
 
00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:43.880 align:start position:0%
passing this is specifically stating
 
00:06:46.029 --> 00:06:46.039 align:start position:0%
because it says a non-qualified person a
 
00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:47.960 align:start position:0%
qualified person is is defined as
 
00:06:50.909 --> 00:06:50.919 align:start position:0%
someone in the profession that this
 
00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:53.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't uh grant them any of the rights
 
00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
that fall within the lure this would
 
00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
basically allow them to operate the
 
00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:00.639 align:start position:0%
corporation corporate side of the
 
00:07:05.309 --> 00:07:05.319 align:start position:0%
practice um in in terms of either you
 
00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:07.120 align:start position:0%
know dissolving it converting it to
 
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
another structure where they can
 
00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:13.639 align:start position:0%
actually be the be the um the operator
 
00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:17.800 align:start position:0%
or um and and again Roger might want to
 
00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:21.720 align:start position:0%
weigh in you know hire um somebody
 
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
outside the practice to to who is
 
00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:26.639 align:start position:0%
licensed to run the practice until you
 
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
know until the a new structure can be
 
00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:32.879 align:start position:0%
put in place um so that I just wanted to
 
00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:35.560 align:start position:0%
see if if we understood why the
 
00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
representative um uh conningham is it um
 
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
had those objections it's attorney
 
00:07:44.469 --> 00:07:44.479 align:start position:0%
Cunningham yeah sorry OB sorry yes I
 
00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:48.360 align:start position:0%
think the distinction between the
 
00:07:52.189 --> 00:07:52.199 align:start position:0%
manager or the assistant manager um
 
00:07:56.629 --> 00:07:56.639 align:start position:0%
being limited to managerial tasks I
 
00:08:00.309 --> 00:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
think that's clear the problem is
 
00:08:02.589 --> 00:08:02.599 align:start position:0%
let's use the most clear-cut Example The
 
00:08:04.589 --> 00:08:04.599 align:start position:0%
Single member
 
00:08:07.029 --> 00:08:07.039 align:start position:0%
pllc let's use it as an
 
00:08:10.629 --> 00:08:10.639 align:start position:0%
attorney the single member pllc attorney
 
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:14.800 align:start position:0%
drops dead of a heart attack on Monday
 
00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:17.240 align:start position:0%
morning you have issues of
 
00:08:19.029 --> 00:08:19.039 align:start position:0%
confidentiality you can't have an
 
00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:21.400 align:start position:0%
assistant manager looking into client
 
00:08:23.869 --> 00:08:23.879 align:start position:0%
files you can't have an assistant
 
00:08:28.309 --> 00:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
manager communicating with clients um I
 
00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:30.520 align:start position:0%
only brought one copy of the of the
 
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
ethics opinion but they rais a lot of
 
00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:36.919 align:start position:0%
these issues and I think um and you
 
00:08:39.149 --> 00:08:39.159 align:start position:0%
immediately have an attorney needing to
 
00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
be responsible
 
00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
for which cases can be continued what
 
00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
needs to be done when so the concept
 
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
that there is time for an assistant
 
00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.310 align:start position:0%
that there is time for an assistant
manager

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
manager
 
00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:01.360 align:start position:0%
to um I don't know retain an attorney to
 
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:03.160 align:start position:0%
manage the
 
00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:07.800 align:start position:0%
cases um it just doesn't work and I
 
00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
think the problem would be the same I
 
00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:13.880 align:start position:0%
mean I certainly respect the New
 
00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:16.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Medical Society and they know
 
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:17.560 align:start position:0%
their business better than I do
 
00:09:21.269 --> 00:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
obviously but um I would think you would
 
00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
have the same issues in a in a medical
 
00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:27.560 align:start position:0%
situation of confidentiality
 
00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:31.880 align:start position:0%
privacy um need to immediately deal with
 
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
patient issues
 
00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:38.800 align:start position:0%
um I used the example of an accountant
 
00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:41.360 align:start position:0%
you would have the same issues of
 
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
confidentiality um there you have
 
00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:45.640 align:start position:0%
financial matters
 
00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:47.389 align:start position:0%
financial matters
and

00:09:47.389 --> 00:09:47.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
um I don't know about the situation of a
 
00:09:54.069 --> 00:09:54.079 align:start position:0%
vet um you would obviously have the
 
00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
immediate issues of who's going to do
 
00:09:58.269 --> 00:09:58.279 align:start position:0%
surgery if that's necessary who's going
 
00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
to write Scripts
 
00:10:02.949 --> 00:10:02.959 align:start position:0%
um all of those issues but but I don't
 
00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
know the specifics
 
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
there but I think I think even though
 
00:10:10.949 --> 00:10:10.959 align:start position:0%
the assistant manager would be limited
 
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
problematic yeah you know as as I've
 
00:10:20.069 --> 00:10:20.079 align:start position:0%
thought about this more I I I think I
 
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:22.680 align:start position:0%
disagree uh representative Manos I
 
00:10:24.829 --> 00:10:24.839 align:start position:0%
because the
 
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
specific qualification that the the
 
00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
assistant managers uh what the assistant
 
00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
manager can do is subject to 304 D5
 
00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
which specifically says
 
00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
that the uh you know somebody that's not
 
00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:43.720 align:start position:0%
a professional can't do any of the
 
00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
professional things and so I guess you
 
00:10:48.829 --> 00:10:48.839 align:start position:0%
know in your exam I mean I don't get me
 
00:10:51.629 --> 00:10:51.639 align:start position:0%
wrong I would agree with you that if a
 
00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:54.040 align:start position:0%
solo practice attorney
 
00:10:56.829 --> 00:10:56.839 align:start position:0%
dies uh and has you know an assistant
 
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:00.160 align:start position:0%
manager in the practice that assistant
 
00:11:02.269 --> 00:11:02.279 align:start position:0%
manager what that assistant manager can
 
00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:04.040 align:start position:0%
do is going to be very is going to be
 
00:11:05.949 --> 00:11:05.959 align:start position:0%
pretty limited compared to what the
 
00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:08.360 align:start position:0%
attorney was doing but for example I
 
00:11:11.389 --> 00:11:11.399 align:start position:0%
would think the assistant manager can do
 
00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:15.200 align:start position:0%
things like pay the other staff pay the
 
00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:19.240 align:start position:0%
rent on the office uh you know pay the
 
00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
taxes that that were that were due or
 
00:11:25.069 --> 00:11:25.079 align:start position:0%
those kind of things and I would think
 
00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
and you know the client
 
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:30.720 align:start position:0%
files I I think that's I I'm not sure
 
00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:32.440 align:start position:0%
that it that it is so black and white in
 
00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:34.680 align:start position:0%
other words if the if the assistant
 
00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
manager under the direction of the
 
00:11:40.629 --> 00:11:40.639 align:start position:0%
attorney were while the attorney was
 
00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
alive was was able to um you know if if
 
00:11:48.389 --> 00:11:48.399 align:start position:0%
for example if the attorney if the
 
00:11:49.949 --> 00:11:49.959 align:start position:0%
attorney while he was alive he or she
 
00:11:53.069 --> 00:11:53.079 align:start position:0%
was alive said to the assistant
 
00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:57.560 align:start position:0%
manager can you look in client X's file
 
00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:01.720 align:start position:0%
and uh uh find out who who his treating
 
00:12:03.949 --> 00:12:03.959 align:start position:0%
physician was and send the treating
 
00:12:07.069 --> 00:12:07.079 align:start position:0%
physician a letter I think the the the
 
00:12:09.269 --> 00:12:09.279 align:start position:0%
assistant manager could do that even
 
00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
though the assistant manager is not an
 
00:12:15.629 --> 00:12:15.639 align:start position:0%
attorney once the assistant manager once
 
00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
the attorney has died it's not clear to
 
00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
me that automatically the assistant
 
00:12:23.829 --> 00:12:23.839 align:start position:0%
manager can no longer look in the file
 
00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:26.440 align:start position:0%
um you know I maybe that's true but
 
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
maybe not but I guess
 
00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.629 align:start position:0%
maybe not but I guess
to

00:12:31.629 --> 00:12:31.639 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
me it it seems like the way this is
 
00:12:39.629 --> 00:12:39.639 align:start position:0%
worded what likely would have to happen
 
00:12:42.829 --> 00:12:42.839 align:start position:0%
very quickly in the case of a of a
 
00:12:44.509 --> 00:12:44.519 align:start position:0%
lawyer probably a doctor or anyone else
 
00:12:47.269 --> 00:12:47.279 align:start position:0%
is that the the assistant manager would
 
00:12:50.949 --> 00:12:50.959 align:start position:0%
have to be in touch for example with the
 
00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:53.800 align:start position:0%
bar association and say you know I know
 
00:12:55.829 --> 00:12:55.839 align:start position:0%
that for example I know that the bar I
 
00:12:58.430 --> 00:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
know you Bar Association have procedures
 
00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:01.160 align:start position:0%
for how fi client files need to be
 
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
handled Etc when when an attorney dies
 
00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
I'm calling to let you know that
 
00:13:09.189 --> 00:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
attorney Smith has died uh you know I'm
 
00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
the assistant manager in his practice
 
00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:14.720 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna pay the rent and pay the
 
00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
employees and do those kind of things
 
00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
but um I really need an attorney to be
 
00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:22.160 align:start position:0%
here because there's some things that
 
00:13:24.069 --> 00:13:24.079 align:start position:0%
have to be done that may have to be done
 
00:13:25.829 --> 00:13:25.839 align:start position:0%
pretty quickly I need an attorney to be
 
00:13:28.269 --> 00:13:28.279 align:start position:0%
able to look at over the files and do
 
00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
those kind of things and I would think
 
00:13:32.629 --> 00:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
that that that you know that that would
 
00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
be a similar thing would be done with
 
00:13:37.069 --> 00:13:37.079 align:start position:0%
medical practices or dental practices or
 
00:13:39.269 --> 00:13:39.279 align:start position:0%
whatever so that that I think that's
 
00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
that's my view on this I I think that
 
00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:44.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
right um did you have any thoughts or
 
00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
insights into this represent me yeah I
 
00:13:53.509 --> 00:13:53.519 align:start position:0%
guess I guess my thoughts are
 
00:13:57.389 --> 00:13:57.399 align:start position:0%
a are more grounded in the the idea that
 
00:13:59.829 --> 00:13:59.839 align:start position:0%
there are lots of
 
00:14:04.629 --> 00:14:04.639 align:start position:0%
business entity options and I I and I I
 
00:14:07.629 --> 00:14:07.639 align:start position:0%
hear both representative Manos and
 
00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:09.880 align:start position:0%
representative Lyn's points I I think
 
00:14:13.389 --> 00:14:13.399 align:start position:0%
they're both they're both valid
 
00:14:17.949 --> 00:14:17.959 align:start position:0%
um and I I do I just wonder if starting
 
00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
over was there a better
 
00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
option for the scenario that that that
 
00:14:27.069 --> 00:14:27.079 align:start position:0%
that led you to filing this legislation
 
00:14:28.749 --> 00:14:28.759 align:start position:0%
and I I I don't know what what that
 
00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
answer would be and
 
00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
I um I think the fact that for my
 
00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
understanding estate planning kind of
 
00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:40.240 align:start position:0%
played a role in why this issue kind of
 
00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
bubbled up I I'm concerned
 
00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:46.240 align:start position:0%
about kind of
 
00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.870 align:start position:0%
about kind of
intertwining

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
intertwining
 
00:14:51.269 --> 00:14:51.279 align:start position:0%
two related but somewhat distinct areas
 
00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
of law
 
00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
um and I'm not sure I have the answer to
 
00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
I I do understand the human aspect of
 
00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:04.680 align:start position:0%
starting off thinking that you have the
 
00:15:08.269 --> 00:15:08.279 align:start position:0%
right idea that the pllc is is the right
 
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
idea for your professional practice for
 
00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
one's professional practice and then
 
00:15:16.509 --> 00:15:16.519 align:start position:0%
realizing that you have um estate
 
00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
planning concerns and that business
 
00:15:23.269 --> 00:15:23.279 align:start position:0%
decision doesn't necessarily fit in that
 
00:15:27.309 --> 00:15:27.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:30.440 align:start position:0%
and I yes yeah that that that is kind of
 
00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
my concern just the fact that there that
 
00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:36.440 align:start position:0%
we there are other business options and
 
00:15:39.069 --> 00:15:39.079 align:start position:0%
they are it would be difficult to
 
00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
convert from one to another possibly I'm
 
00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:44.720 align:start position:0%
not exactly sure but it does seem like
 
00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:45.470 align:start position:0%
not exactly sure but it does seem like
these

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
are there are two competing interests
 
00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:51.560 align:start position:0%
that are that are kind of trying to fit
 
00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:53.110 align:start position:0%
that are that are kind of trying to fit
into

00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
into
 
00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
one business entity right now okay if
 
00:15:58.829 --> 00:15:58.839 align:start position:0%
that makes sense I mean you can yeah no
 
00:16:00.949 --> 00:16:00.959 align:start position:0%
I I think that I think that is a good
 
00:16:03.389 --> 00:16:03.399 align:start position:0%
statement of of the Crux here I I I I
 
00:16:04.749 --> 00:16:04.759 align:start position:0%
think I I'm starting from the
 
00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
perspective and I may I may invite Roger
 
00:16:09.509 --> 00:16:09.519 align:start position:0%
if you're interested to come and and
 
00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
respond to that as well um because there
 
00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
are plc's that are Solo practices um you
 
00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:17.720 align:start position:0%
know good number across the profession
 
00:16:20.389 --> 00:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
so the the issue exists to the extent
 
00:16:23.269 --> 00:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
that there are single practice plc's my
 
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
understanding is um other than the legal
 
00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
profession which
 
00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
um uh representative Manos has has
 
00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:35.800 align:start position:0%
uncovered guidance on what should happen
 
00:16:39.269 --> 00:16:39.279 align:start position:0%
um or at least what could happen um the
 
00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:41.240 align:start position:0%
other professions do not have this
 
00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:43.480 align:start position:0%
guidance and they sort of require this
 
00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
kind of Unwritten
 
00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
unstructured relationship to be
 
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
established um that basically says if if
 
00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
this situation arises you know this
 
00:16:56.829 --> 00:16:56.839 align:start position:0%
other person who has no relationship to
 
00:16:59.509 --> 00:16:59.519 align:start position:0%
your your practice or or your business
 
00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
is going to basically agree to step in
 
00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
and function in that way this would
 
00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
allow the assistant manager for example
 
00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
to change the corporate structure to say
 
00:17:10.949 --> 00:17:10.959 align:start position:0%
uh we're no longer a pllc we're just an
 
00:17:14.669 --> 00:17:14.679 align:start position:0%
LLC and and then basically go forward in
 
00:17:16.669 --> 00:17:16.679 align:start position:0%
that way Roger did you want to waigh in
 
00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:20.120 align:start position:0%
on sorry Mr gown would you want to weigh
 
00:17:23.029 --> 00:17:23.039 align:start position:0%
in on this Roger is fine um right so
 
00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:24.720 align:start position:0%
let's remember let's go back to the the
 
00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:27.079 align:start position:0%
whole point of this is that absence an
 
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
assistant manager you have somebody
 
00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
who has to step into your practice who
 
00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:33.080 align:start position:0%
has may have no relation to it that was
 
00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:34.520 align:start position:0%
the the corporate structure that we had
 
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
in our practice for many years and the
 
00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
successful practice to ours now that
 
00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
it's sold also has that structure
 
00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:42.440 align:start position:0%
because that's how a PLC has to oper a
 
00:17:46.669 --> 00:17:46.679 align:start position:0%
single soul member PLC has to operate um
 
00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:49.160 align:start position:0%
it's not ideal to say the least and the
 
00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:51.720 align:start position:0%
goal is to is to solve that problem um
 
00:17:54.029 --> 00:17:54.039 align:start position:0%
any any structure any revision of the
 
00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:56.240 align:start position:0%
law that solves that problem you know is
 
00:17:58.510 --> 00:17:58.520 align:start position:0%
going to be better than what we have now
 
00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
um I think it's important to to note
 
00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
that absent an assistant manager there
 
00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
is nobody to appoint a
 
00:18:09.789 --> 00:18:09.799 align:start position:0%
new a new legal structure a new a new
 
00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:11.480 align:start position:0%
operator to the for the business the
 
00:18:15.029 --> 00:18:15.039 align:start position:0%
business is going to fall apart um the
 
00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
business has to go to probate or an
 
00:18:18.549 --> 00:18:18.559 align:start position:0%
executive has to go to probate court to
 
00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
get permission to do the next thing and
 
00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
in that time the business is going to
 
00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:24.440 align:start position:0%
fall apart so that situation is much
 
00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:26.440 align:start position:0%
worse than than any reasonable thing
 
00:18:28.909 --> 00:18:28.919 align:start position:0%
that could happen to to
 
00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:31.720 align:start position:0%
wind down the business in a sensible way
 
00:18:33.669 --> 00:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
um I definitely recognize the the
 
00:18:35.029 --> 00:18:35.039 align:start position:0%
professional concerns the assistant
 
00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
manager should not be operating in any
 
00:18:40.029 --> 00:18:40.039 align:start position:0%
kind of professional capacity but in a
 
00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:41.640 align:start position:0%
medical office there are not there are
 
00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:43.720 align:start position:0%
people who are not doctors who have
 
00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:45.080 align:start position:0%
access to medical records and they're
 
00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:46.600 align:start position:0%
subject to Hipp rules and all those
 
00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:49.320 align:start position:0%
kinds of things um in a legal office
 
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
there are par professionals and I assume
 
00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
that they also have have um ethical
 
00:18:56.149 --> 00:18:56.159 align:start position:0%
standards that they have to follow
 
00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
so just because someone is not a
 
00:18:59.669 --> 00:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
licensed member of the profession
 
00:19:01.549 --> 00:19:01.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that they don't have ways
 
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
of operating properly within the
 
00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:05.960 align:start position:0%
profession um the assistant manager
 
00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
might be the office manager of a of a
 
00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:10.520 align:start position:0%
dental office or something like that who
 
00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
knows perfectly well how to keep the
 
00:19:14.549 --> 00:19:14.559 align:start position:0%
business running for a short time
 
00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:16.840 align:start position:0%
they're not going to do teeth tooth
 
00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:19.240 align:start position:0%
extractions or whatever the thing is but
 
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
they can go find somebody they can get
 
00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:22.840 align:start position:0%
the patients moved to other practices
 
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
they can get the business converted to
 
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
an LLC all the things that have to
 
00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
happen you know the other thing I as I'm
 
00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:33.720 align:start position:0%
sort of thinking about this and I um I I
 
00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
have I I I don't know all of the
 
00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:38.840 align:start position:0%
implications of the ethics opinion but I
 
00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
mean it would seem to me that in as I
 
00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
recall what what happened when you know
 
00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:45.880 align:start position:0%
when an
 
00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
attorney died or became uh incompetent
 
00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:52.760 align:start position:0%
or whatever um the Supreme Court um
 
00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
would appoint an attorney to kind of you
 
00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
know wind up the person's practice but I
 
00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:03.720 align:start position:0%
I don't I mean I never really got into
 
00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:05.480 align:start position:0%
the details of this but I would be
 
00:20:07.669 --> 00:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
surprised if the attorney that did that
 
00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
was being told you know would would
 
00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
would understand that he or she was
 
00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
taking on the
 
00:20:15.909 --> 00:20:15.919 align:start position:0%
responsibility of like what are you
 
00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:18.440 align:start position:0%
going to you know let's just say the the
 
00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
attorney owned U the practice owned a
 
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
building what are you going to do with
 
00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
this building you're going to get rid of
 
00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:25.640 align:start position:0%
the building you're going to sell it
 
00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:28.520 align:start position:0%
you're not going to sell it I I my
 
00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
impression was that the attorney would
 
00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
the attorney's job that in that in that
 
00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
role was to sort of take over the client
 
00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
files and protect the client that that's
 
00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
that's the role that the attorney would
 
00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:46.840 align:start position:0%
have and that there would still
 
00:20:50.789 --> 00:20:50.799 align:start position:0%
be you know a a fairly significant area
 
00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:54.440 align:start position:0%
of sort of nonprofessional stuff that
 
00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
that um the attorney would not be taking
 
00:20:58.190 --> 00:20:58.200 align:start position:0%
over that's you know that the attorney
 
00:20:59.710 --> 00:20:59.720 align:start position:0%
was say wait a minute I'm not you know I
 
00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:01.880 align:start position:0%
don't know what you that's not my that's
 
00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
not my job I want to I'll I'll make sure
 
00:21:05.789 --> 00:21:05.799 align:start position:0%
that the clients get notified that
 
00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
they're interests are protected that the
 
00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
statute of limitations doesn't run on
 
00:21:13.789 --> 00:21:13.799 align:start position:0%
some claims or whatever but you know
 
00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
whether you're whether you're paying
 
00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:17.240 align:start position:0%
your employees or whether you paid the
 
00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
rent or whatever that's not that's not
 
00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:22.760 align:start position:0%
my job that I I would think that that
 
00:21:26.789 --> 00:21:26.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
um I I really wish we had somebody here
 
00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
from the ethics opinion from the Ethics
 
00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
Committee of the bar association but um
 
00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
I only have one copy of of the ethics
 
00:21:40.669 --> 00:21:40.679 align:start position:0%
opinion um and maybe we can get copies
 
00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
but it does it does say
 
00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
that as you mentioned replin the supreme
 
00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:51.240 align:start position:0%
court appoints somebody an attorney but
 
00:21:55.269 --> 00:21:55.279 align:start position:0%
then they do have the because the law
 
00:21:59.070 --> 00:21:59.080 align:start position:0%
practice is an asset of the attorney EST
 
00:22:04.669 --> 00:22:04.679 align:start position:0%
State um and so um so part of the job is
 
00:22:07.909 --> 00:22:07.919 align:start position:0%
to now I don't know how far it extends
 
00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
um uh I'm sorry I lost I lost where I
 
00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:23.190 align:start position:0%
um uh I'm sorry I lost I lost where I
was

00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:26.240 align:start position:0%
um oh it says required task if
 
00:22:28.029 --> 00:22:28.039 align:start position:0%
appropriate work with the personal rep
 
00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
representative of the of the deceased or
 
00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
incapacitated attorney to facilitate a
 
00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:35.080 align:start position:0%
sale of the practice under New Hampshire
 
00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
rule of professional conduct
 
00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:39.190 align:start position:0%
rule of professional conduct
1.17

00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:39.200 align:start position:0%
1.17
 
00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
so um although that appointed attorney
 
00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:47.640 align:start position:0%
may not be getting into the weeds of um
 
00:22:49.909 --> 00:22:49.919 align:start position:0%
selling the practice or dealing with the
 
00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:53.320 align:start position:0%
with the practice as a financial asset
 
00:22:55.549 --> 00:22:55.559 align:start position:0%
um they would work with the personal
 
00:22:57.669 --> 00:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
representative of the deceased attorney
 
00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:00.520 align:start position:0%
or incapacitated attorney to do those
 
00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:03.320 align:start position:0%
nuts and bolts or make sure that those
 
00:23:08.549 --> 00:23:08.559 align:start position:0%
tasks get done um required task um
 
00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
required task wind up the practices
 
00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
remaining business Affairs and close the
 
00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:17.080 align:start position:0%
practice so it does it does touch on
 
00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
some of the nuts and bolts that we're
 
00:23:21.549 --> 00:23:21.559 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:23:24.149 --> 00:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
um right but you know I guess what I I
 
00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
mean it I mean even if that's even if
 
00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
even if that the the attorney could do
 
00:23:32.909 --> 00:23:32.919 align:start position:0%
that I I wonder if isn't part of the
 
00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
whole idea of having the having the PLC
 
00:23:38.909 --> 00:23:38.919 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
it as opposed to a you know just a solo
 
00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:45.320 align:start position:0%
practice of individual proprietorship
 
00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:46.720 align:start position:0%
that having the
 
00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:49.480 align:start position:0%
pllc one of the ideas of that is to
 
00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
facilitate being able to transfer the
 
00:23:53.909 --> 00:23:53.919 align:start position:0%
business I mean I I always thought that
 
00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
that was one of the purposes of having a
 
00:23:59.390 --> 00:23:59.400 align:start position:0%
pllc was being a able to say well the
 
00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:02.600 align:start position:0%
business does not end just because you
 
00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:04.600 align:start position:0%
know whereas it would with the with the
 
00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:06.320 align:start position:0%
with the death of a solo practitioner
 
00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:08.320 align:start position:0%
who was an individual practitioner the
 
00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
pllc would not would it would go on and
 
00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:15.200 align:start position:0%
so you know again I I'm I'm still sort
 
00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
of back to I I don't really see how I I
 
00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
I I understand there will be overlap and
 
00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:24.440 align:start position:0%
I certainly think that one of the things
 
00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
as I think you pointed out
 
00:24:27.029 --> 00:24:27.039 align:start position:0%
representative tur at the beginning of
 
00:24:28.549 --> 00:24:28.559 align:start position:0%
this one of the things that
 
00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
would obviously have to happen very
 
00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
quickly in these one of these situations
 
00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:35.000 align:start position:0%
is to get
 
00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
the is for the assistant manager to be
 
00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
in touch with the bar association or the
 
00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:44.480 align:start position:0%
medical society or somebody that is that
 
00:24:47.389 --> 00:24:47.399 align:start position:0%
is qualified so that they can make you
 
00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:49.640 align:start position:0%
know they can make the those decisions
 
00:24:51.789 --> 00:24:51.799 align:start position:0%
that do have to be made professionally
 
00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:55.960 align:start position:0%
but I I I'm still not I still don't
 
00:24:57.950 --> 00:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
think that this is problematic the way
 
00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
it's word so I um so I'm wondering
 
00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
listening to what you just read
 
00:25:05.269 --> 00:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
representative Manos if these two things
 
00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:08.480 align:start position:0%
can be harmonized because that um ethics
 
00:25:11.269 --> 00:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
opinion and I don't know if we can cite
 
00:25:12.789 --> 00:25:12.799 align:start position:0%
that I don't know does that does an
 
00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:16.600 align:start position:0%
Ethics opinion have any sort of legal um
 
00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:19.640 align:start position:0%
standing or or is there a way to cite it
 
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
because I guess what I'm say thinking is
 
00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:23.720 align:start position:0%
maybe a Way Forward is to say something
 
00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:26.720 align:start position:0%
along the lines of to the extent that it
 
00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:29.200 align:start position:0%
does not conflict with you know
 
00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:31.640 align:start position:0%
something like the ethics opinion
 
00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:34.760 align:start position:0%
because I mean I I was glad to hear be
 
00:25:36.269 --> 00:25:36.279 align:start position:0%
reminded that the ethics opinion does
 
00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:39.200 align:start position:0%
sort of talk about working with the
 
00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:41.200 align:start position:0%
representative it seems like it would be
 
00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:43.240 align:start position:0%
easier to work with that representative
 
00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:47.000 align:start position:0%
if that person was able to
 
00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
function in the role of a corporate um
 
00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
manager or Corp corporate operator as
 
00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:55.720 align:start position:0%
opposed to just you know the inheritor
 
00:25:58.470 --> 00:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
of you know essentially a defunct legal
 
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
practice or a defunct Veterinary
 
00:26:03.549 --> 00:26:03.559 align:start position:0%
practice right you know this way the the
 
00:26:05.149 --> 00:26:05.159 align:start position:0%
the whoever the court appoints for the
 
00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
legal opinion would have an entity that
 
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
was able to actually do the things I
 
00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
think that that person would ask them to
 
00:26:14.549 --> 00:26:14.559 align:start position:0%
do which is sell the building or sell
 
00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
the practice or convert the practice or
 
00:26:18.669 --> 00:26:18.679 align:start position:0%
do you know but not actually have that
 
00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
person have to do those things and I I
 
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
do recognize that you have to go I do
 
00:26:25.669 --> 00:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
I'm I apologize and I so I guess but I
 
00:26:27.269 --> 00:26:27.279 align:start position:0%
you know if you maybe you could put
 
00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
something like you know uh something
 
00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
like saying in you know subject
 
00:26:39.269 --> 00:26:39.279 align:start position:0%
to um uh some language like subject to
 
00:26:43.789 --> 00:26:43.799 align:start position:0%
uh guidelines or or ethic ethics
 
00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
uh uh decisions issued by the the
 
00:26:49.149 --> 00:26:49.159 align:start position:0%
profession in in question or something
 
00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:52.520 align:start position:0%
like that um that I mean that I think
 
00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:54.520 align:start position:0%
that's I I guess all I'm saying really
 
00:26:57.710 --> 00:26:57.720 align:start position:0%
is I don't think that I think that the
 
00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:00.520 align:start position:0%
the idea here is a good idea and that we
 
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
shouldn't you know we we shouldn't like
 
00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
just say it can't be done that's that's
 
00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
kind of where I'm coming from and
 
00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
exactly how it gets done you know maybe
 
00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
we have to work on a little bit but and
 
00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:14.120 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I will you're intent is to
 
00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:16.200 align:start position:0%
come to come back okay I'll keep this
 
00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
I'll make sure we keep this
 
00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
open is go quickly if you are done I
 
00:27:25.269 --> 00:27:25.279 align:start position:0%
mean don't wait around just for me I can
 
00:27:28.669 --> 00:27:28.679 align:start position:0%
I can no okay I think we can keep this
 
00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
open as long as you all don't have
 
00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
anywhere else to go there's certainly
 
00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:34.640 align:start position:0%
you know there's there's certainly
 
00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:36.440 align:start position:0%
plenty to
 
00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
discuss um so I I guess in in in in
 
00:27:45.389 --> 00:27:45.399 align:start position:0%
light of what Bob said does does that
 
00:27:48.669 --> 00:27:48.679 align:start position:0%
help in any way um representative Manos
 
00:27:52.509 --> 00:27:52.519 align:start position:0%
in terms of making it clear that
 
00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
whatever Powers this I me because
 
00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:56.440 align:start position:0%
there's there's two things I think that
 
00:27:59.669 --> 00:27:59.679 align:start position:0%
we could do in Amendment one of them is
 
00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:02.360 align:start position:0%
affirmatively state that the assistant
 
00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:05.320 align:start position:0%
manager cannot exercise any professional
 
00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
judgment and maybe that would clear up
 
00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:10.360 align:start position:0%
the question which sounds like it's kind
 
00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:13.240 align:start position:0%
of lurking which is you know where's the
 
00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
line you know and for me for any medical
 
00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
lure or any lure I should say I always
 
00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
consider it to be the exercise of
 
00:28:22.909 --> 00:28:22.919 align:start position:0%
professional judgment is TE technically
 
00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
what you're being licensed to to do um
 
00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:28.360 align:start position:0%
and I certainly would think that we
 
00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
could get around that by clarifying
 
00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:33.640 align:start position:0%
maybe just clarifying that you know
 
00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:35.080 align:start position:0%
because the the practice won't be able
 
00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
to go forward the way it was going
 
00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
forward before obviously I mean this is
 
00:28:40.509 --> 00:28:40.519 align:start position:0%
this would be some sort of a
 
00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
catastrophic event that would lead to
 
00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:44.630 align:start position:0%
catastrophic event that would lead to
this

00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:48.440 align:start position:0%
situation um clearly these things happen
 
00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
currently it sounds like in the legal
 
00:28:53.029 --> 00:28:53.039 align:start position:0%
profession there is some guidance it
 
00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
sounds like in the clinical professions
 
00:28:57.950 --> 00:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
there isn't guidance and a must admit I
 
00:29:00.389 --> 00:29:00.399 align:start position:0%
did not reach out to the the
 
00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:04.120 align:start position:0%
um you know accounting um or or
 
00:29:07.789 --> 00:29:07.799 align:start position:0%
profession um but I guess what I'm
 
00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:09.480 align:start position:0%
thinking is if we can find a way to
 
00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:13.720 align:start position:0%
include some language to a clarify that
 
00:29:15.549 --> 00:29:15.559 align:start position:0%
whoever the assistant
 
00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:18.440 align:start position:0%
manager is they cannot exercise any
 
00:29:20.789 --> 00:29:20.799 align:start position:0%
professional judgment because they're
 
00:29:23.389 --> 00:29:23.399 align:start position:0%
not licensed um so it's sort of implied
 
00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
but not stated currently and then the
 
00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
second thing would be to put some sort
 
00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
of language in there that makes it clear
 
00:29:35.269 --> 00:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
that the guidelines of an ethic you know
 
00:29:38.389 --> 00:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
and again how I would cite this in the
 
00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
law maybe this is a question for uh um
 
00:29:48.549 --> 00:29:48.559 align:start position:0%
uh um OS to to figure out how to State
 
00:29:51.669 --> 00:29:51.679 align:start position:0%
this but you know to say that you know
 
00:29:54.149 --> 00:29:54.159 align:start position:0%
this should not put us in conflict with
 
00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
you know the professions and any
 
00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
guidance they have about this
 
00:30:00.509 --> 00:30:00.519 align:start position:0%
this um Roger did you want to say
 
00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:01.960 align:start position:0%
something you just talking about
 
00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
guidance I just wanted to point out that
 
00:30:05.269 --> 00:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
right now the guidance is coming from
 
00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
PLC attorneys or you know somebody that
 
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
you an attorney that you hire to
 
00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:10.720 align:start position:0%
organize your business and and what
 
00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:13.000 align:start position:0%
they're telling their clients as just as
 
00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:15.320 align:start position:0%
a regular course of businesses now you
 
00:30:17.669 --> 00:30:17.679 align:start position:0%
have to go find this other professional
 
00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
who's going to be willing to step in
 
00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
because otherwise you're you're you're
 
00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
really going to have even worse problem
 
00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:26.360 align:start position:0%
right right I I think that makes sense
 
00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:28.480 align:start position:0%
and and I guess I'm also trying to think
 
00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
like you know a profession is a couple
 
00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
of different things it's obviously you
 
00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:35.440 align:start position:0%
know it's a it's a very small group of
 
00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:37.720 align:start position:0%
people with with very specific training
 
00:30:40.389 --> 00:30:40.399 align:start position:0%
and knowledge you know it's
 
00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:44.840 align:start position:0%
also sometimes competitive um it's also
 
00:30:48.269 --> 00:30:48.279 align:start position:0%
sometimes um you know if you're in Solo
 
00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
practice you know could be isolating
 
00:30:53.149 --> 00:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
could be you know that you've just moved
 
00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
to the Lo the area you know I mean I'm
 
00:30:57.870 --> 00:30:57.880 align:start position:0%
also trying to expand like obviously the
 
00:30:59.549 --> 00:30:59.559 align:start position:0%
situation that you're talking about
 
00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:01.320 align:start position:0%
you've been in practice for a long time
 
00:31:03.789 --> 00:31:03.799 align:start position:0%
you have a lot of connections um I'm
 
00:31:05.389 --> 00:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
trying to think if someone comes to the
 
00:31:07.029 --> 00:31:07.039 align:start position:0%
state and they're not connected with
 
00:31:09.149 --> 00:31:09.159 align:start position:0%
anyone you know this could be a really
 
00:31:12.269 --> 00:31:12.279 align:start position:0%
awkward thing to ask someone to do and
 
00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
and again it doesn't carry for me it
 
00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't carry the the the weight of you
 
00:31:19.909 --> 00:31:19.919 align:start position:0%
know a legal a legal framework it just
 
00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:23.200 align:start position:0%
sort of says on the side try and work
 
00:31:24.789 --> 00:31:24.799 align:start position:0%
this out with
 
00:31:28.029 --> 00:31:28.039 align:start position:0%
somebody um yeah
 
00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:31.320 align:start position:0%
um M maybe representative M you can you
 
00:31:33.549 --> 00:31:33.559 align:start position:0%
can kind of remind me in that ethics
 
00:31:36.549 --> 00:31:36.559 align:start position:0%
opinion is there anything that discusses
 
00:31:39.029 --> 00:31:39.039 align:start position:0%
the difference between llc's and plc's
 
00:31:42.909 --> 00:31:42.919 align:start position:0%
and what benefits are conferred by plc's
 
00:31:47.149 --> 00:31:47.159 align:start position:0%
because my my main concern is that the
 
00:31:49.669 --> 00:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
there's there's an obvious difference PE
 
00:31:52.389 --> 00:31:52.399 align:start position:0%
the LLC structure is available to
 
00:31:52.399 --> 00:31:54.310 align:start position:0%
the LLC structure is available to
professionals

00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:54.320 align:start position:0%
professionals
 
00:31:56.629 --> 00:31:56.639 align:start position:0%
so I was just hoping we could have like
 
00:31:58.789 --> 00:31:58.799 align:start position:0%
some kind of conversation about what
 
00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
what benefits are conferred and why um
 
00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:03.590 align:start position:0%
what benefits are conferred and why um
why

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:06.760 align:start position:0%
PES um this opinion does not talk about
 
00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:07.590 align:start position:0%
PES um this opinion does not talk about
that

00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:09.149 align:start position:0%
that
distinction

00:32:09.149 --> 00:32:09.159 align:start position:0%
distinction
 
00:32:11.549 --> 00:32:11.559 align:start position:0%
um it does not talk about that
 
00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:14.600 align:start position:0%
distinction but it does talk about on
 
00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:18.200 align:start position:0%
the point that that remind me of your
 
00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:23.200 align:start position:0%
name uh rais um it does say
 
00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:26.200 align:start position:0%
um however in the meantime even if an
 
00:32:28.389 --> 00:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
attorney has done such planning and
 
00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:31.320 align:start position:0%
specifically meaning Estate Planning and
 
00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
specifically authorized another attorney
 
00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
in a succession plan to administer his
 
00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
or her practice in the event of death
 
00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:40.480 align:start position:0%
disability impairment or
 
00:32:42.629 --> 00:32:42.639 align:start position:0%
incapacity and this is the important
 
00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:45.240 align:start position:0%
point that that Authority ter terminates
 
00:32:47.950 --> 00:32:47.960 align:start position:0%
upon the attorney's death following
 
00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
death only the estate's personal
 
00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:52.240 align:start position:0%
representative I.E the attorney's
 
00:32:54.909 --> 00:32:54.919 align:start position:0%
executive or administrator has a legal
 
00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
authority to administer the estate's
 
00:32:59.190 --> 00:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
assets which would necessarily include
 
00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
the attorney's
 
00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
practice so I think that that's really
 
00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:05.960 align:start position:0%
the nub of what you're what you're
 
00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:09.240 align:start position:0%
running into because I agree I can't
 
00:33:12.629 --> 00:33:12.639 align:start position:0%
offer legal advice and and I'm not but I
 
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
agree that I think an attorney who's
 
00:33:19.509 --> 00:33:19.519 align:start position:0%
handling the formation of a pllc would
 
00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
advise exactly what you just said to
 
00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
arrange with another successor
 
00:33:26.269 --> 00:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
professional to take over in the event
 
00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
of the death or incapacity of the of the
 
00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
primary uh
 
00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:35.990 align:start position:0%
primary uh
professional

00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:39.200 align:start position:0%
um but I see the point here that on
 
00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
death everything it's the Estates
 
00:33:45.909 --> 00:33:45.919 align:start position:0%
administrator that becomes the
 
00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
responsible person um you end up in a
 
00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:57.950 --> 00:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
and in this at least in this ethical
 
00:34:02.149 --> 00:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
guidance I'm not seeing any way around
 
00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:03.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not
 
00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:07.240 align:start position:0%
seeing you end up in a catch 22 exactly
 
00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:10.720 align:start position:0%
and so that's why at least in the legal
 
00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
context you immediately have to get an
 
00:34:15.869 --> 00:34:15.879 align:start position:0%
attorney appointed by as replin was
 
00:34:19.069 --> 00:34:19.079 align:start position:0%
saying the New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
to immediately step in on the
 
00:34:25.869 --> 00:34:25.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:28.629 --> 00:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
um Rog
 
00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
the the legal profession appears to have
 
00:34:34.909 --> 00:34:34.919 align:start position:0%
taken care of its needs in this area um
 
00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:36.200 align:start position:0%
the other professions have to go to
 
00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
probate probate court and spend months
 
00:34:41.069 --> 00:34:41.079 align:start position:0%
and in that time the the practice
 
00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:43.240 align:start position:0%
dissolves so this is kind of where you
 
00:34:45.669 --> 00:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
get into this problem and I I would say
 
00:34:48.030 --> 00:34:48.040 align:start position:0%
just listening to that and correct me if
 
00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
it's not a good interpretation
 
00:34:53.470 --> 00:34:53.480 align:start position:0%
but it sort of conflates the corporate
 
00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:55.720 align:start position:0%
asset with the
 
00:34:57.950 --> 00:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
estate um
 
00:34:59.829 --> 00:34:59.839 align:start position:0%
in a way
 
00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:03.160 align:start position:0%
that maybe isn't required in other words
 
00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:05.640 align:start position:0%
like here it's sort of assuming that the
 
00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:08.720 align:start position:0%
practice as a corporation is essentially
 
00:35:11.349 --> 00:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
dead um that it that it that it no
 
00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:13.720 align:start position:0%
longer exists or or or and Roger shaking
 
00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:15.720 align:start position:0%
his head so I may be completely off Bas
 
00:35:18.109 --> 00:35:18.119 align:start position:0%
but um that that was my thought was
 
00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
essentially this would allow the
 
00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
corporation to continue as an operating
 
00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
entity as part of your estate as opposed
 
00:35:27.390 --> 00:35:27.400 align:start position:0%
to a dead entity as part of your state
 
00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:28.760 align:start position:0%
right right that's the goal I mean for
 
00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
the the the the so proprietor wants the
 
00:35:34.829 --> 00:35:34.839 align:start position:0%
value of the practice to whatever extent
 
00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:37.240 align:start position:0%
possible to be able to be extracted and
 
00:35:39.829 --> 00:35:39.839 align:start position:0%
given to the estate right and if there's
 
00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
no way to operate it at all the value
 
00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
that value is going to go to zero very
 
00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
quickly right right and so this you know
 
00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
it's less the way things happen these
 
00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
days maybe than it used to be but like a
 
00:35:55.870 --> 00:35:55.880 align:start position:0%
medical practice you know could be sold
 
00:35:57.470 --> 00:35:57.480 align:start position:0%
you know you have have a group of
 
00:36:00.069 --> 00:36:00.079 align:start position:0%
patients you have a building you have a
 
00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
staff you have you know a set of records
 
00:36:04.990 --> 00:36:05.000 align:start position:0%
and things like that you know if the
 
00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
entity can't operate obviously the
 
00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:09.000 align:start position:0%
medical practice dissolves and falls
 
00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:12.040 align:start position:0%
apart and has no value um as opposed to
 
00:36:15.069 --> 00:36:15.079 align:start position:0%
saying you know as a corporate entity it
 
00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
can go forward and it can take steps to
 
00:36:21.589 --> 00:36:21.599 align:start position:0%
resurrect the situation in a way where
 
00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:24.200 align:start position:0%
the value of the practice and its role
 
00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:27.200 align:start position:0%
can can be preserved to a greater degree
 
00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:29.160 align:start position:0%
than could have happened if you know
 
00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:32.240 align:start position:0%
it's just basically dissolved um and I
 
00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:34.680 align:start position:0%
think that's the goal of this and Roger
 
00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:37.720 align:start position:0%
correct correct me if I'm wrong so you
 
00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
know to me that is a kind of an
 
00:36:42.349 --> 00:36:42.359 align:start position:0%
overriding concern and again it's it's
 
00:36:48.190 --> 00:36:48.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
good I hope we're making some Headway
 
00:36:52.109 --> 00:36:52.119 align:start position:0%
we're trying to sort of talk through the
 
00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
idea of better better separating sort of
 
00:36:57.870 --> 00:36:57.880 align:start position:0%
the professional you know what what ha
 
00:36:59.309 --> 00:36:59.319 align:start position:0%
if someone dies which I think is the
 
00:37:01.589 --> 00:37:01.599 align:start position:0%
cleanest example but they can also be
 
00:37:03.829 --> 00:37:03.839 align:start position:0%
you know disbarred or or whatnot you
 
00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:07.160 align:start position:0%
know what diet is a cleaner example
 
00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
because it sort of takes off the
 
00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:10.720 align:start position:0%
whatever could have caused you to be
 
00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
disbar um you know in other words if if
 
00:37:16.589 --> 00:37:16.599 align:start position:0%
this if that if the practice becomes
 
00:37:19.829 --> 00:37:19.839 align:start position:0%
part of now someone's estate you know
 
00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:22.200 align:start position:0%
must the practice
 
00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:24.560 align:start position:0%
essentially lose all of its value
 
00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:26.680 align:start position:0%
because it can't it can't find any way
 
00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:28.640 align:start position:0%
to go forward as a functioning practice
 
00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
or or in this instance could you could
 
00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
someone step in as an assistant manager
 
00:37:35.829 --> 00:37:35.839 align:start position:0%
and take the
 
00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
corporate make the corporate choices not
 
00:37:40.829 --> 00:37:40.839 align:start position:0%
the not the professional choices to to
 
00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
allow that entity to continue and and
 
00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
essentially recover from the
 
00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:50.240 align:start position:0%
situation represent me yeah uh thank you
 
00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
so I think the so the concern I have is
 
00:37:58.109 --> 00:37:58.119 align:start position:0%
that um so limited Li liability
 
00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
companies are Partnerships at their core
 
00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
they're people focus and I think a c
 
00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:06.520 align:start position:0%
Partnerships a different isn't isn't a
 
00:38:07.950 --> 00:38:07.960 align:start position:0%
partnership different than a is a
 
00:38:10.510 --> 00:38:10.520 align:start position:0%
partnership different from an LLC I
 
00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:13.480 align:start position:0%
don't know I mean in the RSA it's it's
 
00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:16.040 align:start position:0%
it is listed under the partnership okay
 
00:38:20.069 --> 00:38:20.079 align:start position:0%
um sorry no that's that's fine and there
 
00:38:22.990 --> 00:38:23.000 align:start position:0%
is such a business entity as a
 
00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.309 align:start position:0%
is such a business entity as a
professional

00:38:24.309 --> 00:38:24.319 align:start position:0%
professional
 
00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
Corporation and
 
00:38:29.589 --> 00:38:29.599 align:start position:0%
not like not so many words the the whole
 
00:38:31.870 --> 00:38:31.880 align:start position:0%
point of it is that it exists
 
00:38:36.109 --> 00:38:36.119 align:start position:0%
after the shareholders potentially die
 
00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
um this is a professional a professional
 
00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:41.560 align:start position:0%
Corporation professional Corporation
 
00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
yeah so the corporation
 
00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:48.760 align:start position:0%
exists it you own shares just like any
 
00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
publicly traded company except it's a
 
00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:52.750 align:start position:0%
publicly traded company except it's a
private

00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:52.760 align:start position:0%
private
 
00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:55.510 align:start position:0%
private
Corporation

00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
Corporation
 
00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:58.390 align:start position:0%
Corporation
um

00:38:58.390 --> 00:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:02.309 --> 00:39:02.319 align:start position:0%
so again not not to be so unfeeling to
 
00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
to your plate but there
 
00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:10.040 align:start position:0%
are um Legal Professional options and I
 
00:39:13.950 --> 00:39:13.960 align:start position:0%
and I can see how maybe not to speak ill
 
00:39:16.910 --> 00:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
of your attorney but um maybe someone
 
00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:18.520 align:start position:0%
who is more focused on business
 
00:39:20.069 --> 00:39:20.079 align:start position:0%
practices wouldn't
 
00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:22.640 align:start position:0%
necessarily um consider all of the
 
00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:25.160 align:start position:0%
implications related to Estate Planning
 
00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
and I just wonder
 
00:39:28.470 --> 00:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
by doing this are
 
00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:31.160 align:start position:0%
we are we undermining the whole point of
 
00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:33.790 align:start position:0%
we are we undermining the whole point of
a

00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:33.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:37.240 align:start position:0%
pllc well I'm not an attorney but um
 
00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:39.400 align:start position:0%
what I gather is that the PLC structure
 
00:39:44.990 --> 00:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
is what attorneys favor for um all these
 
00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
situations and I can't sit here and tell
 
00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
you why okay thank you I I did do a
 
00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
little looking into what a pllc is and
 
00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
the the biggest thing and I know I've T
 
00:39:58.829 --> 00:39:58.839 align:start position:0%
mentioned that to you um represent Manos
 
00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
that it seems as though the biggest
 
00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
reason has to do with the ability to
 
00:40:06.069 --> 00:40:06.079 align:start position:0%
separate um professional liability you
 
00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
know which again might mean that it's an
 
00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:09.560 align:start position:0%
interesting choice if you're a solo
 
00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
practitioner there is no separation of
 
00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
for professional liability but um as as
 
00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:17.680 align:start position:0%
Roger just mentioned Mr G just mentioned
 
00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
um you know it does seem to be the the
 
00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
practice form of choice
 
00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:28.280 align:start position:0%
for many most most profession most
 
00:40:29.870 --> 00:40:29.880 align:start position:0%
professional practices I don't know the
 
00:40:34.349 --> 00:40:34.359 align:start position:0%
proportions um I know I I hear pllc used
 
00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:36.640 align:start position:0%
a lot in in professional
 
00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
circumstances um so I think to the
 
00:40:43.309 --> 00:40:43.319 align:start position:0%
extent that they exist or that that that
 
00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
we're not saying you can't be a solo
 
00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:48.760 align:start position:0%
practice pllc then it sort of falls back
 
00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
to us to say how this might best be
 
00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
handled because I mean the other option
 
00:40:56.309 --> 00:40:56.319 align:start position:0%
would be to say that you just can't
 
00:40:59.309 --> 00:40:59.319 align:start position:0%
can't be a solo it doesn't make sense or
 
00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
there you know or or or it's just in
 
00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
conflict with you know corporate logic
 
00:41:09.870 --> 00:41:09.880 align:start position:0%
or corporate law to say that you can be
 
00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
a a sing solo practice pllc because
 
00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:16.280 align:start position:0%
essentially it puts us in the
 
00:41:18.829 --> 00:41:18.839 align:start position:0%
catch22 um but again I don't know how to
 
00:41:22.030 --> 00:41:22.040 align:start position:0%
weigh the the the value of of of a of a
 
00:41:25.309 --> 00:41:25.319 align:start position:0%
professional Corporation versus a pllc
 
00:41:27.309 --> 00:41:27.319 align:start position:0%
other than that you know I use the
 
00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:29.160 align:start position:0%
economist's way of valuing things if
 
00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:30.770 align:start position:0%
somebody wants it then it has
 
00:41:30.770 --> 00:41:32.750 align:start position:0%
somebody wants it then it has
[Laughter]

00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:41:35.790 --> 00:41:35.800 align:start position:0%
value yeah um I have a I have a
 
00:41:38.430 --> 00:41:38.440 align:start position:0%
suggestion I don't know what our timing
 
00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:42.040 align:start position:0%
is and replin can can give us that but
 
00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering uh attorney Cunningham
 
00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
made it very clear that he just doesn't
 
00:41:48.309 --> 00:41:48.319 align:start position:0%
have the time to come he's got the
 
00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:50.720 align:start position:0%
willingness but not the time to come I'm
 
00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
wondering whether we have enough time to
 
00:41:57.309 --> 00:41:57.319 align:start position:0%
reconvene and hear from somebody body an
 
00:42:02.510 --> 00:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
attorney who is uh um educated and
 
00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
conversant in the in the distinctions
 
00:42:09.150 --> 00:42:09.160 align:start position:0%
between an LLC a pllc and other forms of
 
00:42:10.589 --> 00:42:10.599 align:start position:0%
organ business
 
00:42:12.990 --> 00:42:13.000 align:start position:0%
organization who can talk to us about
 
00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:15.560 align:start position:0%
these issues and maybe I can try again
 
00:42:17.309 --> 00:42:17.319 align:start position:0%
to get somebody from the Ethics
 
00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:19.160 align:start position:0%
Committee maybe I'm worried about
 
00:42:21.390 --> 00:42:21.400 align:start position:0%
something that you know maybe I've got
 
00:42:22.990 --> 00:42:23.000 align:start position:0%
something stuck in my craw that I don't
 
00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
need to have stuck in my craw um
 
00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
and I'm willing
 
00:42:32.910 --> 00:42:32.920 align:start position:0%
to uh to be disabused of that of that
 
00:42:36.270 --> 00:42:36.280 align:start position:0%
notion um so I'm wondering about that as
 
00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:38.430 align:start position:0%
notion um so I'm wondering about that as
a

00:42:38.430 --> 00:42:38.440 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:42:40.309 --> 00:42:40.319 align:start position:0%
possibility before you jump in
 
00:42:42.190 --> 00:42:42.200 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn I I guess I I just
 
00:42:43.470 --> 00:42:43.480 align:start position:0%
want to sort of go back to the thought
 
00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:46.200 align:start position:0%
that I just had a minute ago which is to
 
00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
the extent that this can exist legally
 
00:42:51.549 --> 00:42:51.559 align:start position:0%
this situation can exist legally I I'm
 
00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
trying to avoid us getting into the
 
00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
realm of was this a good choice of your
 
00:43:00.589 --> 00:43:00.599 align:start position:0%
corporate structure you know um can I
 
00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
just yes I I I I was I I realized that
 
00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
that's probably on me like whether it
 
00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:07.480 align:start position:0%
was a good like a good choice or not oh
 
00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
no not not so much that sorry I was I I
 
00:43:12.030 --> 00:43:12.040 align:start position:0%
was trying to say I I I'm trying to just
 
00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
avoid that discussion overall I I I I
 
00:43:17.589 --> 00:43:17.599 align:start position:0%
would as well and um yeah like CH
 
00:43:19.589 --> 00:43:19.599 align:start position:0%
choices do have to be made and I would
 
00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
just generally say that they usually
 
00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
have to when it comes to business
 
00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
entities it comes down to a few things
 
00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
it's ownership it's um investment its
 
00:43:32.430 --> 00:43:32.440 align:start position:0%
taxes um and just generally the expense
 
00:43:33.829 --> 00:43:33.839 align:start position:0%
I think a professional Corporation is
 
00:43:35.870 --> 00:43:35.880 align:start position:0%
probably more expensive than a PLC which
 
00:43:39.109 --> 00:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
is why a typical attorney might suggest
 
00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
that um and it's just one of those
 
00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
things that it it's very dependent on on
 
00:43:50.430 --> 00:43:50.440 align:start position:0%
the client so one that's very concerned
 
00:43:53.589 --> 00:43:53.599 align:start position:0%
about those issues and it's it's hard
 
00:43:55.069 --> 00:43:55.079 align:start position:0%
like with a state plan it's hard to
 
00:43:58.990 --> 00:43:59.000 align:start position:0%
think 30 years down the road is this
 
00:44:00.670 --> 00:44:00.680 align:start position:0%
corporate structure going to be
 
00:44:03.069 --> 00:44:03.079 align:start position:0%
important to me when I'm ready to retire
 
00:44:05.190 --> 00:44:05.200 align:start position:0%
and I'm starting to think about what
 
00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen what's going to
 
00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:08.920 align:start position:0%
happen to my employees um what's going
 
00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
to happen to the value of the business
 
00:44:13.349 --> 00:44:13.359 align:start position:0%
when it when like if if I die what's my
 
00:44:15.790 --> 00:44:15.800 align:start position:0%
spouse going to do with it if there's a
 
00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
catastrophic incident and we both die
 
00:44:21.069 --> 00:44:21.079 align:start position:0%
where where does that go those are not
 
00:44:24.670 --> 00:44:24.680 align:start position:0%
things that people naturally think about
 
00:44:27.390 --> 00:44:27.400 align:start position:0%
when they are just starting up their
 
00:44:29.790 --> 00:44:29.800 align:start position:0%
practice and once you start it's really
 
00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
hard to think
 
00:44:36.829 --> 00:44:36.839 align:start position:0%
about changing Midstream yeah sorry so I
 
00:44:39.790 --> 00:44:39.800 align:start position:0%
was going to say is I mean we we don't
 
00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
have to EXA this tomorrow but I think we
 
00:44:45.430 --> 00:44:45.440 align:start position:0%
do have to ex we either do have to
 
00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:47.640 align:start position:0%
execute or interim study it I think by
 
00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:50.800 align:start position:0%
next week because the crossover you know
 
00:44:53.109 --> 00:44:53.119 align:start position:0%
we have to be we have to be done by
 
00:44:55.630 --> 00:44:55.640 align:start position:0%
crossover and we could we could refer it
 
00:44:56.950 --> 00:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
for term
 
00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
study um
 
00:45:04.349 --> 00:45:04.359 align:start position:0%
I I I guess I'm you know the more I've
 
00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:10.430 align:start position:0%
 
it

00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:10.440 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:45:13.069 --> 00:45:13.079 align:start position:0%
I I I really The more I've thought about
 
00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
it I I really think that the way with
 
00:45:16.589 --> 00:45:16.599 align:start position:0%
the amendment the way it's worded is
 
00:45:22.190 --> 00:45:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
mean a non- lawyer can't practice law in
 
00:45:26.829 --> 00:45:26.839 align:start position:0%
fact there's a actually just a crime I
 
00:45:30.790 --> 00:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
mean it's a crime for for so I
 
00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:33.400 align:start position:0%
don't I guess I
 
00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:36.710 align:start position:0%
don't I guess I
don't

00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:39.200 align:start position:0%
see and particularly given the wording
 
00:45:42.109 --> 00:45:42.119 align:start position:0%
of the uh of of the bill I don't see
 
00:45:42.119 --> 00:45:43.230 align:start position:0%
of the uh of of the bill I don't see
that

00:45:43.230 --> 00:45:43.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:45:47.349 --> 00:45:47.359 align:start position:0%
there's a danger of of it suggesting
 
00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
that lawyers that a non- lawyer could
 
00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
practice law I think that the you know
 
00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
that that as I said before before there
 
00:45:59.870 --> 00:45:59.880 align:start position:0%
would if if a solo practice pllc lawyer
 
00:46:01.829 --> 00:46:01.839 align:start position:0%
dies there's not there's going to be a
 
00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:04.480 align:start position:0%
lot of things that the assistant manager
 
00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:06.040 align:start position:0%
can't do
 
00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:09.240 align:start position:0%
but um I think there's I think there
 
00:46:10.990 --> 00:46:11.000 align:start position:0%
probably are a number of things that the
 
00:46:13.630 --> 00:46:13.640 align:start position:0%
assistant manager can do that don't
 
00:46:16.549 --> 00:46:16.559 align:start position:0%
involve the practice of law that um I
 
00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
don't see why we shouldn't allow the you
 
00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
know the law shouldn't sort of
 
00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
specifically state that that can be done
 
00:46:26.349 --> 00:46:26.359 align:start position:0%
both for lawyers and other professionals
 
00:46:28.990 --> 00:46:29.000 align:start position:0%
yeah can I can I throw out a suggestion
 
00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
maybe that's splits the baby if that's a
 
00:46:34.990 --> 00:46:35.000 align:start position:0%
reasonable analogy how about if we and I
 
00:46:36.270 --> 00:46:36.280 align:start position:0%
don't know whether you think this would
 
00:46:40.309 --> 00:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
help uh represent Manos um or me um if
 
00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
we were to draft an amendment that
 
00:46:45.910 --> 00:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
embodied either or both of the two
 
00:46:48.109 --> 00:46:48.119 align:start position:0%
things that I mentioned one is basically
 
00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
adding you know clarifying that it that
 
00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
it does not allow professional judgment
 
00:46:56.470 --> 00:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
or and another one clarifying that
 
00:46:59.829 --> 00:46:59.839 align:start position:0%
you know and and I I I defer to U
 
00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn or others for the
 
00:47:03.950 --> 00:47:03.960 align:start position:0%
language but to say to the extent that
 
00:47:07.630 --> 00:47:07.640 align:start position:0%
it is not in conflict with you
 
00:47:10.910 --> 00:47:10.920 align:start position:0%
know any any law governing the pra the
 
00:47:13.549 --> 00:47:13.559 align:start position:0%
professional practice or or any guidance
 
00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
governing the professional practice
 
00:47:17.069 --> 00:47:17.079 align:start position:0%
something along those lines so that so
 
00:47:18.990 --> 00:47:19.000 align:start position:0%
at least we're basically acknowledging
 
00:47:21.829 --> 00:47:21.839 align:start position:0%
that we have this ethics opinion
 
00:47:24.750 --> 00:47:24.760 align:start position:0%
that after If This Were to go forward so
 
00:47:26.349 --> 00:47:26.359 align:start position:0%
that would have to be Harmon ized in
 
00:47:28.510 --> 00:47:28.520 align:start position:0%
some way sort of like maybe is what's
 
00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:30.400 align:start position:0%
happening right now the the guidance
 
00:47:35.910 --> 00:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
give couldn't you say something like you
 
00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
know um have a last sentence or
 
00:47:42.990 --> 00:47:43.000 align:start position:0%
something that would
 
00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
say um you know this this amendment does
 
00:47:51.710 --> 00:47:51.720 align:start position:0%
not allow a professional does not allow
 
00:47:54.870 --> 00:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
an assistant manager to perform uh any
 
00:47:59.910 --> 00:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
duties that um are of of a professional
 
00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:02.800 align:start position:0%
nature or that would or that would
 
00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:04.910 align:start position:0%
nature or that would or that would
raise

00:48:04.910 --> 00:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
raise
 
00:48:09.309 --> 00:48:09.319 align:start position:0%
um or that or that would uh uh I don't
 
00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
know how you'd phrase that would violate
 
00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
um um ethical standards of the of the
 
00:48:19.510 --> 00:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
practice of the ethical standards of the
 
00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:23.200 align:start position:0%
of the uh profession that is in question
 
00:48:24.589 --> 00:48:24.599 align:start position:0%
something like that I me and ALS and
 
00:48:26.349 --> 00:48:26.359 align:start position:0%
also acknowledge that in the legal
 
00:48:28.589 --> 00:48:28.599 align:start position:0%
profession there's a process that has to
 
00:48:30.589 --> 00:48:30.599 align:start position:0%
be followed and and this doesn't get you
 
00:48:32.829 --> 00:48:32.839 align:start position:0%
around that this doesn't say I'm just
 
00:48:35.710 --> 00:48:35.720 align:start position:0%
going to go forward as a pllc without
 
00:48:37.589 --> 00:48:37.599 align:start position:0%
going before the court and getting a new
 
00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
attorney appointed if that's what the
 
00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
the PC manager decides because it
 
00:48:44.390 --> 00:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't sound like you actually
 
00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily I don't know whether you you
 
00:48:48.829 --> 00:48:48.839 align:start position:0%
necessarily need to appoint someone else
 
00:48:51.230 --> 00:48:51.240 align:start position:0%
to do the legal windown of the practice
 
00:48:53.390 --> 00:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
it sounds like maybe you do based on
 
00:48:55.750 --> 00:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
ethical guidance yeah I that's what I
 
00:48:57.390 --> 00:48:57.400 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that what we say here
 
00:48:59.589 --> 00:48:59.599 align:start position:0%
does not say in any way that that
 
00:49:02.510 --> 00:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't still have to happen um because
 
00:49:04.990 --> 00:49:05.000 align:start position:0%
it it does this sort of just says you
 
00:49:06.789 --> 00:49:06.799 align:start position:0%
know if we can keep the lights on and
 
00:49:08.870 --> 00:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
pay the bills maybe this can wind down
 
00:49:11.670 --> 00:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
in a in a more you know graceful way
 
00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
than you know ENT because that sort of
 
00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
implies that language and that opinion
 
00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
imply implies that um that that the
 
00:49:21.549 --> 00:49:21.559 align:start position:0%
practice sort of is is a dead a dead
 
00:49:24.630 --> 00:49:24.640 align:start position:0%
legal practice when when maybe it could
 
00:49:27.390 --> 00:49:27.400 align:start position:0%
you know find A Better Way Forward if
 
00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
somebody's willing able to be brought in
 
00:49:32.910 --> 00:49:32.920 align:start position:0%
so yeah go ahead representative M thank
 
00:49:35.549 --> 00:49:35.559 align:start position:0%
you um I think I could live with the
 
00:49:38.870 --> 00:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
line of of thought that we're going down
 
00:49:42.150 --> 00:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
I just would want to point out uh to
 
00:49:46.430 --> 00:49:46.440 align:start position:0%
Roger that it doesn't solve his problem
 
00:49:49.109 --> 00:49:49.119 align:start position:0%
because you still then have the need to
 
00:49:51.349 --> 00:49:51.359 align:start position:0%
have a vet who's going to
 
00:49:54.270 --> 00:49:54.280 align:start position:0%
presumably um to do the prescriptions
 
00:49:56.549 --> 00:49:56.559 align:start position:0%
and do whatever surgeries are pending
 
00:49:59.670 --> 00:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
and all of that stuff so you you you
 
00:50:01.829 --> 00:50:01.839 align:start position:0%
would still need to make the arrangement
 
00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
with another
 
00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
professional to step into the shoes and
 
00:50:09.470 --> 00:50:09.480 align:start position:0%
handle all of that but but but it does
 
00:50:10.470 --> 00:50:10.480 align:start position:0%
give the assistant excuse me for
 
00:50:12.069 --> 00:50:12.079 align:start position:0%
interrupting it does give the assistant
 
00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
manager the legal authority to hire a
 
00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:17.160 align:start position:0%
relief veterinarian for example to keep
 
00:50:18.309 --> 00:50:18.319 align:start position:0%
the practice
 
00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
going um or to begin negotiations for um
 
00:50:26.829 --> 00:50:26.839 align:start position:0%
bringing in uh an employee veterinarian
 
00:50:28.789 --> 00:50:28.799 align:start position:0%
who might then be negotiating for the
 
00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:30.640 align:start position:0%
purchase of the practice you know there
 
00:50:31.589 --> 00:50:31.599 align:start position:0%
there there are a bunch of different
 
00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
structures like that what we have today
 
00:50:37.630 --> 00:50:37.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:40.950 --> 00:50:40.960 align:start position:0%
anything and I would say if if if I can
 
00:50:42.789 --> 00:50:42.799 align:start position:0%
if we can work out this language quickly
 
00:50:44.549 --> 00:50:44.559 align:start position:0%
perhaps you could run it by attorney
 
00:50:46.430 --> 00:50:46.440 align:start position:0%
Cunningham and see whether or not that
 
00:50:50.309 --> 00:50:50.319 align:start position:0%
eases his concerns um because it it's
 
00:50:51.950 --> 00:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
tough when someone sort of takes a
 
00:50:53.349 --> 00:50:53.359 align:start position:0%
strong position but is not here in the
 
00:50:56.069 --> 00:50:56.079 align:start position:0%
room for the you know and and i' i' I'd
 
00:50:59.309 --> 00:50:59.319 align:start position:0%
be reluctant to sort of reschedule this
 
00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
for another hearing when we're not
 
00:51:03.190 --> 00:51:03.200 align:start position:0%
really sure that folks would be able to
 
00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
attend so um yeah represent no you know
 
00:51:10.109 --> 00:51:10.119 align:start position:0%
I was the the I think you you raised a
 
00:51:12.309 --> 00:51:12.319 align:start position:0%
really I think important point is that
 
00:51:14.589 --> 00:51:14.599 align:start position:0%
and even in the ethics opinion as I
 
00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
understand it seems to if the if the
 
00:51:22.230 --> 00:51:22.240 align:start position:0%
solo practice that's not a pllc if the
 
00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
lawyer dies they the the
 
00:51:28.270 --> 00:51:28.280 align:start position:0%
the opinion the ethics opinion seems to
 
00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:30.030 align:start position:0%
the opinion the ethics opinion seems to
reflect

00:51:30.030 --> 00:51:30.040 align:start position:0%
reflect
 
00:51:34.270 --> 00:51:34.280 align:start position:0%
that the that that one of the things
 
00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
that a new lawyer would would one of the
 
00:51:38.829 --> 00:51:38.839 align:start position:0%
things that the new lawyer would sort of
 
00:51:41.349 --> 00:51:41.359 align:start position:0%
undertake is
 
00:51:43.950 --> 00:51:43.960 align:start position:0%
um working with the representative of
 
00:51:45.829 --> 00:51:45.839 align:start position:0%
the you know the personal representative
 
00:51:47.789 --> 00:51:47.799 align:start position:0%
maybe the wife or husband or whatever of
 
00:51:50.270 --> 00:51:50.280 align:start position:0%
the of the deceased lawyer in terms of
 
00:51:52.950 --> 00:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
selling the practice and so that that
 
00:51:54.870 --> 00:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
seems to suggest that even though the
 
00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:55.990 align:start position:0%
seems to suggest that even though the
lawyer

00:51:55.990 --> 00:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
lawyer
 
00:51:59.190 --> 00:51:59.200 align:start position:0%
has died and even though it's a solo
 
00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
practice the that practice still has I
 
00:52:04.829 --> 00:52:04.839 align:start position:0%
mean it does continue to exist in some
 
00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
sense it has a value it can be sold and
 
00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:11.160 align:start position:0%
so doing it you know your point about if
 
00:52:13.549 --> 00:52:13.559 align:start position:0%
it's in a if it's in a pllc it makes it
 
00:52:16.470 --> 00:52:16.480 align:start position:0%
much easier to sell it uh because that
 
00:52:18.789 --> 00:52:18.799 align:start position:0%
the corporation lives on so to speak I
 
00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
think that's uh that you know that's a a
 
00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:24.280 align:start position:0%
very valuable reason for having a
 
00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:25.789 align:start position:0%
very valuable reason for having a
pllc

00:52:25.789 --> 00:52:25.799 align:start position:0%
pllc
 
00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
so I I'm good with what you suggest also
 
00:52:32.030 --> 00:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
okay does that sound okay representative
 
00:52:34.910 --> 00:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
Menace yeah yes it does it's it does
 
00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
sound fine to me um I guess the question
 
00:52:40.309 --> 00:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
becomes how we're going
 
00:52:44.710 --> 00:52:44.720 align:start position:0%
to draft the amendment to the amendment
 
00:52:47.670 --> 00:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
um circulate it get all of us to kind of
 
00:52:50.270 --> 00:52:50.280 align:start position:0%
sign off on it and then and then I'll
 
00:52:52.270 --> 00:52:52.280 align:start position:0%
forward it to attorney Cunningham and
 
00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
the Ethics Committee and get them to
 
00:52:57.789 --> 00:52:57.799 align:start position:0%
weigh in yeah so so represent Lynn as
 
00:53:00.990 --> 00:53:01.000 align:start position:0%
our chair chairman sure yeah
 
00:53:03.829 --> 00:53:03.839 align:start position:0%
um is it your understanding that this
 
00:53:06.549 --> 00:53:06.559 align:start position:0%
has to somehow be acted on this week or
 
00:53:08.870 --> 00:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
would we be able to push it back no we
 
00:53:11.510 --> 00:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
can we don't have to execute this week
 
00:53:13.309 --> 00:53:13.319 align:start position:0%
but we do have to execute next week in
 
00:53:14.910 --> 00:53:14.920 align:start position:0%
other words we have to execute by the
 
00:53:18.109 --> 00:53:18.119 align:start position:0%
13th I think it's yeah 13th and so you
 
00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
know if you want I mean there's no
 
00:53:21.430 --> 00:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
reason on the
 
00:53:23.470 --> 00:53:23.480 align:start position:0%
13th I think we'll probably get through
 
00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
most of the bills that we have you know
 
00:53:27.630 --> 00:53:27.640 align:start position:0%
tomorrow so we won't have a lot of bills
 
00:53:29.870 --> 00:53:29.880 align:start position:0%
to deal with on the 13th but if we have
 
00:53:32.870 --> 00:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
this one and maybe one or two others um
 
00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
if you want to have you know if Mr
 
00:53:36.230 --> 00:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
Cunningham or somebody else is available
 
00:53:39.150 --> 00:53:39.160 align:start position:0%
to come that day they can you know they
 
00:53:40.950 --> 00:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
can talk hopefully we'll have given them
 
00:53:42.789 --> 00:53:42.799 align:start position:0%
the language and all that stuff ahead of
 
00:53:44.789 --> 00:53:44.799 align:start position:0%
time we'll have we'll be ready to go but
 
00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
if if uh he wants to come and you know
 
00:53:48.589 --> 00:53:48.599 align:start position:0%
give us his input that would be great he
 
00:53:50.829 --> 00:53:50.839 align:start position:0%
can do that for sure yeah but I think we
 
00:53:52.390 --> 00:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
should have the you know we should have
 
00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
the amendment like ready to go by then
 
00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
yeah that's what I was going to say at
 
00:53:57.430 --> 00:53:57.440 align:start position:0%
least by then we could have worked out
 
00:54:00.549 --> 00:54:00.559 align:start position:0%
some language had it drafted perhaps and
 
00:54:03.150 --> 00:54:03.160 align:start position:0%
then basically if attorney Cunningham or
 
00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
others still have concerns then at least
 
00:54:07.390 --> 00:54:07.400 align:start position:0%
we're talking about sort of something
 
00:54:09.390 --> 00:54:09.400 align:start position:0%
that's already acknowledged most of what
 
00:54:13.109 --> 00:54:13.119 align:start position:0%
they've provided so far so it'll get us
 
00:54:14.430 --> 00:54:14.440 align:start position:0%
down you know I don't I don't want to
 
00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
open up our our exec session into a a
 
00:54:20.950 --> 00:54:20.960 align:start position:0%
you know a hearing right right right
 
00:54:23.870 --> 00:54:23.880 align:start position:0%
exactly does that does that sound a
 
00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
reasonable way I will I'll I'll work on
 
00:54:29.589 --> 00:54:29.599 align:start position:0%
on the amendment with with everybody but
 
00:54:31.789 --> 00:54:31.799 align:start position:0%
I I'm I'm still I still kind of hold
 
00:54:35.109 --> 00:54:35.119 align:start position:0%
those same concerns I had before and I I
 
00:54:38.829 --> 00:54:38.839 align:start position:0%
would would like to hear from from the I
 
00:54:40.829 --> 00:54:40.839 align:start position:0%
I would like to hear in person about the
 
00:54:44.829 --> 00:54:44.839 align:start position:0%
the the ethics opinion um I just does
 
00:54:47.630 --> 00:54:47.640 align:start position:0%
everyone have did you circulate that to
 
00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
everyone email right yeah by email I
 
00:54:51.710 --> 00:54:51.720 align:start position:0%
thought I had it um because I already
 
00:54:53.069 --> 00:54:53.079 align:start position:0%
looked you know what I and I didn't
 
00:54:56.150 --> 00:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
print it you I know
 
00:54:58.150 --> 00:54:58.160 align:start position:0%
I can certainly would you mind sending
 
00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
yeah would you mind because I know I I I
 
00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
know you I remember the email saying
 
00:55:04.789 --> 00:55:04.799 align:start position:0%
that you know it was attached I'm just
 
00:55:07.710 --> 00:55:07.720 align:start position:0%
not sure that I I will send it I I was
 
00:55:10.670 --> 00:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
able to open okay that'd be great and
 
00:55:13.870 --> 00:55:13.880 align:start position:0%
you know representative CH I I I I
 
00:55:16.309 --> 00:55:16.319 align:start position:0%
understand that this probably feels like
 
00:55:17.950 --> 00:55:17.960 align:start position:0%
like it's like it's a little hard-headed
 
00:55:19.710 --> 00:55:19.720 align:start position:0%
but no
 
00:55:22.789 --> 00:55:22.799 align:start position:0%
um and that's you know maybe this is
 
00:55:26.029 --> 00:55:26.039 align:start position:0%
part of the reason why attorneys have
 
00:55:27.950 --> 00:55:27.960 align:start position:0%
reputation that some have
 
00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:37.750 --> 00:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
um these these exists for a reason and
 
00:55:40.349 --> 00:55:40.359 align:start position:0%
without hearing from someone who
 
00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
practices business entity law in New
 
00:55:49.230 --> 00:55:49.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:51.510 --> 00:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
adding what what appears to be
 
00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable I will say it it it is
 
00:55:58.549 --> 00:55:58.559 align:start position:0%
certainly reasonable um and I and I I do
 
00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
I do feel for your
 
00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:01.789 align:start position:0%
I do feel for your
situation

00:56:01.789 --> 00:56:01.799 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:56:04.910 --> 00:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
um it just touches on too many aspects
 
00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
of the law for me um to to sign off
 
00:56:10.109 --> 00:56:10.119 align:start position:0%
completely without hearing from an
 
00:56:13.069 --> 00:56:13.079 align:start position:0%
expert okay I I I will say this was
 
00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
drafted by Rogers business attorney who
 
00:56:20.150 --> 00:56:20.160 align:start position:0%
who put this forward um I didn't you
 
00:56:24.109 --> 00:56:24.119 align:start position:0%
know come up with it uh he's just one um
 
00:56:26.670 --> 00:56:26.680 align:start position:0%
you know obviously L the bar association
 
00:56:29.470 --> 00:56:29.480 align:start position:0%
or anyone else would be would be so are
 
00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
you okay with the path forward that we
 
00:56:33.270 --> 00:56:33.280 align:start position:0%
will draft an amendment that tries to
 
00:56:36.190 --> 00:56:36.200 align:start position:0%
embody what we've talked about and see
 
00:56:38.870 --> 00:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
if we can get that before people who
 
00:56:41.630 --> 00:56:41.640 align:start position:0%
might have a more critical eye yeah yes
 
00:56:44.109 --> 00:56:44.119 align:start position:0%
absolutely okay yeah I I I think we
 
00:56:46.950 --> 00:56:46.960 align:start position:0%
should we should definitely try to do
 
00:56:49.069 --> 00:56:49.079 align:start position:0%
what sounds right and what what seems to
 
00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
be right
 
00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
and I would still like but yes yeah okay
 
00:56:57.230 --> 00:56:57.240 align:start position:0%
great so it's it's 10:00 let me yeah go
 
00:56:59.309 --> 00:56:59.319 align:start position:0%
ahead represent could you could we just
 
00:57:01.789 --> 00:57:01.799 align:start position:0%
restate as a group what our goals are
 
00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
for the amendment to the amendment um we
 
00:57:09.789 --> 00:57:09.799 align:start position:0%
want to have subject to subject to the
 
00:57:12.309 --> 00:57:12.319 align:start position:0%
ethical constraints
 
00:57:15.589 --> 00:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
of are subject to the ethical
 
00:57:15.599 --> 00:57:17.109 align:start position:0%
of are subject to the ethical
guidance

00:57:17.109 --> 00:57:17.119 align:start position:0%
guidance
 
00:57:19.190 --> 00:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
um yeah I don't even know if it needs to
 
00:57:21.069 --> 00:57:21.079 align:start position:0%
be limited to ethical it can be any
 
00:57:24.150 --> 00:57:24.160 align:start position:0%
guidance by the Prof any guidance that
 
00:57:27.390 --> 00:57:27.400 align:start position:0%
you know or or or I don't know what the
 
00:57:29.349 --> 00:57:29.359 align:start position:0%
right word is rules set forth by the
 
00:57:32.910 --> 00:57:32.920 align:start position:0%
profession I don't know Bob if you if
 
00:57:34.870 --> 00:57:34.880 align:start position:0%

sure subject
to

to
 
00:57:40.190 --> 00:57:40.200 align:start position:0%
um maybe this
 
00:57:44.069 --> 00:57:44.079 align:start position:0%
um this author this nothing nothing
 
00:57:48.349 --> 00:57:48.359 align:start position:0%

authorize um an assistant manag how like
 
00:57:55.230 --> 00:57:55.240 align:start position:0%
nothing nothing contained here in shall
 
00:57:56.950 --> 00:57:56.960 align:start position:0%
authorize an assistant
 
00:57:59.829 --> 00:57:59.839 align:start position:0%
manager to
 
00:57:59.839 --> 00:58:01.470 align:start position:0%
manager to
perform

00:58:01.470 --> 00:58:01.480 align:start position:0%
perform
 
00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:04.710 align:start position:0%
perform
any

00:58:04.710 --> 00:58:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:08.789 --> 00:58:08.799 align:start position:0%
U any professional
 
00:58:12.029 --> 00:58:12.039 align:start position:0%
duties um
 
00:58:15.390 --> 00:58:15.400 align:start position:0%
or any duties of a professional nature
 
00:58:20.390 --> 00:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
or that would uh
 
00:58:23.069 --> 00:58:23.079 align:start position:0%
conflict that would conflict in any way
 
00:58:25.870 --> 00:58:25.880 align:start position:0%
with with uh
 
00:58:29.589 --> 00:58:29.599 align:start position:0%
ethical uh standards for the for the
 
00:58:31.190 --> 00:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
profession in question or something like
 
00:58:34.630 --> 00:58:34.640 align:start position:0%
that or or maybe or maybe yeah I guess
 
00:58:36.349 --> 00:58:36.359 align:start position:0%
what I was thinking was the two pieces
 
00:58:38.670 --> 00:58:38.680 align:start position:0%
are one and I'll State these in plain
 
00:58:42.270 --> 00:58:42.280 align:start position:0%
language um one is not allow not allow
 
00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:44.240 align:start position:0%
the assistant manager to perform any
 
00:58:47.029 --> 00:58:47.039 align:start position:0%
professional duties or judgment and then
 
00:58:50.710 --> 00:58:50.720 align:start position:0%
the second one is shall not be you know
 
00:58:55.069 --> 00:58:55.079 align:start position:0%
in conflict or in any way you know maybe
 
00:58:57.230 --> 00:58:57.240 align:start position:0%
obviate is the right word you know the
 
00:59:00.270 --> 00:59:00.280 align:start position:0%
practice from following you know the the
 
00:59:02.029 --> 00:59:02.039 align:start position:0%
the guidance that the profession has set
 
00:59:04.829 --> 00:59:04.839 align:start position:0%
out for for this circumstance or
 
00:59:06.670 --> 00:59:06.680 align:start position:0%
something like that sure sure yeah so
 
00:59:08.710 --> 00:59:08.720 align:start position:0%
it's so it's those two things that says
 
00:59:11.710 --> 00:59:11.720 align:start position:0%
we're not we're not endr running the the
 
00:59:14.230 --> 00:59:14.240 align:start position:0%
the bar association and we're not and
 
00:59:16.829 --> 00:59:16.839 align:start position:0%
we're not end running the
 
00:59:16.839 --> 00:59:18.630 align:start position:0%
we're not end running the
lure

00:59:18.630 --> 00:59:18.640 align:start position:0%
lure
 
00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:21.480 align:start position:0%
um yeah maybe just one more quick
 
00:59:23.190 --> 00:59:23.200 align:start position:0%
question I feel like you may have
 
00:59:25.910 --> 00:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
addressed this is the goal for the
 
00:59:29.390 --> 00:59:29.400 align:start position:0%
business to just continue or is it
 
00:59:31.710 --> 00:59:31.720 align:start position:0%
mainly to get
 
00:59:31.720 --> 00:59:33.870 align:start position:0%
mainly to get
from

00:59:33.870 --> 00:59:33.880 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:59:36.150 --> 00:59:36.160 align:start position:0%
um get to a point where you don't have
 
00:59:38.630 --> 00:59:38.640 align:start position:0%
to essentially send the business through
 
00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:40.920 align:start position:0%
probate to sell
 
00:59:43.589 --> 00:59:43.599 align:start position:0%
it th those things are intertwined yeah
 
00:59:45.150 --> 00:59:45.160 align:start position:0%
so if the business has to go through
 
00:59:47.109 --> 00:59:47.119 align:start position:0%
probate the business is probably not
 
00:59:51.230 --> 00:59:51.240 align:start position:0%
going to be able to continue um if and
 
00:59:52.630 --> 00:59:52.640 align:start position:0%
it's going to be an individual
 
00:59:54.109 --> 00:59:54.119 align:start position:0%
circumstance whether the goal is to
 
00:59:54.119 --> 00:59:55.150 align:start position:0%
circumstance whether the goal is to
continue

00:59:55.150 --> 00:59:55.160 align:start position:0%
continue
 
00:59:57.270 --> 00:59:57.280 align:start position:0%
or to wind it up in an expedition
 
00:59:59.510 --> 00:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
fashion the business may have no value
 
01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
um but if the business has value then
 
01:00:02.789 --> 01:00:02.799 align:start position:0%
the goal is to extract as much of that
 
01:00:05.670 --> 01:00:05.680 align:start position:0%
value as possible and also for the sake
 
01:00:09.270 --> 01:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
of the clients to have continuity which
 
01:00:11.029 --> 01:00:11.039 align:start position:0%
is which is also an extremely important
 
01:00:12.910 --> 01:00:12.920 align:start position:0%
goal so there's a bunch of things that's
 
01:00:15.870 --> 01:00:15.880 align:start position:0%
wrapped up there I just to clarify I
 
01:00:19.470 --> 01:00:19.480 align:start position:0%
suppose I I meant long-term um that
 
01:00:21.270 --> 01:00:21.280 align:start position:0%
would the business continue obviously
 
01:00:22.829 --> 01:00:22.839 align:start position:0%
the business needs to continue in order
 
01:00:25.349 --> 01:00:25.359 align:start position:0%
to wind it up um
 
01:00:27.870 --> 01:00:27.880 align:start position:0%
as opposed to just dissolving on its own
 
01:00:29.870 --> 01:00:29.880 align:start position:0%
um yeah so the goal may be to continue
 
01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
the business as a as a functioning
 
01:00:35.029 --> 01:00:35.039 align:start position:0%
professional entity into the future and
 
01:00:36.150 --> 01:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
there's a bunch of different ways that
 
01:00:39.630 --> 01:00:39.640 align:start position:0%
could happen Okay thank
 
01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
you representative M um I'm wondering if
 
01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:45.390 align:start position:0%
you representative M um I'm wondering if
I

01:00:45.390 --> 01:00:45.400 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:47.069 align:start position:0%
I
can

01:00:47.069 --> 01:00:47.079 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:00:51.069 --> 01:00:51.079 align:start position:0%
um write up the goals that we we just
 
01:00:55.309 --> 01:00:55.319 align:start position:0%
talked about and or you could rep T and
 
01:00:58.470 --> 01:00:58.480 align:start position:0%
send them to OS tell them our goals for
 
01:01:00.670 --> 01:01:00.680 align:start position:0%
what we want to accomplish and then have
 
01:01:02.789 --> 01:01:02.799 align:start position:0%
them draft the appropriate language to
 
01:01:05.549 --> 01:01:05.559 align:start position:0%
add to the amendment yeah I I don't know
 
01:01:07.630 --> 01:01:07.640 align:start position:0%
whether it makes more sense for you to
 
01:01:09.789 --> 01:01:09.799 align:start position:0%
draft rather than draft the goals I
 
01:01:12.109 --> 01:01:12.119 align:start position:0%
think I'd rather see us draft an
 
01:01:13.870 --> 01:01:13.880 align:start position:0%
amendment so we are actually talking
 
01:01:16.109 --> 01:01:16.119 align:start position:0%
about the language that we would think
 
01:01:18.069 --> 01:01:18.079 align:start position:0%
and then basically I'm not sure how we
 
01:01:21.069 --> 01:01:21.079 align:start position:0%
do this without you know being having a
 
01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
91a problem but circulate or or or
 
01:01:26.829 --> 01:01:26.839 align:start position:0%
receive individual input from each
 
01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
person on our subcommittee to um you
 
01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
know to make sure we're all on the same
 
01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:41.230 --> 01:01:41.240 align:start position:0%
no good answer
 
01:01:43.710 --> 01:01:43.720 align:start position:0%
um so does that make does that yeah you
 
01:01:46.470 --> 01:01:46.480 align:start position:0%
know what I I I I I do tend to think it
 
01:01:49.029 --> 01:01:49.039 align:start position:0%
would be better for us to give them the
 
01:01:50.470 --> 01:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
language and maybe they tweak it a
 
01:01:52.910 --> 01:01:52.920 align:start position:0%
little bit but if we if we just sort of
 
01:01:55.630 --> 01:01:55.640 align:start position:0%
send them the ideas I I you know I'm
 
01:01:57.109 --> 01:01:57.119 align:start position:0%
there's a lot it'll take it'll take
 
01:01:59.230 --> 01:01:59.240 align:start position:0%
longer I think to get what to what we
 
01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
really want so all right so so do do you
 
01:02:04.829 --> 01:02:04.839 align:start position:0%
want to start or do you want me to start
 
01:02:08.549 --> 01:02:08.559 align:start position:0%
I'll start okay okay so just mark up the
 
01:02:12.230 --> 01:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
amendment then I guess and will embody
 
01:02:14.510 --> 01:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
because we did we adopt this amendment I
 
01:02:16.150 --> 01:02:16.160 align:start position:0%
can't even remember I don't I don't
 
01:02:17.589 --> 01:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
think we ever I think we did I don't
 
01:02:19.109 --> 01:02:19.119 align:start position:0%
think we did I don't think we so so we
 
01:02:20.829 --> 01:02:20.839 align:start position:0%
will just have to have an amendment that
 
01:02:22.750 --> 01:02:22.760 align:start position:0%
incorporates the new language from the
 
01:02:24.829 --> 01:02:24.839 align:start position:0%
amendment plus whatever we we from
 
01:02:27.029 --> 01:02:27.039 align:start position:0%
today's discussion all right and so for
 
01:02:28.630 --> 01:02:28.640 align:start position:0%
tomorrow I mean the one thing for
 
01:02:31.470 --> 01:02:31.480 align:start position:0%
tomorrow we will just we'll just sort of
 
01:02:32.990 --> 01:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
give the give a report to the full
 
01:02:34.829 --> 01:02:34.839 align:start position:0%
committee on where we stand but we won't
 
01:02:36.069 --> 01:02:36.079 align:start position:0%
we won't we're not going to exec the
 
01:02:38.309 --> 01:02:38.319 align:start position:0%
bill tomorrow perfect okay okay great
 
01:02:39.910 --> 01:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
well thanks everyone for the time this
 
01:02:41.950 --> 01:02:41.960 align:start position:0%
is uh as I said never use the word
 
01:02:43.589 --> 01:02:43.599 align:start position:0%
simple when you start talking about a
 
01:02:46.829 --> 01:02:46.839 align:start position:0%
change to the law so all right well
 
01:02:53.349 --> 01:02:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:53.359 --> 01:02:56.359 align:start position:0%
