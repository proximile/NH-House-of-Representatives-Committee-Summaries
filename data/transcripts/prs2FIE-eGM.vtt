the house election law committee we have
 
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 align:start position:0%
a number of public hearings scheduled
 
00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 align:start position:0%
this morning that begin
 
00:04:19.749 --> 00:04:19.759 align:start position:0%
at 9 30 and i see we have a number of
 
00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 align:start position:0%
people signed up to speak on bills and i
 
00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 align:start position:0%
think we might also have a a clap do we
 
00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 align:start position:0%
well welcome to the greater
 
00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 align:start position:0%
nashua leadership group for this year
 
00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 align:start position:0%
from their chamber welcome to reps hall
 
00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199 align:start position:0%
um this is the oldest
 
00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
the longest standing hall in the country
 
00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:46.639 align:start position:0%
where legislative business is still done
 
00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
and it's my pleasure to welcome you are
 
00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
to where we try to get business done of
 
00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
course with covid the house of
 
00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
representatives is not regularly meeting
 
00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
here but when we do every one of these
 
00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
seats is occupied they are assigned
 
00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
which is a great help because when you
 
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 align:start position:0%
want to try to find another member you
 
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
need to know what seat number they're in
 
00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 align:start position:0%
because believe it or not when all these
 
00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
seats are filled it's pretty hard to see
 
00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 align:start position:0%
who is where and if you look down at
 
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
your arm you will see a number that's on
 
00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 align:start position:0%
the arm there that is the seat number
 
00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
and you are in a particular section and
 
00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919 align:start position:0%
at one of our great benefits for being a
 
00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
legislator here in new hampshire besides
 
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
the 100 a year pay is we can get a
 
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
license plate that we pay for
 
00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:33.199 align:start position:0%
and that license plate will have our
 
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
seat number on it so when you drive
 
00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
around and see
 
00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
a ledgie plate that has some number
 
00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
combination that's what you're looking
 
00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600 align:start position:0%
at is an elected member of the
 
00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
legislature and that is their seat
 
00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.189 align:start position:0%
legislature and that is their seat
number

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:45.199 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080 align:start position:0%
i personally have never put my plate on
 
00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
my chair
 
00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
uh on my car not that i wouldn't be
 
00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 align:start position:0%
proud to but i will tell you it's also a
 
00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 align:start position:0%
very effective way of calling the
 
00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
speaker's office or the president of the
 
00:05:59.830 --> 00:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
senate to complain about somebody's
 
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.510 align:start position:0%
senate to complain about somebody's
driving

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
driving
 
00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
so we hear that a lot in session about
 
00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:05.919 align:start position:0%
seat number whatever maybe you should
 
00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
have been driving a little better one
 
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.390 align:start position:0%
have been driving a little better one
day

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
day
 
00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
um also as we stand here in the hall i
 
00:06:12.309 --> 00:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
want you to take note of the five
 
00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
portraits behind us
 
00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
um a lot of you are here for
 
00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:18.160 align:start position:0%
what you consider to be and we consider
 
00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:19.919 align:start position:0%
to be constitutional business and of
 
00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
course the gentleman on the wall behind
 
00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.120 align:start position:0%
me had a big hand in all of that and one
 
00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:27.039 align:start position:0%
of those portraits was actually
 
00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:29.600 align:start position:0%
partially paid for by pennies
 
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
anybody know who that might have been
 
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
i know one person who does
 
00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.080 align:start position:0%
and what and what particular person
 
00:06:47.189 --> 00:06:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
right so that little trivia fact about a
 
00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
portrait for
 
00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
with pennies paying for it for abraham
 
00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
lincoln along with other facts about
 
00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
what is here in the state house you can
 
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
find out by getting the little
 
00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
self-guided tour book down in our
 
00:07:03.749 --> 00:07:03.759 align:start position:0%
visitor center
 
00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
and it's a great way to spend an
 
00:07:07.589 --> 00:07:07.599 align:start position:0%
afternoon and the state house is of
 
00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
course open
 
00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:11.599 align:start position:0%

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
like to begin our business but before we
 
00:07:15.189 --> 00:07:15.199 align:start position:0%

hb
 
00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:46.240 align:start position:0%
14 1484 fn as introduced
 
00:08:48.389 --> 00:08:48.399 align:start position:0%
i am not a sponsor on the bill um the
 
00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
sponsor i believe will be here shortly
 
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
to give a probably more impassioned
 
00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:53.670 align:start position:0%
to give a probably more impassioned
speech

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
speech
 
00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:56.720 align:start position:0%
this bill allows for a forensic audit of
 
00:08:59.350 --> 00:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
the 2020 election i did speak with the
 
00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this bill when he was
 
00:09:03.269 --> 00:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
drafting it one of the requests that i
 
00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
made that he put in was that it be
 
00:09:07.269 --> 00:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
privately financed
 
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
because the cost of the windham audit
 
00:09:12.389 --> 00:09:12.399 align:start position:0%
was rather extreme and to do a similar
 
00:09:12.399 --> 00:09:13.590 align:start position:0%
was rather extreme and to do a similar
procedure

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
00:09:14.949 --> 00:09:14.959 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:09:16.949 --> 00:09:16.959 align:start position:0%
whole state would obviously cost in the
 
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars
 
00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:21.200 align:start position:0%
as i've stated before in the committee
 
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
i believe that the number one voter
 
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
suppression issue in the state right now
 
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:26.240 align:start position:0%
is the lack of faith people have in our
 
00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
elections and i understand that there
 
00:09:29.829 --> 00:09:29.839 align:start position:0%
are many people here today to speak in
 
00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
favor of the bill who probably share
 
00:09:33.829 --> 00:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
that sentiment and i will let them speak
 
00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
to that at greater length than me with
 
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:37.680 align:start position:0%

00:10:24.069 --> 00:10:24.079 align:start position:0%
of the tabulating and voting machines
 
00:10:26.389 --> 00:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
i received a response from our secretary
 
00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
of state david scanlon the very next day
 
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
this was his response
 
00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
the accu vote operating system used in
 
00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
for 20 plus years
 
00:10:41.829 --> 00:10:41.839 align:start position:0%

election
 
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
we have always recognized that if access
 
00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
to the card
 
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
is not controlled
 
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
it could be tampered with
 
00:10:58.470 --> 00:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
you may be familiar with a documentary
 
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
hacking democracy
 
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
which features harry hirsty conducting a
 
00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
hack of the accu vote memory card
 
00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
we have worked with mr hirsty at
 
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
different levels to make sure our
 
00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
electronic voting systems are secure
 
00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
please let me know if you have any
 
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
additional questions
 
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
this was a clear admission
 
00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
that the memory cards are hackable
 
00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
i voted this email that dave scanlan
 
00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:28.720 align:start position:0%
sent me
 
00:11:30.389 --> 00:11:30.399 align:start position:0%

group
 
00:11:33.269 --> 00:11:33.279 align:start position:0%
i figured they would know what to do
 
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
with this information
 
00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
shortly thereafter
 
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
granite grock published david scanlan's
 
00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:42.920 align:start position:0%
response to me
 
00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
transparency is key
 
00:11:47.829 --> 00:11:47.839 align:start position:0%
it has since been scrubbed from the
 
00:11:47.839 --> 00:11:49.990 align:start position:0%

is the right to know
 
00:12:08.629 --> 00:12:08.639 align:start position:0%
the three questions i posed were how
 
00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:10.240 align:start position:0%
long do you hold on to the voting
 
00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:12.160 align:start position:0%
machine memory cards
 
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:14.240 align:start position:0%
what is the process
 
00:12:15.829 --> 00:12:15.839 align:start position:0%
where were the memory cards from the

2020 election sent to
 
00:12:21.509 --> 00:12:21.519 align:start position:0%
43 towns did not

seven towns
 
00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
still have the memory cards with the

voter data still intact
 
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
nashua responded that i had no right

to my 91 a
 
00:13:10.629 --> 00:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
the majority wrote back that they kept
 
00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
the memory cards
 
00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
until the recall

time frame passes which is usually five

to ten days after an election
 
00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
then the memory cards are sent to lhs
 
00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:26.639 align:start position:0%

those memory cards

on october 8th need i go on
 
00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
the market for election vendors is small
 
00:13:58.870 --> 00:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
and that competition is fierce
 
00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
the result is a small network of
 
00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:04.160 align:start position:0%
companies have near monopolies on
 
00:14:06.069 --> 00:14:06.079 align:start position:0%

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
but these companies are safe keepers
 
00:14:35.189 --> 00:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
of american democracy
 
00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
if we can't have transparency
 
00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
what are they hiding
 
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
and why
 
00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
without transparency
 
00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
trust in our election has evaporated and
 
00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
we realize we have already lost our

we realize we have already lost our
country

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
country
 
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
i'm asking you to help us
 
00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
take back our country
 
00:14:59.350 --> 00:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
and move forward
 
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
for a forensic audit
 
00:15:03.509 --> 00:15:03.519 align:start position:0%
and safeguard our votes because with
 
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
that i have witnessed
 
00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
we have no confidence
 
00:15:10.949 --> 00:15:10.959 align:start position:0%
and the machines should be removed as
 
00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
well thank you for your time thank you
 
00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any thank you
 
00:15:19.269 --> 00:15:19.279 align:start position:0%
um and i i see that
 
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
we just had a written statement just so
 
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
everybody's aware you can go on the
 
00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
website and there is a way to submit
 
00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:28.160 align:start position:0%
a document as to evidence
 
00:15:30.069 --> 00:15:30.079 align:start position:0%
as to your submission as to your
 
00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
testimony or evidence and it becomes a
 
00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:33.839 align:start position:0%
part of the official file
 
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:53.189 --> 00:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:15:54.629 --> 00:15:54.639 align:start position:0%
yeah my name is james wood i live in
 
00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
merrimack new hampshire
 
00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:57.189 align:start position:0%
merrimack new hampshire
um

00:15:57.189 --> 00:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:59.269 --> 00:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
i'll start off as i spent 22 years in
 
00:16:01.269 --> 00:16:01.279 align:start position:0%
the military serving around the world
 
00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
then i followed on with 20 years working
 
00:16:04.949 --> 00:16:04.959 align:start position:0%
for a research development company which
 
00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:06.959 align:start position:0%
explored the government in all different
 
00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
assets so i've seen different places
 
00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
around the world
 
00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
and then i started watching i had just
 
00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:13.910 align:start position:0%
and then i started watching i had just
retired

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
retired
 
00:16:15.829 --> 00:16:15.839 align:start position:0%
and i got a little puppy to have
 
00:16:17.829 --> 00:16:17.839 align:start position:0%
retirement with so i had time on my
 
00:16:20.069 --> 00:16:20.079 align:start position:0%
hands so i started watching every
 
00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
hearing that was held across the country
 
00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
for everything after the 2020 election
 
00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
and i started to notice something was
 
00:16:27.519 --> 00:16:28.710 align:start position:0%
and i started to notice something was
very

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:28.720 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:30.240 align:start position:0%
pretty much problematic about the whole
 
00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:32.720 align:start position:0%
thing is everything would go on
 
00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
and you never saw any of the mainstream
 
00:16:38.069 --> 00:16:38.079 align:start position:0%
media covering any of the hearings
 
00:16:40.629 --> 00:16:40.639 align:start position:0%
so i'd be like watching and observing
 
00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
wondering why that information wasn't
 
00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
getting out to the general public
 
00:16:46.629 --> 00:16:46.639 align:start position:0%
so then i started to notice that there
 
00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
were people filming it and it was put on
 
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
the youtube or other various
 
00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
other sources but it was being deleted
 
00:16:57.749 --> 00:16:57.759 align:start position:0%
immediately after or a day after
 
00:16:59.590 --> 00:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
why would you do that if you weren't
 
00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
trying to hide something
 
00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:04.720 align:start position:0%
for all the things we do in this world
 
00:17:06.789 --> 00:17:06.799 align:start position:0%
i served around the country
 
00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
around the world doing different things
 
00:17:11.189 --> 00:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
for a reason that i thought i was
 
00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
supporting i went in right after vietnam
 
00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
i served with guys who got lied to then
 
00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:19.839 align:start position:0%
and we're lied to now all those years i
 
00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
thought i was doing something in honor
 
00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
of the people that were that went before
 
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
me i see now has gone up in smoke
 
00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
i was on the lawn down in dc
 
00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:32.240 align:start position:0%
on the fifth and i watched what happened
 
00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
i stood with other veterans there was
 
00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
three million of us down there five
 
00:17:37.909 --> 00:17:37.919 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand of us were standing
 
00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:40.240 align:start position:0%
around talking about what's going on and
 
00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
they say exactly what i'm going to tell
 
00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:42.470 align:start position:0%
they say exactly what i'm going to tell
you

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
when the political process breaks down
 
00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
then you're going to have the military
 
00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:48.640 align:start position:0%
option occur
 
00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
and we don't want to see that
 
00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:52.240 align:start position:0%
because any place in the world where you
 
00:17:54.789 --> 00:17:54.799 align:start position:0%
go where that happens you'll see
 
00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
the military doesn't ever fix things we
 
00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
break things that was our job so for
 
00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
everybody in this room know that this
 
00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
election can't be put under the table
 
00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
swept away because we realize there's
 
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
something wrong across this country we
 
00:18:12.549 --> 00:18:12.559 align:start position:0%
can't put our finger on it but we know
 
00:18:13.669 --> 00:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
it's there
 
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
because when things are being taken out
 
00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
from you can't see it you can't find it
 
00:18:19.909 --> 00:18:19.919 align:start position:0%
two minutes after it's talked about
 
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
there's a problem
 
00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:22.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr wood
 
00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:26.720 align:start position:0%
also we don't one of the rules of reps
 
00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
hall is that we don't clap or have any
 
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
um outspoken things some of you were
 
00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
here before and know that uh and part of
 
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
that is can you imagine if there were
 
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
400 people in here and we were doing
 
00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
that that would you know it'd make you
 
00:18:39.909 --> 00:18:39.919 align:start position:0%
know elementary school cafeterias look
 
00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
like a piece of cake so
 
00:18:44.549 --> 00:18:44.559 align:start position:0%
um if you really want to show your
 
00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:46.160 align:start position:0%
pleasure with somebody if you could just
 
00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
do the jazz hands i think that's what we
 
00:18:49.909 --> 00:18:49.919 align:start position:0%
allowed to have happen at the last
 
00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
hearing and i'm seeing some nods yeah i
 
00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
remember correctly so that's what we'll
 
00:18:54.789 --> 00:18:54.799 align:start position:0%
do today
 
00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
good day everybody uh thanks for the
 
00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
time uh you're giving me to talk uh i'm
 
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
actually not technically a new hampshire
 
00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
resident i'm actually from connecticut
 
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
and me and my wife are thinking about
 
00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
relocating here but it really depends on
 
00:19:15.669 --> 00:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
what you're going to do
 
00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
first of all i find it really incredible
 
00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:19.919 align:start position:0%
that we're here asking you to do
 
00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
something for us that we're demanding we
 
00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:24.799 align:start position:0%
want an audit of this 2020 election just
 
00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:26.720 align:start position:0%
let me make it clear some of the other
 
00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
previous speakers kind of stole some of
 
00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
my thunder the bottom line is is that
 
00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
your grandkids your children and any of
 
00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
your family members are going to be
 
00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
living in what you're creating the
 
00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
bottom line is 22 2020 is a fraudulent
 
00:19:45.029 --> 00:19:45.039 align:start position:0%
election there is so much evidence of it
 
00:19:47.669 --> 00:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
it's overwhelming you need to do your
 
00:19:51.669 --> 00:19:51.679 align:start position:0%
job and look for it stop listening to
 
00:19:53.909 --> 00:19:53.919 align:start position:0%
jeff silvestro and all his connections
 
00:19:55.669 --> 00:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
and all those things all anyone has to
 
00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
do is do a little bit of research spend
 
00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
the afternoon and start connecting the
 
00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:01.270 align:start position:0%
the afternoon and start connecting the
dots

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
dots
 
00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
we're telling you this is what we want
 
00:20:05.029 --> 00:20:05.039 align:start position:0%
it's not an option
 
00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
the constitution of new hampshire as
 
00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
well as the united states of america
 
00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
dictates that we have the right to tell
 
00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
you what we want we want an audit
 
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
there's so much evidence it's ridiculous
 
00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
if you don't do it just remember the
 
00:20:19.029 --> 00:20:19.039 align:start position:0%
country that you're going to get is the
 
00:20:21.029 --> 00:20:21.039 align:start position:0%
country that you're helping to create
 
00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
your grandkids everyone of your family
 
00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
will have to live in it the
 
00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
opportunities that you got in this
 
00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
country to be where you are you're
 
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
erasing them for everyone else why
 
00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
are you american
 
00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
are you if you are you'll do the right
 
00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:40.640 align:start position:0%
thing stop making up excuses of why you
 
00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
can't do it or making up subterfuges or
 
00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
obscene the the reality that everybody
 
00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
knows if you're hiding something you're
 
00:20:52.549 --> 00:20:52.559 align:start position:0%
hiding something end of story anybody
 
00:20:54.549 --> 00:20:54.559 align:start position:0%
knows this thank you
 
00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr planka if you could
 
00:20:58.470 --> 00:20:58.480 align:start position:0%
you just said you didn't live here in
 
00:20:59.909 --> 00:20:59.919 align:start position:0%
new hampshire could you correct your
 
00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
the infamous question in election as to
 
00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak on this bill is
 
00:21:34.789 --> 00:21:34.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman and members of
 
00:21:39.029 --> 00:21:39.039 align:start position:0%
committee uh my name's alvin c and i'm
 
00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
speaking on behalf of myself
 
00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately for this bill i think
 
00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
the train has already left the station
 
00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:46.390 align:start position:0%
the train has already left the station
because

00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
mr c can you raise the mic a little bit
 
00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
you're a little hard for us to see just
 
00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
tip it up so it's a little more in front
 
00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
of you thank you
 
00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:54.310 align:start position:0%
of you thank you
the

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunate thing is that the machines
 
00:21:59.190 --> 00:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
have already been reprogrammed
 
00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
city elections had
 
00:22:03.669 --> 00:22:03.679 align:start position:0%
elections last fall
 
00:22:05.909 --> 00:22:05.919 align:start position:0%
town elections were last spring in fact
 
00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
the next town elections will occur
 
00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
before this bill can get through this
 
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
legislature so
 
00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately about the only thing that
 
00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
can be done here is a hand count of
 
00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.149 align:start position:0%
can be done here is a hand count of
ballots

00:22:18.149 --> 00:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
00:22:20.149 --> 00:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
i don't see any way of doing any other
 
00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
forensic tests
 
00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:22:24.789 --> 00:22:24.799 align:start position:0%

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
election reform issued a report that
 
00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
proposed a uniform system of requiring a
 
00:23:13.669 --> 00:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
voter id in order to vote in u.s
 
00:23:13.679 --> 00:23:14.710 align:start position:0%
voter id in order to vote in u.s
elections

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
elections
 
00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
the report also pointed out that
 
00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
widespread absentee votes
 
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
make votes for make vote fraud more
 
00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
likely voter files contain ineligible
 
00:23:27.029 --> 00:23:27.039 align:start position:0%
duplicate fictional and deceased voters
 
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
a fact easily exploited using absentee
 
00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
ballots to commit fraud
 
00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
citizens who vote absentee are more
 
00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:36.320 align:start position:0%
susceptible to pressure and intimidation
 
00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
and vote buying schemes are far easier
 
00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
with citizens vote by mail
 
00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
so for those of you unaware in july of
 
00:23:46.149 --> 00:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
two thousand twenty twenty
 
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
there was an election commission put
 
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.110 align:start position:0%
there was an election commission put
together

00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:23:50.789 --> 00:23:50.799 align:start position:0%
i don't really know exactly what it was
 
00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:53.200 align:start position:0%
called but it was to deal with covid
 
00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
and how we gonna have the elections with
 
00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:56.630 align:start position:0%
and how we gonna have the elections with
covid

00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
covid
 
00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
and it was house bill 1266 which passed
 
00:24:02.789 --> 00:24:02.799 align:start position:0%
this complete senate it was like a two
 
00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
to one vote in the house i'm not sure
 
00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
what that means
 
00:24:07.909 --> 00:24:07.919 align:start position:0%
and it was signed into law by the
 
00:24:09.669 --> 00:24:09.679 align:start position:0%
governor this is all when the state
 
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
house was closed we couldn't come here
 
00:24:14.029 --> 00:24:14.039 align:start position:0%
house bill 12
 
00:24:17.269 --> 00:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
12-66 it was bipartisan and it was
 
00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
temporary changes made to the state
 
00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
voting laws for the upcoming 2020
 
00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
elections only the primary and the
 
00:24:25.669 --> 00:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
general election
 
00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:27.440 align:start position:0%
and guess what it was talking about
 
00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots
 
00:24:31.669 --> 00:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
and we expanded sending out absentee
 
00:24:31.679 --> 00:24:32.710 align:start position:0%
and we expanded sending out absentee
ballots

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:32.720 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
specifically in hampton
 
00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
we actually i received it at my house it
 
00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
came in a brown envelope i never vote
 
00:24:43.029 --> 00:24:43.039 align:start position:0%
absentee i always go to the polls if i'm
 
00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
in florida i come home and i vote
 
00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
and they sent me two absentee ballots in
 
00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
the mail with the now i'm a selectmen in
 
00:24:53.269 --> 00:24:53.279 align:start position:0%
hampton and i knew we didn't send this
 
00:24:53.279 --> 00:24:54.390 align:start position:0%
hampton and i knew we didn't send this
out

00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:54.400 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:56.480 align:start position:0%
and there was a envelope in there with a
 
00:24:58.950 --> 00:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
return address 101 accounted road which
 
00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
is the town clerk's office in hampton so
 
00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
obviously i verify with the town manager
 
00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:05.440 align:start position:0%
and the town clerk that we did not send
 
00:25:06.789 --> 00:25:06.799 align:start position:0%
these out
 
00:25:09.269 --> 00:25:09.279 align:start position:0%
and then later on i find that people in
 
00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
other towns are getting the same thing
 
00:25:14.149 --> 00:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
so you know if someone's elderly and
 
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
just thinks oh you know and doesn't
 
00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
think about it
 
00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
and sends it in my question is
 
00:25:22.789 --> 00:25:22.799 align:start position:0%
if it gets checked off that so and so
 
00:25:25.269 --> 00:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
sent the absentee ballot
 
00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
but they're actually going to vote in
 
00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:28.470 align:start position:0%
but they're actually going to vote in
person

00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
and this has happened they go to vote
 
00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
and they've been told that they've
 
00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
already voted so you're telling me
 
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
there's no fraud in this election
 
00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
and as far as the millions of dollars it
 
00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
will count to do a statewide hand count
 
00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:42.640 align:start position:0%
which is what we will have to do we will
 
00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
need hundreds of people from every town
 
00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
people are going to have to get up go
 
00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
down to the town hall and we're going to
 
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
have to complete it as a body as a
 
00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
community for the whole state
 
00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
we have the money and i know you guys
 
00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
may not know specifically but i have
 
00:25:59.830 --> 00:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
looked at dra financials i have looked
 
00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
at state park financials the money is
 
00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
there it just needs to be reappropriated
 
00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
this does not need to be privately
 
00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
funded this should come from the state
 
00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
government because they are the ones
 
00:26:12.549 --> 00:26:12.559 align:start position:0%
that created the problem
 
00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:14.480 align:start position:0%
that's all i have to say thank you thank
 
00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:17.990 align:start position:0%
that's all i have to say thank you thank
you

00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
question representative prudhomme
 
00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:21.830 align:start position:0%
question representative prudhomme
o'brien

00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
o'brien
 
00:26:23.909 --> 00:26:23.919 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for coming and for
 
00:26:25.269 --> 00:26:25.279 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh these envelopes that you received did
 
00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
you find out if those were ballots or if
 
00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
those were ballot requests they were
 
00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
ballot requests they were absentee
 
00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
requests so you would be
 
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.029 align:start position:0%
requests so you would be
follow-up

00:26:37.029 --> 00:26:37.039 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
follow-up so
 
00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
you would have to yourself request an
 
00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot using those forms that
 
00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
might have come from a private
 
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
organization right but they were at the
 
00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:49.360 align:start position:0%
actual apps they were the same forms
 
00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
that the town clerk had okay so the
 
00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
question is where do they come from and
 
00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
it's still fraud okay thank you
 
00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:26:58.789 --> 00:26:58.799 align:start position:0%

who's calling up his testimony welcome
 
00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
my printer broke so i'm going to rely
 
00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
upon my smartphone here
 
00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
my name is christopher bean and i reside
 
00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
here in concord
 
00:27:29.269 --> 00:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
i'm speaking in support of house bill
 
00:27:29.279 --> 00:27:31.269 align:start position:0%
i'm speaking in support of house bill
1484.

00:27:31.269 --> 00:27:31.279 align:start position:0%
1484.
 
00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
i'm a retired professional civil
 
00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:35.590 align:start position:0%
i'm a retired professional civil
engineer

00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
engineer
 
00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
and i've always taken my responsibility
 
00:27:40.549 --> 00:27:40.559 align:start position:0%
to vote seriously
 
00:27:43.909 --> 00:27:43.919 align:start position:0%
and until the november 2020 election i
 
00:27:45.909 --> 00:27:45.919 align:start position:0%
was confident that our new hampshire
 
00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:48.640 align:start position:0%
elections were accurate
 
00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
live free or die new hampshire
 
00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:53.029 align:start position:0%
live free or die new hampshire
however

00:27:53.029 --> 00:27:53.039 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
based on the hard work of the new
 
00:27:57.430 --> 00:27:57.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire voter integrity group
 
00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:00.240 align:start position:0%
and my own research
 
00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
on serious voting irregularities and
 
00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
fraud that has been discovered in other
 
00:28:05.279 --> 00:28:06.950 align:start position:0%
fraud that has been discovered in other
states

00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
with two-thirds of our state using
 
00:28:11.909 --> 00:28:11.919 align:start position:0%
voting machines associated with
 
00:28:11.919 --> 00:28:13.350 align:start position:0%
voting machines associated with
dominion

00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
dominion
 
00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
i'm now concerned about new hampshire
 
00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
why are many of our election officials
 
00:28:21.909 --> 00:28:21.919 align:start position:0%
unwilling to provide data
 
00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
on the election
 
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
proving it was fair and honest
 
00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
if they have nothing to hide
 
00:28:32.149 --> 00:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
my concerns are that some election
 
00:28:32.159 --> 00:28:33.430 align:start position:0%
my concerns are that some election
machine

00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
machine
 
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
i call them tapes
 
00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
have not been preserved
 
00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:43.029 --> 00:28:43.039 align:start position:0%
what are they hiding
 
00:28:46.149 --> 00:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
potential inflated eligible voting rules
 
00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
have not been kept current and accurate
 
00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
and significantly higher than normal
 
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.590 align:start position:0%
and significantly higher than normal
percentages

00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
percentages
 
00:28:55.029 --> 00:28:55.039 align:start position:0%
of votes
 
00:28:57.990 --> 00:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
were counted compared to eligible votes
 
00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
in certain communities
 
00:29:03.029 --> 00:29:03.039 align:start position:0%
again it's not about the number of votes
 
00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
based on the support you can see and
 
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
have heard from others today
 
00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:14.960 align:start position:0%

hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
 
00:30:19.909 --> 00:30:19.919 align:start position:0%
individuals rally around me
 
00:30:21.669 --> 00:30:21.679 align:start position:0%
some of them have been involved in the
 
00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
political process here in new hampshire
 
00:30:25.669 --> 00:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
for years
 
00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
every day i wake up and i feel like i'm
 
00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
peeling an onion back another layer and
 
00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:35.200 align:start position:0%
it gets stinkier and stinkier as i go
 
00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:37.840 align:start position:0%

more aware
 
00:30:45.669 --> 00:30:45.679 align:start position:0%
and yet distant from the problem we have
 
00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:47.360 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:49.760 align:start position:0%

00:30:54.549 --> 00:30:54.559 align:start position:0%
the chair of the election law committee
 
00:30:56.149 --> 00:30:56.159 align:start position:0%

00:30:56.159 --> 00:30:57.350 align:start position:0%
hand-picked who she wanted on the
committee

00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:30:59.590 --> 00:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
that is a bit of the problem barbara
 
00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
griffin herself does not believe there
 
00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:03.440 align:start position:0%

about voter integrity
 
00:31:38.389 --> 00:31:38.399 align:start position:0%

00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
having us all show up here take time off
 
00:32:38.389 --> 00:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
from work to let us run around like
 
00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
chickens with our heads cut off
 
00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
you knew those memory cards could be
 
00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:45.029 align:start position:0%
you knew those memory cards could be
compromised

00:32:45.029 --> 00:32:45.039 align:start position:0%
compromised
 
00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
and you did nothing
 
00:32:49.509 --> 00:32:49.519 align:start position:0%
each of you took an oath each of you is
 
00:32:49.519 --> 00:32:50.789 align:start position:0%
each of you took an oath each of you is
liable

00:32:50.789 --> 00:32:50.799 align:start position:0%
liable
 
00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:52.640 align:start position:0%
and when we have coveted tests in the
 
00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
liquor store where we're making 12 in
 
00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
the general fund the state has the money
 
00:32:59.430 --> 00:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
to bring back our voter integrity and to
 
00:33:01.669 --> 00:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
do a forensic audit
 
00:33:03.669 --> 00:33:03.679 align:start position:0%
you can either be on the side of freedom
 
00:33:06.789 --> 00:33:06.799 align:start position:0%
or you can be on the side of tyranny
 
00:33:08.549 --> 00:33:08.559 align:start position:0%
you can jump ship and get on the right
 
00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
side of history right now miss grinnell
 
00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
you haven't supported testimony on this
 
00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
bill you continue to go down the wrong
 
00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:17.029 align:start position:0%
bill you continue to go down the wrong
path

00:33:17.029 --> 00:33:17.039 align:start position:0%
path
 
00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
and you'll have to face your maker along
 
00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:20.720 align:start position:0%
with a lot of righteous
 
00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:22.720 align:start position:0%
constituents in this state
 
00:33:27.909 --> 00:33:27.919 align:start position:0%

committee members
 
00:33:54.149 --> 00:33:54.159 align:start position:0%
i also used to believe in our integrity
 
00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
of our elections here in new hampshire
 
00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
and in my town
 
00:33:59.669 --> 00:33:59.679 align:start position:0%
i remember
 
00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
everybody running around in 2015 2016
 
00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:05.440 align:start position:0%
saying there was election fraud
 
00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
it wasn't from the republican side of
 
00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:09.030 align:start position:0%
it wasn't from the republican side of
things

00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
we have had a problem with our elections
 
00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
for years it's it became extremely
 
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
obvious in 2020 however we've all agreed
 
00:34:20.069 --> 00:34:20.079 align:start position:0%
when the republicans are running they
 
00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
say and they don't win they say there's
 
00:34:24.629 --> 00:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
election fraud when the democrats run
 
00:34:26.470 --> 00:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
and they don't win they say there's
 
00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
election fraud the bottom line is there
 
00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
is election fraud the machines are part
 
00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
of the election fraud but there's tons
 
00:34:35.669 --> 00:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
there's so much so i was doing an
 
00:34:37.349 --> 00:34:37.359 align:start position:0%
exercise last night with regards to
 
00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
local government and i found out that
 
00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
more than 50 percent of our local
 
00:34:46.869 --> 00:34:46.879 align:start position:0%
um governments have
 
00:34:48.629 --> 00:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
friends family members or
 
00:34:52.869 --> 00:34:52.879 align:start position:0%
representatives in local positions
 
00:34:56.149 --> 00:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
who vote in those voter machines
 
00:34:58.310 --> 00:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
that's a problem for me
 
00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
okay that's a problem for me the fact
 
00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
that because i
 
00:35:05.589 --> 00:35:05.599 align:start position:0%
recently became involved i found
 
00:35:07.589 --> 00:35:07.599 align:start position:0%
something about
 
00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
a bedford town official about a 2020
 
00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
ballot fiasco running for town moderator
 
00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:15.440 align:start position:0%
running unopposed
 
00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
and he made the comment that he does not
 
00:35:20.069 --> 00:35:20.079 align:start position:0%
work for the people he does not work for
 
00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:22.720 align:start position:0%
the voters this is who our town
 
00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
moderator running unopposed
 
00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
is and part of that is because we are
 
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
being we don't have access to who else
 
00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
is running until after the close of the
 
00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:36.640 align:start position:0%
of uh everyone's throwing their hat in
 
00:35:37.589 --> 00:35:37.599 align:start position:0%
the ring
 
00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
that's when they put it that's when they
 
00:35:41.829 --> 00:35:41.839 align:start position:0%
put it out there and they say okay this
 
00:35:44.069 --> 00:35:44.079 align:start position:0%
is who's running i actually went to my
 
00:35:44.079 --> 00:35:45.270 align:start position:0%
is who's running i actually went to my
town

00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
town
 
00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
clerk on friday at two o'clock asked him
 
00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:50.640 align:start position:0%
if anyone was running unopposed and she
 
00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
assured me that was not the case
 
00:35:57.109 --> 00:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
bottom line is election fraud is a mess
 
00:35:59.750 --> 00:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
if we want to make
 
00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
our if we want to bring back integrity
 
00:36:05.589 --> 00:36:05.599 align:start position:0%
transparency and true
 
00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
belief in our election cycle and our
 
00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire we need to stand
 
00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
up now
 
00:36:17.109 --> 00:36:17.119 align:start position:0%
and and to quote uh to quote um
 
00:36:17.119 --> 00:36:18.630 align:start position:0%
and and to quote uh to quote um
uh

00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:21.440 align:start position:0%
doj folks
 
00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
just because it it's unethical doesn't
 
00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:25.280 align:start position:0%
mean it's against the law
 
00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
that's unacceptable and that was a doj
 
00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:32.240 align:start position:0%
with regards to not election integrity
 
00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:33.030 align:start position:0%
with regards to not election integrity
but

00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
they are included in that as well
 
00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much what i have to say
 
00:36:43.109 --> 00:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
and i'm open for questions
 
00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
anybody have any questions
 
00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
i'm seeing none thank you miss chester
 
00:36:57.670 --> 00:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
i could talk about this for hours so i'm
 
00:37:02.069 --> 00:37:02.079 align:start position:0%
going to piggyback on what teresa
 
00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
grinnell said
 
00:37:05.829 --> 00:37:05.839 align:start position:0%
it's rigged from within
 
00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
so if we want to just talk about 2020
 
00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
it's a trifecta of a steel
 
00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
so in addition to having issues with
 
00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:15.200 align:start position:0%
machines we already know about that with
 
00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
sb 43
 
00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
we know about what took place
 
00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
with windom
 
00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
we also have had a problem in this state
 
00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
for years
 
00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
and that has to do with people showing
 
00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:27.270 align:start position:0%
and that has to do with people showing
up

00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
buses have been reported coming in from
 
00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
out of state same-day registrations
 
00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:34.640 align:start position:0%
don't show an id and they get to vote
 
00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
every single one of those so let's just
 
00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
talk about 2016. maggie hassan never won
 
00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
that's a fact
 
00:37:45.109 --> 00:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
thousands came back under liberal from
 
00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state's office what was
 
00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
done with those people that registered
 
00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
same day
 
00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
they are not
 
00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
domiciled here in new hampshire
 
00:37:57.030 --> 00:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
nothing's done
 
00:37:59.190 --> 00:37:59.200 align:start position:0%
now there's bills that are coming up to
 
00:38:01.589 --> 00:38:01.599 align:start position:0%
you know to put those aside and check
 
00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
them where have we been this has been
 
00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
going on for years sweeney you're
 
00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
this is what happens though you've got
 
00:38:13.349 --> 00:38:13.359 align:start position:0%
someone that is actually now
 
00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
representing chuck morse he has a
 
00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest we we have people
 
00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
that are rigging this from in governor
 
00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
sununu signed two laws 1266 being the
 
00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:26.240 align:start position:0%
most our whole regis our whole general
 
00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:28.480 align:start position:0%
court was not part of that that was like
 
00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
24 people after our state house was shut
 
00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
down that is not representative to open
 
00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
up absentee ballots to prove the steel
 
00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
here what we had in 2020. rye is a
 
00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
perfect example where you knock on
 
00:38:43.589 --> 00:38:43.599 align:start position:0%
someone's door and there are five votes
 
00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
from that house and only two people
 
00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
voted that actually lived there and the
 
00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
three previous people that owned it that
 
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
we need an audit but i know you guys
 
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
aren't going to do anything about it
 
00:38:57.750 --> 00:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
you were in on removing the language
 
00:38:59.750 --> 00:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
there barbara we know what you did in
 
00:39:01.589 --> 00:39:01.599 align:start position:0%
regards with the folds on the ballots
 
00:39:03.349 --> 00:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
you knew it would be a problem you
 
00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:05.200 align:start position:0%
removed the language you removed the
 
00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
language when the rest of the house
 
00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
committee wanted the president's race to
 
00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:11.440 align:start position:0%
be looked at you removed that language
 
00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
we know what you did we have it all on
 
00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:16.240 align:start position:0%
tape we have it all
 
00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
you put the people back in the room lhs
 
00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
is owned by dominion you put them back
 
00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
in the room for the sb-43 audit it was a
 
00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
fake audit that happened but here we are
 
00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
this is not going to change anything
 
00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
this is a wonderful bill we know it
 
00:39:33.349 --> 00:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
won't happen so now the people have to
 
00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
take over that's what she said and
 
00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what has to happen we're
 
00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
on to all of you
 
00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's a given here at this
 
00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
point so i'm really sorry that this is a
 
00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
wonderful bill and i'm sure that most of
 
00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:48.640 align:start position:0%
you won't vote for it there has been
 
00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
problems for years and just so you know
 
00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
governor sununu's father is the one that
 
00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
got the machines here in new hampshire
 
00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
so just so you know that and if you want
 
00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
to go way back when it was bush against
 
00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:02.150 align:start position:0%
to go way back when it was bush against
dole

00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
dole
 
00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
let's talk about that dole had that
 
00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
election in manchester he was leading by
 
00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
nine points nine or ten points when our
 
00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
polls were really good at that point the
 
00:40:14.309 --> 00:40:14.319 align:start position:0%
machines got slipped in right then right
 
00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
and guess what
 
00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
he took
 
00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
he took uh
 
00:40:20.309 --> 00:40:20.319 align:start position:0%
he took manchester
 
00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
it was never gonna happen bush was never
 
00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
gonna take manchester and then what
 
00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
happened oh
 
00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
john sununu papa sununu became what
 
00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
chief of staff under bush
 
00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:32.720 align:start position:0%
it's been rigged for a long time folks
 
00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
wake up
 
00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
recognize representative baxter the
 
00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of the bill and i'm going
 
00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:46.160 align:start position:0%

00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for having me uh members of
 
00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:55.760 align:start position:0%

00:40:56.950 --> 00:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:40:59.190 --> 00:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
1484 i believe i don't have it in front
 
00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
of me is my bill for a full forensic
 
00:41:03.589 --> 00:41:03.599 align:start position:0%
audit of new hampshire's 2020 election
 
00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
results thank you
 
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
let me be clear
 
00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
a majority of this state thinks either
 
00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:12.880 align:start position:0%
the 2016
 
00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
or the 2020 election was stolen
 
00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
the cornerstone of our republic is our
 
00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
democracy and every voter in this in
 
00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
this entire state and really the whole
 
00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:27.190 align:start position:0%
this entire state and really the whole
country

00:41:27.190 --> 00:41:27.200 align:start position:0%
country
 
00:41:29.589 --> 00:41:29.599 align:start position:0%
deserves nothing less than full
 
00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
transparency with our elections
 
00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
this bill would allow every person to
 
00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
know the truth about 2020 and the 2020
 
00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
election results in our state
 
00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
now the main arguments this bill was
 
00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
it's going to cost millions of dollars
 
00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
we can't afford this it's a waste of
 
00:41:51.829 --> 00:41:51.839 align:start position:0%
money so we fixed that
 
00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
this bill is free let me repeat that
 
00:41:58.550 --> 00:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
this bill is free for taxpayers because
 
00:41:59.589 --> 00:41:59.599 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:42:02.069 --> 00:42:02.079 align:start position:0%
the audit is paid for by private
 
00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:05.599 align:start position:0%
individuals and private non-profits
 
00:42:08.309 --> 00:42:08.319 align:start position:0%
there is no legitimate argument to be
 
00:42:08.319 --> 00:42:09.349 align:start position:0%
there is no legitimate argument to be
against

00:42:09.349 --> 00:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
against
 
00:42:11.190 --> 00:42:11.200 align:start position:0%
this forensic audit
 
00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
but you know what
 
00:42:15.349 --> 00:42:15.359 align:start position:0%
after we fixed the cost
 
00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:18.400 align:start position:0%
i started to hear a different argument
 
00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
the argument then became
 
00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:21.510 align:start position:0%
the argument then became
well

00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
we don't want to look forwards or excuse
 
00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
me we don't want to look backwards we
 
00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry if your argument is we don't
 
00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
want a forensic audit because we might
 
00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
not like the outcome that the audit
 
00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:38.720 align:start position:0%
produces that's unacceptable
 
00:42:41.349 --> 00:42:41.359 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter what the outcome is
 
00:42:43.589 --> 00:42:43.599 align:start position:0%
every person in this state deserves to
 
00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
know what happened in 2020 and to have
 
00:42:48.870 --> 00:42:48.880 align:start position:0%
no questions at all
 
00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:52.720 align:start position:0%
all this bill does is provide an avenue
 
00:42:54.870 --> 00:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
for transparency
 
00:42:57.430 --> 00:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
it is a common sense bill
 
00:42:59.589 --> 00:42:59.599 align:start position:0%
and so i urge every single member of
 
00:43:02.069 --> 00:43:02.079 align:start position:0%
this committee to support this bill and
 
00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take any questions at this
 
00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:05.190 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take any questions at this
time

00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:43:07.589 --> 00:43:07.599 align:start position:0%
questions for from committee members
 
00:43:09.589 --> 00:43:09.599 align:start position:0%
representative prudhomme o'brien
 
00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:12.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
00:43:14.069 --> 00:43:14.079 align:start position:0%

00:43:14.079 --> 00:43:15.349 align:start position:0%
coming here with with your testimony
today

00:43:15.349 --> 00:43:15.359 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
did you
 
00:43:18.309 --> 00:43:18.319 align:start position:0%
contact the secretary of state's office
 
00:43:20.069 --> 00:43:20.079 align:start position:0%
with these concerns soon after the
 
00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
election in that period of time when
 
00:43:25.589 --> 00:43:25.599 align:start position:0%
recounts are arranged for in a few days
 
00:43:28.390 --> 00:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
after an election when that and did you
 
00:43:30.150 --> 00:43:30.160 align:start position:0%
and a second part of the question is did
 
00:43:31.829 --> 00:43:31.839 align:start position:0%
you find out anything
 
00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:34.160 align:start position:0%
afterwards that would make you concerned
 
00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
about it that you uh discussed with them
 
00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
well thank you representative for the
 
00:43:41.190 --> 00:43:41.200 align:start position:0%
question this bill first and foremost
 
00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
isn't about my concern it's about the
 
00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
concerns of people in this state and
 
00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
really this whole country
 
00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:48.800 align:start position:0%
and president donald trump has called
 
00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
for an audit in all 50 states and the
 
00:43:54.309 --> 00:43:54.319 align:start position:0%
secretary of the state himself who by
 
00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
the way is not a trump guy which is fine
 
00:43:57.910 --> 00:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
but that's just where he comes down on
 
00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
things he has said that wyndham broke
 
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
the law
 
00:44:04.309 --> 00:44:04.319 align:start position:0%
so we've got a secretary of state that
 
00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
has said towns operating our elections
 
00:44:08.790 --> 00:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
have broke the law
 
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
of course we should have an audit of our
 
00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
election so it's not about what i think
 
00:44:15.910 --> 00:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
or about what i'm doing or that i'm
 
00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
proposing the bill it's about the people
 
00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:20.240 align:start position:0%
of this state and they deserve to know
 
00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:22.720 align:start position:0%
the truth when it comes for 2020. and
 
00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
also i'd say republicans got elected in
 
00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
part to fight for election integrity to
 
00:44:30.630 --> 00:44:30.640 align:start position:0%
make sure every legal vote counts
 
00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
and then people are wondering what are
 
00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:35.200 align:start position:0%
elected republicans actually doing to
 
00:44:37.109 --> 00:44:37.119 align:start position:0%
fight for election integrity in this
 
00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:40.240 align:start position:0%
state this is a common sense free bill
 
00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:42.880 align:start position:0%
for taxpayers way to fight for election
 
00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
integrity and i hope you support it
 
00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:45.750 align:start position:0%
integrity and i hope you support it

a state citizen
 
00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
the cyber integrity that we're looking
 
00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:38.240 align:start position:0%
at with this situation
 
00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
it's a dreamland
 
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
it's all false
 
00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
i went to three or four polling places
 
00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:46.720 align:start position:0%
and spoke with people who put the the
 
00:45:48.309 --> 00:45:48.319 align:start position:0%
machines in
 
00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
and was told that some of them were
 
00:45:53.109 --> 00:45:53.119 align:start position:0%
connected to routers or modems
 
00:45:55.750 --> 00:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
they're not supposed to be connected
 
00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:56.790 align:start position:0%
they're not supposed to be connected
so

00:45:56.790 --> 00:45:56.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:45:59.109 --> 00:45:59.119 align:start position:0%
that really bothers me in the past we've
 
00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
had the last attorney general
 
00:46:03.829 --> 00:46:03.839 align:start position:0%
at the supreme court before he became
 
00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:06.960 align:start position:0%

00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
it's disgusting
 
00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
i understand
 
00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:28.720 align:start position:0%
that there were 134 memory cards erased
 
00:46:30.630 --> 00:46:30.640 align:start position:0%

we're not going to end up having a free
 
00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
country anymore
 
00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:27.910 align:start position:0%
country anymore
so

00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:48:30.790 --> 00:48:30.800 align:start position:0%
and and one last thing
 
00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
we have a third party
 
00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:35.030 align:start position:0%
we have a third party
company

00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
company
 
00:48:37.109 --> 00:48:37.119 align:start position:0%
that is responsible for counting our
 
00:48:37.119 --> 00:48:38.150 align:start position:0%
that is responsible for counting our
votes

00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
votes
 
00:48:40.230 --> 00:48:40.240 align:start position:0%
and responsible for the election
 
00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:41.510 align:start position:0%
and responsible for the election
machines

00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
machines
 
00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:43.030 align:start position:0%
machines
lhs

00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
lhs
 
00:48:46.309 --> 00:48:46.319 align:start position:0%
they are not responsible to any of you
 
00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
or any of us
 
00:48:51.109 --> 00:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
they're a private company
 
00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
that's disgusting
 
00:48:55.109 --> 00:48:55.119 align:start position:0%
we need to go back to paper ballots as
 
00:48:57.750 --> 00:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
soon as this audit is done
 
00:49:01.109 --> 00:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to say please
 
00:49:02.549 --> 00:49:02.559 align:start position:0%
do this audit
 
00:49:06.549 --> 00:49:06.559 align:start position:0%
i'm going to instruct my magistrates
 
00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
to do this audit
 
00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
especially when i find out that it's not
 
00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:12.240 align:start position:0%
coming out of public funds
 
00:49:14.470 --> 00:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
it's being paid for privately
 
00:49:15.589 --> 00:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:16.880 align:start position:0%

00:49:45.829 --> 00:49:45.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:47.200 align:start position:0%
all right it was this committee's
 
00:49:49.349 --> 00:49:49.359 align:start position:0%
responsibility to to ensure an accurate
 
00:49:52.150 --> 00:49:52.160 align:start position:0%
option just to be sure it's marilyn todd
 
00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
oh sorry because people are listening
 
00:49:55.990 --> 00:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah maryland todd nashville new
 
00:49:57.829 --> 00:49:57.839 align:start position:0%
hampshire thank you all right so it was
 
00:49:59.349 --> 00:49:59.359 align:start position:0%
this committee's responsibility to
 
00:50:01.510 --> 00:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
ensure an accurate audit here's the
 
00:50:03.430 --> 00:50:03.440 align:start position:0%
things that went wrong the cameras went
 
00:50:05.430 --> 00:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
out four extra boxes showed up than what
 
00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
wyndham had originally known about or
 
00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
sent out three verified voting auditors
 
00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
one of them passed out didn't even
 
00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:14.720 align:start position:0%
answer our questions and that was one of
 
00:50:16.549 --> 00:50:16.559 align:start position:0%
the ones selected
 
00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
you all knew about foldgate and as an
 
00:50:22.950 --> 00:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
auditor i'm going to speak to you
 
00:50:25.109 --> 00:50:25.119 align:start position:0%
coming from a professional stance you're
 
00:50:26.630 --> 00:50:26.640 align:start position:0%
going to tell me that a paper fold
 
00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:30.640 align:start position:0%
caused four republicans to gain 300
 
00:50:34.069 --> 00:50:34.079 align:start position:0%
around exactly 300
 
00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
votes from the hand count to the machine
 
00:50:38.230 --> 00:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
count and then the leading democrat lost
 
00:50:40.549 --> 00:50:40.559 align:start position:0%
99 those numbers that's why i started
 
00:50:42.309 --> 00:50:42.319 align:start position:0%
this i didn't even know what a house rep
 
00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
was a year ago this month i didn't know
 
00:50:46.069 --> 00:50:46.079 align:start position:0%
what a house rep was i didn't know what
 
00:50:48.790 --> 00:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
a senator was but i knew when i saw that
 
00:50:51.829 --> 00:50:51.839 align:start position:0%
four republicans were shorted 300 votes
 
00:50:51.839 --> 00:50:52.790 align:start position:0%
four republicans were shorted 300 votes
each

00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
each
 
00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
and the leading democrat gain 99 as an
 
00:50:58.150 --> 00:50:58.160 align:start position:0%
auditor that's a problem those are two
 
00:51:01.109 --> 00:51:01.119 align:start position:0%
even numbers and a paper fold is
 
00:51:03.190 --> 00:51:03.200 align:start position:0%
it's just too crazy it's too it doesn't
 
00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
make sense for a paper fold to do that
 
00:51:08.549 --> 00:51:08.559 align:start position:0%
i also want to say that you know we have
 
00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
on live video
 
00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:11.680 align:start position:0%
that harry hirsty deleted our memory
 
00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
cards every i have evidence
 
00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
of three elections
 
00:51:20.309 --> 00:51:20.319 align:start position:0%
all with the same exact uh memory cards
 
00:51:22.230 --> 00:51:22.240 align:start position:0%
three elections have been wiped so far
 
00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:23.750 align:start position:0%
three elections have been wiped so far
three

00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:51:25.109 --> 00:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire has broken
 
00:51:27.829 --> 00:51:27.839 align:start position:0%
the law three different times we have we
 
00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
have attorneys coming into new hampshire
 
00:51:31.589 --> 00:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
we have documentaries being made we have
 
00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
evidence of this all
 
00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:35.200 align:start position:0%
so do the right thing because no matter
 
00:51:37.829 --> 00:51:37.839 align:start position:0%
what this is all going to be exposed and
 
00:51:40.390 --> 00:51:40.400 align:start position:0%
it's going to keep being exposed and i'm
 
00:51:42.390 --> 00:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
not none of us here are going to stop
 
00:51:44.790 --> 00:51:44.800 align:start position:0%
until it's done and it's 9 30 in the
 
00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
morning and that's why this whole house
 
00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
isn't full because when i tell you we
 
00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
have a lot of support when i started
 
00:51:52.309 --> 00:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
this group a year ago
 
00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
it was embarrassing to talk about
 
00:51:55.990 --> 00:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
election fraud i'm telling you right now
 
00:51:57.589 --> 00:51:57.599 align:start position:0%
i will scream it from the mountaintops
 
00:51:59.670 --> 00:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
and so will everybody else in this room
 
00:52:01.990 --> 00:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
we deserve a free audit we just we
 
00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
deserve a free and fair audit my son
 
00:52:07.990 --> 00:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
deserves to vote if he wants to vote and
 
00:52:09.990 --> 00:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
know that his vote counts
 
00:52:12.549 --> 00:52:12.559 align:start position:0%
our i told you guys when i first started
 
00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
this last year don't make us choose our
 
00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
children's future don't make us pick our
 
00:52:20.069 --> 00:52:20.079 align:start position:0%
children's future because they're always
 
00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:21.440 align:start position:0%
going to win
 
00:52:23.670 --> 00:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
and we deserve this and you guys have
 
00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
made way too many mistakes allowing lhs
 
00:52:29.109 --> 00:52:29.119 align:start position:0%
like i said to you guys in the last
 
00:52:29.119 --> 00:52:30.309 align:start position:0%
like i said to you guys in the last
meeting

00:52:30.309 --> 00:52:30.319 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:52:33.109 --> 00:52:33.119 align:start position:0%
as an auditor as a forensic auditor that
 
00:52:37.349 --> 00:52:37.359 align:start position:0%
is my job title if i ever gave the irs
 
00:52:38.710 --> 00:52:38.720 align:start position:0%
of my
 
00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
directions on my client on how to audit
 
00:52:43.109 --> 00:52:43.119 align:start position:0%
them from my client
 
00:52:45.349 --> 00:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
we would all go to jail we would all go
 
00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
to jail if i erased my client's pos
 
00:52:51.109 --> 00:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
system i would go to jail
 
00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
i am an auditor too and i know how this
 
00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
works and like i said last time the
 
00:52:57.430 --> 00:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
whole audit was based on just because
 
00:52:59.190 --> 00:52:59.200 align:start position:0%
it's unethical doesn't make it a
 
00:53:01.670 --> 00:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
criminal violation they knew it was
 
00:53:04.470 --> 00:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
unethical harry hirsty you guys spent
 
00:53:07.030 --> 00:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
3.1 million dollars
 
00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:07.870 align:start position:0%
3.1 million dollars
in

00:53:07.870 --> 00:53:07.880 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:53:10.549 --> 00:53:10.559 align:start position:0%
2016-2017 somewhere around there harry
 
00:53:10.559 --> 00:53:12.069 align:start position:0%
2016-2017 somewhere around there harry
hirsty

00:53:12.069 --> 00:53:12.079 align:start position:0%
hirsty
 
00:53:15.270 --> 00:53:15.280 align:start position:0%
literally was paid over a quarter of a
 
00:53:17.270 --> 00:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
million of that
 
00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:18.720 align:start position:0%
already he's already been in our
 
00:53:19.829 --> 00:53:19.839 align:start position:0%
machines for
 
00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
for election security
 
00:53:23.670 --> 00:53:23.680 align:start position:0%
why are we having people that have
 
00:53:25.990 --> 00:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
already been in our machines audit i
 
00:53:27.670 --> 00:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
would be i would go to jail for that as
 
00:53:30.390 --> 00:53:30.400 align:start position:0%
well i would go to jail if if i did your
 
00:53:32.790 --> 00:53:32.800 align:start position:0%
bookkeeping and i did your audit i would
 
00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
go to jail
 
00:53:37.109 --> 00:53:37.119 align:start position:0%
so why with our most sacred right are we
 
00:53:38.950 --> 00:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
not protecting it more than money how
 
00:53:40.710 --> 00:53:40.720 align:start position:0%
does that make sense
 
00:53:42.549 --> 00:53:42.559 align:start position:0%
and i'm not going to stop and none of us
 
00:53:43.510 --> 00:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
are going to stop and we're going to
 
00:53:45.670 --> 00:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
keep waking people up and that's what
 
00:53:46.870 --> 00:53:46.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to do because i'm telling
 
00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
you right now we have a full team coming
 
00:53:50.710 --> 00:53:50.720 align:start position:0%

going to get bigger and bigger and
 
00:53:56.470 --> 00:53:56.480 align:start position:0%
bigger and you guys can either join us
 
00:53:57.990 --> 00:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
and show that you that this isn't
 
00:54:01.829 --> 00:54:01.839 align:start position:0%
because of you or you can um or or you

mean we've already proved that we can do
 
00:54:08.549 --> 00:54:08.559 align:start position:0%
this we've already proved that if if
 
00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
someone doesn't do what they're supposed
 
00:54:11.829 --> 00:54:11.839 align:start position:0%
to do we will vote them out and we will
 
00:54:14.309 --> 00:54:14.319 align:start position:0%

um
 
00:59:14.710 --> 00:59:14.720 align:start position:0%
the great thing about new hampshire
 
00:59:18.789 --> 00:59:18.799 align:start position:0%
elections are that they're decentralized
 
00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
and that we rely on thousands of locally
 
00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
elected officials to conduct our
 
00:59:27.510 --> 00:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
elections it's a very very human process
 
00:59:29.829 --> 00:59:29.839 align:start position:0%
and there are individual failures that
 
00:59:31.349 --> 00:59:31.359 align:start position:0%
take place and
 
00:59:33.190 --> 00:59:33.200 align:start position:0%
we see that in windham and we see that
 
00:59:35.190 --> 00:59:35.200 align:start position:0%
in bedford those have been very public
 
00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:36.950 align:start position:0%
in bedford those have been very public
examples

00:59:36.950 --> 00:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
examples
 
00:59:39.190 --> 00:59:39.200 align:start position:0%
the system is not perfect there are
 
00:59:40.950 --> 00:59:40.960 align:start position:0%
mistakes that are made
 
00:59:42.950 --> 00:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
and when they are people are held
 
00:59:42.960 --> 00:59:44.950 align:start position:0%
and when they are people are held
accountable

00:59:44.950 --> 00:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
accountable
 
00:59:46.390 --> 00:59:46.400 align:start position:0%
but that failure
 
00:59:47.990 --> 00:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
at an individual level does not
 
00:59:50.069 --> 00:59:50.079 align:start position:0%
translate into some type of a major
 
00:59:50.079 --> 00:59:51.829 align:start position:0%
translate into some type of a major
conspiracy

00:59:51.829 --> 00:59:51.839 align:start position:0%
conspiracy
 
00:59:51.839 --> 00:59:53.030 align:start position:0%
conspiracy
um

00:59:53.030 --> 00:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:53.910 align:start position:0%
um

00:59:53.910 --> 00:59:53.920 align:start position:0%

in the way new hampshire runs its
 
01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:04.630 align:start position:0%
in the way new hampshire runs its

01:00:09.589 --> 01:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
they they reflect who should be placed
 
01:00:12.390 --> 01:00:12.400 align:start position:0%

01:00:49.270 --> 01:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
the point is that because we're
 
01:00:53.430 --> 01:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
decentralized and we have all of those
 
01:00:55.910 --> 01:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
volunteers average people
 
01:00:57.510 --> 01:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire
 
01:00:58.950 --> 01:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
all citizens
 
01:01:01.030 --> 01:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
all dedicated
 
01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:03.920 align:start position:0%
and i believe they all have integrity
 
01:01:06.150 --> 01:01:06.160 align:start position:0%
would know if there was something
 
01:01:07.270 --> 01:01:07.280 align:start position:0%
going on
 
01:01:08.789 --> 01:01:08.799 align:start position:0%
with our elections
 
01:01:11.109 --> 01:01:11.119 align:start position:0%
in in the form of some type of
 
01:01:13.510 --> 01:01:13.520 align:start position:0%
conspiracy they would be here at a
 
01:01:15.109 --> 01:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
meeting like this if that's what they
 
01:01:15.119 --> 01:01:16.230 align:start position:0%
meeting like this if that's what they
believed

01:01:16.230 --> 01:01:16.240 align:start position:0%
believed
 
01:01:17.990 --> 01:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
but they're not
 
01:01:19.750 --> 01:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
and i think if you reach out and talk to
 
01:01:21.910 --> 01:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
those local election officials
 
01:01:24.150 --> 01:01:24.160 align:start position:0%
they also would express the confidence
 
01:01:27.190 --> 01:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
that they have in that process
 
01:01:28.710 --> 01:01:28.720 align:start position:0%
now are there ways that we can be more
 
01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:29.990 align:start position:0%
now are there ways that we can be more
transparent

01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
transparent
 
01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:32.240 align:start position:0%
certainly and i think we have major
 
01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
training issues that we have to deal
 
01:01:36.309 --> 01:01:36.319 align:start position:0%
with with local election officials we
 
01:01:39.109 --> 01:01:39.119 align:start position:0%
have to do a better job
 
01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:40.640 align:start position:0%
communicating with the general public
 
01:01:42.230 --> 01:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
and the voters so that they understand
 
01:01:44.470 --> 01:01:44.480 align:start position:0%
what that process is
 
01:01:46.230 --> 01:01:46.240 align:start position:0%
and all of the checks and balances that
 
01:01:47.430 --> 01:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
are in place
 
01:01:49.430 --> 01:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
to make sure that our elections are
 
01:01:51.510 --> 01:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
accurate and fair
 
01:01:53.910 --> 01:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of this particular bill
 
01:01:57.029 --> 01:01:57.039 align:start position:0%
calling for a statewide audit
 
01:01:59.109 --> 01:01:59.119 align:start position:0%
at a time when we are gearing up for the
 
01:02:02.230 --> 01:02:02.240 align:start position:0%
2022 election cycle
 
01:02:05.029 --> 01:02:05.039 align:start position:0%
would be incredibly difficult to do
 
01:02:06.230 --> 01:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
we'd have the
 
01:02:08.549 --> 01:02:08.559 align:start position:0%
you know the the managing the ballots
 
01:02:11.029 --> 01:02:11.039 align:start position:0%
from the last election uh being
 
01:02:13.910 --> 01:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
you know to participate in an audit
 
01:02:15.270 --> 01:02:15.280 align:start position:0%
while we're trying to get everything
 
01:02:18.150 --> 01:02:18.160 align:start position:0%
ready for the 2022 election
 
01:02:19.589 --> 01:02:19.599 align:start position:0%
frankly i haven't heard anything here
 
01:02:21.990 --> 01:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
today in the form of evidence that shows
 
01:02:23.589 --> 01:02:23.599 align:start position:0%
that there was something
 
01:02:25.109 --> 01:02:25.119 align:start position:0%
wrong uh
 
01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
on a larger scale that we really need to
 
01:02:29.270 --> 01:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
look into so
 
01:02:32.069 --> 01:02:32.079 align:start position:0%
again i can only express my faith
 
01:02:35.589 --> 01:02:35.599 align:start position:0%
in our election process uh
 
01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:37.920 align:start position:0%

transparent then then
 
01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:04.240 align:start position:0%

01:05:16.630 --> 01:05:16.640 align:start position:0%
and be well served if a more complete
 
01:05:18.150 --> 01:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
forensic audit
 
01:05:21.270 --> 01:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
of our election process was conducted
 
01:05:23.270 --> 01:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
we recommend utilizing ballots from the
 
01:05:25.270 --> 01:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
last general election
 
01:05:27.190 --> 01:05:27.200 align:start position:0%
because those are only ballots that we
 
01:05:29.349 --> 01:05:29.359 align:start position:0%
can look at
 
01:05:31.750 --> 01:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
the cards are wiped out after 22
 
01:05:33.029 --> 01:05:33.039 align:start position:0%
months so
 
01:05:34.069 --> 01:05:34.079 align:start position:0%
if we don't
 
01:05:36.549 --> 01:05:36.559 align:start position:0%
the from prior elections those those
 
01:05:38.309 --> 01:05:38.319 align:start position:0%
ballots don't exist
 
01:05:39.829 --> 01:05:39.839 align:start position:0%
those cards don't exist from the
 
01:05:39.839 --> 01:05:40.870 align:start position:0%
those cards don't exist from the
machines

01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
machines
 
01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
it is clear that this audit can raise
 
01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
what is currently very low voter
 
01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:46.470 align:start position:0%
what is currently very low voter
confidence

01:05:46.470 --> 01:05:46.480 align:start position:0%
confidence
 
01:05:47.829 --> 01:05:47.839 align:start position:0%
you will hear
 
01:05:50.069 --> 01:05:50.079 align:start position:0%
in in testimony from others why this
 
01:05:51.990 --> 01:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
bill is very focused
 
01:05:54.150 --> 01:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
with the detailed methodology laid out
 
01:05:56.470 --> 01:05:56.480 align:start position:0%
in the language of the bill
 
01:05:58.470 --> 01:05:58.480 align:start position:0%
it is up to us
 
01:06:00.630 --> 01:06:00.640 align:start position:0%
as legislators to hear the voices of the
 
01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:01.670 align:start position:0%
as legislators to hear the voices of the
people

01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:06:04.069 --> 01:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
we in new hampshire have never had this
 
01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
type of thorough audit
 
01:06:08.870 --> 01:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
of our election process done
 
01:06:10.390 --> 01:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
it is probably
 
01:06:12.470 --> 01:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
long time overdue
 
01:06:16.390 --> 01:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
the purpose of of house bill 1473
 
01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
is to use a single county and we chose
 
01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:20.390 align:start position:0%
is to use a single county and we chose
merrimack

01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
merrimack
 
01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:21.109 align:start position:0%
merrimack
not

01:06:21.109 --> 01:06:21.119 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:06:22.470 --> 01:06:22.480 align:start position:0%
there anything special about merrimack
 
01:06:24.630 --> 01:06:24.640 align:start position:0%
but it's a medium-sized county pretty
 
01:06:27.510 --> 01:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
much that's why we picked merrimack
 
01:06:29.029 --> 01:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
to be audited
 
01:06:31.029 --> 01:06:31.039 align:start position:0%
the audit would be limited to
 
01:06:32.870 --> 01:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
presidential gubernatorial and u.s
 
01:06:36.069 --> 01:06:36.079 align:start position:0%
senate race races to be utilized as the
 
01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
test races
 
01:06:40.549 --> 01:06:40.559 align:start position:0%
the audit will be conducted within
 
01:06:42.870 --> 01:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
with a
 
01:06:45.190 --> 01:06:45.200 align:start position:0%
impartial never-before-use third party
 
01:06:47.589 --> 01:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
who can provide an evaluation of the new
 
01:06:50.549 --> 01:06:50.559 align:start position:0%
hampshire process and tools
 
01:06:52.230 --> 01:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
should there be a large enough gap in
 
01:06:55.109 --> 01:06:55.119 align:start position:0%
the audit results in merrimack
 
01:06:57.109 --> 01:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
the balance of the state would be
 
01:06:57.119 --> 01:06:58.870 align:start position:0%
the balance of the state would be
audited

01:06:58.870 --> 01:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
audited
 
01:07:01.109 --> 01:07:01.119 align:start position:0%
what makes the audit approach prescribed
 
01:07:02.789 --> 01:07:02.799 align:start position:0%
in this bill unique
 
01:07:05.349 --> 01:07:05.359 align:start position:0%
is that it will not include stakeholders
 
01:07:06.870 --> 01:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
just like audits
 
01:07:09.109 --> 01:07:09.119 align:start position:0%
conducted by cpa firms for publicly
 
01:07:12.390 --> 01:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:14.549 --> 01:07:14.559 align:start position:0%
that do
 
01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
this not only is best practice but it
 
01:07:19.029 --> 01:07:19.039 align:start position:0%
removes any potential concerns that the
 
01:07:21.270 --> 01:07:21.280 align:start position:0%
audit was biased in any way
 
01:07:22.950 --> 01:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
the audit will be
 
01:07:25.190 --> 01:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
visible to the public with the aid of
 
01:07:28.069 --> 01:07:28.079 align:start position:0%
volunteers from both parties
 
01:07:30.150 --> 01:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
the audit team will document and
 
01:07:32.630 --> 01:07:32.640 align:start position:0%
identify process gaps detail areas of
 
01:07:34.390 --> 01:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
vulnerability and report on
 
01:07:37.190 --> 01:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
inconsistency and election results
 
01:07:39.190 --> 01:07:39.200 align:start position:0%
they will make recommendations on their
 
01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:40.390 align:start position:0%
they will make recommendations on their
findings

01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
findings
 
01:07:44.069 --> 01:07:44.079 align:start position:0%
to to be acted upon by this legislature
 
01:07:45.430 --> 01:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
again the intent
 
01:07:47.990 --> 01:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
of the effort is to improve election
 
01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.069 align:start position:0%
of the effort is to improve election
processes

01:07:50.069 --> 01:07:50.079 align:start position:0%
processes
 
01:07:52.150 --> 01:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
as needed
 
01:07:54.390 --> 01:07:54.400 align:start position:0%
we're not doing any for
 
01:07:55.829 --> 01:07:55.839 align:start position:0%
gone conclusions
 
01:07:57.510 --> 01:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
if we're we're doing an audit just to
 
01:07:59.510 --> 01:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
see like any other company would like a
 
01:08:00.710 --> 01:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
company would do
 
01:08:02.390 --> 01:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
to see if there's any improvements that
 
01:08:04.309 --> 01:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
could could help us out
 
01:08:06.710 --> 01:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
this bill in no way attempts to change
 
01:08:08.470 --> 01:08:08.480 align:start position:0%
the 2020
 
01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
election results this is a
 
01:08:12.710 --> 01:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
forward-looking bill designed to boost
 
01:08:14.789 --> 01:08:14.799 align:start position:0%
voter confidence
 
01:08:17.669 --> 01:08:17.679 align:start position:0%
you have all heard much testimony from
 
01:08:23.669 --> 01:08:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:23.679 --> 01:08:24.390 align:start position:0%
 
on

01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:08:27.510 --> 01:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
and why an audit is needed you will hear
 
01:08:29.910 --> 01:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
continued testimony on why i'm sure
 
01:08:32.309 --> 01:08:32.319 align:start position:0%
however you will also hear testimony on
 
01:08:35.110 --> 01:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
independent citizen audit efforts
 
01:08:37.990 --> 01:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
that have been conducted
 
01:08:39.990 --> 01:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
i will once again leave it to
 
01:08:41.669 --> 01:08:41.679 align:start position:0%
brenda town
 
01:08:43.749 --> 01:08:43.759 align:start position:0%
for whom i filed this bill for
 
01:08:45.990 --> 01:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
to walk you through the specifics of the
 
01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.269 align:start position:0%
to walk you through the specifics of the
bill

01:08:47.269 --> 01:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:08:49.990 --> 01:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
however my contribution to the bill
 
01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
was my suggestion to set up an election
 
01:08:54.309 --> 01:08:54.319 align:start position:0%
audit fund
 
01:08:57.189 --> 01:08:57.199 align:start position:0%
which is section 10 of the bill which is
 
01:09:00.630 --> 01:09:00.640 align:start position:0%
on page 3 lines 14 to 23.
 
01:09:03.590 --> 01:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
those who supported the audit
 
01:09:05.829 --> 01:09:05.839 align:start position:0%
idea suggested that gifts grants and
 
01:09:07.749 --> 01:09:07.759 align:start position:0%
donations can be raised to help pay for
 
01:09:08.789 --> 01:09:08.799 align:start position:0%
the audit
 
01:09:10.149 --> 01:09:10.159 align:start position:0%
being a member of the ways and means
 
01:09:11.829 --> 01:09:11.839 align:start position:0%
committee i was aware
 
01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
that there is a way to properly have the
 
01:09:16.709 --> 01:09:16.719 align:start position:0%
state accept private money the language
 
01:09:18.229 --> 01:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
of this section is what is generally
 
01:09:20.470 --> 01:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
utilized the key language and i'll quote
 
01:09:22.470 --> 01:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
it says there is established in the
 
01:09:24.709 --> 01:09:24.719 align:start position:0%
state treasury an election audit fund
 
01:09:26.149 --> 01:09:26.159 align:start position:0%
which shall be administered by the
 
01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
secretary of state
 
01:09:30.630 --> 01:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
if this was an agricultural fund
 
01:09:32.390 --> 01:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
it would say which should be
 
01:09:34.149 --> 01:09:34.159 align:start position:0%
administered by the commissioner of
 
01:09:36.149 --> 01:09:36.159 align:start position:0%
agriculture so this
 
01:09:37.349 --> 01:09:37.359 align:start position:0%
the reason the secretary of state's
 
01:09:39.430 --> 01:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
involved because this is election uh
 
01:09:40.709 --> 01:09:40.719 align:start position:0%
election bill
 
01:09:42.709 --> 01:09:42.719 align:start position:0%
uh election fund
 
01:09:44.470 --> 01:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
the bill does does ask for an
 
01:09:48.149 --> 01:09:48.159 align:start position:0%
appropriation though of 150 000 to seed
 
01:09:50.470 --> 01:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
the fund which i am sure the finance
 
01:09:52.390 --> 01:09:52.400 align:start position:0%
committee will weigh in on if this bill
 
01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:53.910 align:start position:0%
committee will weigh in on if this bill
passes

01:09:53.910 --> 01:09:53.920 align:start position:0%

once again i must return to my ways and
 
01:10:02.390 --> 01:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
means committee
 
01:10:03.990 --> 01:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
where we're
 
01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:05.920 align:start position:0%

01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:07.669 align:start position:0%
we're doing work sessions and executing
bills

01:10:07.669 --> 01:10:07.679 align:start position:0%
bills
 
01:10:10.630 --> 01:10:10.640 align:start position:0%
so i will uh i will
 
01:10:13.270 --> 01:10:13.280 align:start position:0%
so please if you can allow miss uh town
 
01:10:15.270 --> 01:10:15.280 align:start position:0%

01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:17.110 align:start position:0%
to alert us to answer your your

01:10:22.790 --> 01:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
however i will take any questions that
 
01:10:24.229 --> 01:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
relate to the the fund that we're
 
01:10:26.070 --> 01:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
talking about because that's an area i'm
 
01:10:27.750 --> 01:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
very familiar with
 
01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any questions
 
01:10:32.630 --> 01:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
representative terozian
 
01:10:34.390 --> 01:10:34.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you the
 
01:10:36.310 --> 01:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
member for taking my question
 
01:10:38.149 --> 01:10:38.159 align:start position:0%
so in that section you just referenced
 
01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
you you show us some of 150 000
 
01:10:42.709 --> 01:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
do you think this audit can be done for
 
01:10:44.630 --> 01:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
that or is that just a down payment on
 
01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:45.510 align:start position:0%
that or is that just a down payment on
it

01:10:45.510 --> 01:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:10:48.470 --> 01:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
that that will pay for a part of it
 
01:10:50.070 --> 01:10:50.080 align:start position:0%
i think that's why we're we're creating
 
01:10:52.229 --> 01:10:52.239 align:start position:0%
the fund for other donations
 
01:10:52.239 --> 01:10:54.070 align:start position:0%
the fund for other donations
so

01:10:54.070 --> 01:10:54.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:10:55.110 --> 01:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
do you have an estimate of what you
 
01:10:57.590 --> 01:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
think it would cost to do this i don't
 
01:10:58.630 --> 01:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
01:10:58.640 --> 01:10:59.669 align:start position:0%
i don't
perhaps

01:10:59.669 --> 01:10:59.679 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
01:11:01.189 --> 01:11:01.199 align:start position:0%
this town does
 
01:11:02.950 --> 01:11:02.960 align:start position:0%

representative sue hamala hamola i

the purpose of this testimony is to
 
01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
provide support for hb 1473 authorizing
 
01:11:39.510 --> 01:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
a phrasing forensic audit of the
 
01:11:41.910 --> 01:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
november 3rd 2020 election results for
 
01:11:43.910 --> 01:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
merrimack county
 
01:11:46.229 --> 01:11:46.239 align:start position:0%
following the election a constituent
 
01:11:48.070 --> 01:11:48.080 align:start position:0%
with a background in data analysis
 
01:11:50.709 --> 01:11:50.719 align:start position:0%
contacted me regarding preliminary vote
 
01:11:52.790 --> 01:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
analysis he did for select towns across
 
01:11:54.950 --> 01:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:11:57.430 --> 01:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
he detected anomalies in the data and
 
01:11:59.830 --> 01:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
brought those to the attention of mr bud
 
01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:00.790 align:start position:0%
brought those to the attention of mr bud
fitch

01:12:00.790 --> 01:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
fitch
 
01:12:02.310 --> 01:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
legal counsel for the secretary of
 
01:12:04.870 --> 01:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
state's office mr fitch informed him
 
01:12:06.709 --> 01:12:06.719 align:start position:0%
that the analysis method he performed
 
01:12:08.790 --> 01:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
was not rigorous enough to rate further
 
01:12:10.390 --> 01:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
action on the matter
 
01:12:12.790 --> 01:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
the constituent then redid the analysis
 
01:12:14.950 --> 01:12:14.960 align:start position:0%
with the more thorough method used
 
01:12:17.669 --> 01:12:17.679 align:start position:0%
utilizing publicly available vote totals
 
01:12:20.229 --> 01:12:20.239 align:start position:0%
from 2020 he compared those with the
 
01:12:22.630 --> 01:12:22.640 align:start position:0%
2016 general election results
 
01:12:25.030 --> 01:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
he performed an analysis of every town
 
01:12:26.950 --> 01:12:26.960 align:start position:0%
across new hampshire
 
01:12:28.790 --> 01:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
interestingly this data revealed an
 
01:12:31.110 --> 01:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
issue with the windham state rep race
 
01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
before the infra before that information
 
01:12:35.270 --> 01:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
was even publicly
 
01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:36.550 align:start position:0%
was even publicly
available

01:12:36.550 --> 01:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:12:38.870 --> 01:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
or publicly discussed
 
01:12:40.630 --> 01:12:40.640 align:start position:0%
this data highlighted statistical
 
01:12:42.709 --> 01:12:42.719 align:start position:0%
anomalies in multiple towns which showed
 
01:12:44.630 --> 01:12:44.640 align:start position:0%
shifts in the federal ticket results
 
01:12:46.229 --> 01:12:46.239 align:start position:0%
when compared with the historically
 
01:12:48.830 --> 01:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
expected results of the state house race
 
01:12:51.430 --> 01:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
results for example statistical
 
01:12:53.350 --> 01:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
anomalies occurred in some select towns
 
01:12:55.030 --> 01:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
in hillsborough county
 
01:12:57.030 --> 01:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
such as litchfield lindenborough nashua
 
01:12:58.310 --> 01:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
and hudson
 
01:13:00.550 --> 01:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
and in rockingham county it occurred in
 
01:13:02.470 --> 01:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
such places as northampton which showed
 
01:13:04.229 --> 01:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
an even bigger deviation from the
 
01:13:06.870 --> 01:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
historically typical vote share
 
01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
in merrimack county statistical
 
01:13:10.310 --> 01:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
anomalies presented themselves in some
 
01:13:12.470 --> 01:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
locations such as concord ward 8 and
 
01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:13.910 align:start position:0%
locations such as concord ward 8 and
newberry

01:13:13.910 --> 01:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
newberry
 
01:13:15.669 --> 01:13:15.679 align:start position:0%
please note this is not a complete
 
01:13:18.229 --> 01:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
listing it's just some examples where
 
01:13:19.990 --> 01:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
anomalies are noted
 
01:13:21.510 --> 01:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
in addition to this data another
 
01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
analysis was done which compared vote
 
01:13:25.990 --> 01:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
totals of towns that did and did not use
 
01:13:28.149 --> 01:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
the die bold slash dominion machine
 
01:13:29.669 --> 01:13:29.679 align:start position:0%
counting devices
 
01:13:31.669 --> 01:13:31.679 align:start position:0%
in towns and districts that did not use
 
01:13:33.830 --> 01:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
diebold machines the republican
 
01:13:35.590 --> 01:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
presidential candidate's overall vote
 
01:13:38.790 --> 01:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
share was 2.8 percent less than the
 
01:13:40.310 --> 01:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
local new hampshire state house
 
01:13:42.470 --> 01:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
republican candidates
 
01:13:44.310 --> 01:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
in locations that did use die bold
 
01:13:45.910 --> 01:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
machines the republican presidential
 
01:13:48.310 --> 01:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
candidate's overall vote share was 6.4
 
01:13:50.310 --> 01:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
percent less than local new hampshire
 
01:13:52.550 --> 01:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
state house republican candidates
 
01:13:54.630 --> 01:13:54.640 align:start position:0%
this results in an overall difference of
 
01:13:56.950 --> 01:13:56.960 align:start position:0%
3.6 percent and that means that in
 
01:13:59.270 --> 01:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
places where dibold machines were used
 
01:14:01.030 --> 01:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
there is a more than double percentage
 
01:14:02.950 --> 01:14:02.960 align:start position:0%
of under voting
 
01:14:05.030 --> 01:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
please note this vote data this vote
 
01:14:06.950 --> 01:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
count data analysis in each town in no
 
01:14:10.390 --> 01:14:10.400 align:start position:0%
way suggests malfeasance
 
01:14:12.550 --> 01:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
however given the historically expected
 
01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
vote deviation it did suggest that a
 
01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
closer examination was warranted
 
01:14:19.669 --> 01:14:19.679 align:start position:0%
on december 3rd i sent a letter to
 
01:14:21.110 --> 01:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
chairman cook of the ballot law
 
01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
commission regarding the vote analysis i
 
01:14:25.110 --> 01:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
sent this letter to the ballot law
 
01:14:26.709 --> 01:14:26.719 align:start position:0%
commission because this is where i was
 
01:14:28.390 --> 01:14:28.400 align:start position:0%
advised to send the letter
 
01:14:30.470 --> 01:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
after i spoke to mr fitch at length
 
01:14:32.149 --> 01:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
about the matter
 
01:14:33.750 --> 01:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
a copy of the letter was also sent to
 
01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
the offices of the secretary of state
 
01:14:36.470 --> 01:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
and the governor
 
01:14:38.229 --> 01:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
a copy of this letter has also been
 
01:14:42.310 --> 01:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
emailed to you all individually
 
01:14:43.830 --> 01:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
after receiving no response from the
 
01:14:45.510 --> 01:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
ballot law commission the secretary of
 
01:14:47.110 --> 01:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
state or the governor's office i sent a
 
01:14:50.070 --> 01:14:50.080 align:start position:0%
follow-up email on december 23rd
 
01:14:52.310 --> 01:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
i received a reply from the ballot law
 
01:14:54.550 --> 01:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
chairman mr cook the following day
 
01:14:57.510 --> 01:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
december 24th with his assurances that
 
01:14:58.790 --> 01:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
he would speak to the secretary of
 
01:14:59.910 --> 01:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
state's office
 
01:15:03.590 --> 01:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
on january 14 2021 i received his reply
 
01:15:05.030 --> 01:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
which stated that the ballot law
 
01:15:06.870 --> 01:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
commission did not have the jurisdiction
 
01:15:08.709 --> 01:15:08.719 align:start position:0%
to review the matter further
 
01:15:11.189 --> 01:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
a copy the emails between myself and the
 
01:15:12.630 --> 01:15:12.640 align:start position:0%
ballot law commission have also been
 
01:15:15.830 --> 01:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
emailed to you individually
 
01:15:17.750 --> 01:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
throughout my request for an audit of
 
01:15:19.430 --> 01:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
some new hampshire towns i have
 
01:15:21.510 --> 01:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
regularly emphasized that i make no
 
01:15:24.390 --> 01:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
assertion of election malfeasance
 
01:15:26.470 --> 01:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
it is quite possible that in one of the
 
01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
most hotly contested elections in recent
 
01:15:31.270 --> 01:15:31.280 align:start position:0%
memory the voters of new hampshire did
 
01:15:33.110 --> 01:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
choose to be the only state in the
 
01:15:35.270 --> 01:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
country to completely flip its state
 
01:15:37.110 --> 01:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
legislative majority while
 
01:15:38.950 --> 01:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
simultaneously vote for the opposing
 
01:15:40.709 --> 01:15:40.719 align:start position:0%
political party candidates in all
 
01:15:42.390 --> 01:15:42.400 align:start position:0%
federal races
 
01:15:44.229 --> 01:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
with the cre that i truly am not being
 
01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
sarcastic with the craziness of 2020 we
 
01:15:48.790 --> 01:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
know that anything's possible
 
01:15:50.709 --> 01:15:50.719 align:start position:0%
having said that is clear that over this
 
01:15:52.630 --> 01:15:52.640 align:start position:0%
past year voter confidence has been
 
01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
strained and given the amount of energy
 
01:15:56.950 --> 01:15:56.960 align:start position:0%
and pride we infuse into our state
 
01:15:59.590 --> 01:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
election process this lack of confidence
 
01:16:01.910 --> 01:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
represents something quite disheartening
 
01:16:04.550 --> 01:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
especially if we leave it unchecked
 
01:16:06.149 --> 01:16:06.159 align:start position:0%
i've heard some election officials say
 
01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
that it's time to move forward and not
 
01:16:09.189 --> 01:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
backward as we close the chapter on the
 
01:16:11.350 --> 01:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
november 3rd 2020 election
 
01:16:13.270 --> 01:16:13.280 align:start position:0%
it does not take much effort to discover
 
01:16:15.030 --> 01:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
that the uneasiness many new hampshire
 
01:16:16.470 --> 01:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
voters have felt about this past
 
01:16:18.830 --> 01:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
election is still relevant and important
 
01:16:21.350 --> 01:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
issue and voter confidence has been
 
01:16:23.590 --> 01:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
further shaken by our collective apathy
 
01:16:25.990 --> 01:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
over this past year
 
01:16:28.229 --> 01:16:28.239 align:start position:0%
until we properly examine a sampling of
 
01:16:30.950 --> 01:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
the anomalous vote data we know exists
 
01:16:32.709 --> 01:16:32.719 align:start position:0%
lack of public confidence and vote
 
01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
integrity will continue to cast out over
 
01:16:36.870 --> 01:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
all future elections which would really
 
01:16:38.709 --> 01:16:38.719 align:start position:0%
be heartbreaking
 
01:16:41.669 --> 01:16:41.679 align:start position:0%
i support hb 1473 because it casts a
 
01:16:44.229 --> 01:16:44.239 align:start position:0%
wide enough net by which to properly
 
01:16:46.470 --> 01:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
audit the november 3rd 2020 election
 
01:16:48.950 --> 01:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
results and it will enable us to restore
 
01:16:50.470 --> 01:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
public confidence in our election
 
01:16:52.229 --> 01:16:52.239 align:start position:0%
process going forward
 
01:16:54.149 --> 01:16:54.159 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take any questions thank

this large team here that's been working

together to do a citizen's audit based
 
01:17:49.510 --> 01:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
on our concerns over the 2020 election
 
01:17:52.229 --> 01:17:52.239 align:start position:0%
we have 8 000 people participating in
 
01:17:55.110 --> 01:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
various forms across multiple platforms
 
01:17:58.310 --> 01:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
and we've executed over 243 foia
 
01:18:00.550 --> 01:18:00.560 align:start position:0%
requests in order to do the work that
 
01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
we're doing
 
01:18:04.229 --> 01:18:04.239 align:start position:0%
in 2020 we experience some really
 
01:18:06.149 --> 01:18:06.159 align:start position:0%
unusual things in new hampshire and so
 
01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:08.560 align:start position:0%
what i want to do is talk about two
 
01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:09.590 align:start position:0%
what i want to do is talk about two
things

01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:18:11.390 --> 01:18:11.400 align:start position:0%
because hb
 
01:18:14.630 --> 01:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
1473 has really two asks of this
 
01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:15.669 align:start position:0%
1473 has really two asks of this
committee

01:18:15.669 --> 01:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:18:17.830 --> 01:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
the first ask is in regards to
 
01:18:20.630 --> 01:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
conducting a forensic audit of a test
 
01:18:23.510 --> 01:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
case which is merrimack we're asking you
 
01:18:25.669 --> 01:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
to evaluate some of the evidence you're
 
01:18:28.310 --> 01:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
hearing today on the necessity of that
 
01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:29.430 align:start position:0%
hearing today on the necessity of that
audit

01:18:29.430 --> 01:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
audit
 
01:18:31.510 --> 01:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
the second thing we're asking you is to
 
01:18:34.630 --> 01:18:34.640 align:start position:0%
do the audit in a very prescribed way
 
01:18:36.310 --> 01:18:36.320 align:start position:0%
there is a lot of fallout from our
 
01:18:38.470 --> 01:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
windham audit in a lot of learnings and
 
01:18:40.149 --> 01:18:40.159 align:start position:0%
so we carried them forward into this
 
01:18:42.390 --> 01:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
bill so i'm going to touch on those two
 
01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:43.669 align:start position:0%
bill so i'm going to touch on those two
parts

01:18:43.669 --> 01:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
parts
 
01:18:46.790 --> 01:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
so the first thing what happened in 2020
 
01:18:48.709 --> 01:18:48.719 align:start position:0%
that made us all think
 
01:18:50.790 --> 01:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
we needed to kind of look into this
 
01:18:53.510 --> 01:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
beyond the fact that we have not ever as
 
01:18:56.310 --> 01:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
a as a state conducted
 
01:18:58.950 --> 01:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
an audit of our election practices which
 
01:19:01.830 --> 01:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
is as pat mentioned is really unusual
 
01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
any large business that has outside
 
01:19:07.110 --> 01:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
stakeholders uses third-party audit so
 
01:19:08.950 --> 01:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
that they can commit to those
 
01:19:11.110 --> 01:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
stakeholders that the results are
 
01:19:13.750 --> 01:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
accurate and we do not have that
 
01:19:15.910 --> 01:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
practice and so this is our opportunity
 
01:19:17.030 --> 01:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
to do it
 
01:19:19.550 --> 01:19:19.560 align:start position:0%
in 2020 we had
 
01:19:22.709 --> 01:19:22.719 align:start position:0%
255 percent increase in our absentee
 
01:19:22.719 --> 01:19:23.830 align:start position:0%
255 percent increase in our absentee
ballots

01:19:23.830 --> 01:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
01:19:27.030 --> 01:19:27.040 align:start position:0%
that is a third of all the ballots cast
 
01:19:29.590 --> 01:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
in 2020 were absentee this was an
 
01:19:32.470 --> 01:19:32.480 align:start position:0%
anomaly for us again covet happened but
 
01:19:34.790 --> 01:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
never in our history did we have over
 
01:19:37.830 --> 01:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
nine percent absentee ballots
 
01:19:39.830 --> 01:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
across the state we had some really
 
01:19:41.830 --> 01:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
unusual things happen too
 
01:19:44.550 --> 01:19:44.560 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to isolate two counties in
 
01:19:47.350 --> 01:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
rockingham the county ballots grew one
 
01:19:51.030 --> 01:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
percent in 2012 from the prior election
 
01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:52.149 align:start position:0%
percent in 2012 from the prior election
1

01:19:52.149 --> 01:19:52.159 align:start position:0%
1
 
01:19:54.070 --> 01:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
in 2016
 
01:19:57.189 --> 01:19:57.199 align:start position:0%
from the prior election but miraculously
 
01:19:59.590 --> 01:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
they grew 13
 
01:20:02.790 --> 01:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
in 2020 in one of the two parties grew
 
01:20:05.350 --> 01:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
by 25 percent now what makes that
 
01:20:07.590 --> 01:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
unusual is that the population in
 
01:20:10.229 --> 01:20:10.239 align:start position:0%
rockingham grew two percent
 
01:20:12.229 --> 01:20:12.239 align:start position:0%
so how in the world would that happen
 
01:20:13.830 --> 01:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
makes you scratch your head it's on that
 
01:20:15.510 --> 01:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
list of the things that make you go hmm
 
01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:16.629 align:start position:0%
list of the things that make you go hmm
right

01:20:16.629 --> 01:20:16.639 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:20:18.310 --> 01:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
let's talk about hillsborough very
 
01:20:22.149 --> 01:20:22.159 align:start position:0%
similarly um they had flat ballots in
 
01:20:22.159 --> 01:20:23.750 align:start position:0%
similarly um they had flat ballots in
2012

01:20:23.750 --> 01:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
2012
 
01:20:26.790 --> 01:20:26.800 align:start position:0%
a decline in 2016
 
01:20:30.950 --> 01:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
but they grew 12 percent overall in 2020
 
01:20:33.030 --> 01:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
and 23
 
01:20:35.590 --> 01:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
uh voter growth in a single party in
 
01:20:38.229 --> 01:20:38.239 align:start position:0%
that election while the population grew
 
01:20:38.239 --> 01:20:40.629 align:start position:0%
that election while the population grew
1.7

01:20:40.629 --> 01:20:40.639 align:start position:0%
1.7
 
01:20:43.510 --> 01:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
something doesn't make sense and that is
 
01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:44.310 align:start position:0%
something doesn't make sense and that is
why

01:20:44.310 --> 01:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:20:47.030 --> 01:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
we really need to focus on the data and
 
01:20:49.110 --> 01:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
the details and that's why we're asking
 
01:20:50.709 --> 01:20:50.719 align:start position:0%
your help here
 
01:20:52.470 --> 01:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
so let's just talk a little bit about
 
01:20:54.790 --> 01:20:54.800 align:start position:0%
the foundations of our election process
 
01:20:55.990 --> 01:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
you've heard people talk about our
 
01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:57.590 align:start position:0%
you've heard people talk about our
machines

01:20:57.590 --> 01:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
machines
 
01:20:59.750 --> 01:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
as a state we have
 
01:21:02.790 --> 01:21:02.800 align:start position:0%
given the responsibility of managing our
 
01:21:04.709 --> 01:21:04.719 align:start position:0%
election process through the machines to
 
01:21:07.590 --> 01:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
a single company named lhs
 
01:21:10.950 --> 01:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
lhs is the is the single focus of the
 
01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:11.990 align:start position:0%
lhs is the is the single focus of the
machine

01:21:11.990 --> 01:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
machine
 
01:21:15.110 --> 01:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
memory card programming as well as any
 
01:21:16.870 --> 01:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
updates and maintenance through our
 
01:21:20.229 --> 01:21:20.239 align:start position:0%
four-year requests we have found that
 
01:21:22.149 --> 01:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
most state clerks
 
01:21:25.430 --> 01:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
sorry town clerks have had lhas come in
 
01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:26.470 align:start position:0%
sorry town clerks have had lhas come in
perform

01:21:26.470 --> 01:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
perform
 
01:21:28.470 --> 01:21:28.480 align:start position:0%
maintenance on their machines no one
 
01:21:30.310 --> 01:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
signed the forms no one said what
 
01:21:32.070 --> 01:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
they've done and they've sent their
 
01:21:35.030 --> 01:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
cards back post the election immediately
 
01:21:37.510 --> 01:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
to lhs for reprogramming and
 
01:21:39.830 --> 01:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
anticipation of the next election as
 
01:21:41.990 --> 01:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
you've heard this is in violation of
 
01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
federal law by not maintaining the data
 
01:21:46.709 --> 01:21:46.719 align:start position:0%
for 22 months
 
01:21:48.310 --> 01:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
major problem
 
01:21:50.149 --> 01:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
the second thing about the machines is
 
01:21:52.229 --> 01:21:52.239 align:start position:0%
that they are hackable again mentioned
 
01:21:54.790 --> 01:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
by other people giving testimony as well
 
01:21:57.590 --> 01:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
as in a letter from our own secretary of
 
01:22:00.070 --> 01:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
state the machines are vulnerable
 
01:22:02.390 --> 01:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
what makes it even more disconcerting is
 
01:22:05.030 --> 01:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
that we have it documented and splashed
 
01:22:07.350 --> 01:22:07.360 align:start position:0%
across the country in documentaries
 
01:22:09.430 --> 01:22:09.440 align:start position:0%
where our lhs machines are the focal
 
01:22:11.910 --> 01:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
point you can see them hacking it
 
01:22:14.470 --> 01:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
on the big rig and hacking democracy so
 
01:22:17.030 --> 01:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
it's a big problem for us
 
01:22:19.189 --> 01:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
where the rubber hits the road and up to
 
01:22:20.950 --> 01:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
this point in time most everything i can
 
01:22:24.070 --> 01:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
tell you is anecdotal it really becomes
 
01:22:25.910 --> 01:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
data driven when i tell you about our
 
01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:27.590 align:start position:0%
data driven when i tell you about our
canvas

01:22:27.590 --> 01:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
canvas
 
01:22:29.270 --> 01:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
this fearless group of people went out
 
01:22:31.750 --> 01:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
and canvassed multiple towns we knocked
 
01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:32.709 align:start position:0%
and canvassed multiple towns we knocked
on

01:22:32.709 --> 01:22:32.719 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:22:34.790 --> 01:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
almost a thousand doors we reached about
 
01:22:37.270 --> 01:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
half of the people and what we found is
 
01:22:41.270 --> 01:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
about 13 to 15 percent of the votes cast
 
01:22:43.990 --> 01:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
were not cast by the voters at those
 
01:22:46.870 --> 01:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
homes we have and again we can mention
 
01:22:48.870 --> 01:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
these cases you've heard them
 
01:22:51.030 --> 01:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
people that live in the residence didn't
 
01:22:53.189 --> 01:22:53.199 align:start position:0%
vote had absentee ballots cast on their
 
01:22:55.910 --> 01:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
behalf we have addresses that do not
 
01:22:58.310 --> 01:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
exist we have people who've gone in and
 
01:23:01.350 --> 01:23:01.360 align:start position:0%
voted in person who had absentee ballots
 
01:23:03.590 --> 01:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
cast for them these have generated
 
01:23:05.990 --> 01:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
affidavits in these affidavits sit in
 
01:23:07.669 --> 01:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
front of the attorney general they were
 
01:23:10.229 --> 01:23:10.239 align:start position:0%
sent to him hard copy he has them as a
 
01:23:12.709 --> 01:23:12.719 align:start position:0%
monday electronic copy they were served
 
01:23:15.750 --> 01:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
as of saturday we continue to canvas and
 
01:23:17.990 --> 01:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
bring forward information but this is
 
01:23:20.790 --> 01:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
hard data that is relevant to where we
 
01:23:23.030 --> 01:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
are today and the need for this
 
01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:24.550 align:start position:0%
are today and the need for this
information

01:23:24.550 --> 01:23:24.560 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:23:26.870 --> 01:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
so let me talk a little bit about windom
 
01:23:28.709 --> 01:23:28.719 align:start position:0%
and why we have
 
01:23:30.870 --> 01:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
actually put the procedure of how we'd
 
01:23:33.270 --> 01:23:33.280 align:start position:0%
like this audit conducted you know what
 
01:23:36.149 --> 01:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
we saw we had windom in the spotlight
 
01:23:38.310 --> 01:23:38.320 align:start position:0%
you guys saw the boxes being rolled out
 
01:23:41.030 --> 01:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
boxes being open you could reach in we
 
01:23:42.790 --> 01:23:42.800 align:start position:0%
also had
 
01:23:45.350 --> 01:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
a very public
 
01:23:48.149 --> 01:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
issue where we hired a third party
 
01:23:49.990 --> 01:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
auditor who has been well known to us
 
01:23:51.910 --> 01:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
his name is harry hirsty
 
01:23:54.390 --> 01:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
harry hirsty was the focal point for
 
01:23:57.110 --> 01:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
instructing on the machine audit
 
01:23:59.750 --> 01:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
we have him on video instructing the
 
01:24:02.950 --> 01:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
reset of the cards to pre-election
 
01:24:05.510 --> 01:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
and we also have him instructing making
 
01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:06.629 align:start position:0%
and we also have him instructing making
no

01:24:06.629 --> 01:24:06.639 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:24:09.830 --> 01:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
copy of the existing memory cards this
 
01:24:13.350 --> 01:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
reset our memory cards to pre-election
 
01:24:15.430 --> 01:24:15.440 align:start position:0%
i also have which i will
 
01:24:18.070 --> 01:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
provide to you an affidavit signed by
 
01:24:20.149 --> 01:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
harry hirsty when he was in a court
 
01:24:22.229 --> 01:24:22.239 align:start position:0%
appearance in wisconsin
 
01:24:25.270 --> 01:24:25.280 align:start position:0%
in his affidavit he states that the
 
01:24:28.390 --> 01:24:28.400 align:start position:0%
memory cards can be hacked and that once
 
01:24:31.430 --> 01:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
they are reset the hack is removed so we
 
01:24:33.350 --> 01:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
have his signed affidavit and we have
 
01:24:34.709 --> 01:24:34.719 align:start position:0%
him on tape
 
01:24:37.350 --> 01:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
um performing that exact maneuver within
 
01:24:40.070 --> 01:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
our windham art this is incredibly
 
01:24:42.470 --> 01:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
disconcerting to the people in the room
 
01:24:44.629 --> 01:24:44.639 align:start position:0%
and the people that are concerned about
 
01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
election integrity so we've been very
 
01:24:49.430 --> 01:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
prescriptive we have asked let's do a
 
01:24:51.110 --> 01:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
sample to find out what's going on in
 
01:24:52.310 --> 01:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:24:55.270 --> 01:24:55.280 align:start position:0%
we've asked to go into merrimack and do
 
01:24:57.189 --> 01:24:57.199 align:start position:0%
a three race

for this country
 
01:25:38.070 --> 01:25:38.080 align:start position:0%

01:25:42.950 --> 01:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
they fight for if we would audit banks
 
01:25:45.669 --> 01:25:45.679 align:start position:0%

01:28:13.750 --> 01:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
them involve you guys and if you guys
 
01:28:17.350 --> 01:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
want to keep sitting on the spotlight
 
01:28:22.070 --> 01:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:24.149 --> 01:28:24.159 align:start position:0%
new hampshire we have a lot we have
 
01:28:25.510 --> 01:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
documentaries being made we have

lawsuits being filed and we have
 
01:28:33.270 --> 01:28:33.280 align:start position:0%
uh deputy the chief deputy bud fitch
 
01:28:35.189 --> 01:28:35.199 align:start position:0%
said that he
 
01:28:37.189 --> 01:28:37.199 align:start position:0%
that we were we have this in writing we
 
01:28:39.030 --> 01:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
have we have a whistleblower
 
01:28:40.709 --> 01:28:40.719 align:start position:0%
town clerk we have a whistleblower town
 
01:28:40.719 --> 01:28:41.590 align:start position:0%
town clerk we have a whistleblower town
clerk

01:28:41.590 --> 01:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
clerk
 
01:28:43.110 --> 01:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
just so you guys know i'm sure you i
 
01:28:44.310 --> 01:28:44.320 align:start position:0%
don't know if you guys saw the interview
 
01:28:45.830 --> 01:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
or not but there is
 
01:28:48.550 --> 01:28:48.560 align:start position:0%
and and bud fitch literally writes in an
 
01:28:50.470 --> 01:28:50.480 align:start position:0%
email that you don't have to keep the
 
01:28:52.229 --> 01:28:52.239 align:start position:0%
memory cards it doesn't get much more
 
01:28:53.830 --> 01:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
clear than that that is
 
01:28:57.030 --> 01:28:57.040 align:start position:0%
a federal violation it's a federal
 
01:28:59.030 --> 01:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
violation it's a state violation why
 
01:29:00.550 --> 01:29:00.560 align:start position:0%
would you not keep those memory cards
 
01:29:02.709 --> 01:29:02.719 align:start position:0%
when you know that they can be hacked i
 
01:29:05.110 --> 01:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
also have an email from from scanlan
 
01:29:07.270 --> 01:29:07.280 align:start position:0%
admitting that the the the memories
 
01:29:09.669 --> 01:29:09.679 align:start position:0%
cards can be hacked so why would you not
 
01:29:11.750 --> 01:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
keep a memory card
 
01:29:13.590 --> 01:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
that can be hacked
 
01:29:16.070 --> 01:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
does that make any sense if you guys put
 
01:29:17.910 --> 01:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
your money if this was your money would
 
01:29:20.310 --> 01:29:20.320 align:start position:0%
you audit it and i know damn well you
 
01:29:21.910 --> 01:29:21.920 align:start position:0%
guys would audit this if this was your
 
01:29:24.470 --> 01:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
money so i'm asking you to do all of us
 
01:29:27.270 --> 01:29:27.280 align:start position:0%
a favor here because we breathe and live
 
01:29:29.830 --> 01:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
these elections and and like i said a
 
01:29:31.590 --> 01:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
lot of us are working
 
01:29:33.830 --> 01:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
there's people that work
 
01:29:35.830 --> 01:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
10 hours a day and then come home and do
 
01:29:37.750 --> 01:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
a bunch of data entry for new hampshire
 
01:29:40.629 --> 01:29:40.639 align:start position:0%
voter integrity these people are done
 
01:29:42.470 --> 01:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
with it and and
 
01:29:43.830 --> 01:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
the only reason why they're not here
 
01:29:45.750 --> 01:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
today is because it because it's a work
 
01:29:48.390 --> 01:29:48.400 align:start position:0%
day so i'm asking you let us get our
 
01:29:49.910 --> 01:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
lives back because we're just going to
 
01:29:51.669 --> 01:29:51.679 align:start position:0%
keep waking more and more and more
 
01:29:53.430 --> 01:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
people up and it's not going to stop and
 
01:29:54.950 --> 01:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
do the right thing
 
01:29:56.709 --> 01:29:56.719 align:start position:0%
you guys all have kids don't you want
 
01:29:58.390 --> 01:29:58.400 align:start position:0%
them to vote don't you want to ensure
 
01:30:00.870 --> 01:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
their their their future
 
01:30:03.270 --> 01:30:03.280 align:start position:0%
if and scanlan needs to be the first
 
01:30:05.350 --> 01:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
person to go because i have a bunch of
 
01:30:07.350 --> 01:30:07.360 align:start position:0%
evidence i don't mind if you point at me
 
01:30:08.470 --> 01:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
i don't want you pointing it out of the
 
01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:09.270 align:start position:0%
i don't want you pointing it out of the
car

01:30:09.270 --> 01:30:09.280 align:start position:0%

01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:15.530 align:start position:0%
sitting in that direction
 
01:30:15.530 --> 01:30:17.669 align:start position:0%
sitting in that direction
[Laughter]

01:30:17.669 --> 01:30:17.679 align:start position:0%

after i confronted him about his lie
 
01:30:25.590 --> 01:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
just so you know i did confront him
 
01:30:28.470 --> 01:30:28.480 align:start position:0%

01:30:31.750 --> 01:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
you have dean um so the moral of the
 
01:30:33.270 --> 01:30:33.280 align:start position:0%
story is
 
01:30:35.990 --> 01:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
please either there's only two options
 
01:30:37.830 --> 01:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
get rid of the machines or give us a
 
01:30:39.430 --> 01:30:39.440 align:start position:0%

there's two bills those are the only two
 
01:30:45.030 --> 01:30:45.040 align:start position:0%
options and that's only fair and u.s
 
01:30:46.790 --> 01:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
have to agree with that this is our most
 
01:30:48.550 --> 01:30:48.560 align:start position:0%
sacred right i've fought for this
 
01:30:49.990 --> 01:30:50.000 align:start position:0%

01:31:05.510 --> 01:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
and and give us back our sanity so
 
01:31:09.990 --> 01:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:13.750 --> 01:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
means or get rid of or give us an audit
 
01:31:15.430 --> 01:31:15.440 align:start position:0%
if you don't do one of the two that
 
01:31:18.550 --> 01:31:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:20.709 --> 01:31:20.719 align:start position:0%
any questions for miss todd
 
01:31:25.590 --> 01:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:39.110 --> 01:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:41.189 --> 01:31:41.199 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is elaine plant and
 
01:31:43.669 --> 01:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
i'm a dover resident
 
01:31:45.830 --> 01:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
i am also can you get a little closer to
 
01:31:48.550 --> 01:31:48.560 align:start position:0%
the mike yes elaine plant from dover and
 
01:31:51.590 --> 01:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
also first time um being in a meeting
 
01:31:53.270 --> 01:31:53.280 align:start position:0%
like today
 
01:31:56.070 --> 01:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
and also admittedly having been a lazy
 
01:31:58.629 --> 01:31:58.639 align:start position:0%
citizen most of my life but
 
01:32:00.310 --> 01:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
that has changed because of what i've
 
01:32:02.950 --> 01:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
had to a chance to witness for myself
 
01:32:04.229 --> 01:32:04.239 align:start position:0%
and that recently with voter
 
01:32:06.790 --> 01:32:06.800 align:start position:0%
registration and the absentee ballots i
 
01:32:08.310 --> 01:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
believe there are questions that need
 
01:32:10.310 --> 01:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
answers in both of those areas
 
01:32:11.910 --> 01:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
a close friend of mine acquired the
 
01:32:14.310 --> 01:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
voter registration list from her town
 
01:32:15.830 --> 01:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
on that list were three people
 
01:32:18.390 --> 01:32:18.400 align:start position:0%
registered at her own home address not
 
01:32:20.550 --> 01:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
her family who had not lived there in
 
01:32:23.510 --> 01:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
well excess of 10 years and there were
 
01:32:26.390 --> 01:32:26.400 align:start position:0%
many examples like that that she found
 
01:32:28.550 --> 01:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
this prompted me to get my town's voter
 
01:32:30.550 --> 01:32:30.560 align:start position:0%
registration list and when i went to my
 
01:32:33.270 --> 01:32:33.280 align:start position:0%
clerk's office i was denied access as
 
01:32:36.070 --> 01:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
were several friends trying to access
 
01:32:39.189 --> 01:32:39.199 align:start position:0%
the voter list from their towns as well
 
01:32:41.270 --> 01:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
um that is a problem as this is public
 
01:32:43.590 --> 01:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
information so we ended up calling the
 
01:32:45.750 --> 01:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
state and we're given access to those
 
01:32:48.550 --> 01:32:48.560 align:start position:0%
lists and it begs the question of why we
 
01:32:50.709 --> 01:32:50.719 align:start position:0%
did why were we denied access in the
 
01:32:52.390 --> 01:32:52.400 align:start position:0%
first place and where is the
 
01:32:54.709 --> 01:32:54.719 align:start position:0%
transparency and why were we being
 
01:32:54.719 --> 01:32:56.790 align:start position:0%
transparency and why were we being
denied

01:32:56.790 --> 01:32:56.800 align:start position:0%
denied
 
01:32:59.030 --> 01:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
a friend and i vetted the official
 
01:33:00.870 --> 01:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
checklist of the
 
01:33:03.750 --> 01:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
state general election of 11-3 2020
 
01:33:05.669 --> 01:33:05.679 align:start position:0%
including the same-day registration with
 
01:33:07.510 --> 01:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
the voter registration list for that
 
01:33:10.629 --> 01:33:10.639 align:start position:0%
town we observed double votes people
 
01:33:13.030 --> 01:33:13.040 align:start position:0%
voting with no address and no id people
 
01:33:15.350 --> 01:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
on the voter list but listed again on
 
01:33:18.390 --> 01:33:18.400 align:start position:0%
the write in page write in pages with 25
 
01:33:21.590 --> 01:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
to 50 names on them per ward and per
 
01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:23.189 align:start position:0%
to 50 names on them per ward and per
letter

01:33:23.189 --> 01:33:23.199 align:start position:0%
letter
 
01:33:25.990 --> 01:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
signatures missing by the monitors
 
01:33:28.709 --> 01:33:28.719 align:start position:0%
witnessing the pages
 
01:33:31.189 --> 01:33:31.199 align:start position:0%
that voter roll had not been updated in
 
01:33:33.270 --> 01:33:33.280 align:start position:0%
10 years the volunteers at these
 
01:33:34.709 --> 01:33:34.719 align:start position:0%
election sites can't be the ones
 
01:33:36.390 --> 01:33:36.400 align:start position:0%
responsible for making sure everything
 
01:33:38.870 --> 01:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
is accurate from what i saw i do not
 
01:33:41.510 --> 01:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
have great confidence in the election
 
01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:42.870 align:start position:0%
have great confidence in the election
process

01:33:42.870 --> 01:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:33:45.030 --> 01:33:45.040 align:start position:0%
i had the opportunity to canvas in the
 
01:33:47.030 --> 01:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
rye area in new hampshire in october of
 
01:33:49.750 --> 01:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
2021 with nine other people for a few
 
01:33:52.229 --> 01:33:52.239 align:start position:0%
hours while knocking on doors i
 
01:33:54.950 --> 01:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
discovered from the current residents
 
01:33:57.350 --> 01:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
that two others registered at that
 
01:33:59.590 --> 01:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
address no longer lived there at another
 
01:34:01.830 --> 01:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
address a person registered on the list
 
01:34:03.750 --> 01:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
had main license plates
 
01:34:04.950 --> 01:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
in early
 
01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:06.149 align:start position:0%
in early
october

01:34:06.149 --> 01:34:06.159 align:start position:0%
october
 
01:34:09.350 --> 01:34:09.360 align:start position:0%
of 2021 i went to the clerk to obtain
 
01:34:11.110 --> 01:34:11.120 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots for myself and my
 
01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:12.070 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots for myself and my
husband

01:34:12.070 --> 01:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
husband
 
01:34:13.669 --> 01:34:13.679 align:start position:0%
i could not leave with my husband's
 
01:34:15.430 --> 01:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
ballot as he was not with me so the
 
01:34:17.830 --> 01:34:17.840 align:start position:0%
clerk had to mail it i asked about
 
01:34:19.669 --> 01:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
timelines to be sure that we'd receive
 
01:34:21.350 --> 01:34:21.360 align:start position:0%
it before traveling
 
01:34:22.470 --> 01:34:22.480 align:start position:0%
the clerk
 
01:34:25.430 --> 01:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
stuffed sealed and put the ballot in
 
01:34:28.149 --> 01:34:28.159 align:start position:0%
outgoing mail while i watched her to
 
01:34:31.110 --> 01:34:31.120 align:start position:0%
allay any fear of not getting it timely
 
01:34:32.390 --> 01:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
two weeks later
 
01:34:34.629 --> 01:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
still no ballot my husband had to go
 
01:34:36.390 --> 01:34:36.400 align:start position:0%
into the clerk he had to sign off on a
 
01:34:38.149 --> 01:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
paper that he had not received it and
 
01:34:40.229 --> 01:34:40.239 align:start position:0%
get another ballot to vote
 
01:34:42.790 --> 01:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
so the disappearing ballot out there was
 
01:34:45.910 --> 01:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
for anybody else to vote with
 
01:34:48.149 --> 01:34:48.159 align:start position:0%
my daughter not living with us traveling
 
01:34:50.070 --> 01:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
for a living requested her absentee
 
01:34:52.470 --> 01:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
ballot and never received hers as a
 
01:34:54.470 --> 01:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
result she was denied the opportunity to
 
01:34:56.870 --> 01:34:56.880 align:start position:0%
vote in the 2020 election where did her
 
01:34:58.629 --> 01:34:58.639 align:start position:0%
missing ballot go
 
01:35:01.510 --> 01:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
i support the hb 1473 because in my
 
01:35:03.430 --> 01:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
little world i have seen this much
 
01:35:05.990 --> 01:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
irregularity and i need effort through
 
01:35:08.070 --> 01:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
investigation to restore my confidence
 
01:35:10.470 --> 01:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
in the election process
 
01:35:12.390 --> 01:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
and then this was not written but
 
01:35:13.830 --> 01:35:13.840 align:start position:0%
because i've learned a lot here this
 
01:35:16.629 --> 01:35:16.639 align:start position:0%
morning just from the others
 
01:35:16.639 --> 01:35:17.510 align:start position:0%
morning just from the others
and

01:35:17.510 --> 01:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:35:19.270 --> 01:35:19.280 align:start position:0%
i was a little bit shocked at what came
 
01:35:21.430 --> 01:35:21.440 align:start position:0%
out of mr secretary of state scanlon's
 
01:35:24.149 --> 01:35:24.159 align:start position:0%
mouth saying that he feels secure that
 
01:35:26.070 --> 01:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
if there were issues happening we'd know
 
01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:26.790 align:start position:0%
if there were issues happening we'd know
it

01:35:26.790 --> 01:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:35:28.870 --> 01:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
we have the opportunity
 
01:35:31.430 --> 01:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
to not go upon feelings we have the
 
01:35:33.910 --> 01:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do an investigation and
 
01:35:36.310 --> 01:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
make all those voices who feel that it
 
01:35:39.270 --> 01:35:39.280 align:start position:0%
is not secure secure
 
01:35:40.629 --> 01:35:40.639 align:start position:0%
and then i learned another thing this
 
01:35:43.030 --> 01:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
morning me being nervous as a first-time
 
01:35:44.550 --> 01:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
voice and i heard other first-time
 
01:35:47.669 --> 01:35:47.679 align:start position:0%
voices i think we're going to have
 
01:35:51.109 --> 01:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
a windfall of first-time voices now
 
01:35:53.510 --> 01:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
speaking up because they
 
01:35:54.870 --> 01:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
everybody has questions and they're
 
01:35:56.310 --> 01:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
having their own experiences and they're
 
01:35:58.950 --> 01:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
hearing all these other people thank you
 
01:36:00.390 --> 01:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from committee
 
01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:01.510 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from committee
members

01:36:01.510 --> 01:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
members
 
01:36:03.350 --> 01:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
seeing none also
 
01:36:05.910 --> 01:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
signed up to speak is michael ivanovic
 
01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:07.350 align:start position:0%
signed up to speak is michael ivanovic
from

01:36:07.350 --> 01:36:07.360 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:36:13.350 --> 01:36:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:15.350 --> 01:36:15.360 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm actually
 
01:36:20.470 --> 01:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:21.590 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:36:31.830 --> 01:36:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:33.109 --> 01:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
thank you committee chair thank you
 
01:36:34.790 --> 01:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
01:36:36.709 --> 01:36:36.719 align:start position:0%
with any problem
 
01:36:39.030 --> 01:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
we need to help find a solution
 
01:36:41.270 --> 01:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
because the bottom line is you've heard
 
01:36:44.070 --> 01:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
lots and lots of testimony and even um
 
01:36:46.070 --> 01:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
secretary of state scanlan said oh yeah
 
01:36:47.830 --> 01:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
windham was a problem bedford was a
 
01:36:49.990 --> 01:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
problem but those are outliers well
 
01:36:51.510 --> 01:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
that's the same thing that harry hershey
 
01:36:53.350 --> 01:36:53.360 align:start position:0%
said when he did the winding we had a
 
01:36:54.790 --> 01:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
perfect storm
 
01:36:56.310 --> 01:36:56.320 align:start position:0%
when do
 
01:37:00.390 --> 01:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
coincidence become unlikely
 
01:37:02.870 --> 01:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
when does that happen after the fifth
 
01:37:05.750 --> 01:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
coincidence after the 23rd coincidence
 
01:37:08.629 --> 01:37:08.639 align:start position:0%
after the 153 coincidence the bottom
 
01:37:10.790 --> 01:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
line here folks is that
 
01:37:13.590 --> 01:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
we don't believe that our elections have
 
01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:14.790 align:start position:0%
we don't believe that our elections have
integrity

01:37:14.790 --> 01:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
integrity
 
01:37:16.709 --> 01:37:16.719 align:start position:0%
we have some problems
 
01:37:19.669 --> 01:37:19.679 align:start position:0%
and i can honestly say i think covert 19
 
01:37:21.189 --> 01:37:21.199 align:start position:0%
helped helped
 
01:37:23.189 --> 01:37:23.199 align:start position:0%
help expose that
 
01:37:25.109 --> 01:37:25.119 align:start position:0%
because we had a lot of time on our
 
01:37:27.990 --> 01:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
hands and we were watching closely
 
01:37:30.950 --> 01:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
number one number two the absentee the
 
01:37:34.390 --> 01:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot issue was huge in 2020.

01:38:04.239 --> 01:38:05.350 align:start position:0%
um
division

01:38:05.350 --> 01:38:05.360 align:start position:0%
division
 
01:38:06.709 --> 01:38:06.719 align:start position:0%
through the person the executive
 
01:38:09.430 --> 01:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
director they can request an absentee
 
01:38:11.590 --> 01:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
ballot via
 
01:38:13.750 --> 01:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
the executive director they get the
 
01:38:15.510 --> 01:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot
 
01:38:17.830 --> 01:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
they fill out their absentee ballot
 
01:38:20.149 --> 01:38:20.159 align:start position:0%
and the executive director now this is
 
01:38:21.990 --> 01:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
the only time
 
01:38:24.550 --> 01:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
that this is not controlled
 
01:38:27.750 --> 01:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
by our town clerk or any other kind of
 
01:38:30.070 --> 01:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
elective official
 
01:38:33.189 --> 01:38:33.199 align:start position:0%
the executive director is allowed to
 
01:38:35.669 --> 01:38:35.679 align:start position:0%
bring those ballots and they
 
01:38:38.470 --> 01:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
they actually sign saying i know for a
 
01:38:42.070 --> 01:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:44.070 --> 01:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
now we've heard we've heard secretary of
 
01:38:47.109 --> 01:38:47.119 align:start position:0%
state scanlan say i trust i trust that
 
01:38:49.109 --> 01:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
our elections don't we have some
 
01:38:51.430 --> 01:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
problems well if we have some problems
 
01:38:53.189 --> 01:38:53.199 align:start position:0%
how are we going to fix them unless we
 
01:38:55.430 --> 01:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
know exactly what they are that's what a
 
01:38:58.149 --> 01:38:58.159 align:start position:0%
forensic audit will do for us it'll
 
01:39:01.109 --> 01:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
provide the the learning opportunity to
 
01:39:03.910 --> 01:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
say this is what we've done wrong and
 
01:39:06.709 --> 01:39:06.719 align:start position:0%
this is what we need to change
 
01:39:09.510 --> 01:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
the you we are i feel very comfortable
 
01:39:11.590 --> 01:39:11.600 align:start position:0%
that the machines are problem they've
 
01:39:13.750 --> 01:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
always been a problem you can hack in
 
01:39:15.270 --> 01:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
anything if you can hack into the
 
01:39:17.669 --> 01:39:17.679 align:start position:0%
department of defense you can hack into
 
01:39:21.030 --> 01:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
lhs voting machines just saying
 
01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:21.990 align:start position:0%
lhs voting machines just saying
um

01:39:21.990 --> 01:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:24.470 --> 01:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
bottom line is is that the machines are
 
01:39:27.350 --> 01:39:27.360 align:start position:0%
a problem but there are hundreds of
 
01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:28.310 align:start position:0%
a problem but there are hundreds of
other

01:39:28.310 --> 01:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:39:30.550 --> 01:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
problems and outliers
 
01:39:33.590 --> 01:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
when do a hundred problems become
 
01:39:37.189 --> 01:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
something more than a coincidence
 
01:39:38.310 --> 01:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:39:40.550 --> 01:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
thank you miss chester also signed up to
 
01:39:48.709 --> 01:39:48.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:50.790 --> 01:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
so i'm actually going to speak to um i
 
01:39:52.070 --> 01:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
wasn't going to speak on this but i am
 
01:39:54.390 --> 01:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
because of what
 
01:39:56.229 --> 01:39:56.239 align:start position:0%
secretary of state recent secretary of
 
01:39:59.109 --> 01:39:59.119 align:start position:0%
state david scanlan said so if
 
01:40:02.629 --> 01:40:02.639 align:start position:0%
everything is you know we do a good job
 
01:40:06.470 --> 01:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire then why would
 
01:40:09.430 --> 01:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
former secretary of state bill gardner
 
01:40:11.030 --> 01:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
who has been the secretary of state for
 
01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:12.149 align:start position:0%
who has been the secretary of state for
decades

01:40:12.149 --> 01:40:12.159 align:start position:0%
decades
 
01:40:15.669 --> 01:40:15.679 align:start position:0%
send an 11-page letter
 
01:40:16.870 --> 01:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
which is
 
01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:18.149 align:start position:0%
which is
damning

01:40:18.149 --> 01:40:18.159 align:start position:0%
damning
 
01:40:21.030 --> 01:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
basically to the windham town officials
 
01:40:22.950 --> 01:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
saying and i'm just going to quote one
 
01:40:24.870 --> 01:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
paragraph in here
 
01:40:27.109 --> 01:40:27.119 align:start position:0%
wyndham's election night results were
 
01:40:29.030 --> 01:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
not just imprecise
 
01:40:31.669 --> 01:40:31.679 align:start position:0%
they were fundamentally flawed for an
 
01:40:34.470 --> 01:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
exhaustive review please see the report
 
01:40:36.709 --> 01:40:36.719 align:start position:0%
of the forensic audit team
 
01:40:39.669 --> 01:40:39.679 align:start position:0%
but simply put town election officials
 
01:40:41.109 --> 01:40:41.119 align:start position:0%
cut corners
 
01:40:43.430 --> 01:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
some of those shortcuts
 
01:40:46.229 --> 01:40:46.239 align:start position:0%
created errors such as using an
 
01:40:48.470 --> 01:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
uncalibrated folding machine
 
01:40:50.470 --> 01:40:50.480 align:start position:0%
which were unintentional and perhaps
 
01:40:53.830 --> 01:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
unforeseeable but ultimately resulted in
 
01:40:56.550 --> 01:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
ballots not being accurately counted
 
01:40:59.750 --> 01:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
other errors such as the use of only six
 
01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:00.629 align:start position:0%
other errors such as the use of only six
test

01:41:00.629 --> 01:41:00.639 align:start position:0%
test
 
01:41:01.990 --> 01:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
test ballots
 
01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:03.109 align:start position:0%
test ballots
instead

01:41:03.109 --> 01:41:03.119 align:start position:0%
instead
 
01:41:05.430 --> 01:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
of the recommended 50
 
01:41:08.709 --> 01:41:08.719 align:start position:0%
ignored legal obligations and are of
 
01:41:10.950 --> 01:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
continuing concern as they are
 
01:41:13.590 --> 01:41:13.600 align:start position:0%
indicative of an election that was not
 
01:41:17.109 --> 01:41:17.119 align:start position:0%
executed to the standard of the law or
 
01:41:19.669 --> 01:41:19.679 align:start position:0%
expectations of voters
 
01:41:22.390 --> 01:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
this is an 11 page letter you should all
 
01:41:25.910 --> 01:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
have a copy of that do you
 
01:41:27.830 --> 01:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
you do wonderful
 
01:41:29.350 --> 01:41:29.360 align:start position:0%
that alone
 
01:41:31.590 --> 01:41:31.600 align:start position:0%
demands an audit
 
01:41:33.109 --> 01:41:33.119 align:start position:0%
i don't you know if it's not going to be
 
01:41:35.830 --> 01:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
the whole state then merrimack county
 
01:41:37.189 --> 01:41:37.199 align:start position:0%
right there
 
01:41:39.350 --> 01:41:39.360 align:start position:0%
pick a town
 
01:41:41.750 --> 01:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
that's all we need is a town rockingham
 
01:41:43.750 --> 01:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
county had really lots of problems so if
 
01:41:45.669 --> 01:41:45.679 align:start position:0%
you want to talk about rye
 
01:41:47.910 --> 01:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
waterville valley hmm who owns
 
01:41:50.149 --> 01:41:50.159 align:start position:0%
waterville valley isn't there a ski area
 
01:41:52.870 --> 01:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
there yeah we all know who that's uh
 
01:41:56.070 --> 01:41:56.080 align:start position:0%
connected with as well as look at derry
 
01:41:59.430 --> 01:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
how about milford milford folds just so
 
01:42:02.229 --> 01:42:02.239 align:start position:0%
you know milford overvotes i believe
 
01:42:04.629 --> 01:42:04.639 align:start position:0%
that a state rep that was a republican
 
01:42:07.030 --> 01:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
actually missed his missed his calling
 
01:42:08.629 --> 01:42:08.639 align:start position:0%
here because of that look at the
 
01:42:11.189 --> 01:42:11.199 align:start position:0%
overvotes of milford it's unbelievable
 
01:42:13.750 --> 01:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
there's too many and actually a democrat
 
01:42:15.430 --> 01:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
got that seat
 
01:42:18.149 --> 01:42:18.159 align:start position:0%
but when we tried to look at auditing
 
01:42:20.149 --> 01:42:20.159 align:start position:0%
just on an outside version
 
01:42:23.430 --> 01:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
milford's town tapes were packaged in
 
01:42:25.030 --> 01:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
the ballots that were sent to the
 
01:42:27.030 --> 01:42:27.040 align:start position:0%
secretary of state and we didn't have
 
01:42:29.750 --> 01:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
access to those tapes which is against
 
01:42:32.550 --> 01:42:32.560 align:start position:0%
the law we can go on and on and on so
 
01:42:35.030 --> 01:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
for him to stand up there and say oh
 
01:42:38.629 --> 01:42:38.639 align:start position:0%
well we had some problems bedford uh you
 
01:42:41.030 --> 01:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
know windham what about merrimack new
 
01:42:42.790 --> 01:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire want to talk about those
 
01:42:46.550 --> 01:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
problems at about 5 p.m or 6 p.m over a
 
01:42:49.430 --> 01:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
thousand ballots came in
 
01:42:51.590 --> 01:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
that weren't there that were supposedly
 
01:42:53.109 --> 01:42:53.119 align:start position:0%
just found
 
01:42:55.350 --> 01:42:55.360 align:start position:0%
that's been reported all of these things
 
01:42:57.430 --> 01:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
too when he says that have been reported
 
01:43:00.550 --> 01:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
to the ag i reported a ton of stuff from
 
01:43:03.109 --> 01:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
rye my husband was a poll watcher i was
 
01:43:05.030 --> 01:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
a poll watcher i reported it to the new
 
01:43:07.990 --> 01:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire gop fraud i reported all of
 
01:43:09.990 --> 01:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
this kind of stuff i had people that
 
01:43:12.629 --> 01:43:12.639 align:start position:0%
were from california with a license
 
01:43:15.030 --> 01:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
voting and i'm challenging it but you
 
01:43:17.669 --> 01:43:17.679 align:start position:0%
have to stay like you know 12 feet away
 
01:43:19.590 --> 01:43:19.600 align:start position:0%
everybody's all concerned about a mask
 
01:43:22.390 --> 01:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
they don't really care about anything
 
01:43:24.390 --> 01:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
so all of these things were reported and
 
01:43:27.109 --> 01:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
have been reported for years
 
01:43:29.350 --> 01:43:29.360 align:start position:0%
the busloads of people coming in so for
 
01:43:31.910 --> 01:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
us to act like nothing's just been done
 
01:43:34.070 --> 01:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
that's the problem nothing's been done
 
01:43:36.390 --> 01:43:36.400 align:start position:0%
nothing's been investigated so this is
 
01:43:39.030 --> 01:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
this is the ag and this goes back this
 
01:43:40.629 --> 01:43:40.639 align:start position:0%
isn't just gordon mcdonald which is now
 
01:43:42.550 --> 01:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
the chief justice of the new hampshire
 
01:43:44.629 --> 01:43:44.639 align:start position:0%
supreme court that was
 
01:43:45.830 --> 01:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
put in there
 
01:43:48.070 --> 01:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
by governor sununu so
 
01:43:49.590 --> 01:43:49.600 align:start position:0%
we're talking about being rigged from
 
01:43:53.510 --> 01:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
within these aren't made up things
 
01:43:55.750 --> 01:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
all of the reports to the ag all of the
 
01:43:57.510 --> 01:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
reports the secretary of state have
 
01:43:59.350 --> 01:43:59.360 align:start position:0%
fallen on deaf ears look at project
 
01:44:01.830 --> 01:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
veritas they had to uncover some of the
 
01:44:04.629 --> 01:44:04.639 align:start position:0%

send it by email to me and that is
 
01:46:38.229 --> 01:46:38.239 align:start position:0%
against the law
 
01:46:40.550 --> 01:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
i also found that several towns did not
 
01:46:43.189 --> 01:46:43.199 align:start position:0%
know what certain forms that were being
 
01:46:45.030 --> 01:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
asked for
 
01:46:47.990 --> 01:46:48.000 align:start position:0%

01:47:03.350 --> 01:47:03.360 align:start position:0%
legible
 
01:47:05.750 --> 01:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
due to the ink or fading
 
01:47:09.830 --> 01:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
one town to this day after many emails
 
01:47:12.390 --> 01:47:12.400 align:start position:0%

the financial director
 
01:47:16.229 --> 01:47:16.239 align:start position:0%
have not submitted
 
01:47:19.189 --> 01:47:19.199 align:start position:0%
the town's financial data having to do
 
01:47:21.270 --> 01:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
with election costs

from the year
 
01:47:27.430 --> 01:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:29.750 --> 01:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
another town did not have their official
 
01:47:33.750 --> 01:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
moderator worksheets reconciling voters
 
01:47:33.760 --> 01:47:35.270 align:start position:0%
moderator worksheets reconciling voters
and

01:47:35.270 --> 01:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:47:37.990 --> 01:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
votes and ballots casts
 
01:47:40.229 --> 01:47:40.239 align:start position:0%
they also did not have the moderator
 
01:47:40.239 --> 01:47:41.510 align:start position:0%
they also did not have the moderator
certificate

01:47:41.510 --> 01:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
certificate
 
01:47:43.430 --> 01:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
when asked where they were they said
 
01:47:46.709 --> 01:47:46.719 align:start position:0%
that they had sent them to the state
 
01:47:48.149 --> 01:47:48.159 align:start position:0%
in summary
 
01:47:50.390 --> 01:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
there is a total lack
 
01:47:52.229 --> 01:47:52.239 align:start position:0%
of transparency
 
01:47:55.270 --> 01:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
in the voting system in this state
 
01:47:58.709 --> 01:47:58.719 align:start position:0%
this state needs a full forensic audit
 
01:48:01.669 --> 01:48:01.679 align:start position:0%
that looks at the entire
 
01:48:01.679 --> 01:48:03.350 align:start position:0%
that looks at the entire
process

01:48:03.350 --> 01:48:03.360 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:48:05.109 --> 01:48:05.119 align:start position:0%
of voting
 
01:48:07.430 --> 01:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire voters need to have
 
01:48:11.350 --> 01:48:11.360 align:start position:0%
integrity in the voting process again
 
01:48:14.109 --> 01:48:14.119 align:start position:0%
i support house bill
 
01:48:19.109 --> 01:48:19.119 align:start position:0%
1473 and ask that you pass this bill
 
01:48:23.270 --> 01:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:24.790 --> 01:48:24.800 align:start position:0%
thank you miss pitts i don't see any
 
01:48:26.470 --> 01:48:26.480 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
01:48:38.229 --> 01:48:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:41.350 --> 01:48:41.360 align:start position:0%
i'm karen thoman i'm from nashua
 
01:48:43.030 --> 01:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
and a lot of
 
01:48:45.189 --> 01:48:45.199 align:start position:0%
what i was going to bring up today is
 
01:48:46.790 --> 01:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
already been said
 
01:48:49.590 --> 01:48:49.600 align:start position:0%
and my concern is with the quality of
 
01:48:53.189 --> 01:48:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:54.229 --> 01:48:54.239 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:48:57.030 --> 01:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
city of nashua
 
01:48:57.040 --> 01:48:58.310 align:start position:0%
city of nashua
it's

01:48:58.310 --> 01:48:58.320 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:49:00.390 --> 01:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
we have a huge problem with the same day
 
01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:02.550 align:start position:0%
we have a huge problem with the same day
registrations

01:49:02.550 --> 01:49:02.560 align:start position:0%
registrations
 
01:49:05.510 --> 01:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
i say it's a problem because
 
01:49:07.430 --> 01:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
thousands of people
 
01:49:12.390 --> 01:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:14.550 --> 01:49:14.560 align:start position:0%
we paid the city clerk for the new voter
 
01:49:17.030 --> 01:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
checklist which i have one here from
 
01:49:19.030 --> 01:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
ward two
 
01:49:20.790 --> 01:49:20.800 align:start position:0%
uh that contains all the names and
 
01:49:23.430 --> 01:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
addresses of the same day registrants
 
01:49:25.430 --> 01:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
and typed them into excel sheets so we
 
01:49:27.030 --> 01:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
could compare them
 
01:49:27.040 --> 01:49:31.189 align:start position:0%
could compare them
easily

01:49:31.189 --> 01:49:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:31.199 --> 01:49:32.070 align:start position:0%
 
people

01:49:32.070 --> 01:49:32.080 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:49:34.550 --> 01:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
that were registered in the wrong world
 
01:49:37.510 --> 01:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
ward showed up in every single ward
 
01:49:39.430 --> 01:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
so that meant the people doing the
 
01:49:41.350 --> 01:49:41.360 align:start position:0%
registrations weren't checking the
 
01:49:42.950 --> 01:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
street lists
 
01:49:45.430 --> 01:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
and allowing just anybody to walk in and
 
01:49:45.440 --> 01:49:48.870 align:start position:0%
and allowing just anybody to walk in and
register

01:49:48.870 --> 01:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:52.390 --> 01:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
people were registering from hotels
 
01:49:55.510 --> 01:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
people regis a person registered from a
 
01:49:58.470 --> 01:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
dentist office
 
01:50:01.270 --> 01:50:01.280 align:start position:0%
on daniel webster highway
 
01:50:03.669 --> 01:50:03.679 align:start position:0%
in a street that is so should be so
 
01:50:05.669 --> 01:50:05.679 align:start position:0%
familiar to every single person in
 
01:50:09.030 --> 01:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
nashua because it's taggart street
 
01:50:11.910 --> 01:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
and that is where our big ice
 
01:50:14.470 --> 01:50:14.480 align:start position:0%
factory is you know we get ice up down
 
01:50:17.350 --> 01:50:17.360 align:start position:0%
there everybody knows taggart street
 
01:50:19.750 --> 01:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
and they let this guy vote
 
01:50:27.990 --> 01:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:29.589 --> 01:50:29.599 align:start position:0%
so then we
 
01:50:31.030 --> 01:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
we got
 
01:50:33.830 --> 01:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
actually i went to city hall
 
01:50:36.390 --> 01:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
because i wanted to verify a lot of the
 
01:50:39.430 --> 01:50:39.440 align:start position:0%
absentee votes that were happening
 
01:50:42.310 --> 01:50:42.320 align:start position:0%
and i had questions to the city clerk
 
01:50:45.109 --> 01:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
which the response i got was
 
01:50:47.830 --> 01:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not answering questions don't ask me
 
01:50:47.840 --> 01:50:49.030 align:start position:0%
i'm not answering questions don't ask me
questions

01:50:49.030 --> 01:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:50:51.270 --> 01:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
if you want to come and view
 
01:50:54.390 --> 01:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
the voter checklist for that day you can
 
01:50:56.629 --> 01:50:56.639 align:start position:0%

01:50:56.639 --> 01:50:58.070 align:start position:0%
come in and view it
so

01:50:58.070 --> 01:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:51:00.550 --> 01:51:00.560 align:start position:0%
i actually took pictures of every single
 
01:51:00.560 --> 01:51:02.149 align:start position:0%
i actually took pictures of every single
page

01:51:02.149 --> 01:51:02.159 align:start position:0%
page
 
01:51:04.870 --> 01:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
and i have thousands of pictures
 
01:51:04.880 --> 01:51:06.470 align:start position:0%
and i have thousands of pictures
stored

01:51:06.470 --> 01:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
stored
 
01:51:10.310 --> 01:51:10.320 align:start position:0%
from every from all nine wards
 
01:51:14.550 --> 01:51:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:16.470 --> 01:51:16.480 align:start position:0%
there were
 
01:51:18.830 --> 01:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
pages and pages
 
01:51:21.189 --> 01:51:21.199 align:start position:0%
of i would
 
01:51:23.030 --> 01:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
that that might be an exaggeration let's
 
01:51:25.430 --> 01:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
say there was five pages
 
01:51:27.270 --> 01:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
and during the pre-processing of
 
01:51:29.910 --> 01:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots they got together in
 
01:51:31.350 --> 01:51:31.360 align:start position:0%
the school gym
 
01:51:34.470 --> 01:51:34.480 align:start position:0%
and they highlighted everybody that had
 
01:51:37.030 --> 01:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
returned an absentee ballot so on
 
01:51:39.189 --> 01:51:39.199 align:start position:0%
election day
 
01:51:40.870 --> 01:51:40.880 align:start position:0%
all those people were highlighted
 
01:51:43.189 --> 01:51:43.199 align:start position:0%
knowing that oh there's an absentee
 
01:51:45.430 --> 01:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
ballot somewhere don't come in and vote
 
01:51:47.189 --> 01:51:47.199 align:start position:0%
so they could tell them that you know we
 
01:51:49.990 --> 01:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
already got it go home
 
01:51:51.669 --> 01:51:51.679 align:start position:0%
there were there were at least five
 
01:51:51.679 --> 01:51:53.189 align:start position:0%
there were there were at least five
pages

01:51:53.189 --> 01:51:53.199 align:start position:0%
pages
 
01:51:56.310 --> 01:51:56.320 align:start position:0%
on the checklist in ward two
 
01:51:56.320 --> 01:51:58.709 align:start position:0%
on the checklist in ward two
that

01:51:58.709 --> 01:51:58.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:00.830 --> 01:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
the process is
 
01:52:05.030 --> 01:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
you you check the little check box
 
01:52:06.790 --> 01:52:06.800 align:start position:0%
you cross out the name and then you
 
01:52:08.390 --> 01:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
write av
 
01:52:11.350 --> 01:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
for absentee vote in red
 
01:52:13.750 --> 01:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
next to that entry
 
01:52:16.790 --> 01:52:16.800 align:start position:0%
so there was all kinds of avs written
 
01:52:20.550 --> 01:52:20.560 align:start position:0%
but never checked and never crossed out
 
01:52:22.629 --> 01:52:22.639 align:start position:0%
is that a vote
 
01:52:25.510 --> 01:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
can i i can't even go to my city clerk
 
01:52:27.990 --> 01:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
and say are these votes because i'm not
 
01:52:30.950 --> 01:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
allowed to ask questions
 
01:52:33.430 --> 01:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
how do i verify this
 
01:52:36.229 --> 01:52:36.239 align:start position:0%
there are so many things wrong that are
 
01:52:39.030 --> 01:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
happening there it's
 
01:52:41.510 --> 01:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
one by one they're little but add them
 
01:52:42.830 --> 01:52:42.840 align:start position:0%
up and it's a
 
01:52:45.189 --> 01:52:45.199 align:start position:0%
mountain the other thing i want to say
 
01:52:46.870 --> 01:52:46.880 align:start position:0%
about the
 
01:52:48.709 --> 01:52:48.719 align:start position:0%
the voting machines is
 
01:52:50.149 --> 01:52:50.159 align:start position:0%
in nashua
 
01:52:51.669 --> 01:52:51.679 align:start position:0%
we get together
 
01:52:51.679 --> 01:52:52.709 align:start position:0%
we get together
we

01:52:52.709 --> 01:52:52.719 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:52:54.709 --> 01:52:54.719 align:start position:0%
everybody calls in they tell we tell
 
01:52:56.149 --> 01:52:56.159 align:start position:0%
each other what the
 
01:52:57.750 --> 01:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
count is
 
01:53:00.470 --> 01:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
we went to taking pictures of the tapes
 
01:53:02.070 --> 01:53:02.080 align:start position:0%
many years ago
 
01:53:04.470 --> 01:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
because it was much easier to text a
 
01:53:04.480 --> 01:53:05.510 align:start position:0%
because it was much easier to text a
picture

01:53:05.510 --> 01:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
picture
 
01:53:08.550 --> 01:53:08.560 align:start position:0%
than to call and say numbers so i have
 
01:53:10.790 --> 01:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
years we have years and years of
 
01:53:12.390 --> 01:53:12.400 align:start position:0%
pictures of tapes
 
01:53:15.270 --> 01:53:15.280 align:start position:0%
and the thing i noticed this year
 
01:53:17.990 --> 01:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
was the download version of the software
 
01:53:21.270 --> 01:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
on some of the machines is different
 
01:53:23.750 --> 01:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
and that's a problem i think
 
01:53:26.950 --> 01:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
something's wrong
 
01:53:26.960 --> 01:53:27.990 align:start position:0%
something's wrong
okay

01:53:27.990 --> 01:53:28.000 align:start position:0%

state
 
01:54:19.750 --> 01:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
and most of all
 
01:54:19.760 --> 01:54:20.830 align:start position:0%
and most of all
my

01:54:20.830 --> 01:54:20.840 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:54:23.189 --> 01:54:23.199 align:start position:0%
grandchildren my father was a world war
 
01:54:25.189 --> 01:54:25.199 align:start position:0%
ii fighter pilot in the pacific and a
 
01:54:26.709 --> 01:54:26.719 align:start position:0%
lot of american blood was shed to
 
01:54:28.310 --> 01:54:28.320 align:start position:0%
protect our freedom
 
01:54:32.310 --> 01:54:32.320 align:start position:0%
and most importantly our sacred vote
 
01:54:33.910 --> 01:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
upon learning that rye had something
 
01:54:36.950 --> 01:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
like 120 percent of eligible voters
 
01:54:36.960 --> 01:54:38.709 align:start position:0%
like 120 percent of eligible voters
registered

01:54:38.709 --> 01:54:38.719 align:start position:0%
registered
 
01:54:41.350 --> 01:54:41.360 align:start position:0%
120 percent of eligible voters
 
01:54:44.149 --> 01:54:44.159 align:start position:0%
registered i had to see if this was true
 
01:54:45.990 --> 01:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
so i spent some time knocking on doors
 
01:54:48.470 --> 01:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
asking a few questions
 
01:54:50.470 --> 01:54:50.480 align:start position:0%
did you vote in the 2020 presidential
 
01:54:50.480 --> 01:54:52.310 align:start position:0%
did you vote in the 2020 presidential
election

01:54:52.310 --> 01:54:52.320 align:start position:0%
election
 
01:54:53.510 --> 01:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
i did not
 
01:54:55.430 --> 01:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
want to know who they voted for but i
 
01:54:56.950 --> 01:54:56.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to verify
 
01:54:59.189 --> 01:54:59.199 align:start position:0%
that the voter logs were accurate
 
01:55:01.189 --> 01:55:01.199 align:start position:0%
of the homes that i was able to contact
 
01:55:05.350 --> 01:55:05.360 align:start position:0%
more than 10 percent of them had issues
 
01:55:07.430 --> 01:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
i had a home on central avenue where
 
01:55:09.270 --> 01:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
both husband and wife did not vote in
 
01:55:10.950 --> 01:55:10.960 align:start position:0%
2020 elections
 
01:55:13.510 --> 01:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
yet the official voter checklist showed
 
01:55:16.070 --> 01:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
they voted absentee
 
01:55:18.310 --> 01:55:18.320 align:start position:0%
they were in shock and they thanked me
 
01:55:18.320 --> 01:55:19.030 align:start position:0%
they were in shock and they thanked me
for

01:55:19.030 --> 01:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:55:22.229 --> 01:55:22.239 align:start position:0%
helping to correct the situation
 
01:55:25.030 --> 01:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
another home i visited had four people
 
01:55:27.750 --> 01:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
voted absentee from that address
 
01:55:29.510 --> 01:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
the problem is there's only one person
 
01:55:31.669 --> 01:55:31.679 align:start position:0%
that lived there
 
01:55:33.430 --> 01:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
there are even votes from property
 
01:55:35.750 --> 01:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
addresses that didn't exist
 
01:55:38.470 --> 01:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
in the town of rye how is this even
 
01:55:38.480 --> 01:55:41.109 align:start position:0%
in the town of rye how is this even
possible

01:55:41.109 --> 01:55:41.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:43.350 --> 01:55:43.360 align:start position:0%
the majority of both democrats and
 
01:55:45.270 --> 01:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
republicans alike don't trust our
 
01:55:45.280 --> 01:55:46.550 align:start position:0%
republicans alike don't trust our
elections

01:55:46.550 --> 01:55:46.560 align:start position:0%
elections
 
01:55:47.990 --> 01:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
you guys
 
01:55:49.830 --> 01:55:49.840 align:start position:0%
can fix this
 
01:55:52.709 --> 01:55:52.719 align:start position:0%
as you're probably aware lhs associates
 
01:55:54.229 --> 01:55:54.239 align:start position:0%
is a privately owned company that
 
01:55:56.790 --> 01:55:56.800 align:start position:0%
programs over 80 percent
 
01:55:58.790 --> 01:55:58.800 align:start position:0%
of the new hampshire election
 
01:56:01.430 --> 01:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
via their accubote dibol dominion
 
01:56:01.440 --> 01:56:03.589 align:start position:0%
via their accubote dibol dominion
machines

01:56:03.589 --> 01:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
machines
 
01:56:05.990 --> 01:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
lhs services these machines the
 
01:56:09.669 --> 01:56:09.679 align:start position:0%
microchips and memory data cards
 
01:56:12.790 --> 01:56:12.800 align:start position:0%
they operate independently without any
 
01:56:15.830 --> 01:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
state oversight or audits by the state
 
01:56:17.830 --> 01:56:17.840 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire the secretary of state
 
01:56:20.870 --> 01:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
or the department of justice
 
01:56:24.709 --> 01:56:24.719 align:start position:0%
the lhs technology in my town is over 20
 
01:56:26.229 --> 01:56:26.239 align:start position:0%
years old
 
01:56:29.350 --> 01:56:29.360 align:start position:0%
is this really the best we can do
 
01:56:31.350 --> 01:56:31.360 align:start position:0%
so i went to see my local town clerk to
 
01:56:34.229 --> 01:56:34.239 align:start position:0%
learn more she actually initially seemed
 
01:56:36.070 --> 01:56:36.080 align:start position:0%
willing to help she showed me where the
 
01:56:38.550 --> 01:56:38.560 align:start position:0%
accu vote machines were locked up in the
 
01:56:43.030 --> 01:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:46.629 --> 01:56:46.639 align:start position:0%
so so i went on to uh
 
01:56:48.310 --> 01:56:48.320 align:start position:0%
she went on to state that these machines
 
01:56:50.149 --> 01:56:50.159 align:start position:0%
were purchased before her arrival which
 
01:56:50.159 --> 01:56:51.589 align:start position:0%
were purchased before her arrival which
was

01:56:51.589 --> 01:56:51.599 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:56:54.629 --> 01:56:54.639 align:start position:0%
almost 18 years ago right
 
01:56:56.229 --> 01:56:56.239 align:start position:0%
when i told my town clerk about all the
 
01:56:57.910 --> 01:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
voter registration issues that i had
 
01:56:59.830 --> 01:56:59.840 align:start position:0%
heard about in rice she said oh yeah
 
01:57:01.350 --> 01:57:01.360 align:start position:0%
they've got all kinds of problems going
 
01:57:03.669 --> 01:57:03.679 align:start position:0%
on in that town
 
01:57:05.589 --> 01:57:05.599 align:start position:0%
i returned a few days later and asked
 
01:57:07.669 --> 01:57:07.679 align:start position:0%

devices
 
01:57:16.229 --> 01:57:16.239 align:start position:0%
i also wanted a copy of the purchase
 
01:57:18.310 --> 01:57:18.320 align:start position:0%
contract and service agreement for the
 
01:57:21.830 --> 01:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
lhs dominion machine
 
01:57:24.310 --> 01:57:24.320 align:start position:0%
i gave her this request in person on
 
01:57:26.470 --> 01:57:26.480 align:start position:0%
december 21st
 
01:57:28.470 --> 01:57:28.480 align:start position:0%
it was during the christmas holiday time
 
01:57:29.830 --> 01:57:29.840 align:start position:0%
so she said give me a couple of weeks
 
01:57:32.470 --> 01:57:32.480 align:start position:0%
and i'll get you all the information
 
01:57:35.430 --> 01:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
so after two weeks i called her back
 
01:57:37.270 --> 01:57:37.280 align:start position:0%
she's now telling me i'm going to be so
 
01:57:39.830 --> 01:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
busy i can't get back to your request
 
01:57:41.910 --> 01:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
for several months now
 
01:57:43.830 --> 01:57:43.840 align:start position:0%
i'm just one citizen i have a right to
 
01:57:45.350 --> 01:57:45.360 align:start position:0%
know law i want to see what's going on
 
01:57:47.830 --> 01:57:47.840 align:start position:0%
in my town and i'm stonewalled
 
01:57:49.270 --> 01:57:49.280 align:start position:0%
what can i do do i get to go to my
 
01:57:50.950 --> 01:57:50.960 align:start position:0%
selectum do i come to you guys well i
 
01:57:53.510 --> 01:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
don't even know where to go
 
01:57:55.350 --> 01:57:55.360 align:start position:0%
i don't trust nor do i have any
 
01:57:58.470 --> 01:57:58.480 align:start position:0%
confidence in the current voting system
 
01:58:00.790 --> 01:58:00.800 align:start position:0%
why is there no post election audit in
 
01:58:04.870 --> 01:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:06.790 --> 01:58:06.800 align:start position:0%
it's because there's no legislation
 
01:58:09.430 --> 01:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
directing any of our talents to do so
 
01:58:11.109 --> 01:58:11.119 align:start position:0%
but this is where you guys can come in
 
01:58:12.950 --> 01:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
and make a difference
 
01:58:14.950 --> 01:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
you know you're in this hall
 
01:58:16.550 --> 01:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
with these amazing people that have been
 
01:58:18.310 --> 01:58:18.320 align:start position:0%
here and you guys
 
01:58:21.189 --> 01:58:21.199 align:start position:0%
have the ability to install change
 
01:58:22.390 --> 01:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
and i think you should take that
 
01:58:22.400 --> 01:58:24.229 align:start position:0%
and i think you should take that
seriously

01:58:24.229 --> 01:58:24.239 align:start position:0%
seriously
 
01:58:25.990 --> 01:58:26.000 align:start position:0%
the only way to know what needs to be
 
01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:27.030 align:start position:0%
the only way to know what needs to be
fixed

01:58:27.030 --> 01:58:27.040 align:start position:0%
fixed
 
01:58:29.669 --> 01:58:29.679 align:start position:0%
is to do a statewide forensic audit
 
01:58:31.510 --> 01:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
and to put in future safeguards so that
 
01:58:33.030 --> 01:58:33.040 align:start position:0%
this monopoly on voting machine
 
01:58:34.790 --> 01:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
programming does not continue to go
 
01:58:34.800 --> 01:58:36.470 align:start position:0%
programming does not continue to go
unchecked

01:58:36.470 --> 01:58:36.480 align:start position:0%
unchecked
 
01:58:38.790 --> 01:58:38.800 align:start position:0%
or what i would personally like to see
 
01:58:40.470 --> 01:58:40.480 align:start position:0%
is for us to get rid of all the machines
 
01:58:43.109 --> 01:58:43.119 align:start position:0%
and go back to hand counting
 
01:58:45.270 --> 01:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
that's what canada does great britain
 
01:58:46.830 --> 01:58:46.840 align:start position:0%
france and
 
01:58:49.350 --> 01:58:49.360 align:start position:0%
australia however i am concerned about
 
01:58:51.669 --> 01:58:51.679 align:start position:0%
how the windham audit was conducted and
 
01:58:53.109 --> 01:58:53.119 align:start position:0%
who was involved
 
01:58:54.870 --> 01:58:54.880 align:start position:0%
i ask that you all support the proposed
 
01:58:58.310 --> 01:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
house bill 1473 to restore confidence
 
01:58:59.669 --> 01:58:59.679 align:start position:0%
in the people
 
01:59:01.189 --> 01:59:01.199 align:start position:0%
you have nothing to lose and everything
 
01:59:03.270 --> 01:59:03.280 align:start position:0%
to gain
 
01:59:04.470 --> 01:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
we must
 
01:59:07.350 --> 01:59:07.360 align:start position:0%
and you must restore voting integrity
 
01:59:08.310 --> 01:59:08.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:59:10.709 --> 01:59:10.719 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions
 
01:59:14.229 --> 01:59:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:21.270 --> 01:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:24.149 --> 01:59:24.159 align:start position:0%
jill shaw jill shaw will be next
 
01:59:28.830 --> 01:59:28.840 align:start position:0%

so a couple different things personal
experiences

01:59:58.310 --> 01:59:58.320 align:start position:0%
experiences
 
02:00:01.350 --> 02:00:01.360 align:start position:0%
i have a daughter who's in her 30s who
 
02:00:02.870 --> 02:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
was running
 
02:00:05.189 --> 02:00:05.199 align:start position:0%
with the 2020 election so i spent a lot
 
02:00:06.709 --> 02:00:06.719 align:start position:0%
of time
 
02:00:09.669 --> 02:00:09.679 align:start position:0%
standing out with her banner and
 
02:00:11.270 --> 02:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
canvassing my neighborhoods different
 
02:00:13.189 --> 02:00:13.199 align:start position:0%
things in my towns
 
02:00:16.629 --> 02:00:16.639 align:start position:0%
that are local to me where she would be
 
02:00:20.229 --> 02:00:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:20.239 --> 02:00:21.030 align:start position:0%
 
i

02:00:21.030 --> 02:00:21.040 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:00:22.149 --> 02:00:22.159 align:start position:0%
did this
 
02:00:22.159 --> 02:00:23.910 align:start position:0%
did this
and

02:00:23.910 --> 02:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:00:27.669 --> 02:00:27.679 align:start position:0%
i realized that
 
02:00:30.629 --> 02:00:30.639 align:start position:0%
the day of election i went to
 
02:00:33.030 --> 02:00:33.040 align:start position:0%
she belongs to the town i reside in and
 
02:00:35.750 --> 02:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
she also represents a ward in another
 
02:00:35.760 --> 02:00:37.270 align:start position:0%
she also represents a ward in another
town

02:00:37.270 --> 02:00:37.280 align:start position:0%
town
 
02:00:37.280 --> 02:00:38.709 align:start position:0%
town
so

02:00:38.709 --> 02:00:38.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:00:40.470 --> 02:00:40.480 align:start position:0%
i go to both
 
02:00:43.350 --> 02:00:43.360 align:start position:0%
polling places because or voting places
 
02:00:47.030 --> 02:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
because i want to see and help her and
 
02:00:48.629 --> 02:00:48.639 align:start position:0%
be present
 
02:00:51.189 --> 02:00:51.199 align:start position:0%
as i'm doing this i'm watching the
 
02:00:51.199 --> 02:00:52.629 align:start position:0%
as i'm doing this i'm watching the
citizens

02:00:52.629 --> 02:00:52.639 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
02:00:54.709 --> 02:00:54.719 align:start position:0%
who voted for all you all by the way so
 
02:00:56.950 --> 02:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
you got here somehow and i would think
 
02:00:59.750 --> 02:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
voter integrity matters to you as well
 
02:00:59.760 --> 02:01:01.589 align:start position:0%
voter integrity matters to you as well
but

02:01:01.589 --> 02:01:01.599 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:01:01.599 --> 02:01:02.790 align:start position:0%
but
she

02:01:02.790 --> 02:01:02.800 align:start position:0%
she
 
02:01:04.870 --> 02:01:04.880 align:start position:0%
as i'm noticing the citizens they are
 
02:01:06.470 --> 02:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
paying attention to the signs i'm
 
02:01:06.480 --> 02:01:08.709 align:start position:0%
paying attention to the signs i'm
holding

02:01:08.709 --> 02:01:08.719 align:start position:0%
holding
 
02:01:11.350 --> 02:01:11.360 align:start position:0%
and the party that she's
 
02:01:12.709 --> 02:01:12.719 align:start position:0%
tagged to
 
02:01:14.070 --> 02:01:14.080 align:start position:0%
and they're
 
02:01:16.709 --> 02:01:16.719 align:start position:0%
coming out kind of gesturing or
 
02:01:19.030 --> 02:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
commenting to me about
 
02:01:21.750 --> 02:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
how they voted
 
02:01:23.270 --> 02:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
both towns
 
02:01:25.669 --> 02:01:25.679 align:start position:0%
so i go home that night after she gets
 
02:01:27.669 --> 02:01:27.679 align:start position:0%
her results
 
02:01:31.750 --> 02:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
and i say to my husband it was an 80 20
 
02:01:34.070 --> 02:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
in our favor
 
02:01:35.189 --> 02:01:35.199 align:start position:0%
mind you
 
02:01:37.270 --> 02:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
i'm an independent voter have been my
 
02:01:39.189 --> 02:01:39.199 align:start position:0%
whole life i've been voting since i was
 
02:01:41.750 --> 02:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
18. i came off the mayflower
 
02:01:44.310 --> 02:01:44.320 align:start position:0%
i have abraham lincoln as a descendant
 
02:01:47.030 --> 02:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
i'm a descendant of abraham lincoln my i
 
02:01:50.629 --> 02:01:50.639 align:start position:0%
can d.a.r all that stuff
 
02:01:52.390 --> 02:01:52.400 align:start position:0%
voting matters
 
02:01:53.830 --> 02:01:53.840 align:start position:0%
and it's what
 
02:01:57.189 --> 02:01:57.199 align:start position:0%
our country stands behind
 
02:01:57.199 --> 02:01:58.390 align:start position:0%
our country stands behind
so

02:01:58.390 --> 02:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:02:00.629 --> 02:02:00.639 align:start position:0%
she wins the election but i tell my
 
02:02:06.229 --> 02:02:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:08.390 --> 02:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
i go and i pay attention to the numbers
 
02:02:10.629 --> 02:02:10.639 align:start position:0%
as they come through and i take pictures
 
02:02:13.030 --> 02:02:13.040 align:start position:0%
i still have them on my computer of the
 
02:02:15.830 --> 02:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
different towns around me and how their
 
02:02:17.189 --> 02:02:17.199 align:start position:0%
numbers looked
 
02:02:20.310 --> 02:02:20.320 align:start position:0%
mind you my town has no machine
 
02:02:22.709 --> 02:02:22.719 align:start position:0%
i'm grateful for that i don't think
 
02:02:25.030 --> 02:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
machines should be but the ward where
 
02:02:28.470 --> 02:02:28.480 align:start position:0%
she her other ward is does have machines
 
02:02:30.709 --> 02:02:30.719 align:start position:0%
she still won and her numbers were good
 
02:02:33.830 --> 02:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
out of that town but
 
02:02:36.709 --> 02:02:36.719 align:start position:0%
it just kind of showed me
 
02:02:36.719 --> 02:02:37.510 align:start position:0%
it just kind of showed me
the

02:02:37.510 --> 02:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:02:39.669 --> 02:02:39.679 align:start position:0%
towns that were around me and what their
 
02:02:41.510 --> 02:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
numbers looked like
 
02:02:43.990 --> 02:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
to me it seemed a little odd
 
02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:44.709 align:start position:0%
to me it seemed a little odd
but

02:02:44.709 --> 02:02:44.719 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:02:47.430 --> 02:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
in some of these but i didn't you know
 
02:02:49.189 --> 02:02:49.199 align:start position:0%
what am i going to do about it
 
02:02:50.550 --> 02:02:50.560 align:start position:0%
so then
 
02:02:52.790 --> 02:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
my daughter says mom
 
02:02:54.070 --> 02:02:54.080 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
02:02:56.070 --> 02:02:56.080 align:start position:0%
our county committee
 
02:02:58.229 --> 02:02:58.239 align:start position:0%
you need to run
 
02:02:58.239 --> 02:02:59.430 align:start position:0%
you need to run
so

02:02:59.430 --> 02:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:03:01.030 --> 02:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
i said what do you mean ron what does it
 
02:03:02.390 --> 02:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
entail i
 
02:03:04.790 --> 02:03:04.800 align:start position:0%
have never done this before she'd never
 
02:03:07.350 --> 02:03:07.360 align:start position:0%
been a representative before but she won
 
02:03:09.510 --> 02:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
and she's one of you
 
02:03:12.229 --> 02:03:12.239 align:start position:0%
and i'm grateful she's one of you but
 
02:03:15.589 --> 02:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
she has integrity and she has a moral
 
02:03:17.750 --> 02:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
code that i gave her and plants it in
 
02:03:19.910 --> 02:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
her and i hope you all
 
02:03:22.709 --> 02:03:22.719 align:start position:0%
have one too
 
02:03:22.719 --> 02:03:23.910 align:start position:0%
have one too
so

02:03:23.910 --> 02:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:03:25.510 --> 02:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
she says mom you need to run for our
 
02:03:28.709 --> 02:03:28.719 align:start position:0%
county committee i said okay what's it
 
02:03:31.189 --> 02:03:31.199 align:start position:0%
entail and i proceed i had to write a
 
02:03:33.510 --> 02:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
letter i had to interact with a couple
 
02:03:35.350 --> 02:03:35.360 align:start position:0%
of the people that were in charge of the
 
02:03:38.310 --> 02:03:38.320 align:start position:0%
committee and i joined and i ran and i
 
02:03:38.320 --> 02:03:39.109 align:start position:0%
committee and i joined and i ran and i
won

02:03:39.109 --> 02:03:39.119 align:start position:0%
won
 
02:03:41.270 --> 02:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
so now i'm part of the committee for the
 
02:03:41.280 --> 02:03:43.270 align:start position:0%
so now i'm part of the committee for the
republican

02:03:43.270 --> 02:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
republican
 
02:03:43.280 --> 02:03:44.470 align:start position:0%
republican
county

02:03:44.470 --> 02:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
county
 
02:03:44.480 --> 02:03:45.750 align:start position:0%
county
but

02:03:45.750 --> 02:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:03:47.589 --> 02:03:47.599 align:start position:0%
when i go to do this
 
02:03:50.069 --> 02:03:50.079 align:start position:0%
i had been an independent voter prior to
 
02:03:54.069 --> 02:03:54.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:57.030 --> 02:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
i changed my party affiliation
 
02:03:58.870 --> 02:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
on day of voting
 
02:04:01.589 --> 02:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
and i did not go back like i always had
 
02:04:05.270 --> 02:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
my whole life and i'm not a young person
 
02:04:07.830 --> 02:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
so excuse me ms jorgensen a couple of
 
02:04:09.990 --> 02:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
things one year at your time that i've
 
02:04:11.669 --> 02:04:11.679 align:start position:0%
basically been giving everybody else so
 
02:04:14.069 --> 02:04:14.079 align:start position:0%
if you can wrap up in about a minute
 
02:04:16.470 --> 02:04:16.480 align:start position:0%
okay so so the republican committee
 
02:04:18.629 --> 02:04:18.639 align:start position:0%
member whose head
 
02:04:22.870 --> 02:04:22.880 align:start position:0%
calls me and tells me i'm not registered
 
02:04:25.189 --> 02:04:25.199 align:start position:0%
as a
 
02:04:25.199 --> 02:04:26.790 align:start position:0%
as a
party

02:04:26.790 --> 02:04:26.800 align:start position:0%
party
 
02:04:27.910 --> 02:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
i said what do you mean i'm not
 
02:04:29.830 --> 02:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
registered as a party
 
02:04:33.910 --> 02:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
well in the state thing where you're
 
02:04:35.589 --> 02:04:35.599 align:start position:0%
where we go look to see what you're
 
02:04:37.270 --> 02:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
registered as
 
02:04:40.550 --> 02:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
you're in you're not you're a democrat
 
02:04:41.510 --> 02:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
i said
 
02:04:43.109 --> 02:04:43.119 align:start position:0%
i've never voted democrat and i've
 
02:04:44.950 --> 02:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
always been an independent voter my
 
02:04:46.550 --> 02:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
husband's listed as an
 
02:04:48.950 --> 02:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
independent voter but i'm listed as a
 
02:04:51.270 --> 02:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
democrat in the state's
 
02:04:51.280 --> 02:04:52.390 align:start position:0%
democrat in the state's
information

02:04:52.390 --> 02:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:04:54.550 --> 02:04:54.560 align:start position:0%
well how the hell did that happen
 
02:04:57.510 --> 02:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
my daughter ran on the republican ticket
 
02:05:00.950 --> 02:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
she's a republican state house rep
 
02:05:04.310 --> 02:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
i am a republican and i had to go to my
 
02:05:07.030 --> 02:05:07.040 align:start position:0%
town and my town clerk says to me i
 
02:05:08.870 --> 02:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
remember that you didn't change back
 
02:05:12.229 --> 02:05:12.239 align:start position:0%
after because of your daughter
 
02:05:14.629 --> 02:05:14.639 align:start position:0%
this is my town we don't even use
 
02:05:14.639 --> 02:05:16.069 align:start position:0%
this is my town we don't even use
machines

02:05:16.069 --> 02:05:16.079 align:start position:0%
machines
 
02:05:17.910 --> 02:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
she knows me
 
02:05:20.229 --> 02:05:20.239 align:start position:0%
so she so she says well we're gonna have
 
02:05:21.510 --> 02:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
to change that
 
02:05:22.870 --> 02:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
so i had to get in touch with the
 
02:05:26.069 --> 02:05:26.079 align:start position:0%
moderators of the checklist in my town
 
02:05:29.589 --> 02:05:29.599 align:start position:0%
they only work once a month or something
 
02:05:32.550 --> 02:05:32.560 align:start position:0%
it took me three weeks to get it done
 
02:05:35.270 --> 02:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
and i had to take pictures of that being
 
02:05:36.950 --> 02:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
done so that i could send it to the
 
02:05:39.510 --> 02:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
committee that i am now
 
02:05:39.520 --> 02:05:41.189 align:start position:0%
committee that i am now
on

02:05:41.189 --> 02:05:41.199 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:05:44.629 --> 02:05:44.639 align:start position:0%
to prove my affiliation it's ridiculous
 
02:05:46.390 --> 02:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
there's so many things wrong with
 
02:05:48.629 --> 02:05:48.639 align:start position:0%
elections in this state it's a simple
 
02:05:51.030 --> 02:05:51.040 align:start position:0%
thing and i never have been a democrat
 
02:05:52.550 --> 02:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
and shouldn't have ever been listed as
 
02:05:52.560 --> 02:05:53.350 align:start position:0%
and shouldn't have ever been listed as
one

02:05:53.350 --> 02:05:53.360 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:05:55.109 --> 02:05:55.119 align:start position:0%
thank you if you could wrap up please
 
02:05:58.149 --> 02:05:58.159 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm done i just think that you guys
 
02:05:59.669 --> 02:05:59.679 align:start position:0%
need to
 
02:06:02.310 --> 02:06:02.320 align:start position:0%
support anything with voter integrity
 
02:06:04.709 --> 02:06:04.719 align:start position:0%
because there's a lot wrong here
 
02:06:06.550 --> 02:06:06.560 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
02:06:08.390 --> 02:06:08.400 align:start position:0%

hampshire voter integrity group about
 
02:07:16.069 --> 02:07:16.079 align:start position:0%
five and a half months ago i've been
 
02:07:17.990 --> 02:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
working on my computer working with
 
02:07:20.629 --> 02:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
files getting in really deep into these
 
02:07:20.639 --> 02:07:21.669 align:start position:0%
files getting in really deep into these
lists

02:07:21.669 --> 02:07:21.679 align:start position:0%
lists
 
02:07:24.510 --> 02:07:24.520 align:start position:0%
into these lists i've looked up
 
02:07:26.870 --> 02:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
6879 total people
 
02:07:28.470 --> 02:07:28.480 align:start position:0%
in a database
 
02:07:30.629 --> 02:07:30.639 align:start position:0%
to find to try to verify their birth
 
02:07:32.470 --> 02:07:32.480 align:start position:0%
find their birth years and
 
02:07:34.550 --> 02:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
find their birth years verify their
 
02:07:36.310 --> 02:07:36.320 align:start position:0%
addresses let me repeat the number again
 
02:07:38.390 --> 02:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
6 6
 
02:07:38.400 --> 02:07:39.990 align:start position:0%
6 6
879

02:07:39.990 --> 02:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
879
 
02:07:42.069 --> 02:07:42.079 align:start position:0%
total people and not just seeing them
 
02:07:42.079 --> 02:07:42.950 align:start position:0%
total people and not just seeing them
once

02:07:42.950 --> 02:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
once
 
02:07:44.790 --> 02:07:44.800 align:start position:0%
okay what i did is when i went through
 
02:07:46.790 --> 02:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
to check their birth years i found out
 
02:07:48.709 --> 02:07:48.719 align:start position:0%
that they weren't at the address anymore
 
02:07:50.470 --> 02:07:50.480 align:start position:0%
on the list i had the list of the
 
02:07:53.990 --> 02:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
registered voters and so i made a note
 
02:07:55.669 --> 02:07:55.679 align:start position:0%
you know moved to somewhere else moved
 
02:07:58.550 --> 02:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
to move to massachusetts moved to oregon
 
02:08:00.550 --> 02:08:00.560 align:start position:0%
moved to somewhere else in new hampshire
 
02:08:02.149 --> 02:08:02.159 align:start position:0%
well then after a while i just forget
 
02:08:03.430 --> 02:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
you know if you stayed in new hampshire
 
02:08:05.910 --> 02:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
good for you okay but i kept a list of
 
02:08:08.629 --> 02:08:08.639 align:start position:0%
who moved to the other states and then
 
02:08:10.390 --> 02:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
one then i thought but i don't know that
 
02:08:12.629 --> 02:08:12.639 align:start position:0%
these people voted so finally i got the
 
02:08:14.629 --> 02:08:14.639 align:start position:0%
list of who actually voted so i went
 
02:08:16.629 --> 02:08:16.639 align:start position:0%
back to the towns
 
02:08:19.189 --> 02:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
went back to the list and looked it up
 
02:08:21.910 --> 02:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
and more often than not i mean like 99
 
02:08:24.310 --> 02:08:24.320 align:start position:0%
percent of the time i was finding
 
02:08:26.790 --> 02:08:26.800 align:start position:0%
these people who moved voted from their
 
02:08:26.800 --> 02:08:27.990 align:start position:0%
these people who moved voted from their
address

02:08:27.990 --> 02:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
address
 
02:08:29.510 --> 02:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
how did that happen
 
02:08:32.310 --> 02:08:32.320 align:start position:0%
did their absentee vote get forwarded
 
02:08:34.390 --> 02:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
should they be forwarded i don't know
 
02:08:35.990 --> 02:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
did they fly back to new hampshire
 
02:08:37.510 --> 02:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
because that's their mama's house and
 
02:08:39.030 --> 02:08:39.040 align:start position:0%
they they stayed with their mom and
 
02:08:41.669 --> 02:08:41.679 align:start position:0%
voted i don't know i'm not making any
 
02:08:43.589 --> 02:08:43.599 align:start position:0%
accusations and there are a bunch of
 
02:08:44.950 --> 02:08:44.960 align:start position:0%
people there are a bunch of people i
 
02:08:46.790 --> 02:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
couldn't even find at all
 
02:08:46.800 --> 02:08:47.990 align:start position:0%
couldn't even find at all
so

02:08:47.990 --> 02:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:08:50.790 --> 02:08:50.800 align:start position:0%
then oh let me just say
 
02:08:52.790 --> 02:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
when i got to somersworth
 
02:08:54.870 --> 02:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
what i found was
 
02:08:56.709 --> 02:08:56.719 align:start position:0%
the people who moved weren't there were
 
02:09:00.390 --> 02:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
so many that weren't on the list anymore
 
02:09:03.030 --> 02:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
and there was one person who had moved
 
02:09:05.350 --> 02:09:05.360 align:start position:0%
to maine but when the whoever was
 
02:09:07.830 --> 02:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
working the voting they wrote down new
 
02:09:10.390 --> 02:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire driver's license number that
 
02:09:13.910 --> 02:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
was the only time i saw that a record
 
02:09:15.990 --> 02:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
was made that someone had used a new
 
02:09:18.069 --> 02:09:18.079 align:start position:0%
hampshire driver's license after they
 
02:09:20.149 --> 02:09:20.159 align:start position:0%
had moved to another state
 
02:09:22.629 --> 02:09:22.639 align:start position:0%
and i mean it was just
 
02:09:22.639 --> 02:09:23.350 align:start position:0%
and i mean it was just
so

02:09:23.350 --> 02:09:23.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:09:26.390 --> 02:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
what happened to these other people
 
02:09:29.109 --> 02:09:29.119 align:start position:0%
i don't know i don't know but all in all
 
02:09:30.470 --> 02:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
you know and then we got all these
 
02:09:33.270 --> 02:09:33.280 align:start position:0%
people who moved 337 people moved to
 
02:09:36.390 --> 02:09:36.400 align:start position:0%
massachusetts 213 people moved to maine
 
02:09:37.990 --> 02:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
somehow they still voted maybe they
 
02:09:40.950 --> 02:09:40.960 align:start position:0%
drove back but people moved to alaska
 
02:09:43.430 --> 02:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
people moved to idaho
 
02:09:45.350 --> 02:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
anyway i'm sorry to get so emotional i
 
02:09:48.870 --> 02:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
mean this whole thing is so unnerving
 
02:09:52.750 --> 02:09:52.760 align:start position:0%
but anyway let me just sum it up
 
02:09:56.229 --> 02:09:56.239 align:start position:0%
6879 total people 1065
 
02:09:59.990 --> 02:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
moved 244 plus i couldn't even find at
 
02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.069 align:start position:0%
moved 244 plus i couldn't even find at
all

02:10:02.069 --> 02:10:02.079 align:start position:0%
all
 
02:10:03.990 --> 02:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
okay and when i say they moved i mean i
 
02:10:05.510 --> 02:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
have i have a way of looking people up
 
02:10:07.109 --> 02:10:07.119 align:start position:0%
and puts their current address and
 
02:10:08.870 --> 02:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
address one address two address three
 
02:10:11.189 --> 02:10:11.199 align:start position:0%
you know so just 10 is like 15 years
 
02:10:13.430 --> 02:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
before eight years before there were
 
02:10:15.030 --> 02:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
people who hadn't been in new hampshire
 
02:10:17.430 --> 02:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
for that long and they're still on the
 
02:10:19.430 --> 02:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
voting list that ain't right it just
 
02:10:22.629 --> 02:10:22.639 align:start position:0%
doesn't sound right so even with me not
 
02:10:24.310 --> 02:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
putting down everybody i couldn't find
 
02:10:27.430 --> 02:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
it all it still comes up to like 20
 
02:10:28.390 --> 02:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
of people
 
02:10:30.069 --> 02:10:30.079 align:start position:0%
who the votes
 
02:10:31.910 --> 02:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
surely should be in question because
 
02:10:33.589 --> 02:10:33.599 align:start position:0%
they don't even live at their address
 
02:10:34.709 --> 02:10:34.719 align:start position:0%
anymore they don't even live in new
 
02:10:36.550 --> 02:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire anymore okay let me just say
 
02:10:37.830 --> 02:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
they don't even live in new hampshire
 
02:10:37.840 --> 02:10:39.030 align:start position:0%
they don't even live in new hampshire
anymore

anymore
 
02:10:42.550 --> 02:10:42.560 align:start position:0%

for the sake of our country for the sake
 
02:10:46.550 --> 02:10:46.560 align:start position:0%

02:11:50.310 --> 02:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
there is one machine in the in the town
 
02:11:53.030 --> 02:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
of amherst and the date on the top of
 
02:11:57.830 --> 02:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
the tally tape says october 23rd
 
02:12:00.069 --> 02:12:00.079 align:start position:0%
last time i checked
 
02:12:01.750 --> 02:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
the election
 
02:12:04.069 --> 02:12:04.079 align:start position:0%
was november third
 
02:12:06.149 --> 02:12:06.159 align:start position:0%
to date nobody can explain that i have
 
02:12:08.709 --> 02:12:08.719 align:start position:0%
pictures of it i have photographs of it
 
02:12:09.990 --> 02:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
it has been given to a couple of
 
02:12:12.629 --> 02:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
senators it has been been given to a
 
02:12:14.310 --> 02:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
couple of lawyers
 
02:12:17.109 --> 02:12:17.119 align:start position:0%
to date no one has explained it
 
02:12:19.830 --> 02:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
there is no reason for it that alone
 
02:12:23.990 --> 02:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
deserves an audit there is no excuse
 
02:12:25.910 --> 02:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
oh we counted them early
 
02:12:27.750 --> 02:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know any laws that say you can
 
02:12:31.830 --> 02:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
count absentee votes or any votes early
 
02:12:33.589 --> 02:12:33.599 align:start position:0%
the other two machines have the correct
 
02:12:33.599 --> 02:12:34.790 align:start position:0%
the other two machines have the correct
date

02:12:34.790 --> 02:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
date
 
02:12:37.189 --> 02:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
but one out of the three machines has
 
02:12:37.199 --> 02:12:38.470 align:start position:0%
but one out of the three machines has
double

02:12:38.470 --> 02:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
double
 
02:12:39.750 --> 02:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
the amount
 
02:12:42.629 --> 02:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
of democrat votes it was explained to me
 
02:12:44.950 --> 02:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
that they were all
 
02:12:44.960 --> 02:12:46.149 align:start position:0%
that they were all
democrat

02:12:46.149 --> 02:12:46.159 align:start position:0%
democrat
 
02:12:47.750 --> 02:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
absentee votes
 
02:12:49.669 --> 02:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
so i went to the moderator
 
02:12:50.790 --> 02:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
and he said
 
02:12:53.030 --> 02:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
we put all those all those absentee
 
02:12:55.030 --> 02:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
votes into that machine
 
02:12:56.709 --> 02:12:56.719 align:start position:0%
well no you don't because i observed two
 
02:12:58.470 --> 02:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
or three people walking the absentee
 
02:13:01.430 --> 02:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
votes to whatever machine was available
 
02:13:03.589 --> 02:13:03.599 align:start position:0%
so they would not inconvenience the
 
02:13:05.910 --> 02:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
voters who were voting that day
 
02:13:07.990 --> 02:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
which is the correct thing to do lie
 
02:13:10.390 --> 02:13:10.400 align:start position:0%
number one
 
02:13:13.750 --> 02:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
he then went on to explain that there
 
02:13:16.470 --> 02:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
were absolutely double the amount of
 
02:13:16.480 --> 02:13:17.510 align:start position:0%
were absolutely double the amount of
democrat

02:13:17.510 --> 02:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
democrat
 
02:13:19.430 --> 02:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
absentee votes
 
02:13:22.069 --> 02:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
again incorrect i and another friend
 
02:13:23.350 --> 02:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
have personally gone through the
 
02:13:25.750 --> 02:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
absentee vote list compared it to the
 
02:13:28.629 --> 02:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
registered list and there is not double
 
02:13:33.109 --> 02:13:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:35.270 --> 02:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
all right moving on
 
02:13:39.270 --> 02:13:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:41.430 --> 02:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
um i would also like to know hey i've
 
02:13:43.669 --> 02:13:43.679 align:start position:0%
had several towns come to me and ask you
 
02:13:45.109 --> 02:13:45.119 align:start position:0%
know hey did you see this hey did you
 
02:13:47.510 --> 02:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
see that can you explain it not i don't
 
02:13:49.189 --> 02:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
know a lot about it i've just kind of
 
02:13:51.030 --> 02:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
had it thrown on me and dumped on me and
 
02:13:52.870 --> 02:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
i'm doing the best i can do
 
02:13:55.109 --> 02:13:55.119 align:start position:0%
where is the contract between the state
 
02:13:58.390 --> 02:13:58.400 align:start position:0%
and the towns that says that we the
 
02:14:00.310 --> 02:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
citizens we the voters more importantly
 
02:14:02.069 --> 02:14:02.079 align:start position:0%

02:14:05.669 --> 02:14:05.679 align:start position:0%
and will continue to pay for the
 
02:14:08.149 --> 02:14:08.159 align:start position:0%
servicing the programming the paperwork
 
02:14:10.629 --> 02:14:10.639 align:start position:0%

the contract in any town
 
02:14:17.669 --> 02:14:17.679 align:start position:0%

02:14:20.470 --> 02:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
voters said we would accept this
 
02:14:22.069 --> 02:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
that we would continue to vote for it or
 
02:14:23.589 --> 02:14:23.599 align:start position:0%
we agreed with it
 
02:14:28.870 --> 02:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:30.470 --> 02:14:30.480 align:start position:0%

02:15:15.910 --> 02:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
we paying for
 
02:15:17.990 --> 02:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
i don't know i'd like somebody to answer
 
02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.069 align:start position:0%
i don't know i'd like somebody to answer
that

02:15:20.069 --> 02:15:20.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:15:22.229 --> 02:15:22.239 align:start position:0%
the accuvoice die old dominion machines
 
02:15:23.990 --> 02:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
were temporary when they first started
 
02:15:26.390 --> 02:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
they've now been here 20-plus years
 
02:15:28.629 --> 02:15:28.639 align:start position:0%
again when did we vote for them
 
02:15:30.310 --> 02:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
when did we say we paid a service for
 
02:15:32.069 --> 02:15:32.079 align:start position:0%
them and oh by the way who's the person
 
02:15:34.390 --> 02:15:34.400 align:start position:0%
signing the check in every town to pay
 
02:15:37.510 --> 02:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
lhs which is throughout new england okay
 
02:15:39.910 --> 02:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
my last point is the u.s constitution
 
02:15:42.550 --> 02:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
does not confer the right to vote it is
 
02:15:45.030 --> 02:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire you must be
 
02:15:48.069 --> 02:15:48.079 align:start position:0%
born here or naturalized here
 
02:15:50.550 --> 02:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
i am an american citizen i was born in
 
02:15:53.510 --> 02:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
washington d.c i can say that
 
02:15:56.870 --> 02:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
most of you cannot most of you cannot
 
02:16:00.390 --> 02:16:00.400 align:start position:0%
i became a natural naturalized citizen
 
02:16:03.109 --> 02:16:03.119 align:start position:0%
in this state and i think that
 
02:16:04.550 --> 02:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
the constitution of the state of new
 
02:16:07.430 --> 02:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire must be followed at all costs
 
02:16:09.750 --> 02:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
and not twisted and turned for whatever
 
02:16:11.750 --> 02:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
anybody wants thank you
 
02:16:13.910 --> 02:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:16:16.310 --> 02:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
okay i also signed up to testify is
 
02:16:21.589 --> 02:16:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:23.750 --> 02:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman my name is alvin c
 
02:16:25.109 --> 02:16:25.119 align:start position:0%
i live in loudoun new hampshire i'm
 
02:16:26.950 --> 02:16:26.960 align:start position:0%
speaking for myself
 
02:16:29.589 --> 02:16:29.599 align:start position:0%
on this particular bill
 
02:16:31.750 --> 02:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
i'm very concerned that
 
02:16:34.230 --> 02:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
because two election elections at least
 
02:16:36.790 --> 02:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
one election has already happened after
 
02:16:38.549 --> 02:16:38.559 align:start position:0%
the general election for which this
 
02:16:40.309 --> 02:16:40.319 align:start position:0%
audit is for
 
02:16:43.190 --> 02:16:43.200 align:start position:0%
either the town elections last spring or
 
02:16:47.030 --> 02:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
the city elections last fall so this may
 
02:16:49.270 --> 02:16:49.280 align:start position:0%
make it hard to
 
02:16:52.709 --> 02:16:52.719 align:start position:0%
do a complete forensic analysis
 
02:16:55.830 --> 02:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
however it is possible to do
 
02:16:55.840 --> 02:16:57.190 align:start position:0%
however it is possible to do
a

02:16:57.190 --> 02:16:57.200 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:16:59.750 --> 02:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
hand recount of the three offices
 
02:17:01.830 --> 02:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
specified in the bill
 
02:17:03.830 --> 02:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
and that would certainly go a long way
 
02:17:06.629 --> 02:17:06.639 align:start position:0%
to comparing it with what the machines
 
02:17:09.509 --> 02:17:09.519 align:start position:0%
had reported
 
02:17:12.070 --> 02:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
and from the previous testimony on this
 
02:17:12.080 --> 02:17:12.950 align:start position:0%
and from the previous testimony on this
bill

02:17:12.950 --> 02:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:17:15.349 --> 02:17:15.359 align:start position:0%
i think one other thing that needs to be
 
02:17:15.359 --> 02:17:16.709 align:start position:0%
i think one other thing that needs to be
audited

02:17:16.709 --> 02:17:16.719 align:start position:0%
audited
 
02:17:19.509 --> 02:17:19.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:19.519 --> 02:17:21.589 align:start position:0%
 
voters

02:17:21.589 --> 02:17:21.599 align:start position:0%
voters
 
02:17:23.429 --> 02:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
especially the absentee voters where
 
02:17:25.669 --> 02:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
they voted from where they claimed they
 
02:17:25.679 --> 02:17:27.030 align:start position:0%
they voted from where they claimed they
resigned

02:17:27.030 --> 02:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
resigned
 
02:17:27.040 --> 02:17:29.030 align:start position:0%
resigned
and

02:17:29.030 --> 02:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:17:29.040 --> 02:17:29.990 align:start position:0%
and
also

02:17:29.990 --> 02:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
also
 
02:17:33.429 --> 02:17:33.439 align:start position:0%
any deceased voters who still manage to
 
02:17:35.349 --> 02:17:35.359 align:start position:0%
turn in a ballot anyway
 
02:17:39.110 --> 02:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
that is something worthy of of an audit
 
02:17:40.830 --> 02:17:40.840 align:start position:0%
that's all i have for this bill thank
 
02:17:44.070 --> 02:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
you thank you mr c
 
02:17:46.150 --> 02:17:46.160 align:start position:0%

02:17:48.549 --> 02:17:48.559 align:start position:0%
and i'm
 
02:17:50.070 --> 02:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
having a little trouble reading the name
 
02:17:54.469 --> 02:17:54.479 align:start position:0%
a brendino brandano
 
02:17:57.030 --> 02:17:57.040 align:start position:0%

jose is better than mine i'm just not as
 
02:18:04.709 --> 02:18:04.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:06.469 --> 02:18:06.479 align:start position:0%
you indicated five minutes sir again
 
02:18:08.309 --> 02:18:08.319 align:start position:0%
well asking people to try to keep it at
 
02:18:10.870 --> 02:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
four yes sir first of all thank you very
 
02:18:12.950 --> 02:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
much my name is al brandano i'm from
 
02:18:15.030 --> 02:18:15.040 align:start position:0%
kensington new hampshire independent
 
02:18:18.309 --> 02:18:18.319 align:start position:0%
voter for 33 years
 
02:18:20.070 --> 02:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
i did a citizen audit in the town of
 
02:18:22.950 --> 02:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
kensington and was honest to god
 
02:18:24.870 --> 02:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
it's hard for me because i know all the
 
02:18:27.030 --> 02:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
people there and the more i started to
 
02:18:29.190 --> 02:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
look and the more we started to
 
02:18:31.190 --> 02:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
find out in the policy and procedures
 
02:18:33.589 --> 02:18:33.599 align:start position:0%
were totally off the rails
 
02:18:35.190 --> 02:18:35.200 align:start position:0%
and it's interesting because i'm working
 
02:18:36.629 --> 02:18:36.639 align:start position:0%
with the secretary of state and the
 
02:18:39.030 --> 02:18:39.040 align:start position:0%
department of justice on just this issue
 
02:18:40.629 --> 02:18:40.639 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that i found is
 
02:18:40.639 --> 02:18:41.509 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that i found is
that

02:18:41.509 --> 02:18:41.519 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:18:43.270 --> 02:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
the town clerks
 
02:18:45.509 --> 02:18:45.519 align:start position:0%
and the moderators don't have official
 
02:18:47.589 --> 02:18:47.599 align:start position:0%
training there's no certification for
 
02:18:49.830 --> 02:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
them they don't have to attend any
 
02:18:52.549 --> 02:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
classes they do by choice but it's not
 
02:18:52.559 --> 02:18:53.750 align:start position:0%
classes they do by choice but it's not
required

02:18:53.750 --> 02:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
required
 
02:18:56.150 --> 02:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
and if the fact that they don't have any
 
02:18:58.709 --> 02:18:58.719 align:start position:0%
formal training and or audit the
 
02:19:01.030 --> 02:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
secretary of state nor the department of
 
02:19:03.750 --> 02:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
justice audits any of the policy and
 
02:19:06.629 --> 02:19:06.639 align:start position:0%
procedures until there's an issue
 
02:19:07.950 --> 02:19:07.960 align:start position:0%
so there's no
 
02:19:11.509 --> 02:19:11.519 align:start position:0%
pre-preliminary look at anything
 
02:19:12.950 --> 02:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
what i want to share with you more than
 
02:19:14.629 --> 02:19:14.639 align:start position:0%
anything as i look around this room so
 
02:19:16.950 --> 02:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
impressed by these people on the wall
 
02:19:19.110 --> 02:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
and and with you you all have this
 
02:19:19.120 --> 02:19:20.870 align:start position:0%
and and with you you all have this
responsibility

02:19:20.870 --> 02:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
02:19:23.349 --> 02:19:23.359 align:start position:0%
human beings realize that there's truth
 
02:19:26.870 --> 02:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
and trust as empirical or scientific
 
02:19:30.870 --> 02:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
fear always drives one they choose first
 
02:19:33.190 --> 02:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
fear leads to mistrust and this is the
 
02:19:36.469 --> 02:19:36.479 align:start position:0%
most dangerous miscalculation of all
 
02:19:38.629 --> 02:19:38.639 align:start position:0%
because trust is like a soap bubble once
 
02:19:41.669 --> 02:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
it's gone it never really returns
 
02:19:43.589 --> 02:19:43.599 align:start position:0%
we are well beyond the tipping point of
 
02:19:46.709 --> 02:19:46.719 align:start position:0%
trust regardless of who you blame or why
 
02:19:48.549 --> 02:19:48.559 align:start position:0%
it's really too late
 
02:19:50.469 --> 02:19:50.479 align:start position:0%
so i share with you a line from the
 
02:19:52.870 --> 02:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
bible to make my point
 
02:19:54.790 --> 02:19:54.800 align:start position:0%
give unto caesar what is caesar's and
 
02:19:56.870 --> 02:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
give unto god what is god
 
02:19:59.030 --> 02:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
in today's words give unto the
 
02:20:01.670 --> 02:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
politicians what is the politicians and
 
02:20:04.790 --> 02:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
give unto the voters their sacred rights
 
02:20:06.950 --> 02:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
of voting
 
02:20:10.469 --> 02:20:10.479 align:start position:0%
when a politician takes this trust
 
02:20:13.750 --> 02:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
it's called totalitarianism
 
02:20:16.389 --> 02:20:16.399 align:start position:0%
be bold please be bold
 
02:20:18.469 --> 02:20:18.479 align:start position:0%
do what is inherently human
 
02:20:20.150 --> 02:20:20.160 align:start position:0%
and simple
 
02:20:21.990 --> 02:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
the question before us is do we trust
 
02:20:24.550 --> 02:20:24.560 align:start position:0%
lhs or which or do we trust our voters
 
02:20:26.389 --> 02:20:26.399 align:start position:0%
do we trust the people in this room or
 
02:20:29.190 --> 02:20:29.200 align:start position:0%
we trust lhs
 
02:20:31.270 --> 02:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
i think you know the answer to that
 
02:20:33.349 --> 02:20:33.359 align:start position:0%
please don't be the party of the person
 
02:20:35.990 --> 02:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
to break the sacred bubble of trust
 
02:20:38.150 --> 02:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
please vote to support this bill thank
 
02:20:38.160 --> 02:20:40.870 align:start position:0%
please vote to support this bill thank
you

02:20:40.870 --> 02:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:42.550 --> 02:20:42.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:20:44.230 --> 02:20:44.240 align:start position:0%

so i am closing the hearing on this
 
02:20:48.080 --> 02:20:49.990 align:start position:0%
so i am closing the hearing on this

02:21:30.870 --> 02:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
the concerns of the citizens it's a
 
02:21:32.870 --> 02:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
it's more of a proactive build than a
 
02:21:34.950 --> 02:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
reactive i don't know what to do with
 
02:21:36.950 --> 02:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
the past necessarily but this is looking
 
02:21:38.790 --> 02:21:38.800 align:start position:0%
for towards the future
 
02:21:40.950 --> 02:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
and it does have to do with recounts so
 
02:21:42.550 --> 02:21:42.560 align:start position:0%
whenever the recounts are requested at
 
02:21:44.950 --> 02:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
the state level currently
 
02:21:47.590 --> 02:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
all i'm asking here is to recount an
 
02:21:50.070 --> 02:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
additional raise
 
02:21:52.389 --> 02:21:52.399 align:start position:0%
so for instance um
 
02:21:54.710 --> 02:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
if a state rep race is being recounted
 
02:21:56.150 --> 02:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
the state rep for that district or for
 
02:21:57.990 --> 02:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
the town can request
 
02:22:00.230 --> 02:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
for the president to be recounted
 
02:22:01.750 --> 02:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
or for
 
02:22:04.389 --> 02:22:04.399 align:start position:0%
senator or the governor
 
02:22:05.910 --> 02:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
anything that appears on the ballot is
 
02:22:07.990 --> 02:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
fair game because we already present
 
02:22:09.830 --> 02:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
those ballots we post them on the
 
02:22:11.590 --> 02:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
display the
 
02:22:11.600 --> 02:22:12.550 align:start position:0%
display the
the

02:22:12.550 --> 02:22:12.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:22:12.560 --> 02:22:13.670 align:start position:0%
the
helpers

02:22:13.670 --> 02:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
helpers
 
02:22:15.110 --> 02:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
what are we called
 
02:22:16.630 --> 02:22:16.640 align:start position:0%
whoever is looking at the ballots can
 
02:22:18.389 --> 02:22:18.399 align:start position:0%
look at an additional column and tally
 
02:22:21.349 --> 02:22:21.359 align:start position:0%
it up and that will give us a data point
 
02:22:22.950 --> 02:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
for future use
 
02:22:24.950 --> 02:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
this is not questioning anything in the
 
02:22:26.389 --> 02:22:26.399 align:start position:0%
ballot necessarily this is just
 
02:22:27.990 --> 02:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
collecting data points from that same
 
02:22:30.150 --> 02:22:30.160 align:start position:0%
ballot that's already been pulled out of
 
02:22:32.230 --> 02:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
the box brought into the secretary of
 
02:22:33.429 --> 02:22:33.439 align:start position:0%
state office
 
02:22:35.349 --> 02:22:35.359 align:start position:0%
is being looked at by everybody by both
 
02:22:35.359 --> 02:22:38.870 align:start position:0%
is being looked at by everybody by both
parties

02:22:38.870 --> 02:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:42.870 --> 02:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:45.830 --> 02:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
so i believe this information will give
 
02:22:45.840 --> 02:22:46.550 align:start position:0%
so i believe this information will give
us

02:22:46.550 --> 02:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
us
 
02:22:48.790 --> 02:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
something useful
 
02:22:50.389 --> 02:22:50.399 align:start position:0%
when there are concerns
 
02:22:52.710 --> 02:22:52.720 align:start position:0%
um will bring a little more transparency
 
02:22:52.720 --> 02:22:54.230 align:start position:0%
um will bring a little more transparency
into

02:22:54.230 --> 02:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
into
 
02:22:55.990 --> 02:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
the elections and
 
02:22:59.349 --> 02:22:59.359 align:start position:0%
how the votes are tallied
 
02:23:00.950 --> 02:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
so the recon
 
02:23:03.030 --> 02:23:03.040 align:start position:0%
recount requests are not being affected
 
02:23:05.349 --> 02:23:05.359 align:start position:0%
by this bill why the recounts are being
 
02:23:07.030 --> 02:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
conducted is not affected how many
 
02:23:09.750 --> 02:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
recounts there will be the reasons when
 
02:23:11.830 --> 02:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
nothing nothing like that has changed
 
02:23:14.710 --> 02:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
this is only when the recounts happen
 
02:23:16.230 --> 02:23:16.240 align:start position:0%
uh this bill gives means to the
 
02:23:18.870 --> 02:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
secretary of state and the requester to
 
02:23:20.309 --> 02:23:20.319 align:start position:0%
conduct to
 
02:23:22.630 --> 02:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
recount an additional race that already
 
02:23:25.990 --> 02:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
appears on the ballot so i i view this
 
02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:27.830 align:start position:0%
appears on the ballot so i i view this
effort

02:23:27.830 --> 02:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
effort
 
02:23:30.710 --> 02:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
as being very marginal so it'll it may
 
02:23:33.190 --> 02:23:33.200 align:start position:0%
take a little bit more time to look at
 
02:23:35.270 --> 02:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
each ballot because you need to tally up
 
02:23:37.590 --> 02:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
an additional column but since
 
02:23:39.030 --> 02:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
it's all there already in the room
 
02:23:39.040 --> 02:23:40.550 align:start position:0%
it's all there already in the room
everything

02:23:40.550 --> 02:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
everything
 
02:23:41.750 --> 02:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
is set up
 
02:23:43.990 --> 02:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
people are there in the room i think
 
02:23:46.550 --> 02:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
this will be useful
 
02:23:47.910 --> 02:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
to bring some more trust into the
 
02:23:47.920 --> 02:23:49.990 align:start position:0%
to bring some more trust into the
elections

02:23:49.990 --> 02:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
elections
 
02:23:52.469 --> 02:23:52.479 align:start position:0%
that's that's it thank you okay thank
 
02:23:53.750 --> 02:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
you are you willing to take questions
 
02:23:54.950 --> 02:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
yes please
 
02:23:56.630 --> 02:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
any questions from committee members yes
 
02:23:58.309 --> 02:23:58.319 align:start position:0%
representative barry it's it's good to
 
02:24:00.469 --> 02:24:00.479 align:start position:0%
see you representative so just want to
 
02:24:03.030 --> 02:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
clarify so this this bill because you
 
02:24:04.469 --> 02:24:04.479 align:start position:0%
and i talked about this if i remember
 
02:24:07.990 --> 02:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
right um so this bill basically while a
 
02:24:09.670 --> 02:24:09.680 align:start position:0%
recount is happening let's say for state
 
02:24:11.030 --> 02:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
rep right
 
02:24:13.030 --> 02:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
we would look at another
 
02:24:15.750 --> 02:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
office while doing that does it specify
 
02:24:18.309 --> 02:24:18.319 align:start position:0%
which office we'll look at um it does it
 
02:24:20.150 --> 02:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
gives a choice so the
 
02:24:21.590 --> 02:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
so the choice is given to the secretary
 
02:24:23.190 --> 02:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
of state thank you for the question so
 
02:24:24.790 --> 02:24:24.800 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state
 
02:24:26.950 --> 02:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
he he will pick one office and then the
 
02:24:28.630 --> 02:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
requester of the recount like the state
 
02:24:28.640 --> 02:24:29.830 align:start position:0%
requester of the recount like the state
rep

02:24:29.830 --> 02:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
rep
 
02:24:31.510 --> 02:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
is able to pick another office if he is
 
02:24:33.670 --> 02:24:33.680 align:start position:0%
so willing or he doesn't have to okay so
 
02:24:36.150 --> 02:24:36.160 align:start position:0%
the the i'm sorry follow-ups
 
02:24:38.710 --> 02:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
um so the so this the person being
 
02:24:40.469 --> 02:24:40.479 align:start position:0%
recounted gets to pick an office and the
 
02:24:41.670 --> 02:24:41.680 align:start position:0%
secretary of state gets to pick an
 
02:24:42.870 --> 02:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
office there's two
 
02:24:45.910 --> 02:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
two offices one one correct okay
 
02:24:48.309 --> 02:24:48.319 align:start position:0%
so so the state rep hypothetically could
 
02:24:49.990 --> 02:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
pick the president
 
02:24:51.510 --> 02:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
if they wanted to yes they could pick
 
02:24:53.030 --> 02:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
county commissioner
 
02:24:54.630 --> 02:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
okay and the secretary of state's office
 
02:24:56.630 --> 02:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
could pick any other office they want to
 
02:24:58.950 --> 02:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
as well correct okay so it's up to two
 
02:25:01.190 --> 02:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
officers so yeah
 
02:25:03.670 --> 02:25:03.680 align:start position:0%
no more than two
 
02:25:04.950 --> 02:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
any other questions from committee
 
02:25:04.960 --> 02:25:07.590 align:start position:0%
any other questions from committee
members

02:25:07.590 --> 02:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:11.990 --> 02:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:13.830 --> 02:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
also signed up to testify in this bill
 
02:25:18.790 --> 02:25:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:20.309 --> 02:25:20.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman members of
 
02:25:20.319 --> 02:25:21.510 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman members of
committee

02:25:21.510 --> 02:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:25:23.429 --> 02:25:23.439 align:start position:0%
my name is alvin c and i live in loudoun
 
02:25:25.270 --> 02:25:25.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and i'm here to speak in
 
02:25:27.830 --> 02:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
favor of this bill
 
02:25:30.070 --> 02:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
a couple of things the
 
02:25:32.950 --> 02:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
as the bill states on
 
02:25:32.960 --> 02:25:34.150 align:start position:0%
as the bill states on
line

02:25:34.150 --> 02:25:34.160 align:start position:0%
line
 
02:25:36.389 --> 02:25:36.399 align:start position:0%
six seven and eight the secretary of
 
02:25:39.429 --> 02:25:39.439 align:start position:0%
state urs designee would select
 
02:25:41.510 --> 02:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
one of five offices which are the top
 
02:25:41.520 --> 02:25:43.750 align:start position:0%
one of five offices which are the top
five

02:25:43.750 --> 02:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
five
 
02:25:45.510 --> 02:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
so it'd be president
 
02:25:47.030 --> 02:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
u.s senate u.s
 
02:25:49.110 --> 02:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
representative governor or executive
 
02:25:49.120 --> 02:25:51.670 align:start position:0%
representative governor or executive
council

02:25:51.670 --> 02:25:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:53.590 --> 02:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
that would be for all the ballots that
 
02:25:56.150 --> 02:25:56.160 align:start position:0%
happened to be turned uh brought in for
 
02:25:58.309 --> 02:25:58.319 align:start position:0%
all the recounts
 
02:26:00.630 --> 02:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
the individual candidate who filed for a
 
02:26:00.640 --> 02:26:02.150 align:start position:0%
the individual candidate who filed for a
recount

02:26:02.150 --> 02:26:02.160 align:start position:0%
recount
 
02:26:04.790 --> 02:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
can ask for another office
 
02:26:07.510 --> 02:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
that would be on the ballots within his
 
02:26:10.710 --> 02:26:10.720 align:start position:0%
district not all the ballots just within
 
02:26:12.710 --> 02:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
his recount
 
02:26:16.790 --> 02:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:19.590 --> 02:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
just as an example
 
02:26:20.790 --> 02:26:20.800 align:start position:0%
after the
 
02:26:23.830 --> 02:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
november elections in 2020
 
02:26:27.910 --> 02:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
there were 16 recounts asked for
 
02:26:27.920 --> 02:26:29.030 align:start position:0%
there were 16 recounts asked for
and

02:26:29.030 --> 02:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:26:31.110 --> 02:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
it affected
 
02:26:34.150 --> 02:26:34.160 align:start position:0%
towns in seven counties a total of 55
 
02:26:35.830 --> 02:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
towns and cities
 
02:26:38.630 --> 02:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
so this gives us a
 
02:26:40.469 --> 02:26:40.479 align:start position:0%
a reasonably
 
02:26:43.110 --> 02:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
broad sample
 
02:26:45.429 --> 02:26:45.439 align:start position:0%
but also since we don't know exactly
 
02:26:46.830 --> 02:26:46.840 align:start position:0%
who's going to need to file for a
 
02:26:49.750 --> 02:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
recount it's somewhat random it's not
 
02:26:51.349 --> 02:26:51.359 align:start position:0%
perfectly random but i would say
 
02:26:53.990 --> 02:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
somewhat random in
 
02:26:59.349 --> 02:26:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:59.359 --> 02:27:00.150 align:start position:0%
 
it

02:27:00.150 --> 02:27:00.160 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:27:00.160 --> 02:27:00.830 align:start position:0%
it
would

02:27:00.830 --> 02:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:27:04.950 --> 02:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:07.510 --> 02:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
people involved to choose which offices
 
02:27:11.910 --> 02:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:15.030 --> 02:27:15.040 align:start position:0%
a day or more ahead of time so that the
 
02:27:17.510 --> 02:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
secretary can prepare tally sheets and
 
02:27:19.830 --> 02:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
whatever other materials are needed
 
02:27:21.590 --> 02:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
so that they can do this in an
 
02:27:27.590 --> 02:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:30.950 --> 02:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
the intent was to do the recount and
 
02:27:33.910 --> 02:27:33.920 align:start position:0%
audits simultaneously with recounts so
 
02:27:33.920 --> 02:27:34.870 align:start position:0%
audits simultaneously with recounts so
that

02:27:34.870 --> 02:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:27:36.950 --> 02:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
the ballots didn't have to be handled a
 
02:27:39.830 --> 02:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
second time for any other reason
 
02:27:42.790 --> 02:27:42.800 align:start position:0%
it just while the recount is being done
 
02:27:46.870 --> 02:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
it does add a little bit of extra time
 
02:27:49.910 --> 02:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
to read off extra names on the ballot
 
02:27:52.309 --> 02:27:52.319 align:start position:0%
and and do the check marks on the tally
 
02:27:52.319 --> 02:27:53.990 align:start position:0%
and and do the check marks on the tally
sheets

02:27:53.990 --> 02:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
sheets
 
02:27:56.309 --> 02:27:56.319 align:start position:0%
but i don't think it is as drastic as
 
02:27:58.550 --> 02:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
what it appears to say in the fiscal
 
02:27:58.560 --> 02:28:01.190 align:start position:0%
what it appears to say in the fiscal
note

02:28:01.190 --> 02:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:03.190 --> 02:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
it will take a little bit more time yes
 
02:28:08.790 --> 02:28:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:11.270 --> 02:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
and that's pretty much what i have to
 
02:28:12.550 --> 02:28:12.560 align:start position:0%
say on this
 
02:28:13.250 --> 02:28:13.260 align:start position:0%
i did
 
02:28:13.260 --> 02:28:14.710 align:start position:0%
i did
[Music]

02:28:14.710 --> 02:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:28:17.110 --> 02:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
talk with secretary scanlon when he was
 
02:28:20.790 --> 02:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
here earlier and asked him if he
 
02:28:23.030 --> 02:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
had any opinion on this and he seemed to
 
02:28:26.230 --> 02:28:26.240 align:start position:0%
be favorable to it but
 
02:28:27.830 --> 02:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
there were a couple of details that he
 
02:28:30.389 --> 02:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
thought might ought to be changed i
 
02:28:31.750 --> 02:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
was sort of surprised that he didn't
 
02:28:34.790 --> 02:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
stay to speak on the bill
 
02:28:34.800 --> 02:28:37.670 align:start position:0%
stay to speak on the bill
and

02:28:37.670 --> 02:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:39.910 --> 02:28:39.920 align:start position:0%
that's not an official quotation from
 
02:28:39.920 --> 02:28:40.870 align:start position:0%
that's not an official quotation from
him

02:28:40.870 --> 02:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
him
 
02:28:40.880 --> 02:28:41.910 align:start position:0%
him
okay

02:28:41.910 --> 02:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:28:41.920 --> 02:28:44.150 align:start position:0%
okay
understood

02:28:44.150 --> 02:28:44.160 align:start position:0%
understood
 
02:28:44.160 --> 02:28:46.870 align:start position:0%
understood
so

02:28:46.870 --> 02:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:46.880 --> 02:28:47.990 align:start position:0%
 
just

02:28:47.990 --> 02:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:28:49.270 --> 02:28:49.280 align:start position:0%
as a
 
02:28:52.230 --> 02:28:52.240 align:start position:0%
indication here there were
 
02:28:53.990 --> 02:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
last time there were three state senate
 
02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:55.510 align:start position:0%
last time there were three state senate
districts

02:28:55.510 --> 02:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
districts
 
02:28:57.670 --> 02:28:57.680 align:start position:0%
and 12
 
02:28:59.830 --> 02:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
state representative districts and an
 
02:29:02.710 --> 02:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
executive council
 
02:29:05.270 --> 02:29:05.280 align:start position:0%
recount that was requested
 
02:29:08.389 --> 02:29:08.399 align:start position:0%
so that covers a lot of the state
 
02:29:10.070 --> 02:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
usually don't get a
 
02:29:12.550 --> 02:29:12.560 align:start position:0%
executive council recount so
 
02:29:15.030 --> 02:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
that probably would be a lower number
 
02:29:18.389 --> 02:29:18.399 align:start position:0%
next time or other times
 
02:29:19.429 --> 02:29:19.439 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:29:20.950 --> 02:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr c
 
02:29:24.309 --> 02:29:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:27.510 --> 02:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:29.190 --> 02:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
okay i have no one else signed up to
 
02:29:30.870 --> 02:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
testify on this bill is there anyone
 
02:29:35.030 --> 02:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:36.870 --> 02:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
i'm seeing none i'm going to close the

02:30:00.630 --> 02:30:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:02.710 --> 02:30:02.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
02:30:04.469 --> 02:30:04.479 align:start position:0%
house election law for hearing this i'll
 
02:30:06.950 --> 02:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
be very brief this bill
 
02:30:08.710 --> 02:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
is actually trying to form a commission
 
02:30:11.429 --> 02:30:11.439 align:start position:0%
to have a real in-depth conversation
 
02:30:13.510 --> 02:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
about how we structure our municipal
 
02:30:16.230 --> 02:30:16.240 align:start position:0%
government here in new hampshire
 
02:30:19.030 --> 02:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
comparing the data on how we see turnout
 
02:30:21.349 --> 02:30:21.359 align:start position:0%
in elections at the city level versus
 
02:30:22.790 --> 02:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
the town level
 
02:30:25.349 --> 02:30:25.359 align:start position:0%
we currently have a number of abilities
 
02:30:27.750 --> 02:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
within state statute that allow towns
 
02:30:30.070 --> 02:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
using local control to determine how
 
02:30:32.070 --> 02:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
they're structured the base level is
 
02:30:34.389 --> 02:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
board of selectmen towns can then adopt
 
02:30:36.150 --> 02:30:36.160 align:start position:0%
a town charter to keep a selectman
 
02:30:39.190 --> 02:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
former government adopt a town council
 
02:30:41.670 --> 02:30:41.680 align:start position:0%
with either a budgetary meeting or a
 
02:30:44.150 --> 02:30:44.160 align:start position:0%
town council that sets the budget itself
 
02:30:46.309 --> 02:30:46.319 align:start position:0%
or move into a city form of government
 
02:30:47.830 --> 02:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
that either has a city council or a
 
02:30:49.270 --> 02:30:49.280 align:start position:0%
board of aldermen
 
02:30:51.910 --> 02:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
city charters or town charters control
 
02:30:53.830 --> 02:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
the length of office individuals are
 
02:30:56.150 --> 02:30:56.160 align:start position:0%
elected to serve in they determine when
 
02:30:57.750 --> 02:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
the election dates are held if you're a
 
02:30:59.510 --> 02:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
town government you can have an election
 
02:31:00.469 --> 02:31:00.479 align:start position:0%
in march
 
02:31:02.550 --> 02:31:02.560 align:start position:0%
april or may or you can move it to
 
02:31:05.190 --> 02:31:05.200 align:start position:0%
november currently under state law uh if
 
02:31:07.270 --> 02:31:07.280 align:start position:0%
you have two-year terms essentially or
 
02:31:09.270 --> 02:31:09.280 align:start position:0%
four-year terms as long as your
 
02:31:11.590 --> 02:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
town local election doesn't coincide
 
02:31:13.510 --> 02:31:13.520 align:start position:0%
with the state elections
 
02:31:15.670 --> 02:31:15.680 align:start position:0%
all of our cities typically have the
 
02:31:18.710 --> 02:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
elections in november of the off year
 
02:31:20.870 --> 02:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
for either two or four year term in
 
02:31:23.750 --> 02:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
terms of nashua's mayor's office
 
02:31:25.990 --> 02:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
in order to not have elections coincide
 
02:31:28.230 --> 02:31:28.240 align:start position:0%
with the state elections that's all set
 
02:31:30.870 --> 02:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
by statute this commission
 
02:31:33.590 --> 02:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
my intent is to have a bipartisan open
 
02:31:35.349 --> 02:31:35.359 align:start position:0%
public discussion
 
02:31:37.990 --> 02:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
the the original bill had makeup with
 
02:31:39.270 --> 02:31:39.280 align:start position:0%
three members of the house
 
02:31:41.270 --> 02:31:41.280 align:start position:0%
representatives appointed by the speaker
 
02:31:42.790 --> 02:31:42.800 align:start position:0%
three members of the state senate
 
02:31:44.389 --> 02:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
appointed by the senate
 
02:31:45.910 --> 02:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
three members of the commission would be
 
02:31:47.750 --> 02:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
appointed by the governor
 
02:31:49.110 --> 02:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
and three members of the commission will
 
02:31:50.630 --> 02:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
be appointed by the secretary of state's
 
02:31:52.710 --> 02:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
office in conversations with the new
 
02:31:54.790 --> 02:31:54.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire municipal association
 
02:31:56.550 --> 02:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
i have sent around an amendment that i
 
02:31:58.790 --> 02:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
drafted to the bill that would add an
 
02:32:00.150 --> 02:32:00.160 align:start position:0%
additional member that is a
 
02:32:02.550 --> 02:32:02.560 align:start position:0%
representative of municipal government
 
02:32:04.230 --> 02:32:04.240 align:start position:0%
uh appointed by the new hampshire
 
02:32:06.710 --> 02:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
municipal association uh because there
 
02:32:08.710 --> 02:32:08.720 align:start position:0%
really is i have no agenda with this
 
02:32:10.550 --> 02:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
bill i want to have
 
02:32:12.070 --> 02:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
over the course of the commission's
 
02:32:15.190 --> 02:32:15.200 align:start position:0%
lifespan a real in-depth conversation
 
02:32:16.950 --> 02:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
with a number of stakeholders from
 
02:32:18.630 --> 02:32:18.640 align:start position:0%
across the spectrum
 
02:32:21.030 --> 02:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
from cities from towns from everywhere
 
02:32:22.230 --> 02:32:22.240 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
02:32:24.950 --> 02:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
to examine how the state structures our
 
02:32:26.870 --> 02:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
municipal government and the election
 
02:32:29.830 --> 02:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
calendar therein um so that is the the
 
02:32:32.550 --> 02:32:32.560 align:start position:0%
honest and pure goal of the of the
 
02:32:33.990 --> 02:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
commission i'm proposing i'm happy to
 
02:32:37.590 --> 02:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:40.950 --> 02:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
um uh yes of representative trojan
 
02:32:42.469 --> 02:32:42.479 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thanks
 
02:32:44.790 --> 02:32:44.800 align:start position:0%
representative taking the question
 
02:32:47.510 --> 02:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
so for clarification the structure in
 
02:32:50.309 --> 02:32:50.319 align:start position:0%
the calendar um
 
02:32:52.550 --> 02:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
is looking to achieve a
 
02:32:52.560 --> 02:32:53.750 align:start position:0%
is looking to achieve a
uniform

02:32:53.750 --> 02:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
uniform
 
02:32:56.630 --> 02:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
um calendar among cities and towns i'm
 
02:32:58.550 --> 02:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
not quite clear on exactly what you hope
 
02:33:01.429 --> 02:33:01.439 align:start position:0%
the commission will will ascertain i i'm
 
02:33:03.030 --> 02:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
looking at the commission as not to
 
02:33:06.230 --> 02:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
recommend a uniform structure or or any
 
02:33:07.990 --> 02:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
of thing of the sort
 
02:33:09.590 --> 02:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
i still strongly believe in local
 
02:33:11.030 --> 02:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
control and i believe that local
 
02:33:12.950 --> 02:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
community should have the ability to
 
02:33:14.469 --> 02:33:14.479 align:start position:0%
determine what they can do under the
 
02:33:15.750 --> 02:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
current law
 
02:33:17.270 --> 02:33:17.280 align:start position:0%
what i'd like the commission to do and
 
02:33:18.790 --> 02:33:18.800 align:start position:0%
what i think one thing it would be
 
02:33:21.429 --> 02:33:21.439 align:start position:0%
tasked with per the per the provision is
 
02:33:24.150 --> 02:33:24.160 align:start position:0%
to examine what are turnouts like in
 
02:33:26.230 --> 02:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
city elections that are held in november
 
02:33:28.389 --> 02:33:28.399 align:start position:0%
how does that compare to town elections
 
02:33:30.710 --> 02:33:30.720 align:start position:0%
that take place largely in march
 
02:33:33.349 --> 02:33:33.359 align:start position:0%
is there a way to make sure that across
 
02:33:35.670 --> 02:33:35.680 align:start position:0%
the board we see you know higher
 
02:33:38.230 --> 02:33:38.240 align:start position:0%
participation in our local elections
 
02:33:40.469 --> 02:33:40.479 align:start position:0%
i think we all know it's no secret our
 
02:33:43.110 --> 02:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
local elections are typically the lowest
 
02:33:44.870 --> 02:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
turnout elections we have
 
02:33:47.030 --> 02:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
um and i think having this commission
 
02:33:49.830 --> 02:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
study how we we govern our laws and also
 
02:33:52.230 --> 02:33:52.240 align:start position:0%
compare it to how states in the region
 
02:33:53.830 --> 02:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
and across the country structure their
 
02:33:55.990 --> 02:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
local elections and how they elect their
 
02:33:58.230 --> 02:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
local governments and compare it to
 
02:33:59.830 --> 02:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
their turnout and whatnot i think would
 
02:34:01.110 --> 02:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
just be helpful to gather that
 
02:34:03.510 --> 02:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
information and then any recommended
 
02:34:04.710 --> 02:34:04.720 align:start position:0%
changes would be in the commission
 
02:34:07.110 --> 02:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
report but allow all the data that the
 
02:34:09.830 --> 02:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
commission collects and researches to be
 
02:34:12.230 --> 02:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
out there for any legislator to take and
 
02:34:16.309 --> 02:34:16.319 align:start position:0%
and run run a bill with on their own
 
02:34:17.190 --> 02:34:17.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:34:18.950 --> 02:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:34:20.870 --> 02:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative thank you thank
 
02:34:20.880 --> 02:34:21.670 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative thank you thank
you

02:34:21.670 --> 02:34:21.680 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:34:21.680 --> 02:34:22.790 align:start position:0%
you
representative

02:34:22.790 --> 02:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:34:26.710 --> 02:34:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:26.720 --> 02:34:27.830 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:34:27.830 --> 02:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:34:30.230 --> 02:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
is turnout that the number one problem
 
02:34:32.150 --> 02:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
that this uh is that creates the
 
02:34:33.750 --> 02:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
occasion for this are there other
 
02:34:35.270 --> 02:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
problems or questions that you hope the
 
02:34:37.670 --> 02:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
commission would look into so i i would
 
02:34:40.309 --> 02:34:40.319 align:start position:0%
say genuinely generally
 
02:34:42.070 --> 02:34:42.080 align:start position:0%
if you try to look up turnout numbers in
 
02:34:43.910 --> 02:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire you can easily find them
 
02:34:45.670 --> 02:34:45.680 align:start position:0%
for state elections
 
02:34:47.349 --> 02:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
because that's that all data is is
 
02:34:48.550 --> 02:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
calculated and collected at the
 
02:34:50.389 --> 02:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's website we don't
 
02:34:52.469 --> 02:34:52.479 align:start position:0%
have a similar mechanism to track
 
02:34:54.469 --> 02:34:54.479 align:start position:0%
turnout at local elections we could go
 
02:34:56.070 --> 02:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
in town by down
 
02:34:58.309 --> 02:34:58.319 align:start position:0%
but it certainly isn't simple but i'd
 
02:35:00.469 --> 02:35:00.479 align:start position:0%
also want to look at the
 
02:35:03.830 --> 02:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh incumbency rates at local levels how
 
02:35:05.670 --> 02:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
often does somebody get reelected over
 
02:35:07.349 --> 02:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
and over again what's their how does
 
02:35:08.630 --> 02:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
that compare
 
02:35:10.389 --> 02:35:10.399 align:start position:0%
for cities versus town if there's more
 
02:35:10.399 --> 02:35:11.429 align:start position:0%
for cities versus town if there's more
turnover

02:35:11.429 --> 02:35:11.439 align:start position:0%
turnover
 
02:35:13.510 --> 02:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
if there's less turnover how how that
 
02:35:15.510 --> 02:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
produces it and really anything else the
 
02:35:19.270 --> 02:35:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:21.190 --> 02:35:21.200 align:start position:0%
any other questions from from committee
 
02:35:23.990 --> 02:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
members for representative sweeney
 
02:35:26.870 --> 02:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none thank you thank you
 
02:35:28.710 --> 02:35:28.720 align:start position:0%
does anyone else want to testify on this
 
02:35:30.950 --> 02:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
bill i have no pink cards indicating
 
02:35:30.960 --> 02:35:32.070 align:start position:0%
bill i have no pink cards indicating
that

02:35:32.070 --> 02:35:32.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:35:33.750 --> 02:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
anyone here in the hall want to testify
 
02:35:33.760 --> 02:35:34.630 align:start position:0%
anyone here in the hall want to testify
on

02:35:34.630 --> 02:35:34.640 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:35:34.640 --> 02:35:38.150 align:start position:0%
on
hb-1008

02:35:38.150 --> 02:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:39.590 --> 02:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
seeing none i'm going to close the
 
02:35:42.630 --> 02:35:42.640 align:start position:0%
public hearing on hb1008
 
02:35:46.309 --> 02:35:46.319 align:start position:0%
and open the public hearing on hb1082
 
02:35:47.910 --> 02:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
and in doing so i'm going to recognize
 
02:35:50.230 --> 02:35:50.240 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor of this legislation
 
02:35:52.830 --> 02:35:52.840 align:start position:0%
representative catherine pluto o'brien
 
02:35:57.030 --> 02:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
hi i'm going to read to you um
 
02:36:00.150 --> 02:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
what i wrote back in 2019 when this was
 
02:36:01.830 --> 02:36:01.840 align:start position:0%
first presented
 
02:36:03.750 --> 02:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
i still think it's a good bill it's the
 
02:36:08.630 --> 02:36:08.640 align:start position:0%
same language and the same things apply
 
02:36:11.110 --> 02:36:11.120 align:start position:0%
this bill ought to pass to preserve the
 
02:36:13.510 --> 02:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
integrity and nonpartisan nature of the
 
02:36:15.510 --> 02:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
offices of secretary of state and
 
02:36:15.520 --> 02:36:16.630 align:start position:0%
offices of secretary of state and
treasurer

02:36:16.630 --> 02:36:16.640 align:start position:0%
treasurer
 
02:36:18.710 --> 02:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
the two other states where these offices
 
02:36:21.110 --> 02:36:21.120 align:start position:0%
are elected by their legislature have
 
02:36:23.030 --> 02:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
either outlawed the practice of forming
 
02:36:24.870 --> 02:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
political action committees for these
 
02:36:26.790 --> 02:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
offices and that's in maine
 
02:36:29.270 --> 02:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
or the creation of pacs to campaign for
 
02:36:31.190 --> 02:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
these offices is considered by the
 
02:36:34.469 --> 02:36:34.479 align:start position:0%
legislature to be so anti-anti-ethnic
 
02:36:36.309 --> 02:36:36.319 align:start position:0%
it's a tough word to say out loud
 
02:36:38.389 --> 02:36:38.399 align:start position:0%
anti-ethical to good governance that the
 
02:36:40.469 --> 02:36:40.479 align:start position:0%
current secretary of state reports that
 
02:36:42.230 --> 02:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
it would not be done and that current
 
02:36:44.870 --> 02:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
secretary of state at that time was
 
02:36:46.309 --> 02:36:46.319 align:start position:0%
trey haggart
 
02:36:53.030 --> 02:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:55.349 --> 02:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
now one of the things that came to my
 
02:36:55.359 --> 02:36:56.870 align:start position:0%
now one of the things that came to my
notice

02:36:56.870 --> 02:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
notice
 
02:37:00.070 --> 02:37:00.080 align:start position:0%
back in 2019 was
 
02:37:00.080 --> 02:37:01.270 align:start position:0%
back in 2019 was
that

02:37:01.270 --> 02:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:37:02.950 --> 02:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
with the maine law
 
02:37:04.870 --> 02:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
and i i wanted to get a little bit more
 
02:37:07.110 --> 02:37:07.120 align:start position:0%
information because maine outlawed these
 
02:37:11.270 --> 02:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:14.469 --> 02:37:14.479 align:start position:0%
so i spoke to bruce peligwin who's you
 
02:37:17.190 --> 02:37:17.200 align:start position:0%
might know him as the former congressman
 
02:37:19.670 --> 02:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
from maine
 
02:37:21.830 --> 02:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
but prior to that he was the main state
 
02:37:25.670 --> 02:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
treasurer and even prior to that he was
 
02:37:29.190 --> 02:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
in the pension management business
 
02:37:31.590 --> 02:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
and when he was speaking to the
 
02:37:33.750 --> 02:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
main state treasurer and this is back in
 
02:37:37.110 --> 02:37:37.120 align:start position:0%
the mid 80s that man samuel shapiro
 
02:37:39.750 --> 02:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
about pension management services when
 
02:37:43.429 --> 02:37:43.439 align:start position:0%
shapiro told him he had a pack pelican
 
02:37:46.550 --> 02:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
that he wanted peliquin to donate to
 
02:37:48.790 --> 02:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
the pac was intended to help elect the
 
02:37:50.870 --> 02:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
same state legislatures who would later
 
02:37:52.469 --> 02:37:52.479 align:start position:0%
vote for him for state treasurer
 
02:37:54.870 --> 02:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
peliquin told me his jaw nearly hit the
 
02:37:56.230 --> 02:37:56.240 align:start position:0%
floor and he said it was the most
 
02:38:11.030 --> 02:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:13.349 --> 02:38:13.359 align:start position:0%
a lot a lot was was written about this
 
02:38:15.910 --> 02:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
and spoken about this a few years ago
 
02:38:18.309 --> 02:38:18.319 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire because
 
02:38:21.190 --> 02:38:21.200 align:start position:0%
we had a candidate for state
 
02:38:23.190 --> 02:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
secretary of state who did raise a lot
 
02:38:24.309 --> 02:38:24.319 align:start position:0%
of money
 
02:38:25.910 --> 02:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
and when you
 
02:38:27.750 --> 02:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
looked at how much money he raised in
 
02:38:29.990 --> 02:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
his pack which i should say he
 
02:38:32.150 --> 02:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
originally said he was going to use to
 
02:38:34.070 --> 02:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
help elect democrats but then walked
 
02:38:36.070 --> 02:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
that back
 
02:38:38.309 --> 02:38:38.319 align:start position:0%
and you do the math on that
 
02:38:40.950 --> 02:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
he raised about
 
02:38:43.270 --> 02:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
twelve hundred dollars per
 
02:38:45.670 --> 02:38:45.680 align:start position:0%
person in the legislature now in my town
 
02:38:47.830 --> 02:38:47.840 align:start position:0%
we have ten state representatives
 
02:38:50.389 --> 02:38:50.399 align:start position:0%
to his credit this man was pretty open
 
02:38:53.190 --> 02:38:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:55.670 --> 02:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
available to us and i got to talk to him
 
02:38:57.830 --> 02:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
on the phone a few times at least once
 
02:39:00.070 --> 02:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
that i recall and he he offered to come
 
02:39:01.910 --> 02:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
to my community and talk to state
 
02:39:03.429 --> 02:39:03.439 align:start position:0%
representatives that wanted to meet him
 
02:39:06.150 --> 02:39:06.160 align:start position:0%
in person myself and another
 
02:39:07.830 --> 02:39:07.840 align:start position:0%
state representative came and spoke to
 
02:39:09.510 --> 02:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
him at a church
 
02:39:11.830 --> 02:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
there were cookies there was coffee we
 
02:39:13.670 --> 02:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
spoke for about an hour
 
02:39:16.550 --> 02:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
but for the um the amount of money he
 
02:39:20.230 --> 02:39:20.240 align:start position:0%
raised per capita you know by per capita
 
02:39:22.309 --> 02:39:22.319 align:start position:0%
and i'm saying her 10 state
 
02:39:24.790 --> 02:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
representatives in derry that cost
 
02:39:26.469 --> 02:39:26.479 align:start position:0%
twelve thousand dollars now i don't care
 
02:39:28.230 --> 02:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
if it's coming from
 
02:39:30.550 --> 02:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
the canadian border it shouldn't and
 
02:39:31.990 --> 02:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
those cookies they were they were
 
02:39:33.750 --> 02:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
delicious but
 
02:39:36.070 --> 02:39:36.080 align:start position:0%
that should not cost twelve thousand
 
02:39:36.080 --> 02:39:38.309 align:start position:0%
that should not cost twelve thousand
dollars

02:39:38.309 --> 02:39:38.319 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:39:38.319 --> 02:39:39.030 align:start position:0%
dollars
to

02:39:39.030 --> 02:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:39:40.389 --> 02:39:40.399 align:start position:0%
he doesn't need the twelve thousand
 
02:39:41.990 --> 02:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
dollars there's a point of time when
 
02:39:43.670 --> 02:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
you're elected in november and then

even have to meet with us in person that
 
02:39:56.950 --> 02:39:56.960 align:start position:0%

so
 
02:40:01.190 --> 02:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to head this off in the
 
02:40:03.110 --> 02:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
future and i don't know what what the
 
02:40:05.270 --> 02:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
money has been spent on since then the
 
02:40:07.030 --> 02:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
the man raised about three hundred
 
02:40:08.870 --> 02:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars to run for secretary of
 
02:40:10.950 --> 02:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
state came pretty close to to winning
 
02:40:15.590 --> 02:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:18.150 --> 02:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
i have um
 
02:40:20.309 --> 02:40:20.319 align:start position:0%
i also have a former state reporter this
 
02:40:21.910 --> 02:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
was a bipartisan bill and a former state
 
02:40:24.550 --> 02:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
representative from the seacoast area
 
02:40:25.670 --> 02:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
bill's uh
 
02:40:27.349 --> 02:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
jim splain
 
02:40:28.389 --> 02:40:28.399 align:start position:0%
uh he
 
02:40:30.710 --> 02:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
he was in favor of this as well and even
 
02:40:32.790 --> 02:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
wrote an editorial and the
 
02:40:36.070 --> 02:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:37.590 --> 02:40:37.600 align:start position:0%
in-depth nh
 
02:40:39.429 --> 02:40:39.439 align:start position:0%
that i would share with anyone and i did
 
02:40:42.230 --> 02:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
back when i first brought this bill up
 
02:40:44.309 --> 02:40:44.319 align:start position:0%
asking that this law be passed as well
 
02:40:46.389 --> 02:40:46.399 align:start position:0%
so this is a bipartisan bill
 
02:40:48.950 --> 02:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
the lead sponsor on it back in 2019 was
 
02:40:50.630 --> 02:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
a democrat i just
 
02:40:52.550 --> 02:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
wanted to bring it back quickly
 
02:40:54.630 --> 02:40:54.640 align:start position:0%
in the second year and get this done so
 
02:40:56.630 --> 02:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
i didn't go around looking for other uh
 
02:40:58.950 --> 02:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
sponsors for for this bill but i'm sure
 
02:41:00.870 --> 02:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
i could have found many of them and of
 
02:41:04.790 --> 02:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
course again democrats as well as myself
 
02:41:06.790 --> 02:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
so if i have if there are any questions
 
02:41:08.389 --> 02:41:08.399 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to do my best to answer
 
02:41:08.399 --> 02:41:09.190 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to do my best to answer

thank you mr chairman
 
02:41:57.269 --> 02:41:57.279 align:start position:0%
uh i'll be as brief as i can first of
 
02:42:00.550 --> 02:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
all this bill would require that
 
02:42:02.070 --> 02:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
it would change the timeline for the
 
02:42:04.230 --> 02:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
charter amendment process the timeline
 
02:42:06.790 --> 02:42:06.800 align:start position:0%
for the charter amendment process
 
02:42:08.309 --> 02:42:08.319 align:start position:0%
was put into law
 
02:42:10.469 --> 02:42:10.479 align:start position:0%
generally prior to federal requirements
 
02:42:12.710 --> 02:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
that absentee ballots be
 
02:42:15.830 --> 02:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
distributed 45 days prior to an election
 
02:42:18.710 --> 02:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
and so this bill attempted to address
 
02:42:21.510 --> 02:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
that so that if a community was holding
 
02:42:23.670 --> 02:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
a special municipal election on the date
 
02:42:26.070 --> 02:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
of the state primary the absentee
 
02:42:27.990 --> 02:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
ballots for both the
 
02:42:30.309 --> 02:42:30.319 align:start position:0%
municipal election in the state primary
 
02:42:32.630 --> 02:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
election would be available 45 days
 
02:42:34.550 --> 02:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
prior to the
 
02:42:36.550 --> 02:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
to the election
 
02:42:38.630 --> 02:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
i sponsored the bill after conversation
 
02:42:40.710 --> 02:42:40.720 align:start position:0%
with the manchester city clerk and i
 
02:42:42.070 --> 02:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
later learned
 
02:42:45.910 --> 02:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
that over in the senate senate bill 423
 
02:42:49.269 --> 02:42:49.279 align:start position:0%
sponsored by senators dallas andro
 
02:42:52.150 --> 02:42:52.160 align:start position:0%
kavanaugh soucy and representative long
 
02:42:54.150 --> 02:42:54.160 align:start position:0%
was also introduced and there's overlap
 
02:42:56.710 --> 02:42:56.720 align:start position:0%
between that bill and and mine
 
02:42:58.630 --> 02:42:58.640 align:start position:0%
so i would respectfully request that the
 
02:43:01.510 --> 02:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
committee find house bill 1242 an
 
02:43:03.510 --> 02:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate and when the
 
02:43:05.670 --> 02:43:05.680 align:start position:0%
senate bill cross is over we can take a
 
02:43:08.630 --> 02:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
look at it at that time i see no reason
 
02:43:10.630 --> 02:43:10.640 align:start position:0%
for the committee to be spending time
 
02:43:12.870 --> 02:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
working on two bills okay so you do want
 
02:43:14.550 --> 02:43:14.560 align:start position:0%
this you're recommending when we meet an
 
02:43:17.269 --> 02:43:17.279 align:start position:0%
executive session we found itl correct
 
02:43:17.279 --> 02:43:18.070 align:start position:0%
executive session we found itl correct
okay

02:43:18.070 --> 02:43:18.080 align:start position:0%

02:43:20.710 --> 02:43:20.720 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
02:43:22.710 --> 02:43:22.720 align:start position:0%
okay um i don't know if you want to take
 
02:43:24.950 --> 02:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
any questions at this point then
 
02:43:27.190 --> 02:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
probably not probably there are none but
 
02:43:27.200 --> 02:43:28.950 align:start position:0%
