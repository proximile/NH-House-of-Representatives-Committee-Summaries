figure out where where they needed to go
 
00:20:07.029 --> 00:20:07.039 align:start position:0%
in order to
 
00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:11.360 align:start position:0%

i have a question for lba
 
00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:15.110 align:start position:0%
i have a question for lba
okay

00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:18.549 --> 00:21:18.559 align:start position:0%
um mike yesterday when i contacted you
 
00:21:22.149 --> 00:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
the um this 26 million was
 
00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
what i was trying to understand
 
00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
from a fiscal committee point of view
 
00:21:30.149 --> 00:21:30.159 align:start position:0%
how did it get there
 
00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
how was it handled with fiscal how was
 
00:21:35.029 --> 00:21:35.039 align:start position:0%
it handled with governor and council can
 
00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
you explain to everyone
 
00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
how it was handled and how much was
 
00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
handled in this process
 
00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
sure uh just for the record mike kane
 
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
the legislative budget assistant so it's
 
00:21:51.669 --> 00:21:51.679 align:start position:0%
kind of a brief uh recap of history um
 
00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
you'll remember the 2020 the the state
 
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
was under a state of emergency um
 
00:21:59.270 --> 00:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
due to covid
 
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
as a result
 
00:22:04.549 --> 00:22:04.559 align:start position:0%
the governor had this emergency powers
 
00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
where he could act
 
00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
and direct the agencies to accept and
 
00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
authorize them to spend funds
 
00:22:13.669 --> 00:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
during without fiscal without executive
 
00:22:13.679 --> 00:22:14.710 align:start position:0%
during without fiscal without executive
council

00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
council
 
00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
uh during that time specifically the
 
00:22:18.789 --> 00:22:18.799 align:start position:0%
state of emergency so during that time
 
00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:20.320 align:start position:0%
in multiple
 
00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
uh instances
 
00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
fema funds were made available to the
 
00:22:26.549 --> 00:22:26.559 align:start position:0%
state and so fema there's technically no
 
00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
limit on the amount of fema funds that
 
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
are available to a state
 
00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
um it just really has to be fema
 
00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
eligible expenditures and you get the
 
00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
approval of the federal government
 
00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:40.400 align:start position:0%
so during 20 uh into 21
 
00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
multiple actions were taking place
 
00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:44.240 align:start position:0%
initially to authorize the governor
 
00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
authorizing hhs uh to expend fema funds
 
00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
um and then to put it into
 
00:22:51.909 --> 00:22:51.919 align:start position:0%
it was usually like two or three classes
 
00:22:53.669 --> 00:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
would be put into but then the agency
 
00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
was given the authority under the
 
00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
emergency powers to transfer as
 
00:22:58.630 --> 00:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
necessary so a majority of that was
 
00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:00.640 align:start position:0%
going into class 20
 
00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
knowing that the agencies could always
 
00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
transfer during the state of emergency
 
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
to where it was needed
 
00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
so multiple instances um
 
00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
there would be amendments increases
 
00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
decreases to the femur amount to the
 
00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
state match amount or the 25 percent at
 
00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
the time
 
00:23:19.029 --> 00:23:19.039 align:start position:0%
uh for the state match which they would
 
00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
receive from cares funds again outside
 
00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
of fiscal outside of executive councils
 
00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
outside of the budget process so not a
 
00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
involved in
 
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
to that level of detail that you used to
 
00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
so all those actions it's upwards of
 
00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
between the state match and the fertile
 
00:23:40.789 --> 00:23:40.799 align:start position:0%
match over 212 million dollars of fema
 
00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:42.320 align:start position:0%
funds um
 
00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
were available like an authorization to
 
00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
the department to use
 
00:23:48.149 --> 00:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
uh through those years you can see in
 
00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
this item in 21 362
 
00:23:54.149 --> 00:23:54.159 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 22 88.3 million dollars
 
00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
of that is still available um
 
00:23:59.350 --> 00:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
if we were still operating under
 
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
the emergency orders and using that the
 
00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
governor was using that same process you
 
00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
would not see this item but once that
 
00:24:07.909 --> 00:24:07.919 align:start position:0%
emergency order ended
 
00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
things have changed what comes to fiscal
 
00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
instead of an informational item of
 
00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:14.240 align:start position:0%
we've accepted we've transferred
 
00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
these funds fiscal in executive council
 
00:24:19.269 --> 00:24:19.279 align:start position:0%
now being asked to approve any transfers
 
00:24:21.909 --> 00:24:21.919 align:start position:0%
or acceptance this is the first transfer
 
00:24:25.029 --> 00:24:25.039 align:start position:0%
out of class 20 uh action number one
 
00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:27.440 align:start position:0%
into attic class 20 current expense
 
00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
where most of it
 
00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
was budgeted over the last year or so
 
00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
into contracts for operational services
 
00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
because yes it's eligible fema funds now
 
00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
you have an idea of what you want to use
 
00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
these funds for um and then this the
 
00:24:43.029 --> 00:24:43.039 align:start position:0%
second part is the accept and expend of
 
00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
an additional 43.5 which again last year
 
00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
would have just gone through and the
 
00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
governor would have written a letter to
 
00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
hhs authorizing them to accept these
 
00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
funds but now since that state of
 
00:24:56.149 --> 00:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
emergency has ended they do come and ask
 
00:24:58.310 --> 00:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
fiscal and gnc to approve the accept and
 
00:25:00.789 --> 00:25:00.799 align:start position:0%
expand of those additional fema funds so
 
00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:02.320 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the history how we got
 
00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
here so you wouldn't remember fiscal or
 
00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
the finance committee's budgeting x
 
00:25:09.909 --> 00:25:09.919 align:start position:0%
amount in class 20 or class 103 because
 
00:25:11.909 --> 00:25:11.919 align:start position:0%
that all happened
 
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
did you have a follow-up yeah and the
 
00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
follow-up is last year's money required
 
00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
a match
 
00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
this year the money we're talking about
 
00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
here is 100
 
00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
federal 100 instead of the 25
 
00:25:30.549 --> 00:25:30.559 align:start position:0%
uh state match that you're used to
 
00:25:32.549 --> 00:25:32.559 align:start position:0%
hearing about in fema for mostly the
 
00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
safety items the federal government
 
00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
during the state of emergency through
 
00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
march i believe in the department can
 
00:25:39.909 --> 00:25:39.919 align:start position:0%
clarify or verify that uh will support
 
00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:50.149 --> 00:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:52.240 align:start position:0%

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
may i make a question about the bill we
 
00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
just passed i it didn't wasn't germaine
 
00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
to the vote itself but i do want to put
 
00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:19.360 align:start position:0%
something on the record okay certainly
 
00:27:21.269 --> 00:27:21.279 align:start position:0%
okay so um
 
00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:23.440 align:start position:0%
so i realize the
 
00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:24.710 align:start position:0%
so i realize the
uh

00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:27.440 align:start position:0%
hurried nature the emergent nature of
 
00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
getting this funding i i just want to
 
00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
point out that
 
00:27:32.789 --> 00:27:32.799 align:start position:0%
the governor
 
00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
on facebook already advertised that
 
00:27:37.269 --> 00:27:37.279 align:start position:0%
these uh
 
00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
booster blitz was going to take place
 
00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
and so i think there was a little cart
 
00:27:45.269 --> 00:27:45.279 align:start position:0%
before the horse there that we can
 
00:27:48.149 --> 00:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
excuse because of the emergent nature of
 
00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
this but
 
00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
but normally uh
 
00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
advertising that the money is or the
 
00:27:55.269 --> 00:27:55.279 align:start position:0%
program's going to be there because the
 
00:27:57.190 --> 00:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
expectation of the money being there
 
00:27:59.830 --> 00:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
that should not come before the actual
 
00:28:02.389 --> 00:28:02.399 align:start position:0%
vote as a rule i think so
 
00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:04.720 align:start position:0%
that's that's my comment thank you okay
 
00:28:06.389 --> 00:28:06.399 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:28:06.399 --> 00:28:08.070 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
okay

00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:08.950 align:start position:0%
okay
yes

00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
sorry rep
 
00:28:12.149 --> 00:28:12.159 align:start position:0%
senator mars
 
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:14.320 align:start position:0%
yeah this kind of went a lot faster than
 
00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
i thought it was going to go but um
 
00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
on this particular item that we just
 
00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:21.200 align:start position:0%
passed um
 
00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
the commissioner i'm just going to make
 
00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
a suggestion in the future because
 
00:28:29.269 --> 00:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
none of us knew about this kind of money
 
00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
and and that's kind of strange for this
 
00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:32.470 align:start position:0%
and and that's kind of strange for this
group

00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
group
 
00:28:33.669 --> 00:28:33.679 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:28:35.269 --> 00:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
so we have all this federal money
 
00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
sitting in accounts um whether it's
 
00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
class 20 or not class 20. um we never
 
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
talked about any of that in the budget
 
00:28:44.789 --> 00:28:44.799 align:start position:0%
phase and the um
 
00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
i just think it might be beneficial
 
00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
to understand
 
00:28:51.669 --> 00:28:51.679 align:start position:0%
how much money you know we can we can
 
00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
look at this 88 and you're transferring
 
00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
26 out of it but are there is there more
 
00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
dollars in hhs in other accounts that
 
00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
are federal funds that are sitting there
 
00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
waiting for decisions to be made that
 
00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:10.720 align:start position:0%
emergency like decisions i get that but
 
00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:29:15.269 --> 00:29:15.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:16.789 --> 00:29:16.799 align:start position:0%
so there are
 
00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
several accounting units within hhs that
 
00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
are related to covid yes and
 
00:29:24.389 --> 00:29:24.399 align:start position:0%
um none of them were included in the
 
00:29:26.389 --> 00:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
budget process if all of them have
 
00:29:27.909 --> 00:29:27.919 align:start position:0%
either went through the state of
 
00:29:30.789 --> 00:29:30.799 align:start position:0%
emergency into our budget or have come
 
00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
before fiscal we we did actually bring a
 
00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
fema item through fiscal i believe two
 
00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
meetings ago and transferred money out
 
00:29:43.269 --> 00:29:43.279 align:start position:0%
of class 20 um into class 103 um for
 
00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:45.200 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to remember what that was for
 
00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:46.549 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to remember what that was for
exactly

00:29:46.549 --> 00:29:46.559 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
00:29:48.789 --> 00:29:48.799 align:start position:0%
i don't remember but um there are
 
00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:50.480 align:start position:0%
several accounting units mostly in
 
00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
public health uh that are that are like
 
00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
this we just closed out
 
00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
the go for cares act accounting unit
 
00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
that um the spending on that just ended
 
00:30:02.549 --> 00:30:02.559 align:start position:0%
so that um doesn't exist as of today but
 
00:30:04.789 --> 00:30:04.799 align:start position:0%
did exist for the first uh six months or
 
00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
so of the fiscal year
 
00:30:09.269 --> 00:30:09.279 align:start position:0%
but there are several grants in public
 
00:30:09.279 --> 00:30:11.510 align:start position:0%
but there are several grants in public
health

00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
health
 
00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
follow up follow
 
00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
karen the
 
00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
you just brought up gopher and cares act
 
00:30:20.389 --> 00:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
and some of us are working with this
 
00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
billion dollars
 
00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
and it's
 
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
difficult at best to get enough meetings
 
00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
to talk about everything that's in there
 
00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
but there is a chart that says here's
 
00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
the original 900 and something this is
 
00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
what's been spent
 
00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:38.950 align:start position:0%
what's been spent
today

00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:30:41.269 --> 00:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
is that something that you're tracking
 
00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
on your end or is it being tracked in
 
00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
somewhere else
 
00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:45.909 align:start position:0%
somewhere else
so

00:30:45.909 --> 00:30:45.919 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:30:48.789 --> 00:30:48.799 align:start position:0%
uh it depends on the grants and i would
 
00:30:50.789 --> 00:30:50.799 align:start position:0%
say that hhs is always tracking
 
00:30:52.549 --> 00:30:52.559 align:start position:0%
internally everything that we're
 
00:30:52.559 --> 00:30:54.470 align:start position:0%
internally everything that we're
spending

00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
spending
 
00:30:56.149 --> 00:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
the cares act funding we tracked
 
00:30:58.389 --> 00:30:58.399 align:start position:0%
internally and we actually tracked the
 
00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
cares act funding for the whole state
 
00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:02.320 align:start position:0%
for a period of time until gopher had
 
00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
enough staff to to do it themselves so
 
00:31:05.909 --> 00:31:05.919 align:start position:0%
we were running the reports for the
 
00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
entire state for a while
 
00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:09.590 align:start position:0%
entire state for a while
um

00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:11.440 align:start position:0%
i can tell you in this fema account the
 
00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:14.480 align:start position:0%
52 million or yeah yeah i'm looking at
 
00:31:16.789 --> 00:31:16.799 align:start position:0%
the right one the 52 million that was in
 
00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
class 103 in the current modified budget
 
00:31:21.669 --> 00:31:21.679 align:start position:0%
on on number one that is already
 
00:31:24.149 --> 00:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
encumbered into contracts or planned for
 
00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
contracts um already which is why we
 
00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
needed to transfer funds into there
 
00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
so we do track that we actually
 
00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:33.440 align:start position:0%
because of the emergent nature of what
 
00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
we've been doing for the past two years
 
00:31:37.669 --> 00:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
typically we just track encumbrances and
 
00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
say you know we know we have these
 
00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:40.640 align:start position:0%
things encumbered and we sort of know
 
00:31:42.389 --> 00:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
what's coming up but because this
 
00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
happens so quickly we have a lot of
 
00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:46.640 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets that are tracking what's
 
00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:48.640 align:start position:0%
coming up um because there's so many
 
00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
things at once
 
00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:53.440 align:start position:0%
yes senator mars
 
00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
and trust me these questions would have
 
00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
been asked before we voted um so i'm
 
00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:01.360 align:start position:0%
just trying to go through it um
 
00:32:03.509 --> 00:32:03.519 align:start position:0%
i think what you just brought up karen
 
00:32:06.789 --> 00:32:06.799 align:start position:0%
um is exactly what this committee
 
00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
would like to be involved with they they
 
00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
would like to see
 
00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
not like they feel it's their obligation
 
00:32:16.549 --> 00:32:16.559 align:start position:0%
and this is no secret that i went to the
 
00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
governor about it
 
00:32:20.789 --> 00:32:20.799 align:start position:0%
you know if money's coming into new
 
00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:23.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire where's it going
 
00:32:25.909 --> 00:32:25.919 align:start position:0%
you have some pretty specific numbers in
 
00:32:25.919 --> 00:32:27.509 align:start position:0%
you have some pretty specific numbers in
here

00:32:27.509 --> 00:32:27.519 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:29.200 align:start position:0%
on the next item
 
00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
so i've got to believe you know what
 
00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
you're doing
 
00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
with these allocations
 
00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
and we may be a pest
 
00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
but i think if there's a way to
 
00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
keep us updated i think that's what
 
00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
we're asking
 
00:32:45.909 --> 00:32:45.919 align:start position:0%
and i think one of the difficulties and
 
00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:47.440 align:start position:0%
i i've been trying to figure out a
 
00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
solution to this too is that
 
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
i can only share so much with this
 
00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:53.360 align:start position:0%
committee because i have to take a
 
00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
contract through the gnc process and
 
00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
that process is confidential and can
 
00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
affect contract negotiations so on the
 
00:33:02.549 --> 00:33:02.559 align:start position:0%
next item when we start talking about it
 
00:33:03.909 --> 00:33:03.919 align:start position:0%
i can give you some high level
 
00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
information on how we came up with the
 
00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
numbers but if i go into detail i risk
 
00:33:09.909 --> 00:33:09.919 align:start position:0%
the negotiations we have going on with
 
00:33:12.389 --> 00:33:12.399 align:start position:0%
potential contractors and potentially
 
00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
pay a higher rate than we need to
 
00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
because we put a number out there that's
 
00:33:17.029 --> 00:33:17.039 align:start position:0%
higher than what they're willing to let
 
00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
us pay them so we have to be
 
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
careful how we share the information and
 
00:33:22.789 --> 00:33:22.799 align:start position:0%
anything we share with you is public so
 
00:33:24.549 --> 00:33:24.559 align:start position:0%
there's no like oh we're sharing this
 
00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
confidentially so i you know the i think
 
00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
the best we can do is share the more
 
00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
specific information afterwards which i
 
00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
know doesn't help the vote which is hard
 
00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
but i i don't want to put at risk our
 
00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
contract negotiations
 
00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:40.149 align:start position:0%
contract negotiations
follow

00:33:40.149 --> 00:33:40.159 align:start position:0%
follow
 
00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure others are going to have
 
00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
questions but
 
00:33:45.909 --> 00:33:45.919 align:start position:0%
what i what i see that you should be
 
00:33:47.669 --> 00:33:47.679 align:start position:0%
prepared for though
 
00:33:47.679 --> 00:33:48.549 align:start position:0%
prepared for though
is

00:33:48.549 --> 00:33:48.559 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:33:50.149 --> 00:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
at some point
 
00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:52.720 align:start position:0%
there's going to be an audit by the
 
00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
legislature of all these federal funds
 
00:33:56.389 --> 00:33:56.399 align:start position:0%
that come in
 
00:33:56.399 --> 00:33:57.509 align:start position:0%
that come in
um

00:33:57.509 --> 00:33:57.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:59.509 --> 00:33:59.519 align:start position:0%
during covet someone's going to ask the
 
00:34:01.669 --> 00:34:01.679 align:start position:0%
question and it's bipartisan right i
 
00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
mean you saw senator d'alessandro had
 
00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
the same questions that i was headed
 
00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
towards on on an item and
 
00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:09.030 align:start position:0%
towards on on an item and
i

00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:34:10.149 --> 00:34:10.159 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:34:12.149 --> 00:34:12.159 align:start position:0%
it's not just the executive branch that
 
00:34:13.589 --> 00:34:13.599 align:start position:0%
wants to see that
 
00:34:14.869 --> 00:34:14.879 align:start position:0%
i'm just
 
00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
no that's completely understandable i
 
00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
will tell you that
 
00:34:20.629 --> 00:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
kpmg did a single audit for fiscal year
 
00:34:22.470 --> 00:34:22.480 align:start position:0%
20 already they've
 
00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
completed that and
 
00:34:27.109 --> 00:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
um they audited all of our coveted funds
 
00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
because they all hit the threshold of
 
00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
being um
 
00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
being funds that have to be audited so
 
00:34:34.869 --> 00:34:34.879 align:start position:0%
they are uh currently audited already by
 
00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
the federal government right now
 
00:34:39.589 --> 00:34:39.599 align:start position:0%
and if i can just add um
 
00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:42.560 align:start position:0%
our our public health grants that we get
 
00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
from the cdc
 
00:34:45.430 --> 00:34:45.440 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of requirements around
 
00:34:47.109 --> 00:34:47.119 align:start position:0%
auditing those and they're very specific
 
00:34:48.869 --> 00:34:48.879 align:start position:0%
on what we can use them for so when you
 
00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
see us accepting or requesting to accept
 
00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
and expend a cdc grant
 
00:34:58.069 --> 00:34:58.079 align:start position:0%
those funds we have to submit a plan of
 
00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
action to them and anytime we change
 
00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
that plan of action we have to modify it
 
00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
and resubmit it to the cdc so those
 
00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
funds are very
 
00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
clearly tracked by the cdc in the
 
00:35:11.349 --> 00:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
department and what i can see is during
 
00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
the state of emergency we did accept
 
00:35:17.589 --> 00:35:17.599 align:start position:0%
some multi-year cdc grants and we're
 
00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
using some of those funds still today
 
00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:22.240 align:start position:0%
but we we do have the tracking and we do
 
00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
submit to cdc anytime we change what our
 
00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:31.589 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:35:31.589 --> 00:35:31.599 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:35:33.109 --> 00:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry if i
 
00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
went too fast i apologize so
 
00:35:39.829 --> 00:35:39.839 align:start position:0%
let us turn now to fis 21 um
 
00:35:39.839 --> 00:35:43.030 align:start position:0%
let us turn now to fis 21 um
363

00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
which is
 
00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
to accept and expend federal funds from
 
00:35:50.349 --> 00:35:50.359 align:start position:0%
arpa in the amount of
 
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
20.4 million
 
00:35:55.750 --> 00:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
and to authorize
 
00:35:58.790 --> 00:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
these and further authorize these funds
 
00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
to the accounts below
 
00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:04.640 align:start position:0%
and it will be used to respond to
 
00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:05.750 align:start position:0%
and it will be used to respond to
the

00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:11.750 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:13.349 align:start position:0%
and
so

00:36:13.349 --> 00:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
let me let me start out by asking are
 
00:36:17.829 --> 00:36:17.839 align:start position:0%
there any questions
 
00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
from people on the fiscal committee
 
00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh yes go ahead uh madam chair i have
 
00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
four questions uh do you want me to just
 
00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
go one at a time or rotate or just go
 
00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
one at a time okay uh i
 
00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:33.200 align:start position:0%
i think three of them make sense
 
00:36:35.829 --> 00:36:35.839 align:start position:0%
in combination but i'll i'll do that do
 
00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
whatever you need
 
00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
so um so good seeing you again
 
00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
um i i'm looking forward to voting in
 
00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:48.640 align:start position:0%
favor of uh this request uh but i i just
 
00:36:51.109 --> 00:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
do have some standard questions that i'd
 
00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
like to ask and find out what you what
 
00:36:56.550 --> 00:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
you've thought about and that is um
 
00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:57.349 align:start position:0%
you've thought about and that is um
i

00:36:57.349 --> 00:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:36:59.589 --> 00:36:59.599 align:start position:0%
i understand our your objective is to
 
00:37:02.069 --> 00:37:02.079 align:start position:0%
make our
 
00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
bed capacity more flexible so that we
 
00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
have more options on how to address our
 
00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
future needs that we aren't really able
 
00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
to anticipate fully now
 
00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:13.670 align:start position:0%
to anticipate fully now
but

00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:14.630 align:start position:0%
but
how

00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
as you've planned for this have you
 
00:37:21.349 --> 00:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
anticipated a goal for a benefit how
 
00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
would you describe
 
00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
what success looks like at the end of
 
00:37:27.829 --> 00:37:27.839 align:start position:0%
this effort
 
00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
sure thank you
 
00:37:31.589 --> 00:37:31.599 align:start position:0%
so right now our hospitals are running
 
00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
at 91 capacity and 91 percent makes it
 
00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
sound like there's still nine percent
 
00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:39.280 align:start position:0%
there but that nine percent could be in
 
00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
pediatrics maternity
 
00:37:43.349 --> 00:37:43.359 align:start position:0%
any of those what we do know is our
 
00:37:45.109 --> 00:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
hospitals are transferring patients as
 
00:37:47.430 --> 00:37:47.440 align:start position:0%
far away as connecticut and albany new
 
00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:50.320 align:start position:0%
york um to get the the right level of
 
00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
care that they need and we're not just
 
00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
talking about covet patients we're
 
00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
talking about patients with heart
 
00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:57.200 align:start position:0%
attacks and strokes and things like that
 
00:37:58.870 --> 00:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
when talking to the hospitals which we
 
00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:00.720 align:start position:0%
have a daily call with the hospitals now
 
00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:02.960 align:start position:0%
we used to have it twice a week it has
 
00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
escalated to daily
 
00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
you know they've listed things that
 
00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
would assist in moving people out of the
 
00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
hospital that do not need to be in the
 
00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:14.150 align:start position:0%
hospital that do not need to be in the
hospital

00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
one of the first groups are is elders
 
00:38:18.310 --> 00:38:18.320 align:start position:0%
that are looking for nursing home or
 
00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
assisted living level of care they are
 
00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
unable to return home
 
00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
but nursing homes and assisted livings
 
00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
due to this their staffing issues due to
 
00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:30.160 align:start position:0%
covid have shut down units have
 
00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:32.720 align:start position:0%
decreased capacity
 
00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
some of those people waiting in the
 
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.030 align:start position:0%
some of those people waiting in the
hospital

00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
00:38:37.829 --> 00:38:37.839 align:start position:0%
are new medicaid recipients which there
 
00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:40.240 align:start position:0%
is a very lengthy process to
 
00:38:41.829 --> 00:38:41.839 align:start position:0%
to approve medicaid when we were in the
 
00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
state of emergency we were able to
 
00:38:45.109 --> 00:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
bypass that process
 
00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
we cannot do that right now so
 
00:38:49.349 --> 00:38:49.359 align:start position:0%
what what we're doing with some of these
 
00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
funds is guaranteeing to the facility
 
00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
that if they take a medicaid pending uh
 
00:38:57.109 --> 00:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
client that we will guarantee payment if
 
00:38:59.190 --> 00:38:59.200 align:start position:0%
medicaid in the future is is not
 
00:39:03.109 --> 00:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
approved so our overall goal
 
00:39:06.069 --> 00:39:06.079 align:start position:0%
we've accounted for about 75 nursing
 
00:39:09.589 --> 00:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
facility beds for over the next 120 days
 
00:39:11.829 --> 00:39:11.839 align:start position:0%
and 30 assisted living beds now the
 
00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
flexibility i need is that if for some
 
00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:14.950 align:start position:0%
flexibility i need is that if for some
reason

00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
reason
 
00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
50 assisted living beds come open
 
00:39:19.589 --> 00:39:19.599 align:start position:0%
through this process and only 30 nursing
 
00:39:21.589 --> 00:39:21.599 align:start position:0%
home beds i need to be able to move that
 
00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
money around and use what we have to
 
00:39:27.829 --> 00:39:27.839 align:start position:0%
empty out the back door of the hospital
 
00:39:30.069 --> 00:39:30.079 align:start position:0%
ambulatory surgical centers which is
 
00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
also in this item we're planning for
 
00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
about 75 beds of hospitals being able to
 
00:39:38.069 --> 00:39:38.079 align:start position:0%
internally surge into ambulatory
 
00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
surgical centers and
 
00:39:41.589 --> 00:39:41.599 align:start position:0%
the department
 
00:39:44.069 --> 00:39:44.079 align:start position:0%
designating those areas as acute care
 
00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
beds versus ambulatory surgical beds
 
00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
rehab centers which have some capacity
 
00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
right now to take some of the nursing
 
00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:54.160 align:start position:0%
home residents that are waiting for
 
00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:56.320 align:start position:0%
placement and we can't find beds for
 
00:39:58.630 --> 00:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
we've accounted for we've allotted to 30
 
00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
beds in in rehab centers and then eight
 
00:40:05.589 --> 00:40:05.599 align:start position:0%
strike teams now we want to what we're
 
00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
trying to do and there are several
 
00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:08.800 align:start position:0%
facilities that have reached out several
 
00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
county facilities in a couple of private
 
00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
facilities that have said if you can get
 
00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
us the staffing we can open up a 25 bed
 
00:40:17.829 --> 00:40:17.839 align:start position:0%
unit in our nursing home and take those
 
00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:20.240 align:start position:0%
hospitalized patients
 
00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:23.200 align:start position:0%
so we're we're working with national
 
00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
agencies that are able to bring people
 
00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
in from out of state to help open up
 
00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
those units the the strike teams are
 
00:40:33.109 --> 00:40:33.119 align:start position:0%
fall into that we're we're hoping for
 
00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
eight so measuring success is getting
 
00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
capacity down below 80 percent which is
 
00:40:41.109 --> 00:40:41.119 align:start position:0%
where it was before this surge in our
 
00:40:41.119 --> 00:40:42.470 align:start position:0%
where it was before this surge in our
hospitals

00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
hospitals
 
00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
making sure that the people that need
 
00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
icu comprehensive icu level of care are
 
00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
in an actual icu unit we have several
 
00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:52.640 align:start position:0%
hospitals operating right now on a
 
00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
team-based model of care
 
00:40:57.190 --> 00:40:57.200 align:start position:0%
which is what you do
 
00:40:59.510 --> 00:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
as a contingency plan when you have too
 
00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
many patients and not enough staff
 
00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
we'd like to end that and go back to our
 
00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
normal standards of care
 
00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
follow-up certainly
 
00:41:11.829 --> 00:41:11.839 align:start position:0%
okay so this this is a follow-up to that
 
00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
specific question and i i just want to
 
00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:16.720 align:start position:0%
understand the apples to oranges numbers
 
00:41:21.829 --> 00:41:21.839 align:start position:0%
because you um you mentioned an uh 91
 
00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh uh at capacity now and then you've
 
00:41:27.829 --> 00:41:27.839 align:start position:0%
mentioned 75 beds and 30 beds for you
 
00:41:29.829 --> 00:41:29.839 align:start position:0%
know 105 beds
 
00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:32.720 align:start position:0%
so then you mentioned uh that would get
 
00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
us down our goal would be to an 80
 
00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
capacity so so are you effectively
 
00:41:42.309 --> 00:41:42.319 align:start position:0%
saying that those 105 beds represent 11
 
00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
percentage points
 
00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:46.240 align:start position:0%
so that's that's
 
00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
that is not one moment in time so
 
00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
it's over the next 120 days and even
 
00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
maybe beyond that um so i may be able to
 
00:41:57.510 --> 00:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
move 40 people out of the hospital today
 
00:41:59.670 --> 00:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
60 days from now i may have an another
 
00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
40 people in the hospital in those same
 
00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:02.550 align:start position:0%
40 people in the hospital in those same
beds

00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
beds
 
00:42:05.829 --> 00:42:05.839 align:start position:0%
so it's it's ongoing preservation of the
 
00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
capacity within the hospital it's not
 
00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
just one point in time
 
00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
okay so what does that 105 represent in
 
00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:14.240 align:start position:0%
terms of percentage points of your
 
00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:16.630 align:start position:0%
terms of percentage points of your
capacity

00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
capacity
 
00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
sorry it's a math question yes and the
 
00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
i i i just need the numbers so i can
 
00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
understand relatively what we're doing
 
00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:28.950 align:start position:0%
understand relatively what we're doing
so

00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:30.640 align:start position:0%
i don't want to misquote the number but
 
00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
i think it's around four that would be
 
00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:34.640 align:start position:0%
around four percent four percentage
 
00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:36.400 align:start position:0%
points based on what i'm remembering for
 
00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
a number so i'd want to verify that but
 
00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:39.430 align:start position:0%
a number so i'd want to verify that but
that's

00:42:39.430 --> 00:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:42:40.870 --> 00:42:40.880 align:start position:0%
all right if it's significantly
 
00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:42.400 align:start position:0%
different i just appreciate knowing
 
00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
just to add to that understanding that
 
00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
in the last six months one nursing home
 
00:42:52.069 --> 00:42:52.079 align:start position:0%
resident taking up a bed in a hospital
 
00:42:52.079 --> 00:42:53.270 align:start position:0%
resident taking up a bed in a hospital
right

00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
is equivalent to
 
00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
you know maybe even 20 acute care
 
00:42:59.109 --> 00:42:59.119 align:start position:0%
patients that only have three-day
 
00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
hospital stays so by moving one
 
00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
long-term care resident out you are able
 
00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
to service dozens of acute care patients
 
00:43:10.309 --> 00:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
thank you you're obviously dealing with
 
00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
a complex and changing situation so i
 
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate what you all are doing uh my
 
00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:20.480 align:start position:0%
my other question is uh similar to what
 
00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
i asked you in the last meeting and that
 
00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:26.720 align:start position:0%
is um i'm just curious
 
00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:28.160 align:start position:0%
to the extent
 
00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
that you know
 
00:43:33.670 --> 00:43:33.680 align:start position:0%
that uh the hospital system is hurting
 
00:43:36.309 --> 00:43:36.319 align:start position:0%
itself on a capacity level
 
00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
by terminating
 
00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:39.589 align:start position:0%
by terminating
um

00:43:39.589 --> 00:43:39.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
health care providers that do not want
 
00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:43.990 align:start position:0%
health care providers that do not want
to

00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:46.720 align:start position:0%
voluntarily take the injection
 
00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:48.800 align:start position:0%
so the cms
 
00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
mandate was there's an injunction on the
 
00:43:52.950 --> 00:43:52.960 align:start position:0%
cms mandate that came out last week
 
00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
there are some there are some hospital
 
00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
systems that have already chosen to go
 
00:43:59.670 --> 00:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
through with the mandate um the hospital
 
00:44:01.829 --> 00:44:01.839 align:start position:0%
association is going to track the number
 
00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
of people that leave specifically
 
00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
around the mandate but
 
00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
my my understanding just from general
 
00:44:11.589 --> 00:44:11.599 align:start position:0%
conversation is a very very tiny pool of
 
00:44:11.599 --> 00:44:12.630 align:start position:0%
conversation is a very very tiny pool of
people

00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:12.640 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:44:15.349 --> 00:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
okay i i would just like some visibility
 
00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
into that number if you are able to get
 
00:44:19.829 --> 00:44:19.839 align:start position:0%
somebody to develop it i'd appreciate it
 
00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
okay all right thank you madam chair
 
00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:28.240 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative leishman
 
00:44:30.069 --> 00:44:30.079 align:start position:0%
uh thanks man of chair
 
00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
and thanks for responding to all my
 
00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
written questions earlier
 
00:44:38.069 --> 00:44:38.079 align:start position:0%
so under the strike teams for long-term
 
00:44:39.589 --> 00:44:39.599 align:start position:0%
care staffing
 
00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:40.720 align:start position:0%
you have
 
00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
rates are estimated to be between two
 
00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:44.720 align:start position:0%
and three hundred dollars could you
 
00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:46.640 align:start position:0%
explain that is that
 
00:44:48.069 --> 00:44:48.079 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:44:48.079 --> 00:44:49.349 align:start position:0%
for the
overall

00:44:49.349 --> 00:44:49.359 align:start position:0%
overall
 
00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
individuals as a group or is that per
 
00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:52.790 align:start position:0%
individuals as a group or is that per
person

00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
so i wanted to clarify because i did
 
00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:56.240 align:start position:0%
have a conversation with representative
 
00:44:58.309 --> 00:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
erf this morning and i think i may have
 
00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
miscommunicated so uh that rate is what
 
00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
would be paid to the agency per person
 
00:45:06.550 --> 00:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
per hour
 
00:45:09.430 --> 00:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
so as a follow-up madam chair yes so the
 
00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
individual wouldn't be getting that it
 
00:45:13.829 --> 00:45:13.839 align:start position:0%
would be the contracting agency and they
 
00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
would determine whether that person got
 
00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
ten dollars or fifty dollars an hour i
 
00:45:19.829 --> 00:45:19.839 align:start position:0%
mean it's so i mean as part of the
 
00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:22.240 align:start position:0%
negotiations we have a sense of what
 
00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
rate they're paying the individuals
 
00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
typically but i
 
00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:26.470 align:start position:0%
typically but i
i

00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
somebody that's being paid ten dollars
 
00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
an hour is not who we're hiring in this
 
00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
type of situation you know no no you
 
00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
know rn is going to get paid 10 an hour
 
00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:38.560 align:start position:0%
so i think that it it probably varies
 
00:45:40.390 --> 00:45:40.400 align:start position:0%
per company just like any contracted
 
00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
employee but it's not
 
00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
this rate is a range for the contractor
 
00:45:49.349 --> 00:45:49.359 align:start position:0%
and one further question yes please go
 
00:45:50.870 --> 00:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
ahead thanks
 
00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
so your department is taking on an
 
00:45:55.750 --> 00:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
increasing role again and again and
 
00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
again and
 
00:45:59.270 --> 00:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
how is the staff handling this are
 
00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
things being
 
00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
put off that should be done in other
 
00:46:06.550 --> 00:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
areas to handle this pandemic or
 
00:46:07.829 --> 00:46:07.839 align:start position:0%
how are you
 
00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
handling this staff and overseeing this
 
00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
additional responsibility
 
00:46:15.349 --> 00:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
i don't have a lot of perspective since
 
00:46:16.870 --> 00:46:16.880 align:start position:0%
the entire time i've been commissioner
 
00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
we've been in a covid pandemic so um
 
00:46:21.829 --> 00:46:21.839 align:start position:0%
this has been kind of the volume of work
 
00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
since i came on board as commissioner
 
00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
we are operating all of our other
 
00:46:28.870 --> 00:46:28.880 align:start position:0%
programs in the department at full
 
00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:30.470 align:start position:0%
programs in the department at full
capacity

00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
capacity
 
00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
the staff within the department is
 
00:46:35.349 --> 00:46:35.359 align:start position:0%
stretch thin and burning out
 
00:46:38.069 --> 00:46:38.079 align:start position:0%
as you would expect and as every other
 
00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
health care worker
 
00:46:41.589 --> 00:46:41.599 align:start position:0%
in our state in every hospital in every
 
00:46:43.349 --> 00:46:43.359 align:start position:0%
nursing home they're feeling the same
 
00:46:48.230 --> 00:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:52.069 --> 00:46:52.079 align:start position:0%
uh senator guido you have a question
 
00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh turn your mind thank you madam chair
 
00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:54.870 align:start position:0%
uh turn your mind thank you madam chair
um

00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:57.510 --> 00:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
so that two to three hundred dollars
 
00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
would that be a number that is inclusive
 
00:47:02.069 --> 00:47:02.079 align:start position:0%
of all
 
00:47:04.069 --> 00:47:04.079 align:start position:0%
the expenses personnel operating
 
00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
benefits all that for those facilities
 
00:47:09.109 --> 00:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
or there are other outside that 200 300
 
00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
uh expenses no that that's the hourly
 
00:47:14.309 --> 00:47:14.319 align:start position:0%
rate paid to the contractor
 
00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:16.400 align:start position:0%
no other compensation
 
00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
i don't believe so not that i know thank
 
00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:21.109 align:start position:0%
i don't believe so not that i know thank
you

00:47:21.109 --> 00:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
yes senator susie thank you madam chair
 
00:47:26.630 --> 00:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
uh just please uh turn on your mic and
 
00:47:31.589 --> 00:47:31.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
00:47:34.710 --> 00:47:34.720 align:start position:0%
i think it's on now
 
00:47:37.589 --> 00:47:37.599 align:start position:0%
my question was relative to the
 
00:47:39.589 --> 00:47:39.599 align:start position:0%
ambulatory surgery centers and the
 
00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
ability to transfer into those my
 
00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
understanding is the transfer would be
 
00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:45.670 align:start position:0%
understanding is the transfer would be
discretionary

00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
discretionary
 
00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
um and i i just and i i'm very sensitive
 
00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:52.480 align:start position:0%
to what karen said earlier about the
 
00:47:53.910 --> 00:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
drilling down and getting into a
 
00:47:56.230 --> 00:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
granular explanation but i just wondered
 
00:47:58.790 --> 00:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
where the 9 million came from if you
 
00:48:00.549 --> 00:48:00.559 align:start position:0%
could just give me some top line as to
 
00:48:03.589 --> 00:48:03.599 align:start position:0%
how you establish that number given
 
00:48:06.069 --> 00:48:06.079 align:start position:0%
the limited services that the surgery
 
00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
centers are able to provide and given
 
00:48:09.589 --> 00:48:09.599 align:start position:0%
also the limited stay
 
00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
would it be an increased stay or
 
00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
increase service that
 
00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
i will answer part of that senator and
 
00:48:16.549 --> 00:48:16.559 align:start position:0%
then i'll look here and talk about the
 
00:48:18.309 --> 00:48:18.319 align:start position:0%
number part of it
 
00:48:21.589 --> 00:48:21.599 align:start position:0%
the goal here is that there is a state
 
00:48:24.309 --> 00:48:24.319 align:start position:0%
statute that allows the commissioner to
 
00:48:24.319 --> 00:48:25.589 align:start position:0%
statute that allows the commissioner to
designate

00:48:25.589 --> 00:48:25.599 align:start position:0%
designate
 
00:48:25.599 --> 00:48:26.470 align:start position:0%
designate
um

00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:26.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:28.640 align:start position:0%
other areas within the hospital as acute
 
00:48:31.109 --> 00:48:31.119 align:start position:0%
care centers so the goal would be to
 
00:48:34.309 --> 00:48:34.319 align:start position:0%
have a hospital that has an ambulatory
 
00:48:36.150 --> 00:48:36.160 align:start position:0%
surgical center either attached or
 
00:48:39.990 --> 00:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
detached to then designate that area as
 
00:48:42.069 --> 00:48:42.079 align:start position:0%
an acute care center not as an
 
00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
ambulatory surgical center so it would
 
00:48:46.470 --> 00:48:46.480 align:start position:0%
function the same way as a normal
 
00:48:48.790 --> 00:48:48.800 align:start position:0%
hospital bed without the hours without
 
00:48:52.630 --> 00:48:52.640 align:start position:0%
the license limits on it
 
00:48:55.109 --> 00:48:55.119 align:start position:0%
so i will speak to all of the rates so i
 
00:48:56.950 --> 00:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
worked with henry libman the director of
 
00:48:59.109 --> 00:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
medicaid to determine the average rates
 
00:49:00.790 --> 00:49:00.800 align:start position:0%
in all of these types of facilities to
 
00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
come up with the rate so the rate for
 
00:49:04.230 --> 00:49:04.240 align:start position:0%
the ambulatory surgical centers is
 
00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
actually based on a hospital rate um not
 
00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
the ambulatory surgery okay that makes
 
00:49:11.829 --> 00:49:11.839 align:start position:0%
sense as to why it's yes why it's higher
 
00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:14.240 align:start position:0%
yes thank you you're welcome okay
 
00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:16.640 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
oh yes i'm sorry
 
00:49:20.790 --> 00:49:20.800 align:start position:0%
thank you and good morning
 
00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:22.390 align:start position:0%
thank you and good morning
um

00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:24.390 --> 00:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
to my understanding that you know when
 
00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:26.640 align:start position:0%
we talk about nursing nursing facilities
 
00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:28.349 align:start position:0%
we talk about nursing nursing facilities
ambulatory

00:49:28.349 --> 00:49:28.359 align:start position:0%
ambulatory
 
00:49:30.549 --> 00:49:30.559 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation or any of those that you
 
00:49:33.829 --> 00:49:33.839 align:start position:0%
list there that
 
00:49:37.829 --> 00:49:37.839 align:start position:0%
it's not mandated that they make room
 
00:49:39.430 --> 00:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
that is correct
 
00:49:42.150 --> 00:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
okay so my my follow-up question is then
 
00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
when you when you designate
 
00:49:47.589 --> 00:49:47.599 align:start position:0%
so many beds for a particular facility
 
00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
how do you know that if you haven't done
 
00:49:52.549 --> 00:49:52.559 align:start position:0%
if you haven't negotiated a contract
 
00:49:55.349 --> 00:49:55.359 align:start position:0%
with them yet i have several facilities
 
00:49:57.030 --> 00:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
such as nursing facilities that have
 
00:49:58.470 --> 00:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
reached out and told me what their
 
00:50:01.109 --> 00:50:01.119 align:start position:0%
capacity is if we can
 
00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
provide them some of the the strike team
 
00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
uh personnel see all of these items are
 
00:50:09.270 --> 00:50:09.280 align:start position:0%
interrelated and depend on each other so
 
00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
if i can provide them a strike team they
 
00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:12.470 align:start position:0%
if i can provide them a strike team they
they

00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:50:15.109 --> 00:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
they said they can open up 25 beds
 
00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
we then move medicaid pending people
 
00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
that are waiting in the hospital into
 
00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:22.640 align:start position:0%
those 25 beds and i guarantee payment
 
00:50:24.950 --> 00:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
under with this funding so that they can
 
00:50:27.109 --> 00:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
move into the hospital it had two county
 
00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
facilities at least two county
 
00:50:31.030 --> 00:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
facilities and three private facilities
 
00:50:32.790 --> 00:50:32.800 align:start position:0%
already offer up units on their in their
 
00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:34.069 align:start position:0%
already offer up units on their in their
buildings

00:50:34.069 --> 00:50:34.079 align:start position:0%
buildings
 
00:50:36.069 --> 00:50:36.079 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:50:38.309 --> 00:50:38.319 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative earth
 
00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:50:45.109 --> 00:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
what analysis has been done regarding
 
00:50:45.119 --> 00:50:45.990 align:start position:0%
what analysis has been done regarding
the

00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:50:47.349 --> 00:50:47.359 align:start position:0%
the expectation of the trend for the
 
00:50:48.790 --> 00:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
rise and fall
 
00:50:52.309 --> 00:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:54.390 --> 00:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
that would definitely be a question for
 
00:50:57.510 --> 00:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
our state epidemiologist around delta
 
00:50:59.670 --> 00:50:59.680 align:start position:0%
because we have obviously have the
 
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
complicating factor now of the
 
00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:04.240 align:start position:0%
omnichrome uh variant too
 
00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
but i can certainly have uh dr chan
 
00:51:10.870 --> 00:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
get back to you on what the what the
 
00:51:13.030 --> 00:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
analysis is for the upward trend or the
 
00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:16.480 align:start position:0%
downward trend of delta
 
00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:17.349 align:start position:0%
downward trend of delta
okay

00:51:17.349 --> 00:51:17.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
if if you would send that to the lba so
 
00:51:23.190 --> 00:51:23.200 align:start position:0%
that we can all share that not just to
 
00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:28.870 --> 00:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
senator guida
 
00:51:30.549 --> 00:51:30.559 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair just a moment if i
 
00:51:32.870 --> 00:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
may for some commentary
 
00:51:34.950 --> 00:51:34.960 align:start position:0%
okay brief
 
00:51:38.069 --> 00:51:38.079 align:start position:0%
um i voted against the first item
 
00:51:38.079 --> 00:51:39.829 align:start position:0%
um i voted against the first item
because

00:51:39.829 --> 00:51:39.839 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:51:43.510 --> 00:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
it is a is geared towards prevention
 
00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
and understanding that this is a virus
 
00:51:47.430 --> 00:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
that was deliberately given gain of
 
00:51:48.790 --> 00:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
function another term is called
 
00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
weaponized we're watching variants
 
00:51:52.549 --> 00:51:52.559 align:start position:0%
continue to emerge
 
00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
and we continue to chase
 
00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
this ephemeral goal of stopping the
 
00:51:57.990 --> 00:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
spread of the virus
 
00:51:59.589 --> 00:51:59.599 align:start position:0%
so that was the reason for my vote
 
00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
against first i will support this
 
00:52:03.190 --> 00:52:03.200 align:start position:0%
measure because this is a treatment
 
00:52:04.790 --> 00:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
measure we are enabling treatment of
 
00:52:06.630 --> 00:52:06.640 align:start position:0%
people who have the virus
 
00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
not chasing the ephemeral ghost of
 
00:52:10.470 --> 00:52:10.480 align:start position:0%
trying to stop something
 
00:52:12.549 --> 00:52:12.559 align:start position:0%
that continues to mutate at an alarming
 
00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:14.640 align:start position:0%
rate and to spread all over the globe
 
00:52:18.630 --> 00:52:18.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr madam chair thank you
 
00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:20.790 align:start position:0%
thank you mr madam chair thank you
uh

00:52:20.790 --> 00:52:20.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
representative edwards uh thank you
 
00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:25.109 align:start position:0%
representative edwards uh thank you
um

00:52:25.109 --> 00:52:25.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:27.430 --> 00:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
maybe you already answered this but for
 
00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:30.160 align:start position:0%
the strike teams that you're that you're
 
00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:31.430 align:start position:0%
the strike teams that you're that you're
augmenting

00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
augmenting
 
00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:32.470 align:start position:0%
augmenting
um

00:52:32.470 --> 00:52:32.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:35.910 --> 00:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
do you know if those strike team members
 
00:52:39.270 --> 00:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
are going to be required to have
 
00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
been vaccinated
 
00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
i don't know that
 
00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:44.150 align:start position:0%
i don't know that
okay

00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:52:46.069 --> 00:52:46.079 align:start position:0%
again it's not going to affect my vote
 
00:52:48.630 --> 00:52:48.640 align:start position:0%
it's just an issue that's important to
 
00:52:52.390 --> 00:52:52.400 align:start position:0%
me so if we could get an answer
 
00:52:54.549 --> 00:52:54.559 align:start position:0%
the the overall goal with the strike
 
00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
teams is we will be
 
00:52:58.630 --> 00:52:58.640 align:start position:0%
there's not a lot of companies that can
 
00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
give me eight strike teams we will
 
00:53:02.710 --> 00:53:02.720 align:start position:0%
likely contract with four five six
 
00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
different companies to each provide one
 
00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:06.720 align:start position:0%
or two strike teams
 
00:53:09.349 --> 00:53:09.359 align:start position:0%
and we can certainly ask that question
 
00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
if as a private entity they've chosen to
 
00:53:14.549 --> 00:53:14.559 align:start position:0%
implement a mandate or not my
 
00:53:17.190 --> 00:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
my thought is that because the some of
 
00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:18.720 align:start position:0%
the facilities that they're sending
 
00:53:21.030 --> 00:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
their staff into have mandates that
 
00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
they've probably either
 
00:53:24.870 --> 00:53:24.880 align:start position:0%
only using people that have been
 
00:53:30.309 --> 00:53:30.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:34.549 --> 00:53:34.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:37.829 --> 00:53:37.839 align:start position:0%
saying none uh could i have a motion to
 
00:53:37.839 --> 00:53:39.109 align:start position:0%
saying none uh could i have a motion to
approve

00:53:39.109 --> 00:53:39.119 align:start position:0%
approve
 
00:53:39.119 --> 00:53:42.950 align:start position:0%
approve
