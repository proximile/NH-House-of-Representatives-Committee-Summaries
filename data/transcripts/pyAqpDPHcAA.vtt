um we had the hearing on establishing a
 
00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:11.039 align:start position:0%
task force to provide energy relief on
 
00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:12.370 align:start position:0%
task force to provide energy relief on
farms

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:12.380 align:start position:0%
farms
 
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.090 align:start position:0%
farms
and

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:14.100 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
um representative Bixby I think you had
 
00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.290 align:start position:0%
um representative Bixby I think you had
some

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:18.300 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:31.309 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:33.660 align:start position:0%
thank you so I did a little bit of
 
00:06:37.249 --> 00:06:37.259 align:start position:0%
calling around and uh Gathering of more
 
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:40.860 align:start position:0%
information I talked with uh Donald
 
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:44.340 align:start position:0%
crease who's the um
 
00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:46.919 align:start position:0%
the uh consumer advocate for energy in
 
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
the state and he gave me a number of
 
00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
um possible you know Avenues and
 
00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
suggestions to to look into
 
00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:00.180 align:start position:0%
um one of them uh so uh one of them was
 
00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:02.460 align:start position:0%
Senator Shaheen's office uh and
 
00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:05.360 align:start position:0%
Elizabeth McKenna who is a staffer there
 
00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:07.979 align:start position:0%
specializes in energy stuff I did follow
 
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
up with her uh he also suggested that
 
00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
um it would make sense to work with no
 
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire and the Farm Bureau
 
00:07:19.249 --> 00:07:19.259 align:start position:0%
and the Farmers Union as possible
 
00:07:21.589 --> 00:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
um avenues for providing assistance to
 
00:07:21.599 --> 00:07:23.210 align:start position:0%
um avenues for providing assistance to
Farmers

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:23.220 align:start position:0%
Farmers
 
00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:23.950 align:start position:0%
Farmers
um

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:23.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:28.020 align:start position:0%
and also clean energy New Hampshire uh
 
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire saves we're also
 
00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:31.610 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire saves we're also
um

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:31.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:35.689 --> 00:07:35.699 align:start position:0%
avenues that might uh be useful in in
 
00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:37.740 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:38.689 align:start position:0%
terms of
um

00:07:38.689 --> 00:07:38.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:42.529 --> 00:07:42.539 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh finding out in in terms
 
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:45.240 align:start position:0%
of sources of energy assistance for
 
00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.670 align:start position:0%
of sources of energy assistance for
Farmers

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
Farmers
 
00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:49.199 align:start position:0%
um and then
 
00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:52.500 align:start position:0%
um I also spoke with so I spoke with
 
00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:53.510 align:start position:0%
um I also spoke with so I spoke with
um

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.249 align:start position:0%
um
uh

00:07:55.249 --> 00:07:55.259 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:07:58.670 --> 00:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
uh with Elizabeth McKenna and she gave
 
00:08:02.089 --> 00:08:02.099 align:start position:0%
me a little bit more detail about the
 
00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:06.780 align:start position:0%
um what the USDA has uh and that's the
 
00:08:08.749 --> 00:08:08.759 align:start position:0%
which is also something that was
 
00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:11.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh in our
 
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
previous hearing which is the uh the
 
00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:16.020 align:start position:0%
reap program
 
00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:16.790 align:start position:0%
reap program
um

00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:20.280 align:start position:0%
which is re uh rural energy assistance
 
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
program I think is the that's what it
 
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
stands for that again rural rural energy
 
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
assistance program thank you I think
 
00:08:29.749 --> 00:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
that's the ACT what it stands for but
 
00:08:32.029 --> 00:08:32.039 align:start position:0%
I'm not gonna you know I'm not gonna
 
00:08:33.709 --> 00:08:33.719 align:start position:0%
um swear to it
 
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
um and that's uh run out of the
 
00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:43.380 align:start position:0%
um USD USDA Rural Development Office in
 
00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:46.980 align:start position:0%
Vermont uh and the contact person there
 
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
is Sarah Waring uh
 
00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:51.470 align:start position:0%
is Sarah Waring uh
and

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:51.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:52.850 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:52.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
the we also had some uh some input from
 
00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
uh or some additional information from
 
00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.150 align:start position:0%
uh or some additional information from
uh

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:02.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:09:05.329 --> 00:09:05.339 align:start position:0%
Tara Assad from the from the Council of
 
00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
state governments CSG uh and uh so she
 
00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
had she followed up a little bit with
 
00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:18.260 align:start position:0%
the rural development office and uh the
 
00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:21.420 align:start position:0%
application process for those reap loans
 
00:09:24.949 --> 00:09:24.959 align:start position:0%
seems to be fairly complicated uh it's
 
00:09:27.949 --> 00:09:27.959 align:start position:0%
the sort of thing that if you have a a
 
00:09:30.889 --> 00:09:30.899 align:start position:0%
medium or well what is officially called
 
00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:32.700 align:start position:0%
a small business which means up to 50
 
00:09:37.509 --> 00:09:37.519 align:start position:0%
like 50 million dollars then
 
00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
you you know if you if you are not at
 
00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
the small end of a small bit of that
 
00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
small business Spectrum then you
 
00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
probably have someone on staff who can
 
00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:49.380 align:start position:0%
go through all this stuff and figure out
 
00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:50.820 align:start position:0%
how to fill out all the forms and
 
00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:53.100 align:start position:0%
everything if you're a farmer it looks
 
00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:55.380 align:start position:0%
like it's going to be tough
 
00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:56.940 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:57.790 align:start position:0%
um so
um

00:09:57.790 --> 00:09:57.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:01.980 align:start position:0%
so uh that's
 
00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:05.220 align:start position:0%
but but that money is there there is
 
00:10:08.449 --> 00:10:08.459 align:start position:0%
with the um Ira there is
 
00:10:08.459 --> 00:10:08.990 align:start position:0%
with the um Ira there is
um

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:11.389 --> 00:10:11.399 align:start position:0%
the substantially more money has been
 
00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
put into that so uh that is some that is
 
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.310 align:start position:0%
put into that so uh that is some that is
a

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.090 align:start position:0%
a
um

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:17.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
that is a
 
00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:20.150 align:start position:0%
that is a
um

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:22.260 align:start position:0%
source of money that should be available
 
00:10:26.449 --> 00:10:26.459 align:start position:0%
to us but I think that we need to have a
 
00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:28.500 align:start position:0%
way to help farmers get that you know to
 
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
figure out how to get it
 
00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.449 align:start position:0%
figure out how to get it
um another

00:10:32.449 --> 00:10:32.459 align:start position:0%
um another
 
00:10:32.459 --> 00:10:33.290 align:start position:0%
um another
um

00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:33.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
another program or on
 
00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:39.060 align:start position:0%
another program in the state which is a
 
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
non-gov non-governmental program is
 
00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
through clean energy New Hampshire it's
 
00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
primarily at this point for small
 
00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:47.640 align:start position:0%
businesses I have not done further
 
00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
research on that this but it's um the
 
00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
circuit writer program uh and they work
 
00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:55.980 align:start position:0%
with towns and small businesses to help
 
00:10:57.829 --> 00:10:57.839 align:start position:0%
access and
 
00:11:00.949 --> 00:11:00.959 align:start position:0%
um renewable energy
 
00:11:00.959 --> 00:11:01.970 align:start position:0%
um renewable energy
um

00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:01.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:04.860 align:start position:0%
and uh so the
 
00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
one of the things that came up uh in
 
00:11:11.449 --> 00:11:11.459 align:start position:0%
many of these conversations was uh
 
00:11:14.569 --> 00:11:14.579 align:start position:0%
Cooperative Extension as a as a
 
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
potential way to help
 
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
um and so I had
 
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:19.790 align:start position:0%
um and so I had
um

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:23.100 align:start position:0%
I the current state of things there is
 
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:24.350 align:start position:0%
I the current state of things there is
that

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
um John Porter who is retired uh
 
00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:29.220 align:start position:0%
extension faculty who is still working
 
00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:31.980 align:start position:0%
part-time with them uh helping mostly
 
00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:34.740 align:start position:0%
with engineering Dairy engineering Farms
 
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
on programs on farms has done some
 
00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:41.160 align:start position:0%
assistance with solar with helping Farms
 
00:11:44.449 --> 00:11:44.459 align:start position:0%
get solar as well but uh he is part-time
 
00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:47.100 align:start position:0%
he is retired it's not he doesn't have
 
00:11:49.009 --> 00:11:49.019 align:start position:0%
the capacity to do it on a scale that
 
00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:57.829 --> 00:11:57.839 align:start position:0%
um I uh so I had invited Ken Lavallee to
 
00:11:59.870 --> 00:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
come in today Kendallville Valley is the
 
00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:04.700 align:start position:0%
director of Co-op extension and uh
 
00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
to help us figure out what we would need
 
00:12:11.329 --> 00:12:11.339 align:start position:0%
to do in order to uh develop a line in
 
00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:15.720 align:start position:0%

um
 
00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:22.740 align:start position:0%
helping farmers get re renewable energy
 
00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:24.240 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
uh so uh
 
00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:31.260 align:start position:0%
since he's not feeling well he he's not
 
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
here I was really hoping he could give
 
00:12:35.329 --> 00:12:35.339 align:start position:0%
us some advice on
 
00:12:38.269 --> 00:12:38.279 align:start position:0%
how we would what we would need to do to
 
00:12:40.009 --> 00:12:40.019 align:start position:0%
juggle the
 
00:12:40.019 --> 00:12:40.790 align:start position:0%
juggle the
um

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:44.569 --> 00:12:44.579 align:start position:0%
the way that monetary lines work in the
 
00:12:47.389 --> 00:12:47.399 align:start position:0%
state in coordination with uh
 
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
Cooperative Extension uh because often
 
00:12:53.769 --> 00:12:53.779 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if that's administered
 
00:12:56.569 --> 00:12:56.579 align:start position:0%
whether the chain of
 
00:12:59.509 --> 00:12:59.519 align:start position:0%
um funding is from the state to the
 
00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
university to Cooperative Extension or
 
00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:03.300 align:start position:0%
if there's a direct
 
00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:07.620 align:start position:0%
uh funding uh channel from the state to
 
00:13:12.949 --> 00:13:12.959 align:start position:0%
Cooperative Extension uh and uh so
 
00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:15.540 align:start position:0%
uh what I'm gonna have what I'll do is
 
00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:16.910 align:start position:0%
uh what I'm gonna have what I'll do is
I'll

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
I'll
 
00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
touch base with him tomorrow and let me
 
00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:22.700 align:start position:0%
see if I can get more information about
 
00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:26.940 align:start position:0%
how that whole funding process works uh
 
00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:27.889 align:start position:0%
how that whole funding process works uh
but

00:13:27.889 --> 00:13:27.899 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:13:27.899 --> 00:13:28.730 align:start position:0%
but
um

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:28.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:31.500 align:start position:0%
I don't but uh
 
00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
I think that uh
 
00:13:38.269 --> 00:13:38.279 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of good reasons to see
 
00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
if we can get a point person in
 
00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:42.680 align:start position:0%
Cooperative Extension to help with
 
00:13:47.389 --> 00:13:47.399 align:start position:0%
energy programs on farms because
 
00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
for one thing uh farmers
 
00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
are generally pretty comfortable talking
 
00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:55.200 align:start position:0%
with Cooperative Extension uh not
 
00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:57.180 align:start position:0%
necessarily so much with other branches
 
00:13:58.370 --> 00:13:58.380 align:start position:0%
of government
 
00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:00.250 align:start position:0%
of government
um

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:00.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
and and so
 
00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:08.820 align:start position:0%
and uh and Cooperative Extension has you
 
00:14:11.329 --> 00:14:11.339 align:start position:0%
know you know really earned their trust
 
00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:13.980 align:start position:0%
by being a very good technical resource
 
00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
over a broad range of areas from you
 
00:14:18.889 --> 00:14:18.899 align:start position:0%
know specific agricultural things to
 
00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:21.180 align:start position:0%
helping out with
 
00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:23.100 align:start position:0%
um mental health issues to helping out
 
00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
with reducing you know things that will
 
00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:27.540 align:start position:0%
reduce stress on Farmers by helping them
 
00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
out helping them
 
00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:32.700 align:start position:0%
uh get resources for financial planning
 
00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:37.500 align:start position:0%
and business planning uh so there's uh I
 
00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:39.060 align:start position:0%
think that
 
00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:40.310 align:start position:0%
think that
um

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:41.629 align:start position:0%
um
that

00:14:41.629 --> 00:14:41.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
that's probably our best Avenue but we
 
00:14:46.069 --> 00:14:46.079 align:start position:0%
need to figure out how to you know how
 
00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:49.260 align:start position:0%
to do that and whether that requires
 
00:14:51.889 --> 00:14:51.899 align:start position:0%
uh legislative action on our part or
 
00:14:53.509 --> 00:14:53.519 align:start position:0%
whether it's something where we need to
 
00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:56.100 align:start position:0%
intercede with the finance finance
 
00:14:59.810 --> 00:14:59.820 align:start position:0%
committee to help them uh fund it get
 
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:03.720 align:start position:0%
more funding uh and I really don't know
 
00:15:06.829 --> 00:15:06.839 align:start position:0%
how that works so I don't you have you
 
00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:09.060 align:start position:0%
done some work with Finance Judy
 
00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
oh limited work and
 
00:15:16.129 --> 00:15:16.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
if if we and that would turn this into
 
00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:21.660 align:start position:0%
an early bill that we would have to get
 
00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
out right away to finance if if we made
 
00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:26.220 align:start position:0%
any kind of amendment that made an
 
00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:27.710 align:start position:0%
any kind of amendment that made an
appropriation

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:27.720 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
so and I don't know that we'd be able to
 
00:15:33.949 --> 00:15:33.959 align:start position:0%
do that at this point I mean
 
00:15:33.959 --> 00:15:35.110 align:start position:0%
do that at this point I mean
um

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:39.060 align:start position:0%
just in this discussion I mean
 
00:15:41.389 --> 00:15:41.399 align:start position:0%
seems to me that there's a lot of
 
00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
players involved and I One
 
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
one group you didn't mention was the
 
00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:49.820 align:start position:0%
nrcf you know national resources
 
00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:52.260 align:start position:0%
I should have mentioned them too okay
 
00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
because they are well up in our in our
 
00:15:58.009 --> 00:15:58.019 align:start position:0%
neck of the woods in our County
 
00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:01.260 align:start position:0%
um they work extensively uh with the
 
00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:03.660 align:start position:0%
Farm Bureau do you need your microphone
 
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:08.100 align:start position:0%
thanks so they work extensively uh with
 
00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:09.480 align:start position:0%
the Farm Bureau
 
00:16:11.329 --> 00:16:11.339 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:14.940 align:start position:0%
the County Conservation uh Donald County
 
00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:18.060 align:start position:0%
Conservation group to get
 
00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
um equipment for Farmers that they can
 
00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:24.180 align:start position:0%
rent I mean they just purchased last
 
00:16:26.389 --> 00:16:26.399 align:start position:0%
year through a grant
 
00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
um a no-till sea drill that any farmer
 
00:16:32.509 --> 00:16:32.519 align:start position:0%
can rent we're all excited we're all
 
00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:34.860 align:start position:0%
going to be fighting to rent it
 
00:16:36.949 --> 00:16:36.959 align:start position:0%
um and then this year they've got
 
00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:39.740 align:start position:0%
another Grant to purchase something but
 
00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:43.320 align:start position:0%
they are really good at getting grants
 
00:16:46.129 --> 00:16:46.139 align:start position:0%
for farmers and assisting them and I
 
00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
think that
 
00:16:49.069 --> 00:16:49.079 align:start position:0%
instead of having
 
00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:53.100 align:start position:0%
the government us legislate anything if
 
00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
we could get the New Hampshire Farm
 
00:16:58.970 --> 00:16:58.980 align:start position:0%
Bureau UNH and them talking I think that
 
00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
so the way oh okay go ahead so the way
 
00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:12.360 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at this is the bill that is
 
00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:16.500 align:start position:0%
in front of us now is is not
 
00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:17.090 align:start position:0%
in front of us now is is not
um

00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:17.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:19.740 align:start position:0%
is not right and not what we would want
 
00:17:23.090 --> 00:17:23.100 align:start position:0%
to pass because we don't want to give
 
00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:24.890 align:start position:0%
to pass because we don't want to give
this

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:24.900 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:25.850 align:start position:0%
this
um

00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:25.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:30.409 --> 00:17:30.419 align:start position:0%
uh task to Department of Agriculture and
 
00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
there's other parts of it that are not
 
00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:36.360 align:start position:0%
really helpful so
 
00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:40.740 align:start position:0%
if we were to do anything to amend this
 
00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:42.900 align:start position:0%
um I think it would be we would have to
 
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
write up pretty much a whole brand new
 
00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:47.870 align:start position:0%
write up pretty much a whole brand new
bill

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:48.830 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:50.700 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:52.620 align:start position:0%
um I don't think that this bill is ready
 
00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:55.620 align:start position:0%
for prime time in any manner
 
00:17:59.390 --> 00:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
um personally I think that because of
 
00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:01.320 align:start position:0%
the discussion with this bill we've
 
00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:02.460 align:start position:0%
already got the New Hampshire Farm
 
00:18:04.909 --> 00:18:04.919 align:start position:0%
Bureau talking Trevor who is the one
 
00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:08.100 align:start position:0%
from Brookdale Farm that brought it to
 
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh the rep McGee's attention is a huge
 
00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
part of New Hampshire Farm Bureau and I
 
00:18:17.169 --> 00:18:17.179 align:start position:0%
know that on the policy we had a meeting
 
00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:19.620 align:start position:0%
I wasn't on the Monday morning meeting
 
00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:22.200 align:start position:0%
but we went over a lot of stuff and this
 
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
was brought up so they're going to be
 
00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:25.260 align:start position:0%
talking about starting up their energy
 
00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee again I mean so I think we
 
00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:29.220 align:start position:0%
need to
 
00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:31.320 align:start position:0%
let the players
 
00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:34.860 align:start position:0%
get involved and we have all these
 
00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:38.220 align:start position:0%
organizations for a reason in the state
 
00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:40.740 align:start position:0%
yeah it's very possible they may be able
 
00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:44.820 align:start position:0%
to come up with a program on their own
 
00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:46.310 align:start position:0%
to come up with a program on their own
so

00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:50.700 align:start position:0%
um the one thing I was thinking in terms
 
00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:51.650 align:start position:0%
um the one thing I was thinking in terms
of

00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:51.660 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:52.549 align:start position:0%
of
um

00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:55.980 align:start position:0%
extension is that it's it is one of the
 
00:18:58.730 --> 00:18:58.740 align:start position:0%
places that a lot of people look for for
 
00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
advice and uh that
 
00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:04.980 align:start position:0%
um there are
 
00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:07.980 align:start position:0%
um it sounds like the application
 
00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:11.160 align:start position:0%
process is sufficiently complicated that
 
00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:13.020 align:start position:0%
it would be very useful to have someone
 
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
have have a single person in the state
 
00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:17.820 align:start position:0%
who really really knows how that process
 
00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:19.620 align:start position:0%
works to be able to provide the
 
00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:21.169 align:start position:0%
works to be able to provide the
assistance

00:19:21.169 --> 00:19:21.179 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
um and I agree that the bill as
 
00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
presented to us uh will not achieve what
 
00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:30.900 align:start position:0%
is will not get to get us to where we
 
00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:34.620 align:start position:0%
want to be which is getting uh getting
 
00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:37.740 align:start position:0%
energy assistance to Farmers uh which
 
00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
where for which the money is out there
 
00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
at the federal level there are also
 
00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
programs that the in um like New
 
00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:46.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire saves at the state level uh
 
00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:49.500 align:start position:0%
that or the which is not not strictly
 
00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:53.100 align:start position:0%
which is also a part uh somewhat you
 
00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
know public-private type of program
 
00:19:57.890 --> 00:19:57.900 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:02.580 align:start position:0%
uh helping uh Farmers figure out which
 
00:20:04.789 --> 00:20:04.799 align:start position:0%
programs they need to go to how to get
 
00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
the application that's going to require
 
00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
someone who actually knows what's out
 
00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
there uh and as opposed to doing as
 
00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
opposed to having a committee and the
 
00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
bill proposes a committee and it's just
 
00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:19.380 align:start position:0%
a people a bunch of high-level people
 
00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
talking in a room and not actually
 
00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:25.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:28.010 align:start position:0%
 
mm-hmm

00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:28.020 align:start position:0%
mm-hmm
 
00:20:30.049 --> 00:20:30.059 align:start position:0%
well would it be
 
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative Howard thank
 
00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:33.590 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative Howard thank
you

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
um I agree that the committee doesn't
 
00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:37.260 align:start position:0%
seem like a good solution it seems like
 
00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:40.200 align:start position:0%
a parking lot to me and um and and it's
 
00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:42.660 align:start position:0%
made up of people who are are sort of
 
00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
who might be in the habit of parking
 
00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:47.580 align:start position:0%
things what I wonder is
 
00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
some of them anyway but um what I wonder
 
00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:52.799 align:start position:0%
is if there isn't a way to
 
00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
um create a
 
00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
to get the funding into the state and
 
00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:00.780 align:start position:0%
then and then create a a pool from which
 
00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
they can draw it could we there's no way
 
00:21:05.289 --> 00:21:05.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
so uh the way that the federal
 
00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
legislation is written uh the for the
 
00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:14.280 align:start position:0%
for the reap program which is the one
 
00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:17.820 align:start position:0%
that would be the most uh the the most
 
00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
neatly matched uh that is uh direct that
 
00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
those grants go directly from the
 
00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
federal government to the farmer or
 
00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:29.340 align:start position:0%
business uh there is no State
 
00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
involvement in that uh so what we're not
 
00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:33.620 align:start position:0%
what we're
 
00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:37.500 align:start position:0%
uh we're not looking to have a state
 
00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
administered program because that's
 
00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:41.700 align:start position:0%
going to cost actually more we're we're
 
00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
looking at figuring out a way to get
 
00:21:48.289 --> 00:21:48.299 align:start position:0%
um a you know a person who can provide
 
00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:55.140 align:start position:0%
assistance uh and I so okay
 
00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
um so it seems like maybe if we just
 
00:21:59.210 --> 00:21:59.220 align:start position:0%
reconfigure the list of people who are
 
00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
on this task force
 
00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
um to include the co-op the cooperative
 
00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
and and perhaps ncrs nrcs or New
 
00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Farm Bureau can we be that
 
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.250 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Farm Bureau can we be that
specific

00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:10.260 align:start position:0%
specific
 
00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:13.740 align:start position:0%
uh I think we're I think that
 
00:22:15.409 --> 00:22:15.419 align:start position:0%
let's go back to your parking lot
 
00:22:15.419 --> 00:22:16.669 align:start position:0%
let's go back to your parking lot
analogy

00:22:16.669 --> 00:22:16.679 align:start position:0%
analogy
 
00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:20.280 align:start position:0%
uh even if you put a couple of people
 
00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:22.559 align:start position:0%
who actually know how to park cars in
 
00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
the parking lot they're still parking
 
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.190 align:start position:0%
the parking lot they're still parking
cars

00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
cars
 
00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
uh they so
 
00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:31.020 align:start position:0%
um the the real question is that I see
 
00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:34.520 align:start position:0%
is uh is this something that
 
00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:37.320 align:start position:0%
where well I think the first thing is
 
00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
the bill as written with a task force
 
00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
just won't work uh and we we I think we
 
00:22:46.669 --> 00:22:46.679 align:start position:0%
probably have a pretty strong agreement
 
00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:50.460 align:start position:0%
on that point uh so but the goal of the
 
00:22:53.149 --> 00:22:53.159 align:start position:0%
bill which is to get energy assistance
 
00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
to Farmers who could really use it uh
 
00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:00.360 align:start position:0%
is a laudable goal and so the question
 
00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
is do we need legislation to be able to
 
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
do that uh or is there or or do we need
 
00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
legislation from this committee to do
 
00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:11.480 align:start position:0%
that uh and
 
00:23:15.049 --> 00:23:15.059 align:start position:0%
uh I without
 
00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:18.360 align:start position:0%
um Cooperative Extension the room giving
 
00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:21.780 align:start position:0%
us advice on what their mechanisms are I
 
00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
don't think we can do that we won't we
 
00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:25.260 align:start position:0%
won't know that
 
00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:29.220 align:start position:0%
um I suspect that probably the best
 
00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:32.580 align:start position:0%
uh way to go about this is
 
00:23:35.529 --> 00:23:35.539 align:start position:0%
uh for me to discuss with Kendall Valley
 
00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:38.340 align:start position:0%
what the process is and if that process
 
00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:41.400 align:start position:0%
is extension specifically asking for
 
00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:45.440 align:start position:0%
more money from uh in the budget process
 
00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
for this targeted position then that is
 
00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:50.940 align:start position:0%
something that extension would have to
 
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
do or that would have to go you know
 
00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:55.500 align:start position:0%
from extension to the university and
 
00:23:57.710 --> 00:23:57.720 align:start position:0%
then to the budget committee but it's
 
00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:00.900 align:start position:0%
not but that's and and we could as a
 
00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:02.940 align:start position:0%
committee potentially write a letter of
 
00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:05.220 align:start position:0%
support uh if everyone on the committee
 
00:24:09.049 --> 00:24:09.059 align:start position:0%
agrees but we would not uh we would not
 
00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
be doing the legislation uh and so I my
 
00:24:16.669 --> 00:24:16.679 align:start position:0%
my feeling at this point is uh be
 
00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:19.320 align:start position:0%
uh our best action on this bill is
 
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
probably to retain it in case there's
 
00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
some it turns out there's something we
 
00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:25.320 align:start position:0%
can do with it but I don't think that we
 
00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:29.100 align:start position:0%
can do what we knew I don't think that
 
00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:31.430 align:start position:0%
can do what we knew I don't think that
uh

00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:34.620 align:start position:0%
we can do something in this bill on the
 
00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:37.740 align:start position:0%
time scale it takes to get it into the
 
00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:40.980 align:start position:0%
budget process uh as you with our acting
 
00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
as a committee
 
00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:45.710 align:start position:0%
as a committee
um

00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
yeah because if we were to if we were to
 
00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:52.260 align:start position:0%
amend this bill to purely be some sort
 
00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:54.360 align:start position:0%
of appropriation
 
00:24:57.710 --> 00:24:57.720 align:start position:0%
for UNH extension
 
00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
that would have to be out by
 
00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
February 16th right in order to get to
 
00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
finance and we don't have enough time to
 
00:25:11.029 --> 00:25:11.039 align:start position:0%
we don't have time to do that yeah
 
00:25:11.039 --> 00:25:12.770 align:start position:0%
we don't have time to do that yeah
yeah

00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:12.780 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:17.100 align:start position:0%
I agree with Peter I mean if if it's my
 
00:25:20.149 --> 00:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
my things would be ital it or retain it
 
00:25:20.159 --> 00:25:20.690 align:start position:0%
my things would be ital it or retain it
um

00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:20.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
representative Howard
 
00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:29.460 align:start position:0%
um I I agree in principle um when you
 
00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:31.980 align:start position:0%
say a position at the co-op is is that
 
00:25:34.789 --> 00:25:34.799 align:start position:0%
when you talk to Kendall Valley are you
 
00:25:36.769 --> 00:25:36.779 align:start position:0%
did you say a position or just a
 
00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:39.900 align:start position:0%
suggestion that they advise us
 
00:25:42.409 --> 00:25:42.419 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:44.580 align:start position:0%
um when I talked with him before he said
 
00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:47.940 align:start position:0%
that in order to be able to do this they
 
00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:50.580 align:start position:0%
would need to have uh another they would
 
00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:52.500 align:start position:0%
need to have another either position or
 
00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:54.360 align:start position:0%
have to I don't remember exactly I don't
 
00:25:56.029 --> 00:25:56.039 align:start position:0%
know that he's done the research on how
 
00:25:56.039 --> 00:25:57.289 align:start position:0%
know that he's done the research on how
much

00:25:57.289 --> 00:25:57.299 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:25:59.390 --> 00:25:59.400 align:start position:0%
um labor he would need in order to do it
 
00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:01.620 align:start position:0%
but he said that he did not have
 
00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
currently have the capacity with his
 
00:26:06.169 --> 00:26:06.179 align:start position:0%
current staff to just start this program
 
00:26:06.179 --> 00:26:07.789 align:start position:0%
current staff to just start this program
without

00:26:07.789 --> 00:26:07.799 align:start position:0%
without
 
00:26:11.029 --> 00:26:11.039 align:start position:0%
um uh with without a little without some
 
00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:13.320 align:start position:0%
more staff assistance and
 
00:26:17.029 --> 00:26:17.039 align:start position:0%
um the impression I got was that it um
 
00:26:18.490 --> 00:26:18.500 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
one person uh I'm not sure where there
 
00:26:23.269 --> 00:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
would be you know one person or a
 
00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
halftime person
 
00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:26.700 align:start position:0%
um but uh
 
00:26:30.769 --> 00:26:30.779 align:start position:0%
but that's uh he said that there would
 
00:26:32.149 --> 00:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
need to be
 
00:26:36.289 --> 00:26:36.299 align:start position:0%
um more more support and to extension
 
00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:40.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
um this is just a question so
 
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
um I know that uh the person that I was
 
00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:46.740 align:start position:0%
talking about with our grants for our
 
00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
county is on the New Hampshire State
 
00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:51.900 align:start position:0%
conservation committee
 
00:26:54.169 --> 00:26:54.179 align:start position:0%
I'm on the governor's task force for the
 
00:26:55.669 --> 00:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
Humane treatment of animals there's a
 
00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
lot of committees out there already
 
00:26:58.789 --> 00:26:58.799 align:start position:0%
established with the state is there
 
00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:01.140 align:start position:0%
anything that focuses on this particular
 
00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:04.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh I the information I got is that there
 
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.490 align:start position:0%
uh I the information I got is that there
are

00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:13.500 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:14.460 align:start position:0%
um a
 
00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:17.400 align:start position:0%
some organizations that are doing things
 
00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:20.820 align:start position:0%
that are kind of related but there's not
 
00:27:24.769 --> 00:27:24.779 align:start position:0%
um there's not anything uh that is
 
00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:29.700 align:start position:0%
focused directly on this uh and uh I
 
00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:31.140 align:start position:0%
have not touched base with clean energy
 
00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:32.820 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to find out how the
 
00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:35.460 align:start position:0%
circuit Rider program works that's uh
 
00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:40.260 align:start position:0%
that is uh another possible Avenue
 
00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:41.110 align:start position:0%
that is uh another possible Avenue
um

00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:47.269 --> 00:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
and uh it might another possible uh
 
00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
Avenue would be if the Farm Bureau gets
 
00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:54.360 align:start position:0%
their energy uh committee together they
 
00:27:57.890 --> 00:27:57.900 align:start position:0%
may be able to uh direct be able to
 
00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
direct Farmers to a range of resources
 
00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
that are available
 
00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:04.020 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
what what I'm concerned about is I don't
 
00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:09.480 align:start position:0%
want our Farmers to miss out on things
 
00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:11.580 align:start position:0%
because they look at the application
 
00:28:13.549 --> 00:28:13.559 align:start position:0%
process first of all they have to figure
 
00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
out where the application process is
 
00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
because it you know there's no
 
00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:19.490 align:start position:0%
because it you know there's no
centralized

00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:19.500 align:start position:0%
centralized
 
00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:22.440 align:start position:0%
piece of source of where that of that
 
00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:25.260 align:start position:0%
information and then once they find
 
00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:26.700 align:start position:0%
something they might be able to apply
 
00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:29.220 align:start position:0%
for they look at it and they say oh I
 
00:28:30.529 --> 00:28:30.539 align:start position:0%
need this Federal Form that Federal
 
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
Federal Form and that Federal Form and I
 
00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
don't know how to fill them out and I
 
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
don't have time to fill them out because
 
00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:40.140 align:start position:0%
my uh I need to fix my tractor I need to
 
00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
you know find a new and a digital source
 
00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:45.240 align:start position:0%
of feed for my animals
 
00:28:46.549 --> 00:28:46.559 align:start position:0%
et cetera et cetera et cetera I mean
 
00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
there are
 
00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:50.700 align:start position:0%
um it's it's the sort of thing where
 
00:28:54.409 --> 00:28:54.419 align:start position:0%
doing government paperwork is may have a
 
00:28:56.810 --> 00:28:56.820 align:start position:0%
long-term benefit but it's not going to
 
00:28:58.730 --> 00:28:58.740 align:start position:0%
deal with what needs to happen
 
00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:01.860 align:start position:0%
immediately on the farm and
 
00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
uh so uh it seems like they're like
 
00:29:09.769 --> 00:29:09.779 align:start position:0%
having some mechanism for
 
00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
assisting Farmers with filling it out uh
 
00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:17.940 align:start position:0%
would be highly beneficial uh and uh I
 
00:29:19.789 --> 00:29:19.799 align:start position:0%
know that
 
00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
so that you uh extension does some level
 
00:29:26.590 --> 00:29:26.600 align:start position:0%
of assistance in terms of other business
 
00:29:29.389 --> 00:29:29.399 align:start position:0%
operations uh
 
00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:32.340 align:start position:0%
to uh in terms of uh
 
00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:35.580 align:start position:0%
figuring out uh long-term planning
 
00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:37.860 align:start position:0%
figuring out uh you know how to use a
 
00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:41.480 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet to uh you know sort out your
 
00:29:45.409 --> 00:29:45.419 align:start position:0%
resources and finances and whatnot uh
 
00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:50.100 align:start position:0%
and it seems like it it might be this
 
00:29:52.789 --> 00:29:52.799 align:start position:0%
this would be kind of in line with that
 
00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
sort of help
 
00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:55.010 align:start position:0%
sort of help
um

00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:55.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
I wonder if
 
00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
um representative vos's energy committee
 
00:30:04.130 --> 00:30:04.140 align:start position:0%
has any Finance any bills going to
 
00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
finance that he could tack on
 
00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:10.200 align:start position:0%
um that's being amended anyway that he
 
00:30:13.269 --> 00:30:13.279 align:start position:0%
could tack on some sort of
 
00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:16.620 align:start position:0%
appropriation for UNH extension for
 
00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:19.500 align:start position:0%
energy relief for Farmers
 
00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:21.250 align:start position:0%
energy relief for Farmers
um okay

00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:21.260 align:start position:0%
um okay
 
00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
I think it's a little premature for us
 
00:30:25.610 --> 00:30:25.620 align:start position:0%
to be talking about putting an
 
00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
appropriation in right now
 
00:30:30.049 --> 00:30:30.059 align:start position:0%
um only because
 
00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:31.860 align:start position:0%
um I think there's a lot of other viable
 
00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:34.260 align:start position:0%
options out there
 
00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:35.640 align:start position:0%
um with like the New Hampshire Farm
 
00:30:38.269 --> 00:30:38.279 align:start position:0%
Bureau the national resources
 
00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
um and you know if we can get these
 
00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:45.620 align:start position:0%
groups talking to each other I mean
 
00:30:49.210 --> 00:30:49.220 align:start position:0%
why not try that Avenue first yeah yeah
 
00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:52.260 align:start position:0%
so would it be worthwhile maybe for our
 
00:30:54.049 --> 00:30:54.059 align:start position:0%
committee to draft some sort of letter
 
00:30:57.169 --> 00:30:57.179 align:start position:0%
to these different organizations asking
 
00:30:59.750 --> 00:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
them to collaborate with one another on
 
00:31:02.149 --> 00:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
this issue
 
00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:04.860 align:start position:0%
um that seems like a good a reasonable
 
00:31:07.789 --> 00:31:07.799 align:start position:0%
possibility I I I'm also going to follow
 
00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:09.720 align:start position:0%
up with Kendall Valley because if it's
 
00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:11.820 align:start position:0%
something where he can put in a request
 
00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:15.240 align:start position:0%
without going through us then that would
 
00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:16.310 align:start position:0%
without going through us then that would
be

00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
um I mean
 
00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:20.220 align:start position:0%
there's then we would that wouldn't
 
00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:21.720 align:start position:0%
require our action on our absolutely
 
00:31:24.409 --> 00:31:24.419 align:start position:0%
yeah and so but I think that if there is
 
00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:28.980 align:start position:0%
going to be an appropriation request uh
 
00:31:31.789 --> 00:31:31.799 align:start position:0%
during this cycle that it's going to
 
00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:35.640 align:start position:0%
have to come from uh from extension
 
00:31:37.789 --> 00:31:37.799 align:start position:0%
without our intervention and I don't
 
00:31:39.889 --> 00:31:39.899 align:start position:0%
think that trying to put it through the
 
00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:41.460 align:start position:0%
energy committee would be any better
 
00:31:43.789 --> 00:31:43.799 align:start position:0%
than trying to put it through us it's
 
00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:46.500 align:start position:0%
got to be they make them making the ass
 
00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:52.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:55.320 align:start position:0%
I don't know how much information this
 
00:31:57.649 --> 00:31:57.659 align:start position:0%
will helpful information this will be
 
00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
but we're having solar put on our house
 
00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:04.860 align:start position:0%
and I spoke to the consultant and
 
00:32:07.549 --> 00:32:07.559 align:start position:0%
um I think when the people came in for
 
00:32:09.169 --> 00:32:09.179 align:start position:0%
the hearing they were talking about
 
00:32:12.250 --> 00:32:12.260 align:start position:0%
Kimball Farm down in Massachusetts
 
00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
he said that that was a special project
 
00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
that was done years ago and it was a
 
00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:21.240 align:start position:0%
different setup and so when they you
 
00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:23.820 align:start position:0%
can't compare Kimball to what's
 
00:32:26.330 --> 00:32:26.340 align:start position:0%
happening in New Hampshire it's it's
 
00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
separate it was done almost 20 years ago
 
00:32:32.389 --> 00:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
and they really put a lot into it
 
00:32:36.169 --> 00:32:36.179 align:start position:0%
because it was an experiment and he said
 
00:32:37.789 --> 00:32:37.799 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:32:40.909 --> 00:32:40.919 align:start position:0%
um that was his understanding because
 
00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:44.820 align:start position:0%
he's been in the industry so anyway
 
00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:47.220 align:start position:0%
um in case there was a comparison like
 
00:32:48.889 --> 00:32:48.899 align:start position:0%
why aren't the New Hampshire Farmers
 
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
getting this it was because he said it
 
00:32:54.529 --> 00:32:54.539 align:start position:0%
was a different program
 
00:32:56.930 --> 00:32:56.940 align:start position:0%
yeah representative yeah so that that
 
00:32:59.570 --> 00:32:59.580 align:start position:0%
makes sense I mean Massachusetts has a
 
00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
different way of
 
00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:04.980 align:start position:0%
um doing their energy support for solar
 
00:33:08.029 --> 00:33:08.039 align:start position:0%
energy and renewable energy uh a fairly
 
00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:10.740 align:start position:0%
a fairly more aggressive than than New
 
00:33:14.389 --> 00:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and uh so
 
00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:16.740 align:start position:0%
um I don't it's
 
00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:17.990 align:start position:0%
um I don't it's
um

00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
so I I don't think that Kimball Farm is
 
00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:22.740 align:start position:0%
actually any sort of model for what we
 
00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:26.460 align:start position:0%
would want to do here uh it's uh we're
 
00:33:29.029 --> 00:33:29.039 align:start position:0%
looking more at you know there are we
 
00:33:30.649 --> 00:33:30.659 align:start position:0%
know there are now federal funds out
 
00:33:32.149 --> 00:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
there we want
 
00:33:34.009 --> 00:33:34.019 align:start position:0%
our Farmers to be able to take advantage
 
00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:36.720 align:start position:0%
of that there are certain
 
00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:41.340 align:start position:0%
um red tape hurdles that it would be
 
00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
rather than having a uh 50 million
 
00:33:48.009 --> 00:33:48.019 align:start position:0%
dollar small business that happens to be
 
00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:50.640 align:start position:0%
uh in a rural part of New England
 
00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
getting the the large chunk of that
 
00:33:55.730 --> 00:33:55.740 align:start position:0%
money we would like to see that money
 
00:33:58.370 --> 00:33:58.380 align:start position:0%
going to a number of small farms in New
 
00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so uh so uh and but our small
 
00:34:06.649 --> 00:34:06.659 align:start position:0%
farms don't have the red tape cutting
 
00:34:09.589 --> 00:34:09.599 align:start position:0%
ability that a bigger business does uh
 
00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:14.220 align:start position:0%
so uh we want so figuring out avenues
 
00:34:17.149 --> 00:34:17.159 align:start position:0%
for for cutting that red tape and I
 
00:34:19.369 --> 00:34:19.379 align:start position:0%
think probably a combination of what rep
 
00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:21.540 align:start position:0%
Compton is saying about getting the Farm
 
00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
Bureau the Farmers Union nrcs
 
00:34:27.829 --> 00:34:27.839 align:start position:0%
Etc involved and
 
00:34:27.839 --> 00:34:28.609 align:start position:0%
Etc involved and
um

00:34:28.609 --> 00:34:28.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
seeing if Co-op extension can help out
 
00:34:36.409 --> 00:34:36.419 align:start position:0%
as well probably is our best bet and I I
 
00:34:41.329 --> 00:34:41.339 align:start position:0%
like uh chairman Aaron's idea of writing
 
00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
a letter to the various organizations
 
00:34:46.970 --> 00:34:46.980 align:start position:0%
saying this is something that's on our
 
00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
radar is there a way that you guys can
 
00:34:51.889 --> 00:34:51.899 align:start position:0%
get together and collaborate on this to
 
00:34:54.409 --> 00:34:54.419 align:start position:0%
make it work better
 
00:34:54.419 --> 00:34:56.930 align:start position:0%
make it work better
yeah

00:34:56.930 --> 00:34:56.940 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:35:00.290 --> 00:35:00.300 align:start position:0%
okay so any other comments about this um
 
00:35:01.849 --> 00:35:01.859 align:start position:0%
because I think that's probably the way
 
00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:04.020 align:start position:0%
to go and
 
00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:04.670 align:start position:0%
to go and
um

00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:04.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:06.420 align:start position:0%
I don't know if
 
00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:09.240 align:start position:0%
you and I can draft up something if you
 
00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
want to do that
 
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
yes that makes sense and um I I guess on
 
00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:18.660 align:start position:0%
I was looking on the Dateline and plans
 
00:35:20.569 --> 00:35:20.579 align:start position:0%
of when we were going to hear bills and
 
00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:23.700 align:start position:0%
when we were going to exec bills and I
 
00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
guess this bill would end up getting
 
00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:30.920 align:start position:0%
exact on um somewhere February 28th ish
 
00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:34.440 align:start position:0%
so um you know we have time because it's
 
00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
not an early bill we have time to think
 
00:35:39.650 --> 00:35:39.660 align:start position:0%
about whether we want itl or retain but
 
00:35:41.210 --> 00:35:41.220 align:start position:0%
in the meantime we can draft up a letter
 
00:35:46.370 --> 00:35:46.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:49.609 --> 00:35:49.619 align:start position:0%
anything further on this I guess we
 
00:35:49.619 --> 00:35:51.109 align:start position:0%
anything further on this I guess we
unless

00:35:51.109 --> 00:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
unless
 
00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:53.220 align:start position:0%
we have anything further then I think we
 
00:35:58.430 --> 00:35:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:03.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:05.400 align:start position:0%
are we all set
 
00:36:07.069 --> 00:36:07.079 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:09.540 align:start position:0%
well I guess uh
 
00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:11.460 align:start position:0%
no go ahead no this is something
 
00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
different to adjourn oh all right so
 
00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll adjourn the the subcommittee
 
00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:19.820 align:start position:0%
work session on HB 369
 
00:36:21.589 --> 00:36:21.599 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:36:24.890 --> 00:36:24.900 align:start position:0%
any substitutes today we do not
 
00:36:26.690 --> 00:36:26.700 align:start position:0%
everyone's going to be here as I know
 
00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:27.650 align:start position:0%
everyone's going to be here as I know
yes

00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:27.660 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:30.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:37.010 --> 00:36:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:38.820 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:36:42.050 --> 00:36:42.060 align:start position:0%
um so I know we the agricultural
 
00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
subcommittee I know that there was some
 
00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:46.210 align:start position:0%
talk between you and I about
 
00:36:46.210 --> 00:36:46.849 align:start position:0%
talk between you and I about
[Music]

00:36:46.849 --> 00:36:46.859 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:36:46.859 --> 00:36:48.050 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:48.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:55.609 --> 00:36:55.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
uh next week is 2 7 is it not yeah yeah
 
00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:08.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:10.310 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:37:13.010 --> 00:37:13.020 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:37:17.810 --> 00:37:17.820 align:start position:0%
let's see uh hb221 is the bill relative
 
00:37:20.089 --> 00:37:20.099 align:start position:0%
to the acquisition of agricultural land
 
00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
development rights
 
00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:25.670 align:start position:0%
development rights
and

00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to double check make sure
 
00:37:31.490 --> 00:37:31.500 align:start position:0%
that's not an early bill it's not so
 
00:37:34.250 --> 00:37:34.260 align:start position:0%
that's not an early bill either
 
00:37:36.349 --> 00:37:36.359 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:39.540 align:start position:0%
I think it we could get together at 9 00
 
00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:40.609 align:start position:0%
I think it we could get together at 9 00
A.M

00:37:40.609 --> 00:37:40.619 align:start position:0%
A.M
 
00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:42.420 align:start position:0%
next week
 
00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
and talk about hb221 it's a we have it
 
00:37:50.050 --> 00:37:50.060 align:start position:0%
on the docket today for the exec session
 
00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:52.260 align:start position:0%
but I guess you were going to make
 
00:37:54.170 --> 00:37:54.180 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby was going to make a
 
00:37:59.270 --> 00:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
motion to defer it to a subcommittee and
 
00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
not exec it out today yeah
 
00:38:18.109 --> 00:38:18.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:21.310 --> 00:38:21.320 align:start position:0%
I know that I'm pretty sure
 
00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:23.940 align:start position:0%
I've seen that done before so I know
 
00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
that there's got to be well there's been
 
00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:28.020 align:start position:0%
new information so um I think it makes
 
00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
sense if there's new information and
 
00:38:31.730 --> 00:38:31.740 align:start position:0%
it's not an early bill it's not critical
 
00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:32.870 align:start position:0%
it's not an early bill it's not critical
to

00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:35.640 align:start position:0%
so would we retain it I think today I
 
00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
think no I think it's we refer to
 
00:38:40.609 --> 00:38:40.619 align:start position:0%
commitments let me go ask yeah
 
00:38:40.619 --> 00:38:45.650 align:start position:0%
commitments let me go ask yeah
okay

00:38:45.650 --> 00:38:45.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:48.829 --> 00:38:48.839 align:start position:0%
um all right so
 
00:38:54.770 --> 00:38:54.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:57.230 --> 00:38:57.240 align:start position:0%
so and I can
 
00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:01.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:44.149 --> 01:35:44.159 align:start position:0%

uh
 
01:37:37.189 --> 01:37:37.199 align:start position:0%
so would you like to explain your motion
 
01:37:40.310 --> 01:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
I mean right so um
 
01:37:44.689 --> 01:37:44.699 align:start position:0%
so the bill as it was presented to us uh
 
01:37:46.850 --> 01:37:46.860 align:start position:0%
was uh
 
01:37:49.850 --> 01:37:49.860 align:start position:0%
there was a number of a lot of testimony
 
01:37:51.530 --> 01:37:51.540 align:start position:0%
indicating that it was not really
 
01:37:55.970 --> 01:37:55.980 align:start position:0%
workable but uh one of the key points
 
01:37:57.470 --> 01:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
that came out of that was that there are
 
01:37:57.480 --> 01:37:58.669 align:start position:0%
that came out of that was that there are
many

01:37:58.669 --> 01:37:58.679 align:start position:0%
many
 
01:37:58.679 --> 01:37:59.510 align:start position:0%
many
um

01:37:59.510 --> 01:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:04.070 --> 01:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
many many issues with uh the uh chapter
 
01:38:07.669 --> 01:38:07.679 align:start position:0%
RSA 4034 that may be out of date now
 
01:38:11.149 --> 01:38:11.159 align:start position:0%
that we a lot of that is that material
 
01:38:16.129 --> 01:38:16.139 align:start position:0%
is governed by the um this month uh food
 
01:38:21.189 --> 01:38:21.199 align:start position:0%
safety monitors modernization act uh and
 
01:38:26.030 --> 01:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
uh so uh the idea came up that we could
 
01:38:29.930 --> 01:38:29.940 align:start position:0%
uh reduce a number of
 
01:38:32.510 --> 01:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
um regulations that are outdated uh and
 
01:38:36.950 --> 01:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh in chapter 434 by doing by doing a
 
01:38:39.110 --> 01:38:39.120 align:start position:0%
study committee on that and identifying

up that for a lot of the
 
01:38:47.270 --> 01:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
um that fisma is currently
 
01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:48.129 align:start position:0%
um that fisma is currently
um

01:38:48.129 --> 01:38:48.139 align:start position:0%

I added to the study committee in my
 
01:39:15.229 --> 01:39:15.239 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh RSA 426 so what the study
 
01:39:17.390 --> 01:39:17.400 align:start position:0%
committee would do
 
01:39:20.450 --> 01:39:20.460 align:start position:0%
um and I should probably just
 
01:39:23.930 --> 01:39:23.940 align:start position:0%
um move on to moving the amendment
 
01:39:26.810 --> 01:39:26.820 align:start position:0%
and uh oh and pass out the amendment yes
 
01:39:30.590 --> 01:39:30.600 align:start position:0%

representative Creighton
 
01:45:28.310 --> 01:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
uh yes ma'am the bottom line is on 128
 
01:45:30.830 --> 01:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
that we were presenting a lot of
 
01:45:32.570 --> 01:45:32.580 align:start position:0%
different facts but
 
01:45:35.270 --> 01:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
um there was no compelling testimony as
 
01:45:38.270 --> 01:45:38.280 align:start position:0%
to the requirement for this bill and so
 
01:45:40.669 --> 01:45:40.679 align:start position:0%
I think that uh we've got a bill that's
 
01:45:43.370 --> 01:45:43.380 align:start position:0%
looking for a solution
 
01:45:44.750 --> 01:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
thank you is there any further
 
01:45:46.790 --> 01:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
discussion on this bill representative
 
01:45:50.090 --> 01:45:50.100 align:start position:0%
Bixby yes so um
 
01:45:53.570 --> 01:45:53.580 align:start position:0%
back in 20
 
01:45:58.430 --> 01:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
I believe it's 2014 or 15. 2014
 
01:46:03.410 --> 01:46:03.420 align:start position:0%
um the there was a um the exemption was
 
01:46:06.169 --> 01:46:06.179 align:start position:0%
brought to us as a bill and at that
 
01:46:06.179 --> 01:46:07.189 align:start position:0%
brought to us as a bill and at that
point

01:46:07.189 --> 01:46:07.199 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:46:09.890 --> 01:46:09.900 align:start position:0%
um before then you needed to seed
 
01:46:11.750 --> 01:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
license no matter how few C2 were
 
01:46:14.870 --> 01:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
selling and uh the committee felt that
 
01:46:16.550 --> 01:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
it was
 
01:46:19.370 --> 01:46:19.380 align:start position:0%
um that if someone wanted to be able to
 
01:46:23.090 --> 01:46:23.100 align:start position:0%
sell a few seeds uh for their own
 
01:46:26.810 --> 01:46:26.820 align:start position:0%
um stock their own uh saved seeds at a
 
01:46:28.370 --> 01:46:28.380 align:start position:0%
farmer's market or something they
 
01:46:30.290 --> 01:46:30.300 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have to go be able to have to
 
01:46:31.910 --> 01:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
go through the entire seed licensing
 
01:46:35.090 --> 01:46:35.100 align:start position:0%
process but that this should be
 
01:46:37.669 --> 01:46:37.679 align:start position:0%
basically available for on a just a very
 
01:46:42.709 --> 01:46:42.719 align:start position:0%
small uh small basis because uh in order
 
01:46:47.209 --> 01:46:47.219 align:start position:0%
to uh in order to have a clear uh and
 
01:46:50.570 --> 01:46:50.580 align:start position:0%
safe supply of seeds for larger growers
 
01:46:52.129 --> 01:46:52.139 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
01:46:57.109 --> 01:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
um so essentially Farmers uh the uh the
 
01:47:00.169 --> 01:47:00.179 align:start position:0%
the seed inspection process really
 
01:47:03.290 --> 01:47:03.300 align:start position:0%
needed to stay in place and we debated
 
01:47:06.050 --> 01:47:06.060 align:start position:0%
for a long time what was the maximum
 
01:47:07.970 --> 01:47:07.980 align:start position:0%
number of seeds that you would be able
 
01:47:09.790 --> 01:47:09.800 align:start position:0%
that you should
 
01:47:13.850 --> 01:47:13.860 align:start position:0%
be able to sell and initially we're
 
01:47:16.250 --> 01:47:16.260 align:start position:0%
thinking it should be on the order of
 
01:47:19.129 --> 01:47:19.139 align:start position:0%
maybe a pound or two because you know a
 
01:47:21.290 --> 01:47:21.300 align:start position:0%
pound of tomato seeds this is an awful
 
01:47:22.970 --> 01:47:22.980 align:start position:0%
lot of tomato plants and then someone
 
01:47:24.649 --> 01:47:24.659 align:start position:0%
brought up well what about corn and
 
01:47:26.390 --> 01:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
beans because
 
01:47:28.250 --> 01:47:28.260 align:start position:0%
um those are those seeds are heavier and
 
01:47:29.629 --> 01:47:29.639 align:start position:0%
we thought okay we're just going to put
 
01:47:32.510 --> 01:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
it at the highest conceivable limit that
 
01:47:35.450 --> 01:47:35.460 align:start position:0%
anyone would possibly use if they were
 
01:47:39.050 --> 01:47:39.060 align:start position:0%
are going to be doing this uh just like
 
01:47:40.609 --> 01:47:40.619 align:start position:0%
farmers markets and that sort of thing
 
01:47:43.490 --> 01:47:43.500 align:start position:0%
and farm stands and we said okay 25
 
01:47:45.590 --> 01:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
pounds is more than anyone is going to
 
01:47:46.729 --> 01:47:46.739 align:start position:0%
be selling
 
01:47:50.450 --> 01:47:50.460 align:start position:0%
under that basis and I would still and
 
01:47:52.430 --> 01:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
we did not hear anyone come to our
 
01:47:54.169 --> 01:47:54.179 align:start position:0%
commit to the Committee hearing saying
 
01:47:57.649 --> 01:47:57.659 align:start position:0%
that the 25 pound limit was in any way a
 
01:48:02.510 --> 01:48:02.520 align:start position:0%
problem so uh I would uh concur with
 
01:48:03.890 --> 01:48:03.900 align:start position:0%
representative Creighton's assessment
 
01:48:08.209 --> 01:48:08.219 align:start position:0%
that this is a um a solution seeking a
 
01:48:08.219 --> 01:48:09.290 align:start position:0%
that this is a um a solution seeking a
problem

01:48:09.290 --> 01:48:09.300 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:48:11.209 --> 01:48:11.219 align:start position:0%

representative germano would you like to

speak to your emotion please thank you
 
01:52:23.209 --> 01:52:23.219 align:start position:0%
madam chair uh this bill provides some
 
01:52:25.370 --> 01:52:25.380 align:start position:0%
statutory definition for soil additives
 
01:52:27.830 --> 01:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
which is consistent with the chapter in
 
01:52:29.930 --> 01:52:29.940 align:start position:0%
which it is contained uh and if I may
 
01:52:31.970 --> 01:52:31.980 align:start position:0%
I'd like to refer to representative
 
01:52:34.250 --> 01:52:34.260 align:start position:0%
Bixby to explain some of the changes
 
01:52:36.830 --> 01:52:36.840 align:start position:0%
around uh the definition for inspection
 
01:52:40.010 --> 01:52:40.020 align:start position:0%
fees and appropriate penalties
 
01:52:42.169 --> 01:52:42.179 align:start position:0%
yes representative Bixby
 
01:52:45.890 --> 01:52:45.900 align:start position:0%
so um the uh
 
01:52:48.470 --> 01:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
some this is essentially this is this
 
01:52:51.470 --> 01:52:51.480 align:start position:0%
makes a number of of small changes to
 
01:52:54.590 --> 01:52:54.600 align:start position:0%
um to clear up uh things in this chapter
 
01:52:57.229 --> 01:52:57.239 align:start position:0%
that were outdated uh one of them was
 
01:52:59.629 --> 01:52:59.639 align:start position:0%
the amount of the
 
01:53:03.770 --> 01:53:03.780 align:start position:0%
um the penalty if uh a seller of
 
01:53:08.270 --> 01:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
fertilizer did not uh file a report and
 
01:53:10.790 --> 01:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
that penalty was previously uh
 
01:53:12.590 --> 01:53:12.600 align:start position:0%
insufficient to actually provide any
 
01:53:16.070 --> 01:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
incentive and this bill allows the
 
01:53:19.550 --> 01:53:19.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner to uh set that fee in that
 
01:53:21.770 --> 01:53:21.780 align:start position:0%
penalty and rules
 
01:53:21.780 --> 01:53:22.490 align:start position:0%
penalty and rules
um

01:53:22.490 --> 01:53:22.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:28.970 --> 01:53:28.980 align:start position:0%
and it also uh changes previously uh if
 
01:53:31.129 --> 01:53:31.139 align:start position:0%
a if someone were shorted on their
 
01:53:33.370 --> 01:53:33.380 align:start position:0%
fertilizer if the quality of the
 
01:53:36.109 --> 01:53:36.119 align:start position:0%
fertilizer was deficient uh you had to
 
01:53:37.550 --> 01:53:37.560 align:start position:0%
be buying at least a ton of the
 
01:53:40.250 --> 01:53:40.260 align:start position:0%
fertilizer to get a refund on that uh
 
01:53:42.169 --> 01:53:42.179 align:start position:0%
through through the penalty payment and
 
01:53:44.229 --> 01:53:44.239 align:start position:0%
now this mean this says that anybody
 
01:53:48.050 --> 01:53:48.060 align:start position:0%
that is sold uh deficient fertilizer can
 
01:53:49.490 --> 01:53:49.500 align:start position:0%
get the refund
 
01:53:49.500 --> 01:53:51.229 align:start position:0%
get the refund
and

01:53:51.229 --> 01:53:51.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:53:54.410 --> 01:53:54.420 align:start position:0%
it also changes the way that uh the
 
01:53:56.810 --> 01:53:56.820 align:start position:0%
value of fertilizer is calculated by
 
01:53:59.149 --> 01:53:59.159 align:start position:0%

to your motion

uh Madam chair thank you very much
 
02:01:03.589 --> 02:01:03.599 align:start position:0%
um the reason this was brought forth
 
02:01:07.330 --> 02:01:07.340 align:start position:0%
that I think was very uh simple is that
 
02:01:10.550 --> 02:01:10.560 align:start position:0%
noise ordinances are going in at the
 
02:01:12.290 --> 02:01:12.300 align:start position:0%
local levels
 
02:01:12.300 --> 02:01:13.149 align:start position:0%
local levels
um

02:01:13.149 --> 02:01:13.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:16.189 --> 02:01:16.199 align:start position:0%
and people are not understanding what
 
02:01:17.990 --> 02:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
agricultural purposes are and don't
 
02:01:19.910 --> 02:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
understand the complexities and the
 
02:01:22.070 --> 02:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
times when people in agriculture
 
02:01:25.250 --> 02:01:25.260 align:start position:0%
actually have to be out doing their jobs
 
02:01:25.260 --> 02:01:26.149 align:start position:0%
actually have to be out doing their jobs
um

02:01:26.149 --> 02:01:26.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:29.750 --> 02:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
if you have a tree fall on your fence at
 
02:01:31.310 --> 02:01:31.320 align:start position:0%
3am in the morning you need to go out
 
02:01:33.770 --> 02:01:33.780 align:start position:0%
there and start that chainsaw and that
 
02:01:35.750 --> 02:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
would be in violation of a noise
 
02:01:37.970 --> 02:01:37.980 align:start position:0%
ordinance if you have to start up a
 
02:01:39.589 --> 02:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
tractor at one o'clock in the morning to
 
02:01:41.570 --> 02:01:41.580 align:start position:0%
pull out a calf that would be in
 
02:01:43.729 --> 02:01:43.739 align:start position:0%
violation of a noise ordinance
 
02:01:46.729 --> 02:01:46.739 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is exempt those
 
02:01:49.189 --> 02:01:49.199 align:start position:0%
practices so that there will be no
 
02:01:51.770 --> 02:01:51.780 align:start position:0%
question that they are actually legal
 
02:01:53.629 --> 02:01:53.639 align:start position:0%
activities and the farmers will not be
 
02:01:55.370 --> 02:01:55.380 align:start position:0%
stressed out
 
02:01:58.250 --> 02:01:58.260 align:start position:0%
um regarding these practices
 
02:02:00.169 --> 02:02:00.179 align:start position:0%
any further discussion point of order
 
02:02:03.109 --> 02:02:03.119 align:start position:0%
Madam chair yes uh it was my
 
02:02:04.490 --> 02:02:04.500 align:start position:0%
understanding that there was going to be
 
02:02:08.030 --> 02:02:08.040 align:start position:0%
a second amendment to this bill is that
 
02:02:08.040 --> 02:02:10.430 align:start position:0%
a second amendment to this bill is that
incorrect

02:02:10.430 --> 02:02:10.440 align:start position:0%
incorrect
 
02:02:12.770 --> 02:02:12.780 align:start position:0%
I there has no not been another
 
02:02:14.629 --> 02:02:14.639 align:start position:0%
amendment presented
 
02:02:14.639 --> 02:02:16.129 align:start position:0%
amendment presented
okay

02:02:16.129 --> 02:02:16.139 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:02:19.790 --> 02:02:19.800 align:start position:0%
uh representative Bixby so one uh one
 
02:02:22.250 --> 02:02:22.260 align:start position:0%
aspect of this that came up during our
 
02:02:24.950 --> 02:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh discussion after that came up in the
 
02:02:26.570 --> 02:02:26.580 align:start position:0%
hearing and then in our discussion after
 
02:02:30.970 --> 02:02:30.980 align:start position:0%
the hearing was uh What uh what about
 
02:02:36.649 --> 02:02:36.659 align:start position:0%
agritourism and uh would it be a would
 
02:02:39.290 --> 02:02:39.300 align:start position:0%
the fact that this basically this bill
 
02:02:43.370 --> 02:02:43.380 align:start position:0%
this um bill as written and as um with
 
02:02:46.609 --> 02:02:46.619 align:start position:0%
this minor uh clerical correction uh
 
02:02:50.149 --> 02:02:50.159 align:start position:0%
that it would allow
 
02:02:53.089 --> 02:02:53.099 align:start position:0%
um Farms to be exempt both uh including
 
02:02:56.750 --> 02:02:56.760 align:start position:0%
their agritourism operations and if a
 
02:03:00.709 --> 02:03:00.719 align:start position:0%
farm uh we're carrying were now I had uh
 
02:03:03.770 --> 02:03:03.780 align:start position:0%
doing weddings or uh some some events
 
02:03:06.530 --> 02:03:06.540 align:start position:0%
like that as part of their
 
02:03:06.540 --> 02:03:07.149 align:start position:0%
like that as part of their
um

02:03:07.149 --> 02:03:07.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:13.129 --> 02:03:13.139 align:start position:0%
operation and uh though and uh that
 
02:03:15.589 --> 02:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
ended up creating like you know bands or
 
02:03:19.669 --> 02:03:19.679 align:start position:0%
whatever at the event venue that could
 
02:03:22.129 --> 02:03:22.139 align:start position:0%
uh that would not the municipalities
 
02:03:24.050 --> 02:03:24.060 align:start position:0%
would not be able to say well there's a
 
02:03:26.510 --> 02:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
certain hour Beyond which you can't have
 
02:03:28.790 --> 02:03:28.800 align:start position:0%
that sort of event or that kind of that
 
02:03:31.450 --> 02:03:31.460 align:start position:0%
kind that uh
 
02:03:34.970 --> 02:03:34.980 align:start position:0%
that that aspect of agritourism making
 
02:03:40.430 --> 02:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
that kind of noise uh and that uh was
 
02:03:43.910 --> 02:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
seen by by a number of people as a
 
02:03:46.490 --> 02:03:46.500 align:start position:0%
problem with this bill I believe that
 
02:03:48.830 --> 02:03:48.840 align:start position:0%
there is an amendment available to
 
02:03:53.689 --> 02:03:53.699 align:start position:0%
address that problem uh and uh so I
 
02:03:56.570 --> 02:03:56.580 align:start position:0%
would be in favor of this bill if it uh
 
02:03:59.510 --> 02:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
if it didn't uh if there could be that
 
02:03:59.520 --> 02:04:01.790 align:start position:0%
if it didn't uh if there could be that
exempt

02:04:01.790 --> 02:04:01.800 align:start position:0%
exempt
 
02:04:04.250 --> 02:04:04.260 align:start position:0%
removal of the exemption for specific
 
02:04:07.550 --> 02:04:07.560 align:start position:0%
specifically for agritourism I will have
 
02:04:09.470 --> 02:04:09.480 align:start position:0%
difficulty with the bill if that
 
02:04:12.290 --> 02:04:12.300 align:start position:0%
exemption if that if agrotourism is
 
02:04:13.609 --> 02:04:13.619 align:start position:0%
still included
 
02:04:16.970 --> 02:04:16.980 align:start position:0%
I'm sure representative thank you madam
 
02:04:18.830 --> 02:04:18.840 align:start position:0%
chair and yes there was another
 
02:04:21.109 --> 02:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
amendment uh prepared
 
02:04:23.689 --> 02:04:23.699 align:start position:0%
um however when reading further
 
02:04:25.970 --> 02:04:25.980 align:start position:0%
information that I was given
 
02:04:29.570 --> 02:04:29.580 align:start position:0%
and understanding what agritourism is if
 
02:04:32.689 --> 02:04:32.699 align:start position:0%
you remove agritourism from this bill
 
02:04:35.870 --> 02:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
you are saying to Farmers who have corn
 
02:04:39.470 --> 02:04:39.480 align:start position:0%
mazes or do hayrides or have any special
 
02:04:41.450 --> 02:04:41.460 align:start position:0%
events on their farms in the evening
 
02:04:43.669 --> 02:04:43.679 align:start position:0%
that they are not Exempted from a noise
 
02:04:46.129 --> 02:04:46.139 align:start position:0%
ordinance I mean I know that we're
 
02:04:49.370 --> 02:04:49.380 align:start position:0%
focusing on weddings only in bands but
 
02:04:51.169 --> 02:04:51.179 align:start position:0%
the majority of agritourism in the state
 
02:04:54.890 --> 02:04:54.900 align:start position:0%
is not weddings and bands it is haunted
 
02:04:58.729 --> 02:04:58.739 align:start position:0%
hayrides it could be corn mazes it could
 
02:05:02.990 --> 02:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
be a fundraiser for local uh food bank
 
02:05:05.390 --> 02:05:05.400 align:start position:0%
we don't know there are a lot of
 
02:05:08.149 --> 02:05:08.159 align:start position:0%
activities that go on it could be a
 
02:05:10.490 --> 02:05:10.500 align:start position:0%
Moonlight walk on your farm and that
 
02:05:12.410 --> 02:05:12.420 align:start position:0%
people might be having a good time in
 
02:05:15.649 --> 02:05:15.659 align:start position:0%
around a campfire and that they would no
 
02:05:17.450 --> 02:05:17.460 align:start position:0%
longer be able to do that if a noise
 
02:05:19.669 --> 02:05:19.679 align:start position:0%
ordinance might be enforced
 
02:05:19.679 --> 02:05:20.870 align:start position:0%
ordinance might be enforced
so

02:05:20.870 --> 02:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:05:24.410 --> 02:05:24.420 align:start position:0%
to exempt agritourism in its total I
 
02:05:25.850 --> 02:05:25.860 align:start position:0%
think would be a disservice and be
 
02:05:27.589 --> 02:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
harmful to Farms
 
02:05:30.770 --> 02:05:30.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:32.629 --> 02:05:32.639 align:start position:0%
representative datsey
 
02:05:35.870 --> 02:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
okay uh am I correct that local
 
02:05:40.669 --> 02:05:40.679 align:start position:0%
ordinances would cover local farms and
 
02:05:44.149 --> 02:05:44.159 align:start position:0%
that local communities still are uh
 
02:05:46.490 --> 02:05:46.500 align:start position:0%
assuming that this law does not pass at
 
02:05:49.310 --> 02:05:49.320 align:start position:0%
the present time local communities are
 
02:05:53.330 --> 02:05:53.340 align:start position:0%
able to regulate noise ordinances in
 
02:05:55.129 --> 02:05:55.139 align:start position:0%
farming communities so that they can
 
02:05:58.250 --> 02:05:58.260 align:start position:0%
meet the needs of their communities is
 
02:05:59.930 --> 02:05:59.940 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
02:06:02.930 --> 02:06:02.940 align:start position:0%
representative kantois that is correct
 
02:06:05.990 --> 02:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
however with the increase of people I
 
02:06:08.209 --> 02:06:08.219 align:start position:0%
know in my town where we are seeing an
 
02:06:10.790 --> 02:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
influx of people coming in to retire
 
02:06:13.070 --> 02:06:13.080 align:start position:0%
uh they don't want to be disturbed
 
02:06:15.350 --> 02:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
before a certain hour or disturbed after
 
02:06:18.530 --> 02:06:18.540 align:start position:0%
a certain hour during the day
 
02:06:21.050 --> 02:06:21.060 align:start position:0%
um they actually tried to put in a very
 
02:06:23.930 --> 02:06:23.940 align:start position:0%
Draconian noise ordinance
 
02:06:26.209 --> 02:06:26.219 align:start position:0%
which would have been detrimental to
 
02:06:29.330 --> 02:06:29.340 align:start position:0%
every farmer in my town that I live in
 
02:06:32.089 --> 02:06:32.099 align:start position:0%
we have over 10 Farms just in the small
 
02:06:35.810 --> 02:06:35.820 align:start position:0%
town that I live in and to
 
02:06:39.410 --> 02:06:39.420 align:start position:0%
cause them more stress in any added
 
02:06:42.050 --> 02:06:42.060 align:start position:0%
degree of worrying about what they do
 
02:06:43.550 --> 02:06:43.560 align:start position:0%
and not do
 
02:06:47.270 --> 02:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
is is harmful and all we're asking for
 
02:06:52.570 --> 02:06:52.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:55.970 --> 02:06:55.980 align:start position:0%
uh representative verbal thank you madam
 
02:06:57.350 --> 02:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
chair so
 
02:07:00.109 --> 02:07:00.119 align:start position:0%
I have to confess I I believe that the
 
02:07:02.270 --> 02:07:02.280 align:start position:0%
agritourism should also be exempt the
 
02:07:04.250 --> 02:07:04.260 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire farmers are not getting
 
02:07:06.350 --> 02:07:06.360 align:start position:0%
rich they're not getting rich fast and
 
02:07:08.689 --> 02:07:08.699 align:start position:0%
they need every source of income that
 
02:07:11.089 --> 02:07:11.099 align:start position:0%
they can that they can come up with
 
02:07:13.750 --> 02:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
we always talk about how much we value
 
02:07:17.810 --> 02:07:17.820 align:start position:0%
agriculture in the state we always hear
 
02:07:20.089 --> 02:07:20.099 align:start position:0%
testimony about how much people like the
 
02:07:23.750 --> 02:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
the open space and and the open land and
 
02:07:26.689 --> 02:07:26.699 align:start position:0%
those benefits I agree they're they're
 
02:07:26.699 --> 02:07:27.830 align:start position:0%
those benefits I agree they're they're
real

02:07:27.830 --> 02:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
real
 
02:07:30.530 --> 02:07:30.540 align:start position:0%
and if we're going to protect them we
 
02:07:33.109 --> 02:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
have to make sure that that people have
 
02:07:36.169 --> 02:07:36.179 align:start position:0%
multiple means of earning a living
 
02:07:38.990 --> 02:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
some years of farming are very good some
 
02:07:41.510 --> 02:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
years of farming are very very lean and
 
02:07:44.990 --> 02:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
to offset marginal years or years of
 
02:07:47.570 --> 02:07:47.580 align:start position:0%
losses allowing people to do other
 
02:07:50.209 --> 02:07:50.219 align:start position:0%
things with with property with their
 
02:07:52.729 --> 02:07:52.739 align:start position:0%
private property is in the best interest
 
02:07:55.010 --> 02:07:55.020 align:start position:0%
of the of the State of New Hampshire in
 
02:07:58.189 --> 02:07:58.199 align:start position:0%
my belief and so uh while I well I
 
02:07:59.870 --> 02:07:59.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate some of the concerns that
 
02:08:02.330 --> 02:08:02.340 align:start position:0%
have been brought forth
 
02:08:04.729 --> 02:08:04.739 align:start position:0%
I'll support I'll support the bill is
 
02:08:07.370 --> 02:08:07.380 align:start position:0%
currently amended I would have trouble
 
02:08:10.430 --> 02:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
supporting the bill if it was to carve
 
02:08:13.550 --> 02:08:13.560 align:start position:0%
out agritourism as being subject to
 
02:08:15.589 --> 02:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
local noise ordinance thank you madam
 
02:08:17.169 --> 02:08:17.179 align:start position:0%
chair thank you representative
 
02:08:19.970 --> 02:08:19.980 align:start position:0%
representative Dotsy
 
02:08:21.290 --> 02:08:21.300 align:start position:0%
uh yes
 
02:08:21.300 --> 02:08:21.950 align:start position:0%
uh yes
um

02:08:21.950 --> 02:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:24.109 --> 02:08:24.119 align:start position:0%
I respect the comments made by
 
02:08:26.410 --> 02:08:26.420 align:start position:0%
representative verbal and representative
 
02:08:30.229 --> 02:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
and I and I understand that but I
 
02:08:32.570 --> 02:08:32.580 align:start position:0%
believe in in past sessions we've had
 
02:08:34.669 --> 02:08:34.679 align:start position:0%
difficulty with the definition of
 
02:08:38.570 --> 02:08:38.580 align:start position:0%
Agriculture and one of my concerns would
 
02:08:42.290 --> 02:08:42.300 align:start position:0%
be that you get a let's say a neighbor
 
02:08:45.530 --> 02:08:45.540 align:start position:0%
who has a couple of acres of land and a
 
02:08:48.290 --> 02:08:48.300 align:start position:0%
tractor and decides that he's having a
 
02:08:50.410 --> 02:08:50.420 align:start position:0%
feud with another neighbor
 
02:08:53.629 --> 02:08:53.639 align:start position:0%
and fires up his tractor at three in the
 
02:08:55.669 --> 02:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
morning and
 
02:08:58.910 --> 02:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
um Can disrupt the whole area just based
 
02:09:01.430 --> 02:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
not based on agriculture but based on
 
02:09:04.010 --> 02:09:04.020 align:start position:0%
possibly a neighborhood Feud and my
 
02:09:06.530 --> 02:09:06.540 align:start position:0%
concern is I apologize for not being
 
02:09:09.229 --> 02:09:09.239 align:start position:0%
able to be at the public hearing but are
 
02:09:10.510 --> 02:09:10.520 align:start position:0%
there any
 
02:09:14.089 --> 02:09:14.099 align:start position:0%
things in place so that something like
 
02:09:16.550 --> 02:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
this can be addressed and a farmer
 
02:09:19.430 --> 02:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
cannot use this ordinance to aggravate
 
02:09:22.070 --> 02:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
other neighbors
 
02:09:24.770 --> 02:09:24.780 align:start position:0%
representative come to our
 
02:09:24.780 --> 02:09:26.510 align:start position:0%
representative come to our
um

02:09:26.510 --> 02:09:26.520 align:start position:0%

02:09:26.520 --> 02:09:29.089 align:start position:0%
um

RSA

02:09:30.609 --> 02:09:30.619 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
02:09:35.689 --> 02:09:35.699 align:start position:0%
2134-a defines what agriculture is it's
 
02:09:38.270 --> 02:09:38.280 align:start position:0%
very specific but it is Broad in
 
02:09:40.669 --> 02:09:40.679 align:start position:0%
Spectrum at times
 
02:09:43.310 --> 02:09:43.320 align:start position:0%
so I'll just leave it at that but if you
 
02:09:49.209 --> 02:09:49.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:51.890 --> 02:09:51.900 align:start position:0%
representative Howard
 
02:09:54.310 --> 02:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
I I wonder if um
 
02:09:58.790 --> 02:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
if we were to uh exclude the agritourism
 
02:10:03.350 --> 02:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
from the um from the this bill from from
 
02:10:06.470 --> 02:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
the exemptions don't we return the power
 
02:10:10.070 --> 02:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
to to Grant people like
 
02:10:11.450 --> 02:10:11.460 align:start position:0%
um permission
 
02:10:14.510 --> 02:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
to the municipalities couldn't they if
 
02:10:16.970 --> 02:10:16.980 align:start position:0%
you were planning to have an event or or
 
02:10:19.250 --> 02:10:19.260 align:start position:0%
if you do hayrides over the course of
 
02:10:20.689 --> 02:10:20.699 align:start position:0%
the fall or something like that couldn't
 
02:10:22.550 --> 02:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
you apply to your municipality and that
 
02:10:23.570 --> 02:10:23.580 align:start position:0%
and that way
 
02:10:26.990 --> 02:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
it's the path is sort of smooth for you
 
02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.149 align:start position:0%
it's the path is sort of smooth for you
representative

02:10:29.149 --> 02:10:29.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:10:31.129 --> 02:10:31.139 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
02:10:33.350 --> 02:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
um Madam chair
 
02:10:34.850 --> 02:10:34.860 align:start position:0%
um we had a problem with the noise
 
02:10:37.070 --> 02:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
ordinance because of a rooster How
 
02:10:38.930 --> 02:10:38.940 align:start position:0%
likely do you think that town is going
 
02:10:40.850 --> 02:10:40.860 align:start position:0%
to allow someone to have anything after
 
02:10:44.149 --> 02:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:45.830 --> 02:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
Madam chair
 
02:10:47.629 --> 02:10:47.639 align:start position:0%
representative vervo thank you madam
 
02:10:50.689 --> 02:10:50.699 align:start position:0%
chair if I may and and I I appreciate
 
02:10:53.270 --> 02:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
the point I I certainly do
 
02:10:56.030 --> 02:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
when I read this amendment
 
02:10:59.030 --> 02:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
this amendment in my view allows a
 
02:11:02.169 --> 02:11:02.179 align:start position:0%
community to essentially shut down
 
02:11:06.350 --> 02:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
agritourism based on noise ordinance so
 
02:11:09.350 --> 02:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
it it actually has the potential
 
02:11:11.990 --> 02:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
to zone out a business
 
02:11:14.450 --> 02:11:14.460 align:start position:0%
that's antithetical to the New Hampshire
 
02:11:14.460 --> 02:11:15.709 align:start position:0%
that's antithetical to the New Hampshire
way

02:11:15.709 --> 02:11:15.719 align:start position:0%
way
 
02:11:18.410 --> 02:11:18.420 align:start position:0%
I I don't disagree that the hypothetical
 
02:11:20.330 --> 02:11:20.340 align:start position:0%
could come true
 
02:11:22.430 --> 02:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
but I don't see that as a widespread
 
02:11:22.440 --> 02:11:23.629 align:start position:0%
but I don't see that as a widespread
problem

02:11:23.629 --> 02:11:23.639 align:start position:0%
problem
 
02:11:26.330 --> 02:11:26.340 align:start position:0%
further if there is sort of this grudge
 
02:11:28.209 --> 02:11:28.219 align:start position:0%
match between Neighbors which
 
02:11:30.950 --> 02:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
unfortunately does occur
 
02:11:34.609 --> 02:11:34.619 align:start position:0%
um if if firing up the tractor on the
 
02:11:37.970 --> 02:11:37.980 align:start position:0%
property line at odd hours isn't allowed
 
02:11:39.890 --> 02:11:39.900 align:start position:0%
they will find some other way to be
 
02:11:41.629 --> 02:11:41.639 align:start position:0%
grudged their their neighbors we're
 
02:11:43.729 --> 02:11:43.739 align:start position:0%
talking about potentially shutting down
 
02:11:46.669 --> 02:11:46.679 align:start position:0%
an industry for the potentiality of a
 
02:11:48.830 --> 02:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
grudge match between neighbors occurring
 
02:11:53.030 --> 02:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
and for me that is not a sound reason to
 
02:11:57.050 --> 02:11:57.060 align:start position:0%
set uh such a strict uh State policy and
 
02:11:58.970 --> 02:11:58.980 align:start position:0%
and for that reason this amendment gives
 
02:12:00.729 --> 02:12:00.739 align:start position:0%
me great concern thank you madam chair
 
02:12:02.810 --> 02:12:02.820 align:start position:0%
representative Knapp
 
02:12:04.550 --> 02:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I can only speak
 
02:12:05.990 --> 02:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
to what happens in our town but we do
 
02:12:07.850 --> 02:12:07.860 align:start position:0%
have a farm that holds weddings and they
 
02:12:09.470 --> 02:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
have an exemption to do several a year
 
02:12:11.689 --> 02:12:11.699 align:start position:0%
but this completely takes the recourse
 
02:12:13.370 --> 02:12:13.380 align:start position:0%
away from the town and tries to mitigate
 
02:12:15.410 --> 02:12:15.420 align:start position:0%
that situation and a farm having a
 
02:12:18.950 --> 02:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
wedding it's agrotourism but it is a
 
02:12:20.570 --> 02:12:20.580 align:start position:0%
it's a really big event and it's a
 
02:12:22.310 --> 02:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
really big impact on the Butters and I
 
02:12:23.510 --> 02:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
think not having that exemption is
 
02:12:25.010 --> 02:12:25.020 align:start position:0%
really problematic I think
 
02:12:26.750 --> 02:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
representative dutsy also spoke to the
 
02:12:29.089 --> 02:12:29.099 align:start position:0%
fact that I think this bill entirely is
 
02:12:30.530 --> 02:12:30.540 align:start position:0%
too broad because the definition of
 
02:12:32.990 --> 02:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
farming is so broad that anyone who has
 
02:12:35.330 --> 02:12:35.340 align:start position:0%
one rooster or anyone who has one raised
 
02:12:36.950 --> 02:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
bed is essentially a Farm by definition
 
02:12:40.370 --> 02:12:40.380 align:start position:0%
and so I think this bill essentially
 
02:12:41.930 --> 02:12:41.940 align:start position:0%
cripples towns from having any sort of
 
02:12:43.850 --> 02:12:43.860 align:start position:0%
noise ordinance anyone could say I grow
 
02:12:46.070 --> 02:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
pumpkins in my backyard so therefore I
 
02:12:48.770 --> 02:12:48.780 align:start position:0%
can do anything any hour of the day so I
 
02:12:49.850 --> 02:12:49.860 align:start position:0%
appreciate the spirit of the bill
 
02:12:51.649 --> 02:12:51.659 align:start position:0%
because we have so many farms in my town
 
02:12:53.450 --> 02:12:53.460 align:start position:0%
and I do want to support them but I
 
02:12:55.129 --> 02:12:55.139 align:start position:0%
think as it's written it's overly broad
 
02:12:57.770 --> 02:12:57.780 align:start position:0%
I think not having an exemption for
 
02:13:00.050 --> 02:13:00.060 align:start position:0%
agritourism could be really disastrous
 
02:13:03.530 --> 02:13:03.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:06.229 --> 02:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
representative germana thank you madam
 
02:13:08.629 --> 02:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
chair and I appreciate my colleague
 
02:13:11.330 --> 02:13:11.340 align:start position:0%
represented uh ferval's reference to
 
02:13:13.310 --> 02:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
kind of the New Hampshire way and it
 
02:13:15.770 --> 02:13:15.780 align:start position:0%
puts me in the mind of a similar comment
 
02:13:17.750 --> 02:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
that the governor made in his inaugural
 
02:13:20.030 --> 02:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
address about the New Hampshire way
 
02:13:21.890 --> 02:13:21.900 align:start position:0%
would I sometimes get confused about is
 
02:13:23.870 --> 02:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
what local control means right if
 
02:13:25.609 --> 02:13:25.619 align:start position:0%
there's an argument about we need to
 
02:13:27.470 --> 02:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
have local control and resist for
 
02:13:29.870 --> 02:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
example regulations at the level of the
 
02:13:31.250 --> 02:13:31.260 align:start position:0%
federal government and yet in other
 
02:13:33.830 --> 02:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
cases it's okay if that control is in
 
02:13:36.890 --> 02:13:36.900 align:start position:0%
Concord and not in Keene or in Cheshire
 
02:13:39.229 --> 02:13:39.239 align:start position:0%
county or in other of our local
 
02:13:42.169 --> 02:13:42.179 align:start position:0%
communities so when we talk about what
 
02:13:44.450 --> 02:13:44.460 align:start position:0%
local control means I'm concerned
 
02:13:46.010 --> 02:13:46.020 align:start position:0%
because there's an inconsistency about
 
02:13:48.649 --> 02:13:48.659 align:start position:0%
how we apply that term in this case I
 
02:13:51.290 --> 02:13:51.300 align:start position:0%
think that giving localities the
 
02:13:53.089 --> 02:13:53.099 align:start position:0%
opportunity to work through these issues
 
02:13:55.550 --> 02:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
and make those decisions based upon the
 
02:13:58.910 --> 02:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
input of their citizens uh is uh to my
 
02:14:00.890 --> 02:14:00.900 align:start position:0%
mind a preferable example of the New
 
02:14:03.050 --> 02:14:03.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire way
 
02:14:05.689 --> 02:14:05.699 align:start position:0%
representative Davis
 
02:14:08.569 --> 02:14:08.579 align:start position:0%
yeah it just uh it leads me to wonder
 
02:14:10.910 --> 02:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
what if why is this being talked about
 
02:14:12.770 --> 02:14:12.780 align:start position:0%
just with agriculture like what if any
 
02:14:14.089 --> 02:14:14.099 align:start position:0%
of us have a
 
02:14:16.669 --> 02:14:16.679 align:start position:0%
have a wedding at our property have a
 
02:14:18.950 --> 02:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
graduation party I mean we have the
 
02:14:20.810 --> 02:14:20.820 align:start position:0%
ability to make the same noise without
 
02:14:23.510 --> 02:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
it being Agriculture and uh
 
02:14:25.310 --> 02:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
the farmers I think need all the help
 
02:14:27.290 --> 02:14:27.300 align:start position:0%
they can get I I believe this is
 
02:14:29.990 --> 02:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
sustaining a lot of the Farms so
 
02:14:33.050 --> 02:14:33.060 align:start position:0%
uh I know that's a commercial end of it
 
02:14:34.609 --> 02:14:34.619 align:start position:0%
it's not a private thing but there's
 
02:14:36.350 --> 02:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
only so many weekends there's only so
 
02:14:38.089 --> 02:14:38.099 align:start position:0%
many times this is going to be had in a
 
02:14:38.099 --> 02:14:38.870 align:start position:0%
many times this is going to be had in a
year

02:14:38.870 --> 02:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:14:41.089 --> 02:14:41.099 align:start position:0%
I I don't really feel like it's a place
 
02:14:43.490 --> 02:14:43.500 align:start position:0%
to legislate that they cannot have these
 
02:14:43.500 --> 02:14:47.569 align:start position:0%
to legislate that they cannot have these
functions

02:14:47.569 --> 02:14:47.579 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:50.149 --> 02:14:50.159 align:start position:0%
representative smart
 
02:14:53.870 --> 02:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
I also thank you madam chair I also we
 
02:14:57.169 --> 02:14:57.179 align:start position:0%
have a Airbnb up the road from us that's
 
02:15:00.830 --> 02:15:00.840 align:start position:0%
also a working farm and
 
02:15:00.840 --> 02:15:01.729 align:start position:0%
also a working farm and
um

02:15:01.729 --> 02:15:01.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:04.370 --> 02:15:04.380 align:start position:0%
they hold weddings there there's been I
 
02:15:08.030 --> 02:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
live in a very small community uh large
 
02:15:11.450 --> 02:15:11.460 align:start position:0%
acreage wise but small people wise and
 
02:15:14.689 --> 02:15:14.699 align:start position:0%
we've had people complain about
 
02:15:17.930 --> 02:15:17.940 align:start position:0%
the noise from the bands and what we
 
02:15:20.270 --> 02:15:20.280 align:start position:0%
have done as a community was go to the
 
02:15:23.330 --> 02:15:23.340 align:start position:0%
people that are hosting it and just
 
02:15:26.030 --> 02:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
saying at a certain time can we lower
 
02:15:28.910 --> 02:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
the noise for the band
 
02:15:31.310 --> 02:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
um just so that it's not reverberating
 
02:15:33.410 --> 02:15:33.420 align:start position:0%
across a community so therefore they can
 
02:15:36.350 --> 02:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
still have their venue they still but
 
02:15:38.930 --> 02:15:38.940 align:start position:0%
we're handling it more as a community
 
02:15:42.410 --> 02:15:42.420 align:start position:0%
than rather than a law
 
02:15:44.629 --> 02:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
um being passed so it's more neighborly
 
02:15:46.750 --> 02:15:46.760 align:start position:0%
which I think is the New Hampshire way
 
02:15:50.209 --> 02:15:50.219 align:start position:0%
thank you for that any other questions
 
02:15:53.950 --> 02:15:53.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:56.810 --> 02:15:56.820 align:start position:0%
represent Bixby yes
 
02:15:58.189 --> 02:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
um I think
 
02:16:03.109 --> 02:16:03.119 align:start position:0%
um I I'd like to move uh Amendment uh HB
 
02:16:08.649 --> 02:16:08.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:12.589 --> 02:16:12.599 align:start position:0%
2023-0178h uh and which is the which
 
02:16:14.689 --> 02:16:14.699 align:start position:0%
would remove the agritourism from the
 
02:16:20.689 --> 02:16:20.699 align:start position:0%
exemption uh and uh we can then further
 
02:16:23.089 --> 02:16:23.099 align:start position:0%
discuss whether or not uh we're going to
 
02:16:26.089 --> 02:16:26.099 align:start position:0%
keep that in place or add that to the
 
02:16:26.099 --> 02:16:26.870 align:start position:0%
keep that in place or add that to the
bill

02:16:26.870 --> 02:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:16:31.729 --> 02:16:31.739 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:36.830 --> 02:16:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:39.230 --> 02:16:39.240 align:start position:0%
okay would you like to speak to that
 
02:16:42.770 --> 02:16:42.780 align:start position:0%
motion representative Bixby yes so
 
02:16:42.780 --> 02:16:43.429 align:start position:0%
motion representative Bixby yes so
um

02:16:43.429 --> 02:16:43.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:46.009 --> 02:16:46.019 align:start position:0%
I think that there is there's a
 
02:16:48.950 --> 02:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
there's a combination of uh well I guess
 
02:16:52.129 --> 02:16:52.139 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons that I uh think that
 
02:16:54.469 --> 02:16:54.479 align:start position:0%
is important to have attach this
 
02:16:56.629 --> 02:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
amendment is because this is an issue
 
02:17:00.169 --> 02:17:00.179 align:start position:0%
that was raised uh to me and I think it
 
02:17:02.330 --> 02:17:02.340 align:start position:0%
was also raised in the hearing by both
 
02:17:05.990 --> 02:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
the Farm Bureau and by uh the by the
 
02:17:10.669 --> 02:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
commissioner that uh that the uh not
 
02:17:13.969 --> 02:17:13.979 align:start position:0%
having this uh exempt exemption for the
 
02:17:18.290 --> 02:17:18.300 align:start position:0%
from the exemption for uh agritourism uh
 
02:17:22.429 --> 02:17:22.439 align:start position:0%
could create uh further problems and
 
02:17:23.810 --> 02:17:23.820 align:start position:0%
um I think that
 
02:17:23.820 --> 02:17:24.650 align:start position:0%
um I think that
um

02:17:24.650 --> 02:17:24.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:28.849 --> 02:17:28.859 align:start position:0%
and just taking on taking I I I value
 
02:17:30.589 --> 02:17:30.599 align:start position:0%
the advice of the Farm Bureau I value
 
02:17:32.270 --> 02:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
the advice of the commissioner and I
 
02:17:35.629 --> 02:17:35.639 align:start position:0%
think that uh that the commissioner has
 
02:17:37.790 --> 02:17:37.800 align:start position:0%
been Fielding a number of questions
 
02:17:41.629 --> 02:17:41.639 align:start position:0%
related to agritourism and to uh the
 
02:17:44.030 --> 02:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
boundaries of it and he's
 
02:17:46.429 --> 02:17:46.439 align:start position:0%
familiar with enough with this that I
 
02:17:50.530 --> 02:17:50.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:53.450 --> 02:17:53.460 align:start position:0%
any other comment representative verbal
 
02:17:57.169 --> 02:17:57.179 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and uh I I
 
02:17:59.509 --> 02:17:59.519 align:start position:0%
I don't disagree I suppose in in
 
02:18:02.530 --> 02:18:02.540 align:start position:0%
principle I guess my preference would be
 
02:18:05.990 --> 02:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
that the state committee
 
02:18:10.610 --> 02:18:10.620 align:start position:0%
take a reactive approach to potential
 
02:18:13.310 --> 02:18:13.320 align:start position:0%
problems after they manifest themselves
 
02:18:16.610 --> 02:18:16.620 align:start position:0%
rather than taking a proactive approach
 
02:18:20.030 --> 02:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
and carving out certain types of
 
02:18:23.509 --> 02:18:23.519 align:start position:0%
businesses on anecdotes of it being some
 
02:18:27.290 --> 02:18:27.300 align:start position:0%
sort of serious problem in the state I
 
02:18:28.730 --> 02:18:28.740 align:start position:0%
don't I don't believe it is a serious
 
02:18:30.830 --> 02:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
problem in the state I think it's highly
 
02:18:32.750 --> 02:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
unlikely to become a serious problem in
 
02:18:34.790 --> 02:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
the state and so I would I would say
 
02:18:36.830 --> 02:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
that we we should not pass this
 
02:18:39.049 --> 02:18:39.059 align:start position:0%
amendment we should pass the bill as
 
02:18:42.110 --> 02:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
we've previously amended it and then if
 
02:18:44.450 --> 02:18:44.460 align:start position:0%
uh if a problem you know if people can
 
02:18:46.429 --> 02:18:46.439 align:start position:0%
come forth and demonstrate that there is
 
02:18:49.190 --> 02:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
an actual problem that would be a better
 
02:18:51.950 --> 02:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
time for us to to legislate corrective
 
02:18:54.650 --> 02:18:54.660 align:start position:0%
action so that would be my preference
 
02:18:56.570 --> 02:18:56.580 align:start position:0%
and for that reason I think I'll be
 
02:18:58.009 --> 02:18:58.019 align:start position:0%
voting against this amendment thank you
 
02:19:00.290 --> 02:19:00.300 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
02:19:02.150 --> 02:19:02.160 align:start position:0%

02:19:04.620 --> 02:19:06.790 align:start position:0%

representative

02:19:06.790 --> 02:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:19:09.950 --> 02:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
representative Howard
 
02:19:13.009 --> 02:19:13.019 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't pertain to the noise issue
 
02:19:14.629 --> 02:19:14.639 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about here but in my
 
02:19:14.639 --> 02:19:15.650 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about here but in my
town

02:19:15.650 --> 02:19:15.660 align:start position:0%
town
 
02:19:17.509 --> 02:19:17.519 align:start position:0%
um we do have some people who came into
 
02:19:19.730 --> 02:19:19.740 align:start position:0%
the town and um bought a piece of
 
02:19:21.650 --> 02:19:21.660 align:start position:0%
property and started calling themselves
 
02:19:24.950 --> 02:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
a farm and you know did it clear did a
 
02:19:26.690 --> 02:19:26.700 align:start position:0%
bunch of stuff without any permits from
 
02:19:28.610 --> 02:19:28.620 align:start position:0%
the town and when they were called into
 
02:19:31.790 --> 02:19:31.800 align:start position:0%
the town to to start to the process of
 
02:19:33.530 --> 02:19:33.540 align:start position:0%
negotiating with the town for permitting
 
02:19:36.169 --> 02:19:36.179 align:start position:0%
and they used the agriculture as a
 
02:19:37.849 --> 02:19:37.859 align:start position:0%
defense against needing to check with
 
02:19:40.910 --> 02:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
the town at all so I think that taking
 
02:19:44.629 --> 02:19:44.639 align:start position:0%
um the power to to legislate important
 
02:19:46.730 --> 02:19:46.740 align:start position:0%
things like what what you do like how
 
02:19:48.169 --> 02:19:48.179 align:start position:0%
you use your land
 
02:19:50.950 --> 02:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
um that that is harmful to the community
 
02:19:53.210 --> 02:19:53.220 align:start position:0%
that that needs to stay in the hands of
 
02:19:55.610 --> 02:19:55.620 align:start position:0%
the municipalities and not um and so I
 
02:19:57.530 --> 02:19:57.540 align:start position:0%
think that by eliminating
 
02:20:00.650 --> 02:20:00.660 align:start position:0%
the exemption from agritourism it gives
 
02:20:03.950 --> 02:20:03.960 align:start position:0%
you the town a chance to um apply its
 
02:20:03.960 --> 02:20:07.010 align:start position:0%
you the town a chance to um apply its
ordinances

02:20:07.010 --> 02:20:07.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:10.849 --> 02:20:10.859 align:start position:0%

I did send it out to everybody I don't
 
02:23:53.330 --> 02:23:53.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:54.950 --> 02:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
but basically
 
02:23:54.960 --> 02:23:57.889 align:start position:0%

um

02:23:57.889 --> 02:23:57.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:59.809 --> 02:23:59.819 align:start position:0%
um Madam chair thank you very much so
 
02:24:02.510 --> 02:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
basically the amendment uh just
 
02:24:04.670 --> 02:24:04.680 align:start position:0%
um looks at the radius that we had
 
02:24:06.650 --> 02:24:06.660 align:start position:0%
discussed instead of it being 50 miles
 
02:24:10.610 --> 02:24:10.620 align:start position:0%
it was reduced down to 20 miles
 
02:24:13.309 --> 02:24:13.319 align:start position:0%
um and so basically that would
 
02:24:13.319 --> 02:24:13.849 align:start position:0%
um and so basically that would
um

02:24:13.849 --> 02:24:13.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:16.130 --> 02:24:16.140 align:start position:0%
just replace that language in that
 
02:24:18.170 --> 02:24:18.180 align:start position:0%
respect it's just
 
02:24:22.250 --> 02:24:22.260 align:start position:0%
shortening that um circumference
 
02:24:24.349 --> 02:24:24.359 align:start position:0%
okay thank you anybody would anybody
 
02:24:26.450 --> 02:24:26.460 align:start position:0%

02:24:37.090 --> 02:24:37.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:41.630 --> 02:24:41.640 align:start position:0%

uh so um
 
02:24:46.790 --> 02:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby
 
02:24:50.929 --> 02:24:50.939 align:start position:0%
yeah so uh what the so the
 
02:24:53.389 --> 02:24:53.399 align:start position:0%
um excuse me one moment did we have a
 
02:24:55.130 --> 02:24:55.140 align:start position:0%
second on that that was going to be my
 
02:24:57.530 --> 02:24:57.540 align:start position:0%
point of water yeah I'm sorry we need a
 
02:25:00.050 --> 02:25:00.060 align:start position:0%
second on the moment okay
 
02:25:03.170 --> 02:25:03.180 align:start position:0%
um yeah I'll I'll I'll second that
 
02:25:06.230 --> 02:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:06.240 --> 02:25:07.370 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:25:07.370 --> 02:25:07.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:09.349 --> 02:25:09.359 align:start position:0%
okay so we now have a second and now I
 
02:25:11.450 --> 02:25:11.460 align:start position:0%
can make a brief comment right right now
 
02:25:14.210 --> 02:25:14.220 align:start position:0%
you can speak to your motion so uh the
 
02:25:16.190 --> 02:25:16.200 align:start position:0%
original Bill had
 
02:25:18.290 --> 02:25:18.300 align:start position:0%
um said that the radius that there had
 
02:25:22.190 --> 02:25:22.200 align:start position:0%
to be an available uh processor for
 
02:25:28.610 --> 02:25:28.620 align:start position:0%
um food waste uh uh in order for a uh an
 
02:25:30.830 --> 02:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
organization or company or a business to
 
02:25:35.030 --> 02:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
be governed by this could be 50 miles uh
 
02:25:38.870 --> 02:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
and in in the hearing we heard that uh
 
02:25:41.030 --> 02:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
neighboring states typically had 20
 
02:25:44.270 --> 02:25:44.280 align:start position:0%
miles and we didn't feel that uh it was
 
02:25:45.889 --> 02:25:45.899 align:start position:0%
necessary to be stricter than
 
02:25:48.410 --> 02:25:48.420 align:start position:0%
neighboring states so uh we reduced it
 
02:25:49.969 --> 02:25:49.979 align:start position:0%
to 20 miles
 
02:25:53.690 --> 02:25:53.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:58.550 --> 02:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:00.770 --> 02:26:00.780 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
02:26:03.290 --> 02:26:03.300 align:start position:0%

02:27:17.160 --> 02:27:18.889 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:27:21.010 --> 02:27:21.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:23.450 --> 02:27:23.460 align:start position:0%
oh yeah yeah would you speak to that
 
02:27:26.530 --> 02:27:26.540 align:start position:0%
motion I'm sorry thank you madam chair
 
02:27:29.990 --> 02:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
I got lost no that's okay thank you so
 
02:27:33.290 --> 02:27:33.300 align:start position:0%
HP 300 as amended would basically
 
02:27:35.990 --> 02:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
um look to ban uh food waste generators
 
02:27:38.330 --> 02:27:38.340 align:start position:0%
who produce more than a ton or more of
 
02:27:40.250 --> 02:27:40.260 align:start position:0%
food waste from disposing that in
 
02:27:43.610 --> 02:27:43.620 align:start position:0%
landfills and based on what we know has
 
02:27:45.469 --> 02:27:45.479 align:start position:0%
come out of our Solid Waste uh working
 
02:27:48.110 --> 02:27:48.120 align:start position:0%
groups these are recommendations that we
 
02:27:49.670 --> 02:27:49.680 align:start position:0%
are working towards as a state
 
02:27:52.670 --> 02:27:52.680 align:start position:0%
collectively that would also go towards
 
02:27:55.250 --> 02:27:55.260 align:start position:0%
our waste disposal reduction goals and
 
02:27:57.650 --> 02:27:57.660 align:start position:0%
so to that end I would urge
 
02:27:59.870 --> 02:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
otpa thank you
 
02:28:01.730 --> 02:28:01.740 align:start position:0%
any other discussion on this
 
02:28:03.830 --> 02:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby yeah
 
02:28:06.770 --> 02:28:06.780 align:start position:0%
yeah it's sort of to amplify that one of
 
02:28:06.780 --> 02:28:07.670 align:start position:0%
yeah it's sort of to amplify that one of
um

02:28:07.670 --> 02:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:11.389 --> 02:28:11.399 align:start position:0%
one food waste going into landfills is
 
02:28:13.610 --> 02:28:13.620 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
02:28:17.330 --> 02:28:17.340 align:start position:0%
um greatest generators of uh of
 
02:28:20.330 --> 02:28:20.340 align:start position:0%
off-gassing from a landfills is also
 
02:28:24.170 --> 02:28:24.180 align:start position:0%
very heavy the the tonnage of of organic
 
02:28:25.490 --> 02:28:25.500 align:start position:0%
waste going into landfills is
 
02:28:29.270 --> 02:28:29.280 align:start position:0%
substantial uh it is something that is
 
02:28:29.280 --> 02:28:29.990 align:start position:0%
substantial uh it is something that is
um

02:28:29.990 --> 02:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:35.450 --> 02:28:35.460 align:start position:0%
uh that uh is doesn't really has other
 
02:28:37.550 --> 02:28:37.560 align:start position:0%
use higher and better uses than going
 
02:28:41.030 --> 02:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
into landfill uh so uh one of the things
 
02:28:42.950 --> 02:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
that the bill does is it creates a set
 
02:28:46.370 --> 02:28:46.380 align:start position:0%
of diversion goals so if the food waste
 
02:28:50.570 --> 02:28:50.580 align:start position:0%
is wasted is actually uh viable for
 
02:28:53.570 --> 02:28:53.580 align:start position:0%
being used to feed people who need the
 
02:28:56.210 --> 02:28:56.220 align:start position:0%
food there are methods of subverting it
 
02:28:56.220 --> 02:28:57.230 align:start position:0%
food there are methods of subverting it
to

02:28:57.230 --> 02:28:57.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:28:57.240 --> 02:28:58.070 align:start position:0%
to
um

02:28:58.070 --> 02:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:02.690 --> 02:29:02.700 align:start position:0%
the food banks food pantries uh that is
 
02:29:06.290 --> 02:29:06.300 align:start position:0%
a higher diversion method than uh and uh
 
02:29:07.730 --> 02:29:07.740 align:start position:0%
that would count towards a thousand
 
02:29:11.210 --> 02:29:11.220 align:start position:0%
pounds of diversion uh if it is uh
 
02:29:13.849 --> 02:29:13.859 align:start position:0%
compostable then it can or it could be
 
02:29:16.130 --> 02:29:16.140 align:start position:0%
used as animal feed those are also
 
02:29:20.150 --> 02:29:20.160 align:start position:0%
viable methods of diversion so uh the
 
02:29:22.730 --> 02:29:22.740 align:start position:0%
idea is that by using the hierarchy in
 
02:29:25.250 --> 02:29:25.260 align:start position:0%
the Bill of diverting it to the best
 
02:29:28.250 --> 02:29:28.260 align:start position:0%
uses uh we can get we can remove this
 
02:29:30.410 --> 02:29:30.420 align:start position:0%
waste stream from the landfill the
 
02:29:32.210 --> 02:29:32.220 align:start position:0%
reason for the thousand pounds is
 
02:29:32.220 --> 02:29:33.849 align:start position:0%
reason for the thousand pounds is
because

02:29:33.849 --> 02:29:33.859 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:29:38.389 --> 02:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
uh the one oh sorry the one ton is that
 
02:29:38.399 --> 02:29:39.889 align:start position:0%
uh the one oh sorry the one ton is that
um

02:29:39.889 --> 02:29:39.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:43.490 --> 02:29:43.500 align:start position:0%
being able to we need to uh jump start
 
02:29:46.730 --> 02:29:46.740 align:start position:0%
an industry to be able to handle this
 
02:29:51.349 --> 02:29:51.359 align:start position:0%
and by starting with large producers it
 
02:29:54.290 --> 02:29:54.300 align:start position:0%
will make it easier for uh for
 
02:29:56.750 --> 02:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
businesses to start up or to move into
 
02:29:59.090 --> 02:29:59.100 align:start position:0%
the area that would be able to handle
 
02:30:01.429 --> 02:30:01.439 align:start position:0%
that those larger more concentrated
 
02:30:04.190 --> 02:30:04.200 align:start position:0%
amounts before figuring out how to deal
 
02:30:07.130 --> 02:30:07.140 align:start position:0%
with picking up a few pounds here and
 
02:30:11.710 --> 02:30:11.720 align:start position:0%
there from from a lot of residential
 
02:30:14.690 --> 02:30:14.700 align:start position:0%
sources uh which is much more
 
02:30:17.389 --> 02:30:17.399 align:start position:0%
challenging logistically than on picking
 
02:30:20.750 --> 02:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
up from concentrated sources so a
 
02:30:22.670 --> 02:30:22.680 align:start position:0%
secondary effect of this bill should be
 
02:30:24.950 --> 02:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
that it will generate businesses in New
 
02:30:26.809 --> 02:30:26.819 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that will be able to handle
 
02:30:28.730 --> 02:30:28.740 align:start position:0%
this waste
 
02:30:30.410 --> 02:30:30.420 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Bixby
 
02:30:32.990 --> 02:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you in
 
02:30:35.210 --> 02:30:35.220 align:start position:0%
addition to that um there are goals that
 
02:30:36.410 --> 02:30:36.420 align:start position:0%
both the working group and the
 
02:30:38.270 --> 02:30:38.280 align:start position:0%
celebration management plan have worked
 
02:30:40.550 --> 02:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
towards and one of those is also to work
 
02:30:40.560 --> 02:30:41.809 align:start position:0%
towards and one of those is also to work
towards

02:30:41.809 --> 02:30:41.819 align:start position:0%
towards
 
02:30:43.490 --> 02:30:43.500 align:start position:0%
um industry supporting industry uh
 
02:30:45.590 --> 02:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
Solutions and so I think that this bill
 
02:30:47.809 --> 02:30:47.819 align:start position:0%
also supports those goals within those
 
02:30:49.730 --> 02:30:49.740 align:start position:0%
working groups as well thank you any
 
02:30:51.950 --> 02:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
other comments representative jamona
 
02:30:53.809 --> 02:30:53.819 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I'd like to speak
 
02:30:56.929 --> 02:30:56.939 align:start position:0%
in favor of the bill I recently attended
 
02:30:59.030 --> 02:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
a city council meeting in Keene where
 
02:31:00.469 --> 02:31:00.479 align:start position:0%
there was a presentation by the
 
02:31:03.170 --> 02:31:03.180 align:start position:0%
assistant director of the landfill in
 
02:31:06.349 --> 02:31:06.359 align:start position:0%
Keene uh and he was talking to the the
 
02:31:08.030 --> 02:31:08.040 align:start position:0%
council about how we're running out of
 
02:31:10.309 --> 02:31:10.319 align:start position:0%
space in our landfill this is a serious
 
02:31:11.210 --> 02:31:11.220 align:start position:0%
issue we're going to have to start
 
02:31:12.950 --> 02:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
considering and I know that Keen is not
 
02:31:15.889 --> 02:31:15.899 align:start position:0%
going to be alone in that so as much
 
02:31:20.630 --> 02:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
food waste as we can divert uh will be
 
02:31:22.790 --> 02:31:22.800 align:start position:0%
extremely helpful in in terms of using
 
02:31:24.950 --> 02:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh that space wisely and I also wanted
 
02:31:28.550 --> 02:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
to speak also briefly to a point that
 
02:31:30.950 --> 02:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby made about the
 
02:31:32.809 --> 02:31:32.819 align:start position:0%
opportunities this creates for
 
02:31:35.270 --> 02:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
businesses to begin to fill this Niche
 
02:31:37.550 --> 02:31:37.560 align:start position:0%
we've got a great startup business in
 
02:31:40.730 --> 02:31:40.740 align:start position:0%
Keene Elm City compost initiative and
 
02:31:42.950 --> 02:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
that's been growing uh you know working
 
02:31:45.530 --> 02:31:45.540 align:start position:0%
with residents I used her services and

02:33:38.330 --> 02:33:38.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:43.190 --> 02:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
and her Amendment clears up the language
 
02:33:46.370 --> 02:33:46.380 align:start position:0%
oh I'm do I hear a second by the way
 
02:33:51.110 --> 02:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:53.450 --> 02:33:53.460 align:start position:0%
yes you got it
 
02:33:53.460 --> 02:33:54.889 align:start position:0%
yes you got it
okay

02:33:54.889 --> 02:33:54.899 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:33:57.290 --> 02:33:57.300 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to speak to my Amendment uh
 
02:33:59.870 --> 02:33:59.880 align:start position:0%
here the amendment that was presented uh
 
02:34:02.530 --> 02:34:02.540 align:start position:0%
this amendment clears up the language
 
02:34:07.370 --> 02:34:07.380 align:start position:0%
uh which is in the bill uh regarding
 
02:34:12.469 --> 02:34:12.479 align:start position:0%
uh extra sources of income to this fund
 
02:34:16.969 --> 02:34:16.979 align:start position:0%
um the fund is is the solid waste
 
02:34:18.610 --> 02:34:18.620 align:start position:0%
management fund
 
02:34:18.620 --> 02:34:20.210 align:start position:0%
management fund
and

02:34:20.210 --> 02:34:20.220 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:34:23.270 --> 02:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
um so the wording includes United States
 
02:34:25.490 --> 02:34:25.500 align:start position:0%
environment Protection Agency and other
 
02:34:27.710 --> 02:34:27.720 align:start position:0%
federal agencies gifts donations of
 
02:34:30.410 --> 02:34:30.420 align:start position:0%
money grants legislative Appropriations
 
02:34:32.570 --> 02:34:32.580 align:start position:0%
or any other matching funds in its
 
02:34:35.750 --> 02:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
incentives so this is good because this
 
02:34:38.450 --> 02:34:38.460 align:start position:0%
allows the fund to accept monies from
 
02:34:43.250 --> 02:34:43.260 align:start position:0%
other places other than general fund
 
02:34:45.410 --> 02:34:45.420 align:start position:0%
do I hear any further discussion on this
 
02:34:45.420 --> 02:34:46.670 align:start position:0%
do I hear any further discussion on this
amendment

02:34:46.670 --> 02:34:46.680 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:34:50.990 --> 02:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby uh just to um the
 
02:34:54.290 --> 02:34:54.300 align:start position:0%
the original version had a phrasing that
 
02:34:56.809 --> 02:34:56.819 align:start position:0%
made it seem like all of the money had
 
02:34:59.870 --> 02:34:59.880 align:start position:0%
to be coming from some sort of uh EPA or
 
02:35:03.590 --> 02:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
federal Source uh in one reading of it
 
02:35:05.750 --> 02:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
and what this amendment does is it just
 
02:35:08.750 --> 02:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
uh makes the wording clear
 
02:35:10.429 --> 02:35:10.439 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Bixby any
 
02:35:13.670 --> 02:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
further discussion on this amendment
 
02:35:16.130 --> 02:35:16.140 align:start position:0%
seeing none I direct the clerk to take a
 
02:35:17.929 --> 02:35:17.939 align:start position:0%

so we have a solid waste management fund

02:36:33.950 --> 02:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
of two million dollars for fiscal year
 
02:36:37.490 --> 02:36:37.500 align:start position:0%
ending June 30th 2023
 
02:36:39.830 --> 02:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
um that way we can fund the efforts to
 
02:36:43.849 --> 02:36:43.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:47.410 --> 02:36:47.420 align:start position:0%
diversion programs where we would be
 
02:36:51.969 --> 02:36:51.979 align:start position:0%
supporting efforts to promote
 
02:36:54.290 --> 02:36:54.300 align:start position:0%

02:36:54.300 --> 02:36:55.190 align:start position:0%

Murray thank you madam chair I I too

concur with your statement I think that
 
02:37:12.230 --> 02:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
this is a great first step to directing
 
02:37:14.510 --> 02:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
some dedicated funding to an area that
 
02:37:16.190 --> 02:37:16.200 align:start position:0%
we can use this for the sole purpose of
 
02:37:19.250 --> 02:37:19.260 align:start position:0%
recycling and compost initiatives so I
 
02:37:21.950 --> 02:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
thank the committee for their work and
 
02:37:24.910 --> 02:37:24.920 align:start position:0%

um
 
02:37:36.170 --> 02:37:36.180 align:start position:0%
concur with everything that's been said
 
02:37:38.450 --> 02:37:38.460 align:start position:0%
I think that this allows so much
 
02:37:40.910 --> 02:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity we've heard in the past how
 
02:37:42.230 --> 02:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
our elementary schools are really
 
02:37:44.510 --> 02:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
working hard towards recycling efforts
 
02:37:47.690 --> 02:37:47.700 align:start position:0%
and composting efforts and this bill
 
02:37:49.910 --> 02:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
will outline that it will further that
 
02:37:52.550 --> 02:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
and I work as an elementary teacher in a
 
02:37:54.410 --> 02:37:54.420 align:start position:0%
school that does do this program through
 
02:37:56.630 --> 02:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
Mr Fox and I think that supporting these
 
02:37:58.550 --> 02:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
efforts is really crucial as we move
 
02:38:00.230 --> 02:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
forward so
 
02:38:03.410 --> 02:38:03.420 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Bixby
 
02:38:06.170 --> 02:38:06.180 align:start position:0%
yes um there's also there's some
 
02:38:10.250 --> 02:38:10.260 align:start position:0%
possibility that uh this uh money will
 
02:38:12.590 --> 02:38:12.600 align:start position:0%
also be an appropriation listed within
 
02:38:14.809 --> 02:38:14.819 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget uh they haven't
 
02:38:16.730 --> 02:38:16.740 align:start position:0%

02:38:20.929 --> 02:38:20.939 align:start position:0%
said they would consider it I don't know
 
02:38:24.110 --> 02:38:24.120 align:start position:0%
uh but uh if it does if that's the case
 
02:38:26.270 --> 02:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
then having this a positive vote from
 
02:38:28.849 --> 02:38:28.859 align:start position:0%
our committee we'll uh give it a
 
02:38:30.650 --> 02:38:30.660 align:start position:0%
stronger position when this bill goes to
 
02:38:30.660 --> 02:38:32.210 align:start position:0%

02:39:58.849 --> 02:39:58.859 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby would you like to
 
02:40:01.070 --> 02:40:01.080 align:start position:0%
speak to your most yes this is a a bill
 
02:40:03.770 --> 02:40:03.780 align:start position:0%
that came out of the study committee uh
 
02:40:08.990 --> 02:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
on soil conditioners last fall and uh we
 
02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:10.270 align:start position:0%
on soil conditioners last fall and uh we
um

02:40:10.270 --> 02:40:10.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:13.849 --> 02:40:13.859 align:start position:0%
learned that the uh all the fees from
 
02:40:16.910 --> 02:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
fertilizer and lime uh are currently
 
02:40:20.510 --> 02:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
directed to the general fund and uh we
 
02:40:22.370 --> 02:40:22.380 align:start position:0%
felt that in order to give the
 
02:40:24.650 --> 02:40:24.660 align:start position:0%
department clearer control over those
 
02:40:27.670 --> 02:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
funds because they are being charged to
 
02:40:31.969 --> 02:40:31.979 align:start position:0%
uh programs uh and use they're being
 
02:40:33.590 --> 02:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
charged to people who are served by the
 
02:40:35.870 --> 02:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
department of force for the purpose of
 
02:40:38.990 --> 02:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
of managing that program we felt that it
 
02:40:42.050 --> 02:40:42.060 align:start position:0%
would be a clearer connection between
 
02:40:44.870 --> 02:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
the fee and what the fee is doing if we
 
02:40:46.969 --> 02:40:46.979 align:start position:0%
had those fees go to a dedicated fund
 
02:40:48.830 --> 02:40:48.840 align:start position:0%
within the Department of Agriculture for
 
02:40:53.389 --> 02:40:53.399 align:start position:0%
the purpose of administering uh the um
 
02:40:55.490 --> 02:40:55.500 align:start position:0%
that section of law
 
02:40:57.950 --> 02:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Bixby any other

representative thank you madam chair
 
02:41:05.870 --> 02:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
um I think it's extremely important
 
02:41:08.750 --> 02:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
um as I've spoken before that fertilizer
 
02:41:11.210 --> 02:41:11.220 align:start position:0%
actually be tested in this state because
 
02:41:14.030 --> 02:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
with macro and micronutrients not at the
 
02:41:15.650 --> 02:41:15.660 align:start position:0%
levels it says on the label can have
 
02:41:18.650 --> 02:41:18.660 align:start position:0%
adverse effects on agriculture
 
02:41:21.110 --> 02:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
um and that's something we don't want
 
02:41:23.150 --> 02:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
and it would shorten you know we have
 
02:41:24.770 --> 02:41:24.780 align:start position:0%
such a short growing season we need to
 
02:41:26.750 --> 02:41:26.760 align:start position:0%

02:41:28.309 --> 02:41:28.319 align:start position:0%

Creighton to give us an update about
 
02:42:52.429 --> 02:42:52.439 align:start position:0%
what that was all about
 
02:42:54.590 --> 02:42:54.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair first of all I'd
 
02:42:56.990 --> 02:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
like to thank representative Bixby and
 
02:42:59.750 --> 02:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
Davis who also attended the training and
 
02:43:01.550 --> 02:43:01.560 align:start position:0%
you two gentlemen could keep me straight
 
02:43:04.010 --> 02:43:04.020 align:start position:0%
if I missed something bottom line was
 
02:43:05.389 --> 02:43:05.399 align:start position:0%
about two and a half hours very
 
02:43:07.490 --> 02:43:07.500 align:start position:0%
professionally done
 
02:43:09.670 --> 02:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
um by the folks at the state
 
02:43:12.590 --> 02:43:12.600 align:start position:0%
and I'm just going to boil it down to
 
02:43:14.750 --> 02:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
uh two things
 
02:43:18.110 --> 02:43:18.120 align:start position:0%
um one is uh they talked about fire
 
02:43:21.590 --> 02:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
escape and what we do uh bottom line is
 
02:43:23.150 --> 02:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
if there's a fire in this building we
 
02:43:25.250 --> 02:43:25.260 align:start position:0%
take the stairs number one the closest
 
02:43:27.230 --> 02:43:27.240 align:start position:0%
stairs is go out here you make a left
 
02:43:30.710 --> 02:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
and you go down and you assemble
 
02:43:32.330 --> 02:43:32.340 align:start position:0%
um outside the building at which point
 
02:43:35.929 --> 02:43:35.939 align:start position:0%
will take uh we'll take roll
 
02:43:35.939 --> 02:43:36.770 align:start position:0%
will take uh we'll take roll
um

02:43:36.770 --> 02:43:36.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:39.230 --> 02:43:39.240 align:start position:0%
and it'll be it'll be directly across
 
02:43:41.870 --> 02:43:41.880 align:start position:0%
the street from this exit here where the
 
02:43:43.910 --> 02:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
stairs are
 
02:43:45.770 --> 02:43:45.780 align:start position:0%
um so that that's pretty straightforward
 
02:43:48.170 --> 02:43:48.180 align:start position:0%
and the other one that we spent a lot of
 
02:43:50.389 --> 02:43:50.399 align:start position:0%
time was active shooter
 
02:43:52.610 --> 02:43:52.620 align:start position:0%
um and we've all seen the news
 
02:43:55.070 --> 02:43:55.080 align:start position:0%
um plenty of incidents of where that's
 
02:43:57.170 --> 02:43:57.180 align:start position:0%
happened and they went through uh quite
 
02:43:58.790 --> 02:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
a few examples yesterday
 
02:44:01.670 --> 02:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
bottom line is there's the the doctrine
 
02:44:05.210 --> 02:44:05.220 align:start position:0%
is that uh you avoid the shooter if at
 
02:44:06.410 --> 02:44:06.420 align:start position:0%
all possible
 
02:44:09.410 --> 02:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
then you deny access to where you're at
 
02:44:12.530 --> 02:44:12.540 align:start position:0%
and then you defend if necessary uh
 
02:44:14.450 --> 02:44:14.460 align:start position:0%
recognize you that there are no rules in
 
02:44:16.730 --> 02:44:16.740 align:start position:0%
that fight and then anything we can do
 
02:44:19.130 --> 02:44:19.140 align:start position:0%
to defend ourselves is is considered
 
02:44:21.110 --> 02:44:21.120 align:start position:0%
fair game
 
02:44:24.170 --> 02:44:24.180 align:start position:0%
um and so representative Davis and I
 
02:44:25.790 --> 02:44:25.800 align:start position:0%
took a look at this room and what we're
 
02:44:28.429 --> 02:44:28.439 align:start position:0%
talking about is what happens if someone
 
02:44:32.270 --> 02:44:32.280 align:start position:0%
comes in here and threatens us okay so
 
02:44:34.370 --> 02:44:34.380 align:start position:0%
the first thing is that the chair and
 
02:44:36.710 --> 02:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
representative Davis will have a code uh
 
02:44:38.389 --> 02:44:38.399 align:start position:0%
where representative Davis if he
 
02:44:41.150 --> 02:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
recognizes something is not right we'll
 
02:44:44.330 --> 02:44:44.340 align:start position:0%
go outside he'll notify security call
 
02:44:46.490 --> 02:44:46.500 align:start position:0%
9-1-1 that's his designated
 
02:44:46.500 --> 02:44:47.929 align:start position:0%
9-1-1 that's his designated
responsibility

02:44:47.929 --> 02:44:47.939 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
02:44:51.110 --> 02:44:51.120 align:start position:0%
uh the second aspect of this is to avoid
 
02:44:53.809 --> 02:44:53.819 align:start position:0%
and so what we would do in this room if
 
02:44:55.969 --> 02:44:55.979 align:start position:0%
someone was out in the hall for example
 
02:44:58.490 --> 02:44:58.500 align:start position:0%
is that um
 
02:45:00.889 --> 02:45:00.899 align:start position:0%
we turn off the lights
 
02:45:03.590 --> 02:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
turn off cell phones or turn them down
 
02:45:05.630 --> 02:45:05.640 align:start position:0%
so they're not Audible
 
02:45:07.670 --> 02:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
and then we would
 
02:45:10.250 --> 02:45:10.260 align:start position:0%
um move into this area and that area so
 
02:45:12.410 --> 02:45:12.420 align:start position:0%
we're not visible from these windows
 
02:45:14.150 --> 02:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
so that if someone looked into the room
 
02:45:15.969 --> 02:45:15.979 align:start position:0%
it would look empty
 
02:45:19.969 --> 02:45:19.979 align:start position:0%
and the other thing we would do is we
 
02:45:22.250 --> 02:45:22.260 align:start position:0%
would block these doors and by two
 
02:45:33.230 --> 02:45:33.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:39.010 --> 02:45:39.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:42.050 --> 02:45:42.060 align:start position:0%
no that's good
 
02:45:46.010 --> 02:45:46.020 align:start position:0%
um so we should recess yes
 
02:45:49.250 --> 02:45:49.260 align:start position:0%
so we not be if we're talking about what
 
02:45:51.469 --> 02:45:51.479 align:start position:0%
we're going to be doing in the case of
 
02:45:54.469 --> 02:45:54.479 align:start position:0%
Senator that's a great Point uh we
 
02:45:55.790 --> 02:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be
 
02:45:59.570 --> 02:45:59.580 align:start position:0%
making it making our plan yeah yeah no
 
02:46:01.610 --> 02:46:01.620 align:start position:0%
no it's a great one at least turn off
 
02:46:04.849 --> 02:46:04.859 align:start position:0%
your microphones yes okay well so I will
 
02:46:07.849 --> 02:46:07.859 align:start position:0%
recess uh our our
 
02:46:10.870 --> 02:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
committee and we will
 
02:46:15.590 --> 02:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
reconvene later for hearings and I guess
 
02:46:18.650 --> 02:46:18.660 align:start position:0%
we shut off our mics see you later point
 
02:46:21.650 --> 02:46:21.660 align:start position:0%
of order can we go into non-public
 
02:46:24.710 --> 02:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
I don't know no I don't think that we do
 
02:46:26.389 --> 02:46:26.399 align:start position:0%
that no
 
02:46:26.399 --> 02:46:27.410 align:start position:0%
that no
so

02:46:27.410 --> 02:46:27.420 align:start position:0%

000 annually
 
04:35:46.970 --> 04:35:46.980 align:start position:0%
HB 119 would increase the annual gross

um high risk food or potentially
 
04:36:42.890 --> 04:36:42.900 align:start position:0%

license for that uh for a homestead food
 
04:36:47.160 --> 04:36:49.490 align:start position:0%
license for that uh for a homestead food

follow-up I just I meant the amount like
 
04:36:53.631 --> 04:36:53.641 align:start position:0%
what does
 
04:36:55.730 --> 04:36:55.740 align:start position:0%

04:36:58.070 --> 04:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
dollars thank you yeah
 
04:36:59.390 --> 04:36:59.400 align:start position:0%

any statistics that demonstrate how many
Homestead

04:37:09.429 --> 04:37:09.439 align:start position:0%
Homestead
 
04:37:12.230 --> 04:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
producers would fall into this category
 
04:37:14.631 --> 04:37:14.641 align:start position:0%
how many in other words uh produce over
 
04:37:16.929 --> 04:37:16.939 align:start position:0%
thirty five thousand dollars
 
04:37:21.590 --> 04:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh DHS does not monitor the gross annual
 
04:37:28.551 --> 04:37:28.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:31.551 --> 04:37:31.561 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative Bixby
 
04:37:33.970 --> 04:37:33.980 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question
 
04:37:39.410 --> 04:37:39.420 align:start position:0%
uh so uh has uh have any uh in
 
04:37:42.470 --> 04:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
individuals come forward to you saying
 
04:37:44.150 --> 04:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
that the
 
04:37:47.330 --> 04:37:47.340 align:start position:0%
um impede that the 35 000 limit is an
 
04:37:50.150 --> 04:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
impediment and that uh they need to have
 
04:37:54.051 --> 04:37:54.061 align:start position:0%
a higher limit I believe we had a online
 
04:37:57.170 --> 04:37:57.180 align:start position:0%
testimony submitted that said so to the
 
04:37:57.180 --> 04:38:00.250 align:start position:0%
testimony submitted that said so to the
committee

04:38:00.250 --> 04:38:00.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:04.250 --> 04:38:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:07.269 --> 04:38:07.279 align:start position:0%
so I have a question about
 
04:38:10.609 --> 04:38:10.619 align:start position:0%
the current thirty five thousand dollar
 
04:38:10.619 --> 04:38:11.990 align:start position:0%
the current thirty five thousand dollar
limit

04:38:11.990 --> 04:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
limit
 
04:38:16.789 --> 04:38:16.799 align:start position:0%
now if someone were to you know start
 
04:38:20.209 --> 04:38:20.219 align:start position:0%
making Jam or some product in their
 
04:38:20.219 --> 04:38:21.590 align:start position:0%
making Jam or some product in their
kitchen

04:38:21.590 --> 04:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
kitchen
 
04:38:26.230 --> 04:38:26.240 align:start position:0%
and or on their farm farm
 
04:38:30.830 --> 04:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
excuse me and whatever product that they
 
04:38:30.840 --> 04:38:32.150 align:start position:0%
excuse me and whatever product that they
create

04:38:32.150 --> 04:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
create
 
04:38:34.369 --> 04:38:34.379 align:start position:0%
takes off and
 
04:38:34.379 --> 04:38:35.689 align:start position:0%
takes off and
uh

04:38:35.689 --> 04:38:35.699 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:38:39.109 --> 04:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
you know is is really successful
 
04:38:42.470 --> 04:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
do you believe that the 35
 
04:38:44.869 --> 04:38:44.879 align:start position:0%
000 limit
 
04:38:44.879 --> 04:38:46.730 align:start position:0%
000 limit
um

04:38:46.730 --> 04:38:46.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:50.750 --> 04:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
is is kind of I mean where would it
 
04:38:52.369 --> 04:38:52.379 align:start position:0%
where do you think it would fall that
 
04:38:55.010 --> 04:38:55.020 align:start position:0%
would be somewhere where it would be
 
04:38:58.189 --> 04:38:58.199 align:start position:0%
profitable for the person to then
 
04:39:01.551 --> 04:39:01.561 align:start position:0%
maybe move into a another space a bigger
 
04:39:04.070 --> 04:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
space I mean it seems to me that there's
 
04:39:05.631 --> 04:39:05.641 align:start position:0%
sort of uh
 
04:39:09.289 --> 04:39:09.299 align:start position:0%
a a a point where
 
04:39:12.890 --> 04:39:12.900 align:start position:0%
it is better for them and more
 
04:39:15.890 --> 04:39:15.900 align:start position:0%
profitable for them to then become a
 
04:39:18.051 --> 04:39:18.061 align:start position:0%
real commercial Enterprise
 
04:39:18.061 --> 04:39:19.490 align:start position:0%
real commercial Enterprise
yeah

04:39:19.490 --> 04:39:19.500 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:39:21.890 --> 04:39:21.900 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate the sentiment of the
 
04:39:24.769 --> 04:39:24.779 align:start position:0%
question I I mean I think the free
 
04:39:27.830 --> 04:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
market would kind of determine when you
 
04:39:30.769 --> 04:39:30.779 align:start position:0%
would want to grow your business into a
 
04:39:33.529 --> 04:39:33.539 align:start position:0%
production facility and then you know
 
04:39:37.310 --> 04:39:37.320 align:start position:0%
potentially enter retail marketplaces
 
04:39:40.788 --> 04:39:40.798 align:start position:0%
and things like that so
 
04:39:40.798 --> 04:39:42.230 align:start position:0%
and things like that so
um

04:39:42.230 --> 04:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:42.240 --> 04:39:44.630 align:start position:0%
um
yeah

04:39:44.630 --> 04:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:39:47.750 --> 04:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
okay did I answer your question sort of
 
04:39:47.760 --> 04:39:49.850 align:start position:0%
okay did I answer your question sort of
I

04:39:49.850 --> 04:39:49.860 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:39:49.860 --> 04:39:51.050 align:start position:0%
I
okay

04:39:51.050 --> 04:39:51.060 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:39:54.948 --> 04:39:54.958 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative Morse
 
04:39:56.330 --> 04:39:56.340 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
04:39:58.430 --> 04:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
question so I'm just
 
04:39:58.440 --> 04:39:59.150 align:start position:0%
question so I'm just
um

04:39:59.150 --> 04:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:01.070 --> 04:40:01.080 align:start position:0%
curious if it's a hundred and fifty
 
04:40:04.130 --> 04:40:04.140 align:start position:0%
dollars for the food licensing fee what
 
04:40:06.530 --> 04:40:06.540 align:start position:0%
goes along with getting the license and
 
04:40:09.350 --> 04:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
being inspected that is stopping people
 
04:40:11.208 --> 04:40:11.218 align:start position:0%
from being able to continue making
 
04:40:13.610 --> 04:40:13.620 align:start position:0%
Breads and cookies and jams how does
 
04:40:15.288 --> 04:40:15.298 align:start position:0%
that hurt their business to have that
 
04:40:15.298 --> 04:40:16.810 align:start position:0%
that hurt their business to have that
license

04:40:16.810 --> 04:40:16.820 align:start position:0%
license
 
04:40:19.970 --> 04:40:19.980 align:start position:0%
uh I believe it
 
04:40:24.050 --> 04:40:24.060 align:start position:0%
um supporting hb19 would um
 
04:40:28.130 --> 04:40:28.140 align:start position:0%
help to refocus the regulation to be
 
04:40:30.708 --> 04:40:30.718 align:start position:0%
more based on the risk factor of the
 
04:40:34.070 --> 04:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
food produced rather than the gross
 
04:40:41.868 --> 04:40:41.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:41.878 --> 04:40:43.368 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

04:40:43.368 --> 04:40:43.378 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:40:46.368 --> 04:40:46.378 align:start position:0%
so how does the license hurt their
 
04:40:46.378 --> 04:40:47.750 align:start position:0%
so how does the license hurt their
business

04:40:47.750 --> 04:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
business
 
04:40:50.750 --> 04:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
I mean what
 
04:40:53.270 --> 04:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
what hurts or helps the business is
 
04:40:56.690 --> 04:40:56.700 align:start position:0%
dependent on that individual Homestead
 
04:41:00.230 --> 04:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:02.270 --> 04:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
representative detsee
 
04:41:04.850 --> 04:41:04.860 align:start position:0%
uh yes what was the impetus for this
 
04:41:04.860 --> 04:41:05.570 align:start position:0%
uh yes what was the impetus for this
bill

04:41:05.570 --> 04:41:05.580 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:41:07.430 --> 04:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
um how was it brought forward was it a
 
04:41:10.970 --> 04:41:10.980 align:start position:0%
constituent or a a group that was
 
04:41:14.330 --> 04:41:14.340 align:start position:0%
concerned about the existing law yeah it
 
04:41:16.490 --> 04:41:16.500 align:start position:0%
was brought forward by a constituent
 
04:41:19.250 --> 04:41:19.260 align:start position:0%
that's going to offer testimony
 
04:41:23.170 --> 04:41:23.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:26.090 --> 04:41:26.100 align:start position:0%
representative Howard
 
04:41:28.010 --> 04:41:28.020 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman
 
04:41:31.670 --> 04:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
um if if you're if the licensing is
 
04:41:34.850 --> 04:41:34.860 align:start position:0%
are the regulations are based on the um
 
04:41:37.010 --> 04:41:37.020 align:start position:0%
the riskiness of the food then why are
 
04:41:39.110 --> 04:41:39.120 align:start position:0%
we talking about the level of income
 
04:41:42.470 --> 04:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
from the business as a determining
 
04:41:44.750 --> 04:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
Factor that's a really good question
 
04:41:47.030 --> 04:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
because it's in the statute and it's
 
04:41:49.030 --> 04:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
said that it's capped at a certain
 
04:41:54.470 --> 04:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
arbitrary amount so we want to raise it
 
04:41:56.628 --> 04:41:56.638 align:start position:0%
representative Howard
 
04:42:00.590 --> 04:42:00.600 align:start position:0%
so if um so does are you suggesting that
 
04:42:02.990 --> 04:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
the regulation should be along the lines
 
04:42:04.730 --> 04:42:04.740 align:start position:0%
of what kind of food they produce rather
 
04:42:06.948 --> 04:42:06.958 align:start position:0%
than how much of it they produce I mean
 
04:42:09.530 --> 04:42:09.540 align:start position:0%
in my opinion that would be you know
 
04:42:11.868 --> 04:42:11.878 align:start position:0%
more helpful but that's just my personal
 
04:42:11.878 --> 04:42:15.410 align:start position:0%
more helpful but that's just my personal
opinion

04:42:15.410 --> 04:42:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:17.030 --> 04:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
04:42:18.948 --> 04:42:18.958 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby
 
04:42:20.868 --> 04:42:20.878 align:start position:0%
so um
 
04:42:23.930 --> 04:42:23.940 align:start position:0%
is there a reason for a cap at all
 
04:42:26.570 --> 04:42:26.580 align:start position:0%
uh I don't think so so it would be
 
04:42:28.788 --> 04:42:28.798 align:start position:0%
actually if a business if someone were
 
04:42:31.250 --> 04:42:31.260 align:start position:0%
making a million dollars worth of food
 
04:42:31.260 --> 04:42:32.930 align:start position:0%
making a million dollars worth of food
uh

04:42:32.930 --> 04:42:32.940 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:42:35.448 --> 04:42:35.458 align:start position:0%
in an uninspected home kitchen that
 
04:42:37.788 --> 04:42:37.798 align:start position:0%
would be just fine
 
04:42:40.730 --> 04:42:40.740 align:start position:0%
there would be other regulatory bodies
 
04:42:42.770 --> 04:42:42.780 align:start position:0%
that would come into place if you had
 
04:42:45.170 --> 04:42:45.180 align:start position:0%
that you know amount of income coming in
 
04:42:48.490 --> 04:42:48.500 align:start position:0%
and you would also have organically
 
04:42:51.170 --> 04:42:51.180 align:start position:0%
transitioned into the retail market and
 
04:42:53.150 --> 04:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
having a production facility and things
 
04:42:56.690 --> 04:42:56.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:58.610 --> 04:42:58.620 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome any other
 
04:43:00.590 --> 04:43:00.600 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
04:43:03.530 --> 04:43:03.540 align:start position:0%
representative NAB thank you madam chair
 
04:43:06.350 --> 04:43:06.360 align:start position:0%
so is the 70 000 is there any basis for
 
04:43:07.970 --> 04:43:07.980 align:start position:0%
that number or are you just trying to
 
04:43:09.288 --> 04:43:09.298 align:start position:0%
expand the number
 
04:43:11.448 --> 04:43:11.458 align:start position:0%
is there any data around Who falls into
 
04:43:14.270 --> 04:43:14.280 align:start position:0%
the 35 000 to 70 000
 
04:43:16.850 --> 04:43:16.860 align:start position:0%
or is it just an effort to loosen
 
04:43:19.070 --> 04:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
regulations I think it's an effort to
 
04:43:22.490 --> 04:43:22.500 align:start position:0%
heighten the cap on the gross annual
 
04:43:27.610 --> 04:43:27.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:29.930 --> 04:43:29.940 align:start position:0%
representative Creighton thank you ma'am
 
04:43:31.910 --> 04:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and your
 
04:43:35.448 --> 04:43:35.458 align:start position:0%
idea I've got a question regarding what
 
04:43:38.570 --> 04:43:38.580 align:start position:0%
is it an RSA that what is defined as a
 
04:43:39.830 --> 04:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
hazardous food
 
04:43:42.650 --> 04:43:42.660 align:start position:0%
versus on hazardous food is that how is
 
04:43:46.368 --> 04:43:46.378 align:start position:0%
that defined uh it's defined in the you
 
04:43:46.378 --> 04:43:47.050 align:start position:0%
that defined uh it's defined in the you
know

04:43:47.050 --> 04:43:47.060 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:43:50.930 --> 04:43:50.940 align:start position:0%
HHS has like uh seven or eight page
 
04:43:52.970 --> 04:43:52.980 align:start position:0%
document that outlines all the
 
04:43:56.090 --> 04:43:56.100 align:start position:0%
regulations for what's uh low risk and
 
04:43:58.490 --> 04:43:58.500 align:start position:0%
what's potentially hazardous okay thank
 
04:44:01.070 --> 04:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
you you're welcome
 
04:44:03.470 --> 04:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
04:44:05.510 --> 04:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
04:44:05.520 --> 04:44:06.830 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
testimony

04:44:06.830 --> 04:44:06.840 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
04:44:09.230 --> 04:44:09.240 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to call
 
04:44:14.208 --> 04:44:14.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:16.250 --> 04:44:16.260 align:start position:0%
thank you and for joining us this
 
04:44:17.690 --> 04:44:17.700 align:start position:0%
afternoon Mr thank you for having me
 
04:44:20.270 --> 04:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
again uh just to refresh your guys's
 
04:44:22.670 --> 04:44:22.680 align:start position:0%
memory uh having been here before I
 
04:44:24.050 --> 04:44:24.060 align:start position:0%
represent the Free State Food Network
 
04:44:27.170 --> 04:44:27.180 align:start position:0%
which is about 55 people that are
 
04:44:28.850 --> 04:44:28.860 align:start position:0%
Professionals in the food industry in
 
04:44:30.110 --> 04:44:30.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so they're making money
 
04:44:33.110 --> 04:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
off of food uh a lot of them are farmers
 
04:44:35.208 --> 04:44:35.218 align:start position:0%
homesteaders and uh they're very
 
04:44:38.868 --> 04:44:38.878 align:start position:0%
interested in this bill I also have uh
 
04:44:40.850 --> 04:44:40.860 align:start position:0%
more than a decade of experience working
 
04:44:43.310 --> 04:44:43.320 align:start position:0%
in restaurants and I grew up on a farm
 
04:44:45.650 --> 04:44:45.660 align:start position:0%
so I'm acutely aware and hopefully I can
 
04:44:47.150 --> 04:44:47.160 align:start position:0%
answer some of the questions that you
 
04:44:49.250 --> 04:44:49.260 align:start position:0%
asked the previous person giving
 
04:44:51.410 --> 04:44:51.420 align:start position:0%
testimony and provide a bit more context
 
04:44:53.030 --> 04:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
to it and actually I'd like to focus
 
04:44:55.128 --> 04:44:55.138 align:start position:0%
more on your questions than uh the
 
04:44:56.448 --> 04:44:56.458 align:start position:0%
testimony that I was really going to
 
04:44:56.458 --> 04:44:57.288 align:start position:0%
testimony that I was really going to
give

04:44:57.288 --> 04:44:57.298 align:start position:0%
give
 
04:45:01.448 --> 04:45:01.458 align:start position:0%
um I believe it was asked uh why the 70k
 
04:45:04.550 --> 04:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh big reason for that is the previous
 
04:45:06.650 --> 04:45:06.660 align:start position:0%
number was too small to remain
 
04:45:06.660 --> 04:45:07.970 align:start position:0%
number was too small to remain
competitive

04:45:07.970 --> 04:45:07.980 align:start position:0%
competitive
 
04:45:10.610 --> 04:45:10.620 align:start position:0%
um if you ask yourself uh think about
 
04:45:12.350 --> 04:45:12.360 align:start position:0%
your own personal salaries in your life
 
04:45:14.448 --> 04:45:14.458 align:start position:0%
some of you may be retired I'm not sure
 
04:45:18.110 --> 04:45:18.120 align:start position:0%
but uh is is 70k enough for you to
 
04:45:19.970 --> 04:45:19.980 align:start position:0%
operate a business and have all this
 
04:45:24.050 --> 04:45:24.060 align:start position:0%
overhead uh for Revenue because 70k uh
 
04:45:25.788 --> 04:45:25.798 align:start position:0%
is not going to be taking into account
 
04:45:27.050 --> 04:45:27.060 align:start position:0%
all that
 
04:45:30.948 --> 04:45:30.958 align:start position:0%
we need to look at uh the previous uh
 
04:45:33.830 --> 04:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
legislative sessions uh did increase the
 
04:45:36.948 --> 04:45:36.958 align:start position:0%
dollar amount once before but the amount
 
04:45:38.930 --> 04:45:38.940 align:start position:0%
was too small to remain competitive with
 
04:45:42.590 --> 04:45:42.600 align:start position:0%
the rising cost of Supply Goods uh
 
04:45:45.890 --> 04:45:45.900 align:start position:0%
supply chain issues Transportation uh
 
04:45:49.070 --> 04:45:49.080 align:start position:0%
you know raw ingredient costs and just
 
04:45:51.830 --> 04:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
the uh the inflation of the dollar
 
04:45:54.590 --> 04:45:54.600 align:start position:0%
uh so in order to remain competitive we
 
04:45:57.050 --> 04:45:57.060 align:start position:0%
need to raise this amount uh or find
 
04:45:59.990 --> 04:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
another way to tie it to the rising cost
 
04:46:01.788 --> 04:46:01.798 align:start position:0%
of goods
 
04:46:01.798 --> 04:46:02.868 align:start position:0%
of goods
um

04:46:02.868 --> 04:46:02.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:46:05.208 --> 04:46:05.218 align:start position:0%
there was a questionably from over here
 
04:46:08.390 --> 04:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
about uh what fees are and and I think
 
04:46:10.490 --> 04:46:10.500 align:start position:0%
what we're really looking at is it's not
 
04:46:13.010 --> 04:46:13.020 align:start position:0%
so much the actual licensed dollar
 
04:46:15.590 --> 04:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
amount that is the burden uh it's the
 
04:46:17.448 --> 04:46:17.458 align:start position:0%
high amounts of red tape so if you look
 
04:46:22.250 --> 04:46:22.260 align:start position:0%
at the rsas uh if you uh are making over
 
04:46:24.170 --> 04:46:24.180 align:start position:0%
a certain amount and no longer fall into
 
04:46:26.230 --> 04:46:26.240 align:start position:0%
the homesteading
 
04:46:29.030 --> 04:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
operations then you're going to need to
 
04:46:31.368 --> 04:46:31.378 align:start position:0%
have uh in your kitchen you need to have
 
04:46:33.230 --> 04:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
you can't just have a normal sink you
 
04:46:35.690 --> 04:46:35.700 align:start position:0%
need to have a three base sink and a
 
04:46:38.570 --> 04:46:38.580 align:start position:0%
hand wash sink you need to have many
 
04:46:41.930 --> 04:46:41.940 align:start position:0%
more inspections of your facilities uh
 
04:46:44.990 --> 04:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
based around fire code uh based around
 
04:46:47.208 --> 04:46:47.218 align:start position:0%
just just there's so many different
 
04:46:49.490 --> 04:46:49.500 align:start position:0%
tests you need to have and different uh
 
04:46:51.230 --> 04:46:51.240 align:start position:0%
agencies that need to come in and and
 
04:46:53.390 --> 04:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
check you out including like annual
 
04:46:55.788 --> 04:46:55.798 align:start position:0%
inspections so
 
04:46:58.970 --> 04:46:58.980 align:start position:0%
uh it's really the licensing fee is not
 
04:47:01.368 --> 04:47:01.378 align:start position:0%
the burden there it's the mass amount of
 
04:47:03.590 --> 04:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
red tape that needs to happen instead
 
04:47:07.430 --> 04:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
and uh I do think we need to be focusing
 
04:47:10.990 --> 04:47:11.000 align:start position:0%
on expanding these Homestead operations
 
04:47:14.208 --> 04:47:14.218 align:start position:0%
uh in New Hampshire uh what we've been
 
04:47:16.970 --> 04:47:16.980 align:start position:0%
seeing uh the past few years is a lot of
 
04:47:19.430 --> 04:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
supply chain issues and I think that
 
04:47:21.770 --> 04:47:21.780 align:start position:0%
focusing on our local economy by
 
04:47:24.590 --> 04:47:24.600 align:start position:0%
expanding these things and allowing our
 
04:47:26.930 --> 04:47:26.940 align:start position:0%
uh neighbors to do business with each
 
04:47:30.170 --> 04:47:30.180 align:start position:0%
other more easier and smoother is going
 
04:47:31.368 --> 04:47:31.378 align:start position:0%
to help out a lot with that so when
 
04:47:32.690 --> 04:47:32.700 align:start position:0%
you're going to the grocery store right
 
04:47:36.050 --> 04:47:36.060 align:start position:0%
now and you're seeing that eggs are uh
 
04:47:37.850 --> 04:47:37.860 align:start position:0%
however many dollars a dozen you're
 
04:47:39.288 --> 04:47:39.298 align:start position:0%
spending right now
 
04:47:40.788 --> 04:47:40.798 align:start position:0%
um I buy mine commercially as a
 
04:47:42.650 --> 04:47:42.660 align:start position:0%
restaurant owner and I'm paying 40 cents
 
04:47:44.930 --> 04:47:44.940 align:start position:0%
an egg when it used to be 10 12 cents an
 
04:47:44.940 --> 04:47:46.550 align:start position:0%
an egg when it used to be 10 12 cents an
egg

04:47:46.550 --> 04:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
egg
 
04:47:49.310 --> 04:47:49.320 align:start position:0%
by buying locally and using smaller
 
04:47:51.890 --> 04:47:51.900 align:start position:0%
local farms I'm actually that I'm
 
04:47:54.050 --> 04:47:54.060 align:start position:0%
actually uh
 
04:47:56.510 --> 04:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
insulating myself against these issues
 
04:47:58.788 --> 04:47:58.798 align:start position:0%
that are uh affecting the entire country
 
04:48:01.670 --> 04:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh so I think that we need to be moving
 
04:48:03.470 --> 04:48:03.480 align:start position:0%
in that kind of Direction and by
 
04:48:06.470 --> 04:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
expanding up to the 70k it's going to
 
04:48:08.628 --> 04:48:08.638 align:start position:0%
allow more of these operations to grow
 
04:48:11.090 --> 04:48:11.100 align:start position:0%
more of them to be competitive with the
 
04:48:13.190 --> 04:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
bigger corporations that currently are
 
04:48:15.590 --> 04:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
controlling a lot of our food chain
 
04:48:18.288 --> 04:48:18.298 align:start position:0%
thank you so I have a question and I
 
04:48:19.850 --> 04:48:19.860 align:start position:0%
think I can articulate my question
 
04:48:21.410 --> 04:48:21.420 align:start position:0%
better this time
 
04:48:23.810 --> 04:48:23.820 align:start position:0%
with regard to hitting the seventy
 
04:48:26.628 --> 04:48:26.638 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar threshold yes would the
 
04:48:28.490 --> 04:48:28.500 align:start position:0%
homestead person
 
04:48:31.190 --> 04:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
then do you feel be in a better position
 
04:48:34.368 --> 04:48:34.378 align:start position:0%
financially to move to a situation where
 
04:48:36.708 --> 04:48:36.718 align:start position:0%
they can afford to get a three-base sink
 
04:48:39.310 --> 04:48:39.320 align:start position:0%
and all the other things that are needed
 
04:48:43.368 --> 04:48:43.378 align:start position:0%
for the bigger operation that they have
 
04:48:45.650 --> 04:48:45.660 align:start position:0%
yeah I I think that that would put them
 
04:48:47.270 --> 04:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
in a much better position because I do
 
04:48:49.788 --> 04:48:49.798 align:start position:0%
think a lot of them would love to grow
 
04:48:53.270 --> 04:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
into a much larger size and and get into
 
04:48:56.330 --> 04:48:56.340 align:start position:0%
like uh those bigger licenses and in
 
04:48:57.770 --> 04:48:57.780 align:start position:0%
order to do that they can't just be
 
04:49:00.170 --> 04:49:00.180 align:start position:0%
scraping by on the smallest dollar
 
04:49:01.788 --> 04:49:01.798 align:start position:0%
amount that we've already given them
 
04:49:04.190 --> 04:49:04.200 align:start position:0%
they need to be able to invest in
 
04:49:07.850 --> 04:49:07.860 align:start position:0%
themselves and grow and uh they do have
 
04:49:07.860 --> 04:49:08.570 align:start position:0%
themselves and grow and uh they do have
um

04:49:08.570 --> 04:49:08.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:11.270 --> 04:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
a desire for some inspections and they
 
04:49:13.970 --> 04:49:13.980 align:start position:0%
do have a desire for uh increased
 
04:49:15.410 --> 04:49:15.420 align:start position:0%
testing and that kind of thing as they
 
04:49:17.628 --> 04:49:17.638 align:start position:0%
grow because as they grow they they're
 
04:49:19.788 --> 04:49:19.798 align:start position:0%
going to want to have employees and
 
04:49:21.170 --> 04:49:21.180 align:start position:0%
they're going to want to delegate the
 
04:49:23.448 --> 04:49:23.458 align:start position:0%
different tasks of their operation and
 
04:49:23.458 --> 04:49:24.170 align:start position:0%
different tasks of their operation and
um

04:49:24.170 --> 04:49:24.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:26.030 --> 04:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
by uh
 
04:49:27.770 --> 04:49:27.780 align:start position:0%
yeah so through so through that growth
 
04:49:30.470 --> 04:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
they're going to be looking for uh these
 
04:49:31.788 --> 04:49:31.798 align:start position:0%
inspections and that kind of thing so
 
04:49:33.350 --> 04:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
naturally they're going to be looking
 
04:49:35.868 --> 04:49:35.878 align:start position:0%
out for safety thank you any questions
 
04:49:38.208 --> 04:49:38.218 align:start position:0%
um representative Bixby yeah so
 
04:49:41.750 --> 04:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
um under the foods the the foods uh the
 
04:49:44.090 --> 04:49:44.100 align:start position:0%
homestead food exemption what are the
 
04:49:46.730 --> 04:49:46.740 align:start position:0%
options for where a person can do their
 
04:49:46.740 --> 04:49:48.670 align:start position:0%
options for where a person can do their
marketing

04:49:48.670 --> 04:49:48.680 align:start position:0%
marketing
 
04:49:51.350 --> 04:49:51.360 align:start position:0%
where can a person sell if they're doing
 
04:49:53.930 --> 04:49:53.940 align:start position:0%
if they're under this exemption uh
 
04:49:56.810 --> 04:49:56.820 align:start position:0%
currently I if correct me if I'm wrong
 
04:49:58.550 --> 04:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
but I believe it's just out of their
 
04:50:00.650 --> 04:50:00.660 align:start position:0%
home or at farmers markets and farmer
 
04:50:05.448 --> 04:50:05.458 align:start position:0%
stands okay and uh do those Outlets
 
04:50:05.458 --> 04:50:08.448 align:start position:0%
stands okay and uh do those Outlets
provide

04:50:08.448 --> 04:50:08.458 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:10.670 --> 04:50:10.680 align:start position:0%
are people running up against being able
 
04:50:13.010 --> 04:50:13.020 align:start position:0%
to to sell thirty five thousand dollars
 
04:50:14.628 --> 04:50:14.638 align:start position:0%
worth of
 
04:50:17.270 --> 04:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
um product at those venues
 
04:50:19.788 --> 04:50:19.798 align:start position:0%
yeah I do but I do believe they are and
 
04:50:22.310 --> 04:50:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh I do believe that
 
04:50:24.410 --> 04:50:24.420 align:start position:0%
um by limiting the dollar amount you're
 
04:50:26.208 --> 04:50:26.218 align:start position:0%
limiting what products they're able to
 
04:50:28.610 --> 04:50:28.620 align:start position:0%
sell as well like the farmer that has
 
04:50:31.070 --> 04:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
the uh cooler uh at the end of their
 
04:50:33.050 --> 04:50:33.060 align:start position:0%
driveway that's just selling eggs a
 
04:50:35.330 --> 04:50:35.340 align:start position:0%
dozen at a time uh is going to take a
 
04:50:36.708 --> 04:50:36.718 align:start position:0%
lot longer to hit that dollar amount
 
04:50:39.170 --> 04:50:39.180 align:start position:0%
than somebody that for example wants to
 
04:50:42.770 --> 04:50:42.780 align:start position:0%
sell entire uh cows where you would uh
 
04:50:45.530 --> 04:50:45.540 align:start position:0%
raise a cow up and sell the entire cow
 
04:50:47.270 --> 04:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
to somebody and you'll you'll send it to
 
04:50:48.288 --> 04:50:48.298 align:start position:0%
get slaughtered and butchered and
 
04:50:48.298 --> 04:50:49.368 align:start position:0%
get slaughtered and butchered and
everything

04:50:49.368 --> 04:50:49.378 align:start position:0%
everything
 
04:50:51.830 --> 04:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
um so you're really uh limiting their
 
04:50:54.050 --> 04:50:54.060 align:start position:0%
ability to be competitive with the major
 
04:50:54.060 --> 04:50:56.530 align:start position:0%
ability to be competitive with the major
Farms

04:50:56.530 --> 04:50:56.540 align:start position:0%
Farms
 
04:51:01.250 --> 04:51:01.260 align:start position:0%
so does uh the sale of fine of livestock
 
04:51:03.590 --> 04:51:03.600 align:start position:0%
fall under this exemption
 
04:51:07.010 --> 04:51:07.020 align:start position:0%
uh the sale of livestock know that that
 
04:51:09.110 --> 04:51:09.120 align:start position:0%
would not be uh the sort of food but I'm
 
04:51:11.150 --> 04:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
just using that as as a general example
 
04:51:14.690 --> 04:51:14.700 align:start position:0%
of uh by that they can't go for a bigger
 
04:51:17.150 --> 04:51:17.160 align:start position:0%
ticketed items um with their Farm
 
04:51:19.490 --> 04:51:19.500 align:start position:0%
operations or or selling food and more
 
04:51:22.368 --> 04:51:22.378 align:start position:0%
bulk out of there or anything like that
 
04:51:24.948 --> 04:51:24.958 align:start position:0%
representative Haskins thank you for
 
04:51:27.470 --> 04:51:27.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question thank you Mr Ness I'm
 
04:51:29.990 --> 04:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
just trying to understand this because
 
04:51:32.868 --> 04:51:32.878 align:start position:0%
I'm not very familiar with it frankly
 
04:51:35.030 --> 04:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
um and I'm a huge proponent of
 
04:51:38.628 --> 04:51:38.638 align:start position:0%
home-cooked food clean food I try to get
 
04:51:41.350 --> 04:51:41.360 align:start position:0%
all my family members engaged in that
 
04:51:44.990 --> 04:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
activity because so few people seem to
 
04:51:47.510 --> 04:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
cook anymore but at any rate I'm trying
 
04:51:50.170 --> 04:51:50.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:54.770 --> 04:51:54.780 align:start position:0%
why food safety and home food production
 
04:51:57.770 --> 04:51:57.780 align:start position:0%
should be oppositional in some way
 
04:51:59.868 --> 04:51:59.878 align:start position:0%
because I think inspections are a good
 
04:52:02.810 --> 04:52:02.820 align:start position:0%
thing I think home-cooked food and safe
 
04:52:05.448 --> 04:52:05.458 align:start position:0%
food should be one in the same but if
 
04:52:07.490 --> 04:52:07.500 align:start position:0%
somebody's going to be doing a lot more
 
04:52:10.910 --> 04:52:10.920 align:start position:0%
then I have a greater sense that more
 
04:52:12.590 --> 04:52:12.600 align:start position:0%
inspections will be good and I haven't
 
04:52:15.050 --> 04:52:15.060 align:start position:0%
seen a I haven't heard the huge
 
04:52:17.810 --> 04:52:17.820 align:start position:0%
prohibition for licensing other than 150
 
04:52:20.690 --> 04:52:20.700 align:start position:0%
for the fee well I I think
 
04:52:20.700 --> 04:52:21.410 align:start position:0%
for the fee well I I think
um

04:52:21.410 --> 04:52:21.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:52:24.050 --> 04:52:24.060 align:start position:0%
when you're thinking about
 
04:52:24.060 --> 04:52:25.610 align:start position:0%
when you're thinking about
um

04:52:25.610 --> 04:52:25.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:52:28.190 --> 04:52:28.200 align:start position:0%
why we have these inspections and that
 
04:52:30.830 --> 04:52:30.840 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing I think uh one way to
 
04:52:32.208 --> 04:52:32.218 align:start position:0%
One Direction I think that you could
 
04:52:35.208 --> 04:52:35.218 align:start position:0%
Ponder is how often does your own
 
04:52:37.788 --> 04:52:37.798 align:start position:0%
personal kitchen at home get inspected
 
04:52:40.788 --> 04:52:40.798 align:start position:0%
and uh never right you're you're never
 
04:52:42.590 --> 04:52:42.600 align:start position:0%
bringing somebody in and yet you're not
 
04:52:44.390 --> 04:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
making yourself sick now we're taking
 
04:52:47.030 --> 04:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
people that are experts at making these
 
04:52:48.708 --> 04:52:48.718 align:start position:0%
food and they're trying to make a profit
 
04:52:52.368 --> 04:52:52.378 align:start position:0%
and they they so they have a huge burden
 
04:52:55.250 --> 04:52:55.260 align:start position:0%
upon themselves to if they want to make
 
04:52:58.610 --> 04:52:58.620 align:start position:0%
that money to operate safely and in a
 
04:53:00.890 --> 04:53:00.900 align:start position:0%
way that's not going to get there uh
 
04:53:03.770 --> 04:53:03.780 align:start position:0%
they're people sick follow-up follow-up
 
04:53:06.410 --> 04:53:06.420 align:start position:0%
I I think I appreciate that but if I'm
 
04:53:08.270 --> 04:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
cooking food for my family I'm
 
04:53:10.368 --> 04:53:10.378 align:start position:0%
responsible for it I'm not giving it to
 
04:53:11.810 --> 04:53:11.820 align:start position:0%
other people and taking that
 
04:53:14.150 --> 04:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
responsibility on so I think there's an
 
04:53:17.208 --> 04:53:17.218 align:start position:0%
added uh requirement if I'm going to
 
04:53:19.788 --> 04:53:19.798 align:start position:0%
feed it to anyone
 
04:53:21.770 --> 04:53:21.780 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:53:23.390 --> 04:53:23.400 align:start position:0%
do you have a question representative
 
04:53:23.400 --> 04:53:26.510 align:start position:0%
do you have a question representative
verbal

04:53:26.510 --> 04:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:28.368 --> 04:53:28.378 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you madam chair uh thank you
 
04:53:31.128 --> 04:53:31.138 align:start position:0%
for coming in uh Mr NASA I I appreciate
 
04:53:32.750 --> 04:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
it uh you're in the food service
 
04:53:35.208 --> 04:53:35.218 align:start position:0%
industry is that correct yes I uh own a
 
04:53:36.890 --> 04:53:36.900 align:start position:0%
restaurant thank you
 
04:53:39.530 --> 04:53:39.540 align:start position:0%
what would you estimate the inflation
 
04:53:41.930 --> 04:53:41.940 align:start position:0%
rate for your raw materials just your
 
04:53:44.690 --> 04:53:44.700 align:start position:0%
your food raw materials has been over
 
04:53:46.430 --> 04:53:46.440 align:start position:0%
the last say one or two years if you
 
04:53:48.350 --> 04:53:48.360 align:start position:0%
could give me a time frame and what you
 
04:53:50.448 --> 04:53:50.458 align:start position:0%
would estimate the inflation on on those
 
04:53:53.930 --> 04:53:53.940 align:start position:0%
goods has been to your business uh
 
04:53:56.030 --> 04:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
like as a percent well it's so it's
 
04:53:58.490 --> 04:53:58.500 align:start position:0%
really depends on uh
 
04:54:00.470 --> 04:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
the raw ingredient vegetables have
 
04:54:02.390 --> 04:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
remain pretty steady you guys have seen
 
04:54:05.090 --> 04:54:05.100 align:start position:0%
eggs have quadrupled and priced proteins
 
04:54:08.090 --> 04:54:08.100 align:start position:0%
have mostly doubled in price
 
04:54:12.350 --> 04:54:12.360 align:start position:0%
um I am thankful that uh I try to be
 
04:54:14.150 --> 04:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
farm to table as much as I possibly can
 
04:54:16.070 --> 04:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
and work out special deals with Farmers
 
04:54:19.490 --> 04:54:19.500 align:start position:0%
to keep my numbers down but uh yeah a
 
04:54:21.170 --> 04:54:21.180 align:start position:0%
lot a lot of these raw ingredients
 
04:54:23.030 --> 04:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
people are seeing doubling quadrupling
 
04:54:25.788 --> 04:54:25.798 align:start position:0%
of prices and I've I've even seen uh
 
04:54:27.050 --> 04:54:27.060 align:start position:0%
when there have been real supply chain
 
04:54:29.810 --> 04:54:29.820 align:start position:0%
issues where um
 
04:54:31.850 --> 04:54:31.860 align:start position:0%
uh before I owned I've only had my
 
04:54:34.550 --> 04:54:34.560 align:start position:0%
restaurant that I currently own about a
 
04:54:37.250 --> 04:54:37.260 align:start position:0%
year now and before that I was working
 
04:54:40.670 --> 04:54:40.680 align:start position:0%
uh I ran uh 12 kitchens four sororities
 
04:54:42.230 --> 04:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
and fraternities so I was dealing with
 
04:54:44.448 --> 04:54:44.458 align:start position:0%
feeding a lot of people and overseeing a
 
04:54:46.390 --> 04:54:46.400 align:start position:0%
lot of different chefs and at that time
 
04:54:49.070 --> 04:54:49.080 align:start position:0%
uh supply chain issues were affecting us
 
04:54:51.650 --> 04:54:51.660 align:start position:0%
so bad that we were seeing
 
04:54:55.250 --> 04:54:55.260 align:start position:0%
um cost of goods uh for example on
 
04:54:57.590 --> 04:54:57.600 align:start position:0%
chicken uh I would have to go to the
 
04:54:59.208 --> 04:54:59.218 align:start position:0%
grocery store and buy chicken because
 
04:55:02.990 --> 04:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
the price was going up so fast from week
 
04:55:06.110 --> 04:55:06.120 align:start position:0%
to week that uh the grocery store took
 
04:55:08.030 --> 04:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
longer to update their pricing and I
 
04:55:09.948 --> 04:55:09.958 align:start position:0%
could save money that way so that the
 
04:55:12.770 --> 04:55:12.780 align:start position:0%
pricing is extremely dramatic and uh
 
04:55:15.288 --> 04:55:15.298 align:start position:0%
changes a lot but uh yeah sometimes
 
04:55:17.510 --> 04:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
double the quadruple in the past three
 
04:55:19.190 --> 04:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
years I'd say follow up Madam chair
 
04:55:21.288 --> 04:55:21.298 align:start position:0%
follow up yeah thank you for the answer
 
04:55:23.510 --> 04:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
I I know it's very tough to to get a
 
04:55:24.650 --> 04:55:24.660 align:start position:0%
handle on
 
04:55:26.448 --> 04:55:26.458 align:start position:0%
um you know the the reason for my
 
04:55:29.530 --> 04:55:29.540 align:start position:0%
question is you know we're looking at
 
04:55:33.410 --> 04:55:33.420 align:start position:0%
increasing the the amount in sales and I
 
04:55:35.448 --> 04:55:35.458 align:start position:0%
I certainly am not going to argue with
 
04:55:37.550 --> 04:55:37.560 align:start position:0%
the the numbers that you gave us on the
 
04:55:40.788 --> 04:55:40.798 align:start position:0%
cost of foodstuffs going up and so I can
 
04:55:43.190 --> 04:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
imagine that that inflationary pressure
 
04:55:46.610 --> 04:55:46.620 align:start position:0%
is rapidly eating into the volume of
 
04:55:49.128 --> 04:55:49.138 align:start position:0%
material that an independent can sell
 
04:55:51.948 --> 04:55:51.958 align:start position:0%
before they before they hit that
 
04:55:53.930 --> 04:55:53.940 align:start position:0%
um it would it would break my heart to
 
04:55:56.030 --> 04:55:56.040 align:start position:0%
to have to see all the people that have
 
04:55:57.590 --> 04:55:57.600 align:start position:0%
come out today to have to keep coming
 
04:56:00.410 --> 04:56:00.420 align:start position:0%
back every couple of years to readjust
 
04:56:03.050 --> 04:56:03.060 align:start position:0%
um readjust this number so I guess my my
 
04:56:04.490 --> 04:56:04.500 align:start position:0%
question and and you don't have to
 
04:56:06.890 --> 04:56:06.900 align:start position:0%
answer it today but I would certainly
 
04:56:09.288 --> 04:56:09.298 align:start position:0%
love an email to the committee if you
 
04:56:11.090 --> 04:56:11.100 align:start position:0%
don't want to answer today is what what
 
04:56:13.070 --> 04:56:13.080 align:start position:0%
sort of what sort of mechanism would you
 
04:56:14.930 --> 04:56:14.940 align:start position:0%
recommend we put in place
 
04:56:17.690 --> 04:56:17.700 align:start position:0%
instead of a stagnant number so that we
 
04:56:19.730 --> 04:56:19.740 align:start position:0%
don't have to revisit this every couple
 
04:56:22.190 --> 04:56:22.200 align:start position:0%
of years as Market forces sort of force
 
04:56:24.110 --> 04:56:24.120 align:start position:0%
our hand
 
04:56:25.670 --> 04:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean that's a tough question
 
04:56:27.650 --> 04:56:27.660 align:start position:0%
because you could either tie it to some
 
04:56:29.448 --> 04:56:29.458 align:start position:0%
other value
 
04:56:32.208 --> 04:56:32.218 align:start position:0%
um or I mean if you if you go completely
 
04:56:35.150 --> 04:56:35.160 align:start position:0%
outside the system of tying their it to
 
04:56:37.970 --> 04:56:37.980 align:start position:0%
a dollar amount of Revenue anyway uh you
 
04:56:39.590 --> 04:56:39.600 align:start position:0%
could you could always
 
04:56:39.600 --> 04:56:40.610 align:start position:0%
could you could always
um

04:56:40.610 --> 04:56:40.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:42.530 --> 04:56:42.540 align:start position:0%
provided a completely different license
 
04:56:45.708 --> 04:56:45.718 align:start position:0%
that just tells the consumer that these
 
04:56:47.330 --> 04:56:47.340 align:start position:0%
Homestead operations aren't being
 
04:56:49.550 --> 04:56:49.560 align:start position:0%
regulated in the same ways and let the
 
04:56:52.070 --> 04:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
let the market decide on its own thank
 
04:56:53.510 --> 04:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr Nas appreciate it thank you madam
 
04:56:55.970 --> 04:56:55.980 align:start position:0%
chair thank you was there a question
 
04:56:57.050 --> 04:56:57.060 align:start position:0%
over here
 
04:57:02.150 --> 04:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:04.310 --> 04:57:04.320 align:start position:0%
so my question is on the 35
 
04:57:06.350 --> 04:57:06.360 align:start position:0%
000 do you have any idea when that was
 
04:57:09.128 --> 04:57:09.138 align:start position:0%
put in that RSA
 
04:57:11.990 --> 04:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh the RSA itself we're bumping it up to
 
04:57:14.570 --> 04:57:14.580 align:start position:0%
35 000. yeah when it when it became 35
 
04:57:16.850 --> 04:57:16.860 align:start position:0%
000 like what the date of that was I
 
04:57:19.250 --> 04:57:19.260 align:start position:0%
believe it was within the past two years
 
04:57:22.610 --> 04:57:22.620 align:start position:0%
and I think it was 22 000 before that or
 
04:57:25.010 --> 04:57:25.020 align:start position:0%
20 000. okay
 
04:57:27.830 --> 04:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
so I agree with the form oh so follow-up
 
04:57:29.750 --> 04:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up so I agree with what the
 
04:57:33.110 --> 04:57:33.120 align:start position:0%
former um representative stated as well
 
04:57:34.670 --> 04:57:34.680 align:start position:0%
I mean it's you know we're going to have
 
04:57:36.890 --> 04:57:36.900 align:start position:0%
to keep pushing it forward but
 
04:57:38.390 --> 04:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
um pretty much everything costs double I
 
04:57:40.490 --> 04:57:40.500 align:start position:0%
come from a I had a restaurant my
 
04:57:42.110 --> 04:57:42.120 align:start position:0%
brother has six restaurants that were
 
04:57:44.390 --> 04:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
one was my father so
 
04:57:46.310 --> 04:57:46.320 align:start position:0%
um it's out of control and it's not just
 
04:57:48.170 --> 04:57:48.180 align:start position:0%
food it's everything I have a friend
 
04:57:49.670 --> 04:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
that does a homestead business with
 
04:57:51.050 --> 04:57:51.060 align:start position:0%
cakes so
 
04:57:52.910 --> 04:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
um we're seeing it a lot so this is
 
04:57:55.010 --> 04:57:55.020 align:start position:0%
really about just increasing this so
 
04:57:56.868 --> 04:57:56.878 align:start position:0%
because the costs are going up for the
 
04:57:58.250 --> 04:57:58.260 align:start position:0%
most part yeah I mean I didn't even
 
04:58:00.110 --> 04:58:00.120 align:start position:0%
touch on costs of like actual
 
04:58:02.628 --> 04:58:02.638 align:start position:0%
Transportation the packaging of things
 
04:58:04.970 --> 04:58:04.980 align:start position:0%
the cost of Labor there's a huge labor
 
04:58:07.550 --> 04:58:07.560 align:start position:0%
shortage right now where I lost I I
 
04:58:10.070 --> 04:58:10.080 align:start position:0%
prefer to buy my Seafood local I can't
 
04:58:12.890 --> 04:58:12.900 align:start position:0%
do it anymore because uh well I'm
 
04:58:14.390 --> 04:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
extremely Limited in my what I can do
 
04:58:17.930 --> 04:58:17.940 align:start position:0%
because uh my local seafood company the
 
04:58:20.750 --> 04:58:20.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Community Seafood uh just
 
04:58:22.610 --> 04:58:22.620 align:start position:0%
couldn't find people to transport the
 
04:58:24.350 --> 04:58:24.360 align:start position:0%
product they couldn't find drivers and
 
04:58:26.750 --> 04:58:26.760 align:start position:0%
so they just shut down so we just lost a
 
04:58:29.750 --> 04:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:37.190 --> 04:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:38.270 --> 04:58:38.280 align:start position:0%
you know I think when we're talking
 
04:58:39.708 --> 04:58:39.718 align:start position:0%
about baked goods we don't have to worry
 
04:58:42.050 --> 04:58:42.060 align:start position:0%
about so much about storage but when you
 
04:58:44.030 --> 04:58:44.040 align:start position:0%
start to talk about larger Productions I
 
04:58:45.830 --> 04:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
mean so if I make a dish I can put it in
 
04:58:47.330 --> 04:58:47.340 align:start position:0%
my refrigerator that's fine if I make it
 
04:58:49.490 --> 04:58:49.500 align:start position:0%
for 40 of my neighbors there's a safety
 
04:58:50.750 --> 04:58:50.760 align:start position:0%
issue so
 
04:58:52.730 --> 04:58:52.740 align:start position:0%
what is excluded as potentially
 
04:58:54.890 --> 04:58:54.900 align:start position:0%
hazardous food here and what uh so I
 
04:58:55.850 --> 04:58:55.860 align:start position:0%
don't have the definition right in front
 
04:58:57.770 --> 04:58:57.780 align:start position:0%
of me but potentially hazardous foods
 
04:59:00.410 --> 04:59:00.420 align:start position:0%
would be foods that aren't really shelf
 
04:59:02.090 --> 04:59:02.100 align:start position:0%
stable foods with a very short
 
04:59:05.810 --> 04:59:05.820 align:start position:0%
expiration date so uh more dairy
 
04:59:08.150 --> 04:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
products uh food that's going to spoil
 
04:59:10.610 --> 04:59:10.620 align:start position:0%
and not it's excluding
 
04:59:15.288 --> 04:59:15.298 align:start position:0%
um like baked goods uh stuff preserves
 
04:59:17.090 --> 04:59:17.100 align:start position:0%
um Dry Goods like
 
04:59:18.890 --> 04:59:18.900 align:start position:0%
anything like that
 
04:59:22.010 --> 04:59:22.020 align:start position:0%
representative Creighton
 
04:59:24.410 --> 04:59:24.420 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am thank you Mr Nash for
 
04:59:28.128 --> 04:59:28.138 align:start position:0%
your testimony uh in your experience
 
04:59:30.708 --> 04:59:30.718 align:start position:0%
do you have a feel for
 
04:59:32.330 --> 04:59:32.340 align:start position:0%
how many people have actually gotten
 
04:59:34.490 --> 04:59:34.500 align:start position:0%
sick on Homestead food
 
04:59:37.490 --> 04:59:37.500 align:start position:0%
is that does it happen every day or is
 
04:59:40.670 --> 04:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
it uh exotic I think it's very rare
 
04:59:42.830 --> 04:59:42.840 align:start position:0%
um personally I think it's very rare I
 
04:59:44.150 --> 04:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
don't have I don't have hard numbers on
 
04:59:46.190 --> 04:59:46.200 align:start position:0%
it uh I know that that number would be
 
04:59:48.890 --> 04:59:48.900 align:start position:0%
tracked out there but uh I really don't
 
04:59:51.230 --> 04:59:51.240 align:start position:0%
think it's very common uh think about
 
04:59:53.330 --> 04:59:53.340 align:start position:0%
think about the bake sales you've been
 
04:59:55.250 --> 04:59:55.260 align:start position:0%
to and you know your own personal
 
04:59:57.650 --> 04:59:57.660 align:start position:0%
experiences with home homesteaded food
 
05:00:01.610 --> 05:00:01.620 align:start position:0%
it's really uh low risk food and uh it's
 
05:00:03.170 --> 05:00:03.180 align:start position:0%
really very fresh food it's not sitting
 
05:00:05.208 --> 05:00:05.218 align:start position:0%
around very long so it's it's really
 
05:00:07.250 --> 05:00:07.260 align:start position:0%
uncommon okay thank you
 
05:00:08.990 --> 05:00:09.000 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
05:00:11.810 --> 05:00:11.820 align:start position:0%
representative Dotsy uh yes thank you uh
 
05:00:14.208 --> 05:00:14.218 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair okay so to help me
 
05:00:17.750 --> 05:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
understand so at the 35 000 threshold
 
05:00:21.890 --> 05:00:21.900 align:start position:0%
it's not only a 150 dollar license but
 
05:00:24.530 --> 05:00:24.540 align:start position:0%
you say it triggers a number of other
 
05:00:26.868 --> 05:00:26.878 align:start position:0%
regulations that would have to come in
 
05:00:30.230 --> 05:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
play that would cost the um the owner a
 
05:00:31.270 --> 05:00:31.280 align:start position:0%
lot of money
 
05:00:34.128 --> 05:00:34.138 align:start position:0%
is that correct and then okay so yeah so
 
05:00:35.628 --> 05:00:35.638 align:start position:0%
if you're looking for I don't mean to
 
05:00:37.850 --> 05:00:37.860 align:start position:0%
cut you off but if you look at uh the
 
05:00:40.490 --> 05:00:40.500 align:start position:0%
the other bill that we're uh relating to
 
05:00:43.190 --> 05:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
homesteads today 122. if you look at the
 
05:00:44.570 --> 05:00:44.580 align:start position:0%
text at that I believe there's a bunch
 
05:00:46.850 --> 05:00:46.860 align:start position:0%
of examples of different uh inspections
 
05:00:49.368 --> 05:00:49.378 align:start position:0%
that they're exempt from under the home
 
05:00:50.930 --> 05:00:50.940 align:start position:0%
something and regulations so yeah
 
05:00:53.090 --> 05:00:53.100 align:start position:0%
there's there's quite a there's quite a
 
05:00:56.230 --> 05:00:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:59.990 --> 05:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
thank you so uh instead of using the
 
05:01:02.208 --> 05:01:02.218 align:start position:0%
seventy thousand dollars what if we had
 
05:01:05.690 --> 05:01:05.700 align:start position:0%
stepped regulations so in other words
 
05:01:10.788 --> 05:01:10.798 align:start position:0%
35 000 or below no regulation 35
 
05:01:13.990 --> 05:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
000 and one dollar to a number would be
 
05:01:17.330 --> 05:01:17.340 align:start position:0%
additional regulations but not as own
 
05:01:21.350 --> 05:01:21.360 align:start position:0%
onerous as what they are now is is that
 
05:01:25.670 --> 05:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
something that might uh work or not
 
05:01:28.788 --> 05:01:28.798 align:start position:0%
uh I guess it's worth discussing I I'm
 
05:01:31.190 --> 05:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
not sure how well that would work in
 
05:01:33.650 --> 05:01:33.660 align:start position:0%
practice uh
 
05:01:35.390 --> 05:01:35.400 align:start position:0%
yeah then you're getting into the
 
05:01:38.628 --> 05:01:38.638 align:start position:0%
territory of making it difficult for
 
05:01:41.868 --> 05:01:41.878 align:start position:0%
these Homestead operations to
 
05:01:44.810 --> 05:01:44.820 align:start position:0%
follow uh exactly what regulations
 
05:01:47.390 --> 05:01:47.400 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to be following like to
 
05:01:49.850 --> 05:01:49.860 align:start position:0%
understand exactly okay now I hit this
 
05:01:52.250 --> 05:01:52.260 align:start position:0%
dollar amount now I need to go consult
 
05:01:54.288 --> 05:01:54.298 align:start position:0%
and figure out exactly what I need to do
 
05:01:58.310 --> 05:01:58.320 align:start position:0%
and I I really hesitate personally
 
05:02:00.230 --> 05:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
towards any sort of Regulation that's
 
05:02:03.050 --> 05:02:03.060 align:start position:0%
going to discourage them from trying to
 
05:02:05.330 --> 05:02:05.340 align:start position:0%
succeed and do better and grow and if
 
05:02:06.530 --> 05:02:06.540 align:start position:0%
there's if they're coming up on that
 
05:02:08.930 --> 05:02:08.940 align:start position:0%
dollar amount and they're thinking
 
05:02:11.448 --> 05:02:11.458 align:start position:0%
okay well I should try and keep my sales
 
05:02:13.550 --> 05:02:13.560 align:start position:0%
lower I should try and hold myself back
 
05:02:15.350 --> 05:02:15.360 align:start position:0%
or I'm gonna I'm gonna get bumped up
 
05:02:17.930 --> 05:02:17.940 align:start position:0%
into a next a next bracket uh I would
 
05:02:20.990 --> 05:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
hesitate uh towards anything like that
 
05:02:21.000 --> 05:02:21.830 align:start position:0%
hesitate uh towards anything like that
um

05:02:21.830 --> 05:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:21.840 --> 05:02:23.270 align:start position:0%
um
yeah

05:02:23.270 --> 05:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:02:27.350 --> 05:02:27.360 align:start position:0%
I I would see that as problematic but
 
05:02:29.270 --> 05:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby
 
05:02:32.208 --> 05:02:32.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:35.150 --> 05:02:35.160 align:start position:0%
you need things that uh when the last
 
05:02:37.910 --> 05:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
time we were considering uh raising this
 
05:02:40.070 --> 05:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
cap one of the things that came into
 
05:02:43.250 --> 05:02:43.260 align:start position:0%
play was which products would actually
 
05:02:46.250 --> 05:02:46.260 align:start position:0%
come anywhere near the cap so I do a lot
 
05:02:47.930 --> 05:02:47.940 align:start position:0%
of Home canning
 
05:02:51.470 --> 05:02:51.480 align:start position:0%
um and uh you know and I know how long
 
05:02:54.550 --> 05:02:54.560 align:start position:0%
it takes in my home kitchen to can
 
05:02:57.230 --> 05:02:57.240 align:start position:0%
multiple batches of jelly
 
05:02:59.448 --> 05:02:59.458 align:start position:0%
and I don't think I could get anywhere
 
05:03:03.890 --> 05:03:03.900 align:start position:0%
near 35 000 even uh in in a reasonable
 
05:03:08.330 --> 05:03:08.340 align:start position:0%
amount of you know time never mind 75 70
 
05:03:10.910 --> 05:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
000 doing jellies
 
05:03:16.250 --> 05:03:16.260 align:start position:0%
um so uh the example that sort of
 
05:03:18.650 --> 05:03:18.660 align:start position:0%
convinced us that it would be make sense
 
05:03:21.770 --> 05:03:21.780 align:start position:0%
to raise it uh from 10 to 20 and then
 
05:03:24.288 --> 05:03:24.298 align:start position:0%
from 20 to 35 in the course of the last
 
05:03:27.770 --> 05:03:27.780 align:start position:0%
six years was wedding cakes
 
05:03:30.650 --> 05:03:30.660 align:start position:0%
and that the ingredients for wedding
 
05:03:34.070 --> 05:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
cakes specifically had increased is that
 
05:03:35.628 --> 05:03:35.638 align:start position:0%
uh have you heard from wedding cake
 
05:03:38.868 --> 05:03:38.878 align:start position:0%
producers in terms of their need to uh
 
05:03:42.410 --> 05:03:42.420 align:start position:0%
to to raise this cap I wouldn't say I've
 
05:03:44.810 --> 05:03:44.820 align:start position:0%
specifically asked wedding cake
 
05:03:48.170 --> 05:03:48.180 align:start position:0%
producers but uh wedding cakes also are
 
05:03:52.368 --> 05:03:52.378 align:start position:0%
a skilled labor so when the uh
 
05:03:54.410 --> 05:03:54.420 align:start position:0%
when when the cost of Labor is rising
 
05:03:56.810 --> 05:03:56.820 align:start position:0%
the cost of wedding cakes is also going
 
05:04:00.890 --> 05:04:00.900 align:start position:0%
to rise and I would ask that
 
05:04:00.900 --> 05:04:02.030 align:start position:0%
to rise and I would ask that
um

05:04:02.030 --> 05:04:02.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:06.350 --> 05:04:06.360 align:start position:0%
if if you don't see uh the dollar amount
 
05:04:08.930 --> 05:04:08.940 align:start position:0%
I don't know however that but I I think
 
05:04:10.670 --> 05:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
that if if you don't see the dollar
 
05:04:13.128 --> 05:04:13.138 align:start position:0%
amount as being relevant
 
05:04:13.138 --> 05:04:14.208 align:start position:0%
amount as being relevant
um

05:04:14.208 --> 05:04:14.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:16.850 --> 05:04:16.860 align:start position:0%
uh as it seems to me that you you're
 
05:04:18.890 --> 05:04:18.900 align:start position:0%
thinking uh then I don't see why you'd
 
05:04:21.890 --> 05:04:21.900 align:start position:0%
be opposed to raising it anyway if you
 
05:04:23.208 --> 05:04:23.218 align:start position:0%
don't think they're gonna hit anywhere
 
05:04:26.208 --> 05:04:26.218 align:start position:0%
near it then what's the harm in raising
 
05:04:29.030 --> 05:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:30.650 --> 05:04:30.660 align:start position:0%
um okay so this this is not an
 
05:04:32.750 --> 05:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity for debate I just wanted to
 
05:04:35.530 --> 05:04:35.540 align:start position:0%
get a sense of where you know which
 
05:04:38.208 --> 05:04:38.218 align:start position:0%
uh categories of the the relatively
 
05:04:39.708 --> 05:04:39.718 align:start position:0%
narrow set of categories that are
 
05:04:41.090 --> 05:04:41.100 align:start position:0%
actually allowed under the homestead
 
05:04:43.788 --> 05:04:43.798 align:start position:0%
food would be running up against the the
 
05:04:45.288 --> 05:04:45.298 align:start position:0%
money limit
 
05:04:47.628 --> 05:04:47.638 align:start position:0%
um so thank you for your thank you
 
05:04:50.570 --> 05:04:50.580 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
05:04:55.010 --> 05:04:55.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Nas and I will now call
 
05:04:58.670 --> 05:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
Colleen Smith from DHHS
 
05:05:08.810 --> 05:05:08.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:10.670 --> 05:05:10.680 align:start position:0%
good afternoon for the record my name is
 
05:05:12.410 --> 05:05:12.420 align:start position:0%
Colleen Smith I'm with the Department of
 
05:05:13.788 --> 05:05:13.798 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services food
 
05:05:15.770 --> 05:05:15.780 align:start position:0%
protection section and I'm here to
 
05:05:18.890 --> 05:05:18.900 align:start position:0%
provide information on House Bill 119. I
 
05:05:20.510 --> 05:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
just want to provide some clarifying
 
05:05:23.570 --> 05:05:23.580 align:start position:0%
information so a homestead license they
 
05:05:25.070 --> 05:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
are allowed to make non-potentially
 
05:05:27.170 --> 05:05:27.180 align:start position:0%
hazardous foods and as was as as
 
05:05:29.208 --> 05:05:29.218 align:start position:0%
examples that were brought forth before
 
05:05:32.270 --> 05:05:32.280 align:start position:0%
cakes cookies jams jellies things that
 
05:05:34.128 --> 05:05:34.138 align:start position:0%
don't require temperature control for
 
05:05:37.368 --> 05:05:37.378 align:start position:0%
safety we also things that are acidified
 
05:05:39.590 --> 05:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
where you're adding acid to make this
 
05:05:41.270 --> 05:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
shelf Stables because there's an
 
05:05:43.610 --> 05:05:43.620 align:start position:0%
increased risk of clostridium botulinum
 
05:05:45.890 --> 05:05:45.900 align:start position:0%
the bacteria that causes botulism with
 
05:05:47.628 --> 05:05:47.638 align:start position:0%
those types of products
 
05:05:51.050 --> 05:05:51.060 align:start position:0%
so it order so there are a certain group
 
05:05:52.970 --> 05:05:52.980 align:start position:0%
of Homestead food operations that don't
 
05:05:55.910 --> 05:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
require a license and those are that
 
05:05:57.890 --> 05:05:57.900 align:start position:0%
make under thirty five thousand dollars
 
05:06:01.368 --> 05:06:01.378 align:start position:0%
a year those that are selling only from
 
05:06:04.368 --> 05:06:04.378 align:start position:0%
their own Farm Stand their own home or
 
05:06:06.530 --> 05:06:06.540 align:start position:0%
at a farmer's market or to retail stores
 
05:06:09.830 --> 05:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
so all they have to do is have uh and
 
05:06:12.230 --> 05:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
this and then a license would be if
 
05:06:14.030 --> 05:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
you're making over thirty five thousand
 
05:06:16.430 --> 05:06:16.440 align:start position:0%
dollars a year selling via the Internet
 
05:06:19.190 --> 05:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
or if you're selling to restaurants and
 
05:06:21.230 --> 05:06:21.240 align:start position:0%
the rationale for that is because
 
05:06:23.390 --> 05:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
there's not in those instances there's
 
05:06:24.850 --> 05:06:24.860 align:start position:0%
not a direct
 
05:06:27.890 --> 05:06:27.900 align:start position:0%
Homesteader to Consumer interaction
 
05:06:30.470 --> 05:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
those they're like a step removed from
 
05:06:32.750 --> 05:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
the final consumer
 
05:06:35.030 --> 05:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
um we don't track income so it's
 
05:06:37.128 --> 05:06:37.138 align:start position:0%
completely an honor System once they hit
 
05:06:39.650 --> 05:06:39.660 align:start position:0%
that 35 000 and they come to us for a
 
05:06:42.230 --> 05:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
license we generally find that that's
 
05:06:43.788 --> 05:06:43.798 align:start position:0%
not the reason they're coming to us for
 
05:06:45.350 --> 05:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
a license it's because they want to be
 
05:06:47.930 --> 05:06:47.940 align:start position:0%
licensed even though they don't need a
 
05:06:50.150 --> 05:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
license to sell to store sometimes they
 
05:06:52.010 --> 05:06:52.020 align:start position:0%
the store is requiring them to have a
 
05:06:54.230 --> 05:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
license or they just want to have our
 
05:06:56.030 --> 05:06:56.040 align:start position:0%
license and inspection
 
05:06:57.830 --> 05:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
they don't have to have commercial
 
05:07:00.110 --> 05:07:00.120 align:start position:0%
kitchen no Homesteader has to have
 
05:07:01.190 --> 05:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
commercial a commercial commercial
 
05:07:03.288 --> 05:07:03.298 align:start position:0%
kitchen they can have residential
 
05:07:05.990 --> 05:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
equipment like a two Bay sink that's in
 
05:07:08.150 --> 05:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
most people's homes or a one-based sink
 
05:07:10.430 --> 05:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
in a dishwasher they can have a domestic
 
05:07:12.530 --> 05:07:12.540 align:start position:0%
refrigerator they can have pets in the
 
05:07:14.030 --> 05:07:14.040 align:start position:0%
home but we just ask that they secure
 
05:07:16.850 --> 05:07:16.860 align:start position:0%
them away from their area when they're
 
05:07:19.010 --> 05:07:19.020 align:start position:0%
producing their food so they have very
 
05:07:22.430 --> 05:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
there's very minimal requirements for a
 
05:07:24.170 --> 05:07:24.180 align:start position:0%
homestead operation they don't have to
 
05:07:26.390 --> 05:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
have a commercial kitchen it's only when
 
05:07:28.128 --> 05:07:28.138 align:start position:0%
you graduate to making potentially
 
05:07:30.948 --> 05:07:30.958 align:start position:0%
hazardous foods that require
 
05:07:33.770 --> 05:07:33.780 align:start position:0%
refrigeration for safety or more
 
05:07:36.650 --> 05:07:36.660 align:start position:0%
in-depth food preparation that you would
 
05:07:38.030 --> 05:07:38.040 align:start position:0%
graduate to needing that commercial
 
05:07:40.368 --> 05:07:40.378 align:start position:0%
kitchen so just wanted to provide that
 
05:07:43.128 --> 05:07:43.138 align:start position:0%
information and happy to take any
 
05:07:44.530 --> 05:07:44.540 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
05:07:47.030 --> 05:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
representative erval
 
05:07:48.948 --> 05:07:48.958 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
05:07:50.868 --> 05:07:50.878 align:start position:0%
um thank you Ms Smith for coming in I
 
05:07:52.490 --> 05:07:52.500 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank you for taking my my
 
05:07:52.500 --> 05:07:53.628 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank you for taking my my
question

05:07:53.628 --> 05:07:53.638 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:07:55.250 --> 05:07:55.260 align:start position:0%
um I got a little confused though
 
05:07:57.288 --> 05:07:57.298 align:start position:0%
because you kept referencing uh making
 
05:08:00.530 --> 05:08:00.540 align:start position:0%
and income and I don't believe that the
 
05:08:02.510 --> 05:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
bill goes to that right the bill is
 
05:08:06.230 --> 05:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
actually in in gross sales uh and so the
 
05:08:08.628 --> 05:08:08.638 align:start position:0%
making or the income from gross sales
 
05:08:10.670 --> 05:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
presumably would be some fraction
 
05:08:12.830 --> 05:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
thereof of that amount is that correct
 
05:08:15.110 --> 05:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
or do I have it backwards so it would be
 
05:08:17.690 --> 05:08:17.700 align:start position:0%
uh it's based on Gross the exemptions
 
05:08:19.610 --> 05:08:19.620 align:start position:0%
are based on gross sales but we don't
 
05:08:22.070 --> 05:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
try we don't track that information we
 
05:08:23.930 --> 05:08:23.940 align:start position:0%
don't we're not asking for documentation
 
05:08:25.850 --> 05:08:25.860 align:start position:0%
when they submit their license of how
 
05:08:27.110 --> 05:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
much money they made from their
 
05:08:29.150 --> 05:08:29.160 align:start position:0%
Homestead food understood just a quick
 
05:08:31.010 --> 05:08:31.020 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up so so it's on it's
 
05:08:33.050 --> 05:08:33.060 align:start position:0%
on Gross sale of product it has nothing
 
05:08:34.910 --> 05:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
to do with the profitability of the
 
05:08:36.890 --> 05:08:36.900 align:start position:0%
business exactly thank you thank you
 
05:08:39.230 --> 05:08:39.240 align:start position:0%
appreciate it representative Bixby
 
05:08:42.288 --> 05:08:42.298 align:start position:0%
uh so I just wanted to get a little
 
05:08:46.128 --> 05:08:46.138 align:start position:0%
Clarity so there's so under 35 000
 
05:08:47.930 --> 05:08:47.940 align:start position:0%
there's no licensing needed no
 
05:08:50.750 --> 05:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
inspection or anything over 35
 
05:08:52.550 --> 05:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
000 uh
 
05:08:55.250 --> 05:08:55.260 align:start position:0%
you need uh there is a license specific
 
05:08:57.350 --> 05:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
to that is specifically a homestead
 
05:08:57.360 --> 05:08:58.430 align:start position:0%
to that is specifically a homestead
license

05:08:58.430 --> 05:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
license
 
05:09:00.830 --> 05:09:00.840 align:start position:0%
that is correct so it is it's a hundred
 
05:09:02.990 --> 05:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
and fifty dollar annual fee they have
 
05:09:05.090 --> 05:09:05.100 align:start position:0%
they make an initial application and
 
05:09:06.708 --> 05:09:06.718 align:start position:0%
there's an inspection that accompanies
 
05:09:09.470 --> 05:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
that inspection and it's very I I think
 
05:09:11.930 --> 05:09:11.940 align:start position:0%
most I would hope most homesteaders
 
05:09:13.430 --> 05:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
would agree it's it's cut pretty
 
05:09:15.770 --> 05:09:15.780 align:start position:0%
educational in nature
 
05:09:17.628 --> 05:09:17.638 align:start position:0%
um they discuss labeling of the product
 
05:09:19.430 --> 05:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
they look at
 
05:09:21.590 --> 05:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
um you know talk about sanitizing their
 
05:09:25.970 --> 05:09:25.980 align:start position:0%
equipment and surfaces before before
 
05:09:29.390 --> 05:09:29.400 align:start position:0%
their production and and how to do that
 
05:09:32.750 --> 05:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions oh follow-up so
 
05:09:32.760 --> 05:09:33.590 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions oh follow-up so
um

05:09:33.590 --> 05:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:37.490 --> 05:09:37.500 align:start position:0%
so I'm just so uh this is so the whole
 
05:09:40.490 --> 05:09:40.500 align:start position:0%
and is there any
 
05:09:44.990 --> 05:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
um Tom any uh cap on how much gross
 
05:09:47.448 --> 05:09:47.458 align:start position:0%
sales you can have under a homestead
 
05:09:50.270 --> 05:09:50.280 align:start position:0%
license that costs you 150 or is that
 
05:09:52.910 --> 05:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
basically whatever you can manage before
 
05:09:55.310 --> 05:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
you run out of space that's exactly
 
05:09:57.350 --> 05:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
right there's no cap once you have a
 
05:09:59.868 --> 05:09:59.878 align:start position:0%
have that Homestead license
 
05:10:02.628 --> 05:10:02.638 align:start position:0%
um it and again as you mentioned you you
 
05:10:05.208 --> 05:10:05.218 align:start position:0%
do practically run out of space once
 
05:10:06.890 --> 05:10:06.900 align:start position:0%
your business grows to that level where
 
05:10:09.288 --> 05:10:09.298 align:start position:0%
you outgrow your residential kitchen and
 
05:10:11.628 --> 05:10:11.638 align:start position:0%
need a commercial facility
 
05:10:15.350 --> 05:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
oh one more okay do you happen to know
 
05:10:17.810 --> 05:10:17.820 align:start position:0%
what our neighboring states require in
 
05:10:20.270 --> 05:10:20.280 align:start position:0%
in regards to this
 
05:10:22.788 --> 05:10:22.798 align:start position:0%
um it is the the homestead food laws
 
05:10:26.030 --> 05:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
across the U.S are they they vary
 
05:10:28.970 --> 05:10:28.980 align:start position:0%
incredibly into not only in the types of
 
05:10:31.670 --> 05:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
foods that are allowed to be made
 
05:10:33.708 --> 05:10:33.718 align:start position:0%
um where they can be made I don't know
 
05:10:36.470 --> 05:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
about income level if I believe Vermont
 
05:10:39.050 --> 05:10:39.060 align:start position:0%
has a ten thousand dollar limit but
 
05:10:41.948 --> 05:10:41.958 align:start position:0%
um I to be honest with you I they change
 
05:10:45.110 --> 05:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
laws change from state to state very
 
05:10:47.990 --> 05:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
frequently so I I can't speak exactly to
 
05:10:50.390 --> 05:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
what those are right now thank you
 
05:10:52.010 --> 05:10:52.020 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
 
05:10:52.020 --> 05:10:54.110 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
Potenza

05:10:54.110 --> 05:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
Potenza
 
05:10:56.030 --> 05:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming to testify I just
 
05:10:57.948 --> 05:10:57.958 align:start position:0%
had a question in regards with
 
05:10:59.868 --> 05:10:59.878 align:start position:0%
um you said it's not it's not like it's
 
05:11:02.390 --> 05:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
policed in regards with the 35
 
05:11:05.510 --> 05:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:07.730 --> 05:11:07.740 align:start position:0%
I'm kind of confused then why is it
 
05:11:07.740 --> 05:11:10.430 align:start position:0%
I'm kind of confused then why is it
there

05:11:10.430 --> 05:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:13.490 --> 05:11:13.500 align:start position:0%
to I to be honest with you
 
05:11:16.970 --> 05:11:16.980 align:start position:0%
um I I don't I I historically it has
 
05:11:19.310 --> 05:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
been it has bumped up over time I think
 
05:11:21.170 --> 05:11:21.180 align:start position:0%
it started as five thousand ten thousand
 
05:11:23.390 --> 05:11:23.400 align:start position:0%
twenty thousand thirty five thousand we
 
05:11:26.330 --> 05:11:26.340 align:start position:0%
don't track it and we don't know who is
 
05:11:28.550 --> 05:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
coming to us solely because because of
 
05:11:32.270 --> 05:11:32.280 align:start position:0%
income we have currently 133 licensed
 
05:11:36.708 --> 05:11:36.718 align:start position:0%
homesteads and and so if you it wouldn't
 
05:11:39.590 --> 05:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
be a significant number even with even
 
05:11:44.690 --> 05:11:44.700 align:start position:0%
in our amount of license population
 
05:11:47.750 --> 05:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up I did it right this
 
05:11:47.760 --> 05:11:48.610 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up I did it right this
time

05:11:48.610 --> 05:11:48.620 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:11:52.250 --> 05:11:52.260 align:start position:0%
so if let's say someone comes for that
 
05:11:54.368 --> 05:11:54.378 align:start position:0%
and you find out that they have been
 
05:11:57.350 --> 05:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
operating above that threshold is there
 
05:12:00.410 --> 05:12:00.420 align:start position:0%
a penalty or anything like that
 
05:12:02.570 --> 05:12:02.580 align:start position:0%
we don't have any administrative fines
 
05:12:04.610 --> 05:12:04.620 align:start position:0%
for that type of violation it would
 
05:12:06.830 --> 05:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
again this is complete the income is
 
05:12:09.288 --> 05:12:09.298 align:start position:0%
completely an honor System
 
05:12:12.590 --> 05:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
um I if it was struck I I don't know
 
05:12:12.600 --> 05:12:14.030 align:start position:0%
um I if it was struck I I don't know
that

05:12:14.030 --> 05:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:12:17.448 --> 05:12:17.458 align:start position:0%
um that there would be that much impact
 
05:12:19.128 --> 05:12:19.138 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:12:21.170 --> 05:12:21.180 align:start position:0%
representative Morse
 
05:12:22.788 --> 05:12:22.798 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:12:25.850 --> 05:12:25.860 align:start position:0%
um so I just want to be very clear so
 
05:12:27.830 --> 05:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
you can hold a homesteaders food license
 
05:12:31.490 --> 05:12:31.500 align:start position:0%
for 150 but you do not have to update to
 
05:12:33.288 --> 05:12:33.298 align:start position:0%
any kind of commercial kitchen stuff
 
05:12:34.850 --> 05:12:34.860 align:start position:0%
unless you're doing potentially
 
05:12:36.350 --> 05:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
hazardous food is that correct that's
 
05:12:38.810 --> 05:12:38.820 align:start position:0%
correct okay thank you
 
05:12:41.208 --> 05:12:41.218 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
05:12:44.030 --> 05:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
representative Potenza just one other
 
05:12:44.040 --> 05:12:44.868 align:start position:0%
representative Potenza just one other
question

05:12:44.868 --> 05:12:44.878 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:12:47.690 --> 05:12:47.700 align:start position:0%
um you were talking about uh in regards
 
05:12:49.430 --> 05:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
when you get the license
 
05:12:49.440 --> 05:12:50.390 align:start position:0%
when you get the license
um

05:12:50.390 --> 05:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:52.430 --> 05:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
when we had our business we were Serve
 
05:12:54.470 --> 05:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
Safe certified I assume that that's a
 
05:12:56.750 --> 05:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
requirement correct it is not a
 
05:12:58.310 --> 05:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
requirement for a homestead food
 
05:13:01.310 --> 05:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
manufacturer even if they're getting I'm
 
05:13:03.170 --> 05:13:03.180 align:start position:0%
saying if they get the license now even
 
05:13:05.208 --> 05:13:05.218 align:start position:0%
if they get the license a homesteader is
 
05:13:07.010 --> 05:13:07.020 align:start position:0%
exempt from the certified food
 
05:13:11.090 --> 05:13:11.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:13.010 --> 05:13:13.020 align:start position:0%
representative verbal
 
05:13:15.650 --> 05:13:15.660 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman thank you Miss
 
05:13:18.410 --> 05:13:18.420 align:start position:0%
Smith it so there's some interesting
 
05:13:19.970 --> 05:13:19.980 align:start position:0%
questions coming from the other side of
 
05:13:21.708 --> 05:13:21.718 align:start position:0%
the room that that sort of have me
 
05:13:24.050 --> 05:13:24.060 align:start position:0%
perplexed as to
 
05:13:26.868 --> 05:13:26.878 align:start position:0%
um why it is that we have this
 
05:13:28.788 --> 05:13:28.798 align:start position:0%
regulation so if I violate the
 
05:13:31.070 --> 05:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
regulation there's no there's no teeth
 
05:13:33.650 --> 05:13:33.660 align:start position:0%
in the violation so
 
05:13:33.660 --> 05:13:36.288 align:start position:0%
in the violation so
yeah

05:13:36.288 --> 05:13:36.298 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:13:40.010 --> 05:13:40.020 align:start position:0%
it almost sounds more like a a public
 
05:13:40.020 --> 05:13:42.590 align:start position:0%
it almost sounds more like a a public
education

05:13:42.590 --> 05:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
education
 
05:13:42.600 --> 05:13:44.150 align:start position:0%
education
um

05:13:44.150 --> 05:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:13:46.010 --> 05:13:46.020 align:start position:0%
type of
 
05:13:50.750 --> 05:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:53.810 --> 05:13:53.820 align:start position:0%
I just I'm not my I guess my question is
 
05:13:56.270 --> 05:13:56.280 align:start position:0%
if so if I if I'm violating the
 
05:13:58.610 --> 05:13:58.620 align:start position:0%
ordinance if I'm if I'm uh retailing
 
05:14:00.948 --> 05:14:00.958 align:start position:0%
forty thousand dollars uh worth of food
 
05:14:03.230 --> 05:14:03.240 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm outside I should have the
 
05:14:05.270 --> 05:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
license and I don't and God forbid
 
05:14:07.670 --> 05:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
something goes wrong
 
05:14:10.550 --> 05:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
um is the only downside that if I get
 
05:14:14.030 --> 05:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
sued by a victim of of my bad food that
 
05:14:16.788 --> 05:14:16.798 align:start position:0%
perhaps the Judgment would be harsher
 
05:14:18.590 --> 05:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
because I I didn't possess a license
 
05:14:20.868 --> 05:14:20.878 align:start position:0%
that I should have I
 
05:14:23.868 --> 05:14:23.878 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm trying to understand why why
 
05:14:26.030 --> 05:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
why do we have this if it if it has no
 
05:14:30.770 --> 05:14:30.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:34.128 --> 05:14:34.138 align:start position:0%
so uh I can I can give you some
 
05:14:37.368 --> 05:14:37.378 align:start position:0%
historical perspective on on Homestead
 
05:14:39.708 --> 05:14:39.718 align:start position:0%
homesteaders is
 
05:14:42.350 --> 05:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
it used to be that all homesteaders were
 
05:14:43.788 --> 05:14:43.798 align:start position:0%
were licensed
 
05:14:45.650 --> 05:14:45.660 align:start position:0%
um regardless they they could still make
 
05:14:48.050 --> 05:14:48.060 align:start position:0%
only the non-potentially hazardous foods
 
05:14:50.510 --> 05:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
but they all required a license and then
 
05:14:54.830 --> 05:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
uh I believe it was 2012 we there was a
 
05:14:57.410 --> 05:14:57.420 align:start position:0%
a law that was passed that Exempted a
 
05:14:59.150 --> 05:14:59.160 align:start position:0%
certain certain group depending on
 
05:15:01.550 --> 05:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
income and where they were selling food
 
05:15:05.628 --> 05:15:05.638 align:start position:0%
those Foods too and then again as it's
 
05:15:07.730 --> 05:15:07.740 align:start position:0%
been mentioned that income level has has
 
05:15:09.830 --> 05:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
risen a couple different times from ten
 
05:15:11.868 --> 05:15:11.878 align:start position:0%
thousand to twenty thousand to thirty
 
05:15:14.330 --> 05:15:14.340 align:start position:0%
five thousand now but there was never
 
05:15:17.270 --> 05:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
any it was more an honor System that
 
05:15:19.430 --> 05:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
again it was understood that once you
 
05:15:21.708 --> 05:15:21.718 align:start position:0%
started making that amount of money in
 
05:15:23.990 --> 05:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
your home you were going to need a
 
05:15:26.628 --> 05:15:26.638 align:start position:0%
commercial facility that that was that's
 
05:15:28.730 --> 05:15:28.740 align:start position:0%
the intention of the bill was to give
 
05:15:32.208 --> 05:15:32.218 align:start position:0%
home food manufacturers an easy way to
 
05:15:34.010 --> 05:15:34.020 align:start position:0%
get started get their foot in the door
 
05:15:36.650 --> 05:15:36.660 align:start position:0%
without a lot of Regulation without a
 
05:15:38.990 --> 05:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
lot of upfront costs and then if their
 
05:15:40.368 --> 05:15:40.378 align:start position:0%
business was successful full and they
 
05:15:41.628 --> 05:15:41.638 align:start position:0%
grew that they'd go to a commercial
 
05:15:44.030 --> 05:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
space it wasn't meant to be punitive
 
05:15:46.610 --> 05:15:46.620 align:start position:0%
that we were going to be the the income
 
05:15:49.430 --> 05:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
police and looking for who was violating
 
05:15:51.890 --> 05:15:51.900 align:start position:0%
that it was more a good faith effort to
 
05:15:53.990 --> 05:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
give small businesses an opportunity to
 
05:15:56.270 --> 05:15:56.280 align:start position:0%
enter the marketplace with with less
 
05:15:56.280 --> 05:15:57.530 align:start position:0%
enter the marketplace with with less
regulation

05:15:57.530 --> 05:15:57.540 align:start position:0%
regulation
 
05:15:59.330 --> 05:15:59.340 align:start position:0%
thank you I appreciate the answer thank
 
05:16:01.128 --> 05:16:01.138 align:start position:0%

for uh Ross Connolly
 
05:16:18.890 --> 05:16:18.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:21.050 --> 05:16:21.060 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
05:16:23.270 --> 05:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
committee uh for the record my name is
 
05:16:24.770 --> 05:16:24.780 align:start position:0%
Ross Connolly I'm the deputy state
 
05:16:26.810 --> 05:16:26.820 align:start position:0%
director for Americans for Prosperity in
 
05:16:28.850 --> 05:16:28.860 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire here to offer our support
 
05:16:30.550 --> 05:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
for HB 119
 
05:16:33.650 --> 05:16:33.660 align:start position:0%
uh just some background so uh as the
 
05:16:36.350 --> 05:16:36.360 align:start position:0%
previous uh speaker mentioned in 2011
 
05:16:38.810 --> 05:16:38.820 align:start position:0%
our state made the decision to establish
 
05:16:41.628 --> 05:16:41.638 align:start position:0%
a two-tiered system for selling homemade
 
05:16:43.850 --> 05:16:43.860 align:start position:0%
food products if a single mother decided
 
05:16:46.010 --> 05:16:46.020 align:start position:0%
to start selling homemade cookies to
 
05:16:47.868 --> 05:16:47.878 align:start position:0%
make some extra money she would have to
 
05:16:50.150 --> 05:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
keep the gross uh total revenue under
 
05:16:52.190 --> 05:16:52.200 align:start position:0%
twenty thousand dollars and she would
 
05:16:54.830 --> 05:16:54.840 align:start position:0%
not be able to sell in retail stores or
 
05:16:56.570 --> 05:16:56.580 align:start position:0%
online unless she acquired that
 
05:17:00.470 --> 05:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
Homestead food license uh last year uh
 
05:17:02.390 --> 05:17:02.400 align:start position:0%
thanks in large part to the efforts of
 
05:17:04.070 --> 05:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
The Honorable Herschel Nunes who's
 
05:17:05.830 --> 05:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
watching online today
 
05:17:08.810 --> 05:17:08.820 align:start position:0%
the legislator legislature made the wide
 
05:17:11.030 --> 05:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
decision to increase that limit from
 
05:17:13.368 --> 05:17:13.378 align:start position:0%
twenty thousand to thirty five thousand
 
05:17:16.010 --> 05:17:16.020 align:start position:0%
dollars we supported that bill it was a
 
05:17:19.250 --> 05:17:19.260 align:start position:0%
great step to start to allow these these
 
05:17:21.230 --> 05:17:21.240 align:start position:0%
folks to to grow a little more since
 
05:17:24.170 --> 05:17:24.180 align:start position:0%
this is gross revenue not profit they're
 
05:17:26.868 --> 05:17:26.878 align:start position:0%
not making 35 000 of profit this is just
 
05:17:29.330 --> 05:17:29.340 align:start position:0%
any money that's coming in
 
05:17:29.340 --> 05:17:30.650 align:start position:0%
any money that's coming in
um

05:17:30.650 --> 05:17:30.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:32.690 --> 05:17:32.700 align:start position:0%
as we know businesses can be expensive
 
05:17:35.150 --> 05:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
to get off the ground uh we we think
 
05:17:37.250 --> 05:17:37.260 align:start position:0%
moving it to seventy thousand dollars or
 
05:17:40.850 --> 05:17:40.860 align:start position:0%
or just increasing it uh a little bit
 
05:17:43.310 --> 05:17:43.320 align:start position:0%
even uh puts these entrepreneurs in a
 
05:17:46.190 --> 05:17:46.200 align:start position:0%
better position uh to eventually get
 
05:17:48.948 --> 05:17:48.958 align:start position:0%
achieve licensure and hopefully open up
 
05:17:52.090 --> 05:17:52.100 align:start position:0%
a store in our communities and start uh
 
05:17:55.490 --> 05:17:55.500 align:start position:0%
providing a bigger Service uh to to the
 
05:17:58.490 --> 05:17:58.500 align:start position:0%
state but that costs money uh and and to
 
05:18:01.490 --> 05:18:01.500 align:start position:0%
have an extra amount of of cash stored
 
05:18:04.010 --> 05:18:04.020 align:start position:0%
would be a big help for these folks to
 
05:18:05.868 --> 05:18:05.878 align:start position:0%
hopefully grow that business into that
 
05:18:05.878 --> 05:18:07.550 align:start position:0%
hopefully grow that business into that
storefront

05:18:07.550 --> 05:18:07.560 align:start position:0%
storefront
 
05:18:10.070 --> 05:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
um this legislation does not change what
 
05:18:12.770 --> 05:18:12.780 align:start position:0%
a homestead food operation is doesn't
 
05:18:14.690 --> 05:18:14.700 align:start position:0%
change any of the regulations they still
 
05:18:16.670 --> 05:18:16.680 align:start position:0%
have to label their products still have
 
05:18:19.430 --> 05:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
to put the ingredients on their products
 
05:18:22.490 --> 05:18:22.500 align:start position:0%
um uh regulation should remain in place
 
05:18:24.410 --> 05:18:24.420 align:start position:0%
to ensure food safety standards are met
 
05:18:27.470 --> 05:18:27.480 align:start position:0%
and consumer safety is protected
 
05:18:30.230 --> 05:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
um just some background on uh I think
 
05:18:31.670 --> 05:18:31.680 align:start position:0%
there was a question about other states
 
05:18:34.070 --> 05:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
in the region and across the country uh
 
05:18:35.990 --> 05:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
according to the institute for justice
 
05:18:40.430 --> 05:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
since 2015 34 states and Washington DC
 
05:18:43.430 --> 05:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
have either created uh new homemade food
 
05:18:46.610 --> 05:18:46.620 align:start position:0%
uh programs or expanded their existing
 
05:18:49.970 --> 05:18:49.980 align:start position:0%
laws this includes States like Oklahoma
 
05:18:53.090 --> 05:18:53.100 align:start position:0%
who increased to 75 thousand dollars
 
05:18:55.910 --> 05:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
Connecticut and Maryland increased to
 
05:18:58.070 --> 05:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars which I believe
 
05:19:00.190 --> 05:19:00.200 align:start position:0%
uh the rest of New England is about
 
05:19:03.350 --> 05:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
similar and Florida has the high water
 
05:19:05.390 --> 05:19:05.400 align:start position:0%
mark of uh two hundred and fifty
 
05:19:08.390 --> 05:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars uh who raised those
 
05:19:10.610 --> 05:19:10.620 align:start position:0%
limits so this is an increasingly
 
05:19:12.708 --> 05:19:12.718 align:start position:0%
popular business model
 
05:19:14.270 --> 05:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
um that we believe just needs a little
 
05:19:17.448 --> 05:19:17.458 align:start position:0%
bit more room to grow and expand uh and
 
05:19:20.510 --> 05:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
we believe this bill accomplishes that
 
05:19:23.570 --> 05:19:23.580 align:start position:0%
um just some a little further background
 
05:19:25.910 --> 05:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
on last year's bill I don't think any of
 
05:19:27.948 --> 05:19:27.958 align:start position:0%
us ever would have predicted that the
 
05:19:29.990 --> 05:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
price of goods would increase to the
 
05:19:31.970 --> 05:19:31.980 align:start position:0%
level that they have over the past year
 
05:19:35.150 --> 05:19:35.160 align:start position:0%
when that bill was signed into law uh
 
05:19:37.128 --> 05:19:37.138 align:start position:0%
eggs were probably a quarter of the cost
 
05:19:38.868 --> 05:19:38.878 align:start position:0%
of what they are now if you're making
 
05:19:41.208 --> 05:19:41.218 align:start position:0%
homemade cookies or brownies or what
 
05:19:44.330 --> 05:19:44.340 align:start position:0%
have you that starts to really hit on
 
05:19:47.150 --> 05:19:47.160 align:start position:0%
how much uh product you can actually
 
05:19:52.070 --> 05:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
produce to sell uh so even if uh you
 
05:19:54.230 --> 05:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
know if the committee doesn't think this
 
05:19:56.090 --> 05:19:56.100 align:start position:0%
that seventy thousand dollars might be
 
05:19:58.850 --> 05:19:58.860 align:start position:0%
too big of a jump the the one suggestion
 
05:20:01.730 --> 05:20:01.740 align:start position:0%
that we would make is is uh have it at
 
05:20:03.530 --> 05:20:03.540 align:start position:0%
least be fifty thousand dollars and
 
05:20:06.830 --> 05:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
maybe tie it to to inflation uh so that
 
05:20:08.690 --> 05:20:08.700 align:start position:0%
we don't have to keep coming back here
 
05:20:10.788 --> 05:20:10.798 align:start position:0%
whenever there's a giant jump in prices
 
05:20:14.090 --> 05:20:14.100 align:start position:0%
this would allow more flexibility uh for
 
05:20:17.150 --> 05:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
these these folks to to uh get the
 
05:20:20.270 --> 05:20:20.280 align:start position:0%
revenue that they need uh so for these
 
05:20:22.850 --> 05:20:22.860 align:start position:0%
reasons we urge the committee to move uh
 
05:20:24.470 --> 05:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
HP 119
 
05:20:25.850 --> 05:20:25.860 align:start position:0%
ought to pass and I'd be happy to take
 
05:20:27.708 --> 05:20:27.718 align:start position:0%
questions if there are any
 
05:20:31.490 --> 05:20:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:33.170 --> 05:20:33.180 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for your
 
05:20:35.208 --> 05:20:35.218 align:start position:0%
testimony and going back to
 
05:20:38.990 --> 05:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
representative breville's question I'm
 
05:20:40.788 --> 05:20:40.798 align:start position:0%
let's say today
 
05:20:43.610 --> 05:20:43.620 align:start position:0%
I went out there and I sold 40 000.
 
05:20:46.610 --> 05:20:46.620 align:start position:0%
dollars worth of stuff gross
 
05:20:48.288 --> 05:20:48.298 align:start position:0%
what happens
 
05:20:51.170 --> 05:20:51.180 align:start position:0%
is it I mean so what uh thank you for
 
05:20:53.990 --> 05:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
the question representative uh I I'm not
 
05:20:56.868 --> 05:20:56.878 align:start position:0%
entirely sure uh the the department who
 
05:20:58.730 --> 05:20:58.740 align:start position:0%
just spoke probably knows best and if
 
05:21:01.128 --> 05:21:01.138 align:start position:0%
they don't enforce it then I I would say
 
05:21:03.470 --> 05:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
uh you know the original Bill last year
 
05:21:06.590 --> 05:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
was to end the license uh the thirty
 
05:21:08.930 --> 05:21:08.940 align:start position:0%
five thousand dollars was a a compromise
 
05:21:11.690 --> 05:21:11.700 align:start position:0%
to just get the ball uh moving give
 
05:21:14.330 --> 05:21:14.340 align:start position:0%
these folks a little bit more cushion
 
05:21:16.610 --> 05:21:16.620 align:start position:0%
um but I I can't comment on on why it's
 
05:21:19.250 --> 05:21:19.260 align:start position:0%
not being enforced or or how that
 
05:21:22.490 --> 05:21:22.500 align:start position:0%
operates in practice I can say uh
 
05:21:23.750 --> 05:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of questions about
 
05:21:26.868 --> 05:21:26.878 align:start position:0%
what is a non-hazardous food versus a
 
05:21:28.788 --> 05:21:28.798 align:start position:0%
hazardous food
 
05:21:33.490 --> 05:21:33.500 align:start position:0%
um so this is from the DHHS website uh
 
05:21:35.990 --> 05:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
non-potentially hazardous food in your
 
05:21:37.788 --> 05:21:37.798 align:start position:0%
residential kitchen can be produced
 
05:21:40.310 --> 05:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
including but not limited to breads
 
05:21:43.250 --> 05:21:43.260 align:start position:0%
rolls muffins cookies brownies double
 
05:21:47.208 --> 05:21:47.218 align:start position:0%
crusted fruit pies fruit fruit pies uh
 
05:21:50.750 --> 05:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
candy and fudged uh packet package dry
 
05:21:53.150 --> 05:21:53.160 align:start position:0%
goods and jams and jellies anything
 
05:21:56.030 --> 05:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
really beyond that any uh certainly meat
 
05:21:58.128 --> 05:21:58.138 align:start position:0%
products or anything what is is a
 
05:21:59.868 --> 05:21:59.878 align:start position:0%
hazardous food
 
05:22:02.390 --> 05:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up please follow up and I'm
 
05:22:03.948 --> 05:22:03.958 align:start position:0%
sorry and it's so
 
05:22:06.708 --> 05:22:06.718 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm still not tracking what what is
 
05:22:08.570 --> 05:22:08.580 align:start position:0%
the trigger from going from a homestead
 
05:22:09.890 --> 05:22:09.900 align:start position:0%
to a commercial
 
05:22:13.490 --> 05:22:13.500 align:start position:0%
it is that that uh gross so well going
 
05:22:15.470 --> 05:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
to a commercial kitchen type when your
 
05:22:17.090 --> 05:22:17.100 align:start position:0%
your kitchen uh kicking in the
 
05:22:19.128 --> 05:22:19.138 align:start position:0%
commercial regulations that's when
 
05:22:22.190 --> 05:22:22.200 align:start position:0%
you're going to uh produce hazardous
 
05:22:24.830 --> 05:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
foods so that's where inspections
 
05:22:27.170 --> 05:22:27.180 align:start position:0%
commercial kitchen requirements are are
 
05:22:29.390 --> 05:22:29.400 align:start position:0%
uh expected thank you very much
 
05:22:29.400 --> 05:22:31.788 align:start position:0%
uh expected thank you very much
representative

05:22:31.788 --> 05:22:31.798 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:22:34.250 --> 05:22:34.260 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you Mr
 
05:22:36.530 --> 05:22:36.540 align:start position:0%
Conley I appreciate you coming in
 
05:22:38.690 --> 05:22:38.700 align:start position:0%
um two questions if the chair is going
 
05:22:39.910 --> 05:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
to allow it
 
05:22:42.530 --> 05:22:42.540 align:start position:0%
based on the information that you're
 
05:22:44.208 --> 05:22:44.218 align:start position:0%
aware of through the Institute of
 
05:22:46.390 --> 05:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
Justice would you say that New Hampshire
 
05:22:49.850 --> 05:22:49.860 align:start position:0%
is lagging other states on where this
 
05:22:51.230 --> 05:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
cap is set
 
05:22:54.110 --> 05:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question I I would
 
05:22:57.350 --> 05:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
say we can be much more competitive I I
 
05:22:57.360 --> 05:22:59.030 align:start position:0%
say we can be much more competitive I I
think

05:22:59.030 --> 05:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
think
 
05:23:01.310 --> 05:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
um and it's really in in my view it's
 
05:23:03.530 --> 05:23:03.540 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily A competitiveness
 
05:23:06.590 --> 05:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
it's just giving a little cushion to
 
05:23:08.330 --> 05:23:08.340 align:start position:0%
these people to just get their business
 
05:23:10.128 --> 05:23:10.138 align:start position:0%
off the ground
 
05:23:11.570 --> 05:23:11.580 align:start position:0%
um you know if we if we want to have
 
05:23:13.970 --> 05:23:13.980 align:start position:0%
more I New Hampshire we pride ourselves
 
05:23:16.010 --> 05:23:16.020 align:start position:0%
on the amount of small businesses small
 
05:23:18.410 --> 05:23:18.420 align:start position:0%
restaurants that that people start uh
 
05:23:21.530 --> 05:23:21.540 align:start position:0%
and and I think it would be a benefit to
 
05:23:24.830 --> 05:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
the entire state to just have that uh
 
05:23:28.190 --> 05:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
cushion be be grown so that we can have
 
05:23:31.070 --> 05:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
uh more people get into that that uh
 
05:23:32.690 --> 05:23:32.700 align:start position:0%
that industry and have more small
 
05:23:34.490 --> 05:23:34.500 align:start position:0%
businesses across the state thank you Mr
 
05:23:34.500 --> 05:23:35.650 align:start position:0%
businesses across the state thank you Mr
Colony

05:23:35.650 --> 05:23:35.660 align:start position:0%
Colony
 
05:23:37.970 --> 05:23:37.980 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
05:23:37.980 --> 05:23:38.628 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

05:23:38.628 --> 05:23:38.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:40.910 --> 05:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
so I I guess I'll because you brought it
 
05:23:41.868 --> 05:23:41.878 align:start position:0%
up I'm going to ask you the same
 
05:23:44.270 --> 05:23:44.280 align:start position:0%
question I asked Mr Nash so
 
05:23:46.610 --> 05:23:46.620 align:start position:0%
um if we were to develop a mechanism to
 
05:23:49.010 --> 05:23:49.020 align:start position:0%
tie this to inflation
 
05:23:51.230 --> 05:23:51.240 align:start position:0%
um my question would be and I don't need
 
05:23:52.610 --> 05:23:52.620 align:start position:0%
an answer today but if you want to
 
05:23:54.230 --> 05:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
provide a written answer to the to the
 
05:23:55.670 --> 05:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
committee at a later date after you've
 
05:23:57.830 --> 05:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
had more time to think about it is is
 
05:24:00.050 --> 05:24:00.060 align:start position:0%
what measure of inflation would you
 
05:24:01.490 --> 05:24:01.500 align:start position:0%
recommend right because you got the
 
05:24:04.430 --> 05:24:04.440 align:start position:0%
Minneapolis Federal Reserve you have the
 
05:24:07.010 --> 05:24:07.020 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Labor Statistics which gives a
 
05:24:10.010 --> 05:24:10.020 align:start position:0%
more New England uh type number with
 
05:24:12.170 --> 05:24:12.180 align:start position:0%
more more breakout than what Minneapolis
 
05:24:15.530 --> 05:24:15.540 align:start position:0%
Federal Reserve provides do you have a
 
05:24:17.570 --> 05:24:17.580 align:start position:0%
sense of of what would be a good
 
05:24:19.670 --> 05:24:19.680 align:start position:0%
Benchmark to tie it to
 
05:24:21.410 --> 05:24:21.420 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question it's a
 
05:24:24.230 --> 05:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
good question I I
 
05:24:26.750 --> 05:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
um I can get in more detail and follow
 
05:24:28.910 --> 05:24:28.920 align:start position:0%
up with the committee but you know
 
05:24:31.788 --> 05:24:31.798 align:start position:0%
generally tying things to CPI
 
05:24:36.230 --> 05:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
um is is how any sort of inflation uh
 
05:24:38.930 --> 05:24:38.940 align:start position:0%
tie to inflation works so whether that's
 
05:24:42.590 --> 05:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
where we're taking a regional uh CPI
 
05:24:45.890 --> 05:24:45.900 align:start position:0%
number or or across the country
 
05:24:47.628 --> 05:24:47.638 align:start position:0%
um you know I I think it'd be worth
 
05:24:51.708 --> 05:24:51.718 align:start position:0%
exploring and uh just just to see what
 
05:24:53.868 --> 05:24:53.878 align:start position:0%
would work best I guess great thank you
 
05:24:55.730 --> 05:24:55.740 align:start position:0%
Mr Conley thank you any other questions
 
05:24:58.310 --> 05:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
representative Doxie
 
05:25:00.650 --> 05:25:00.660 align:start position:0%
uh yes uh thank you for taking my
 
05:25:00.660 --> 05:25:02.030 align:start position:0%
uh yes uh thank you for taking my
question

05:25:02.030 --> 05:25:02.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:25:04.368 --> 05:25:04.378 align:start position:0%
um I'm getting a little confused here
 
05:25:08.208 --> 05:25:08.218 align:start position:0%
because what uh what I'm taking away is
 
05:25:11.990 --> 05:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
that the 35 000 triggers a hundred and
 
05:25:14.690 --> 05:25:14.700 align:start position:0%
fifty dollar license annually plus an
 
05:25:14.700 --> 05:25:16.250 align:start position:0%
fifty dollar license annually plus an
inspection

05:25:16.250 --> 05:25:16.260 align:start position:0%
inspection
 
05:25:18.830 --> 05:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
that Homestead kitchen can produce
 
05:25:21.410 --> 05:25:21.420 align:start position:0%
Revenue half a million dollars two
 
05:25:23.750 --> 05:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
million dollars the only thing that
 
05:25:27.410 --> 05:25:27.420 align:start position:0%
triggers another step in the commercial
 
05:25:29.628 --> 05:25:29.638 align:start position:0%
process is the fact that they grow
 
05:25:33.288 --> 05:25:33.298 align:start position:0%
outgrow their revenues and they outgrow
 
05:25:38.150 --> 05:25:38.160 align:start position:0%
capacity okay so Revenue how is revenue
 
05:25:41.090 --> 05:25:41.100 align:start position:0%
tied to the licensing if we're really
 
05:25:43.010 --> 05:25:43.020 align:start position:0%
only talking about a hundred and fifty
 
05:25:43.020 --> 05:25:43.970 align:start position:0%
only talking about a hundred and fifty
dollars

05:25:43.970 --> 05:25:43.980 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
05:25:45.350 --> 05:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
 
05:25:47.510 --> 05:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
representative I think and personally I
 
05:25:49.310 --> 05:25:49.320 align:start position:0%
think it's more about the incentive that
 
05:25:52.310 --> 05:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
it creates uh people when when they see
 
05:25:55.430 --> 05:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
more regulations or or more steps coming
 
05:25:57.470 --> 05:25:57.480 align:start position:0%
their way they might hesitate to grow
 
05:26:00.708 --> 05:26:00.718 align:start position:0%
their business uh you know whether it's
 
05:26:02.990 --> 05:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
enforced or not this is the the statute
 
05:26:06.230 --> 05:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
and the statute should reflect what
 
05:26:08.510 --> 05:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
these these business owners need the
 
05:26:08.520 --> 05:26:12.110 align:start position:0%
these these business owners need the
most

05:26:12.110 --> 05:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:14.330 --> 05:26:14.340 align:start position:0%
any any other questions from the
 
05:26:14.340 --> 05:26:15.948 align:start position:0%
any any other questions from the
committee

05:26:15.948 --> 05:26:15.958 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:26:17.810 --> 05:26:17.820 align:start position:0%
seeing none I want to thank you for your
 
05:26:19.128 --> 05:26:19.138 align:start position:0%
testimony this afternoon thank you very
 
05:26:20.930 --> 05:26:20.940 align:start position:0%

05:26:24.250 --> 05:26:24.260 align:start position:0%
anybody else wish to speak on this
 
05:26:27.410 --> 05:26:27.420 align:start position:0%
seeing none I would like to have the
 
05:26:33.170 --> 05:26:33.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:37.368 --> 05:26:37.378 align:start position:0%
yes thank you you're at 74.
 
05:26:39.410 --> 05:26:39.420 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
05:26:43.730 --> 05:26:43.740 align:start position:0%
on our blue sheep we had one two three
 
05:26:46.788 --> 05:26:46.798 align:start position:0%
four six people signing in in favor of
 
05:26:50.690 --> 05:26:50.700 align:start position:0%
this bill and one person against an
 
05:26:55.070 --> 05:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
online we had 74 people supporting this
 
05:26:57.890 --> 05:26:57.900 align:start position:0%
legislation proposed legislation with
 
05:26:59.810 --> 05:26:59.820 align:start position:0%
zero opposition
 
05:27:02.690 --> 05:27:02.700 align:start position:0%
with that I will close the hearing on
 
05:27:02.700 --> 05:27:05.390 align:start position:0%
with that I will close the hearing on
hb119

05:27:05.390 --> 05:27:05.400 align:start position:0%

05:27:29.270 --> 05:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:34.368 --> 05:27:34.378 align:start position:0%

Enterprise home kitchen operations and
 
05:27:46.010 --> 05:27:46.020 align:start position:0%
who do we have here to introduce this
 
05:27:46.020 --> 05:27:47.208 align:start position:0%
who do we have here to introduce this
bill

05:27:47.208 --> 05:27:47.218 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:27:49.310 --> 05:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
representative coulon
 
05:28:02.810 --> 05:28:02.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:05.208 --> 05:28:05.218 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you to
 
05:28:07.490 --> 05:28:07.500 align:start position:0%
my colleagues on the committee my name
 
05:28:10.250 --> 05:28:10.260 align:start position:0%
is Matt coulon representing Grafton 5
 
05:28:13.030 --> 05:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
and I'm here to introduce host Bill
 
05:28:16.070 --> 05:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
122. this bill defines Homestead food
 
05:28:18.610 --> 05:28:18.620 align:start position:0%
operations and provides Food Service
 
05:28:22.010 --> 05:28:22.020 align:start position:0%
licensing exemptions for them and I'll
 
05:28:23.570 --> 05:28:23.580 align:start position:0%
read the
 
05:28:26.868 --> 05:28:26.878 align:start position:0%
methodology back here to explain a
 
05:28:29.750 --> 05:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:31.430 --> 05:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:28:33.890 --> 05:28:33.900 align:start position:0%
this bill increases the homestead food
 
05:28:36.470 --> 05:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
operations threshold from a thirty five
 
05:28:38.390 --> 05:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars to fifty thousand
 
05:28:40.970 --> 05:28:40.980 align:start position:0%
dollars in annual gross sales entities
 
05:28:42.948 --> 05:28:42.958 align:start position:0%
selling less than the threshold amount
 
05:28:44.990 --> 05:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
are not subject to licensure and
 
05:28:48.190 --> 05:28:48.200 align:start position:0%
inspection requirements under RSA
 
05:28:51.110 --> 05:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
143a the Department of Health and Human
 
05:28:53.810 --> 05:28:53.820 align:start position:0%
Services states that since it does not
 
05:28:56.448 --> 05:28:56.458 align:start position:0%
track Homestead food operations by gross
 
05:28:58.850 --> 05:28:58.860 align:start position:0%
sales it is unable to determine how many
 
05:29:01.190 --> 05:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
establishments would no longer require
 
05:29:03.350 --> 05:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
inspections or pay the annual Food
 
05:29:05.570 --> 05:29:05.580 align:start position:0%
Service licensure fee
 
05:29:07.910 --> 05:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
the physical impact to the state general
 
05:29:10.670 --> 05:29:10.680 align:start position:0%
fund into which the fees are deposited
 
05:29:13.670 --> 05:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
is therefore indeterminable in addition
 
05:29:16.550 --> 05:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
the fee this bill amends the definition
 
05:29:19.250 --> 05:29:19.260 align:start position:0%
of a homestead food operation to allow
 
05:29:22.250 --> 05:29:22.260 align:start position:0%
for no more than 30 meals per day and 60
 
05:29:24.590 --> 05:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
meals per week to be served from a
 
05:29:27.170 --> 05:29:27.180 align:start position:0%
private home and removes any licensing
 
05:29:29.750 --> 05:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
requirements for these entities the
 
05:29:31.490 --> 05:29:31.500 align:start position:0%
department states that for safety
 
05:29:34.190 --> 05:29:34.200 align:start position:0%
reasons it does not currently allow male
 
05:29:36.170 --> 05:29:36.180 align:start position:0%
preparation of foods requiring
 
05:29:38.628 --> 05:29:38.638 align:start position:0%
temperature control and that there will
 
05:29:41.570 --> 05:29:41.580 align:start position:0%
be no Revenue loss from license fees in
 
05:29:43.788 --> 05:29:43.798 align:start position:0%
this instance since the operations are
 
05:29:48.650 --> 05:29:48.660 align:start position:0%
not currently allowed or licensed and I
 
05:29:53.270 --> 05:29:53.280 align:start position:0%
will yield and open up to the testimony
 
05:29:55.490 --> 05:29:55.500 align:start position:0%
thank you representative coulon any
 
05:29:55.500 --> 05:29:58.250 align:start position:0%
thank you representative coulon any
questions

05:29:58.250 --> 05:29:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:00.470 --> 05:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
I have a question
 
05:30:04.010 --> 05:30:04.020 align:start position:0%
um so with this bill
 
05:30:08.990 --> 05:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
if we had passed uh the previous bill
 
05:30:12.470 --> 05:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
and raised the threshold to 70 000.
 
05:30:14.570 --> 05:30:14.580 align:start position:0%
would that be out of sync with what
 
05:30:16.490 --> 05:30:16.500 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with here
 
05:30:16.500 --> 05:30:18.050 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with here
of

05:30:18.050 --> 05:30:18.060 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:30:20.390 --> 05:30:20.400 align:start position:0%
um this was asking to raise the
 
05:30:23.390 --> 05:30:23.400 align:start position:0%
threshold to 50 000 from twenty thousand
 
05:30:26.810 --> 05:30:26.820 align:start position:0%
yep I would save those questions for the
 
05:30:28.610 --> 05:30:28.620 align:start position:0%
uh testimony
 
05:30:30.948 --> 05:30:30.958 align:start position:0%
for the person coming after okay thank
 
05:30:33.170 --> 05:30:33.180 align:start position:0%
you appreciate that
 
05:30:35.208 --> 05:30:35.218 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
05:30:37.430 --> 05:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'd like to call Colleen
 
05:30:41.390 --> 05:30:41.400 align:start position:0%
Smith from DHHS to speak on this
 
05:30:52.610 --> 05:30:52.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:54.530 --> 05:30:54.540 align:start position:0%
good afternoon for the record my name is
 
05:30:56.270 --> 05:30:56.280 align:start position:0%
Colleen Smith I'm with the Department of
 
05:30:57.530 --> 05:30:57.540 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services food
 
05:31:00.230 --> 05:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
protection section the department is
 
05:31:02.510 --> 05:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
currently is opposed to the house bill
 
05:31:05.628 --> 05:31:05.638 align:start position:0%
122 as as currently written
 
05:31:09.590 --> 05:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
Our concern is this bill allows the
 
05:31:11.628 --> 05:31:11.638 align:start position:0%
expands what's allowed in a homestead
 
05:31:14.690 --> 05:31:14.700 align:start position:0%
food operation to prepare 30 meals per
 
05:31:17.390 --> 05:31:17.400 align:start position:0%
day and not more than 60 meals per week
 
05:31:20.628 --> 05:31:20.638 align:start position:0%
as in previous testimony the current
 
05:31:22.250 --> 05:31:22.260 align:start position:0%
current laws for Homestead food
 
05:31:24.650 --> 05:31:24.660 align:start position:0%
operations do allow the production of
 
05:31:26.750 --> 05:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
non-potentially hazardous foods which
 
05:31:29.750 --> 05:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
are limited to cookies breads jams and
 
05:31:33.650 --> 05:31:33.660 align:start position:0%
jellies we currently have 133 of these
 
05:31:35.570 --> 05:31:35.580 align:start position:0%
licensed in the state
 
05:31:39.410 --> 05:31:39.420 align:start position:0%
are concerned with expanding this is it
 
05:31:41.948 --> 05:31:41.958 align:start position:0%
does go against our food code which
 
05:31:46.250 --> 05:31:46.260 align:start position:0%
considers a homestead the homestead in
 
05:31:47.750 --> 05:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
the food code it's not it's not
 
05:31:49.850 --> 05:31:49.860 align:start position:0%
recognized we do in state allow
 
05:31:52.190 --> 05:31:52.200 align:start position:0%
homesteads but we've restricted to those
 
05:31:55.850 --> 05:31:55.860 align:start position:0%
that are of less concern to food safety
 
05:31:58.490 --> 05:31:58.500 align:start position:0%
risk this this would Bill if passed
 
05:32:01.190 --> 05:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
would change that dramatically by
 
05:32:03.590 --> 05:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
allowing essentially a restaurant could
 
05:32:05.930 --> 05:32:05.940 align:start position:0%
be run in a home kitchen if it was meant
 
05:32:08.090 --> 05:32:08.100 align:start position:0%
to have those meal restrictions
 
05:32:10.550 --> 05:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
the bill doesn't allow us any inspection
 
05:32:12.170 --> 05:32:12.180 align:start position:0%
or enforcement so there would be no
 
05:32:14.330 --> 05:32:14.340 align:start position:0%
essentially no oversight that those
 
05:32:16.310 --> 05:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
limits were being made and attained
 
05:32:18.948 --> 05:32:18.958 align:start position:0%
there's also concern that this could go
 
05:32:22.850 --> 05:32:22.860 align:start position:0%
against local zoning restrictions or
 
05:32:25.910 --> 05:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
other regulations of other departments
 
05:32:28.190 --> 05:32:28.200 align:start position:0%
considering Plumbing septic
 
05:32:30.530 --> 05:32:30.540 align:start position:0%
considerations that would be looked at
 
05:32:33.250 --> 05:32:33.260 align:start position:0%
should this legislation pass
 
05:32:36.470 --> 05:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
we are concerned with that again
 
05:32:38.270 --> 05:32:38.280 align:start position:0%
expanding of the types of foods that
 
05:32:40.128 --> 05:32:40.138 align:start position:0%
could be allowed in a home kitchen there
 
05:32:43.030 --> 05:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
have been historical outbreaks with food
 
05:32:45.770 --> 05:32:45.780 align:start position:0%
due to a home kitchen doesn't
 
05:32:47.990 --> 05:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily have the ability with a
 
05:32:49.190 --> 05:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
commercial with a Residential
 
05:32:51.350 --> 05:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
Refrigerator to cool Foods properly
 
05:32:53.868 --> 05:32:53.878 align:start position:0%
there have been outbreaks associated
 
05:32:56.750 --> 05:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
with improperly cooled Foods this again
 
05:32:59.410 --> 05:32:59.420 align:start position:0%
could allow the door to open to to
 
05:33:01.670 --> 05:33:01.680 align:start position:0%
Future outbreaks and increase in
 
05:33:03.770 --> 05:33:03.780 align:start position:0%
foodborne illness I'd be happy to take
 
05:33:06.708 --> 05:33:06.718 align:start position:0%
any questions the committee has
 
05:33:10.010 --> 05:33:10.020 align:start position:0%
representative verval
 
05:33:12.110 --> 05:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
thank you welcome back
 
05:33:12.120 --> 05:33:13.070 align:start position:0%
thank you welcome back
um

05:33:13.070 --> 05:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:33:15.230 --> 05:33:15.240 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if you have the the bill
 
05:33:17.570 --> 05:33:17.580 align:start position:0%
in front of you but I'm looking at page
 
05:33:19.788 --> 05:33:19.798 align:start position:0%
three and
 
05:33:19.798 --> 05:33:20.390 align:start position:0%
three and
um

05:33:20.390 --> 05:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:33:23.570 --> 05:33:23.580 align:start position:0%
I'm starting uh about a quarter of the
 
05:33:26.810 --> 05:33:26.820 align:start position:0%
way through line 27 local law
 
05:33:30.110 --> 05:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement May decrease the limit of
 
05:33:32.208 --> 05:33:32.218 align:start position:0%
the number of individual meals prepared
 
05:33:34.250 --> 05:33:34.260 align:start position:0%
based on food preparation capacity of
 
05:33:35.690 --> 05:33:35.700 align:start position:0%
the operation
 
05:33:37.730 --> 05:33:37.740 align:start position:0%
but shall not in any case increase the
 
05:33:39.948 --> 05:33:39.958 align:start position:0%
limit of the number of individual meals
 
05:33:39.958 --> 05:33:41.050 align:start position:0%
limit of the number of individual meals
prepared

05:33:41.050 --> 05:33:41.060 align:start position:0%
prepared
 
05:33:45.128 --> 05:33:45.138 align:start position:0%
so it seems to me that this bill has
 
05:33:48.470 --> 05:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
built-in local control local law
 
05:33:50.330 --> 05:33:50.340 align:start position:0%
enforcement I would assume could run the
 
05:33:53.570 --> 05:33:53.580 align:start position:0%
number down to zero and prohibit this
 
05:33:55.430 --> 05:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
activity from taking place in a
 
05:33:56.868 --> 05:33:56.878 align:start position:0%
community would you agree with that
 
05:33:59.448 --> 05:33:59.458 align:start position:0%
assessment or am I an error
 
05:34:02.750 --> 05:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
so that build that you are corrected
 
05:34:04.610 --> 05:34:04.620 align:start position:0%
does have that provision that would be
 
05:34:07.128 --> 05:34:07.138 align:start position:0%
if that Community had the resources and
 
05:34:09.770 --> 05:34:09.780 align:start position:0%
could effectively enforce that it
 
05:34:11.330 --> 05:34:11.340 align:start position:0%
wouldn't give the department any
 
05:34:14.090 --> 05:34:14.100 align:start position:0%
oversight into if the standards or if
 
05:34:16.070 --> 05:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
those meal thresher holds were being
 
05:34:17.930 --> 05:34:17.940 align:start position:0%
maintained it would it would it would
 
05:34:20.270 --> 05:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
rely on local law enforcement to to pick
 
05:34:22.490 --> 05:34:22.500 align:start position:0%
up that work
 
05:34:26.810 --> 05:34:26.820 align:start position:0%
does that follow-up sure so
 
05:34:29.930 --> 05:34:29.940 align:start position:0%
so law enforcement has the the authority
 
05:34:33.470 --> 05:34:33.480 align:start position:0%
to do uh to enforce local ordinances and
 
05:34:35.270 --> 05:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
so it would be a local ordinance that
 
05:34:37.430 --> 05:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
could limit the production and could
 
05:34:40.550 --> 05:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
limit it down to zero so uh it seems to
 
05:34:43.070 --> 05:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
me that a community could very easily
 
05:34:46.128 --> 05:34:46.138 align:start position:0%
disallow this activity if it chose to by
 
05:34:48.288 --> 05:34:48.298 align:start position:0%
running the the number to to zero is
 
05:34:50.628 --> 05:34:50.638 align:start position:0%
that I mean I agree it doesn't give your
 
05:34:52.970 --> 05:34:52.980 align:start position:0%
your department authority to oversee it
 
05:34:54.708 --> 05:34:54.718 align:start position:0%
but it seems to me there's an escape
 
05:34:56.570 --> 05:34:56.580 align:start position:0%
clause for any Community by simply
 
05:34:58.550 --> 05:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
running the number to zero is that do
 
05:34:59.930 --> 05:34:59.940 align:start position:0%
you agree with that I disagree with that
 
05:35:02.090 --> 05:35:02.100 align:start position:0%
I believe that that you're correct the
 
05:35:04.010 --> 05:35:04.020 align:start position:0%
legislation does have a provision for a
 
05:35:06.708 --> 05:35:06.718 align:start position:0%
local of local law enforcement to have
 
05:35:10.010 --> 05:35:10.020 align:start position:0%
that ability thank you thank you
 
05:35:12.530 --> 05:35:12.540 align:start position:0%
representative germana thank you very
 
05:35:14.208 --> 05:35:14.218 align:start position:0%
much Madam chair thank you for taking my
 
05:35:17.750 --> 05:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
question compared to your office at the
 
05:35:20.030 --> 05:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
state level how well prepared do you
 
05:35:21.890 --> 05:35:21.900 align:start position:0%
think local law enforcement agents
 
05:35:23.628 --> 05:35:23.638 align:start position:0%
across the state are going to be to
 
05:35:26.570 --> 05:35:26.580 align:start position:0%
evaluate the suitability of the
 
05:35:28.190 --> 05:35:28.200 align:start position:0%
arrangements in any particular food
 
05:35:28.200 --> 05:35:29.750 align:start position:0%
arrangements in any particular food
establishment

05:35:29.750 --> 05:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
establishment
 
05:35:33.050 --> 05:35:33.060 align:start position:0%
I I can't comment on the ability of
 
05:35:35.448 --> 05:35:35.458 align:start position:0%
local law enforcement's ability to
 
05:35:38.030 --> 05:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
assess what would constitute a meal and
 
05:35:40.490 --> 05:35:40.500 align:start position:0%
if if they were if they were exceeding
 
05:35:43.310 --> 05:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
that 30 meal per day threshold as as
 
05:35:46.930 --> 05:35:46.940 align:start position:0%
laid out in this bill
 
05:35:49.788 --> 05:35:49.798 align:start position:0%
follow-up uh and I'm also I'm wondering
 
05:35:51.650 --> 05:35:51.660 align:start position:0%
if uh that if you would say the same
 
05:35:54.070 --> 05:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
thing about uh their ability to accept
 
05:35:56.810 --> 05:35:56.820 align:start position:0%
assess potential safety concerns
 
05:35:58.970 --> 05:35:58.980 align:start position:0%
regarding the storage of food for
 
05:35:58.980 --> 05:36:00.590 align:start position:0%
regarding the storage of food for
example

05:36:00.590 --> 05:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
example
 
05:36:03.110 --> 05:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
I am not familiar with the to the food
 
05:36:05.390 --> 05:36:05.400 align:start position:0%
safety training is of local law enforce
 
05:36:09.410 --> 05:36:09.420 align:start position:0%
enforcement is I I I would um our our
 
05:36:11.868 --> 05:36:11.878 align:start position:0%
agency again is is charged with with
 
05:36:14.330 --> 05:36:14.340 align:start position:0%
food safety in in the state so I can
 
05:36:17.030 --> 05:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
only comment on on our abilities to
 
05:36:18.590 --> 05:36:18.600 align:start position:0%
assess that
 
05:36:20.750 --> 05:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
I have a question
 
05:36:24.288 --> 05:36:24.298 align:start position:0%
do does our local Health officers do
 
05:36:26.990 --> 05:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
they take any food safety uh training at
 
05:36:27.000 --> 05:36:27.708 align:start position:0%
they take any food safety uh training at
all

05:36:27.708 --> 05:36:27.718 align:start position:0%
all
 
05:36:31.010 --> 05:36:31.020 align:start position:0%
so in New Hampshire there are 15 cities
 
05:36:33.110 --> 05:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
and towns that do have their own health
 
05:36:35.570 --> 05:36:35.580 align:start position:0%
and health inspector that is responsible
 
05:36:37.610 --> 05:36:37.620 align:start position:0%
for food licensing and inspecting food
 
05:36:40.788 --> 05:36:40.798 align:start position:0%
establishments and the other 219 towns
 
05:36:43.430 --> 05:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
it's not uh it's not their primary
 
05:36:45.890 --> 05:36:45.900 align:start position:0%
responsibility or are they required to
 
05:36:48.170 --> 05:36:48.180 align:start position:0%
be to have food safety training
 
05:36:48.180 --> 05:36:49.670 align:start position:0%
be to have food safety training
specifically

05:36:49.670 --> 05:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
05:36:52.128 --> 05:36:52.138 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:36:54.650 --> 05:36:54.660 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby yes thank you for
 
05:36:56.930 --> 05:36:56.940 align:start position:0%
taking my question so
 
05:36:56.940 --> 05:36:58.070 align:start position:0%
taking my question so
um

05:36:58.070 --> 05:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:36:58.080 --> 05:36:59.390 align:start position:0%
um
on

05:36:59.390 --> 05:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:37:03.288 --> 05:37:03.298 align:start position:0%
uh under your reading of this bill if uh
 
05:37:06.230 --> 05:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
would uh the health departments in
 
05:37:08.570 --> 05:37:08.580 align:start position:0%
self-inspecting communities have the
 
05:37:10.310 --> 05:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
capacity to
 
05:37:13.610 --> 05:37:13.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:16.490 --> 05:37:16.500 align:start position:0%
so the the self-inspecting community
 
05:37:19.070 --> 05:37:19.080 align:start position:0%
communities they have they have the
 
05:37:20.868 --> 05:37:20.878 align:start position:0%
ability to make more restrictive
 
05:37:23.208 --> 05:37:23.218 align:start position:0%
regulations when it comes to home-based
 
05:37:25.070 --> 05:37:25.080 align:start position:0%
kitchens so many of even though it's
 
05:37:26.930 --> 05:37:26.940 align:start position:0%
allowed at the state level there are
 
05:37:28.970 --> 05:37:28.980 align:start position:0%
many of them that already do not even
 
05:37:31.368 --> 05:37:31.378 align:start position:0%
allow the non-potentially hazardous
 
05:37:34.730 --> 05:37:34.740 align:start position:0%
foods to be made in home home kitchens
 
05:37:36.470 --> 05:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
05:37:39.230 --> 05:37:39.240 align:start position:0%
representative burlog
 
05:37:41.690 --> 05:37:41.700 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh you said you
 
05:37:45.830 --> 05:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
had uh information regarding uh
 
05:37:47.750 --> 05:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
past instances of food and board
 
05:37:49.430 --> 05:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
illnesses with these magnitude
 
05:37:50.990 --> 05:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
operations do you happen to have the
 
05:37:54.230 --> 05:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
percentage and and also the percentage
 
05:37:57.050 --> 05:37:57.060 align:start position:0%
compared to that of a commercial uh
 
05:37:57.060 --> 05:37:59.150 align:start position:0%
compared to that of a commercial uh
industry

05:37:59.150 --> 05:37:59.160 align:start position:0%
industry
 
05:38:02.270 --> 05:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
so I uh are my my full testimony has
 
05:38:04.070 --> 05:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
been sent to the committee and I did
 
05:38:06.910 --> 05:38:06.920 align:start position:0%
provide an instance of a recent outbreak
 
05:38:10.910 --> 05:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
it is so since that since home food
 
05:38:15.288 --> 05:38:15.298 align:start position:0%
production to other to others Beyond
 
05:38:17.150 --> 05:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
um you know family members is not
 
05:38:19.070 --> 05:38:19.080 align:start position:0%
currently allowed of non-potential or
 
05:38:21.530 --> 05:38:21.540 align:start position:0%
potentially hazardous foods there isn't
 
05:38:23.990 --> 05:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
that specific data available versus a
 
05:38:25.730 --> 05:38:25.740 align:start position:0%
commercial establishment because that's
 
05:38:30.110 --> 05:38:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:32.150 --> 05:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby
 
05:38:37.128 --> 05:38:37.138 align:start position:0%
so uh if a licensed establishment uh if
 
05:38:39.288 --> 05:38:39.298 align:start position:0%
you receive a complaint about a licensed
 
05:38:41.570 --> 05:38:41.580 align:start position:0%
establishment having given someone food
 
05:38:44.868 --> 05:38:44.878 align:start position:0%
poisoning you have the authority to go
 
05:38:46.970 --> 05:38:46.980 align:start position:0%
in there and inspect and figure out what
 
05:38:48.050 --> 05:38:48.060 align:start position:0%
went wrong
 
05:38:50.030 --> 05:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
under this bill would you have that
 
05:38:50.040 --> 05:38:51.350 align:start position:0%
under this bill would you have that
Authority

05:38:51.350 --> 05:38:51.360 align:start position:0%
Authority
 
05:38:53.330 --> 05:38:53.340 align:start position:0%
or a homestead kitchen
 
05:38:55.670 --> 05:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
so I do not believe that there's any
 
05:38:59.690 --> 05:38:59.700 align:start position:0%
provision in the bill as written for us
 
05:39:02.208 --> 05:39:02.218 align:start position:0%
to do any type of outbreak investigation
 
05:39:04.610 --> 05:39:04.620 align:start position:0%
or foodborne illness investigation
 
05:39:07.610 --> 05:39:07.620 align:start position:0%
should there be a complaint associated
 
05:39:12.890 --> 05:39:12.900 align:start position:0%
with the homes based kitchen thank you
 
05:39:15.708 --> 05:39:15.718 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
05:39:18.230 --> 05:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
representative verville thank you madam
 
05:39:19.670 --> 05:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
chair just to drill down on that a
 
05:39:21.288 --> 05:39:21.298 align:start position:0%
little bit more
 
05:39:21.298 --> 05:39:22.070 align:start position:0%
little bit more
um

05:39:22.070 --> 05:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:39:24.590 --> 05:39:24.600 align:start position:0%
so if if a homestead establishment is
 
05:39:26.448 --> 05:39:26.458 align:start position:0%
selling meals it's you know it's a it's
 
05:39:28.010 --> 05:39:28.020 align:start position:0%
a commercial operation to a certain
 
05:39:30.050 --> 05:39:30.060 align:start position:0%
extent right it's a it's a retail Food
 
05:39:32.030 --> 05:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
Outlet in in that it's a kitchen
 
05:39:34.490 --> 05:39:34.500 align:start position:0%
producing food the question is for the
 
05:39:37.010 --> 05:39:37.020 align:start position:0%
the person testifying
 
05:39:41.150 --> 05:39:41.160 align:start position:0%
so if you've got a report of of food
 
05:39:42.948 --> 05:39:42.958 align:start position:0%
poisoning from from an establishment
 
05:39:45.050 --> 05:39:45.060 align:start position:0%
under this are you saying there's no
 
05:39:47.690 --> 05:39:47.700 align:start position:0%
other provision in current law or rules
 
05:39:49.430 --> 05:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
that would allow an investigation of
 
05:39:49.440 --> 05:39:50.990 align:start position:0%
that would allow an investigation of
that

05:39:50.990 --> 05:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:39:54.250 --> 05:39:54.260 align:start position:0%
that you're aware of that I'm aware of
 
05:39:56.868 --> 05:39:56.878 align:start position:0%
this would this would exempt them from
 
05:40:00.288 --> 05:40:00.298 align:start position:0%
our regulation so I would with there
 
05:40:03.288 --> 05:40:03.298 align:start position:0%
might be other statutory considerations
 
05:40:05.990 --> 05:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
in our Disease Control statutes if there
 
05:40:08.810 --> 05:40:08.820 align:start position:0%
was was a public health hazard linked to
 
05:40:11.090 --> 05:40:11.100 align:start position:0%
it but that that I can't speak to at
 
05:40:13.250 --> 05:40:13.260 align:start position:0%
this time I can certainly research that
 
05:40:15.470 --> 05:40:15.480 align:start position:0%
and let you know I I would appreciate
 
05:40:17.090 --> 05:40:17.100 align:start position:0%
that thank you for your testimony thank
 
05:40:18.350 --> 05:40:18.360 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
 
05:40:20.628 --> 05:40:20.638 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
05:40:24.050 --> 05:40:24.060 align:start position:0%
representative Potenza
 
05:40:27.050 --> 05:40:27.060 align:start position:0%
so just uh to clarify I would assume
 
05:40:28.310 --> 05:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
that the
 
05:40:30.170 --> 05:40:30.180 align:start position:0%
um the health department or the the
 
05:40:30.180 --> 05:40:31.190 align:start position:0%
um the health department or the the
local

05:40:31.190 --> 05:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
local
 
05:40:33.350 --> 05:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
let's say for example example we had our
 
05:40:36.110 --> 05:40:36.120 align:start position:0%
business in the city of Concord those uh
 
05:40:40.010 --> 05:40:40.020 align:start position:0%
those laws would Trump this correct
 
05:40:42.350 --> 05:40:42.360 align:start position:0%
so their laws are regulations in a sense
 
05:40:44.948 --> 05:40:44.958 align:start position:0%
so I believe this bill allows local
 
05:40:48.948 --> 05:40:48.958 align:start position:0%
locals to uh to have other regulation to
 
05:40:52.190 --> 05:40:52.200 align:start position:0%
opt out of of this okay Bill
 
05:40:56.090 --> 05:40:56.100 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up so
 
05:40:58.490 --> 05:40:58.500 align:start position:0%
there's one piece that's that's talked
 
05:41:00.410 --> 05:41:00.420 align:start position:0%
about here and I don't know it's just
 
05:41:02.750 --> 05:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
being missed this is only for same day
 
05:41:05.868 --> 05:41:05.878 align:start position:0%
so this Homesteader has to produce these
 
05:41:07.970 --> 05:41:07.980 align:start position:0%
meals and serve those meals and they're
 
05:41:09.530 --> 05:41:09.540 align:start position:0%
eaten within the same day it's not like
 
05:41:12.288 --> 05:41:12.298 align:start position:0%
they could be eaten at you know the a
 
05:41:14.208 --> 05:41:14.218 align:start position:0%
week later or something like that so
 
05:41:16.970 --> 05:41:16.980 align:start position:0%
doesn't that make a difference so the
 
05:41:19.850 --> 05:41:19.860 align:start position:0%
the bill is written does provide a
 
05:41:21.948 --> 05:41:21.958 align:start position:0%
little confusion and I did mention that
 
05:41:24.050 --> 05:41:24.060 align:start position:0%
in our testimony in a technical defect
 
05:41:27.590 --> 05:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
because it it inserts uh a homestead
 
05:41:29.690 --> 05:41:29.700 align:start position:0%
into the definition of of a food service
 
05:41:32.690 --> 05:41:32.700 align:start position:0%
establishment which means a whole set of
 
05:41:36.050 --> 05:41:36.060 align:start position:0%
other requirements fall to them but then
 
05:41:37.730 --> 05:41:37.740 align:start position:0%
it also
 
05:41:40.550 --> 05:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
it still maintains the provisions of
 
05:41:42.170 --> 05:41:42.180 align:start position:0%
what our current homesteaders are
 
05:41:43.490 --> 05:41:43.500 align:start position:0%
allowed where they're allowed to make
 
05:41:46.010 --> 05:41:46.020 align:start position:0%
foods that can be consumed later such as
 
05:41:49.490 --> 05:41:49.500 align:start position:0%
a jam or jelly or cookie or muffin so it
 
05:41:51.770 --> 05:41:51.780 align:start position:0%
it does provide some some confusion
 
05:41:54.350 --> 05:41:54.360 align:start position:0%
because of the way the the bill is
 
05:41:54.360 --> 05:41:57.050 align:start position:0%
because of the way the the bill is
worded

05:41:57.050 --> 05:41:57.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:59.330 --> 05:41:59.340 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
05:42:01.190 --> 05:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
05:42:03.890 --> 05:42:03.900 align:start position:0%
testimony appreciate it and I'll call up
 
05:42:05.868 --> 05:42:05.878 align:start position:0%
Stephen Nass
 
05:42:11.330 --> 05:42:11.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:13.670 --> 05:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me thank you for
 
05:42:16.010 --> 05:42:16.020 align:start position:0%
allowing me to testify again here uh
 
05:42:18.170 --> 05:42:18.180 align:start position:0%
I'll try and be really brief uh this
 
05:42:21.410 --> 05:42:21.420 align:start position:0%
bill is actually based off of operations
 
05:42:24.530 --> 05:42:24.540 align:start position:0%
in other states uh California for
 
05:42:28.190 --> 05:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
example uh despite being a state well
 
05:42:30.770 --> 05:42:30.780 align:start position:0%
known for having uh heavy regulatory
 
05:42:32.750 --> 05:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
process on the food industry and just
 
05:42:35.270 --> 05:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
Industries in general uh is actually way
 
05:42:37.490 --> 05:42:37.500 align:start position:0%
ahead of us on these sorts of operations
 
05:42:39.410 --> 05:42:39.420 align:start position:0%
and I think there's been some confusion
 
05:42:42.590 --> 05:42:42.600 align:start position:0%
today about the sort of uh operations
 
05:42:44.930 --> 05:42:44.940 align:start position:0%
that are that this is trying to allow in
 
05:42:46.850 --> 05:42:46.860 align:start position:0%
the state I think put uh representative
 
05:42:49.250 --> 05:42:49.260 align:start position:0%
Potenza kind of hit hit on it a little
 
05:42:51.890 --> 05:42:51.900 align:start position:0%
bit but uh an example that I want you to
 
05:42:53.868 --> 05:42:53.878 align:start position:0%
think of uh if any of you have traveled
 
05:42:57.170 --> 05:42:57.180 align:start position:0%
in the South or out west would be uh the
 
05:42:58.670 --> 05:42:58.680 align:start position:0%
sort of people that are stay-at-home
 
05:43:02.090 --> 05:43:02.100 align:start position:0%
moms or just uh operating at home and
 
05:43:04.128 --> 05:43:04.138 align:start position:0%
maybe they're filling a cooler full of
 
05:43:06.590 --> 05:43:06.600 align:start position:0%
uh tamales and bringing them to a local
 
05:43:08.810 --> 05:43:08.820 align:start position:0%
business and dishing them out to the
 
05:43:10.550 --> 05:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
same customers every week this is the
 
05:43:12.830 --> 05:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
sort of operations uh that we're looking
 
05:43:14.570 --> 05:43:14.580 align:start position:0%
for here where it's it's going to be
 
05:43:17.390 --> 05:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
primarily people selling a very small
 
05:43:20.330 --> 05:43:20.340 align:start position:0%
amount of product it is same day served
 
05:43:23.570 --> 05:43:23.580 align:start position:0%
hot uh directly to the consumer and uh
 
05:43:25.190 --> 05:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
that that's really what we're trying to
 
05:43:28.490 --> 05:43:28.500 align:start position:0%
cover here and as far as the
 
05:43:31.730 --> 05:43:31.740 align:start position:0%
uh enforcement on the local level uh
 
05:43:35.030 --> 05:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
that is uh what we'd be looking at is uh
 
05:43:37.128 --> 05:43:37.138 align:start position:0%
towns and cities making their own rules
 
05:43:39.708 --> 05:43:39.718 align:start position:0%
on exactly what they want to do and uh
 
05:43:42.170 --> 05:43:42.180 align:start position:0%
decentralizing it from having the state
 
05:43:44.990 --> 05:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement of it and I've uh worked a
 
05:43:47.030 --> 05:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
bit in Massachusetts and that's what I
 
05:43:49.610 --> 05:43:49.620 align:start position:0%
saw a lot more of was the local towns
 
05:43:52.368 --> 05:43:52.378 align:start position:0%
having a lot more of a say and in the
 
05:43:55.250 --> 05:43:55.260 align:start position:0%
inspection process and uh regulatory
 
05:43:58.490 --> 05:43:58.500 align:start position:0%
aspects of these smaller kitchens thank
 
05:44:01.128 --> 05:44:01.138 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative NAB
 
05:44:02.570 --> 05:44:02.580 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
05:44:04.548 --> 05:44:04.558 align:start position:0%
taking my question so I just want to
 
05:44:06.048 --> 05:44:06.058 align:start position:0%
clarify it is deliberate that you're
 
05:44:08.690 --> 05:44:08.700 align:start position:0%
taking control away from HHS and putting
 
05:44:10.850 --> 05:44:10.860 align:start position:0%
it on to local police officers yes it is
 
05:44:13.670 --> 05:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
yeah Health Inspectors yes it is and uh
 
05:44:15.350 --> 05:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
yeah and like I said that's based off of
 
05:44:19.310 --> 05:44:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:21.110 --> 05:44:21.120 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby
 
05:44:24.470 --> 05:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
so do other states have the police in
 
05:44:26.510 --> 05:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
charge of this or do they have the local
 
05:44:29.750 --> 05:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
Health Department in charge of this uh
 
05:44:32.330 --> 05:44:32.340 align:start position:0%
typically it would be under the
 
05:44:34.070 --> 05:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of like the local Town
 
05:44:36.470 --> 05:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
Council who would then delegate it
 
05:44:39.770 --> 05:44:39.780 align:start position:0%
either to a worker that's an inspector
 
05:44:42.048 --> 05:44:42.058 align:start position:0%
or the police or whoever it's like it's
 
05:44:45.110 --> 05:44:45.120 align:start position:0%
a big variety but it's like the uh the
 
05:44:46.970 --> 05:44:46.980 align:start position:0%
city government the town government
 
05:44:48.770 --> 05:44:48.780 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:44:51.650 --> 05:44:51.660 align:start position:0%
representative Potenza
 
05:44:53.330 --> 05:44:53.340 align:start position:0%
would you say that this is really
 
05:44:57.170 --> 05:44:57.180 align:start position:0%
helping out the the smaller towns and so
 
05:45:01.208 --> 05:45:01.218 align:start position:0%
there's less of that um burden with the
 
05:45:04.368 --> 05:45:04.378 align:start position:0%
DHHS and so it's more that local control
 
05:45:05.690 --> 05:45:05.700 align:start position:0%
because this really kind of doesn't
 
05:45:07.730 --> 05:45:07.740 align:start position:0%
apply in the cities I'd say
 
05:45:10.010 --> 05:45:10.020 align:start position:0%
yes thank you yeah it it would really
 
05:45:12.830 --> 05:45:12.840 align:start position:0%
apply uh yeah it would help out a lot of
 
05:45:14.150 --> 05:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
the smaller towns that are a little bit
 
05:45:15.770 --> 05:45:15.780 align:start position:0%
more impoverished than the bigger cities
 
05:45:17.690 --> 05:45:17.700 align:start position:0%
uh where there's a lot more opportunity
 
05:45:20.750 --> 05:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
and uh like I said it's it's a lot of
 
05:45:22.368 --> 05:45:22.378 align:start position:0%
people that might be stay-at-home moms
 
05:45:24.110 --> 05:45:24.120 align:start position:0%
looking for a little bit of extra income
 
05:45:26.868 --> 05:45:26.878 align:start position:0%
uh maybe whatever food they're feeding
 
05:45:28.368 --> 05:45:28.378 align:start position:0%
their family or whatever family dish
 
05:45:30.470 --> 05:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
that they're really uh have been making
 
05:45:31.850 --> 05:45:31.860 align:start position:0%
that's maybe has been passed down from
 
05:45:33.770 --> 05:45:33.780 align:start position:0%
generation to generation and they're
 
05:45:35.150 --> 05:45:35.160 align:start position:0%
just they know how to make it in big
 
05:45:37.190 --> 05:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
batches for their extended family and
 
05:45:38.510 --> 05:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
they're just expanding that operation
 
05:45:40.910 --> 05:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
into their community and it gives them a
 
05:45:44.090 --> 05:45:44.100 align:start position:0%
little bit of extra Revenue stream there
 
05:45:46.670 --> 05:45:46.680 align:start position:0%
representative germana thank you madam
 
05:45:48.110 --> 05:45:48.120 align:start position:0%
chair and uh thank you good to see you
 
05:45:50.990 --> 05:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
again thank you for taking my question
 
05:45:52.250 --> 05:45:52.260 align:start position:0%
um again I'm going to ask a question
 
05:45:54.530 --> 05:45:54.540 align:start position:0%
about these amounts are determined how
 
05:45:57.350 --> 05:45:57.360 align:start position:0%
they're Quantified from 20 000 to 50 000
 
05:46:00.288 --> 05:46:00.298 align:start position:0%
you've given some examples that I think
 
05:46:02.330 --> 05:46:02.340 align:start position:0%
that you know we can all get on boards
 
05:46:04.190 --> 05:46:04.200 align:start position:0%
if there's anyone else specifically can
 
05:46:06.590 --> 05:46:06.600 align:start position:0%
testify to give us a specific example of
 
05:46:08.930 --> 05:46:08.940 align:start position:0%
why this twenty thousand dollars is not
 
05:46:10.670 --> 05:46:10.680 align:start position:0%
adequate why it's fifty thousand it's
 
05:46:12.410 --> 05:46:12.420 align:start position:0%
not forty thousand it's not a hundred
 
05:46:14.448 --> 05:46:14.458 align:start position:0%
thousand so could you give me specif
 
05:46:16.970 --> 05:46:16.980 align:start position:0%
give us specifics as opposed to
 
05:46:18.890 --> 05:46:18.900 align:start position:0%
generalities yeah thank you
 
05:46:20.570 --> 05:46:20.580 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I don't really have any
 
05:46:23.570 --> 05:46:23.580 align:start position:0%
good specifics to give you other than uh
 
05:46:25.670 --> 05:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
I've done research into what the many
 
05:46:27.590 --> 05:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
other states are doing and we're kind of
 
05:46:30.590 --> 05:46:30.600 align:start position:0%
basing our numbers off of theirs um so
 
05:46:32.990 --> 05:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
if if it's working for them and it to me
 
05:46:35.810 --> 05:46:35.820 align:start position:0%
it seems like it is uh I feel like we
 
05:46:37.190 --> 05:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
should stay competitive with those other
 
05:46:41.030 --> 05:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:43.850 --> 05:46:43.860 align:start position:0%
representative verbal thank you madam
 
05:46:46.490 --> 05:46:46.500 align:start position:0%
chair thank you Mr ass for uh sticking
 
05:46:48.708 --> 05:46:48.718 align:start position:0%
around with us
 
05:46:53.750 --> 05:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
so the 50 000 is in in gross sales and
 
05:46:56.810 --> 05:46:56.820 align:start position:0%
so the profit is some fraction thereof
 
05:47:00.948 --> 05:47:00.958 align:start position:0%
so we're not really talking about
 
05:47:02.868 --> 05:47:02.878 align:start position:0%
um full-time businesses full-time
 
05:47:05.390 --> 05:47:05.400 align:start position:0%
incomes this this this this this seems
 
05:47:08.270 --> 05:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
to go more towards a part-time
 
05:47:11.628 --> 05:47:11.638 align:start position:0%
side hustle side business if you will
 
05:47:13.788 --> 05:47:13.798 align:start position:0%
um to to help families that have a
 
05:47:15.890 --> 05:47:15.900 align:start position:0%
particular skill or or an act in The
 
05:47:18.350 --> 05:47:18.360 align:start position:0%
Culinary fields to be able to make a
 
05:47:20.448 --> 05:47:20.458 align:start position:0%
little bit of extra money uh without
 
05:47:22.910 --> 05:47:22.920 align:start position:0%
actually becoming you know a full-blown
 
05:47:25.128 --> 05:47:25.138 align:start position:0%
restaurant for the amount of material
 
05:47:27.708 --> 05:47:27.718 align:start position:0%
that that we're talking about is is that
 
05:47:29.570 --> 05:47:29.580 align:start position:0%
am I summing this up about correctly
 
05:47:31.368 --> 05:47:31.378 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question yeah I would
 
05:47:33.350 --> 05:47:33.360 align:start position:0%
say you are summing that up correctly uh
 
05:47:35.868 --> 05:47:35.878 align:start position:0%
if if they are trying to make it a much
 
05:47:38.030 --> 05:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
more of a established business with
 
05:47:40.910 --> 05:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
branding with employees with uh very
 
05:47:42.890 --> 05:47:42.900 align:start position:0%
high scaled up operations where they can
 
05:47:45.708 --> 05:47:45.718 align:start position:0%
really churn out food this isn't the uh
 
05:47:48.770 --> 05:47:48.780 align:start position:0%
operation for them this is for the uh
 
05:47:51.590 --> 05:47:51.600 align:start position:0%
the the housewife staying at home this
 
05:47:55.190 --> 05:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
is for the uh young adult that just
 
05:47:57.170 --> 05:47:57.180 align:start position:0%
needs a bit of extra income to help them
 
05:47:59.330 --> 05:47:59.340 align:start position:0%
get up on their feet uh that's who this
 
05:48:01.430 --> 05:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
is really for this is uh if they're
 
05:48:02.690 --> 05:48:02.700 align:start position:0%
going to scale up they're going to go
 
05:48:04.610 --> 05:48:04.620 align:start position:0%
for the bigger licenses because they're
 
05:48:06.770 --> 05:48:06.780 align:start position:0%
going to be getting uh a lot more
 
05:48:08.750 --> 05:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
equipment and have a lot more over ahead
 
05:48:10.910 --> 05:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
thank you follow up if I might follow up
 
05:48:13.070 --> 05:48:13.080 align:start position:0%
yep thank you thank you Mr Nas for
 
05:48:14.628 --> 05:48:14.638 align:start position:0%
taking the questions
 
05:48:14.638 --> 05:48:16.490 align:start position:0%
taking the questions
um

05:48:16.490 --> 05:48:16.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:48:19.368 --> 05:48:19.378 align:start position:0%
do you have or could you
 
05:48:22.610 --> 05:48:22.620 align:start position:0%
um prepare a list of states that do
 
05:48:25.010 --> 05:48:25.020 align:start position:0%
allow for these types of operations I
 
05:48:27.170 --> 05:48:27.180 align:start position:0%
know you mentioned California
 
05:48:29.628 --> 05:48:29.638 align:start position:0%
um I have to admit I I was struck by
 
05:48:29.638 --> 05:48:30.770 align:start position:0%
um I have to admit I I was struck by
that

05:48:30.770 --> 05:48:30.780 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:48:33.170 --> 05:48:33.180 align:start position:0%
um I found that surprising as well if
 
05:48:34.430 --> 05:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
you don't have a list if you could
 
05:48:36.048 --> 05:48:36.058 align:start position:0%
prepare one and send it to the committee
 
05:48:38.750 --> 05:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
I would be greatly obliged
 
05:48:41.030 --> 05:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you I would be happy to do
 
05:48:43.670 --> 05:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
so and I was also in my research uh
 
05:48:45.530 --> 05:48:45.540 align:start position:0%
surprise because California is not
 
05:48:48.170 --> 05:48:48.180 align:start position:0%
exactly known for uh
 
05:48:50.570 --> 05:48:50.580 align:start position:0%
well there's this sort of this sort of
 
05:48:52.788 --> 05:48:52.798 align:start position:0%
allowing businesses to grow and operate
 
05:48:54.650 --> 05:48:54.660 align:start position:0%
like this they're they're really and and
 
05:48:57.530 --> 05:48:57.540 align:start position:0%
they did take a uh more burdensome
 
05:48:59.990 --> 05:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
approach than what I uh have designed
 
05:49:02.330 --> 05:49:02.340 align:start position:0%
here but uh I'd rather not get into all
 
05:49:04.670 --> 05:49:04.680 align:start position:0%
the nitty-gritty of how they mess theirs
 
05:49:06.590 --> 05:49:06.600 align:start position:0%
up but they'll learn eventually fair
 
05:49:07.850 --> 05:49:07.860 align:start position:0%
enough thank you Mr Ness thank you madam
 
05:49:09.890 --> 05:49:09.900 align:start position:0%
chair representative Bixby
 
05:49:11.690 --> 05:49:11.700 align:start position:0%
so um
 
05:49:11.700 --> 05:49:12.650 align:start position:0%
so um
I'm

05:49:12.650 --> 05:49:12.660 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
05:49:15.410 --> 05:49:15.420 align:start position:0%
I I it sounds like what you're getting
 
05:49:18.470 --> 05:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
at here is actually a different model
 
05:49:22.070 --> 05:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
than what is currently falls under what
 
05:49:24.410 --> 05:49:24.420 align:start position:0%
was dealt with as Homestead in the state
 
05:49:28.270 --> 05:49:28.280 align:start position:0%
and it's sort of like a micro restaurant
 
05:49:33.890 --> 05:49:33.900 align:start position:0%
uh and that uh with within a house uh
 
05:49:37.430 --> 05:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure that the way that
 
05:49:40.310 --> 05:49:40.320 align:start position:0%
you've inserted into into the statutes
 
05:49:40.320 --> 05:49:41.690 align:start position:0%
you've inserted into into the statutes
actually

05:49:41.690 --> 05:49:41.700 align:start position:0%
actually
 
05:49:44.510 --> 05:49:44.520 align:start position:0%
makes it uh I I think it might be
 
05:49:46.250 --> 05:49:46.260 align:start position:0%
creating impediments for it going
 
05:49:50.990 --> 05:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
forward uh and I'm wondering if uh you
 
05:49:53.510 --> 05:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
might also be able to help us with some
 
05:49:55.190 --> 05:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
references to the laws in other states
 
05:49:57.650 --> 05:49:57.660 align:start position:0%
and how they have set put that into
 
05:50:00.948 --> 05:50:00.958 align:start position:0%
their codes to uh to help us figure out
 
05:50:03.948 --> 05:50:03.958 align:start position:0%
where it really belongs
 
05:50:07.310 --> 05:50:07.320 align:start position:0%
uh yeah I'm not sure the if there was
 
05:50:08.750 --> 05:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
like a question or more of a statement
 
05:50:11.810 --> 05:50:11.820 align:start position:0%
but the uh I would be happy to uh in
 
05:50:14.208 --> 05:50:14.218 align:start position:0%
addition to sending the list of how uh
 
05:50:15.350 --> 05:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
what other states are doing I would
 
05:50:18.350 --> 05:50:18.360 align:start position:0%
happy to send a list of examples of how
 
05:50:20.208 --> 05:50:20.218 align:start position:0%
they put it into their codes as well and
 
05:50:24.170 --> 05:50:24.180 align:start position:0%
I think uh this this one would be uh
 
05:50:26.270 --> 05:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
maybe it's easier to grasp not thinking
 
05:50:28.368 --> 05:50:28.378 align:start position:0%
of it as a homestead thing but as a
 
05:50:30.410 --> 05:50:30.420 align:start position:0%
micro Enterprise
 
05:50:32.448 --> 05:50:32.458 align:start position:0%
um I believe that's it's that's in the
 
05:50:34.730 --> 05:50:34.740 align:start position:0%
title somewhere but uh yeah as think of
 
05:50:36.288 --> 05:50:36.298 align:start position:0%
it as a micro Enterprise not really a
 
05:50:37.730 --> 05:50:37.740 align:start position:0%
restaurant because you're not seating
 
05:50:41.230 --> 05:50:41.240 align:start position:0%
people uh it's it's more uh take out
 
05:50:44.208 --> 05:50:44.218 align:start position:0%
kind of oriented
 
05:50:46.190 --> 05:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you
 
05:50:47.868 --> 05:50:47.878 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
 
05:50:47.878 --> 05:50:49.128 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
Morris

05:50:49.128 --> 05:50:49.138 align:start position:0%
Morris
 
05:50:50.448 --> 05:50:50.458 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:50:52.368 --> 05:50:52.378 align:start position:0%
so as a stay-at-home mom and we're
 
05:50:53.628 --> 05:50:53.638 align:start position:0%
talking about this as sort of a side
 
05:50:56.470 --> 05:50:56.480 align:start position:0%
business I'm just wondering how many
 
05:51:00.230 --> 05:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
tamales do I have to make to gross fifty
 
05:51:02.510 --> 05:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a year while I'm also
 
05:51:04.730 --> 05:51:04.740 align:start position:0%
taking care of my kids and my own farm
 
05:51:07.128 --> 05:51:07.138 align:start position:0%
and all of those things
 
05:51:10.190 --> 05:51:10.200 align:start position:0%
uh well tamales would be a lot uh and
 
05:51:14.810 --> 05:51:14.820 align:start position:0%
and I think uh a lot of this would be uh
 
05:51:17.090 --> 05:51:17.100 align:start position:0%
people selling to establish businesses
 
05:51:18.890 --> 05:51:18.900 align:start position:0%
where or like you know a building like
 
05:51:20.030 --> 05:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
this one where they know there's a
 
05:51:22.430 --> 05:51:22.440 align:start position:0%
couple hundred people in here and uh
 
05:51:24.770 --> 05:51:24.780 align:start position:0%
that so they can have regular repeat
 
05:51:26.570 --> 05:51:26.580 align:start position:0%
business and that's how they would
 
05:51:29.270 --> 05:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
approach that number is by uh extremely
 
05:51:31.430 --> 05:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
repetitive business of selling to the
 
05:51:36.410 --> 05:51:36.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:38.270 --> 05:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
05:51:38.280 --> 05:51:39.470 align:start position:0%
follow up
so

05:51:39.470 --> 05:51:39.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:51:42.230 --> 05:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
how do you see this is like a side
 
05:51:43.788 --> 05:51:43.798 align:start position:0%
business fifty thousand dollars a year
 
05:51:46.850 --> 05:51:46.860 align:start position:0%
growth seems like a fairly substantial
 
05:51:49.190 --> 05:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
amount for a stay-at-home mom to be
 
05:51:51.288 --> 05:51:51.298 align:start position:0%
making food
 
05:51:54.288 --> 05:51:54.298 align:start position:0%
uh well I keep in mind it's it's gross
 
05:51:56.990 --> 05:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
and it's not like what's ending up in
 
05:51:58.070 --> 05:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
their bank account at the end of the day
 
05:52:00.470 --> 05:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
in their pocket so right I'm just
 
05:52:03.170 --> 05:52:03.180 align:start position:0%
wondering what kind of time commitment I
 
05:52:05.090 --> 05:52:05.100 align:start position:0%
mean you run a restaurant what's your
 
05:52:07.250 --> 05:52:07.260 align:start position:0%
time commitment to fifty thousand
 
05:52:08.650 --> 05:52:08.660 align:start position:0%
dollars gross
 
05:52:11.690 --> 05:52:11.700 align:start position:0%
uh not a lot I would say you can
 
05:52:13.850 --> 05:52:13.860 align:start position:0%
approach that pretty quickly uh and I
 
05:52:16.490 --> 05:52:16.500 align:start position:0%
mean tamales as an example is like a
 
05:52:16.500 --> 05:52:17.330 align:start position:0%
mean tamales as an example is like a
single

05:52:17.330 --> 05:52:17.340 align:start position:0%
single
 
05:52:19.610 --> 05:52:19.620 align:start position:0%
individual food item and this bill would
 
05:52:22.190 --> 05:52:22.200 align:start position:0%
allow for full meals as well so if
 
05:52:23.628 --> 05:52:23.638 align:start position:0%
you're if you're providing a full meal
 
05:52:28.368 --> 05:52:28.378 align:start position:0%
you might have a uh sale price of thirty
 
05:52:30.470 --> 05:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
dollars a meal uh it's going to add up
 
05:52:35.770 --> 05:52:35.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:38.750 --> 05:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
representative uh Howard
 
05:52:40.730 --> 05:52:40.740 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
05:52:42.350 --> 05:52:42.360 align:start position:0%
um I'm a little bit confused about
 
05:52:44.690 --> 05:52:44.700 align:start position:0%
what's on page three between you know
 
05:52:47.810 --> 05:52:47.820 align:start position:0%
the in the uh bold
 
05:52:49.730 --> 05:52:49.740 align:start position:0%
um italics that you're adding to the
 
05:52:49.740 --> 05:52:50.510 align:start position:0%
um italics that you're adding to the
bill

05:52:50.510 --> 05:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:52:52.788 --> 05:52:52.798 align:start position:0%
where it lays out the ability to to
 
05:52:55.490 --> 05:52:55.500 align:start position:0%
produce meals and you know and sort of
 
05:52:59.030 --> 05:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
sets a a strange set of numbers 30 meals
 
05:53:01.610 --> 05:53:01.620 align:start position:0%
a day up to 60 a week
 
05:53:04.190 --> 05:53:04.200 align:start position:0%
um and with no mention at all other than
 
05:53:07.368 --> 05:53:07.378 align:start position:0%
the raw oysters that that there is a a
 
05:53:10.190 --> 05:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
two tears to this that's what we've been
 
05:53:11.930 --> 05:53:11.940 align:start position:0%
led to believe in it and on the next
 
05:53:15.350 --> 05:53:15.360 align:start position:0%
page it sort of reinforces that at some
 
05:53:17.270 --> 05:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
point if you're serving hazardous things
 
05:53:19.070 --> 05:53:19.080 align:start position:0%
if you're serving meals you're probably
 
05:53:21.048 --> 05:53:21.058 align:start position:0%
cooking with dairy and
 
05:53:23.330 --> 05:53:23.340 align:start position:0%
and possibly meet and stuff there's no
 
05:53:25.310 --> 05:53:25.320 align:start position:0%
mention there that that when you change
 
05:53:28.070 --> 05:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
over from doing cookies to meals that
 
05:53:31.970 --> 05:53:31.980 align:start position:0%
you need to have to have licensure
 
05:53:35.448 --> 05:53:35.458 align:start position:0%
or does it say that oh sorry
 
05:53:37.548 --> 05:53:37.558 align:start position:0%
um sorry about that so I guess I didn't
 
05:53:40.010 --> 05:53:40.020 align:start position:0%
read it closely enough apologies oh okay
 
05:53:42.530 --> 05:53:42.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:44.810 --> 05:53:44.820 align:start position:0%
representative verbal thank you madam
 
05:53:46.548 --> 05:53:46.558 align:start position:0%
chair so
 
05:53:46.558 --> 05:53:48.830 align:start position:0%
chair so
um

05:53:48.830 --> 05:53:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:51.530 --> 05:53:51.540 align:start position:0%
so we had cap it 60 meals a week and
 
05:53:54.650 --> 05:53:54.660 align:start position:0%
those 52 weeks in a year so it's 420
 
05:53:58.310 --> 05:53:58.320 align:start position:0%
meals a year is my is my cap all right
 
05:53:59.990 --> 05:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
do I understand that correctly
 
05:54:02.150 --> 05:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
I believe so if you just did the math
 
05:54:03.650 --> 05:54:03.660 align:start position:0%
there then yeah great thank you follow
 
05:54:06.230 --> 05:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
Madam sure follow up so
 
05:54:10.490 --> 05:54:10.500 align:start position:0%
so 420 meals in a in a year certainly uh
 
05:54:14.208 --> 05:54:14.218 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem like a super huge amount I
 
05:54:16.128 --> 05:54:16.138 align:start position:0%
work a full-time job I serve in the
 
05:54:17.868 --> 05:54:17.878 align:start position:0%
House of Representatives I bet I bet I
 
05:54:20.030 --> 05:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
could run this gig out of my out of my
 
05:54:23.150 --> 05:54:23.160 align:start position:0%
houses as well if I was so inclined is
 
05:54:27.048 --> 05:54:27.058 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the setting the 50 000 to
 
05:54:29.090 --> 05:54:29.100 align:start position:0%
make sure that they don't bump up
 
05:54:31.310 --> 05:54:31.320 align:start position:0%
against the revenue cap that they bump
 
05:54:33.288 --> 05:54:33.298 align:start position:0%
that they max out their build their
 
05:54:36.948 --> 05:54:36.958 align:start position:0%
business on volume of goods sold not on
 
05:54:39.170 --> 05:54:39.180 align:start position:0%
not on the value of those goods is that
 
05:54:41.810 --> 05:54:41.820 align:start position:0%
the intent yeah yes correct thank you Mr
 
05:54:43.850 --> 05:54:43.860 align:start position:0%
Nash thank you madam chair thank you any
 
05:54:45.288 --> 05:54:45.298 align:start position:0%
other questions for Mr Ness
 
05:54:48.890 --> 05:54:48.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:50.390 --> 05:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
so I'm just going to give an example
 
05:54:51.770 --> 05:54:51.780 align:start position:0%
this was probably about a year and a
 
05:54:54.948 --> 05:54:54.958 align:start position:0%
half ago I went to an outside event uh
 
05:54:57.770 --> 05:54:57.780 align:start position:0%
like a little rally and there were two
 
05:55:00.470 --> 05:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
people there that brought a huge cooler
 
05:55:03.948 --> 05:55:03.958 align:start position:0%
and um and they had these uh one of them
 
05:55:05.570 --> 05:55:05.580 align:start position:0%
had these beautiful veggie wraps and the
 
05:55:09.530 --> 05:55:09.540 align:start position:0%
other one had this other type of but so
 
05:55:11.750 --> 05:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
I mean they were you know it was like a
 
05:55:13.490 --> 05:55:13.500 align:start position:0%
donation but everybody was paying for
 
05:55:14.990 --> 05:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
them in a sense because they brought
 
05:55:17.510 --> 05:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
them there and um but they're just doing
 
05:55:20.208 --> 05:55:20.218 align:start position:0%
that so this is like in a sense making
 
05:55:22.250 --> 05:55:22.260 align:start position:0%
it legal for them to do it really
 
05:55:24.470 --> 05:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
because people are doing this already
 
05:55:28.490 --> 05:55:28.500 align:start position:0%
yeah uh thank you so speaking to that I
 
05:55:31.010 --> 05:55:31.020 align:start position:0%
would say from both directions uh people
 
05:55:33.288 --> 05:55:33.298 align:start position:0%
are already doing these kinds of things
 
05:55:35.930 --> 05:55:35.940 align:start position:0%
under the table the the food industry
 
05:55:38.330 --> 05:55:38.340 align:start position:0%
has lots of under the table work forever
 
05:55:41.868 --> 05:55:41.878 align:start position:0%
like across the board and uh yeah this
 
05:55:44.690 --> 05:55:44.700 align:start position:0%
this legalizes it and uh you know brings
 
05:55:46.490 --> 05:55:46.500 align:start position:0%
it back out into the light so that they
 
05:55:50.208 --> 05:55:50.218 align:start position:0%
can hopefully uh be safer and do things
 
05:55:51.948 --> 05:55:51.958 align:start position:0%
appropriately and then on the other hand
 
05:55:55.670 --> 05:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
in my long experience with uh Health
 
05:55:57.770 --> 05:55:57.780 align:start position:0%
inspections and seeing inside many many
 
05:56:01.128 --> 05:56:01.138 align:start position:0%
kitchens uh even in New Hampshire uh
 
05:56:05.150 --> 05:56:05.160 align:start position:0%
just because uh restaurant or business
 
05:56:08.330 --> 05:56:08.340 align:start position:0%
is licensed and inspected does not mean
 
05:56:10.970 --> 05:56:10.980 align:start position:0%
that they're following the correct
 
05:56:13.128 --> 05:56:13.138 align:start position:0%
practices I have I'm not going to say it
 
05:56:14.750 --> 05:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
on testimony where but there are
 
05:56:15.770 --> 05:56:15.780 align:start position:0%
definitely restaurants in New Hampshire
 
05:56:20.090 --> 05:56:20.100 align:start position:0%
that I will not eat at uh because of the
 
05:56:21.890 --> 05:56:21.900 align:start position:0%
hazard that's inside them and they are
 
05:56:24.650 --> 05:56:24.660 align:start position:0%
fully inspected and follow every burden
 
05:56:24.660 --> 05:56:25.788 align:start position:0%
fully inspected and follow every burden
so

05:56:25.788 --> 05:56:25.798 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:56:25.798 --> 05:56:26.690 align:start position:0%
so
yeah

05:56:26.690 --> 05:56:26.700 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:56:29.030 --> 05:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
representative datsy
 
05:56:31.250 --> 05:56:31.260 align:start position:0%
uh yes Madam chair I just wanted to
 
05:56:33.490 --> 05:56:33.500 align:start position:0%
clarify what I heard
 
05:56:35.990 --> 05:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
representative verbal when I do the math
 
05:56:38.350 --> 05:56:38.360 align:start position:0%
60 meals a week
 
05:56:41.230 --> 05:56:41.240 align:start position:0%
52 weeks a year I get
 
05:56:45.430 --> 05:56:45.440 align:start position:0%
3120 meals and I thought you had said
 
05:56:49.368 --> 05:56:49.378 align:start position:0%
420 or am I correct I just wanted to
 
05:56:52.670 --> 05:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
clarify thank you madam chair sure uh
 
05:56:55.070 --> 05:56:55.080 align:start position:0%
just give me a second I I did it very
 
05:56:57.048 --> 05:56:57.058 align:start position:0%
very quick and I probably did it wrong
 
05:56:59.690 --> 05:56:59.700 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate the the correction yeah
 
05:57:01.548 --> 05:57:01.558 align:start position:0%
I I would agree with the representative
 
05:57:03.368 --> 05:57:03.378 align:start position:0%
across the room it's
 
05:57:08.330 --> 05:57:08.340 align:start position:0%
3120 meals a year but I will I will I
 
05:57:10.070 --> 05:57:10.080 align:start position:0%
will stick with my original allegation
 
05:57:13.150 --> 05:57:13.160 align:start position:0%
that I I could make that work
 
05:57:16.868 --> 05:57:16.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:19.970 --> 05:57:19.980 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you I don't know if it's not
 
05:57:23.690 --> 05:57:23.700 align:start position:0%
inspected uh uh thank you and referring
 
05:57:25.430 --> 05:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
to the the example that the
 
05:57:27.230 --> 05:57:27.240 align:start position:0%
representative Potenza was referring to
 
05:57:28.670 --> 05:57:28.680 align:start position:0%
a moment ago right if you think about
 
05:57:31.010 --> 05:57:31.020 align:start position:0%
somebody who is bringing a cooler full
 
05:57:33.170 --> 05:57:33.180 align:start position:0%
of tamales or whatever right to sell at
 
05:57:34.430 --> 05:57:34.440 align:start position:0%
an event
 
05:57:35.990 --> 05:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
um aren't we now talking about getting
 
05:57:39.230 --> 05:57:39.240 align:start position:0%
to a quantity Where if there is a food
 
05:57:41.330 --> 05:57:41.340 align:start position:0%
safety problem we're talking about a
 
05:57:43.730 --> 05:57:43.740 align:start position:0%
significant number of people possibly
 
05:57:45.708 --> 05:57:45.718 align:start position:0%
getting ill coming from lots of
 
05:57:47.090 --> 05:57:47.100 align:start position:0%
different places I mean that's part of
 
05:57:49.190 --> 05:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
the reason isn't it for having this type
 
05:57:51.890 --> 05:57:51.900 align:start position:0%
of threshold now raising it more than
 
05:57:54.650 --> 05:57:54.660 align:start position:0%
doubling it don't we begin to reach a
 
05:57:57.948 --> 05:57:57.958 align:start position:0%
quantity of consumers where this is
 
05:57:59.750 --> 05:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
precisely why we have regulations to
 
05:58:00.890 --> 05:58:00.900 align:start position:0%
deal with health safety in the first
 
05:58:03.590 --> 05:58:03.600 align:start position:0%
place uh I think that's what the DHS
 
05:58:04.670 --> 05:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
would argue is that we're getting into
 
05:58:06.230 --> 05:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
that but I think you would still find
 
05:58:09.470 --> 05:58:09.480 align:start position:0%
that the amount of illness that this
 
05:58:11.990 --> 05:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
would increase uh to be a very low
 
05:58:12.000 --> 05:58:13.190 align:start position:0%
would increase uh to be a very low
number

05:58:13.190 --> 05:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
number
 
05:58:13.200 --> 05:58:18.590 align:start position:0%
number
representative

05:58:18.590 --> 05:58:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:20.930 --> 05:58:20.940 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
05:58:23.390 --> 05:58:23.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh you brought up a
 
05:58:27.890 --> 05:58:27.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:30.410 --> 05:58:30.420 align:start position:0%
um and what would you say that the
 
05:58:32.208 --> 05:58:32.218 align:start position:0%
average restaurant in the state of New
 
05:58:35.090 --> 05:58:35.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire how often is that inspected by
 
05:58:35.100 --> 05:58:37.970 align:start position:0%
Hampshire how often is that inspected by
anybody

05:58:37.970 --> 05:58:37.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:40.070 --> 05:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
well I believe another representative
 
05:58:41.990 --> 05:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
would like to answer it but uh I'll do
 
05:58:43.490 --> 05:58:43.500 align:start position:0%
my best they're supposed to be uh
 
05:58:46.610 --> 05:58:46.620 align:start position:0%
inspected annually uh I don't believe
 
05:58:48.288 --> 05:58:48.298 align:start position:0%
that that has been always the case
 
05:58:51.410 --> 05:58:51.420 align:start position:0%
because I have seen kitchens where they
 
05:58:53.270 --> 05:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
did not seem to get inspected like they
 
05:58:55.670 --> 05:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
should have but uh yeah
 
05:58:58.010 --> 05:58:58.020 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
05:58:59.868 --> 05:58:59.878 align:start position:0%
um thank you for for the answer there
 
05:59:02.510 --> 05:59:02.520 align:start position:0%
and would you say that if there was
 
05:59:05.270 --> 05:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
going to be something happening a
 
05:59:08.330 --> 05:59:08.340 align:start position:0%
foodborne illness or something that once
 
05:59:11.090 --> 05:59:11.100 align:start position:0%
a year you know a checkup looking in on
 
05:59:13.010 --> 05:59:13.020 align:start position:0%
a restaurant annually
 
05:59:14.270 --> 05:59:14.280 align:start position:0%
um and I'm not sure if they're noticed
 
05:59:15.650 --> 05:59:15.660 align:start position:0%
or not
 
05:59:17.868 --> 05:59:17.878 align:start position:0%
um they could clean up things pretty
 
05:59:21.110 --> 05:59:21.120 align:start position:0%
well and then fall back into old habits
 
05:59:23.030 --> 05:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
yeah I would say that that's definitely
 
05:59:24.708 --> 05:59:24.718 align:start position:0%
the case
 
05:59:26.750 --> 05:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
um I'd say that the the
 
05:59:29.810 --> 05:59:29.820 align:start position:0%
good restaurants the poor restaurants
 
05:59:31.730 --> 05:59:31.740 align:start position:0%
certainly they will clean up for the
 
05:59:33.350 --> 05:59:33.360 align:start position:0%
health department or they'll take their
 
05:59:35.868 --> 05:59:35.878 align:start position:0%
violations fix what they need to and
 
05:59:37.610 --> 05:59:37.620 align:start position:0%
then carry on with what they were doing
 
05:59:39.708 --> 05:59:39.718 align:start position:0%
before and there's also the concern of
 
05:59:42.948 --> 05:59:42.958 align:start position:0%
uh in restaurants with high turnover of
 
05:59:46.128 --> 05:59:46.138 align:start position:0%
Staff it doesn't matter that the good
 
05:59:48.048 --> 05:59:48.058 align:start position:0%
staff were there when they got inspected
 
05:59:51.470 --> 05:59:51.480 align:start position:0%
if soon thereafter it's new people doing
 
05:59:54.048 --> 05:59:54.058 align:start position:0%
the work and uh not following the
 
05:59:59.390 --> 05:59:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:01.910 --> 06:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh representative Knapp
 
06:00:03.590 --> 06:00:03.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I'm
 
06:00:05.090 --> 06:00:05.100 align:start position:0%
still stuck on the local law enforcement
 
06:00:07.548 --> 06:00:07.558 align:start position:0%
piece so
 
06:00:09.170 --> 06:00:09.180 align:start position:0%
our law enforcement have nothing to do
 
06:00:10.670 --> 06:00:10.680 align:start position:0%
with health and safety and our code
 
06:00:13.070 --> 06:00:13.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer does that but he
 
06:00:14.510 --> 06:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
barely has time to do the health and
 
06:00:15.770 --> 06:00:15.780 align:start position:0%
safety piece because he's our code
 
06:00:17.570 --> 06:00:17.580 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer
 
06:00:19.310 --> 06:00:19.320 align:start position:0%
um so I wonder if you spoke to any law
 
06:00:20.930 --> 06:00:20.940 align:start position:0%
enforcement and inserting them into this
 
06:00:22.490 --> 06:00:22.500 align:start position:0%
picture as to whether this is something
 
06:00:24.530 --> 06:00:24.540 align:start position:0%
they were interested in second of all it
 
06:00:27.410 --> 06:00:27.420 align:start position:0%
says can I ask a second of all sorry I'm
 
06:00:30.110 --> 06:00:30.120 align:start position:0%
sorry can I have a second part okay
 
06:00:33.650 --> 06:00:33.660 align:start position:0%
um uh it says they can limit the number
 
06:00:35.570 --> 06:00:35.580 align:start position:0%
of individual meals prepared based on
 
06:00:37.250 --> 06:00:37.260 align:start position:0%
food preparation capacity but that
 
06:00:38.570 --> 06:00:38.580 align:start position:0%
actually doesn't really speak to health
 
06:00:41.330 --> 06:00:41.340 align:start position:0%
safety does it it's a capacity issue I
 
06:00:42.708 --> 06:00:42.718 align:start position:0%
feel like the language is a little murky
 
06:00:44.750 --> 06:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
there it's not saying based on whether
 
06:00:46.490 --> 06:00:46.500 align:start position:0%
they're following safe procedures it's
 
06:00:48.048 --> 06:00:48.058 align:start position:0%
saying hey maybe you don't have enough
 
06:00:48.058 --> 06:00:49.430 align:start position:0%
saying hey maybe you don't have enough
refrigerators

06:00:49.430 --> 06:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
refrigerators
 
06:00:51.890 --> 06:00:51.900 align:start position:0%
uh yeah so the first part of your
 
06:00:53.690 --> 06:00:53.700 align:start position:0%
question I have not spoken with any law
 
06:00:57.010 --> 06:00:57.020 align:start position:0%
enforcement about this the second part
 
06:00:59.570 --> 06:00:59.580 align:start position:0%
uh I believe the the reason it's worded
 
06:01:05.270 --> 06:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
that way uh is the safety might not
 
06:01:07.850 --> 06:01:07.860 align:start position:0%
uh the lack of safety would not
 
06:01:10.850 --> 06:01:10.860 align:start position:0%
necessarily increase with the increase
 
06:01:13.310 --> 06:01:13.320 align:start position:0%
in volume but uh the number of people
 
06:01:16.490 --> 06:01:16.500 align:start position:0%
you can get sick at once uh
 
06:01:18.470 --> 06:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
does increase when you're increasing
 
06:01:19.490 --> 06:01:19.500 align:start position:0%
with volume
 
06:01:21.890 --> 06:01:21.900 align:start position:0%
representative verbal
 
06:01:25.190 --> 06:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you Mr Ness
 
06:01:27.350 --> 06:01:27.360 align:start position:0%
so I want to I want to help my
 
06:01:29.690 --> 06:01:29.700 align:start position:0%
colleagues on the on the committee and
 
06:01:32.270 --> 06:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
uh but I I also you know
 
06:01:33.650 --> 06:01:33.660 align:start position:0%
want to help the people that are
 
06:01:36.230 --> 06:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
proposing uh such such changes to our
 
06:01:38.208 --> 06:01:38.218 align:start position:0%
our state laws
 
06:01:42.948 --> 06:01:42.958 align:start position:0%
would you be comfortable with changing
 
06:01:46.190 --> 06:01:46.200 align:start position:0%
um who has the authority from
 
06:01:49.430 --> 06:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
um the local law enforcement uh to the
 
06:01:52.190 --> 06:01:52.200 align:start position:0%
local governing boardies body say select
 
06:01:54.708 --> 06:01:54.718 align:start position:0%
board a board of aldermen
 
06:01:56.510 --> 06:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
um you know whatever whatever the local
 
06:01:59.510 --> 06:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
form of government is and allow them to
 
06:02:01.850 --> 06:02:01.860 align:start position:0%
delegate those responsibilities to who
 
06:02:03.708 --> 06:02:03.718 align:start position:0%
they would think would be best fit in
 
06:02:05.810 --> 06:02:05.820 align:start position:0%
their communities should they choose to
 
06:02:07.850 --> 06:02:07.860 align:start position:0%
allow this would would that be uh would
 
06:02:09.410 --> 06:02:09.420 align:start position:0%
that be a happy medium do you suppose
 
06:02:12.170 --> 06:02:12.180 align:start position:0%
yeah for me that would be a very
 
06:02:14.510 --> 06:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
friendly change uh because the intent
 
06:02:18.110 --> 06:02:18.120 align:start position:0%
behind the bill is to make the local
 
06:02:20.690 --> 06:02:20.700 align:start position:0%
government and the local community more
 
06:02:23.330 --> 06:02:23.340 align:start position:0%
involved and decentralize it from the
 
06:02:23.340 --> 06:02:24.230 align:start position:0%
involved and decentralize it from the
state

06:02:24.230 --> 06:02:24.240 align:start position:0%
state
 
06:02:25.850 --> 06:02:25.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Miss Nash I appreciate it

uh are there anybody else who wish to
 
06:02:38.810 --> 06:02:38.820 align:start position:0%

06:02:45.830 --> 06:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:51.350 --> 06:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:53.390 --> 06:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
you have nobody who has signed up in the
 
06:02:57.170 --> 06:02:57.180 align:start position:0%
blue sheet Pro or con but online there
 
06:02:59.628 --> 06:02:59.638 align:start position:0%
were 12 people in support of this bill
 
06:03:02.628 --> 06:03:02.638 align:start position:0%
and zero opposed
 
06:03:05.030 --> 06:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
with that I am going to close the
 
06:03:09.048 --> 06:03:09.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:12.048 --> 06:03:12.058 align:start position:0%
and give the clerk a moment to reset so
 
06:03:15.948 --> 06:03:15.958 align:start position:0%
that we can now hear HB 493
 
06:03:18.048 --> 06:03:18.058 align:start position:0%
eliminating the state meet inspection
 
06:03:18.058 --> 06:03:26.330 align:start position:0%
eliminating the state meet inspection
program

06:03:26.330 --> 06:03:26.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:33.770 --> 06:03:33.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:36.830 --> 06:03:36.840 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
06:03:36.840 --> 06:03:43.670 align:start position:0%
Okay so
493.

06:03:43.670 --> 06:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:43.680 --> 06:03:47.810 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:03:47.810 --> 06:03:47.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:52.128 --> 06:03:52.138 align:start position:0%
I'm going to open the hearing to HB 493
 
06:03:54.048 --> 06:03:54.058 align:start position:0%
and I would like to invite
 
06:03:56.150 --> 06:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby up to introduce
 
06:03:58.788 --> 06:03:58.798 align:start position:0%
this Bill thank you for your
 
06:04:01.490 --> 06:04:01.500 align:start position:0%
introduction good afternoon Madam chair
 
06:04:04.850 --> 06:04:04.860 align:start position:0%
for the record I'm Peter Bixby uh
 
06:04:08.690 --> 06:04:08.700 align:start position:0%
representing uh Stratford County 13 on
 
06:04:12.708 --> 06:04:12.718 align:start position:0%
Dover New Hampshire and uh
 
06:04:16.670 --> 06:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
HB 493 is a bill that was brought at the
 
06:04:20.150 --> 06:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
request of the department uh and uh just
 
06:04:22.910 --> 06:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
a little bit of background in 2016 this
 
06:04:25.850 --> 06:04:25.860 align:start position:0%
committee undertook a study committee to
 
06:04:30.110 --> 06:04:30.120 align:start position:0%
update uh RSA chapter 427 which is where
 
06:04:34.128 --> 06:04:34.138 align:start position:0%
the Meat Inspection program uh resides
 
06:04:37.190 --> 06:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
and it resulted in legislation in 2017
 
06:04:39.530 --> 06:04:39.540 align:start position:0%
to clarify a number of elements in the
 
06:04:41.628 --> 06:04:41.638 align:start position:0%
chapter including many of the exemptions
 
06:04:45.230 --> 06:04:45.240 align:start position:0%
to 427 A2 uh
 
06:04:48.948 --> 06:04:48.958 align:start position:0%
all right 27 2A uh
 
06:04:48.958 --> 06:04:50.170 align:start position:0%
all right 27 2A uh
uh

06:04:50.170 --> 06:04:50.180 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:04:53.628 --> 06:04:53.638 align:start position:0%
and uh so a separate bill was also filed
 
06:04:56.330 --> 06:04:56.340 align:start position:0%
that year to uh create a procedure for
 
06:04:59.170 --> 06:04:59.180 align:start position:0%
doing exempt on Farm Slaughter of bison
 
06:05:02.150 --> 06:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
and uh the study committee represented
 
06:05:03.948 --> 06:05:03.958 align:start position:0%
uh at that point
 
06:05:06.590 --> 06:05:06.600 align:start position:0%
uh determined that the Meat Inspection
 
06:05:09.470 --> 06:05:09.480 align:start position:0%
program was not workable at that uh at
 
06:05:11.868 --> 06:05:11.878 align:start position:0%
that time but decided to leave it in
 
06:05:13.548 --> 06:05:13.558 align:start position:0%
place because it might be easier to
 
06:05:15.650 --> 06:05:15.660 align:start position:0%
actually get it operational if it
 
06:05:18.830 --> 06:05:18.840 align:start position:0%
remained in place a study committee last
 
06:05:22.548 --> 06:05:22.558 align:start position:0%
year uh that studied the reasons for the
 
06:05:24.048 --> 06:05:24.058 align:start position:0%
lack of Slaughter facilities in New
 
06:05:26.868 --> 06:05:26.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire concluded that establishing a
 
06:05:28.548 --> 06:05:28.558 align:start position:0%
state level program would be far more
 
06:05:30.948 --> 06:05:30.958 align:start position:0%
costly than looking into ways to
 
06:05:32.810 --> 06:05:32.820 align:start position:0%
encourage the USDA to provide more
 
06:05:37.368 --> 06:05:37.378 align:start position:0%
facilities or help or help EX in sorry I
 
06:05:38.810 --> 06:05:38.820 align:start position:0%
misspoke there
 
06:05:42.830 --> 06:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
um encourage more USDA inspected
 
06:05:47.830 --> 06:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
facilities to start up or expand so
 
06:05:53.090 --> 06:05:53.100 align:start position:0%
essentially uh USDA will pay for the
 
06:05:56.628 --> 06:05:56.638 align:start position:0%
inspectors uh for normal time normal
 
06:05:59.048 --> 06:05:59.058 align:start position:0%
full normal full-time hours
 
06:06:02.530 --> 06:06:02.540 align:start position:0%
entirely uh for any meeting meet
 
06:06:05.448 --> 06:06:05.458 align:start position:0%
processing plant uh and or meat
 
06:06:06.890 --> 06:06:06.900 align:start position:0%
slaughtering plant in the in New
 
06:06:10.610 --> 06:06:10.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh there is they will cover up
 
06:06:12.948 --> 06:06:12.958 align:start position:0%
to half of the cost for a state program
 
06:06:15.048 --> 06:06:15.058 align:start position:0%
and the state is responsible for the
 
06:06:17.810 --> 06:06:17.820 align:start position:0%
rest of that and that means that the
 
06:06:19.730 --> 06:06:19.740 align:start position:0%
state would have to find some way to to
 
06:06:21.650 --> 06:06:21.660 align:start position:0%
get half of the cost of the inspectors
 
06:06:24.410 --> 06:06:24.420 align:start position:0%
if we had a program uh we probably
 
06:06:24.420 --> 06:06:25.628 align:start position:0%
if we had a program uh we probably
wouldn't

06:06:25.628 --> 06:06:25.638 align:start position:0%
wouldn't
 
06:06:29.650 --> 06:06:29.660 align:start position:0%
we we wouldn't have
 
06:06:33.048 --> 06:06:33.058 align:start position:0%
uh more than five or six plants in the
 
06:06:35.030 --> 06:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
entire State and that would there would
 
06:06:36.948 --> 06:06:36.958 align:start position:0%
be a substantial cost to the state in
 
06:06:39.350 --> 06:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
order to uh set up the inspection
 
06:06:42.170 --> 06:06:42.180 align:start position:0%
program and to pay free inspectors it's
 
06:06:44.448 --> 06:06:44.458 align:start position:0%
just more cost effective to let the feds
 
06:06:45.890 --> 06:06:45.900 align:start position:0%
do it
 
06:06:45.900 --> 06:06:46.548 align:start position:0%
do it
um

06:06:46.548 --> 06:06:46.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:06:48.948 --> 06:06:48.958 align:start position:0%
but because the statue still exists the
 
06:06:51.230 --> 06:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner continues to field calls
 
06:06:53.270 --> 06:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
about how to use it and needs to go
 
06:06:55.070 --> 06:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
through the whole explanation of why it
 
06:06:56.930 --> 06:06:56.940 align:start position:0%
doesn't work in more detail than I just
 
06:06:59.570 --> 06:06:59.580 align:start position:0%
gave you and
 
06:07:01.970 --> 06:07:01.980 align:start position:0%
uh as a result he requested this bill to
 
06:07:03.948 --> 06:07:03.958 align:start position:0%
remove it from statute
 
06:07:06.288 --> 06:07:06.298 align:start position:0%
um having participated in both of those
 
06:07:08.150 --> 06:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
study committees I was able to identify
 
06:07:10.490 --> 06:07:10.500 align:start position:0%
which paragraphs needed to be retained
 
06:07:13.070 --> 06:07:13.080 align:start position:0%
and which could be repealed the sections
 
06:07:14.750 --> 06:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
that should be retained relate to
 
06:07:17.510 --> 06:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
exemptions from inspection the on on
 
06:07:20.030 --> 06:07:20.040 align:start position:0%
Farm poultry and Slaughter exemption is
 
06:07:22.310 --> 06:07:22.320 align:start position:0%
governed by federal law but also needs
 
06:07:23.990 --> 06:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
to be authorized at the state level so
 
06:07:26.470 --> 06:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
that had to be that had to remain
 
06:07:29.150 --> 06:07:29.160 align:start position:0%
uh similarly home Slaughter and custom
 
06:07:31.070 --> 06:07:31.080 align:start position:0%
Slaughter for home use need to be
 
06:07:34.548 --> 06:07:34.558 align:start position:0%
recognized in state law and the on on
 
06:07:36.350 --> 06:07:36.360 align:start position:0%
Farm bison slaughter provision is
 
06:07:37.970 --> 06:07:37.980 align:start position:0%
specific to New Hampshire and also needs
 
06:07:39.170 --> 06:07:39.180 align:start position:0%
to remain
 
06:07:42.110 --> 06:07:42.120 align:start position:0%
the core description of the state
 
06:07:45.708 --> 06:07:45.718 align:start position:0%
inspection program runs from 427 3 to
 
06:07:49.730 --> 06:07:49.740 align:start position:0%
427 32 D and simply needs to be repealed
 
06:07:52.490 --> 06:07:52.500 align:start position:0%
I considered providing copies of this
 
06:07:54.770 --> 06:07:54.780 align:start position:0%
that text but it runs about to about 24
 
06:07:57.048 --> 06:07:57.058 align:start position:0%
pages and I thought that wouldn't be a
 
06:08:00.948 --> 06:08:00.958 align:start position:0%
good use of resources so
 
06:08:00.958 --> 06:08:03.110 align:start position:0%
good use of resources so
uh

06:08:03.110 --> 06:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:08:07.070 --> 06:08:07.080 align:start position:0%
the uh so there are five definitions in
 
06:08:09.830 --> 06:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
section 427 2 that relate only to those
 
06:08:12.350 --> 06:08:12.360 align:start position:0%
paragraphs that are being repealed and
 
06:08:14.030 --> 06:08:14.040 align:start position:0%
those also need to be those definitions
 
06:08:16.910 --> 06:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
also need to be removed and there is a
 
06:08:18.830 --> 06:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
faulty reference related to the Bison
 
06:08:21.190 --> 06:08:21.200 align:start position:0%
exemption that I corrected
 
06:08:24.288 --> 06:08:24.298 align:start position:0%
so that is what is in the current the
 
06:08:27.770 --> 06:08:27.780 align:start position:0%
bill currently uh when it was in re when
 
06:08:29.330 --> 06:08:29.340 align:start position:0%
it was
 
06:08:29.340 --> 06:08:30.708 align:start position:0%
it was
um

06:08:30.708 --> 06:08:30.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:08:33.530 --> 06:08:33.540 align:start position:0%
when I received the copy of it uh just
 
06:08:37.970 --> 06:08:37.980 align:start position:0%
before the deadline for sign off uh I
 
06:08:39.170 --> 06:08:39.180 align:start position:0%
noticed that there were a couple of
 
06:08:42.170 --> 06:08:42.180 align:start position:0%
flaws and OLS was completely completely
 
06:08:44.990 --> 06:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
swamped at that point so
 
06:08:47.030 --> 06:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
um I said that I would do those in an
 
06:08:50.030 --> 06:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
amendment and then I uh I haven't
 
06:08:53.810 --> 06:08:53.820 align:start position:0%
produced that Amendment yet but those uh
 
06:08:57.350 --> 06:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
that what was missed was in section 427
 
06:09:02.208 --> 06:09:02.218 align:start position:0%
1A the applicability section and uh this
 
06:09:04.610 --> 06:09:04.620 align:start position:0%
basically means this section basically
 
06:09:08.930 --> 06:09:08.940 align:start position:0%
says uh what will fulfill the purpose of
 
06:09:11.410 --> 06:09:11.420 align:start position:0%
of the requirement for Meat Inspection
 
06:09:13.510 --> 06:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
06:09:18.708 --> 06:09:18.718 align:start position:0%
uh the current law reads the purposes
 
06:09:20.330 --> 06:09:20.340 align:start position:0%
and requirements of this chapter may be
 
06:09:22.610 --> 06:09:22.620 align:start position:0%
fulfilled for both interstate and
 
06:09:25.010 --> 06:09:25.020 align:start position:0%
Interstate distribution and sales of
 
06:09:27.230 --> 06:09:27.240 align:start position:0%
meat and meat products by adhering to
 
06:09:30.288 --> 06:09:30.298 align:start position:0%
the requirements of USDA detailed in 21
 
06:09:34.368 --> 06:09:34.378 align:start position:0%
USC chapters 10 and 12. that part should
 
06:09:37.610 --> 06:09:37.620 align:start position:0%
remain uh the parts that need to go away
 
06:09:39.650 --> 06:09:39.660 align:start position:0%
are the purposes of this chapter may be
 
06:09:41.270 --> 06:09:41.280 align:start position:0%
fulfilled but for interest interest
 
06:09:43.850 --> 06:09:43.860 align:start position:0%
State sale of meat by adhering to the
 
06:09:46.430 --> 06:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
provisions of the division if off
 
06:09:49.970 --> 06:09:49.980 align:start position:0%
authorized by the USDA and the purposes
 
06:09:51.770 --> 06:09:51.780 align:start position:0%
of this chapter may be fulfilled for
 
06:09:54.230 --> 06:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
Interstate sale of meat by adhering to
 
06:09:56.628 --> 06:09:56.638 align:start position:0%
the provisions of the subdivision if if
 
06:09:59.868 --> 06:09:59.878 align:start position:0%
authorized by the USDA uh pursuant to
 
06:10:01.850 --> 06:10:01.860 align:start position:0%
all constraints established by the USDA
 
06:10:05.390 --> 06:10:05.400 align:start position:0%
so since we would be getting rid of the
 
06:10:05.400 --> 06:10:06.770 align:start position:0%
so since we would be getting rid of the
the

06:10:06.770 --> 06:10:06.780 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:10:09.048 --> 06:10:09.058 align:start position:0%
um the part of the bill of the law that
 
06:10:12.048 --> 06:10:12.058 align:start position:0%
deals with us
 
06:10:15.170 --> 06:10:15.180 align:start position:0%
um in-state meeting inspection not not
 
06:10:17.628 --> 06:10:17.638 align:start position:0%
through the USDA then we would have to
 
06:10:18.890 --> 06:10:18.900 align:start position:0%
get rid of those parts of the
 
06:10:21.288 --> 06:10:21.298 align:start position:0%
applicability and I'd be happy to take
 
06:10:22.670 --> 06:10:22.680 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
06:10:25.490 --> 06:10:25.500 align:start position:0%
I have a question
 
06:10:27.890 --> 06:10:27.900 align:start position:0%
um I I received testimony from Farm
 
06:10:31.430 --> 06:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
Bureau and they said that they had uh
 
06:10:33.890 --> 06:10:33.900 align:start position:0%
there's a bill in the Senate SB 23 which
 
06:10:36.708 --> 06:10:36.718 align:start position:0%
is a study committee regarding the Meat
 
06:10:40.128 --> 06:10:40.138 align:start position:0%
Inspection program are you familiar with
 
06:10:43.010 --> 06:10:43.020 align:start position:0%
that uh yes I actually happened to be
 
06:10:44.750 --> 06:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
wrapping around into the commissioner
 
06:10:47.270 --> 06:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
when he was about to testify on that
 
06:10:49.190 --> 06:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
bill and I took a look at the bill
 
06:10:54.110 --> 06:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
realized that it uh was partly over
 
06:10:56.990 --> 06:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
overlapping with this this issue and I
 
06:10:59.330 --> 06:10:59.340 align:start position:0%
went in and uh testified to the Senate
 
06:11:01.150 --> 06:11:01.160 align:start position:0%
on that bill
 
06:11:05.048 --> 06:11:05.058 align:start position:0%
and there are a couple of parts of that
 
06:11:09.948 --> 06:11:09.958 align:start position:0%
one of which was uh essentially almost a
 
06:11:11.810 --> 06:11:11.820 align:start position:0%
duplication of the study committee that
 
06:11:14.750 --> 06:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
we did last term uh the other was a
 
06:11:16.850 --> 06:11:16.860 align:start position:0%
study committee that is specifically
 
06:11:20.948 --> 06:11:20.958 align:start position:0%
aimed at was termed non-amenable species
 
06:11:27.048 --> 06:11:27.058 align:start position:0%
uh and so the USDA does it sort of does
 
06:11:27.058 --> 06:11:27.770 align:start position:0%
uh and so the USDA does it sort of does
um

06:11:27.770 --> 06:11:27.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:11:30.410 --> 06:11:30.420 align:start position:0%
Certified Inspection for
 
06:11:35.990 --> 06:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
only a set a set range of species so
 
06:11:36.000 --> 06:11:36.708 align:start position:0%
only a set a set range of species so
um

06:11:36.708 --> 06:11:36.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:11:41.390 --> 06:11:41.400 align:start position:0%
uh bovine so bovine so beef and sheep
 
06:11:45.410 --> 06:11:45.420 align:start position:0%
and goats uh but uh there is not
 
06:11:50.270 --> 06:11:50.280 align:start position:0%
inspection available for uh strangers
 
06:11:53.090 --> 06:11:53.100 align:start position:0%
otter species like say
 
06:11:58.850 --> 06:11:58.860 align:start position:0%
um elk or emu or uh kangaroo or I wish
 
06:12:01.010 --> 06:12:01.020 align:start position:0%
you could conceivably Farm here maybe
 
06:12:02.330 --> 06:12:02.340 align:start position:0%
not in New Hampshire but you know
 
06:12:04.390 --> 06:12:04.400 align:start position:0%
further south maybe but so there
 
06:12:07.128 --> 06:12:07.138 align:start position:0%
anything that doesn't fit within what is
 
06:12:09.530 --> 06:12:09.540 align:start position:0%
typically livestock is pretty much not
 
06:12:12.170 --> 06:12:12.180 align:start position:0%
covered by USDA inspection and though
 
06:12:14.330 --> 06:12:14.340 align:start position:0%
all the types that are con that are not
 
06:12:17.030 --> 06:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
covered are called non-amenable even
 
06:12:18.350 --> 06:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
though they some of them are rather
 
06:12:20.810 --> 06:12:20.820 align:start position:0%
tasty so
 
06:12:20.820 --> 06:12:21.350 align:start position:0%
tasty so
um

06:12:21.350 --> 06:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:12:25.548 --> 06:12:25.558 align:start position:0%
I when I testified before on that bill
 
06:12:28.010 --> 06:12:28.020 align:start position:0%
in the Senate I said I approve of the
 
06:12:31.010 --> 06:12:31.020 align:start position:0%
idea of the study committee for the non
 
06:12:34.310 --> 06:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
amendable species but uh we think that
 
06:12:34.320 --> 06:12:35.270 align:start position:0%
amendable species but uh we think that
the

06:12:35.270 --> 06:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:12:37.788 --> 06:12:37.798 align:start position:0%
um part re relating to the in-state
 
06:12:39.830 --> 06:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
inspection of amenable species does not
 
06:12:41.930 --> 06:12:41.940 align:start position:0%
make sense
 
06:12:43.730 --> 06:12:43.740 align:start position:0%
thank you and just as a follow-up to
 
06:12:47.208 --> 06:12:47.218 align:start position:0%
that so this bill that you've submitted
 
06:12:49.850 --> 06:12:49.860 align:start position:0%
was that a result of the study committee
 
06:12:53.690 --> 06:12:53.700 align:start position:0%
the findings that you participated in uh
 
06:12:55.970 --> 06:12:55.980 align:start position:0%
it was informed by that but it actually
 
06:12:58.310 --> 06:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
was a result of my discussing it with
 
06:13:00.948 --> 06:13:00.958 align:start position:0%
the commissioner and the state vet and
 
06:13:05.990 --> 06:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh the other thing about the uh what we
 
06:13:08.810 --> 06:13:08.820 align:start position:0%
have here in statute is that even if we
 
06:13:10.730 --> 06:13:10.740 align:start position:0%
wanted to set up a state inspection
 
06:13:14.930 --> 06:13:14.940 align:start position:0%
program uh at this point the language in
 
06:13:17.090 --> 06:13:17.100 align:start position:0%
that is sufficiently old that it would
 
06:13:19.610 --> 06:13:19.620 align:start position:0%
not align with what is appropriate
 
06:13:21.708 --> 06:13:21.718 align:start position:0%
currently appropriate federally so we'd
 
06:13:23.750 --> 06:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
have to rebuild it anyway
 
06:13:25.910 --> 06:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions from the
 
06:13:27.890 --> 06:13:27.900 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
06:13:29.750 --> 06:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you represent Madam chair and
 
06:13:31.010 --> 06:13:31.020 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Bixby for
 
06:13:32.810 --> 06:13:32.820 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
06:13:32.820 --> 06:13:33.650 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

06:13:33.650 --> 06:13:33.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:13:37.610 --> 06:13:37.620 align:start position:0%
so what is the harm in leaving this on
 
06:13:39.770 --> 06:13:39.780 align:start position:0%
the books
 
06:13:39.780 --> 06:13:40.970 align:start position:0%
the books
um

06:13:40.970 --> 06:13:40.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:13:40.980 --> 06:13:43.788 align:start position:0%
um
well

06:13:43.788 --> 06:13:43.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:47.990 --> 06:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh I I think that that that's something
 
06:13:50.270 --> 06:13:50.280 align:start position:0%
that the uh the commissioner can explain
 
06:13:53.510 --> 06:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
more clearly than I can
 
06:13:56.510 --> 06:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
thank you follow up
 
06:13:58.368 --> 06:13:58.378 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
06:14:01.430 --> 06:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
um and thank you representative Bixby
 
06:14:03.530 --> 06:14:03.540 align:start position:0%
um the chair brought up the study
 
06:14:03.540 --> 06:14:05.090 align:start position:0%
um the chair brought up the study
committee

06:14:05.090 --> 06:14:05.100 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:14:07.490 --> 06:14:07.500 align:start position:0%
um and during that study committee
 
06:14:09.590 --> 06:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
although I may not agree with everything
 
06:14:12.948 --> 06:14:12.958 align:start position:0%
that was said the USDA said that we had
 
06:14:14.810 --> 06:14:14.820 align:start position:0%
sufficient Slaughter facilities in New
 
06:14:18.110 --> 06:14:18.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to fulfill our needs
 
06:14:20.770 --> 06:14:20.780 align:start position:0%
at that point
 
06:14:23.090 --> 06:14:23.100 align:start position:0%
would you say that was an accurate
 
06:14:26.990 --> 06:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
assessment I I was a little bit dubious
 
06:14:29.030 --> 06:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
when they said that
 
06:14:32.750 --> 06:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
uh which doesn't mean that if we if
 
06:14:35.090 --> 06:14:35.100 align:start position:0%
there were more people who wanted to
 
06:14:37.490 --> 06:14:37.500 align:start position:0%
either expand their businesses or start
 
06:14:40.250 --> 06:14:40.260 align:start position:0%
new businesses that they would not be
 
06:14:42.650 --> 06:14:42.660 align:start position:0%
they would certainly be entitled to a
 
06:14:44.990 --> 06:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
USD inspector if they expanded to the
 
06:14:47.930 --> 06:14:47.940 align:start position:0%
point where uh or if they start a new
 
06:14:47.940 --> 06:14:49.490 align:start position:0%
point where uh or if they start a new
business

06:14:49.490 --> 06:14:49.500 align:start position:0%
business
 
06:14:52.310 --> 06:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
um and needed the inspector
 
06:14:54.708 --> 06:14:54.718 align:start position:0%
representative Creighton
 
06:14:56.990 --> 06:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
thank you MC Madam chair representative
 
06:14:59.150 --> 06:14:59.160 align:start position:0%
Bixby just to try to synthesize what you
 
06:15:01.430 --> 06:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
just said USA is doing it they're doing
 
06:15:04.070 --> 06:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
a great job they want to do it we could
 
06:15:05.868 --> 06:15:05.878 align:start position:0%
do it but it costs us a lot of money and
 
06:15:07.670 --> 06:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
it would take a lot of effort is that
 
06:15:11.150 --> 06:15:11.160 align:start position:0%
what you just said yes basically gotcha
 
06:15:15.170 --> 06:15:15.180 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions
 
06:15:16.910 --> 06:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for
 
06:15:18.350 --> 06:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
introducing this bill and answering
 
06:15:20.090 --> 06:15:20.100 align:start position:0%
questions and I call
 
06:15:22.190 --> 06:15:22.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner Sean Jasper from the
 
06:15:29.230 --> 06:15:29.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:31.430 --> 06:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman members of the
 
06:15:34.010 --> 06:15:34.020 align:start position:0%
committee I am Sean Jasper commissioner
 
06:15:35.510 --> 06:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
of the Department of Agriculture markets
 
06:15:37.670 --> 06:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
and food to answer the very first
 
06:15:40.070 --> 06:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
question why it's important to get it
 
06:15:43.190 --> 06:15:43.200 align:start position:0%
off the books is if you believe in the
 
06:15:45.110 --> 06:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
importance of mental health then you
 
06:15:46.910 --> 06:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
will support my mental health by
 
06:15:50.150 --> 06:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
removing it from from the books
 
06:15:54.230 --> 06:15:54.240 align:start position:0%
um this is a a circular
 
06:15:56.570 --> 06:15:56.580 align:start position:0%
conversation that occurs all the time
 
06:15:59.090 --> 06:15:59.100 align:start position:0%
but never with someone who actually
 
06:16:02.090 --> 06:16:02.100 align:start position:0%
wants to open a state inspected meat
 
06:16:04.670 --> 06:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
program always with people who want
 
06:16:08.150 --> 06:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
someone else to open a state inspected
 
06:16:09.910 --> 06:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
me program
 
06:16:13.190 --> 06:16:13.200 align:start position:0%
but on a more serious note I want to
 
06:16:15.890 --> 06:16:15.900 align:start position:0%
thank representative Bixby for bringing
 
06:16:19.010 --> 06:16:19.020 align:start position:0%
this bill bill forward I think it's it's
 
06:16:22.610 --> 06:16:22.620 align:start position:0%
time we really focus on the possible
 
06:16:24.470 --> 06:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
and not
 
06:16:27.530 --> 06:16:27.540 align:start position:0%
the reality of the impossible
 
06:16:30.410 --> 06:16:30.420 align:start position:0%
so there's two ways that the 50 that the
 
06:16:30.420 --> 06:16:32.448 align:start position:0%
so there's two ways that the 50 that the
feds

06:16:32.448 --> 06:16:32.458 align:start position:0%
feds
 
06:16:34.970 --> 06:16:34.980 align:start position:0%
um can't won't cover that could be done
 
06:16:37.610 --> 06:16:37.620 align:start position:0%
that's one through fees
 
06:16:39.350 --> 06:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
um which would make it
 
06:16:42.048 --> 06:16:42.058 align:start position:0%
really crazy for anybody in this type of
 
06:16:44.750 --> 06:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
Market with a small margin to say yeah I
 
06:16:47.208 --> 06:16:47.218 align:start position:0%
now want to pay 50 of the cost of doing
 
06:16:50.448 --> 06:16:50.458 align:start position:0%
that our estimate mission is that for us
 
06:16:52.730 --> 06:16:52.740 align:start position:0%
to run a program on an annual basis
 
06:16:54.890 --> 06:16:54.900 align:start position:0%
would be in excess of a million dollars
 
06:16:55.850 --> 06:16:55.860 align:start position:0%
a year
 
06:16:58.190 --> 06:16:58.200 align:start position:0%
divide that by a very few people who
 
06:17:00.110 --> 06:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
would be interested in doing this and
 
06:17:03.788 --> 06:17:03.798 align:start position:0%
you can see that the math doesn't work
 
06:17:07.190 --> 06:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
the other reality is in a small state
 
06:17:08.868 --> 06:17:08.878 align:start position:0%
like New Hampshire
 
06:17:11.750 --> 06:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
where you can literally drive to another
 
06:17:14.750 --> 06:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
country or another state
 
06:17:19.850 --> 06:17:19.860 align:start position:0%
um in a very few hours sometimes minutes
 
06:17:19.860 --> 06:17:20.448 align:start position:0%
um in a very few hours sometimes minutes
um

06:17:20.448 --> 06:17:20.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:17:23.270 --> 06:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
why would you want to limit yourself to
 
06:17:25.070 --> 06:17:25.080 align:start position:0%
a market only within the state because
 
06:17:27.830 --> 06:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
the state the product of a state
 
06:17:30.970 --> 06:17:30.980 align:start position:0%
inspected program can only be sold
 
06:17:33.708 --> 06:17:33.718 align:start position:0%
within the confines so somebody couldn't
 
06:17:36.230 --> 06:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
have a butcher you know a slaughterhouse
 
06:17:38.030 --> 06:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
and then sell to a market in
 
06:17:41.270 --> 06:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts or any place else so when
 
06:17:44.510 --> 06:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
you look at the reality of the value of
 
06:17:46.250 --> 06:17:46.260 align:start position:0%
a program such as this where we don't
 
06:17:48.590 --> 06:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
have a sales and income tax to to
 
06:17:51.590 --> 06:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
support it and there are very there's
 
06:17:53.810 --> 06:17:53.820 align:start position:0%
zero requests in my five years as
 
06:17:56.208 --> 06:17:56.218 align:start position:0%
commissioner from anybody who wanted to
 
06:17:59.510 --> 06:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
build a program like this I think we
 
06:18:01.910 --> 06:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
ought to be focusing on what we can do
 
06:18:04.490 --> 06:18:04.500 align:start position:0%
that's why we have our
 
06:18:07.250 --> 06:18:07.260 align:start position:0%
program the Opera program where we did
 
06:18:09.708 --> 06:18:09.718 align:start position:0%
receive funding for expansions of
 
06:18:12.708 --> 06:18:12.718 align:start position:0%
existing facilities I'm happy to say
 
06:18:16.070 --> 06:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
that closed out last uh Friday we are
 
06:18:19.310 --> 06:18:19.320 align:start position:0%
over subscribed for people looking for
 
06:18:22.548 --> 06:18:22.558 align:start position:0%
money to do the expansions I've also
 
06:18:25.070 --> 06:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
already been in contact with the the
 
06:18:28.548 --> 06:18:28.558 align:start position:0%
folks at gopher about seeing if there
 
06:18:31.070 --> 06:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
are funds available so that we can meet
 
06:18:32.570 --> 06:18:32.580 align:start position:0%
a hundred percent of those requests
 
06:18:34.190 --> 06:18:34.200 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about a huge amount of
 
06:18:34.200 --> 06:18:35.868 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about a huge amount of
money

06:18:35.868 --> 06:18:35.878 align:start position:0%
money
 
06:18:37.250 --> 06:18:37.260 align:start position:0%
um but this is where we should be
 
06:18:39.650 --> 06:18:39.660 align:start position:0%
focusing and this is a a constant
 
06:18:39.660 --> 06:18:41.330 align:start position:0%
focusing and this is a a constant
distraction

06:18:41.330 --> 06:18:41.340 align:start position:0%
distraction
 
06:18:43.970 --> 06:18:43.980 align:start position:0%
from the governor's office I on down I
 
06:18:45.970 --> 06:18:45.980 align:start position:0%
had to spend quite a bit of time
 
06:18:49.548 --> 06:18:49.558 align:start position:0%
detailing why this program just simply
 
06:18:53.570 --> 06:18:53.580 align:start position:0%
doesn't work the Bison uh part of it and
 
06:18:55.850 --> 06:18:55.860 align:start position:0%
you mentioned Madam chair uh the bill in
 
06:18:58.670 --> 06:18:58.680 align:start position:0%
the Senate and I agree 100 with uh
 
06:19:02.208 --> 06:19:02.218 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby on that the focus
 
06:19:04.190 --> 06:19:04.200 align:start position:0%
is really on the bison and I'll I'll
 
06:19:06.530 --> 06:19:06.540 align:start position:0%
tell you last year there was a bill that
 
06:19:10.250 --> 06:19:10.260 align:start position:0%
had been put forth by a senator and then
 
06:19:12.948 --> 06:19:12.958 align:start position:0%
um my office was contacted about that
 
06:19:12.958 --> 06:19:13.850 align:start position:0%
um my office was contacted about that
bill

06:19:13.850 --> 06:19:13.860 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:19:16.430 --> 06:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
and this was to expand the Bison program
 
06:19:19.190 --> 06:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
to Elk and they said well this this
 
06:19:21.708 --> 06:19:21.718 align:start position:0%
program with the Bison has worked so
 
06:19:23.868 --> 06:19:23.878 align:start position:0%
well there hasn't been a single problem
 
06:19:25.430 --> 06:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
in all these years
 
06:19:27.708 --> 06:19:27.718 align:start position:0%
I went to the state vet and I said do we
 
06:19:30.288 --> 06:19:30.298 align:start position:0%
have people that are complying with the
 
06:19:32.208 --> 06:19:32.218 align:start position:0%
Bison program he said nobody's ever come
 
06:19:34.190 --> 06:19:34.200 align:start position:0%
forward to me
 
06:19:36.350 --> 06:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
and there's lab sampling there's a lot
 
06:19:38.448 --> 06:19:38.458 align:start position:0%
of things come to find out and Health
 
06:19:40.548 --> 06:19:40.558 align:start position:0%
and Human Services actually
 
06:19:43.250 --> 06:19:43.260 align:start position:0%
caught it up north that
 
06:19:47.150 --> 06:19:47.160 align:start position:0%
um bison meat was being sold in retail
 
06:19:47.160 --> 06:19:48.350 align:start position:0%
um bison meat was being sold in retail
stores

06:19:48.350 --> 06:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
stores
 
06:19:51.350 --> 06:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
uh in contradiction to state law and it
 
06:19:53.930 --> 06:19:53.940 align:start position:0%
was ordered off the shelf and so the
 
06:19:57.708 --> 06:19:57.718 align:start position:0%
Senate bill was withdrawn and you know
 
06:19:59.628 --> 06:19:59.638 align:start position:0%
as we began to have the discussions they
 
06:20:01.970 --> 06:20:01.980 align:start position:0%
said well this is a very expensive
 
06:20:05.150 --> 06:20:05.160 align:start position:0%
program because if you're going to kill
 
06:20:08.990 --> 06:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
a bison you have to have a state vet not
 
06:20:10.430 --> 06:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
a state vet you need to have a
 
06:20:13.128 --> 06:20:13.138 align:start position:0%
veterinarian present to observe the
 
06:20:15.350 --> 06:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
animal while it's alive and then after
 
06:20:17.750 --> 06:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
it's been slaughtered to inspect the
 
06:20:19.910 --> 06:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
meat and that becomes very expensive but
 
06:20:21.470 --> 06:20:21.480 align:start position:0%
that's the only way to ensure that it's
 
06:20:23.448 --> 06:20:23.458 align:start position:0%
not a diseased animal
 
06:20:25.910 --> 06:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
so I that's what that study committee is
 
06:20:28.430 --> 06:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
really about and the only person who was
 
06:20:31.430 --> 06:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
really there and in support of what they
 
06:20:33.770 --> 06:20:33.780 align:start position:0%
were doing was actually the person who
 
06:20:35.628 --> 06:20:35.638 align:start position:0%
owns the Bison Farm
 
06:20:38.150 --> 06:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
so we're still working on that but let's
 
06:20:41.510 --> 06:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
not study this issue again this just is
 
06:20:43.850 --> 06:20:43.860 align:start position:0%
not something that is viable in the
 
06:20:45.530 --> 06:20:45.540 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire
 
06:20:47.208 --> 06:20:47.218 align:start position:0%
unless you get somebody who's going to
 
06:20:49.490 --> 06:20:49.500 align:start position:0%
give you a grant of millions of dollars
 
06:20:50.990 --> 06:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
to keep it going and then I'm not sure
 
06:20:52.910 --> 06:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
there'd be anybody to apply
 
06:20:52.920 --> 06:20:54.830 align:start position:0%
there'd be anybody to apply
mm-hmm

06:20:54.830 --> 06:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
mm-hmm
 
06:21:05.628 --> 06:21:05.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:08.150 --> 06:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
is that also including any programs that
 
06:21:09.650 --> 06:21:09.660 align:start position:0%
would in addition to what we already
 
06:21:12.708 --> 06:21:12.718 align:start position:0%
have as far as facilities here
 
06:21:14.090 --> 06:21:14.100 align:start position:0%
um Does it include educational
 
06:21:16.250 --> 06:21:16.260 align:start position:0%
components there there is an educational
 
06:21:16.260 --> 06:21:18.048 align:start position:0%
components there there is an educational
component

06:21:18.048 --> 06:21:18.058 align:start position:0%
component
 
06:21:19.610 --> 06:21:19.620 align:start position:0%
um we are working with Cooperative
 
06:21:22.610 --> 06:21:22.620 align:start position:0%
Extension on developing a mobile class
 
06:21:25.610 --> 06:21:25.620 align:start position:0%
now they've come up with the ideal
 
06:21:30.128 --> 06:21:30.138 align:start position:0%
mobile classroom a 40-foot trailer
 
06:21:33.830 --> 06:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
and that what they priced out is higher
 
06:21:35.990 --> 06:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
than what they anticipated we could
 
06:21:38.750 --> 06:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
scale it back I am going to ask that we
 
06:21:40.070 --> 06:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
if we're going to do this with federal
 
06:21:44.570 --> 06:21:44.580 align:start position:0%
funds let's do it right and I'm asking
 
06:21:47.208 --> 06:21:47.218 align:start position:0%
for that to be filled too but even so
 
06:21:49.610 --> 06:21:49.620 align:start position:0%
we're probably only talking in the
 
06:21:51.590 --> 06:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
neighborhood of less than another
 
06:21:53.270 --> 06:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
um half a million dollars and the
 
06:21:55.548 --> 06:21:55.558 align:start position:0%
governor has said he expects 40 to 50
 
06:21:58.070 --> 06:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
million to be that has been allocated to
 
06:22:00.890 --> 06:22:00.900 align:start position:0%
be turned back and
 
06:22:02.868 --> 06:22:02.878 align:start position:0%
um agriculture has not gotten much money
 
06:22:05.090 --> 06:22:05.100 align:start position:0%
out of this huge amount of
 
06:22:07.970 --> 06:22:07.980 align:start position:0%
arpa funding so I I don't feel bad about
 
06:22:11.750 --> 06:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:14.750 --> 06:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the commissioner
 
06:22:17.090 --> 06:22:17.100 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
06:22:17.100 --> 06:22:18.770 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
you

06:22:18.770 --> 06:22:18.780 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:22:20.990 --> 06:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
I do not have any more pink cards for
 
06:22:22.368 --> 06:22:22.378 align:start position:0%
this uh
 
06:22:24.948 --> 06:22:24.958 align:start position:0%
hearing if anybody wishes to speak
 
06:22:26.810 --> 06:22:26.820 align:start position:0%
please let me know
 
06:22:30.708 --> 06:22:30.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:35.708 --> 06:22:35.718 align:start position:0%
I will read the blue sheet here
 
06:22:38.690 --> 06:22:38.700 align:start position:0%
we have zero people that signed in in
 
06:22:41.628 --> 06:22:41.638 align:start position:0%
favor or against this on the blues and
 
06:22:44.030 --> 06:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
online yes we had seven
 
06:22:49.128 --> 06:22:49.138 align:start position:0%
who support this uh proposed Bill and
 
06:22:52.730 --> 06:22:52.740 align:start position:0%
one in opposition
 
06:22:55.970 --> 06:22:55.980 align:start position:0%
and with that I will close out HP 493
 
06:22:55.980 --> 06:22:58.310 align:start position:0%
and with that I will close out HP 493
hearing

06:22:58.310 --> 06:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
06:23:00.708 --> 06:23:00.718 align:start position:0%
and give the clerk a moment
 
06:23:03.650 --> 06:23:03.660 align:start position:0%
to get set for our next and last hearing
 
06:23:09.470 --> 06:23:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:11.390 --> 06:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
okay we're all set I'm going to open up
 
06:23:14.510 --> 06:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
HP 348 relative to the sale of raw milk
 
06:23:17.590 --> 06:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
and products made with raw milk
 
06:23:22.670 --> 06:23:22.680 align:start position:0%
and I don't know who is introducing this
 
06:23:22.680 --> 06:23:24.048 align:start position:0%
and I don't know who is introducing this
bill

06:23:24.048 --> 06:23:24.058 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:23:30.470 --> 06:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:32.930 --> 06:23:32.940 align:start position:0%
representative coulon
 
06:23:36.110 --> 06:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:37.610 --> 06:23:37.620 align:start position:0%
see and you don't even look like
 
06:23:40.730 --> 06:23:40.740 align:start position:0%
representative Ankerberg
 
06:23:44.810 --> 06:23:44.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:47.208 --> 06:23:47.218 align:start position:0%
all right well thank you madam chair and
 
06:23:48.948 --> 06:23:48.958 align:start position:0%
thank you to my colleagues on the
 
06:23:50.930 --> 06:23:50.940 align:start position:0%
committee for your continued patience
 
06:23:53.690 --> 06:23:53.700 align:start position:0%
today I'm here to introduce house bill
 
06:23:53.700 --> 06:23:55.548 align:start position:0%
today I'm here to introduce house bill
348.

06:23:55.548 --> 06:23:55.558 align:start position:0%
348.
 
06:23:58.368 --> 06:23:58.378 align:start position:0%
relative to the sale of raw milk and a
 
06:24:00.708 --> 06:24:00.718 align:start position:0%
product made with raw milk The Spill
 
06:24:02.810 --> 06:24:02.820 align:start position:0%
increases the amount of raw milk a
 
06:24:05.330 --> 06:24:05.340 align:start position:0%
producer processor can sell or process
 
06:24:07.970 --> 06:24:07.980 align:start position:0%
without a license and removes the
 
06:24:10.190 --> 06:24:10.200 align:start position:0%
requirement that such ice cream and
 
06:24:13.548 --> 06:24:13.558 align:start position:0%
frozen yogurt produce using raw milk be
 
06:24:17.510 --> 06:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
sold in six ounce containers so what
 
06:24:20.930 --> 06:24:20.940 align:start position:0%
this bill is doing is increasing the
 
06:24:24.170 --> 06:24:24.180 align:start position:0%
daily amount a raw milk producer could
 
06:24:24.180 --> 06:24:25.250 align:start position:0%
daily amount a raw milk producer could
produce

06:24:25.250 --> 06:24:25.260 align:start position:0%
produce
 
06:24:31.250 --> 06:24:31.260 align:start position:0%
up to 160 gallons and eliminating the uh
 
06:24:35.690 --> 06:24:35.700 align:start position:0%
six ounce container limitation and I'm
 
06:24:38.510 --> 06:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
open to any questions
 
06:24:40.490 --> 06:24:40.500 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
 
06:24:42.410 --> 06:24:42.420 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh thank you
 
06:24:44.990 --> 06:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my questions
 
06:24:45.000 --> 06:24:46.670 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my questions
um so

06:24:46.670 --> 06:24:46.680 align:start position:0%
um so
 
06:24:50.448 --> 06:24:50.458 align:start position:0%
I if I remember having considered a
 
06:24:52.610 --> 06:24:52.620 align:start position:0%
similarly related piece of legislation
 
06:24:55.070 --> 06:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
before us and part of the conversation
 
06:24:55.080 --> 06:24:56.170 align:start position:0%
before us and part of the conversation
around

06:24:56.170 --> 06:24:56.180 align:start position:0%
around
 
06:24:59.510 --> 06:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
the requirement for the the limit on the
 
06:25:03.048 --> 06:25:03.058 align:start position:0%
quantity uh was with regard to the fact
 
06:25:06.110 --> 06:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
that um initially uh the testimony was
 
06:25:07.610 --> 06:25:07.620 align:start position:0%
that this would be a small amount it
 
06:25:10.310 --> 06:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
would be a tiny amount of of
 
06:25:12.590 --> 06:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
uh frozen yogurts being produced and
 
06:25:14.150 --> 06:25:14.160 align:start position:0%
therefore that would be something that
 
06:25:16.368 --> 06:25:16.378 align:start position:0%
would be limited to small homesteads so
 
06:25:18.708 --> 06:25:18.718 align:start position:0%
I guess Mike my question is I jumped
 
06:25:21.948 --> 06:25:21.958 align:start position:0%
from 120 to 160 is quite a large jump
 
06:25:25.310 --> 06:25:25.320 align:start position:0%
and can you speak to the desire to go
 
06:25:25.320 --> 06:25:26.810 align:start position:0%
and can you speak to the desire to go
from

06:25:26.810 --> 06:25:26.820 align:start position:0%
from
 
06:25:29.448 --> 06:25:29.458 align:start position:0%
20 20 gallons to 160.
 
06:25:33.530 --> 06:25:33.540 align:start position:0%
uh yeah just if if I'm uh milking my
 
06:25:36.110 --> 06:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
beautiful Jersey cows and I get more
 
06:25:38.890 --> 06:25:38.900 align:start position:0%
than 20 gallons I'd like to be you know
 
06:25:41.930 --> 06:25:41.940 align:start position:0%
statutorily available to sell that to my
 
06:25:45.110 --> 06:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
customers and to the six ounce container
 
06:25:49.368 --> 06:25:49.378 align:start position:0%
piece I mean I usually enjoy more than
 
06:25:52.310 --> 06:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
six ounces of ice cream and frozen
 
06:25:55.610 --> 06:25:55.620 align:start position:0%
yogurt so I'd uh like to be able to
 
06:25:59.288 --> 06:25:59.298 align:start position:0%
support my local raw milk producer to
 
06:26:03.350 --> 06:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
enjoy maybe 10 or 12 ounces of ice cream
 
06:26:05.570 --> 06:26:05.580 align:start position:0%
or 16 ounces of ice cream and frozen
 
06:26:05.580 --> 06:26:08.948 align:start position:0%
or 16 ounces of ice cream and frozen
yogurt

06:26:08.948 --> 06:26:08.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:11.270 --> 06:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
06:26:13.430 --> 06:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
any other questions for representative
 
06:26:15.170 --> 06:26:15.180 align:start position:0%
of Representative coulon representative
 
06:26:19.010 --> 06:26:19.020 align:start position:0%
Bixby yes uh so uh what was the origin
 
06:26:21.170 --> 06:26:21.180 align:start position:0%
of this bill did you have a constituent
 
06:26:25.910 --> 06:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
who requested uh that uh yes sir uh
 
06:26:29.150 --> 06:26:29.160 align:start position:0%
constituent request
 
06:26:32.208 --> 06:26:32.218 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
06:26:33.530 --> 06:26:33.540 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
 
06:26:38.150 --> 06:26:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:40.610 --> 06:26:40.620 align:start position:0%
raw milk's a funny thing isn't it it uh
 
06:26:43.070 --> 06:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
it really strikes a nerve in a lot of
 
06:26:43.080 --> 06:26:43.850 align:start position:0%
it really strikes a nerve in a lot of
people

06:26:43.850 --> 06:26:43.860 align:start position:0%
people
 
06:26:46.310 --> 06:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
but that's not really my question my
 
06:26:50.690 --> 06:26:50.700 align:start position:0%
question is are you aware of any um
 
06:26:52.510 --> 06:26:52.520 align:start position:0%
health issues
 
06:26:58.250 --> 06:26:58.260 align:start position:0%
associated with the sale of raw milk and
 
06:27:01.670 --> 06:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
raw milk related products uh in the
 
06:27:04.368 --> 06:27:04.378 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire since raw milk
 
06:27:07.850 --> 06:27:07.860 align:start position:0%
sales were first enabled under a 20
 
06:27:10.910 --> 06:27:10.920 align:start position:0%
gallon threshold
 
06:27:12.948 --> 06:27:12.958 align:start position:0%
um I can't speak to the 20 gallon
 
06:27:15.650 --> 06:27:15.660 align:start position:0%
threshold piece but I can say there is
 
06:27:17.810 --> 06:27:17.820 align:start position:0%
an issue with raw milk that it makes you
 
06:27:20.390 --> 06:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
it tastes way too good and it makes you
 
06:27:23.270 --> 06:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
way too healthy when you consume it so
 
06:27:25.868 --> 06:27:25.878 align:start position:0%
you might have resistance against
 
06:27:28.490 --> 06:27:28.500 align:start position:0%
certain you know
 
06:27:31.010 --> 06:27:31.020 align:start position:0%
maladies or illness that could come upon
 
06:27:32.448 --> 06:27:32.458 align:start position:0%
you so
 
06:27:34.610 --> 06:27:34.620 align:start position:0%
thank you representative I actually am
 
06:27:37.490 --> 06:27:37.500 align:start position:0%
just recovering from such a a malady uh
 
06:27:39.708 --> 06:27:39.718 align:start position:0%
35 pounds lost in a couple of months
 
06:27:41.510 --> 06:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
although it probably wasn't the the raw
 
06:27:41.520 --> 06:27:42.590 align:start position:0%
although it probably wasn't the the raw
milk

06:27:42.590 --> 06:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
milk
 
06:27:42.600 --> 06:27:46.430 align:start position:0%
milk
um

06:27:46.430 --> 06:27:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:48.230 --> 06:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
so to the best of your knowledge there's
 
06:27:49.970 --> 06:27:49.980 align:start position:0%
been no issue no health issues
 
06:27:52.128 --> 06:27:52.138 align:start position:0%
associated at the sale of raw milk or
 
06:27:53.810 --> 06:27:53.820 align:start position:0%
raw milk products in the state of New
 
06:27:56.270 --> 06:27:56.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is that correct uh I'd say
 
06:27:58.310 --> 06:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
you're very correct in that statement
 
06:28:02.270 --> 06:28:02.280 align:start position:0%
and I'll say that I buy raw milk from a
 
06:28:04.970 --> 06:28:04.980 align:start position:0%
raw milk producer that has the
 
06:28:09.170 --> 06:28:09.180 align:start position:0%
six ounce containers to adhere to the
 
06:28:12.590 --> 06:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
statute and I I don't buy it I stick to
 
06:28:15.530 --> 06:28:15.540 align:start position:0%
the raw milk because I like to have more
 
06:28:18.110 --> 06:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
than six ounces in a serving thank you
 
06:28:19.490 --> 06:28:19.500 align:start position:0%
represent a follow-up if I may Madam
 
06:28:21.410 --> 06:28:21.420 align:start position:0%
chair sure
 
06:28:24.410 --> 06:28:24.420 align:start position:0%
so I know a serious concern uh amongst
 
06:28:26.750 --> 06:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
many and and probably several if not
 
06:28:30.770 --> 06:28:30.780 align:start position:0%
more in this room is packaging waste I
 
06:28:32.868 --> 06:28:32.878 align:start position:0%
mean we we hear a lot of testimony about
 
06:28:34.490 --> 06:28:34.500 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste in the state of New
 
06:28:37.010 --> 06:28:37.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and certainly packaging waste
 
06:28:40.490 --> 06:28:40.500 align:start position:0%
is is right there would you agree that
 
06:28:43.730 --> 06:28:43.740 align:start position:0%
selling 20 gallons of frozen yogurt in
 
06:28:46.310 --> 06:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
six ounce cups would produce more
 
06:28:49.670 --> 06:28:49.680 align:start position:0%
packaging waste than say 20 gallons of
 
06:28:52.310 --> 06:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
frozen yogurt that were packaged in
 
06:28:54.288 --> 06:28:54.298 align:start position:0%
um I don't know say a half a gallon or
 
06:28:56.868 --> 06:28:56.878 align:start position:0%
or one gallon containers do you suppose
 
06:28:58.970 --> 06:28:58.980 align:start position:0%
that would reduce packaging waste oh
 
06:29:01.190 --> 06:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to be correct in that
 
06:29:03.170 --> 06:29:03.180 align:start position:0%
assessment sir thank you representative
 
06:29:04.730 --> 06:29:04.740 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you any
 
06:29:06.110 --> 06:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
other questions for representative
 
06:29:06.120 --> 06:29:07.670 align:start position:0%
other questions for representative
coulon

06:29:07.670 --> 06:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
coulon
 
06:29:10.190 --> 06:29:10.200 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
06:29:12.890 --> 06:29:12.900 align:start position:0%
testimony this afternoon thank you I'd
 
06:29:26.990 --> 06:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:28.850 --> 06:29:28.860 align:start position:0%
good afternoon again for the record my
 
06:29:30.350 --> 06:29:30.360 align:start position:0%
name is Colleen Smith I'm with the
 
06:29:31.548 --> 06:29:31.558 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
06:29:34.128 --> 06:29:34.138 align:start position:0%
food protection section I am here to
 
06:29:36.470 --> 06:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
speak about House Bill 348 the
 
06:29:38.390 --> 06:29:38.400 align:start position:0%
department is opposed to the bill as it
 
06:29:41.390 --> 06:29:41.400 align:start position:0%
is currently written we have we've
 
06:29:43.310 --> 06:29:43.320 align:start position:0%
worked with this Committee in the past
 
06:29:46.788 --> 06:29:46.798 align:start position:0%
to expand the amounts of products and
 
06:29:46.798 --> 06:29:47.930 align:start position:0%
to expand the amounts of products and
limits

06:29:47.930 --> 06:29:47.940 align:start position:0%
limits
 
06:29:50.868 --> 06:29:50.878 align:start position:0%
that of of raw milk that can be sold or
 
06:29:53.150 --> 06:29:53.160 align:start position:0%
made into products without licensing and
 
06:29:55.490 --> 06:29:55.500 align:start position:0%
regulation but we have serious concerns
 
06:29:57.730 --> 06:29:57.740 align:start position:0%
about increasing that this to this level
 
06:30:02.208 --> 06:30:02.218 align:start position:0%
20 from 20 gallons a day per to 160
 
06:30:03.948 --> 06:30:03.958 align:start position:0%
gallons a day that those are very
 
06:30:06.890 --> 06:30:06.900 align:start position:0%
significant amounts of animals that are
 
06:30:09.350 --> 06:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
being milked from a cow's perspective
 
06:30:12.288 --> 06:30:12.298 align:start position:0%
that could be 20 to 40 milking cows a
 
06:30:14.510 --> 06:30:14.520 align:start position:0%
day that produce that volume and this
 
06:30:16.128 --> 06:30:16.138 align:start position:0%
doesn't limit species so if you're
 
06:30:18.470 --> 06:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
looking at if you're looking at Goats or
 
06:30:20.930 --> 06:30:20.940 align:start position:0%
sheep that are being milked that could
 
06:30:23.690 --> 06:30:23.700 align:start position:0%
be five to ten times as much animals
 
06:30:26.448 --> 06:30:26.458 align:start position:0%
that this this is going and again these
 
06:30:29.270 --> 06:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
are uninspected facilities there's no
 
06:30:31.368 --> 06:30:31.378 align:start position:0%
standards for sanitation there's no
 
06:30:33.230 --> 06:30:33.240 align:start position:0%
standards for testing of the final
 
06:30:35.448 --> 06:30:35.458 align:start position:0%
product whether that be microbiological
 
06:30:38.030 --> 06:30:38.040 align:start position:0%
or antibiotics that could be used to
 
06:30:40.430 --> 06:30:40.440 align:start position:0%
treat the animals this is these are all
 
06:30:42.948 --> 06:30:42.958 align:start position:0%
going unregulated at this time at these
 
06:30:44.810 --> 06:30:44.820 align:start position:0%
limits and this again would drastically
 
06:30:47.868 --> 06:30:47.878 align:start position:0%
increase those limits we have seen
 
06:30:49.788 --> 06:30:49.798 align:start position:0%
increases in foodborne illness
 
06:30:52.548 --> 06:30:52.558 align:start position:0%
associated with raw milk since since
 
06:30:56.868 --> 06:30:56.878 align:start position:0%
this legislation has passed 2016 to 2019
 
06:30:59.930 --> 06:30:59.940 align:start position:0%
we saw that increase and in fact in 2021
 
06:31:03.470 --> 06:31:03.480 align:start position:0%
we investigated a large outbreak where
 
06:31:06.650 --> 06:31:06.660 align:start position:0%
over 50 people from three states and
 
06:31:09.708 --> 06:31:09.718 align:start position:0%
because this firm abutted to neighboring
 
06:31:11.930 --> 06:31:11.940 align:start position:0%
states there were also folks from Maine
 
06:31:13.430 --> 06:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
and Massachusetts as well as New
 
06:31:15.470 --> 06:31:15.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents that were ill from
 
06:31:17.270 --> 06:31:17.280 align:start position:0%
consuming milk that was contaminated
 
06:31:19.730 --> 06:31:19.740 align:start position:0%
with camphobacter that we identified in
 
06:31:22.070 --> 06:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
the humans and actually in the source of
 
06:31:26.390 --> 06:31:26.400 align:start position:0%
milk and in one dog too so it it we are
 
06:31:28.368 --> 06:31:28.378 align:start position:0%
seeing outbreaks associated with raw
 
06:31:30.788 --> 06:31:30.798 align:start position:0%
milk consumption and in this instance
 
06:31:33.770 --> 06:31:33.780 align:start position:0%
this farmer was very proactive and as
 
06:31:35.270 --> 06:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
soon as he received complaints he
 
06:31:38.208 --> 06:31:38.218 align:start position:0%
notified his consumer base and without
 
06:31:40.310 --> 06:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
that cooperation this output break could
 
06:31:42.948 --> 06:31:42.958 align:start position:0%
have been very much larger because if if
 
06:31:44.930 --> 06:31:44.940 align:start position:0%
an outbreak isn't reported to us
 
06:31:46.970 --> 06:31:46.980 align:start position:0%
directly we have to rely on a medical
 
06:31:49.548 --> 06:31:49.558 align:start position:0%
provider to do testing and get results
 
06:31:51.470 --> 06:31:51.480 align:start position:0%
of that testing and it can take several
 
06:31:53.330 --> 06:31:53.340 align:start position:0%
weeks before we even know something's
 
06:31:55.670 --> 06:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
going on and if it wasn't for this quick
 
06:31:57.830 --> 06:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
reaction of this farmer to notify as
 
06:31:59.930 --> 06:31:59.940 align:start position:0%
consumers this could outbreak could have
 
06:32:02.930 --> 06:32:02.940 align:start position:0%
been a lot more than 50 people so we do
 
06:32:05.810 --> 06:32:05.820 align:start position:0%
have concerns about increasing this uh
 
06:32:07.610 --> 06:32:07.620 align:start position:0%
this limit also we want to point out
 
06:32:10.970 --> 06:32:10.980 align:start position:0%
that a lot of up to 40 or 50 percent if
 
06:32:12.770 --> 06:32:12.780 align:start position:0%
you look at National Data the people
 
06:32:14.390 --> 06:32:14.400 align:start position:0%
that are impacted by this are children
 
06:32:17.868 --> 06:32:17.878 align:start position:0%
children under our makeup most of these
 
06:32:19.970 --> 06:32:19.980 align:start position:0%
at least 40 percent to half of these
 
06:32:22.190 --> 06:32:22.200 align:start position:0%
cases depending on which data you look
 
06:32:24.288 --> 06:32:24.298 align:start position:0%
at and and they don't often have a
 
06:32:25.850 --> 06:32:25.860 align:start position:0%
choice if they're consuming if they're
 
06:32:28.190 --> 06:32:28.200 align:start position:0%
given raw milk or pasteurized milk so
 
06:32:31.310 --> 06:32:31.320 align:start position:0%
again we do have concerns about this the
 
06:32:33.410 --> 06:32:33.420 align:start position:0%
container size that was something that
 
06:32:35.330 --> 06:32:35.340 align:start position:0%
was inserted into the bill that
 
06:32:35.340 --> 06:32:36.770 align:start position:0%
was inserted into the bill that
originated

06:32:36.770 --> 06:32:36.780 align:start position:0%
originated
 
06:32:39.830 --> 06:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
a few years ago to limit the amount of
 
06:32:42.730 --> 06:32:42.740 align:start position:0%
product that would be in a consumer's
 
06:32:45.830 --> 06:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
freezer over time because there is the
 
06:32:49.628 --> 06:32:49.638 align:start position:0%
pathogen listeria that can grow under
 
06:32:52.850 --> 06:32:52.860 align:start position:0%
refrigerated or freezer temperatures and
 
06:32:54.590 --> 06:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
so that was the that was the concern
 
06:32:57.530 --> 06:32:57.540 align:start position:0%
about having a larger container size
 
06:32:59.690 --> 06:32:59.700 align:start position:0%
that that product would be remain in a
 
06:33:03.530 --> 06:33:03.540 align:start position:0%
consumer's freezer so again I would be
 
06:33:04.910 --> 06:33:04.920 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions the
 
06:33:07.490 --> 06:33:07.500 align:start position:0%
committee has representative Bixby
 
06:33:09.948 --> 06:33:09.958 align:start position:0%
yeah so um
 
06:33:13.490 --> 06:33:13.500 align:start position:0%
the limit for uh for someone who is
 
06:33:15.948 --> 06:33:15.958 align:start position:0%
selling who is not licensed is 20
 
06:33:18.708 --> 06:33:18.718 align:start position:0%
gallons but I there are Opera I'm sure
 
06:33:20.510 --> 06:33:20.520 align:start position:0%
the brookford farm sells a whole lot
 
06:33:23.150 --> 06:33:23.160 align:start position:0%
more than that uh what sort of Licensing
 
06:33:25.850 --> 06:33:25.860 align:start position:0%
do then uh inspections do they undergo
 
06:33:28.628 --> 06:33:28.638 align:start position:0%
in order to make sure that their
 
06:33:32.030 --> 06:33:32.040 align:start position:0%
distribution chain is is working well
 
06:33:35.448 --> 06:33:35.458 align:start position:0%
so so to clarify the those that are
 
06:33:37.430 --> 06:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
exempt from license they are limited to
 
06:33:39.230 --> 06:33:39.240 align:start position:0%
the 20 gallons per day and they're also
 
06:33:40.910 --> 06:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
limited to where they can sell the
 
06:33:43.070 --> 06:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
product so they can sell to from their
 
06:33:45.948 --> 06:33:45.958 align:start position:0%
own Farm or their own Farm Stand or at a
 
06:33:47.810 --> 06:33:47.820 align:start position:0%
farmer's market as long as they're under
 
06:33:50.868 --> 06:33:50.878 align:start position:0%
that 20 gallons per day if they want to
 
06:33:54.170 --> 06:33:54.180 align:start position:0%
sell to a retail store So currently
 
06:33:56.628 --> 06:33:56.638 align:start position:0%
yogurt raw milk yogurt and raw milk
 
06:33:58.788 --> 06:33:58.798 align:start position:0%
fluid milk that's allowed but they have
 
06:34:01.368 --> 06:34:01.378 align:start position:0%
to be licensed by our department so that
 
06:34:04.490 --> 06:34:04.500 align:start position:0%
involves they do have to have basic
 
06:34:07.070 --> 06:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
sanitation requirements basic facilities
 
06:34:10.010 --> 06:34:10.020 align:start position:0%
requirements for floors walls and
 
06:34:11.990 --> 06:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
ceilings are smooth durable cleanable
 
06:34:15.170 --> 06:34:15.180 align:start position:0%
and then also they are routinely
 
06:34:17.510 --> 06:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
inspected and samples of their milk are
 
06:34:20.448 --> 06:34:20.458 align:start position:0%
tested for bacteria and somatic cell
 
06:34:20.458 --> 06:34:21.890 align:start position:0%
tested for bacteria and somatic cell
counts

06:34:21.890 --> 06:34:21.900 align:start position:0%
counts
 
06:34:23.990 --> 06:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:34:26.330 --> 06:34:26.340 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
 
06:34:26.340 --> 06:34:31.128 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
verbal

06:34:31.128 --> 06:34:31.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:35.270 --> 06:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
so I I'm curious what do you estimate
 
06:34:37.610 --> 06:34:37.620 align:start position:0%
the average family size to be in New
 
06:34:37.620 --> 06:34:39.170 align:start position:0%
the average family size to be in New
Hampshire

06:34:39.170 --> 06:34:39.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
06:34:41.868 --> 06:34:41.878 align:start position:0%
immediate family all right I'm sorry I'm
 
06:34:44.390 --> 06:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
not an expert in the the family size of
 
06:34:46.788 --> 06:34:46.798 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire yeah fair enough so I I'm
 
06:34:48.830 --> 06:34:48.840 align:start position:0%
not either but I I would estimate that
 
06:34:50.510 --> 06:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
the average family size in New Hampshire
 
06:34:53.030 --> 06:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
is probably four people uh two adults
 
06:34:56.570 --> 06:34:56.580 align:start position:0%
and two children so uh to see an
 
06:34:58.070 --> 06:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
outbreak that would
 
06:34:59.690 --> 06:34:59.700 align:start position:0%
in fact 40 percent of children and
 
06:35:01.010 --> 06:35:01.020 align:start position:0%
nobody wants to see children getting
 
06:35:03.110 --> 06:35:03.120 align:start position:0%
sick don't get me wrong but the forty
 
06:35:04.850 --> 06:35:04.860 align:start position:0%
percent while it may sound shocking
 
06:35:07.610 --> 06:35:07.620 align:start position:0%
really if if some contaminated food is
 
06:35:09.590 --> 06:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
in their family of four uh it would
 
06:35:11.690 --> 06:35:11.700 align:start position:0%
stand to reason that that half of the
 
06:35:14.448 --> 06:35:14.458 align:start position:0%
people give or take uh would would be
 
06:35:14.458 --> 06:35:15.948 align:start position:0%
people give or take uh would would be
children

06:35:15.948 --> 06:35:15.958 align:start position:0%
children
 
06:35:18.288 --> 06:35:18.298 align:start position:0%
um a follow-up if I may follow up yeah
 
06:35:20.690 --> 06:35:20.700 align:start position:0%
so you you had mentioned that if we jump
 
06:35:24.048 --> 06:35:24.058 align:start position:0%
from 20 gallons to 160 gallons a day
 
06:35:27.530 --> 06:35:27.540 align:start position:0%
that that that would be a lot of animals
 
06:35:29.868 --> 06:35:29.878 align:start position:0%
which is sort of a relative measure can
 
06:35:32.090 --> 06:35:32.100 align:start position:0%
you explain to me how it is that the
 
06:35:34.610 --> 06:35:34.620 align:start position:0%
number of animals somehow plays a role
 
06:35:37.128 --> 06:35:37.138 align:start position:0%
into what we're discussing here
 
06:35:40.368 --> 06:35:40.378 align:start position:0%
sure so what could be in a perfect
 
06:35:43.010 --> 06:35:43.020 align:start position:0%
example is the the campobacter outbreak
 
06:35:45.350 --> 06:35:45.360 align:start position:0%
that we that we investigated it was
 
06:35:47.628 --> 06:35:47.638 align:start position:0%
isolated that in that herd which was
 
06:35:50.448 --> 06:35:50.458 align:start position:0%
about 20 milking cows that it was one
 
06:35:52.310 --> 06:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
cow that was that was Ill that
 
06:35:54.830 --> 06:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
contributed that contributed to that
 
06:35:57.948 --> 06:35:57.958 align:start position:0%
outbreak because all the milk gets mixed
 
06:36:01.010 --> 06:36:01.020 align:start position:0%
together and so increasing that uh that
 
06:36:03.470 --> 06:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
volume of cows it could potentially
 
06:36:06.708 --> 06:36:06.718 align:start position:0%
increase your amount of of
 
06:36:09.708 --> 06:36:09.718 align:start position:0%
um risk for illness and also these are
 
06:36:12.948 --> 06:36:12.958 align:start position:0%
are the again these places wouldn't be
 
06:36:15.170 --> 06:36:15.180 align:start position:0%
under inspection there this would be a
 
06:36:17.628 --> 06:36:17.638 align:start position:0%
very large operation that there would be
 
06:36:20.628 --> 06:36:20.638 align:start position:0%
no standards for again looking at the
 
06:36:22.090 --> 06:36:22.100 align:start position:0%
animal health looking at the animal
 
06:36:24.110 --> 06:36:24.120 align:start position:0%
conditions where they're stored looking
 
06:36:26.868 --> 06:36:26.878 align:start position:0%
where the milking facilities are is is
 
06:36:30.590 --> 06:36:30.600 align:start position:0%
that that also expands you might not in
 
06:36:32.510 --> 06:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
these very small operations they might
 
06:36:34.310 --> 06:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
be treating them more like pets where
 
06:36:35.810 --> 06:36:35.820 align:start position:0%
they're they're cleanliness but when you
 
06:36:38.628 --> 06:36:38.638 align:start position:0%
get to those larger volume of operations
 
06:36:40.850 --> 06:36:40.860 align:start position:0%
um it might be very difficult to do to
 
06:36:42.890 --> 06:36:42.900 align:start position:0%
do that thank you madam chair one last
 
06:36:44.990 --> 06:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
question if I may one more thank you
 
06:36:47.990 --> 06:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
could you sorry I worked on a dairy farm
 
06:36:50.090 --> 06:36:50.100 align:start position:0%
as a child and and through my my early
 
06:36:50.100 --> 06:36:51.230 align:start position:0%
as a child and and through my my early
twenties

06:36:51.230 --> 06:36:51.240 align:start position:0%
twenties
 
06:36:52.910 --> 06:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
um and so it's always interesting what
 
06:36:55.190 --> 06:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
people's uh sense of scale is could you
 
06:36:57.048 --> 06:36:57.058 align:start position:0%
give me a sense of scale of what you
 
06:36:59.868 --> 06:36:59.878 align:start position:0%
would consider a small medium and large
 
06:37:02.628 --> 06:37:02.638 align:start position:0%
uh Dairy operation
 
06:37:05.628 --> 06:37:05.638 align:start position:0%
I um and that would vary that would vary
 
06:37:08.510 --> 06:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
again per person per state
 
06:37:10.010 --> 06:37:10.020 align:start position:0%
um in talking to New Hampshire though
 
06:37:12.890 --> 06:37:12.900 align:start position:0%
and talking to our staff in looking at
 
06:37:14.990 --> 06:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
these numbers they would consider this a
 
06:37:17.868 --> 06:37:17.878 align:start position:0%
medium to a a probably a medium size I
 
06:37:20.990 --> 06:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
would say operation at this five the 160
 
06:37:23.390 --> 06:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
volume of
 
06:37:23.400 --> 06:37:24.170 align:start position:0%
volume of
um

06:37:24.170 --> 06:37:24.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:37:26.030 --> 06:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
gallons per day thank you thank you
 
06:37:30.948 --> 06:37:30.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:33.410 --> 06:37:33.420 align:start position:0%
um uh representative germana
 
06:37:34.970 --> 06:37:34.980 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
06:37:34.980 --> 06:37:35.510 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

06:37:35.510 --> 06:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:37:37.010 --> 06:37:37.020 align:start position:0%
thinking about the size of the
 
06:37:38.510 --> 06:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
containers and thank you for for taking
 
06:37:40.910 --> 06:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
my question doesn't increasing the size
 
06:37:44.390 --> 06:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
of the container increase the the risk
 
06:37:47.208 --> 06:37:47.218 align:start position:0%
of possible illness in part because it
 
06:37:49.490 --> 06:37:49.500 align:start position:0%
increases the likelihood that you're
 
06:37:51.890 --> 06:37:51.900 align:start position:0%
going to eat a little bit now and then
 
06:37:54.170 --> 06:37:54.180 align:start position:0%
cover it back up and come back to
 
06:37:56.390 --> 06:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
tomorrow or the next day or whatever
 
06:37:59.690 --> 06:37:59.700 align:start position:0%
right and so with this milk which is uh
 
06:38:01.670 --> 06:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
raw milk right so if if it's not
 
06:38:03.708 --> 06:38:03.718 align:start position:0%
consumed all at once and you have a
 
06:38:05.930 --> 06:38:05.940 align:start position:0%
larger quantity doesn't that increase
 
06:38:08.750 --> 06:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
the risk of potential problem
 
06:38:12.048 --> 06:38:12.058 align:start position:0%
it it could possibly you could um have
 
06:38:14.090 --> 06:38:14.100 align:start position:0%
more temperature abuse if you're taking
 
06:38:15.708 --> 06:38:15.718 align:start position:0%
it out and thawing it that gives
 
06:38:18.110 --> 06:38:18.120 align:start position:0%
bacteria the opportunity to to grow at
 
06:38:20.390 --> 06:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
warmer temperatures and then freezing it
 
06:38:23.330 --> 06:38:23.340 align:start position:0%
again it also could limit our ability to
 
06:38:25.548 --> 06:38:25.558 align:start position:0%
detect a food-borne illness outbreak
 
06:38:28.430 --> 06:38:28.440 align:start position:0%
because someone might not get sick right
 
06:38:30.110 --> 06:38:30.120 align:start position:0%
away if they're keeping a container in
 
06:38:31.670 --> 06:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
their in their freezer for longer
 
06:38:33.708 --> 06:38:33.718 align:start position:0%
periods of time versus consuming it and
 
06:38:36.110 --> 06:38:36.120 align:start position:0%
then getting ill you know immediately or
 
06:38:38.390 --> 06:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
shortly after
 
06:38:41.868 --> 06:38:41.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:45.110 --> 06:38:45.120 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby yes uh just curious
 
06:38:47.628 --> 06:38:47.638 align:start position:0%
was the operation uh where the capital
 
06:38:51.770 --> 06:38:51.780 align:start position:0%
of actor uh outbreak uh took place was
 
06:38:54.590 --> 06:38:54.600 align:start position:0%
that a licensed and inspected facility
 
06:38:58.010 --> 06:38:58.020 align:start position:0%
or was that a uh something uh farm that
 
06:38:59.390 --> 06:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
is operating under the homestead
 
06:39:02.208 --> 06:39:02.218 align:start position:0%
exemption so that was that was a
 
06:39:05.930 --> 06:39:05.940 align:start position:0%
licensed facility and and again that it
 
06:39:07.850 --> 06:39:07.860 align:start position:0%
doesn't because this is a raw product
 
06:39:10.430 --> 06:39:10.440 align:start position:0%
there's no there's no kill stop there
 
06:39:12.770 --> 06:39:12.780 align:start position:0%
it's not being pasteurized so even in a
 
06:39:15.708 --> 06:39:15.718 align:start position:0%
licensed facility things can things can
 
06:39:19.128 --> 06:39:19.138 align:start position:0%
go wrong again I can't tell you enough
 
06:39:21.590 --> 06:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
is that our relationship with that
 
06:39:23.990 --> 06:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
farmer and them being able to contact
 
06:39:26.030 --> 06:39:26.040 align:start position:0%
the inspector right away let them know
 
06:39:29.208 --> 06:39:29.218 align:start position:0%
it it was allowed us to get the word out
 
06:39:30.830 --> 06:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
do the investigation and take that
 
06:39:33.708 --> 06:39:33.718 align:start position:0%
intervention to get further people from
 
06:39:39.288 --> 06:39:39.298 align:start position:0%
becoming ill follow up so um so if for
 
06:39:42.288 --> 06:39:42.298 align:start position:0%
uh unlicensed operations would the
 
06:39:44.930 --> 06:39:44.940 align:start position:0%
response time be slower or or perhaps
 
06:39:47.208 --> 06:39:47.218 align:start position:0%
non-existent if if there was an outbreak
 
06:39:49.970 --> 06:39:49.980 align:start position:0%
that is possible because they would not
 
06:39:52.788 --> 06:39:52.798 align:start position:0%
have that relationship with with our
 
06:39:55.430 --> 06:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
inspector to know who to contact or or
 
06:39:57.470 --> 06:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
maybe would be concerned and worried
 
06:39:59.030 --> 06:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
about what's going to happen so that
 
06:40:02.208 --> 06:40:02.218 align:start position:0%
they might be less likely to report if
 
06:40:04.490 --> 06:40:04.500 align:start position:0%
they were receiving consumer complaints
 
06:40:06.288 --> 06:40:06.298 align:start position:0%
that their product made someone ill
 
06:40:09.530 --> 06:40:09.540 align:start position:0%
thank you representative verbal
 
06:40:11.628 --> 06:40:11.638 align:start position:0%
thank you so so based on everything I'm
 
06:40:14.090 --> 06:40:14.100 align:start position:0%
hearing it would it be safe to assume
 
06:40:16.670 --> 06:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
that the preference of the department
 
06:40:20.208 --> 06:40:20.218 align:start position:0%
would be to repeal the raw milk uh
 
06:40:22.548 --> 06:40:22.558 align:start position:0%
legalization in New Hampshire and and
 
06:40:26.090 --> 06:40:26.100 align:start position:0%
return to the days of 100 uh pasteurized
 
06:40:27.650 --> 06:40:27.660 align:start position:0%
milk in the market
 
06:40:30.770 --> 06:40:30.780 align:start position:0%
I I'm not going to comment on that full
 
06:40:32.330 --> 06:40:32.340 align:start position:0%
question I can tell you that we are
 
06:40:34.310 --> 06:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill we're opposed to
 
06:40:37.070 --> 06:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
expansion and that we don't Advocate the
 
06:40:38.990 --> 06:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
consumption of raw milk because of the
 
06:40:41.510 --> 06:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
public health risks quick follow-up
 
06:40:44.208 --> 06:40:44.218 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up were you where was the
 
06:40:45.770 --> 06:40:45.780 align:start position:0%
department also against the original
 
06:40:48.530 --> 06:40:48.540 align:start position:0%
bill that allowed the 20 gallon limit of
 
06:40:50.448 --> 06:40:50.458 align:start position:0%
raw milk and raw milk materials into the
 
06:40:53.990 --> 06:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
marketplace that bill was in 2012 I
 
06:40:56.810 --> 06:40:56.820 align:start position:0%
believe and I I cannot recall if the
 
06:41:00.110 --> 06:41:00.120 align:start position:0%
department took a position at that time
 
06:41:05.448 --> 06:41:05.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:07.548 --> 06:41:07.558 align:start position:0%
okay well go ahead representative
 
06:41:09.948 --> 06:41:09.958 align:start position:0%
cuomtoire then
 
06:41:12.110 --> 06:41:12.120 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair and uh
 
06:41:15.910 --> 06:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
representative verville at that time uh
 
06:41:18.830 --> 06:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
the people that crafted the legislation
 
06:41:21.410 --> 06:41:21.420 align:start position:0%
on the raw milk work worked diligently
 
06:41:24.110 --> 06:41:24.120 align:start position:0%
and closely with New Hampshire DHHS who
 
06:41:27.708 --> 06:41:27.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:30.530 --> 06:41:30.540 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby
 
06:41:33.770 --> 06:41:33.780 align:start position:0%
so and also I believe that uh you know
 
06:41:35.868 --> 06:41:35.878 align:start position:0%
there was some modification to it in
 
06:41:39.708 --> 06:41:39.718 align:start position:0%
2013 or 2014 and at that point uh I
 
06:41:42.650 --> 06:41:42.660 align:start position:0%
believe it was Mr Dumont was the um head
 
06:41:45.230 --> 06:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
of uh food protective services and he
 
06:41:48.048 --> 06:41:48.058 align:start position:0%
explained that the reason that we keep
 
06:41:52.548 --> 06:41:52.558 align:start position:0%
with small amounts is because uh it we
 
06:41:55.190 --> 06:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
it's it's a risk reduction
 
06:41:55.200 --> 06:41:56.030 align:start position:0%
it's it's a risk reduction
um

06:41:56.030 --> 06:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:41:58.490 --> 06:41:58.500 align:start position:0%
Factor so if you're producing very large
 
06:42:00.770 --> 06:42:00.780 align:start position:0%
amounts the risk multiplies
 
06:42:03.110 --> 06:42:03.120 align:start position:0%
substantially and with so the department
 
06:42:05.150 --> 06:42:05.160 align:start position:0%
was happy with small amounts of raw milk
 
06:42:09.530 --> 06:42:09.540 align:start position:0%
because it was a constrained risk
 
06:42:11.330 --> 06:42:11.340 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
 
06:42:12.708 --> 06:42:12.718 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair for taking my
 
06:42:20.390 --> 06:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:22.270 --> 06:42:22.280 align:start position:0%
thank you license no longer be sought
 
06:42:25.850 --> 06:42:25.860 align:start position:0%
how many times do you go into a facility
 
06:42:28.970 --> 06:42:28.980 align:start position:0%
to inspect is it annually biannually
 
06:42:31.430 --> 06:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
um and by not having the ability to do
 
06:42:34.548 --> 06:42:34.558 align:start position:0%
that obviously there may be other risks
 
06:42:36.470 --> 06:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
Associated so could you speak to some of
 
06:42:40.250 --> 06:42:40.260 align:start position:0%
that so so depending on the type of
 
06:42:44.270 --> 06:42:44.280 align:start position:0%
dairy operation they could be in
 
06:42:44.280 --> 06:42:45.010 align:start position:0%
dairy operation they could be in
um

06:42:45.010 --> 06:42:45.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:42:47.570 --> 06:42:47.580 align:start position:0%
there are certain those that ship across
 
06:42:49.250 --> 06:42:49.260 align:start position:0%
state lines those are required to be
 
06:42:51.890 --> 06:42:51.900 align:start position:0%
inspected at certain frequency their
 
06:42:53.750 --> 06:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
pasteurizers are required to be
 
06:42:55.850 --> 06:42:55.860 align:start position:0%
inspected monthly
 
06:42:59.390 --> 06:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
um for just to sell raw milk at retail
 
06:43:01.310 --> 06:43:01.320 align:start position:0%
those would those producers would be
 
06:43:04.430 --> 06:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
inspected every six months
 
06:43:07.070 --> 06:43:07.080 align:start position:0%
oh what
 
06:43:08.750 --> 06:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
kind of questioning then would that
 
06:43:10.970 --> 06:43:10.980 align:start position:0%
potentially limit a Farm's ability to
 
06:43:12.288 --> 06:43:12.298 align:start position:0%
transport their milk outside of state
 
06:43:14.510 --> 06:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
line if there would be no requirement to
 
06:43:17.570 --> 06:43:17.580 align:start position:0%
inspect for sanitation so so in this
 
06:43:20.690 --> 06:43:20.700 align:start position:0%
instant so raw milk cannot trans raw
 
06:43:23.750 --> 06:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
milk cannot be transported us across
 
06:43:26.150 --> 06:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
state lines if it's going to be consumed
 
06:43:28.368 --> 06:43:28.378 align:start position:0%
in that state that's that's against the
 
06:43:30.650 --> 06:43:30.660 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
06:43:33.410 --> 06:43:33.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:36.170 --> 06:43:36.180 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
 
06:43:38.628 --> 06:43:38.638 align:start position:0%
verbal so you spoke of an outbreak
 
06:43:42.590 --> 06:43:42.600 align:start position:0%
earlier that involved three states from
 
06:43:44.930 --> 06:43:44.940 align:start position:0%
one Dairy location presumably the dairy
 
06:43:47.690 --> 06:43:47.700 align:start position:0%
location was only located in in one
 
06:43:47.700 --> 06:43:49.070 align:start position:0%
location was only located in in one
state

06:43:49.070 --> 06:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
state
 
06:43:49.080 --> 06:43:50.330 align:start position:0%
state
so

06:43:50.330 --> 06:43:50.340 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:43:52.910 --> 06:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
so the milk was illegally transported
 
06:43:56.208 --> 06:43:56.218 align:start position:0%
across state lines is that so so in this
 
06:43:57.830 --> 06:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
instance the farm was in New Hampshire
 
06:44:01.548 --> 06:44:01.558 align:start position:0%
but the consumers went to purchase the
 
06:44:03.708 --> 06:44:03.718 align:start position:0%
the milk from that farm directly and
 
06:44:05.448 --> 06:44:05.458 align:start position:0%
took it back to their home so there
 
06:44:07.430 --> 06:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be they weren't going to resell
 
06:44:09.770 --> 06:44:09.780 align:start position:0%
it that's that's the illegal part of if
 
06:44:11.930 --> 06:44:11.940 align:start position:0%
somebody is free to go and purchase a
 
06:44:13.430 --> 06:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
product in another state and bring it
 
06:44:17.030 --> 06:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
back to their their home thank you
 
06:44:17.040 --> 06:44:17.810 align:start position:0%
back to their their home thank you
okay

06:44:17.810 --> 06:44:17.820 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:44:20.628 --> 06:44:20.638 align:start position:0%
any other further questions for
 
06:44:23.090 --> 06:44:23.100 align:start position:0%
Miss Smith no seeing none thank you very
 
06:44:25.730 --> 06:44:25.740 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony this afternoon I
 
06:44:28.730 --> 06:44:28.740 align:start position:0%
have uh calling Stephen Nass
 
06:44:33.170 --> 06:44:33.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:34.788 --> 06:44:34.798 align:start position:0%
thank you for hearing my testimony yet
 
06:44:37.670 --> 06:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
again uh I'll be brief I'm so I'm
 
06:44:39.770 --> 06:44:39.780 align:start position:0%
originally from Wisconsin which is the
 
06:44:43.310 --> 06:44:43.320 align:start position:0%
Dairyland USA and we've fought a lot for
 
06:44:47.030 --> 06:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
raw milk Freedom there and what uh I
 
06:44:50.510 --> 06:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
noticed was uh a lot of the language in
 
06:44:54.890 --> 06:44:54.900 align:start position:0%
uh the legality of raw milk is really uh
 
06:44:57.288 --> 06:44:57.298 align:start position:0%
not due to safety because I believe that
 
06:45:00.048 --> 06:45:00.058 align:start position:0%
the consumers do understand the risks of
 
06:45:03.110 --> 06:45:03.120 align:start position:0%
drinking raw milk it's really uh
 
06:45:05.990 --> 06:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
anti-competitive behavior on behalf of
 
06:45:09.350 --> 06:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
the larger milk boards and milk
 
06:45:12.948 --> 06:45:12.958 align:start position:0%
producers so the two things that this
 
06:45:16.310 --> 06:45:16.320 align:start position:0%
bill is touching are changing from 20 to
 
06:45:19.250 --> 06:45:19.260 align:start position:0%
160 gallons which is the equivalent of
 
06:45:21.890 --> 06:45:21.900 align:start position:0%
having a couple of cows to having still
 
06:45:25.670 --> 06:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
just 20 cows is not a huge increase and
 
06:45:27.708 --> 06:45:27.718 align:start position:0%
I believe that's still considered and
 
06:45:29.510 --> 06:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
where I come from that would still be
 
06:45:32.330 --> 06:45:32.340 align:start position:0%
considered a small dairy farm and then
 
06:45:32.340 --> 06:45:33.250 align:start position:0%
considered a small dairy farm and then
again

06:45:33.250 --> 06:45:33.260 align:start position:0%
again
 
06:45:36.708 --> 06:45:36.718 align:start position:0%
increasing or removing the limits on the
 
06:45:40.610 --> 06:45:40.620 align:start position:0%
size of the container from six ounces uh
 
06:45:42.410 --> 06:45:42.420 align:start position:0%
again I believe that
 
06:45:44.510 --> 06:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
the reason why the size of the container
 
06:45:47.090 --> 06:45:47.100 align:start position:0%
is really not based on increase of risk
 
06:45:49.190 --> 06:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
it's really based on the increase of
 
06:45:51.110 --> 06:45:51.120 align:start position:0%
competitiveness or the the changing
 
06:45:52.670 --> 06:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
competitiveness because when you go to
 
06:45:54.650 --> 06:45:54.660 align:start position:0%
the grocery store how many six ounce
 
06:45:57.350 --> 06:45:57.360 align:start position:0%
containers of regular ice cream do you
 
06:46:00.110 --> 06:46:00.120 align:start position:0%
see uh you really don't see them there
 
06:46:01.788 --> 06:46:01.798 align:start position:0%
you're buying it by the gallon you're
 
06:46:04.430 --> 06:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
buying it by the the full Pint or a half
 
06:46:07.548 --> 06:46:07.558 align:start position:0%
gallon or a quart so that's really the
 
06:46:10.128 --> 06:46:10.138 align:start position:0%
ultimate reasoning uh even if the health
 
06:46:12.410 --> 06:46:12.420 align:start position:0%
department might disagree
 
06:46:16.730 --> 06:46:16.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:18.708 --> 06:46:18.718 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
06:46:21.650 --> 06:46:21.660 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh you mentioned
 
06:46:23.390 --> 06:46:23.400 align:start position:0%
um that increasing would go from like a
 
06:46:26.570 --> 06:46:26.580 align:start position:0%
couple of cows to about 20 cows what
 
06:46:28.190 --> 06:46:28.200 align:start position:0%
about goats because goats are part of
 
06:46:30.530 --> 06:46:30.540 align:start position:0%
the raw milk bill so how many goats
 
06:46:34.910 --> 06:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
would you need go from to in regards to
 
06:46:36.170 --> 06:46:36.180 align:start position:0%
this I'm not positive I'm not as
 
06:46:38.270 --> 06:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
familiar with goats and uh but I would
 
06:46:41.090 --> 06:46:41.100 align:start position:0%
assume the percentage scale would be the
 
06:46:43.250 --> 06:46:43.260 align:start position:0%
same so I'm really not sure that yield
 
06:46:45.410 --> 06:46:45.420 align:start position:0%
on goat milk
 
06:46:45.420 --> 06:46:47.448 align:start position:0%
on goat milk
hmm

06:46:47.448 --> 06:46:47.458 align:start position:0%
hmm
 
06:46:49.850 --> 06:46:49.860 align:start position:0%
okay uh any other questions
 
06:46:56.150 --> 06:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:59.628 --> 06:46:59.638 align:start position:0%
gallon to a gallon and a half a day
 
06:47:02.690 --> 06:47:02.700 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Creighton
 
06:47:06.410 --> 06:47:06.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:08.330 --> 06:47:08.340 align:start position:0%
so if you go from
 
06:47:08.340 --> 06:47:09.770 align:start position:0%
so if you go from
warning

06:47:09.770 --> 06:47:09.780 align:start position:0%
warning
 
06:47:16.070 --> 06:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:17.570 --> 06:47:17.580 align:start position:0%
and so what you're saying is a cow
 
06:47:19.010 --> 06:47:19.020 align:start position:0%
produces eight
 
06:47:21.530 --> 06:47:21.540 align:start position:0%
eight gallons of milk per day yes
 
06:47:25.610 --> 06:47:25.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:27.350 --> 06:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
 
06:47:29.510 --> 06:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
verbal yeah thank you manager thank you
 
06:47:32.030 --> 06:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
Mr Nash uh for taking the question
 
06:47:32.040 --> 06:47:33.530 align:start position:0%
Mr Nash uh for taking the question
um

06:47:33.530 --> 06:47:33.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:47:36.230 --> 06:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
what I understand you support the bill I
 
06:47:38.090 --> 06:47:38.100 align:start position:0%
and I don't I don't disagree with you at
 
06:47:38.100 --> 06:47:38.868 align:start position:0%
and I don't I don't disagree with you at
all

06:47:38.868 --> 06:47:38.878 align:start position:0%
all
 
06:47:41.330 --> 06:47:41.340 align:start position:0%
um would a um friendly Amendment be
 
06:47:43.368 --> 06:47:43.378 align:start position:0%
amenable to you to
 
06:47:47.628 --> 06:47:47.638 align:start position:0%
um change six fluid ounces to 128 fluid
 
06:47:50.208 --> 06:47:50.218 align:start position:0%
ounces uh basically making the upper
 
06:47:52.430 --> 06:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
limit a one gallon container would that
 
06:47:52.440 --> 06:47:53.208 align:start position:0%
limit a one gallon container would that
be

06:47:53.208 --> 06:47:53.218 align:start position:0%
be
 
06:47:55.430 --> 06:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
would you find that to be acceptable
 
06:47:58.968 --> 06:47:58.978 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean that would be acceptable in
 
06:47:59.990 --> 06:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
some ways
 
06:48:03.350 --> 06:48:03.360 align:start position:0%
um yeah I I because like I said the the
 
06:48:06.110 --> 06:48:06.120 align:start position:0%
my main opposition to the numbers that
 
06:48:08.330 --> 06:48:08.340 align:start position:0%
were originally uh included would be
 
06:48:10.610 --> 06:48:10.620 align:start position:0%
because it's just they're just trying to
 
06:48:12.650 --> 06:48:12.660 align:start position:0%
not let the small producer compete with
 
06:48:14.810 --> 06:48:14.820 align:start position:0%
the big one and the dairy industry is
 
06:48:16.968 --> 06:48:16.978 align:start position:0%
dying in the United States this at least
 
06:48:19.310 --> 06:48:19.320 align:start position:0%
on the small level it's more and more
 
06:48:21.350 --> 06:48:21.360 align:start position:0%
just the big farms that are able to
 
06:48:23.750 --> 06:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
compete and the small ones are being
 
06:48:24.890 --> 06:48:24.900 align:start position:0%
pushed out
 
06:48:27.048 --> 06:48:27.058 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mr Nash I can't argue with
 
06:48:28.788 --> 06:48:28.798 align:start position:0%
that we're as a former Dairy Farmer
 
06:48:30.048 --> 06:48:30.058 align:start position:0%
we've certainly seen at New Hampshire
 
06:48:32.390 --> 06:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
06:48:35.030 --> 06:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
representative germanna thank you for
 
06:48:36.650 --> 06:48:36.660 align:start position:0%
taking my question again but if your
 
06:48:40.070 --> 06:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
contention is that raw milk is is just
 
06:48:42.590 --> 06:48:42.600 align:start position:0%
as safe as uh milk that's been
 
06:48:44.868 --> 06:48:44.878 align:start position:0%
pasteurized or that the the risks aren't
 
06:48:47.990 --> 06:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh any greater why would you agree to
 
06:48:50.270 --> 06:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
any amendment to limit the size of the
 
06:48:52.310 --> 06:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
container in in the first place uh
 
06:48:53.868 --> 06:48:53.878 align:start position:0%
that's not what my contention is I do
 
06:48:55.310 --> 06:48:55.320 align:start position:0%
believe there is a greater risk in
 
06:48:57.830 --> 06:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
drinking raw milk uh I but I do believe
 
06:48:59.628 --> 06:48:59.638 align:start position:0%
that the consumers know and understand
 
06:49:01.788 --> 06:49:01.798 align:start position:0%
that risk when they purchase it you're
 
06:49:04.368 --> 06:49:04.378 align:start position:0%
going to May a follow-up sure then but
 
06:49:07.010 --> 06:49:07.020 align:start position:0%
again so my question as as some other
 
06:49:09.890 --> 06:49:09.900 align:start position:0%
questions on some other bills is you
 
06:49:12.110 --> 06:49:12.120 align:start position:0%
know what is the limit that you would
 
06:49:14.690 --> 06:49:14.700 align:start position:0%
set what is it based on what is the
 
06:49:16.310 --> 06:49:16.320 align:start position:0%
science what are the studies that
 
06:49:19.430 --> 06:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
determine the specific upper limits that
 
06:49:21.350 --> 06:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
you have suggested
 
06:49:23.570 --> 06:49:23.580 align:start position:0%
and I have the upper limits at all
 
06:49:25.610 --> 06:49:25.620 align:start position:0%
I mean personally I don't believe there
 
06:49:27.650 --> 06:49:27.660 align:start position:0%
should be upper limits I think that uh
 
06:49:30.048 --> 06:49:30.058 align:start position:0%
consumers can make that determination on
 
06:49:32.570 --> 06:49:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:35.448 --> 06:49:35.458 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you
 
06:49:37.788 --> 06:49:37.798 align:start position:0%
um Madam chair for taking my question
 
06:49:39.650 --> 06:49:39.660 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my questions so
 
06:49:42.048 --> 06:49:42.058 align:start position:0%
one question I have is that um I think
 
06:49:43.788 --> 06:49:43.798 align:start position:0%
sort of in similar vein as
 
06:49:45.430 --> 06:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
representative germana
 
06:49:48.048 --> 06:49:48.058 align:start position:0%
what types of illnesses are you familiar
 
06:49:49.610 --> 06:49:49.620 align:start position:0%
obviously we know that can't pull back
 
06:49:52.968 --> 06:49:52.978 align:start position:0%
back door is they a an actual bacteria
 
06:49:56.930 --> 06:49:56.940 align:start position:0%
but what what sort of risks come with us
 
06:49:59.628 --> 06:49:59.638 align:start position:0%
um drinking that milk to like for
 
06:50:01.310 --> 06:50:01.320 align:start position:0%
example children for example do you know
 
06:50:03.230 --> 06:50:03.240 align:start position:0%
what types of illness they are faced
 
06:50:06.350 --> 06:50:06.360 align:start position:0%
with if they are um become ill because
 
06:50:09.590 --> 06:50:09.600 align:start position:0%
of consuming these products yeah uh I
 
06:50:10.730 --> 06:50:10.740 align:start position:0%
don't know the bacteria names off the
 
06:50:13.128 --> 06:50:13.138 align:start position:0%
top of my head but the and I don't know
 
06:50:15.830 --> 06:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
how much more of a risk of actually
 
06:50:17.930 --> 06:50:17.940 align:start position:0%
catching these things children would be
 
06:50:20.330 --> 06:50:20.340 align:start position:0%
uh they just don't have the stronger
 
06:50:22.548 --> 06:50:22.558 align:start position:0%
immune systems an adult would but uh
 
06:50:24.468 --> 06:50:24.478 align:start position:0%
basically it would be any bacterial
 
06:50:26.810 --> 06:50:26.820 align:start position:0%
contamination or a chemical uh
 
06:50:29.990 --> 06:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
contamination for example uh you're
 
06:50:31.850 --> 06:50:31.860 align:start position:0%
washing the tank out that you keep the
 
06:50:34.010 --> 06:50:34.020 align:start position:0%
milk in and use bleach and you don't
 
06:50:36.530 --> 06:50:36.540 align:start position:0%
properly rinse it and that gets into the
 
06:50:38.510 --> 06:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
milk and contaminates it
 
06:50:40.850 --> 06:50:40.860 align:start position:0%
representative Murray follow-up thank
 
06:50:44.448 --> 06:50:44.458 align:start position:0%
you so the event that and
 
06:50:46.070 --> 06:50:46.080 align:start position:0%
ancient inspections were not to occur
 
06:50:48.350 --> 06:50:48.360 align:start position:0%
and children are at a higher risk for
 
06:50:50.390 --> 06:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
for diseases and and things associated
 
06:50:52.490 --> 06:50:52.500 align:start position:0%
with chemical Factor I'm sorry I'm
 
06:50:53.930 --> 06:50:53.940 align:start position:0%
mispronouncing that
 
06:50:56.330 --> 06:50:56.340 align:start position:0%
um what What treatments and what
 
06:50:58.010 --> 06:50:58.020 align:start position:0%
protocols would then happen as a result
 
06:51:00.590 --> 06:51:00.600 align:start position:0%
of I think Temple bacteria causes severe
 
06:51:02.510 --> 06:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
diarrheas dehydrations all sorts of
 
06:51:04.548 --> 06:51:04.558 align:start position:0%
other types of things associated with
 
06:51:07.330 --> 06:51:07.340 align:start position:0%
that and when you're looking at children
 
06:51:10.368 --> 06:51:10.378 align:start position:0%
do you have any idea of the implications
 
06:51:12.350 --> 06:51:12.360 align:start position:0%
that are associated around illnesses
 
06:51:17.170 --> 06:51:17.180 align:start position:0%
that result in sort of those types of um
 
06:51:19.910 --> 06:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
diarrhea dehydration etc those types of
 
06:51:21.770 --> 06:51:21.780 align:start position:0%
things like the implications on the
 
06:51:23.690 --> 06:51:23.700 align:start position:0%
health effects on the children
 
06:51:26.990 --> 06:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not I'm not super familiar with
 
06:51:28.670 --> 06:51:28.680 align:start position:0%
like disease
 
06:51:30.650 --> 06:51:30.660 align:start position:0%
control and the effects of specific
 
06:51:33.708 --> 06:51:33.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:37.190 --> 06:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
any other questions for Mr Nass
 
06:51:39.410 --> 06:51:39.420 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
06:51:41.330 --> 06:51:41.340 align:start position:0%
today and I call
 
06:51:41.340 --> 06:51:42.530 align:start position:0%
today and I call
um

06:51:42.530 --> 06:51:42.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:51:45.350 --> 06:51:45.360 align:start position:0%
The Honorable John T O'Connor to come
 
06:51:49.670 --> 06:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:03.468 --> 06:52:03.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:05.690 --> 06:52:05.700 align:start position:0%
I only have a small room you get double
 
06:52:05.700 --> 06:52:08.690 align:start position:0%
I only have a small room you get double
size

06:52:08.690 --> 06:52:08.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:10.968 --> 06:52:10.978 align:start position:0%
again my name is John O'Connor I'm
 
06:52:12.708 --> 06:52:12.718 align:start position:0%
living Derry New Hampshire
 
06:52:15.048 --> 06:52:15.058 align:start position:0%
and little thing about my background
 
06:52:17.208 --> 06:52:17.218 align:start position:0%
before I go in and I know it's late you
 
06:52:19.610 --> 06:52:19.620 align:start position:0%
hit a very busy day
 
06:52:21.590 --> 06:52:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh I've been in the dairy industry for
 
06:52:24.110 --> 06:52:24.120 align:start position:0%
over 50 years started out on the farm I
 
06:52:25.788 --> 06:52:25.798 align:start position:0%
went to an agricultural high school went
 
06:52:28.610 --> 06:52:28.620 align:start position:0%
to an agricultural College I mined it in
 
06:52:31.670 --> 06:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
pathology for the dairy industry style I
 
06:52:33.590 --> 06:52:33.600 align:start position:0%
was a laboratory technician for a couple
 
06:52:36.410 --> 06:52:36.420 align:start position:0%
of years at HP Hood spent 20 smart years
 
06:52:39.288 --> 06:52:39.298 align:start position:0%
with them then I got promoted and then I
 
06:52:40.910 --> 06:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
got stolen by another company became
 
06:52:42.708 --> 06:52:42.718 align:start position:0%
vice president of operations and quality
 
06:52:42.718 --> 06:52:44.868 align:start position:0%
vice president of operations and quality
assurance

06:52:44.868 --> 06:52:44.878 align:start position:0%
assurance
 
06:52:47.448 --> 06:52:47.458 align:start position:0%
and I kept their used classes now
 
06:52:50.208 --> 06:52:50.218 align:start position:0%
I want to go back in a little history on
 
06:52:52.250 --> 06:52:52.260 align:start position:0%
this hill we've come a long way to get
 
06:52:54.530 --> 06:52:54.540 align:start position:0%
to where we are and I know I wrote
 
06:52:56.750 --> 06:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
support on that but I'm starting to
 
06:52:59.330 --> 06:52:59.340 align:start position:0%
maybe change my mind after listening to
 
06:53:01.310 --> 06:53:01.320 align:start position:0%
some of the conversations going on I'm
 
06:53:03.110 --> 06:53:03.120 align:start position:0%
going to tell you why in a minute
 
06:53:06.170 --> 06:53:06.180 align:start position:0%
we had a meeting back in February 2nd
 
06:53:11.510 --> 06:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
2020 when I was still here HP 1592.
 
06:53:14.208 --> 06:53:14.218 align:start position:0%
and we all got together including
 
06:53:19.030 --> 06:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner Jasper HHS Farm Bureau
 
06:53:21.548 --> 06:53:21.558 align:start position:0%
representative Aaron was there remember
 
06:53:26.030 --> 06:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
and Senator Pearl was down there also
 
06:53:26.040 --> 06:53:27.530 align:start position:0%
and Senator Pearl was down there also
and

06:53:27.530 --> 06:53:27.540 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:53:31.368 --> 06:53:31.378 align:start position:0%
we ended up voting 19-0
 
06:53:34.010 --> 06:53:34.020 align:start position:0%
in the committee went on the consent
 
06:53:37.730 --> 06:53:37.740 align:start position:0%
calendar consent calendar went over to
 
06:53:37.740 --> 06:53:39.170 align:start position:0%
calendar consent calendar went over to
the

06:53:39.170 --> 06:53:39.180 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:53:42.048 --> 06:53:42.058 align:start position:0%
from the house to the Senate
 
06:53:44.510 --> 06:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
Senate under their dubious ways because
 
06:53:46.190 --> 06:53:46.200 align:start position:0%
of all the on the bus bills they were
 
06:53:47.628 --> 06:53:47.638 align:start position:0%
doing at the time
 
06:53:49.670 --> 06:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
is that they threw it all in a big
 
06:53:52.070 --> 06:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
packet and on top of it said
 
06:53:55.128 --> 06:53:55.138 align:start position:0%
consent calendar table and this bill
 
06:53:58.310 --> 06:53:58.320 align:start position:0%
here 1592 was in table and never had a
 
06:53:58.320 --> 06:54:00.468 align:start position:0%
here 1592 was in table and never had a
hearing

06:54:00.468 --> 06:54:00.478 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
06:54:02.510 --> 06:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
and I want to go into the reason why I
 
06:54:05.750 --> 06:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
limited the container size
 
06:54:12.230 --> 06:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:15.170 --> 06:54:15.180 align:start position:0%
had huge hearings both in the house and
 
06:54:16.490 --> 06:54:16.500 align:start position:0%
in the Senate
 
06:54:19.610 --> 06:54:19.620 align:start position:0%
Senator French he amended hb95
 
06:54:22.310 --> 06:54:22.320 align:start position:0%
addressing a labeling issue which we
 
06:54:24.410 --> 06:54:24.420 align:start position:0%
didn't have that we were going to do
 
06:54:27.230 --> 06:54:27.240 align:start position:0%
to a table that and so the one of the
 
06:54:29.930 --> 06:54:29.940 align:start position:0%
key elements in the labeling issue was
 
06:54:32.868 --> 06:54:32.878 align:start position:0%
stating consuming raw milk may increase
 
06:54:37.190 --> 06:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
your risk of foodborne illnesses
 
06:54:37.200 --> 06:54:38.448 align:start position:0%
your risk of foodborne illnesses
foreign

06:54:38.448 --> 06:54:38.458 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
06:54:40.968 --> 06:54:40.978 align:start position:0%
So I listened to
 
06:54:43.670 --> 06:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner Jasper and HHS
 
06:54:47.270 --> 06:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
and some of the suggestions maybe is
 
06:54:48.948 --> 06:54:48.958 align:start position:0%
if we don't want to do licensings
 
06:54:51.770 --> 06:54:51.780 align:start position:0%
because they want to stay exempt then
 
06:54:56.090 --> 06:54:56.100 align:start position:0%
let's take a look at maybe somehow a
 
06:54:58.490 --> 06:54:58.500 align:start position:0%
regulatory uh
 
06:55:01.610 --> 06:55:01.620 align:start position:0%
documentation or registry
 
06:55:04.490 --> 06:55:04.500 align:start position:0%
because at that meeting new in HP 95
 
06:55:07.670 --> 06:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner Jasper says he has no idea
 
06:55:09.948 --> 06:55:09.958 align:start position:0%
how many farms they've either making or
 
06:55:11.570 --> 06:55:11.580 align:start position:0%
selling or I know
 
06:55:14.690 --> 06:55:14.700 align:start position:0%
so at least this should be excuse me
 
06:55:16.730 --> 06:55:16.740 align:start position:0%
there should be some type of
 
06:55:19.788 --> 06:55:19.798 align:start position:0%
documentation so that if there was a
 
06:55:22.250 --> 06:55:22.260 align:start position:0%
major break outbreak then they could go
 
06:55:27.110 --> 06:55:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:28.730 --> 06:55:28.740 align:start position:0%
I still believe you should have it once
 
06:55:31.788 --> 06:55:31.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:34.430 --> 06:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I did when I was
 
06:55:36.770 --> 06:55:36.780 align:start position:0%
vice president of operation I also
 
06:55:38.570 --> 06:55:38.580 align:start position:0%
belong to an organization which is
 
06:55:40.548 --> 06:55:40.558 align:start position:0%
called the National Conference of
 
06:55:43.430 --> 06:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
Interstate milkshop is which is 50
 
06:55:45.968 --> 06:55:45.978 align:start position:0%
states plus some International countries
 
06:55:48.530 --> 06:55:48.540 align:start position:0%
that have both Public Health Department
 
06:55:51.590 --> 06:55:51.600 align:start position:0%
of Agriculture in Industry with an
 
06:55:54.708 --> 06:55:54.718 align:start position:0%
oversight from FDA and when listeria
 
06:55:58.070 --> 06:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
started getting serious with um
 
06:56:00.530 --> 06:56:00.540 align:start position:0%
within the industry especially when the
 
06:56:01.850 --> 06:56:01.860 align:start position:0%
study first came out from the University
 
06:56:06.530 --> 06:56:06.540 align:start position:0%
of Vermont that listeria can survive
 
06:56:09.708 --> 06:56:09.718 align:start position:0%
freezing temperatures
 
06:56:11.930 --> 06:56:11.940 align:start position:0%
so we developed good manufacturing
 
06:56:11.940 --> 06:56:13.010 align:start position:0%
so we developed good manufacturing
practices

06:56:13.010 --> 06:56:13.020 align:start position:0%
practices
 
06:56:14.868 --> 06:56:14.878 align:start position:0%
we developed tacit which was Hazard
 
06:56:19.190 --> 06:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
analysis critical control points and I
 
06:56:21.948 --> 06:56:21.958 align:start position:0%
would think somewhere along the line we
 
06:56:24.230 --> 06:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
would need to take a re-look at this
 
06:56:24.240 --> 06:56:25.788 align:start position:0%
would need to take a re-look at this
here

06:56:25.788 --> 06:56:25.798 align:start position:0%
here
 
06:56:28.070 --> 06:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
representative verbal
 
06:56:30.770 --> 06:56:30.780 align:start position:0%
a friendly Amendment about raising the
 
06:56:32.810 --> 06:56:32.820 align:start position:0%
quantity size
 
06:56:35.090 --> 06:56:35.100 align:start position:0%
I would be absolutely against that
 
06:56:37.310 --> 06:56:37.320 align:start position:0%
whatsoever I know I put the six ounce
 
06:56:39.890 --> 06:56:39.900 align:start position:0%
size in So based on studies that I was
 
06:56:42.830 --> 06:56:42.840 align:start position:0%
involved with with FDA over the years is
 
06:56:46.730 --> 06:56:46.740 align:start position:0%
that if you even have a half gallon
 
06:56:49.788 --> 06:56:49.798 align:start position:0%
and you have cows sheep goats and any of
 
06:56:54.110 --> 06:56:54.120 align:start position:0%
those mammals that shed listeria and not
 
06:56:56.270 --> 06:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
only do they shed it but listeria is
 
06:56:58.788 --> 06:56:58.798 align:start position:0%
also found naturally out and it's
 
06:57:01.730 --> 06:57:01.740 align:start position:0%
ubiquitous throughout the soils and it's
 
06:57:03.948 --> 06:57:03.958 align:start position:0%
an environmental bacteria
 
06:57:06.770 --> 06:57:06.780 align:start position:0%
and I read the reread the document from
 
06:57:09.410 --> 06:57:09.420 align:start position:0%
the goat person that testified on the
 
06:57:12.110 --> 06:57:12.120 align:start position:0%
Senate last year where she explained how
 
06:57:14.810 --> 06:57:14.820 align:start position:0%
they took a bucket of milk and then put
 
06:57:17.330 --> 06:57:17.340 align:start position:0%
it in a refrigerator to try to cool it
 
06:57:20.690 --> 06:57:20.700 align:start position:0%
down because it's usually at uh memo
 
06:57:23.270 --> 06:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
temperature so you have a chance of
 
06:57:25.250 --> 06:57:25.260 align:start position:0%
growth if you get it either by
 
06:57:27.350 --> 06:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
environmental because of smaller
 
06:57:30.530 --> 06:57:30.540 align:start position:0%
locations aren't capable probably as
 
06:57:32.448 --> 06:57:32.458 align:start position:0%
some of our big facilities that I had
 
06:57:36.830 --> 06:57:36.840 align:start position:0%
where we segregated raw systems from
 
06:57:39.410 --> 06:57:39.420 align:start position:0%
pasteurized systems and we even had
 
06:57:40.670 --> 06:57:40.680 align:start position:0%
maintenance people we had different
 
06:57:42.468 --> 06:57:42.478 align:start position:0%
color clothing so they would not
 
06:57:42.478 --> 06:57:44.448 align:start position:0%
color clothing so they would not
cross-contaminate

06:57:44.448 --> 06:57:44.458 align:start position:0%
cross-contaminate
 
06:57:46.910 --> 06:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
so there is a concern on that so my
 
06:57:49.610 --> 06:57:49.620 align:start position:0%
leaning is that since
 
06:57:49.620 --> 06:57:52.490 align:start position:0%
leaning is that since
hb95

06:57:52.490 --> 06:57:52.500 align:start position:0%
hb95
 
06:57:54.650 --> 06:57:54.660 align:start position:0%
was just signed by the governor in July
 
06:57:56.390 --> 06:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
I believe of last year
 
06:57:58.850 --> 06:57:58.860 align:start position:0%
why don't you give it a chance
 
06:57:58.860 --> 06:58:00.890 align:start position:0%
why don't you give it a chance
and

06:58:00.890 --> 06:58:00.900 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:58:02.510 --> 06:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
monitor it because you can always come
 
06:58:04.430 --> 06:58:04.440 align:start position:0%
back in January the following year and
 
06:58:06.910 --> 06:58:06.920 align:start position:0%
I'm changing my position from support to
 
06:58:08.990 --> 06:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
I'll either continue to put in an
 
06:58:10.368 --> 06:58:10.378 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
06:58:12.110 --> 06:58:12.120 align:start position:0%
because there's some other little minor
 
06:58:13.628 --> 06:58:13.638 align:start position:0%
things that I can send you later
 
06:58:16.310 --> 06:58:16.320 align:start position:0%
regarding that um
 
06:58:17.868 --> 06:58:17.878 align:start position:0%
some of the definition is going to have
 
06:58:19.128 --> 06:58:19.138 align:start position:0%
to be changed
 
06:58:23.930 --> 06:58:23.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:26.208 --> 06:58:26.218 align:start position:0%
you need one of the definitions a milk
 
06:58:28.368 --> 06:58:28.378 align:start position:0%
producer distributor that sells raw milk
 
06:58:30.350 --> 06:58:30.360 align:start position:0%
greater than 20 gallons that needs to
 
06:58:33.708 --> 06:58:33.718 align:start position:0%
get into 184 38 because some of some of
 
06:58:36.288 --> 06:58:36.298 align:start position:0%
the other rsas the small little things
 
06:58:40.010 --> 06:58:40.020 align:start position:0%
but they don't coincide so to clean this
 
06:58:42.468 --> 06:58:42.478 align:start position:0%
whole thing up you need to go back and
 
06:58:45.350 --> 06:58:45.360 align:start position:0%
look at some of the other rsas and as a
 
06:58:47.628 --> 06:58:47.638 align:start position:0%
conjunction that and I don't know if you
 
06:58:51.230 --> 06:58:51.240 align:start position:0%
have a researcher here that can still do
 
06:58:51.240 --> 06:58:52.990 align:start position:0%
have a researcher here that can still do
that

06:58:52.990 --> 06:58:53.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:58:55.910 --> 06:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
so that that's what I've
 
06:58:59.390 --> 06:58:59.400 align:start position:0%
I want to say because
 
06:59:00.948 --> 06:59:00.958 align:start position:0%
I know you guys have been here for a
 
06:59:00.958 --> 06:59:02.930 align:start position:0%
I know you guys have been here for a
while

06:59:02.930 --> 06:59:02.940 align:start position:0%
while
 
06:59:04.850 --> 06:59:04.860 align:start position:0%
and again
 
06:59:06.650 --> 06:59:06.660 align:start position:0%
going back on the container size one
 
06:59:07.730 --> 06:59:07.740 align:start position:0%
more time
 
06:59:10.250 --> 06:59:10.260 align:start position:0%
because if you have little kids at home
 
06:59:12.530 --> 06:59:12.540 align:start position:0%
or a pregnant mother
 
06:59:15.410 --> 06:59:15.420 align:start position:0%
and you take that container out and it's
 
06:59:17.868 --> 06:59:17.878 align:start position:0%
a half gallon or well most of them not
 
06:59:19.250 --> 06:59:19.260 align:start position:0%
that you got cheetah bottom so they're
 
06:59:23.270 --> 06:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
probably you know 36 ounces of something
 
06:59:27.048 --> 06:59:27.058 align:start position:0%
so uh it's on the uh on the counter and
 
06:59:29.208 --> 06:59:29.218 align:start position:0%
there's a birthday party going on eat
 
06:59:30.410 --> 06:59:30.420 align:start position:0%
ice cream melts and everything else
 
06:59:32.330 --> 06:59:32.340 align:start position:0%
bacteria is growing
 
06:59:34.670 --> 06:59:34.680 align:start position:0%
and put it back in the freezer bring it
 
06:59:37.070 --> 06:59:37.080 align:start position:0%
back out same thing and again when they
 
06:59:38.810 --> 06:59:38.820 align:start position:0%
make the ice cream that's the same thing
 
06:59:41.570 --> 06:59:41.580 align:start position:0%
too because I had Blast Freezes on my
 
06:59:42.948 --> 06:59:42.958 align:start position:0%
ice cream as soon as I packaged it
 
06:59:44.570 --> 06:59:44.580 align:start position:0%
whether it was in a three ounce six
 
06:59:46.788 --> 06:59:46.798 align:start position:0%
ounce or three gallon the three gallon
 
06:59:48.890 --> 06:59:48.900 align:start position:0%
even within 20 minutes was frozen solid
 
06:59:51.650 --> 06:59:51.660 align:start position:0%
but we had that type of equipment these
 
06:59:53.510 --> 06:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
other equipments were small locations
 
06:59:56.930 --> 06:59:56.940 align:start position:0%
their freezes are they uh zero degrees
 
06:59:59.868 --> 06:59:59.878 align:start position:0%
or are they at minus 15.
 
07:00:02.448 --> 07:00:02.458 align:start position:0%
So the faster you freeze it you know the
 
07:00:05.030 --> 07:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
less chance you have any growth of the
 
07:00:05.040 --> 07:00:06.048 align:start position:0%
less chance you have any growth of the
bacteria

07:00:06.048 --> 07:00:06.058 align:start position:0%
bacteria
 
07:00:08.030 --> 07:00:08.040 align:start position:0%
so with that I thank you for inviting me
 
07:00:09.410 --> 07:00:09.420 align:start position:0%
to come up it's been a while since I've
 
07:00:11.270 --> 07:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
been up here and
 
07:00:13.430 --> 07:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
it's nice to see what's going on it's
 
07:00:16.490 --> 07:00:16.500 align:start position:0%
great to have you back in the building
 
07:00:18.170 --> 07:00:18.180 align:start position:0%
we have any questions from the committee
 
07:00:19.910 --> 07:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
on this
 
07:00:22.430 --> 07:00:22.440 align:start position:0%
representative Potenza
 
07:00:24.288 --> 07:00:24.298 align:start position:0%
since you seem like you have the history
 
07:00:26.690 --> 07:00:26.700 align:start position:0%
and you're an expert on this do you even
 
07:00:29.390 --> 07:00:29.400 align:start position:0%
have any idea of what the numbers are of
 
07:00:32.150 --> 07:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
raw milk consumption in the state of New
 
07:00:33.770 --> 07:00:33.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because I've literally never
 
07:00:37.430 --> 07:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
had it so did do we have a uh a
 
07:00:39.708 --> 07:00:39.718 align:start position:0%
documentation that comes out on a
 
07:00:41.810 --> 07:00:41.820 align:start position:0%
monthly basis and it all gets reported
 
07:00:43.310 --> 07:00:43.320 align:start position:0%
now I don't believe the raw milk does
 
07:00:45.650 --> 07:00:45.660 align:start position:0%
get reported but the federal government
 
07:00:47.270 --> 07:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
the milk it's called the Milkman kellara
 
07:00:49.490 --> 07:00:49.500 align:start position:0%
and in there they break it out by
 
07:00:51.650 --> 07:00:51.660 align:start position:0%
classifications whether it's class one
 
07:00:55.310 --> 07:00:55.320 align:start position:0%
milk which is sold at retail level uh
 
07:00:57.288 --> 07:00:57.298 align:start position:0%
class two class three which becomes a
 
07:00:59.810 --> 07:00:59.820 align:start position:0%
what's called a blended product that
 
07:01:02.030 --> 07:01:02.040 align:start position:0%
usually ends up going into uh powdered
 
07:01:03.830 --> 07:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
milk and the farmers get less money for
 
07:01:03.840 --> 07:01:04.548 align:start position:0%
milk and the farmers get less money for
that

07:01:04.548 --> 07:01:04.558 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:01:06.170 --> 07:01:06.180 align:start position:0%
so the best thing to do is everybody
 
07:01:08.570 --> 07:01:08.580 align:start position:0%
start drinking no from the retail level
 
07:01:10.310 --> 07:01:10.320 align:start position:0%
so it's a pharmacist because before I
 
07:01:13.190 --> 07:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
left both the commissioner and myself we
 
07:01:15.650 --> 07:01:15.660 align:start position:0%
did our damn this to try to get made in
 
07:01:18.230 --> 07:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire labels we had that and we
 
07:01:19.788 --> 07:01:19.798 align:start position:0%
were going to get enough money to put
 
07:01:21.830 --> 07:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
individually to automate we're trying to
 
07:01:23.570 --> 07:01:23.580 align:start position:0%
work for hoods over here in the conquet
 
07:01:28.968 --> 07:01:28.978 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:30.850 --> 07:01:30.860 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
07:01:33.708 --> 07:01:33.718 align:start position:0%
yeah I just because it's just an area
 
07:01:36.890 --> 07:01:36.900 align:start position:0%
that I'm not um you know I just don't I
 
07:01:38.930 --> 07:01:38.940 align:start position:0%
don't know much about it I I would
 
07:01:41.448 --> 07:01:41.458 align:start position:0%
assume if you're drinking raw milk if
 
07:01:43.610 --> 07:01:43.620 align:start position:0%
you're a parent buying it in your in
 
07:01:45.410 --> 07:01:45.420 align:start position:0%
your house like
 
07:01:47.150 --> 07:01:47.160 align:start position:0%
I don't know it just seems to me it
 
07:01:48.110 --> 07:01:48.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be something that would be left
 
07:01:49.968 --> 07:01:49.978 align:start position:0%
out on the counter you obviously know
 
07:01:51.650 --> 07:01:51.660 align:start position:0%
you're saying that you guys put the
 
07:01:53.990 --> 07:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
label on there I've never had raw milk
 
07:01:57.048 --> 07:01:57.058 align:start position:0%
so I just I don't has it has it been an
 
07:01:58.850 --> 07:01:58.860 align:start position:0%
issue I mean you said it was an issue in
 
07:02:02.150 --> 07:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
a commercial but the DHS commercials was
 
07:02:04.010 --> 07:02:04.020 align:start position:0%
the capital Baptist at first I've heard
 
07:02:07.490 --> 07:02:07.500 align:start position:0%
about that here okay but last month in
 
07:02:09.890 --> 07:02:09.900 align:start position:0%
Florida there's a huge huge recall going
 
07:02:12.110 --> 07:02:12.120 align:start position:0%
on in listeria and but that's typically
 
07:02:13.730 --> 07:02:13.740 align:start position:0%
would be followed by an environmental
 
07:02:16.610 --> 07:02:16.620 align:start position:0%
issue typically ventilation systems
 
07:02:19.250 --> 07:02:19.260 align:start position:0%
drains anything that has the moisture
 
07:02:22.670 --> 07:02:22.680 align:start position:0%
inside refrigerators and so forth
 
07:02:26.150 --> 07:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
they can cross-contaminate that way
 
07:02:28.128 --> 07:02:28.138 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby
 
07:02:31.150 --> 07:02:31.160 align:start position:0%
I'm back thank you representative so um
 
07:02:35.208 --> 07:02:35.218 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering about the the increase uh
 
07:02:38.330 --> 07:02:38.340 align:start position:0%
for an uninspected facility going from
 
07:02:41.628 --> 07:02:41.638 align:start position:0%
20 gallons to 160 gallons and I'm
 
07:02:44.390 --> 07:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
wondering and one of the things that we
 
07:02:47.510 --> 07:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
heard in committee before was that the
 
07:02:50.770 --> 07:02:50.780 align:start position:0%
uh the extent the the quantity of sales
 
07:02:55.430 --> 07:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh increa the the more the more broadly
 
07:02:57.590 --> 07:02:57.600 align:start position:0%
you sell the greater the risk there is
 
07:03:00.230 --> 07:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
I'm not even and and also in terms of
 
07:03:03.110 --> 07:03:03.120 align:start position:0%
you know the if you're pooling all of
 
07:03:05.030 --> 07:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
Vienna all of milk
 
07:03:06.830 --> 07:03:06.840 align:start position:0%
um the more animals you have pooling
 
07:03:11.510 --> 07:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
into one uh bulk container uh the more
 
07:03:14.090 --> 07:03:14.100 align:start position:0%
if one of the animals is sick then you
 
07:03:15.410 --> 07:03:15.420 align:start position:0%
have a greater risk I'm wondering what
 
07:03:17.510 --> 07:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
you think about you know whether that
 
07:03:19.548 --> 07:03:19.558 align:start position:0%
jumped from 20 to 160 makes sense
 
07:03:21.650 --> 07:03:21.660 align:start position:0%
whether you think there's any jump makes
 
07:03:23.150 --> 07:03:23.160 align:start position:0%
sense or whether you think it's probably
 
07:03:25.330 --> 07:03:25.340 align:start position:0%
good at doing it I would say stay with
 
07:03:29.270 --> 07:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
hb95 and keep keep the volume at what it
 
07:03:31.548 --> 07:03:31.558 align:start position:0%
is at this point in time
 
07:03:33.890 --> 07:03:33.900 align:start position:0%
and because basically again when she
 
07:03:37.548 --> 07:03:37.558 align:start position:0%
testified over on the Senate side uh
 
07:03:39.350 --> 07:03:39.360 align:start position:0%
small farmers they're not going to have
 
07:03:41.810 --> 07:03:41.820 align:start position:0%
a bulk tank they usually have stainless
 
07:03:44.628 --> 07:03:44.638 align:start position:0%
steel pails and then they can carry you
 
07:03:47.410 --> 07:03:47.420 align:start position:0%
know five or six gallons that way there
 
07:03:51.468 --> 07:03:51.478 align:start position:0%
from from her her testimony and how she
 
07:03:53.810 --> 07:03:53.820 align:start position:0%
handles her phone and it was it sounds
 
07:03:57.048 --> 07:03:57.058 align:start position:0%
like it's it's you know the global gold
 
07:04:00.708 --> 07:04:00.718 align:start position:0%
standard she was doing an excellent job
 
07:04:02.628 --> 07:04:02.638 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:04:05.208 --> 07:04:05.218 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you madam
 
07:04:06.830 --> 07:04:06.840 align:start position:0%
chair and it's wonderful to see you
 
07:04:09.410 --> 07:04:09.420 align:start position:0%
again just for a little Personal
 
07:04:12.170 --> 07:04:12.180 align:start position:0%
Privilege I served with you on hb617 so
 
07:04:13.968 --> 07:04:13.978 align:start position:0%
it's great to see you back still
 
07:04:16.628 --> 07:04:16.638 align:start position:0%
following you on your way thank you
 
07:04:19.128 --> 07:04:19.138 align:start position:0%
especially composting yes thanks so much
 
07:04:20.628 --> 07:04:20.638 align:start position:0%
on that one
 
07:04:28.310 --> 07:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:30.830 --> 07:04:30.840 align:start position:0%
uh says they don't have the ability to
 
07:04:32.390 --> 07:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
detect those two types of bacteria
 
07:04:34.850 --> 07:04:34.860 align:start position:0%
that's an odorless type of bacteria or
 
07:04:36.288 --> 07:04:36.298 align:start position:0%
is it not like could you smell it and
 
07:04:38.510 --> 07:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
say oh this is off no you can't you've
 
07:04:40.250 --> 07:04:40.260 align:start position:0%
got that like you say this is listeria
 
07:04:43.250 --> 07:04:43.260 align:start position:0%
can't live back to Yesenia uh and then
 
07:04:44.570 --> 07:04:44.580 align:start position:0%
the other one that's really nasty but
 
07:04:46.548 --> 07:04:46.558 align:start position:0%
typically it's mostly going into the
 
07:04:49.788 --> 07:04:49.798 align:start position:0%
hamburgers is the E coli over there that
 
07:04:52.548 --> 07:04:52.558 align:start position:0%
one but with little kids can create a
 
07:04:54.170 --> 07:04:54.180 align:start position:0%
depth on that one
 
07:04:57.590 --> 07:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
see you representative verval
 
07:04:59.750 --> 07:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you as uh we'll have to take this
 
07:04:59.760 --> 07:05:00.770 align:start position:0%
thank you as uh we'll have to take this
question

07:05:00.770 --> 07:05:00.780 align:start position:0%
question
 
07:05:03.530 --> 07:05:03.540 align:start position:0%
nice to see you uh Mr O'Connor
 
07:05:05.510 --> 07:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
you're my first chairman you taught me
 
07:05:06.948 --> 07:05:06.958 align:start position:0%
well I think
 
07:05:08.990 --> 07:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
um my as a former victim of chemical
 
07:05:11.090 --> 07:05:11.100 align:start position:0%
doctor my understanding
 
07:05:13.788 --> 07:05:13.798 align:start position:0%
um from the CDC because I went to the
 
07:05:15.650 --> 07:05:15.660 align:start position:0%
hospital for being sick and it's a
 
07:05:18.468 --> 07:05:18.478 align:start position:0%
mandatory report so the CDC uh called me
 
07:05:20.690 --> 07:05:20.700 align:start position:0%
up and they said the Number One Source
 
07:05:23.690 --> 07:05:23.700 align:start position:0%
Capital factor is intermingling of human
 
07:05:25.190 --> 07:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
feces with food
 
07:05:27.770 --> 07:05:27.780 align:start position:0%
so that that's what they told me I'm not
 
07:05:30.350 --> 07:05:30.360 align:start position:0%
saying it can't occur in in milk
 
07:05:32.750 --> 07:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
but I it's not a question just I just
 
07:05:36.170 --> 07:05:36.180 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:38.390 --> 07:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
did you say that there's a requirement
 
07:05:41.390 --> 07:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
to label raw milk that consuming raw
 
07:05:44.770 --> 07:05:44.780 align:start position:0%
milk may increase the chances of is
 
07:05:48.288 --> 07:05:48.298 align:start position:0%
that's a current requirement yes okay no
 
07:05:49.610 --> 07:05:49.620 align:start position:0%
you don't have to look it up I'll take
 
07:05:52.010 --> 07:05:52.020 align:start position:0%
your word for it uh Mr O'Connor I served
 
07:05:53.750 --> 07:05:53.760 align:start position:0%

07:08:00.410 --> 07:08:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:03.590 --> 07:08:03.600 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm I would um I do want to work in
 
07:08:06.430 --> 07:08:06.440 align:start position:0%
some caucus time for each of our
 
07:08:09.010 --> 07:08:09.020 align:start position:0%
caucuses to discuss
 
07:08:12.170 --> 07:08:12.180 align:start position:0%
executing those bills so
 
07:08:17.208 --> 07:08:17.218 align:start position:0%
it's possible we may have instead of uh
 
07:08:19.430 --> 07:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
for for the committee work session we
 
07:08:22.128 --> 07:08:22.138 align:start position:0%
may break that off a little early to
 
07:08:24.410 --> 07:08:24.420 align:start position:0%
meet before we do the exec of the bill
 
07:08:24.420 --> 07:08:44.288 align:start position:0%
meet before we do the exec of the bill
yep

07:08:44.288 --> 07:08:44.298 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:47.448 --> 07:08:47.458 align:start position:0%
right no we're not going to expect that
 
07:08:55.570 --> 07:08:55.580 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:58.548 --> 07:08:58.558 align:start position:0%
